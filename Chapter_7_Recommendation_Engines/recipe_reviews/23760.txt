Very good but my suggestion as to why they may not turn out well...make sure that the enchiladas and wrapped tightly and that the egg mixture almost covers over them completely.  If there is too much tortilla sticking out, they will burn on top as previous complaints have stated, while the inside tastes just fine.  The first time I made this recipe, the top of my tortillas didn't burn but got semi-hard after cooking.  They were still good enough for me to try again and the second time, after making sure that it was mostly covered with the egg mixture, they turned out REALLY GOOD.  I also added more cheese in the mixture. This is a good recipe but it is one that takes practice to make perfect.  Hopefully, readers will take this suggestion into account and try them.  They are worth it and my family now requests them regularly.  (I even made them for dinner once and used a variety of mexican toppings to complete the meal).

If I could have rated this recipe higher than 5 stars, I would have.
This is by far the best breakfast meal I have ever made. EVERYONE loved it.
We had a birthday party and had the family over for brunch.  
I found this recipe when I was looking for something different to make.  We all love breakfast burritos and thought this would be good.  I was getting tired of the same old breakfast casseroles.
I used some ideas that some of your other users had.  I added 1 Tbl of green chilis AND jalapenos into the ham mixture.  I did not want to use too much in case it got too hot. 
I used a mixture of cheese I found (Kraft) that was cheddar and jack cheese with jalapeno mixed in.  I also used red pepper along with the green.  I made sure I poured the egg mixture over all the enchiladas so they were completly wet. I covered them with foil and cooked them for 50 minutes.  I removed the foil and sprinkled the top with more cheese and put them back in the oven without the foil until the cheese melted and bubbled.
I served them with sour cream, salsa, the left over jalepenos and green chilis - Bacon, sausage and hash browns on the side.

I substituted 1/2 lb bulk sausage (browned and drained) for the ham, added 16 oz frozen hashbrowns (sauteed them and the onions with the cooked sausage), added more onions to the tortilla filling.  I also added one more egg, salt and pepper, and another cup of cheese on top of the casserole.  I baked for 45 min covered with foil, removed the foil for 15 more minutes.  When the casserole came out of the oven, I sprinkled with more green onions and dollops of Pace Picante Sauce.  It looked beautiful with all the different colors and tasted divine!  I will definately make again.

I made this for some friends. The pan was so huge I'd figured we'd leftovers... nope! Evey last enchilada was gone! 

I made a few "updates" to the recipie:

*Corn tortillas as I think they have a better taste than flour toritllas 
*Country sausage instead of ham
*1 Extra egg
*Extra seasoning and hotsauce to give it more of a "kick" 
*I used Red and Yellow Bell Peppers and left out the Green Bell Pepper.
*Added Sauted Onion

I will be making this again!!

This is a favorite, but the recipe's portions are really big, unless you are feeding people with huge appetites.  I have served this a few tmes, and have always found that  about 3/4 of one enchilada satisfies an adult.  Because dish is quite dense, serve it with something light, like a fruit salad.  Lastly, because the dish is covered in cheese before baking, you will have great trouble finding each of the enchiladas when you are ready to serve.  Avoid this problem by marking the location of each enchilada with toothpicks before baking.

Wonderful dish.  Enjoyed by all at a brunch this morning.  Read all reviews and incorporated some of the suggestions: replaced red pepper for the green, added a small can of diced green chilies, replaced Jimmy Dean breakfast sausages (crumbled and browned) for the ham, used half shredded cheddar and half shredded pepper jack.  Delicious, rich, satisfying. Served with mild salsa.  Will also have available sour cream and guacamole the next time I make this.

I made this dish for my in-laws at Christmas and a church group and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I was so glad that I could prepare it the night before and I did incorporate many of the suggestions others gave.  I used Jimmy Dean sausage and added chli powder while it cooked.  I mixed in chopped green onion, chopped bell pepper and a can of green chilis (a must). I used both cheddar and Kraft Mexican cheddar jack cheese in the tortillas.  To the egg mixture I added 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder, chili powder, salt, pepper, cumin and cilantro along with the hot pepper sauce. I sprinkled some of the sausage mix around the tortillas and after it set over night I did add a bit more egg/milk/cream mix to the top with a sprinkle of cheese.  I covered with foil while it cooked and had no problems. This tasted fantastic with salsa and sour cream and the leftovers were great re-heated.  When I made this a third time I did find that using less than 6 eggs and too much cheese made the consistency a little too runny/gooey for my taste. Overall a great find!

Huge hit on Christmas morning with my family.  It was gone -- completely.  As for the problem some wrote about the top getting crisp, i just made sure to cover it with aluminum foil while baking.  I served with a fruit salad.

Very good, with the addition of a dash of cumin, a teaspoon of chili powder and of cilantro, 1/2 t salt and a couple grinds of pepper.  I increased the hot pepper to three shakes and added a small can of green chili's.  I made it in a 10x15 greased pyrex with 6" corn tortillas.  Had to whisk up one more egg with cream to add to cover the tortillas.  (I would  have given it 5 but I'm not crazy about ham - made it just to use up the leftovers.)

YUM!  I made this exactly as written except I added bacon.  These were absolutely delicious.  The prep time is extensive but they are totally worth it.  (I didn't process the ham though, I only chopped it because pureed ham seems weird). Sausage or hashbrowns would also taste great in the tortillas as would mushrooms.  These could work like an omelete, you could add or take things out based on personal taste.  I plan on serving these for Christmas breakfast.  They look and taste fantastic.  One piece of advice, don't try to cram too many tortillas in the pan, this will cause them to not lay flat in the pan, which will lead to them not be submerged enough in the egg mixture and then the tortillas will harden.

I made some changes using what I had and the end result was very near a 5! I used about 10 oz of turkey bacon that I pan fried and then crumbled rather than ham.  I used green onion and pepper as suggested and then mixed this all together with grated sharp cheddar (about 1 1/2 C of the cheese).  Then I placed a generous amount inside of each 9" tortilla- making only 7 total.  For the egg mixture I used 6 eggs, about 2 C of 1% milk and 1/2 C sour cream and no flour.  I added the garlic, green hot sauce and then a dash of salt.  I poured it over the tortillas in the morning, covered it generously with more sharp cheddar, let it sit in fridge until evening, took it out and put it on the counter for about 30 minutes befor baking it for about 45 or 50 minutes.  Delicious even for dinner.  Didn't even need any salsa or anything.

De-ee-lish!!!   Our family tried this recipe on a whim and now we make it all the time! Great for entertaining  because it's simple to make, not very messy to make or eat and can be customized to each guest's liking. We set up a Brunch Enchilada Bar so everyone can throw their favorite things on top of their enchilada. My personal favorite - sour cream, lettuce, black olives and taco sauce on the top!

I made these with my leftover ham from Thanksgiving.  I heeded the other reviewers and covered while baking the first 45 minutes. I also added frozen peas.  I seasoned the meat/green onion/pea mixture with cumin, white pepper, salt and cracked pepper (I was conservative because it was for a church brunch but will be more liberal next time).  I made sure to cover the tortillas with the cream/egg mixture while soaking and cooking.  I added another egg and more cream/milk to make sure it was covered.  Also, I think it's important to grease the dish - if you don't they might stick b/c of the eggs.  It actually turned out pretty and tasted pretty good.  I like my food spicy so I am sure when I make it again it will be better - I didn't not add the hot sauce - that would have been delicious I think.  A perfect brunch dish.  My dish was empty when I left church so I think it was a hit.  I also served it with sour cream and "On the Border" brand salsa.  Thanks for the recipe!

***With very few changes it's 5 stars!***    This was awesome!  And wonderful to have all prep work done to just simply throw in oven Christmas morning!  I made very few changes: I doubled the liquid mixture so that it completely covered the tortillas/enchiladas as another reviewer suggested, substituting green onions for a small yellow onion instead.  Adding this additional liquid mixture was definitely a must! But because of this, more liquid to cook, I ended up keeping it in the oven probably another 30-45 minutes.  Also, I put a ton of cheese on top and baked after that for about 10-15 minutes instead of the cook's suggestion for only 3.  This was really very good and we will definitely make it again!  Thank you so much for such an easy, crowd pleasing meal!  It was incredible!

I make this for our staff breakfasts and it is one of the first dishes gone every time. It's a great recipe to experiment with. I use green chilis instead of the peppers and it's yummy!

I made this for our park brunch & received great comments. I used 1 pound cooked sausage & used 2 1/2 cups milk no cream. After reading all the reviews, I was very concerned about the flour tortillas becoming hard during baking. After pouring the egg mixture on top, I pushed the flour tortillas into the mixture. The next morning & before cooking I spooned the egg mixture on top of the tortillas and the tortillas were not hard after baking. I would make this again!

This was a good recipe, however, a bit bland. I topped mine w/ salsa and sour cream to give it some spice. Next time I think I will, rather than ham, I will used a mixture of ground spicy and sweet italian sausages.

Amazing!  The best breakfast enchiladas I've ever tried.  I used 1 lb. sausage instead of the ham, and added  some salsa to each tortilla.  Wish I could give better than 5 stars!!

Awesome!  My husband loves these.  I used mild sausage instead of the ham, fat-free half and half and skim milk.  Next time I want to try it with the ham!  Served with salsa, sour cream, and hashbrowns.

This was fabulous! I tweaked the recipe to be more low-fat: low-fat tortillas, 1/2 lb  low-fat ham, 1 cup egg-substitute plus 2 eggs, fat-free half & half, 1/2 lb low-fat turkey sausage, skim milk...I added salt, black pepper, onions (sautéing them with the sausage), and used a small chopped orange sweet pepper in place of the green pepper. Next time I'll switch out the cheese for reduced-fat! Excellent served with salsa!!

These turned out good and had great flavor.  However, the tops of my tortilla's were crunchy and overcooked.  Next time I will keep them covered for the first 45 minutes or so and then uncover when I go to put the cheese on.  Other than that it's a great recipe and will for sure make these again. Thanks for sharing!

These were Delicious! I used sausage instead of Ham but otherwise followed the recipe. Got lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.

Delicious recipe, was a huge hit! I substituted green chilis for the bell pepper and they were delicious.  Also made half with ham and half with bacon.  As others noted, the ends of the tortillas got a little burnt/crispy so my advice would be to keep some of the egg mixture out and pour it over the ends half-way through cooking or so.  Otherwise, a great recipe and I'll make it again!

I made these for a brunch and they were a huge hit!  I got several requests for the recipe.  I did use sausage instead of ham.  Before filling the tortillas I wrapped them in a damp paper towel and stuck them in the microwave for 1 minute, that makes them much easier to roll up.

Following the advice of other reviews, I covered these during cooking and marked them with toothpicks (good advice).  They were good, but the end result was very casserole-like & not very enchilada-like. Although they kept their shape during baking, with the egg mixture baked up around them, I could not really differentiate the taste of the flour tortilla when eating them. If I had known they would be like that, I would have saved on the trouble of rolling, etc, & would have just made a Mexican breakfast casserole that has layered tortillas in it. Not a bad flavor, just not what I wanted.  Has anyone else thought this?  Next time I will try a breakfast burrito recipe.

We live in Long Beach, WA and host the International Kite Festival. I made this for 40 of the Kite Flyers from all parts of the world. It was an absolute success for the brunch we served on the beach and everyone wanted the recipe. The only thing I changed was using sausage instead of ham. Thank You Thank You

Updated 2/17/2015: My version of this recipe is a real hit with family and friends. I replace the ham with 1/2 pound each of cooked sage or country style sausage and chorizo sausage. Instead of green bell's, I use red bell for the sweetness and add 1/2 cup of chopped roasted mild green chilies. For my taste, I would add jalapeno's, but since most of my friends and family have a tame palate, I leave the hot stuff on the side. I also replaced the cheddar with a Mexican cheese blend. You could also use oaxaca or asadero cheese in this recipe. I add an extra egg (6 eggs total). For seasoning, I add 1/2 tsp of kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper (to taste), and a "special" ingredient...1/2 tsp smoked paprika. The paprika goes very well with the chorizo and adds a bit more smoke flavor. Also, if you really want to turn up the flavor, make your own tortillas! 

Thanks for this recipe DBLUNCK!

I make this recipe quite often and everyone loves it. Since I'm not a bacon fan I use breakfast sausage instead.  I also end up having to double the egg mixture.  I put toothpicks in each Enchilada so that they do not unwrap and stay at the bottom of the pan whilerefrigerated.

Loved this recipe....My family gets tired of the usual breakfast of eggs, either scrambled or omeletes.  The only thing I didn't have was half and half I just used 1 one cup of milk and it still turned out yummy.  I also cut the recipe in half and only used 6 egss.  Instead of ham (didn't have any on hand) I fried up some scrapple.  The scrapple made the enchilada.  I will definitely make this again.  I am gonna maybe use sausage next.  Thanx for the great recipe and changing up our usual breakfast routine.

I would make it again, but I would kick it up. Add diced green chilies or more hot sauce. I would not put the ham in processor. I just chopped it!

We had this for a New Years's Day brunch and my husband talked about them all day long!  He loved them.  I used whole wheat flour tortillas and changed the milk to cream ratio a bit.  They did get a little crunchy on top, but he thought that was part of their charm.  We served salsa and guacamole on the side.

I made these with maple flavored sausage, a can of green chiles, and extra hot pepper sauce; left out the green peppers just because I don't care for them.  I left the foil on for most of the baking time.  They were very good, but next time I will use fat free half and half and Egg
Beaters.

I omitted the meat and added red peppers, salsa and pepper-jack cheese to create a vegetarian version of this recipe for a few guests that don't eat meat.  It was loved by the "meat eaters" as well.  Thank you, Darlene!

My family loved this recipe! I used Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage (I precooked it) instead of the ham.  I also added a small can of chopped chilies.  I covered with foil part way thru the cooking to keep them from browning too much.

My sister and her family were here for a long weekend. I tried this recipe and everyone loved it. We had kids and adults asking for more!!
I bought the frozen all ready cut onions,green peppers,red peppers. It worked wonderful with the cut up deli ham. 
We added sour cream and salsa to our servings.
It was great!!

I would have rated a 5 but the egg mixture did not cover the enchiladas.  My solution was to remove after cooking for 20-30 minutes or just before the enchalidas brown on top.  I took the back of a spoon and pushed down till egg mixture moistened the enchalidas.  They were fine but the next time I will make one and half the egg portion.  The taste was really excellent and  and different than the usual sausage fare everyone makes.  Good for Christmas breakfast that can be put together ahead.

these were good, although a little milder than I anticipated.  I added some fresh mushrooms to the green onion and bell pepper mix, which we really enjoyed.  I think some green chili's would have been really good as well.  Do let these sit overnight as that is what appears to thicken the sauce up.  I didn't, and they had to bake longer than the recipe states.

These were a hit at my work potluck. Instead of Ham, I used cooked breakfast sausage crumbles and followed the rest of the recipe as it's written. These enchiladas were to die for. I had many people ask me for the recipe and request I make them again.

I used sausage in place of the ham, corn tortillas instead of the flour tortillas, and added a can of diced green chiles and these were delicious!  Great recipe that I'm sure would have been fantastic as written, I just used what I had on hand.

These were awesome!  I did make a few changes, but I think it's a recipe that will turn out great regardless...I used orange and yellow bell pepper, and crumbled bacon and black beans instead of ham.  I also added a can of small green chilles, used a few more eggs, and probably more cheese.  I let it sit overnight.  Served with salsa and sour cream.  It was a big hit and leftovers were great the next day!

This is a very easy and handy dish.  I followed the directions given.  I was worried that these would be too soggy but they weren't.  They came out great.  The milk/egg mixture seeped into the ham and veggie mix inside the tortilla and after baked it was like scrambled eggs on the inside.  The only thing I would do differently is to set this out 30 minutes to 1 hour before baking.  I had trouble getting the center done.  I had to set a piece of tinfoil on top so the top did not burn because it took a little longer than 55 minutes to get them done. I can't wait to try these again and experiment with different meats and cheeses.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  Our family really enjoyed this.

Made this for Christmas bunch and my family loved it!  I used Jimmy Dean Original Sausage, a can of mild Rotel, a little bit of chopped green pepper and chopped green onion and some shredded cheddar cheese for the filling of each enchilada.  I also varied the recipe a little bit by using less half and half (1.5 cups) and more egg (7 large eggs). I read in other reviews that the egg mixgure turned out like custard, and I wanted it to be more "eggy".  These were a huge hit and I will definitely make them again!

This was a wonderfull recipe...however I did change a few things and it was a hit! I cooked up a pound of sausage and used that instead of ham. I added choped cilantro for some extra flavor, and used monerey jack chesse to give it a kick. I also used my food processor to chop up the onion and bell peper to make it finer.
This was a wonderful breakfast caserole that I will make again and again...I made it for a work potluck and it was the favorite! SERVE WITH SALSA OR PICO DE GALLO.

This was excellent. It turned out very weel I brought to an office breakfast and everyone loved it. Everyone asked for the recipe. I used 3 cans of flaked ham instead of what was called for. I also added 1 tsp each chili powder, cumin, corriander and cinnamon. These spices gave great flavor.

Delicious!  I changed some ingredients and made the enchiladas for Christmas brunch and everyone loved them!
I used spicy sausage (Bob Evan's brand I think) and I used spicy shredded cheddar cheese (Sargento's new line of cheese blends)... other than that I followed you recipe.  Maybe next time I will use more sausage though.
Thanks so much for the great enchiladas!

So good and super easy to make. Perfect for when you have overnight guests. I usually make this with the "Restaurant-Style Hashbrown Casserole" and it keeps everyone full until dinner.

My family loved this brunch dish!  I lightened it up by using 2 cups of 1% milk in place of the cream, turkey ham or 50% reduced fat sausage (Jimmy Dean has a great one) in place of the ham, and reduced fat cheddar cheese.  It was just as good as the regular recipe, with less guilt!

Very convientent, but a little bland for my taste so I piled on my favorite salsa and it was great. I also followed the other reviews and used foil...so no burning for this casserole on Christmas morning!

I substituted cooked chicken for the ham in this recipe and added 3/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper to the meat mixture.  It was VERY good.  My tortillas browned quite a bit more that I'd have liked while being cooked at the minimum amount of time. So, keep an eye on them while they cook!  All my guests, my husband and kids loved them.  I served them with salsa.

These were super awesome!  Loved them and can't wait to make them again.  I took the advise of a few other reviews and added chopped green chilis and diced jalepenos.  They gave just a little kick without overpowering or becoming too spicy for those with sensitive to heat palets.

Omgosh, these are sooo yummy! For the filling, I used a combination of ham, half a can of refried beans, half a can of pinto beans, half a small can of green chilies, half a small can of jalepeno peppers, and an tomato/onion/pepper blend found in the produce section at my local grocer. I used monterey jack cheese inside the filling and used the cheddar for the topping. I spread some salsa over the burritos before adding the cheese. This could totally be a vegetarian dish if you want to omit the ham. If you modify this recipe with the ingredients I used, this will be a mexican dish packed with flavor a hint of a kick. The half and half/ egg mixture provides such flavor and creamy goodness.

This made a hit on Easter morning.  I was skeptical but am glad I tried it.  My one thought is about grinding the ham.  I think you could just chop the ham instead.  We were all a little put off by the texture of ground ham.  Flavor was fantastic! I did not have green onion so used a regualr and that was just fine.

Um, yum. Total crowd pleaser, great for large groups and serious bonus points for being able to make ahead of time.   I followed almost exactly, though did sub milk in for most of the 1/2 and 1/2. Still a total winner :)

I'm only giving this a 3 because I think the recipe is a little off.  It needs WAY more eggs than the recipe calls for.  I loved all the flavors, but it just didn't come out right.  Might try half the batch in the same size pan next time.

The husband raved on this and the kids ate the leftovers very happily.  I didn't make actual enchiladas, rather I layered it like lasagna with torn pieces of the tortillas.  This would work well to use up other assorted things sitting around in the fridge, as well, like leftover veggies or potatoes or pieces of meat.

Was disappointed until I added chunky salsa.  Now I'm addicted.  Are even better as left-overs and reheated in the microwave.  But must - MUST - have chunky salsa on them.

This recipe was good.  It was a little deceiving however, because it appears like there will be way too much liquid based on the recipe.  It does cook way down, so use it all.  I agree with other reviewers that the recipe itself can be a little bland, and next time I think I will definitely spice it up a bit more.  It was a great idea though.

Excellent recipe!  The kids liked it. I think greasing the bottom of the pan would be better as mine stuck to the bottom of the pan.  I took the recommendation of 6 egs vs 5 and used sausage instead of ham (more brekfast like).  Will make this for supper one night and use ground chicken or ground ham.  Used a Tex Mex blend of cheese to add more Mexican flavour to it.

This was really good. I was lazy and did not start the night before and it still turned out good. I'll try it correctly the next time and re-review if it yields better results. I subbed cooked spicy turkey sausage for the ham and blanched asparagus for the peppers. I made sure to make enough liquid to cover the enchiladas. They floated after pouring the liquid mixture. I just place a baking dish over it for 1/2 hour to get everything to soak and popped it in the oven. I was a little loose due to not letting it sit overnight but still tasted great. Will make again. This recipe offers many options for substitution and would probably still taste yummy.

I made this out of ham leftovers and they were great! I didn't have half and half, so I used a can of evaporated milk and water.  Plus, I used an extra egg. It was still great and no leftovers! Thanks for the recipe!

I chose this recipe for a brunch I was throwing so I prepared this dish the night before for my family. Testing purposes. Since I did it on short notice I was not able to soak it overnight. It was still very good. I substituted with sausage and used salsa instead of fresh veggies. The salsa gave it a good kick. 

My husband ate it all.

I decided to prepare it for my brunch the next day, soaking it overnight. Much better after the soaking. I still fixed it with the exchanges noted above. Everyone wanted the recipe!

I will definitely fix this again.

I love recipes like this where you can prepare them a day in advance.  My in-laws spent the weekend.  My father-in- law loves anything.  My mother-in-law is harder to please.  She had seconds of this. YEA! It was lovely with a nice fruit platter, and roasted baby potatoes, and those yummy cream filled puffs you can get at Sam's Club. Set the table with a pretty table cloth and you have a classy brunch.

I really did not enjoy this recipe. The texture was more of a custard. This is due to the fact that 5 eggs are all that are used. I was expecting it to be more of an egg bake i guess. i will not make this again.

This recipe was a big hit at a brunch I recently hosted. I took some of the advice others posted about covering with aluminum foil while baking. I also chunked the ham instead of finely chopping and added red peppers as well. It was very flavorful and filling and everyone wanted the recipe afterwards which is the ultimate test on whether or not they really loved it!

I cooked this for my 3 guys (dad, husband and 4 year old son) and they all liked it. My dad wanted more green onions and my husband less, but other than that they thought it was good. Now I did leave out the bell pepper and hot sauce since we don't like either and I substituted the garlic powder with garlic salt because we like our food a little more salty. I scaled the recipe to servings for 6, and everything worked out except there wasn't enough egg mixture.  I think when I make this again, I will either make the sugg. serving, or make 6 again and use the egg mixture amount for 10 servings. All and all, it went over well.  And VERY filling.

This is an excellent recipe.  I don't eat ham, so I substituted lump crab meat and red pepper for the ham and green pepper.  It was yummy.  I did make 5 tortillas with the ham mixture (per recipe) and it got rave reviews.  It is more filling than expected, it easily served five of us with leftovers.  Fabulous!

This is the perfect recipe for using leftover ham.  I made this for dinner with a salad on the side.  Everyone loved it! I didn't even let the recipe sit over night in the refrigerator as suggested - I just baked it right away. I will definately make this again - maybe even for brunch one day.  mmm...

These were tasty, even though they got a little toasty on top.  Thank goodness I checked midway through the cooking time, so I was able to cover with aluminum foil the rest of the time.  Also, because I don't do bell peppers, I diced a jalapeno instead.  We enjoyed the extra kick.

This recipe got a rave review at Christmas brunch.  I used half the amount of bell peppers and added a can of chopped green chilies, and topped with salsa and sour cream.  I also used a combination of extra sharp white cheddar and mild yellow cheddar cheese to punch up the flavor.  I will definitely make again.

Made this for Sunday brunch .  We all loved it.
I did cover it foil about half way through when it started to get brown.  I may make it alittle more spice the next time with green chili peppers.
Very good

These had a good flavor, but my tortillas got soggy on the bottom and burnt on the top. Maybe I did something wrong? Worth another try.

It turned out great! I always change things. I used 1/2 lb sausage, because that's what I had. Added in 2T of home-made taco seasoning and 2 cups hash brown potatoes. Tore up corn tortillas, put half on bottom, then sausage mixture, then other half of tortillas. I used milk because it's what I had, and 6 eggs. Pour over casserole and let sit overnight. I used an 8x11 dish and it filled it perfectly, but took 2 hours at 350 to bake. . I'll be making this again!

good and something different than your basic egg caserole.  I would suggest puting foil on the top though cuz when the cheese cooks and gets hard, it's hard to cut through and eat when it's crunchy on top.

I made these for breakfast at church.  I added some store bought hashbrowns.  They were ok, next time I will skip the potatoes.  They made the enchiladas a little dry.  But everyone loved the new take on a breakfast casserole.

I don't know what happened. The taste was good, I followed the directions, but they were so dry, the tops were crisp, and there was no liquid at all. The egg had formed a thin crst in the bottom.

Very good.  I cut the recipe in half, but added a bit more milk and one more egg so that I had enough sauce to cover tortilla's. I covered with foil for the first 50 minutes then added cheese and baked another few minutes. It was very good...thanks

Easy, not bad for taste, & better than most breakfast brunch ideas that use bread. We did use Italian sausage instead because we like spice. Propbably will a few more dashes of the hot pepper sauce. Will make again.

Made it for the first time, it surely could use some zipping up.  will put some salsa in filling, along with cummin and hot sause, it really was quite bland but they have realy possiblities.  The guest loved them, but what do they know in Michigan.  Will zip it up when I take it to Arizona in the winter.

This was something different and was even better heated up in the microwave!  I used ham that was diced in little pieces and added an extra 2 eggs.  I'll be making this again.

This was excellent.  I used my own recipe for taco meat(ground beef) instead of the ham.  I refrigerated overnight and turned the enchiladas over so that the soaked part was up before I cooked them.  I will definitely make these again.

We have breakfast Friday's where I work in which a group of us alternate the responsibility.  I always make something instead of buying it, and so I made this for our breakfast today and received rave reviews!  I cooked & sausage instead of the ham and omitted the onion and used onion flakes.  I also used red and green pepper for a little more color.  I also provided heated salsa as a topper.

I agreed with some other reviews- this is bland.  I'm not a big sausage fan, so I wouldn't do it with sausage.  In order to have any flavor, you must add the salsa & sour cream.

Made both the ham and the sausage enchiladas for New Years brunch.  I baked without covering and the tops got hard.  The filling was good, I added some cumen, cilantro and chili powder  The egg mixture cooked around the enchiladas and the texture of the egg mixture was pretty nauseating.  I served it with sour cream, salsa and guacamole.  The sausage ones were better.  I put in some refried beans, the sausage mixture  and then the cheese.   Next time I make something like this I will scramble the eggs and put them into the tortila and cover with a cheese sauce.  I will not make this recipe again.

VERY GOOD & ONLY MADE SLIGHT MODIFICATIONS : NO GREEN PEPPER, ADDED SEASON SALT & CAYENNE PEPPER, AND MORE HOT PEPPER SAUCE.  ALSO USED WHOLE GRAIN INSTEAD OF WHITE FLOUR TORTILLAS (BETTER FOR YOU & MORE CHEWY INSTEAD OF MUSHY).  VERY GOOD & EASY.  WILL MAKE AGAIN.

This is so YUMMY, this is always requested whenever we have over-night gatherings with our group of friends, whoever wakes up first throws it in the oven & we have a feast, we usually serve with sour cream & salsa. I do however combine the cheese with the other filling ingredients, much easier & time saving!

This was an easy recipe and came out great. A good way to use up the scraps left from a whole ham. I really liked that you can do all the work the night before. I took it to a church group,it was all gone. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is so awesome! I am the food service manager for a school district and also cater on the side. I have made this for school and for several catering events. Everyone raves about it-including me! It is SO good! It does take substantial prep beforehand, but it is worth it!

I have made this twice for our Sunday School class... once with ham and once with sausage.  Both got rave reviews, although I preferred sausage.  Definitely cover them with foil until the last few minutes, and remember that it makes ALOT.  I doubled the recipe (it's a big class!) and it made 24 large enchiladas, that filled 3 large pans, plus I had 2-3 cups of ham mixture left over!  Very yummy brunch and smells WONDERFUL while cooking!

I'm surprised, due to all the great reviews this recipe got, that I found this dish so unappealing(and i am not a fussy eater) I made the recipe exactly as called for and found it bland.Maybe i should have used some of the suggestions from other reviewers and would have gotten better results, either way I'm not trying this recipe again.

I made this for the Friday office breakfast where I work and everyone loved it. I used sausage instead of ham and served it with sour cream and salsa. Very good and very easy to make.

This recipe was truly great and a huge hit at my Easter brunch.  I added ortega chilis and a lot more hot sauce than the recipe called for, which gave it a nice strong flavor.  I was a little skeptical about the ground up ham, but it worked out really nicely.  Will definitely make again, as my husband can't stop eating it!!

Very easy!  I used ground chicken breakfast sausage instead of the ham and they were great.  Next time I will add a couple more ingredients to make them spicier.

Big hit for brunch.  I covered it for the first half hour and let it brown for the remainder of the cooking time.  Topped it with cheese for the last 10 min of cooking time.  Also topped it with salsa just before serving.  GREAT

We made this for Easter brunch and it was well received. They got all ate up and everyone oohed and ahhed and said yummy for my tummy. It is a must to cook these covered. The top of the tortillas will get a little browned and crispy but this is just right! I did half pepper jack and half cheddar for extra bite. Had some leftover filling and used that to make quesadillas later on.

Very good.   Made almost twice what I thought, but then I only could find 5-6" tortillas.  Cooked it 3/4 of the time with foil on, then removed at the end.  Will play with the inner ingredients a little more next time.

I make this every Christmas morning for breakfast.  It is a nice flavour change from your regular "run of the mill" bacon, eggs or pancakes.  My family enjoys this with a dollop of sour cream, and salsa.   Yummy

Very enjoyable for everyone at the brunch.  Easy to prepare, and love to make it ahead of time.  I will "play" around with the ingredients to make one that is "my own".  Thanks for a great idea.

I really didn't care for this recipe.  I think it had too much cream and not enough eggs.  We did use ham but you might want to try sausage.  Jessie

I made this for Christmas brunch and everyone loved them.  Very tasty and even my daughter, who doesn't care for ham enjoyed them.  This is a keeper! I now make them with taco cheese, green chilies, and turkey sausage making sure they are covered throughout the entire baking time...I use a 9x13 baking stone that ensures a perfect outcome every time  :)

I did not have overnight to chill the enchiladas so they chilled for about 2 hours and still turned out good.  I think next time I will try bacon instead  of ham.

As written this is just ok, but with a few changes it's pretty great and gets rave reviews- definitely changes it to 5 stars!  I chop the ham rather than putting it in the food processor.  I omit the bell pepper.  I reduce the  half and half to 1 3/4 cups, omit the milk, and add 1 cup of green chiles, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp cayenne, to the egg mixture.  Everyone LOVED it!

We loved it. I hate to say this but I substituted sauted  sausage meat for the ham. I hate it when people  change ingredients . I used jalipeno/cheese flavored tortillas. I served it with 'mild' salsa and sour cream on top. I put tobascco on mine to add a little 'zip'

TEN stars if possible. I made things easier as I used an aluminum tin and layered the corn tortillas, not rolled. Layering worked just great. Even though I well greased the pan, some of the enchiladas cemented themselves to the bottom.  I, too, like some other reviewers added a small can of green chilies. I will use 2% milk the next time as this was a bit rich. Outstanding recipe and my previous casserole recipe is thrown out! Thanks so much for a fantastic meal, DBLUNCK. **Also good using breakfast sausage and a can of Ortega diced chilies - but I prefer the original. So. darn. good.

I made this for Easter. It was a huge hit! I used a pound of Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage instead of the ham. I also used a red and green pepper. It was fantastic! I served it with sour cream and black olives! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I followed the directions exactly and i think it came out bland. Needs some spice and also didn't care for the texture of the ground ham. If i make this again i will leave the ham cubed, add either sausage, bacon or maybe both. I will be adding minced garlic, chopped red onion and some Hatch green chiles! Also will be serving with sour cream and salsa.

After reading some of the reviews I made a few changes and this dish was wonderful!  I put one additional egg to make sure that the tortillas were covered.  They weren't totally covered with the egg/cream mixture but were in pretty deep.  I cooked them with foil until the last ten minutes when I added cheese on top.  Since there were vegetarians at the event I was going to, I filled the enchiladas with a mixture of carmelized onions, thawed frozen country hash browns and grated cheddar cheese.  I used flour tortillas.  They were fantastic.  They disappeared from the buffet table.  They were easy and tasted incredible.

These things turned out burnt on top and hard as rocks. The egg, milk, flour mixture acts like concrete mix and causes the tortillas to turn into little white boulders.

I've made this dish several times, prepping it a day before going on a road trip vacation.  Everyone always asks me to bring it the next time.  It's quite easy to make and nice that you can prepare it ahead of time and then just throw it in the oven the day you want to eat it.

I loved this recipe. I don't' care for ham, so I used ground breakfast sausage. I also threw in some southwest breakfast potatoes. I used corn tortillas because they aren't as filling as flour, I love these things! I topped them off with deseeded and minced jalapenos. Make sure you cover all the tortillas or they will get hard while baking. So good!!! Instead of putting the corn tortillas in hot oil to soften, you can run them in simmering chicken broth.

It is hard to rate this recipe as I used it only for the idea and guide.  I fried 4 slices of bacon almost done then added onions to pan after some time added canned potatoes(diced),diced ham and some mushrooms then 1 can green chilies. scrabbled 7 eggs with milk and cheese and some taco seasoning poured over all this and cooked till eggs were set.  I used the (as someone suggested)recipe for 10 minute enchilada sauce. used reg flour it worked fine.  put a TLB of sauce on tortilla, egg filling ,grated cheese ,top of spring onions chopped  and baked as directed.  Now this was some mighty fine eating.  I would have to give myself a 5 star...

Very good and I followed others advice to push down the tortillas in the egg batter several times and they came out soft.  I did tweak to my liking but a great basic recipe; thanks for sharing.  I added 2 Tbsp. Dijon-mustard to the ham filling which was a nice addition for me otherwise made as is and was excellent.

My Family loves this recipe.  I use red pepers and chop them fine in the food processor so the kids can't pick them out.  I also add black olives and use peper jack cheese.  We garnish with a little salsa, and everyone loves them including my 7 and 9 YO boys.

This was quite tasty!  Everyone really liked it and it was a great dish to make in advance.  Other than using sausage instead of ham I followed the recipe exactly.  I will make this one again.

This was very good.  I would suggest flour tortillas for ease.  Corn are harder to handle, they don't want to stay rolled.

Absolutely delicious!  The only thing I changed was to make extra egg batter so that the tops of the tortillas were covered (as suggested by previous reviews).  I can't wait to make this for breakfast the next time we have out of town guests.

Just made this recipe for a brunch.  I followed the recipe exactly but did put foil over to bake.  It needed over 60 minutes to become firm.  Everyone loved it!  I will definitely make this again. Judi

These were good... a little bland- though I did use a mix of hot and sage sausage and added tons of veggies.  Admittedly I forgot to put in the flour, which is why I'm hoping they were so runny and there was so much extra liquid.  I think next time I will omit the milk, be sure to add the flour and spice up the sausage mix a little more.  Good overall.  Everyone seemed to like them.

Didn't use a food processor, just copped the ham up really fine. Added mushrooms.
I didn't have seven-inch tortillas, so I used four ten-inch (all I had) instead. Still turned out fantastic, and we two meals out of it. Ate these with salsa and sour cream. Yummy!!!

I made this recipe exactly as described and was really hoping to find a new menu item for my family. We found it very bland. Doctor it up with seasonings and it might be passable. Next time, I'll leave out the taco wraps and soup. Ingredients otherwise make an excellent ommelete.

This was so good. I will be making this again. I used sausage instead of the ham, and forgot to add my green onions, so I sprinkeled them ontop, before I baked them. Made this fir my mother-in-law for Mothers Day, and it was a HUGE hit. Next time, Ill try chorizo, for a little more flavor, and spice.

This was very tasty. A nice twist on the regular brunch casserrole. Mine was a little salty- I'll use a different kind of ham next time.

These were excellent, even though I goofed and could only refrigerate them for 1 hr.  Used kielbasa that I diced and pre-fried so that I could drain and blot out the grease (even though they were fully cooked in the package) before I mixed it with the veggies.  Since the sausage is very salty, next time I would cut back on it, add more veggies, and use Monterey Jack  instead of cheddar cheese.  I subbed a little chopped Poblano for some of the green bell pepper, and added quite a bit of hot red pepper sauce to the egg mixture.  It was very tasty, but a little salty.  Enjoy.  Can't wait to make these the right way!!!

i gave this 4 stars only because I made one change in the recipe.  otherwise I would have given it 2 stars.  The only thing I changed was jimmy dean sausage for the ham. My husband and I did NOT like this very much.  It was extremely bland and in need of a lot of additional toppings, such as sour cream, salsa, etc.

Really good brunch dish! My family enjoyed it for Christmas breakfast. We ended up just dicing the ham instead of grinding it.  These are more filling than you expect, very hearty!  I didn't have the problem of some previous reviewers of the eggs baking up and covering the tortillas...in fact, my tortillas were getting brown before the eggs completely set...but it still turned out very tasty.

This was a huge hit.  It made 6 large enchiladas and 4 men ate it all in one sitting (my husband shared it with his co-workers).  After reading some of the other posts I knew I needed to add some kick to it so I included 1/3 cup of chopped jalapeno peppes to the ham mixture and added about 6-8 drops of hot sauce to the egg mixture.  They all loved it and its the first time I've had men asking me for a recipe.  Next time I will try sausage instead of ham.

I did not make the enchiladas the night before.  I used sausage instead of ham, omitted the milk, used wheat tortillas, and added lots of garlic.  I topped them with salsa, sour cream, and avacado.  They were great!

These surprised me and were actually very good.  The portions are too large so I'll probably use smaller tortilla's next time.  They made for a very good brunch with a tomato grits recipe and fruit.

This was a very easy recipe and looked very nice.  I also made this for my daughter's confirmation brunch and it was a hit. I substituted sausage for the ham as I alread had a dish with ham.  I also doubled the green chilies.  I used two cans.  It was rich with the sausage, but was very good.

I read the reviews and made some changes. I added a 6th egg, used yellow instead of green pepper and substituted sausage for the ham. Everyone loved it. Being able to make it the night before is a great time saver.

Everyone loved it. I used ground breakfast sausage instead of ham. I browned the sausage with red bell pepper and the green onions. The ham would be good too but ground sausage was easier.  Next time I plan to use the ham.

I don't have a food processor so just used shaved ham. No hot sauce, as kids would be eating it. I tried to roll the tortillas tightly, but the liquid didn't completely cover them, which I read in other reviews was a problem with no solution. I had to bake them 70 minutes until they were set. The end result was okay, but kinda plain and I would've preferred something else. I brought it to a potluck that had 20 attendees and I took half of it home, so it was a mediocre sell there as well. would skip it.

Excellent, even in spite of the fact that I decided to make it last minute so the eggs did not soak the enchiladas overnight. I also left my ham in strips and chunks so as not to wake sleeping family members by using the food processor. Very tasty!

Loved this recipe and will definitely make it again. The only change made was that we only used 4 flour tacos to put the ham filling in. 

Thinking about adding black beans into the food processor with the ham next time.

This was ok.  I made it as listed with the exception of cutting it in half for the two of us, but I think it would have better with corn tortillas.  I think I'll stick Huevos Rancheros.

I LOVED these enchiladas, served with AR Pico de Gallo, sour cream and avocado. Halved the recipe for the two of us.I substituted a blackened poblano for the green bell pepper as that's what I had on hand. Delicious! Added 1 teaspoon ground cumin and doubled the garlic powder and hot sauce. We like a lot of flavor and these did not disappoint! My husband isn't too keen on breakfast foods for dinner, but I loved them. He can eat the leftovers for breakfast!

We didn't have ham, so used breakfast sausage instead. We liked how the tortillas were a little crisp on the top. We felt it needed salt and pepper and perhaps some kind of cheesy sauce or salsa would be a nice addition. Would be great with pico de gallo.

Everyone liked it. I think that the next time I'll make it, I'll leave the ham cubed.

I'm not giving a recipe review.  Only want to comment on the fact that the nutrition data won't show.  Please correct as this is important to a lot of us.  Thanks

read definition for enchilada.  this is not close.  This is flour and egg casserole.  Try corn tortillas softened in enchilada sauce. add scrambled eggs to ham mixture, roll and cover with sauce and cheese.  Sort of like real breakfast enchiladas ;)

Delicious! I made it for supper and did not refrigerate it overnight. I had to cover them after about 10 minutes t o keep them from burning on the top.

I made this with chorizo instead of the ham.  I just wanted more spice.  It was AWESOME!!!  Huge hit at Christmas brunch.

I used fresh chives instead of onions,and used black forest ham.I didn't think it had very much flavor. It was actually better the second day.  Haven't decided if I will make it again.

I liked the enchilada ingredients but didn't care for the baked eggs. It all seemed rather dry; I topped with salsa but that didn't go with the ham as much as I would have liked.  I wouldn't make it again.

Great recipe for something different  to make for brunch. I didn't mince my ham,cut it in tiny cubes and added small dice peppers, cumin, lime juice, jalapeños, and cilantro the ham mixture. I also blended the egg mixture really well and added about a tablespoon of cholula as well as salt and pepper and some cheese.  I would advice the addition of foil about half through the baking time. That was increased to about an hour and ten minutes, just to make sure all the egg cooked through. Would definitely  make it again.

Our guests really enjoyed this and we liked it, too, though I can't say for certain I'd make it again.  I didn't love the texture of the tortillas.  I appreciate that it's makeaheadable and was quite easy to throw together. I served it w/sour cream and salsa, which were a nice accompaniment.  THANKS for the recipe, DBLUNCK!

These were a very nice change from our usual breakfast items! You could easily use this recipe as a base & add different meats, peppers, etc. I did add a little salsa inside each enchilada.

I didn't have overnight to let it sit, so popped it into the oven after 2 hours, but it was good.  Ham is a bit weird for me in a burrito, and we ate it for dinner, which probably made a difference.  It was really good, but I think next time I'll try it with pork or chicken, add sliced olives and green chili's.  It is a keeper, and easy.

I wasn't very impressed with the recipe.  I felt that there was too much ham mixture and not enough flour tortillas.  I also don't understand why it says to use 7" tortillas.  I think if I try this next time I will use larger tortillas to make use of all the ham/onion mixture.  The egg mixture did not cover the tortilla completely and the tops them got "crunchy" after cooking.  I will be altering the recipe a bit next time.
