I have never rated a recipe before but I just had to rate this one. To me it is one of the best meals I ever made.

This is one I will never do again! Even my husband who eats every thing in sight, said it was a waste of sea food.

Very good! I didn't use scallops though and used extra shrimp and imit. crab  instead.  Even my picky eater husband enjoyed this dish.  This dish is not too kid friendly though because of the strong seafood flavor, but the adults loved it.

This was pretty good.  I doubled the recipe for a larger group but I would have left out two packages of noodles.  It just ended up being a lot of noodles for the seafood.  But an overall crowd pleaser.
