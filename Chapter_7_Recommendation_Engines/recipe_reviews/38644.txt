This is an excellent side!  The only thing I disagree with is the chilling part.  It is so good at room temp!  Thanks!

I have made this recipe twice. The first time I made it was for a tex-mex potluck, so I changed it a bit: substituted brown rice for white rice, used frozen corn in place of fresh, used lime juice instead of lemon, used canned mexican-style diced tomatoes in place of fresh, used only about half the dressing, subbed cilantro for the basil, and roasted the purple onions with the corn.  I think we may have added some homemade salsa and crushed red pepper also. But it was absolutely amazing!!! Just about a different recipe. 
The second time I made it, I followed the recipe. It was ok, still too much oil and too much dressing overall, and used brown rice and frozen corn again. Pretty good, but not as good.

I stuck pretty exactly to the recipe and took for a picnic with cold meat and it was raved about (spring breakers!) - very refreshing.

This makes a HUGE salad. Way more than 8 servings. I served twenty people and still had tons left-over. I cheated and used the one pound bag of roasted corn from Trader Joe's. Super easy that way and it has great flavor. Probably better than I could do myself. I didn't use the red onion because I was already serving another salad that had it in there. And I did swap out fresh tomato for sundried julienne strips, because when they are out of season, I don't think they are worth the price. I would recommend olive oil over corn oil. I had to double the basil in order to get the flavor to come through. Could probably use a little more spices. Kind of bland for me.

This is a great and refreshing side, and very easy to prepare!  The corn adds fantastic flavor when paired with the rice, tomato and onion.  Having followed the recipe to the letter, I think next time I'll use a little less oil in the dressing itself, but overall a really interesting and tasty dish!

This is a great basic recipe that makes TONS...just modify to your taste.  I even added sour cream to make it a creamy base once, and added red peppers and other veggies on hand to suit our taste.  If you follow this recipe, you better want alot of salad.

This was very good, but it made a ton of food (you'll really need a LARGE bowl for this), and it lasted me for almost a week. The Woman I Love tried some of the leftovers, and she liked it a lot too.
This recipe represented two "firsts" for me: I'd never cooked with basmati rice before; and I'd never cut corn off the cob before (which was tedious and messy the first time, but I'll do better next time!). I followed the recipe to the letter. One funny thing, though. The corn never got "lightly browned". I kept adding 5 minutes at a time to the original 15 minutes. I finally gave up at 35 minutes - the corn was cooked, no doubt, but still not browned that I could see. I wonder why that was?
All in all, this was a great recipe. It takes a bit of time to make (I don't enjoy peeling, seeding and dicing tomatoes), but the final result is very tasty and will go a long way (I found that the "8 servings" amounts to 8 pretty full plates of the stuff).

Made this tonight to go with our steak tips and it was delicious. Very refreshing. I used Jasmine rice, since that was what I had on hand. I happened to have some roasted almond slivers which I tossed in just before serving...yum!

I didn't use as much vinegar, or oil because I ended up not having quite enough (about half of what I needed), and I didn't have enough time to fully chill it, but it turned out fantastic! I think it might be too vinegary if you use as much (but I'm not positive). The dish was very pretty and vibrant, and I served it with tomatoes and scallions and rack of lamb with Beaujolais honey sauce and it went very well! I also though it tasted better room temp. as opposed to chilled. I'm for sure making this one again!

Very tasty and unique. I modified this according to what was in my cupboard. Instead of corn and tomatoes, I added bellpepper, walnuts and cranberries and some red onion. I also used olive oil in place of corn oil. I look forward to using corn and tomatoes on next try.

I really liked this recipe.  Made a couple of changes, lessened the oil, added roasted peanuts and I did the corn in a frying pan on the stove.  Worked great and tasy. thanks

Well received by many. I made it for a pot luck at work, doubling the recipe, and only heard positive comments. 

I found the recipe called for a bit too much oil.  I also added a bit of cumin to add a little more flavour that wasn't acidic.

I was excited to try this after all of the great reviews I read, but it just didn't work for us.  I followed the recipe as written, but it was way too tart, and it made quite a bit more than 8 servings.  My husband couldn't finish his and I'm not looking forward to eating the leftovers, but I hate to throw away all that food after all of the time and effort put into it.  Sadly, I won't be making this again.

AMAZING... and thats just trying it warm. I couldn't wait to see what everyone was raving about and boy were they right! I DID make one change. I was out of red wine vinegar so I substituted 1/2 white wine vinegar and 1/2 champagne vinegar and it was perfect!

I found this rice too sweet, however my husband loved it. Next time I would use less red wine vinegar.

for folks who think a recipe makes to much there is a option you know to change the amt to feed.?  It is at the top of the recipe and you change it from 8 to four services and it automatically changes the portions used.
