Very good and much easier than messing with lasagna noodles. The whole family asked me to put this in the rotation. I used double the noodles and mozzarella cheese. I also used cottage cheese instead of ricotta. I also added a little more sauce. I layered pasta/cheese mix/sauce/pasta/cheese mix/sauce/pasta/sauce/mozz cheese.

made this for a crowd and it was a hit!  Trick is to prepare the night before and refrigerate so flavors blend.  I also sprinkle each layer with garlic powder. Delicious!

I love this recipe. It is one of my go-to meals during the week. It has the same great taste as lasagna but you don't have to mess with the difficult lasagna noodles. I up the meat and pasta to a pound each, add a little more sauce and mozzarella and cook it in a 13X9 pan. Delicious!!

This was a good recipe~  was looking for a "lasagna" recipe,but wanted to use penne pasta instead, since it is what I had on hand. These are the additions and changes that I made (only to suit our taste on experience/ not because of any possible flawsn seen in your recipe). I added 2 tablespoons of the zesty dry italian seasoning to the meat, as well as fresh sliced mushrooms, while it browned.... and then fresh sliced zucchini. I mixed some of the pasta sauce with the noodles (3/4 lb) of penne, laid it at bottom of baking pan.  I then spread the ricotta mixture on top of that, put remaining meat sauce as next layer, and lastly the mozzarella with a few shakes of parmesean .

Very easy and good I would recommend  covering with foil before putting in oven so your noddles don't end up crunchy I also used 1 pound of ground beef I felt like it needed more sauce though.

Really good and easy. I added about 1/3 c. chopped onion and a clove of minced garlic with the ground beef for extra flavor. Also covered with foil before baking as others suggested to keep moisture in. Thanks for sharing.

Recipe needs a lot more flavor (oregano, parsley, basil, cayenne pepper flakes), unless, of course, those ingredients are included in the sauce you use. In addition, I usually add cook at least 1/2 lb. Sweet Italian Sausage (casings removed) along with my chopped beef. For easier "layering", I'd suggest using Rigatoni pasta in place of the Penne. Just a personal preference.

Delicious!  This is a new family favorite!!  I do not have a 2.5 qt (approx 11x7) baking dish, so I increased the amount of penne to 1 lb, and ground beef to 1 lb to make it fit into a 13x9 pan.

With a little 'tweeking' this would rate 5 stars.
I used 8 oz pasta.  A full pound of hamburg and 1 and 1/2 jars of Paul Newmans Sockarooni. Also for the topping mixed the remaining mozzarella with another 1/4 cup parmesan.
A real 'keeper' this way.  It got rave reviews!

Try adding a 10 oz box of frozen spinach, thawed and drained, in the middle.  It boosts the nutrition, adds color, and tastes great!

Just what I was looking for.  The first time I made this it was as written.  The second time I added one and half teaspoons of Italien seasoning and used half cottage cheese with the ricotta because I didn't have enough ricotta.  Wonderful.  Thank you for this great recipe.

Made this and it was just OK. I cheated first off and used left over home made sauce and when making the meat- I added oregano, garlic salt, pepper and ramano cheese. The over all taste was lacking - there was not enough ewwwy gooey goodness to the cheese that a lasagna dish should have... and the cheese combo as written lacked flavor. I ended up adding hot sauce to my portion, just to flavor it up. I may give this recipe a makeover and try again but, not a GREAT recipe on its own, as I had hoped.

This was so delicious!  I used low-fat cottage cheese in place of the ricotta just because it was on sale, but it was so good this way!  I also browned a whole lb. of ground turkey and used all of it because I forgot that I was supposed to only use 1/2 lb!  I also used rotini instead of penne just because I like how the rotini holds sauce so well.  Everything came together wonderfully.  Even my lasagna-loving boyfriend commented on how tasty it was.  We will definitely be making this again very soon!  Thank you for a great alternative to plain ol' pasta!

My family LOVED this!  I added crushed red pepper seasoning, minced garic & Italian seasoning after draining ground beef.  I almost always double the cheese :) (use skim mozzarella!).  This is so much easier than using lasagna noodles & just as tasty.  I also used cottage cheese instead of ricotta & my picky husband didn't even notice!

Good recipe,  However too much ricotta and not enough mozzarella. Next time I will use half the ricotta and toss an extra cup of mozzarella on top.

I love it when people rate the recipe with 4 or 5 stars after they've made changes to the original recipe! People, you are not reviewing the original recipe; you are reviewing your own recipe!!! Please stick to the original recipe when making reviews, then suggest changes!

NOTICE: To All Who Have Gluten Intolerance!!   Wow, this is great!  "Lasagna" is off-limits to us because is out of the question, HOWEVER, I just bought some rice penne and it worked beautifully.  Ahhh, the pleasures of Italian dishes returns.........

Good and easy.  I used leftover homemade meat sauce and replaced the ricotta with cottage cheese.   I also upped the mozzarella cheese a bit.

This is delicious! Im giving 4 stars because I had to make a couple of changes. First off, I added the tin foil on top so that it kept moisture in like others said. Then I removed the tin foil when there was 10 minutes left. I baked it for less time, and I wish I had baked it longer but thats my fault. I used cheddar instead because of the flavor and whole milk ricotta. I added salt and oregano (dried) to the ground beef. NOW- It was super hard to layer! The half a lb of noodles was NOT enough AND i used a smaller dish. Using the mixture on top of the noodles and sauce was hard to layer without messing it up, mine also did not cut like "lasagna" like others said. But I loved the flavor and the combination. A keeper for sure. ALSO if you like more meat add a pound instead of 1/2.

My family loved it! I used cottage cheese, homemade spaghetti sauce, and pasta bows -- doubled the pasta & meat, added extra sauce, to accommodate their adjustment. Made a TON and was great leftovers.

Great alternative to lasagna!  Much easier to prepare.  The only thing I would change the next time I make it, spice up the meat with garlic, oregano, basil, etc.  It was too bland.  I thought using a pasta sauce with garlic and herbs would suffice but it wasn't enough for my taste.

I made my own sauce so it was plenty flavorful with the onions, garlic, other veggies that I always use (mushrooms, zucchini, carrots etc...) in homemade pasta sauce. I made it all in the morning, covered and placed in the fridge.  Took it out of fridge to take the chill off for 20 minutes or so and baked covered for 35 minutes; removed cover and threw on some fresh mozzerella and cooked for 5 minutes or so.  PERFECT!  Topped with fresh basil for color. Served with an Italian style salad with  Basil Vinaigrette Dressing (by Neerondogs) from this site and homemade garlic bread.

Even my picky 3 yr old asked for seconds!  I made some adjustments.  Added an extra egg.  Some dashes of Oregano and half an onion (diced) on the browning meat. Used 1 lb shell pasta (that's what I had), and 1 1/2 lbs ground beef.  yummy!

I would give this 5 stars if the original recipe called for cottage cheese.  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  It came out soo good and yummy!!  The family loved it!  Don't bother making if you use the ricotta cheese.

This was an easy and yummy recipe.  I used 1lb italian sausage instead of ground beef.  I also used whole wheat penne and fresh basil.  On top, I used fresh mozzerella as well as shredded. Very simple.   I will make this again.

This was certainly cheesy enough & very tasty.  I used the pasta that cooks in 3 minutes & think that having baked it for 30 minutes might be why the noodles didn't hold up as well as I'd hoped but it was still a great meal.  And plenty of leftovers for a couple lunches.

I made about half this recipe (half an egg = 2 T. beaten egg), but I doubled the meat and used hot Italian sausage instead of ground beef.  I also subbed cottage cheese for the ricotta.  This is a good, solid recipe that’s easy and tasty.   I wish now I had thought to add some fresh basil.  You could just sprinkle it on as you’re layering it.  My half recipe would easily feed 3-4 people.  I served this with a salad and garlic bread.

This is an excellent recipe. I did alter it a bit. I added 4 cloves of garlic, 1 small onion diced, and 1/2 green pepper, diced. It is well worth 5 stars.

Great base recipe. I was looking for an idea for leftover spagetti sauce I had in fridge I needed to use up. This recipe was perfect! I made a few changes only because it was what I had on hand. For starters I already had the sauce W/meat,mushrooms, bell pepper,onion   and seasonings a time saver the only other changes I made were I used (rigatoni pasta, parsley and cottage cheese to cheese mixture Topped with mozzarella,chopped green onion and black olives.Yummmm,Yummmm Thank you.

It's a good idea..it just wasn't very flavorful..The ricotta cheese mixture needs more seasoning...and there needs to be more than a 1/2 lb of noodles.

Excellent!  I added garlic salt, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning to the ricotta mixture just to spice it up a bit, and then chopped some fresh tomatoes and tossed them into the sauce mixture.  This was a pretty, tasty dish that reminded me a lot of an all-out lasagna, but with less work.

It is very easy to make.  But it is missing a lot of flavor if made "as written".  If I were making this again, I'd cook 1/2 pound of italian sausage, onion, and garlic with the ground beef.  Then, stir in some Italian seasonings with the cheese mixture.

This was very good and relatively easy.  I do agree with some of the other reviews that said it needed a little more flavor.  I would try adding a little garlic and onion to your ground beef when browning.  Other than that, it's a great recipe!

This was awesome! Only reason i give it four stars and not five is because i did make a couple changes. For one, there's not enough meat/sauce in the original recipe (not for my taste anyway). I also added a couple things.  Changes are as follows: 1 pound of ground beef and a large can of four cheese pasta sauce (thick and rich). I also put a can of mushrooms in the meat (we really like mushrooms) and 1 tsp thyme, 1/2 tsp garlic salt, 1/2 tsp onion salt.  I put a little garlic and pepper in the cheese mixture as well.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan so i didn't have enough to make two layers... but boy it's delish!

I just made this last night for dinner and LOVED it.  It was easy to make.  I loved not having to hassle with lasagna noodles.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was wonderful and doesn't need any modifications.  If you like lasagna but hate the hassle of the lasagna noodles, you should try this.

I love this!  Penne instead of lasagna noodles is so much better and kid friendly.   I used alot of Itlian blend cheese instead of just mozzerella - try it you'll love it.

This is a pretty good basic recipe.  I took the advice from other reviewers and added a pound of ground beef that I browned with onions and garlic.  I added only half the ricotta mixture and used a shredded mozzarella/provolone mixture, also.  I also used 2 jars of highly-flavored pasta sauce and whole-wheat rotini pasta.  My family and I did enjoy it made like this, and it's certainly easier than regular lasagna, but we prefer the traditional.

This a great Base Recipe to make your own.  It is easily customiseable to suit your own tastes.  More meat, less meat.  More pasta and sauce to meet the needs of a larger family.  Personally, I added garlic, onions, green pepper and mushrooms.  Added Herbes de Provence and red pepper flakes for more flavor and zing.  More mozzarella.  It is a great recipe.

I have been making this dish for over 20 years with penne instead of lasagna noodles and it is always a HUGE hit! Another option is to use REGULAR lasagna noodles UNCOOKED and just layer as you normally would - add about 1/2 cup of water to your sauce, cover with foil and bake for about 50-60 minutes... all the pleasures of lasagna without dealing with hot noodles!

Mmmm, this is so good.  I put some sauce on the bottom of dish (9 x 13) to just cover and I also mixed the sauce (homemade from this site "Homemade Tomato Sauce I") into the pasta instead of the ground beef.  If you don't want this to dry out and have a crunchy top then cover with foil while baking.  This is a keeper.  Thx.

A good concept, but needed more herbs.  Next time I'll add some basil and oregano, maybe a little garlie and fennel seed.

I only give this recipe 4 stars because of all the changes I made. Here are the changes I made: added 1 can of tomato soup for thickness and sweetness, used a pasta sauce with ground sausage included, added one small yellow onion and 1 clove of garlic to the ground beef, added a pinch of each of the following to the ground beef: dried basil, oregeno, fennel and red pepper flake. I left out the ricotta as I didn't have it on hand and substituted extra mozza and some extra old white cheddar. It was delish!!

My son-in-law said this was one of my best casseroles ever, so that really says something!  Based on recommendations, I increased all the ingredients except the cheeses and egg. I added a finely chopped onion and some chopped pepperoni while frying the ground beef.  I also added a heaping tablespoon of dried parsley to the ricotta mixture and some ground pepper.  Baked it for 25 mins. covered with foil and then uncovered for another 15 mins.  I used a box of three-colored rotini, instead of the penne, and the corkscrews held the sauce & cheeses beautifully. NOTE:  Make sure that your pasta is slightly undercooked before assembling--I even rinsed it in cold water to stop the cooking process.  Will definitely be making this again soon!

Pretty darn good.  Not exactly "lasagna" but close enough.  Maybe next time I'll add more flavor (like sausage mixed with the beef...).

I made this the other night and it was good.  Personally, I thought the pasta was too heavy or something - it was a little too thick in this recipe.  Other than that, it was quick and easy, and it tasted even better the next night.  I think I'll try a different type of pasta the next time I make this - and there will be a next time!

It was good but I accidentally added too much ricotta cheese, my fault, but it was still good, I will definitely try it again and watch my measurements.

This dish has everything in it that my favorite old fashioned receipe does. Wanted to share that they now make lasagna stripes that don't need to be boiled first just put them on the dish layer by layer straight out the box into the pan that bakes in the oven with the rest of the stuff!

Loved this recipe!  I made a few changes.  I doubled the recipe and first sauteed green peppers and onion before adding the meat.  I used one pound hamburger and one pound sweet sausage. i also used rigatoni instead of penne.  This doubled recipe would easily serve 15 people.

I've been making this now for over a year and my family loves it! It's a pretty simple recipe. The only thing that I do differently is that I add cottage cheese with the ricotta, egg, mozzerella, and parmesan to makes it a little creamier. (I do this with all my lasagna dishes)

Delicious and quick, real comfort food.  I highly recommend mixing the pasta with the meat sauce before layering.  Also, sprinkle some of the Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese on each meat layer in stead of mixing with the ricotta mixture - quicker and less messy. You can sneak some vegies in with the meat to make this more nutricious (carrots, peas, bell peppers and mushrooms work well)

Mmmm. . .no.  Way too much ricotta and much too bland.  If I made again, I'd cut the ricotta mixture in half, add some canned diced tomatoes and a LOT of seasonings.

We loved this recipe. I made it in a 9x13 pan, lined with foil. I replaced the meat with sauteed yellow squash, zucchini, green bell pepper, onion, and garlic. DH gave the recipe 4 stars, but I gave it 5. :) It was moist, super-cheesy, and tasted exactly like lasagna. To speed prep time, I cut up all my veggies the night before. Otherwise, it adds quite a bit more work to the original.

Absolutely PERFECT for someone like me. That is, someone who loves the homemade taste and feel of lasagna, but is always looking for a shortcut. Someone who doesn't have a lot of time and patience for dealing with big floppy lasagna noodles that inevitably tear. Someone who would dearly love to make sauce from scratch, but again--no time on weeknights. 

So what I did was get a jar of one of my favorite sauces: Ragu Chunky Tomato, Garlic & Onion. The veggie chunks make it seem more homemade. Also, I substituted medium shell pasta for penne--I'm not really big on hollow tube pastas.

All the ratios of meat, cheese, sauce & pasta were just to our liking too. Bravo!

FANTASTIC recipe!!!  I made it exactly as written and thought it was perfect.  Hubby wishes it had a little more sauce, but he thinks that about 80% of recipes!  I loved the ricotta mixture and think that made it an outstanding recipe, instead of mediocre.  Also, it's sooooo easy & you can even refrigerate or freeze ahead of time.  Love it, love it, love it!

I substituted the beef with chicken as there were buddhists among those I cooked for, and I used tofu instead of ricotta because I couldn't find ricotta in the supermarket I went to. Although I didn't follow the recipe amounts closely and ended up cooking too much for 3, we finished every single morsel of it! Definitely a keeper!!

This was an excellent recipe.  I made a few changes according to personal tastes, using ground turkey instead of beef and cottage cheese in place of ricotta.  I prefer the shape of rigatoni to penne pasta and it was an excellent substitute.  In addition to the cottage cheese, mozzarella and parmesan mixture I added about 1/4 cup of spinach for some color.  Personally my own tastes call for more meat and sauce, I will make those adjustments upon my next pasta lasagne.

Additionally, I took another reviewers advice and made the Great Garlic Bread from this site as well, yum.

I will be making this again and again.

Hmmm...mine needed more sauce. The pasta soaked up all the sauce. It also needs more flavor. I think I would make this again with adjustments like garlic and Italian seasonings and maybe more mozz.  I would use spaghetti next time too. I found the penne to be somewhat heavy for the dish and I think it would be easier to "spread" the layers w/the spaghetti. I also subbed sausage for ground beef b/c that's what I had in the freezer already cooked...My 10-yr old said "it's pretty good" :)  Oh PS ~ I covered mine too. Thank you!

My entire family loved this! I used half ground beef/half sausage but didn't change anything else. I will be making this again and again!

I was going to serve this for dinner but ended up serving it for lunch.  There's plenty of leftovers if we want it for dinner, that's for sure!  I thought about halving the recipe since it's just the two of us, but we love pasta dishes so I didn't, figuring we'd both eat the leftovers.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and added oregano, garlic, and basil to the mixture.  I also layered the sauce on the bottome first--helps keep it from sticking.  If you make sure the noodles are completely covered in cheese they won't get hard and you won't have to cover it.  My layering worked well since I ended up with the cottage cheese mixture on top.  Very nice.  My sauce was a bit watery but letting it sit overnight as another reviewer suggested seemed to take care of that well enough.  I served with salad and Cheese Garlic Biscuits II.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was okay with some changes, but not much easier than old fashioned lasagna, which is better anyway.  I can see how people with kids that basically only like meat and cheese would love this recipe, but it was pretty bland as-is.  Cheese mixture was too 'cheesy' with not enough flavor.  This is what it really needed - keep the ricotta or change to lowfat cottage cheese, doesn't matter.  But the cheese mixture needs a few Tbs melted butter, 1 tsp fresh garlic, salt and pepper to taste, and some oregano.  Also, more sauce.  The recipe called for one jar, leaving it dry (I know it helps it hold together - but it's just not good dry!).  The ground beef (I use extra lean) needs salt, pepper, garlic, basil, onion, and fennel to get that Italian sausage flavor without the fat, otherwise it's just MEAT.  And by the time you go through all that to make it taste really wonderful, you realize you could've just made a regular lasagna.  Thanks for the recipe, but I probably won't make again.

Great...Easy...Delicious!  Family said it was great.  Hubby thought is was 'regular' lasagna (he rolled his eyes when he saw the pan) and was pleasantly surprised to find this recipe instead. I used 1lb of beef and 16oz box of whole wheat pasta (family didn't have a clue!) and a bit more sauce.  I used a 9X13 pan (and mine was VERY full).  I would also say that if you like more garlic, spice, etc...go for it!  That is what makes this a wonderful recipe, it is VERY easy to 'make it your own'.

I make this all of the time with 1/2 lb of ground beef and 1/2 lb of Italian sausage. I always mix the penne into the ricotta mixture which keeps the pasta soft. Easy and pretty quick to make.

Good!  This is a keeper!  I was expecting a little more tomato taste, but the cheese filling kind of overpowered it.  I may cut back on the ricotta next time.  Great recipe!

Very good and easy.  I substituted Mild Italian Sausage for the hamburger.  I liked the sausage better than just using beef.

What a great idea.  I have made this several times following recipe exactly.  I do let it sit overnight in fridge to set. Family loves it.  Leftovers keep and reheat well also.

This is essentially the Baked Ziti recipe from the back of the Ronzoni pasta Ziti box.  It is always good and easy to make.  I use my own Italian meat sauce recipe with ground beef and Italian sausage and add some dried basil to the cheese mixture.  It is an easy recipe to double and mix into 2 dishes, one for tonight and one to freeze.

Delicious! I would never have thought of using penne instead of lasagna noodles but I loved it. I did use 1 lb of beef because that's what I had thawed. Thanks for sharing- we ate for days and I will make again!

Good recipe .  I used one pound of meat because that is what I had.  Before cooking the meat I added Itallian seasoning.  I used a little extra pasta sauce because I used extra meat but used the amount called for with the rest of the ingredients.  I cooked covered until the last 10 minutes as others have suggested.  Good recipe when you do not want to fool with lasagna noodles.

This recipe is so much easier than lasagna and just as yummy!  My family enjoyed it with garlic bread and salad.  We doubled the recipe and substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  My husband said it only needed mushrooms to make this a 5-star recipe!   Will definitely put this in the rotation!

This is a wonderful idea and change from the normal lasagna. Both my boys loved it and asked for seconds. I added some garlic and onion powder to the cheese mixture along with some salt and basil for extra flavor. So easy and tasty.

YUMMY RECIPE! Before tonight I had never made Lasagna before. It turned out awesome! I switched the recipe around alittle though.I used 1 lb. hamburger, about 1 lb. bag of mozz. cheese, 1 full 24oz. container of cottage cheese, 2lb large jar of Ragu original sauce,and 1 lb. mini penne noodles. I also did cover it with foil & cooked uncovered for the last 10mins. Oh & I also sprinkled 2 layers with garlic powder. mmm mmm good! I will deffinatley make again!

Just made this for dinner tonight, very simple and quick. Will make this again for sure. My boyfriend who is very picky, said I put too much on his plate, but he finished it all!! Just make sure you use a good quality pasta sauce and not Ragu/no name brand, that will definitely make a difference. I also put in onions with the ground beef and threw in some extra spices into the sauce, salt/pepper/garlic salt, oregano, and basil. Just a dash of everything. This was very tasty and prefer it over regular lasagna. Also used the suggestion from someone else to mix the pasta and the sauce before layering, made it easier to layer in baking dish. 
Don't worry if you don't smell anything from the oven while it's baking, don't let that fool you into thinking it has no taste!

I have been married for 40 years and am still challenged by all things related to the kitchen.  This recipe is perfect for someone like me.  It's easy and delicious.  I followed the recipe, but remembered the reviews of some who said there was not enough sauce.  I added an eight ounce can of tomato sauce to the pasta sauce.  That worked great.  I made it the day before and put it in the fridge.  That increased the cooking time considerably.  I finally ended up throwing it in the microwave to get it heated through.  My husband adored it and said I shouldn't change anything about it.  I can count on one hand the number of times he's said that about my cooking.  Thanks, Regan

This recipe is similar to a Baked Ziti recipe my family has enjoyed for years.  I use 8 oz of Ziti, 2 lbs ground beef/Italian sausage and 2 jars of Classico spicy red pepper.  This makes enough for great leftovers and because of the amount of sauce, it stays juicy.  For the cheese layer I use 2 cups of mozzarelle, 2 eggs and 1/2 cup of Parmesean along with the riccota. I also add, basil, origano, garlic and onion to the cheese mixture and when browning the meat.  Very flavorful with a little spice!  Great for taking to gatherings.

Easy and the kids love it!   Much better then the spaghetti lasagna.   I added mushrooms to my sauce.  Didn't have meat so left it out.  Used Cottage Cheese instead of Ricotta cheese.   Used extra cheese for top.  Left out egg.   Didn't grease pan, instead I use some sauce to keep it from sticking.

Very simple for this working mom to assemble for three very hungry boys before working the late shift. I used ground italian sausage for a change instead of ground beef, organic jarred pasta sauce that I gussied up a bit with my own personal touches, and Trim cottage cheese instead of ricotta, to save money. We really liked this--very comforting. Next time, I might add more mozzerella.

A nice 'alternative' lasagna-style meal.  Added about 1.5T of dried parsley to cheese mixture.  Used 1.25lbs of meat and almost a full pound of macaroni (no penne on hand).  The cheese mixture was so thick, just used my hands to break it up over the meat layer.  Tasty and filling.

this was really good and easy. i will definitely make it again. i used about a pound of ground turkey instead of the beef and added a little bit more marinara sauce. i also added some diced onions while the turkey was browning, as well as a bit of garlic powder and pepper. served with a green salad and garlic bread, it's a yummy weeknight dinner. thanks for sharing!

This lasagna is very easy to make and also very tasty. I fried up some onion and garlic to throw in with the pasta sauce, which I think gave an extra punch of delicious. I also broiled it for a few minutes after it was done baking - to get the cheese the way I like it.

I was debating while at work what to make for the company I was having that night and figured I would give this recently saved recipe a whirl. In a rush and juggling a hungry infant, I actually used 2x the amount of ricotta (*cottage cheese) and 1/2 the recommended amount of pasta sauce! I didn't even figure out my mistake until later that night when I was writing it out for my friend who wanted the recipe! Next time I will probably keep the amount of cheese I used on accident (yummm...) but use the correct amount of pasta sauce. It got a little dry in the fridge without. It tastes just like lasagna, but way easier to throw together. I don't even care if my husband eats these leftovers or not. More for me! :)

fantastic recipe, easy to make!  I used gluten free pasta and only had italian-flavoured cans of chopped tomatoes, and it still turned out amazing!  I covered all of the pasta with sauce/cheese so didn't have to worry about covering.

I didn't like it because I found it dry and lack of flavor. It was too heavy on the the cheese. I ended up giving the dinner away to a friend where he's a cheese lover. I like more herbs and sauce for my pasta.

Awesome, awesome, awesome!  I've always wanted to try making lasagna, but didn't want to deal with the lasagna noodles, so I went searching for an alternative and found this.  I didn't change much, just some Italian seasoning in the meat and garlic pepper.  Love it!

Very good concept but needs a little tweaking.  Next time I will double the amount of ricotta/mozz/egg mixture and add probably a 1/4 c more of sauce.  I sauteed garlic, onion, mushroom, and zucchini and omitted the beef since I was having a vegetarian over for dinner.  My 4 year old son had seconds AND wanted it in his preschool lunch the next day!

This recipe wasn't my favorite. I did a whole pound of both beef and pasta. Could have definately used more spices. It's a good idea just needs some "tweeking," In my opinion.

I picked this recipe as my 2 1/2 yo daughter loves penne but doesn't like lasagna so I thought, what the heck? She really liked this but didn't care for the cheese noodle blobs so had to pull it apart a little for her. I did make some adjustments to original recipe which is why only 4 stars. I use a full pound of penne, 3/4 lb beef and extra mozzarella (not sure exactly how much), same amount on all the rest of the ingredients. I also added chopped garlic (3 cloves) and onion (about 1/3 cup) to beef while browning, and added some italian seasoning when I added the sauce sauce as it was a very basic spaghetti sauce. Put down a thin layer of sauce on bottom of baking dish and tossed pasta with a little sauce before layering. I found it rather difficult to layer the cheese could not get it evenly spread. I did cover with aluminum foil as others suggested, although I had to tent it as pan was so full. I removed foil for last 15 minutes and broiled for last 4-5 for browning effect. I think next time (yes I will do this again) I will mix noodles, sauce and cheese all together and then pour into baking dish, topping with mozzarella. Oh and I'll boil the noodles about 1 or 2 less minutes (8-9 instead of 10) as they were a little overdone after baking. All in all a good recipe that will definitely get done at my house again.

I needed to use up some onion and green pepper so I chopped them up and fried them with the hamburg, also added 2 cloves of crushed garlic. I did not have any ricotta cheese so I just mixed the egg, mozzarella, and parmesan cheese together. Used a jar of sauce and a can of diced tomatoes and whole wheat rigatoni. It was very good and I will be making this again.

Very dry, needs more sauce and cheese. Perhaps if double sauce and ricotta would make it yum. A lot of effort for a big letdown.

Very good. But I also agree that this needs more sauce. I actually doubled the cheese mixture and still found I could have used more. Next time I will double to meat mixture and triple the cheese mixture.

This was ok, but not a lot of flavor.  My son's favorite food is pasta and he only ate about 5 bites and said he didn't like it.  I probably won't make it again.

This is a great concept with the penne noodles.  So easy.  That is why the 5 stars.
I have made this a few times and after reading over some reviews have opted to use all 1% cottage cheese and just used the hand blender to make it smooth like ricotta.  Cuts down on the fat content and ricotta here is more expensive than cottage cheese.  
I doubled the beef, added extra Italian seasoning and some sauted mushrooms and onion the second and third time.  Then I mixed in some spinach with the cheese mixture.  I feel like I am making the recipe go farther that way...
Great recipe to "gift" for someone who has helped around your neighbourhood just as a thanks.  Or for a potluck occassion. Freezes really well too. Thanks.

An easy and delicious recipe. I always go for the easy first and taste second so I was happy to find this tasted good as well. Could it have somehting to do with the loads of cheese used...? ;)

This was a huge hit with my family!!  I don't usually make lasagna simply because it can be time consuming.  This is a wonderful alternative and tastes jut as good!

We loved this!! Much easier than lasagna, but it tasted just as good. Spiced it up for our taste and added a few extras and it was perfect!

This was very easy to assemble and definitely made more than five servings.  I substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta and added garlic powder, basil and oregano.  I think it would have been better with a little more meat and/or mixing in some Italian sausage.  When baking it, I covered it with foil as several others suggested.  I'll likely make this again.

Loved it!  We love lasagna, but I hate the layering and then trying to serve with the regular noodles.  This is just as good if not better and much easier.  I add onion and green pepper to the pasta sauce with the gr. beef...yummm!

I agree with a previous note that said this was a great base recipe. I made this will a little more sauce (about another half bottle), added basil, sauteed onions and mushrooms, browned italian sausage, and I added Nutmeg and a bit of pepper to the cheese mixture in which I used the ricotta, mozarella and parmagiano regiano.  Get creative or the ricotta can get a bit bland.

Wow, everyone at work loved this!  I made it for a potluck.  It is so much faster than making Lasagna! I cooked onions and lots of garlic with the ground beef and used a bit more parmesan.  Thank You. I will definitely do this one again.

'Made this out of desperation - desperately didn't want to go to the grocery store! :D 'Had the ingredients - why not?This is one of those recipes that you can make as ho-hum or as fab as you'd like.Ho-hum with straight-from-the-jar sauce; better with your talents. :) I used a 29oz can tomato sauce,I only had rotini.Ya know, corkscrews.'Don't remember why I bought those,but half the box was gone.Anyway, 'thought I'd thicken the sauce since rotini wouldn't hold much sauce. We-e-ell, I'm glad I wrote down what I did because those kids want more.Surprised me!Yeah,I'm always up for Italian; but those kids?  Food critics.Soooo,I sauteed 1 medium onion a few minutes then added 3 cloves minced garlic.A few minutes later, added 1T basil, 2t oregano, 1t sugar, 1/2t salt, 1/8-1/4t black pepper, 1/8t cayenne.Stirred to heat the spices then added 29oz tomato sauce.I let that simmer a while then thickened with 1 1/2t cornstarch & water.  I put some of the sauce in with the cooked rotini.Half the rotini in an greased 8x8.Mixed together the 24oz lowfat cottage cheese (less 1c - It looked good since I was hungry. :D), the egg, the 1/4c parmesan & most of the 8oz Italian blend cheese.Put half that on top of the rotini, remaining rotini, the rest of the cottage cheese mixture & the reserved Italian blend cheese.  Baked at 350.Covered till hot, then uncovered till bubbly.Well, the 8x8 was a little too small.It didn't overflow, but liquid splattered/dripped out.A smoke alarm may have sounded. :)

I have made this several times and it always turns out great. I just use whatever kind of pasta I have in the pantry and skip the ground beef. I add a little garlic and onion salt to the cheese mixture. I also like to slice up a mozzarella ball and dot the mozzarella slices on each layer and on top.

Meh. Ok, but not great. Would be great as a freezer "cook ahead" meal, but other than that I will probably not make it again. Maybe I added too much pasta.

My husband and I both liked this but I thought it could have used more flavor.  I think the pasta sauce is the key here.  I sauteed onions and garlic and added to the sauce but it definitely could have used more seasoning.  It was quick and easy and I loved not dealing with the lasagna noodles.  Good substitute for lasagna!

Quick, easy and delish!  Couple of suggestions-I used 1 lb of Italian sausage instead of gr beef, 1 and 1/2 jars of sauce and a whole box of multi-grain penne in a 9x13 pan.  Forgot to cover it with foil this time, but will do so next time to keep pasta in the corners from getting crunchy.  Overall great recipe!

We thought it tasted bland. Next time I would use mild Italian sausage instead. Also some garlic, hot pepper flakes, and basil. I also wouldn't bother layering it. Just mix it all up and top with the remaining mozzerella. I'll definitely make it, my way, again. As always, it boils down to personal preference...

My family loved this! I used one suggestion to layer the hamburger on the bottom and it worked great but then the top layer was noodles and the parts that stuck out got hard during cooking. I will try to cover them more next time and use more cheese!!!!

Not bad, but pasta seemed a little dry.  I doubled the beef as others suggested, but maybe I needed more sauce, too?  Or I saw that someone else made it the night before to let the flavors marinate--I think I'll do that next time.  Very tasty, though!

The first time I made this dish I felt it needed more sauce...it was way too dry but still tasty.  The next time I made it I used more sauce and it turned out better. Next time though I will do as another reviewer suggested and mix the sauce and noodles together.

It was good but not great.  I used Emeril's Home Style Marinara sauce.  Even though I added additional spices the dish still tasted a little bland.  If I make this again I will make it with the Italian Spaghetti Sausce recipe from this site.

Very easy to make, but definitely needs some tweeking. Next time I  will add more sauce and use less ricotta. The cheese was overpowering. I will also add a considerable amount of seasoning- especially garlic.

This dish was very good but I must share a mistake I made in hopes of preventing others from doing the same.  I added to the ground beef a jar of pasta sauce as directed but the sauce I used was loaded with ground Italian sausage.  This pasta sauce itself is actually pretty good but so much meat in the jar means less actual sauce in the jar.  As a result, my lasagna turned out drier than I care for.  I’m sure that it would have turned out perfect had I used a standard sauce free of any meat.   There’s plenty of ricotta in this recipe which works for me.  I’m so disappointed when I bite into lasagna that has little or no ricotta.  BTW, I believe that this recipe would be equally good if the ground beef were omitted and replaced with ground Italian sausage.  That’s how my Mom always made her lasagna and it was great.

Very bland as is.  Added onion and garlic to meat, and Italian seasonings to cheese mixture. Regular lasagna recipe is still better.

For what it is- a simple, tasty lasagna dish- it deserves 5 stars.  Anything this yummy I can whip up so easily deserves it.

I enjoyed this recipe far more than my family did.  My husband (who is 100% Italian), was not sold on this.  I don't know what ingredient in it is sooo rich, but it is almost overwhelming.  I loved the sauce and will make it again, but probably with a regualr pasta noodle to hopefully reduce the richness.  Just a personal preference..

This was good and easy!  My very picky hubby loved it.  My only complaint was that I found it a little bland.  Next time I'll season the beef a little or add some italian sausage.  Definitely a keeper.

Only thing I tweaked in this recipe is, I used 2% cottage cheese opposed to ricotta cheese. I'm sure either/or would have worked just fine. Fabulous. Quick and easy...same great taste. Another instant family favourite.

Wonderful!  The only differences that I made were that I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and I flavored the beef with some garlic powder when it was cooking.

I changed up the order of assembly - pasta, cheese, then meat sauce.  It does need to be covered with foil; the edge noodles got a little crispy.  Very yummy!

Isn't this baked ziti?!!!  It wasn't easy to "layer" the dish - it came out looking like a mess.  After it was done baking I had to throw it all in a bowl and mush it around to make it look normal.  It tasted ok.  Jar sauce is yucky to me and it had way too much ricotta for my liking.  Won't make again.

It was pretty good. The penne was too big and tough to chew. I would use a smaller noodle next time. Also the sauce needed more seasoning. Good idea though!

I made this recipe, but doubled the amount of hamburger and also added italian seasonings, onion flakes, mushrooms and garlic to the meat as it cooked. The meal tasted great. However, you definitely need to add much more pasta sauce, because it was really dry. I ended up pouring pasta sauce over the individual serving before eating.

Easy and Delicious.  I doubled the recipe and sprinkled the ground beef with garlic powder, pepper and onion powder while browning.  Next time I will make sure to have extra sauce for the table so you can add more on top of each serving if desired. This is a great recipe and I will make it again.

Everybody liked this a lot and it was easy to prepare.  It didn't offend my ricotta-disliking-daughter, either.  I used a chunky sauce for more texture.

This was very good...however, I missed the traditional lasagna noodles and will definately try to use those next time. I felt the penne pasta noodles were too odd for me with lasagna.

This was easier to make than regular lasagna.  I used home made meat sauce and some small rigatoni.  With ricotta I added an egg, parm and mozz chesse, parsley (just as for my lasagna), and some S&P.  Makes it more spreadable this way also.   Tasted just like my lasagna so thats always good.

This gets 5 stars for flavor,and  5 stars for the low cost but I have to rate it four stars for originality. This came out like baked ziti with penne noodles. I did cook a diced onion, garlic and red pepper in some olive oil first and add it to the sauce. I also doubled the recipe and we ate it for dinner 5 days in a row. No one complained everyone loved it.

Very tasty!  To make this suitable for my "meatatarian" man, I used 3/4 lb. ground beef and only about 1/3 of the pasta.  I also replaced the ricotta w/ cottage cheese.  We both loved it!  This was simple and easy for a weeknight.

This was very good!  I made it first time for a lunch party and everyone enjoyed it and asked for the recipe!  I think its much more delicious that lasagna (partly because the penne holds the pasta and cheese inside!)!  Very good!....i sneak veggies in!....lol

I can't believe I never thought of this - so easy, and just as good as the traditional method.  I used a little more ground beef and reduced fat cheeses.  My husband thought it could use more sauce, but my son and I thought it was perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I used a little more meat..half ground chuck and half ground italian sausage,a full pound of rigatoni pasta, and added a can of tomato sauce. Easy to make and tasted great! Thanks!

I used hot Italian sausage, cut into bite size pieces instead of the ground beef. I also added some cut up zucchini and onion, along with a few red pepper flakes to the skillet when I was frying up the sausage, then added the spaghetti sauce. I followed the rest of the recipe...except I doubled the pasta, sausage and ricotta mixture. I put a little spaghetti sauce on the bottom of the dish before adding the pasta, so it wouldn't dry out of stick and I used double the spaghetti sauce. This is definitely one of my all time favorite pasta recipes...great for busy weekenights and makes awesome leftovers too!!

Excellent.  So much easier than dealing with lasagna noodles...with exactly the same flavor.

Yum!  I made a few changes so I could use what I had on hand:
9x13 glass dish
1 lb ground beef (97% lean)
1 box whole wheat penne (about 1 lb)
1 26 oz. jar of Newman's Own Vodka
1 c. mozzarella
1/2 c. parm
1 17.6 oz. carton Fage Total 0% yogurt
1 beaten egg
1/3 c. mozzarella sprinkled on top
covered with foil while baking
a bit more mozzarella sprinkled on each serving

It was so good!  The Fage yogurt is thick and similar in texture to ricotta.  I bet if the yogurt were thickened by draining over night it would be even more like ricotta texture-wise.  This recipe seems very forgiving!

Great EASY recipe. It makes A LOT too. I used ground turkey and added garlic and onions and some spices and doubled the Parmesan cheese but I will definitely make this again. I loved how easy and fast this was.

My husband loved and said that I should definitely keep this recipe. I used mini penne and used more than 1/2 lb. I also added Italian seasoning to the sauce.

YUM!  Made this for a family potluck on the weekend and it was great!  Used a full pound of lean ground beef per some other reviewers and added some diced zuchinni and fresh garlic to it too.  Also upped the sauce/pasta mix a bit, overall fantastic!

In search of the perfect cheesy baked mostaccioli recipe, this is getting very close. I upped the meat a bit and added a little extra cheese, but then I discovered that there wasn't quite enough noodles/sauce for the amount of extra stuff. My bad, I'll do it better next time. It's a great recipe to make your own.

Very tasty recipe. I did tweak this recipe in a very minor way by adding a bit more parmesan to Ricotta (1/3 VS 1/4) and 1 TBSP Italian seasoning to the jarred sauce as it needed to be woken up flavor wise.  I layered as directed in a very large 5# Disposable Bread Pan found at Walmart which I think only carried in-stores around the holidays. This deep and large pan allowed me to create a thicker layer of Ricotta in the middle (2/3 placed in middle, 1/3 placed on top layer )which in turn creates a lasagna feel and look.I also modified the amount of parmesan from personal experience by adding 1/3 cup parmesan vs 1/4 cup. This is because the parmesan cheese will absorb the clear liquid (the whey) the ricotta gives off when cooking. This keeps your 'lasagna' drier and FAR less runny. NOTE:  The bread pan inside dimensions:  11-3/4" x 5-1/2" Depth: 3-1/4" 40 gauge aluminum foil Capacity: 80 fluid oz . I estimate that this pan will hold 10-11 cups by calculating the dimensions which is just a bit less that a  2-1/2 quart casserole dish that will hold 12&1/2 cups .  Pictures to follow.

I made a half dozen or more pans of pasta lasagna in aluminum foil pans and froze them all.  I'm ready at a moments notice to give a meal to someone in need.

This turned out pretty well.  I keep Kosher and don't mix meat and dairy, so I used the Morningstar Farms soy crumbles instead of beef.  I sauteed them with some onion, mushrooms, and garlic and used a chunky pasta sauce.  You have to use a little bit more sauce with the crumbles because they absorb some of it and plump up.  I also added several spices to both the cheese mixture and the sauce mixture...basically opened up my cabinet and used whatever sounded good.  I remember it included basil, oregano, and crushed red pepper. Next time I might add some spinach to the cheese mixture to add some more nutrition.  Not the best recipe I've ever tried, but for the small amount of effort it required, I would definitely make it again.

This recipe might be ok as is, but struck me as being very bland.  I did like the idea of using penne instead of lasagna noodles though.  So I made it gluten-free by using Wegmans gluten-free corn penne-rigate, and eggplant, sliced about 1/4 inch thick and peeled, for the pasta layers.  I added sliced pepperoni and sprinkled each layer with pepper and oregano.  I let it cool for an hour to firm it up so it sliced nicely, then re-heated each piece in the microwave for 20 seconds before eating.  It was great this way! 5/2/13 update:  Made this again and added chopped red peppers, onions and mushrooms to the meat layer, plus a teaspoon of italian spices sprinkled on top.  No eggplant this time.  It was yummy.

I wouldn't say this is mind blowing, but I would say that it's a keeper. Very similar to lasagna, without all the work. I used a full 12 ox box of penne and just added some additional sauce until I thought it was wet enough. I also mixed the sauce into the pasta and layered with the ricotta. As for spreading it, I found that it was easier to use a spoon and "snap" it down. Slightly lumpy, but oh so easy!

I just loved this but cooked it in a crock pot. Only took a couple of hours and then kept on warm unitl supper. It has a wonderful favor. I only used one cheese and a different meat. Everyone loved it. Thanks for the great recipe.

Good quick fix if you're looking for lasagna flavor without as much work. I used a pound of seasoned ground beef (from the freezer) and did not double anything else...turned out great! Baked it in 5 small aluminum pans for (large) 'individual' servings and took some to the neighbor!

I, as previous reviewers double the meat and added an additional 12 oz of sauce.  I also added chopped onions, carrots and celery that I sauted the vegestable until soft before browning the meat. As a "mock lasagna" it was very good.

I made this tonight and the whole family scarfed it down.  The only tweaks I made was to add some basil to the ground beef while cooking it.  Otherwise, really yummy.

I've never liked making lasagna, but this recipe made it simple. I used an entire pound of ground beef, a little extra cheese and sauce. I also substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta. I had this for dinner the 2 nights following and it was just as good then. Thanks :)

Very good.  I had leftover hamburger and some rotini in the pantry along with some cottage cheese instead of ricotta and it turned out really great.  I also added some spices like oregano and basil to the hamburger and a few tbsp. of chopped fresh parsley to the cottage cheese.  Will make again!

This was really good.  I was excited to make it because my kids love dishes like this, and then realized that I was out of spaghetti sauce.  So I used the "Quick Spaghetti Sauce" recipe for this since I always keep canned diced tomatoes on hand, with 1 pound of ground beef and a 12 oz bag of pasta.  The sauce to pasta portioning was perfect. I recommend trying it with the quick spaghetti sauce recipe also. My daughter ate 3 plates of this and actually wanted more of this instead of a slice of the Valentine's day ice cream cake I brought home for dessert.  Will definitely make this again and again!

This was really good and quite easy and fast to make.  I used a mix of whole wheat penne and rotini, Classico pasta sauce and an 8 oz. bag of Pizza Cheese (included cheddar and mozz.)  Not as good as lasagna, or course, but still tasty!  Served this with sauteed lemon butter broccolini and snow peas.

This recipe was very easy and delicious!  We were in a hurry so cooked in the microwave rather than the oven at the end.  We cooked it 6-7 minutes.  It was really good left over the next day also!

This dish turned out to be awesome! It was simple, yet flavorful, and really hit the spot. I used a whole pound of rigatoni and a whole pound of beef. I actually had leftover potroast type beef to use up, so I spiced that up with some hot pepper flakes, garlic, oregani, etc. and it was perfect. Followed all other directions per the recipe, threw it all in a 9x13 and we had a fantastic dinner 45 minutes later--as well as yummy leftovers for the rest of the week. If you're on the fence, reading these reviews--make this recipe! You can't go wrong

I made this with a pound of chicken and used wheat penne pasta. It was so easy and delicious. I added a couple cloves of garlic to the chicken when cooking. I used Classico Spicy Tomato Sauce.  I didn't find it to be soupy at all.

Very tasty! I did add extra spices to the sauce to season to my taste (basil, garlic powder, minced onion). I had sauce left over and used it to spoon on top of the Pasta Lasagna when serving. It was a hit for Sunday dinner and I will definitely make this again.

My husband loved this!  I did add lots of spice to the ground beef while sauteing, as to not have a bland dish (garlic, italian blend, crushed red pepper) and I used 1 pound of ground beef.  Next time I will use some sausage as well.  A keeper!

Great taste!  I doubled the receipe and used one large lasagna pan, and it worked perfectly.  Makes great leftovers, too!  You can perk up the ground beef by adding some garlic, onion, and mushrooms too!

This is a great recipe!! Easy to follow, and delicious. I am a cheese love, so I added extra cheese inside the lasagna, and on top. This is a great recipe for those who don't have a lot of time to prepare dinner, but want a good, homestyle meal. I use a jarred pasta sauce so this also helps cut the prep time.

My husband and I loved this dish.  We used Rigatoni and Spicy Tomoatoe Sauce, along with ground turkey instead of beef, and added some chopped garlic and onion.  We also covered with tin foil and it turned out great. The recipe says it serves 5, but it could easliy serve 7-8.

Very easy and tasty substitute for lasagna!  Used 3/4 lb of rotini and baked in a 9 x 13 dish, covered.  Substituted sweet Italian turkey sausage for the beef.

We LOVE this recipe and have made it MULTIPLE times. I freeze it, unbaked and bake it later. I double the recipe, except the ricotta, and use about 2lbs. of meat and can get 3 meals out of it for the 3 of us ... plus LOTS leftovers for the 2 year old who just wants more, more, more of it. Thanks for such a great recipe.

This is a great easy and hearty dish - and it also tastes good with vegetarian meatless crumbles instead of ground beef!

Easy to make.  Great soccer night dinner.  Kids loved it and I was able to sneak a few veggies in the sauce.  I used a little more mozzarella for my husband but I'm sure it would have been fine without the extra.  I will definately add it to the school/dance/soccer/basketball night rotation.

This recipe was great and so easy! I love to cook, but sometimes get lazy, but this recipe was easy and had great taste.  Even my picky boyfriend loved it. Pair it with a tomato and mozzarella salad and it was perfect!

Reading the other reviews and having just made this myself, I find the answer to the "needing more sauce" and "too much ricotta" problems is using 1 full lb of ground beef. The only thing I changed was using the 1lb of ground beef and also putting some onions, mushrooms and garlic into the beef mixture.  The only problem I ran into--and it wasn't really a problem, is that maybe I would also add a little more pasta--another 3-4 oz. Otherwise, this recipe is quick and easy and a big hit!!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and we both loved it!!! It was easy to make and it was delicious. I added fresh mushrooms in between the layers and it was yummy. I will definitely make this again and it is a good recipe to be creative with. Would work with lasagna noodles too.

Yumm!  I made a couple easy changes based on what I had on hand.  I substituted a package of Trader Joe's frozen mushrooms with garlic for the ground beef, and cottage cheese for the ricotta.  It took approximately 30 minutes to bake.  It was amazing, and we will definitely make it again (with the changes)!

My family LOVED this recipe!!! It is now one of our favorites and will be added into the rotation. 
I doubled it and added about a cup of chopped spinach and also about half a cup of mushrooms to pump up the vegetable content.

This is a great alternative to Lasagna and easier to make.  I added a few of our favorite spices and added a couple finely chopped carrotts to add the veggies.  I liked the suggestion to mix some of the sauce with the noodles.  It was very tasty with a cabernet.

The family really liked this and it was much easier than making lasagna. This was really a typical mostaccioli dish but the ricotta cheese did make it stand out above the rest. I used a jar of pasta sauce and did not find this dry at all, but this is preference. I did jazz up the ricotta cheese with different herbs & spices and suggest everyone play around with this dish. This will definately be a fall back recipe when I need one!

Very easy and tasted good.  I had friends over for dinner (6 of us total) so I upped the pasta to 1 lb. and used sweet italian sausage (cut into round discs) instead of ground beef.  I also used a 9"X13" pan to cook.  We had plenty and everyone had seconds.  I will make again.

My entire family, including 2 kids, loved this!  I think I like it better than regular lasagna, and it is SO easy.  I left out the meat since my husband is vegetarian, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I laid a piece of foil on top during cooking,too, to keep in moisture. I will definitely make this again.  GREAT!

This was great.  I used the whole lb of pasta and the whole lb of ground beef.  It could have used a LITTLE more sauce, but an extra jar would have been way too much so I will stick with the single jar.  My family RAVED about it.  My husband says he thinks he likes it better than regular lasagne because it isn't so messy.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I used almost a whole pound of pasta instead of only half, since people said it was too much cheese.  I thought it was a perfect amount with the added pasta.  I also used ground sausage instead of ground beef, and browned it with garlic and italian seasoning.  I thought it was great.  Not quite lasagna, but almost just as good.

This was pretty good!  I did up the hamburger to 1 lb and put in 2 jars of sauce.  This is a good base recipe but it does need some extra flavors added.  I added 2 garlic cloves and put a little parsley in the cheese mixture.  Next time I will probably add a little basil or oragano to give it even more flavor.

This is very good. I'd actually give it 4 3/4 stars. I just think that there is a little too much Ricotta cheese.

I am giving this 3 stars, but only because it was edible. I don't know what I did, but mine was kind of soupy-- and not a lot of flavor. It needs some spices, maybe italian sausage too. But, again, it is edible, easy and the kids did eat it but I don't think I will be making it again.

My three boys really liked it, but my husband and myself thought it was a little bland. I did use 1lb ground beef, but might try cottage cheese next time and will add more seasonings. I will make it again since it was easy and the kids really liked it.

This recipe was good, but not great.  My husband felt the same way.  I will not make it again - it is not good enough to waste nutrition on this dish.

I made this with whole wheat rotini and 1 lb of lean ground beef, but otherwise exactly as written.  It was really good and I'd make it again.  I think the rotini absorbed the sauce more than penne would, so I'll try it with penne next time.

This recipe didn't have much flavor, even with sauted onion and garlic, that I added. I did forget to add the 1 egg, but surley that couldn't have made that much of the difference. At first bite my husband said that he really thought it was good, but by the end of dinner he rated it with 3 1/2 stars.

Really good. I added a thin layer of ricotta and used 1 1/2 jars of sauce and one big can of crushed tomatoes and a package of vegan ground beef. Also, it was good with a sprinkle of grated Parmesan on top.

the ricotta cheese was a little over powering. so I'm not going to use so much next time or I seen someone say they used cottage cheese which I might do instead and also add more sauce for sure.

I made two large pans for a crowd and got nothing but compliments. I made my own sauce the day before using ground beef and Italian sausage which I got the recipe from Worlds best lasagna on Allrecipes. it is much easier than using Lasagna noodles for this Large quantity. Also I let the ricotta cheese get to room temperature is much easier to spread around and i used shredded mozzarella cheese.

Made it for my picky kids ( 1 1/2  and 4 1/2 year olds). They both gobbled it up in two days back to back! My husband and I enjoyed it too! I subbed with ground chicken since my husband is Hindu, and used vege capilini pasta instead.

This was very good. I made it according to the recipe. I didn't have a 2.5 quart pan (just 2 quarts), and it was more than we needed since there are only two of us. I divided it into two pans and threw one in the freezer before baking.  I stuck with the half pound of ground beef, because the dish has lots of other protein. I thought it looked like it needed more sauce, but when it came out of the oven it was just right.

Family approved! So good! I did 1/2lb ground beef and 3 sweet Italian sausage (casing removed) cooked it with garlic, drained. Used Gemelli pasta since we didn't have penne and it turned out great. Definitely a great recipe!! Thank you!

Very good, much easier then messing with lasagna noodles. I did substitute the meat with some roasted broccoli and cauliflower as I am not a huge meat eater. Also added a tsp of garlic & onion powder to my sauce due to the sauce I bought was a tad sweet and need more flavor.

I only gave this 4 stars because  I made some changes:  I used 1 lb of meat and 1 lb of whole wheat penne pasta, so I needed 2 cans of pasta sauce.  I also sautéed onion and garlic with the meat.   I agree with others that it sounded like it needed some zip, so I added fresh parsley, dried basil and oregano, and red chili flakes to the cheese mixture, which is how I make regular lasagna.  My husband preferred this to regular lasagna.  This was perfect in a 9 x 13 dish with the changes I made.  And much easier than layering using lasagna noodles!

Made one change. Used half ground beef and half hot Italian sausage. My standard lasagna mix of meat.
This recipe uses too, too much ricotta, has no flavor.
Pasta ended up being very mushy.
Husband, who is a pasta lover, took one bite and shoved it aside. 
Won't make again.

It's an ok recipe.  More of a baked ziti then a lasagne.  I used a whole pound of beef and seasoned it with onions, garlic powder, and a few drops of hot sauce. Used whole wheat penne. Even with extra seasonings it was pretty bland. Might taste better the second day.  Would be good for a family with kids.

I made a few modifications.   I used garden rotini and doubled the recipe since all my pasta is in 1lb bags.  I added some Italian herbs to the cheese mixture.  I also added some olive oil and Worcestershire sauce to the meat sauce.  It turned out well.  Don't be afraid to experiment.

I love trying different recipes. I seasoned my ricotta with oregano, garlic powder, pepper and some parsley flakes. I also added some blended Italian and some mild cheddar cheese to it because I love cheese. It turned out really well. I was hoping that my son would try it but I was wrong because he still wanted his PBJ. Thanks for the recipe.

This was much easier and tasted just as great as lasagna made with lasagna noodles. My kids LOVED it.

I thought this was very easy but dry. It won't take the place of real lasagna. There was a bit much ricotta and I used one pound of ground beef.

It was very good once I took some suggestions with the cottage cheese and spiced things up.  And it does make good left overs and tastes even better after it has set.

I unfortunately was sadly disappointed with this recipe.  I always make my own pasta sauce so using jar sauce already put the recipe to a disadvantage.  I added additional spices to the sauce along with a little garlic and onion but still I found the recipe quite bland. Possibly if I had simmered the sauce a little longer it might have been a little better.  I can see that it might be a quick meal for a family with young chilren but for myself I prefer the "real deal."

Just to make this recipe more flexible I tried it with alfredo sauce and 2 cups of left over turkey. Add a bit of garlic and italian seasoning, throw in some mushrooms and it makes for a great alternative.

I used a whole pound of ground beef.  I should have added a little more sauce.  But I also used 3 baby tomatoes and sliced them up and placed them on top like shown in the picture, but I put them all over the top (like a pizza)and sprinkled them with Herbs De Provence and a little sea salt...yummy!  I also used low fat cheese and it still turned out great

Very good. This is my go-to dish for visiting sick friends or entertaining a large group of people. I usually omit the ricotta and the egg, add whichever other shredded cheese I have around (cheddar, monterey, anything), add some oregano and garlic, and give all the ingredients a good stir in the baking dish rather than layering them.

This recipe is outstanding! Whoever thought of using ziti instead of lasagna noodles, is a genius! It was quick and extremely simple to throw together. What a treat!

Wow. Really good and easy. My 13-year-old daughter who doesn't like lasagna liked this. And it was really good in my lunch the day after.

Made this last night for dinner and found it was really quick and easy to prepare. It turned out great but the next time I would not put as much ricotta cheese because it was a little to much for my taster. However, this is a keeper and the recipe will stay in my family.

Really easy and makes a ton.  Next time I would add a little extra sauce only because it was a little dry for my taste.  Great and easy recipe.
