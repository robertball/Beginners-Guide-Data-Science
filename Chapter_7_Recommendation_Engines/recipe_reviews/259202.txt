This worked out wonderfully!  The spices are the perfect combination to invoke that Autumn feeling!  The only change I will make for next time is the honey-maple syrup-spice mixture.  I think I will make a separate batch each for the apples and the topping.  Doing half the batch for both did not work out for the topping.  That is the only thing I would do different for next time but there will most definitely be a next time!
