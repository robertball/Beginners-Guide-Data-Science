My family loved this recipe.  I doubled the amount of curry and added shredded carrots and sliced zucchini, as well as eliminating the tomatoes.  Very versatile, great one dish meal.

This is very good for a curry, considering how easy it is to make. My husband loved it. It will be a standard. I used chicken breasts. It is a keeper.

Yummy as directed.  I do like a little more coconut sweetness.  Perhaps I will drain the tomatoes next time.  So good with noodles!

First time using curry. I wanted a change from the norm.I didn't do the "to serve" part. Served with mashed potatoes to soak up the sauce. My husband and I both liked it.

I've never had curry chicken, but really wanted to try it. I found this recipe and decided that the ingredients were simple enough, and I had almost every ingredient listed. This came out well. I had to add a flour and water mixture to help it thicken up a little. Besides that it was pretty good. My family loved it. I wasn't quite sure what you serve with this kind of dish so I just added a tossed green salad. This one is a keeper and I will be making this again. I only gave it four stars because I really haven't had any other curry dishes to compare it with.

Fantastic recipe! For me, this is a great base. My family and I enjoy REALLY SPICY and REALLY SPICY HOT food. I used skinless boneless chicken strips that I boiled, drained and cut into chunks. I too drained the tomatoes. I used a vidalia onion, regular coconut milk, and doubled the curry powder.  I also added Hot Curry Paste to the level of spicy hot that we like.  With about 10 minutes left, I cut a Red Bell Pepper into strips and threw it in; we like our peppers a little crunchy.  If I had some sliced water chestnuts they would have gone in as well.  Terrific!!!  The leftovers are screaming my name as I type. Gotta go.... :)

I was so excited about this recipe, but it turned out of more of a chicken curry soup than a curry.  I think it was the chicken broth that ruined it.  If it wasn't for that, I think this dish would be great.  The finished product was very thin, and you couldn't even taste the coconut milk (the best part!).  I may try to thicken the leftovers with cornstarch (and there are a LOT of leftovers!).

Delicious recipe and really easy to make.  Two-day-old leftovers were even better as the flavors had really permeated the chicken.  Highly recommended.

This was terrific tasting. We really enjoyed in our home, serving it with a nutty rice pilaf.  Added about 4 tablespoons on flour to thicken the sauce and let it simmer for 30 minutes. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. A keeper in our home.

I love curry but just didn't love this one.  I think the combo of tomatoes and coconut milk just didn't mesh as well as I thought.  I'm sure this is probably just personal preference

Crock Pot: Often I will add all ingredients except for coconut milk and put this in a crock pot on high for 4 hours with frozen or thawed chicken. We like to eat out and have curry occasionally and have tried different recipes over the years. My husband really likes this one. I know everyone has changes, I thicken up the sauce with cornstarch but otherwise make it as stated. Don't be intimidated by all the people with all their changes - give it a try as is and then change what you want. :) Add salt!

This was quite good and very easy to make.  I added a slurry of cornstarch and water to the mix, so it would thicken up some more.  I couldn't help but wonder what it might be missing.

Edit:  I added about 1 tsp of salt to the leftovers before refrigerating, and the curry was actually much better the second day!  

Original review:  Another reviewer on here described this as, stragely, both bland and spicy.  They were right. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding some zucchini and carrots.  I did use hot madris curry powder, which is what I always use. It was quite spicy, but there was something missing. Salt? Thai basil?  More garlic? I just don't know.  I will likely make this again and see what I can do to find the missing ingredient.

This was my first experience making chicken curry and it was an easy recipe to follow and turned out delicious!  I used boneless chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken, I substituted hot sauce for cayenne (didn't have any) and once the recipe was at the "simmer stage" I threw the whole thing into my slow cooker and let it cook for about 4 hours.  The meat was deliciously tender and everyone really enjoyed it. I would definitley make this again.

This dish was amazing! So easy, wonderful taste, quick to make. Only change I made was using fresh tomatoes, and adding a flour/water mixture at the end to thicken it up. Next time I think I will add potato and maybe chopped carrots. My 10 yr old even helped out, it was so simple!

There were two problems I had with this dish. First, it was too runny to eat with rice. I let it simmer for about an hour and a half- it turned creamier. Also, it was a bit bland, even after simmering it for over an hour. I easily resolved that issue by adding some salt. After I made these changes, it tasted great!

Was great. I did add one carrot sliced to onions. I cut 2 potato in 1" squares and pan fried in 2-3 tbsp veggie oil adding some salt and pepper to taste. Then added right after coating chicken. My wife absolutely loved it. I will add 1 tsp more of grated fresh ginger next time.

My husband, kids and I all love curry and we thought this recipe was great. I made just a few alterations to the recipe as posted. I also used organic spices, meat, broth and herbs (our family preference).

I did not use rotisserie chicken, but instead cut four boneless, skinless chicken breasts into small chunks. I dredged these in flour, salt and pepper and browned them in a skillet with a bit of oil. (I used a stainless skillet, rather than non-stick, so that I would have lots of brown bits when I was done.) I deglazed the pan with the chicken broth. This seemed to give the broth a better flavor and the browned flour left in the pan thickened it a bit. I set the broth and chicken aside, and followed the rest of the instructions as listed.

My only other alterations were to chop, rather than slice, the onion and to vary the spices (no cloves, half the amount of cinnamon, more curry and a dash more cayenne). I also used regular coconut milk rather than light.

I did not have a problem with this recipe being too soupy, as others have reported. I did, however, drain the tomatoes (as others have recommended) and perhaps dredging the chicken in flour helped.

It also needed a bit of salt when done cooking. Overall, though, it was great. I served it with jasmine rice and fresh cilantro, but passed on the mango chutney. Some fresh nan bread would have made it perfect!

This was great! I added sliced yellow pepper to the curry and steamed broccoli as a side instead of rice to keep it lower in carbs and calories.

This seems to have potential, but the spices need to be at least doubled. Add vegetables like carrots and potatoes.

I really like this, but I had to add more spices to it. I added a lot more curry, and ended up throwing in additional stuff as well. I drained the tomatoes and used the can of stewed ones with red peppers in it for extra spice. I'm sorry I can't tell you exactly what I added because I did it to taste. I would suggest everyone else do the same.

So I loved this, but it was SOOO spicy for my tastes, probs per my alterations... I tried to make it vegetarian by omitting the chicken & using water instead, but I ended up scorching my mouth. Also, I used 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 tsp cinammon in place of the other spices b/c i was missing a lot of them. I think altogether I just went a little too spice heavy on the entire thing. I'm definitely planning to make this again, though, and cut the curry back to 1 tbsp. I think adding a sweet potato or two would be DELISH, as well as peas, carrots, and perhaps some zucchini. (:

I added some chunk pineapple (at the end) and some zucchini and other veggies, and it tasted just like a local restaurant's curry that I crave frequently!

We really enjoyed this curry.  Now I like it better than recipes that start with raw chicken because the meat is so tender when roasted and then stewed in the sauce.   I followed it to the letter but then added in some small diced carrots (2 but could have done more) and frozen peas (about 1 cup) to beef up the "vegetable" content of our meal.  Delicious!

So good!  My husband and I both loved this.  Definitely a keeper.  I did use a chicken I roasted at home, just because I happned to have time that day.

This is a great curry.  I followed some of the reviewers and doubled the curry powder, cayenne, and garlic. (We like spice in my house)  I also added a large handful of pre-packaged shredded carrots just to get some veggies in.  This is a real keeper!

Absolutely delicious. I didn't have coconut milk, just coconut flavoring and it ended up simmering for about an hour since I had to drive across town after putting it on (don't worry-- my husband was home with the stove.) Also, my chicken was not rotisserie; I cooked it myself first, so really, the actual recipe is probably even better than what I made last night, but man, was it good! Can't wait to see what it tastes like the next day after chillin' in the fridge overnight. Thanks! This one goes into my rotation.

My house has never smelled better!  My husband has been begging for something with curry in it, and this was the recipe that I had that matched my ingredients in my kitchen...  SO FANTASTIC!  My neighborhood will be knocking on the door soon--soo good!

A huge hit in my house. Made "as directed." My seven-year-old daughter absolutely loved it (I did swirl some sour cream into hers to help cool it down). She said that I should fill the bathtub with this so she could dive in. Seriously, she said that. I couldn't make it up!  Even DPIAH liked it.  They said they want it every week.  Served with basmati rice and nan. Thank you soooo much!

1st time was great and 2nd time I doubled curry and added a little bit more if each spice to really give it some kick. Eliminated tomatoes both times. Excellent!

This was absolutely delicious, I added a can of sliced mushrooms along with the tomatoes, and used lean turkey breast for a healthier dish. I also omitted the chicken broth, the sauce thickness and outcome was great. Thanks for sharing.

I decided to try this recipe because of all the great reviews, but I was really disappointed by it. I followed the recipe exactly, but when it was done and ready to eat, it was bland and boring. Despite all those spices there just wasn't much there! I added a (lot) more cayenne, curry, and even some sugar. Still, it wasn't that great. I wished I'd had another can of coconut milk to add, but then it would have been *really* runny, because I had a hard time getting the sauce to thicken anyway. Sorry, but this recipe was a dud as far as I'm concerned.

Loved it!  Chose this recipe to try because of the coconut milk - and then discovered I didn't have any when I was well into making it.  Used half milk and half half-and-half and that worked just fine.  Topped with toasted coconut, raisins, toasted almond slivers, chutney, and chopped green onions.  Served with rice and very lightly candied carrots.  Delicious meal!

This is a phenomenal recipe!  I didn't have cloves, and instead of using the rotisserie chicken meat I followed the recipe exactly up until adding the chicken.  I let chunks of raw chicken thighs simmer in the sauce until they were done.  I also only had regular coconut milk (which I saw was quite fattening!)  I found the sauce to be a little soupy for my taste, so I drained it into a saucepan and let it reduce for a while before adding the chicken and onions back in.  Served it over Jasmine rice with green beans on the side.  Hubby called from work just to say the curry was "bad a**"!

one problem i had with this curry was that i didn't know if it would be more indian style or thai.  after making it, it is definitely more thai (i guess the coconut milk should've given that away, but i'm still new at this whole cooking thing!!).  i love thai and so does my fiance, so we loved the recipe, though i made several alterations. after reading all the reviews, i decided to leave out the chicken broth altogether.  even without the broth, the curry was still a bit watery (thai style) but it thickened up over night and tasted great as a leftover (which inspired me to write this review!).  also, i cut 2 chicken breasts into smaller chunks and sauteed with the onion, spices, and garlic. this allowed all the spices to permeate.  when the chicken was almost done, i added the diced tomatoes and coconut milk and simmered for about 30 minutes.  i added about 2 tsp of Turmeric to the spice mix to make it spicier, and several dashes of crushed red pepper.  i don't measure out tsps and tbsps.  i would recommend hot madras curry powder if you love spicy food like we do! :) great recipe idea though!

We really loved the flavor. Was worried it would be too sweet, but it wasn't. I used Rotel instead of diced tomatoes to add a bit more heat  -- great addition.  I would decrease the amount of liquid next time since it came out more like soup consistency.

This was only ok. It wasn't bland, but the flavors didn't blend together well.  If I were to make this again, I would add regular coconut milk instead of lite.  Had to simmer twice as long to get a stew like consistency.  Next time I will stick with my regular curry recipe.

I just made this dish for supper fpr my clients (I work at an addictions facility), and they all loved it!  They said that it was my best meal yet!  I will be making this dish again for the next program!  I did follow some suggestions of adding water chestnuts, and I added red and green peppers... I'm not a fan of curry, but it was good!

Made this for a small dinner party a few nights ago. I added a diced red and yellow bell pepper when cooking the onion to add some color and a little bit of crunch. I also added some fresh chopped mango when adding the chicken. It was a very runny curry, but I served it over rice which soaked up much of the extra liquid. It's a very mild and smooth curry that my family enjoyed, including my 8 year old daughter who dislikes spicy foods of any type. It received rave reviews from the guests we had over. I'm certain we will be making this again in the near future.

Super wow! We love curry chicken, curry vegetables and curry rice. This recipe delivered way more than I expected. Maybe... it was too expensive to use a whole can of coconut milk. I added thawed out snap peas for the last ten minutes and made my own broth by simmering the chicken bones in water.

Awesome---used pre cooked rotisserie chicken from Sam's club.  Thought recipe lacked more spice and aimed for spicy/sweet...so on top of the yellow curry, I added some Thai red curry (taste of thai supermarket brand) and splenda.  Awesome!

I thought for sure I was going to get complaints from my boys for this one, but it was GONE before I could put the second bite in my mouth!  They loved it.  I didn't put as much paprika in and probably would put less in next time to tone down the spice but that is just personal preference.  I could see add other vegies as well.

This was too good.  I did not change any of the spice measurements.  Perfect flavor!  I added a peeled sweet potato, and frozen peas and carrots.  I will definitely make again.  This curry was even better the second day.

Very good!  I used chicken breasts and cooked them with the onions.  The "stew" seemed a little thin.  Maybe next time I would add less broth or something.

Excellent! Made it for Super Bowl 44.  It was a little spicy for the the older generation and the younger group.  Added a half pint of heavy whipping cream to add some thickness to the gravy.

Love it! I used only half the amount of cayenne, and substituted greek yogurt with honey instead of the coconut milk.  Wonderful dish!

I love this curry. I didn't give it 5 stars because of the changes I made. I doubled the spices and used raw chicken which I cooked with the spices and then simmered in the liquid.

Everyone said it was different,but it was a big hit with the family & friends. I did change it up a little bit though, I didn't have the milk, or tomatoes, I added a jar of green curry from Trader Joes that I had in the pantry and I had some apples that had been soaking in a dressing that I made last week, I also added some veggies from the garden, it was very good. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Very very good. I also added half pound of fresh button mushrooms at the last 5 minutes. Unfortunately, I forgot to add the cilantro and I think that would have given it a nice freshness. Will try this one again.

Thank you for a quick and healthy recipe.  We loved this dish, serving with mango chutney and coriander really brought the flavours to life.  I did not have ground cloves so added turmeric, cumin and ground coriander to my spice mix.  For flavouring toward the end of cooking I added soya sauce and some honey with ginger pieces in it.  I discarded the skin from my chicken befor adding the meat to the curry.  I also bulked up the curry with chopped celery, capsicum (red and green) and some potatoes.  Had quite a few extra vegies to use up thid weekend.  Will definitely make this again

This recipe manages to be both really spicy and really bland at the same time.  I followed the recipe exactly, and although it was okay, I think it could use something else in it- salt maybe?  The sauce was also really runny, if I made this again I'd add flour to thicken it.

Other reviewers have mentioned it, but this recipe feels like it's lacking something.  It has a nice flavor, but it lacks any sort of depth - sort of bland.  While we were eating I was surprised at how spicy it was, but even that didn't boost the flavor level.  Maybe I was disappointed at how it tasted because my kitchen smelled so delicious while it was cooking.  And, as with other reviewers, I found it difficult to thicken.  Whether I make it again or not is debatable.

I thought this recipe was pretty good. I omitted the tomatoes.  I had to add salt for taste and flour to thicken the sauce. I also decided to add some cardamom & turmeric. My son had thirds as well.  I will be making this again, but maybe trying yogurt instead of coconut milk.

This turned out AMAZINGLY delicious. I did everything as the recipe said, and then added some diced potatoes and carrots. It was sooo delicious, and the sauce was thick and creamy. It was even better the next day when I had some of the leftovers with some rice.

Very good and fragrant, especially with basmati.  However, it tasted as if it were "missing" something.  Maybe not enough curry or maybe it needs some "heat" to it.  I drained the tomatoes as one person suggested.  I was unable to find light coconut milk so I used regular - note that the cream at the top of the can should be skimmed off first before using.  Also, I did not have any cloves so I omitted them - but even still I don't think this was the "missing" taste.  I will add more curry next time and something to give it more spicy-heat!

Really it's more of a 4 1/2 and that's just because it never seemed to "thicken" and I was left with a lot of tasty, but runny sauce. Very good and super easy! I used fresh chicken breasts that I browned before adding to the sauce and simmering. Turned out great! Thanks for posting.

I definitely think it needs the fruit to go along with the strong flavor. I think it might be better if left to being watery. I found in trying to thicken it up it was maybe too dense. My advice don't skip the chutney.

I've made this recipe many times, my kids really like it. I've never had trouble with it being too soupy, I just make sure the mixture is at a true simmer (always bubbling slightly) until it's as thick as I like. I add a bit of honey as well, since my kids prefer it that way.

With all of the spices I thought there would be a lot more taste.  I added more curry at the end but other then that followed the recipe exactly.  I will look for a different recipe to try.

I made exactly as written, with one exception, and it was wonderful!  I like a bit of sweetness with my curries, and had some apples available.  I cut them up, but was resigned to having them brown because I didn't have a lemon.  Then I realized I did have a lime, so I added the lime juice to the apple pieces and sprinkled them on with the cilantro.  The apple gave a crisp texture to some of the bites, and lent a sweet/sour combination that added another level of flavor to the curry.  Delicious!

Delicious curry!  Wasn't sure about the tomatoes and coconut milk together, but they were wonderful!  Halved the onion and chicken.  Added six carrots (cut into rounds), a head of cauliflower (roughly chopped), a diced sweet potato, and a sliced green pepper.  (Green pepper for the last 10 minutes only!)  Used regular coconut milk instead of light.  Added salt, black pepper, and dark brown sugar to taste.  Would've been even better with the cilantro and mango chutney if I'd had it!  Regarding the thin broth... this is always how Thai restaurants serve their curries.  When served over rice in a bowl, it gets absorbed.  Try this one... you'll love it!

Didn't have coconut milk, doubled the spice as suggested by many and it was a good flavor.
Had rotisserie chicken already shredded so it was super easy!

I made this for my friend who loves Indian food and her Indian American husband. They both love it! Try to shop for the ingredients at an Indian grocery store if there is one near you. The Indian curry powder, coconut milk, and basmati rice are essentials. You can skip the mango chutney.

Curry flavor was outstanding and complex. Very fragrant, indeed. I used 2 boneless, skinless breasts instead of buying a rotisserie, and saved half of the spice mix for next time! Thanks for sharing!

Very good.  I added a bit more curry and added fish sauce as well (just a touch). I also put carrots and peas in the mix and used chicken breast I had on hand. Turned out delicious

I somehow became obsessed with using every bit of the turkey left over from Thanksgiving.  I was on my last leg trying to find something unique to cook today and almost settled for turkey tetrazzini.  Then I found this recipe. I managed to have everything on hand.  It smelled so wonderful and mouthwatering while cooking.  It has a nice kick and is salted lightly enough to enjoy the rest of the flavors.  I will be making this again with other things besides poultry.  Thanks

This was a totally boring dish that lacks salt, sweetness and mouth watering appeal.  A waste of all the ingredients listed.  I give it one star because it contains curry.

I love this recipe. I just reduced everything to 3 servings and omitted the tomatoes, put a little more cinnamon than called for and added a shredded carrot, some corn & peas. It turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is great! Like others, I didn't add the broth or tomatoes but used an entire can of coconut sauce; added extra curry; and also added shredded carrots, diced celery, and some leftover peas I had in the fridge. My husband raved, and my 13 month old son had two helpings! I will be adding this to my weekday repertoire.

I looked over the other reviews and took what I thought would work, and then went from there.  I did make changes from the original including:  - omitting the broth, adding some salt in its place. I thought the mix had the perfect amt of liquid. - adding two small red potatoes in the oil, before adding the onion.  one sweet potato may be interesting. - added some sliced zucchini, red pepper flakes, 1 additional Tbsp of curry and about 1 tsp of brown sugar.   I am not good at keeping exact measurements but apparently a little creativity turns out!

This was EASY to prepare and very tasty.  I sliced semi-frozen chicken breasts and added just after the onions started to turn translucent.  The chicken released juices into the mixtures but cooked up just fine.  Unfortunately, I didn't have coconut milk on hand and ended up substituting milk, more chicken broth mixed with a little cornstarch and a few pinches of sugar.  It didn't thicken as well as coconut milk or have as rich of a flavor, but it was still delicious.  Will definitely make again with coconut milk. More fattening, but I'm sure it will be worth it!

This was good but not as amazing as I had expected based on other reviews. It has a nice smooth taste to it but I was expecting a bit more definition - and it was quite hard to get it to thicken properly. I had to resort to a bit of flour blend at the end. Might make this again but if so would add more spices and either diced carrots or apples.

This recipe is very tasty. If you save the dipping sauce and store it in your fridge I would recommend to thin it with some chicken stock, otherwise it is too thick and it turns lumpy. I am a texture person and it wasn't pretty the next day!

I had to make a few changes. First of all the sauce was too thin. I added some leftover mashed potatoes to thicken it up. I thought the flavor was quite bland so I added some raisins as some have suggested. It still seemed to be missing something. I added some sugar and felt that it was at least worth a three star rating with the changes.

Really good recipe. I was feeding two young kids too, so I deleted the cayenne pepper. This made a very, very mild curry for those who dont care for *hot*. I gave my dish a couple of shakes of tobasco, that kicked it up a bit.

This was so delicious- I cheated with a rotis chicken and made some Indian fry bread to go with it- just wonderful. My husband was so impressed! 'Who needs an Indian restaurant when I have you!' Definitely a great one for a cool fall day or cold winter evening. It is pleasantly spicey but not in a hot way, more warming. Even my girls (16mos-3yrs) ate it. Makes a nice big batch for leftovers, too.

This turned out really well and was so easy to make.  I added additional veggies.  The curry flavor wasn't too strong and there was just the right amount of spice.  I had plain yogurt on the side and served naan with the meal.

Excellent recipe! I've made it twice now, once with the rotisserie chicken and once with just some cooked chicken breast I had and both times it has turned out wonderfully. I find it goes with couscous very well, and although I'd never used mango chutney before, it's definitely a great addition to this dish. Thanks!

This was so great - really, I haven't even cleaned up the kitchen yet!  I used this recipe with leftover leg of lamb, and it was really amazing.  The sauce was so delicious.  My very picky teenage sons and my husband all loved it - and none of them are big fans of lamb.  I'm sure it's great with chicken, which I'll definitely use next time.  I added fresh ginger, because I had some on hand, but other than that I left the recipe as is (except I didn't have lite Coconut Milk, so I used the regular).

This curry  was awesome, I followed recipe as directed but added only a little broth my hubby was doubtful of it at first and wanted me to use chicken breast but I stuck with the cooked chicken and he loved it especially the tender flaky chicken not to mention the flavour. Leftovers was great too. Delicious and definitely a keeper to make again and again

very tasty, very easy.  left out broth and liquid from tomatoes (used drained 28 oz can instead).  added a diced yellow pepper in with the onion.  otherwise the same, and i didnt find it overwhelmingly spicy. i was hoping more of the coconut flavor would come through, but i was still very pleased with the result.  and it was a piece of cake to put together.

My husband and I loved this!  I did as some suggested and drained the tomatoes, and cut the chicken broth in half.  I used skinless boneless chicken breast and thighs and dredged them in flour. It made a ton of food.  The only thing I would change next time would be to add some salt to it while its cooking.

Rather than buy a roasted chicken, I browned 3 chicken breasts, cut into bite size pieces and dredged in flour.  I also used just a half cup of chicken broth, and regular coconut milk (that's what I had on hand).This was the first time we've ever had this type of dish, and it was delicious. Even the kids loved it.

My family really liked this recipe as a change.  I followed one reviewers suggestion of dicing the chicken, dredging it with flour,then browning, and deglazing the pan.  It came out beautifully.  I struggled with knowing what side dish to use, but next time I'll make it with a baked pineapple casserole as a side dish.

I'm kind of looking for a particular taste, so I'm going to try to be unpartial in my review. I think it was the same consistency as the thai curry I had, but it was much more spicy. I'm sure this is really mild for most people, but I am kind of a wimp, so I didn't care for it that much. The flavor was about right though except that it was much spicier. Overall, I was pretty impressed with how easy it was and yet still so flavorful. It was really good with the basmati rice. If anyone happens to know where I can find a chicken curry recipe that is not too spicy, please let me know.

I followed everything exactly, except didn't a can of chicken broth. I decided to mix a little powdered chicken broth with water and added it until it got to a consistency I liked. We are on a low-carb diet, so we just ate this plain - without rice - and loved it. It was very easy to make and tasted like it cooked all day.

This was amazing! I did everything as follows and eliminated the chicken stock all together, which gave it a thicker, creamier texture and served over basmati rice, with naan on the side. Delish!

The base recipe is good but I did make some changes to make it a more complete meal.  When I added the chicken, I also added fresh broccoli (small florets), thinly sliced red bell pepper and fresh green beans in about 1 inch pieces.  I also added some organic pad thai rice noodles in the last 5 or 6 minutes to allow them to cook in the sauce.   To the spice mixture, I added about a tsp of Himalyan pink salt as others had suggested.  It wasn't that spicy, but has a nice little bit of heat that lingers on the tongue.  I will be making this again!

Easy to make. I like spice so I added a little extra curry powder & cayenne pepper & at the end added salt & black pepper. I didn't want it too wet so I drained the tomatoes & set aside the liquid in case I may have needed it later. Oh & I only used 8oz chicken stock as well. Think I may experiment next time with some kind of bean, black, navy, white or kidney or even chickpeas instead of the canned tomatoes. If I do, I will update!

Fragrant Chicken Curry Haiku: "O.M.G. DELISH. Just a *bit* too liquidy. Reduce chicken broth." Fragrant is an understatement - this smelled so pungent (not in a harsh way, but it did linger thru the next day, so those sniffers sensitive to curry be warned!) and amazing while it simmered. As somebody else mentioned, it veers into soupy territory, so I'm glad that I'd halved the chicken broth. I didn't serve w/ mango chutney - just chopped cilantro, basmati, and toasted chopped walnuts.

Definitely a keeper recipe!!  Followed the recipe pretty closey, except I cut back on the chicken stock because of many reviews calling it too "Soupy".  Burned off excess liquid towards the end of the simmer stage & perfect!!
Served on a bed of brown rice w/ some Chickpea Tasty Bites, Naan & it was a perfect (not to mention inexpensive) Indian meal.

I love this recipe!! We make it all the time ! I follow it exactly and serve it with rice and warm flatbread. Here's a time saving tip. I buy my rotisserie chicken from Costco but I get the package that's already shredded and packaged up! I half the bag because it's sold in a big pack and freeze the other half for next time I make the meal! Yummy stuff !

Made this twice now and my daughter made it once.  We agree that its excellent. Served over basmati rice, with a colorful veggie or two, this makes a fantastic, easy, weeknight meal. If you replace the vegetable oil with coconut oil, the flavors are even better.

As is I have no idea what it would be like!  We omitted the chicken broth altogether but used an 18.25oz can of petite cut tomatoes instead of 14oz.  Used 5 chicken breasts instead of the rotisserie chicken.  Added an extra Tbsp of curry powder - could've easily doubled it!  This was really yummy!!  Boys (6.5 & 4) LOVE Indian food - so this one was also a hit!! :)  It does NOT have as much coconut flavor as I was expecting, but that might improve if a full-fat can was used... or even just the cream off of one full-fat one...  Next time! :)

It was easy, but not fragrant - it was rather boring tasting, but in adding in some craisins that actually improved the taste - gave it a little sweet kick that it needs.

Very good flavor, easy to make. I simmered it for closer to 40 minutes than the 20 stated in the recipe because it was still quite soupy after only 20 minutes. I would try adding a container of mire poix next time because I like carrot and celery in dishes like this.

I made this while on a family vacation with my in-laws and it went over very well!  I omitted the cayenne (just didn't have any), added vegetables (for double recipe: several mushrooms, 3 stalks celery, 5 carrots, 2 very small potatoes, & 1 can peas though I would have preferred frozen), doubled the garlic, used 3 lb cubed boneless skinless (raw) chicken breasts instead of a rotisserie chicken, halved the chicken broth (low salt) and added several dried Turkish apricots (quartered).  It was served over brown basmati rice and garnished with chopped fresh cilantro & peach salsa. Delicious!

Great flavor and smelled great. 
I made as directed, with exception that I doubled spices, cut chicken to 1 cup and added 2 cups of mixed veggies (peas, carrots, squash, zucc, broc, califlower).
I doubt I would add the tomatoes again, the acid of the tomato cut a lot of the sweetness of the coconut milk. 
We needed to add more heat, a lot more heat with some red pepper flakes served table side. 
Minced fresh cilantro on top was a great addition. I bet water chesnuts and or raw cashews would be nice addition as well. 
Like others, I found it too much liquid in the sauce, even served over brown rice, would reduce chicken broth by half as well, or increase simmering time or add flour or cornstarch to thicken.
Will make again
