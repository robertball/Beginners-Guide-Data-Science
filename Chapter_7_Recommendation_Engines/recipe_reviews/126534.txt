Well, it may have a bunch of ummmm...less than healthful stuff in it, but then, so do cookies and chocolate cake! LOL! This one is just marvelous! The ice cream filling is quite rich and refreshingly mild in peppermint flavor. It took about 8 ounces each of chocolate creme cookies (*you* know which ones!) and candy canes to equal the amounts required by the recipe. The most time consuming part was unwraping the shrink-wrapped cellophane off the blasted candy canes and breaking them up into just the right sized pieces. The food processor and small blender both just pulverized them, so I ended up breaking them up with a meat mallet in a pie tin. Anyway, I'm going to stock up on candy canes before the holidays are over so I can make this a couple more times throughout the year! Thanks so much for this recipe!

I made this for my daughters birthday and it was a HIT.  I changed some things.  Instead of crushing candy (I didn't have any) I just put a teaspoon of peppermint extract in a quarter cup of water.  I also didn't put any candy bits in the ice cream mixture. I used the chocolate sauce recipe from the Tunnel Ice Cream Cake recipe on this site and drizzled it over the cookie crust before putting in the ice cream mixture.  It was delicious! So sorry for the reviewer that wouldn't even attempt to make this recipe. They sure missed out!
