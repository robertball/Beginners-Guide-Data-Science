A little too much mayo in it for my tastes. People at my party seemed to like it.

This dip was a snap to make and was well received by my guests!  I didn't use the monosodium glutamate...instead I just used a little more of the spices called for.  We served it with carrots as well as tortilla chips and it went well with both.  A really nice, versatile dip!

It is the little black dress of Dip recipes....you can never go wrong with it. I have made it more times than I can count and it is always a hit. It is milder in flavor if eaten the same day.  Flavor intensifies overnight. Everyone, even kids, like it.  I have substituted lower fat ingredients successfully, too.

I made this for our Super Bowl party and it was a big hit.  We had it with fresh veggies and chips.  I recommend this one.

Excellent! I did leave out the MSG. So simple yet so good. Both my husband and my son really liked it. It's also a good one for the low carb diet. I make it all the time now. Thanks for a great recipe!

Love this dip.  I made it for a baby shower and it went over well.  I remembered this from my mom making it for parties when I was a child.  I too left out the MSG.

This goes nicely on a green salad as well.  I added some diced onion and onion salt.  I think next time I might even try a splash of olive juice.  Make sure to let it sit overnight, it makes a BIG DIFFERENCE in the flavor.

I thought this dip was too mayonnaisey.  I had to really dress it up by adding more of the spices it called for, plus some others.  I thought it was so-so, but my guests didn't really like it at all.

It was fine, but lacking flavor.  I omitted the MSG, but I don't think that was the problem.  Even a little bit of salt would have made it a lot better.  However, good base recipe. Maybe it just needs a little tweaking.

Quick, easy, and delicious.  Very good with or without the MSG.  Add more dill if you're leaving out the MSG. Thanks for taking the time to post the recipe Sue.

Really liked this dip.  I used it as a sauce on top of salmon patties.  The flavors work really well together.  Also would make a great veggie dip.  Thanks!

This dip is GREAT! I had mistakenly bought a jar of mayo and now I have use for it! I did make some minor adjustments. I left out MSG and I added 1 tsp of McCormick California style onion powder. Turned out really good! Will use this one again! Thanks for sharing!!

This dip was easy to make and delicious. I made it healthier with low-fat sour cream and miracle whip instead of mayo and it still tasted wonderful!

It was great! I left out the MSG and instead of seasoning salt I used black pepper, salt and garlic powder.

This recipe was just okay.  I followed the recipe exactly and wasn't very thrilled with it.  I prefer a ranch dip instead. I won't make it again.

I wouldn't add seasoning salt to this!!!!! I also added 3 tsp of dried dill.  and a dash of black pepper!  then i would give it 5 stars. the mayo has enough of a salty taste.

Good, basic veggie dip, which is what I was looking for.  I didn't put in MSG--don't have it and wouldn't have the slightest idea where to find it--and put in dried minced onion.  Good with carrots and cucumbers.  Thanks for the recipe.

Everybody's saying to leave out the MSG. I make it with the MSG just like the original recipe calls for, and it turns out great. Very very tasty on crackers, chips, or veggies.

Has a very nice flavor.  Left out the MSG because my sister has a serious reaction to MSG. Added chives and a squeeze of fresh lemon.  Definitely make a few hours ahead so dry herbs have time to absorb moisture.  Served as a sauce for "Potato Salmon Patties" from this site.  For dipping veggies, I prefer "Saint Patty's Dill Dip" recipe, which has a little more kick.
