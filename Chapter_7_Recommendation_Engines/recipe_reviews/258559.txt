I loved the tang the tomatillo brought to this.LOVED it! I like things hot so after tasting it I added some crushed red chili flakes and blended them in in. For most people I think the heat level is pretty spot on as written. The one thing I would do differently next time is  to not blend the cilantro and some of the jalapeno. I would have liked more texture. Overall excellent recipe and one I will make often!
