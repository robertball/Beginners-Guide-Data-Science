I substituted 6 T. flaxseed meal for about a third of the butter.  I also added between 1/2 and 3/4 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips along with the sauerkraut.  I baked this in a Bundt pan for 45 minutes.  It was very nice, but next time I will increase the cocoa a bit and be sure I add the chocolate chips again.  This recipe is a real keeper.  Even the pickiest eaters in my house had no idea at all that there was sauerkraut in it; they loved it!

This was really good, I was very pleased. I chopped the sauerkraut super fine, so there were only a few incidents with stringy pieces. I frosted this cake with the Chocolate Frosting I recipe and took a few pieces down to the boys at the neighborhood bar and they enjoyed it. UPDATE: Still delicious, made it again.

It was pretty good, the saurkraut needs 2 either be chopped really super fin eor food processed. My brother really didn't enjoy the stringy pieces of pickeled cabbage.

Love this cake!  If you think the sauerkraut taste is a little strong, just rinse it off before chopping it.  It adds a nice texture to this cake.  The only change I made was substituting applesauce for the butter, which turned out great.  This is a very moist cake recipe.  I frosted it with the Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheese Frosting on this site - a big hit!

I loved this cake!  It was moist and yummy.  I substituted the water for coffee to bring out the chocolate.  I also washed, drained and cut the sauerkraut very small.  Would definitely make it again!

I found this recipe delicious! My husband Al had requested a German Chocolate cake recipe for his birthday. I made the cake plus another batch of muffins. The only change I would make at this time is to cut down the sugar slightly. I cut down the baking time by about 5-10 minutes because I was using the convection feature on my oven. Also used silicone pans. No problems there. Made a filling with whipping cream, pudding and nuts for the cake and used a chocolate frosting from another recipe. Comments when I passed out the muffins were: delicious! Rate 4.5

This cake just sounded too weird. So I couldn't help but try it. It was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and made a Swiss Merengue Buttercream Chocolate Frosting and covered the lot with rolled out Marzipan (I made it for my son's first birthday). Yummy. I pulsed the Sauerkraut in my food processor to make sure it's finely chopped as I had read the reviews about it being a little stringy for some. I then squeezed out any excess brine. Next time i might use a touch more Sauerkraut. And there will definitely be a next time. It is not THE BEST chocolate cake recipe I have ever had, but it is very good and I just love the gimmick of having Sauerkraut in a cake.

WOW, this really does taste like German Chocolate Cake!!  Deffinatly must puree the sauerkraut, but its amazing how it adds to the flavor of the cake but not in a saurekraut way! Will be keeping this one around the house all the time! :)

So delicious! I substituted oil and pumpkin puree for the butter and used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour instead of all white. No one would guess there is sauerkraut in these! I made cupcakes instead and baked them for about 22 minutes at 350 degrees.

Made this on a last-minute whimâ€¦ I have never tasted a more flavorful, more moist, lighter chocolate cake. It did not last long! Used my Blendtek to chop the sauerkraut. Best advice: just drain the sauerkraut, don't squeeze it.
