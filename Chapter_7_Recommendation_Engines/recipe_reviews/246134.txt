Try using either chicken or vegetable stock instead of water, and chopped green pepper in place of peas.

I sautéed the onions and green peppers with a 1 Tbsp of butter instead of frozen peas. I added some garlic in the beginning as well. I added the smoked sausage, tomatoes and then 1 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I didn’t have Zatarin’s so I just poured in a cup of jasmine rice. I let it cook for 18 mins. I covered the shrimp with 2 tsp of Cancun seasoning and cooked the shrimp in a separate pan with butter because not everyone in my family likes shrimp. When the rice is done cooking, I served the dish and added the shrimp and some cayenne pepper. Yummmmmm

I made this with the shrimp, andouille sausage and leftover chicken (my wife doesn't like shrimp) and it was very good. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.

I made the recipe as written.  I’m planning on making it again for the entire family.  At sometime when asparagus is garden fresh, I’ll swap out the peas.

I used andouille sausage and doubled the amount because I didn't have shrimp so I skipped that part. I know andouille is spicy and it was no joke how spicy it was. Also I added a little salt and pepper to the end product for a little more flavor besides just straight spice. Overall it was good and I can see that lots of substitutes can be made for the various proteins. Also I'm sure other veggies can be used as well.

Made no changes to the recipe. No one believed it would be ready as quick as it was. It was amazing. I would definitely make it again.

This  was a very good and easy recipe to make. I found the andouille sausage too spicy  so would stick with a mild sausage next time. I would definitely make this again.

This was a very quick and easy jambalaya. I used sweet Italian chicken sausage links in place of the smoked sausage and just left them whole so I could give it to the kids and tell them it was a hot dog lol... I also used an entire 28oz can of diced tomatoes since that's what I had on hand and then decreased the water to about 1 1/2cups. This was good but not amazing.
