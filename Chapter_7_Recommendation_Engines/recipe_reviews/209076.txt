This recipe is a winner! I've been searching for it for ages... it was a childhood favorite. And just a tip cause I bothered to measure... a 12oz. tub of cool whip is about 4 cups. YUM!!

I followed the recipe but the pretzels were very soggy!! The flavor of the cherries and cream cheese were good.

This was a big hit! Loved the pretzel bottom and the hint of salty with all the sweet. Supper simple dessert to throw together. Will definitely be making again!

I used fat free cream cheese and 1 8oz tub of Cool Whip Lite and 1 tub of Cool Whip Free. For crust I reduced butter to 1 stick (1/2 cup) - worked fine. I mixed the confectioner's and cream cheese together first then blended in the Cool Whip. UPDATE: I would use 1 tsp of Almond extract with the whipped cream mixture. Mine was a bit flat on flavor. Next time I will cut the whipped cream amount in half (didn't care for the airy texture as written). Overall a good tasting dessert.

Try adding a little cinnamon to the crushed pretzels which I did. Also put whipped topping on top of the cherry pie filling and sprinkled a little more crushed pretzels.

I made this recipe exactly as written. there was way too much pretzel mixture for the very little amount of cream cheese mixture. the pretzels were sogggy. the squares don't firm up -so they don't look anything like the photo.

i made as printed and needed to make a double batch of the cream cheese mixture. There was no way I could get it to spread over the crust. And the crust was not sticking together.I even crushed the pretzels a little more than in the picture. I used the pretzel knots? Will try to butter pretzels next time.

I made this today and it was very tasty I did use about 3/4 stick of butter and I still didn't end up with a crust that stayed together. I also ended up making 2 batches of filling because one was not enough for both layers. I gave it four stars because it does taste very good

Taste was great but you really need to double the amounts for the cream cheese portion to make layers like those in the picture.

I made this recipe exactly as was written except I doubled the cream cheese mixture. It turned out perfect and so good! It firmed up the pretzels weren't soggy and it held together beautifully for serving. The only thing bad was that it was such a huge hit it didn't last very long! Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

There is no neatly spreading the cream cheese layer onto the pretzels. I ended up just giving up and spreading the entire cream cheese layer onto the pretzels topped by the cherry layer followed by the other half the pretzels. I liked the flavor of the cream cheese layer and cherries together; however next time I will just use a graham cracker crust. The pretzels were just okay. Or I could see this being put into custard cups like pudding with no crust.

I was a little disappointed in the crust I think it needed more butter to hold it together. It was difficult to spread the cream cheese mixture on top of it.

This was just meh to us. Hubby thought it was too sweet. It felt like it was missing something to me. It will not keep past one day; the pretzels get too soggy.
