This recipe was perfect for brunch!  I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't taste "low cal."  The only thing that I would change is let the mixture soak overnight in a bowl and then transfer to the pan in the morning before you bake (the bottom stuck a little bit because I soaked it in the baking pan).

This is amazing. Would give it 10 stars if I could. Made it pretty much exactly like it said just used 2 Tbsp. of spiced Rum instead of the Maple flavoring. This is a new family favorite.

More like bread pudding than French toast, but delicious nonetheless!  All the flavors really went well together, and it's not too bad for you, either.  Great breakfast to prepare for the family.  Thanks!

My family and I loved this recipe!!!  What a delicious breakfast treat.  I made it very quickly last night using cinnamon raisin bagels and omitting the cream cheese (didn't have).  This morning...Wow, what a wonderful, EASY breakfast!!! This recipe will definitely impress with taste and presentation!!!!!!!

The maple flavoring is a great idea that I will use other places.  This was wonderful for a recovering carb addict.  I used chunky applesauce for the apples and it was just as good!

This is an excellent breakfast!  Only 2 points from Weightwatchers.  I couldn't find maple extract and used orange extract instead...just as good.  We had company stay for several days and we ate this just about every day.

My daughter and I love this for breakfast.  However, I do not use cinnamon raisin bread, but cinnamon swirl and it is great.  I like some of the suggestions that I have read.

This is a great change for breakfast, and being diabetic this is a sweet treat for me.

Very good.  I left the slices of bread whole, spread the cream cheese evenly on them, then layered the bread and the egg mixture.  That way there was cream cheese  with each bite rather than in the spotted places.

I personally did not care for this, husband thought it was ok.  I would cut apples into small chunks instead of slicing it.
