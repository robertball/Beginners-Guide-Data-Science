very nasty. Will not make again or recommend. I think it was the Zesty Italian dressing, but this was just nasty. possibly substituting cream of mushroom or cream of chicken soup instead of Zesty Italian dressing would work.

I made my own chicken broth and sauted onions, leeks and garlic to give it more flavor and add more veggies. It was yummy! I will make it again.
