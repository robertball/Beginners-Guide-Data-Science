This is a pretty good recipe. I think it needs more flavor, maybe more salt? I only made chicken legs and adjusted recipe for 3 servings. I was out of eggs so oiled the chicken for coating. I had a lot of left over flour but I have to say the coating stayed on well. Good healthy color for the chicken, not as crispy as I would like... but all-in-all an easy to follow, good recipe.

The flavor of this chicken is awesome! We will definitely be making it again. I was out of eggs so I just didn't use them, which was fine. I do however think the cook time is too long. I tested my chicken 5 minutes before time and it was already at 200 degrees so I'm thinking maybe 10 minutes each side, maybe even less. Besides that the chicken was perfect! Making the gravy with some of the leftover flour however was not a good idea; it did not have a good flavor at all. I want to end on a good note so I'll state again, GREAT chicken! Thanks for the recipe! :)

Eight boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Made recipe as written. Added 1 T garlic salt, just 'cause I like the flavor. Compliments all around. Made gravy from drippings. Homemade mashed taters and corn on the cob. Yum!! Pumpkin loaf from this site (Downeast Maine Pumpkin Loaf) for dessert.

1/7/2016: Made this again (along with from this site Roasted Cabbage, J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits and corn on the cob) with 2 whole boneless/skinless chicken breast that I cut into 1 inch strips. Sprinkled garlic salt over cooked strips prior to serving. We love this recipe! Cherry pie and vanilla ice cream for dessert.

This was pretty good.  I don't fry a lot of chicken because of the fat but if you are going to splurge try this. Cindy commented on how easy it is these days to obtain food as opposed to WWII and the depression meaning we can easily spare an egg.  No where did she say she doesn't use eggs.  Come on people learn to read.

Comments are classic as to why people get everything from the news to gossip to recipes wrong..THEY DONT READ OR LISTEN  TO THE  WHOLE STORY/ARTICLE .  In the beginning of the article the writer STATES that during WWII her grandmother didn’t use eggs because they were HARD TO GET DUE TO FOOD RATIONING(if you don’t know what that is, look it up) Otherwise use egg or not, your preference.  My mom didn’t use egg either, but still made great fried chicken. Egg makes it a bit crunchier. That’s all folks!!

Just want to comment you are playing with fire if you dredge raw chicken in flour and then reuse that flour to make gravy. Big no-no. At best it will taste bad and at worse, you will spend the next 2 days on the throne or in the hospital. Not worth the risk.

This was really good, but I think it needs about 1/2 teaspoon more of salt or season salt. Otherwise, this is a wonderful recipe!

Good recipe 
Did add some more seasonings


A word of caution on the flour mixture.

It did have raw chicken dredged through it. Anything you may use it for right away, cook to a temp to kill bacteria.

Do not save flour mixture for another day. This just gives bacteria a better chance to spread

Followed directions, except for marinating the chicken in butter milk and hot sauce for 4 hours, and after I fried the chicken I poured honey over it. Honey fried chicken, yum!

I absolutely love this crispy chicken recipe. mine came out super moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. the only thing I did different is I boiled my chicken before coating and frying. Also I use half fish fry with half flour for the extra crispiness.

I didn’t make any changes to the recipe but if I make it again, I’ll increase the seasonings.  I only used skinless chicken thighs, cooked them for approximately 8 minutes per side.

Never ever re-use flour that has come in contact with raw chicken and/or eggs. You can use the extra flour to make chicken gravy right after cooking the chicken but any leftover flour should be tossed out.

I didn't use the eggs.  Never have.  However I have always coated my chicken with seasoned flour like this to fry my chicken.  I grew up in the south but detest batter fried and coated everything.  This has always turned out great for me.  The color is lovely, the skin nice and crisp, and the flavor great.  Highly recommend it for an occasional splurge.

Good basic recipe.  Everyone has different tastes.  Instead of Sage I add Paprika to the flour.   Not a lot to really effect the taste but the chicken fries to a beautiful golden color.

OMG! 
I had never made fried chicken before and this was the first recipe I saw that I wasn't afraid to try. What a success! I changed up the seasonings just a bit,  and the cook time by a few minutes here and there. Thank you for sharing this,  I'll be making it many times over!

I thought this chicken ended up tasting very nice and I mine did have a nice crispness to it.   I did do the first 10 mins higher and then moved to a much lower temp for the rest of the time.  I didn't have to cook a full 20 mins on 2nd side, so be careful.  Adjust to the size of your chicken.  I did also add some extra salt per other comments and was just a little heavy handed on the other spices too, flavor was nice and chicken moist.  Gave a 4 only because of the few changes I made, otherwise a 5.
