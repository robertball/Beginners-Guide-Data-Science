Wow, so easy and YUMMY! Like another reviewer I didn't have the soup, so I used Lipton onion soup mix and a cup of hot water. Plus I didn't add the basil, as it didn't seem to fit with the other ingredients. Regardless this was fantastic!!!
EDITED TO ADD - I've done this with brown rice too and it needed to bake for 75 minutes, perfect!

I didn't have white rice so I used instant brown rice, and it turned out incredible!!!  I have never been a fan of rice, but my husband is.  I can't thank you enough Monica!  This is one of those dishes that makes people think you slaved in the kitchen, but it's SO simple.

Simple delicious rice.  Too much basil! I cut it back to 1 tsp and its perfect.  I also cut the butter in half.

I made this last night for company, and while the flavor was good, it didn't ever finish cooking.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and subbed brown rice for white rice.  Instead of beef broth I used beef consomme, and I added a small can (drained) of sliced mushrooms.  I also added approximately 1 tsp. of herbes de provece (instead of 1 tbsp. of basil) to go with the chicken I made using that herb mixture.  I baked it covered at 350 for 1 hour as the recipe said, and it never finished cooking.  There was still tons of liquid, and the rice was still totally hard.  I then popped it in the microwave for about 8 minutes uncovered, and it was getting there but never quite finished cooking.  At that point I really needed to serve dinner so I did, and man, was I embarassed about the rice!  While the flavor really was good (quite rich and tasty), the rice was HARD and uncooked.  I might try using white rice and just bake it longer next time, but I might just try another recipe.  There are plenty on here that sound similar and will probaby be better (at least I hope!).

I've been making this for years,  minus the basil and Worcestershire sauce.  It comes out perfect every time.  It's ideal to take for potluck when you don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen, as it only uses one dish.

Very good recipe!  I didn't have any french onion soup on hand, so I used Lipton Onion Soup mix with a cup of hot water.  I'll be sure to make it again using the french onion soup, but until then, my husband and I have some very tasty leftover brown rice to enjoy!

I made this recipe with brown rice instead of white and it was fantastic.  My husband and my 13 year old daughter both went back for seconds.

this is not "brown rice" it is beef flavored rice.  Can we label it correctly?

I'm not sure why this recipe calls for basil because it really is not needed.  I added a pinch but next time I will not add any at all.  Was still good and would make again! Easy side dish to any meal! Thanks Monica for sharing.

I used brown rice because of diet restrictions. Brown rice always cooks longer. For 1 cup of brown its an hour. So with 1 1/2 cups of the brown rice I would count on 1 hour and 30 minutes. Loved the recipe.

I made this as a side for a country style crock-pot ribs and it was absolutely perfect and delicious. I used brown rice instead of white and I didn't have french onion soup so I used chicken broth with onion and black pepper spices and worcestershire sauce instead. I also added some fresh parsley into the mix. It was a great side for my dish!

I definitely would NOT put a whole tablespoon of basil. I used one teaspoon, and it was quite enough to taste it, and more than enough to give lots of flavor to the dish. Otherwise, it was pretty good, and I will be making this again!

I was short on time so i combined all ingredients in a large sauce pan brought it to a boil. Then i put a lid on to cover and lower the temp to med-low cooked for 20 mins or until the liquid is mostly gone it was perfect. Oh i only use 1/2 tsp basil but everything else was as the recipe called for

I didn't have any french onion soup, so I used cream of mushroom.  This rice turned out awesome.  Even my husband, who admittedly doesn't care for rice, said it was really good.  And because it was baked in the oven, it was so easy.  My kind of recipe!

This recipe rocks.  I used instant brown rice, beef broth, butter, worcestershire sauce, 1tsp dried basil.  Didn't have a can of french onion soup so I added 1 cup of water and made the "dry onion soup mix" from this site.  Cooked in the microwave stirring every 5 minutes until it was done about 15-20 minutes later.  Paired this with the "beer lime grilled chicken" from this site.  This is going to be made again and again for sure.

This is a super flavorful dish. I'm glad i started it very early because it took over 2 hours to cook. I used long grain brown rice. At an hour, the liquid was absorbed but the rice was not done. I added in a cup of water. 30 minutes later, it was still undercooked so i added in another half cup. Just keep checking it if you are using brown rice.

Love this recipe, it's the only way I will make rice now, brown grain or white grain rice.  I usually use brown because it's healthier for us and in the oven with the foil sealing in all the steam it comes out moist every time!

My family loves this recipe. Here's my trick to ensure the rice gets done in the hour it calls for: I heat up the broth and onion soup before I mix with the rice and put it in the oven. I, too, use brown rice, which has a longer cooking time, so doing this trick helps a lot.  This rice compliments a lot of different suppers, so I use this recipe time and time again. I also add different things to it sometimes such as mushrooms, peas, diced up carrots, etc. Love it!

The reviewer who said this was rice for people who don't like rice was right, but was wrong when she went on to say that if you like rice, you won't like this. We eat lots of rice, plain and otherwise. We all loved this. I had to use the dry onion soup mix recipe from this site because of my gluten allergy, but otherwise made per original recipe. Delicious! I might try it with a little less worcestershire sauce next time, just to see how that is. This would be great with ground beef, ala hamburger helper, or add a little soy sauce and use it in a beef stir-fry. VERY tasty stuff!

Good rice!  I used chicken broth and brown rice because that is what I had---I did not put the basil in it---doesn't really go with the other flavors.  If you use brown rice, it's going to take about 20 minutes longer than white rice!  Very good, will make again!

my 12 year old and I loved this. Very yummy. I used an extra 1/4 cup water as we like ours rice less  chewy. I made my broth with beef soup base and water because I didn't have any canned on hand...and tossed in some baby portabella mushrooms which floated pretty on the top.If you like shrooms they were a great add.Excellent rice. Will def make again.

This rice was too much.  If you don't like rice and you want to like "rice" this is what you make.  If you like rice you won't like this recipe nearly as much as standard rice.  I served it at a dinner party with grilled shrimp and it took away from how good the shrimp and grilled vegetables were...wish I had of just made plain brown or white rice.

This rice was great!  The whole family loved it.  Like some of the other reviewers, I didn't add the basil.  I didn't want the flavor to be over-powering.  I also had to cook it on the stovetop, because I was running short on time.  It worked out great, and I will continue to cook it this way.  It took about 30 minutes.

Great tasting! I thought based on the name that it used brown rice though after starting to cook it I noticed it called for white. The cooking time would have been doubled with brown rice therefore I microwaved it for 35 min plus 30 mintues on the stove.. with another 1/3 cup of broth it would be perfect with brown rice. I used all broth instead of the onion soup. I just put in a 1/2 cup of chopped sauted onions which tasted great.

Out of 8 people, half liked it and half didn't.  Will try again leaving out the worcestershire and see if that helps.

My family and I loved the rice, but next time I will cut back on the amount of butter the recipe calls for.

I needed something to make with the venison backstrapes I was grilling and this was easy and foolproof. I didn't have the soup or broth so used 1 cube of beef bouillon and a package of onion soup mix. I also saw some of the reviews about to much basil being used and I had some fresh parsley and button mushrooms that needed to be used up, so in they went.The dish needed to be baked for 90 minutes, but in the end it turned out really well.

This recipe is easy.  I didn't want to wait for it to bake in the oven, especially after reading all the posts of it not being done after the allotted time, so I microwaved it for 30 minutes.  Perfect!!  I just mixed everything in a micro safe bowl and zapped it.  No problems.

The basil in this recipe is very overpowering.  I think it has potential for us if I took it out completely as the other flavors in this recipe seem to complement each other very well.  The rice was soupy after 30 minutes, but did come out cooked perfectly after the hour.

I have been using brown rice for years.  I use chicken stock and a bit of powdered chicken bouillon for poultry dishes and beef stock and powdered beef bouillon for meat dishes.
I sometimes used fine grated parmesan or pecorrino romano cheese.  Adds a nice element 
Enjoy

I cooked the rice for 80 mins, and it was still uncooked a bit. Flavor didn't do it for me, not to mention how unhealthy it really is with all the sodium. It was a last minute meal because I was missing things for another dish. Let's say, I will not be making this again.

This truly is a great side dish to any meal - but like other reviewers have mentioned, there is no need to add the basil. One tbsp of dried basil is far too much. I've halved it and it seems to turn out just right. Next time I will omit it entirely. The cooking time is spot on. I love the fact that I only dirty one dish too!

I've been making something similiar for years, and my mother and grandmother before me.  I cut the rice down to one cup, double the butter, no worcestershire or basil and add a can of mushroom peices. It's delicious!

This is GOOD!  I realized at the last minute that I didn't have white rice, so I subbed in brown minute rice.  Next time I will definitely either use white, or regular brown (and cook it longer).  The taste was great, though - although next time I'm not sure I'll use the basil.  The flavour of it wasn't quite right.  Might use the herbes de provence, as another user did.  But this is an excellent, hands-off recipe, that I'l be using again!

I didnt' even have the right ingrediant and this was still wonderful. I used Chicken bulioun instead of beef broth and didn't have french onion soup but this still tasted wonderful. I used brown rice instead of white rice so it did take longer to cook as expected but thank you! I will be making this again and again.

This was really good.  I used jasmine rice because I didn't have regular long grain rice and it turned out great.  I didn't use the basil and it was fine.  Mine was done in 1 hour.  Thanks for this easy recipe.

Also substituted 1 pkg. Lipton's French Onion Dry Soup Mix and cooked on stovetop following cooking time recommended by brown rice package (45 minutes).  Came out so flavorful and delicious!

Excellent!  Used Onion Soup Mix and extra cup of water, and less basil. I did add 1 small can Ortega Diced Green Chilies. Adds flavor, not heat. I was trying to rush dinner, so I microwaved 5 minutes covered before putting it in the oven at 365 degrees.  Fortunately I checked it at 30 minutes as it was done! P.S. This was made with white rice.

This was good, but I think I may try the dry soup mix next time, per other reviews. A little too much flavor for me. I also omitted the basil.

This is a favorite at my home.  I omit the basil, use consumme with a little water instead of broth and put 3-4 pork loin chops on top before putting it in the oven.  Thanks for the recipe Monica!

Very easy and delicious!  I used less butter to cut down on fat and didn't even use basil this time.  Broth and soup make it taste good anyway.

Sorry! Used all the ingredients as told but, it didn't work for us. My husband rarely dislikes my food but today, he actually told me to "take care of the rest"... Don't know, guess the cans were too much.

Excellent recipe!! My husband who usually doesn't like brown rice also loved it! For the healthy reason, I made some small changes. I replace 1/2 cop brown rice with the wild rice; and cut the butter by half. It turned out great! I also soak the brown rice in the beef broth for >1 hour before cooking. 
I also cooked one hour and 20 min.

Found this recipe on Alton Brown's TV show a long time ago for brown rice, and have used it ever since.  Would never use brown rice before since any other method left us less than satisfied.  Every time I have served it since, I get rave reviews.  We use it often and change it up many ways.  For years I have keep copies of it for when I serve guests they always rave over it and demand the recipe, so I keep one handy.  Even serving it plain is delish! Bake brown rice for 1 hour and 15 minutes.

My family has made this recipe for years - it's a staple. For those wanting to substitute brown rice and wondering why it's not working.. brown rice takes a significantly longer time to cook. I say pair this dish with a healthy side and indulge in the regular rice. Such a perfect classic dish!

This turned out pretty good.  I used white rice.  Next time I will use brown rice.  My kids thought I was making meatloaf by the smell while it was cooking.  And they said it tasted like meatloaf so it was nicknamed meatloaf rice lol

Omitted French onion soup (none in the pantry) and used brown rice. Good easy dish that would complement lots of flavors

I took the advice of another poster and used one  10 oz can of beef broth and one cup of water with a package of dry onion soup mix.  A nice change from the usual rice.

My dad taught me to make a recipe very similar to this one.  We melt a stick of butter in a large saute pan.  Then we add one cup of rice and brown.  Then we add one can of condensed french onion soup; one can of beef broth (or water); and Worcestershire sauce (as much or as little as you like).  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cover.  Cook for 20-30 minutes until rice is cook.  A favorite at my house!!  And it can very easily be doubled for leftovers.  Just a little variation of this recipe but just as easy!!!

I have been making this rice for over 30 years. Instead of basil I use about 1 to 1 1/2 tsp of tarragon. This gives it a really nice flavor. I also don't use canned soup, I use a package of Lipton onion soup mix and add 3 cups of water to 1 cup of rice. I don't use worcestershire either. My husband loves this rice.

This recipes had a great taste, but because of other reviews I watched it to see if it had any problems cooking in the oven. After the 30 mins it looked like it wasn't going to get done so I popped it in the rice cooker and that did the trick. I will just start it in the rice maker from now on. But great flavors! Thanks

This rice was really nice. The only thing I didn't like and would do different next time would be taking out the onions left from the soup.

It's extremely rare that all 4 of our kids like the same dinner - but when I served this tonight, they ALL asked for seconds!  I used onion soup mix (about half the packet as the kids don't love onions - and no extra water was needed), and substituted Italian seasoning for bail...and it was soooo good!  I've had a lot of trouble finding a rice dish that wasn't dry and bland....we've finally found a winner!  Thank you!

Great week-night addition to the rotation.  Thankfully my guys like onions; I forgot that the soup has plenty of chopped peices.  Salty for sure; I would love a more natural dish without the canned soup that delivered the same tastes!

Love, love, love this recipe!  Easy and delicious.  Everyone I've made it for wants the recipe.  BUT I recommend leaving out the basil.  We didn't like it in this dish and we are basil-lovers.

Terrific and easy! While it does take longer than an hour to bake, it is well worth it.  This will be in our rotation. I made the following changes- brown rice instead of white, 32oz of beef broth PLUS an extra cup of water, package of lipton's onion soup, sliced mushrooms, cream of mushroom. I sauteed red onion & garlic in evoo.  We enjoy our food more flavorful, so I added paprika, herbs de provence, basil, kirkland's(costco) no salt seasoning mix, and a dash kosher salt & fresh ground black pepper. Next time I will nuts and maybe water chestnuts.  I cooked it covered in my Pampered Chef covered baker for 1 hr @350 and 30 min @375.  I think next time I will baked the dish @375, which I think reduce the time a bit.

I made this recipe just as written only I used brown rice.  When cooking brown rice you have to lengthen the cooking time by half hour, though. Love the recipe, MEGSCOOKIN, thank you!

The best brown rice recipe I have tried.  I used a packet of dry onion soup mix and 1 cup of water in place of the can of onion soup, as others suggested.  I forgot the worsteshire sauce, and added only about a teaspoon of basil.  As far as, needing longer cooking time in the oven, I cooked it at 400 degrees for an hour, leaving it uncovered the first 15 minutes, to allow the temperature to rise quickly, then covered it to retain the moisture.  I stirred occasionally.  I also added a can of mushroom peices.  Very good.  Served with salmon and broccoli.

My family and I loved this dish.  It was very easy to prepare.  I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of cutting back on the basil. I think those of you who substituted brown rice for the white rice need to understand that brown rice takes longer to cook. Again the recipe is wonderful as written! Thanks Monica for a great recipe!

Title is very misleading- I agree with previous reviewer. In order to make this recipe with instant brown rice, one would have to monkey with the amount of liquid used instead of using what the recipe calls for. This recipe sounds yummy, but not what I am looking for- a recipe for real brown rice.

Pretty good.....took longer than 1 hour to cook....that was no problem. I did use brown rice instead of white and only used 2 tblspns of butter. I love a rice dish that you just prepare and pop in the oven....very easy. Thanks!

Followed directions exactly. Cooked for almost 2 hours and still had crunchy rice. Shame too, this recipe had all the makings for a great side. Certainly smelled wonderful "cooking". Won't make again unless I precook rice.

I wanted a brown rice recipe to go with the caramel apple pork chops on this site.  This is the one and I'll use it for other things as well.  I fried up a little extra sausage and onion with some carrots and celery then added the rest of the ingredients per recipe substituting brown rice for white rice.  It took a little more water but was absolutely amazingly wonderful covered with that apple topping from the pork chops.  Even my rice-haters liked it!  Next time I may just put in more sausage and just make this rice as a main dish...or maybe with some sausage gravy....

I really like rice a a side dish and wanted to try brown for a change. After reading all the reviews I used low sodium broths and used garlic powder rather than garlic salt. Even the butter was unsalted. Needless to say my rice was not salty at all. I did cover while baking. The baking time was 1 1/2 hr. This was very creamy yet not mushy. I will make this again for sure.

Loved this recipe.  I also substituted brown rice. I've made it several times already and is a new family favorite.
Quick and easy preparation.

Today is a VERY good day!  I made this brown rice for the first time and think this is a superb, great tasting, easy recipe.  I did use Lipton’s onion soup mix and it added a great flavor.  It is a GREAT day because I had this with two other GREAT recipes from this site: “Bessy’s Zesty Grilled Garlic-Herb Chicken” and “Kecia’s Broccoli Salad”.  Three wonderful five star recipes.  Thank you ALL!!!

Great recipe.  Easier than store brands.  I did agree with one review that said to use less basil.  The only two things I changed were to use the advice of less basil and I made my own "onion soup mix" using another recipe I had found (minced onion, onion powder and celery seed).

Loved this recipe! I made some small changes by using brown rice instead of white and using cream of mushroom soup mix instead of french onion as these are the ingredients I had on hand.  I made the rice for me, my bf and another couple and everyone loved it.

I liked this recipe because it is the only brown rice I have had that is not hard, crispy and dry after cooking.  BUT, I thought it was a little bland, and that could have been due to the fact that I had to substitute for basil as I did not have any!  I will try it again and maybe add a few things!

I gave this 4 stars based on flavor.  The cooking method didn't work for me.  I ended up dumping everything in a pot and making it on the stovetop.  Also, hubby complained of the "tang" of the worcestershire sauce so next time I will leave that out.  Other than that, the flavor was really good.

I'm only giving this 4 stars because my twins liked it so much.  One of them is very picky and he asked for seconds.  On the other hand, I thought it could have used some more flavor.  I did add 1 Tbsp of dried basil, as we like basil, and did not think it was too much.  I also added a tsp of garlic but will add more next time.  I will try this again, as it is very easy to make, but I will add some onions, mushrooms, and a little more beef base.

This a really good base recipe.  I made mine on the stove top and doubled the recipe.  I also added beef stew meat and broccoli to make a complete meal out of it.  My family loved it.  My kids ate 2 servings.  I served crab rangoons on the side.

I have been making this for years, but without the Worcestire sauce or basil. I also use beef consumme instead of broth, though I have used broth when I can't find the consumme. It is a fantastic dish, my boyfriend absolutely loves it and requests it often. It is very fatty though so sometimes I cut down a little on the butter-- doesn't really hurt the taste too much.

Really good. Used brown rice. I microwaved the broth, 1 packet dried onion soup mix and butter till hot about 5 mins then stirred in rice and seasoning. Only took 45 mins. Left lid on for nearly 30 mins while finished rest of meal and the rice was still fluffy, hot and good. I added my own salt and pepper but everyone else ate it without adding anything. I’m going to use leftovers for fried rice tomorrow. Thank you for nice recipe which would work well for a buffet dinner.

I made it substituting olive oil for the butter.  I can’t seem to make regular rice and this worked great for me.   Even my wife liked it and she’s a rice connoisseur.  I will make it again sometime.

This rice turned out perfect. I didn't have condensed onion soup so I used a Lipton's Onion soup mix. I used beef bouillion granules to make the beef broth. put the butter in and the basil. stirred it at 30 minutes and in an hour was so tasty. added just a tiny bit more Worcester sauce to it. Never baked rice  in oven before but this worked perfectly.

I made a few changes to the recipe:  1 cup of long grain white rice, 1 can french onion soup, 1 can beef consume', 1/2 stick of REAL butter. Bake at 350 for 45 minutes OR microwave on high for 6 minutes (covered) then microwave at 40% power for 30 minutes!!! If I am making this at home, I microwave, if I am doing this for Thanksgiving and doubling, I cook in the oven for 1h and 15 minutes. Voila! Enjoy

This was a great side dish.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception that I used 1/2 of the basil called for.  My rice came out perfectly done with a wonderful flavor.   And it was probably the easiest recipe I have ever made.  What could be simpler than stir everything together?   For those reviewers who used brown rice and then had difficulty with getting it done, brown rice takes more liquid and more time...

This recipe was very good!  I want to eat more brown rice instead of white rice and stumbled upon this recipe.  Brown rice always tastes like cardboard to me, but this was very good!  I used the suggestions as others mentioned; brown rice instead of white rice, baked 1 1/2 hours instead of 1 hour and used only 1 tsp. of basil instead of 1 tbsp.  Will make again!  Thank you!

Best brown rice I've ever eaten!  Loved, Loved, Loved it.  I went with a couple of reviews I had read and cut the basil and Worcestershire sauce from my recipe; and like most I didn't have the soup but I did have the Lipton mix.  I also used a beef bouillon in place of the broth, so altogether I used 2 cups of water( 1 to dissolve the bouillon and the other for the onion mix).  I cooked my rice according to the instructions and it was perfectly cooked.  I will definitely be eating brown rice more often Now.

Sounds delish and I know a friend that used this recipe for a wedding dinner and it was a real hit. I have to laugh though at the people that give it a low rating but say "I used this and not that, and I cooked it this long and not that long, and I added this but not that" how silly, why rate the recipe at all if you're not going to follow the directions and then complain when it doesn't come out right. No duh!!--you didn't even use this recipe.

I agree with some people saying it was a little too overpowering. I really can't tell if it's because of the basil or the entire can of onion soup. I like it but did feel sick after! :(

Great base recipe and nice flavor minus the Worcestershire sauce & soy sauce. The first time I cooked it I made it with all the ingredients and found it a tad spicy.  I never had 2 hours or the patience to make rice so I'm rating this on the way I have made it; which is on the stove top.  Directions:   1)Melt 2 Tbsps of butter over medium heat.  Once melted, saute the rice until starting to brown 3-5 min; stirring frequently so that it won't burn.  2) Add the can of beef broth and can of french onion soup (omit Worcestershire, soy sauce and pepper), stir to combine, bring to a boil, lower heat to Low, cover and cook 20 min.  Let stand for 10 min with lid on, fluff with a fork and serve.

I did not care for this recipe. Made this recipe exactly as written (except made and used the onion soup mix from this site).  Incredibly salty.

This is excellent! The only reason it is not 5 stars is because it is loaded in sodium.

I left it in the oven for 1hr and 15 mins.

Still had a lot of liquid and the rice was still so hard!

No one liked it, had to make a pot of white rice as I normally make it so that my family can eat.

First time I've ever reviewed - I felt like you deserved it since I make this so often! My family loves this dish and we eat it all the time. Each of my four kids can be counted on to go back for seconds (not to mention their mother...but that's another story, lol!). I've always made it pretty much as is, though because I keep kosher, I can't find condensed French Onion soup, so I just make it with condensed mushroom soup and it still tastes fantastic. Thanks for such an easy and tasty recipe!

This had a great flavor and the whole family loved it! I used brown rice and followed the rest of the recipe, but I too had an issue with the cooking time. No worries though! I added just a sprinkled of water after an hour and let it cook about 45 mins longer and it turned out great!

Excellent rice dish.  My 5 year old had multiple helpings!  We ate the whole dish in one evening.  Omitted most of the basil, but kept the rest of the recipe the same.  A keeper!

This was excellent! I made it to go with Slow Cooker Pepper Steak (also from this site) and it was delicious! I didn't add the basil and when I took it out at the half time I added some fresh chopped mushrooms and I would definitely do that again. This is a definite keeper!

This was good. The only problem was that even after an hour it was still not cooked enough. I should have left it in for another 15-20mins.

This was great!!! I had been hunting for a rice dish I could fix in the oven and this is a keeper!  I did cut the butter in half as suggested by other members. I think next time, I'll add some fresh herbs and/or almonds/nuts of some kind to this, for color/texture, but this is great like it is! Thanks so much!  A keeper!

To me, this rice lacked flavor.  I feel it tasted better the second day as leftovers, maybe the flavors had time to settle in a little more.  I doubt I'll make it again, but if you like a milder flavored oniony rice, this might be for you. PS, I used brown rice and precooked it a little bit.  Maybe that wasn't a good idea.  We don't eat white rice, though.  Thanks!

I used liptons onion soup mix in place of the french onion soup and instant rice.  This was a great tasting and healthy side dish. Goes great with fish or chicken. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this for dinner last night. It turned out very well. Didn't have to cook longer and was not dried out. Left out basil but only because I was out of it, but followed recipe other than that. Might try basil next time or the oregano as another reviewer suggested. Loved the simplicity of cooking this

This recipe is almost identical to one that has been in my family for many years and everyone loves it. However, my recipe calls for oregano, not basil, so all those reviewers who had a problem with the basil might give oregano a try. I like the idea of adding a can of French Onion Soup (my recipe just calls for consomme).

I don't know why, but this did not work for me at all. My rice didn't cook at all... at 30 minutes it was still soupy, but I thought maybe it would thicken in the last 30 minutes. No such luck. I would have tried cooking it longer, but I tasted it after 1 hour and did not like the flavor at all, so I didn't bother trying to save it. It's a shame to waste all those ingredients. Sorry, but I don't think I'll try this again.

Way too salty and it felt like it was missing something.  Next time I will try to find some low sodium ingredients and maybe try adding some mushrooms.

Great!  A nice change from the everyday rice dishes.  I didn't include the dried basil leaves.

This recipe was fabulous. My family loved it. Based on other reviewer comments, I halved the butter and only put in a tsp. of basil. I also did not have an hour to bake it so I microwaved it for 6 min. and then baked for 30 min. Great recipe!

I love this recipe. I make it all the time. I always omit the basil and add seasoning salt instead.

The only reason I'm not giving this recipe a "1" is because I deviated on a few things.  I used brown rice instead of white, and added about a cup of mushrooms.  I  stirred the rice after thirty minutes, and checked it thirty minutes later.  It was still runny, so I took off the cover and baked it another 10 minutes.  The rice was crunchy (undercooked) and the onion flavor was overwhelming.  My husband said it tasted like tea-leaves (the basil, I assume).  Disappointing results; I won't make this again.

My wife and I really enjoyed this. I did add one chopped up mushroom, otherwise, I made just like the recipe.  Next time I would like to expermient with some additional seasonings. I thought it tasted even better the next day.

I didnt care for this dish but my husband enojyed it. I agree with other reviwers that the amount of basil should be greatly reduced.  I love basil and feel as though there was way too much. Thanks for the recipe,Monica.

Wonderful side dish.  I will make it again and experiment with it a little bit.  First, I would like to try adding chopped onions and maybe some type of vegetable. Trust me, this one is a keeper.
