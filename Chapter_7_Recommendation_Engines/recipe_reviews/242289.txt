I had everything for this recipe except for the Jamaican Jerk seasoning,so I used Creole seasoning instead. Fish was flavorful and easy to prepare. Next time I make this, I will try it with Jerk seasoning, but the preparation in itself,you could getaway with any favorite seasoning of your choice it would still turn out delicious.;)

I prepared the fish just as stated in the recipe. It came out great! I served the fish with pineapple to balance out the spiciness of the jerk seasoning.
