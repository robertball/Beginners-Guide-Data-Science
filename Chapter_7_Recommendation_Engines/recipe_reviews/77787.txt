I thought this was a really good beginning, GOURMETGUY. As did others, I added to it. More mushrooms (button), double the garlic, cumin and oregano, a can of pinto beans, a bit of tomato sauce and beef broth and some sauteed celery and green pepper  made for one hearty and delicious chili-like mushroomy dish, which went really well wih Corn Muffins I (also from this site) and honey butter the first night. Served the leftovers atop buttered egg noodles, and that was good, as well. Thanks for the recipe.

After making a few modifications this turned out beautifully!  I used one can each of kidney and black.  TONS of garlic and the usual chili ingredients:  carrots, celery and more tomatoes than it called for.  I used quite a few more seasonings also, some cajun etc. and cooked it in a dutch oven iron skillet.  Because of this I had to add more water at one point and ended up still cooking it for less than 40 mins (maybe 25?  can't really remember).  I also added ground turkey, though it didn't need it...the mushrooms were fantastic in it.  Next time would add lots more!  They made the chili!

This was very good, I did make a few changes - increased garlic to 5 cloves, added cumin, used black and kidney beans and plain diced tomatoes.  I served it over whole wheat egg noodles and topped with sour cream and a little mozzarella, it was a hit!  My boyfriend who is an avid meat eater didn't miss meat at all in it.

This was a great chili that was so different. I used 2 lbs of cremini mushrooms, slightly more chili powder and threw in at least a tbls of cumin. I loved the flavor and texture the mushrooms gave the chili.  Next time I may take thequalitycookdotcom's suggestion and add a green pepper.  Oh I served the leftovers with whole wheat egg noodles and it was great.  Thanks  for a great recipe!  I'm sure I will make it again.

Mushrooms are my favorite food, so I was excited to try this. I used about 5 different types of mushrooms, and added pinto beans, cilantro and fresh tomoatoes in addition to the canned. Yum! Thanks!

I thought this was pretty good.  I worried about having too much mushroom squishiness but it was a meaty flavor, and I liked it.  I served with cheddar sprinkled on top.

It was edible and my oldest daughter said it was 'decent'.  It wasn't horrible, but nothing to rave about.  Nobody would have seconds and I will not be making it again.

Sorry, but I did not care for this.  I should have known that before I tried it.  As a native Texan, I know chili and this ain't it.

This was a great chili that differs from the norm.  I used 2 lbs of baby bella mushrooms, added a chopped green pepper, used slightly more chili powder and threw in at least a tbls of cumin.  I actually cooked this in the crock pot and decided to add about half of a can of beef broth just to make sure it didn't dry out.  I will use this one again in the future - thank you for such a great recipe!

This was ok.  I think it needs more flavor and to be a bit thicker, it's very soupy for a chili.

Delicious!  I did add about 3/4 lb. browned ground beef and some tomato sauce, but the real star of this chili is the mushrooms.  Served this with cornbread muffins and it sure didn't last long!  Thanks for a great recipe.

this recipe is too good and its simple to prepare too.. For those who hate kidney beans, this recipe will be the best to attract those... few ingredients i added to this recipe, like, instead of 2 cloves garlic i added 5-6 which gives excellent flavor.and cumin powder-2 tsps , coriander powder -2tbs and chilli powder-1-2tbs..with few basil, oregano and rosemery which came out too good.. outof my expectations..My hubby liked this soo much..will definitely prepare it again.

I tried this recipe last night and loved it. Like others l added a few  more items. I only had stewed tomatoes, l used one onion, more garlic, more chili, more cayenne and added cumin. I also used cremini and white mushrooms along with the portobello. Then l added some celery and frozen corn oh and left over barbacued chicken. Then l served it over polenta. OMG!! Yum.

I used Rd Gold brand Italian-style diced tomatoes and did not like the Italian seasoning taste.  To sweet!  The only other seasoning taste was just mildly hot from the cayenne. I had to doctor up the whole thing.

I made this for my daughter and myself following the recipe exactly and we both enjoyed it. I think when making again though I would add in some celery and may be some green pepper as it felt like there was something missing. Still good though. Thanks.

This was very good! My grown daughter who doesn't really like chili called it "the best ever". Everyone had seconds. I served it with grated cheese and cornbread. But I did make a few changes- I used 6 cloves of garlic, added a can of black beans as other reviewers suggested, added 1/2 pound of shitakes that I had in the fridge and 1 pound of sausage so there would be some protein in there. Will definitely make again!

I was looking for a hearty dish and this hit the spot.  I added a cup of chicken broth and a little tabasco sauce for kick.  This was delicious and filling.

Excellent! This is the first time I've made non-meat chili, and it's surprisingly great! Invited a friend over to try it and she loved it enough to ask for the recipe. I served it with Texas toast, because I added a half can of water (the beans can)...it was rather thick. This recipe is definitely going in my book for future parties/dinner. Btw, I used pinto beans instead of kidney...excellent!

Very good as written. I omitted the cayenne pepper, but did everything else as written, except maybe cooking it longer. It turned out a bit soupy because I did not drain the tomatoes - you should drain them. Yummy and healthy.

This recipe is hearty, excellent for a cold winter day like today, and though non-traditional, mushrooms in chili really does work. My wife and I both enjoyed the flavor. Some recipes use portobello mushrooms as a substitute for meat. That may have been the idea that the designer of this recipe had in mind. I thought six mushroom caps sounded like a *lot* of mushrooms, but they do cook down and we really enjoyed the interesting flavor they  provided.

This was great as a base but needed a bit more.  I added more beans, zucchini, and a red pepper. Next time im going to try carrots and sweet potatoes. The seasoning was plain and needed cumin to round up that chili flavor.  Other wise this was a hit!

Very good and very easy to make, I had most of the ingredients on hand.  I also added the cumin as others recommended.
