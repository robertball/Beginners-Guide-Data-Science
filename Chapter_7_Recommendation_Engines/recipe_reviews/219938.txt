These were delicious! I cooked for 35 minutes in oven then cooked another 25 minutes basting and turning wings every 5 minutes or so. If you don't like a super-saucy wing (like my husband) they're perfect just like that. If you love extra sauce go crazy on top of that baked in flavor once they're done. Will definitely be making again. These aren't super-spicy as written but like the directions say it's easy to tweak the spiciness to your liking.

I made this recipe for a poker party. I found the recipe delicious and easy to make. I made it the day before and a warmed the day of the party in a crock pot. It worked great. Thanks for sharing.

The sauce didn't do much for me and the wings needed to bake longer.

This is a really good wing sauce recipe. I used Frank's buffalo sauce instead of the Red Hot flavor because I didn't want it to be super spicy and it was perfect! The sauce takes a long time to cook and I didn't notice that the first time I made this but it's worth the wait! The addition of a fresh orange is key don't leave it out!

Made this tonight and it was fabulous! My wife thought it was a bit too hot so might reduce the red peppers next time but I loved it as it was.
