Three Words:
OH MY GOODNESS!!!
Made this today (half recipe) and between 4 of us there is not one piece left.
I did add a slight touch of red food coloring to make it pinker.
Wondering if other frozen juices would have the same FABULOUS results?
Such as Margarita Mix, Grape Juice, Orange Juice, Guava Juice, etc.
I see myself experimenting with this one.
Comapny is coming tomorrow and I know this will be on the menu ...

Thanks WorkingMom2004 for a great, quick and easy dessert.

Because a lot of the reviews said the pie didn't hold it's shape, I eliminated the sweetened condensed milk and used 8 oz. of cream cheese and 1/3 c. white sugar instead.  I creamed those together, added the lemonade concentrate, and followed the rest of the recipe except I also thought it was better in just one pie crust.  Very good!

I made this recipe last night for a goign away party for two friends.  Everyone to had a slice loved it!  
I do have a suggestion though, make this pie the night before and put it in the freezer, it get firmer that way which adds to the goodness of the pie! ENJOY!

YES, YES, YES! Quick and easy hardly any mess. On my second time making this I made some changes that made all the difference. 1 – Add a few drops of Red Food color (like others did here) 2 – Don’t fold in the whip topping in…. get out your hand mixer and beat this bad boy till it gets fluffy and “spoons” into the pie shell. If it “pours” you didn’t beat it long enough. ?  I made several and they freeze nice. Make a bunch a head of time and keep in the freezer for parties and potlucks when you don’t have time to make anything… try putting a carton of fresh raspberries on top before serving for an added kick.  My next try I will use Bacardi Mixers (freezer section) – Pina Colada!

My grocery store only had frozen lemonade and limeade, but no pink lemonade, so I decided to try making this exactly as the recipe calls for, but using limeade. OH MY GOSH, IT MAKES THE PERFECT KEY LIME PIE! I couldn't believe it! For years I have been making a much more difficult key lime pie, and this super easy recipe tastes exactly like it! So, I will have to try the original recipe with pink lemonade, but I wanted to say thanks for helping me discover a super easy delicious way to make key lime pie from now on!

This is the same recipe my grandmother made me my whole life.  What I do is make the recipe twice (not double, make it separately twice), then I pour it into three pie crusts and give two away.

Was looking for a recipe a friend recommended a few years ago that was a no bake pink lemonade cheesecake. Add a brick of softened cream cheese to this one and VOILA! This has become a favorite at my house, both with family and when entertaining. I tried it without the cream cheese and didn't like it as much.

I left this pie in the freezer for a whole day prior to serving, and it was still runny.  I definitely recommend frezzing for at least 2 days to help it set.  The flavor was great, even still.

OH, SO EASY!!! And so delicious especially for a summer pie!  My nephews don't like pies much, but this was a HUGE hit and also with my family.  We even thought how creative this recipe could be using different juice concentrates.

Definitely freeze this, and definitely only let it thaw about 20-30 minutes before consuming.  Mine turned into a puddle and we ended up just scooping it out in clumps.  The taste was very good if you like tart, though.  I skipped the sweetened condensed and used 1 package of cream cheese and 1/4 cup sugar as some suggested.

I loved this as well and served it for Easter dessert. At the suggestion of others, I included cream cheese and whipped it a fairly long time with the pink lemonade concentrate and sweetened condensed milk.  I froze mine for a few hours prior to serving it.  I let it thaw for about 20 minutes and it was perfect in texture and taste.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe and helpful suggestions from others.

JUST WAY TOO EASY!!!!   YUMMY TOO!!!! My publix did not have or was out of pink lemonade- I ended up with limeade- after reading reviews regarding this pie not setting up I used a small pack of sugar-free lemon jello.  Add 1/4 cup hot water to 1 pack of jello- stir  to disolve and add to your mix- pie sets up like a champ- cream cheese will work too- but this was easier to mix and i was feeding it to people who are counting calories and sugar-free jello adds nothing-

I made this recipe, and it turned out perfectly! Instead of using two regular graham cracker crusts, I used "Keebler Ready Crust Mini Graham Cracker Pie Crusts." The mini pies made serving individuals easy, and they were very cute. Thank you!

This is the easiest dessert I have ever made.  I made it exactly as directed and put the pies in the freezer.  It was deliciously tart and sweet so I cut in thin slices.  Loved it.  I used Margarita (frozen) instead of the lemonade and I really loved this better.

Loved it.  I used a 10 inch crust (made by keebler) and the whole pie filling fit into it. I also added 4 drops of red food coloring to give it more color.  I made it the night before I served it and put it right into the freezer.  I took it out of the freezer 25 minutes before I served it and it held its shape.  It is worth making again.  It was tart so I would advise small slices.  MMM Good!

Pretty good.  The texture is nice but the pink lemonade is a bit too sour for me.  But over all it was good!

Tasty and refreshing!  Used 8 oz. of softened cream cheese and 1/3 cup sugar in place of the sweetened condensed milk.  Also used 10 oz. of thawed pink lemonade concentrate and added four drops of red food coloring.  Froze.  Mmmmm.

Good, but the recipe needs some adjustments.  The pie(s) simply do not setup properly.  Also, there is barely enough filling to shallowly fill 2 crusts (although, the filling is rich, and the flavor goes along way).  After reading the other reviews, I froze my pie(s).  It resulted in a creamy, rich, sweet and tart dessert that held it's shape on the plate.  I also followed another's advice and added a few drops of red food coloring in order to develop a more appealing pink shade for the cake.  Next time, I may elimate the sweetened condensed milk and follow yet another suggestion and use blended cream cheese and powdered sugar.  Or...a small cafe that I know makes a layered lemon cream pie...this recipe may give me the basis to attempt my own creation of that.

The only thing I did different was to use crushed nilla waffers in the botton of dessert cups and then line the sides with whole waffers and one on top. This is a recipe that has been in my family for years and always a summer favorite. I might add that when this recipe was written years ago they made 6oz cans of juice, I have found that to be no longer so

I have made this pie many times over the last 25+ years.  It always gets rave reviews!  Several other reviewers said it was too sweet and only makes one full pie or t half filled.  My variation is to double the pink lemonade concentrate and double the whipped topping.  This makes the output enough for two pies, while cutting the sweetness.  I agree it is best if frozen for several hours before serving.  Enjoy!

Awesome dessert idea.  However, the only size can of lemonade concentrate available in my market was a 10 ounce can.  I used that and, based on previous reviews, I just used a 10 inch crust and it filled it up nicely. I also froze it overnight based on previous reviews.  I think it needs to be frozen and pulled out about 30 minutes before serving.

I made this for a family get-together and there were NO leftovers.  

Some red food coloring would have made it really nice and pink, but I didnt have any.  It still tasted awesome.

Tastes great! I split the pie into 2 graham cracker crusts, but found it too shallow. I also added a bit of red food coloring, and for decoration I sliced one lemon and let the slices soak in water with red food coloring overnight and used as decoration around the edge of the crust (don't put them on too early, or the juice will melt the pie).

Easy as pie....

This was delicious and I will make it again.  I did have to make adjustments in the ingredients because we seem to have diff. sized containers of these ingredients in Canada and of course they are measured in metric.  It was, however, worth the effort. Thanks for the taste treat!

This is such an easy and versatile pie. I make as directed except I chill the can of milk in the refrigerator and whip the chilled milk and the Cool-whip together first until thick, then I gently fold in the lemonade concentrate until blended. When I do this, the pie sets really well in just a few hours in the freezer. I make my own graham cracker crust and pre-bake in the oven (I do this the day before). I take out about 15 minutes before serving so I can slice through the filling (how long you let sit out depends on how hot it is in the house). I use the pink lemonade concentrate and unless you add some red food coloring it's not pink at all, more like a light blush.

I make this with both the pink lemonade and the limeade and my family loves it so much that my brother-in-law dubbed it "FamilyPie."

This was super easy and delicious!  Be careful to read the instructions.  It calls for 1 8 ounce can of frozen pink lemonade concentrate.  I checked the size of the pink lemonade can and one can is 16 ounces.  If you use 8 ounces as directed it is not very pink, but it has a great balance of tart and sweet.  More than 8 ounces would be too much, I think.

1-15-2010 Very good pink lemon icebox pie.  Can add 1 cup of nuts and juice from 1/2 lemon. I add pink food coloring to brighten it.  Great to carry somewhere because it makes 2 pies.

I grew up eating this and making this.Always delicious and always a hit.Make according to recipe and you won't have any problems,except you may run out of pie before you get a piece.
If you make it during extreme hot weather...yep it will run but it is still delicious.

So good - yet so simple. My local supermarket did not have pink lemonade - so I used regular lemonade concentrate. Took it to work for a pot luck luncheon. No leftovers. I did put it in the freezer for a couple of hours as suggested and I had no problems. It held it's shape just fine.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!

After filling the first pie shell, I found the filling way too shallow (only about half full) so I put it all into one and it was the perfect amount. I made it the night before and let it sit in the fridge. By dinnertime the next day it had set very nicely. A little too sweet for my boyfriend but I enjoyed it.

This pie was very light and tasty.  Great on a hot summer day.  Didn't want to firm up as much as I would have liked.  Would recommend putting in freezer or maybe buying the graham cracker individual crusts to help it keep its shape.  Will make this again.  Everyone loved the fresh taste.

Found this same Recipe on another Recipe site.  They recommended using the Frozen Lemonade, still frozen and chilling the sweetened condensed milk before mixing anything.  They then have you gently fold the sweetened condensed milk into the thawed whipped topping , and then gently folding in the Frozen Lemonade to avoid the mixture from getting too liquid-y.  They then poured filling into the Graham Cracker Crust and froze it over night so it would set! I tried this, and it set up fine, even in our current very hot weather!

I loved the creativity of this pie, but when I made it (EXACTLY as the recipe instructed), my fiance and I both agreed that the end result was too sour. Maybe we used the wrong brand lemonade concentrate or something, but it was really really sour. I had garnished our pie with pink-colored sweetened coconut shavings, so at least I can say the pie was pretty :)

Yum!  I could eat the whole pie myself!  But I thought it was going to turn out pink, but it didin't.  So I will put food coloring in it next time.  And I will leave it in the freezer because it gets melty quick.  Now I want to try limeade pie.

I've made this for years. So easy and delicious on a hot summer day! I top it with slices of fresh strawberries to make it pretty and also just 'cos everything's better with a few strawberries on top! Can be frozen and kept on hand for drop-in company.

Very lemony!!  Is that a word?  Had to freeze it over-night for firmness.  I loved it but rest of the family left it alone.  I LOVE lemons though!  Not the worst by far.

ok so it's refreshing and easy. But it doesn't stay firm. It was still liquid after being in frig all night and trying one in the freezer also. Maybe try half of concentrate?

This is an okay pie but has great potential to be great with some changes. It is very sweet so reduce the amount of milk and add lemon juice. I added 4 tbls of lemon juice for the second pie. I also found that the recipe fits for one pie crust only. I  left my pies in the freezer overnight and served cold like an icecream pie. This helped with the cutting and serving. Some liked it and others politely finished their servings.

Good pie.  I added 3 drops of red food color to give it a nice pink color  and a sprinkle of sugar to ease the tartness.  I think dissolving a packet of unflavored gelatin  in the lemonade and then mixing in the sweetened condensed milk and cool whip would help the pie set properly.

after reading reviews, and because I had 9in graham crusts, I doubled it and made only 2 pies. The flavor was excellent, everyone loved it, but I was a bit dissappointed that it didn't set more firmly & I even put in the freezer for a few hours - when cut, it didn't hold its shape, so you got a blob of great tasting pie. I think I'd reduce the amount of sw.c.milk next time.

If your pie is runny it's because you mixed the whipped topping in instead of folding. You have to fold it carefully with out popping the air bubbles in the whipped cream.

Love this recipe. So simple and delicious. I did substitute 1 pack Pink Lemonade Kool-Aid mix in place of the frozen pink lemonade and I only had to refrigerate it about an hour. It stayed together nicely and tasted great. Will be making many more times !

This is a great no bake recipe, especially for a hot summer day when you don't want to turn the oven on.  You definitely have to freeze this for it to set.  Everyone loved it and there were no leftovers.  Definitely recommended.

I originally found this recipe through my Grams, and it's not entirely correct. You should honestly freeze it or it will be runny. If you want a more cheesecake-feel, add creamcheese and sugar in lieu of condensed milk. I've been making this since well before 2000 and not once have I ever had a runny pie, let alone a single complaint. It's versatile as well. You can use whatever juice is available and trust me, it's gonna be good.

My mom always made this pie.  Make sure you look at the size of the pink lemonade, minutemaid is 12 oz. My pie was a little runny because of this.  I found the recipe only made on pie as others have said.  A couple of drops of red food coloring gives it a pretty pink color. Yummy!

Easy. Delicious. Nuff said right? It's fairly runny following the directions. We kept both in the freezer and snacked on them all week. Pretty tart and sweet, which we found delicious.

I make this pie ALL the time and I only use HALF a can of the Pink lemonade concentrate and that helps the pie to be a little firmer and sweeter. Also, I always try to make it 24hours in advance (yum)!

This is a lovely pie, so glad I found the recipe again! I garnish mine with freshly sliced strawberries and add one fanned out in the center. I use the canned milk, but cut it back to 3/4 of a can and it's still plenty, especially with the addition of strawberries!

This is so easy, you'd have to really TRY to mess it up.  It's a little droopy though, in southeast Texas heat/humidity.  So I added an 8 ounce brick of cream cheese to it, to firm it up a bit, and a few drops of red food coloring to make it a deeper pink.  Gives it a little bit of a cheesecake flavor too.  If two are too many, Freeze one of them for up to a month ~

Served this with mixed reviews, "too puckery" even for my lemon-loving 9 year old.  Friend from work says try basic recipe using Pina Colada frozen mix instead of pink lemonade.  "Is delish"

My girlfriend and I made SEVERAL of these pies, when our kids were young! We successfully tried other juices: regular lemonade, orange juice, grape juice, and limeade.  We even froze the pies.  Fabulous fun!  I'm thinking cranberry juice would even work (it wasn't available that many years ago-ha!)

REFRESHING! This is a great cookout dessert or pool side dessert. I would reccomend chilling it in the freezer. I didn't have any problem with it setting up in the fridge, but I put one in the freezer and we liked the texture of the frozen one much better!

My Grandmother made this pie many years ago and was one of my favorites. I lost the recipe and have been looking for it for awhile. It is so easy and takes no time at all to make. I am making this for a camping group get together. Pink Lemonade makes a cool and refreshing  pie.

This was absolutley delicious and it reminded me of a fresh keylime pie on a hot summer day. I filled up an already baked pie crust and stored the left overs in a small custard cup.

Absolutely fabulous! I made my own graham cracker crust, then doubled the recipe and poured it into a large cake pan. Only thing is, it gets gooey fast, so maybe some unflavored gelatin to help it set better. But the flavor was really good--made it for a sorority event and everyone loved it!

This recipe needs adjustments.  Not enough lemon taste - maybe more than 6 ounces.  I think the suggestions of cream cheese instead of condensed milk is a good idea because it is just too sweet.

I didn't like this one at all!  Far too sweet.  It turned out lots firm enough but lacked flavour.  All I could taste was SWEET!  Perhaps it is the Canadian conversion that is the problem, I don't know.  Will NOT make again.
