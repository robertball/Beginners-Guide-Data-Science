These are great! Very flavorful and also very quick and easy to make. I used a small can of jalapenos instead of fresh ones, and it turned out great! They are quite spicey though. I think next time I might try using a can of green chilis instead, or half and half to make them a little milder. Also, I had to bake them for quite a lot longer than the recipe called for in order for them to be cooked through the center.

My crowd loved these!  I made them in my mini muffin tins for a little quiche look & they went over very well.  I used about 3/4 c. of flour and added about 1/4 tsp. of salt.  I also didn't deseed my jalapenos because I wanted that "kick", but they weren't as hot as I thought they would be.  Next time I will use a habenaro along with the jalapenos and maybe add some salsa too, but I will use again, thanks Dinah!

Very good basic recipe.  After reading the reviews I added 1/2 cup more flour and three tablespoons of salsa.  I used minced onion as it was what i had and a combination of skim milk and buttermilk and omitted the water.  Turned out awesome with lots of flavor.  Thank you

there wasn't a lot of flavour to this recipe - and it flopped at a recent party.  The sour cream only added fat grams and calories.  If you're wanting some flavour and pizazz keep on looking.

These were just flavorless and the texture was like rubber.  I used frest jalapenoes.  Pickled ones would have probably been better.  Not enough heat with fresh ones.  I ate about 2 or 3 and chunked the rest.

A very basic and plain recipe but very good. Use gloves when cutting the jalepenos. These are spicy.  I served them with sour cream and salsa to dip them in. Helps to cool it down.

This was quick and easy but a bit greasy (it may have been the cheese I used).  But my husband LOVED it and there were hardly any left at the party we had so I would say it was a hit!

I made these in mini muffin pans and it made 72. Instead of the jalapenos I used a can of green chiles. They were good but a little too bland, even though I put some Pepper Jack cheese in with the cheddar. Next time I will use more Pepper Jack and two cans of green chiles to see if that helps. Also, I added about 1/3 cup more flour so they wouldn't be so quiche-like.

They tasted just fine, but people I served to commented that it tasted like an omelet cut into squares.  Unremarkable to them.

I added extra cheese (too little to store) and had some tomatoes for color. Because of the extra cheese it didn't come out as "squares" but still tasty. I probably wouldn't serve this to children unless they are daredevils.

Yum!  I used 1 less egg and 1/2 cup extra flour to make it less "quiche-ey" and it was a good vegetarian dinner when paired with veggies on the side.

Mmmm! I am giving it 4 stars purely because I can't see cutting this into squares and serving it like that. It's too "pie-ish" in consistancy. But I tell ya, I served it warm with salsa and sour cream on the side and it was awesome! This is an awesome appetizer as a jalapeno cheese pie! I did use about 6 jalapeno peppers as well, and it was great, not overly hot! I love this!

This was good.  I added some garlic salt to the  mix, and I didn't miss the margarine at all.  This does taste quiche-like, but like someone else said, it wasn't spectacular.  This ended up being about 1/2" thick.  It was a nice recipe to try out, but I doubt I'll make this again.

Easy to make 'hot' appetizer. I used canned jalepenos instead of fresh. Delicious.

We felt pretty neutral about these, although people at the party we took them to said they loved them.  They tasted a little flat, no kick from the jalapenos.  Next time we're going to try it with diced green chiles.  Definite potential.

I thought they were delicious, but no one else did in the family gathering. They said that they had an odd texture,and too spicy...I guess I won't make it again :(

The flavor was good, but they really did taste like an omelet cut into squares. I think I would either cut the egg or add more flour the next time I make them. I like the idea of adding green chiles. I thought the spice was perfect (I used jarred sliced jalapenos).

Everyone seemed to love this.  It turned into a kind of quiche, but with a slight bite to it.  I think this needs a little bit of extra spice.

It was nice but a little too fluffy for me.  Was looking for something more dense and cheesy.  Nice and spicy hot though.

These were great.  We took them to a potluck.  Just a bit of spice.  They would be good for breakfast with some fried potatoes.

I had these at a Superbowl party, and they were delicious!  My husband loved them as well.  I felt guilty eating them, so I think I'm going to try a lighter version, reduced fat cheese, evaporated skim milk, light butter.  We'll see.  Some dishes don't translate well to low fat.

I lost my original hand written recipe for these - I think they came from the St Petersburg Times (Florida). Delicious as is! Not spicy as written.
