Used milk. Liked it but there was too much cream cheese filling for me.would reduce amount and make it less rich.
Refrigerated left over and reheated next day. Very good

It was very good. Straight forward to make. Everyone liked it. Tooks a little bit longer to brown the top than suggested. Maybe a bit more cinnamon next time to bring that flavor forward.
