The absolutely BEST Cherry Pie I have ever made. We have our own cherry tree. I pit them using an opened paper clip which is very easy using larger end of clip. Seed pulls out easily. Do not lose as much juice. Then I freeze a quart (4 cups) to a bag with 1/2 cup sugar and a sprinkle of fruit fresh. Then thaw and use as wanted. I used the 1 cup sugar in the recipe, so made it sweeter and used only 1/8 tsp each almond and vanilla flavorings. I made this pie using the Best Ever Pie Crust on this site using only 6 Tbs of ice water. I always brush the bottom crust with slightly beaten egg white before adding filling and start out baking a two crust pie at 450 degrees for 10 minutes then turn down to 350 to 375 for another 30 minutes or until the juices bubble up through the vents. Just superb! Sets up perfectly. Never have to look for any different recipe for cherry pie again. Rave reviews from family.

Just moved to a home with cherry trees in the backyard, so I had buckets of fresh cherries and no idea how to use them. I tried this recipe with and without the tapioca, and got rave reviews with both. Use the tapioca if you like your pie more firm; if not, then it's a little more wet. 

I didn't have a cherry pitter, so my husband came up with a great, cheap solution after seeing me pitting the cherries with a knife (very tedious, and it halves the cherries which doesn't like as nice as whole cherries in the pie): plastic straws, like the kind you get at any fast food place. Hold the cherry in one hand and gently push the straw throught the top of the cherry until you feel the pit. Gently push the pit through the bottom of the cherry. Do this over a bowl to catch the pits and the juice; put the pitted cherry in another bowl.

Yummy! I've made this twice now. The second time I used 1 1/4 cup of sugar instead of only 1 cup and I think it was better. My secret to a fabulous crust is to use cake flour for 1/2 of the flour required. Cake flour has less Gluten so the crust is very tender. I also use half butter/Half Crisco for the fat measurement. My crusts are always wonderful!

I made this for Thanksgiving and there was no availablity for fresh cherries, however I found some very good frozen cherries that I used instead.  It still turned out great.  I found that I had to use an extra cup of the frozen cherries and I did drain out the juice from thawing.  It wasn't too runny and it tasted divine!

This recipe is so easy & yummy!  It is worth taking the time to pit fresh cherries.  Alternative natural taste insead of using tapioca: Mash cherries & add 1/4 cup water so that the cherry liquid equals 3/4 cup, Add smashed cherry liquid to a small pan with 2 1/2 Tbls Cornstarch, 1 cup of white sugar, 1/8 tsp salt.  Cook, stirring constantly until it thickens/gels for 2-3 minutes.  Add the extracts, before you pour into pie shell.

This is a fairly standard cherry pie recipe. The pastry is very good. However, the addition of vanilla to the cherries gives the pie a commercial taste that negates the fresh cherries. I also prefer a runny pie to the gloppy one produced by the instant tapioca. Keep it simple!

This is a good fresh cherry pie recipe.  I find if I refrigerate the bottom crust, pie plate and all, that I don't get a soggy crust.  Also always use a deep dish pie plate for fruit pies.  Would recommend this recipe for novice bakers and those who have been at it for a while.  Bake on ladies!!

My husband and I have 4 cherry trees and this year I decided to make a pie from them.  This recipe is amazing, my husband, a pie lover, said this was the best cherry pie he had ever had. I do recommend that you increase the almond extract to 1/2 tsp and the vanilla extract to 1 tsp. If you are going to take the trouble to pit the cherries then take the time to make the crust as well.  I used the Butter Flakey Pie Crust recipe by Dana  And if you have the means try to use very fine butter like Plugra (European butter, it comes in a 1 lb brick in a red wrapper) you can find it at Trader Joes, believe me IT DOES make a difference.

this was my first attempt at making a cherry pie and it turned out amazing! tart cherries weren't available yet, so i used sweet. i was warned that sweet cherries have a tendency to result in "cherry pie soup", but the tapioca kept that from happening. i used the crisco pie crust recipe, which worked well with this. the almond and vanilla were a nice addition - the sweet cherries might have been a little dull without that little touch. thanks! i can't wait to make it again.

Fabulous Recipe! I've been using this recipe for years now and have always gotten compliments on this pie! If you like almond, feel free to double the almond extract, it is delicious. 
A few hints: Taste your cherries! If they are sweet, 1 C sugar is more than enough, if not, you may need to double the sugar; If you don't have a cherry pitter, use a plastic straw; if you don't have tapioca then just leave it out, all the other thickener subs make it taste funny; put a pinch of sugar into your sweet pie crusts, it ties the filling and crust together better; Use 1/2 crisco and 1/2 butter in your pie crusts, makes it easier to handle and helps it from getting tough if you overmix the crust; When greasing/spraying the pie dish, grease underneath the rim so when the pie drips in comes off easier

I made this cherry pie last night and it was delicious beyond belief or description.  I followed the recipe except that I didn't have the almond extract so I doubled the vanilla. I added a teaspoon of lemon juice too because I was concerned that my cherries were too sweet.  I have read tart cherries are the best and that they have a short season.  Mine were delicious raw so I figured they had to be on the sweet side so I added the lemon juice for tartness which I read was the answer to that problem. Two packages of cherries equalled a generous 4 cups pitted.  I had a tough time finding tapioca because I didn't realize all I needed was the Minute Tapioca by Kraft.  Somehow I thought tapioca starch was a different product.  I made a basket weave crust, brushed it with egg whites and sprinkled it with an extra large grain decorative sugar crystals. The sugar was gorgeous and made the top sparkle.  I loved the texture it added to the final product as well.  I made a foil crust guard which I never took off and the crust was nicely browned.  It might have been due to the sugar topping.  I put a cookie sheet under the pie but it did not drip one little bit. I cooled it on a rack and cut it about 1 and 1/2 hour later.  It was by far the best cherry pie I have ever eaten.  My husband was blown away by it too.  It was just so special.  It sliced perfectly too. Even the first slice was magazine perfect.  We served it with vanilla ice cream.  I can't say enough good about this recipe.

Simple and delicious.  Paired with a homemade crust, this pie is everything a fresh fruit pie should be.  My cherries were very tart, so I combined them with the sugar and let them chill overnight before baking.  If you don't have tapioca, try substituting cornstarch.  The pie will set up just fine after it cools.  I would suggest serving this topped with fresh whipped cream or real vanilla bean ice cream.  It doesn't get any better than this!

This recipe turned out so good i am afraid to make it again for it will not be as good! This was my first cherry pie to make. I did not use tapioca instead used cornstarch same amount. I made this pie for my husband's birthday and everyone who had a piece couldn't believe how good it was. I used a vineager crust recipe which is light and flaky.  I also brushed the bottom crust with egg white and also cooked for 10 min at 425 then reduced heat to 350 as mentioned in another review.    It truly was a picture perfect piece of cherry pie! I will always use this recipe!

I bake quite a bit, and this IS a good recipe.  Some tips:  I used fresh cherries that were tart and I will use 1/2c MORE sugar next time.  A couple people actually asked for the sugarbowl.  We like our pies on the tart side, so another 1/2c wouldn't make it overly sweet.  I wouldn't recommend using all of the juice either.  I used what I thought looked right, and it took overnight before it set enough to not be runny.  I always use a deep dish 10"x2 1/2"deep pie dish, and I used 1 1/2 times the recipe.  Never ran over - perfect!
Baked at 400 for 15 min, then 375 for the rest of 50 min. Just had to loosely cover the last 5 min.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe!  Thanks - I'll keep this one!

This is a GREAT pie.  I add an extra cup of fruit (either frozen raspberry or cranberry to give it a nice tang) and add about a tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg. I eliminated the almond extract because it gives the cherry that 'artificial' cherry flavor, which I don't enjoy.  I have been obsessed with cherry pie since I first tasted this recipe, and am making it yet again.  Mmmm!!!

Awsome! I really have never cared for cherry pie because it's usually sour. This one is fantastic. No tapioca in the house so I used corn starch as another reviewer suggested. 

I also set the pie pan with the bottom crust in the freezer about 10 minutes. No soggy crust! (I had no idea that would work so well)

I did forget about the butter since this is the first cherry pie I've ever made. We have two cherry trees and I simply didn't want to waste any.

Turned out great. I love sweet cherry pie! I made the mistake of not getting the quick-cooking tapioca, and being unfamiliar with tapoica's properties I didn't soak it overnight. So I had little tapioca balls in my filling. I don't know if they had any part in the thickness of the filling, since they did not dissolve, but if they didn't, the filling was pretty thick without them. VERY YUMMY... Everyone who had some, loved it!

Delicious! I used 1/4c flour instead of the tapocia. I also decreased the sugar to 3/4c as the fresh cherries I was using were pretty sweet. Overall it turned out fantastic! I only cooked it 40 minutes instaed of 50.

My first Cherry Pie. Simply awesome. A cherry pitter (tool) was much easier than using a knife to pit each cherry. I will definitely make this again!

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH for this wonderful recipe. A definite keeper. Delicious simple and soooo delicate. I used frozen dark sweet cherries as I could not find fresh cherries. I also used the Best Ever Pie Crust recipe from this site. Wonderful!!! I am amazed.

This pie was okay, but it lacked the 'WOW' factor I was expecting after reading all the glowing reviews. I didn't like the tapioca element as it made the filling very firm and not juicy at all. Would not make it again.

The only reason I am rating this 4 stars is because I have never baked a cherry pie before and have no idea how challenging it should be.  For example, I pitted the cherrires myself and didn't find it a to be an exciting process, however, the results were FANTASTIC!!! I used tart pie cherries fresh from the farmers market and was determined to create something special with them.  This recipe did the trick.  The only addition I made was to add about 2 teaspoons of cognac to the filling.  It added an elegant dimension to the dessert.  The filling had just the right amount of thickness to it: not runny, but not jelled like some other cherry pies I have tasted.  I will makes this one again next summer when the cherries are fresh.  My boyfriend loved it!

My first attempt at a fresh cherry pie, and this turned out (almost) perfect!  I was using sweet cherries, so I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup, and realized at the last minute that I didn't have any almond extract, so I left it out.  Brushed the bottom crust with egg before filling it, and brushed the top crust with egg and dusted it with sugar.  I also followed Fabricgal's tip to bake the pie at 450 for 10 minutes, and then decrease the temp to 350-375 for 30 minutes.  

Overall, the bottom crust was a little soggy (will have to try chilling the crust in the pie plate before adding the filling next time), and it was a little runny, even with the tapioca - I'm guessing it was because I used sweet cherries.  But it tasted GREAT, and the juice was a great addition to the vanilla ice cream I also put on the plate.  :)  

Side note - a chopstick works great in a pinch for a cherry pitter.  A straw would work great, but I didn't have any that were heavy enough.

Followed recipe as written and it turned out pure cherry soup. Seriously, it was 1/2" of cherry water in my 1" pie pan. I used about 2 1/2 lbs of sweet cherries. Positively didn't skip any ingredients. I let it cool thoroughly. Maybe my cherries were extra watery, maybe my tapioca wasn't the right stuff. Maybe a day of refrigeration will tighten it up to something manageable. But the whole thing will still be a soggy mess.

OK, so we have a cherry tree in our backyard and my husband kept saying "boy I bet those would make a good pie" After numerous 'hints' I decided to try it. I read the reviews for this pie and thought it sounded good, so I picked a bucket full of cherries and got to work. (Keep in mind, I've NEVER made a homemade pie in my life.) 

I used the staw method mentioned by some on this site to pit the cherries. This worked great for me! I put the cherries in one bowl and the pits in a strainer over a second bowl to catch any juice.

I used 1 1/4 cups sugar since my cherries were very tart. I also brushed the crust with a beaten egg white and sprinkled sugar on top. I thought that 4 cups cherries sounded like a lot, but I used that anyway. My pie ran over a bit, but it tasted YUMMY. 

I served this pie to my family after Sunday dinner today and I got rave reviews. For a first ever homemade pie, I thought it was great, if I may say so, myself!

If I can make this pie, anyone can. Now I have been instructed by my whole family to go pick more cherries to freeze, so I can make more later!!!

this is a great recipe. I have found that it is easiest to pit cherries simply by holding them (over a bucket to catch the juice and throw them into) in my left hand, slice the top with your thumbnail, and squeaze the bottom of the cherry between the fingers of your right hand, the pit pops out, any juice lost goes into the bucket, to be used in the cooking. Also, cornstarch seems to work as well as tapioca to thicken.

Look no further!! This is the best recipe for homemade cherry pie.  A cherry pitter makes this job simple.  Everyone raved about this pie.  Thank you for such a great recipe.

A truly delicous cherry pie with simple and uncomplicatd flavors which is the hallmark of any good fruit pie, IMO.  I used very sweet fresh cherries so cut back on the sugar which was a mix of brown and white.  Also left out the almond extract.      Next time I will try the frozen pitted cherries if I can find them.  Loved the taste of fresh - the pitting process, not so much.

Hubby wanted a cherry pie in the middle of winter.  I couldn't find any fresh cherries, so I used canned tart cherries.  It was still delicious.  I can only imagine how good it is with fresh cherries.  Other than that change, I used cornstarch in place of the tapioca because that is what I had and omitted the almond (nut allergies).  It was great and easy and it held up well, not too runny!  Will definitely make again.

Pretty decent, would have been better if only I had the patience to pit the cherries myself.  I also found it only took 35 minutes (and not 50min) to get golden brown.

Now that cherry season is over, the four pies I made turned out great.  One thing I did different was the baking temp and time.  Like my apple pies, I like when the fruit is softer.  I turned the temp to 425 for like 15 minutes, then down to 375 until the filling bubbles and the crust looked done.  Cook it too fast and the cherry skins are still too tough for my taste.

I spent $30 buying fresh cherries as they were only available imported, and this was supposed to be the highlight of a very important Thanksgiving dinner.  I spent ages on it, what with pitting the cherries and making the crust from scratch, and the only thing I changed was that I used 4 tbsp cornstarch instead of the tapioca.  Since another reviewer had done this as well, I thought it wouldn't be a problem. When I took the pie out of the oven, it looked fantastic.  I left it to cool.  When I cut it, I found to my horror that the filling had turned into cherry soup.  I had to pour a cup of liquid out before I could even serve it, and by then the beautiful crust was shrunken and hollow, not to mention soggy.  Four tablespoons of cornstarch was FAR from enough for four cups of fruit.  I have made fruit pies many times before and they have never turned out so badly.  This disappointment ruined my entire night.

Today I'll be baking the 2nd pie from this recipe for this week.  It is the best cherry pie we've ever had, and it is one of the easiest to make.  There is nothing I would change about this recipe.  I used the frozen pie cherries (unsweetened - just cherries) and it worked out very well.  I took the advice of another viewer and added an extra cup because they were frozen.  I've GOT to find a source for fresh cherries.  Thanks so much for sharing this one.  I have no reason to look for another recipe.

I've only made this once so far and it was super easy and super yummy!!

I actually goofed when I made this and forgot to add the sugar (long story) but even with NO sugar this was a very yummy pie!!! When I make this again, I will be sure to add sugar, but maybe only a 1/2 cup since the pie was perfect with out the sugar too.

Baked a cherry pie for the first time in my life last week.  I used fresh cherries from our cherry tree and followed this recipe.  I have not been a fan of the store bought cherry pies so I was just making the pie for my husband because he likes cherry pies, but after using this recipe with our very own cherries I am now a fan!  This recipe was so easy to follow and came out tasting wonderful.  My husband was not keen on the recipe when I told him it would contain tapioca, but he raved about the pie so much after he tasted it that I am making a second pie right now as I type this!  I will be passing this recipe down in my family.  It's a winner!   Oh, also, my husband took the pits out of the first batch of cherries by squeezing the cherries.  After reading a few hints on this site, I tried using the paper clip method on this batch of cherries and that way was clearly the winner.  It saved more of the juices and more of the shape/firmness of the cherry.  Thanks for sharing that tip!

No changes here. Another way to get cherry pits out is to use a chop stick with a straw. Cut off a few inches of straw and place on end of chopstick. push, twist and there ya go...

Yum! I used sweet cherries and substituted about 1/4 cup of white sugar for brown sugar, just because I like the depth that brown sugar gives. I used the Butter Flaky Pie Crust and only cooked the pie for about 40 minutes, but it was delicious.

Yum!!!!! I accidentally didn't buy enough fresh cherries, so I used 2 1/3 cup pitted fresh cherries and used frozen strawberries to fill the rest. Mixed the fruits together, added a bit of water and about 2 tbsp. cornstarch and cooked the fruit on the stovetop until thickened, about 10 minutes. The added vanilla and almond really make it great; they're subtle but they add so much. Wonderful!

Having never made a pie before (and failing to consult my mom first), I didn't know why the tapioca was necessary (I dislike the taste of tapioca & another reader said she didn't use it & it turned out fine).  Needless to say my pie was SOUPY, but my tasters raved about my "cherries jubilee" :)  The fresh cherries made all the difference!  I pitted them with an unused, clean air-pump needle (for filling a volleyball, for example) as the straw & paperclip ideas didn't work too well for me.  It worked amazingly well!  I inserted the needle into the opening from the stem, loosened up the pit by circling around it, then popped it out from the other side...very little juice was lost and the knob on the other end was a great grip!

I made this for my father for Father's Day. I had never made a pie before and it turned out excellent! Like someone else suggested I used 1 1/4 cups sugar. It came out perfect! Thanks! My father said it was the best he's ever had and he's a big pie fan :)

I made this pie with rainier cherries that I had canned this summer. I was not impressed. The pie looked beautiful, but didn't have much flavor. Maybe this was because I didn't use fresh cherries, I dunno... I may try it again sometime with fresh cherries, but probably not.

Excellent!  I used fresh cherries and a pitter from Williams-Sonoma (saves so much time and effort!!!).  Perfect texture!  Very important to let the tapioca sit in the moist bowl for a full fifteen minutes!

I made two of these pies today and froze the mixture for a third. One was made for a neighbor, I used one teaspoon of almond extract and no vanilla. I also used half sugar and half Stevia, I baked at 395 degrees for 50 minutes and they were perfect, I pitted the tart cherries off of our tree with my husband, a first for both of us, Amazing, thank you!

Awesome, fresh & amazing. It's worth pitting all those cherries (I now purchased a cherry pitter). I hate canned cherry pie so this was a real treat. I followed the recipe completely with no subs. Thanks for the recipe.

I think I have made this 3 or four times this summer.  Easy and delicious.  Yes, you do need to wait for it to sit and cool for a few hours.  If you do the pie sets up beautifully.

I reduced the sugar.

I haven't tried making a fruit pie before..but I had picked up the last of local sour cherries and decided that I couldn't eat 6L of it fresh myself, something must be done! 
This recipe turned out wonderful..but the almond and vanilla flavouring I agree, kind of makes it taste like the fake cherry pie grocery store pies.  I would leave it out next time so I can taste the real fresh cherries.  I used a straw to pit the cherries, which were quite small.  I found the cherries to eat fresh not really tart at all (fresh raspberries are more tart) but I was suprised that even after adding the recommeded mount of sugar that the cherries now tasted more sour? Whaat?! Either way, I liked it! On to raspberry pie next!

My first ever made from scratch pie and it was delicous! After reading some of the reviews I was worried it would be too runny so I used 5 TBL of the tapioca instead of 4 and it was perfect.

This recipe is very delicious! Just a tip do not omit the almond extract. I made this twice, and the first time I made this I didn't have any almond extract. So I just added more vanilla extract, it turned out good but you could tell something was missing. I went out and got almond extract to try again and it made the pie soooo much better.

Baked this pie this afternoon; I had both sweet and pie cherries in the freezer; used 2 cups of each for this pie.    Hubby and son both state this is the BEST cherry pie I have ever made; this recipe is definitely a keeper!  I just mixed the sweet and pie cherries together, along with the tapioca and sugar and let the cherries defrost for about 30 minutes, before placing in crust and baking.  YUMMY!

This was the first cherry pie I've ever baked, and it turned out beautifully.  I made a few changes, just because I had to work with frozen cherries instead of fresh:  used ~7c fruit, and reduced ~4c of it in a saucepan to 1.5c before mixing into the filling.  I also added a grated Granny Smith apple for body, and reduced the tapioca to 2T, since some reviewers commented that the pie wasn't juicy enough.  Also omitted the vanilla.  Consistency and taste were perfect!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Delicious. I have a ten inch pie plate so I used about 5 cups of cherrys and a little more sugar and tapioca. Oh and I forgot to add the butter but it turned out fine anyway. Let's just call it the lower calorie recipe..??

This was a nice cherry pie recipe.  The taste of fresh cherries surely beats the canned ones.  I will use this one in the future for sure.  The taste is not as overly sweet as canned cherries are and the pie was super tasting. A real keeper this is!

If I could, I would rate this 10 stars... It was delicious, I only made a couple changes... I did not add the almond extract, due to nut allergies, and I cooked the filling in the microwave for a couple minutes before putting into the crust! My mom use to make the best cherry pies in the world! This is close to hers or might even have it beat by a little. Making my second one as my brother is coming to visit and loved Mom's cherry pie...

This is a really great recipe!! It was my first attempt of cherry pie and it turmed out fantastic!! One thing I would reccomend is to let people know that if they have sweet cherries, they should at least half the sugar. I would never have known if I hadn't told my mother-in-law I was making a pie and she gave me that suggestion. I'm certain it would have been too sweet otherwise!!

Enjoyable, but when using fresh cherries you may want to try mixing them in a pot over medium heat to get more of the juices and have a more glazier type texture to the filling.

it was a good pie, but the only reason i gave it a 3 was because there was WAY too much sugar in this pie, i would only put in 1/2 a cup that way the taste of the cherries would be stronger instead of so sweet.

I can understand that this recipe would appeal to certain tastes. Unfortunately my family was not keen on the Tapioca. Very solid with a granular texture. 400 for 50 munites was way to hot and too long. Took the pie out at 40 minutes and it was cooked completely.

Yummy! I used 2 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 cup white one. I substitute the  tapioca with corn starch and almond extract with Amaretto Almond Liqueur.  It is delicious! We love it! Thank you so much  for the recipe!

The tapioca I bought must not have been "quick-cooking", because I ended up with hard grains of tapioca on top of the pie and the insides didn't thicken at all.  Perhaps tapioca just wouldn't work with the lattice-crust I made, but it sounds like other folks have had success using tapioca with a lattice-crust.  This recipe should specify that there are different types of tapioca, and list the specific varieties that actually do work.  Apart from that, 4 cups of cherries was not enough to fill the pie, so it was kind of drippy and hollow.  Also, I had sweet cherries, and even 1/2 cup of sugar was overkill.  In the end, my pie was edible, you just had to swallow the tapioca grains and eat it like a cobbler.  I'll give this recipe another shot with some different tapioca and less sugar next time.

This is an awesome recipe.  I made one of these yesterday for a house warming.  It was so yummy, my husband asked me to bake another one for his parents, as well as a third to keep at home!  I did increase the amount of sugar to 1 1/4 cups, as the cherries I used were very tart.  To pit the cherries I used a small, hard plastic child's straw.  It worked amazingly well.  It popped the pits right out in seconds.  Although, I must say, I will definitely be wearing gloves for this process next time!  Great recipe!

Made this today from fresh sour cherries. Pitting them by hand took awhile, but the effort was well worth it. Plan to make another to take for 4th of July picnic. Used Pillsbury prepared pie shells, and used the tip from another chef to make the lattice-work top. Painted the top with egg wash, and the pie is picture-perfect. Very tasty! Thanks/Lesley

This was great! I loved that you didn't have to cook the cherries ahead of time before baking, like with other recipes. The hardest part was just removing the pits. I let the cherries sit in the sugar, etc., while eating supper. Then assembled and popped in oven! I also didn't have enough tapioca, so i mixed in some cornstarch as well, and it turned out great.

very good and simple. I used splenda instead of sugar and excluded the butter for a low calorie version of this recipe. Tapioca was a great idea for a low calorie cherry glaze. The only calories I couldn't avoid was the crust.

I decided to make this pie based on the high rating it received. It turned out good, with a few changes. I only used half the sugar because my cherries were sweet and yummy and I didn't want the pie to be too sugar-y. I also think it could have used a little more "thickness" from either flour or cornstarch (not in the recipe). The tapioca wasn't enough. I can't imagine how runny it would be without it. For those who don't  normally care for tapioca (like me), don't worry-- you can't taste it. Finally, the 4 cups of cherries it called for didn't seem like enough. I used the 4 cups thinking it would expand with the juices and tapioca, but it could have used more. The pie was "shallow" looking and sunken in.

Fabulous and easy.  If I could give it ten stars I would; using the fresh sour cherries gave a tart/sweet taste that was not cloying like some cherry pies can be.  My husband of 25 years said it was the best cherry pie he'd ever had!

Made this for Father's Day. It was the first cherry pie I've made. It was very easy and my dad loved it. I gave it a four because I didn't get to try it; everyone ate it before I could have a piece.

This recipe is fantastic.  I took it to a party for a coworker and got compliments all around.  Even those who swore they hated cherry pie loved this.  Absolutely worth using every cherry season.

I made this with cherries from our local grocery store so I really don't know what kind they are.  I made it per the instructions. My family thought it was fine, not to-die-for.  They suggested I try another recipe.  It was firm, which I loved. So there was no runny filling!  But it just didn't have the ??? taste I was looking for!  I don't think adding the extra sugar, vanilla extract, and almond extract would have made a difference.  It was easy, it tasted OK, it just wasn't there for us.

This was the first cherry pie that I've ever made...and I'll make it again!  I made this pie with fresh Rainier cherries and it was TO DIE FOR!  I actually found it theraputic to pit these lovely orbs of goodness.

With this recipe I turned out the best tasting Cherry Pie ever!  I made it with tart cherries from our neighbors tree and used my tried and true pie pastry recipe that I use for all pies.  it was perfect!  I had a bit too many of the cherries and mixture...so I just poured it on a ham and used it at a glaze...delicious!

Superb!  My first fresh cherry pie experience. I'll never go back to canned cherries again.  I recommend wearing gloves when pitting the cherries.  The juice tends to stain.

Very tasty. I added an extra cup of cherries since I used a deep dish pie plate, it was from Pampered Chef and stoneware. I let the pie set up overnight and it turned out perfectly. When I first removed it from the over it appeared very liquid so I covered it with foil and let it sit. I will be making this again. I bought my cherry pitter from Pampered Chef also and it worked great and made fairly short work of pitting the fresh cherries.
I'm adding to this review as I have made this pie a second time. I used fresh cherries. I had sour cherries and golden so I used both in the pie, with the majority being sour cherries. I find that baking this pie late at night when it is cooler and I don't mind heating up the kitchen works very well as I like to let it set up overnight, this seems to be the key for me and getting this pie to turn out nicely. The only alteration I make to this recipe is to add more cherries to my pie to fill up my deep dish pie plate. For pitting the cherries I use a large bowl and put my hands in the bowl and aim the pitter at the bottom to contain the cherry juice.

the cherry pie recipes I tried before this one drove me nuts because they used canned cherries and I wanted to use fresh so they either came out soupy or super thick. This is perfect for fresh cherries and so far it has come out perfect every time not to runny not to thick. plus it taste wonderful. and is easy to make. I invested in a good cherry pitter (pampered chef) makes pitting the cherries so easy and fast it is no longer the longest part of getting the pie ready. Thank you.

This recipe turned out very well.  I used dark sweet cherries, 1/2 cup of sugar and 
4 T. cornstarch instead of the tapioca.  It was very good.  I will definitely make this one again!

This worked out to be the best cherry pie my husband and I have ever had. Made it with this crust: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/butter-flaky-pie-crust/detail.aspx

We picked the cherries off of our trees right before I started the pie. Seriously, divine, I will never buy a cherry pie ever again.

I absolutely loved this recipe and actually had to cut a piece in advance to save for myself and that ended up being eaten! My family and friends love this recipe and its a family event to put the cherries together(that way I don't have to do all the work)

I used a Tenderflake "Deep Dish" pie shell for this and it still overflowed! Lots of yummy goodness! Also, I didn't quite have enough cherries, so I used 1.5cups diced rhubarb. I served it at a dinner party and everyone raved about it. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This pie was good.  For my father, who likes it tart, he thought it was a little sweeter.  However, he still liked it.  I would make it again, perhaps with a little less sugar and definitely not use the almond extract.  I agree with previous posts in that it creates a sort of fake taste.  Also I worried about pitting the cherries myself but in the end it was easy and still looked nice!

Made it for my husband this week. His favorite pie is cherry pie and fresh cherries were available. I'd never made a cherry pie without the canned stuff but the husband said this filling was wonderful. We're in discussions about the crust. :)  We'll definitely be keeping and using this recipe again. Thanks!

My cherries were sweet so I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. It was still too sweet. I also cut the almond extract to 1/8 tsp. I think next time I would omit the almond extract altogether and adjust the sugar according to how sweet the cherries are. The pie turned out great and I would use this recipe again with a few minor changes! I give it 4 1/2 stars but don't know how to put 1/2 star

This is a FANTASTIC and EASY recipe! I whipped it up in no time.  I used the Publix frozen dark cherries 36 oz total (just over 4 c) and definitely could have used another 24 oz for more cherries.  The flavor is wonderful!  I will probably reduce the sugar to 3/4 c. due to the cherries already being naturally sweet it was slightly overbearing.  I didn't butter the pre-made crust and came out just fine reducing putting added fat into the pie.  The only thing wrong with the pie was it smelt so good that my boyfriend didn't want to wait and give it time to cool and was sort of liquidy - but I would not put that against the pie since the ice cream was melting off the plate the moment it touched the slice of pie. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

The pie was easy to make but tapioca was absolutely unnecessary, it made filling look and taste like cherry jello. Next time I would also add some lemon juice to the filling because it was too sweet for my taste.

I purchased a home last year with a cherry tree and just used this recipe to make a pie for a family gathering.  Everyone raved this was the best cherry pie they ever had.  Thanks!

Amazing. I was skeptical of the tapioca as this was my first time making a fresh fruit pie--I bought Kraft Minute Tapioca, and the pie wasn't soupy at all! With my lattice top--it also didn't bubble over.  The pie tastes great, and I received lots of compliments. I used this with the "Pie Crust IV" recipe. :)

The flavor was good but the texture with all that chunky tapioca was not appealing. Next time I'll try a recipe with cornstarch or flour. Use the recipe "Butter flaky pie crust" its delicious.

Yes, this was a good recipe.  A cherry pitter can be bought at many hardware stores, and MANY places online.  I bought mine for only about $20-$25 at a local hardware store and it makes it VERY easy to pit many cherries.  You have to learn the fastest way with your own pitter, since I am sure different brands are different in the way they operate.  Once I developed a 'touch', which did not take long, I could fly through gallons of cherries.

I exchanged corn starch for tapioca because I didn't have any tapioca.  The pie turned out awesome.  But I cooked it too late at night.  All the neighbors have gone to bed and I don't have anyone to give it to now.  I sure hope I don't eat the whole thing.  I just learned I had a cherry tree outside and my daughter was begging me to fix cherry pie with the cherries.  But now she has fallen asleep and hasn't been able to try any of it.

I used my own pie crust recipe which ended up getting more recognition than the pie itself. The filling was decent but definately not the best. I'm not sure if I should have used half brown sugar and half white sugar like the other  recipes called for but this pie definately didn't have the "kick" in the cherry pie that I was looking for. :( But it was still pretty nice and maybe i used the "wrong" cherries? I will try the other pie recipes before I got back and re-experiment with this one. thanks!

This was my first ever fresh cherry pie. I made it for a gathering at a friend's family get together. I found out once I got there that almost everyone was a gourmet cook...and I am definitely not. I was very nervous but it was a hit! I used the best ever pie crust recipe and followed both as they appear. It came out perfect and looked beautiful! It was much easier than i thought it would be...even pitting the cherries! I highly recommend!

I was really excited to make this for my husbands birthday since he LOVES homemade cherry pie but this is also my first time making homemade cherry pie and both him and I agree the fresh cherrys don't taste the best and they certianly are not worth all the work.  I tired the recipe again with canned cherries and we liked is a lot better.  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe was GREAT!  The tapioca gives it a really nice flavor and texture.  I only used 3/4 cup of sugar and it was perfect.  I also used about 5 cups of cherries.  You may have to vary it depending on the sweetness of your cherries. Thanks for submitting it Cali!

This was first time I made cherry pie. The recipe seemed straightforward and not intimidating, which is why I picked it. I can see why it got high review. The pie came out exactly as described. There is something magical about the combination of cherries and almonds. I also like the fact that it wasn't too sweet.  I'll definitely make this again.

This is a very great Cherry Pie Recipe. I have made this pie for the holidays and everyone enjoys it. I only find one problem with this recipe. It lacks to tell you that you should drain and reserve some of the cherry pie filling. Whether your going to use Canned or homemade you should definitely make sure you drain and reserve the cherry juice. 
My best advice is drain all the juice from your canned or fresh cherrys. place the cherry filling into a bowl then add 1/3 full of cherry juice to it. Just enough so that it almost like you can see the juice raising up.

Yum!  I didn't have almond extract, but I added a little lemon zest and cinnamon to the cherry mixture, and used the topping from http://allrecipes.com/recipe/dutch-apple-berry-pie/detail.aspx .  The Dutch Cherry Pie was delicious.

Maybe our cherries were fresher and jucier than others? It came out of the oven a wet soup, the bottom crust was mush, the cherries were SWIMMING in juice. I added extra tapioca even. I tried cooking cherries first on the stove top and made a yummy cobbler.

Very good! The almond and vanilla extract together gave it a wonderful flavor. I used frozen cherries and it worked well; about five cups. The consistency was perfect as well with the tapioca. Will make again.

I had a lot of fun making this cherry pie, it was my first cherry pie. I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out okay. I think my main problem was the cherries I chose weren't sweet enough or tart enough, they were lacking. The pie itself had a nice consistency, even though there were very little juices due to my crummy cherries. The only thing I don't like about this particular recipe is the Tapioca, which I don't mind using, but the tapioca showed in the pie and looked funny. Also, some were still hard on the top (also probably due to lack of juices). Overall, nice recipe, I may try again with better suited cherries. I wish the recipe had an example of what kind of cherries to get. Oh well! Thanks for sharing.

Yummy pie, except that the almond taste was a little too much for me. I will make this again with no almond extract or just a drop.

Absolutely the best cherry pie you'll ever bake!!!  And so easy, too -- once the cherries are pitted.

Only change I did was to sub in grand marnier for the almond extract, because of a guest's nut allergies. Came together nicely - not too juicy, but enough to know it that these cherries were fresh.

I used 2 tbsps cornstarch, 1/2 cup sugar and cooked the cherries until thickened then added to the pie shell (which was from the frozen section, "tenderflake" yummy). I also threw in some raspberries just on top. Don't be afraid to be creative.

We used fresh bing cherries and followed the recipe exactly.  I put my husband to work on the pitting and he did a great job.  We had so much fun doing it together we have decided to make one every year and to use this recipe.  Painted the top with egg wash and put a star in the middle for the 4th.  Once we arrived at the party, the pie was the main event.  Served with vanilla ice cream and it was gone!

This is the first cherry pie I have ever made and it was delicious!  I took it to a gathering and was repeatedly asked for what the thickener was... everyone loved the consistency of the filling.  I don't have much experience with fruit pies but apparently the tapioca is not all that common and it worked beautifully.  YUMMY!  I will be making this again and throughout cherry season every year.   BTW, it is ridiculous to try to pit cherries without a cherry pitter - if  you are going to do this more than once in your life then just splurge on the ten bucks - its worth it!

This was the best recipe I ever tried for cherry pie.  I had frozen fresh cherries--I rinsed them several times to thaw them but still keep them firm.  I did not have almond extract so used a little extra vanilla extract.  My husband loved the pie and my sister raved that it was the best she ever tasted.  I believe it's a KEEPER!!

The pie was very solid; I wanted to avoid a runny pie, but I would still add less tapioca next time.  I would also cut out the almond extract; as another reviewer stated, it overwhelms the cherries.  It tasted like an almond pie with a fruity texture.

This pie is delicious and easy! I have a cherry tree in my front yard that I harvested for these cherries. I used the pie crust from the "Perfect Cherry Pie" recipe on this site and the filling from this recipe. Next time I'll slightly more filling, but otherwise I think this recipe is perfect!

This was the first fresh cherry pie I have ever made. A friend gave me some cherries from her cherry tree. It was really easy after I figured out how to pit the cherries. (I used the "straw" method as I did not have a cherry pitter.) The pie was fantastic. I added extra sugar as the cherries were very sour. Thanks!

My boys recently brought home some cherries which grow wild at the park near where we live.  They were convinced that I knew exactly how to make a cherry pie with them...yeah, right!  After much painful pitting, i finally got to try this recipe.  So far, so good...We'll see how it works out.  Some of the cherries are still a bit small and tart because the trees are only two years old, but we'll see.

I used this recipe with freshly picked sour cherries from our tree.  I made 3 pies to take to a church picnic.  Everyone was going around the tables asking who made the delicious cherry pies and they were shocked when it was me!  They were the hit of the picnic.

This was excellent. We liked it so well that I also made it with peaches leaving out the almond extract, using 1/2 cup each white and brown sugar and adding 1 tsp of cinnamon. It was also wonderful.

I made this pie for my husband.  It was the first fruit pie I have ever made.  I even did a lattice crust.  It turned out wonderfully.  My husband said it was the best cherry pie he had ever had, even better than his mothers.  You can't beat that!

A PERFECT! Cherry Pie!!! I just got done eating a piece. I picked some fresh cherries from my papas cherry tree. They are very tart and bitter on their own. I love them in this pie. Cherry pie is my favorite pie. This recipe is perfect.

I had bing cherries that were turning and I needed to do something quick.  I never plan to purchase tapioca, but happened to have picked some up the last time I was at the store.  It was great that I had it on hand when I was ready to try and bake a fresh cherry pie.  This recipe made a perfect pie and I will be making more fresh fruit pies from now on.  My family loved it.  PS- I was hesitant about the almond flavoring, but I went ahead and added it and it doesn't ditract from the flavor at all!

This was a super easy pie to make; I had bought a cherry pitter last year at Williams Sonoma and had been anxious to try it.  It made pitting the cherries so easy!  The pie turned out super delicious.  However, I must emphasize be SURE to let the cherries sit for the 15 minutes after adding the tapioca.  I was in a hurry and forgot to do this and the texture was a bit gritty.  I have used tapioca before in making peach pies and always had good luck with it.  But if you leave out the "sitting time" it doesnt give the granules time to soften and is pretty weird.  My family ate the pie, this time, and the FLAVOR was great, we just had to not think about the occasional clump of grainy tapioca.  Next time I will pay more attention!  Thanks for the great recipe Cali.

This was my first fresh cherry pie.  My mom loved it so much she called it the best cherry pie she had ever eaten.  She grew up eating cherry pies made from various family members and this was her favorite.  My dad went that day to get more cherries for another pie!  I added some chopped and toasted nuts.

I searched for a fresh cherry pie and this was IT!! My entire family loved it although they all asked what " those things" were... the tapioca. I will definitely make this pie again and again.

Very easy.  Really takes advantage of fresh cherries.  I used about 1/2 the sugar because my cherry tree produces really sweet cherries.
Thanks to Cali!

I substituted corn starch for the tapioca and used refrigerated pie crusts. The recipe was quick and easy...no pre-cooking the filling.  It's hard to find a recipe for fresh, not canned, cherries.  The kids can easily dump and mix, and it tastes great!

Excellent recipe! First homemade cherry pie I’ve ever had or made.  The texture was perfect like over reviews stated, and sliced wonderful.  Nothing was said about the size of the cherries so I left mine almost whole minus the pit and i could have cut them in quarters and liked it a bit more (personal preference). I also doubled the extracts.  Will definitely make again for family.

I used a ready-made crust for this and it was great.  I altered the recipe slightly and used a tsp of vanilla extract and a tsp of chocolate bitters.  It turned out great.  Cherry with a chocolate undertone!

I used Splenda Pour instead of sugar as my husband is diabetic.  The tapioca and sweetener crusted the cherries and didn’t dissolve once baked.

I made it exact as the recipe called for and it was not as sweet as I would have liked but I used Rainer cherries (local Washington state cherry) and they aren’t as sweet. I also wished I had brushed the crust with egg white and sprinkled with granulated sugar.

Delicious Cherry Pie! The most time consuming part is pitting the cherries. I did omit the almond extract because I didn't realize I was out and eyeballed the vanilla.

I made this for our Woman's Club charity dinner.  I used 3 cups of cherries and 1 cup of blueberries because I had my cherries frozen in 3 cup packages.  I forgot to use the butter, but it came out delicious.  It was given rave reviews at the dinner.  It was so easy, I'll definitely make it again and again.

I made two changes. I did not add any vanilla, based on a previous comment, and I used 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup. I do that with many pie recipes - cut back a little on the sugar. The cherries were already sweet. (I bought them at Sprouts.) The pie was absolutely delicious. Oh, and I used the "poke" method with the square end of a cheap wooden chopstick to pit the cherries.

Awesome!!  I added some blueberries and a teaspoon of lemon juice on top of the cherries.  Make sure you put a cookie sheet under it because it really does bubble over!

Very simple and tasty.  Fresh cherries were on sale and this made a great desert.  I did cut back the sugar a little just because we are cutting back on sugar.  Still great taste.  I wished I had put aluminum foil on the crust because it browned before I wanted to remove the pie from the oven.  This is a keeper.  Hardest part was removing the pits.  Best pat was eating the pie, well worth the hardest part.

Was delicious. Never enjoyed tapioca pies, so substituted an equal amount of corn starch for the tapioca.

The best ever! Husband, kids, and I all agree. We live overseas and could not find sour cherries so we used frozen sweet cherries, added a teaspoon of fresh squeezed lemon juice. I added almost double the almond extract knowing we like the cherry-almond flavor. Simply scrumptious.

I made my pies the same as the recipe.I thought the extract amounts were perfect. I refrigerated the crust in the pie pan while I put together the fillings It was not at all soggy. The only thing I did different was going with a crumb topping instead of the double crust.....just a matter of preference. The pie was absolutely delicious. I will use it as my go to recipe for cherry pie.

This was, hands down, The. Best. Cherry Pie. Ever!  I followed the recipes exactly except for using 4T of Wondra flour instead of tapioca since I didn't have tapioca on hand.  I had told my husband that I wasn't a big fan of cherry pie but, boy!, have I changed my tune after having a piece of this pie.  I never realized just how awful canned cherry pie filling was until I made this.  Thank you for this recipe.  It's a keeper.

Very good pie!  Used my own recipe for the crust and used 2 12 oz bags of frozen sweet cherries.  Substituted tapioca for potato starch since that's all  I had.  Wish the filling was more on a juicier side and gooey...

So I used 6 cups of pitted cherries but did not increase the other ingredients.. I feel I would have added a bit more sugar had the cherries not been sweet enough. Did not have tapioca starch. So I used 2 tsp gf flour and 2 tsp cornstarch. Gave it a very good mixing and left it to sit for about 1/2 hour be fore I filled the crust. I wanted to see how much liquid may extract but none did. My crust was a gf crust recipe from King Arthur Flours.
When I cut into it after it cooled, the pie maintained its shape without liquid oozing out. 
Terrific! I would make this pie again!

This was my first attempt at making a cherry pie. I used fresh cherries and had to manually take the pits out. I read all of the ways to do this, but I just used my thumbs to remove it. It was easy. Everyone raved about the pie, and there were no leftovers! The only thing that I was not expecting was how runny it was, but it did not matter. It was delicious. Next time, I will make the tapioca ahead of time that will give it time to thicken. Maybe, that was my mistake and the reason that it was runny. Nonetheless, it was great. I used the Butter Flaky Crust pie crust recipe, which is always great.

This is the only cherry pie I make.  No additions I just go a little
Heavy on the vanilla and almond and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup.  We have a cherry cannery here so when in season I buy twenty five pounds of fresh cherries, put them in  one quart zip lock bags and freeze them. I'm good for another year. Very good pie.

This was the best cherry pie I've ever had. Its usually not my favorite but this is a keeper. Not too sweet and the cherries stayed a little firm. I used about 6 cups of cherries and added a touch of cinnamon the did an egg wash on the top crust and sprinkled it with a little sugar. Yum yum!!!!!

My family thought this was awesome! I made it exactly as the recipe stated this first time with cherries from our own tree (first ever picking!) & my own tried & true crust recipe. Will definitely make again, maybe varying some ingredients, as others have tried.

Have cherry trees so used fresh cherries and increased cherries to 4 cups.  Had a large pie pan so would increase to 5-6 cups cherries and increase other ingredients accordingly.  Got rave responses on pie.

Wow was I impressed! I made this exactly as the recipe states and it came out perfect. Wasn't sure about the almond extract but it really makes the flavor pop. The tapioca measurement is spot on; didn't have a soupy filling or a gluey mess. Making my second pie this evening.

Very good!   I used fresh tart cherries so I had to double the sugar.    The tapioca bits were a little strange.   May need to figure out a different ingredient to help it stick together.

My husband waxed poetic about this recipe! I had taken our first cherry harvest and turned it into something magical, thanks to this recipe!

I used the French pastry pie crust from AR and used an egg white wash on the bottom of the crust before filling. Our cherries were in the freezer, so the night before using them, I used another person's idea to let them sit in sugar overnight. Ours are tart pie cherries so I used 2 cups sugar and 5 cups cherries. I had a 10" foil pie pan. I doubled the extract and grated a bit of nutmeg for brightness. My husband is threatening to devour the whole thing. Love love love this recipe.

I have made this pie several times and each time, I receive rave reviews!!  I too, used fresh sour cherries, but due to their short growing season, I have recently switched to King Orchards Montmorency canned tart cherries.  There are packed in water so there is nothing else added. Like a previous reviewer mentioned, I do soak the cherries in the sugar overnight in a ziplock...delicious!

I have always liked cherry pie ... the bright red tinned filling even!  This pie made from hand-pitted fresh cherries made a cherry pie convert out of my pie snob husband.  The almond extract takes it to the next level.  I washed a about a tablespoon of milk on the crust before baking.  Also I baked it for 15 minutes, then took it out of the oven momentarily to cover the edges in foil so they wouldn't go too dark too quickly.  Back in the oven, taking the foil off for the final 10 minutes.  Served it a la mode, of course!

Cherry pie is really the best with sour (re: early) cherries.  These are so hard to find except frozen.  I tried fresh sweet cherries and just not great.  I would suggest half the tapioca to get a little more juice - but that's a personal preference.

It was different for me to do this recipe since I'm not american and we do not have the pastry here. But it was as yummy as it looked and I'm now a hero in my family. Thank you sooo much!

I have used this recipe for the last two years.  I have cherry trees in my garden and nothing beats a fresh cherry pie.  Especially when you grow the fruit yorself.

This cherry pie is excellent.  I used fresh bing cherries and Oregon pie cherries mixed.  It is absolutely awesome. Even those who claimed they did not cherry pie, raved about this one.  I have made 3 cherry pies now and each time the pie gets better. Now I have other people requesting it.

I don't like cherry pie and I thought it was good, not great but good. My husband won't eat any pie except cherry and he did not like this at all. It was too thick for his tastes and not quite sweet enough. Yet the kids both said it was too sweet for them. I won't make it again.

This pie was a big disappointment. I spent a long time making this pie (pitted the cherries with a knife) and then when I cut into it, it was so runny. I used cornstarch instead of the tapioca like other reviewers but it definitely was not enough to thicken all the cherry juice. I also found it to be a little too sweet.

My husband is a huge cherry pie fan so we made this together one night.  I like pies, but they aren't my favorite dessert by any stretch.  But this now tops my favorite desserts.  It was the best pie I've ever tasted.  Hands down.  We didn't have tapioca on hand so I followed the suggestion by one of the reviewers to cook the juice from the cherries with cornstarch.  So yummy!  Will make again in a heartbeat.

I have made a lot of pies, but never a cherry pie, and I love almond flavor, so I tried this one. It was easy, especially because I use the Pillsbury ready crusts (no need, in my mind, to fuss and fume because it tastes so good). I think my husband let all the juice out when he pitted the cherries, though, because the pie was really gloppy. It was still yummy, though. I would probably increase the almond next time and maybe throw in more cherries for good measure. Hopefully my next try will be more juicy!

I tried this recipe and it was ok. Perhaps if I made the crust from scratch and not used a store bought one, it may have tasted differently. It was still good, tho. I used a paper clip to pit the cherries and it worked great. Cheaper than a pitter, too.  Forgot to add that I agree with a previous reviewer about using the tapioca. It didn't disappear as the pie cooked so, you still saw these white lumpy things afterwards. In actuality, I'd give this recipe 3.5 stars.

Absolutely loved this recipe and would recommend it to any baker- new or experienced.  Made it for a neighbor and was so happy he invited me in for a slice... it was perfect!  I glazed melted butter on the crust before baking it, and it made a nice shiny appearance at the end.  Thank you!

Excellent. Due to allergies, changed almond extract to vanilla, and added 1 tsp. brandy. Used 3/4 c. brown sugar; 1/2 c. white.  Not too sweet.  Get a cherry pitter!

Ahh, so good!  I actually had about 1.5 cups of black raspberries from my yard, so I combined those with 2.5 cups of cherries and it was WONDERFUL!  I used the "Butter Flaky Pie Crust" from this site, and ahh... so yummy!

First time ever making a pie and this recipe turned out wonderful.  The thickness was perfect and the taste of the fresh cherries were great!  My next pie will be the fresh blueberry....thanks for the great recipes!

What a delicious recipe! I only had 3 cups of sweet cherries, so I added 1 cup of blueberries. My family hates almond anything, so I added just the vanilla. I also put a crumb topping on it for something different. It sure was a BIG hit in our house. No one could really pinpoint the fruit. Was it a blueberry pie, or was it cherry? It kept them going for awhile. The taste was great and I like a solid, not runny pie and the tapioca took good care of that. I will definately make it again and again.

This was a lovely pie.  i had doubts about the tapioca setting long enough, so i let it rest in the fridge for a further 10 minutes after it was assembled. it came out beautiful.  thank you for posting it.

I made this for Father's Day, and it was a big hit with all the men: Dad, Husband, and Brother-in-law. I used a combo of 4/5 sour cherries and 1/5 bing cherries. Really good.
