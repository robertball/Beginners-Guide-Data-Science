This is no exciting gourmet recipe, but that's okay because it doesn't claim to be. Pretty much any spices or different vegetables could be added to liven it up, but then if that's what you're after, find a different recipe. If you want simple, hearty, easy, and cheap, try this one. The beauty of this recipe is its simplicity.

I love the name of this dish....as I read the recipe I realized that this was what my mother served to her 11 kids! Only she called it "Shipwreck" and would throw in any leftover vegetables in the fridge....none of us liked it!! But when you cook for that many kids it pretty much has to be bland!!!

I found this to be rather bland.  I kept trying to add salt and pepper to make it taste better, but to no avail.  My five-year-old wouldn't eat it, even after I put cheese on top of it.

Nothing special but everyone in my family will eat it.  I added onions and seasoned with a little garlic salt and some pepper.  Also, I didn't have tomato soup so I just poured some tomato sauce on top.  I told my 5 year old that this is just like the tin foil dinners we eat when we are camping.  She gobbled it up!

A pretty basic casserole.  I can see why it's called what it is called, because it's a tad too basic . . .there is absolutely no seasonings or spices in this thing to jazz it up.  I knew just by looking at the recipe that I'd have to put more in it for it to work for us.  It looked promising, though, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  Recipe doesn't say, but I have to assume it wants you to cook up the meat and veggies first, then put it in the casserole, so that's what I did.  I misread it though, and thought the potatoes were to go on top.  About halfway through cooking the veggies on the stovetop, I realized my mistake and added half the potatoes.  I decided to keep the rest for a topping. So after mixing up the meat and veggies, I put them in the casserole, topped with spaghetti sauce (what I had), topped with potatoes, then topped with garlic sea salt, paper, and more sauce.  Then I baked for 75 minutes total, then turned off the oven and took off the cover to brown the potatoes. My other changes:  added Italian seasoning, carmelized onions and garlic with the veggies and meat.  It turned out pretty basic still, but made for a warm, hearty lunch on a cold winter day.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is sooooo good! I used to request this hotdish for my birthday dinner when I was a kid. Serve with buttered bread.  Pure joy.

Mom makes this all the time for potlucks at the first of every month. DAYUM, with cheese shredded on top, it is GOOD. No one likes it so far? PLEASE try with cheese shredded on top.
