This is the best pumpkin bread that I ever had made. It was so moist. I did use vanila pudding instead of the coconut creme on the last 3 batches of the pumpkin bread.

This recipe makes two nice large loaves that are not too spicy, laced with the exotic flavor of cocoanut and very moist.  Our family all liked it. It has a milder pumpkin taste than regular pumpkin bread.  Try it, you'll like it!

I loved the special taste of this bread, I just added more spice because I prefer mine pumpkin bread to have a strong flavor.

This bread is so good!  Really good flavor, the coconut gives it an extra special taste.  And it is so incredibly moist.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

I shared this recipe with a friend.  She made it and took it to her office. She told me she was getting marriage proposals.  I really like this recipe.  My mother makes a pumpkin custard pie that tastes just like this bread.  The bread is faster to make.

This bread has become a family favorite year round.  I cut back a little on the oil but otherwise it's fantastic.

This was just okay to me - not enough spice maybe? I tasted the flour in this bread. I did like the addition of the coconut pudding, I think I will try to adapt another recipe using the pudding. Also, this took 1 hour and 15 minutes for me, maybe that my oven is off.

I had to change the kind of pudding (husband is allergic to coconut), and changed/added some spices/extracts, as my family likes highly flavored food.  Overall, excellent recipe and has been added to the "Must make again" list by my family.

The flavor was excellent, but the texture was a bit too moist and soft for me. I should have taken a clue from the photo, as there was no crown on the bread. I did have to bake it about 15 minutes longer than specified. I know it's not my oven, as my oven is new and has been calibrated.  I will make this bread again, but I will make some adjustments to the oil and flour for personal preference. I liked the addition of coconut pudding mix---something I would not have thought of, but it really added a great flavor.

loved it, but left the coconut creme pie filling out and put the mix in 2 bundt pans for a prettier cake.
