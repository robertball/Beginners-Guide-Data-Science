I needed to make a stock in order to get gravy for my deep-fried turkey.  This was so easy to make - made the whole house smell wonderful - and also made a tasty gravy.

I made this as directed to go with the "Awesome Sausage, Apple and Dried Cranberry Stuffing" as called for. It was not as much fuss as I thought it would be and the results were fantastic.

It smells like Thanksgiving in here!  This stock was so good and easy, a great way to use those giblets!  I used this recipe to make the "Savory Turkey Gravy" recipe from this site, so I did eliminate the tangerine zest because I wasn't sure I wanted citrusy gravy.

This turned out wonderfully!  I have never tried to make my own turkey stock and this made for an amazing gravy!  It made my gravy really flavorful and much less SALTY.  I will be doing this every year, although I have to admit I didn't add the liver... just couldn't do it.

I have made this stock and the accompanied stuffing for the last several years. I was freaking out because I misplaced my recipe folder. Thank goodness I was able to remember where this was on the Internet because this stock is amazing and wonderful for a beginner. And the apple/sausage stuffing it goes with is perfection as well!

I've been a vegetarian for 21 years!!! Faced with a neck and bag of giblets I was mortified! If I can do this anyone can. Gonna attempt a turkey stew now...wish me luck carnivores! P.S. No I won't be eating it.

Great stock recipe!  I made it for use with the Awesome Sausage, Apple and Cranberry Stuffing.  Very easy to make and everyone loved the way it smelled while it was simmering.

I wanted to make the Awesome Sausage, Apple & Dried Cranberry Stuffing on this site, so looked for a turkey stock recipe.  Luckily, Stacy provided this recipe as well.  This was easy to make and was delicious.  I didn't have tangerines, so I used orange peel instead.  I made the recipe and, as directed, added water to get it to 3 cups.  I used 3/4c for the stuffing recipe and most of the rest for my gravy.

A great & tasty way to use up all the turkey!  Did NOT add the liver and threw in a fresh sage leaf since I did not have any bay leaves.  Turned out a very good!

It came out good w/changes.  Gave liver to cats, used one tangerine zest and used 4-color peppercorns.  I also used my Quick Roux recipe to thicken.

I wasn't going to make turkey stock, but this morning I decided at the last minute that I would like to give it a shot. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it turned out great! It is very easy to whip up while the turkey is in the oven.

Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

Bland. No flavor at all. My turkey didn't come with a liver so all I had was the neck and giblets, so maybe that had something to do with it, but I had to ad 3 1/2 tsp chicken bouillon just to get it to taste like something.

This was first time making giblet stock. I followed the recipe exactly and used this stock for my gravy, which turned out wonderful! Will keep this basic recipe as a keeper for future use. **I just made this again this year. The stock was awesome for the Awesome Cranberry Sausage Stuffing recipe, but was too sweet for gravy. Will make again for stuffing though!

I had to make before I could get the giblets out of my turkey, so I used a pound of turkey gizzards and doubled the recipe.  Made a rich, delicious stock.

I could not believe how easy and tasty this was. I did not reduce the broth but instead used it for turkey noodles. This broth is out of this world! Just as the author states, the entire house smelled fabulous. I have always thrown away the giblets because it looked gross as a kid. So, I gave it a chance and I am so glad I did. As  a kid, I would never eat the dressing because I knew it was made with the giblet broth and giblets...I just might try it now at 52 yrs of age. That's how good this broth is!!!!

This was a great, easy recipe. I used it for Awesome Sausage, Apple, and Cranberry Stuffing, and then added the turkey drippings and some corn starch to the rest for gravy. My first time cooking with giblets and I felt confident with this recipe,and it turned out great! I didn't have any bay leaves, so that was left out and it still turned out fine.

Super easy and super delicious. I used the whole turkey carcass though to get more broth than this recipes creates. Same spices and ingredients though. Using the stock for a turkey tex mex stew (also a recipe on this site).

This recipe was very easy to follow. It made the house smell so good. My bf said it smelled like Thanksgiving. :) I used it to make the Awesome Sausage, Apple and Cranberry Stuffing which, came out SO good! Although, since it does take quite some time to make, I don't know if I would do this again. I already have a lot to cook/bake for Thanksgiving, I think the stock is one thing I could take a short cut on. I'm pretty sure I could use store bought turkey or chicken stock that'll give me just as delicious results.

A nice base turkey stock, that we always keep in our freezer for making dressing and as a base for 100 other things in the kitchen.
