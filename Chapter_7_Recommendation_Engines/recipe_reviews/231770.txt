This is a very solid recipe. I made the cake in the spirit of the recipe, but did not follow exactly as written.  Cake batter was done per the recipe - I did line my cake pans with parchment to keep them from browning too much and affecting the lovely red hue. As for the frosting, I did whipped cream by hand vs. using something from a tub. I mixed a 1/4c. of frozen raspberries (thawed) into 1 1/2 c. of whipped cream for the filling between the two layers then did the rest of the cake in plain whipped cream.  I think the effect was lovely and it frosted much easier without the berries to mar the smooth exterior of the cake. As it is not berry season, I left off the fresh berries from the top.  

This was for a friend's birthday, and the response was overwhelmingly positive! I will keep this in my files for future cake making - thank you so much for this.

My first cake baking experience was excellent with this recipe. I focused on the batter portion and made the Easy Cream Cheese frosting that I found in Allrecipes. I added fresh raspberries at every serving, served on top of a dollop of the frosting. A fresh, fruit-filled treat.

Yummy! And yes, I made a couple changes. Before I put the unbaked cake in the oven, I evenly spooned a whole can of raspberry pie filling over the batter and baked about 10 minutes longer. I also added two teaspoons of confectioners sugar to the whipped topping.
