Yum yum yum. Served over Farfalle pasta. Didn’t have the green pepper. Still very good. Didn’t soak beans overnight just boiled them for 1/2 hour first. Used approximately 2 cups pumpkin purée from the garden harvest this fall. Made my own roux and Chili seasoning using all recipes recipes. Great veggie meal. Love the spices!

It was delicious! Perfect recipe for fall.
I did leave out the cloves, as others had suggested
