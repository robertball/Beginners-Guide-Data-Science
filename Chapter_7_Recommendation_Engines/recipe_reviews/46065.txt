Wow!  This was spicy!  4 Tbsp red pepper flakes was WAY too much.  I used only 2 Tbsp and we were sweating and our lips were burning.  Despite the bite, it had a great flavor!  We'll cook this one again, but probably only with 3-4 teaspoons of the red pepper flakes.

This makes an outstanding sauce and the flavor is outrageous.  This is defiantly a new favorite.
