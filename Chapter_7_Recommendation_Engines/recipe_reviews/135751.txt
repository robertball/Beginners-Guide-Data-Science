This is a very good recipe.  To keep dip from turning brown, place plastic wrap directly on top of dip and press down to seal to edges.  This keeps air out of contact with the avacado and thus no browning.

When I saw one cup of diced onion to just three avocados, that immediately told me I'd be winging the amount of the ingredients scaled down to suit my taste, similarly with 3/4 cup of fresh cilantro - not even CLOSE to what I used. I also substituted a small, finely minced jalapeno pepper for the Anaheim chile.   The Hidden Valley Ranch, of course, was the unusual ingredient that would make the cut or not.  My mom liked it, calling it refreshing. Hubs, not so much and I have to say I agree with him. It was ok, but some things, like guacamole, are classics you shouldn't mess with. In my view, this may be an avocado dip, but it wasn't guacamole.

I wanted to give this 10 stars.  It is the best Guacamole I have ever had. I will make this from now on.

I loved this recipe. I'm a huge fan of guacamole. I never thought to add ranch dressing mix to my ingredients before, however it really makes a nice different. It proceeds a fresh, tangy flavor.

Great recipe but I cut back on the onions. Also, to prevent the guacamole from turning brown, leave the avacado pits in until serving.
