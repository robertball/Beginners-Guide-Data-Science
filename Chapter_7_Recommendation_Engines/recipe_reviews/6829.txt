I've been making tortillas since I had to stand on a chair to reach the counter.  
I just want to give some pointers to make this easier for those who want to try it. 

1)First you don't need boiling water just as hot at you can stand out of the tap without burning yourself.

2)Let the dough sit covered for about 15 minutes before you divide them up & roll them out. 

3) If you happen to have bacon grease that adds a wonderful flavor, that you don't get from plain old lard. (Just a once in a while treat I'll give myself)

4) The rolling pin you use makes all the difference in the world. If you are using one of those big fat ones with handles on the side you are never going to get anywhere.  A regular wooden pin with no handles & about an 1 1/2inch diameter is what you need. 

5) If you over roll them they will get hard & tough. Once up from the center & once down from the center flip over & rotate 90degrees.

6)Practice practice a couple of wasted batches don't worry its only flour & water no big loss & you can always make chilaqueles from hard tortillas!

I usually use my grandmother's recipe but was unable to get a hold of her.  This recipe was just about the same and they came out just like Grandma's.  If you're not used to making tortillas or grew up around them daily the rolling out of the tortillas can be tricky.  Just a couple of hints:  Sprinkle a little flour on your surface and your rolling pin to keep the dough from sticking. Start in the center and roll up once and back to the center to roll down and then you need to keep turning the tortilla a couple of inches after you roll it out.  It's so much easier once you get the hang of it.  Store bought tortillas just don't taste like the real thing.

Excellent recipe! Those of you who don't like to roll your out or are finding too much work for you, buy a tortilla press. They cost about $20 and are worth every penny!! I couldn't live without mine and this recipe is perfect with it! It makes it worth making them!!!

This is a great recipe.  taste just like tortillas, but better!  I omitted the baking powder and i used margerine instead of shortening.  i rolled out the dough paper thin... then i placed a bowl on the dough and cut around the edge of the bowl.. so all of my tortillas were the same perfect circles.  they looked exactly like store-bought tortillas, but tasted much better!

This is the first tortilla recipe I've found that makes tasty, pliable tortillas.  They keep well for several days when sealed in a ziplock bag.  Delicious and fast to make!

This recipe is wonderful!  As tortilla recipes go they are very tempermental.  This one is easy to follow and quite basic.  I have tried many tortilla recipes and they usually turn out crispy like crackers.  Cooking for 1-2 mins may be too much, I only cooked them for about 30-45 secs (or about 20 secs each side).  They are a bit plain, but I am more concerned with consistancy and these are pliable and easy to cook with.

These were very easy to make and so delicious, but soooooo very difficult to roll out. At first it was easy when the dough was still warm... but it got tougher and tougher. I halved the recipe and got more than enough and had a good workout in the kitchen with the roller. *lol*

I found that it takes more time than it is worth to make tortillas.They come out dry and stiffer than the bought ones . Unless your having a lot of help, it isn't worth it.

I have tried making tortillas in the past without much success.  This was the easiest dough to roll out!  It was like playdough.  I will be making these again.

This was a great recipe.  I never knew how easy it was to make tortillas.  The only problem is, the rolling part is sooooooo tedious and long.  You just can't get them thin enough, and after I make half the batch, I end up throwing hte rest of the dough away.  I think next time, I'll try using a pasta maker to roll the dough really thin.  hope it works!

I lost my original recipe so I made these as listed knowing that the fat was the only difference. These came out bland, but it didn't matter so much since I made tacos with them and the filling was flavorful. I have a few tips for those who are less adept at making tortillas. First, ask if you can watch and help someone experienced. Just about everyone who makes awesome tortillas will tell you that they learned from someone else. Next, if you want a tortilla that you can nibble on I recommend using bacon grease or butter for flavor. Also, IMO, the only two things that contribute to tough, crunchy tortillas are not enough water in the dough and overcooking them. Both come with practice and patience, and keep in mind that you want to use the highest heat possible to just barely brown the outside while just barely cooking the inside. Multitasking is key, as well, to making this short and quick. Roll out tortilla A, place it on the skillet, start rolling out tortilla B, flip A finish rolling out B, put A on a plate between a towel and put B on the skillet, and so on.

Made these and they were as simple as could be.  I rolled them between parchment paper, and had no problem w/ needing extra flour.  The tortillas were soft, and wonderful.  I used the tortillas w/ the slow cooked steak fajitas...yummy!

I tried another tortilla recipe and it turned out a disaster. these actually looked, tasted, acted, and felt like real tortillas. I did use butter instead of shortening (about 40 grams) since i live in Europe and I have no idea what shortening is called here (and if they even have it).

make sure you do roll them out REALLY thin though. my first few tortillas turned out really thick...although still good! :)

I am really excited to find this recipe. I followed a few suggestions and they came out perfectly. I am from south Texas so I know good tortilllas!
*Tips:
Double the salt.
Blend in Food Processor as to not overmix.
Add 3 extra Tbls. of Water
Coat pan with bacon grease before cooking each tortilla.
Store cooked tortillas on a plate between a kitchen towel.
As you are cooking one, be rolling the next one out.

Maybe I did this wrong, but I didn't like these at all.  I didn't like the texture of the dough - it was really difficult to work with.  The finished product was okay, but I'm still looking for the perfect tortilla recipe.

Coming from a fam that makes tortillas for  evey meal of the day. I noticed 2 things wrong, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and did the recipe.   The tortillas tasted good and fluffed but, they became hard quickly not to mention texture was more like a pita bread then a tortilla.  Suggest: La Pina brand flour not all purpose, only use lard or butter and warm water needs to be poured in a bit at a time, kneeding it first throughly before adding a bit more.  After I followed the exact directions then they came out GREAT and lasted 4 days! with a quick reheat in the microwave

***The first few tortillas came out looking like The Grinch so to help shape them, I rolled the dough in a ball and pressed with a plate to give a good start to a circle.***  I put an extra dollop of shortening because mama likes shortening.  My family would not keep their hands off of them as they came off the pan.

These came out perfect and delicious!!!
Some things I did to modify recipe:
-added more shortening (1tbsp)
-used water according to how the texture should be, not by the recipe. If the dough is looking dry and non-elasticy, add more water (little at a time)
-had my pan getting hot on med for a while, then before i put them in the pan, I lightly brushed the pan with vegetable oil.
-cooked for only abt 15-20 seconds per side

This one is a total keeper! If you decide to use all 5 c. of flour, I suggest you split the dough in half, leaving some oil on top, and covering with a warm/hot towel. That way it will be easier to roll once you get to it.

This was so fun! I've always wanted to make homemade tortillas and had no idea it was this easy. I made 2 batches and this is what I learned in the process; I increased the salt to 1 tsp., used slightly more water than the recipe calls for (just a tbls or so), and I neglected to knead the dough both times and it didn't seem to effect the outcome at all. Also, the tortillas only need to sit on medium heat for about a minute each side, too long and they start to get crisp. Dividing the dough into equal parts I ended up with 16 8-10" tortillas.  A tip to get a nice round tortilla; Before you start to roll out the dough flatten it into a thick disk shape, once you have rolled it out a few times flip the tortilla and roll it out some more. I found that this helped me increase it's size and create a more uniform shape.

The recipe is easy and quick and very good. I used an ordinary uncoated frying pan and added some veg. oil. to the preheated pan. Every time I make any type of pancake, I add some veg. oil to a saucer and cut a potato in half. I then use the cut potato to wipe out the pan with the oil. That way you have enough oil in the pan so the tortilla would not stick to it and wouldn't be soaked in grease (also possible with paper towel but more eco-friendly). I rolled out the dough paper thin with a rolling  pin and baked it for only 1-2 min on each side. The tortilla came out soft and fluffy, just great!

Ugh this was awful.  The prep was simple but the results were dreadful!  I followed directions exactly but the tortillas turned out very bland and very lifeless.  Luckily I had store bought tortillas on hand.  DON"T WASTE YOUR TIME!

These tortillas are wonderful!  I'd recommend that people use good quality flour.  I also used unbleached flour, and I can't tell you how good they turn out.  I'd recommend to people to make sure they're measuring the flour properly- these are easy to make if you do it right. LOVED them!

Rating as WIP (grin).  Am still experimenting - so far, a) I really think it needs more salt and b) 40 grams of dough *should* give you about a 5 1/2" to 6" sized tortilla (taco sized).  I cut recipe down to a fifth (should be 12 tortillas) and I came out with about half that.  I used tortilla press - they came out wafer thin, had a devil of a time trying to peel them off (ended up using parchment paper on top/bottom) and after cooking they still ended up being slightly thicker than what I was hoping for - - - but I guess that's to be expected with homemade tortillas (ya learn something new everyday).  So far, I'm totally digging this :)  Thanks so much for recipe!

This is a great recipe! The tortillas are very easy to make, they stayed soft, and tasted good! To ensure that they stayed moist, I put them in a plastic bag while still warm. This did the trick, and my family really enjoyed the tortillas. I did find that this recipe made less than half of the amount it was supposed to make! I might have made them too thick, however. Thanks for a easy and tasty recipe!

These turned out really nice. I cut this in half and got 12 tortillas out of it. These were like the ones I get at the store in taste and texture, only better because I made them myself. DH thought they could use a little more salt though. My son, the critic, says, "mom you know those aren't round", okay, lol so they weren't picture perfect, but they did look like the ones in the picture. These were a sturdy pliable durable tortilla. These seemed a bit stiff when I first cooked them, but after I placed them in my tortilla keeper and they were perfectly soft and flexible when it was time to eat. Beware working with the boiling water though, even though I added slowly as directed, it was still too hot to work with  with my hands, so I had to use a wooden spoon for a minute or two til it cooled enough to be safe. Trust me I have a small burn on the side of my palm, as there were "pockets" of hot water in the flour, so just be forewarned. I'm still new at tortilla making so maybe it's my inexperience...? (UPDATE: So I asked around and everyone tells me the water should be as hot as your hands can possibly stand, not boiling hot! Hope this helps others :) This was a great flat bread, thanks Esther!

WOW!! I finally found the perfect flour tortilla.  I love these.  They are tender and chewy-just right for fajitas or gorditas or gyros just about any filling.  THanks for a fab recipe!!

I make these at least every other weekend.  My husband and the neighbors love when I make fajitas!!  I add twice as much butter flavored shortning.  I have also made them so much that I know what texture I am looking for easy rolling.  I usually add about Tbs more water. Love em!!

Fabulous recipe!  I'll never buy them from the store again!  I used bread flour, and found that they stayed nice and soft for days afterwards.  And my beau just loves them!

This recipe is just fine, as a matter a fact I bet you could use oil, butter or shortening and it would turn out just fine. I have been trying in vain for 2years to make Tortillas to no avail. I finally tried watching a Youtube video to see what I was doing wrong. The only thing I was doing wrong; cooking them too long! They only need a very sm. amount of time like 15 sec. on each side. Love that we can make them ourselves now. Also if you roll them out on a wax paper with a little flour sprinkled on it and only one layer (the bottom)then lift the wax paper with the tortilla on it and carefully seperate it from the paper to put on the griddle, it works awesome! Thanks for all the reviews and recipe!

These were delicious! Made the tacos for sure. I made a much smaller batch, turned out great. Used my griddle on my range and it worked nicely. I read some reviews and was hesitant but I used a towel (as with any warm tortilla and as served in restaurants) and they were very soft and easy to use, none cracked. 
These were also fun to make, I'll be making them again and again!

Nice!  My first try at making tortillas and true to form allrecipes has offered up another winner.  I did pretty well for not having ever made these before.  I didn't have shortning/lard so I used the canola oil I had and it went very well.  I need to practice rolling them out so they are not so thick but I am very pleased and even just making this first batch I can see improvement from the first ones to the last.  I will definitely keep making these.  Sweet !

These were wonderful! I cut the recipe to 24 and got half that (which is what I was expecting) so golf balls and tortillas must be smaller elsewhere.  Here is how I rolled them out. I made the balls, and then flattened them a bit between two cutting boards. They were about 2 inches across. Then I rolled them out, stacking them up as I went. At the end, I inverted the stack so the oldest one was one top. Then I rolled one out again - by allowing the dough to relax, I got it thinner. As each one cooked, I rolled out the next one.  I am going to get a tortilla press to make it a little easier, but it really was pretty easy.

This recipe is great!  Growing up my mom always made homemade tortillas and they taste so much better than the ones from the store.  For ones who have trouble rolling it out, made sure not to over knead the dough, this will made it more difficult to roll out.

these were good, i used lard instead of shortening because it has more flavor i also added more lard and a little less water. A helpfull hint if you dont have a rolling pin a empty wine bottle can sometimes be just as usefull

I'm so impressed with this recipe! I always thought it would be really hard to learn to make tortillas and wasn't counting on these turning out well, but they were great. I doubled the salt and the whole recipe made 20 good sized tortillas. The dough was very easy to work with and best of all, they turned out great, nice and pliable and MUCH better tasting than store bought tortillas, which I've never liked much. Thanks!

I've made several tortilla recipes and this one is by far the best one. The dough is easy to manipulate and the tortillas come out nice and soft.  I do think this recipe could use a tad more salt, but that could just be my personal preference. All in all, I'd recommend this recipe to anyone who desires a good tortilla.

I grew up eating store brought tortillas and this was the first time I made them at home so I'm not really the most knowledgable on authentic tortillas, but these came out really good. I found that I needed more water than called for- over a half of a cup more! The only substitution I made was to use bacon fat instead of the shortening. My tortillas came out soft, pliable, and chewy (in a good way). I put the leftover tortillas and a damp paper towel in a ziploc bag in the fridge in the hopes that they'll stay soft and chewy when we finish the batch off this weekend. Good recipe that I'll definitely use again!

Ok, I made these this morning. I preheated the oven to 200 then turned it off when i started putting finished wraps in to keep warm and used a 9in glass covered casserole dish instead of a towel and served right from that. 
This is a good, simple recipe. Easy to follow. I made my dough, then just sprinkled flour over it right in bowl to knead till elastic and smooth, then just poured about 3t olive oil over it ,turned it a couple times to coat then covered and let rest as directed. Didnt need so much time in skillet, maybe about a min the first side and 30 sec or so on other.
Here's my trick though, instead of risking even more flour to roll out, which i thought maybe would make them tough, I flattened my dough balls onto waxed paper, folded it  over it, then rolled it out. The oil on the balls help to peel it off paper easily.  Though you will have to replace the paper every couple of wraps, as the paper gets "worn" from the rolling and will stick .
After making these a couple of times, I decided to add a touch of zing to mine, a couple of shakes of onion powder added to the flour mix  adds a very nice touch without being overwhelming. I never buy them in a store now, compared to these, the packaged ones in the bread aisle are like trying to swallow a wool blanket.  Happy eating!

These get a 5 star all the way from us!  Hubby is Mexican-American and I HAD to learn to make tortillas for him.  This is the recipe I always use!  He used to help his grandmother make tortillas, so he was with me the first few times I made these.  He taught me that you can use different fats to change the taste of the tortilla, as well.  He loves his made with lard (ugh, I know) or cold bacon grease (which is my new favorite!).  If you use cold unsalted butter, they have a little bit of a sweet taste and are great for sopapillas (sp?) and sweet fillings.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!!!!!!!

My grandmother (Spaniard) used to make tortillas like this all the time! These were so yummy. I cut the recipe down to yeild 8 servings and totally eye-balled the hot water. WARNING: Too much shortening will produce a tough and flaky dough! Also, gradually adding the water will allow you to adjust to maintain a really soft, pliable dough that's deliciously bendable. :) Thanks!

Nope, this is not the recipe we've all been looking for. Although it didn't taste bad (in fact, it was pretty yummy), it just didn't taste like a tortilla. It was more like a thin, flat tea biscuit or something. I admit that I did add a bit more shortening, as per others' suggestions, but I don't think that was responsible for the non-tortilla taste. I prefer the Authentic Tortilla recipe on this site.

The dough wasn't the easiest to work with.  I don't know how a person is supposed to knead by hand when the dough is blistering hot with boiling water.  In the end, I also had to use at least 2 cups of water to get a reasonably soft dough, and had to wait between pourings to be able to tough the dough without burning my hands.  I rolled them as thin as I could and ended up with about 15 8 inch tortillas.  60 is a huge exaggeration.  If you need a lot of tortillas, you'll have to adjust this recipe.  Also, they only took about 30 seconds total to cook.  Turned out soft, tasty, and wonderful, when all was said and done.  A lot of work rolling them out, but I'll get a tortilla press and it will be easier.  I'll make these twice a month or so.  Much cheaper than store bought, and better tasting.

These are fun and easy to make, and my family prefers them to store-bought.  In a pinch the other day, I bought some tortillas, and my family all agreed thay my home-made ones were much better. Definitely a keeper!

My daughters wanted to make homemade tortillas so we looked this recipe up.  The final product was okay, but the proportions must be way off!  If the original recipe makes 5 dozen are they the size of quarters?  We rolled ours very thin and never came close to the amount specified, other than that it was a fun day making our own tortillas.

This is the best recipe.  I mix the dough up in my food processor so it only takes a second.  The dough is easy to roll out and makes tortillas that taste way better than the store.  I loved that they were thicker so they didn't fall apart or rip like the store bought ones do.  My husband loves them.  I will never buy from the store again.  It's much cheaper too!

I tried another recipe for tortillas and it wasn't as good as this one. I used butter for the shortening and they turned out great - the tortillas were soft and delicious. I followed other reviewers' suggestions to limit the amount of rolling I did with the rolling pin. I just pushed hard and rolled once, then turned it 180 degrees and did the same.

I make tortillas every day. Some tips would be to not add too much BP, it will make hard tortillas! No more than 1 tsp. for a recipe this size. Also, knead only until well-combined, this is not a bread recipe and over-kneading will also make them tough. I suggest letting dough balls rest, and refrigerating them (just throw 'em in a plastic container) for a few hours before using.  You can also keep the dough balls for a week, refrigerated in the same container.

I tried this recipe because it had such good reviews and I have been wanting to try to make my own tortillas.  I have to admit that I really didn't think it would turn out.  Boy, I was wrong.  The recipe was terrific and so easy to make.  At first, I was making them too thick but once I got the hang of it, it was smooth sailing!  So good.  Thank you for posting the recipe.

I absolutely loved this tortilla recipe! im 13 and have a very simple knowledge of cooking, and i made these tortillas perfectly by myself and with no help from adults. :P  ...btw, i don'y know why some reviews have said they were tough to roll out. i just oiled the dough well with olive oil before letting it rest, and put some flour on the counter, and it was really easy to just roll them out with my hands. also, the taste was delicious! My older brother loved them too!

Yum. Yes, took some time, but just think, no preservatives or weird chemicals you can not pronounce. Perfect as written for a savory filling, but I might add a little sugar to the dough to make sopapillas from these. I cut the recipe in 1/4 and it made 12 perfect 6 inch tortillas.

This was my second time making tortillas.  They were a little hard to roll out in the beginning, but they are very easy once you get the hang of it.  I never want to get store bought ones again!

Usually, I use a different recipe from this site, and they taste ok, but these are soooooo much better!! They tasted great, and the texture was perfect. I did use rendered bacon fat, because I didn't have lard, but yum!

I decided to make this a bit more nutritious by using whole wheat flour for half the flour.  I also used the suggestion of another reviewer and used bacon lard instead of shortening since I had it on hand.  Halving the recipe was much more manageable.

Good recipe for homemade tortillas. The only problem I had was that they became hard after cooking. I will try again with less cook time.

This was awful! I went by the recipe but I only needed about 5 instead of 60 so I had the computer custom the recipe for me and it was WRONG! It was nothing but a hard dough that just crumbled! So I guess you need to make all 60 for them to turn out right.....there is only two in my family! What a waste of good ingredients!

Excellent tortillas! I scaled down the recipe to 20 and made them bigger and thicker so I only got 5 but that was plenty for my husband and myself. I used olive oil instead of shortening. I'm adding these to my recipe box!

These were surprisingly easy to make. The hardest part was getting the tortillas to be round! They tasted even better than the ones in the store, but looked just like them.

I had a difficult time keeping the "dough" together and ended up adding more shortening.  I used the dough to wrap up cheesecake and fry it.  We got the idea from Aunt Chilada's in Hilton Head.  take it out of the fryer and roll it in cinnamon/sugar just like a donut and eat it over cinnamon/sugar ice cream...delish!

I've never made tortillas before and decided to try this recipe because it seemed pretty simple. I don't know what I was expecting but it definitely wasn't what I got!! Still definitely delicious, and I know I didn't follow the recipe to a T (I only had margerine as shortening, and I cut the recipe down to 12 - I only got 6 small ones!) but when I tore off pieces of the first tortilla straight off the stove, it was so scrumptious I couldn't believe it! Soft, steamy middle, crisp outside... yum. :) My only word of advice is WATCH YOUR BUBBLES! They will burn very quickly but leave the rest of the side pretty uncooked after you turn them over. My advice: press them down while you're frying them.

I used coconut oil in place of the shortening.  This recipe makes a very soft dough that is easy to roll thin.

I used this recipe for my pastallio shell. I haven't been able to find one that had the right consistancy but this one worked. I will try it as a tortilla next time. I followed the directions as listed except I let it set a bit longer than instructed.

I am changing our review on this recipe!  I actually reviewed this recipe on March 16 after the first time I made it.  I only gave it 4 stars that time.   I just made it again today.  I made it (half of it)into fried taco bowls.  I did add more salt  (about 1/2 tsp. for the half recipe)  than it calls for and made sure the water was boiling.  This was the softest easiest "bread" type recipe I have ever rolled out.  When I fried them, they were perfect.  Definitely a great recipe!  The half recipe made 8 large finely rolled tortillas that were about 10 inches in diameter!

I scaled the recipe down to half which should have made 30 servings, but I only ended up with 11 tortillas,that were about 7 inches, and I did use golf ball size amounts of dough. The flavor and the texture were wonderful. Thank you for the great recipe!

My grandma just recently passed away a few weeks ago, I will miss her tortillas but can honestly say that these are so close to how she made them right down to rolling the dough in little balls first. Thanks for the authentically great tasting tortillas!

I halved this recipe because I just didn't think I could make tortillas.  Well, they turned out fabulous.  When DH came home I had him taste one and he looked at me and said, YOU made those?  You MADE tortillas?  Easy as pie I said.  Great, easy recipe.  They didn't take as long as I thought they would either.

We eat tortillas often and did not care for this recipe. They need more salt and way more liquid for a soft, pliable dough. After making the dough, it was such a disaster we had to throw it away. If you want a much better recipe, I recommend Tortillas II from this site. The ratios to flour and liquid are much, much better.

Excellent!!! I will never buy tortilla shells again. I am living in Salzburg and the shells are so expensive (10 for $4,65). That I thought I would try to make them myself. They came out perfect and rolling them on parchment paper makes the job really easy. Try them you won't regret it. Each tortilla takes less than a minute to cook so do not overcook. Cover with a clean towel as you work. Good Luck!!

These came out great for me.  I read many reviews suggesting adding extra salt which i did not do because I wanted to try the recipe "as is" first.  Next time I will add 1/2 tsp. more salt...but that is a matter of personal preferance.  Tortilla making is much easier than expected!  We used them for fajitas.  I can't wait to make these again and try a batch of chicken enchiladas!

one of the best ideas for parties.cheap and tasty. i enjoyed making them with my boyfriend (it's much easier and faster to prepare them in a team)
however, i had to double the recipe because it gives only a few tortillas. definitely not the amount described in a recipe.

I made these tortillas tonight for supper and received rave reviews from my 17 year old, he told me 3 times throughout supper how great they were. I will definitely be using this recipe often and am now thinking of purchasing a pasta machine for this purpose. Because I used these for chicken caesar wraps, I added garlic to the recipe. Can't wait to try other flavour combinations! I have some dough left and am thinking of mixing in cinnamon and splenda to use for snacking on instead of chips. I will not use store bought again, I love the idea of controlling what I put in them, and no preservatives. Awesome recipe, thank you for sharing Esther!

this recipe was a life saver,i was baby sitting hungry children and needed some tortillas for breakfast.so, i decided to make them (being my first time). i am hispanic and i never learn to make them, but this recipe was easy!while i was cooking the tortillas on the iron grill i found that leaving it to long on the grill will  make the tortilla hard. i then put the tortilla on the grill and wait for the bottom of the tortilla to get a white color then i flip it and waited to see little slightly bubbly on top and then i flip it again and press the tortilla with a clean cloth around the edges untii i seen it puff up.then i took it out. they were perfect.it did need more salt!
but the kids didn't care because they love them and ate them all.(lol)

These work out perfectly, but you might need a little practice and patience.  This can be a fun thing for the family as everyone can help to make them.  As others have said, it's hard to imagine getting 60 from this recipe, unless you make them verrrry small.  You might need a little more shortening (I used butter) or salt.  They were soft and everyone loved them.  I now make a double batch every time and put the extras in the freezer for future use as they freeze well if they are properly wrapped up.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe!  My husband and I cook a lot (and love it) and this was the first tortilla recipe that came out soft!  The secret is the baking powder, which seems to thicken them up and makes them soft.  These were the best tortillas we've ever tried!

Now for the changes we made.  I cut it down to 5 servings for the servings for my husband and myself, which is the perfect size for 2.

We also use an electric tortilla maker, and this recipe is perfect for it.  It's my husband's job to put the tortillas in and make them once they are on the tortilla maker (which cooks them and makes them perfectly round, and rather perfect).

I used more salt and more water in this recipe than called for, as I cook a lot and I can "tell" that it needed to be more bread like.  

I did not roll them out with a rolling pin.  I did not lubricate the top with oil or cover for 10 minutes.

I put all the ingredients in a bowl, used my hand mixer, added more hot water and salt to taste (and feel).  

Rolled them into 3 balls (which were really too small for the tortilla maker), and while rolling them used more flour, several times.

Then I had my husband put them in the tortilla maker to cook and they came out great, and tasted the BEST ever.

I also always use real BUTTER for shortening in any recipe that calls for shortening and it has always exceeded my taste expectations.  This was no different.  The tortillas came out soft (reather than hard) and also were delicious!

This was my first time making homemade tortillas and this did NOT work.  My husband tried it a second time and he has been making tortillas all his life and it did NOT work for him either.  I will keep searching for a better recipe. He thinks it had way too much flour.

Easier in some respects than I thought, but harder in others than I thought.  mixing it up was easy, rolling it out was difficult.  Maybe a wetter dough would be easier to work with.

Nothing special, quite dry. I ended up adding 1/4 tsp. per tortilla half way into them even after using the full cup and a half of water. If you add extra water, they taste okay. Needs something more for flavor.

This was my first attempt at making tortillas, so I was a little nervous. So glad I chose this recipe! I cut the recipe in half and added a tbs of butter to the shortening. I had no problem rolling out the dough, it was very easy. It only made about 12 larger tortillas (what I was hoping for.) They are so soft and taste amazing! They were a big hit!

These were not good.  Me nor my husband liked them, they tasted like dough.  We even fried them in butter later and it still tasted bad.  Not sure what I could have done different.  Used another recipe before that tasted fine.

After watching my Tex-Mex boyfriend make homemade tortillas, I was a little intimidated. There is definitely a "trick" to it but this recipe and the tips made my first effort come out great!! I may struggle to get him to make them now that he knows I can do it. . .

First, the ingredients ratio for this recipe (Tortillas I) seem way off: the suggested serving implies that 1 cup of flower is going to produce 12 golf-ball-sized hunks of dough.  No way!   Followed the recipe exactly, let them rest, rolled them out paper thin, cooked them until they bubbled and browned a little.  Looked nice!  They tasted like... raw flour.  Very bland raw flour.   (Seemed they could have used more shortening and salt.)  They were also somewhat brittle, breaking rather than bending.  Sorry, I don't mind the effort, but there's something amiss or missing here.

When I first cooked these, I thought they seemed stiff for tortillas, then realized that they soften when you stack them and keep them warm with the towel.  Very nice--better than store-bought and simple.  The recipe also works well with whole wheat flour added.

I really wanted fajitas for dinner and we didn't have any tortillas. I thought "How hard could it be to make tortillas?" They turned out fantastic and well worth the effort. They were way better than the ones in the store, no preservatives.

I just came back from Tijuana last week and was in the mood for homemade tortillas (especially after having some fresh tortillas) - I was quite disappointed with the taste of these tortillas.  I did use 1 tsp salt and added a bit more vegetable shortening.  I mixed it by hand to make sure the vegetable shortening was well blended with the flour - then used my KitchenAid to kneed the dough with the boiling water (boiling water helps make the dough more pliable - hence easier to work with and roll out).  As just about everyone else stated - the amounts are off.  I made about 20 tortillas.   I probably could have made about 24 had I rolled them thinner - but I prefer my tortillas a little thicker.  I cooked half and refrigerated the remaining uncooked tortillas wrapped in plastic wrap.  The dough held in the refrigerator for a couple days until they were all used up.  I will keep searching for a better recipe.

These were really good with some tweaking.  I doubled the salt and added just a pinch of sugar.  The servings didn't work out for me either, but I didn't use a tortilla press and that could make a difference.  Overall we were really impressed by the texture, taste and ease of this recipe.  If I weren't so lazy I might never buy tortillas again.  Realisticly, I may still buy them, but not as often!

Great tortillas--but I find that you have to have more water and at the end kneading in extra flour.

While the taste was good, my tortillas came out a little stiff.  Also, it was very difficult to roll out the tortillas flat enough. I think a tortilla press would be a great help.  A good recipe, but not as easy as I had hoped.

I was so impressed with this recipe. I have never made tortillas before and it was a bit daunting, being male and not always the master in the kitchen, but even I found it simple enough and they were just great. Easy, relatively fast and delicious  - and my wife even asked if I would please make them again in future !

My family has used this recipe for months and it is great. It tastes great and it's easy to make. My 10 year old makes them using our tortilla press we bought at a little Mexican grocery. We do sub the shortening with butter or coconut oil though. Love, Love, LOVE!

This was my first time making tortillas. I thought mine were a little thick once I started eating them (used them to make quesadillas) but my boyfriend absolutely loved the thickness and the taste. As with other reviews, I added a bit more salt and I also added some basil. I know this probably sounds silly but the dough was extremely hot once I added the boiling water. I had to let it cool for a bit before I started mixing it.

These turned out great, followed the recipe (but used hot tap water instead of boiling). Had to knead for a lot longer than expected. Rolling was tough, but I found that stretching the dough at intervals during rolling really helped. Turned out soft and very fold-able for fajitas!

I halved this recipe and got about 14 tortillas, all different shapes & sizes, lol!  Anyway, they do need more flavor, double the salt.  They were easy to roll out. I used my tortilla press and it only pressed out tiny baby tortillas. So, I would finish rolling them out with a rolling pin. I do need more practice rolling them out. They are pliable and didn't break.  My grandmother made fresh homemade tortillas and stored them wrapped in foil and then wrapped a kitchen towel around them.  They were placed in a plastic bowl in the microwave.  They would stay nice and fresh and pliable this way.

Other recipes I've tried have an almost rubbery texture to it, but this one is 'fluffier' (for lack of a better word). My mom used to make homemade tortillas when I was little, but started buying store bought ones as I got older. I recently asked her for the recipe, but she couldn't remember it. I've tried several recipes, and this is the closest one to hers.

This was my first attempt at making tortillas and I found the process fun and the results quite yummy. Rolling the tortilla from the center and then flipping was a helpful pattern that I would not have discovered on my own.  They cook quickly, almost faster that seems possible, yet they are done and tender.  I chose to make a half batch in the event they were not to my liking.  A half batch made 10 taco sized tortillas.  I used a inverted bowl as a template to cut perfect circles after I had rolled them and it worked well. Thank you for the recipe.

I've never made tortillas before and thought I'd give this a try :)!  I certainly need practice, but they came out good and I had a lot of fun!  I definitely agree that a tortilla press would come in handy simply because I had a hard time getting them thin enough without over working them.  Also, for those who are used to store bought tortillas, these are much smaller. They are bout 6 inches across.   The taste MUCH better though!

I used this recipe for the first time I ever made tortillas. The recipe was very easy to follow but tortillas were really hard to roll out.  Before you attempt to make this make sure you have a good rolling pin and you might want to cook for more like 45 sec on each side.

More like a water cracker than a soft tortilla. Friends suggested more lard and salt. I liked the idea of less calories, which is why I tried this recipe.

These are great when you can get them thin enough. We don't have a tortilla press, so its kind of difficult, but we have managed and they turned out with a nice texture and delicious. Even after keeping one day in the fridge they were still good.

Thanks for posting this recipe but the salt amount is way OFF. I made the first tortilla and it tasted like just cooked flour. I ended up sprinkling salt on my work surface, hoping it absorbs some saltiness then I experimented with adding some cumin seeds and sea salt....  it turned out great.

This was my first experience with making tortillas.  We have been using so many store-bought ones that I thought I should try to make my own.  I'm so glad that I did.  This recipe was so easy.  For our preferences, I tried it using only whole wheat flour, and only made 1/2 batch in case they didn't turn out well.  I also doubled the salt.  I did need to add quite a bit more water since I was using the whole wheat flour and it was a dry winter day.  I bake a lot of bread, so I've already learned that the amount of water needed  depends on the humidity and the type of flour you're using.  I made mine bigger, only got 15 out of half the recipe.  I rolled them very thin, and cooked them in my non-stick skillet on med/high heat for about 45-60 seconds on each side.  No more store-bought tortillas for us!

I tried this recipe as my first attempt at making torillas. Overall it turned out very well. I did have some interesting shapes including the accidental heart shaped one. I think a tortilla press my be in my future. I used 4 tablespoons margarine and about 1 1/4 cup boiling water. I used my breadmaker (dough/pasta setting or another non-baking cycle) to knead the dough. The breadmaker cut down on the work and also kept the dough warm while I was rolling out the tortillas. I made a full batch which was good because there were some bloppers. My electric stove was much too hot on the med high setting, about medium or a little less worked best for me.

Excellent! I have been searching for a tortilla recipe for years. They always ended up like crackers. I saw that this recipe had less shortening which made me nervous, but proof was in the tortilla!  I had bacon grease on hand from breakfast and added that to the griddle before placing the tortillas on to cook. **NOTE** I used twice the amount of salt just for my personal taste. I also used all the water recommended (not boiling just hot) and even added about 1/4 cup more after everything was mixed because my dough still looked like flakes of flour handed got sticky yet.  Love them!!

These are pretty good. But I was skeptical about the amount of salt in the recipe so I upped it to 3/4 of a teaspoon. Still fell a little flat but I am glad that I did increase the salt amount or they would have been flavorless. Also I had to add about an extra 1/2 T of shortening to the flour mixture because I couldn't get it to the right texture with just the 2T.

These were okay, but almost the same recipe as the "Homemade Flour Tortillas" on this site - and those are MUCH easier to roll out for some reason.  Those are also more flavorful.  Glad I tried these, but I'm sticking with the Homemade Flour Tortillas because of ease of preparation.

these are the best ever! my family is hooked and doesn't like the store bought ones anymore. I add about a 1/2 teaspoon of yeast and it helps make extra bubbles, have to be careful about letting the dough get cold or it doesn't roll well. I also like to use butter flavored shotening.

I made these twice - the first time they were not good.  The second time I halved the recipe, used 1 T softened butter, added more salt, and used about 1 cup boiling water.  Let rise 15 minutes.  The best tip on this board is cook only 1-2 minutes on medium low heat (my burner was at about 3.5).  They did not brown up, but were cooked and stay pliable.  Second batch is delicious.  Also, let go of the round shape.  Much easier to make then.  1/2 of this recipe yielded 12 tortillas.

Excellent recipe. I have moved to Singapore and my son misses the mexican food availble in US,used to buy them from the store but the ones that u get here are not as fresh- have a long way to travel. tried this recipe they came out perfect. I used the fork in the beginning to mix the hot water and alter kneaded them with my hands.I substituted whole wheat flour + flour (50-50). they were perfect. Had no problems rolling them either..

this is the first recipe I have ever given a 1 star.  They seemed dry, the dough was really tough so it was incredibly hard to roll out, and I am sweating and my arms are sore from rolling out 8 tortillas, which was the yield from half a batch.  I rolled as hard as I could, and they are thin, but probably not thin enough.  for all the effort, they don't even taste that good.  need a bit more flavor...maybe more salt.  sorry, but i won't make this one again.  i will keep looking for a easier recipe.  they aren't even very round.  i am embarassed to show my husband, because everything i cook usually comes out great.  i think i will use these in enchiladas so he can't see what they look like!

Really good recipe. Only difficult thing was getting the tortillas flat enough (they rise when cooked). Also I found that "golf ball" sized dough was not large enough, I doubled the size.

This was a wonderfully easy and tasty recipe.  My 12-year-old daughter made these tortillas by herself, and we ate them along with "Refried Beans Without the Refry."  Wouldn't change a thing!

These are awesome! Better than the store bought kind, nice and tender. Next time I make them I'm going to use bigger dough balls to get bigger tortillas. Yum definitely try these!

OMG These are so much better than store bought!  A little tricky to roll out, but I assume that gets easier with practice! I did need a little more water than suggested here to get the right texture.  Overall, nice!

After trying another recipe on this site twice, I tried this one as noted by another reviewer.  This turned out very, very, good.  The previous recipe I tried had way to much fat and the tortillas were flaky like pie crust. I made them a second time reducing the fat by half and they were still flaky (my pie crust should be so good!).  When I tried this recipe I was a little worried it wasn't going to have enought fat since it has less than 1/4 the fat as the other one.  Well, his was almost perfect.  They were just a little tough, so don't know if I worked the dough to much or if it needs a smidge more fat.  (Pretty sure it needs a smidge more fat--Of course, I was the only one who noticed they were tough.)
Tortillas are very expensive where I live and never fresh, so this is going to make me very popular!! I will give you credit, Esther, of course!

I have never made tortillas before, but thought that I would try.  I know that they are called "flour" tortillas, but mine were a little too floury.  I might try one more time and see if that was just a one time issue.  A tip that I read on the website to roll out the dough was to put the ball of dough in a big ziploc bag and roll it out.  That seemed to work really well for me!

These turned out great!  I have made them twice and the first time I made them I decided to roll them all out at once and then cook them.  This made them a bit brittle, but still pliable.  When I made them the second time, I made these with a friend, so we cooked them as soon as they were rolled out.  It made a big difference to cook the tortilla after it is rolled out because it stays softer until it is used up.  Don't forget to wrap them in a clean dish cloth and store in a bag.  They won't dry out.

It worked okay.  I did half whole wheat, half unbleached all-purpose flour.  The whole wheat made it harder to work with, but my husband liked it.

I thoroughly enjoyed making and eating these tortillas.  I brushed garlic olive oil on top of the dough before it rested and, using a paper towel, moistened the cast-iron skillet before cooking the tortillas.  Too, as suggested in other reviews, added a bit more salt. Yummmmm!

4 cups of flour, 3 tsps baking powder, 1 1/2 salt, 1/4 cup shortening and a little more that 1 cup of hot tap water, for me this made about 10 to 12 tortillas.  The dough was soft but not sticky.  I let the dough sit about 40 min and did not need to dust the rolling surface with flour.  At fist they appeared to be hard but after sitting in tortilla warmer for several minutes they were soft and pliable.

As many said, the servings were off, but maybe it's just the 'idea' of a serving that's off.  I crave tortillas sometimes and can't always run to the store to buy them.  Store bought tortillas are great if I have them, but these were really good.  The dough is easy to work with, it rolled out well.  The taste was good too.  Maybe a touch more salt next time.  I did like the fresh taste and the fact that they were quick and easy.  I can roll them however thick/thin I want & whatever size I want.  The recipe is in my box as a keeper.

I have never made tortillas before, but my husband requested that we try. We made them together (he never helps me cook!) and we had so much fun making them. They were delicious! We both raved about them! I doubled the shortening and doubled the salt. Roll them out as thin as you can, and they are perfect! Also, don't cook them too long or they are too hard. Mine only needed to cook about 30 seconds. They are cheaper and better than store-bought tortillas. We loved them!

These were pretty good.  They came out soft, but needed a bit more salt for my taste.  Also only made 22 8 inch tortillas, but I may not have rolled them as thin as they could have been.  Wish I could get my grandma's recipe, but she says she never measures anything.

When I scaled this recipe to make one dozen tortillas, it really came up short.  I was able to get four relatively small tortillas.  However the taste was wonderful.  My friends really enjoyed the tortillas.

When I was ten or so, there was a lady that used to make tortillas for us kids in the neighborhood and they were so good. I have searched the world over for a recipe that even comes close to hers and this is it! I loved them and so did my daughter and husband! They want me to make them again. I definitely will recommend these to whoever will listen.    But, the recipe could use a little more salt, and that's easy!! :o)

I don't know how these could've turned out with such a high ratio of flour to shortening, perhaps I did something wrong, but didn't work out-it just seemd like I had way too much flour, and when I added all the water, it still wasn't coming together. I prefer the recipe on here titled Authentic Mexican Tortillas.

I have tried a different recipe on here before, they turned out okay...but nothing better than the tortillas in the store...this recipe was so delicious! I did use some olive oil inside the mixture to give a little flavor and also make it easier to roll out. Although I didn't think this would turn out well, after making, my 3 year old couldn't resist eating one plain, so I tried it and it was just 100% better than store bought, and the sautéed chicken I made to go on it with a touch of ranch dressing went so well together! Thank you so much for this recipe! Very much appreciated! :) I will always make homemade tortillas from now on!!!!

We loved this recipe but I did make a few changes. I added a bit more salt and a lot more shortening. My tortillas rolled out easily and cooked wonderfully in a lightly-greased skillet. We'll definitely be having these again!

We all thought these were great! I couldn't find my Crisco, so I used lard. What an easy recipe! They were perfect!

These were delicious. I will make them exactly like this again and again. The hardest part by far was rolling the tortillas out. I am thinking about finding a good tortilla press to expedite the process, as I foresee making these from now on instead of purchasing them. I don't know if the recipe was off or if it was due to user error but I didn't get anywhere close to 60 tortillas out of these.

easy easy tortillas!  Taste just like the ones that you can get at any tortilla factory restaurant.  Even though its easy, it does take a bit of time and practice.  Not a bad trade off when you bite into them for the first time!

These were great!  I overcooked the first one, and it turned out crispy.  The rest were all soft and tasted wonderful!

I've tried many tortilla recipes on this site and this is honestly the first one that had a taste even remotely close to what I wanted or liked.  I really like the texture of these and they're very easy to make.  Thanks for sharing. =)

These were very easy to make.  The dough was soft and easy to work with.  I will add more salt next time though.  I am living in China and good tortillas are on the the things I miss the most!  Thank you!

I like this recipe but I found the torillas little too hard, they keep breaking when I make wraps. So I tried to add an extra cup of boilng water and instead of baking powder I use dired yeast. Now it's perfect. Better than store bought. And I make them from 100% whole wheat flour.

Yay! I made tortillas! Excellent recipe. As a personal preference I will add a bit more salt next time. I followed the recipe and it was great! Thank you for sharing. I just purchased a tortilla press on Amazon to make this easier next time. The rolling takes some time but it was fun :)

This is a great low-fat, low-salt recipe.  I modified it just a bit by using half white and half whole-wheat flour.  I also needed just a tiny bit more water.  My family loves these!

very good, but oh so time consuming for a new tortilla maker. I suggest making these in the evening if you have small children. I put the left overs in the freezer and I am hoping they freeze well. I am glad these make a lot.  I would hate to do all that work and have every single last one eaten every time I make them.

I make this weekly.  I carefully measure everything and weigh my flour but it seems to turn out just a bit different depending on the humity/temp in the house.  If they seem dry I just add a few more tablespoons of water and the tortillas turn out just fine.  95% of the time the recipe works out perfect as written.  Our kids love these and will no longer eat the store bought ones.

The recipe looks good. Only issue I had was that when I used my torilla press to make it, the tortilla keeps pulling back to a smaller size (6/7 inches to 4/5 inches).

I follwed the recipe, but these came out hard and tasteless. I dont know what i did wrong. I wanted to make beef soft tacos and these would break when folded in half.. For now i'll keep on with the store bought ones.

To be honest at first it is very difficult to roll and cook these tortillas but once you get the hang of it and let go of them not being perfect circles it's pretty simple. One big recommmendation I have is to ensure that each side of the tortilla is cooked on med-low heat for exactly a minute. Do not let it get brown at all. The only color change you should see is from the color of the dough to a pale white. This way they stay pliable and tender enough.

Thanks for this fast and easy recipee. I have always wanted to make some homemade tortillas but thought it would be difficult. I was wrong, this recipee was a good one, I just added a little bit more water and next time I would add just a little bit more salt. But other then that this recipee was a success. Thanks once again ..   Chef Bernard Paul

I would not recommend this recipe at all!  I spent a good portion of my childhood in rural mexico and was hoping to find a recipe similar to the tortillas I had as a kid. this fell way short of that mark.  It was too dry and not enough salt.  Will keep looking for a recipe.

Really good! My first attempt gave me thick, inedible tortillas that were crunchy on the outside and doughy inside, but the next time I used a touch less water and flattened them with a tortilla press and they were excellent.  Having someone else in the kitchen to help made a world of difference!

I followed the recipe almost exactly -- except I halved it. It yeilded eleven 7-8" tortillas.  They taste great! Maybe where some are having the problem is adding extra shortening?  Even though mine didn't look like the consistency of 'cornmeal', I didn't add any more shortening.  Also, I let it rest a bit longer after forming into balls.  I was busy chopping veggies to fill the tortillas with!  Thanks so much for sharing.

These were great! It was the first time I've ever made tortillas and they came out well. The dough was super easy and didn't need any adaptations. Make sure you have ample time because it takes a while to roll out each tortilla. By the way, I found golf ball size balls too small. I made balls close to twice that size.

Wow!  This is fantastic!  I used my Kitchen aid mixer and they came together beautifully.  I also used my pasta machine to roll the dough out, then I cut the dough into triangles and fried them!  Yum - the best tortilla chips I have ever had!  No more store bought chips or tortillas for me!

My boyfriend LOVED these, however, I thought they were so-so. I think I've probably been spoiled by Mission tortillas.. hehe.

Very tasty & muy autentico! I also found that the quantities are way off.  I made a half batch and got 15, not 30 but it's ok.  I know I made them relatively thin but more what the store calls "fajita size" and not the smaller size.  The dough was easy to work with.  I would add more salt but it was easy & fast!  Thanks!

Being lazy inspired me to try this recipe. I did not feel like going to the store, just to buy tortilas, so I decided to make them. I was pleasantly suprised by how simple and quick they were to make. I'm sure my technique isn't perfect, but I did find them a bit heavier than store bought. I rolled them out very thin, but I didn't find that they shrunk very much. They had a much fresher and cleaner taste, though. And that was certainly worth it. Very good. I will definanty be making these again.

I cut the recipe down to 12 tortillas,as I didn't need to make 60 tortillas.I don't know if it was the amount I made or I did something wrong.However,the recipe didn't yield 12 tortillas,as it made 4 servings.Still the dough didn't rise like I thought it would.I used all new ingredents.They did taste ok,but not like store bought ones.

These are good, but don't quite have the authentic flavor of homemeade tortillas. Mine didn't have quite the authentic shape or thinness for that matter! (I'm sure not the fault of the recipe :-)...) But definitely yummy, and I'm sure the shapes and sizes come with practice. I'll make again, and probably fool around with the recipe a bit. They were fun!

I had a heck of a time getting this dough thin enough. I must not of kneaded it enough but it sure felt like it! These did taste good but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to make them again.

Worked out fine- I halved the recipe and only got 10 tortillas- so I agree that the quantity is off... Pretty easy- I doubled the shortening and used more water but then I had to even it up with some flour- I got a good consistency- the hardest part was rolling out a circle!  I'll use the recipe again :)

I have tried numerous times to make tortillas like my grandma, I followed the recipe exactly and they didnt turn out as well. I would recomend using lard instead of shortning and some more salt...other than that it is a good recipe.

I've never made tortillas before and these turned out great! Better than store-bought and fun to make. I doubled the salt, and I think I accidentally doubled the shortening, too. I also tried substituting whole wheat flour for half the white flour and I thought they were just as good.

After reading the other reviews, I added one more tablespoon of shortening, and added more water to get the dough to form a ball. I used my mixer with a dough-hook attachment, which made mixing really easy. I thought they turned out really well, tasted good.  I got 20, 7-8inch tortillas. I wiil make these again!

Way too much work without enough of a reward.  These were okay, but there's a restaurant near my house where they make the tortillas in front of you and this recipe doesn't hold a candle to their's--they just lack flavor, a certain something.

This is a very good tortilla recipe-they're just like in the resturaunts. They sure weren't fun to roll out, but I guess I am probably pretty wimpy.

This was my first attempt at making homemade tortillas and the recipe was great!  They came out a little floury, but I think that was because I used too much flour during the rolling process.  I do agree with some of the other reviewers who said that they didn't need cooked quite so long.  I probably cooked the tortilla for 30-45 seconds on each side and that was perfect.  Thank you for this great recipe!

I really wished I had read the 1* reviews. The only way this recipe makes 60 servings is if you're making 3" tortillas. I assumed the recipe was for 6" tortillas. I changed serving size from 60 to 18 and made the dough per instructions, kneading until all the little pieces that kept breaking off were incorporated. What I had at that point was a very hard ball of dough. I let it rest for 15 minutes then divided it into 4 smaller balls, since I wanted closer to a 12" tortilla. As one reviewer stated, rolling out this dough was difficult. I must have worked on the 1st one for around 5 minutes and ended up with a lopsided 10" tortilla rolled paper thin. After cooking I had a tortilla that was somewhat pliable in the middle but crispy around the edges. In all I got three 10-11 inch tortillas. I had made the Chef John tortillas before and they were soft and stretchy. My mistake for trying a different recipe.

Olga’s tip was right. My tortillas were coming out tough and leathery because I was over rolling them. I did the roll, turn, flip rotate to minimize as she recommended with this recipe, which is quite good by the way. When I put them on the fry pan, they really puffed well. I don’t have access to a tortilla press which would probably be good but making tortillas by hand is such a blast.

I definitely prefer homemade tortillas.  This recipe is simple and easy.  

I have an 8" cast iron tortillas press and it's a lot easier than rolling.  When using a tortilla press, place the ball slightly off center toward hinge.  

Another recipe uses lard and also suggests an occasional bacon fat substitute.  Both worked nicely with this simple recipe.

I have made these 2 times but this time I forgot to add 1 cup flour. I'm actually happy That I made that mistake because I ended up with a dough that is much softer and easier to roll and they come out a little softer and chewier tortilla. The original recipe with 5 cups flour is more time consuming because of the rolling. Ah and also used canola oil. This is my to go recipe

Very easy to make!  I cut the recipe in half, substituted olive oil for shortening, and rolled the dough a bit thicker to make roughly a dozen tortillas.

These tortillas are phenomenal! I don't think I'm ever going to buy tortillas at the store ever again. These are so simple and easy to make, and they are soft and delicious. My boyfriend and I were shocked that they tasted good even just by themselves, and they were wonderful for chicken soft tacos.

Very good, easy to work with.  Made them into tortilla rollups and the next day the tortilla was not as good.  If I could have heated them up they would have been fine though I'm sure, but since it was a "cold" appetizer couldn't do that, so did not hold it against my review of 4stars.

This was the first time that I made tortillas and everything worked out wonderfully. They were delicious, definately better than store bought. The only thing that I would change would be to add slightly more salt next time.

I picked 3 stars because as written this is an ok recipe.  However, I modified this by increasing the shortening to 1/3 cup and added about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of buttermilk into the flour just before adding the water.  The texture was exactly what we were looking for and they stayed fresh for over 24 hours.

They need more salt, but other than that, they are great!

there is no way that this recipe makes 5 dozen.  It was also way to much work for just a simple tortilla.  I will not use this one again....if it is this much work then it is not worth trying to make homemade.

Very easy to make and turned out great! I added a little bit more water as others suggested.

These tortillas were okay, but not the best I've ever had.  A Mexican friend of mine agreed.  My experience with this recipe: I had to use 1/2 cup more water than called for to keep the dough from falling apart; also, the dough only yielded 15 medium-sized tortillas, not 5 dozen.

I need practice, but they serve they're purpose.  Very easy to follow directions.  Mine tend to fall apart, which is probably all me.
