Healthy and delicious! I made a few changes.  Instead of frozen corn, I used canned sweet corn. I used about half the juice from the diced tomatoes and half from the corn. I don't typically like spicy foods, so I was worried three jalapenos would be too hot, but without the seeds, it was perfect.

Delicious! I used a 10 oz can of Rotel tomatoes instead of the large can of regular tomatoes so I added a few chopped cherry tomatoes to compensate. As written you get a nice side dish. Add an avocado and a hard boiled egg and it turns into a perfect meal even on-the-go. Thank you for the recipe.
