I had fun making this.  Had no problems whatsoever with the cake sticking to the pan or cracking.  Here is what I did.  I cut a piece of parchment paper to fit my pan then sprayed the edges of the pan with cooking spray.  I allowed the cake to cool about 20 minutes then I lifted it out of the pan with parchment paper stuck to the bottom of it and flipped it (carefully) on to another piece of parchment paper with a generous amount of powdered sugar sprinkled on it.  Then I just peeled the parchment off the bottom of the roll, spread on icing, sprinkled some finely chopped walnuts on top of icing and re-rolled the cake.  Wrapped it up on a piece of heavy duty foil and put it freezer for about 45 minutes to set up.  Then moved to fridge.  Just fantastic.  It's a beautiful presentation and the taste is incredible.  If you are hesitating to try because it looks difficult you should definitely try it!

This was a disaster when I tried to roll it. My icing popped out so that I could not roll it tightly. Using less icing may help, and if I ever try this again, I will chill the icing until it is fairly firm and allow the cake to cool longer. Four stars for taste, negative one star for being a pain....**Update- 2nd attempt: I used wax paper on the pan, then another sheet on the inside when I rolled it. This prevented it from sticking to the towel. Greasing it would be good too. I didn't soften the c. cheese as much and chilled it while the cake cooled. This made it much easier to spread w/out gushing out. Came out almost as good looking as the pics-- I'll keep trying! Tastes awesome.

The roll was pretty easy to make and tasted very good.  I have to admit the roll was moister than I probably would like.  I baked my cake in an 11X15 for the 15 minutes and it came out perfect.  I had no trouble rolling it up like described in the directions.  I had a lot extra filling (about Â½ worth).  I made two of these and found that making the filling while the cake is cooking and then putting the filling in the fridge until it is needed.  I found with my first one, I let my filling sit out and then when I spread it on the still warm cake that it made the filling more runner which is why I am suspecting the other review had the problem of it spilling out all over the place.  I would also suggest not putting the whole filling on unless you need it, this will help prevent the filling from spilling out everywhere.

I learn new tricks with this one every year...Couple of years ago I noticed the roll sticking to pan so I used wax paper under the mix and bake it that way before turning on the towel! 7 years with this recipe!

I have made this a number of time since I got the recipe. I use an 11x15 pan though. Just seems to turn out better in a larger pan. I also used wax paper on the bottom of my pan. On my first try I learned that the cake sticks to the wax paper after you remove it from the oven. So I sprayed the wax paper with cooking spray and it works great. I can carefully take the wax paper out of the pan and flip it over onto the damp towel. Also, to dampen the linen towel I over-wet a wash cloth and layed it on top of the towel in several places. It created a more even wetness on the towel. My family has gone crazy over this recipe. We all love it!

I wish there were more stars available, because I'd give this recipe ALL of them.  The method was a smidge difficult at first, but I'm pretty sure that's because I used a pan that was too small.  I have been using a half sheet pan recently, and it works PERFECTLY.  With that size, the cake is so thin that it's nearly impossible for it to break when you're rolling.  My husband, who has something to say about EVERYTHING, said "Well, I just can't fine one thing that I'd improve about this."  Only his mom and I know what a major deal that is, but you need to take my word for it!!!

The things I changed/altered:  
-- I used Egg Beaters, because I just never have eggs.
-- I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it worked beautifully.
-- I added extra nutmeg and cinnamon.  Totally personal preference, but the fall, spicy flavor really pops when you do that.

My family loved it.  I  keep one in the freezer for unexpected guest at all times. I didn't have any pumpkin spice so I used 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of nutmeg.  I also lined the cookie sheet with wax paper instead of flour.  It was easier getting the cake off the pan.  Great Recipe!!! Shantell

My family loves this recipe!! I think I already have about a dozen in my freezer!I line my pan with aluminum foil and a light pass with cooking spray.  After baking, I let it sitin the pan for a few minutes on a cooling rack, then instead of sprinkling a towel and flipping the pan over, I sprinkle powdered sugar,(generously), onto the cake.  Then I lay a towel onto the cake, then a cooling rack on top, and I flip the entire pan over.  I peel the foil off and roll up the towel and cake, leaving on the rack to cool.  By far the easiest way I've found to do it.

I made this and it came out like a dream, however my family LOVES jelly rolls so here is my "rolling secret. line the pan with wax paper and bake it on that when you take it out of the oven let it cool for a couple mins then sprinkle icing suger over a towel turn the cake out on it remove the wax paper and and sprinkle the top with icing sugar. now here is the important part; Roll it and let it cool in the rolled shape that way when you un roll it to fill it later it will naturaly want to roll rather then having to force it. and yes i always get the messy wonky ends that dont look nice. all you do is take a sharp knife and slice off the ends to get that pretty shape and you get to taste test the ends.

This was absolutely AWESOME!!!!!! I made this exactly the way the recipe called for, except I did use the 11 by 17 cookie sheet and it came out perfect. I also rolled it the second time the same direction I rolled the first time. No cracks!! Came out just like the picture. I used parchment paper and sprayed it with Pillsbury baking spray with flour in it.  This was my very first pumpkin roll and was very nervous about making it. I did roll it in a damp towel sprinkled with confectioners sugar like the recipe called for and I let it cool off for 25 minutes and had no problem with the icing squishing out or anything. Do follow this recipe exactly and you should have no problems.  My son in law said it tasted just like his grandmother made.  Didn't haave lemon juice, used vanilla like another reader did. Very goood!!! Even the pumpkin haters in my house liked it including me.  I wish I good give this more stars, will always use this recipe.  Thank you for a most wonderful recipe  Hope you have other recipes you can share with us

This is the pumpkin roll recipe that I use.  I chose it over the others on this site for its simplicity and because I dont like to use a million measuring cups/spoons when I'm baking.  I like that it uses more pumpkin (1 Cup opposed to 2/3 Cup) than other recipes.  This is a huge hit with my husband's friends at work, I get requests and preorders for them starting in September before the pumpkin even hits the shelves!  I make it exactly as the recipe states except I dont buy pumpkin pie spice and so just use a blend of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger instead.  Also instead of greasing and flouring the pan I just line it with parchment and then when I turn the cake out I roll it the first time with the parchment still on--really helps to avoid any issues with stickiness since this is a very moist cake. I am all about simplicity, and this recipe is just perfect in every way.

I can't attest to this actual recipe as I use my mom's pumpkin roll recipe, but I just wanted to drop a "rolling" hint.  We always just line the baking sheet with a large piece of aluminum foil before pouring in the batter.  Bake and when done, cool a few minutes in pan, then remove cake and foil from pan, using the foil ends as handles.  When cool (cools quickly), frost and roll by peeling foil off as you go.  I've never needed to grease the foil, it always peels off fine.

ABSOLUTE SUCCESS!!!  I was really nervous about taking on something that looked so complicated, but all the reviews helped!  I was given a pie pumpkin and I didn't want to waste it.  Never tried to cook a fresh pumpkin before.    Found this recipe and realized I had all the ingredients in the house, so I thought I would give it a try.  I added a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.  I also added another splash of vanilla to the filling along with an additional 1/4 cup of powdered sugar.  Used wax paper in the jelly roll pan, sprayed the pan, laid the wax paper, and sprayed the wax paper.  When the cake finished, I turned it out on the damp, powdered sugar dusted towel and kept the wax paper on top when I rolled it the 1st time.  I let it cool for 30 mins and kept the filling in the refrigerator during the cooling time.  After cooling, I took the wax paper off and spread all the filling.  The wax paper peeled off nicely as well as the towel.  After I rolled it, I cut off the spiral ends for better presentation, wrapped it in wax paper, then wrapped it in foil, and put it in the refrigerator.  Brought it in for potluck today.  Even the pumpkin haters LOVED it!  It was so easy and delicious.  Definitely a keeper.

I don't know what went wrong, but this just did not work for me at all! The taste was excellent, but the texture on the cake was like rubber. I did make it in a larger pan (11x15) because I didn't have a 9x13 jelly roll pan, but that shouldn't have affected the texture in that way! It just didn't seem to rise, it wasn't fluffy at all, and it was so rubbery! I'm not sure if that was the way this recipe is supposed to be, but all other pumpkin cake roll recipes I've seen have a more fluffy cake. Thanks for sharing, it tastes fantastic, but the texture is just not for me. I will be looking for a different recipe.

Big hit!  Hint:  don't try to lift the cake out of the pan, onto the towel (i.e., with the underside of the cake on the towel).  If you do that, the wrong side of the cake will be showing (I learned this the hard way!).  You need to stand the pan upright and ease it onto the towel, so that the top side is facing down.  When you roll it, it will show the pretty side on the outside.  This was a very pretty dessert.  Thanks for the recipe!

So easy and so delicious. Followed the recipe exactly + 1 tsp cinnamon and I used fresh pumpkin. Make sure your towel is only damp, NOT wet. If you can squeeze water out of it, it's too wet. To keep the cake from sticking to the towel I made sure there was a generous amount of powdered sugar on it before transferring the cake, then I gave the top of the cake a very light quick spray of Pam before rolling it up. Worked like a charm. No sticking and no cracks. I also lined the pan w/ wax paper and sprayed it w/ Pam so the cake wouldn't stick while baking. Don't let it cool too long past the 20 minutes before unrolling, you need the flexibility otherwise it will crack while unrolling. I will definitely make this again, and, again, and again.

I've been making this for years and years (over 10) and never used lemon juice.  Also, with the cream cheese, I never use just a teaspoon of vanilla.. I just pour it in until it tastes about right.  This is has been a staple for our holidays now since at least '98 and I always have to make multiple rolls for work parties plus I get a nice platter and a nice tea towel and give these out as Christmas gifts.  Homemade gifts mean more than junk from a store!  Also, I noticed that this didn't mention sprinkling powdered sugar on top of it before serving as the powdered sugar from the towel will have been absorbed by the cake.  Oh, and I prefer using Parchment Paper to using Wax Paper.. way less smoke in the oven from the wax paper and you don't have to try & figure out which side to use, doesn't matter.

Excellent.  Here are ways to help people with the icing problem!

1.  Let the cake completely cool.  If the cake is warm or hot the icing will melt into a gooey mess.   Keep it cool!

2.  Freeze the cake slightly for easy slicing, the more cold the frosting is, the less likely it is to leak.

3.  Use a nice sharp knife and quickly slice through the cake.  Make sure to not put to much pressure on the cake.

Due to a lack of time (and a little laziness), I made the batter in a 9x13, and then frosted them 20 minutes after bringing them out of the oven, rather than rolling them up.  We call them pumpkin bars, and they taste just as delicious, with half the time and mess.  Great recipe!

I was on for a Pumpkin dessert for Thanksgiving this year (2010) and I decided on a Pumpkin roll - I scoured the internet but always come back to Allrecipes - it's got the best of the web as far as I'm concerned and the best rating system.  Anyway, I made this with the following changes - I have half sheet cake pans - larger than what most folks have - so I changed the recipe to for the cake part to be larger by 1/3.  I also made 1 1/2 times the filling - only thing I added was I put about 2 tsp. Ginger Paste - in the filling for a little different flavor.  Even as is, this recipe is great!  Everyone loved it!   Thanks Angela!

I've always wanted to try a roll type cake and this was easy, quick and delicious.  I made use of other's suggestions.  I only had organic pumpkin pie filling on hand and it worked perfectly.  I also substituted half brown sugar for half of the white sugar.  Beautiful presentation!

I made this last night for the first time. It turned out WAY better than I expected. I omitted the lemon juice though. Didn't see how that would be necessary but I will try with next time to see if there is a difference.   TO ROLL  I lined a cookie sheet, sprayed with pam first, with parchment paper. I then sprayed the paper with pam. I spread the mix evenly and baked accordingly.  I took it out of the oven and placed a clean pillow case over the cake immediately. (I didn't have any towels that were a smooth) I then placed another cookie sheet atop the cake and flipped it over and slid out the cookie sheet. Then I rolled it up, let it sit for 20 minutes until I unrolled it and put the icing in the middle, and re-rolled without the towell. I froze it overnight in tinfoil, brought it to work and sliced it and EVERYONE loved it!!

This is simple to mix, but I found the devil in the details. The first batch I made was a disaster and fell apart when I rolled it up with the filling. I felt this was due to it not being baked long enough. I made a second one, and added 5 minutes to the bake time, and it came out fine.  It still seemed to me to be a rather delicate cake, so handle it gently and don't be afraid if you use more than 2 Tbs. of powdered sugar when you dust the towel.  Also, the first (disaster) time, I think my towel was too moist. The second time, I just sprinkled a bit of water on the towel with my fingers and it worked much better.

Absolutely wonderful! Made just as written and it came out perfect. I put waxed paper down on the sheet before pouring the roll mix (I do this by greasing the sheet first with crisco the put the wax paper over that to get the wax paper to stick to the sheet) and I didn't use a damp towel to invert the roll but used another wax paper sheet with powdered sugar....Will definitely make this again!

My friends have been holding out on me - who knew it could be this easy?! I lined the pans with wax paper as others have suggested and replaced the pumpkin spice with 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg, and a couple shakes of ground cloves. I also doubled the recipe since it seemed so simple. I was glad I did; they were gone in no time flat. Go ahead and try this - it's easier than you can imagine.

This cake is delicious.   However I have difficulty getting the right texture as it turned out to be very  moist and dense  like a sort of pudding.   It just couldn't be rolled as it breaks.  Can you tell what the ideal texture  should be like.

I don't usually type in a review for a recipe but I wanted everyone to know that this is probably the BEST pumpkin roll recipe. This is better than Libby's recipe. I have tried several and about 5 years ago, I tried this one. I have to make 3 or 4 every Thanksgiving because it flies out of the kitchen at my in-laws. As for any tips, I always line my pan with wax paper and spray with non-stick cooking spray. After it comes out of the oven, I flip it onto my towel and roll it up. Since I live in Michigan and it is usually cold in November, I put my rolls on the porch to cool off before I put in the filling.

Love it!! Everyone asks for the recipe...I always use a 11x15 cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and I roll it lengthwise. I couldn't imagine doing it any other way! Even a great summer time dessert because it's served cold......yummmmmmmmy!

This is my all time favorite recipe from this site!!!! Everyone who has ever tried this, raves about it.  The only bad thing about this dessert, is that it is very addicting.  I have made at least 100+ rolls.  Finally I wised up and bought two smaller pans, so one batch would make two rolls.  Great for gift giving!  You can also exchange the pumpkin for chocolate and add other flavors to the cream cheese.  Don't let the directions or appearance scare you off, this is actually very easy to make. This roll is best when allowed to settle in the fridge.

This recipe is very good!  To make it evern easier, instead of rolling the cake up, you can leave it in the pan and just frost it!  Very easy bar cakes!  You can leave then in the pan, or put them in festive cupcake wrappers!  There are technically more servings then.  Great for parties!

This is awesome!!  I have made this 3 times now and I learned the hard way that you really need to put down parchment paper on the pan before pouring the batter.  No sticking to the pan and makes it much easier to flip.  I made this twice last year, one because I wanted t see if I could do it correctly and one for Thanksgiving.  Just made it the third time and my family said "no pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving, just make another pumpkin roll"  Thank you for a great recipe.  No changes to the batter for me.  Perfect as is.

I have made a very similar pumpkin roll, howver, my recipe calls for: chopped walnuts to be liberally sprinkled over the cake batter before baking. When cake is done, it is turned out on a well powdered sugar 'dusted' tea towel to roll up (yes, it's a wee bit messy, but so worth it!) to cool. Instead of vanilla in the cream cheese filling, I used lemon extract- really gives the pumpkin roll a zip!!  Freezes nicely! I usually make 2 recipes at once, as what are you going to do with the rest of the canned pumpkin? Give other one as a gift.

Don't get my wrong, this is a fair to good pumpkin roll, but I've had better. It's simply bland. I found it lacked the spices/intensity I've tasted in other pumpkin rolls. I suggest 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of the 2 teaspoons the recipe calls for and some vanilla. As for the cream cheese filling, it would have tasted better with less butter and a tad more sugar. The amount of vanilla is perfect though. Lining the pan with wax paper did prevent the cake from sticking to the pan. Using the damp towel kept the cake from sticking to the towel. I did add walnuts and they helped bring another element.

This is the BEST dessert ever! If you love pumpkin pie then this is the new dessert for you! I had bought on of these rolls from a local woman selling them at a bazarr a few years ago and begged her for the recipe (which she would part with if her life depended on it). Thank God for Allrecipes.com! When I found this site and just by chance looked for this recipe last year and found it I was beyond thrilled. Me and my daughters made a batch for their local bakesale fundraiser at school and the were gone in 5 mins! Plus I had PTA members banging down my door for the recipe (now I know why that woman wouldnt give it away). I plan on making these as a PTA fund raiser next year and ALREADY have advace orders. Thanks SO much for posting this one :X

Sorry Granny, your pumpkin roll is delicious, but there is no way made the way described above will turn out looking like the photo.  I had to make several changes to this recipe but after three tries, I think I have it.  First off, do not make it in a 9x13 cake pan.  The cake portion of the roll will be too thick and will not be cooked after 15 minutes.  I used a 16x12x1 jelly roll pan which I think is the MINIMUM size you should use.

This is a fantastic recipe.  Tastes just like pumpkin rolls I grew up with!  The icing is just the right mix..not too sweet.  As far as preparing.  I bake it on nonstick aluminum foil and then just flip over and peel off!  I also roll it in the aluminum foil.  Helps keep the outside smooth and pretty!

This is the first time I've ever made a cake roll. I made this for a party at my daughters house last night, It was yummy! several people asked how I made it & thought it was delicious, But for the filling I used ready made Philidelphia cheesecake filling & on top I drizzled a caramel glaze made with butter, brown sugar,vanilla & cream. i would make this again!

I've made this every year since first discovering it on this site, and it's become a much-requested Thanksgiving dessert.  The only difference I make is I skip the lemon juice and I add a bit of pumpkin pie spice to the cream cheese filling.  I serve 2 slices with a homemade caramel sauce and it is great, and a beautiful presentation.

This is very simple - even for the beginners! Wrap in aluminum foil and freeze for up to 3 months.  What a handy, impressive dessert to have on hand when surprise guests drop in! Just take out of freezer 15 minutes before serving.

Awesome!  I thought this would be much more difficult than it was.  The only problem I had was....I've never done any type of "roll" cake so.....when it came time to roll, a bunch of my filling "squished" out the other side.  I'll have to work on that on the next one!  And YES....I will be making more!!!  Yummy!

For beautiful presentation, freeze the roll and then slice while still frozen.  This prevents the filling from getting squished and keeps the roll shape. I love this because you can make it ahead of time and slice what you need and put the rest back in the freezer for later! Only problem I had was keeping myself from returning to the freezer for another slice! This is a beautiful and gourmet looking dessert and absolutely delicious! I increased the cooling time to 30 minutes the second time I made it before spreading on the icing because the first time the cake was still too warm and the icing began to melt. I also lined the pan with greased and floured wax paper which made it very easy to remove from the pan. I LOVE this dessert for its impressive looks and moist delicious taste!!

this tastes great and doesn't require a mixer to make :)  try not to spread filling to edges - squeezes out when rolling:(  update:  i made this roll AND the libby's pumpkin roll recipe from allrecipes today just to see - the cake on this recipe tastes far better - and has a better consistency.  might as well make two at a time - a small can of pumpkin is almost 2 cups.

This tastes wonderful but I was a total failure at the rolling part. I think the cake was too thick. I will try to make it thinner next time. It is very important that the cake not be humped in the middle so you might have to try to level it a bit.

This is the only pumpkin roll on this site you should make. I have tried all the others and they aren't very good. I don't use lemon juice because I never have it. But I find it easier to roll it in the towel and put it in the fridge then I come back an hour or so later and add the cream I never have a problem rolling it since I already have it in that shape in the towel. You really need to make sure you grease the pan well so that the cake flips out.

This is absolutely fantastic and oh so simple to prepare!  I was a bit nervous about turning out and rolling the cake, but I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly.  I did find however that when I had finished the roll, I had enough pumpkin (I just used a small can of pumpkin puree) and enough of the cream cheese mixture leftover to make another roll.  I found the 9x13" pan size was perfect once I sliced the roll, so next time I'll stick with the 9x13" inch pan but double up on the batter and make two rolls instead of one.  Yummy!  Thanks so much for sharing your granny's great recipe!

SO GOOD!  I followed others' suggestions by using a larger pan, covering the bottom in wax paper, spraying with Pam and allowing the cake to cool for 5 minutes before turning it out onto the towel.  I didn't dampen my towel--just dusted it w/confectioners sugar-- and the cake rolled up perfectly...no cracks.  One hint for the icing: be sure the let the cream cheese really soften or else you'll have lumps.  This cake really makes a beautiful presentation and tastes great as well!

This is a great recipe. Start to finish was about 40 minutes. I did not use a 9x13 inch pan, mine measured 17x12. It tasted great and was enjoyed by all who tried it. I made about ten copies of the recipe to hand out. Thanks Angela!

This is the one and only recipe I will ever use for pumpkin roll. I make this exactly as written, and I make 30 or so every holiday. I have people requesting this months in advance, no joke. Give this recipe a try!

Love it! Love it!! LOVE IT!!! First time making it and it was so easy. I made a second one an hour later so I could share with friends as well since my Husband and kids always eat everything up. Only thing I did different was I used a can of 100% pure pumpkin since I couldn't find the puree and I added about a teaspoon of pumpkin spice to the cream cheese filling for an extra burst of pumpkin flavor! Also I didn't have a linen towel so I used a clean unused pillow case since the material is smooth. I put them in the fridge for about 4 hours before slicing; and this recipe came out so great I ended up eaten 4 slices in the space of 10 minutes and I don't feel one bit bad about it!!!

This didn't work out at all for me. Having said this, I don't consider myself a seasoned baker in the least.... My neighbor makes a yummy pumpkin roll, but hers is a bit denser than I'd like and is covered with nuts (which I also don't like). After seeing my neighbor crank several of these out one afternoon, I thought it MUST be easy and set out to make the perfect looking pumpkin roll myself. I can't even BEGIN to describe the problems I had. First attempt: Followed reviewer Valerie's directions. Cake cracked as soon as I started to roll it. Undefeated, I decided to try again. Second (and final) attempt: Followed Angela's directions TO THE LETTER. When rolling the second time (i.e out of towel), cake cracked. Decided to cut a piece for myself to see how it tasted. Didn't find this to be nearly as good as any of the pumpkin cakes I've had before. Neither time did my cake cook thru in 15 min. (more like 20 for me). And, even tho my roll cracked, I was able to keep rolling it... somewhat. Whether perfect or not, I could tell there was NO way this was going to look anything like the pics on here. The takeaways from my experience are: a) make your frosting FIRST and refrigerate it while your cake is baking / cooling, b) line your baking dish with greased parchment paper (makes flipping the cake  MUCH easier) & c) follow POOHBEC's instructions for wetting your towel. All in all, this was OK tasting, but the procedure needs a LOT of work on my end. Thanks anyways, Angela. :-)

I have made a similar recipes for years.  Use to make over 100 of them to give as christmas gifts.  
Suggestions:  spray cookie sheet with pam cover with wax paper.  Add cake.  When cake is done flip it out onto a t-towel that has been covered with sifted powered sugar.  Roll.  Place in refrig for at least one hour.  Unroll, add filling and roll up.  Shoud have no problem with them sticking!  Have fun!

This is super yummy and not a crumb left. The only change I made was with the flour, I used 1/2 cup wheat flour and 1/4 cup white flour. Only because I am trying to cook healtier for my family. My daughter who isn't a fan of wheat flour couldn't get enough of this flavorful cake!!!! 5 stars + for sure!!!!

The cake was a little spongy for me, but overall good flavor.  I did add 1/8 tsp of salt, as all cakes/cookies need it to balance the sweetness.

I used parchment paper, which made rolling the cake easy.   I didn't use all the filling, but more than half of it.  Added maple extract, along with a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg, to the filling.  Very sweet, but well received at work and at home.

this was such a great recipe! i did everything exactly as the recipe said! i used fat free cream cheese and it tasted great! i did have to cook the cake about 21 minutes total. Also, next time I am going to try baking it with the parchment paper on the bottom, im sure that would help alot!! thanks for the great recipe!!!!! its a keeper!!!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic! I have tried so many different ones because pumpkin roll is my favorite holiday dessert & none have come close to this. I only made a few modifications that didn't really affect the taste at all. I like to do my rolls in a larger sheet cake pan which makes me think that maybe the original recipe just had a misprint because the filling is perfect for the sheet cake  & since so many reviewers complained about there being too much, I assume it was really meant for the larger pan. I also sprinkled pecans over the filling before rolling it up. My trick for the perfect roll is to spray the pan w/ baker's secret spray & flip it onto a large tea towel that has been sprinkled w/ powdered sugar. While the cake is still warm you roll it into a log with the towels & let it sit for a few minutes, this helps it to roll nicely w/o cracking. Once it has cooled a bit you unroll it & spread on the filling. Roll back up, wrap in plastic wrap & chill int the fridge until serving time. PERFECT every time!

okay, this was way more simple than i thought it would be.. and way more delicious! i followed the directions exactly except for using a larger jelly roll pan. the cream cheese mixture is to die for! don't change ANYTHING except for the pan size.

I have been craving a pumpkin roll, and this really hit the spot.  This recipe is fabulous, and unless you care to adjust for taste, you really don't need to change a thing.  New cooks can find a variety of proportions of spice to make their own Pumpkin Spice...There are even several here on All Recipes.  There are a few keys to getting this to turn out right: - A thinner cake layer is much easier to work with.  I used a 13x15 baking tray. - Use parchment paper.  If you haven't discovered the joys of baking with parchment, you don't know how hard you've been making your life. - Cooking spray or shortening is really necessary to spray on the parchment or baking pan.  When you are working with something so thin, one little crack could spell disaster. - Use the moist linen towel!!  Not only does it prevent your cake from cracking, but it helps the cake stay moist as it cools.  Kudos for a wonderful recipe, and happy cooking!

So good, and surprisingly easy.  Sent this in to my husband's office around Halloween and everyone loved it!  I made the recipe as written, though I did line the pan with wax paper, as others have suggested.  I also chilled the roll in the fridge overnight before slicing with serrated knife so it didn't squish out of shape.

I made this for a Christmas party and it was a huge hit!   To help keep the shape of the roll while slicing, use this dental floss tip instead of a knife. Place a long piece of dental floss under dough 3/4 inch from end of roll. Cross ends of floss over top of roll; slowly pull ends to cut through dough. Repeat until entire roll has been cut.

Fantastic recipe, its the best pumpkin roll recipe I have tried yet, my roommates always ask for them. I highly recommend lining the pan with parchment paper, as one of my cakes wouldn't come out of the pan right and was a disaster (with parchment paper you can just lift it out). I also had a problem with my first cakes cracking. I fixed this by flipping the cake onto some parchment paper sprinkled in confectioner sugar right out of the oven (honestly the sugar is not necessary as my caked were so moist they just absorbed it and I had to cover then again anyways), then I took some paper towels (two of the choose a size ones) and bunched them horizontally and put them at the end and rolled it so the paper towels would be in the middle. I had no problem with either of my cakes cracking when I rolled them this way.

The first time I tried this recipe it was too thick also.  I tried using an 11x17 pan and that made it perfect thickness and the extra filling that I had before fit the bigger sized pan just right.  I also had a problem with sticking to the pan but I used cooking spray for baking and then floured the pan too.  If you let it cool in the pan for 5 minutes before you take it out it won't break apart.  Every time I make this recipe now I get rave reviews and sometimes I also add chopped walnuts to the cream cheese filling.  I get requests to make this now quite frequently for any function that needs to bring a dessert dish to pass.  Good luck to all in your pumpkin roll baking.

I loved the recipe, I just had problems with the cream cheese melting, 20 minutes was NOT enough to cool down the cake.  Fortunately, I checked You Tube and watched a demo and her directions were so much clearer.  I used this recipe and You Tube's directions and my second, third and fourth tries were successful. I made it to take to dinners and everyone loved it. My daughter ate a whole roll herself while home over the Christmas Holiday.

Very nice pumpkin roll, I used Creamy Frosting for the filling as my son does not like cream cheese frosting, easy way to use up leftover pumpkin from Thanksgiving.

I've been making this for many years.  The reason for a 4 star and not a 5 star is because of the directions.  I line my 10 x 13" pan (I got mine at the dollar store) with wax paper.  Don't worry, it won't burn.  After baking, turn cake over on a towel liberally dusted with powdered sugar and then peel wax paper off, roll in a towel tightly starting on the SHORT SIDE (you get more swirls that way) and allow to cool before spreading with cream cheese frosting.  Also, I add chopped walnuts to the top of the cake before baking.

I used fresh pumpkin and instead of pre-made pumpkin spice, I used about 2 tbl cinnamon, 2 tsp fresh ground nutmeg and 1 tsp ground allspice...VERY good recipe!

I've always found rolled cakes to be a little intimidating, but this recipe couldn't have been easier! I followed the recipe carefully, and didn't have any problems.

Ever since the beginning of October, when I found this recipe and tried it, I made these rolls at least 6-7 times (and it's not even Christmas yet!). It is absolutely perfect, in every way! Our family and friends loved it! I followed the recipe to a T and never had any issues with it! To prevent the oozing out cream problem, I stick it in the fridge for a good amount of time before putting in on the roll and I avoid spreading it all the way to the edge. It still comes out a bit, but in manageable quantities, most of it staying in and looking and tasting awesomely!

This ia my first time making a roll cake, it was a huge hit at work. The only thing I did differently was to add pecans on top of the cream cheese frosting before rolling it up. Very tasty. I will make this again and again!

I have made this for many people and everyone has loved it.  I also added nutmeg and cinnamon (about a teaspoon of each).  I did not use the nuts but everything else I followed exactly and it always turns out amazing.  I put the wax paper on the cookie sheet with powdered sugar and poured the mix directly on and baked like this.  It makes it much easier to roll after it is baked.  I did not use a towel just the wax paper and it works perfectly.

Turned out wonderfully.  I don't see where people thought the directions were confusing - unless your a beginning cook - they are quite understandable to me.  I use cheesecloth sprinkled with confectioner's sugar always when rolling, it works perfectly.

At work I made this recipe, was a great hit, employee wanted this recipe. I used regular pumpkin pie filling, still used the pumpkin spice seasoning, I didn't damp the towel, was a extra step that wasn't needed. 10 servings for this recipe, I used 40 servings for work.

the BEST!! Turns out great everytime. A tip I do use though is to use Parchment Paper..this will prevent the roll from cracking when rolling.

This recipe is Amazing! Even my husband who claimed to hate anything pumpkin LOVED this dish! I recommend putting wax paper down on the pan when baking for easy cleanup and removal. Don't be afraid to make mulitple batches at once, it is really easy to do and it is fun to have one in the freezer for later.

This was soooo good.  My hubby who hasnt ever tried a pumpkin roll loved it, and my brother who is picky tried it and LOVED it also.  The flavor was full but not harsh.  Some pumpkin recipes can be harsh or bitter tasting due to all the spices used.  The filling is FAB and creamy and so good.  It tasted so good firly warm and fresh and again 2-3 days in the fridge sliced cold.  Yummm-E!!  Oh, and so easy to make, although if your like me and breeze right through the recipe, you realize later that the powdered sugar you put in the cake batter was supposed to be used for dusting the roll and kitchen towel.  Wish the 2 ingredient lists would have been seperated.

Great Recipe! I spray my pans with cooking spray then line it with wax paper (some might not like wax paper) and put my batter in. When I pull the cake out of the oven, it is much easier to remove seemlessly! Less cracks if you let it cool for a full 20 minutes and kind of press it as you are unrolling!
I was requested to bring something to a retreat one year, and brought one of these. It was gone the first night, had to go home the next day and make two more to bring back! Great reviews!

This is a real "WOW" dessert!  I also have substituted smashed bananas in place of the pumpkin, equal amounts, and omit the pumpkin pie spice.  I also add chopped nuts to the batter and then once it's cooled I fill with a butterscotch cream cheese filling.  I use my Pampered Chef Deluxe Cheese Grater and just grate butterscotch chips right into the cream cheese mixture and blend.  It looks very pretty!  In addition to another "WOW" presentation it's a great way to use up your over ripe bananas  :)

i used fresh pumpkin for this and the roll came out very sticky. also, the roll was almost too spongy in its consistency. i would have given it five starts, but these things bothered me too much. i might have to alter the recipe a little since i use fresh and not canned pumpkin. i'll alter it a bit and then rate the recipe again.

Very Good! If you like pumpkin and cream cheese this is the right thing for you. Next time I have to put a little more sugar on the towel when I roll it. Had a bit of cake stick to the towel. Otherwise, It was very delicious.

Love this easy recipe.  I like that the cake has no added oil and that it mixes together and bakes so quickly.  I have made this many times, but today found I had used all of my powdered sugar and didn't have any to sprinkle on the towel for the baked cake.  I used brown sugar and like it even more!  It sparkles and the flavor works well with the cake.  Give it a try.

Wow...what a crowd pleaser! My kids both couldn't stop raving about this!  I was nervous making it, but it turned out good, and it was much easier than I thought!  I put wax paper on the bottom of a large cookie sheet (like 12x17 or so). Let the cake cool about 5 mins before flipping it onto another wax paper that I had dusted with confectioners sugar.  Rolled it up with the wax paper (no towel).  It turned out so pretty!  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

So far I have made the cake and rolled it (I was worried since this was my first time doing this) It rolled perfectly.... I used waxed paper under it while baking, then sprinkled the top of the cake with powder sugar layed wax paper on the top with a cooling rack and fliped the pan, it came out wonderfully! Can't wait to taste the finished product, I am sure it will be great (I already tasted the filling and a tiny piece of the cake, they both taste amazing :D)  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!!

Great recipe. Cake is very moist, cream cheese filling is fantastic! I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin filling, as well as 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I also didn't use a towel, just baked it with a greased parchment paper underneath, and then put another parchment paper with cooking spray and powdered sugar to roll it up. Worked fairly well, except there were a few cracks...I would also make sure the cream cheese filling isn't too soft or it squirts out of the roll. And I'd probably halve the filling as well. Otherwise, great recipe!

I only do recipes that are at least 4 stars with at least 50 reviews, so I chose this one for Thanksgiving.This cake was slightly soggy. Nonetheless, it was quite simple to make (I followed everybody's recommendations, including the parchment paper and everything), but in the end, all that really matters about a dessert is its taste, and this one's is terrible, from the flavor right down to the texture.
The only reason why I give it an extra star is because of the frosting. Pretty tasty, but there were tons left over.

While my pumpkin roll did not turn out exactly like the picture, it was still delicious. I used 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. each ginger and nutmeg, and 1/8 tsp. cloves instead of the pumpkin pie spice. I used a 10x15 jelly roll pan. To prevent the cake from sticking, I lined the pan with parchment paper and sprayed everything with pam. The pumpkin roll may have browned a bit too quickly because I used a nonstick pan, so I'll decrease the temperature to 350 degrees next time. I filled it with whipped cream cheese frosting from this website- delicious! The roll did take a very long time to cool (2+ hours), so when I filled it, it was still a slightly warm. The filling did become a bit runny, but still held the roll in its shape. Make sure you refrigerate the filling before rolling it up!

I've been making this for years and it was not mentioned that IT FREEZES SEVERAL WEEKS JUST GREAT.  You can make it ahead for the holidays.  Also, the comment ".....  now here is the important part; Roll it and let it cool in the rolled shape that way when you un roll it to fill it later it will naturaly want to roll rather then having to force it. and yes i always get the messy wonky ends that dont look nice. all you do is take a sharp knife and slice off the ends to get that pretty shape and you get to taste test the ends." ... is very true.

I made this just as the recipe suggested and it turned out wonderfully!  I did not use a wet towel as all I could think about was germs so I sprayed a piece of aluminum foil with butter flavored cooking spray, baked it, then sprayed another piece of foil and put the powdered sugar on it when it was time and rolled it.  It unrolled perfectly and never stuck and the whole thing was gone that night!  I will definitely be making this again!!

This recipe was great!!  I made 3 of these for Christmas and I was surprised at how easy they actually were to put together.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe..perfect as is.  The only thing I would suggest, is to wait a little longer for the cake to cool before you add the frosting.  20 minutes wasn't quite enough, the cake was still a little too warm...I probably waited a good 40 minutes.  Also, try adding a tsp. of cinnamon to the frosting...YUM YUM YUM :~)

Hm...followed the recipe exactly but the roll came out dense and not soft at all.  Must've done something wrong.  The flavor was great though.

Serve this to others until it is completely gone, or run the risk of eating the whole thing by yourself.  This cake is AMAZING, and too tempting a treat to just have sitting around.  My one alteration, which I think made it even better.  I added almond extract to the frosting along with the vanilla.  Wow!  Wow...it's good!

This is very similar to Libbys Pumpkin Roll, almost exact. Cool the cake until you touch it and it is cool, no 20 minutes is not enough for all of you who had runny filling. Try Libby's recipe and you don't need to spend the $5 on pumpkin spice that I did today!  It is one of the best desserts going, my sons favorite! Also, use greased and floured wax paper over the already greased and waxed pan and it comes right off out of the oven!

Amazing! I would probably consider myself a beginner baker and I have no experience with something like this and it turned out beautifully! It was so delicious and it made me very popular! I followed the directions exactly and made no changes. I would definitely suggest being very generous with the powdered sugar on your damp towel. I will make this again and again! Thanks for the awesome recipe.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars it was that good!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used a 11x17 cookie sheet.  I also wrapped the roll in wax paper instead of the towel and it still worked great!  I took this to a potluck and it disappeared in 10 minutes.  Everyone asked for the recipe.

Delicious. Using others' advice, I cooked it on parchment paper in a 9x13 coolie sheet. I used a towel to roll it straight out of the oven and that worked fine. Once the cream filling was made, I did keep it in the fridge because the roll is still very warm 20 minutes later when you go to fill it. After I rerolled w/icing inside, I placed it in the freezer for about 20 minutes and then served it. It was not completely set yet but absolutely delicious. Looking forward to eating the other half tonight.

I followed the recipe exactly except couldn't find canned pumpkin. Used canned pumpkin pie mix, cut sugar by half (used splenda) and lighted up on the spices. I used a baking pan and the batter didn't quite cover the pan. Worked out anyway.

No towel needed!! You don't need to use a towle at all. just use a wax paper. bake it   then take the cake out from the pan.and let it cool for a while. for 15~20 minuts. then spread the icing. i didn't even put the icing in the refirgerater like others sugestions. because it is easy to spread it when it is soft. Peel the wax paper as you roll the cake. then put it in the refirageratr till you serve it. just cut the cake in slices before serving. it is so easy.

Really great pumpkin roll.  If the roll is still too warm it will start to melt the filling.  I will let mine cool a bit longer next time.

This was so good. I was surprised at how easy it really was and the taste was fabulous. It is tasty served cold with a hot cup of coffee. I did learn the hard way not to rush it...let it cool completely before filling. I tried the waxed papaer on the towel like suggested and it seemed to cause a bit of moisture from the heat against the towel. Next time I will only ise the dusted towel. Great recipe, thanks.

I LOVE this! Very well written recipe I found the instructions very easy to understand. The first time I made it I couldn't find a linen towel so I rolled it up with a terry cloth towel which didnt work so great and some of the cake stuck to it. But with a linen towel it works perfectly. Line your pan with parchment paper. Once it comes out of the oven its not necessary to let it cool for more than a minute or two before you lay it on the towel and roll it up again. An offset spatula is really helpful for getting the filling spread evenly, so it looks nice when you slice it.

This was pretty good.  My only complaint would be that the cake part was a little bland. Maybe a bit more spice would liven it up.  If you are going to use parchment to cook the cake, don't forget to spray it.  I found that 12 minutes in the oven sufficed.  I had a little trouble with the cake sticking to the towel but thankfully my cake did not break.  The filling is awesome.  Make sure not to spread it all the way to the ends or else you'll get oozing.

I'm a little confused at times on how some of the recipes on this site get RAVE reviews and 5 stars, when they are just mediocre. This recipe was good, but not spectacular. Plus, it's just about the same as the Libby's recipe on the back of their cans of pumpkin. Cake was a bit plain and dense for me, filling was good but sweet. Just your basic cream cheese frosting recipe. Word of advice: DON'T use a damp towel to roll this, use either wax paper or stick free foil. The cake is really moist and will stick  and pull apart on the damp towel. Then you will be left with a mess.

I have been making this recipe for 4 years now and it has become a tradition around the holidays everybodys favorite request is this roll, so instead of christmas presents I bake smaller rolls for everyone to take home at the end of the night, cant go wrong with it...i did have a few mishaps at the very beginning but like other reviewers i learned from the mistakes now i use parchment paper instead of the towel and i put the icing in the fridge while the cake cools. Thanks a lot for a great recipe

Oh MY!!!! I have been making this for 2 yrs and my family said 1 is not enough for Thanksgiving... I now make 2 and they get gobbled up everytime! I use 1 cup pumpkin pie filling + 1 tsp cinnamon and omit the spice. I also add 2 tbsp orange juice to the filling- you wouldn't believe the difference in flavor this makes. So light, it is the PERFECT dessert after a Thanksgiving feast! Thanks Angela!

I baked this at 350 in a 11X15 for 15mins.  this was a huge hit in our house, I notice that most of all the pumpkin roll recipes are basically this recipe.  this recipe is versatile enough to substitute banana as well....

Wow, this was great with a few modifications...I used a cookie sheet with edges (BE SURE too because the batter is runny like a reg cake and if your cookie sheet doesnt have elevated edges of course your batter will not be held up by anything)... I used the advice of another reviewer and lined the pan with parchment paper..when I took it out of the over i let it cool for 15-20 minutes the flipped the cake onto another sheet of parchment paper with powdered sugar sprinkled on it, then peeled off the parchment paper.. had no problems with sticking. I spread the cream cheese icing on and sprinkled crushed walnuts on top! Had no problems with cracking when I rolled it. Perfect recipe to make at this time of year! My boyfriend and his friends all loved it!

This recipe was absolutely beautiful. It looked great on a buffet I had for a party, but I thought the flavor needed something more. I made double batch, one on a slightly larger pan than called for and one slightly smaller.  The larger pan definitely made a more beautiful finished product, as it rolls more times around.  Next time I will chill the frosting interior for about 15 mins so it will still be soft but firm enough to stay put while rolling up - it was a messy experience!

Huge hit with my family. Took 1 to the family weekend holiday get together and it was consumed the first night so they asked me to make 2 more!! First time rolling I didn't do a get job, but once I got the hang of it they looked beautiful.

Seriously, this stuff is great, but don't know what I'm doing wrong.  I'm just not coordinated enough to flip the cake and get it on the towel correctly.  First time, the wax paper ripped and I flopped it down on the counter....it broke.  Second attempt was a little better, but still not perfect since the cake comes right off of the wax paper without allowing sufficient time to aim for the towel.  I just can't get it to flip and roll without breaking it.  Did anyone else struggle with it being REALLY moist, too?  Overall, this has a great taste, though.  I ended up making a third but put it in a smaller glass dish, decreased the oven temp and increased the time to make a cake/bar dessert.  Tastes great either way, but this was MUCH easier. :)

I made this as a dessert for our Halloween feast, and served it room temperature with a bourbon praline sauce on the side. Evey single person loved it. I am really happy with this recipe and will add it to the family cook book. By the way, dusting it ith powdered sugar before cutting it makes gives a nice touch.

Snaps for Angela! This was wonderful. I thought it would be hard to do and it wasn't. I added cinnamon and fresh ground nutmeg to the batter. After I frosted it I added 3/4 of a cup of finely chopped walnuts. I made sure it was totally cool before frosting it and nothing leaked out. I used parchment paper to line the pan, I think it made it easier to flip. It looks so pretty when sliced, a definite keeper!!!

This is a very easy recipe to make and follow. I did use parchment paper in my pan to make it come out better. I have made this recipe many times at work and for family. It freezes very well and is handy to have for when you need something to take to family gatherings. They will think you spent all day making it.

We just love this recipe for the holidays. I use a 12x17 inch sheet pan and the thickness was perfect. Maybe those with smaller pans use less and make more than one cake... I prefer to put frosting on the outside... A very nice recipe.... thank you for sharing it with us.

I love this recipe! 
I am planning a Halloween party and wanted to try this out before I made it for others - well, it turned out great! If you are considering the same thing, there is no need for a test run! 
I do warn that you give a test run to things that have not been rated yet though, I made that mistake before, but this recipe has nothing but rave reviews - trust them!

So good!!! Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect!  My only suggestion, while rolling, is to sprinkle on a lot of powdered sugar onto your tea towel when rolling. I liken it to the same method as if you were flouring your surface well before kneading dough. Dust your tea towel with powdered sugar, and use your hands to spread it out on the towel, creating a light layer. Don't skimp this part. If you only use a little bit, I guarantee you'll be having cake stick to the towel and your end result won't turn out. The layer of powdered sugar helps as a barrier so that cake doesn't stick to the towel, and you'll see as the rolled up warm cake 'rests', heat will escape from the towel, also melting the sugar into the cake surface. When you unroll the cake, the powdered sugar will have added an extra thin layer of sweetness. I also refrigerated the filling first before spreading onto the cake, and that eliminated the gooey mess that spills out from the sides when rolling. Otherwise the filling would be too soft. Great for freezing, and thaws out really well. To store in the freezer, wrap tightly in plastic wrap or parchment, then wrap in foil. Will taste fresh even when thawed. I made several of these for parties over the holidays. I brought one out after a month in the freezer, and after thawing it tasted just as fresh as the day I made it. When slicing it up to serve or present on a platter, clean your knife after each slice so that you get nice, clean cuts.

I love this recipe. They are really great frozen ahead of time, just pop them in the fridge from the freezer before serving. I make several every year around thanksgiving and freeze a few for Christmas.

This was (mostly) surprisingly easy. I rolled the cake in parchment because I didn't have a towel that I wasn't afraid would leave lint. I feel like a towel would have helped with the cooling more because there was some sweat under the parchment. The sweat caused the cake the stick to the parchment so once I added the filling, it became a two person job trying to re-roll it. I think graham cracker crumbs, pecans, walnuts, or anything that goes well with pumpkin would be a great addition to the filling. It's an incredibly rich dessert so raw nuts might help mellow that out slightly. And if you're concerned about the edges and the icing oozing out, just cut the edges off before you serve it and secretly enjoy those slices for yourself!

I thought making the cake and icing was easy. But the cake ripped when I put it on the towel and it was hard to roll up.  The cake was also very heavy and moist.  Overall it tasted  good and everyone was impressed.

No problems whatsoever with this recipe. Only advice is that make sure the towel is not too damp and use more than 2T of powdered sugar on it. I have made this several times and each time a hit.  Everyone asks for the recipe.

I thought this recipe was phenomenal!  I have done it twice for other people other than myself and they came back to me with nothing but positive reviews.  Something I would recommend is to watch the video that goes with the recipe.  It is much clearer on the steps on how to dampen the cloth and it is just so much clearer.

This was a hit!  I made it exactly as stated.  I made two and the first one came out perfect and the 2nd ripped.  I just Saran wrapped both of them the best I could and 2 days later when I went to cut them the broken one looked fine cause it all held together.  Very good recipe. :)

my entire family loves this recipe. My husband who is not a huge fan of pumpkin loves this too. The only suggestion i have when making this is that if you have never rolled a cake before try using the wax paper instead of the towel, it makes it SO MUCH easier and you have less breakage.

This pumpkin roll was outstanding! I made it for a bunco get together last week, and now it will be on my Thanksgiving table for sure!  If you follow the directions, it rolls beautifully!

Incredible!! My husband loves pumpkin roll, it's his favorite dessert.  This is the third recipe I've tried, and it's his favorite one, the search is over.  For pers. prefer. I change the amount of pumpkin pie spice from 2 tsp. to  1 1/2 tsp., but follow everything else exactly. It really is easy to make, just make sure the roll is completely cool before adding the filling. To save a step,  I just use a dry linen tea towel, but add plenty of sifted conf. sugar to it (generously covered). Thanks so much Granny Kat!

I have been making this for some 20 years....always a hit.  Takes a bit of practice, but if your first try is not perfect, don't give up -- the recipe is great, the technique might take a time or two to perfect!  The reviewers' hints about wax paper, rolling in a thin tea towel (my fav); all are what makes the finished product worth the effort.  Taste and "walahh!" effect are great!

Great recipe.  One tip--my mother taught me to make the towel a little damp before starting the pumpkin roll.  Not wet, just a little damp.  Helps to really keep the pumpkin roll moist.

Such a great recipe! WARNING: you must use parchment paper or the bread will stick to the pan, also use a damp towel to roll the bread first while cooling, don't jump the gun and unwrap it before its full cooled or the bread will crack. GREAT RECIPE!!

The pumpkin roll part was very moist and a little too sticky and next time I will sweeten the cream cheese filling a little more - but overall this was super yummy and I will make it again.

The only thing I did differently was bake on parchment paper and put parchment paper over the top before rolled it up in the towel. It was my first time making it and it was very easy! My cake did split a tiny bit, but I think its because I spread the batter unevenly.

I have to say when I was reading the direction I though it was going to be hard, plus I am still a beginner but I had no problems it was easy. I did Not have parchment paper like another reviewer suggested, so I used wax paper, took a butter stick and started to cover it with butter and it came out fine. I follow direction to a the T and it looks good and taste good.

I have made this 2x, both times with gluten-free all purpose flour substitute. The first time I used the damp towel method to roll and it came out well - no cracking. The second time I tried parchment and it was a disaster - one major crack all the way down, the powdered sugar clumped in an ugly way around parts of the cake and it still stuck to the paper. I do think the filling is a bit plain and needs vanilla and spices to taste as others have suggested.

If I make it again, I will add something to the icing - maybe finely chopped nuts or ginger, but other than that, it was FANTASTIC, and is easier to make than it looks.

Followed as stated.  Used parchment paper to help with taking out of pan.    I liked the flavors, however, the texture seemed a little rubbery or something...

I followed the directions exactly. I had no problems at all...it was very easy to make & it tastes amazing. It's just a little too moist...and kind of wet looking. I was hoping it was a bit more cake like.

YUMMY! I had some difficulty getting the cake off of the baking sheet and all rolled up, lost half of it so I just did the other half as the roll...tasted so good though! I'm excited to try again to perfect my technique but I would change nothing with the taste.

I've never been a huge pumpkin fan, but this recipe changed that!  I made this for my Bible Study and though there were only 8 of us, I had barely any left.  My mom finished the rest which is shocking in itself since she usually has self-control with desserts.  I thought because I am fairly new at cooking in general I might make a mess of this dessert, but it came out beautiful and tasted even better.  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't need to alter anything. I will be making this again for Thanksgiving.

I use a similar recipe and have been making pumpkin rolls for quite a few years now.  I add 1/2 tsp of each to my cake (cinnamon and cloves).  I like these additional flavors in my cake.  Also someone earlier commented on the instructions using a cake pan?? the instructions do mention a jelly roll pan, but I have always used a standard size cookie sheet and it works perfectly.  (I use the recipe on the back of Libby's Pure Pumpkin can and always get rave reviews)

WOW!  WE ABSOLUTELY LOVE this recipe!  Friends and family loved it as well!  I added the remainder of the canned pumpkin to the cream cheese icing and it gave it an extra pumpkin flavor.  I highly recommend the adding the left over pumpkin which is about 1/2 cup to the icing, it is the best!  This was so quick, easy and fun to make!

Made it just like the recipe!!! Came out great the first time! Don't need to change a thing. I think my husband had 3rd's :) :) :)  I didn't have parchment paper to line my pan with so I spread butter on the 12 x 17" pan and floured it. Came out like a charm! :)

This was a huge disappointment. I should have been suspicious when I saw how little flour was needed. The roll, I won't even call it a cake, was very spongy and dense. It was like eating pumpkin fudge instead of cake.

The filling was great, but the cake had the texture of a wet sponge. Let down.

We thought this was a spectacular recipe! Used it for a pot luck and it was an absolute hit. When I made it, we added extra nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger to the batter to give it an extra seasonal punch. We also added walnuts and crasins to the frosting to add a personal and festive touch. Simply delicious and very easy to make. Next time though, we'll use a bigger cookie sheet and line it with wax paper.

Very easy to make, taste great! I found it easier to put wax paper between the cake and the towel. This eliminated any 'fuzz/lint' sticking. No cracking!  Also, it helps if the icing is firmer. Make the icing before baking the cake and allow it to chill. This helps the icing stay during rolling.

This recipe is delicious! I didn't find I had too much icing, but I followed the advice in the other postings and chilled the frosting while the cake baked and cooled. I had a little bit of cracking when I made the final roll, but this may be because I didn't make the towel damp enough before rolling in the first place. It didn't rip straight through, and the final product was amazingly tasty. I used the recipe exactly except that I baked it on parchment paper and chilled the frosting. Everyone loves this.

I had no problem making this even though I was worried it wouldn't roll. This is one of my mot requested recipes, and most importantly one of my husband's favorites. I usually just use the whole can of pumpkin and it still works! Props to Granny Kat for this recipe!

Very good, very easy. I have never made a roll before and followed the directions to a T and all went great. The cake itself didn't taste very pumpkiny though. Next time I will use the cake recipe I have for my pumpkin whoopie pies as that is much more flavorful.

Taste was great, presentation didn't work for me.  I followed the directions exactly and the cake wasn't round, more a saggy oval shape.  Very yummy but not presentation worthy like the pic. Will try again some day...

I have used this recipe for several years! It always turns out perfect!! I get so many compliments on it and it has become a tradition of my sister & I to make around 30 every October and give to friends and neighbors! I used fresh pumpkin this year and it was even more amazing. Pie pumpkins are very cheap this time of the year and when making these in bulk it seemed more reasonable. It was just as easy and I cup of fresh pumpkin replaced the canned pumpkin. I will never go back to canned pumpkin!! For the lady that said the filling was to runny, it will be when you first spread it. Once you roll it again and refrigerate the filling will become more solid and be perfect. The key is to not ice the edges and don't roll it to tightly. It will cause the overflow. I watched the video this year for the first time and if is your first time making this highly suggest it. It gave you a lot of good ripe so your roll will turn out perfect!

I end up being requested to make this a lot.  It's really not as hard or as complicated as it might seem. I do think it helps to do as others suggest and freeze the filling in the freezer while the roll cools. It keeps it from falling all over.

I wanted to make a pumpkin roll for my boyfriend - his all time favorite desert. I did make some changes - that is why the 4 stars.  I added vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg! WOW was it good! I was worried about how this would turn out. I made the first one and it cracked.  I put the filling in right away while it was still warm - not a good idea. For the second one I let the bread cool (while the filling was in the fridge).  Once it was cool I filled it with the filling and my boyfriend has already eaten both of them - its been 3 days! Very Good

So good.  I used a Splenda blend & it was still delicious.  Mine tasted good, but it didn't look pretty.  I didn't roll it length-wise, so it was a short fat roll.  Whoops.  Make sure you roll it immediately out of the oven.  I didn't, so it ended up cracking.

My first time making pumpkin rolls and they came out great. I used parchment paper on my pans and then the towel covered with confectioners sugar to roll them. They were very moist and delicious. I didn't have a problem with too much filling at all, but we love cream cheese, so it just may be a personal preference.

WOW!  Didn't change a thing and it was perfect.  Just a tip, I lined my baking pan with parchment paper and sprayed the sides with non-stick cooking spray...chilled the cream cheese mixture before spreading it onto the roll so it wouldn't ooze out the sides.

Wow!  Simply delicious.  I'd never made a pumpkin roll before and this had the highest rating so I just went for it.  I followed the recipe, but did add a bit more cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg.  After baking in an 11x15 pan (lined with parchment and smeared butter on edges of pan), I let it rest for 30-40 min.  I sprinkled powder sugar on another piece of parchment to coat it and then laid it onto the top of pumpkin bread.  Then, using a rack, flipped it over, and it was super easy at that point.  I froze it overnight and thawed it out before serving.  It was delicious and even better two days later!  Yum!

Not as hard as it would appear! I was looking to use up some pumpkin pie spice and that is why I chose this recipe.  I pretty much followed the recipe except for a couple of minor things, one I used an 11 x 15 pan lined with parchment paper; be sure to spread the batter pretty evenly, it does not rise like a cake from a box it comes out pretty much like it goes in.  Two, I sprinkled the powdered sugar directly on the cake and put the damp towel over it and flipped it out; rolled it up as stated to cool, spread the filling on, added chopped walnuts to half the filling and rolled it up.  The final rolling was my only hang up and at first it was because I was trying to roll it too tightly, just lift the towel and let it roll like that, it is perfect.  I too wrapped in plastic wrap and then in foil to refrigerate.  This really was very easy and quick as well.

I made the mistake of using cake flour instad of all purpose and I also should have rolled it when the recipe said to instead of waiting 30-40 minute that other reviewers had recommended.  I did use parchment paper and it worked wonderfully!  The filling was also AWESOME!!  I may try this again, but follow the directions exactly, but overall, wasn't entirely impressed, but I think it was my fault so that is why I gave it 4 stars

I have now made this at least a dozen times and it is perfect every single time!  I do add about 1.5 extra teaspoons of cinnamon because we love it, but otherwise follow the recipe exactly.  It was also the first roll I've ever made and even my first one turned out beautifully!  I line my pan with wax paper to bake, then I use another piece of greased wax paper on the top when I roll it up.  Makes it so easy!  Thanks!

For those who have noted that the filling is too runny:  don't overbeat the filling.  Make sure the cream cheese and butter are soft (room temperature) before you start and then when you combine the ingredients, just gently mix them until blended.  Don't beat it at high speed.  Cream cheese gets softer and softer the more you beat it.

So moist and creamy filling is the perfect touch.  After I frosted and rolled, I wrapped in plastic wrap, then with aluminum foil as suggested.  I placed in the freezer for about an hour, then sliced right before serving.  Big hit! My husband even liked it, which is a big plus for this recipe.  Will make again for sure.  This is definitely on our Thanksgiving menu. I was very impressed with presentation...especially since this is my first attempt at a rolled dessert.  Thanks!

This is the 2nd pumpkin roll recipe that I've tried. I added a 1/4 teaspoon of salt and cloves to give it a bit more spice. 

I definitely would recommend using parchment paper. It peels right off once you've flipped it onto the towel.

This roll didn't rise as much as the other recipe I used. I'm not sure if one calls for baking powder and the other baking soda or what. They both tasted similarly delicious. This one was a little smaller and more dense though.

This is the first thing I have ever baked from scratch. just a few things take your time it bakes real quick and if theres a little hump its not a big deal.When I unrolled it from the towel I paniced because i didnt place the towel on the upper edge from where i began to roll it up so it cracked . I figured i would still give it a try rolled it up real tight mabye to tight shoved it in the freezer for 40 min just in case put it in the fridge and 6 hours later served it to my wife and it was perfect.

I made this last year for my BF's family's Thanksgiving dinner.  I was asked to bring it this year for both Thanksgiving and Christmas.  People are actually disappointed when I make this pumpkin roll and they can't attend the party.

I will make this again and again!  Easy to make, and tastes better than the store-bought ones (and at half the cost).  The only change I made was using only 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract, because the first time I made it, I thought the vanilla flavor was too strong.

even after reading the reviews, I was still suprised at how easy it was.  I have never made a roll-up before and I had no problems with this one.  I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted egg beaters for the eggs.  I made my icing first and refrigerated it while making, baking and cooling the roll-up.  I was looking for a dessert to take for thanksgiving and I believe I will take this one.

This is an excellent recipe. I find that the longer it stays refridgerated the more the pumpkin flavor comes out. Good luck getting it to last, though!

This made one delicious pumpkin roll.  I was surprised at how easy it was to make.  A friend of mine suggested using parchment paper (NOT WAXED PAPER) rather than the damp towel to roll the cake.  I will try it next time.  I used a 10.5 x 15 inch cookie sheet and the thickness was just right.  I cut the finished rolls in half before wrapping them.  I sold them for $5 each at a craft fair and sold out within the first half-hour.  The customer who bought four thought they were the perfect size for gifting.

Excellent recipe!  I served it at a large gathering and everyone asked for the recipe!  The filling is somewhat buttery; however, it was very smooth and sweet.  I followed the directions exactly, and I didn't have any trouble.  Thanks!

I have made this recipe many times.   I have also made this as mini muffins and piped the filling inside the muffins with a bismark piping tip, however icing them with the filling would also work. Great Recipe!

Forget the flour, use wax paper in the jelly roll pan. I doubled it and made two. The first one broke and cracked with damp towel but the husband ate the entire cracked roll and still said it was great. Will keep in my recipe box forever.

I gave it 5 stars; cause it is so good; way to easy to make; and quick.  This was the first time I ever made a pumpkin roll.  Everybody raved about it.  I'm so glad you shared it with us.  My husbands Aunt liked it and when she likes someing it must be good ( she wants the recipe ).  She wants me to make her one for Thanksgiving.  I made mine last night for us and its all gone to day ( there's only 3 in my family ).  This recipe is a keeper.  For someone that's never made one before try this recipe.  You'll want to make it again and again ...... :) :) :)

This is the most awesome chilled dessert ever!!!  It's perfect, my family doesn't like anything pumpkin but I tricked them on this one.  They loved it, I don't know if I'll ever tell them it has pumpkin in it.  Thanks for a very tasty recipe and something different.

A wonderful rolled cake and nice filling.  This recipe is very easy to do, the only trick is peeling the wax paper off the roll when it comes out of the oven and not to let it sit too long.

Make sure to use a long enough cookie sheet.  Mine was too small so my cake was a little too thick, but it was still yummy and my neighbor, to whom I have sent over many many delicious recipes, said this is my best yet!  Imagine~~

This was my first shot at making a "rolled" cake.  It turned out great!  It was so easy and tasted wonderful.  It was a hit at the office Halloween party.  Everyone has asked for the recipe.  Try it you will be glad you did.

YUMMY!!!!!  I found this recipe a week ago and have made it 3 times.  It is a very easy recipe to follow and the cake comes out so moist.  Definately going to make this for holiday treats.

Really tasty, and easier than I thought it would be! I only have a couple of suggestions to make. First make sure that you spread the batter as evenly as possible. It took me a bit of doing to get the batter even in my pan. Also I would use a dry towel to roll the cake part in, rather than a damp one. I made two rolls, and found that with the damp towel, the outside of the cake stuck a little to the towel. Overall, a great recipe!

Terrific! Made it twice in the same week for two different parties; it received rave reviews both times. Suggestion: Garnish finished roll with finely chopped pecans or with sifted powdered sugar.

I DID IT! I was so scared of the rolling part. In fact I screwed up the first one and tried again. WHOOP WHOOP! It worked. I didnât have a linen towel so I used wax paper. I am so excited I made this. Yummy!

Great recipe! My only edit would be to let the rolled cake cool *completely* before unrolling and frosting it. I followed the recipe instead of my gut, and it melted the frosting and squished out the sides With my previous experience with rolled cakes, it's important to cool it completely to prevent this from happening.

I have been making this for at least 30 years it is very easy to make. if you have problems with the  cake cracking make sure when you roll in the towel the towel is sprinkled generously with powdered sugar, and you make sure it cools completely at least 2 hours before you attempt to unroll and fill.  also make sure you are using the correct size pan to bake the cake in if the cake is too thick it will crack.  the recipe can easily be doubled to make two cakes and use the entire can of pumpkin.  I like to chill my cake over night prior tofilling when done I double wrap in foil to freeze this cake freezes very well and I usually make the first week of November for Thanksgiving and I give it as gift to fire station and few friends.  take it out of the freezer about an hour before serving. My family actually loves it frozen the filling tastes like ice cream

So easy and delish!! I used a cookie sheet and greased it with crisco and then coated in flour. Cake didnât stick at all! Then I used a silicone cookie rolling mat covered in confection sugar instead of a damp towel. It all came out perfect! Iâm so proud of the final result and taste!!

I made two today, (because I split the first one a little) anyway followed direction totally.  We eat a couple of pieces after dinner,  it was awesome.  Good, looks good, taste good, easy to make,  inexpensive,  no complaints here.  I didnât put more confection on it at the end cause we are not into over sugar.

My first try at a pumpkin roll. It wasnât the prettiest one, but tasted fantastic! Used reviewers tip of turning onto powdered sugar on parchment paper. I think I just need more practice. Will try again at Christmas.

Oh my gosh. This is ridiculously yummy. My son's eyes lit up like a Christmas tree when he saw this. He had been asking for one since he tried it somewhere else and he was EXCITED. Around mouthfuls of cake I managed to hear, "Mom! This cake is LIFE!" Yes. He really said that. The whole roll was gone in 6 hours. It was REALLY easy to make. I used freezer paper to roll it and then I just rewrapped it in that when we cut a piece and it stayed fresh. I think the trick to getting it unrolled without cracking is to test it every couple of minutes because the temp. needs to be just right.  And the filling needs to be COLD. I will make this again. And again, and again...

I have tried many pumpkin roll recipes and this one is the one that everybody can't get enough of! For me freezing 24 hrs before serving is the best because it gives that sticky moist cake.

This recipe is literally garbage. Even though I greased and floured the pan, as instructed, the cake stuck to the pan and broke in half when I tried to lift the pan. It stuck to the towel when I tried to unroll it. When I finally added the filling and tried to roll it back  it the cake literally disintegrated between my fingers.

I made this for a bake sale and individually wrapped the slices.  It turned out beautiful and perfect (and delicious!) on my first try, and I've never made a rolled pastry before.  I might add a little more pumpkin pie spice next time because I like a spicy flavor for pumpkin goods but overall this recipe is excellent.

I made this for Christmas, a few days ahead. I had never made a roll cake in my life. I was terrified it would fall apart when I tried to roll it. Since Celiac Disease is in my family, I substituted the wheat flour for gluten free baking mix, left out the baking soda as it's already in my baking mix, added 1/2 tsp more spice as we love it spicy, and added 1/2 cup marshmallow cream to the filling, left out vanilla since I hate it. The cake did crack a bit when I tried to roll it but once it had cooled enough to wrap in plastic wrap I pushed it back together, froze it, and it was fantastic come Christmas dessert time. Every morsel was eaten and bragged on. I wish I had made 3 or 4 of them. I will definitely be always keeping the ingredients on hand and baking this roll again, maybe even tonight!! Sorry I can't rate it as it is but the Celiac prevents that :-( Otherwise it's a perfect recipe and I'd give it a hundred stars if I could. Thank you for posting this recipe.

INCREDIBLE! This was about the 2nd or 3rd pumpkin roll recipe I've tried over the years, and it is the BEST!!!!  It produced, hands down, the best pumpkin roll I've ever had, either from any store or homemade by anyone. The cake was moist and bouncy, and the cream was sweet and smooth.  A perfect combination!  Follow the instructions and they'll produce very satisfactory results.  I will never use another pumpkin roll recipe!  Thank you, Angela!

Never had luck with roll cakes, but this turned out perfectly! I used vanilla instead of lemon juice as suggested by one user. The video was very helpful. I have made it twice and will be making it again! Big hit at a family gathering!

The roll was easy to make but just wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be. I'll try it again with additional spices.

I just made this and I'm sure it will taste good, however, a 9 x 13 jellyroll pan does not result in a cake that will look like the picture that goes with this recipe...it's kind of like false advertising.  It simply isn't wide enough (rolling from the long side) to result in that many turns which is what makes it pretty.  I won't be serving mine to company.

I have made this a couple times and always got great reviews.  Forgive me if this is too obvious, but when releasing the cake from the parchment, don't lift the paper straight up, bring it back low/against itself and it will release without additional tools.  I always roll from the long side and cut into two cakes, wrap in plastic then foil and freeze in a freezer zip bag so that I can whip one out at a moments notice and it is wonderful even months later.  Great recipe. I love this site.

This pumpkin roll is  very popular with my customers and co-workers. It's very moist and incredibly easy.  I'm going to get another jelly roll pan so I can make several in less time. I use a towel (linen type) to roll and it works great.  Cool about 1/2 hour, gently unroll  and let rest a little before spreading filling. I layed parchment along long end and, after filling, rerolled it right onto the parchment. VOILA. It makes a great presentation.

This pumpkin roll got rave reviews from all the people who tried it. The only recommendation I would like to try is maybe using a longer pan as I wish the cake and filling were more evening spread throughout. I was hoping it had more of a spiral look. Definitely will make again, but will experiment with baking time and pan sizes.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. The only trouble that I had with it was rolling the roll without breaking it. ON my third try it was perfect. If you guys are having trouble with the same thing I would following recipe exactly for rolling and making your cake part a little thinner. The Icing was about my favorite cream cheese to powdered sugar proportions that I've ever tried. It was so good!!!

This roll is the best, everyone I make it for wants more, you really need to butter your pan and I also use cooking spray just incase so it won't stick, get flour sack cloth, and put powder sugar on in and flop your pan on in, perfect every time, hope this helps.

I give this cake a 5 star for taste but 4 for assembly.  It's a very delicious tasting cake but hard to assemble (although it is my 2nd time attempting this).  The first time I made it, it was a disaster!  The cake fell completely apart in pieces when I unrolled it from the towel. The cake is very moist (I used fresh pureed pumpkin, not canned...don't know if that makes a difference)and just stuck to the towel.  The 2nd time, I took the advice of some reviewers and put waxed paper on top of the towel.  It worked out much better but I still had to be careful unrolling it.  After putting the filling in, I was only able to give it 1 roll...maybe it's too much filling? Other than that, the cake and filling is delicious.  I guess with practice, the assembly will get easier.

This is an excellent pumpkin roll.  I made 39 for Thanksgiving!  They were so delicious that more and more people asked if I would make them for their holidays.  The only difference is I let the pumpkin roll cool for about 10 minutes (on a cooling rack) and then turn it onto a floured piece of parchment paper.  I haven't been successful with cloth towels.  Don't worry if it cracks, when you wrap it in plastic wrap be sure to wrap tightly and place in refrigerator.  The cracks disappear.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

We enjoyed this. While mine did crack, it was a small crack and I'm not one to care so much on appearances. Hubby and the kids loved it. The filling was a bit sweeter than I expected (will cut down on the sugar next time) and it definitely tasted better the next day after it had sat awhile. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious and easy. I followed it exactly but added a little bit of kahlua to the cream cheese mixture to give it a little extra something. Will probably make this again soon.

I wanted to do something different for dessert and I tried the roll.The idea of the roll is very similar to the salmon roll with spinach so I found it quite easy to do. It is simply delicious and all my family were pressed.They couldn't believe that it was made with pumpkin.Try it and you won't be disappointed.....

I like many other reviewers was nervous about making a dessert roll. I followed the recipe exactly other than using a 10x15 pan like so many others said they did, I sprayed the pan lined with wax paper and then greased and floured the wax paper.  I turned it out on the towel and the paper peeled off without a problem I then rolled it let it cool made the filling (again followed recipe exactly)  I thought it was just the right amount.  rolled back up and trimmed the ends so I could taste test. YUM.  my second one is now cooling in its towel as I write this review (a can of pumpkin will make 2 rolls, can't have waste!)

Great recipe, definitely adding it to my dessert repertoire!  For some texture and to tone down the sweetness, I added 1/4 cup of finely shredded coconut.  if sweetened, you may want to add less icing sugar.  As another review mentioned, there was extra icing with 1 full package of cream cheese.  1.5 times the ratio would give you enough for two cake rolls.

I also sprinkled 1/2 cup of finely chopped walnuts after I spread out the frosting.  I'm also thinking of doing a carrot cake recipe instead of the pumpkin roll next time.  I used some concentrated orange juice instead of lemon juice for the acidity to activate the baking soda and it seemed to work fine.  Chilling the frosting and making sure the roll is well cooled will prevent excess squeezing out at the ends.  You gotta try this,  you'll LOVE it!

This tasted way better than I imagined it would. I am a huge fan of anything with cream cheese so this hit the spot. The only issues I had was mine stuck to the pan just a little but it did come out okay. Also I wasn't sure if I rolled it up in the right direction. Of course I didn't think of that until after I had already rolled it from short side to short side. It was fabulous either way. Definitely keeping this recipe. Thank you thank yoi

It turned out better than I thought it would being my first roll cake. I did use the wax paper and cooking spray when baking as recommended by others. Next time I will use less filling because it was too much as well as less butter. I used walnuts in my mixture as well and that improved the roll a lot.

The cake was delicious, but instead of following the directions and using a towel, I listened to one of the top reviewers of the recipe. My mistake! I know better than to do that instead of trying the recipe as written first. I followed the advice of allowing the cake to cool while still in the pan, flipping it onto another sheet of parchment paper, spreading on frosting, and then rolling the cake. It sounded too easy to be true, and unfortunately the cake cracked in several places because it should have been rolled in a towel while warm instead. 

Next time I will follow the instructions and I'm sure it will turn out better.

I was out with 3 of my kids one day and my 11 year old stayed home by himself.  When we got home he had this cake all ready for our enjoyment. It looked and tasted amazing and I couldn't help but be amazed that a  little boy made it by himself...this is a keeper recipe.

This recipe was spot on, easy to follow for someone who has never made a pumpkin roll before, and it was soooo gooood. My mom, dad, and husband all gave it 2 thumbs up and 5 solid stars. My only advice from my first time making it is to be absolutely sure that the cake has cooled before attempting to roll it back out and put the frosting inside of it. In fact, I would be cautious and make the cooling time double what is listed in the recipe. The heat from baking was trapped in the towel when I unrolled it and it was breaking in some parts where I tried to roll it back up. Also, I was a little skeptical about pouring the cake into a cookie sheet, but if you use a large cookie sheet, it is perfect because the cake is thick enough to stay put. Other than those minor details (because I was able to piece the cake back together when it broke in some parts anyway), this is a wonderful recipe!

I followed the directions to the T.  The video helped quite a bit!  I was worried about cracking/smooth rolling and didn't need to be.  It rolled quite well.  I used an 11 x 15 jelly roll pan & the batter didn't quite get to all the edges but it baked smoothly and beautifully.  The center seemed set about 3 minutes before the timer went off so I took it out of the oven. Also, I used a recipe for pumpkin pie spice found on this site.  It was 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/8 tsp ginger, 1/8 tsp. cloves, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  I am so excited to serve this at my party tonight!

second time I made this it was a fail. Filling was good but cake was way too bland. Note to self-find another pumpkin rol recipe.

The flavor was great, but this makes about twice as much icing as you need.

Easy to make and tasted fairly good. It was a bit too moist for my liking, but I am glad I gave this recipe a try. I can't say I'd make it again due to my preference of how a dessert should taste, but it wasn't bad and it looks very cool ;)

I have been making this particular recipe for over 10 years...it has never failed to please my family and they look forward to it each year.  My greatest tip to get your cake out of the pan is to use NON-STICK FOIL.  This is an item I use for all my baking needs, but it seems that not many of my friends know of it's value.  I swear by it; it will peel right off!  I prefer to use a wider, less deep pan (10x15 or so) because it's easier to roll and the filling can spread out better.  Do not bake until the edges are crispy or it will be difficult to roll and won't taste as good. Happy baking!

Absolutely wonderful recipe!!!! Moist,delicious with no cracking!! Super easy too!!!!! I used parchment paper instead of the dish towel!! Worked great! And I sprayed the parchment paper with cooking spray before spreading out the batter!! I think it prevented it from sticking and or cracking!!

So easy. Moist and rich. 1 loaf easily yielded 10-12 servings. Freezes well, and keeps well in refrigerator. Didn't buy pumpkin pie spice, so used recipe from this site (Pumpkin Pie Spice II): 1t cinnamon, 1/2t ginger, 1/4t cloves, 1/4t nutmeg. I like nutmeg, so I doubled the nutmeg. Found it pays to buy name brand cream cheese. As with many cakes and breads, folded in pumpkin puree, eggs, and lemon juice, taking care not to over mix batter. Used 11" x 17" jelly roll pan, lined with wax paper, and sprayed with olive oil (didn't change baking timeâ¦ still 15 min). Another reviewer suggested dampening dish towel by laying over-wet washcloth on top of itâ¦ this worked PERFECTLY.  I did spread a little powdered sugar on towel, but it really wasn't all that necessary. Had no trouble with cake sticking to pan or towel. Made sure that cake had no time to cool when not rolled up. In other words, turned cake onto damp towel as soon as it was removed from oven, rolled immediately. After filling, rolled again and wrapped in plastic. I think this helped prevent drying and crumbling. As others suggested, pre-mixing cream cheese filling and refrigerating it was brilliant, because the chilled mixture was easy to control while I spread it and re-rolled the cake. As soon as I re-rolled the cake (with the filling inside), I wrapped the finished product in plastic wrap (saran). Refrigerated overnight before party. Finished product was moist, tasty, made a nice presentation, and guests RAVED!

I took this to work as a treat. Everyone RAVED about it! The cake is so moist and the filling just sweet enough. You do have to make sure not to over-do on the filling though. Too much leaves it bland and unable to really taste the cake. Using parchment paper on the pans is a way to make it easier, too. And the cake cools quickly, so make sure to roll it in the moist towel right away.

This is a very delicious recipe and easy to make.  Cream cheese goes well with pumpkin.  I shortened the steps by adding a piece of parchment paper to the bottom of the jelly roll pan eliminating the use of the towel and powdered sugar.  Peel the paper back to loosen it first then roll. Use your powdered sugar on top for some decoration  just before serving.  It looks like snow on a yule log.

I have made this only once but it is amazing. I was surprised how easy it was to make- the cake stayed really moist and never showed signs of cracking. It looked just like the picture- the presentation was just great. I used a pumpkin pie spice substitue and also added in a dash of ground mace. After researching a couple other recipes and taking note of the reviews I decreased the filling a little- only using 6 oz. of cream cheese. None squeezed out and the result was picture-perfect. Will make again- granny kat must have been a good cook.

This was SO DELICIOUS, and not nearly as scary or difficult as it looks. I used a cheesecloth to roll up my cake and skipped the powdered sugar, but the cake didn't stick at all and it was actually fairly easy. I had a little bit of a mixing bowl mishap so I didn't follow the cake recipe listed here and instead just sort of ad-libbed a pumpkin bread/cake recipe, but I followed the filling recipe just substituting maple syrup for the sugar and it was AMAZING. I would definitely make this again for another special occasion and am considering making this one again next year. Thanks so much for this great recipe! And I highly recommend the cheesecloth method, especially if you're trying to avoid added sugar.

I've been making this recipe during the winter for several years.  Since I came across it at 
allrecipes.com. My husband in not a sweets eater but this one he devours. I love to tease him with just putting it in the fridge (just as good cold) so he can be surprised when he sees it. He swears he gains weight because of it.

I made this for book club and everyone raved.  I made it in one bowl mixed everything by hand.
I did not have pumpkin pie spices so just used the porportions of what I use in making pumpkin pie. Cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger.  From beginning (including cooling time) to end, this was done in less than 1 1/2 hours.  Wonderful, thank you...

Have made this for years, but use a clean dry pillowcase instead of towel.  Sprinkle conf. sugar on it and roll up and tie loosely until cool.  Spread with icing and sprinkle with chopped pecans also.  After re-rolling wrap and plastic wrap and refrigerate.

U wanna spice up your pumpkin roll ? Add about 2-3 shots worth of cinnamon schnapps to the cream mix, goooooooooood stuff !! Just thought I'd share that with you all if interested. I've used Goldschlager and Dekuyper Hot D@mn! 100 proof Cinnamon Schnapps. The liquor really adds a nice little touch to an already really great recipe :) Enjoy !!!

OMG!!! I have been scared of doing a roll dessert but with some tips from reviews this was the easiest dessert.  

I didn't change a thing to this recipe.  I lined a cookie sheet with parchment paper and cooked it that way.  I then put the powder sugar on a towel, placed it on the cake, put my cooling rack on top of that and flipped it.  After I frosted the cake and rerolled it I put it in wax paper and put it in the fridge to harden up...

It was DELISH!!! so rich and yummy.

Just a note for the nice people that wondered about the powdered sugar/damp towel part. The powdered sugar serves two purposes. One, it makes the cake come away from a dry towel. The other is it prevents lint from following the cake. If you use a damp towel you should be able to avoid the sugar. Now.. into the kitchen to make the wonderful recipe. I don't have have pumpkin pie spice but I'll just do the cloves, cinnamon,nutmeg, ginger thing. Cheers!!

This is by far my favorite desert recipe. I've prepared this several times. For best results, I use a 10x15 cookie sheet lined with wax paper and spray it with non-stick cooking spray. After cooking, I flip it onto a damp linen towel but never sprinkle powdered sugar on the towel as the dampness always caused it to clump up in ugly blotches and most would just get rolled up inside the roll anyhow. You can always "sift" powdered sugar over the finished product if you want that added visual touch.

My Husband and I LOVE this recipe!! He wants me to make one weekly lol.. I use 2 teaspoons of Ground Cloves instead of the pumpkin spice, it makes a big difference in flavor, and is SO much better :)

I can't even begin to explain my love for this recipe!  Every single person who has ever tried this absolutely loves it.  I have given this recipe to numerous people and make it every year for thanksgiving.  It's a pretty simple recipe and the cream cheese icing is the best one I've ever had!  You can't fail with this recipe!

Very easy recipe and very yummy. Only thing to be careful of is to not let the cream cheese filling get too warm/room temperature or it squishes too easily out of the roll when trying to fill the inside of it.

This did not work out for me at all. I had no trouble baking the cake and releasing from the pan, but it was all downhill from there. I rolled it and cooled exactly as was called for, but it definitely took longer than 20 minutes to cool completely. After about 45 minutes of cooling, I added the frosting and tried rolling it and it completely fell apart. I'm not sure what exactly went wrong because I am a pretty experienced baker, but this was certainly a failure :(

Yes, this roll is definitely a 5-star!  It was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving--everyone gobbled it up in no time at all!  I followed one of the reviewers who suggested to use parchment paper, and that helped a lot.  My cake also slightly cracked when I rolled it, but as with others, once I cut it, no one noticed.  They were too busy devouring it!

Recipe done as-is... complete disaster. Tastes like bland sugared mush. Does not come out of the pan unless extreme measures are taken. Do not waste your time or ingredients!  Might work if you use all of the "fixes" other posters have mentioned, but a good recipe shouldn't require so many alterations.

My mother made this annually when I was growing up for Thanksgiving parties in elementary school and also made them as gifts. I stuck to this recipe as it is and it came out exactly the way I had hoped it would. It tasted just like I remembered it. Now that I know how to make it, it is going to become a tradition in my house once again. The only thing I did differently was add chocolate chips to the filling, which was an excellent addition. I highly recommend this recipe since it is a great holiday dessert which even looks impressive.

Whenever I make this pumpkin roll there is never a crumb left on the plate.  My coworkers always request this for Thanksgivig pot lucks.  This is at least the 7th year in a row that I have been serving it.  I've also found that it works much better using 10 x 15 inch pan and lining it with wax paper.

I made this for the first time today and it came out delicious! It doesn't look like the picture, but I wasn't really expecting that since I started baking. I added extra powder sugar into the cream cheese frosting and added 1/4 cup of pumpkin puree into it. Yummy!

love this, i always read the reviews first,i too added finely chopped pecans to cream  mixture.  By baking  in the larger pan, i did use all of the filling and it was easy to spread by chilling it while the cake cooled.

Excellent recipe with the Splenda substitution exactly as written.  Did not need to add additional leavening agent.   This was the first 'roll' I ever made, and because I was successful, I'll try another one!

The roll is super moist and cracks very easily.  Also if you bake with waxed paper the wax will melt into your food.  Yuck.  You wont be able to taste it but still...  I recommend using parchment paper or foil instead.

What a great recipe, and it was actually pretty easy to make.  After making some soup I had leftover butternut squash and I was looking for a recipe that I could use it in -- this one worked perfectly! Since squash is a little sweeter than pumpkin, I reduced the sugar by a 1/4th cup. I was out of vanilla extract so I used maple syrup in the frosting, which I think was almost better since it added to the "autumn-y" flavor.  I was worried about the cake cracking, but the texture was so spongy that I didn't have any problems at all while rolling it.

So easy and everyone loved it.  Served with vanilla ice cream.  I made it on a 15X11 jelly roll pan and baked for about 13 minutes.  The only thing I will do differently next time is mak sure that the batter is spread evenly so that the middle of the roll is thicker.  This can lead to cracking when rolling the filling in.

This tastes delicious.  The rolling technique didn't work well for me.  When I unrolled it to put the icing on it cracked so I kind of had to smash it together there.  I will try this again, but will try something different for the rolling.  I also used Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese to cut a little bit of the fat.  Again, this is totally delicious and I'll make it again.

Very good. I think I would add just a pinch more flour though with that much pumpkin it gets a little too soft and not cake-y enough. But it is moist and very tasty.

Eh. Not wowed by this as most others seemed to be.  I used parchment paper as suggested, and had no problems with sticking or rolling.  My issue was with the cake itself.  I found it to be strangely spongy and too sweet.  My filling was mascarpone rather than cream cheese - it was what I had on hand.  Liked the filling well enough.  I'll prolly try a different roll recipe next. Someone mentioned Libby's.....

Excellent recipe.  I added a little extra pumpkin spice, as well as cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also sprinkled sliced almonds on top of the filling, which gives it a nice texture.  The filling will not run if you make it while the cake bakes and keep it in the fridge until you need it.  Don't heat the cream cheese to make it room temp., either.  Melty filling = a pain to roll.  I lined my cookie  with wax paper, then greased it and sprinkled powdered sugar on top.  I then just used that same wax paper to roll up the cake ( yes, it was hot) and it came off super-easy.

My husband and I cook 3 days a week for our local Senior Center along with the Meals on Wheels program. We made this Pumpkin Roll for our seniors but we added finely chopped walnuts to the filling, to help meet the protein needs for the meal. It was so easy and a big hit.

I give this a 5 star for taste and a 3 star for directions. The taste was perfect but I don't think 20 minutes is long enough for the cake to cool. When I moved it to the towel it cracked in two places. I also think the filling should probably cool off before spreading. It gushed out everywhere. I wish I had read the reviews before making this because I would have done things differently. My cake looked really sloppy when it was finished but it tasted wonderful. Hopefully I'll have better luck next time with a few changes.

I strongly recommend using parchment paper in the bottom of the pan. You will have no problems/risk it sticking. The roll was great! Enjoyed very much!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I have never attempted a pumpkin roll, but tried this for the first time. It is the best homemade dessert item i've made. I didn't change a thing from the recipe, except I used the 11 x 7 cookie sheet like others suggested.

Love it. I let my cake cool for 20 minutes and then placed it on the the damp towel. I then let it cool rolled up for 15. Then frosted and threw in the freezer after wrapping in foil.

great recipie. havent tried it yet. but have tried the frosting and pumkin bread separatly, I know it'll be great. the only change I made is, at the verry end after i added the frosting, and rolled it up. i rubed it town with powered sugar to combat the sticky moisture on the outside. looks great. i'm sure it'll taste great.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I have had pumpkin roll since I was a kid and when I moved the pumpkin roll just didn't taste right on the west coast. I was imtimidated to make it since both my mother and grandmother who are experienced cooks said it was very difficult and don't bother. After years with no pumpkin roll I finally got fed up and tried using this recipe. It tasted fantastic! It was not near as hard to do as I imagined, but it did end up with a fairly large crack in the side. Nobody else seemed to notice the crack but me and it was gone in a few short hours. I can't wait to make more and I think I will make a few and keep some in the freezer. Thanks for sharing this!

DELICIOUS, but you should really use an 11x17 inch cookie sheet. I made 2 using 11x17 and they were perfect. The one I made on the 9x13 inch pan broke into 3 pieces when I tried to roll it because it was too thick.  I also lined my pans with parchment paper and the cake came off of the pan really easily.   I was very nervous because I never made a pumpkin roll before but it was way easier than expected, they (well 2 at least of them) looked amazing, and they tasted great. They freeze well too- still soft after almost a month. I just let it thaw overnight in the fridge and it tasted great the next day.

Turned out very moist and delicious. I doubled the batter, so used a bit more than neccesary in pan and the cake portion was too thick in proportion to cream cheese frosting filling. Also with remaining batter I made 4 cupcakes which were very good.  My fiancee said it was like a big twinkie but not chocolate! Cream cheese part was really yummy :)

My first pumpkin roll and it turned out pretty nicely. The roll wasn't too sweet, which made it perfect with the sweet filling. It was very thick and ended up being difficult to roll and cracking a little, so next time I will try a larger pan. I will definitely make this again.

Very, very nice!  If you want to spice it up just a bit, try adding about a quarter cup of chopped, crystalized ginger (the dry kind, not the kind in syrup) to the filling.  I mix it in, but you could also just sprinkle it over the filling before you roll the cake up (but it is a little sticky this way).  Because I REALLY like ginger, I also add about 1/4 tsp of dried ginger to the cake batter - I know is doesn't seem like it would make much of a difference, but it just adds that little bit "extra".  Have a happy Thanksgiving all you wonderful cooks out there!

Made this on Halloween for a dinner party, everyone went crazy for it. I add walnuts to the cake as well as vanilla extract, extra cinnamon and nutmeg. Took another reviews suggestion and add orange zest and juice to the filling...really gave it a nice flavor especially when it sits overnight.

this worked very well and the icing came out perfectly. I doubled the recipe and had 2 very large pumpkin rolls. They are twice the size sold at the Mennonite Store.

Great recipe, wonderful taste.  Don't worry about the pan.  If you flour and grease well it just pops out.  Next time though I will use a bigger pan.  My 9x13 made it too thick to really roll beautifully.  If it were a bigger spread and the cream could be spread thinner it would have spiraled better.  Oh well, tastes the same!

Ok ladies, I need help on this one.  Who has a jelly roll pan or cookie sheet that is 9 X 13?? I have several and none are this small.  So I made the cake in a cake pan and the timing was not correct and when I turned the cake upsidedown, it was a gooie mess.  I popped what I had left in the oven again and after bakingrolled it up in a sugared towel and it stuck to the towel.  For first time pumpkin roll bakers, lining the baking pan with parchment is a must.  Also, coating the damp towel with confectioners' sugar is a must.  I gave it a rating of three not because of the taste, but because of the directions.

These rolls are the best, and i'm not usually one that cares for pumpkin. I like to subsitute Splenda instead of sugar and they always turn out great! and the best is that they're sugar-free!

This is delicious! I love how spongy the cake turned out...it was tough from keeping the towel being stuck onto the roll, but I will have to practice getting it perfect next time.

Best Pumpkin Roll I had ever had.  I like that this pumpkin roll recipe is not cakey. I made my roll a little thinner than the recipe calls.  I think this roll is more like a pastry which makes it a very delectable dessert.  I also like the idea of another reviewer who makes dessert bars with this recipe.  I do think that the filling is to much and over fills the roll other then that wonderful recipe

I was disappointed when I couldn't find my favorite pumpkin roll recipe. After searching many variations of this recipe, I decided this one was the closest to what I remembered. I wasn't disappointed. It was perfect!!! This is an easy recipe. I took it to a work luncheon with 16 people and they were wanting seconds! Next time, I'll take two :)

I have made these and I found that after I roll it up in the cloth putting it in the fridge to cool works great. You don't have to wait on it to cool so long and the filling works best on a cool cake.

Great recipe. I was a little hesitant to try it, worrying that it would fall apart on me, but I had no problems whatsoever. However, the second time I made it I didn't have any baking sheets with raised sides available, so I used one that was a bit deeper. Do not do this! It did not bake up well and I had to throw it away. In conclusion, great recipe, but don't try it if you don't have the right pan!

Ohmygoodness.  I love this recipe.  It is so good and I always get compliments.  I have a lot of fun with the rolling process too...  although I am never confident it will turn out.  ;) If you are making for the first time, just expect that the rolling might not come out Martha Stewart perfect, even though it will taste delicious.  I suggest trying a practice roll before planning to bring it to a get-together.  The cream cheese will squish out at the ends a bit.  I thought this meant I had really messed it up, but when i sliced it still looked great.

I really enjoyed this.  It was a little bit of work, but I have never made a rolled cake before.  I made it for Thanksgiving, and everyone really enjoyed it (although one person said it was too cake-y), and of course their favorite part was the frosting!  I'm sure I will be making this again.

So comforting.  I made this for a Halloween get together.  I basically followed the recipe as is for the most part, except I did line my pan with parchment paper before pouring in mix so it easily flipped out onto towel.  I also sprinkled the wet mix with chopped walnuts before baking.

This was the first time I have made a pumpkin roll and this recipe was easy to make. Had no problem rolling it and it didn't stick to the pan. The cake seems a little too moist and the filling was a bit thin (I added toasted almonds) but otherwise, delicious. I will make this recipe again with a couple of tweaks :)

FYI...I'm not a baker, have never made a roll cookie before, never used fresh pumpkin puree either and this turned out great!  I used parchment on my 12X16 jelly roll pan, used lots of powdered sugar on the towel, made the filling and chilled it and cooled the roll in the fridge about 40 minutes as suggested by other raters.  My sister who is an excellent cook and baker really loved them...they were on the moist side, but everyone enjoyed them that way!  I will be making these again!!!

I just made this today.  It was actually very easy to make as I followed the directions to the T.  Never made a cake roll before and I did use wax papers on the bottom and top of the cake and that made it very easy to roll up.  Very, very delicious!

Great recipe. I made this for a party & everyone really enjoyed it. I used wax paper in the bottom of a 11x15 baking sheet & I flipped it onto wax paper that was sprinkled with powdered sugar. I rolled it up with wax paper. Turned out beautiful! I will be making more of these for the holidays. Thanks

This tastes just like pumpkin pie with cream cheese frosting! AWSOME! It was easy to make and was a huge hit. It also looks great when sliced and stacked like the picture. They draw people towards them.

Very good! I used a 11x15 cookie sheet. I also used canned pumpkin pie mix instead of pumpkin and reduced the pumpkin pie spice to 1 tsp. And added 2 tbsp flour to the batter. The cake was still very moist, will probably add 1/4 cup flour extra next time or maybe reduce the pumpkin. The cake did stick to the towel. Need to use alot of powdered sugar, or parchment paper! It was a big hit at work!

WONDERFUL!!! This is a great Thanksgiving dessert that will be added to my table every year. Easy to make and a nice change from the usual pies and cakes. I followed the directions exactly and it was delicious and a nice presentation. I didn't slice it until serving and sprinkled the top with powdered sugar. Thanks!

I have been a lurker for years on this site using lots of recipes but never signing up to leave reviews, etc.  But this is SOOOO good I had to sign up and let everyone know!  I was worried it might not turn out because I don't have experience with fancier things like this, but it came out PERFECT!!  Many compliments from my friends.

This recipe is fantastic!  I brought it to work for one of our food days... and it was the first dish gone... before lunch!  Not over cooking the roll is key...don't want it to be crispy on the edges.  I've noticed that lining my pan with wax paper also helps getting the roll out of the pan with ease.  I love cinnamon, so I add a few dashes of it to give it something extra.

Very delicious!  I would recommend that before baking the pumpkin cake part, make sure that it is really smooth.  It doesn't settle much while baking, and a smoother top would make it easier to roll.  I ended up leveling it with a bread knife.  I double the recipe and baked it in a half sheet pan, which made the roll about 3" in diameter.  Also, the cream cheese filling does need to be refrigerated.  The cake is still a little warm after 20 minutes, so my first attempt caused icing to thin out a bit.  But I didn't mind.  The filling tasted like icing and just having a thin layer was perfect.  I think next time I will try more cream cheese and less sugar.

This was EXCELLENT!! I did exactly as the recipe stated and it turned out great.  I was a little worried that putting the icing on after the 20 min cooling period would still cause the icing to melt, but I did it anyway and put it directly in the refrigerator.  After a couple hours, we ate some.  YUMMY!!

I'd never made a pumpkin roll until last night--nor had I heard of one...however, it sounded very tasty, so I put it to the test.  My wife says it is "scrumptious", and I'd say it's wonderful...not to mention it filled my kitchen with a great pumpkin scent...

I've made this recipe for years and it is my most requested recipe for the end of year holidays.  The only difference in my recipe is to use a 10x15 jelly roll pan, sprinkle the top of the cake with finely chopped walnuts before baking (it adds a nice finished look to the cake when you serve it), and I roll from the short end, not the long one.  This definitely tastes best after it has been well chilled.

I loved this recipe. I did use other suggestions I had read like I used a bigger pan and added a little more pumpkin spice. I thought the recipe was very good tasting and easy to follow. My mom and I had so much fun baking this delicious pumpkin roll.

This tasted good, but the cake wasn't as sweet as I would have like it to be. Also, it was really moist, almost wet. Maybe I dampened my towel too much. I always thought the pumpkin cake part looked lighter in color too.  Mine was darker.  I will try other recipes. It wasn't great but we didn't throw it out either!

I probably need to work on my "technique", but this tastes GREAT!  Overall, it is easy to make, but I had trouble with it cracking.  No one cared - it was inhaled very quickly!

This is one of the best pumpkin desserts I've ever made or tasted. It was the first jelly roll type dessert I've made, but it was easy to make and came out almost perfectly (for my first time). I recommend it for pumpkin lovers as a wonderful autumn treat.

I wasn't very impressed with the recipe. I didn't like the flavor of the cake very much. I think that using a larger pan would make the recipe work a little bit better.

Great taste!  I chopped up some walnuts and sprinkled them on the individual slices along with a bit of powdered sugar.  Very yummie! I would like to know what size jelly roll pan someone might suggest for this recipe.

Extraordinary recipe!  I have been making pumpkin rolls for years, and this is by far the best pumpkin roll EVER!  Very, very moist and delicious!  The filling is creamy and wonderful.  Makes a impressive presentation.

DELICIOUS!  I was worried at first about the amount of flour(seems less than I would have expected) but I followed the recipe and was delighted. Spiced Pumkin and sweet cream cheese filling...it doesn't get much better than that!

I finally found an easy and great tasting pumpkin roll!
My first time making it and what a hit. I made this for a get together and I felt bad for everyone else who made deserts, there was none left. Next time I will make 2. Thanks.

This is a great recipe!  Since its Christmas, I sprinkled some red and greed sugar on top of the frosting and then rolled it up, also mixed some into the frosting. I added a couple of tablespoons of whipped cream to the frosting.  I also sprinkled some powdered sugar on top of the cake before I put the frosting on; it helped to stop the frosting from oozing.

Always loved this, but never tried making it to now. Yummy.  Mine cracked but I didn't except to make it perfect.  I added pecans and we loved it.  I double the recipe to make two, since you are going through this process anyway.

Made this for an office party & everyone wanted the recipe afterward.  My cake cracked in a few places while rolling it up but it wasn't really noticable.  I sliced up the log and arranged the slices on a pretty platter then dusted everything with powdered sugar.  One hint: place the cream cheese filling in the fridge while your cake is cooling.  This "thickens it up" a little & less will end up squishing out the sides of the roll.  Thanks again for this wonderful recipe!!!

This was a huge hit at a weekend get together. Someone actually stole the platter of rolls and ate them by themselves. A great dessert for any occasion. It looks beautiful if you present it on a light colored plate with flowers as a garnish.

I actually had a terrible time w/ this recipe... and I'm usually a decent baker. I made it in a 9x13 pan, but I think that was too small. The cake part was not done enough and so when I rolled it it broke apart and the icing oozed out. It was so bad that I had to throw it away. I gave it two stars because it all tasted great.

So good, so good, so good!!!  I love this recipe.  Easy to make, turns out great.  This is always a hit for the holidays, or any time of year.  I don't really care for pumpkin, but the flavor this brings is more of a spice cake.  Paired with sweet creamy cheese, and wow!  SO GOOD!

I didn't care for this cake, but those who tried it said it was very good.  I didn't find that the cake had much flavor and I did not like the filling.  I this with more spices in the cake and a whipped cream filling, this would be a keeper.

EXCELLENT RECIPE! EASY TO MAKE, IF YOU FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS TO THE TEE. MAKE SURE THE TOWEL IS A DAMP LINEN LIKE TOWEL AS STATED. I ADDED CINNAMON AND NUTMEG AFTER SAMPLING THE BATTER TIL I WAS PLEASED WITH THE DEGREE OF SPICES.  ALSO I FROSTED WITH VANILLA CANNED FROSTING.  PIPED SOME FROSTING DOWN THE CENTER OF THE ROLL AND SPRINKLED WITH COLORED JIMMIES.  FABULOUS TASTING. THANKS SO MUCH GRANNY KATS!!

I made this dessert for a dinner with my parents and my boyfriend's parents and it turned out great.  I made it a few days before and froze it, and when I served it everyone had two slices (after a full meal!) and said how great it was.  The only changes I made were to add extra pie spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves to the batter, to give it more "oomph," and added some pie spice to the filling.  Great, easy recipe!

I used a cookie sheet (with sides). I also used other reviewers suggestions and added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp nutmeg instead of the pumpkin pie spice. The best suggestion was to line the pan with waxed paper (instead of flouring). I lifted the cake right out. Delicious.

Cream cheese filling is excellent!  The roll itself was not quite spicy enough for me, but it was very good overall.

My kids are not big dessert eaters, but they absoulutely LOVED this and keep asking me to make it again.  Made a great addition to my Thanksgiving menu...something a bit different from the usual pumpkin pie.

I know it's almost spring, but I just had a huge craving for this. I like to dust it with some 10x sugar before serving. And whenever I make these, I have some leftover filling. I just keep it in a little sealed container & use it to slather on each slice. I can feel my thighs expanding...

I can't give this recipe enough praise. It was so easy to make.  It was my first roll in about 15 years and it turned out perfectly.  It tasted terrific and the icing just completed perfection.  It was a huge hit over the holidays.  It was one of the first desserts to become extinct on the dessert table and I think has become a new family favorite!

I made this recipe for my family on Thanksgiving and they couldn't believe I made it myself.  I am just learning to cook so if I can make this anyone can.  I love the way the slices look on a tray and the taste is unbelievable.  Thank you for this recipe.

I love this recipe.  The cream cheese filling is delicious (I hate frosting).  My only problem is that sometimes the cake cracks.  I always get compliments on this recipe.

I am going to give it a 4 star rating because it does taste GREAT, but my experience making it was terrible. It must be because I used a cake pan and not a jelly roll pan, I really do not even know the difference, but make sure you use the jelly roll pan!!! Like I said TASTES GREAT (any form)

This was the best.  I'm not fond of Pumpking, but this is awesome.  I got great raves on this from my husband's family, that never gives praises.  It's very easy to make, and everyone asks for the recipe, so make copies.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it! I don't like plain pumpkin pie or pumpkin cream pie for Thanksgiving dessert. This was perfect! Very moist and pretty. I used a jelly roll pan greased. Then greased and floured on top of parchment paper. It came out fine, but I think I let it cool too long because it cracked on me rolling it up after the filling. Fortunately the crack was on the bottom!

Thank you SO much! I had a craving for this (had thoughts of it on T-day), made it today - the day after T-day!  I sprinkled chopped pecans on the batter for baking - you can roll it so the nuts are on the outside (pretty) or inside! Either way! Delicious!!!!!! - Sharon

This is delicious! I have made 2 of these at a time, and kept one in the freezer for a month, and served it with lasagna for guests, and it was just as good as the first one, and my guests couldn't believe I made it! It is also quite impressive to look at. Thanks to Granny Kat!

Totally delicious dessert! While my roll looked like it was rolled by a five year old, the taste more than made up for my poor rolling skills. Outside of rolling, the recipe is easy to make. I did not have the runny issues others had but I was thankful for the following tip to take it off the cookie sheet - sprinkle the cake with flour, place the wet towel over it, place another cooling rack on top and flip. As a total spaz with things like that, my cake stayed in one piece for rolling.?? I can't wait to try this recipe again.

It tastes great, but out of two attempts, I could not get it to roll. The first time, the cake was too thick to roll, so I cut it into strips and stacked it. The second time, the dough was the right thickness, but it stuck all over the damp cheese cloths. I ended to scraping it all up and making cake pops. :(  The directions need to be improved in order to  facilitate the creation of an actual pumpkin ROLL cake.

after making several deep-dish pumpkin pies I had a lot of pie filling left over.  It was not enough for a pie, but too much to throw out. Normally I would make pancakes with it, but I wanted something different. This is the perfect recipe!  Thank you Granny Kat!

I made this for Thanksgiving. It is so easy to make. As I was ready to serve I sprinkled the top of my dessert with a combination of confectioner's sugar, Ginger and cinnamon to give it an extra kick. I did this to taste and everyone loved it.

This recipe has already become a family favorite. I used 3 tsp of pumpkin spice instead so it has more flavor. I also bake the cake for closer to 18-20 minutes. With my oven, 15 minutes left the cake gooey in the middle. I also turn the baked cake out onto plain parchment paper without sugar. When I tried turning it out onto a damp towel with powdered sugar, the cake absorbed the sugar and became too sticky on the outside. To decorate, I melt white chocolate with coconut oil and drizzle it onto the finished roll in swirls and circles. It makes for a beautiful finish.

I made it as written and it was a really easy roll to make and it rolled beautifully. The texture of the roll was nice but the flavor was just ok. I found it rather bland, not enough pumpkin and not enough spice. With all the 5 star reviews, I was expecting more from this recipe.

I wonât give it a 5, because my family havenât tasted it... I just added a little bit more sugar to the filling for my taste. The recipe is fairly simple, just follow directions (just because I forgot to dust the towel with sugar). Thank you!

The test run, held three days before Thanksgiving was perfect, beautiful, moist and lovely.  I thought it could use the barest increase in spice and a touch of salt.  I made those changes on the log that I am bringing to the big traditional gathering tomorrow.  But it looks dry!  And it cracked!  I am going to take it anyhow and bring aerosol whipped cream.  If they get too snarky I will just not claim it!  LOL, the fam isn't that bad.

This was so quick and easy. Kevin loves this and I can't wait to do it again. I did it just like the directions said, my batter didn't fill my whole cookie sheet pan so I just spread an even coat without it being too thin. Next time I will use softened butter for the filling.

I had bananas that needed to be used up and could not find a banana roll recipe, so I used this recipe. Pureed bananas were substituted for pumpkin, cinnamon and nutmeg were substituted for pumpkin spice. I also added Madagascar bourbon vanilla bean and Tahitian vanilla beans. I added 1/4 cup more butter, and also my homemade Tahitian bourbon vanilla extract to the frosting. It is fantastic and even my twin cub 8-year-olds who like nothing like this!

Excellent if followed exactly. I did not have pumpkin pie spice so I mixed 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg, and a couple shakes of ground cloves. Taste was spot on!

Well....I read all of the reviews and even watched the video, which I never do.  And....my  cake cracked in addition to sticking to the towel.  If I hadn't forgotten a suggestion by one reviewer to place parchment paper between the cake and the towel i might have avoided the sticking problem. As far as the cracking problem, I 'm guessing that I let the cake cool too long....or not long enough. I really was hoping that this would come out well as it is (was?) for a party.  It may still be salvageable once it's chilled and I attempt to slice it . Fingers crossed.

This recipe is delicious! The only problem I had was the âdampâ towel to roll it in. The towel should should not be damp, it made the powdered sugar wet. I have made these many times with a dry towel and it works perfectly fine. I recommend not using a damp towel. Very good pumpkin roll recipe.

Even though making this was a pain like you wouldn't believe, it was completely worth it. I made the roll for a group picnic the night before, and it remained incredibly moist and fluffy the next day.  One thing i'd suggest is laying down a piece of parchment paper on top of the damp towel so the cake doesn't stick as much to the towel itself.  Big props to those who were able to get the cake layer on the towel and roll it up without burning the  out of their hands haha!

Yummy!! I have always wanted to make one of these. when I saw this recipe I had to try it! plus it was pumpkin and it's fall so I made it. every one loved it  I did not  do the powdered sugar on top I just made a little more icing  and put that on top  and I never sift the sugars.  I think the cake part could cook a little bit more  I cannot  wait to make again! five stars for sure!!!

This was a fairly quick and reasonably easy recipe to follow and everyone who had some of it said it was delicious. I agreed that it was pretty good but I did think it was more moist than other rolls Iâve tasted. Donât know exactly why but Iâm not adverse to using the recipe again. Having the correct size pan and following the recipe step-by-step, including the cooling allowed me to roll it out and back up easily. And the spiraling came through very well. All in all, a successful trial!

The recipe was kinda vague on a couple of the instructions. For instance it just said âadd sugarâ for both the white sugar and the confectioners sugar. (When in doubt use the order of the ingredients list) it didnât say if you should cool the cake before rolling in on the damp cloth so it stuck to the pan and the middle fell out onto my cloth all wet still. I guess I mustâve left the cloth too wet cuz the cake stuck to it even though it was dusted with confectioners sugar. It tasted great but came out pretty ugly. I would definitely do a few things different the second time I made it but I donât think the recipe is very user friendly.

Beat the eggs for 5 minutes first to incorporate more air.  Very good. I used 2 teaspoons cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg since I didn't have pumpkin pie spice.

My 1st pumpkin roll!!!  First - the pan size is too small. I used the size the recipe called for but the cake was much too thick. Longer to bake as well. I looked at other recipes and they are all basically the same but calls for a 10x15 pan. Just ordered a jelly roll pan from Amazon so will make more. Taste really good.

This is a new family favorite! I use parchment paper so haven't had a problem with it sticking to the pan but the bread does tend to break as I'm rolling it. Even broken it firms up when refrigerating so no one has noticed. Love this recipe!!!

I am a beginner at baking and It was a bit difficult when it came to rolling up the cake. Mine ended up cracking and it was bigger in size but I thought it looked pretty thin when I put it in the oven. But I am delighted to say that it still tasted great even though presentation was not quite what I had hoped.

I made this last fall and last night my daughter asked if I could please make that pumpkin roll cake I made last fall! So, it's memorable! And delicious! She'll be pleased when she comes home from school today and finds it on the table  =)

I've been making this exact recipe for 40 years, however, I sprinkle chopped walnuts on the batter then bake it! Delicious!

I made this pumpkin roll just as it was written and had no problems with it sticking or rolling it up. Its pretty tasty as it is but, adding some ground cloves and or nutmeg would be nice in it if you want it to have more of a spicy fall type flavor.

This pumpkin roll was absolutely delicious. Some advice though, is to let the cream cheese and butter soften, that way they mix better, and another thing is that if the cake is not cooled down enough the filling will start to melt and make a mess, you want to chill the filling if the cake is still somewhat warm, but don't freeze it. And if you let the cake cool too much it will rip, but doesn't affect the taste, just presentation. And an optional twist is to make the filling a tad sweeter by probably adding a little bit more powdered sugar.

I followed the instructions and used a damp towel to roll it, this made it very sticky. I will use parchment paper like others have suggested next time.

My family can not stop complimenting this Pumpkin Roll!  I even needed to make it gluten free, so I substituted, King Arthur Gluten Free - Measure for Measure flour, and it rose, came out very moist and.... PERFECT!  I have been asked to make this again before the holidays!

Well I made this with my kids for Christmas, and it was so sweet you would think it was purchased at the supermarket.  Plus the cake part of this was not at all tasty per say just ah........ I am blown away by how many great reviews this has gotten which leads me to go back to my old cookbooks and not believe anything on the internet. This was a real waste of time and money. Oh well. Going to go find a good recipe in a good book now.

I have been making this for years. Follow recipe but I have found when I wrap the cake roll up in with clear wrap and dish towel I leave in fridge for a few hours to cool and shape before I unroll and add icing. Note: I donât apply confection sugar before rolling .Family favorite!

Very good, very easy! I cut the sugar in the cake to 2/3 cup, &I double the frosting ingredients and make 3 cake rolls! I think that is the perfect amount, to the thickness of the cake roll! Also, I reuse the parchment paper just respray it each time!

The only thing I added was  a bit more pumpkin pie spice to around a tablespoon.  I sprayed a pan with cooking spray, laid a piece of parchment down and then sprayed the parchment with cooking spray. I took a spray bottle of water and lightly dampened a tea towel and dusted with powdered sugar and had no issues with cracking. For those wondering about the lemon juice, I believe it is there to neutralize the baking soda. You can't taste it. This was a delicious recipe and I made 2 rolls from one can of pumpkin.

A few years ago I lost my pumpkin roll recipe so now I just make ones that I see online during the holidays.  This time it was this recipe which I made exactly as it's written, I liked the cake like consistency, it wasn't overly sticky like some of them can be.  The problem was the cake didn't taste like much of anything, maybe more of the pumpkin pie spice or other spices added as well would help? The inside was good but it tasted more like whipped cream than cream cheese, I did notice a comment that a different cream cheese icing from a different recipe tasted better so while I might use this recipe again, I'd def tweak it.

I used Half APF and Half Cake Flour, instead of all APF.  Also instead of using lemon juice I used Pineapple Juice, still using the same amount..  The end result was extremely MOIST & favorful!!

I had shoulder surgery a few weeks ago and can't cook/bake yet.   My husband who has zero experience int he kitchen was able to make this recipe perfectly (with a little guidance from me).  We decided to bake for 15 minutes in a 11x15.  Great flavor and texture, easy recipe to make.

Followed the instructions with the exception of adding the lemon juice to the batter and increasing the pumpkin spice to a tablespoon.  I used 2 linen napkins, slightly dampened using a spritz bottle, after dusting with 3 T powdered sugar.  I rolled the cake while still warm and placed it in the fridge for over an hour.  Cooled the cream cheese mixture before spreading and topped the cream cheese mixture with some chopped walnuts.  Also added 1/8 tsp pumpkin spice to the cream cheese and replaced the lemon with vanilla.  After filling and wrapping in saran wrap, I lightly squeezed the roll from the middle to the outside to even out the cream cheese mixture and the roll.  I did use my jelly roll pan which is larger than the 9 x 13 pan recommended.  Nothing broke and nothing oozed.  I cut off each end to make it pretty, ate them both, and it was delicious.  Very simple recipe & instructions when done correctly.  This was my first pumpkin roll and I watched several videos as well as reading the comments here before attempting.

I found this recipe years ago and made it once (I thought).  My kids, who are now all adults, demand that I make it every year for Thanksgiving. They can do without the turkey, they can do without the dressing, gravy and sweet potato dishes, but heaven forbid if I even think about skipping the pumpkin roll. I will never hear the end of it!

The flavor is AMAZING!! I could not get mine to roll without cracking, despite being insanely moist.  After rolling it with several cracks I wrapped it tightly in plastic wrap then put it in the fridge to set up, this helped keep it's shape as a roll and still looked presentable when I cut it into slices.   I also lined the pan with parchment paper then sprayed with cooking spray, had no issues with sticking.  Make this roll

This was my first time making this so the cake broke upon unrolling it so I believe it was on me. I gave this 5 stars because it is very easy to make and the flavor was awesome.  I will be making this again.  Thank you for the receipe

Instead of pumpkin pie spice I used 1tsp Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp nutmeg
I also did a 1:1 gluten free flour instead of regular flour.

No i did not make any changes. And if I had the ingredients I would make it every night. But in the future I would take out a half ounce of cream cheese from the frosting.

It was okay but a little rubbery as others have noted.  I tried again and added 1/4 cup more flour.  This slightly improved it but still not perfect.  Third time, I whisked the egg yolk with 1/2 of the sugar until thick and pale then stirred in the pumpkin.  Whisked the egg whites with the other half of the sugar to soft peaks.  Folded them together then folded in all of the other ingredients.  Perfect!!!

Soo moist and delicious. I have never made a roll cake before. I did watch a YouTube video about how to properly roll it to make sure that I did it right, without any cracks. That was most helpful. Parchment paper is a definite must!

The cake broke in a couple of places when rolling.  I probably should have let it cool a little longer.  I added pecans to the filling.

awesome and moist!  The first time I made this I tried to roll it width wise and all of the frosting smooshed out.  The second time I made it (because it is so moist and good) I rolled length wise and the frosting stayed in place!

I made it as written. I did let it cool a bit longer than twenty minutes and chilled the filling in the fridge before spreading it. I thought it seemed like there was not enough filling when I spread it on as it looked super thin in spots. It came out perfect though. I did place it in the freezer for forty five minutes as suggested by a reviewer. We ate it right after that. I like shortcuts that get the yummy in my tummy faster :)

it was really good and fun to make. this was in fact the first recipe i made on my own. i didn't make the frosting correctly so it needed reinforcements to stay together. it still tasted good. fun recipe, 10/10 would bake again.

Family loved it, my first at trying a "roll" recipe, went great, worried for nothing.  Was thinking next time of adding maple syrup and maybe nuts to the filling the next time.

I made the pumpkin roll according to directions but the frosting was another business, I used a whisk together the ingredients instead of starting with the cream cheese, the result was a soupy mess. I added the soupy frosting and it fell through the pumpkin roll. Even so, my family loved it. It tasted great. It didn't look great but it tasted great. Thank you

The only change I would make is to make sure to use a large enough pan that the breading spreads think. If not, the amount of frosting is a bit overwhelming. Otherwise, great recipe! Super easy!

I made this and it was great, but the filling needs to be doubled if not at least 1/2 serving more. Just not enough filling. I also put the rest of the pumpkin puree in with the cream cheese and that gave it a nice color as well and didn't have to throw the rest of the puree away. 

Baking it to save towels, and laundry I used parchement paper and sprayed the sides to prevent sticking. I waited until it cooled just enough where I could handle it to roll the cake. This will also prevent the cake from cracking. I removed the parchment paper when ready to spread the filling.

For the filling, I made whipped cream with rum extract and mixed in with the cream cheese, about 1 to 1 ratio. Made the whole thing a little lighter and the rum tastes really good with the pumpkin.

I read a lot of comments about this recipe before getting started, and I followed several suggestions:
1. I used a larger pan (15.5 x 10.25").
2. I covered the pan with parchment paper (leaving some hanging over) and sprayed the parchment paper with Baker's Joy spray with flour.
3. When the cake was done baking, I sprinkled it with confectioners sugar, laid my damp (linen) towel on top, then used a large cooling rack to invert. The parchment paper then came right off!
4. I added about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon to the icing. It didn't really add any cinnamon flavor, but it helped cut the cream cheese a little bit.
5. I refrigerated the icing while the cake was cooling, then I spread it carefully and evenly, and it didn't come out the sides at all!

My pumpkin roll turned out perfect and I'll definitely be making this again (and again and again).

Thanks!!

This was my first attempt at a pumpkin roll and it was very successful! I used wax paper instead of a towel because I feared fabric softener flavoring from my towels! The flavor is fabulous and I will definitely be making these again. The large can of pumpkin makes 3 rolls.

-MY guy and his family fell in love with this moist and delicious Pumpkin Roll. I found out that my guy's ex-wife always would bring on at Christmas and hardly anyone would touch it. I think this cake was a bit spicier and the moistness made the difference. I will be making this Pumpkin Roll more often. Thanks for sharing.

It was amazing.  I did add a tablespoon of local honey to the filling.   It was such a hit for dessert on Thanksgiving that people have asked for it to be an annual staple on the dessert menu

The recipe and ingredients were great, it tasted awesome! I would really like a more thorough set of instructions, however. And it's crucial to include tips and more detailed instructions for pastries like this.

It was my first pumpkin roll ever and it was very tasty!  I made rookie errors and my roll was cracked pretty badly.  Overall it's a 10-10.

A holiday staple in our family! If you have a lot to cook, this is a good one to get done early. It freezes fantastic. 

I tried a damp linen, and ended up with confectioners sugar dough. Used a dry linen, with plenty of confectioners sugar on it, and it worked great!

Also, it is very important for the butter to be softened, as well. Ended up with chunks of butter in my batter. Microwaved it on 50% power for 20 seconds, and that took care of it.

Made it for the first time.  I watched the video first since this was my first attempt at a roll cake.  Followed the recipe exactly.  The spices are perfect.  The cake is so moist and delicious.  So far my family of five loves it.  Now to share with others.

I followed the recipe exactly. I spread the batter in a parchment-lined 1/2 sheet pan (it was too large a pan, but I spread it to a uniform thickness). This turned out amazing for my first attempt! It rolled easily and was delicious chilled. Thank you for an amazing recipe!

Amazing recipe! I used a 10x 15 jello roll pan and it was perfectly cooked in 11 minutes. I would follow the rule of letting it cool rolled up for 20 minutes as otherwise it becomes too moist and the cake breaks. Also, I found the filling a bit bland and heavy so I folded in a cup of whip cream and add 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I then chilled the filling so it didn't spill out when I rolled it. I will make this again many times!

I made this for everyone at work. I made them huge so it was little difficult to roll, but if I did the size in the recipe it would have been fine. It tasted amazing and everyone loved it. Next time I will try to experiment with the cream cheese filling to add some extra flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly but whenever i went to roll it it broke in half.  It was very gooey and sticky at the top which made everything even more difficult. After the cake broke I just made pumpkin bars and they taste amazing with the icing. Will probably attempt this recipe again to see if I can roll it.

Excellent. No changes needed. Moist cake, great flavors, easy to make. I waited a very long time before filling it so the cream cheese wouldn't melt - definitely more than 20 minutes.

This is the absolute best Pumpkin dessert I have ever had or made. People have continually asked for it even for Christmas gatherings. The only change I have made is I double the filling because I make a bunch of them and use 1 cream cheese and 1 Mascarpone, it makes a smoother and less sweet filling and gives a nice balance

This turned out beautifully and was a hit at a party! It's so easy to make as well!
These are the modifications I incorporated after having read some reviews:
1. Brown sugar instead of white.
2. Greased a cookie sheet, placed wax paper, greased the wax paper, and placed the batter. 
3. Used wax paper sprinkled with confectioner's sugar to place the baked batter over. Rolled up with another greased wax paper.

I made this and fortunately followed the tips in many of the reviews.  The video was extremely helpful as well.  I took the desert to a Christmas party and came home with an empty plate.  Everyone loved it.

Specifically, I used the wax paper in the pan under the pumpkin bread while baking.  It stuck a little to the bread, but not too bad.  I also used a thoroughly damp cotton kitchen towel to roll the bread.

Delicious!  Worked out well following recip and swapping in GF flour.
Not sure what I did wrong, but my cream cheese frosting was too thin, so I added in to some fresh whipped cream and it was delicious.  

Tasted just like eating a light airy pumpkin pie.

Amazing recipe for Pumpkin Roll. I needed to add about 3-4 minutes to the baking time for my high elevation to have it be cooked through, as well as adding 10-15 minutes to the cooling off time to let it fully cool.  Everyone loved this recipe, it was fantastic.

Note to those who had their cake "stick" to the towel...The recipe should say a lightly misted flour sack towel...they do not have a pile ...they are very smooth textured.  A (dry) sheet of heavy freezer paper works also!

My 11-year-old wanted to make this for our Thanksgiving dessert.   She needed my help only for the rolling.   We gratefully accepted the hints to use greased parchment paper and to chill the icing for a bit before adding to the cake as it does tend to ooze out of the sides.   Though, for us, that was part of the finger-licking fun!  She added a pinch of ground ginger to the icing along with pecan pieces (no walnuts on hand)  and the flavor was subtle, smooth and delicious.    She was so proud of the end result and the compliments from her brother and sister.   This is a new family favorite!

Followed the recipe exactly, only used a bigger pan, and it turned out perfectly. My husband even declared this his new favorite Thanksgiving dessert!
The cake is moist, and just sweet enough, and the filling is creamy and delicious.
I will definitely be making this again.

I did not have a thin linen or a cheesecloth so I improvised.. Clean hanes wifebeater worked perfect and disposable :) Cake was a little well done. 
 I did not let it cool but flipped and rolled as soon as out of oven, worked great! The icing delicious!! But too much icing when I rolled it,  icing was coming out the sides..but I  will try again- Maybe chocolate cake with baileys irish cream in icing  and add some color to the icing for the holidays!

This recipe is quite amazing, It was a great family bonding time making this and the taste is great! :) It was a little bit moist but did not at all take away from its excellent flavor. Tip, It tastes even better if you grate ginger into the batter, works best with a 9'13 pan!! It is a little intimidating but don't be fooled, this recipe is relatively easy and GREAT!!

This recipe is 5 star in taste hands down! USE A BIGGER PAN or a flat cookie sheet definitely. The 9Ã13 jelly roll pan would be ideal if you halved the recipe, both the frosting and the pumpkin roll mix.    This recipe can be a little complex but, read the reviews!

It worked really well for me. I used parchment paper when I baked the cake part and it stuck minimally. Also instead of rolling it in a wet towel, I used wax paper and there was a lot less sticking. Another thing, the first time I made this I used a block of cream cheese and it was nearly impossible to spread without ripping the cake so the second time, I used spreadable cream cheese and the icing was much easier to spread. Putting it in the freezer for 45 minutes also helps it to set much faster. Overall, a good recipe that is very tasty.

I used only 1 tsp. cinnamom and cut out nutmeg because of spices. This is a best seller, literally at our church bazaar. I had absolutely no problems with the cake turning out or sticking. I LOVE THIS recipe.

I have made this twice, the first time was good but too much filling. The second time I adjusted the filling and it turned out perfectly. The adjustment I made was I made 1.5  of the cake and 1 of the filling and this was a great combination. Will definitely make this again.

I watched the " how to" video several times and read reviews.   I was nervous that the roll would crack and not roll.  I used the larger pan12x17 and it was thin enough to roll  tightly.  I also used greased parchment paper.  It is similar to making sushi rolls with a bamboo mat.  Roll slowly and tightly.  The filling is enough to be thick and generous.  I left roll in freezer for a few hours before cutting.  No problems and it  looked just like pictures and tasted even better!!!! This is a keeper!

To be honest, the only cake rolls that I've eaten were purchased ready made from my grocery store bakery.  So I was expecting this to have the same texture, but was surprised when I bit into  it and found it very dense and rubbery.  It didn't taste bad, but was incredibly sweet too.  I have  been baking and cooking for 30 years  and have made cakes, muffins and bars from scratch and had no problem following these directions.  It rolled perfectly and I had no trouble with it sticking to the damp cloth.   It is too bad that this is only a one  sided  comment system, because I would really like to know if this is the texture that we are  supposed to get and if not...what went  wrong?  It sounded promising, but my family and I didn't care for it  and we are big people and eat everything ;)

I used a freshly rinsed stoneware jellyroll pan (the only jellyroll pan I have) and though I greased and floured it generously, it stuck like crazy!   I suppose it might have been because I used hot water on the pan (though I dried it thoroughly, heat changes the texture slightly).  Next time I'm definitely using parchment paper.
That being said, the recipe was otherwise easy to follow and used all ingredients I have on hand (yes, I keep pumpkin on hand. :P ), and is SUPER TASTY.  It would probably be even tastier if I chilled it like they suggested.  But who wants to wait that long for pumpkin roll?

We love this cake.  Instead of using a towel when rolling up the cake, we used something called the Easy Cake Roller.  It  doesn't leave lint on the cake and seemed to make the cake more moist.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Ridiculously moist and yummy! I have to make at least 4 of these for Thanksgiving, and give my brother and sister in law 2 rolls during the hoildays. One for him and the other for her. I gave them just one roll for Thanksgiving of '13 and my sister in law hid the last slice. My brother caught her eating it, after she said there was none left, and he was not very happy about that hahaha. These are the devil but so, soooo good!

I have made this recipe half a dozen times over the past couple months and have found it to be a fantastic starting point. However, I did change a few things. Instead of a full can of pumpkin I only use a half to 3/4 because this is a very dense recipe and the air can collapse. Also I whip the eggs with a hand mixture first to add air into the recipe. I found this part very important! I also used a full cup of flour instead of 3/4 and I used a wee bit more baking soda. I also don't measure the spices. I add Cinnamon and Pumpkin Pie Spice to taste.

This is a great recipe, but the size of the pan is definitely not listed correctly.   It needs to be a greased jelly roll pan, sprayed with waxed paper laid on the sprayed pan.   It is a moist cake and taste better if made a day or two ahead.    Don't try to roll it too tight after you have spread the filling.   I always use a tiny dab of whipped cream with a sprinkle of nutmeg to finish it off.   Everyone loves this dessert.

This was just ok. The cake was so spongy and tasteless, though the filling was yummy. It cracked while rolling so the aesthetics weren't particularly pleasing. The kids enjoyed it, though I think I will try other recipes, as the cake was just so bland.

This recipe probably deserves 3 stars. The pumpkin roll was alright, but not delicious. My family said it was "good", which comparing to the other recipes when they say "this is great!", means it was worse. The recipe never states/warns about the chance of the pumpkin roll cracking, resulting in many people complaining about it in the reviews. Couldn't recommend this recipe, but I might make it again.

this recipe is awesome. I have made it several times each year for 6+ years. The ONLY thing I would change is how you keep the cake from sticking. the recipe suggests grease and flour. Every time I've done it this way, it sticks and falls apart. instead, spray some cooking oil on your pan, line with parchment paper and lightly spray again. it's perfect every time. This recipe is delicious and beautiful. Make it. you'll love it!!!!

A little time consuming, but very rich and delicious. I put wax paper on a cookie sheet, and sprayed the wax paper well with non-stick before spreading out the pumpkin mix on it.  I would do a little more filling next time to make it creamier.

This was fun to make! I wasn't able to get it to roll up quite as nicely with the linen towel. I might try parchment paper next time I make it. It was such a HUGE hit at the Open House for the bank where I work. Customers loved it and my coworker said I won the baking contest (even though there wasn't one). I highly recommend this recipe.

I didn't roll mine. My neighborhood dinner this month called for pizzas only. I wanted a pumpkin dessert pizza. I used this recipe as written and used a round pizza pan instead. After baking, I moved the "pizza" to a pizza stone to look more authentic and iced it so that there was a "crust" around the edges to hold on to. Everyone loved it!

I made this recipe three times and got different results, both good and bad! I've never made a jelly roll before but using the instructions regarding a damp linen towel DID NOT help the already moist roll - the first two attempts, the roll became too moist almost to the point of soggy badness, so for my third attempt, I used a dry linen towel, dusted with confectioner's sugar etc etc, and the roll turned out decent, still very moist but held together. The cream cheese filling is very decadent and heavy so my rolls were really heavy - I will use half the filling recipe for the next time. Thank you for the recipe!

I used parchment paper to roll it up instead of a towel in powdered sugar, added an orange's worth of zest, sprinkled walnuts on top of the cream cheese before rolling it up, and used cinnamon/allspice/cloves in place of pumpkin pie spice.  I even made a gluten free one by replacing the flour with Pillsbury's GF flour.  I got rave reviews on them both and will definitely add this to my baking rotation!  Absolutely DELICIOUS!

I've made this several times and I always get wonderful compliments. I often will double on the pumpkin pie spice and I've made this with canned sweet potatoes instead of the pumpkin. It comes out great both ways. Like other reviewers, I always spray the baking pan with Pam, then I place a piece of parchment paper in the pan and spray with Pam again, so that the cake doesn't stick when taking out. When the cake is done, I too roll it in a damp cloth. However, I am a little wary of getting cloth fibers into my roll. Just to be safe I set parchment paper on the bottom and top of my cake. That way when I roll it - the wet cloth is never in direct contact with my cake.  This cake turns out great each and every time. It might, however, take a few times of practice before it looks perfect too.

Tried this as one of the many desserts I served at Thanksgiving this year...and it was great!! 
The only thing I would say is you definitely need to use some wax paper at the bottom of the pan, and really need to be careful because it did crack on me a little bit...I also would suggest making a little more cream cheese frosting (mine ran a little low when I got to the edges). 
However, other than these few bugs, I would DEFIANTLY suggest this. It was moist and delicious!

My cake needed to be cooked longer then 15 min and damp towel should be changed to sprinkle with water. It was my fault that I followed the recipe and did not double check the cake was done and it was 100% goo in the middle. Unhappy!

I made this for the first time last Thanksgiving because we need some last minute desserts and we had all of the ingredients. It has turned into a favorite for my friends and family and it is fun to make. The biggest issue I have is getting done all the way through without overlooking it. I bought a new pan that I hope will solve this issue. It is yummy even if it doesn't always look perfect!

The taste was pretty good. The "cake" was kind of on the plain side however. Cream was good. Not too sweet. I didn't like how the cake part was so dense. I couldn't even describe the texture of it, but after reading some comments it was definitely comparable to fudge. Not cakey at all. Followed the recipe to a T except I had to bake the cake longer since it was still gooey after 15mins.  I was pretty disappointed. This doesn't compare to other pumpkin rolls I've had. I'm suprised at all the raving reviews.

Good.  I subbed acorn squash for the pumpkin because that is what I had around.  The cake was delicious.  Not quite enough filling though to cover the whole.  I'd make this again for sure and up the cream cheese to 12 oz and adjust the rest the filling ingredients, too.

Overall, very average taste. The filling was a success and I will use it again. The cake was very very spongy and tasted like a bland spice cake. Needs more pumpkin and spice. Also the cake does not need to be spongy and wet to roll well...dense and moist is more desirable.  Will not use this cake recipe again.  tip....I used parchment paper instead of towels and it worked great! Just make sure to do your initial roll up while it is still really hot.

Much easier than expected! I did not have a jelly roll pan or even the right kind of towel the recipe calls for but I somehow made it work and pulled it all together. Splashed a little of the lemon juice into the icing as well to tone down the sweetness, but the finished result was fantastic! It was a hit with all my kids, my husband, and even my critical father! Definitely will be doing this one again.

This is my go-to recipe when I'm looking for a dessert. It is pretty easy to make and tastes delicious.  After filling it with icing, I roll it up in aluminum foil and freeze it until a few hours before I'm going to serve so that the cake stays firm while slicing.

This was good, really easy to make. I spread it out in a large pan and had no problems with cracking. I had the icing in the fridge but it was still too runny so next time I'll do the icing first, get it in the fridge to solidify while I make the cake part. The flavours were good, might add more spices to the cake next time and more vanilla to to icing. Great texture, nice and moist. Thanks!

Loved this! It was not as difficult as I thought it might be after reading other reviews. I did spray the parchment paper with Pam first, which helped a great deal I think. The only cracking I had with the cake was when I began to roll it; but the first part that is rolled is the inside of the roll, so no one sees it anyway. The outside looked beautiful, and the taste is great! Was a huge hit.

This always turns out delicious, but sometimes the cake compresses. Be careful not to roll too tightly in the towel while it's cooling.

There's a lot of icing. If you're feeling remotely health-conscious, halve it.

I rate this a 5 because of the taste, and I get so many compliments about itâ¦. BUT it is an adventure every time I try to roll it up. I cook it on parchment paper and just roll it from that. I have tried everything from transferring it to another piece of parchment, using a towel, pre rolling it hot, etc etc. This works about as good as anything. The key I think is to roll it up tight in plastic wrap after you roll it up. Good luck! May not always look pretty, But it tastes great!

This has become our family standard recipe for the holidays. I must make it Gluten free, however, this makes no difference in the outcome. We do not feel our Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners complete without it.

The taste of this pumpkin roll is absolutely perfect. I was a little nervous about flipping it onto the linen right out of the oven but I had greased and floured the pan as the recipe states it wasn't hard at all. I didn't like the idea of using a towel so I used a damp pillow case. The amount of icing was perfect and it didn't flow out of the sides as others stated. In the end my family all said it was the best pumpkin roll they had ever had. I will definitely make it again and again.

I've been making this recipe for a few years now and my family and my fiancÃ©es family loves it! However, when rolling, lay parchment paper on both sides of the cake and sprinkle powdered sugar on both sides the cake touches. Without the parchment paper, you'll get little towel hairs on the roll because its sticky! Rolls easy this way.

The filling was great! My husband didn't like the "cake" part said it wasn't "fluffy" like cake wants me to do it again but find a fluffier cake. All in all it was very easy to make

Tastes delicious! I used a cookie sheet lined with wax paper and sprayed with vegetable oil to make it easy to peel off. I make these in bulk because it's not worth it to do just one. So I made all the cakes first and left them in the fridge then made the icing and took them out one by one. They freeze very nice wrapped in Saran Wrap and then foil!

Had a request from my son to make him a pumpkin roll. I agreed though I had never made one before.  This recipe was DELICIOUS!!!!  Turned out picture perfect!  Made it a second time with chopped walnuts. Could use pecans, too.  Sprinkled them on the cream cheese mixture after it was on the cake and rolled it up. Will be making it for Thanksgiving, for sure!!!  Thanks Gramma Kat for this great recipe!!

when i made this recipe i doubled it because i needed two. used a cookie sheet instead of a roll pan.  It came out perfect no cracking.  i made sure the towel was a little more damp and put it in the fridge to cool.  When i took it off the pan i made sure it was right out of the oven hot i didn't allow it to cool before rolling it into the towel and used a handful of confectioners sugar to coat the dampened towel.  to liven up the filling i added a teaspoon of the pumpkin spice in with it and used lemon flavoring instead of the lemon juice.  the filling held together better.  great recipe and gives a lot of lead way for tweaking.  Absolutely wonderful.

Used 50% less sugar in pumpkin roll and didn't miss it. Need to smooth out more evenly in baking pan next time. Pumpkin cake was uneven / lumpy which resulted in uneven distribution of filling.

I am very picky about pumpkin roll....have had too many that were spongy, dry, or flavorless.  So I was a little hesitant about trying this one, but am SO glad I did!  This is, in my opinion, the PERFECT pumpkin roll recipe.  Now, a confession....I was feeling lazy, and simply baked the cake part, and used the filling part as frosting and cut into squares.  OMG could not stop eating them!   Thanks for the recipe I've always wanted!  :)

I followed the directions exactly including using the 9x13 pan as it states on recipe! I think that was my problem, It should say 11x15 pan I think.  My cake didnt cook all the way through, but it was too late to put it back in as I had already flipped it.  I rolled it into a short roll since it wasnt as long as it needed to be then it cracked and was a mushy mess since the middle section wasnt fully cooked!  What a bummer!  I put it in the freezer anyway to atleast be able to try the ends that were ok.  The filling was delicious!  I will make it again, but using the larger pan and hope 2nd time is  a charm!

I made this first thing today, and I made two batches.  The first one I put in the recommended size pan, lined with parchment paper that I sprayed very lightly with cooking spray.  The second batch, I split between two 9x11 inch pans.  The first one had to bake a few minutes longer, but the second batch was perfect at 15 minutes.  I sifted powdered sugar on top of them after they cooled about ten minutes on the counter, then used the parchment paper they baked in to roll them with.  I let them cool well over the 20 minute mark, just because I was busy.  The parchment paper does not stick if you sift the sugar over the cake, and when you unroll it, you need to be slow so it will not pull apart.  I had no issues with the cake tearing, splitting or breaking at all.  I spread the filling on the cake, leaving about 1/2 on the sides and the outer edge.  The edge that will be the center, I made sure to really fill it up with the icing.  The one bigger roll simply has more pumpkin bread/cake, and will look better on the table the other two were thinner,they were both very tasty.  I chose this recipe because the color was better (I used pumpkin and NOT canned squash, which is what most pie fillings are) and I will add more spices next time, just because we really enjoy the nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger a lot.  The texture is great, the taste is wonderful and this has turned into a family favorite.  The thinner bread is also better for my husband, a type 1 diabetic. Filling was perfect!!

SOOOO GOOD! Loved the flavour, was easy to make. The only thing I didn't care for was the texture of the outside of the roll after it was wrapped (was a bit too moist/sticky). I tried to dust with icing sugar to combat that, but it didn't help much! Nevertheless, will make these again.

I just rolled my rolls (I doubled the recipe). I was pleasantly surprised how easy my cakes came out of the pans. I just used my spatula and loosed it around the edges and under and then flipped the pan upside down on my prepared towels. Maybe some forgot to spray their cake pans before they put the batter in. Anyhow, house smells delicious! Going to freeze these for later use.

Awesome. Only change i made was reducing the sugar to 2/3cup. Lined & greased JELLY ROLL PAN with parchment paper,took 15mins. Pulled it out and dumped it out on prepped towel. waited 1 minute for it cool off and wrapped it up slowly. 20 mins later and a few minutes of cooling i added a sweet cinnamon & maple walnut cream cheese filling and rolled it up. Delish! .. i think i peeled off parchment after it cooled? sorry i forget!

Everyone loves this!  I don't like pumpkin pie and I love this roll!  My only complaint is that mine always sticks to my towel AND cracks when I roll it.  Will try the wax paper as suggested by others next time.

Well it's in the fridge right now.  It was easy enough to follow the recipe, but I had trouble with the rolling.  LOL  I bought towels just for this, they remind me of cloth diapers but smoother surface.  I sprinkled with water, sifted some powder sugar over the towel.  It rolled up real easy.  I waited the 20 minutes to cool and when I started to unroll it, it was sticking to the towel.  Well I went ahead and spread the filling onto it and rolled it up best I could. It looks like a first timers pumpkin roll. I will try it again after reading some more of the reviews for tips.  I hope to make one that looks just like the picture one day.

The flavor of this is excellent, but the consistency of the pumpkin cake is a little spongy.  Just a personal preference thing.

USE A BIGGER PAN and wax paper! I wish I would have followed the suggestions to use a larger pan and wax paper. The cake was a little thick using the 9X13 and stuck to the pan. Other than that, I liked the recipe itself, it is not too sweet. I will try the recipe again, it was VERY easy!

This was so easy to make. The trick is to make sure you roll it in a towel while still warm so it does not fall apart when unrolling to add the filling. I sprinkled with powdered sugar but this year I will try adding icing to the top. Everyone loved this!

Very delicious but the second time around for the filling I used 3/4 cup of sugar because it came out too runny the first time. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

My favorite way to have pumpkin for dessert. I prefer this over pumpkin pie and make several of them and freeze the rest. They are just as good and thaw quickly.

Made this for years and has been a hit every time! I will continue to make it! For all those having troubles with it sticking to the pan, I line it with Parchment paper. That makes it easier to take out!

I just love this recipe!  I used a larger pan, but doubled the recipe! Instead of flipping the cake onto the towel, I coat the top of the cake with the c sugar and then place the towel on top.  Flip the whole thing and it's much easier.  My family loves this recipe and looks forward to my making it.  Enjoy!

This is the recipe my Aunt Carol uses. She hands down makes the best pumkin roll.  I never made it as hers are so good.  However when you move 500 miles away you have to rethink some things.  I have made this recipe as stated several times.  Just take your time and remember to use a fair amount of powdered sugar on your towels.  It is a family favorite!
By the way these rolls freeze wonderfully.

This pumpkin roll was amazing! Although you do have to be VERY careful when taking the pumpkin cake out of the pan- I've had it break on me a couple times. It takes a little while to make, but it is certainly worth the wait! The delectable cream cheese filling rolled between pumpkin cake not only looks pretty, but tastes incredible! I brought this to my family's thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit. I highly recommend this if you have the time and patience to do it right.

This was my first attempt at making a pumpkin roll and I was amazed at how fast and easy it was. I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice so I used a little more than a 1/2tsp. of cinnamon, ginger, cloves and nutmeg. My family thought it was the best one they had ever had. I will make this again and again.

I made two of these after the first one tasted so good.   But I will cut down on the cream cheese filling next time & cool longer.  The filling was melting the first time & there was too much of it making it hard to roll.  Both times it did break & filling came out but I just rolled anyway & scraped it off before wrapping up.

I make about 20 of these at a time with some varieties.  I follow the recipe to the note.  I use two fingers and peel 3 lines of the filling off and replace with cake and pastry filling.  Like blueberry, strawbery, etc. etc.  HUGE HIT!!!!

This was the first roll recipe I've ever made where it actually resembled a roll! Looking back, I know where I went wrong, and I think I will try using parchment next time as other reviewers suggested. I was doing really well with that damp towel, but I got too excited and damaged the roll slightly. Parchment should probably work better with my over-anxious movements. Otherwise, the icing spread well, it rolled back up well despite my minor fumbling, and after spending some quality time in the fridge, I took it out and sliced it easily. It looks more like a roll with a solid glob of cream cheese goodness in the middle instead of the nice pinwheel, but that was entirely my fault, and the flavour MORE than made up for it. It's still attractive enough that I will be slicing it up and serving it alongside the cookies in the rec room on Thanksgiving Day. However, this is the first recipe I've handled the cake part as well as I have, and practice makes perfect! And MOIST! First time I've made a roll recipe where the cake bit wasn't dry as a desert. I will be making it again!

First time i made a pumpkin roll and it turned out beautiful and delicious!! I followed the recipe, but i read some reviews and decided to use 1) parchmin paper on the bottom of the cookie sheet then oil and flour that(glad i did) and 2) i made the filling then stuck it in the fridge while the cake part was cooking!

The cake was rubbery and not at all cake like. I mixed the cake in my Bosch mixer, but I only mixed it until the dry was absorbed with the wet and really tried to not overmix it. I am a pretty seasoned baker and have had many cakes turn out great so I don't think it was human error. I did see that this recipe for the cake was quite heavy with pumpkin compared with others so I am wondering if that is the problem. I will try a different recipe next time. As far as the icing goes it was delicious and the process of rolling the cake went well also. But since the base of this dish is the cake I think it needs to hold it's own and be able to take the lime light, this cake did not cut it for us. Like another reviewer said the cake was not a bad flavor just the texture was not palatable. I made the cake exactly like the recipe stated and didn't alter it at all. I did bake the cake in an 11 x 15 inch jelly roll pan, but that should have no bearing on the texture, just the thickness.

DELISH! Use a slightly bigger pan though, so that it rolls better. Other than that there were no problems with it breaking or anything. It was very moist and tasted awesome, it was gone in one day.

YUM!! Delicious, and super easy for someone who has never made a roll before. I used one whole vanilla bean instead of extract and was very happy with the substitution.

Followed this as written. It was very enjoyable - but I think it needs a little salt in the cake batter which I will try the next time I make it. Perhaps 1/4 tsp. It becomes a very spongy, moist cake once it's sat in the fridge with the filling rolled into it for a few hours. 
I used parchement paper on the bottom of my jelly roll pan and sprayed it a little with Pam just before adding the cake batter. Worked like a charm and peeled right off.

It was pretty good, but the cake texture was different than the picture.  There was also too much filling, so I didn't use all of it.

I was trying this for the first time but used self-rising flour instead of all purpose...also used pumpkin pie mix instead of pumpkin and still put the 2tsp of pumpkin pie spice....turned out great!!I also added 1 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar instead of 1 cup to the icing....made it a little sweeter...it was a hit at my house!! Wanna try it with nuts next time!!

I like the recipe but but added another 1/2 recipe for the large jelly roll pan.  Also, I add 1 1/2 tsp lime juice to the frosting for a little tang in my cream cheese frosting.  I also like to add finely chopped walnuts before rolling up. I would also recommend using wax paper on bottom of pan or parchment paper. Overall it is an easy fun recipe.

I have seriously made over 20 of these. My family and friends absolutely love them and I am constantly getting scolded for not making enough for everyone. One is not enough for a family gathering... make at least 2 or even 3 if your family loves pumpkin!

This was so good!! The only problem I had was actually rolling it up because btoh times I tried it, it didn't want to roll perfectly. However, I am just now really learning to cook and bake (20 is about time) and so, it's probably my inexpierence. Everyone ate it anyways, though, and it was SOOOO good!

Help, any suggestions appreciated.  I too  had the problem of cake cracking.  I followed the directions to the letter. (used parchment paper on the pan) It cracked as I was unrolling it, then after spreading the frosting and re-rolling it cracked/split completely right about in the center.  I was still able to roll it up and cover in plastic wrap and slice it, taste was excellent, so I give it excellent rating.  Tried a second one and this time I put a piece of waxed paper on the dampened towel, sprinkled the powdered sugar on that and let it cool about 5 minutes longer.  Same thing.  Will definitely make it again, but would lke to make it w/o the cracks/splits so I can give it to friends. TIA for any help.

The cake is excellent. Didn't like the filling. Tasted like I was eating butter cream cheese icing. I changed the filling by swaping the butter for 8oz container of cool whip and a tspn of vanilla. 
My cake cracked so I'm in awe of all the photos of "perfect" rolls.

I decided to make this on our family thanksgiving day for the first time...i was a little worried, because i had nothing else planned, if something did go wrong....have ye faith, one should say.
This roll was so easy to make, and absolutely delicious....i did go out of the recipe a bit and added a cup of real whipping cream to the cream cheese mixture.......thank you for posting your recipe :)

The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because of how tricky it is to make. I used a 9x13 pan and the cake was too thick so it didn't cook through. I used the wax paper and the powdered sugar and didn't have any problems with sticking. Truthfully I had to throw the whole thing in the trash because it was still liquid inside the cake and too thick to roll. However I tasted the outer edge that got cooked and it was fabulous! Next time going to use a cookie sheet and see how it goes.

I have made this pumpkin roll for years now.  Everyone has loved it.  It is so simple to make.  I have had people offer me money to make this for them.  Very Yummy.

This was my first pumpkin roll and it turned out absolutely wonderful.  I made it exactly as written (ingredient-wise).  I was shocked that it didn't crack, not even one tiny bit!  I used a 16x12 jelly roll pan, lined it with parchment paper sprayed with Pam.  Baked for exactly 15 minutes & flipped it onto a damp napkin towel (the kind of linen you'd find at finer restaurants, sometimes rolled around the cutlery).  I did not sprinkle with powdered sugar as the dampness would have just melted it anyway.  I let it rest for one hour while I kept the filling chilled in the fridge.  I think the 1 hour was the key to my success in not having any cracks.  Everyone devoured it & were even fighting over it!  It was incredibly moist and delicious.  Three people even suggested I make many and sell them as they'd sell out in a heartbeat!

Thanks for a great recipe! Very easy to make and looked and tasted amazing. The filling was actually enough to fill two rolls. I will make this again and again.

This was a real hit at our house--my husband already wants to know when I will make it again.  Turned out well in spite of the fact that I did not dampen the towel.  Will be sure to do that next time and it might be a bit less messy.

Fabulous! Really easy to make and it turned out perfectly. 

I lined the pan with a Silpat and sprayed the corners with cooking spray. Then, when I took it out of the oven, I held a bar towel over the pan and flipped it and the cake came right out. Then I lifted the Silpat off the cake (with just a little effort) and rolled it in the towel. 

This recipe is a real keeper. Trader Joe's has pumpkin cream cheese during the holidays and I'll bet the filling would be extra good made with that.

Made this and it turned out wonderfully. The only thing I would change is using was paper on the pan for baking to prevent sticking. I also sprayed it with baking spray and it came out easily.  Another tip I took from another review was using a 15x11 pan which was helpful.

This turned out great but I did bake it for 20 minutes instead of 15. Also did not add the lemon juice. I had no problems rolling or unrolling but I let it cool for an hour first. The ONLY reason I gave four stars instead of five is because of the baking time needing to be extended a bit

I gave this four stars because it is really important that you read the reviews and get the extra tips from others.
1. I would definitely recommend lining your baking sheet with parchment paper or wax paper,  AND greasing the paper. 
2. When you are beginning to roll the pumpkin roll in the moist linen towel, i would definitely recommend laying a new piece of wax paper on top of the pumpkin roll before rolling. 

I used the times EXACTLY, 15 minutes in the oven, then 20 minutes to cool, and it worked perfectly. 

Great recipe, tastes wonderful!

I made this for my Fiance's son's wedding and it went over very well.  Everyone LOVED it, I hear a lot of compliments for my baking but this was the first time I ever made pumpkin roll and I had so many compliments (and nothing can feel better than compliments for food made for a wedding!)

This was very good. I used parchment paper and it came off fine. Next time I will let the filling chill before I spread and I will add raisins. I make pumpkin loaf and the raisins make it the best so will try that next time. Very good recipe thank you.

Perfect!  I was drawn to this recipe because it did not start out beating the eggs for 5 minutes like so many others.  This recipe is much simpler.  I also like that it used a full 1 cup measurement of pumpkin puree.  Every year I make homemade pumpkin puree from pie pumpkins and freeze in 1 pint (2 cup) containers.  This recipe is perfect for 2 pumpkin rolls with no left overs.  I use a 10X15 jelly roll pan lined with parchment paper.  This pumpkin roll came out perfect every time I have made it.

Made this twice now- once for turkey day and once for Christmas.  Delicious every time! My son is a HUGE cheesecake lover, but the rest of us, not so much.  This was a perfect compromise!  It has a cheesecake like filling, with a light and fluffy cake surrounding.  The cake balanced the intense filling perfectly.  My son loved it, and it went before the homemade pies!  Thanks for posting!

I love the recipe here, but I have some suggestions to add to it.     

-Don't add the lemon juice.  I'm not sure why it's in the recipe in the first place.  It reacts with the baking soda and creates air pockets in the roll, making it almost impossible to roll.     

-For me, heating it to 350 rather than 375 worked better.  The roll was a tad bit overdone when I followed the recipe verbatim the first time.  Leave it in for 13-15 minutes.  Not sure why turning it down 25 degrees helped for me.    

-Stir in the confectioners' sugar in WHILE your mixing the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla to make the icing.  The first time I used this recipe, I got to that part and became so infuriated with the cement-like mixture that I gummed up the electric mixer and resorted to mixing it with my hands.  It's still a strain on the shoulder, but it is much easier to mix the sugar in a little at a time rather than pouring everything together at once.     

I've also noticed that trimming the edges off the roll before icing and rolling makes it easier to roll it and less likely to break and fold.     

All that said, I've gotten such compliments on this roll and using this recipe.  The roll is moist and flavorful, and the icing is just perfect with it.  Also, it is pretty easy to make once you know what you need and how to do it.

I have been making this for years. I usually make at least 2 and I add pecans to the filling in one of them. The other one I leave plain for the guest who prefer it that way. Never found a person that didn't like this.

I only had pumpkin pie mix not plain canned pumpkin so I cut the sugar in half (and used half brown sugar) and left out the spices.  Everyone thought it was great. Thanks!

Delicious!  This was incredibly easy to make and tasted fantastic.  My cake roll cracked after I spread the icing and rolled it, but I sliced it ahead of time then put on a serving platter and no one noticed.  I will be making this often and not just for holidays!

This tasted really good, the only downside was that there didn't seem to be quite enough filling, it was spread pretty thin.

This log turned out great! I followed the instructions to a T. I did however tweak the filling. You can add so many different flavors, cranberry orange, carmel, carrot raisin, apple raisin,spice etc. The one I used is a secret though. Be Creative, you'll be glad you did!

HOLY WOW! This was amazing. As soon as the first piece was cut it disappeared. Everyone raved. All I can say is I followed the directions EXACTLY, and I made sure the cake was completely cool and the filling pretty cold before assembling. It was beautiful and delicious! Definitely will be making many more times.

Followed some reviewer tips and had much better success than previous attempts: used 11 x 15" pan, covered pan in wax paper and sprayed sides with non stick spray, sprinkled powdered sugar on damp towel just before flipping cooked roll onto it, sprinkled powdered sugar and placed a piece of wax paper on top of cooked rolled before rolling it, and chilled the filling before spreading it. Easier rolling due to thinner roll and no filling squeezed out. Wife loved it. Woot woot!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  Easy to make and tastes great.  Don't change a thing. Not too spicy either.  Ive had others that are way too spicy.

I wanted to like this but it just didn't taste very good.  Maybe I undercooked the cake - it was too moist.  And the cream cheese taste was really overpowering. Unfortunately nobody ate it when I made it for Thanksgiving.

Great recipe!  I had people asking for seconds and thirds!  I did have trouble getting it out of the pan, but I am going to try it with parchment paper next time and allow some cooling time.

This roll is delicious, and my whole family loved it.  I read reviews prior to making it and made sure I lined my pan with wax paper and srayed it with "baking pam".  I sugest spinkiling it with confectioners sugar after it has been rolled.  I used a larger pan and baked for only 13 minutes, no cracking and no problems.  I also used was paper undtead of a wet towel.

These tasted amazing but it was a complete flop in the rolling department. I doubled the recipe and used a very large (industrial sized) cookie sheet.  Big mistake. Next time (and there will be a next time because of the flavor) I will follow the recipe as is and not try doubling.

It worked out better if I let the cake cool for 10-15 minutes before I flip it over on to the powdered parchement paper.  Then I rolled, let it cool for 10 more minutes then put the cooled icing on.  When I didn't let it initially cool, the powder completely melted and glazed over the cake, which I guess is fine too.

Very good!!! VERY easy to make, the only thing I disliked was that my cake was very sticky on the outside which was a little messy to eat.. Probably because you roll the cake warm, which just like when you cover a cake warm, makes it sticky.

A big shout out to Valerie's Kitchen for inspiring me to try this after years of thinking about it.  Her suggestion of the parchment paper made this so easy to manipulate.  It was so good and so easy, I made it twice this weekend!  Thanks, Valerie!

My first roll dessert and it was easy! I used almond extract ( thats all I had) and it went well with the taste of the roll. Yes my roll cracked and im ok with that :) im more excited that it rolled in the first place.

Good flavor, but I must of done something wrong.  Mine was very moist.  I premade it and froze it.  When I took it out the day I was going to serve it, the roll was wet.  I vote it on the flavor of 5 stars because I think it would have turned out better if I didn't freeze.

I've made this several times with great success! I always use wax paper on pan & it comes out cleanly.  Recipe clearly states "use jelly roll pan or cookie sheet" NOT a baking pan.  Pls. read instructions BEFORE criticizing!

I just made this.  It cooled and rolled great!  I baked it after reading the reviews using parchment paper in the bottom of the pan. No trouble removing from pan or cracking when rolled. I did add some rum flavoring instead of vanilla in the filling and  1 tsp. ginger powder.  A keeper!

Delicious cake, my family loves it! I make this every year now. I didn't have vanilla recently so I used the same amount of butterscotch liqueur, it worked like a charm and was wonderful. I also add about a 1/3 cup extra pumpkin puree. I had problems with the cake sticking or cooking a bit crispy in the past, and tried cooking spray, wax paper etc. This time I just greased the pan with vegetable oil on a paper towel it didn't get crispy and i just had to help it out with the spatula a bit.

I had this at a friends house and I am pregnant and fell in love with it. So I looked up the recipe and this is my first time making it. I used the size pan it called for and did anyone have trouble with the cake coming out runny? I baked it longer and seemed to help but still had to let cool a while before rolling it in the towel. I was afraid it was gonna be like pumpkin pie texture since I used the pumpkin filling instead of the puree. overall its a hit and delicious!

Very Very Good!!!  This roll comes out very moist.  I used the parchment paper on the bottom and it did stick a little to the cake.  I think the parchment on top when you roll in towel makes the roll very moist.  The filling is very good.  I would use a little less than I made.  The suggestion to put the filling in frig. before spreading is a good idea.  It spreads nicely after refrig. not to stiff. Thanks Granny Kat for the great recipe.

Loved by all at my house :-)  Used 11x15 sheet pan and seemed as if there was not enough batter, spread as evenly as possible and worked fine. I used parchment paper but forgot to grease it, so still stuck but worked well enough, sifted powdered sugar on paper towel and rolled/cooled quite nicely. Filling was perfect in quantity and taste. Really needs to chill overnight for maximum flavor/texture.

This recipe is amazing! I recommend using the wax paper instead of the linen cloth and also 1 1/4 cup of confectioners' sugar in the frosting if you have a sweet tooth!

This turned out great!  I brought it to a football party and it got raves and many requests for the recipe. The only change that I made was adding an extra 1/4 cup of powdered sugar to the cream cheese filling.  I plan on making this again for Thanksgiving.

This recipe was amazing. Everyone at work loved it. I used a can of Pumpkin pie filling, instead of Pumpkin puree and it tasted really good. Very moist and it melted in your mouth.

Amazing!  I had made a pumpkin roll a few years ago and it was such a flop, I was scared to ever make one again.  However, my love for pumpkin rolls finally got me to try this recipe.  It was AMAZING!!!  It was easy to make and I had no problems with rolling/ cracking!  Perfect recipe!  Thank you!!

Very GOOD recipe!!!!! I couldn't believe that you could roll a cake withouth it cracking BUT you CAN!!! Made this in a larger cookie sheet so I doubled the recipe but used only half of the second batch. PERFECT.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon in each batter.

Wonderful recipe! The best pumpkinroll I have ever made. The only thing i ever do differently is reduce the confectioners sugar in the filling sometimes just because hubby doesn't like things too sweet. Thanks for a great recipe!

Cake was very moist as stated, but I felt lacked the flavor that I was looking for in other Pumpkin Rolls.    Still good enough to eat just no one raved about it.     Might try it again with more spice and more lemon zest because I loved the moistness of this cake.

Super easy & yummy!!! Only change I made was using a 11x17 pan. Next time though, I will let it cool in the fridge b/c it was just a lil warm & it made my cream cheese kinda runny.

I made this for Thanksgiving, put in the freezer & forgot about it.  I took it out for Christmas dinner. I cut it while frozen. It thawed beautifully!  The taste was delicious.  It never got soggy.  Will absolutely make this again.

This is delicious! I rolled it up in wax paper because I don't like the idea of rolling things in fabric. Rolling in wax paper does leave it a little glossy on the outside, though. I would rather roll it in something wider than a jelly roll pan because there is enough batter to do so and you could get more layers out of it that way.

I made this for a friend for Thanksgiving. She told me it was THE BEST pumpkin rool ever...she said the frosting was amazing. THANK YOU for such a great recipe. For any other newbies to 'rolling' a cake, I learned through trial and error that when you unroll the cake to frost it, make sure you roll it back up the same way it originally rolled. I rolled mine backwards and it cracked a bit...hope that helps!

I've been using the same pumpkin roll recipe for years. I decided to give this one a try for a change, and so glad I did! This is so easy and delicious. I did cut back on the white sugar for the cake mix to 3/4 cup,and used only 1/2 cup of confectioner's sugar for the filling. I used waxed paper to roll my cake rather than the damp linen towel. Thanks for the new recipe that I will use for years to come.

This was super easy and yummy. I will use a bigger pan next time so it's just a bit thinner. I added a bit more vanilla and some walnuts to the filling, but it is a great base recipe.

Sweet, simple, and finger licking good. I did use homemade pumpkin puree but other than that, no modification.

This is delectable. I did not change one thing to this recipe and it got fantastic reviews at Thanksgiving dinner. Edit-I have made this 3 times now with rave reviews. My third was the first to not break apart. The first two did but once you chill it and cut in pieces...it didn't matter.

I read the reviews and froze this as someone suggested. This seemed to make mine more mushy, and slimy on the outside. If I were to do this again, I don't think I would freeze it and just refrigerate instead. I would also put some powdered sugar on the outside just before cutting to eliminate the slime.

This was delicious!  It was the first thing gone at the Thanksgiving dessert table.  It was even pretty easy to make, just follow directions carefully.  I used wax paper to line the cookie sheet and had no problems.  This will be part of our annual dinner.

This recipe was delicious and now my family is begging me to make it again.  The only thing that I did differently is that I used parchment paper instead of greasing and flouring the pan.  I had no trouble with it sticking.  I will definitely fix this again!

Ok. So I just finished wrapping my roll and put it in the fridge to cool. I found this super easy to make, except when I unrolled it from the towel to put the icing on it, it totally broke right down the center. Not quite sure why this happened. I followed the instructions to the letter. I also noticed that it was really moist and sticky (and I'm guessing that's why it broke, because it was sticking to the towel) . I wonder how I would avoid that next time.

I was a bit skeptical about making these.  However, they turned out GREAT.  I am so suprised they didn't even crack!  I used parchment paper and followed exact directions.  If I can make these anyone can!  Thank you!

there are lots of recipes for this & the real key to them is you need the recipe with the lemon juice in it.  i have been making this for years & it is requested all the time.  i lost my recipe but yours is exactly how i made it before.  thanks for sharing.

I tried this last night and my husband loved it! I used the parchament paper as suggested by another person and it worked well, as did a jelly roll pan which made the cake thinner and easy to roll up. This was really easy to make so now I will be making this often! Thanks!!

Outstanding!  I made 2 for a Halloween party and they were gone.  I followed suggestions here about how to make the roll work - used wax paper on the bottom of the jelly roll pan and flipped it out of the pan and rolled it while it was still hot.  I then chilled the cream cheese mixture for 2 hours and let the cake cool for over an hour.  It rolled perfectly.  I will definitely be using this at my Mother-in-Law's for Thanksgiving since it is guaranteed to FINALLY impress her!

I always make this exactly as the recipe states, and it comes out perfectly.  The one trick I have learned is to line the baking sheet with PARCHMENT paper.  It works better than cooking spray or wax paper.

MUCH EASIER THAN YOU EXPECT! I would recommend anybody to try this roll. The first time I made it I had one small tear in the cake while I was rolling it up, but that's it! It's important to make sure the cake is cooled before icing it, and use wax paper on the baking sheet and also on top of the towel. I used a regular old terry towel and it never stuck (I dusted it on both sides with icing sugar). Yummy!!

Quite good, quite sweet! A 10x15 pan works, I kind of wanted it even more spread out than that, but I was skeptical. I think I'll try a bigger pan next time. 1/3 less fat cream cheese and Light Smart Balance turn out fine in the filling! I lined my pan with oiled foil and had to peel and cut it off slowly after I had flipped it onto the towel when it was done baking.

The taste of this was very good, and I got rave reviews from my coworkers, who said this pumpkin roll tastes just like the one their grandma made! That to me is one of the highest compliments. I had difficulty with rolling it up without having it crack. It wasn't the prettiest role, but the taste more than made up for it!

I have made this recipe many times and love it. Recently, I only had 1/2 cup of pumpkin so I filled the other 1/2 cup with mushed banana and it was delicious!  Some liked the pumpkin/banana roll better than the regular pumpkin roll.

These are so ummy.  It can be a little complicated to get the cake onto the powdered sugar towel, but then I stated putting wax paper over the towel.  No sugar needed, and less mess all the way around.  This are so good.  I've made them many times, and they always turn out great.  I do recommend that you make sure that your frosting is mixed well.  I use a stand up mixer, and I have to do some extra scraping one the sides to make sure that my frosting isn't lumpy.  This has become a family favorit.

Very nice pumpkin roll. So delicious - very spongy cake, with great flavor.  Not too pumpkiny or too spicy.  Just perfect. In fact, I cannot believe that I made it - it was so good.  Easy to roll.  Did not stick.  Just take your time.

I made this as written and when I took it out of the oven, noticed it was a little thick for a pumpkin roll. I rolled it up in the towel, gently, and it broke. I whipped up a second one, only I put this one in a 11x15 and it turned out wonderfully. I'd suggest using the larger pan, but making it as written other than that. 

It was a delicious! Thank you!

Made this for Thanksgiving. Was a big hit for a bunch of people who don't like pumpkin pie. Good flavor, not too overwhelmingly pumpkin. I did have some trouble getting it to roll up nicely but in the end it looked alright. I just have to work on my technique for rolling it up!

WOW, I made this prior to the holiday to test on my husband and it was so good he actually accused me of buying it and trying to pass it off as my own.  I had enough filling for 2 rolls but other than that, it was GREAT!!!

This was waaay to sweet for me.  I think that I will try a recipe that has a different filling.  The cream cheese was just to heavy.

So...wow!...just wow! I absolutely love this recipe as did everyone else who tried it!!!  I made mine gluten and dairy free by using a GF all-purpose flour and Tofutti (non-hydrogenated) cream cheese.  My oven bakes a bit hotter, so 10 minutes at 350 was perfect.  I laid parchment paper over a regular dish towel, popped the pumpkin onto the parchement, rolled it in the parchment, and then rolled the towel around THAT (to keep it all together) and the OFF TO THE FREEZER for about 30 minutes.  The filling was fantastic! Thick and tasty! This is going to be a staple!!!!! And tomorrow...pumpkin pancakes from this site! YAY!

Oh my gosh, I used fresh pumpkin to make this and I literally saw my friends light up when they took the first bite. I remember these from childhood and I found this recipe just in time for thanksgiving. You will not regret trying this recipe, it is nearly foolproof. I used a lipped cookie sheet for the cake part and let the cream cheese sit out until it was easily spreadable with a butter knife. I then put it immediately into the fridge, then into the freezer, then served a week later with no complaints whatsoever.

Everyone loves this pumpkin roll and people have actually offered to pay me to make it! I make it every fall and I always end up making it several times because everyone requests it!

I too ended up with too much leftover filling (if you add too much, the roll doesn't bake up quite right). But both the cake and filling are delicious!

MESSY! (sprinkling towel with pow. sugar) and you have to watch it closely in the oven because it is so thin, but it was a hit! I've made it two Christmases in a row because now that my Mom knows I can make it, she's absolutely addicted!

This is great, just finely chop some pecans and roll onto sides of pumpkin roll.  Also, this is definately better the next day.  The longer is sits in the fridge, the better it tastes.

Okay, I made this recipe last year for Thanksgiving, and it was a hit. My mom requested this especially for this year, and I have been looking forward to it for a couple of months. 

When I made it this year, I must have messed up somewhere (although I swear I followed the recipe exactly except for the pumpkin pie spice, which I replaced with cinnamon and nutmeg) because it was TERRIBLE. I mean, COMPLETELY INEDIBLE. 

It feel apart as soon as I took it out of the oven, and the taste just followed it down from there. It was a mess. I did rate it four stars, though, because I KNOW this is a good recipe, and I must have just messed it up.

Spectacular!  I accidentally overbaked the cake a tiny bit (didn't hear the timer), but even with a little too much browning, the pumpkin roll was great & I highly recommend this recipe.

I've been making this recipe for years and I always get great compliments.  I always make 2 at a time and freeze one. I recently made a couple changes...I use a 10x15 jelly roll pan and roll cake from the short end.  You get a better pinwheel effect so it looks impressive.  My 4 year old daughter prefers this to pumpkin pie!

This was awesome. Followed recipe almost exactly as written. I was scared about rolling in the dish towel so I rolled in wax paper sprinkled with powdered sugar instead. Make sure to grease your cookie sheet generously and you shouldn't have any problems with cake sticking. Try it, it is not as hard as it seems!

I tried this exactly as printed. But I think the pan size was wrong. I used the 9x13 and it was a disaster! Then I tried again using a 15x10 and it was perfect. I probably won't make it again as it was too time consuming with kids in the house.

I would give this a 3 and half stars, it is very easy and beautiful presentation.  However I would have liked a less dense cake.  I tried this recipe twice, even opened up some fresh baking soda,just in case, but even then the cake was very dense and too moist. Filling is very good.

This was easy to make and the presentation was great, but it wasn't a big hit with me. I didn't really like the cream cheese filling. With that said, other people liked it enough to ask for the recipe, so perhaps it's just me.

This was not exactly what I was expecting.  I wanted a more cake like Roll.  I thought the taste was good and I didn't have the correct size pan so it was a little on the thin side but I don't know if making it in a smaller size pan is really the issue here.  It could be and I have to decide if I'm going to give it another try or use a different recipe next time.

very pretty and relatively easy to make.  i used parchment paper on bottom of pan which made it super easy to flip out.  then rolled up and put in fridge for an hour.  i cooled the filling for a bit but it still came out a little as i was rolling it.  i also ended up with a lot of leftover filling... so i will be making another one soon!

I hate to be in the minority here.  While this cake had good flavor,  the texture was much to pie like fo me.  I was looking for more of a cake roll.  I knew something was not right  during mixing, it was much to thick and moist looking.  If your looking for a pumpkin roll that's very dense and pie like - this is for you.  if you want more of a cake texture, keep looking.

Absolutely awesome in flavor!
I will try the wax paper next time. Mine stuck to the towel also. 
It was easy to make. I made 3 rolls all at once & froze them.
Excellent!

This recipe was so hard to work with. The cream cheese mixture was runny - even after adding twice as much powdered sugar to try and thicken it and refrigerating the roll overnight. It did not slice well. It tasted good however.

Best pumpkin roll ever. I can't tell you how many times I have made this. It is very simple to make. I line my pan with waxed paper and it comes out great.

Didn't turn out because the pumpkin bread stuck to my damp towel - use lots of powdered sugar!  However, my husband and I enjoyed eating the mess.  Excellent flavor!

This was FABULOUS!  Let me say that I am definitely NOT a great cook.  But my husband requested a pumpkin roll for Thanksgiving, and I decided to try my best.  The results?  He said it was the best he had ever eaten.  Woo hoo!  The ONLY change I made was a smidge less powdered sugar (almost a cup, but not quite).  This recipe is perfect AS IS!

The cake ends up too moist in this recipe, so when you unroll the cake to frost it, it breaks. I would suggest using less pumpkin, maybe 3/4 of a can instead of the whole thing.

I've had this in my recipe box here for 3 years and finally worked up the courage to try it...SO sorry I waited so long!! LOVED this! Beautiful, different, and incredibly moist and tasty! Followed others' suggn's and used parchment paper when baking/rolling - a little stressful while making, as timing is important, but the upside is, it's over and done with fairly quickly, once the cake cools. Can't wait to make again!

I liked this recipe except that I thought that the filling was way too sweet...it really is more like a frosting.  The cake part was great though and not hard to put together.  I think that I will try it again but use a different filling...maybe something like a whipped cream with brandy and crystalized ginger. I did put chopped nuts in the filling and it was a nice add.

LOVE the recipe but made three changes: I used 1 cup flour for a fluffier cake, I like the 9x13 pan for thicker cake slices.  I like to roll the cake from the short end, makes a smaller roll but fatter slices, and I put 1 cup coarsly chopped pecans or walnuts over the frosting before re-rolling.  It has become my signature dessert and I get rave reviews all year long!

This pumpkin roll is super yummy and not that difficult to make.  I made it for Thanksgiving and the family loved it.  Then I made it for a bake sale at my company - sold out and got orders for 10 more!  Definitely give it a try :)

This recipe is absolutely delicious and a snap to make! Don't let the directions scare you- the cake is moist and is easily removed from the pan. The final product is amazing. Everyone that tastes it asks for the recipe and there is never any leftovers!

I followed this recipe nearly to a T (just subbed non-animal ingredients to make vegan) and it came out...squishy.  Maybe I should have baked for 20 minutes?  I will definately try to make again...but now I have a pumpkin-y, floppy log in my freezer :(

I'm not sure what I did wrong but I was very disappointed with the outcome of this recipe. There seemed to be way too much filling oozing out of every crevice; I will try using about 1/2 next time. Also, I lined the pan with wax paper as suggested by others and the cake stuck to the paper; perhaps I was to grease the paper? And finally, the cake took at least 20 minutes to cook rather than 15; did this happen to anyone else? My oven is normally too hot.  The final result was a great tasting, unattractive, messy roll. I blame myself, as I am a novel baker.

I just made this for a trial run before Thanksgiving. The flavor is ok, not great. This recipe is not very sweet and somewant on the bland side. I could see why people add walnuts, I think that would help the taste. I would make this again but probably not for a special occasion. If you are new to jelly rolls don't let this recipe fool you. Don't use a 9x13 but a jelly roll pan instead. It will be much easier to work with.

Tried it out as a possible Thanksgiving contender. This was pretty easy to make (I didn't grease my pan quite enough...will do that more thoroughly next time!) and REALLY good...the kids and my DH ate half of it immediately...before it was even good and cold! My son wants it for Thanksgiving dessert, and I plan on making it! :)

Wonderful!!  Better than any other pumpkin roll I've had. I used Cheesecake flavored cream cheese instead of regular.  I also had pumpkin pie mix instead of puree.  I used some of the pumpkin mix in the cream cheese filling.  Excellent.  Am making 4 of them for Thanksgiving for myself and friends.

This was excellent.  The cake was fluffy and had great flavor.  I added about 3/4 cup of chopped pecans to the icing, and it worked very well.  Great recipe!

I followed this recipe to the T.  It was a good recipe overall, although the icing was not of a creamy texture for me.  If I make this recipe again I will add walnuts and most definitely double the icing.

This recipe was wonderful, and talk about quick...I met my husband to pick up some of the ingredients at the supermarket and we got home probably near 5 p.m., this was ready and being eaten by around 6:30, and that included dinner in that time period! Awesome!

I've seen these made at potlucks and always thought it would be very difficult. I tryed Granny Kat's pumpkin roll and how easy and so good. It's time consuming but well worth it.

This dessert was ok.  I wasn't crazy about the cream cheese filling.  It was a bit too twangy. But pumpkin bread part was great and the roll looked cute.

This cake was far easier to prepare than it sounds... it was thin enough to roll fairly easily. The filling was delicious, and the presentation was handsome. I did add a bit of cinnamon and some nutmeg to the cake batter, as I like a spicier pumpkin cake, but I am sure it would have been great without this addition. I have already been asked to prepare this again, and have given out the recipe to a cousin. It received many compliments!!

I get nothing but great reviews when I make this recipe.  I think it is excellent!  If there was one thing I would critisize, it would be that it seems to always crack when I roll it up with the cream cheese filling.  However!  Don't let that deter you from making this wonderful treat!

Granny Kat certainly new a good thing when she tasted one!  These pumpkin rolls have just the perfect combination of density and cake-like texture.  They may take a little extra time and love to make, but my family raved over how good this recipe was.  I will certainly be using this again during the holidays.

This was really good! I brought these to work and everyone loved them. The only changes I made wereâ¦ instead of using âAllSpiceâ I used the equivalent amounts of Cinnamon, Cloves, and Ginger as well as I added a half-teaspoon of Nutmeg. I hate cream cheese so I substituted plain vanilla frosting for the middle. YUM and not so hard to make!

I made this for thanksgiving after a special request from my mom.  She didn't think she would be getting it this year from the same person she normally does.  As it turns out she got both and mine "won" the comparison hands down!!  It was so moist and so easy to make. It was great!!!  Thanks

A friend makes this every year and gives it out wrapped first in waxed paper and then in colored cellophane.  I look forward to it every year!  It is really good on cold mornings with a cup of cappuccino.

Made several of these for a fall festival, sold out every day! My two year old loved them along with everyone else.
