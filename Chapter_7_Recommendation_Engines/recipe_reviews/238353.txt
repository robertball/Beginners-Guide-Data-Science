Super simple recipe. I really like the tang of the lemon juice, but it's not overpowering, even though I added extra lemon juice. I scaled this way down because I was only making it for a few people. Note: make more than you think you'll need. Not only is it delicious, but the mushrooms shrink down some and you end up with very tiny portions. For example, I scaled it down for 6 servings, and it was really more like 3-4 small servings. Also, when you toss everything together, it doesn't look like there's enough liquid, but as the mushrooms sit, they really release their juices and you'll end up with plenty. I will be making this often, especially when I have extra parlsey on hand that I don't know what to do with. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was just great. Hubby said he wanted salmon and salad for dinner and I thought I might vary things up a bit so I made this. A huge hit. I didn't have any parsley as my herb garden was killed so I threw in some dried dill instead. Was debating adding balsamic dressing, might try that next time instead of lemon but this was delish just as it was.

Delicious but way too salty.  I suggest starting with half the salt then tasting and adding small amounts as necessary.  If you've already overdone  the salt, try adding more lemon juice to balance it out.

Fast and easy to make and best of all... delicious!  This is a perfect small side that has great flavors from the lemon and garlic that pair well with the mushrooms.

Not what I expected. I decided to put it over a salad and it was better. I will try it again with a few modifications.

I meant to add that it's delicious as written, and with a few variations.  I like to use a flavoured olive oil...typically I use one that spices it up a bit with chili flakes.  The longer it sits the better it tastes, but it's hard to wait sometimes!
