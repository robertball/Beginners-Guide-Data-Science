This recipe is amazing.  I used a white cake mix instead since that always reminds me of coconut cake.  I also used coconut buttercream icing instead.  1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup shortening, coconut flavoring, 1 lb powdered sugar, 2 or 3 TBS milk, and 2 cups coconut.  It was so yummy.  A HUGE hit on Easter!

This cake was great! I didn't even notice until after I put the cake in the oven that the cake mix I purchased already had pudding in it, and subsequently the cake required almost 45 minutes to bake. It turned out fine, though. I toasted some coconut in the oven for the topping. Will definitely make this again!

Oh my gosh!!! This cake is wonderful. I took a couple of you alls suggestions and made a 9 inch 2 layer. It was very pretty and scrumptous. I added chopped candied pecans in place of the walnuts and made a little extra frosting because we are frosting freaks. Will definately make again and again!

Delicious!  I made the cake as recommended with the exception of nuts.  It was terrific, very moist.  I made one cake with the frosting recommended and toasted coconut - great.  I made another batch as pinapple upside down cupcakes and they were so good that they didn't last the evening.  I melted 1/2 tablespoon butter in bottom of cupcake tins, added some brown sugar to melted butter, put pinapple ring in bottom with cherry in center, cake batter on top.  After cooking (25-30 min) I flipped them immediately onto wax paper then placed them on a plate.  Beautiful and delicious!  Each cupcake is a great individual serving but everyone took more than just one!!!!  Enjoy!

Great cake, Diane!  I exchanged the veg.oil with the cream of coconut.  I stuck with the yellow mix as I don't care for white cake.  Used Pecans instead of the walnuts, and used coconut pudding instead of the vanilla. Shredded the coconut up fine.  For the frosting I used my own made up recipe as the one here would have been too sweet for my family.  I bought instant coconut pudding and 8 oz of cream cheese. Mixed together and spread on cake.  Put a thin layer of cool whip on top of the pudding mix and topped it off by adding toasted coconut on top.  Had never toasted coconut before.  So good that way.  Easy-just put in oven for a few minutes.  Keep an eye out as they brown up very quickly.

I made this cake for Easter and though It is Easter eve as of now I have to say I tasted it and it was great! The icing is awesome, and I would make it again anyday.  While I was getting it all together I had serious doubts.  1)The coconut was really greasy, so maybe I would toast the coconut in the oven and avoid all that butter.  2) While icing the cake it looked really messy and I thought at some point that it tastes very good but doesn't give a nice appearance but once I was finished making things look nice, and sprinkling the coconut on top, it really came together great and it tasted great as well.  So I would definetly make this cake.
So if while making this cake you think that your doing it wrong or that it was a bad choice, stick it out and you'll see that this cake is great!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday, and he was thrilled!  He LOVES coconut, and LOVED this cake!  It gets better and better in the fridge, too.  The only thing I would change is that I'd chop the coconut a bit before stirring it into the cake batter...  some of the pieces were a little long and stringy when you picked up a bite with your fork!  It was excellent though, and I'll definitely make it again.

Absolutely, insanely good!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I baked it in 2 9" rounds.  It was so moist and flavorful, and got raves from my guests.

I substituted a dark chocolate cake mix, and chocolate pudding for this recipe. I also used cream of coconut (found in Ethnic or liquor dept. of store) in place of veg. oil.  Finally, I added coconut extract instead of vanilla to the recipe. This was so rich, so flavorful and sinful!  My family loved every bite and it disappeared in record time!

made this cake for my mom's birthday who loves coconut and it got rave reviews from all the guests. even my brother who is not a big fan of coconut said it was awesome. I did take the advice of other posters to use cream of coconut instead of the oil. I also put 2 tablespoons cream of coconut in the frosting.

Cake recipe is AWESOME.  Made it for Father in Law for FAther's day (favorite cake, no pressure) and it is as moist as everyone says.  I took the advice of subbing coconut milk for some of the water (1 c. coco milk; 1/3 c. water) and it came out beautifully fluffy and moist.  Wow.  This one is a keeper!  Now, onto the frosting: for those of you traditionalists who need a 7-minute frosting on a coconut cake...i hate to tell you that this cream cheese frosting pairs beautifully with the coconut cake.   this is a total keeper.  I think my father in law will want this every year.

I made this for my mom's birthday, and with the following changes it turned out excellent! For the batter, I omitted nuts and chopped the coconut finely.  Then I split the two 9 inch cakes into 4 layers and filled it with the pineapple topping recipe also from this site.  For the frosting, It would have been way too sweet for my asian tastebuds, and so I used 1 8 oz package of cream cheese and only 3/4 cup sugar!  YES, it might sound like too little but the cake itself is already extremely sweet.  After frosting the cake, I toasted 2 cups of coconut and smothered the entire cake with it so it looked like one big toasted snowball.  The flavor was out of this world.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I make this with just a couple of changes; I omit the nuts and add seedless rasberry jam as a filling. I have made it as both a sheetcake and as 9" round layers. Just split the cake, spread with a small jar of rasberry jam, and frost as usual. I get requests for this recipe every single time I make it. So easy and so delicious!

This cake is amazing!!  I made exactly as listed the first time and the next time I used pecans instead of walnuts.  Both were simple wonderful.  I make it every year for Christmas and for my mother-in-laws birthday.  It is her favorite cake.

This cake was DELICIOUS.  I used the 4 egg yellow cake recipe from this site and then added the pudding mix + 1/4 C. of cream of coconut.  I put the coconut into the food processor so it was in smaller flakes and chopped the walnuts so they weren't in huge pieces.  The cake had a wonderful flavor (the nuts were awesome) even though it wasn't very coconutty.  I had plenty to make 3 decent sized layers.  For the frosting, I doubled the recipe (and had some extra left over).  I added about 4 Tbsp. of cream of coconut to the recipe and used around 1 1/2 C. less of sugar and still found it to be a bit too sweet, although it was so so so so good.  I also food processed the coconut that went into the frosting so it wasn't so lumpy.  I topped the cake with the toasted coconut and additional chopped walnuts which was perfect.  Everyone loved this cake at Easter I am pretty sure I would make this again!

I used this recipe to make about 22 standard size cupcakes and they were fluffy and moist. I did think it tasted mostly like yellow cake, even after adding coconut pudding (instead of vanilla) and coconut extract to the icing. I'll be making this again, and will try white cake mix instead of the yellow. Overall, this is a good recipe. Easy to throw together, and wonderfully moist.

This cake took about 45 minutes to bake in my oven. After reading other reviews, I too toasted my coconut topping in the oven and it turned out great. My cake mix also had a cup of pudding in the mix and I added the box of pudding as called for in the recipe and the cake turned out very moist. I used pecans rather than walnuts as a personal preference. The cake went over very well at my family Easter dinner and everyone loved it. It has a lot of coconut flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is now a staple in my collection!!! I use about half af the coconut in the cake and icing and instead add about a cup of pineapple. It makes for a great pina colada flavor.

DELICIOUS! I used my mom's from scratch yellow cake recipe instead of a mix, but I kept everything else the same incl. adding the pudding. I made a 2 layer cake instead of a 9x13. It was moist and had so much flavor! I was worried that a cream cheese frosting would be overpowering on a yellow cake but it was perfect! This is the only coconut cake recipe I need!!!

This is also known as "Rave Reviews Coconut Cake" and is a family favorite. We had it for my grandmother's 76th birthday 2 days ago. (This is the ONLY cake she has requested for decades...) There were only 1-2 slices left and we were celebrating 3 birthdays with 3 different cakes. This is an incredible cake.

I made this tempting cake, and it turned out amazingly moist, delicious, and coconutty!  I used chocolate pudding and cake mix, like another review said, and it turned out great!  I also used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil ... not sure how much that did, but it's a great substitution!  I didn't add nuts because of personal taste, but I'm sure if you like nuts they would be great.  I look forward to making this again ... Thanks for the great recipe!

The cake itself is amazing!  I substituted macadamia nuts for walnuts.  The frosting was barely enough for a two layer cake, so I would recommend increasing the frosting by half.  Also, the cream cheese flavoring was muted.  I would increase the cream cheese next time as well.  However, even though the frosting needed tweaking, the cake is worth more than 5 stars!

Made this cake this morning for Easter dessert. Was very easy and looks and smells delicious. Made 2  9" rounds instead of 9x13. Followed the recipe exactly except I replaced coconut extract for vanilla, and used white cake mix. I added an additional 4 oz of cream cheese to frosting mix as we like frosting and I thought it would cut down on the sweetness. This worked well for me.Set this aside for my top cover of frosting. I took the other 4 oz of cream cheese and whipped it up with 1 tbl. of melted butter and one pkg of vanilla instant pudding, added tsp or so of milk to get texture I wanted and threw in about 1/2 cup coconut. This I used between my layers before frosting top. Wanted to use coconut pudding..but I had none. This worked well also. Gtreat cake! Will definately keep in my recipe box.

Best cake I've ever made / had... I cook a lot, but I don't bake much so I was worried about making a good enough cake for my husband's birthday. I used some of the modifications suggested by others -- white cake mix instead of yellow, coconut pudding instead of vanilla, coconut extract instead of vanilla, chopping up the coconut in a food processor before adding it to the cake mix and frosting -- and I omitted the walnuts and toasted the coconut without the butter. I used 2 9-in round pans and I think I baked it a little longer (perhaps because the cake mix already had pudding in the mix). But it was soooo moist and heavenly and delicious. He and I both loved it, as well as my coworkers who I took pieces too. I'll definitely make this again.

Made these as cupcakes for a tea party. But omitted the walnuts due to allergies. Didn't use the frosting listed, instead I cheated and used a can of French Vanilla from Betty Crocker and whipped it with a package of cream cheese and spinkled with the toasted coconut. EXCELLENT! This recipe was so good that even coconut haters loved it! People couldn't believe that this was a box recipe. P.S. Do NOT toast the coconut with butter. You don't need anything added into the pan to toast, just keep moving the coconut so it doesn't burn. Great recipe.. a must try. :)

One of my guests has a walnut allergy, so I substituted macadamia nuts. YUM! My husband said he couldn't imagine a better cake!

WOW! WOW! WOW! WOW! WOW!  My new favorite cake.  I added 2 tsp coconut extract to the cake batter and left out the walnuts.  Do not just toast the coconut in the oven.  Browning it in the butter makes a difference.  This is worth 20 stars!

Excellent cake, very moist!  The only problem is the frosting recipe is way too little for a 3-layer cake.  I added a cube of butter, another cup of powdered sugar, 3/4 tsp vanilla and 1 Tbl of milk.  The frosting tasted better and covered the whole cake.

I made this cake for my sister's birthday since she requested a coconut cake, and everyone liked it!  It was a bit too sweet though, so make sure you cute small slices.  However, it'd be a mess to try to cut small slices because the cake was so soft and crumbly.  The frosting was delicious as well.  I made the cake using two round pans.  I will try to do cupcakes with this and leave the coconut out of the frosting and just top it with the roasted coconut.  Delicious with a glass of cold milk!

just finished frosting this.  if the batter and the frosting tastes are any indication this is going to be awesome.  i'm made it for my hubby's nana's birthday so i hope it's great.  i was worried a couple times b/c the frosting looked funny and the browned coconut looked oily but i kept on and it turned out beautiful!  i couldn't find coconut oil so i used canola and instead of milk i substituted coconut milk in the cake and the frosting.  thanks for a great recipe!

Really disliked this recipe.  The coconut and yellow cake do not mesh well, and the frosting was awful.  Tasted like sweet cream cheese.  Would not recommend this recipe.

I substituted cream of coconut for the vegetable oil, used store-bought cream cheese frosting, and spread a layer of seedless raspberry jam in the middle.  The flavor was delicious.  Perfectly coconuty.  However, my toothpick kept coming out sticky and I let it bake a lot longer than the recipe calls for.  In the end, when the toothpick finally came out clean, the cake was a bit on the dry side.  Also, the coconut shreds do make the cake a bit crumby.  Tastes good but lacks moisture.

This cake is GREAT! Everyone loved it! I followed the directions exactly. As with most boxed cake mixes, it was better the next day. So I made it the day before the party so it would be perfect....and it was!

My mother loves coconut cake, so I thought I would try this recipe since time was running low.  I used white cake mix instead of yellow to make it look more what we are accustomed coconut cakes to look like.  I also just used egg whites.  I left out the nuts, but think next time I might try them.  I used the coconut milk in place of the oil as others suggested, and put some in the frosting also.  Well, it was a huge hit, everyone raved about it, and my mother was so pleased.

This was a very moist and flavorful cake.  For the cake itself: I substituted French Vanilla cake mix for Yellow and Coconut Cream Pudding for Vanilla pudding.  For the frosting: I substituted Coco extract for Vanilla extract.  I also did not want a very sweet cake, so I cut down to 1/2 cup of confectioner's sugar and added some whipping cream.  The cream didn't come out very stiff so it kind of made the frosting a bit runny, I had to put it in the fridge for a bit to become thicker.  Because of the frosting it wasn't a very pretty cake, but it did make up for it in flavor and was a big hit at last night's dinner.

I think I messed this up - I left out the pudding mix because the cake mix had pudding in it and the cake was entirely too crumbly.  It tasted delicious though.  I'll try it again for sure.

I have been trying coconut cake recipes every Christmas for years, and this one was my favorite.  I'll never look again!  I used a white cake mix which I thought looked pretty, and I also used cream of coconut instead of the vegetable oil.  I like to put a little cream of coconut in the frosting, too, just for extra flavor.  Let me tell you, my mother-in-law is the Christmas Cake Queen of all time, but this coconut cake was consumed in no time even with her cakes around!  I was very pleased!  I plan to make this at Easter and whenever I have an occasion for a cake.  Thanks for a terrific recipe that reminds me so much of my grandmother's!!!

I made this cake for thanksgiving and my family absolutely loved it. It did taste good but I had some trouble with it. The texture of the cake itself was weird and it was very hard to slice. I couldn't figure out why for the life of me but then I remembered that the cake mix I bought said it had a full cup of pudding already in the mix. I added the additional box of pudding on top of that so I'm sure this accounts for the sticky cake. As for the frosting, I just couldn't get it to set up. It was too soft to frost the cake.  I make cream chesse frosting all the time and this is the first time I've ever had this happen.  I ended up adding a LOT more confectioners sugar and chilling the frosting overnight.  After doing that, I was able to frost the cake but the frosting was still so soft that it kept sliding off the sides of the cake.  I finally sprinkled the enitre surface with toasted coconut and that stopped it.  I still don't know what happened - coult it have been the weather? I live down south and it was really hot that day with thunderstorms.  I'm going to try this one again because it really is yummy.

Can a cake disappear in 60 seconds flat? It can if it's this one and you take it to work! I followed the recipe exactly, except to brown the coconut I just spread it on a cookie sheet and baked it in the oven for a few minutes, a little less hassle, but be sure to watch your coconut if you do that because it can burn quickly!

Fabulous cake!  I made it as a 3 layer (9" round) and it is absolutely yummy and pretty!  All I had on hand was white cake mix so I used it.  It was a stretch to properly ice in between each layer and the sides/top with the suggested amount...I had to make another 1/2 batch of icing.  Also had to use some common sense with the icing...it was to thick to spread (it began pulling up on the cake) so I thinned it out with more milk and voila-it spread just fine.  This recipe is a keeper!

This cake was heavenly.  I am a true coconut lover, and this fit the bill.  I added a little coconut extract to the batter.  The cream cheese frosting is so yummy, my 8 yr. old couldn't keep her fingers out of it!  I baked mine in a bundt pan, and put the frosting in a ziplock bag, and piped it on, it was beautiful as well as delicious.

This cake is fab-u-lous!!!  I was asked to bring a dessert at the last minute for Easter dinner and I was able to whip this up in about an hour!  I used lemon cake instead of yellow cake, and I didn't put the coconut in the cake mix, only in the frosting.  Everyone loved it!

I get rave reviews when I make this cake. It's really moist and sweet. I kind of feel like I'm 'cheating' by using a cake mix, but because of that simplicity my 11 year old daughter is able to make it completely on her own. My husband is constantly asking her to make it.

I made this recipe and I made a few subtle changes just based on my own preferences.  I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts.  In the frosting I didn't cook the coconut in the butter (so I omitted the 2 tablespoons called for there) I just toasted the coconut in the oven and used it to top the cake once it was frosted.  Also in the frosting it calls for the butter to be melted then creamed with the cream cheese instead I just let the butter soften then toss it into my food processor with the cream cheese.  It was a delicious frosting and cake I will totally make it again.

I used this recipe for the frosting only. I gave it just four stars because I didn't love the coconut browned with sugar - it was too moist. So, I did that part over by simply browning the coconut on a baking sheet in the oven. I made cupcakes from a box mix and evev with lots of frosting on all 24 cupcakes I had leftover!  Delish  and very easy.

Delicious! I agree with others that, aside from the coconut pieces, the cake itself did not taste very coconut-ty, but I thought it was moist and delicious just the same. I made a two layer 9" round cake and only baked it for 24 minutes. Also, I added 1.5 cups of powdered sugar and 2 T butter to the frosting to get a little more and make it more of a cross between cream cheese and buttercream frosting.

This cake is amazing! The only thing that I changed was I used white cake mix and to add a little extra flavor to my cake I added a can of crushed pineapple. Just make sure you drain the juice out of the pineapple. Love love love this and will make it again!

I'm not a baker but was inspired by an episode of Throw Down. This cake looked right up my alley and it was delicious. I used a white cake but the vanilla pudding turned it yellow anyway. Shared with friends and family and already have requests for another one. Doubled the icing! Yummy.

Made this cake yesterday and it was fantastic. My husband is still raving about it being the best cake he ever had. Just wondering why the picture shows a round layer cake but the recipe calls for a 9" x 12".

I was slightly disappointed in this cake. I followed some suggestions from other reviews. It was not full of coconut flavor despite all of the coconut used! I made this cake in to a bunny cake- how to video on this site- so it was covered in coconut, plus coconut in the frosting and coconut in the actual cake. It was also quite crumbly and fell apart once it was cut. It did, however, stay together when I was frosting and decorating it. I almost didn't want to cut into because it looked better as a bunny! Over all it's an easy recipe and good, but needs some improvements.

This cake was awful for me! I followed exactly and after 30 mins the top was browning but the middle was still mushy! Baked longer and had to cover w/foil to prevent the top from burning. The taste of the cake was bland. Too much hassle for a mediocre tasting cake. The frosting is also WAY too sweet. Sorry

This cake is so moist and wonderful. I found the frosting a bit sweet for my tastes but that may be because the coconut was sweetened. Highly recomend.

I did not follow the recipe exactly- and perhaps should not rate this- but it was DELICIOUS! Minimal changes I made- I used coconut flavored instant pudding along with a dark chocolate cake mix. The toasted coconut gave the overall flavor such a unique taste and texture- for all coconut lovers- this recipe is divine. I made this for my significant other for his birthday and he loved it (coconut fiend).

I followed the directions exactly, cake came out great but there was trouble cutting it. I was a little crumbly but still very moist. Overall,it would have gotten five stars if it didn't fall apart so easily.

I have looked for a really good coconut cake for a long time, and i finally found one here. The cake was moist and delicious, but the frosting (which I substituted cocnut extract instead of the vanilla)was to die for!!! So Yummy. You could eat the frosting all by itself.  My family loved this cake and especially frosting. This is our new favorite cake.

I made this for Easter dinner and it received great reviews.  I toasted all the coconut used in the frosting and used just half the sugar (it is plenty sweet).  I added 1/2 cup crushed pineapple to the batter, and used cream of coconut instead of the oil.  I baked in 2 9" pans and just frosted in between the layers and on top, adding cherries for decoration.  This cake is yummy and very moist, but VERY sweet!

There are several steps involved, but the instructions are well written and easy to follow. It's the first time I've ever browned coconut, and not only is it attractive on the cake, it tastes wonderful. My wife couldn't believe how good it was. She said she would be getting up in the middle of the night for more. I am not a big cake fan, but if all cakes were this good, I might change my cake tune.

Made it 9 x 13. It is very light and airy so a little hard to cut, tends to fall apart. But,....it is delicious, a real hit with the family so will definately make again. Needs to bake longer than recipe states. If you are a coconut fan, this is your cake.

This is really an awesome cake!  So many people ask for the recipe when I bring it to events.  It is very moist and tastes delicious! I usually use a white cake mix, just because I like the flavor a bit better, but really I have not changed a thing on the recipe other than that.  If you like coconut, this is fab!!

I get rave reviews every time I make this cake, but I exclude the walnuts and use half a box of vanilla instant pudding and half a box of coconut creme instant pudding plus 1 tsp of coconut extract.  For the frosting, I use a 7-minute frosting made of egg whites and sugar and then sprinkle 2 cups Baker's Coconut on top of the cake.

I made exactly as directed, except I used 2 round cake pans instead of the 9x13, and my family RAVED about this cake. My mom is making it for a potluck this week. This cake is definitely sticky-sweet and for coconut lovers only, but that describes my whole family, so it was a hit!

This is a good recipe, nice and easy. I Made the bunny cake as seen on a video on this website with the toasted coconut and marshmallows, it was perfect. I didnt put the nuts in the cake mix and I also used shredded coconut instead of flaked and everyone really liked it.

I think 4 minutes is way too long to mix the batter. My cake turned out a little tougher than I would have liked. But it's no matter. My roommate still said it was the best cake she'd ever had! The toasted coconut is SO pretty, and the texture is great, too!

It was okay, but you should chop the walnuts up fine, I didn't and my cake fell apart.  Also, personal preference it seems like it would be better with the addition of some pineapple.

I'm not a fan of coconut but this is one cake even I could eat.  Very good.  I get LOTS of kudos from anyone who tastes it.  I do make a few changes though.  I use 1/2 vanilla pudding mix and 1/2 coconut pudding mix.  I also add coconut extract.

This cake was very easy to make and everyone at work loved it.  IN fact, I am making a chocolate version this week for another co-worker's birthday.  I a scant tablespoon of butter to saute the coconut and then finished by briefly toasting it in the toaster oven.

Ack!  Too sweet for our taste.  Hubby who has a real sweet tooth only ate 1 slice.  We ended up throwing it out.  If you make this be prepared, the frosting will make your teeth ache it's so sugary.

This cake was ok.  I had to bake it alot longer than 30 minutes becaue it was still jigly in the middle.  It was very moist, but at the same time it was crumbly.  The best part was the toasted coconut.  I probably won't make this again.

My suggestions: 1)Make sure your coconut is finely shredded and not flaked; otherwise, the cake will have to be chewed rather than melt in your mouth. 2)The coconut cream: I live in a metropolitan area and could not find it at 'upscale' or 'co-op' markets, but found two brands for less than a dollar a can in the imported ethnic food aisle of a big box market. 3)I tried a suggestion posted below and used seedless raspberry jam as the filling between the layers and wouldn't do it again.  It is an odd taste combination with the coconut and it soaked into the layers - no different than it would into white bread had I stopped to think about it - instead of remaining as a visible separator between the layers. This was my first attempt at a coconut cake. Not the bliss I was searching for but it may have been my inexperience and the substitutions I tried.

AWESOME!  This recipe is great and very easy.  We ate the entire cake between 8 people in one sitting ... couldn't get enough.  The only thing I did differently was I used lite Cool Whip for the frosting with the coconut on top.  I didn't have the cream cheese on hand.  The cake was moist and delicious.  I would highly recommend it!

Ok everyone...here is the scoop...this is THE BEST CAKE EVER!  I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday.  She likes chocolate cake so, I used a chocolate cake mix and chocolate pudding.  It was absolutely fabulous.  So, I decided to try it with the white cake mix~~~~not as great, but still wonderful!  My advice?  Don't use fat free or light cream cheese, makes the icing way too soft and runny.  My brother tasted this today (he doesn't like coconut) and he loved it!  Changed his mind about coconut.  This is the BEST cake ever!  I highly recommend this to everyone!

This was fabulous. I followed the advice of others and used cream of coconut in place of the oil, and also added some to the frosting. I omitted the coconut from the frosting, but topped the cake w/toasted coconut. I was tempted to use untoasted coconut to have a white cake. I'm glad I resisted temptation and toasted it first - what a fantastic difference it makes! I made this in two 9-inch rounds, and the cake traveled very well. It was also great a few days later - wish we still had some left!

This was very moist!  The only thing I'd change would be to put less coconut in the frosting.  It was almost too coconut-ty.

This was very easy to make, and my whole family loved it. My DH said that he liked it even though he doesn't like coconut cake,  and my mother and my sister-in-law said it was the best they had ever eaten!
One note, though...my cake took a little longer to cook. It was still jiggly in the middle after 30 minutes. I just watched it until it was done, and it was still nice and moist, even though it was browned on top :)! HIGHLY recommend this recipe!

This is a super fast and very easy cake to make...15 minutes from pantry to oven. Caution - this is one big sucker and will easily serve many people. I toasted the coconut for the topping as it adds to the appeal. My husband had 2 pieces and said that the frosting is the best part. Me....I had 1 as it had a bit too much frosting for my liking. Oh...I used pecans instead of walnuts. Thanks for the recipe.

I served this after Easter dinner yesterday. My husband, his parents, and I swooned over it. It was extremely rich, moist, and delicious. I have never baked anything that good. I made it with two round pans and it was gorgeous that way--very nice presentation on the side table. However, my two boys aged 4 and 6 didn't really like it. Maybe it's more of an adult dessert or maybe they had had enough Easter sweets already . . .?

I made this following the directions to the letter.  Because the recipe doesn't specify whether the coconut flakes are to be sweetened or unsweetened, I used both.  I ran sweetened coconut flakes through the food processor to get a finer consistency and then added them to the cake batter as directed.  For the toasted coconut and coconut added to the icing, I used 'shredded' unsweetened coconut.  I make coconut cake for my husband's birthday every year and this recipe is his favorite.  It always is a hit with guests too and our son, who is not a big coconut fan because of the texture of coconut, likes this one too.  It is a lovely presentation and looks beautiful as a 13x9 or round layer cake.

We loved this cake. I don't usually make changes in a recipe the first time I  make it. This was a exception to my rule.
I used a white cake mix, only used 1 cup of coconut in the batter and used a can of coconut milk plus some water for the liquid.  Outstanding!

This was the most delicious thing I've ever tasted.  We used a instant coconut cream pudding instead of vanilla.  It was amazing, very moist.

This cake is moist and delicious.  My only revision for next time...I will only put coconut on the top of the cake.  Adding coconut to the cake part made it messy to cut and it fell apart.  No one else complained as they devoured it! YUMMY!

This has a great flavor! I used this for the second layer of a 3 teir cake. Its very moist and I've very glad that it only had to support 2 six in rounds. I used a lemon frosting which went beautifully!

My husband is from california, and I'm from the Bible Belt...he wanted coconut cake for his birthday, and I had never cooked with coconut before. This cake turned out AWESOME! I used just a lil bit more milk in the icing, to help it spread better. NO ONE could stop eating it...my poor husband only got one peice!

I loved the toasted coconut on the top.  I toasted mine in the oven with out mixing it with any butter and it came out perfect.  I didn't care for the addition of the nuts in the cake batter.  A good cake though and good icing.

This recipe was easy to follow and produced a very moist cake. I tweaked it a bit by using coconut milk instead of water and replaced the vanilla extract with coconut extract.

This cake is absolutely, insanely, sweet!  I love sweets, but could barely finish a piece.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but used coconut milk instead of regular milk.  I also withheld the walnuts.  This is one cake that I will be sure to make to wow friends and family!

I made the recipe as is except for using 2 rounds instead of the 9X13.  It was so tasty.  It is rich. So like someone else said, the cake goes a long way with a crowd since a small piece is so rich.  The icing was a bit sweet for my taste but everyone else just loved it!  I'll definitely make this cake again.

This is VERY rich and a good dessert for a crowd, as a small piece will satisfy.  Part of that richness is the creme cheese icing. So, on a portion of the cake (to lighten the load), I instead tried a dollop of whipped cream sprinkled with some of the buttered/browned coconut.  REALLY good!  Also, prepared without the creme cheese icing, the cake doesn't require refrigeration.  Cake is a bit crumbly, but very tasty whichever topping you choose.

LOVED IT!  Made it for my boyfriend's birthday and he loved it too!  I used the 9x13 pan and cut it in half to make the double layer.  It was my first time to double a cake but turned out great!  Will make again for sure!

I made this cake for my son's 6th birthday because he loves coconut. It was so easy and came out sooooo nice.  I was almost going to skip the toasted coconut topping but am so glad i didnt, it adds so much to the finished cake.  I also baked mine in a springfoam pan for 45 minutes. This cake is huge.

Very good - moist and flavorful.  My father in law has a coconut cake every year and his favorite bakery stopped making them.  I made this one because of the high reviews and was pleased.  I added probably 1/2 c applesauce because of some reviewiers saying it was dry.  I was disappointed that it was yellow instead of white so i might sub another cake mix, but it tasted so good id hate to mess it up.  FIL didn't mind the yellow.  He likes a different icing though so I made the icing from the "6 layer coconut cake" recipe on this site.  It was perfect.

It was ok. The cake was crumbly and the frosting too sugary, subing pudding sounds like it would have been better. It's not going to stay in my house as it will not get eaten.  I will look at at more coconut cake recipes before I try it again w/ making substitutions.

This cake is amazing!  I use 2 8 or 9" rounds, split them and fill with raspberry jam.  I've used this frosting recipe but there's another one I like better.  This cake is amazing though!

Very Very tasty and it makes much cake mix. Everyone in my family liked it and I would say that out of three other cakes I made, this was the one that was finished. Only thing I would change is its sweetness. It was very sweet.

This was an easy recipe and the result was a wonderfully moist cake.  I made a plain cream cheese icing and then scattered some coconut and nuts on top.  It's a sweet cake and I thought two more cups of coconut would make it too sweet - and for our family it would have.  Served it twice over the weekend to company and was asked for the recipe both times.  Thanks so much for sharing this with us!

I followed a bunch of others suggestions and used cream of coconut and store-bought cream cheese icing. I also made as cupcakes since they were traveling to a party.  Delicous!

Followed directions exactly, and cake was delicious and moist.  I felt the frosting was too sweet, and will try to make it a bit more tangy next time.  Easily the quickest, most moist, and simplest cake I have tried.

Absolutely wonderful!! Followed directions exactly. The only thing I would change is to halve the cream cheese frosting recipe. Way too much for just frosting the top of a 9 x 13 inch pan. Other than that, one of the best at-home cakes I have ever made!

Yum! This is by far one of the easiest and tastiest cakes I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly, the only change being instead of making the frosting I used canned Cream Cheese frosting and sprinkled some toasted coconut on top of that. Super easy.

I made this for a church Luau we had for a couple that were leaving to the mainland, and everyone loved it. My husband really liked it, and asks for it all the time. Wouldn't change a thing

I made this coconut cake for my Bunco group last night.  The ladies loved it!  I made it as the recipe says, however, I substituted pecans for the walnuts.  I love pecans.  Even the ladies who said they typically didn't care for sweets - loved it!  Didn't have alot left over.  I will definitely make this again.  Oh, and the toasted coconut on top - YUMMY!

Yum, everyone raved and wanted the receipe. They had no idea I started with a cake mix. I did make 2 changes to the cake. I used 1/2 melted butter instead of oil & I omitted the nuts. I think next time I will add a little more coconut but will shread. I may also add another egg. I would also like to add coconut extract instead a vanilla. I am a sweet junkie.

This has become a family favorite!  If yoou love coconut and walnuts - this is perfect!  People will think you've made it entirely from scratch.  One thing I've added is lemon zest in the frosting.  It gives it a nice zip!

Dumbfoundingly good. I made this for my friend's birthday, and it received RAVE reviews. I ditched the nuts, pressed raw coconut into the sides and top, and decorated the edge only with the toasted coconut.

I may try it next time with a chocolate cake -- could be interesting.

Excellent cake. Easier than scratch, but better than just a box mix and canned frosting. The family loved it, I will make this again.

This recipe was soooo good!  The only change I made was to make 2 8" layers and spread some of the cream cheese frosting in between.  This one didn't last long!!!

This is a fabulous cake! It is easy and very moist.    
My daughter loved it for her birthday.  I did have to cook it about 10 minutes longer than the recipie indicated, I used pecans instead of walnuts, and I made 9" layers. This is new "Family Favorite".

This was a fabulous recipe! We made it for Easter and everyone raved all night about it.  The only change I made was 1/2 the coconut in the cake, no coconut in the frosting - only the yummy browned coconut on top. I am not too big on lots of coconut. A+! Thanks for sharing

I'm not usually a fan of coconut, but I made this cake for my mom, and we both loved it!  The frosting was a bit much in both quantity and sweetness, so next time I won't use all of the frosting on the cake, and I may try adding just 3 cups of sugar instead of 3-1/2.

This cake was absolutely delicious!!  After he had a peice, my uncle wanted me to make one just for him.  This definitley does not taste like it's made with a box mix and the cream cheese frosting is scrumptious.  Thanks for sharing this easy but elegant recipe with us Diane.  My family thanks you.

AWESOME CAKE!!!!!!!!!  Very moist and so tasty!!  I made into a layered cake using two 9" round pans and it turned out wonderfully!!  It was used for a birthday so instead of putting toasted coconut on top I put colored sprinkles all over.  It was a big hit!
