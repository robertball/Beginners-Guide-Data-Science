All I can say is awesome.  This recipe is quick to prepare, hearty and most of all, tastes great!  I used shitake mushrooms and added 2 cloves of garlic and WOW, I should have made double the recipe.  Tip, watch and stir mixture occasionaaly, mine took about 35-40 minutes, not 50.  I will continue to make this.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This dish is awesome.  I used vegetable stock instead of water and omitted the powdered beef bouillon.  I also left out the canned mushrooms as I don't really like them and didn't have any fresh on hand.  Instead of using green onions I used a medium sweet vidalia onion.  I had never thought about browning the barley before I cooked it, but wow what a great new taste.  I should have realized that as most things taste better browned....onions, etc.  I browned the onions with the barley.  This is FABULOUS and I'm so excited to find a barley dish that isn't soup !  LOL

I follow Weight Watchers core program and this is totally core.  I'm trying out different foods and barley was on my list, so I made this recipe, with no changes.  It was AWESOME, loved it !

Great way to cook barley!  I substituted leek for the green onion and used fresh mushrooms because that's what I had on hand, sauteeing them along with the barley before adding the broth.

This dish was great.  I left out the mushrooms and added crushed garlic because of personal preferences, but it turned out perfectly.  My whole family loved it.  It took less time than to bake than noted.  Just make sure you take it out when the water is absorbed or it will probably burn or turn to mush.  This dish will become a staple in my diet.

Absolutely wonderful!  We like this even better with chopped sweet onions, fresh brown mushrooms and a little thyme.

After reading the reviews I decided to make this with some alterations.  I only had instant barley so mine only took about 20 mins to cook.  I browned the barley along with 1/2 a white onion and 1/2 a celery rib, both finely chopped as will as 3 cloves of garlic.  Instead of water I used chicken stock.  I added about 1 cup of thinly sliced baby bellas and a dash of cumin.  This was my 1st attempt at making barely and I really enjoyed it.

This is a very good recipe.  I used beef broth which the barley absorbed giving the dish a rich, beefy flavor. I could have used it as the main dish.   I also used fresh mushrooms because that is what I had on hand.  The mushrooms were saut√©ed in butter prior to my adding to the barley.  Delicious.

For something with so few ingredients, this is delicious!  I was hesitant to try it because it just didn't sound like it would taste good, but with all the good reviews I decided to give it a try.  Instead of water, I used low sodium veggie broth.  I also sauteed the onion and mushrooms with a little garlic before baking it all in a casserole dish (I upped the servings to 6 to feed my family).  Kids loved it.  Served as a main dish with a veggie side....easy weeknight meal!

Loved.  I've made Barley soups before but never as a signature side or main meal.  Not sure why not - like a rice side or main dish.  Loved and you will too. Will play around with to make it a more filling meal...besides simply doubling it.  Ground beef and celery perhaps. We'll see but thank you for the great idea and springboard for ideas to come!!

very good.  it took longer than 50 minutes for my barley to evaporate all of the water/broth though.  good flavor and pretty with the bits of onion.  i used fresh mushrooms which didn't alter the recipe.

We made this for dinner as a main dish and my kids who are picky were not thrilled though they did eat it.  But my husband and I REALLY liked it.  I used fresh mushrooms because that's all I had on hand and they worked great.  I can see doing this will yellow onions as well if you don't have green.  It's a great stick to your ribs dish that would be nice to serve as a side with beef or chicken too.  Thanks!

I realize this recipe is supposed to be pretty basic, but it was just too bland.  Definitely needs some doctoring up!  Of course, the imagination is the limit when it comes to what could be added here.

Very delicious.  I used vegetable broth in place of the water and beef bullion.  Definitely would make it again.  Add parsley when serving for color.

This was a very good recipe. Added some onion powder and garlic powder and used chicken bouillion because we don't eat red meat. Very tasty. Had it with spinach salad and baked chicken.

Surprisingly rich flavor. Very easy to make. I give it a 4 because not everyone at my house loved it as much as I, but everyone did like it.

it was ok. buttons already soggy and soggier after cooking in broth. barley was a little chewy; not sure if just not cooked long enough.
overall flavorpretty good.
