To make less dense, I think you should cut down on the butter and eggs (say to 6 tbs of butter and only 1 or 2 eggs) and then make up for the lost moisture with 1/2 c whole milk.  When beating together butter and sugar, make you are do it for a good 3-4 minutes.  It will get noticeable lighter.  Also cut the flour a little bit.  Finally, only add a pinch of salt.  Enjoy!

Delicious! I tweaked the recipe a bit and had fantastic results. As per another reviewers suggestion, I used only 6 tbs butter and added 1/2 c whole milk (still used 3 eggs!). I baked the cupcakes for the full 25 minutes and they were perfect! Not at all muffiny. Only a couple made it until the next day, and they were still great. We used buttercream frosting and that was a bit heavy for the cupcake, so maybe next time I'll try something new. Can't wait to make these again!

I should have read the reviews before making this recipe.  I am supposed to be making strawberry cupcakes for a 9 year old's birthday party.  These turned out to be delicious muffins, but definately NOT cupcakes.  It's my own fault for trying a new recipe the day of the party, but now I must go buy some cupcakes at the store because there isn't time to make any now.  If you want strawberry muffins though, these are really good.

I followed the suggestion of 6TBS butter, one egg, and I used 1/2 skim milk and a lot of strawberries and vanilla extract.  These were still buttery cupcakes, even with these lighter adjustments.  I made icing with 8oz cream cheese, 2 cups powdered sugar and dash of vanilla extract and topped with strawberries.  Good like a strawberry shortcake, not a typical cupcake flavor or texture.  I will make again as they were a hit for my neice's 3rd birthday =)

I've tried making them for the recent mothers day celebration.The texture isn't soft enough for my likings but the taste isn't that bad. Any idea of how to make it more soft and fluffy?

Enjoyed these very much. Didn't have any strawberry extract, so I used vanilla and they still turned out. I would go 1/2 cup finely chopped strawberries and I love the fruit and felt the 1/4 cup left me wanting more.

I frosted these with Cara's White Chocolate Sour Cream Frosting. I was a little disappointed that they fell a little when i took them from the oven, but that was probably my fault. They still looked really nice though, and the texture was wonderful. I prepared them as described by another reviewer and I didn't use the extract, but used almost .5 liters of strawberries. Still very moist 2 days later.

These are fantastic! Used for a baby girl shower.  To save time, I bought vanilla frosting and mixed in leftover strawberry flavor to taste- so yummy! These were gone in a minute.

This is a fun recipe but I let the strawberries drain so it woldn't be "wet".  I also made a strawberry mousse frosting and added a strawberry taffy candy for decoration.

I made this according to the recipe and it came out AMAZING! Very moist and quite yummy! The only change I made was that I added 1.5-2 cups of strawberries and they came out GREAT!! They didn't last very long in my house!

The cupcakes had a great flavor and everyone at work and home loved them with the cream cheese icing I used on them, but they were a bit thick. I only used 5 tablespoons of butter, 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons of milk, 2 teaspoons of baking powder a whole cup of finely chopped strawberries and three lightly beaten egg whites. Again, very delicious but not as light and fluffy as I'd wanted.

These cupcakes should not be considered cupcakes. They were too dense, and I almost considered making them for breakfast. 
Other than that, they had a great taste, and I couldn't stop eating the batter!

very good recipe. I added double the amount of  strawberries and raspberry extract instead of strawberry extract.  i wouldnt say its a cupcake recipe because it is more dense almost like a pound cake. will be making again.

I felt like this recipe was missing an ingredient.  When I mixed it up it turned out like a big ball of dough.  I added cream to it until it was more a batter consistency and they turned out great that way.  Easily made 18 cupcakes.  I also left out the strawberry flavoring and used more real strawberries instead.

Made as written, but used a lot more strawberries (almost a full cup) per previous reviews.  It is a bit heavy for a cupcake consistency, but still so tasty.  I paired it up with the vanilla powdered sugar fronsting recipe (also from this site).  I brought to my monthly cooking club & it was a hit!

These should be called muffins, not cupcakes, as that is what they are - muffins. Pretty good muffins though.  I added some pink food coloring for color, increased the berries by half and used 2 tablespoons of the juice from the berries in place of the extract as I didn't have any. The flavor was wonderful and I was pleased with how they turned out ~ as muffins, not cupcakes. Topped them with a white chocolate cream cheese frosting. They were moist when fresh, but had dried out considerably by the next day, so they need to be consumed pretty quickly.

I agree that these are kind of heavy. I made the adjustments that Rachel suggested, and then still ended up doing a lot of extra work because I didn't think they were cakey enough. I added more milk, sugar and strawberry, and still wasn't really confident that they were of great quality. However, five people tasted them and LOVED them, so I guess I was being picky.

These cupcakes are very bland. They need vanilla, or nuts, or something more than only 7 ingredients.

These cupcakes are really tasty. I made them with coconut (shredded coconut, and coconut extract) and they are perfect. They are a little bit dry though.

These are really good. More like a muffin than a cupcake though. I didn't have strawberry extract so I used raspberry and you couldn't tell I'd switched. I did double the strawberries and it needed the half cup. Even doing that, my husband still said it needed more strawberries. I expected these to be pink. They were not. Just plain white cake color with pieces of berry in them. These were tender and moist and not dense but not really as cake like as I expected. Really good though. I ate mine plain and it doesn't need any icing at all. Thanks for the great recipe. I will definitely make this again. So easy.

It  was a standard strawberry cupcake recipe, easy to follow. I added a few more diced fresh strawberries, finished with cream cheese frosting and fresh whole strawberries on top. That made the cupcakes pop with flavor!

Here is a simple and easy way to eliminate the taste of muffins rather than cake like batter.  I made these with a strawberry cake mix.  Followed the directions on the box, then gently stirred in the cut strawberries.  I topped with a butter cream icing using juice from the strawberries and a bit of red food coloring to tint them pink.  They were delicious and I had none to bring home from the family back yard picnic.  Got many compliments.

I followed the directions and added 2 more tsp of strawberry extract, one tsp of vanilla and 8 drops of red food coloring! With these modifications they turned out perfect. I paired it with a cream cheese icing with 3tsp of strawberry extract 5 drops of red food coloring and 3 strawberries for the ultimate strawberry cupcakes!

These cupcakes were ok. I used only six tablespoons of butter and a half cup of rice milk as suggested. I was planning on using three eggs but ended up only using two. I had no strawberry extract and only a drop of vanilla. They tasted fine, but not enough strawberries for me. Every bite that had a strawberry in it was wonderful. Next time I'll add more strawberries, probably 1/2 cup if not more. They were a little like a muffin but not at all dry. I think if you serve them as a muffin instead of a cupcake with frosting they would be really good. I used frosting but I think they would be better without. Over all they were ok as cupcakes and good as muffins, but I don't think I'll try them again until I get some strawberry extract

I tried this recipe with the modification everyone was talking abt using 6 tbsp butter and 1/2 cup milk. Okay. Still tasted like a muffin - not sweet and dense. Good for a muffin but this isnt really a cupcake.
