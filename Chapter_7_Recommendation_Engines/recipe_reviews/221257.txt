I have a recipe very similar to yours here so I can tell that when I give yours a try I'll like it :-) For those worried about using raw eggs you can use one tablespoon of mayonnaise per egg as a substitute or two to make the dressing creamier. I suggest using a good quality mayo because otherwise the flavor will be 'off'.

This was one of 3 caesar dressings we tried today and we did not care for this one at all. It was too sweet and the hot pepper sauce was not a good addition for us...we used Frank's Redhot Sauce since we don't care for Tabasco (and we like spicy things). 

We ended up adding 2-3 anchovy filets, a bit more red wine vinegar, and some black pepper. It was edible but we will not be making this one again.

I didnt use the raw eggs I opted to use mayo instead.  I was using this on a pasta salad that I wanted to be light as opposed to creamy and this did fine. I think it might have a little too much oil but it might be different if you put it on greens.

I used more than 6 drops of hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce and I also added a generous splash of fish sauce (for the anchovy element). Delisious, family keeps requesting it :)

Very good basic Caesar dressing.   I made as directed and missed the salty flavor of anchovy, so I added in 1 1/2 teaspoon of anchovy paste for the full recipe.   Thank you!

I used mayo instead of the eggs per someone's suggestion and it was good - tasted flavorful.  I used less oil than it called for - just the canola and not the olive oil - still good.  I'd make this again but maybe try for a little thicker with less oil.

i cheated by using 8oz.bottle of Italian dressing as a base. 
used 1/4 cup mayo (not eggs) and sugar just enough to take out the bitterness a little less than a 1/5 cup and no hot sauce.For creamer
dressing use extra mayo,the better the brand the better the dressing will taste.same with base dressing.
