I am the submitter of this recipe and I am sorry and should clarify. As per the other review, serve shortly after making, warm or room temp (another thing I love about this recipe, great for picnics and events because of not needing to keep cold) and as also stated, honestly, not good as leftovers. Sorry, but hope this helps future cooks.

I was so excited to serve this at a party.  It was SO delicious, five stars, after 20 minutes.  But I made it up earlier and had to refrigerate it...ewwww!  It was horrible cold and not as good re-heated.  I'll make it again, but I wish it'd been explained better.

How can you go wrong with all our favorite ingredients? I don't know but something went sadly wrong and this did not live up to our expectations - I would have rather had German Potato Salad - any day of the week and we LOVE Balsamic Vinegar, used our favorite kind; love bacone, onions, etc but this stuff just didn't cut it for any of us . . . .

Is this served warm or cold?  Can it be made a day ahead?

My friends liked this as well, but I tweaked.  I didn't add all the garlic the recipe suggested and even wondered if that was written wrong.  I would also suggest white balsamic vinegar instead of red.  I also didn't know what seafood seasoning was,  so I used Lawry's and a pepper seasoning blend that I have.

Our new favorite potato salad recipe!!! Served the salad at room temperature and got rave reviews!  The only alterations I made were to add a chopped tomato and after I chopped the red onion I cooked it for about a minute in a small amount of water in the microwave to take away the sharpness.  Really great and tasty recipe!

I have made this twice now. And have done some simple variations to it... Both times my husband has LOVED it. He loves it warm and cold.... It doesn't take long till it is all gone! Great potato salad!

Great recipe, especially the vineigrette.  I left out the eggs but substituted about a dozen halved and seeded cherry tomatoes.  Also made a batch with par boiled diced potato instead of roasted potato.  I added a little gemelli noodles to that one.

I love potatoes and everything else in this recipe. I ate till it hurt, good stuff. I would only ever serve this stuff fresh and warm, but will definitely serve again. Thanks.

Yum... 5 stars but I changed it up a bit, trying to make due with what I had...   My modifications are: 2lbs red potatoes.  I left out the garlic due to preference but that amount seems like an awful lot!  I use yellow onion, 1/3 cup cilantro in place of parsley, 3 hard boiled eggs and real bacon bits but no bacon grease.  I let it sit out a few hours to let the flavor marinade. :)

Let me start out by saying YUM! I asked my family to rate it out of 5 stars and my son said 10! I of coarse did a little modifying: 1 whole cup of oil plus bacon grease was way too much for my liking. And I was worried that 1/4 cup of basalmic (i only use good quality) would be to pungent. So I cut those quantities down. Thank u! A new favorite In Our home

This salad rocks. Made it a couple of times and tried to convince everybody that it's no good so I can have it all by myself. Even better after one day in the fridge IF there's something left...

I do not like jarred garlic--I think it has an off taste--but buy peeled garlic in bulk from Sam's, so had plenty. I started to use my garlic press to get the 1/2 cup, but after two cloves realized I should pull out my Pampered Chef chopper; that made fast work of the garlic. I didn't have baby red potatoes and the grocery store is too far away for a quick trip, so used regular red potatoes and cut them in fourths length-wise, and then in half. I knew all that garlic would be fine because roasted garlic has a lovely mellow flavor, and the oven was low enough not to burn the garlic. Unfortunately, my potatoes weren't cut small enough to be tender in the 40-50 minutes listed--at which point the garlic was lovely--and by the time the potatoes were tender, the garlic was crispy. So, in the future (and there WILL be a future!) I'll either cut the potatoes smaller, or roast them for 15 minutes before adding the garlic. 

The real question I have is the 1/2 cup garlic in the dressing. There was no way I was going to do that. I LOVE garlic, as does my entire family, but that seemed like a recipe for disaster. So, I added 2 or 3 cloves of minced garlic to the dressing and called it good.

I also burned the bacon somehow, so had to start over with the other half of the package. I'm thinking it would be easier to cook evenly--and not burn--if the bacon were chopped up before putting it in the pan; I can't think how that's a change that would affect the recipe in any way except to preven

The salad was a huge it. I didn't have all the ingredients, so I modified it a bit. I used one whole bulb of garlic, chopped and divided it in half. I then used a sweet yellow onion and cooked it in the bacon grease along with the onion and tossed that into the bowl with the potatoes. I did not add peas. It was pretty delicious.
