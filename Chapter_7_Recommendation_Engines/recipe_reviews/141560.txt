I think this recipe has potential, but it really needs to be worked on. There is no sauce on the tortillas, so they really dry out when you bake them. It was actually kind of sharp going down my throat! Maybe coat them in butter? Or bake them in a syrup like the fruit versions?

Even though Im not a big Banana fan this was just as good as anything else.. I too had trouble with the dry edges but I solved that by making a banana sauce with the left over mashed bananas (about 1/4-1/3 cup and added about a cup of water, 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup butter in a sauce pan and poured over them before baking. This helped and did not take away the yum! Gonna see about making a low fat version of this too!
