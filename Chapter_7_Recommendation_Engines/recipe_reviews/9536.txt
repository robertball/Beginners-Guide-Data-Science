This recipe is awesome! I think the reason why some people's came out flattened is they might have worked with the dough too much OR their kitchen was too hot. If it is too hot inside your kitchen things tend to react differently. AND if you kept working with the dough your hands may have congealed the butter more and made it more liquid within the cookie. If it's hot in your kitchen and you are working with things like this, it's best to keep the dough in the fridge and take out little bits to roll while you make them. Hope this makes sense!

I love snowballs, but didn't have my recipe.  I used this one instead because I was short on powedered sugar and this didn't use any in the dough.  They were not like what I've made before at all.  The cookies flattened out in the baking so that they weren't balls at all and they were too salty.  If you do make these, I reccomend rolling them in sugar twice: once when they're hot out of the oven and again after they've cooled.  The first layer gets rather pasty from the heat, but soaks into the cookies very well.  The second layer sticks to the outside for a nice look.

My family loved these cookies.  They came out just like I hoped.  Sifting the flour was a great idea.  I did overcook the first batch because I kept waiting for them to get a little brown and they never did.  The secret is to check the bottom and see if that has become slightly brown.  Great recipe. Thanks!

Is it possible that folks are experiencing trouble because of the white sugar?  I have made snowballs, aka Mexican Wedding Cakes, aka Swedish Tea Cakes for as long as I can remember and have always used powdered sugar in the dough.

PLEASE NOTE!  I've already reviewed this recipe once.  It's fabulous but a few changes make it even better.  Leave the recipe alone...It's perfect.  Roll the cookies smaller than you think you should.  The recipe says it makes 48...I can get 110 out of it.  They turn out so much better the smaller they are.  I also toast the pecans before I put them into the cookie.  Also, roll the cookies in powdered sugar right when they come out of the oven and then roll them again.  The first coating gets kind of sticky and then the second coating makes them perfect.  Make these cookies...you won't regret it!

Yum, this recipe was great! You just might want to adjust the cooking time. I found if you followed the recipe cook time the cookies were quite overdone!

I would have given this recipe 5 stars, however, as written it's problematic.  Here's the low down I got from my sister who bakes all the time.  First off, the dough absolutely needs to be chilled prior to baking.  Second, the oven temperature should be 350.  I tried this, and the balls were perfect. Lastly, use unsalted butter when baking with a recipe that calls for salt.  Using 3/4 teaspoons of salt and salted butter will make the cookies too salty.  This same dough can be used to make crescents, or if you don't mind them spreading, they make a very tasty cookie.

I have made this recipe for over 40 yars.
We call it Russian Teacakes, the Russian friend of my mother made them every year and I do now. In fact I am making 2 batches today for a dinner tonight.
The problem you are all having IS in the sugar.  It has to be confectioners sugar to et the light and fluffy taste and texture. When you bite into these cookies they should fall apart in your mouth. I also use walnuts that are a bit more solid, although I love pecans. I also use more flour 2  1/4 cup and less salt 1/4 tsp. this also may be your problem. Do try these they have always been a big hit.

I have made these a couple times referencing the other similar recipes on the site as well and to turn this into a 5 star recipe I just changed the sugar to 1 cup confectioners sugar, I find it makes for a more delicate treat. I also roll them in the confectioners sugar both while hot and again 15 minutes later while cool. I sometimes use walnuts or almonds instead of pecans, just depends on what I have around.

Because I was able to chop the pecans to tiny bits, these little cookies were great for my toddler!  They taste pretty good.  I am making Christmas cookie tins for my friends and family, and these are the perfect cookie to ballance out all that super sweet chocolate  recipes I have made!  Only one thing I don't like...how do I make the powdered sugar stick better?

I like this recipe, but if you don't use UNSALTED butter, the recipe WILL be too salty.  I tried to make them with margargine to appease my husband and they came out tasting like a salt lick!! Every other time I have made them they have come out great.  I do make them on the small side, because since they are covered in powdered sugar, they tend to be too messy if you have to take a couple bites of them.  It is better to make them small enough to pop in your mouth in one bite.  I also use silicone baking mats opposed to greasing my baking sheets and wait for the bottoms to just be slightly browned. before I remove them from the oven.  When they have cooled COMPLETELY, I put a whole bunch of powdered sugar in one or two  sealable bags (depending on the size I have on hand) and drop in the cookies.  I shake them and leave them in there until I am ready to serve them, that way the sugar doesn't soak in and they look beautiful and perfect all covered in "snow".

So easy to make and so good! My mother made these all the time so I was happy to find this recipe. I use chopped walnuts instead of pecans simply because that's our preference. Great for Christmas cookies or any time of the year.

These. Are. Rockin'! I think that those who had trouble used granulated sugar, when it makes more sense and is easier when you use powdered sugar. Yum.

gee, i'm completely clueless on what went wrong but my snowballs turned out to be more of a snowdrop. i'm an experinced baker & followed this recipe as written but ended up with uniform rounded mounds, not balls. they're still very pretty when dusted with powdered sugar. regardless of the appearance, this cookie is tasty (light & buttery). after rereading this recipe several times i'm baffled why they didn't stay in the original round shape. final note: my snowdrops were done in 20 minutes. signed~ perplexed in pittsburgh.

These are fantastic! It's like a little bit of buttery heaven melting in your mouth. They are very easy to make and don't take much time. Definitely, DO NOT substitute anything else for the butter - you would surely regret it! I think I'll go have one more...

I made my cookies into 2 inch balls, so I only had two dozen when I finished. Next time, I'll make sure and double the recipe. They are very good cookies!

Just finished making these cookies, they are AMAZING! Just like my grandma used to make. Light and airy but still crunchy! I read that you shouldn't use salted butter.. I did and they came out a little flat. Not extremly flat, but not the ball I rolled before putting in the oven. That doesn't even matter though because they are SO good! I would definitally recommend. I'm going to make another double batch tomorrow for the holidays because they are so good!

OMG  These were great! I only had some brown sugar and ground pecan and they turned out amazing!  I had them for 20 minutes in the oven in the upper rack and this was enough.  I tried with the first batch what I read about double coating them with sugar while hot and after and I thought it was too much. The second batch I only coated them after they cooled and they were just perfect!  Thank you for this easy and delicious recipe.

Verygood recipe.  I made these for Christmas and found that the advice to wait until they are completely cooled before rolling in powdered sugar.....is great advice!!  I didn't and now know why!!  Not the best I've tasted...but very good!

My dough was a little dry and they wouldn't take form.  I added some water to the mix and they were perfect.  My mistake was perhaps melting the butter and then mixing it with the sugar.  I don't know what went wrong with the dough, but howerver they were a success.  I love the taste of them and will share my batch with my whole family.

I made these twice with two variations. the first time was with walnuts....while the second time was with cashewnuts....and i must say both were really good....different yeas, but good!
it took me about 23 minutes to bake.
and rolling once in confectioners sugar while warm is important. and roll again once cool.
i didn't use any other extract other than vanilla, and i used regular white sugar and not powdered sugar as some people suggested, and it turned perfectly alright!
absolutely 'melt in your mouth'!!!

I lost my recipe for Snowballs, which I make every year for Christmas, and while these were not as good as the ones I've made in the past, they are pretty good! I would suggest making them smaller rather than larger in size, they are not as doughy this way and you get more icing sugar per mouthful of cookie this way: definitley delicious. Also, as some of the users have said in the other reviews, rolling them (or as I did, filling a bowl with icing sugar and shaking the cookies in the bowl for a less dense coating) in the icing sugar while hot, then letting them cool and sifting new icing sugar over them makes them taste soooo good!

During the Christmas holiday I made 6 different types of cookies. These were the easiest and most delicious of them all. I couldn't believe how fast they disappeared. These cookies are absolutly wonderful and are now a permanent part of my Holiday cookie tray. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Absolutly Delicious!  After reading previous reviews I put the cookies in the refrigerator before I baked them.  They held their shape well.

Instead of balls they turned out into pancakes. Too much butter in the recipe I think.

I agree with "perplexed" that they were more of a "snow mound" than a snowball, but I also have to say that they still looked very nice and tasted REALLY yummy!  They were the cookie that went the fastest on trays this year.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I tried this recipe for a cookie exchange party my neighbors and I were having. I had the oven temp on 350 and cooked the first batch WAY too long. But if you have it on 350 degrees and leave them in for 12-13 mins or until golden brown on the bottom, they come out MAGNIFICENT. In fact, I won 2nd place in the cookie exchange, and some people were actually mad mine didn't win! Great holiday recipe! Must try at least once!

I read several reviews and didn't see anything about the amount of vanilla in the recipe -- it does say 1 Tablespoon, right?  I couldn't quite get myself to add that much, I stuck with a teaspoon, guessing it was a type-o.  I also cut back on the salt and used walnuts since that's what I had.  I used granulated sugar since that's what the recipe said, and mine turned out roundish, not flat like some other reviewers.  I liked what someone suggested, storing them in a ziplock of powdered sugar.  Although these cookies were good, i think the snowballs I sampled at Costco (from a mix) were better.

These are a Christmas tradition at our house.  Use good quality butter or margarine to prevent cookies from flattening out.  Some margarines contain WATER.  Look for a higher calorie count to get a margarine with the least water.  I like to use almond extract instead of vanilla.

I needed a snowball recipe for my daughter's wedding and made this one without taste testing first.  It was fantastic and easy to make.  It definetly will go into my "recipe box" for Christmas cookies.

I've used this recipe for about 3 years and have never had problems with the dough flattening out.  Perhaps people are melting the butter instead of softening it at room temperature??  Also, you can definitely taste the salt in this cookie. I like that contrast between salty and sweet. But it can be overwhelming.  Be sure to use real, unsalted butter and reduce the salt from 3/4 tsp to 1/2 tsp.

I have been making snowballs at xmas time for years - using by best friend's mom's recipe!!  This year I could not find that one so tried this one.  The balls turned out fantastic.  My issue is always I make them too big so there never is enough to go around.

These turned out lovely - nice and crispy with just a hint of chewiness - I added extra vanilla bean extract as I love that flavour.

Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good and very easy recipe.  I use a small ice cream scoop to make them faster and uniform.  You must chill the dough in order to keep the ball shape, but worst case, they flatten a little and are still delish!  Let cool a bit before rolling in powdered sugar.  Thanks!

I made these cookies while visiting my mother one day. My mother-in-law makes them for the holidays ever year and includes them in her "treat basket". So I was pleasantly surprised when she liked my cookies from an updated version of her old recipe. Make sure you let them cool a bit before rolling them in powdered sugar.  I learned after the first time the cookies were too hot so the sugar melted and didn't leave a powdered layer. Will use this recipe again and again.

I have not made Snowballs in years and was glad to find a recipe similar to mine. These are so easy to make and taste wonderful. However, I would suggest mixing the dough, shaping into a ball and chilling it for about an hour prior to making cookie balls. I didn't do this at first and ended up doing so.  The dough was much easier to work with and the cookies came out perfect with no flattening.

Delicious cookie.  In an effort to preserve the round shape, I too put mine in the frige prior to baking - they still came out mound shaped.  Covered with powdered sugar, they look more like igloos than snow balls, so that's what I'm going to call mine.  Thanks for a great cookie recipe.

When I started making these, I was wondering how such a simple batter could turn into such wonderful cookies.. but OH MY GOODNESS these are soooo tasty! 

As others had said, I put my batter (already balled up on the cookie sheets) into the fridge before baking, and all but 2 cake out perfectly round.  I used walnuts (as that was what I had) and they seemed to do the job.  Also, I only waited about 5 minutes before rolling in the sugar, and that seemed to be fine as well.  I'm anxious to see if they taste as good cooled as they do warm!

These came out a little dryer than I hoped.  It was very time consuming to roll this dough because it kept breaking into piles of dust.  I thought it could have used some more butter.

RECIPE LOOKS AND TASTES GREAT WITH GLUTEN FREE FLOUR!  I did increase the oven to 350.  And used unsalted butter and  decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp.  Note:  Do not wait for cookies to brown.  Keep the balls small so that you can pop the whole cookie into your mouth since it will come apart if you try to bite into it.

For years I have made these, exactly the same recipe. But during a cookie exchange, a woman I worked with made these, using cake flour instead of all-purpose.  It is def worth the change. Although, no matter what, these are the best!  If you have cake flour, just try it, and I'll bet, you will never use all-purpose flour in these cookie again.

They were very tasty but I prefer the ones with the confectioners sugar in the batter- these were more crunchy than fluffy to me.

I thought the recipe was absolutely awesome but the time was off. I have a pretty new oven so I think the temp is right on. But 25 minutes was way to long on these cookies. They were hard as rocks. I tried the next batch for 15 minutes and they were perfect! The best tasting snowball cookies ever!!!

These are amazing.  I make them every Christmas and they don't last long!  I also roll them in the powdered sugar twice.  I've made with both pecans and walnuts and they come out great every time.

LOVED these! My kids weren't keen on the nuts that I added, which worked out great for me & I ate the lot!

good christmas cookies! Just like I remember. I agree to roll the dough twice in the powdered sugar - once right after the cookies come out of the oven and then again a few minutes later.
