I make this using 1 can of NSA black beans (drained and rinsed), 1 can of NSA corn (drained), 1 can of NSA diced tomatoes, and a bouillon cube . Still very easy and very delicious! Add 1/2 tsp of chili powder and 1 tsp of ground cumin. A little lime juice and some cilantro are great too.

I'm giving this 4 stars, because although it was super easy and hassle-free (that on its own is worth 5 stars!), the flavor was lacking and bland (3 stars). The veggie blend I used was a frozen Fire Roasted Black Bean blend (fire roasted sweet corn, black beans, red and green poblano peppers). The veggies did provide some flavor, but the recipe definitely needed some additional seasonings. Even adding salt helped a lot. Of course, the more you tweak, the more it defeats the purpose of a simple recipe.  Next time I'll use broth to cook the quinoa. This would also be tasty with some minced cilantro.

Going to give this 5 stars and haven't even tried it, but the simple idea is wonderful, even though I had a bit of a problem finding the vegi mix.  Think when I do make this, and I will, I'll add a bit of feta just for taste.
