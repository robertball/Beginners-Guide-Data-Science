This is similar to my recipe, but a little bland.  I also add some shredded cheddar cheese to mine, and also add a little sugar and apple cider vinegar to the mayonnaise.

An old standby from childhood.  We had garden fresh peas this week and it was a great way to use them.

I have been trying to find a recipe for pea salad my friends mother makes.  This is incredibly close,  and  just "down-home"  delicious all the same.  It is usually the first bowl empty at the bbq! In my family that's bragging rights for sure.
