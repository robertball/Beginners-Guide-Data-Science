After reading all the reviews I approached this recipe from a different angle.  First I took 5 large yams, washed and dryed them and placed them on a cookie sheet and baked in a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes.  I removed them and let them cool to touch.  This made it so easy to remove the skin and slice into 2 inch rounds.  I layered the rounds in a baking dish and poured the syrup over the rounds (I used dark Karo Syrup instead of maple), dusted with the nutmeg and cinnamon, also dusted with some brown sugar, and dotted with butter.  I then added half a cup of water to the pan, not over the rounds. Covered with foil I baked in a 325 degree oven for 40 mintues.  They were perfect!!!  Remove the foil, spoon some of the syrup over the rounds and serve.  Lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.

Excellent, we like maple syrup but were afraid it would be too sweet, cut the syrup to 1/2 a cup and water the rest, taste was scrumptious, even the kids who are not big yams lovers, loved it.

I don't eat yams, so I cannot say personally how these turned out.  However, my husband hasn't stopped talking about these yams!  He's already asking me to make them next year for Thanksgiving and every year thereafter.  I guess they were GREAT.  I did read other reviews and planned ahead. I peeled and sliced the yams the night before, and stored in the fridge in a baggie(they maintain their quality well).  Then the morning of Thanksgiving I steamed in the microwave for 8 1/2 minutes.  At this point I proceeded to follow recipe as stated.  It made it super easy, and fast, on a busy cooking day like Thanksgiving. Worth the time, just plan ahead.  I also cut the syrup down to 1/2 cup as suggested by another reviewer.

I follow this basic recipes; however I try to make it a little healthier.
I peel, cut into 1" chunks, cook in microwave w/ 2-3 T. of water for about 8 minutes, remove, add 1 T. of butter, and 2 T of maple syrup along with the spices, mix to coat, and then bake in the oven on 350 for 25 minutes; I check on them periodically and stir as necessary.

Thansk to reviewers on the heads up about the cooking time! I nuked mine for 8 minutes first & then sliced them into spears & baked them. I was undecided as to whether I should peel the potatoes or not...in the end, I decided to try them unpeeled & am I ever glad. The peel added a  nice bit of texture. These were really, really good...we'll have them over & over again. Thansk Iron Chef Suzi-Q!

These yams tasted delicious.  I had problems with the cooking instructions as well.  After 45 minutes they were still hard as rocks.  I had to reread the instructions to see if I was supposed to boil the yams first.  I had to pop them into the microwave to finish cooking them.  But still they tasted really good

This tasted fantastic.  It left a lot of juices in the pan, so I mashed up the yams and drizzled some of the juice on top..  yummy!  I also put a little brown sugar on top (a few Tbl.) and cut the maple syrup down to 1/2 c.  Next time I will use a little less butter.

I made these for Christmas dinner and the family loved them.  They were probably the most talked about dish of the meal.  I did microwave the yams for about 8 minutes first and I added a little brown sugar.  I was a bit worried about leaving the skin on, so I peeled some of them and left skin on a few and everyone said both ways tasted great.We will definitely make these again

The flavor was good on this one, but did anyone else have a problem with the cooking time?  After 30 minutes, my yams were still rock hard - So I popped them into the microwave for 10 mintues to finish the cooking.

so so good!  Be careful not to overdo it with the maple syrup, it can get a little too sweet.  I lay out the yam slices and then eyeball it, making sure I put a little on each one.

Even though these were good, they took WAY longer than 25 minutes to cook. They took more like 45 minutes to cook. I suggest cooking them longer than what the recipe states. And I did not have nutmeg, so I used ginger. They were pretty good.

I made some changes according to other reviews.  I baked 8 small to medium sized yams at 400 until tender (around 45 minutes), than removed the skins before slicing into 3/4 - 1 inch rounds.  I then laid them at an angle in a 9x13 pan.  I drizzled 1/3 cup of melted coconut oil (couldn't use butter because of a dairy allergy in the family) over the yams and then sprinkled the cinnamon and freshly ground nutmeg over the top.  Afterward, I drizzled 1/2 cup maple syrup over the top with a splash of water.  I covered with foil and cooked at 350 for 30 minutes.  It was excellent!  I took it to a family gathering and everyone really enjoyed it!

OK, so this is a hard rate for me...
I peeled and chopped my sweet potatoes into rounds, and melted the butter, syrup and spices together in a sauce pan and poured it over the chunks. I cooked this for WELL over an hour, and they came out rock hard and I needed to microwave them for at least and extra 10 mins to soften them up. They were delish though.
Next time I make these I'm going to peel and chop them MUCH smaller, maybe 1 inch squares, and see how that is? The flavor is there, the cooking directions suck though.

Excellent! I am not a yam/potato fan and I wasn't sure how the maple syrup,nutmeg,
cinnamon would taste with a first course but these were delicious. Make sure you use real maple syrup as artificial really would change the taste. Thanks for this fine recipe.

I took the "hint" from other reviews and microwaved my yams for 5 mins first. Then I cut thick rounds, cut those in 1/2, then tossed them with brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and pecans. I left the skin on. Dumped it in a greased casserole dish, dotted it with chunks of real butter, covered, and baked for 30 mins at 350. Mashed them slightly with a potato masher and served. These were the best yams I have ever had!!! I had NO leftovers. Definitely making this again. And again.

I gave this recipe three stars since it would not be edible as written. Using the advice of other reviewers, I steamed the yams in the microwave for 8 minutes prior to preparing. After adding the other ingredients, I baked the dish for about 35 minutes. Even after pre-steaming and baking more than the suggested time, many pieces were still too hard to eat. I microwaved the yams an additional 3 minutes until most of the slices had a nice texture. The flavor was good and my husband, who doesn't usually enjoy non-traditional vegetable, enjoyed them. With the additional cooking, I would rate this recipe four stars. But until the author updates the directions, I cannot highly recommend Harvest Yams.

I made this with a slight difference, though sure it would be great the original way, but wanted a more traditional-looking turkey side-dish. Baked the yams in the oven, skin on until tender, (depends on the size of yam) at 350. Then when cooler, run under cold water and the skin slips right off. Slice into 1/4 inch discs, layer in pan, adding butter, nutmeg and cinnamon lightly to each layer. Add maple syrup, no brown sugar and a splash of water)Bake under foil ( I did this after removing my turkey from the oven to rest) bake another 30-40 minutes until heated through. Delicious (still good 3 days later haha, I made too much) This will be my standard yam recipe for Christmas from now on. Thanks for the delicious idea!

Ditto on increasing the cooking time.  After I baked them in the oven for 25 minutes they were still hard so I microwaved them for about 6 minutes.  Great taste though, and even my picky son ate them!

me and my sister in-law needed a simple and easy yan recipe for our thanksgiving recipe. We found this one and tried it. It tasted great. We baked it in the oven for about 45min. We didn't have any nutmeg so we left it out and also cut down on the syrup some with water. everyone loved them.

The end result was fine but don't try this recipe the day of your gathering.  I got everything ready to go and 40 minutes before dinner time I placed the yams in the oven.  40 minutes later they were still hard as a rock.  60 minutes later you still couldn't insert a fork.  Finally, they ended up cooking in the microwave.  Worth the wait but don't count on the 25 minutes.

Easy & good. My sister made this recipe when we were visiting: my husband requested it for Christmas dinner. I didn't have maple syrup, so I used corn syrup with maple extract. He said it tasted the same.

Very good, I will make them again.  
I might cut down the butter though and maybe add some chicken broth instead. 
I also put the sweet potatoes in the microwave prior to cooking for 7 minutes so that the cooking time would be 30 min in the oven.

This recipe was a hit with my family!! They are now insisting I make this every Christmas instead of the traditional recipe with marshmallows. HOWEVER, at 325 degrees, the yams weren't cooked all the way in the time frame suggested in the recipe. So, I turned it up to 425 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes and they were perfect!!! I also used sugar free syrup for the maple flavor and to cut down the carbs from regular maple syrup (my husband is diabetic) and so that it's not too sweet. They loved it!!! Thanks!

Very tasty. I used 2 large yams and cut back on the other ingredients. The only thing that didn’t make sense was the cooking time. After 25 minutes they were hard as rock. I cooked them for an hour.

I made it as is. It was very tasty The sauce was a bit thin, so when I make it next year I'll probably cut back a bit on the butter. And I'm not happy about less butter either ;)

I'm used to the brown sugar & butter ways which are thicker / stick to the potatoes more.

I used a mix of yams and sweet potatoes.  I also sliced them and baked them first for about 45 minutes.  Then I cut back on the maple syrup.  I'd make this again.

This recipe was so simple and it was very good. I have been looking for ways to cook yams without using sugary stuff, this work out just fine.

I peeled and sliced the yams in 1 inch discs. I was cooking chicken already, so I put it in the convection oven for an hour with the chicken.  It still needed another 20 minutes afterward though.  I followed the recipe, but think I would opt to mix it altogether next time and spread over everything.  Good flavor and the kids loved it.

I followed the advice of trinities and baked them first and cooled to peel and cut into the 2" pieces.  I also used less Maple Syrup than called for.  I did add so water to the pan as suggested but would use less another time.  These were delicious and I plan to make them again.

Delicious, ran out of maple syrup so I used 3/4 cups of honey mixed with 1/4 tsp of maple extract. Worked really well.

Bumped the temp to 400 and ended up cooking about 45 minutes. Pulled it out, drained some of the juices, mashed them, and covered with marshmallows. It was a major hit and most talked about dish on the table (in a good way!).

These were good, quick and easy, but it took a LOT longer than 25 minutes for these to bake to edible softness.  More like an hour, hour and a half.

These were so good!  i usually just like butter and salt, so i used the flavorings sparingly and they did take alot longer to cook, i even added some water so they wouldn't dry out.

I had to cook them for about 50 mins before they were done. And I think they would have tasted better if cooked skin up so they could soak up more of the butter syrup mixture.

My husband and I really enjoyed these yams.  I did take others advise and nuked them prior to baking as well as increased my baking time and they came out great.  I will fix again.

I fixed this easy recipe just 2 days ago for Christmas.  The only thing I did different were that I put 1/2 cup of water in with the potatos and I sliced them 1 inch thick. My family loved the recipe. It sure will be a family favorite. It took about 45 minutes to get them all the way tender. Chef Suzie-Q!!!!!!!!!

Great recipe
