I make this punch for a baby shower...and I ran out! It was a hit! Just be sure to let the sherbet sit out a while before making the punch.

If you like orange dreamsicles, you'll LOVE this! I made it for the kids at our New Year's Eve party and the adults loved it just as much (if not more!). Of the half gallon, I used a 2/3 orange sherbet and 1/3 vanilla ice cream. It was beautiful and frothy.

This punch was real easy and fast to make.  It taste more like orange juice than a punch.  Next time I will mix 1/2 sherbet with 1/2 vanilla ice cream and try that.

I have used this recipe often and everyone loves it. I recently tried it with lime sherbet and concentrated Limeade and it was wonderful.

I used vanilla ice cream with sherbert in it.  poured in a can or evaporated milk and a few cups of a citrus drink that was in the fridge, just to fill up the punch bowl.  It was great.  tasted just like anorange push up ice cream.  rave reviews

This is absolutly the best punch receipe I have ever had!!! I wouldn't change a thing about it. It is perfect just the way it is! I had been looking for a VERY simple punch receipe for a large gathering (200+ people). When I found this one I was a little skeptical because it was only 3 ingredients and you just mix it all in the punch bowl. No prep work! So I tried it out and had my sisters taste test it. They loved it!! I ended up making TEN batches of this receipe and by the end of the night the punch was gone and the coffee was hardley touched! It was a hit!!! Would highly recomend it. One reviewer suggested lime sherbet and frozen limeade...I think I will try that for the next party!!

Tastes just like an orange creamsicle!  I used orange sherbet/vanilla ice cream.  Kids and adults loved it.  No leftovers.  Make sure the orange juice and sherbet/ice cream is well softened before adding gingerale so it does not clump up too much.

I made this for my daughters baby shower. I made two punch bowls full and it was gone in a blink of an eye. It was a big hit. She asked me for the receipe a year later  to make at the baby's first birthday party. Everyone loved it.

I'm a huge fan of the old fashioned sherbet/ginger ale punch, and adding the OJ concentrate is a great addition! I doubled the batch for a large gathering and every drop was gone. Decorated with sliced frozen oranges to keep it cool.

This is really a yummy punch!  I'm willing to bet that the person who said it tasted just like orange juice, used a full 12 oz can and didn't notice that it only calls for a 6 oz can.  I almost did that, as I only had 12 oz cans of frozen OJ in my freezer but than double checked the recipe and it turned out wonderful!! :)

I wanted to make this a little more healthy and a little less orangey, so I used 1/2 gallon pineapple sherbert, 1/2 gallon sugar free, fat free vanilla ice cream, a can of frozen OJ, and 2, 2 liters of diet sprite, makes a big batch.  Made it for a party in my punch bowl and everyone loved it! :)  SOOOOO Good!  Lotsa compliments!  Could not tell this was healthy!

This punch was a hit!  I figured with everything else there was to drink, I'd have some left over - no such luck - it was gone halfway through the party!

I give this recipe 5 stars for taste but 3 stars for appearance. The ginger ale kept separating from the range cream mixture and it was kinda embarrassing serving it to people when they had to use spoons to keep stirring to keep it mixed. Somehow i will learn how to fix this problem. I also used orange creamsicle ice cream instead of the sherbet.

I was asked to make an orange punch for Christmas and found this recipe. I thought it was going to be a little creamier than it was, so I would mix the ice cream in well with the orange juice first. I had to double the recipe to get it to fit in my large glass spout container. Everyone liked it. Thank you!

This was sooooo good!  I took it to a pot luck and didn't bring any home.  
I did add vanilla ice cream to "soften" the orange taste.  OH yum!

This punch is absolutely the best! I found this while searching the internet for punch recipes for my in-law's 50th Anniversary party. I could not keep the punch bowl filled! Everyone loved it. I will be serving this again!

I personally cannot tell you if I liked it or not because I served it at a party and it was gone before I even had a chance to try any!  I gave it a 5 because it is clearly a crowd-pleaser. I am plan on making this for my next event and I will be sure to try it before everyone gets there.

I used 50/50 Orange Sherbet and Vanilla Ice Cream. Before adding the Ginger Ale, I microwaved the mix just until it started to melt/soften. Then I mashed it with a potato masher. Finally, I added the soda. It was perfect!!

This was wonderful!  Everyone loved it, I did make sure to thaw the ice cream for a half hour before making it.  I also used pineapple-orange juice frozen concentrate and 1/4 gallon vanilla and 1/4 gallon sherbert as suggested by others!  Will definitely make again, so easy!

I made this for my 3 year old twins birthday party. We had a packed house, 10 kids, 20 adults and this was loved by all. I followed the advice of another reviewer and used half orange sherbert and half vanilla. It really was a dream punch!

I made this recipe, used half orange sherbet and half vanilla ice cream, for a military retirement party and it was a huge hit. Everyone kept saying it was the best punch they'd ever had, and it was!  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Everyone enjoyed this quite a bit. It was a bit sweet (to me) but tasted great. I've made it with ginger ale and 7-Up and both work great. I like using the rainbow sherbet more than just the orange, but either way it's yummy.

This is much better than the fruit punch that normally gets served at showers.  I agree that it is best if you get the orange sherbet that is swirled with vanilla ice cream!

This was excellent!  I had just bought an antique punch bowl from a junk shop and just had to use it right away.  But it's so big I had to double the recipe, which came out perfect!  After the kids went to bed, the adults added a little vodka to the punch and nothing went to waste!!

This is a fabulous-tasting and super easy punch that I served at my daughter's wedding and a friend's bridal shower.  The regular orange sherbet is definitely better than the orange sherbet/vanilla swirl ice cream.

This is fabulous punch!  I made this for 75 people and they drank it all!  They were coming back for 2nd, 3rd and 4th helpings.  My only suggestion is to make twice as much for a crowd of 150.

I made this punch, altering a little. I used 2 Great Value Orange Sherbets (49 oz each) & 2 Blue Bunny vanilla ice creams (49 oz each).  One 12oz. can of frozen orange juice.  Let them soften and add three 2 liter bottles of Canada Dry Ginger Ale.  Be sure to have a big bucket to make this in or cut recipe in half.

I made two batches for a 80th birthday party with about 100 of people in attendance.  We had other beverage options too, but everyone kept coming back for more punch.  I'll definitely make it again.

I used a beverage dispenser and ended up with a lot of froth after the punch was depleted.  Don't try adding ginger ale to the froth, it will not make more punch.  Dump it out and add more punch that has been mixed up with the above ingredients.

Wow, this was delicious!  I made a double batch for my 13 old daughter's Christmas party and it was all gone before the party was over.  I even had 13 old boys asking for the recipe :)  I did as others suggested and only used 1/2 the sherbert and added vanilla ice cream too!

Really tasty  but may not be visually appealing - the sherbert and ginger ale make a weird looking foam. 

I would probably put less sherbert and more ginger ale next time. It was a bit too creamy for my liking.

I recently made this for a Halloween party I hosted! I called it "Witches Brew"! It was a HUGE hit, there wasn't a drop left!! I used a sherbert ice cream that had vanilla in it, it was perfect! I'm going to make it again for my son's 1st birthday party.

This is sooo easy and sooo delicious! Made it for a football party and it was a fabulous hit!  And it was ORANGE for University of TN -- Go Big Orange!!  I found out that if I mash the  frozen OJ in the bottom of the punch bowl first, then put in the softened sherbet and ice cream (I used 1/2 orange sherbet + 1/2 vanilla bean ice cream = YUM!!) , it mixed much better as I poured in the soda. (I used Sprite as I enjoy Sprite more than 7UP).  It is one of the best and easiest recipes I've ever had!

Super easy to make and absolutely delicious. 
I used Breyers Creamsicle ( orange plus vanilla) as suggested by many reviewers. The punch was big hit with kids and adults alike. The adults enjoyed it with a dash of bacardi as well. I let the icecream and frozen juice thaw completely before carefully adding the gingerale, but it frothed up a lot initially and had me all worried.  Within half an hour though, the froth settled a bit and all was good. I will have to figure out a way to mix the gingerale in without it frothing so much.  I had some frozen sliced oranges that I wanted to add for visual appeal, but skipped it due to the froth. 
Definitely making this again, this ones a keeper.

Fabulous!  Made according to recipe, and it was perfect.  Luckily, I purchased extra ingredients, as I had to make a second batch... the first batch was consumed in minutes.  May try variations next time, as others mentioned in the other reviews.

Made this for a bright orange and pink themed baby shower.  Floated a rubber ducky on top of it.  Made the recipe exactly as written.  Had to make 2 batches.  Even though there were plenty of other beverages there, this punch went very fast and everyone commented how good it was.

The recipe as-is is really more of a float than a punch. However, after a couple small adjustments everyone was raving about it! As many other reviews said, I used half sherbet, half vanilla ice cream. Instead of frozen orange juice, I used pineapple orange juice to keep it from being too orange-y. Then, It was too thick to come out of the dispenser, so I doubled the ginger ale, which also helped to balance out the flavors. I made four batches of it during the graduation party, and it was great and easy to refill. If you want to add alcohol, I would definitely suggest any rum or Malibu.
