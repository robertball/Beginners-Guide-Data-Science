This was a tasty, easy recipe that can easily be played around with. I made with whole-wheat spaghettig and omitted the onion and used a bit more cinnamon, garlic and nutmeg than listed. I also used low-fat mozzerella instead of goat cheese as that is what I had on-hand. Will make again.

This was delicious.  Though I did make some changes based on the ingredients I had on hand.  I used penne pasta and 1 whole red onion.  I mixed the pumpkin ( I used about 20 oz) with the onion and garlic and then added enough chicken stock and half-and-half to make it the proper constistency (no where near 2 C chicken stock).  I used only a pinch of cinnamon and it was still way too much, tasted like pumpkin pie.  I ended up making it a little too spicy trying to mask the cinnamon taste.  Just before it was finished I mixed in about 1/4 C fresh grated parmesan and about 6 oz skim ricotta that I needed to use up.  This would have been a five-star recipe without the cinnamon, which is how I will make it in the future.  Thanks!

I really didn't like the sauce, but I gave the recipe four stars because my dislike was due to my taste. I decided I REALLY do not like pumpkin! It was very different, and I just couldn't get used to it. If you are looking for something different to try, you might like this, or you might not. How will you know if you don't try?! :D

Overall quite good. I don't know how the goat cheese is supposed to be "Frugal" I thought it rather pricey. Next time I may substitute cream cheese instead, or just omit. Don't think it really added anything.

This was a really easy and very tasty recipe.  I made it with twisty pasta and served it with peas and it was a big hit. The only comment that I have is that it makes WAY more than four servings.  But who doesn't love leftovers?

Neither great nor horrible.  The kids wouldn't eat it.  I used Feta because that's what I had.  Maybe more Feta would make it better.  Overall, it just needed to be more robust.

This came out really bland and I had to spice it up quite a bit!  I added more hot sauce, cinnamon, nutmeg, and added a bit of pumpkin pie spice and ginger.  I just could not get it to say, "WOW."  Definately not bad.  I also added a can of white beans.  I enjoyed it, but not outstanding.

The pasta sauce didnt have very much taste to it.  I had to douse it with parmesan cheese and even then I still wasnt a fan.  I dont think I'll be making this one again.

I read the reviews before making this and did make some changes to suit our tastes (I always do). The end result was quite good. In fact, I'm on my way to make it again! The big changes I made is that I added ground beef and sauteed that with the (extra) onions and garlic. I omitted the cinnamon and added some sage instead. This is a pretty frugal meal--with the exception of the goat cheese--and is a nice change from traditional spaghetti.(Do NOT substiitute feta. Totally different flavor.)

Delicious! I substituted spaghetti for the pasta, which worked wonderfully. I also substituted canned coconut milk for the cream and cream cheese for the goat cheese. I added a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg, also. I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken.

This was really yummy! I needed to use up the other half of a big package of goat cheese and use what we had it the house. It was quick and easy and because I buy the goat cheese at BJs it was indeed frugal! My hubby and kiddos loved it, so it is now in our dinner rotation! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly, as I always do on the first shot - no offense to the author, it just wasn't "my thing" - nothing to do with the recipe itself.  Some at the table really enjoyed it.

I am very picky with sauces and I loved it! Only changes I didn't have fat free half and half so used 1% milk and 3/4 cup nonfat yogurt. I probably used 2-3 oz of goat cheese as the full 8 oz would have packed on the calories and fat. With the reduced amount of goat cheese and addition of nonfat plain yogurt the sauce was still creamy, not too rich. Served on top of spaghetti squash yum! Will make again.
