We LOVED this soup! 
I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. 
I used pre-cooked deli rotisserie chicken. 
I didn't have V8 juice, so I used 1/2 cup beer & 1/2 cup tomato sauce. (which oddly DID taste a lot like V8 to me alone... or maybe clamato?) 
We love spicy so I added a teaspoon of chili garlic sauce. 

I also didn't need to use two pans! Cooked the onions right in my sauce pan. No problem, less dirty dishes!

YUM and thank you!

My family really liked this! I cheated a little and use a pre-cooked deli rotisserie chicken to save some time. I have some picky eaters who are not really into spicy foods so I only used half the jar of sauce and it was delicious! I will make this again. :)

Tasty! I also had rotisserie chicken, leftover from last nights dinner.  I didn't have V-8 so I used a blob of tomato paste and added lots of extra liquid because I also threw in some rice.  I tailored a few other things based on what was in my kitchen (organic frozen corn, a spoonful of organic chicken base), and added cumin and S&P as suggested in the note.  I forgot we used the last of the tortillas the other day, so I garnished with a little sour cream, cheese, chopped cilantro, and avocado. Very yummy.

This recipe is tasty, and so fast to put together!  I also used the rotisserie chicken, and used pre-made tortilla strip garnishes.  Start to finish this took me a max of 20 minutes.  It makes a lot of soup, and is going to become a keeper for those nippy fall/winter nights!

I'd like to give this soup 10 stars, it was fantastic!!!  I used chicken stock in place of the water and bullion, and added some steamed white rice for a heartier soup.  Leftovers the next day were great too!

Picked up sauce on clearance, researched recipes, used this one. Used boneless chicken thighs as I like the flavor. Ez, ez, ez and delicious. Makes quite a bit and topped with all the fixin's, is awesome. Served with unsweet cornbread and flour tortillas as sides. Good grief, am full. Don't forget some tecate or modelo negro to drink for the big kids.

This soup was awesome!  I like spicy foods.  So I used the whole jar of the Herdez cooking sauce.  Also, I used a can of diced tomatoes and chilies instead of just diced tomatoes.  Since I did not have any V-8, I used a tomato salsa and added water to it.  Also, based on the author's footnote, I added some cumin and garlic powder.  It was delicious.  It would go great with the Herdez Mexican Corn Bread.
