I tried this recipe with a few of my own twist. My family loved it. I omitted the cream corn. Cooked everything separate and added it all together later.

I didn't make any changes and it was a nice dish on a cold winter night.  My six year old grandson had two servings.  I will make it again.

Tastes just like Memère's! I like to sprinkle the top with a little paprika and parsley to jazz it up.

I make this the easy way my mother always made it. Place the hamburger meat  topped with a sliced onion in a casserole dish. Bake til the hamburger is cooked. In the meantime cook and mash the potatoes. When the meat is done break it up. Top it with a can of corn and the mashed potatoes. Sometimes I put cheese on top. Put it in the oven for twenty more minutes and serve.  Serve with ketchup. Never any leftovers,

Made this dish because I had left over ribs the night before. Wanted a recipe I can make to use the meat. Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. My 5 boys LOVED this dish and the best part... it was easy to make. I’ll be making this again for sure.

I'll add this to my standard dinner list. It's old fashioned comfort food! The picture has cheese on top, which I didn't add. I made it with ground turkey and it turned out great!

Substituted onions for steam microwave broccoli. Beef broccoli and then corn mixture.  Finished off with cheddar cheese once out of the oven. 

*** Found out the hard way. Not suitable for my 2yr old. Must be prepared for food messes in and on everything: floor, hair, clothes ...***

This is the shepherd's pie I grew up on. My grandma was French Canadian. I always wondered why all of the other shepherd's pies were so different than the one I'm used too.
