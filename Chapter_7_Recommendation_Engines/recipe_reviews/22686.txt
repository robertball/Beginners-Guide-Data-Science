I used just the cooking method with this recipe but used my own bbq sauce. I added some beef bouillon cubes and 2 tablespoons of vinegar to the water.  After simmering for 2 hours, I drained and removed as much fat from the beef as I could.  I then smothered the meat with my bbq sauce and broiled it. Also added hot sauce just before serving.  They turned out very tender and my family LOVED them.

This is a very easy way to get tender ribs! The only thing I do differently ..instead of broiling them, I finish them on the grill! Delicious!

Outstanding after the greasy mess I had with trying to just broil beef ribs.  As a suggestion you can add carrots and quarter large potatoes 30 minutes to the pot before the ribs are done. Also what a crime to let all that great beef broth go to waste. After ribs are broiled you can add the big old left over bones back to the pot and simmer for a while then strain for some absolutly awesome broth.

Wow-yum! Great to find a recipe that cuts some of the fat and calories out of cooking with short ribs. I was afraid the consistency of ribs would be funky from boiling, but after broiling with sauce they came out fork tender. The sauce was great- good and sticky on the meat. I used boneless short ribs. My husband loved them, too. Will make again, and I am picky!

Melt in your mouth fabulous when I followed a previous reviewers suggestions: add beef bouilion and 2 tsp vinegar to boiling water and use your own sauce. When you do that and follow the instructions in this recipe you end up with ribs that disappear faster than a snowflake on a Georgia sidewalk!

This was the most god awful recipe I have ever made.  First, the bones all fell out after simmering for 2 hours resulting in little blobs of beef in a pot.  I decided to go ahead with the recipe and baste and broil the meat.  The meat was tender but the "barbeque" sauce was disgusting and unappetizing. I would never, ever make this again nor would I suggest it to anyone ele.  Makes me mad that I had to throw away 4lbs of meat.

I made this recipe for my tailgate party.  These are serious tailgaters who compete to see who
does the best job.  These ribs were a super hit!  They are extremely easy to make
and come out tender and tasty.

I used stone ground mustard in place of powdered mustard.  And, I boiled the short ribs for 4 hours in a slow cooker instead of the dutch oven... they turned out great! Very tender and lots of flavor.

Reviewers who completely change the recipe and report on their own outcome are not reviewing the recipe!  I made these ribs exactly according to the instructions.  They were tender and totally delicious, thanks to the WONDERFUL sauce!  I am very fussy about food and seldom give 5 stars.

This recipe was very easy to make and the flavor was good.  Next time I am going to increase the sauce.  I like my barbeque to be a little wetter.  But overall this was a quick, simple nice tasting main dish.

Positively superb! I have a few excellent recipes in my file for small bones that I favor. This one FAR exceeds them all. I didn't change a single thing, because I don't feel it's fair to do that and then render an opinion. Donna, this recipe is restaurant worthy as is - thank you!

Delicious!, Next time I am going to use 1/4 c molasses to make a little less sweet & then will make sure when I turn them over to brush more sauce.

Oh my God... soooo good.  I loved this cooking method- so easy and the texture of the short ribs was just perfect.  I did take the advice of other reviewers used 1/2 water, 1/2 beef broth and 2 Tbsp of vinegar (I used cider vinegar) for the simmering liquid.  I also used my own spicy barbecue sauce.  It was out of this world.  My boyfriend commented that it was restaurant quality... I don't get sick of hearing that!!

I gave this 5 stars because I'm a beginning cook. 

1) Used a crock pot. I simmered 6 beef short ribs on high for 1 hour then reduced to low for another 4, another 2 or 3 would've done but I was running errands that day. I removed the ribs with tongs and poured all the sauce on top and broiled for 15 mins. They were very tender and very tasty!

2) I like alot of sauce. The recipe for this sauce seemed sufficient for 6 small short ribs. I think if I would've cooked 4 lbs of short ribs, I would need to at least double the recipe. That doesn't take away from the tastiness. I loved that I made my own sauce and I could even taste a small zing of lemon. Pretty cool!

We had these at Olive Garden last weekend and I decided I wanted to make my own. They cooked perfectly and were better than restaurant. Short ribs are not inexpensive, but for a special treat, well worth the investment. Crispy and sticky - these are just delicious!!

Loved these ribs.  I didn't have all the ingredients for the sauce so I just used bottled barbecue sauce and added a little brown sugar, ketchup and garlic.  My husband loved it, but even better my absolutely picky three year old asked for seconds.

These turned out absolutely amazing! Only broiled them about 10 minutes. Really have to keep an eye on them to make sure they don't burn!

A little time consuming but easy to prepare.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of finishing them on the grill.  They came out tender and flavorful.  The molasses sauce was delicious and I would make it again.

So, friends gave me some shortribs, and I've never cooked them before. This recipe looked pretty good, so I tried it. I'm not really sure what a dutch oven is, but I followed others advice and used my crockpot. I covered the ribs in water and set it on low for 4 hours.  Made the sauce, but didn't have any garlic powder, so I used fresh garlic minced. It was delicious! I probably broiled them for about 10 minutes, 5 on each side.

I loved this meal - super easy to prepare.  I used boneless short ribs and cut them in half.  Normally I brown meats before slow cooking, so I was a little apprehensive about boiling these.  But they turned out just fine.  I really enjoyed the molasses sauce, and I'm not a big molasses fan (BF thought it was so-so).  We also tried several of our bottled favorites:  teriyaki was good, Sweet Baby Rays (vadalia onion) was super, and Open Pit (honey) was great; Jack Daniels (brown sugar) and Sweet Baby Rays (honey) were good but nothing special, in our opinion.  It was nice to try something different and I'll definitely make them this way again with the molasses sauce - yum.  Only changes I made:  added 1T of balsamic vinegar and 3 beef bouillon cubes in the boiling water.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing it!

My family really loves this recipe.  I boil the ribs in one can of beer and enough water to cover them for about 20min (so that they are not completely cooked through, I fine that is more than enough for boneless ribs) and then I broil them as directed.  They come out juicy and tender.

I tried this recipe exactly the way it was given and it was wonderful!  My husband said it was the same as going to a nice BBQ restaurant and ordering theirs.  I boiled them the night before and just refrig them, then the next night I took the out and made the sauce and it was a quick week night meal.  Very very good recipe.  I did use mild brer rabbit molasses, not the original, if that even made any difference.

This recipe is easy to make.  I was a "Camp Cook" and made them for hungry men who all loved them.

Wow! Dad loved these, and they were fool-proof, perfectly cooked and easy too! We just used bottled sauce though.

I love short ribs and I like them pretty simple without a bunch of sauce so this was perfect.  I put them in the crock pot on low with beef broth and garlic for 4 1/2 hrs.  I didn't use much of the sauce because I love the flavor of the ribs themselves.  I broiled for about 5-7 min to crisp up.  Delish!!!

Very good. I used homemade chili sauce instead of catchup and cooked in a crock pot  a few hours. We didn't even wait until dinner to chow them down.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but we thought it was just okay.  The meat was tender, but a little dry, and the flavor was comparable to a bottled barbecue sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly.

After countless attempts to make my own barbeque sauce I have finally found the one!  This sauce tastes exactly like the kind I buy in the grocery store so now I can finally make it at home.  Thanks!  As for cooking the meat, I used 3 lbs of boneless short ribs and I didn't boil it for 2 hours.  I always boil my ribs first to make them tender but I only boil them for 1 hour; afterall, the oven will finish cooking them.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Tried this with apprehension because I'd never made ribs before and was really concerned about disappointing the family who's used to my mom's ribs...  Well, after a VERY successful rib dinner, I'm being asked to make these again.

Thank you!!!

This recipe was great. . .easy and tasty. However, I found the amount of lemon to be too much so I would have the lemon juice or maybe use 2 tablespoons of cider vinegar instead.  But thank you for the way to produce "fall apart" ribs with little work.

I added vinegar, extra mustard powder, worch.sauce, Carolina Treat barbeque sauce & red pepper flakes to the sauce because I found it entirely too sweet and without kick.  Next time I would cut the molasses a lot.  I also like pork barbeque a lot better than beef.

This was GOOD.  Had a little extra catsup left so used about 1/8 to 1/4 c extra.  We used ground Arbol chile powder, instead of typical chile powder, and got a nice, light, "bite" as a result.  Meat fell off the bone!  Wife and I both love it.  Will  certainly do it again.  Whenever we can get good ribs.

I am not a fan of BBQ Sauce and this is just far enough from that to be delicious.  I brushed the ribs every few minutes and turned them often to keep them from burning, just as the directions stated.  The directions are clear and concise and, if followed, will create a delicious change from ordinary short ribs.  
Every rule in the kitchen is TASTETASTE before everything else.  In this case, I followed the recipe to a "T" both times.  I was able to leave the ribs in the fridge after I broiled them and reheated them the next day.  They were even better the second day.  This recipe is 5-star good enough for my library so I will make it often.

Did as others recommended used beef broth, water and apple cider vinegar for the water bath and simmered for two hours. Never having made short ribs before I don’t know if this made a difference or not but enough people said they did it so I tried it. When done I removed from broth, covered with sauce and grilled for a couple of minutes. They  came out pull-apart tender and my super picky husband who is used to my very different homemade barbecue sauce liked these very much. Will definitely make again.

I used my own BBQ sauce mostly 'cause I'm lazy. Meat was very tender--i used ribs with bones & meat was very tender. Best ribs I've had without a grill.

This recipe is phenomenal! I make it allll the time, especially if my son is coming over because he can't get enough of that sauce! Super easy and I don't change a thing. I use the BBQ or the oven broiler and it turns out perfect every time. Thank you!

I made the recipe almost exactly except I had to substitute honey for the molasses and I added 4 tsp of beef bullion to the water.  It was great!  Next time I want to try grilling them instead of broiling.  I'm sure it will turn out just as yummy!

Such a delicious dish. I was a bit worried since I hadn't simmered meat before, but it turned out so juicy. Did what many people did and mixed half water and beef broth with 2 tbs of apple cider vinegar. Will use less ketchup next time, but loved the dish

THIS WAS SOOOO GOOD!  I slow cooked them in crockpot for four hours and let set in juice till ready for broiling.  I had to substitute honey for the molasses (didn't have any); and added some chipotle chili pepper and onion powder.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Amazing recipe!  I made this with 1 1/2 lbs of boneless beef short ribs instead and did what others suggested, in the boiling water, I added 3 beef bouillon cubes (mixed and dissolved first with 3 c. boiling water, and added 2 tsp white vinegar).  Since I had only 1 1/2 lbs of ribs only simmered 1 hour instead of 2 hours.  Followed the rest of the recipe as is with ingredients and instructions.  Will make this again for sure.  Thank you!

Delish! I boiled the ribs in a lidded crockery pot in the oven; then finished with the broiler. Great bar-b-que sauce here too. Fork-tender ribs. I would serve this for guests any day.

Made exactly as written.  Everyone loved it. The meat was fork tender and the sauce was full of flavor. I used an oiled cast iron grill pan for  broiling. Baste throughout.  I also had plenty of broth left over from the boil. Will use for soup. Fantastic!

I thought the meat was a bit dry I may have broiled it too long. I also just used sweet baby Ray BBO sauce. 
Will try again

Great, easy recipe for total deliciousness!  After reading reviews, I cut down the molasses to 1/4 cup.   I wasn't ready to cook the short ribs after boiling, so I marinated them in the sauce for about an hour before putting then on the grill for about 10 minutes.  I brushed them with the remaining sauce a couple of times while grilling.  The flavor and texture were perfect.

The short ribs were great cooked in this manner. They were very tender, but I did use a vey hot grill to get a crust on the meat instead of the broiler. Like some of the other reviewers stated, I used the last thirty minutes or so of the meat simmering to cook some new potatoes. Can't wait to eat this again.

These were great!
I followed the recipe as written, though used a regular stock/pasta pot to boil the meat.  Such quick & easy prep.  I will be making these again.

I tried this recipe last night, I did read some of the reviews and took some advice.  I boiled in water and beef stock, but only for an hour.  I added a pinch of red pepper flakes and a couple dashes of soy sauce to the BBQ sauce.  Very very very good - exact sweetness I was looking for.

Oh my goodness this was soooooo good.  I wasn't sure it would turn out okay because I had to make adjustments based on what I had in my kitchen. I searched Allrecipes as well as googling to try to get answers to my questions, with no luck.  So I had to cross my fingers and hope it worked out.  I wanted to pass on to anyone in the same dilemma that certain substitutions worked just fine for me.  I didn't use beef short ribs, but instead went with pork spare ribs.  I don't own a dutch oven so used my cheap crockpot for the same amount of time on low.  I did have to turn the ribs halfway through since they weren't completely submerged.  Lastly, I used maple syrup instead of molasses, which probably resulted in thinner sauce, but it was still very good.  Hope my tale helps and thanks to Donna for such a delicious recipe.

This was such a fabulous tasting dish! My husband just drooled over every bite. The 2 things that I did differently is that I took the advice of another user and added vegetable bouillon (I would of added beef but didn't have any) while the ribs simmered and I added 1/2 tsp and a pinch of cayenne pepper for a nice kick. Excellent!!

YUMMERS! This recipe was super easy and delicious! I was worried that all that boiling, and then broiling, would cause the ribs to be overcooked, but they were tender and yummy!
For the sauce, I substituted honey for molasses, because I didn't have any molasses on hand. 
My husband's only complaint was that the sauce has a lot of sugar -- all that honey and ketchup -- and he's trying to limit sugar. So next time I might try a soy-based sauce, such as I've tried before in the slow cooker. But, this cooking technique worked great!

I liked the method of cooking the meat. It was really soft. I didn't love the flavor, but my husband liked it a lot. I did boil the meat with about 2 tsp. beef broth in the water and I added cornstarch (mixed with water) to the sauce. I think next time I'll try a different sauce with this cooking method. Thanks Donna!

The barbeque sauce was ok, but the meat turned out horribly.  I was so excited about this one too, because my husband loves short ribs.
