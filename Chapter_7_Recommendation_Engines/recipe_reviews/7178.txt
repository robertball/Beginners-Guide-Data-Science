I used to work in a Jewish Bakery. You should roll out the dough and then pinch to form a circle. Also, let the bagels rise for at least 1-2hrs after forming, this will enable them to take shape and not look so narly. I think 9 bagels for this amt. of dough is too much. Make 6, so they are big. The flavor was good, and its a fun thing to do with your kids, but I will stick to the bakery. Thanks for the recipe though, it was fun:)

This recipe is fantastic!  I increased the water to 1 1/8 cups as suggested by other reviewers. We love Panera Asiago Cheese bagels, so I added 1/2 cup shredded asiago cheese to the dough, shaped them, let them rise for 30 minutes (great tip!), boiled them, then topped each with a little more shredded asiago cheese.  My husband said if he didn't know I made them, he would have thought they came from the bagel shop!  Since the original recipe made 9 large bagels, which are pretty big, I made them again, and divided it to make 12.  They were a little smaller, but a better portion for us.  I'll be making this recipe again and again!

Revised: These were just like the bagels I used to get in Boston. I always double this recipe which means I have to use my kitchen aid instead of my bread machine. I let the dough rise for a 1/2 an hour, punch it down and repeat. After making the bagels into their shape I let them sit for an hour to make sure they are nice and fluffy. I usually get 9 large bagels. I used 2 tbs of molasses in the water instead of sugar. I also used olive oil glaze because the egg had a funny after taste

My husband loves these.  I must admit, however, that I can't (or won't) follow directions.  I made whole wheat cinnamon raisin bagels as follows:
I used 2T of Splenda instead of the sugar in the beginning.  I then tried to make them healthier by using 1 1/2c of whole wheat flour and 1/2c of wheat germ.  I mixed it all in my Kitchenaid.  Once it had all pulled together I added 1c of white bread flour about 1/4 c at a time until the whole cup was mixed in.  I then added 2t of cinnamon and 3/4c of raisins.  I let that all rise in a warm oven (covered) 30 minutes.  I shaped them into balls, stuck a finger in the middle and placed them back in the warm oven (covered) for another 1/2 hour.  I then boiled them in water with 3T blackstrap molasses as someone else recommended.  I think you could probably get away with only 1T.  I'll try that next time.  I boiled them closer to 2 minutes each.  I realized too late I didn't have any cornmeal so I just sprayed the pan real well and it was fine.  I also forgot all about the egg wash which was fine too.  Watch your baking time as mine didn't need 20 to 25 minutes.

I make these bagels every couple of weeks and they really are easy and delicious.  My only trouble was shaping them, so now I just cut them in even squares and poke a hole in the middle.  They come out a little square but I'm not entering any contest for the roundest bagel.

Very good!  I tripled the recipe, but only made 18 bagels with it.  They were a great size.  I made them in my KitchenAid mixer (not in a bread machine) like I make all my breads.  Very yummy and chewy.  They were really easy to make, as well.  Just a note:  They do rise in the boiling water and in the oven, so you might want to make the center hole quite large.

This is the PERFECT bagel recipe! My husband and I could not believe how delicious they were and they tasted better than our local "Gourmet Bagel" shop. I made cinnamon raisin bagels by kneading in 1/2 cup of raisins and about 1 tbsp of cinnamon after I took the dough out of the bread machine.  I could not believe how easy these were to make!  We will be making them all the time and will not be wasting money on freezer or grocery store bagels, these are SO much better!  Can't wait to try some with asiago cheese baked in.  Mmmmm!

I have made these bagels several times now and they always turn out wonderful.  Like most other people recommended I have increased the water to 1 1/8 cups and halved the quantities of both sugar and salt.  I found that watching the bagel rolling video on YouTube was a great help, but I now cheat and use a medium cookie dough cutter to cut the bagel and then a very small round cutter to cut out the whole in the middle, to almost perfect results.  I do find that the whole process takes a little too long to make from start to finish for breakfast, so I started freezing the dough.  I make the dough as usual and cut in to shape, but before allowing the dough to rise.  I place the bagels on a baking tray and freeze.  Once the bagels have frozen I transfer them to a plastic container, using wax paper in between the layers. (I can usually get 3 layers in my containers). Then I can take out the desired number of bagels and thaw them in the microwave for 50 seconds on full power.  I then let them rise in a warm place for 20 minutes.  (I always heat the oven to 200 degrees for 2 minutes, before turning the oven off and placing the dough inside to rise).  Then continue with the rest of the recipe, I boil each bagel for 1 minute on each side, glaze with the egg white and then cover with Asiago cheese and bake for 20-25 minutes, perfect!!!

These bagels are just as good as Panera or Einstein.  I make 8 and let them rise more like 20 minutes.  My first topping choice was a combo of onion flakes, coarse salt, sesame seeds and poppy seeds.  We added 2t of cinnamon to our second batch and topped with cinnamon sugar.  We're going to try mocha chocolate chip  next.  I may never have a reason to go to the bagel shop again!  Thanks for publishing this one!

This is the first bagel recipe I have ever tried.  I am Canadian but live in the U.K. where you can't get a decent bagel.  I thought this recipe was excellent.  I often put cheese on the top and have also tried them plain.  I tried putting the cheese inside but found that it ruined them.  I also only ever make 6 because I like mine a little bigger.  Wonderful recipe!!!

These are terrific!  Very easy and excellent flavor.  I made 9 as the recipe said, and I topped each with cinnamon sugar, onions, or sesame seeds.  I won't be going back to the bagel place...:)

This has become one of my favorite recipes too.  I tried something that I wanted to share.  After the bread machine cycle finished, I put the dough in a bowl and put it in the fridge overnight.  The dough was so easy to handle in the morning.  I shaped my bagels and let rise, then boiled for 2 minutes on each side, and baked as directed.  They were fantastic!  I was just looking for a quicker way to make these in the morning and it worked perfectly!  I also sauteed finely chopped onion and garlic and added it to the bread machine almost at the end of the cycle (my machine beeps at a certain point, telling you this is the time to add any additional ingredients).  I also brush with butter before baking instead of the egg wash.

I have a practical alternative for this recipe that makes 1-2 loaves of flavorful bread without the bagel forming/boiling step. For each cup of flour use 1 tblsp + 1 tsp sugar. After the last machine rise form the dough into 1-2 french bread shaped loaves and lay them out on a non-stick sheet sprinkled with corn meal. Let rise 1 hr. Wet crust with spooned water. Oven bake at 375 for 25-30 min. No bagel shaping or boiling. The add'l sugar makes up for the sugar that was in the boiling water. I cool, slice up then freeze the loaves. Earlier observations 7/2009: I am on my fourth batch. First time, followed recipe exactly. Came out good. The bagel flavor is great. The gnarly form is better because the crust has more surface to brown and this is where the flavor and chewy texture is. For the 2nd batch I used half wheat flour and it took over the great bagel flavor. It became a tough wheat bread not at all what I choose bagels for. The third batch I used milk instead of water. This also adversely changed the texture and flavor. All future batches are going back to following the recipe. I have noticed most people saying anything bad about this recipe are not actually following it. If you alter the ingredients don't ding the recipe for your experiments. The only change I would recommend is lightly coating the bagels with an oil or original PAM while they rise before boiling. This enhances the crust. Otherwise follow this recipe exactly and you will have a batch of delicious bagels.

I've tried this recipe several times and have gotten mixed results.  I've learned not to let the dough rise too long - definitely not over an hour - because the dough falls flat immediately when touched.  But then I found Allrecipes' guide to FORMING AND BAKING BAGELS.  I highly recommend this guide.  I used the same dough recipe here, making it cinnamon/raisin, and for the rest of the recipe I followed the guide.  It makes a far more impressive and perfect bagel.  I had to make the dough at night and formed the bagels, then put it in the fridge.  I think letting it sit overnight may have help the shaping to gel beautifully, then I boiled and baked in the morning.  What a way to spoil your family!

I keep forgetting to rate these.  The first couple of times I made these they tasted wonderful but my shape was way off.  I decided to cut them like I would for a rolled out round cookie.  Made a world of difference.  I let them rise for around 30 minutes and used the dowel end of a wooden spoon to poke a hole direct into the center.  I then twirled around the dowel.  Perfect bagel shape.  I also quit adding the eggwash.  I went instead by the directions on Allrecipes and put what ever flavors I wanted after boiling on top.  Came out perfect.  My 3 year old granddaughter loves making up different flavors to make with her "Nonnie"  She made apple cinnamon last week.  These are a hit.  Thanks

Great recipe.  I've made it several times.  One tip from another site really helped with these.  It said to boil the bagels until puffy.  Once I did that with this recipe (instead of timing them) they turned out much better in appearance.

I dont think I've seen this comment yet, so here goes... VERY important to use bread flour as stated. I used all purpose the first time. Tasted good, but looked ugly. Tried a second time, same results. Purchased bread flour, and goodness! What a difference! Looked GORGEOUS and tasted better than with AP flour. So there you go, tastes fine with AP, but use bread flour for better taste and appearance. Enjoy!

I'll never buy bagels again. I made this recipe with 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour. I added 3 TBS wheat gluten, and increased the water by 1/4 cup. As another reviewer suggested, rather than poking a hole in the middle, I rolled the pieces into ropes and then pinched them closed. Then, as others suggested, I let them raise 30 minutes. It's important not to let the bagels boil any longer than 60 seconds before removing them from the water. BEAUTIFUL!

they turned out perfect as promised, I didn't change a thing except the egg wash, which I substituted with milk, brushing them just before baking so that the poppyseeds stay put. Wonderful recipe, so very effortless and quick!

Wow!  This was SUPER EASY to do and very yummy!  I altered the recipe to make orange cranberry bagels for Thanksgiving day breakfast.  I replaced the water with 3/4 c. orange juice and 1/4 c. water and warmed it up in the microwave before putting it in to the bread machine.  I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 can cranberry sauce.  They turned out AMAZING and left the house smelling so good!  I served the bagels with home made apple butter and cream cheese whipped w/orange zest and sugar.  My sweetie wants me start making them all the time!

This recipe is one of my favorite ways to use my bread machine. Shaping bagels takes practice but after making this recipe almost every week I think my bagels look just as good shape-wise as the store bought ones. Adding rosemary, Italian seasoning, and 1/4 - 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar about 10 minutes into the cycle makes a really yummy cheddar and herb bagel. Making bagels yourself is so so much cheaper than buying them at specialty stores.

Not only did I have TONS of fun making these bagels they turned out awesome. I made 2 cinnamon sugar, 2 plain, 2 covered with cheddar and 2 cheddar bacon. DELICIOUS EASY RECIPE. I will be making these as a weekend ritual! Thank you to all who reviewed so that the new bakers have some good guidelines and suggestions! I was sitting around with my hubby figuring out about how much money we saved making our bagels at home - I'd say for 8 we maybe spent about 30 cents. Go to Panera and spend about $3.00 or more for the same thing - - and I know where all my ingredients came from!

Unfortunately, it's not fair to rate this recipe because I didn't follow it very closely, but I'm sure it's excellent as it stands. I'm only here to give you another idea and a warning not to make the same mistake I made. The bottoms of the bagels almost burned on the cookie sheet but then I sprayed with cooking spray instead of sprinkling cornmeal. Personally, I find the baking stone works much better for this. I added 3/4 cup slivered almonds, 3/4 cup raisins and 1 tsp cinnamon to the dough, using 2 cups white and 1 cup whole wheat flour. Then instead of making bagels, I rolled out the 16 balls of dough relatively thinly, spread with a generous tablespoon of cream cheese. Added 3 banana slices to some and a very small handful of saskatoons to the rest. Fold over and you have breakfast bagel-fuls. I baked for 20 minutes. Even with 16 balls of dough, they were at least twice as big as the commercial bagel-fuls you buy. Grandkids (and everyone else) ate them up and not just for breakfast. They make a healthy (non-messy) snack while on the run to sports practice, and I was surprised at how little effort they took to make. Don't stuff them too full and you can still heat them in a wide-slot toaster.

I love these!  The first time I made them, the whole process seemed involved and cumbersome for 8 bagels (I find it easier to divide the dough in half and then each of those halves in half and then once more to end up with 8 relatively equally sized baels).  The second and third times I made them (in as many days!), I streamlined the process a bit.  I scaled up the recipe to 4 cups of flour, 1 tablespoon of yeast, etc.  I still made 8 niced sized bagels with that amount.  Follow the recipe directions for forming them--much easier and effective than rolling and pinching as suggested in one review and the result is the same (or better, because a couple of my bagels came apart at the pinch in the boiling water).  Just roll the sectioned dough into balls and flatten them a little and poke a finger through the center and stretch out.  As soon as I finished forming them, I started water boiling in a saucepan (used much less than 3 qts).  I also turned the oven on then to pre-heat, laid out towel for draining the bagels, & set up cookie sheet with corn meal.  The bagels rising for 10 min was plenty.  Bagels should not be fluffy! I set microwave timer for about 12 min and plunked the bagels in the boiling water one at a time, flipping with tongs after 30 seconds and pulling them out onto the draining towel after 60.  The timer counting down helped me keep track.  As they drained, I moved them to the cookie sheet, brushed with egg white, sprinkled on toppings and popped in oven.

These were so good, they didn't last more than half an hour after I took them out of the oven!  I made 6 bagels instead of 9, so I would have nice bakery sized bagels.  I kneaded garlic powder into one, then topped it with minced garlic and cheddar cheese.  On two others, I sprinkled kosher salt, on two others I sprinkled cheddar cheese, and I left the last one plain.  Everyone loved them.  I'll definitely make them again, but I think I'll boil them a tiny bit longer and add a bit of baking soda to the water to get an even chewier outside.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It may not be fair for me to review this recipe, as I made quite a few changes, but it was definitely the inspiration for my version.  I made this in my KitchenAid, not a bread machine, and let the yeast + water + sugar sit for 10 minutes before adding the flour.  I subbed in 1 cup of whole wheat flour for the white flour and upped the water by 1/4 cup to compensate.  Finally, I added in several 30-minute rising sessions since whole wheat flour takes longer to rise.  Glazed with an egg white + a drop of heavy cream and then sprinkled with sesame seeds, these were absolutely divine.

They turned out awesome!  I was so excited to try this recipe.  We don't eat a lot of bagels in my house, but they were so fun to make!  I topped mine with dried minced onion, poppyseeds, and sesame seeds.

I absolutely love these bagels! This was my first time making them. I assumed they would look strange and be bumpy etc. But they were not! They were really pretty and really delicious! I followed the directions, however I added an extra 1/4 cup of water to the dough. My bread maker sounded like it was killing itself... so the water was VERY important! I added sesame seeds. They were impressive! I can't get good bagels in Halifax, N.S. Now I can!

I made these this morning and they are wonderful!! I never made bagels before because I thought they would be too difficult but now I'll probably never buy them again. These are so much better than store bought ones. They are a little time consuming but not hard to do. I took the advice of another reviewer and added about 1/8 cup of water to the bread machine when it started mixing the dough. They ended up soft on the inside and chewy outside - just like I like them. I made them with "everything" but didn't think about putting spices on the bottoms. Next time I'll do that. I live at high altitude (8,100 ft) and the only change  I made, beside more water, was to bake them a little longer  (27 min). Thanks for the great recipe.

I just made these today and they are fantastic! 
I followed the advice on the reviews regarding the 1/4 - 1/2 cup extra water and letting them rise for 30 min. instead of 10. 
I made 6 large ones instead of 9. 
I need to learn how to shape them better.
I made parmesan bagels and brushed olive oil over the tops. I added 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan to the bread machine and I also topped them with Parmesan before baking. I baked them for 30 min.
They were perfect!
Very chewy inside and crispy outside.
Thank you for submitting this great recipe. 
I will be making double batches from now on.

First time I made bagels & they came out great! I made 6 instead of 9. To make the center hole I took the rubber end of a baster off & dipped that end in  flour then poked in the dough to make a hole....worked perfectly....topped bagels with onion, sesame seed, poppy seed, garlic & kosher salt. Definitely make a double batch soon!

These came out great!  I didn't have enough bread flour so I supplemented with a little all purpose and wheat.  We made everything bagels by mixing sesame seeds, poppy seeds, onion flakes, garlic powder, and salt.  I can't believe how great the taste and texture were.  I mixed cream cheese with blueberry spreadable fruit for a spread.  Even my picky 2 year old loved them.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We made these bagels today and they are terrific
We used many of the suggestions of previous cooks. 
Added 3 Tablespoons of molasses to the boiling water for a pretty color, it didn’t add sweetness to the final product.
Then instead of egg white we sprayed them with cooking spray then sprinkled garlic & sea salt on them.
We rolled the bagels out in ropes, wrapped them around our hands and pinched the ends together.  
They turned out great! Thank you very much Cristy for the recipe

These turned out beautifully! The batch I made yesterday is almost gone. I replaced 1 C. of flour with whole wheat and a little bit of oat bran. I also used 3 Tbs. wheat gluten and boiled the bagels about 30-60 sec. longer to create a chewier texture. Be sure to give them a full rise time before boiling, the ones I boiled first were more dense and firm than the ones boiled later. I did not have anything too exciting to sprinkle on top, but these were great just with a sprinkle of coarse salt. Thank you for a recipe that will be used again and again!

I have used this recipe a few times and each time they have turned out great.  I add finely chopped jalapeno peppers into the bread machine (about half way through the machine process).  My bread machine has an alert beep when you can add any additional ingredients.  Prior to baking I also shred asiago cheese on top of each bagel. Great recipe!

My kids really liked these so I guess I will be making bagels instead of buying them from now on! Since this was my first time attempting homemade bagels, I followed the recipe exactly - they came out really good but next time I will let them rise longer after forming.

I generally used this recipe although I changed it a bit because the recipe I tried prior was producing flatter bagels.  I didn't have that problem with this recipe (I'm thinking it was the 3 tablespoons of sugar in the water?)  Anyway, I made muesli bagels by adding in a cup of muesli, a half cup of sunflower seeds, and a handful of raisins and dried cranberries (I cut out about a half cup of flour).  I also used 1 and a quarter cup of water.  The bagels were amazing.  This is a good base recipe if you're experimenting with bagel-making.

These were too easy to be so good!  Seriously!  Not hard to do at all and a very tasty bagel.  I made 2 batches - one plain and the other I added lots of minced and powdered onion to the dough and more minced onion on top after I did the egg wash.  They looked so nice - just like store bought bagels.  Next time I will try cinnamon raisin.  We had these with my home made breakfast sausage patties (in my recipe box) with egg and cheese.  I will make more bagels and sausage patties and freeze them for a "quick-to-microwave-breakfast" during the week.

AMAZING!  This recipe is an "OMGoodness, I impressed myself recipe"!  No changes are needed to be made.  I didn't have bread flour so I added 3 Tbsp. of vital wheat gluten to my AP flour.  Hubby wanted cinnamon raisin bagels, so I put 1/2 cup raisins in a sauce pan, covered it with water, brought to a boil, then drained when they swelled.  Then I coated them well with cinnamon.  I added them after the dough came out of the bread machine but next time I think I'll add them sooner because they were hard to incorporate.  This recipe was so easy to do.  The times stated were perfect.  This recipe will be seen many times over in my kitchen.  I am half tempted to go start another batch.  Thank you Cristy Chu for sharing such an AMAZING recipe!

The cornmeal is perfect! I did the dough part by hand entirely. No egg white - I just let the bagels dry on the towel for about 2 minutes after boiling, and then rolled the still-damp tops in poppy seeds, cinnamon sugar and sesame seeds (3 kinds of bagels...made 3 each, total 9 as in recipe). The cinnamon ones stuck to the pan though because of the sugar but a slice with a spatula got them off fine. We will make these again! IF YOU MAKE OTHER BREADS BY HAND: These won't rise as much during the rise phase as typical yeasted breads, don't worry that's fine...apparently bagels aren't supposed to rise as much, hence the denser texture...I was all freaked out that I had killed the yeast due to the slow rising, but 1 hour rising time was fine and then I shaped and cooked them.

This was my first time with this recipe. I read the other reviews and added the extra 1/8th cup of water which this really needed. I also decided that this made 6 good sized bagels instead of 9. I prefered the look from coiling and pinching the dough to form a circle rather than poking a hole through the center. Finally I preheated my oven to 200 degrees for 2 minutes and had a second rise for 30 min after shaping the bagels.  This resulted in 6 gorgeous bagels. For 2 I covered with Parano cheese (I was out of Asiago) and the other 4 I covered with dried fried garlic I had bought at an asian specialty store. I am adding the photos of 3 of the bagels. I will defintely make these again.

I have used this recipe several times and each time it turns out great. These have become my favorite bagles- both for the appropriate serving size (not those truck-size grocery store bagles) and the ease of preparation. I've even expanded the topping options to include garlic (brown a few minced cloves in olive oil) and asiago cheese. Paired with some home prepared cream cheese using herbs from my garden, this is a little bit of heaven on earth!

These were good-  4 or 5 stars in Seattle, but only maybe 2 or 3 in NY.  Fun and easy (kids love dough...).  Added a few minutes to the cooking time to get them to brown better- also great with shredded cheddar baked onto the top, and they were excellent with Black Sea Salt baked on top as well.

I don't think I'll ever be buying bagels ever again! I've made 2 batches so far (1 cheese and one with sea salt) and my family is in love! I add baking soda when I boil them to help give them a nice texture. I would suggest placing foil on your baking sheet though, because they're very hard to get off otherwise. Awesome recipe!

These bagels are incredible!  I made them yesterday for the first time, and they turned out perfectly, even with a few changes.  I used all-purpose flour instead of bread flour, and I don't have a bread machine, so I simply used my kitchen aid mixer to do the mixing and kneading, then let the dough rest in a warm spot for about an hour.  Instead of sugar in the boiling water I used 3 T blackstrap molasses (something my mother used to do).  And since my oven is, shall we say, rather tempermental, I opted to use our programmable roaster oven (yes, the kind you roast turkeys and stuff in).  Even with all the changes, and having the kids in my in-home day care "help" me, they turned out perfectly.  My husband, who is definitely not a fan of bagels, demolished one last night and the remaining 2 for breakfast this morning--and then requested I make more!
Thanks for such an awesome recipe!!

These were the best "bread" based bagels I have ever had.  However, they don't quite compete with Montreal Style Bagels.

I did this recipe in my KitchenAid mixer, and foolishly, just threw everything in and mixed it up...if I'd been thinking more, I would have treated it like any other bread recipe in my mixer and proofed the yeast, then added the other ingredients, since I'm not using a bread machine dough cycle. But the good news is, it still worked and I have beautiful bagels. Great recipe and I'll be experimenting with this one again soon.

This was my first attempt at making bagels. They were awesome! and oh so easy (I used my new bread machine I got for Christmas). I tried one users idea of kneading blueberries in after the "dough" cycle. With my machine, that didnt work well at all. Next time I will add more towards the beginning of the mix cycle as the dough was too stiff after it had risen and I was flinging blueberries all over the place while making the bagel  hole bigger..ha ha ha. I was very impressed with this recipe and cant wait to try other variations.

I was a little skeptical, as my bread machine seemed like it was having a rough time with the tough dough. However, these turned out incredible! Husband says they are better than the ones we usually buy, and I agree. Bagels are expensive in New Zealand, so if I can make them from now on, that will save us some "dough" haha! :)

Very good.  They don't last very long so I wouldn't suggest making more then you can eat in that one sitting.

Delicious! And so easy. 

I substituted in 1 cup whole wheat flour, added 1 T cinnamon, and a box of raisins. I let them sit for half an hour after shaping, but they still weren't the most beautiful. Maybe a little more water in the dough next time? Also, very difficult to get off the baking pan, even with cornmeal. I think I'll use parchment paper next time. There WILL be a next time.

I loved this recipe as it is; I have also adapted it to my own by using multigrain flour, quinoa flakes, chia seeds, toasted sunflower seeds and ground flax. They are to die for! Now my husband doesnt want me to buy bagels any more. Atleast they are fun to make since I will be making lots.

Yummy! They turned out pretty good. I followed directions except for using molasses instead of sugar in my cooking water. However the baking length was too long and the bagels would shape easier if the dough had a bit more water in it. Overall a good first attempt at bagels though!

Excellent! I followed the recipe very closely, except making 6 instead of 9. They turned out GREAT! Far better than my first attempt a couple years ago...little hockey pucks. These are chewy, soft, tasty and pretty hassle free. Next time I'll add some flavors and spices. I just kept it really simple this time around. Oh yes, and my 6 bagels were HUGE. I think I'll make 8 or 9 next time. Might have been my yeast, and leaving them to rise for 40 minutes.

Not bad considering this was the first time making my own bagels.  They were kinda flat, which was probably my fault for manhandling the dough.  Now that I know the process, I'll try these again.  I used 1 1/8 cup water as suggested by other reviewers.  I topped some with black sesame seeds (mmm!) and others with sea salt and italian seasoning (they were yummy too!)  Oh, and I boiled them for 2 minutes instead of 1. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I'm giving it a four since i made a few changes but with them this recipe is a five! I made with half ww flour and added cinnamon and raisins to the dough. Since some reviewers said that the egg white left a weird aftertaste and i don't like the taste of olive oil, i used melted butter. After dipping them in the butter i rolled them in cinnamon sugar with nutmeg. When they baked the topping melted and created a crisp glaze! They were amazing!

These bagels are fantastic!  I've made them twice in just one week.  I made some changes:  replaced one cup of flour with whole wheat flour and used all-purpose for the other two cups,  replaced one tbsp of sugar with brown sugar, added two tbsp cinnamon, added 1/2 cup raisins to 2/3 of the dough (daughter does not like raisins), formed then into 12 mini-bagels, let the bagels sit for an hour before boiling, boiled for less than a minute, sprayed the cookie sheet and the bagels with spray canola oil, and baked for about 25 minutes. The bagels are delicious - crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside - perfect!!  And my children (aged 8 and 10) loved working with the dough and forming their own bagels.  A couple of the bagels look like a pro made them!  I would highly recommend this recipe!

Love the recipe as it is but making it your own by adding your favorite ingredients makes it the best! I've noticed a few people have had problems forming the bagels before boiling/baking them. Honestly you don't have to, just form them any way you like! Who says a bagel has to be circle? But if you want some help making the perfect bagel shape check out this video on YouTube --> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ4oYhtUriQ&feature=related

Seriously???
These are so insanely good!  I don't know how or why I hadn't tried this before!  I made 8 healthy sized bagels from the recipe.  5 cinnamon raisin and 3 rosemary olive oil.  This is a winner!

These were AWESOME.  I'm making more tonight.  I followed someone's advice and only made six, but they turned out too big to just be one serving size- this time I will stick with 9.  I did add two tablespoons of vital wheat gluten.  I topped with kosher salt... Tonight I'm going to try some cinnamon crunch bagels. Other than the vital wheat gluten though, I didn't make any changes and they turned out beautifully.  They looked and tasted professional!

Made this recipe exactly, but with only 6 bagels. I thought they were a bit too big, so next time I make them, I'll make the 9 and see how that turns out. Tasted great though!
EDIT: made with the 9, came out kind of odd looking. Still tasted great, but I'd rather make 6 and have them all big and round!

i only boil them for 10 sec each side ...been making these for 2 years now come out great every time ...i found that cutting down on the boiling time makes the bagel not stick to your teeth....it is more soft and less chewy....great basic recipe can easily add dried fruit or japs and cheddar cheese for variety of bagel flavors....thanks for this great recipe!!!

I followed the advice of the person that said they worked in a jewish bakery. My bagels did not turn out well.

I'm going to go ahead and add an extra star since I didn't follow the original recipe.

Wow! I am so excited that this recipe worked. I read through most of the reviews and did all the little things people suggested. I added more water to the dough (1/8-1/4 cup), cut the dough into 8 pieces (was easier with an even number), rolled out logs before forming them into circle shapes and then rested the bagels for 30-45 min. I boiled the bagels for a few minutes on each side before baking. They were crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle. Perfect! Next time I will double or triple the recipe (had to make sure it worked first.) I'm a PA native, living in Australia, and haven't had a decent bagel in 6 years. My kids don't even know what bagels are and what they're missing! Now I can make great bagels in my own kitchen, whenever the mood hits. Yum.

OMG!!!! This recipe is AWESOME!!!! 5 stars!!! My bread machine did have trouble mixing it, and I added a little more water. I read the reviews after I made them and I agree about 1/8 cup more water is needed in the machine. Also, did not have a big enough pot to boil 3 quarts of water, so I boiled 2 quarts + 2 tbsp. sugar. I also didn't let them rise as long as I probably should have (we were impatient). But they were perfect, and my 8yo loves them! So much better than store bought and oh-so-good hot out of the oven! Our shapes turned out a bit funky, but my 3yo and 8yo had alot of fun making these! Thanks for the post!

These are WONDERFUL!  I applied some changes other readers' suggested:  increased water 1/8th cup and let them raise 30 minutes.  I put two large cloves of garlic in the bread machine along with 1/4 cup parmesan.  When I baked them, I put olive oil on top along with more parmesan.  They baked in about 20 minutes and we were all surprised how great they turned out!

I make these bagels every 2 or 3 days and they are the best we have ever had.  I have some seasonings that are for butter such as sundried tomato and basil, and parmesan and roasted garlic, anyway I add some of that to the bagels when I divide them so that we have a variety. I also sometimes add fresh garlic and dried onion to the mix. These are so versatile you can do alomst anything with them. I wonder though how or at what time do you freeze them?

INCREDIBLE bagel recipe! So easy with bread machine doing most of work! I made 6 big bagels and gave them 30 min. to rise before boiling. Perfect! I, too, increased water by 1/8 cup. Can make night before, shaped. Then let warm to room temp, boil and bake. Can freeze after baking. Additions to dough: garlic powder then top with minced garlic and cheddar cheese; cinnamon and raisins, French fried onions, or 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes...  Sprinkle Kosher salt or Cheddar cheese on top. Some mentioned adding baking soda or molasses to boiling water to make outside more soft and give it a hint of glaze. YUM!  THANK YOU for this recipe!

I've tried making bagels at home before and these were the easiest and the most successful.  I ditto earlier reviewers's suggestions to make the holes big as they tend to shrink with rising and cooking.  I set my breadmaker up last night for the dough to be ready this morning; less than an hour later, we had fresh bagels for breakfast.  I added vital wheat gluten to make them chewier.  A keeper!

These were easy to make although I didn't use a bread machine.  I used my kitchen aid.  While these were not Bagel Store quality, it was cool to make, and they did taste quite delicious.  Just a note to you first time bagel makers like me, when they tell you to flatten the dough, make sure after you flatten it and make the hole, that you shape it into more of a bagel shape because you'll wind up with more of a flat bagel.  I expected them to rise again into a bagel shape and they didn't.  It didn't affect the taste, just the ability to slice them.  Topped mine with sesame seeds, poppy seeds, minced garlic or onion powder.  Quite delicious.  Will make this again!

Incredible!  I took other's advice and made 6 instead of 9.  I rolled the dough into a smooth rope and kneaded the ends together to make a bagel shape that I let rise for about 20-30 mins. I recalled a recipe i used once that called for pre-baking the bagels for a few minutes.  I did this at 300 degrees for 5 minutes. I boiled, brushed with eggwhite, seasoned with minced garlic, kosher salt, onion powder, poppy seeds and baked as directed. I'm gonna go have another!

These bagels are as good as everyone says they are and easy to make! The only thing I did differently was to roll the bagels out in ropes and then form a circle. It gave them a smoother appearance. My kids loved these. I will definitely make them again!

Made this recipe twice. The first time, the dough was sticky and the bagels too flat. The second time, I added less (200 ml) water. I let rise the bagels after shaping for 30 minutes and they turned out much better! The shape is nicer when you don't flatten the balls too much. Just poke a hole in it! 
Don't know how bagels normally taste (! sorry, I'm from Holland) but my husband likes them very much. I topped them with onion-seeds. (Also will try them with baked onions on top)

What a great recipe.  I've never made bagels before.  I was always intimidated by the idea.  But this recipe makes it so much easier.  The bread machine mixes the dough, then I boil and bake the bagels.  No problem.  They came out very good.  I made 6 large bagels rather than the recommended 9.  I need to improve my technique a bit to get the shape nicer, but they were delicious... maybe not quite on par with a New York bagel shop bagel, but certainly better than any supermarket bakery bagel!

A very good recipe for making bagels. I make a double batch using a Kitchenaid.  Bagels are precision baking.  Amounts, temperature and time matter. Here are changes to the standard receipe that I feel produce a better homemade bagel. 1) Increase water to 1 1/8 cup. 2) Decrease sugar by 1/3 for non-sweet bagels.  (Consider the topping or how you are serving). 3) I increase salt to a tbls. (Its an important  balance between the flour and salt that affects the taste/texture.) 4) 1st rise is 1 hour for non-breadmachine method.  2nd rise is 20-30 minutes after shaping. 5)  Use 4.4 ounce of dough per bagel, 4.7 ounce for big bagels. To improve appearance, make a ball of dough. Stretch the top by squeezing and pinching between thumb and index finger. Poke the bottom upwards with your other hand's index finger as you pinch when closing your fist. (Looks similar to holding a small balloon in a closed hand.) Gently flatten and poke a hole in the middle. Then spin around your two index fingers. The result is a smooth top and finished bottom. 6) Boil the bagel for 45 seconds each side. 7) The egg white/2 tbls of water wash is important in producing a good color. You only need one egg white even if doubling recipe. It also helps bind your topping to the bagel. Be creative with toppings. 8) Temperature is specific to your oven.  I cook 28 minutes with 2 cups of water in a preheated (hot) pan. I pass on my great respect to the fine bakers of New York and Brookline, MA that inspire us all.

So...I don't review things very often but I've been using recipes from this site for the past 5 years or so... I had to review these bagels because currently I'm an expat living abroad and haven't had access to store bought bagels in forever. So I decided to make my own. Now here's what I did. Instead of using 3 cups of bread flour I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup of all purpose flour. I just wanted it to be a bit more nutritious. The first time I didn't use warm water and that was not a good idea since the dough didn't hold together very well, the second time I made it with warm water and the dough was perfect. Another big mistake I did the first time was I didn't let the dough rest after shaping it.... (I was anxious to have the bagels...) the second time I did it (after I devoured the first batch) I let it rest the required time and it rose beautifully... basically the first batch was good but the second batch was absolutely divine. The second time I followed the instructions to the letter (with the exception of using 2 parts whole wheat flour to 1 part all purpose flour.) I also, baked them for 15 min at 375 degrees, but thats only cause I made two batches of this and wanted them to last a few days...so I figured toasting them in the morning in a toaster would make them completly browned and hot when I needed them to be...

YUM!! I basically followed the directions with the exception that I added a tbsp of baking soda and a tbsp of sugar to the boiling water. I also dunked em in an ice bath after boiling (after reading various articles on the topic on the web including the one here on allrecipes).  Oh and no bread machine here I used my Kitchen Aid mixer and dissolved the yeast in the warm water with the sugar prior to adding salt and flour. Although to me they should have been a bit denser they were delicious, chewy and soft and I will for sure make again.  I only got 9 sorta smaller bagels, next time I will try 6-7 bagels.

excellent bagels! unlike other posters, i did not make fewer bagels from this dough; i made more - eighteen to be exact. who needs a gigantic 300 calorie bagel? wanting to have some whole grain, i ground up 1/2 c. rolled oats to replace 1/2 c. flour. i also added a "glug" of molasses to the boiling water as suggested by other posters. didn't bother with the egg white (boiling the bagels in sugar water isn't to make them sweet, folks; it's to make them shiny!) about 20 minutes baking time was about right, even with the smaller size.

These were a surprise.  As my husband left this morning with his bagel sandwich, he said "wow..they taste just like bagels! "  They ended up much flatter than I would have liked but I am accounting an error I made for that.  I left out the poppy seeds and used the cornmeal for the bottom and egg for the top (really gives it a nice sheen when your done) Next time I will experiment using different herbs and seasonings for the top. There are endless possibilities here! Must try.

Wonderful. I added an extra 1/8 cup of water and also replaced 1 cup bread flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour.  I let them rest for 30 min.  Just ate one for lunch with cream cheese and ham!  So so good!

I loved these, and I can see them becoming a staple at my house.  I had one misstep, in that I forgot to add the sugar to the boiling water, so they boiled for 2 minutes.  Baked 20-25 minutes, and they still came out great.  The more I make them, the prettier they'll be, I'm sure.

Followed the recipe exactly except I added some cinnamon and raisins.  They turned out fantastic.  My husband was a little skeptical at first but after they came out of the oven I had him taste them and he loved them.

Very, very good.  I agree with the last review.  Extremely hard to get off the pan.  I will grease the pans next time.  I also added an additional 2T water per other reviewers.  Making a 2nd batch today with blueberries!

I didn't have very high hopes for these when I was making the dough (I used my kitchen aid mixer)... it was extremely dense and shaping them into balls, let alone poking a hole in the middle and shaping them into bagels, was difficult. The dough didn't seem to have much give to it and my bagels didn't look very pretty once I managed to get them where I wanted. I let them rise for probably 30-45 minutes after I shaped them, which gave some of them a nicer look, but they weren't exactly pretty. However, they were delicious. They were chewy but still soft... I was worried they'd be too crisp when they came out of the oven since they felt kind of hard but nope! I made 12 mini bagels (6 sprinkled with steak seasoning, 3 plain, 3 topped with sugar and pumpkin pie spice) and 3 big bagels (2 topped with cheddar and jalepenos and 1 plain). They were a huge hit, my 19 month old and my husband both gobbled them up as if they hadn't eaten in a week. These will become a staple in my house, I doubt ill ever buy bagels again. The only thing ill do differently next time is add 1-2 extra tablespoons of water and watch the amount of flour I use more carefully to try and get a nicer looking bagel.   Either way these were wonderful, thanks for sharing! *EDIT* I made these again with 2 extra tablespoons of water and ended up with the most beautiful looking (& delicious) bagels. So much easier to work with when you add a little more water

I just made these for the first time.
I did change up the method a bit. Instead of following the recipe directions for forming the bagels, I rolled them out into long ropes and joined them into a circle. This made six good-sized bagels. I then covered them with a towel and let them rise for an hour.
They are FABULOUS!! Store-bought bagels are just gluey and sticky, but these are so much less dense and have much better flavor. I ate mine with blueberry cream cheese, but I probably could have eaten it without anything at all!

Well, I used whole wheat flour, added two tablespoons of ground flax seed, then followed the recipe as written. I had to leave the house for a while and figured I'd be back in time to take the dough out of the bread machine and finish the process.  I got waylaid and the dough stayed in the machine an hour and a half after it was done. When I got home, the dough was dry, rough around the edges, and looked as if the edges had been baked a bit.  Instead of poking holes in it, I made bite size baglets that looked more like donut holes. When I boiled them, they all stayed at the bottom of the pot so I didn't have to turn them :)  I baked them 22 minutes, pulled them out, and had the surprise of my life. They were wonderful! I doubt I can duplicate this unique recipe, but hope the right one ends in the same results.

This recipe was great! I was doing an "ogre party" for my husbands birthday. It just means everything had to be "ogre" sized. so i used this recipe to make huge bagels that I made into huge pizza bagels. Once i get pics i'll add them. They turned out great! I used 1 and 1/8th cups water as suggested. I found when I let them rise longer after shaping them they didn't boil right. I don't know if it was because they were too big or what. But 15 or twenty minutes was enough, and they turned out perfect. Thanks! Will definetley be making these againe - regular sized!

I have spent many years in the restaurant business and have worked in all areas, including several years as a baker ( we made all of our own bread )  I absolutely love bagels and this was my first attempt at trying to make them, myself.  The results were excellent!!!  I followed the recipe exactly but I cut the dough into six pieces instead of nine...  There are only 2 left and they just came out of the oven.... I will make more in a few minutes...  Nicely done!!!

Wow, these are great. I just finished making a batch, and polishing off two of them in one sitting! Followed recipe to a T, topped with sesame. course salt and garlic powder to make Everything Bagels, and then did a few with Cinnamon & Sugar. Both Absolutely DELISH! no need to toast them, just slather some cream cheese on there and go to town! Probably will make 8 instead of 9 next time to make them a tad bigger. Only slight prob is they did stick to the pan when baking, but nothing disastrous. Would love to know how I could keep these tasting fresh for the second day. Maybe that's a pipe dream?? THANKS A MILLION! Satisfied my NY bagel craving all the way overseas! much appreciated!

This is the first time I tried out a bagel recipe- and it was so simple!  I took another reviewers suggestion and added 1/2 cup shredded cheese to the dough, as well as sprinkling it on top after the egg.  I used monterey jack because that's all I had, and I still was told they tasted just like the panera asiago cheese ones :)  I will definitely make these again, and try different variations.

Made these today, they came out pretty well.. I watched the 'how to form bagels' video n youtube and the shape was great. Next time I will boil them longer, I don't think the outside was 'done' enough. I also had to bake them longer than directed. Made an 'everything' topping that was great - will try cinnamon & raisen next. UPDATE: I have made these many, many times now. I add 1 TB more of the water called for. Also, I boil for 2 minutes on each side, and bake for 21 minutes. I also make 10 and they are still as big as the ones from the grocery store, any bigger and they're too much for one person. They come out perfectly and are the best bagels I've ever had.

It is so difficult to describe how amazing these bagels turned out -- on my first try!  I put parmesan cheese on them, and it's like I've died and gone to heaven.  If you've made bread with the bread machine before, you can make these.  Please try making them!  It is 100% worth the effort (and it's not as hard as it sounds, even!).

this is THE recipe to try. keep doing this for a few times and you will get super good at it, and making bagels will take you about all of 10 minutes (minus kneading time, which you can be doing other stuff while the machine does the rest).   I have made this recipe 67 times to date. I have used several 50lb bags of flour - and I never would have thought that I'd ever be able to use that much flour until I found this recipe. Since I started making bagels for everyone (family, friends, work, my high school students), I have started buying my flour and yeast in bulk from a large restaurant warehouse type store in downtown los angeles (the canton food company). a 50lb bag is 14.65$ and a 1lb brick of dry yeast is 2.37$. no way even supermarket day-old discount prices can compete with my fresh hot warm fluffy bagels now.

pretty darn heavy bagels, I was hoping they would be a bit lighter.  I may make them again.  I sprinkled parmesean cheese on half of the bagels and then mixed cinnamon sugar and raisens in the other half.  The kids loved them, but I felt they were too dense.

Great recipe.  Very easy.  Could not believe that I could make bagels!!!  After my grandfather tasted these bagels he wants to open a bagel shop with me:)  I will make this recipe often.  Next time I will make these with the kids.  Followed the recipe exactly, except I did not have poppy seeds, so I substituted kosher salt on half and garlic salt on the other half. Yum!!!!!

** 5 STARS! ** I added 1/2 cup dried cranberries & 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon into the bread machine. I cut the dough into 6 equal portions for larger bagels. Shape portions into balls; roll into ropes; then connect ends with dab of water. Let rise about an hour. Boiled then baked as recipe instructions state. Served with my own whipped mixed berry cream cheese. For that: Whip 1 box Philadelphia cream cheese with 1/4 cup mixed berry jelly until nice and airy.  EXCELLENT!! My husband said these were the best bagels he's EVER had! NICE! Will definitely be making these again... I'd like to try dried blueberries next.  :D

Spectacular! I made six bagels out of the recipe, as another reviewer suggested, and they came out perfect in size. I added two or three tablespoons molasses to the boiling water instead of sugar, this gave them a nice browned glaze but they were still soft. I will definitely be making these again and again and again!

i think i have an especially high standard for bagels, but these did not impress me.  i'm used to the fresh bagels from my jewish family owned bagel shop in the suburbs of chicago, and these just don't measure up.

my bagels came out way too chewy, with a mild crunch only when they first came out of the oven.  it's possible that i made mistakes along the line somewhere, but i thought i'd followed the recipe exactly.

in my opinion, too much work for a mediocre result.  i'll stick to store bought.

A Whole Lotta Mo Betta. . .

My wife's comment sums this review up -
"These are the best bagels I have ever had!"
"Kinda like Einstein Bagels, huh?" [Me]
"No.  Much better. " [Her]

So, the official verdict is, "A Whole Lotta Mo Betta Than Einstein's".

VERY good!!! I added a twist:  1Tbs. malt powder, 1/2 tsp. ascorbic acid (preserve and enhance yeast activity). I have a product called Bread Shine, from King Arthur Flour catalog, produces an almost mirror finish on bagel surface. I find it holds seeds and looks nicer than egg wash. These are light - chewy - and crunchy all at the same time. Ummmm! Be sure to have some cream cheese ready when these come out of the oven.

EASY!  Crunchy and chewie.  Dividing it into 9 bagels seemed problematic (compared to an even 8 bagels) but I weighed it and divided the number of ounces by 9.  Each roll = 2 3/4 oz.    After 10 minutes baking, I added 1 tablespoon grated extra sharp cheddar on top of each bagel, then baked it for 12 more minutes.  I'll never buy store-bought bagels ever again.

I have never made bagels by scratch, and this recipe is easy to read and make.  I added chocolate chips in the raisin area of the bread machine, instead of poppy seeds or raisins.  They are great right out of the oven and keep well in tupperware.  I added a photo for you to see my batch. (under Firefly2970)..Have also used raisins, sesame seeds and oatmeal on top, all are great! Instead of cutting into 9 equal parts, i made a big blob and just used a donut cutter, I didnt flatten all the way either, and they turned out really good! I also doubled the recipe! :) Enjoy!

I love bagels, but here in Brazil they are not common, so I have to search for recipes to make them myself. This is a great recipe. Easy to make. The bagels came out great. My only suggestion is: eat them all once you make them as they tend to get a bit hard on next morning! I do not own a bagel toaster, which I think would do the trick for morning-after bagels... Great recipe!

These tasted great, and were so much fun to make! They did turn out smaller than store-bought bagels, so next time I will probably make fewer (or more, and have mini bagels :) ). I used half whole wheat flour and honey instead of sugar, and skipped the glaze and topping.

These are just like bakery bagels!  I made 6, not 9 from the recipe as is.  I also made 1 and 1/2 the recipe the second time to make 9 good sized bagels.  We added poppy seeds, sesame seeds, onion flakes and oatmeal to make a variety.  Served them to some overnight guests and they loved them.  YUM! Thank you!

These bagels were fun and easy to make. So much better than grogery store bagels that taste like bread.  Next time i will add a little gluten as someone suggested.  Also be careful when shaping them because once you make a mistake they dont stretch back easily.

Excellent recipe!  My bagels came out perfect.  A little crisp on the outside and sof and chewy on the inside!  I did follow the advice on this site about forming and baking bagels: http://allrecipes.com/advice/coll/cooking/articles/440P1.asp

Also, I recommend putting parchment paper under the cornmeal to keep the bagels from sticking to the pan.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T, only adding minced garlic, minced onion, poppy seeds, seseme seeds and kosher salt before baking.
Yummy!  I may never buy a bagel again -- and I live on Long Island, home to the best bagels in the world.  :-)

I don't have a bread machine so made the dough by hand.  Didn't know whether to let it rise or not - from the preparation time given I think that the recipe must include rising, but one of the reviewers said that rising causes the texture to be too breadlike, so I let the dough rise just fifteen minutes after kneading and another fifteen after shaping.  I didn't flatten the bagels at all and I boiled them for a full minute on each side, as recommended in the reviews.  My half-Jewish boyfriend said that they tasted very authentic.  I thought they were great.

This was my first attempt at bagels.  Thanks to a great recipe and helpful tips from reviewers, I'm a believer!  Awesome.  I added 2 teas cinnamon and 1/2 cup of raisins, sprayed the baking sheet before sprinkling cornmeal, made the holes large enough, let them rise at least 30 minutes after shaping and boiled a full minute each side.  Thanks all around. 5 stars easy.

These had an excellent texture and taste; however, mine looked really rough on the top. Also, since the boiling process stops the action of the yeast, I recommend letting them rise a bit after shaping them into bagels but BEFORE boiling.

My family and I really liked these bagels!  They have a good texture and flavor.  I made them in my kitchen aid mixer (rather than a bread machine), and I have found that I don't need to add nearly as much flour as it calls for.  The second time I made them, I added one teaspoon of cinnamon with the flour, and then kneaded in about one-half cup raisins at the end.  Some of these I sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar after glazing them with the egg whites (before baking).  They were delicious!  I made them into six bagels to get a slightly larger bagel.  This is a recipe I will keep making and experimenting with!

Well, I made these for my nieces and my nephew as a surprise because they love bagels. They enjoyed them. However, I'll tell you the truth: this isn't exactly the world's easiest recipe. There are several different steps involved, and it does take a lot of your time. The finished result is delicious though. My bagels didn't quite look as perfect as the store-bought kind; however, they were delicious nonetheless. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who loves bagels and has a bit of free time. BTW, I am 14 years old and love to cook. :)

Very easy recipe, I substituted 1 of the cups of flour with whole wheat flour and they turned out great. Gave them a little bit longer to rise like others have suggested and I made only 7 bagels so they would be bigger.  I've been making them every week for my kids' lunches. Trying to stay away from all the junk they put In the bagels you buy at the store.

This was my first attempt at making bagels and it was a great success!  I am in love with Dunkin Donuts cheddar cheese bagel twists so I added a little shredded cheddar in with the dough and then topped them with more shredded cheese.  Sooooo good! I will definitely use this recipe again.  I just hope my husband doesn't eat them all before dinner because I want to serve them with acorn squash soup tonight.

Wow!!! These are so yummy!!! I made mine with cinnamon and raisins added into the dough.  Then when I was forming them I only got 7 out of my batch, but that's ok.  I also did not have any cornmeal, so I baked mine on a sheet of parchment paper.  Then after the egg wash was brushed on, I sprinkled with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar.  These are awesome!!! I cannot wait to try again with different add-ins, and toppings. I will be making these all the time, no more store bought bagels for us.

I make these bagels all the time. I have topped them with poppy seed, sesame and "everything" - all with just a basic whipped egg-white egg wash. I usually only make six from the standard recipe. 

I have made the following flavor mods that have all worked out very well.

For cinnamon raisin, when the add mix-in buttons beeps, I add in a 1/3 cup of raisins and 1-1/2 tsp on ground cinnamon. I actually take the dough out and manually knead all the extras in for a minute and then put them back in and let it finish kneading.

For blueberry - I add about 1/2 cup of dried blueberries and do the same thing - knead some in and then put the dough back in and let it finish kneading.

For Asiago - I add about 1/2 cup of grated room temperature asiago cheese - knead it in and then put the dough back in and let it finish the cycle.

I let all my "versions" raise as they are supposed to, and then I add then I add 3T non-diastatic malt powder and 1T of sugar to boiling water and boil the bagels for 45-60 seconds on each side and then I dry them on cotton dishtowels before brushing them with beaten egg whites and cooking them in a 375 degree oven with a steam bath for 20-25 minutes.

Enjoy the variations :)

The receipe is PERFECT.  Oh it took me some practice to get the shaping, second rise, boiling, and baking down pat, but now on my 4th or 5th try I'm in HEAVEN.  I'm a displaced Jersey Jew in Denton Tx, I NEED my bagels!  Now that I know how to make them perfectly I am going to try a cinnemon raison version.  Only comment I have is, that I've basted with olive oil, egg and misted with water.  I settled on the olive oil one for cost and personal preference.  The water didn't work at all, the egg works great, but I love the extra bit of chewy I get with the olive oil.

My bagels turned out lumpy and thin. i think the method of how you make these bagels should be explained more here. i did the suggestion of other people and added more water and my dough was too watery.

My first time and fantastic outcome!!  At the last kneading and rising in machine I added cinnamon and raisins that I soaked in some water.  I allowed to rise half and hour.  Just perfect and my hubby and I ate too much!  I spread cream cheese on mine.  I froze them and thawed them in the microwave for a minute and toasted them.  PERFECT!!  And so, so easy.  And good for you with no preservatives.

First time I ever made bagels!  These were great. Read reviews and followed much of the advice. Thanks guys!   Made 2 batches for my big family. One plain with poppy seeds. I split the next, made half with cinnamon and raisins and the other with cheese.  Made 8 bagels from each batch and size was perfect too.   Recipe is going into my "make again" file!!

Wonderfully light and flavorful.  I surprised myself with this one.  Topped with the standard everything bagel toppings (onion, garlic, poppy seeds, caraway seeds, seasem seeds in equal portions) prior to baking.  I let rest for about 45 minutes or so before boiling in a warm place.  That was a mistake as the holes filled in and I had to remake the holes before boiling.  Next time I'll just let rest on the cabinet since we keep the house cooler.  Very easy to prepare!

I used AP flour and was very pleased with results.  I have only made bagels once before because the process seemed long, now I will make them more often as they tasted the best ever.

As described with recipe.  No changes.  Used poppy seed, sesame seed, garlic salt w asiago cheese and cinnamon (sans raisins).. only made 8 'normal' sized bagels.. left to 'rise' for over 30 min.  Will double batch it and make again.. VERY chewy and tasty.. "lite" tasting!  YUMMY! Thanks!

Amazing. So yummy and surprisingly easy. Exactly right in terms of what everyone has said about the rising in the boiling pot thing.
Really really good. I want to make 4 dozen more right now.

I  did not use the poppy seed when I made this instead I used rasins and cinnamon.  I added 1/8 cup extra water and followed the recipe for the rest of the ingredients.  They turned out great and were not hard to shape.

Awesome recipe, and surprisingly easy. I had no bread flour so I just used all-purpose. I mixed and kneaded in the bowl of a stand mixer using a dough hook, let rise for 1 hour in a warm place, formed the bagels and let rest for an additional 20 minutes before boiling. I recommend boiling a full minute per side for a chewier bagel. I made a batch each with poppy and sesame seeds, using olive oil instead of egg to make them vegan for friends. I also made a cinnamon raisin batch, reducing the salt to 1/2 TBSP, adding 1/2 C raisins (soaked in warm water) and 1 TBSP cinnamon. These disappeared fast!

I LOVE this recipe!!! The only changes I made were to let the shaped bagels rise again about 2hrs and I didn't glaze them at all before baking. I boil them for about 1 min each side. I tried forming 12 bagels instead of the suggested nine but I prefer following the recipe and making nine as that way the bagels are more soft. Thank you for a great recipe! I've already made it five times in two weeks!

I have made these bagels several times in my bread maker and they always come out very well.  I'm not very careful about shaping them, and my kids like them with chocolate chips in them, so they don't look pretty, but they taste delicious!  I do always use bread flour with this recipe.  We cannot get fresh bagels in the town we live in, so this recipe is greatly appreciated!

Really excellent and not too much trouble at all!. I wonder about perhaps using all-purpose flour rather than bread flour, or maybe do half and half. The consistency wasn't quite as dense as bagels usually are. But even so, it was really excellent!

The first time I made these the bagels were so small so I decided to double the batch.  The dough almost came out of the bread machine but I had big bagels.  This is one of the first recipes that I have made from this site that I haven't changed.  (Although I made plain bagels instead of poppy seed.)  I will be making these every week because they taste better and are cheaper than store bought bagels.

These are delicious! I looked for another recipe online to compare to and found a lot of "thrifty mom" type sites used this one and it worked like a charm. Not bready like typical bread aisle bagels.

Amazing.  This was actually less time consuming than the recipe sounds, and my bagels turned out delicious.  I did take a reviewer's advice on making 12 bagels instead of the 9 the recipe calls for, but I found this made 12 small bagels, so I recommend sticking with 9.
Five stars!!!

Great recipe.  My only tip is to make sure that you don't use too much flour while forming the bagels otherwise they will be shaped funny.  Still taste good.

This was my first time making bagels and I followed the recipe exactly.  They were very easy to make and came out pretty good.  Leftovers were a bit on the tough/chewy side, though.  Thanks for this fun recipe!

Best bagels I ever had. Made plain bagels cut in half and toasted, smeared them with "Jalapeno Popper Spread" from this site. Everybody raved about them.

WOW! No more bagel shops! Great as-is, though I might see what happens if I let the dough rise 1/2 hour before boiling. I tried sprinkling parmesan cheese on 3 bagels, cinnamon sugar on 3, and kept the remaining 3 plain. I can't believe how good these are! You are my hero!

Update 9/28: this may or may not be useful - I tried adding the 1/8 cup of water for my second batch, and the dough came out sticky and very difficult to work with, so I won't be doing that again. I also measured in 1/4 cup "white" wheat flour. Should have trusted you. They still taste good, though I also forgot to sweeten the water. I've always used honey instead of sugar in bread, which worked well the first time. This time also, the bagels taste yeasty. Still experimenting - hope the first time wasn't just beginner's luck!

I am an avid baker, and I've been looking for some new adventures. I have definitely conquered the bagel! This recipe is easy to follow, time consuming (but totally worth it). The bagels are chewy on the outside and soft on the inside. I made 4 different flavor varieties (Parmesan, onion and herb, salt, and cinnamon sugar) all in one batch! They all look wonderful (I've only tried to Parmesan and it's great!) The egg white and dropping ice cubes in the bottom of the oven really added a wonderful texture to the exterior. I really hope you decide to adventure into the word of the bagel! Happy Baking :)

Wow, great and simple recipe.  I have a 1lb bread machine and I make half a dozen of these bagels a day since they don't last long.  I throw in 2 tbsp rehydrated onions and they are just amazing and so easy!

Super easy! I used AP flour and they came out like the ones in the picture. Added 3/4 cup of raisins and a TBSP or more of cinnamon. Taste great! Will try slicing and freezing so I can pop 'em in the toaster in the mornings.

These were pretty good. Not the best bagels I've ever made, but definitely 4 stars. 5 stars for taste, but the dough was hard to work with and a little off.

I admit, I was not optimistic about this recipe...it didn't seem to rise enough in my bread machine, and the dough seemed way too dry.  BUT I was thrilled when they puffed right up in the boiling water and oven!  And they taste AMAZING!  I let them sit for about 15-20 minutes instead of 10 because I got distracted, and used a melted butter glaze instead of egg white because I hate separating eggs.  They are chewy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Just goes to show that you can't judge a recipe before it is finished!

Made recipe with no changes, these bagels are great!  I was hoping that they would turn out as good as the store bought variety, but to my surprise, they are much better!  Will definitely make again!  Sprinkled some with cinnamon & sugar, some with minced onion, garlic powder and poppy seeds.

EXCELLENT recipe. As with bread, it is a little time consuming, but the bread machine cuts the time. Mine didn't look very pretty, but the taste was amazing. I will never buy store bought again!

This recipe turned out great and very delicious!  I am so pleased that it turned out so well and would definitely use this recipe over and ver again in the future.

I used an extra tablespoon of water in the mix and the dough came out good, but I think next time I will reduce the additional water to a half tablespoon.  Shaping the bagels was a little tricky; I was worried about over-stretching the hole and was a little timid so only half came out in the traditional shape.  Next time I'll be a little less unafraid.

As had been said before, the basic 9 serving recipe only yields about six Dunkin Donuts/Einstein Brothers sized bagels, but the smaller 9 servings sized bagels are the correct serving size that we should be eating anyway.

holy wow these were amazing!!!  i will never buy a bagel from the market again after having these.  i made some batches with different variations like parmesan and asiago cheese, blueberry, cinnamon sugar, and plain and all were just amazing.  i will say they make 9 smaller bagels than you'd get at the store, but then those you buy at the store are usually too big for me so this was great.  and while the process was a little time consuming, for a bread machine novice like myself it was exceptionally easy.

These were great.  I reduced the sugar in the boiling water to 2Tbsp and added 2 tsp of baking soda to water.  Made the bagels fluffy yet chewy.  Topped some with sea salt and others with minced onion.  Kids couldn't get enough straight out of the oven!

Turned out pretty good (especially the raisin cinnamon ones)
These are the changes I made (since I do not have a bread machine)
I used my food processor:
I warmed water in the micro for 1:10 min, checked that it is 110F, added sugar to the warm water, dissolved the yeast and let it stand for 10 min. I did use 1 and 1/8 cup of water.
Added flour and salt to the food processor and while on the dough cycle added the yeast mixture. After the dough was ready I took half of it and put it covered with the wet towel at the warm place and other half, I added ¾ cup raisins and 1 TBSP of cinnamon and mixed these. Let both types to raise for an hour, shaped bagels and let these rise again for 45 min. Boiled in water for 1.5 min and baked for 25 min at the oven. 

Turned out great!

I love this recipe.  I make 8 instead of 9 because it is easy to cut the dough in equal pieces with a large thin sharp knife by pushing straight down.    Jalapeno bagels are my favorite.  Add a 1/3 cups of diced jalapenos and a heaping tablespoon of crushed red peppers.   Put the jalapenos into a measuring jar then bring the water level to 1 1/4 and bring the water temperature to 110 degrees.   For cinnamon raisin bagels add about a ½ cup of raisons and a tablespoon of cinnamon.  Add the raisons to the water also and warm.     After you have done it a few times you don’t have to worry too much about having enough water because you can always add some shortly after the bread machine starts working.    Also, I boil 1 minute per side.  That seems to give them better texture.

I'm rating this with only four stars because three hours for 9 bagels was a bit much.  I used 1 1/2  cups whole wheat flour, and 1 1/2 cup unbleached white flour.  On the plus side, they were delicious.   I may do them again, but it won't be a recipe I use very much.

Really good bagels.  Didn't rise as much as I had hoped but that is probably my own doing, can't blame the recipe.  I will make again and adjust to let them raise longer than 10 minutes.

Delicious! I made 4 cinnamon raisin and 4 everything bagels. For the cinnamon raisin, I wanted swirls like commercially-made bagels so I flattened the dough a bit and sprinkled cinnamon and raisins over it. Then, I rolled it up like cinnamon buns and rolled it up again in the other direction. Next, I separated it into 4 pieces and rolled 'em up into a ball and continued with the steps as written in the recipe. On 2 of them I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top after brushing on the egg wash. They were absolutely fantastic and I'll definitely do that again. Just a heads up: my oven usually runs hot, but these took over 30 minutes to bake.

These bagels were delicious! I made 8 (easier to divide) and had to add an extra tablespoon of water because the dough was too dry. I also let them raise for about 15 minutes because I was busy unloading the dishwasher, etc. Oh I also added 1 tablespoon water to the egg white. And the ones I cooked on my baking stone came out a lot nicer than the ones on a normal pan. I can't wait to experiment with different flavors next time I make these :). Thanks so much for the recipe!!

I have made bagels using other recipes and have to say this is the best one.  These bagels wouldn't win a prize for looking great, but the taste and texture is perfect.  They are far superior to what we can get at any grocery or bagel shop.  I bake bread in my bread machine every day to have with breakfast, these light , chewy bagels are a really nice alternative for toast.

These turned out better than I expected.  The recipe went very smoothly and they turned out perfectly round and chewy.  The only problem - now my kids don't want store bought bagels anymore, so I will be using this recipe often.

Excellent recipe! I followed directions exactly and they turned out great. However after reviewing the photos I thought I would make my holes bigger so they would look more "store bought". They didn't expand as much as I thought so I ended up with quite large holes. 2 inch holes to start is all you need. They looked funny but they were delicious!

I have been wanting to try these forever, and today I decided to go for it...they turned out GREAT!!!! I only seperated the dough into 8 sections, and after forming, let them rise for about 30 minutes. I took others advice and boiled them for 1 minute on each side (2 mins. total). Also, I brushed them with olive oil instead of egg white, as suggested by others, but think I will try the egg white next time because they dony 'dry' completely using the olive oil. I made half plain and half 'everything', which included: sea salt, toasted onion flakes, poppy seeds and sesame seeds. Both turned out FANTASTIC! These bagels have just the right amount of chewiness, IMO. These were sooooo simple, and I can't wait to make them again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe is phenomenal!  I did not change a thing and used a cinnamon and sugar topping.  They are also delicious plain without any topping at all, I like to use plain ones to make "bagel shop" style sandwiches.  No need to go to the bakery any more.  These are the best!  While it seems like the process will be a lot of work, it is quite easy and is well worth it!

This recipe is wonderful!!!  I only made 8 bagels (an even number is much easier to divide) and I did let them rise about 30 minutes after forming them.  I can't wait to make some more and fool around with different flavors.

I made mine honey wheat, using honey instead of the sugar and 2 c. whole wheat flour + 1 c. all-purpose.  As another reviewer recommended, I used 2 Tbs. molasses in the boiling water instead of the sugar, and let the dough rise.  The only thing I didn't do, which I should have, was add more water originally - the dough wasn't sticky enough to properly mold and I ended up with some gnarly looking bagels!  But they're DELICIOUS!!

Very good! Just made for first time. Couple changes- doubled the amounts (still fits in my machine) but reduced yeast a little (1/2 tsp less than doubled recipe called for). Will add cinnamon next time as I just kneaded some in after dough was ready, but not cinnamon-y enough for my taste that way.  Good bagels are impossible to get in Ireland, so at least now I won't have to get by with terrible store bought ones!

I've made these several times. I usually end up having to add an extra 1/4 cup of water as the dough is too dry. I also add a little of my seasoning to the dough prior to letting it rise in my bread machine. I divide them into 6 instead of 9 bagels and allow them to rise an extra 30-60minutes (until doubled in size)   Other than that I Follow directions pretty closely. I've been topping these with dried minced onions, rosemary, and salt. My husband swears these are the most flavorful bagels he's ever had, and I'm inclined to agree! Even the bottom of the bagels have more flavor than most bagels I've tasted!!! They have an amazing texture and aren't tough/chewy like a lot of bagels are. These have quickly become something we keep on hand!

I made bagel dogs with this recipe.  They turned out really good.  Looked a little funny, but tasted excellent.  Next time I would play with a bit more flavoring for them.

Pretty easy to make with the use of a bread maker.  We've made them twice so far, and they've turned out excellent both times.  Would recommend.  The only thing is I would replace the poppy seeds with sesame seeds or cinnamon sugar.

what a great recipe!  I've never made bagels before, and they are fabulous.  The first time I just made a single batch and only made about 7.  I've now got the recipe for 16 and make 12.  I do let the bagels rise for about 1/2 hour in a warm oven before boiling.  They are easy and delicious.

These are awesome bagels! I make them often. I like to double the recipe, but my bread machine is kinda too small for that (it rises too high), so I usually just open the top, or take it out for the last 7 minutes or so. With a double recipe, I get about 20 nice sized bagels. I like to let them rest after shaping a little longer than 10 minutes, because I love the way they puff up a little more. I don't usually put a topping on them, so I skip the egg wash. When they come out of the oven, I brush a little melted butter or olive oil over the tops. My whole family really likes these!

my first experience with bagels.  i made them the night before, (no extra water needed for my machine), formed them (8 in all)and left them in the fridge overnight.  in the morning i took them from the fridge and put them on the counter to warm while the water boiled.  i boiled 2 at a time (i was afraid i couldn't handle more than that).  most boiled for 30 seconds on each side except, the 2 i forgot about, which got a min. on each side.  i baked them for 25 min. on parchment paper.  all in all they were great. the slightly longer boiled ones were a bit more chewy.  the kids , my two 7 and 9 and a guest as well, loved them and there are a couple left for when the hubby gets up.  the labor was marginal just a lot of waiting for the bread machine.  no more store bagels or brugger's for me!  i wish i had made more to freeze!!!

These turned out great. I've never made bagels before and I rarely have much success with recipes using yeast, so I wasn't optimistic, but they were easy.   No idea how they tasted though. I left them unguarded for a moment and my family ate them. All of them. I added some crispy fried onion (from a tub I got in IKEA!) which I'm told made them delicious. I have a cinamon and raisin batch in the bread machine right now.   Only difficulty I had was shaping the bagels, as the dough was quite springy.   Great recipe, thank you. Jen

Like nearly everyone else on this site I make my own alterations.  (We're all freaks)  Anyway, I replaced 1c. of flour with 1c. of quick cooking oatmeal and baked them on a stone.  YUMMMM  Thanks for the recipe!

This is my first time ever making bagels.  I used to love the bagels from Safeway, but I moved and there aren't any stores with good bagels around here that aren't completely overpriced (I don't want to pay $1.50 for one bagel!).  So I decided to try my hand at it.  Even though my bagels turned out pretty ugly -- I obviously need to work on forming them into prettier circles -- they were delicious!  I added 1/2 cup sundried tomatoes to the ingrediants before putting it on the 'dough' cycle, and they tasted just like the sundried tomato bagels I used to buy back home!  Thanks for the recipe, I'll never buy bagels again!!!

This was my first attempt at making bagels and the results were great. A very nice flavor. However, I did make one alteration, I added 1 TBS spoon of olive oil to the dough.  Next time I make these, I will need to lightly oil the baking sheet since these did stick a little.

I use 100% whole wheat flour and the last time I substituted a cup of rye flour. The recipe still worked fine.

My family and I really enjoyed these.. I've now made them 4 times, and each time they get better.

This is a really good recipe but I'm giving only a four because I feel it could be better.  I used the cornmeal as suggested and it got all clumpy on the bottom, next time I'll take the advice of others and use parchment paper.  Also these bagels were too dense, I'll also take the advice of letting them rise for 2 hours instead of 10 minutes.  Other than that they are wonderful and easy.  We added cinnamon and raisins and 1/3 whole wheat flour.  Thanks for the recipe!

Followed recipe exactly except it was easier to divide dough into 8 portions instead of 9.  I did find that the bagels were more chewy than I like. Next time, I will let the bagels rise up longer next time and also follow another reader's advice to only boil the dough for about 10 seconds or so and not 1 minute.

WOW!!!! I am now impressed with these bagels! Last week I made them following previous reviewer's suggestion to substitute WW flour and extra water. Well, they tasted good, but were very moist and dense. Today I made them by the original recipe, except: I let the dough rise/rest ~ 25 min before forming the bagels; I let them rise 20 min once formed into bagels; I made a dozen mini bagels, which is what we prefer.

I may even make another batch to take to the beach next week!

AMAZING!!!

These bagels were so delicious and so easy! Everyone was so impressed with them-- probably because making bagels sounds so intimidating!

I used my Kitchenaid mixer for the dough instead of my bread machine, and after the dough was done, I folded 3/4 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and 5 cloves of minced garlic into the dough before shaped them and let them rise again.

Absolutely DELICIOUS with cream cheese! I will be making these again and trying other flavors, blueberry and cinnamon raisin are next!

Thanks for the great recipe!

Really good.  I did 1c of whole wheat flour and 2 c bread flour, and they were still really yummy.  I may try more WWF next time.  I let them rise 30 minutes and boiled them longer per other reviews.  So easy - and the kids loved them too.  I will probably try making bagel chips with them too sometime.

Very chewy and oh so good... I use 3 c all-purpose flour (white) instead of bread machine flour and I use 2 tbsp of honey instead of 3 tbsp of sugar when boiling.  This way I don't need to use the egg white.  I also sprinkle a bit of cinnamon and a small handful of either raisins or dried cranberries while the bread machine is going through it's cycle and also sprinkle cinnamon on them before they go into the oven.  Since making them this way, we don't buy the store ones anymore.

I'm very happy that I tried this recipe.  It was the first time I've made bagels and they turned out beautiful and tasted great.  At first I was scared to eat one in fear that they wouldn't taste as good as they looked.  But they were delicious!  I followed the advice of others and added 1/4 cup more water to the bread machine.  I also let it rest for 30 minutes instead of 10.  It made 8 perfect sized bagels.  The most time consuming part was waiting for the bread machine to finish.  Thanks for the recipe. :)

AMAZING!  I didn't know I had it in me to make bagels, nor did I know that the best bagels in Montréal would emerge from my own oven tonight!  Made them with 3tsp of Cinnamon Sugar & 1/4c of raisins.  Fabulous.  Made six, rolled them thin and pinched, like they do at Fairmount!

These bagels turned out great. I omit the egg for simplicity. Reading the other reviews, if your bagels don't grow in size after putting them in hot water, make sure that the water is indeed boiling. This is important. This recipe yields about 8 average-sized bagels.

These were my first bagels, and they turned out wonderfully. I made the dough the night before and let it rise again in the fridge overnight. I also let the bagels rise for around 30 minutes after shaping to make sure the chill was off. I added 1 TBS salt to the water as well as the sugar. They're not perfect in appearance, but who cares when they taste this good!

This is a good 'quick' bagel recipe.  I'd been wanting to try the Cook's Illustrated method of letting them rise overnight, but haven't had the time (or the high gluten flour).  So, I've made this recipe a couple of times and they've been great.  I add vital wheat gluten, shape into 6-7 bagels, add barley malt syrup into the dough and then in the water when boiling.  One tip - I was making these late one night and didn't have any clean dish towels and decided to try and use paper towels to drain them after boiling - HUGE MISTAKE!  They stuck to the paper towels and I had to pick the paper towels off of the dough before baking.  Although, while they weren't as pretty, they still tasted pretty darn good!

As a PA transplant to MO, I was really missing good bagels!  These fit the bill and are easy to make.  I don't have a bread machine, just use my Kitchenaid. I've tried many variations, but my favorite so far has been cranberry walnut!  Used roughly 3/4 cup of dried cranberries and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  I also use 1 T. barley malt syrup in the recipe and use barley malt instead of sugar in the boiling liquid.  YUM!

Great recipe!  It was easy to do and lots of fun.  I added dried apples and cinnamon to make apple-cinnamon bagels and my family, who really isn't into bagels, wants me to make them every weekend.  I followed what other people did and added 1/8 cup more of water and let them rise 20-30 minutes instead of 10.

My family absolutely loved these. I made a plan batch last Sat. then added some dried onions to second batch. They were gone by bed...three teenagers gave them thumbs up. Made 2 batches onion and modified to cinnamon raisin today, to share with neighbors, eat and freeze. My family would have me making them everyday.

These were soooo good! They were easy to make and tasted just like the ones I used to buy at my favorite bakery in New York. I made them into Cinnamon Raisin Bagels by adding one cup of whole wheat flour, two cups of bread flour, 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 cup of raisins. I had to add a little more water to form the dough. I topped about half of them with sesame seeds before I put them in the oven. This recipe is a definite keeper. Thanks for sharing.

I have tried other bagel recipes with little to no success.  This one is great.  Follow the directions and you get a wonderful bagel.  I cannot eat wheat flour so I substituted spelt flour for the wheat.  It was incredible.  I have not been able to have bagels for over a year because of the wheat flour in them...thank you for this recipe.

These are great!!...But the second time I made them I tried a flour of 50% whole wheat- and they were like LEAD BALLS- So now I just throw in a few tablespoons of wheat and cornmeal in the mix for a little more ooomph.

These were excellent bagels, yet chewier than I expected it to. One piece of advice, though: they have to be eaten very fresh, within 2 days, or they'll be too hard to do anything with them but french toast. Will bake them again.

This recipe tasted okay, if not a little bland.  Add one tablespoon of molassess to the boiling water to give your bagels the look of those from a bagel shop.

Fantastic recipe and I don't have a bread machine yet. I just put all the dry recipes in a bowl minus one cup of flour, make a well, stir, and kneaded in the rest of the flour gradually until the dough seemed right (I always seem to need less flour when I make any bread recipe). I also used fast-acting yeast which worked perfectly and used the same measurement the recipe called for.  I followed the recipe from #2 on and I would not change a thing except to make 8 bagels instead of 9. They turned out perfect!  My grandsons who are toddlers loved the warm bagels with butter on them!  I have hid a couple of bagels for my husband so he can have some when he comes home for lunch. I think I'll make a second batch this afternoon since these are going fast!  This will be my bagel recipe from now on.

WOW!!  I thought think recipe is AWESOME!  I have tried and failed with so many bread recipes, that I assumed that this one would also turn out not-so-good.  Wow was I wrong.  They are excellent.  Other reviewers have said they just don't seem to like the shape, but I think it is great because they taste good, and LOOK homemade!  Tip with those cooking in a gas oven:  Check them about evey 5 minutes, mine only took about 13 minutes to cook.

GREAT recipe! As others have said, it's a very easy recipe to make and very difficult to mess up. This was the first time I've ever made bagels and I'm so pleased with the results. I altered my recipe a little by replacing 1/3 of the flour called for in the original with whole wheat flour. Mine also don't have a smooth surface like store bought ones, but the flavour makes up for it.

I must say I was a little skeptical at first but these were OUTSTANDING! This recipe made 6 store bought frozen sized bagels for me. Two questions though...has anyone tried rolling the dough into a rope circle before rising-this would make it smoother? or has anyone tried to double the recipe in the bread machine?  Thanks Christy. I will be making this often.

This is a great recipe. Very soft and chewy. The only thing I had a problem with was they stuck to the baking sheet. 
I'm in Australia and the only bagels I can find in Melbourne are in the city or a suburb 40 minutes from my house. Now I can have them any time. I only made plain bagels, but the next ones I'm going to make cinnamon raisin, blueberry, and chocolate chip.
Thanks for this recipe!!!

These bagels are awesome!!! I no longer buy store-bought bagels. I make low-calorie whole wheat cinnamon raisin bagels that are delicious. I simply sub the sugar with sugar substitute, use whole wheat flour instead of bread flour, and add 2 t. of cinnamon and 3/4 c. of raisins when making the dough. After they have been boiled I stick them right on a greased cookie sheet without the cornmeal or any other toppings and they turn out just awesome!! Once I used a dried fruit mixture (ie cranberries, blueberries) and it turned out wonderful, too. Great recipe!!

These were GREAT!!!  Made them one Saturday morning and by Sunday they were gone.  If you like a chewy New-York style bagel you'll love this recipe.  Takes practice to make them look pretty, but the taste will out-weigh the looks. :)

I can't believe how great these were! I topped half with sesame seeds and half with poppy seeds and both were equally good. The only problem was that most of them ended up too flat so that I was not able to cut them in half to toast them. I think next time I won't press them down so hard and let rise a little bit longer after forming them. Don't forget to make the holes big enough. I'm looking so forward to my next batch. What a fantastic recipe.

I have made about 5 batches of these since I found the recipe about 2 weeks ago!  They are so easy to make, and I think they have just as good a flavor and better texture than store bought.  Made them as end-of-year teacher gifts, and everyone raved.  They couldn't believe that I made my own bagels!  I followed the recipe exactly.

I just finished these.  The bagels taste OK but nothing to write home about.  The dough was very difficult to shape into nice rounded bagels.  Next time I will try half whole wheat flour.

This is THE RECIPE to make. Simple, easy, and the results are as good as the professional bagel guy down the street makes. I'm from New Jersey, where the best bagels in the world are made by guys from NYC. Follow the directions, you won't be disapointed.

Can I just give you a HUGE shout out for this recipe “THANK YOU”. I am seriously the happiest person in the world right now. This recipe worked perfectly. My only change was molasses vs. sugar in the boiling water. Sprinkled “everything but” on top, perfection. Cheers

Delicious. After boiling the first three bagels and seeing how much they expanded, I realized that it would have been best to divide the dough into twelve sections rather than six. So, I cut the already-shaped sixths in half and reshaped them to create a total of six normal-sized bagel and three giant bagels. The smaller bagels looked much better and cooked more evenly than the giant ones.

All I can say is, my husband is from the Upper West Side (i.e. the bagel epicenter of the universe), and he was blown away by how good these are.  I followed the recipe exactly (with the 1 1/8 cups of water for the bread machine).  My daughter is allergic to nuts and sesame, so we can't get good bagels because of cross-contact in bakeries - this is an amazing find.  Thank you Cristy Chu, wherever you are!!!

First time I ever made bagels! This is a great recipe. I only altered it in two minor ways: added parmesan cheese (1/2 cup) and whole egg not just white. They turned out beautiful and delicious! I have trouble separating eggs, and our Costco in AZ had great parmesan bagels bur here in NC they don't. This is easo to make, so make sure to try it!

Definitely add a bit more water. Other than that. Perfect.  Egg wash was good and was also good without just dropping some cheese right on it before baking. 27 minutes.

These bagels were chewy and flavorful, and using the bread machine instead of kneading by hand produced a more tender dough with WAY less cleanup! I think when I tried making bagels by hand, I kept adding flour to prevent sticking. But the teflon coating in the bread machine helps the dough stick to itself and not the bowl or blade. Plus, it's a great climate-controlled box for rising.

One tip: put the dough rings in the water upside-down, so that when you flip them, they are attractive-side up, and you can bake them that way. It's way easier to flip the dough rings before boiling than after, when they're scalding-hot.

This was my first time making bagels and I picked the perfect recipe! I made an even 8 bagels (I like even numbers and from the other reviews they sounded smallish).  I omitted the poppy seeds since they always stick in my teeth.  I did a brush of veg oil instead of egg white. I topped half with cinnamon sugar (a lot!), and the other half with a little sprinkle of kosher salt.  They were both amazing!  The only thing I should have done was to make sure the holes were a little bigger so they didn't close completely.  But no harm done, they baked up perfectly at 25 minutes. I can't say how impressed I am with how well they turned out. :)

Perfect bagels, way better than store-bought. Made 1 batch and ended up making 2 additional batches the same day to freeze for use throughout the week because they were so popular.

Very nice, chewy bagels. They may not be huge, but I made 8, and could only fit 6 on my baking sheet.  I didn't use the egg wash, but think I will next time, because the toppings didn't really stick. And in Chile, there aren't any good ovens, so the bottoms got a bit too brown while the tops weren't browned that evenly.  The folks who are complaining probably don't know that a bagel is SUPPOSED to be chewy.  I did boil them a bit longer than 2 minutes, because that's what makes them chewy.  Also, I didn't twirl them, just stretched them. Easier and got holes that stayed. Also, this is the fastest, easiest bagel recipe I've ever seen.  My machine has a rising included in the dough cycle.  So, I just let it rise.  I've never made bagels that didn't call for a first rise until doubled in bulk, anyway, and it worked beautifully.  Will be making them again.

WOW! This is the best bagel recipe I have found so far!!! I don't have a bread machine, so I made this by hand. I proofed my yeast for 10min then added flour and salt to the mix. I kneaded the dough, covered it with a damp towel and let it rise for 30min in a warm area. After that, I punched down the dough and gave it another 30min. 

I only cut my dough into 6 sections (I like big bagels) and shaped them into bagels. I let them rise for another 15min and then added them to boiling water. I decided to do an olive oil wash and then added some minced garlic and pretzel salt to the tops. SOOO GOOD!

I am so excited!  These were really, really, really good.  I tried making bagels @ home once a few years ago... the flavor was okay... but it was a ton of work & they looked a little funny.  These, however... seem to be foolproof... and the instructions, plus tips from other reviewers have taught me so much to improve my lackluster bagel making skills.  The dough seemed a little dry in the machine, but that could have been anything, not the instructions... so I added a tablespoon of warm water at a time until I saw it coming together better in the pan.  I tried rolling the dough into ropes (from another reviewer) but had better luck flattening into a ball, making a hole, and stretching the dough out from there (from the recipe). Also, once I formed the bagels, I did let them sit over an hour to try to get them to be less craggy looking.  Along those same lines, I did make 6 bagels though, because I wanted something to resemble big NY style bagel shop bagels.  Overall, I am very, very, very pleased with this attempt and thank you so much for posting this recipe.  I will be trying again in another day or so once the remaining 3 are gone!

These are definitely a keeper for plain bagels.  Very easy.  I did however, mess up a little.  I forgot to let them rise before putting them in boiling water.  They were big already though so its all good.  I made 6 because if I made 9 they would have been super small.  I didn't add anything to the tops either.  I didn't even brush on the egg.  They were fabulous.  Shaped a little funny but it was my first time making them and I will get better.  Next time I will try what another reviewer suggested.  Roll them into like a fat snake and pinch them off so the hole is already the right size and they wont be as deformed.  :)  Great recipe.  Thanks!  I did read some that didn't turn out well.  Not sure what they did wrong.  Didn't measure correctly or the humidity maybe affecting things.  Mine came out perfect except for my shaping antics.  These were quick and easy to make not sure why some thought it was hard.  If they are too floury you used too much flour and if they got too flat its either the temperature or not enough yeast or too much.  Things don't always come out the first time you make them.  Try again different part of the day maybe.

I'd written a review before but I just wanted to add to it.  I love bagels. The only problem I'd had with them had been in sandwiches with everything squeezing out the middle.  I stopped making the holes in them. Ok, it's sacrilegious to make bagels into rolls but they still taste the same, almost as good as NYC or CT bagels, but without the sandwich hassles and less work to make.  Friends have been pleasantly surprised by my "rolls" and liked the idea of no holes.  Maybe, if this catches on with bagel shops, with less labor involved in making them (the ingredients are cheap), the price of bagel shop bagels might go down a bit.  1 more thing.  Boil them for 2 min each side for chewier bagels/rolls, which ever you decide to make.

Excellent!  I have made this exact recipe no less than 50 times.  I can't believe I never gave it a review.  I make "everything" bagels for work and these are perfect.   Loved by everyone.  So fresh.  They freeze excellent, even if you slice before freezing.  Wrap well.  Remove direct from freezer, 30 second defrost in micro and you can eat or toast just a bit for crisping.   Perfect!

Awesome! I added blueberries to my dough after the machine pulled it together. I made eight, and they were ginormous! They do rise quite a bit if you leave them out for half an hour or so, and they continue to do so in the water and oven. Excellent recipe-- thanks so much!

Taste like what you get from a bagel shop. Made one batch Saturday to try and in the process of making another right now. Like some previous reviewers suggested I made 6 from the batch and the size was perfect. With respect to the recipe I kept everything the same except I added 2-3 tsps. of water to bring everything together. I also did not use the egg wash. And this time I'm going to try turning them halfway through baking.  As far as boiling, I didn't add anything to the water. When I was in high school I worked part time in a bagel store/bakery. There was always a large pot (cauldron?) of hot water which we dumped the bagels into before baking.  There was never anything in the water nor did anything go on the bagels except the toppings.  They went into the oven on burlap covered boards which had been sprayed with water and the bagels were flipped halfway through baking and the boards removed from the oven.  These taste as authentic as any shop.  I'll be trying the poppy seeds as soon as they're delivered.

These were FANTASTIC!  We just loved them and they tasted just as good as if we bought them.  I used olive oil instead of the egg white and just sprayed the bottom of the pan since I didn't have cornmeal.  I also didn't use a bread machine but they still came out tasting great.

I made this recipe just as it says except I used the egg yolk on top of our bagels with a little melted butter mixed in. (in place of the egg white) It came out yummy and we have made this several times since. Usually we make this for dinner with egg and cheese in the middle, sometimes ham too. VERY YUMMY! I highly recommend you try it out lol!! I find that I need to add a tiny bit of water into the dough as it is mixing bc it doesnt QUITE mix in all the way. I just open the lid, add a bit of water and use a rubber scraper to get anything off the sides and mix it all as it turns around. OH and as far as the hole in the middle, i just pinch a hole in the center and swing it around my finger a little bit. Sometimes I leave it out too. I don't notice a difference in taste.

I've always wanted to make my own bagels but thought it would be too difficult. This was TOO EASY! I added a cup of raisins and a tablespoon of cinnamon. Next time I might cut back cause they were too sweet. I also added one and one half tsp of vital wheat gluten to make them chewier. I live and grew up in Bergen county NJ and our bagels are massive so I actually only made 4 bagels out of this recipe to get the size I was used to. They didn't rise too much but I'm sure that was my fault for playing with the dough so much when I was trying to figure out the right size. I will definitely make again and since I'll be better prepared, I'm sure they'll turn out even better.

**UPDATE**

So, I just made these again. I did everything the same except use less cinnamon, more vital wheat gluten, and I made six (they're so small!). Both times I've found they are very dense and chewy which I love but I just wish they would have a little more fluff to them. They barely rise in the oven. They're still fantastic but I'm striving for bagel store fantastic and I can't seem to get it. Maybe I'll go there and ask them what I'm doing wrong. BTW: I made sure not to mess with the dough nearly as much.

These were perfect! Added a bit more water per reviews I had read but other than that I followed it exactly. Topped with garlic powder and parsley then added a bit of cheese five minutes before they were done. Sooooo good!

This was my first attempt at making bagels and am extremely happy with the results! After reading reviews, I did follow what a lot of people suggested and let them sit a little longer after shaping. These will definitely become a regular in my house

Worked like a charm! The taste reminds me of Lenders bagels, I think because of the egg wash, but way, way better! I am so proud of myself since I am usually a horrible baker, but it was truly easy. Even after freezing they were still wonderful.

I was so pleased with this recipe.  I followed the directions exactly...except for the egg white (I just used butter) and the yeast (I used active dry yeast instead of bread machine yeast).  My husband and I both loved them!  I'm going to make them again today, but with raisins and cinnamon like others have suggested :)

Very good recipe--I accidentally let mine rise for about 3 hours and it was still REALLY good!  I made 8 bagels out of this recipe and did a mix of toppings.  My favorite was pretzel salt!  Great recipe!!

I've made one batch of these. My husband and I quickly and happily devoured one each when they came out of the oven. 

I found shaping them to be difficult, but I may have let the dough rest too long after the machine was done. Once I can figure out the trick to best shaping the dough, I'll give it five stars. I found it difficult to actually shape it into a smooth ball. 

For future batches we'll play with adding ingredients to the dough using the machine's raisin bread setting (i.e., chocolate chips, chopped spinach, maybe some whole grains & flax seeds). These are almost as good as our local bagel place which has some of the best bagels I've ever had.

I tried this recipe twice and I was not happy with the results... I did use all-purpose flour, and maybe that is why they didn't come out right.  They were gummy and not bagel - like.  The parts that were not gummy did taste good.  I suggest you do use bread flour and not all-purpose.  I will try a no-boil bagel recipe. I might try to do that with this recipe.  It just wasn't a bagel and I don't give such low ratings...  Sorry

Yum!  I've always wanted to try making bagels but it always seemed so intimidating. It's a very involved process, but I am in love with my bread machine because it makes recipes like these so easy! They really impressed my friends.

These bagels are awesome! The only thing I changed was to make 6 larger bagels instead of 9 smaller ones. After I formed them, I placed them on a cookie sheet sprayed with cooling spray, covered them with plastic wrap sprayed with butter flavored cooking spray and let them rise for about 90 minutes. Then I dipped then in the boiling water and baked them. They were perfect. I will be making these again and again.

Although I was skeptical about attempting to make bagels, this recipe looked easy so, I read the reviews (ALWAYS helpful!) and jumped right in.  The bagels were GREAT!  Thanks so much for an easy, but wonderfully tasty recipe.  Bye, bye Brueggers!

I added 1/8 c water, then about 1 tbsp once it was kneading bc it looked quite crumbly.  I also let the bagels rest for 20 min once formed.  I dipped them in evoo & basil- turned out pretty good!  I will continue tweaking, adding mix ins to enhance the flavor (blueberries!) and letting them rest for longer to get bigger.

Delicious! Chewy, amazing homemade bagels!! Three things differently, not unlike anyone else - I don't have a bread machine, so I just proofed the yeast (let it get foamy in the water with sugar), then proceeded to add flour and salt - kneaded slightly and let it rise in the oven for a half hour. I only made six, and skipped the last step. Didn't miss the egg on top. Very versatile, they were amazing plain, but I'm sure we'll be making these over and over again - probably topped with many different things. Thanks for sharing!!! **They were not ugly! You can totally tell that they're homemade by looking at them, but I didn't have time to let them rise like everyone suggested. I stuck to the recipe, and I'm very glad I did.

These bagels were so easy to make-especially when the machine does most of the work! I colored them orange( food coloring in the water) for Halloween for my college student and her dorm mates. I need to figure out however how to make balls out of them after I cut them into 9 pieces-they were not very smooth on the bottom but looked great from the top. I added sesame seeds on half, but will use poppy seeds next time-black and orange make better Halloween colors. Will definitely make these again!

Very good! Next time I will take other reviewers advice and let the bagels sit for an hour after molding, and boil each side for 2 mins.  They look pretty ugly, but taste wonderful! :)

Really good! My bagels are quite ugly (I should have spent more time shaping them!), but they were really yummy. I skipped the egg white and poppy seeds, and sprayed them with a little vegetable oil instead. I will make them again and again! Thanks for sharing, Cristy!

really good and surprisingly easy!  The only things I changed were using honey instead of sugar in the dough and molasses instead of sugar in the boiling water.  They were slightly crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I can imagine they will only get better as I experiment with toppings and add ins.

Excellent sandwich rolls; nice & chewy, but not quite as dense & cruchy-crusted as I like. Next time I'll reduce the yeast a little (I always seem to need less than the recipe calls for) and maybe increase oven temp a little.  Will repeat next time I make hamburgers; hate fluffy "Wonder" buns.  Your taste may vary.

My husband went crazy for these!  It was my first time making bagels, and it was so much fun!  I made 3 with poppy seeds on top, 3 with cinnamon/sugar, and 3 with onion soup mix (mostly the dehydrated onions).  Try this recipe!

Oh my goodness. I just got done making these bagels with my husband, and they are AMAZING. They really are so much better than bagels from a bagel shop. I'm looking forward to experimenting with different flavor combinations. Thanks SO much for the recipe!

Yum!! And very easy to make. I didn't have any cornmeal and they turned out fine. I also used butter instead of egg white as I didn't have a brush. Will be making again, probably tomorrow!!

Fantastic flavor and texture!  I doubled the recipe and made 12 bagels; they were the perfect size.  My bread machine is tiny, so I used the stand mixer to knead the dough, cut it into 12 pieces and let it rest about 15-20minutes.  Then I rolled the dough and pinched the ends (just because I wanted to) and let it rise about 30 minutes until the bagels looked puffy.  Boiled closer to 2 minutes and since I wasn't putting any topping on I didn't use the egg wash.  Baking time was a little less than the recipe called for in my oven.  When I asked my son what he thought, he said "they're just...good!" - high praise, indeed!

I read the other reviews which were helpful and incorporated some of the recommendations:  Increased the water to 1 1/8 cup, Boiled for 1 minute each side,  and I let the dough rest for 45 minutes following the formation of the bagels.  The results were terrific! This is my type of bagel, chewy and tender.  Great recipe and highly recommended!

The most important part of my review is that the water/flour ratio is what I would consider way off for a bread recipe. I had to add at least an additional 1/4c of water, if not a bit more to get the right consistency. ALSO, they were really, really hard to remove from the pan after baking, and I lost about 1/2 of each bagel, and am soaking pans as we speak.  That said, the flavor of these was right on for me. They taste fresh and wonderful. However, they texture was not quite right, and was probably my fault. I let them rise for about an hour after shaping per other reviews, and then they were 1. hard to get from the pan to the water, and 2. They had and airy, breadlike consistency, not heavy like a store-bought bagel. I brushed them with melted butter, and sprinkled half with cinnamon suger as requested by my 4 year old, and the other half with Romano cheese and a tiny bit of garlic salt. I have eaten two of those in the hour since they came out of the oven, and they are really awsome!   I will be making these again soon (tomorrow, maybe?), and will follow the recipe (except to use butter instead of egg for the wash) and see if they have better texture. This recipe was so fast and simple, you could make these every day, and play with the toppings. Yum! Thanks for the great recipe!

This came out quite good- they tasted very much like better quality bagels. I made mine the size of mini bagels, then topped them with pizza topping for home made 'bagel bites'. Yummy!

This was my first time making bagels and they were a great hit.  They did come out a little ugly, but the taste was wonderful.  Next time I think I might use a glass or coffee mug to cut out the bagels instead of using my hands.

These were great, I did mix them in my stand mixer because my bread machine has finally given up after 15 years and alot of use! I think the stand mixer way is faster anyway. Would make again, thanks for the recipe

Taste is good but I think something is wrong. They rose very few... Reading around I guess is because they have to cook more or should let be rise before boiling.

My daughter made these for a 4h project.  They turned out well.  They will be better the more she makes them, and I don't like the bread machine I was using ( I borrowed my mom's) but other than that they were great.

These are very good!  I've tried out several bagel recipes and this is definitely one of the better ones.  I make 8 bagels from the recipe, and sprinkle poppy seeds on top without the egg wash.

I adapted this recipe to make one huge bagel.  I don't use the bread machine (I just let the dough rise for about 1 hour) and I didn't boil the bagel either.  Covered it with sesame.  Yum!

Having never made bagels before in my life I figured I'd give this recipe a shot. Not only were they very tasty and great with butter or cream cheese, but even my roommate born and raised in New York approved of them!

I love this recipe!  I did increase the water by 1/8 cup as others had noted. This was the second time I made them in the past few weeks. The first time I made 8 bagels; this time I made 6 bagels and they were nice and big!  I freeze them and eat them as I want to. They are so delicious; I will never buy store bought bagals again.

These were fun to make...they stuck to my pan horribly and I'm fairly certain that I would have liked them better without the egg glaze! Otherwise thank you for easy to make bagel recipe. If I make this recipe again I will A)allow to rise on wax paper so I can more gently put on my big slotted spoon to boil and B)Either cook on wax paper or grease my pan!

My bagels did not rise.  they were flat as a pancake.  Yeast was brand new, just opened, so it could not have been that.  I was very disappointed, as I am an experienced baker.  I don't know if I even want to try again, as it was pretty labor intensive.  Oh well..

AMAZING! I've tried bagel recipes before, and they just didn't turn out well. I followed this recipe to a T, aside from omitting the egg wash and poppy seeds. They were a little crisp on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. DE-LISH! I put them in an air-tight container, and they were great the next day for breakfast as well.

These turned out great. I even screwed up by putting thawed out berries into it (which made the dough wet and slipper). I managed to save it by putting more flour in and they turned out great...and purple!

This is a five star winner!  It's easy, but does take time (worth every minute).  I add a tablespoon of molasses to the boiling water to give it a bit of a glaze.

Definitely easy to make, and tasted great toasted afterwards.  However, my mom tried to eat one without toasting it & said it was way too tough.  Maybe decrease the baking time?   I'd also make them a little bigger next time; they were tiny! Made the dough a second time and used it for pizza dough, using whole wheat flour for half the flour.  Turned out delicious!

Very nice recipe!  This is my first attempt at bagels.  They are time consuming!  After making the dough in the bread machine, I did let it rise for 30 minutes, pinched it down and formed the bagels, and then let them rise for another 30 minutes before boiling them.  I'm looking forward to trying these with different flavors.  They are nice and crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Yum!

Great super to make recipe! The hardest part is just waiting for the dough to rise! Snappy outside, soft chewy inside. Rolling and pinching them makes them more uniform, and be sure to add the egg white for that shiny glossy golden brown finish you expect in a bagel.  I'll be testing the extra rising, as well as mixing in cinnamon, or cheese into the next few batches! We may never buy store bought bagels again!

Much better than Einstein bagels.I tried brushing on egg whites before baking and also olive oil. The olive oil kept slight oily feel after baking. I would prefer using the egg whites. I have also make cinnamon raisin bagels adding about 1 tsp of cinnamon and 2/3 cup raisins and an extra tb of sugar. Every time I have made these they come out wonderful. I would also suggest laying the bagels on a floured surface when you are letting the rise before boiling. You can make mini bagels and use left overs for pizza bagels. I use this recipe often.

Excellent bagels!!! My daughter and I are addicted to them. I make it at least once a week. I agree with some other reviewers that you should add a bit more water, maybe 1-2 TBSPs.  Thank you for the recipe.

These are really good bagels, honestly with this little batch you can save some time if you just do it by hand and not use the bread machine. Top them with your favorite ingredients, I used sesame seeds, cheddar cheese, and just left them plain. They were a huge hit!

All-purpose flour or bread flour?  I have made this recipe using AP and bread flours.  This recipe works a lot better with bread flour - yields a firmer dough that holds a better shape.  When I used AP flour all I got was a goopy mess.  There isn't enough gluten in AP flour to maintain the density/chewiness that makes a true bagel.  And just out of curiosity, I tried this recipe without boiling, and what a difference...no boiling = dry bagels.  This is a good basic recipe to add whatever flavorings/toppings you like.

This recipe was good. I have actually made this twice. The first time, I followed the directions exactly exept for I don't have a bread machine. I used my stand mixer. Let me tell you, HUGE MISTAKE! It made a mess everywhere. The bagels tasted good but were flat and they didn't float in the water.
The second time I made this, I mixed everything by hand which worked GREAT! I sifted the flour (and even put in 1/2 wheat) and after reading reviews, let raise for 2 hours prior to boiling. Viola! Near perfect bagels! And my two toddlers have been eating them like crazy!

This recipe was easy to follow and tasted great.  My husband even liked them and he's from NY!  The only change I made was the topping, I used 1 tbs each of poppy, sesame, and a garlic and onion blend.  That mixture made an amazing everything bagel.  I made 9 of these like the recipe stated and they were the perfect size for me!

These  are simple and delicious!  I did one batch in the machine and one batch with the Kitchen Aid.  Both came out great.  I threw in raisins and cinammon.  I sprinkled with a cinn. brown sugar mix before baking.  Then about 15 minutes before done, I spread them with the same mixture that had been mixed with butter.  That made a gooey, yummy topping.  Tasted like cinn. rolls!

For bread machine bagels, these really are great.  Best eaten when still warm, but still ok when heated in a toaster oven later.   I never could get my bagels to look pretty and smooth like you find at a bagel shop, but the taste was more important to me anyway.

Absolutely wonderful taste. I made three different batches. Garlic, Onion and a cinnamon raisin. I let them rise for about an hour before the boiling water bath. They remind me so much of the Panera bread bagels.

Made these by hand (not bread machine), didn't use cornmeal (didn't have any), and didn't do the egg wash.  This was my first attempt at bagels and they turned out really good.

EXCELLENT! I used my stand mixer, let the dough rise, punched down and rise again, then followed the recipe exactly. These are wonderfulm, and i can't wait to experiment and add cheese and other flavoring to other batches.

This is a truly great recipe. I made these today with my kids and it was a fun project for us. I had never made bagels before and was unsure if they would be good the first time around. They were awesome! We used 1 1/8 cups of water, and we also brushed them with olive oil instead of egg. Our toppings were all different. We used lawry's seasoning salt, cavendars seasoning, and one with rosemary, sea salt and pepper that was our favorite! We had so much fun we hope to make this a weekend activity. I don't think we could buy a bag of store bought bagels again!

These bagels were fairly easy to make, if you have alot of time. I added some gluten to make them more chewy.  They tasted like Sara Lee Bagels.  But I agree with another review on making bagels, I think I'll stick to buying them at the market.

These were very good bagels. I've made these twice so far, and the only change I have made is to add an extra 1/8 cup water at the beginning because otherwise my bread machine really struggles with the dough. Oh, and I also gave myself a really bad steam burn turning the bagels in the boiling water the first time so watch out!

I wanted more bagels so I increased the servings to 12 since my bread machine can handle 4 cups of flour.  It worked great!  After coating with the egg we topped them with cinnamon-sugar, garlic salt & onion flakes, sesame seeds, extra sharp grated cheddar cheese. Every one of the combos was popular and worked well.  Note: I let them rise longer than the recipe states before boiling them.

This recipe was absolutely amazing.  We moved from Upstate New York several years ago and miss fresh bagels. We topped some with salt/garlic/onion/poppyseed and others filled with dried cherries and topped with cinnamon sugar.

First time making bagels and I am so proud of myself!  These turned out better than I expected.  They looked just like a bagel I would buy at a bagel shoppe.  Chewy on the outside and soft on the inside.  On 1/2 I sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on top before baking.  My boyfriend really loved these.  Let's just say, there are none left!  This is one of my cooking triumphs!

I made bagels for the first time this weekend and it turned out GREAT! The only change i made if to add 1/8 cup additional water because my bread machine was struggling with the dough. I live in Malaysia and have been looking for good bagel that doesn't cost me a bomb (MRY 9.90 for a plain bagel with cream cheese and a cup of tea). My search is over. I'll be making this often.

I think these are fabulous! I am new to the whole bread making thing and I love it. I love the fact these bagels are dense and chewy. I didn't put seeds or anntthing but egwhites on them before I baked them and both me and my husband thought the were great! I need a little work to make mine "pretty" but with a little practice they'll be even better than the ones at the store...and A LOT cheaper too!

Excellent bagels.  The holes filled in on mine but still came out delicious.  Crispy outside, chewy inside.  This is my first time attempting bagels but this is the only recipe I need.

These turned out very well.  I was please as this was my first time to make bagels.  I do not have a bread machine.  I mixed the dough in my Kitchenaid stand mixer.  Therefore, I mixed the flour and yeast together first with a little of the sugar and let it sit for 10 minutes.  I let the dough rise for about an hour.  Then I separated into 8 balls of dough.  I punched a whole in the dough with my thumb and stretch the bagels with my hands.  I then let them rise for 30 minutes on some silpat.  I boiled the bagles for 3 minutes on each side.  Then baked as per the recipe.  I also added molasses instead of sugar to the water to give the bagels and nice rich color.  They turned out nice and chewy and even looked better than I expected.

My first attempt at bagels and they came out great!  I followed some other reviewers and added 1/4 of a cup more water to the bread machine, replaced 1 cup of bread flour with whole wheat, and let the bagels rise for 30 mins after shaping them.  I definitely will not be winning any bagel shaping contests, but they taste great!

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I would advise boiling the bagels for about 3 minutes (1.5 minutes per side).  Also, if you want to make 100% whole wheat bagels, make sure you add about 4.5 tsp of gluten in order to make the bagels fluffy.  Otherwise, I personally think they come out way too dense.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the greatest bagel recipe!  I have made some alterations for various mix-ins... I have added rosemary and black olives, adding a little more salt for one kind, and for another added more sugar, almost 1/3 cup and topped with asiago cheese to make the sweet/salty contrast.  The bread machine makes it so easy and fun!  I also skip the egg wash and bake mine on a stoneware pan, which yields a bit crispier of a crust.

I really enjoy the flavor of the bagels. The first time I made these, I followed the directions exactly and was a little disappointed in the density and size of the bagels.  The second time, I let the dough rise for an additional hour and I think it made a huge difference in the texture of the bagel. I would give these a 5 star, but I still think that the bakery near my home has the best.

Very good. I used mostly whole wheat flour and a very small amount of bread flour. I also added wheat gluten to fluff up the dough a bit. They came out very well. I also only made 6 from the recipe instead of the recommended amount. Fabulous!!

Very good!  Not as hard to shape as I thought, although I think practice makes perfect. I sprinkled some with cinnamon/sugar and some with Italian seasoning.

FANTASTIC!  I can never bring myself to pay $2-$3 a bag at the grocery store for bagels - but now I can make them myself at minimal cost, and they taste more like Einstein's Bagels than grocery store ones anyway.  Delicious!

Thanks much!

This was my first time making bagels and they were the best bagels I've ever had.  I attribute that fully to the recipe.  I didn't use poppy seeds.  I used the cornmeal on the baking sheet, but the bagels were hard to get off the pan when they were finished baking(even with a metal spatula.  Next time I will just line the baking sheet with parchment paper.

These were fun to make! I've always wanted to make bagels. This recipe was easy enough. I doubled the recipe. I did it by hand without my bread machine since it was making this funky weird noise. No biggy to do by hand. My dough wasn't hard to work either. I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white and added vital gluten instead of using bread flour. It rose for about an hour before I shaped into bagels. I didn't flatten like the recipe said since they pretty much keep the same shape all throughout the process. I topped with blue poppy seeds. They sure are good.

This is my first time making bagels and I can't believe how easy it was. I used a combo of bread flour, all-purpose and wheat flrs because I wanted a healthier fare and I didn't have enough bread flour on hand. I took the advice of others and added water to the machine during the kneading process- this saved my machine from unnecessary overdrive!
I love a plain bagel. I made 8 nice sized bagels and rubbed some EVOO on top and sea salt. I love this recipe; no more store bought bagels for me. Can't wait to have my husband sample them before I eat them all!

Very easy and delicious!!!  I don't have a bread machine, so I mixed the ingredients in my Kitchen Aid Mixer and let the mixer knead the dough for 5 minutes or so.  Then I let the dough rise for about 2 hours.  I followed the rest of the recipe...YUMMY!  The kids love them also.

i didn't have bread flour, so i used all purpose with 1 teaspoon of wheat gluten for every cup of flour called for.  they came out wonderfully!  i topped half of mine (i made 8 instead of 9) with sesame seeds and half with dehydrated chopped onion that i rehydrated with a little of the boiling water i had going for the bagels.  they were great right from the oven, but i can't wait for tomorrow morning to toast one and top it with cream cheese!  thanks for the recipe!

These were really good!  Everyone was so impressed (even me) that they looked like "real" bagles.  I gave some to a few friends at work and they all said "You MADE these?"  ;)  I used sesame and parmesan as a topping.  Yum!

I made these Saturday and the house is already asking for more! The bagels are not difficult to make at all. They do require some effort, but don't all good foods? I'll never buy store bought again. I followed the recipe as closely as my ingredients allowed. We didn't have poppy seeds, so I omitted those with no ill effect. Also, we have no cornmeal, so I just sprayed the cookies sheet with cooking spray and they came out beautifully. Thanks for a great recipe!

EXCELLENT!!!!  I added a 1/2 Cup of frozen blueberries 1/2 way through the kneading.  Had to add more flour because of that.  Was worried they wouldn't turn out but did.  First time making bagels.  Turned out wonderful!  Thank you and will use again and again!

Must have done something wrong.  Dough was very dry and wouldn't roll into balls, therefore my bagels turned out lumpy and doughy.  Quite ugly too.  Might come out better a second time if I watched the flour more closely, but a little too much work to bother.

I made these by hand because I don't own a bread machine. I started by proofing the yeast with the warm water and sugar, then added the other ingredients and followed the recipe from there. They are excellent: soft on the inside and perfectly chewy on the outside. My only regret is not doubling or tripling the recipe initially and freezing the extra bagels. (I only got 5 bagels using this recipe.)I will be making these again and again. Thanks!

These are FANTASTIC.  So easy too.  I made them exactly as written except that I added the 1/8 cup of water others suggested when my machine started thudding from the dough being too dry.  I topped mine with sesame seeds and coarse ground salt.  The best bagels outside of Brooklyn!

I made these with honey and 100% whole wheat flour + 1/4 cup of vital gluten, I sprinkled flax seeds, pumpkin seeds and some grated parmesan (3 flavors,not everything bagels) and on the 3 different types I sprinkled a little black pepper and salt. They were awesome. I've tried other recipes but Im sticking to this one. We moved to N.C. from N.Y.C,let me tell you Im glad I can make my own bagels now.

Brilliant. So good, we'll make these again and again. Made a mixed batch with dehydrated onion, sesame seeds, caraway seeds and kosher salt. Can't wait to start tinkering with the recipe to see if I can sneak some whole grains in there.

Nice recipe.  My bagels turned out like our local chain bagels.  I added the addition of 1 T. malt powder, this improved the dough's flavor as well as rising.  The recipe only made 6 medium/large, I proofed the bagels 30 minutes not 10, and I had to interfere with my bread machine near the end of kneading ( to knead by hand) as I started to smell the motor running too hard.  I have a top of the line machine, but you really ought to be careful of burning it out on account of just 1 recipe.

I made 9 bagels like the recipe said; they were a nice size for a breakfast but don't expect the giant bagels you get at bagel shops.  Next time I won't press the dough and twirl it - my bagels ended up flat with a very wide hole since the dough does not rise much after shaping.  I think I will gently stretch the dough ball to make 9 smaller bagels or 6 larger ones for a big breakfast.  The flavor was just great; my husband hsn't stopped raving about them!

I live in Sydney now, originally from the states. They have NO bagel shops here and it is impossible to find bagels anywhere! I made these today in my bread machine and OMG they were fantastic, a taste I have definetly missed! My husband, never having one before, being from Oz couldn't believe how beautiful they are. Thank you sooooo much fom Australia!!!!!

Very Very good!! Turned out perfect! They were soft, moist, and golden, and tasted tasted 10 times better than any store bought ones!!! I doubled the recipe and it made 18 medium-small bagels!! I made it for supper with Fresh Veggie Bagel Sandwiches(from this site) and with Strawberry Cream Cheese Spread(also from this site). I make dinner once a week(I am 16) and everyone said it was the best yet! Thanks!!!!!!

My bagel-forming skills need some work, but as far as taste goes, these are absolutely awesome! Because I wasn't sure how they would turn out, I just made them plain. Now I know how good they are, I'll definitely be experimenting with cheese, onion, cinnamon, blueberries etc. Thanks so much, Cristy!

Out of this world good!!! I got my bread machine 7 years ago when I got married and used it maybe twice. Since discovering this recipe I have about worn it out. I think I make these bagels at least 3 times a week. Everyone loves them. We all agree that they are as good as Einstein Bros. bagels and better than Bruegger's...we won't even mention how much better than anything from the grocery store. I wish I could give this 10 stars!

We doubled this recipe, used 2 cups wheat flour, 4 cups white and they turned out wonderfully.  The doubling resulted in ten good-sized bagels.  Toasted they're perfecto!

First time I've ever made bagels and they turned out brilliantly. Took other reviewers' advice and made 6 instead of 9, but otherwise followed recipe exactly. They were a huge hit with Mr P who is now demanding them for his regular Sunday treat. Thanks for the recipe.

These were great! I followed another reviewer's advice and added a tablespoon of gluten, boiled them for 1 min, and used sesame seeds for toppings but otherwise followed the recipe. They were moist and chewy inside, nicely browned outside, but not especially crisp. My husband said he'd never wanted to eat a bagel untoasted with butter before, but these were great! The only part I had a little trouble with was the eggwhite glaze, but that's probably my lack of experience. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and my first batch turned out very nice. I topped some with sesame seed and some with poppy seed. The next time, I tried adding blueberries right at the end - bad idea. The dough didn't hold together and got all slimy.  Next time, I'll take a safer route and just try adding a little dried onion flakes at the start. Try these, you'll like them!

Excellent and easy to tailor with different flavors and toppings.  Better to make 6.  Rolling dough and making a loop makes a more authentic bagel.

I used half wheat and half white flour.  I also used my kitchen Aid instead of the bread machine and the bagels were great.  I have tried several recipes in the past and these came out the best so far.

Great bagels.  I made them for fun and I was pleased with the result.  I let them rise in the bread machine and followed the instructions of shaping dough balls in the advice part of allrecipes.  Instead of flattening them out, I took the end of a ice cream scoop and pressed it into each ball to make the hole, then I swirled the bagel around the handle while keeping the bagel on the counter.  It made the bagel more uniform than the swirling around the finger trick.  I let them rise again and proceeded with the rest of the recipe.  They tasted great.  I used flax seed, oat bran, wheat germ, whole wheat flour, and white flour and my kids still ate them...toasted and buttered, of course.  Makes 6 regular bagels, or 9 smaller and flatter bagels.  Great fun.

These bagels were awesome! They tasted just as good, if not better, than storebought, and are a lot healthier, too. I made them with whole wheat bread flour and even my little brothers (who hate anything wheat) loved them! I definitely want to make this again.

I cannont imagine ever buying bagels again.  I followed previous reviewers' advice and only made six bagels and they were the perfect size to eat alone or use for a bagel sandwich.  I am really looking forward to experimenting with different additions and toppings.  These could not be easier to make and the results are exceptional.

These were pretty good.  They were somewhat crunchier than I expected, but that wasn't a bad thing.  They looked really good, even on my first attempt.  A little squirt of cooking oil spray made all the difference with removing them from the tray after baking.

I have tried several bagel recipes and didn't like the way any turned out until I tried this one.  The bagels turn out perfect every time.  Try adding dried cranberries or raisins.  This works really great too.

Never thought of making my own bagels until now, and I'm so glad that I did!  It took a couple of batches to get them really smooth and nice looking, but worth the effort...also, make sure the hole is big because the bagels rise in the boiling process, as well as in the oven.  I've made several variations, a batch including adding a touch of orange zest and a 1/2 cup dried orange flavored cranberries, and a batch with a 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  I'm excited to try a few others like pesto or garlic parmesan.

This recipe was sooo easy to make. I can't believe how good they came out. The outside is crispy and the inside is soft. I made the bagels with 1/2 natural unbleached white flour and 1/2 of a combination of whole wheat and spelt flour. 

I added finely chopped garlic to the egg white, and made 2 bagels with veggie parmesan, 2 with sesame seeds, and 2 with cinnamon sugar. I like good sized bagels, and 9 would have been too small.

Now I don't ever have to buy bagels again!!!

Wow.  I never thought that making bagels would be so easy.  I like a more fiber in my diet so I modified the recipe by using 1.5 cups whole wheat flour and 1.5 cups bread flour.  Result, fantastic wheat bagels.

EXCELLENT!  I tried a recipe in my Better Homes Cookbook and it turned out a terrible, burnt, gooey mess...my daughter was disgusted. But even in a time crunch and cutting corners this recipe turned out excellent!!! I added raisins and cinnamon...very delicious!

Great recipe. The finished product tasted like "real" bagels; far superior to the recipe from my bread machine recipe book. I did grease the pan before dusting with cornmeal to prevent the bagels from sticking. They were a family hit!

We love bagels and have been looking for as many short cuts as possible to make
yummy ones.  This one fits the bill.  However, I made six instead of nine.  Nine makes
them way too small.

What a great recipe. Thank you. I was a great success the first time. Just one thing: the bagels stuck to the pan. Perhaps I did not use enough cornmeal.I will try greasing the non-stick pan the next time, and then add the cornmeal

This is just the recipe I was looking for. Much better than the bagel recipe in my bread machine manual.

Since the only store to buy bagels at in our city is the grocery store, I was thrilled to find this recipe!  It was so easy, and VERY yummy!  I used 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 regular flour to make wheat bagels, and they were wonderful!  I can't wait to make more flavors!  Thank you!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  i did a little variation by crushing a clove of fresh garlic into my eggwhite before basting my bagels.  Then i topped them with fresh grated parmesan cheese. They were Delicious!!

Worked up super easy (thank you bread machine).  Nice taste and texture.  I have made bagels previously minus the bread maker, and found they were tastier.  I may substitute the white sugar for brown sugar the next time as that is the only real difference between this recipe and my old stand by

This was my first attempt at making bagels and this recipe turned out great.  My husband and I each devoured some fresh from the oven (I let them rest only a few minutes), graced with extra creamy butter.  I froze the rest in a zip freezer bag so I won't be tempted to eat all of them.  Next time I plan to use honey in the boiling water instead of sugar.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I posted a photo.

Great recipe!  I lower my cook temp to 350 and cook for about 18 minutes.  I also don't bother boiling them, they turn out absolutely fine without that step.  When shaping my dough I  get the top just a little bit wet with water to make the toppings I'm putting on stick a little better - usually asiago cheese.

I have made these a few times now. I did the additional water as suggested and I used the molasses in the boiling water. My family loves these and now won't touch store bought bagels. Saying those ones are 'plastic'. I will be trying jalapeno and cheddar next time and garlic and onion. 
Thank you for sharing this recipe. It's perfect and easy.

Absolutely delicious! I did find that they come out on the smaller side. Next time I will double the recipe and just make it a dozen. Also, if you add jalapenos into the dough, those ones don't rise. However, perfect consistency, delicious recipe, and very easy.

Love these! I listened to the reviews and used 1 1/8 cups water and I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 Tbsp. They are really fun to make and taste amazing. My only question is, why do they taste more like English muffins than bagels? Again, they are delicious, but they don't remind me of the bagels I get at the store or at bagel shops. The first time I made them, I boiled for 1 minute on each side. The second time I did one minute total. Didn't really notice any difference.

These are so good. I did use 1+ 1/8 cup of water like suggested but kept everything the same! Forgot to brush with egg white and found that it’s totally fine to skip this step. It’s more of an comestic thing

I am allergic to corn so I don't use cornmeal to help prevent the bagels from sticking to the pan but just butter the pan first.  I only make 6 bagels.   

Question: I need a nice hamburger bun recipe so would this recipe work if I don't boil the buns?  I am having a lot of trouble finding a nice light hamburger bun recipe.

I made 12 mini bagels with Trader Joe's Everything Bagel seasoning. 

The only other change I made was to brush the tops with melted butter instead of egg white. Two reasons - I prefer the texture when I use butter and I was out of eggs.

Anyway, these were amazing. My kids loved them and this recipe is definitely a keeper.

Fantastic.... I turned on my bread machine on Dough setting while i put the ingredients in the pan, Amazing!!  Must have saved me 1/2 hr......  Makes 6 nice sized ones! In this order i put in the Bread Machine....    ****!  I also added 1 1/8 Cup of water, salt,sugar,all purpose flour, then yeast.  I added honey to the boiling water also.....  Put a sheet of Parchment Paper on your cookie sheet so your Bagels don’t stick.  I used 1 egg white to brush on them when they come out of the boiling water and then added a mixture of seeds... FANTASTIC RECIPE! ***************************************************************

I’m a 62 yr old guy who loves to bake. I made these yesterday for the first time ever and I couldn’t believe how awesome they turned out. They were nothing less than perfect! My daughter told me they are the best bagels she’s ever had. I wish I could give it 10 stars.

I used cookie cutters (one large one and a small one for the hole) to form the bagels. I formed the last one by creating a long ribbon of dough and forming it into a circle. I brushed the top with butter flavored olive oil and then dipped some in "Everything Bagel Seasoning" and left the others plain. The recipe only made six bagels, but they look and taste great!

This is a good recipe. The bagels tasted and "chewed" as they should. I made a second batch however, and instead of shaping 9 bagels, I made 6. The original 9 were a little small I thought.

Made it twice, the first time wo bread flour (used AP), and cutting every corner for time and it came out ok, but not chewy and kind-of like bagel-shaped bread. The 2d time, still wo bread flour, I upped the gluten by doing 1/2 white wheat, used 1 1/2 c water, also kneaded the dough and roped it out before forming the bagels to rise (30 min), and I took a second to glaze w egg before baking. Perfect.

Very simple, and my bagel-loving son tells me they are "amazing." I did whole wheat instead of white flour, and they turned out great.

I made 7 with melted butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar on top- BETTER than Panera! Then I made a second batch, with cheese in the dough cycle, egg white wash- added more cheese sprinkled after they came out from the oven. Beautifully shaped, perfectly browned, chewy yet firm- couldn't ask for a better recipe- THANK YOU!!

I ended up with a soup in my bread machine...portions are WAY off for the liquid content. Maybe don't list how much water to heat up for step 2 as an ingredient... then fix how much water to put in the machine.

This is an amazing recipe and homemade bagels are an absolute game changer!!  I had no idea!!!

Was hard to roll the dough into balls then pierce a hole and have them look great. Might try the cookie cutter approach someone else suggested next time. Followed the recipe as directed (except half the dough I mixed in some Asiago cheese) and they turned out wonderful. Mixed in Asiago in half of the dough and topped with more Asiago. The other half I topped with dried chopped onion, garlic salt, and poppy seed for an "everything" bagel. Yummy! Will make again. Makes 8 large bagels or 10 grocery store sized bagels.

I followed reciept all most to the t.
The only thing I do differently for everything I bake is follow instructions on container of yeast and let the yeast sugar and water rise by itself for 10 min before I add everything else. Always works better this way.

The flavour of these bagels was just right!
I don't live in the US, so I have to make my own bagels because I simply can't buy them anywhere. This is by far the best "result for effort" recipe I tried. Sure they're better if you make them traditionally, but who has the time nowdays?

If you want your own fresh bagels every morning, the trick is to organize and prepare in advance, preferably in the evening, after dinner. I prepare everything then. 
Bread machine loaded and set on timer to 6.45 (or later at weekends), floured surface at the counter,  drying rack over the sink, pot of water on the stove, baking pan near the rack etc.  It takes 5-10 mins.
When I get up, I take the dough out, turn the oven on, and form the bagels in  cca. 5 minutes, and then I let them rest.
During the "rest-time" I set the water to boil and I go to take a shower. After shower, still in my robes, I cook 'em, dry 'em, transfer 'em, glaze'em, top 'em, and put them in an oven.
By the time the kids wake up, they're almost done.

Remarks.
I added that 1/8 of a cup of extra water as suggested in reviews.
Forming 9 bagels out of this amount of dough is too much. I usually form 6 pcs.
I let the bagels rise for 30-60 minutes at weekends, and they are definitely better.

P.S.
Make sure to OVERSEE your bread maker the FIRST TIME you're trying the recipe! I noticed that my bread maker doesn't have the power needed to knead such a thick and sticky dough, so it stucked overstrained! The electronic started to ma

I have never made bagels before. I love to cook and I've tried making most things. I had never thought about bagels. I love recipes that consist of ingredients I have already. These turned out really yummy. My dough didn't seem as able to be shaped at the recipe explains. It wasn't "sticky" so i couldn't really reshape it well. Therefore the shapes were more like bumpy bagels, lol, but taste was still there. I also did half with a cinnamon sugar coating to try to match that of Panera. Those are my son's favorite. I swiped the egg white wash with butter and dunked into cinnamon and sugar. I didn't add anything to the dough but next time with a teeny bit of cinnamon and using a course sugar on the top coating, I bet they turn out close to the Panera ones. All and all I loved it. Don't worry if the dough isn't very sticky and doesn't reshape well, my favor was still there. I'll be making again. (Edited) I've made these a few times now. A new favorite in our house. I noticed my bread machine setting is defaulted at 2lbs. This last time I adjusted to 1.5 and the dough was much "stickier" when done. I was nervous at first since it was so sticky. But it was easier to reshape and the bagels turned out lighter and airier. Thought I'd share in case someone else was wondering about that setting. Made a bit of a difference and the vote is for the better.

I made this for an office luncheon and all but one were eaten.  I saw that several people added extra water.  I usually wait until taking the dough out of the bread machine to see how sticky it is and will add flour on the cutting board if needed.  Then I work it in until I get the consistency needed.  I always use parchment paper when cooking bagels as I have found them to stick on the cookie sheet.  Dough was easy to work with.  Thank You

I add 1/4 cup Garlic & Herb Cream Cheese + 1 tsp dried oregano + 1/2 cup finely shredded hard cheese (like cheddar). After portioning the dough, I roll each portion out to about 10" (like a rope), then join the ends with a pinch before letting them sit & rise for at least 10 minutes. I parboil each bagel for 60 seconds (30 sec per side) then place on my silicone baking sheet liner, top with shredded cheese blend and bake as directed.

I always read reviews of a recipe and make changes as noted if several people have made the change and liked it.  Otherwise, I make a recipe as is at least once.

All that being said,  I made the following "tweaks":

I let the dough rest on the floured board, covered with a clean towel for about 10 minutes before I portioned it out.

I substituted the sugar in the boiling water  with 2tbsps molasses.

Once bagels were ready for the oven, I brushed them with a little EVOO and a few drops of sesame oil, then sprinkled them with raw sesame seeds, which toasted nicely in the oven.  

Bottom line:  OMGOODNESS!!!!!  We moved from LA to Boise, ID two years ago.  Not quite the  same food culture, including bagels, as you may imagine,  but I am glad I can get my bagel fix at home now!!

Wonderful!  So excited about this. They came out perfect on the first try. According to some reviews I used a little extra water, and let them rise for about 30 min prior to boiling. Some of the holes had almost closed up after rising and we stretched them back out just before adding to the boiling water - worked great. They looked beautiful after baking and tasted unbelievable. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is the first time I've made bagels. I feel pretty proud of how they turned out.Very easy to use recipe that works and they taste terrific! I sprinkled them with brown sugar and cinnamon. Oh, and yes, I agree its helpful to add just a little more water to the dough.

Not the prettiest bagels ever but very tasty, only did a salt topping this time. Next time, I will do a more flavorful topping and maybe add some topping to the dough as well.

I have to say these are the best bagels!!! I did get 9 bagels. I let the dough rise only 10 after I shaped them and I would let it rise longer like others have suggested. But no complaints!! These have the best flavor!! I will be making these a lot!!!

Awesome. Used additional 1/8 cup of water. Added 1/4 cup dried onion. Made 8 bagels in total. Molasses instead of sugar when boiling. Boiled bagels for 1 minute a side. Used parchment paper and pan spray instead of egg wash. Topped with additional onion. Baked for about 30 minutes.

Amazing!  This was my first time making bagels. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding a tbsp of cinnamon to the bread machine. I didn't add extra rise time like others, and the bagels were deliciously moist and rose just fine. I didn't, however, have cornmeal and used whole wheat flour instead. This was a mistake. I'll probably just grease the pan in the future.

I was a little worried when the dough came out sort of stiff, but it taste amazing. I need to work on my rolling technique. It was a little bumpy but I don't think anyone cared.

I almost didn't make this because I only have all purpose flour, but the ap flour worked just fine. Added sautéed onions and garlic to the dough. Then added cheese on top of a few, absolutely delicious. I did have to increase the water by about 1/8. Won't be buying store bought bagels anymore!

Wonderful! I did let the dough rise for half an hour after taking it out of the bread machine. Added one tablespoon rosemary to the ingredients, and used olive oil on top instead of egg. No extra water or other changes. Perfect bagels! I think I'm going to try adding blueberries next, it seems like they would work well with this recipe.

I didn't have bread flour; I used whole wheat flour, gluten and let them rise three times. They came out beautifully and are delicious. I was surprised the recipe made only 9 bagels, will probably double recipe next time.

These are great my only problem was they stuck really hard to the bottom of the pan.  I did however skip the cornmeal step.  Is that why they stuck to the pan even after I oiled the pan?

They look a little weird, but it sure tastes great! I may try letting it rise longer after I've shaped it (like some suggest) to see if it will improve its appearance.

Great recipe! Since discovering this recipe couple of years ago I never went back to store bought bagels. You can substitute 2 tbsp of dry malt powder instead of sugar in the recipe to have that deli taste bagels. Love this recipe!!

For those of you wondering if you can double this recipe in your bread maker, the answer is NO! I ended up with a huge mess on my hands! My first batch turned out incredible- LOVE these bagels! Therefore we tried to double the batch- a big fat zero :(
I will stick with single batches and just have to make them every other day to meet my families' needs.

This recipe was great! I've made bagels before and almost burned out my stand mixer from mixing the thick dough. I never thought to make it in the bread machine! So much easier this way, and they taste great! I topped some of mine with poppy seeds, and some with cheddar cheese and garlic. We're almost finished the batch and I'm going to make more today!

I made these exactly as directed and they turned out great!  I love that you can just throw the dough in the bread machine and forget about it.  I only got 8 bagels out of the dough and they weren't very big but I have little kids so they actually were the perfect size for them!  I will definitely be making these again.

Awesome! I have soy allergy and I'm no longer to buy most store bought bagels due to them containing soy flour. The one brand I found that didn't contain soy was not very good. I made these last night and this morning I already need to make another batch. I will make a smaller number to get a bigger bagel this time. These have made my day! Thanks.

I just made these for the first time and they are delicious!!  I made 6 large bagels.  I added raisins and cinnamon to half and cheese to the other 3.  They were easy to make and taste amazing!  I will definitely be making these on a regular basis now.  I can't wait to try them with cinnamon chips now.

I also added 1/8 cup water. They turned our perfectly.  My children say they are way better than store bought. We have made cheddar cheese,  cinnamon and sugar, poppy seed, sesame seed, and plain.

The bagels are wonderful. We don't have a Jewish bakery here and the store bought bagels are a poor substitute for the real thing. Besides, making them myself I can actually add "everything" toppings (garlic, salt, poppy seeds and sesame seeds). I let mine rise longer so they are not so dense.

Great recipe! Even tough I did double the servings to make the same amount of bagels, that way I could make them bigger. I didn't have a bread machine but that's not a problem at all, it's really easy to make the dough. I added some sesame seeds and put them in the oven for about 15 minutes in the temperature suggested, and then a couple of minutes in grill mode, 10 minutes where not enough, maybe my oven wasn't that good or because mine where bigger then the suggested in the recipe. The grill gave the bagels the brown color on the top side. The taste was great and the texture was perfect.

This was awesome! I modified the cook time from another recipe. 500 oven preheat bagels in reduce to 450 eight minutes and turn sheet eight mor minutes. Let bagels sit for the fifteen and serve!

Fantastic!  Better than store-bought and incredibly easy.  I used 1 1/2 cups white, 1/2 cup spelt, 1/2 cup pumpernickel rye flour.  I also boiled with molasses and used olive oil instead of egg white, as suggested in the reviews.  I make 8 per batch because the dough divides easily that way.  I'll never buy bagels again.

I think the trick is the rising time.  I did let mine sit in bread machine for about 1/2 hr, then formed and let rise again for about an hour.  I added 2 tbsp brown sugar to the boiling water and created a sweet outside with perfect texture. I thought they were too hard right out of oven, then let them sit for a little and they were perfect.  My whole family raved about them and they stayed well in plastic bag for a few days before all gone.  I would suggest making double batch and bigger bagels.  I live in high altitude and did not adjust the recipe.

This was a simple recipe.  I learned two things when making it though...First, do not roll the divided balls flat.  Simply give them a press with your hand to flatten them somewhat and then poke the hole and spin the bagels.  Half of my batch ended up flat after baking because I crushed any work the yeast had done.  Second, Celery seed is NOT a good bagel topping.  The ones I put it one just tasted like celery.  It was very weird.  But the parmesan and plain ones tasted great.

This was the first time I have ever made bagels and they rocked! Very easy recipe. I added a little cinnamon sugar on top before baking and also used whole wheat that I grind myself. The texture and taste were awesome! I will continue to use this recipe.

I make this recipe all the time. I usually use the bread machine but today I am going to try the Kitchenaid so I can make a bigger batch. The only thing I haven't quite mastered is how to make them look nice. They are the ugly bagels because the holes always close but taste as good as Einstein Bros. I'm from NJ and have tried a lot of bagels :) Today I am going to try cutting bigger holes instead of just poking through with my finger. I will update this review if it helps.

Loved this bagel recipe - easy and delicious.  Purchased sesame, fennel and poppy seeds from a site called Nuts.com.  Really inexpensive and received the next day.  They are the perfect garnishments for these wonderful bagels - I would highly recommend.

These are very good and so easy! Chewy goodness. Now I don't have to buy them from the store and be disappointed. I did make some changes though, I increased my water like other reviewers suggested to.  I omitted the sugar and used 2 tsp non-diastatic malt powder in the dough and 1-2 Tbsp of the malt powder in the water instead.  I didn't have any bread flour on hand so used AP flour and added 2 tsp vital wheat gluten flour and I didn't brush with egg.  After they came out of the water, I just dipped the rounder side in topping of choice (onions for me) and baked.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, they taste great but the inside of the bagel was more like a roll than a bagel.  The outside was chewy but the inside was too light. Better than grocery store bagels but not as good as the great bagels at the bagel shop near my house.  I sprinkled the cookie sheet with cornmeal but the bagels stuck to the cookie sheet!

VERY GOOD. I don't have a bread machine so I used a mixer. Based on other reviews I let the dough rise for about an hour and I made the 8 bagels instead of 9 but I think if I made only 6 they would be a better size. They really turned out very good and I will probably make them again soon.

These are the best!  Thank you for sharing this!  My family loves them and has asked that I no longer buy bagels but make them.  We have added sweet and savory toppings.  Also make them plain.  We make sandwiches from these too - they are great!  I made no changes to the recipe at all.

These... were... AWESOME!!! My husband and I went crazy over these! Very dense and chewy just as a bagel should be.  If you follow the directions, they're very simple to make. I brushed mine with olive oil instead of egg white and they came out beautiful. For those of you who, like us, feel like you can't get a good bagel outside of Montreal... these come pretty darn close!

I made these today and followed the recipe with the slight change of adding fresh blueberries. Perhaps I should have done a first batch without blueberries because I'm not sure if my dough came out right. The dough was quite supple and the bagels fairly soft after baking (not dense like the store ones). In the end they still taste good but I think I will try dry blueberries next time.

These turned out great, easy peasy!! I followed the recipe as written minus the cornmeal because I didn't have it on hand. I greased the baking sheet with pam spray. I can't wait to make them again.

Used pumpkin bread recipe instead... Maybe try to mesh the 2 together? Pumpkin taste wasn't strong enough.

I folded in blueberries in half of the dough (per request of the husband) and those turned out pretty bad.  The other half of the dough, I folded in garlic and sprinkled garlic and sea salt on top.  That was great- I'll make the garlic ones again, but not the blueberry!

I just pulled these out of the oven and AMAZING!! These are so good, I put a shredded cheese blend on top before baking and I am so pleased with these. I think I flattened a couple of them out too much because they didnt rise as well as the other ones, but again, very happy with this recipes...Thank you for sharing it

I didn't expect to get the texture of a bakery bagel but this works!  I brushed the tops with egg white and then covered with sesame seeds.  I also made 6 larger bagels instead of 9 small and it worked perfectly.  I baked the maximum time to insure doneness.

I love this recipe!  I added in raisins and cinnamon, as suggested by another reviewer, and the final product was delicious!  I chose to brush the bagels with olive oil rather than egg... which gave them a nice crunch and shine!  I will be making this again and again!

These are AWESOME!!!  First time making bagels and after searching through lots of recipes, I landed on this one because it looked simple and had a high rating.  I'm glad I did - they were better than store bought bagels.  My whole family loved them!   I made mine w/ 2 c. whole wheat flour and around 3/4 c. white flour.  I added 1/3 c. gluten.  I did need to add extra water - about 1/3 c. as the bread was too dry to form at first.   For toppings I sprinkled  some w/ onion powder and pepper;  garlic powder and dried thyme; Mrs. Dash; and sesame seeds.  I also sprinkled a little kosher salt over all of the tops before placing them in the oven.     These were very easy to make and I know I'll be making them for many years to come!

This was great.  Chewy, dense, and versitile.  I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and added about a cup of raisins while the dough was mixing.  Will try asiago cheese next time. Thanks for sharing

Well now, that was easy. I made as stated, except I added about 1 tsp honey to the bagel mix, and I let them sit for about an hour before putting in the water. I only made 8. 4 plain, 2 w/kosher salt, and 2 with garlic/parm. I havent' tried the plain yet, but the two seasoned ones were yummy. Nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Who knew making bagels was so easy...and yummy **Update** Must eat day of, the next day...not so much on the yummy

Love these! So easy, and so good! The only change I made was to substitue one cup of whole wheat flour for the white flour, and they came out delicious. I can't wait to try varieties with raisins, blueberries, etc. Thanks for a great, easy to use recipe.

A four star rating just because no matter how many times we make these they never really look pretty. They do however taste great!  I use this recipe in my yeast breads cooking unit at school-- by hand without the use of the machine. My students really like these.  They customize their topping flavors---cinnamon and sugar seems to be the preferred topping.

These are great! The previous two occasions when I tried to make bagels (with other recipes) were disasters, but these have come out great both times I've made them. One note: be careful not to let the egg white drip on the pan when you're coating the bagels, or it'll seep underneath and the bagels will stick to the pan. Great recipe!

These are awesome..  I have never made bagels before and was SO impressed with the results.  They do look a little gnarly, like someone else posted, but I can get beyond that with the way they taste.  I will follow some other reviewers advice and allow them to rise after forming next time, hopefully that will improve appearance a tad!

I have always wanted to make homemade bagels but it seemed to hard. Ha! This was so simple! The bread machine does all the work. These did look narly and I don't know how to make them Professional looking. But, the taste is great and they are nice and crisp in the toaster. I will NEVER buy store bagels again!

Excellent and easy recipe. We live overseas and can't get bagels. This recipe really brought a taste of home. I made 8 from the recipe and did half in everything style (kosher salt, poppy seeds, sesame seeds, minced onion and minced garlic) and did the other half cinnamon raisin.  Used semolina instead of the cornmeal seeing that cornmeal is extremely hard to come by here and I have to save it for the cornbread ;)  Thanks again.

My boyfriend and I had excellent results with this recipe. However, we had to add a bit of extra water to the dough and another 1/4 tsp yeast. We got 8 good size bagels out of a batch the second time. We made one batch yesterday and liked them so much we made another batch today :) One note, though-Let them rise until they are pretty round and nicely shaped, which for us was 40 minutes in a fairly cold kitchen. This is a great recipe for the beginning bread machine experimenter (aka my boyfriend and I).

These are awesome. I usually do 8 bagels instead of 9-they turn out a little bigger and honestly it's just easier to cut the even number-lazy, lazy, what can I say. We've done these plain, poppyseed, with dried onion, as everything bagels. Can't wait to start experimenting with some add ins and have blueberry and honey wheat.

I'd baked and cooked many of the recipes on this website, and I LOVE this forum; I am yet to make a bad meal. This is my first time to give a review, but I could not help it, the bagels were AWESOME!!!! I just wish I had a commercial bread machine so I can make larger batches! I increased the water as recommended, added cheese and jalapeño to some; I am already thinking up other possibilities... THANK YOU for the great recipe and always fantastic advice by the members!

Followed recipe exactly.  They were smaller than I expected, but tasted great. I might let them rise a little longer before boiling next time.

These were okay. I boiled them but it seems like boiling them makes them bumpy and not very pretty. I baked one without boiling and they look more like the bagels they sell. However, maybe the authentic bagels look like the bumpy kind? The boiled ones tasted okay. Chewy exterior and soft interior. Don't know why they turned out not very pretty though. My bagels always look like this. Maybe I just need to work on it.

These turned out great! I had to add a couple extra tablespoons of water to the dough, and I cut the sugar down to just over 1 Tbsp. I omitted the sugar from the boiling water, the egg glaze and the poppy seeds, too. I'll definitely make them again - probably in a bigger batch next time! Thanks for the recipe!

These did not work for me. I made them in my bread machine and followed the recipe except for i let mine rise overnight in the frig until the next morning. They looked like they rose well but after boiling and baking they were sort of flat, so flat that when i sliced them in half all that was left of them was a crusty crunchy piece of flat bread. They had a nice taste. I dont think i will make them again.

I thought these were very good and tasted just like the ones we've bought from good bakeries. The bread machine makes it easy. I did use 2 T. molasses in place of the sugar. May try the sugar next time.

Excellent recipe, very easy! A cheap way to enjoy bagels which taste better than what you buy in a store and almost as good as what you get at the bakery. I can't wait to try out different toppings!

I think these bagels are alright. The best part about the bagels is actually making them. They are fun for the whole family. But personally, I would rather just buy some Trader Joe's bagels.

These were good but a little more like bread compared to what you buy.  I am going to try to make them again and see if there is a difference.  They were really easy to make.

These came out great. My first attempt at making bagels and won't be the last. I made a variety of flavors: sesame seed, onion and garlic, cinnamon and sugar, and plain. All of them were delicious. I can't wait to try other flavors.

Great recipe! My family likes a jalapeno cheese version. I add 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and 1-2 cans of diced jalapenos (or green chillies) to the dough. Then, after egg washing them, I put sliced jalepenos and shredded cheese on top. They're beautiful and soooo yummy!

Delicious!  Way better than store bought bagels!  These were easier to make than I thought they would be.  I made both poppy seed and sesame seed bagels.  The recipe was perfect; I didn't need to change a thing.  I will definitely make them again!

1/2 recipe made 4 bagels. try forming according to recipe next time. let sit for 1-2 hours after forming. make sure to grease pan well! Used bread machine yeast. Flip with spatula not tongs to keep fluffy. Try cinnamon raisin mixed in.

I also had trouble forming the dough, but the first batch came out tasting great anyway! I think they could be boiled a little longer, perhaps 1 minute per side instead of 30 seconds. I only made 6 out of one batch, and tried several toppings to see what was liked.

Never made bagels before.  Lot's of work but oh so worth it.  I put dried onion and dried parsley in the dough and then followed the rest of the directions and sprinkled more dried onion on the egg washed bagels.

I don't own a bread machine so i worked the dough with my hands. Let the dough rise for an hour after kneading, and another hour after forming the bagels. Sprinkled with onion flakes. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these bagels for the first time this afternoon and they turned out wonderful! I wanted to go for a little cinnamon-raisin action so I added 1 tablespoon cinnamon and about 2/3's cup raisins during the dough cycle. I boiled 15 seconds on each side per another reviewer's suggestion and then after the egg wash I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar over the tops... YUMMY! I live in East Asia and I thought these were very reminiscent of Panera's "Cinnamon Crunch Bagels." I'll definitely be making these again.

These do work SO perfectly, I don't change a thing except I make 8 large bagels instead of 6 gianormous ones. When the dough comes out of my bread machine I shape them and pop them into a warm (not hot) oven for 10 minutes while the water boils and they rise even more. Just as good as any bakery, and way cheaper!

These were so easy to make in the bread machine and they fun to make (I got a kick out of twirling them on my finger).  They are not pretty, but they taste like a bagel should and I think my kids will go crazy for them.  Thanks for sharing.

These make the BEST bagels I have ever had. I have been using this recipe for at least 2 years. I usually follow it exactly and have never had a problem. When you finally finish them and get to eat one fresh with cream cheese on it is so rewarding.

Ohhh my gosh!! These were outstanding!  Very chewy and good. I substituted 1 cup of the bread flour for whole wheat flour to make them a little healthier.  My kids loved them and keep asking for more.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just got done making these and they are sooooo good.  I did make a few changes though...first I did not use a bread machine...I also added 1 T. cinnamon and about 1 cup of "plumped" raisins to them. The turned out great! I had never made bagel before, so didn't know what to expect, but it was surprisingly easy. I definately recommend this to all!!! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these exactly according to the recipe (but with sesame seeds, of course!), and they are utterly awesome. They looked awful in raw format, but smoothed out nicely in boiling and baking. Just like the best Montreal bagels -- ones of the things I've missed most about living in the UK!

Loved these bagels.  They taste just as good as bakery bought. I topped some with seasame seeds, poppy seeds and cheese.  Will definatly make again.  Alittle time consuming but well worth it!!

tried it twice, the bagels didn't make it through the boiling -- they flattened out and never bounced back. after baking they were too dense and dry. seems like everyone else had success but i'm ready to try a different recipe.

These were wonderful!  My only suggestion would be to make sure you grap the ones you want before the rest of the family sees them.  I didn't and only got 1/2 of the last one.  Had to make another batch. Also, be sure you remove them from the cookie sheet right from the oven or they tend to stick to the cookie sheet.

These were pretty good. I used all whole wheat flour, as I was out of bread flour. Next time I'm going to add blueberries...that should be good. I agree with other reviewers though...this makes 9 small bagels. If you're looking for more "normal" sized bagels I would suggest making 6.

When I made a new batch of bagels today I did not heat up the water and they turned out great, this is my second batch and my husband and I both love them. I also made some mini ones which were great.

This recipe was so easy to follow and the bagels came out wonderfully.  I think next time I will make the bagels bigger though, as these were a bit on the small side.  
I have never made bagels before and this was an excellent place to start. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

i'll admit, i never actually got to eat one of these, but that should say something about how much everyone enjoyed them -- and yes, my family is jewish, with half of us from new york. i put poppy seeds and sesame seeds on top, and will do the onion/garlic thing next time. i will make these often. thanks for the great recipe!

Fabulous! I took other member's advice and added 1/8 - 1/4 cups of water in addition to what is stated. They turned out awesome, just like bagels. The original recipe made 8 mini bagels for me, which is awesome because my family eats small amounts at a time. Will make again for sure. My sister and brother in law looooved them. Good job!

I used this recipe because it seemed like it had the best ratings/reviews. However, I don't have a bread machine so I had to do all this by hand. Be advised - it is HARD! The dough is so dense that the kneading is like torture. Also, it's a really dry dough so it was hard to get the holes in the bagels to widen even though I swung them around on my fingers for several minutes. I thought this recipe would end up in disaster while I was making it, but I figured I had already gone so far that I might as well finish it. The end result was actually pretty good. I put a mixture of cream cheese, cinnamon sugar, and fresh blueberries on top - which was really good. The only change I might make is to cut the salt in half and perhaps use a little less flour.

These were excellent! I never dreamed I could make a bagel better than the ones I could buy!!! We're in the south, so there's not many bagel places (we only have a Brueggers... Panera's bagels don't count to me!). One thing I didn't do is let the dough go through the complete dough cycle in the machine - I took it out once it was done kneading and then let it rise a little while on the counter.  I think they would have come out a bit thicker if I had let them complete the cycle. I boiled them for a minute each side and they were nice and chewy (which may also have been b/c I added vital wheat gluten...I'm not sure!). I put salt and sesame seeds on top - YUM!!!

Great bagels.  Had to add about 1/4 cup of water as I found the dough too stiff.  Also added 1 tbsp of wheat gluten.  I will definitely make these again.

Good taste, not as sweet as I'd liked.  I wish there had been instruction on adding fruits.  I tried dried blueberrys and that worked ok so I kneaded in some frozen ones before baking.  Not the best idea.  I might try again sometime.  I'm not sure it's worth the time investment, but they were very good.

Yum yum!  Just made my first batch of these beauties I have to admit they were better than Einstein's AND Dunkin Donuts combined!!!  I was able to get six good sized bagels out of it and topped some with sesame seeds and some with sea salt.  Can't wait to try other variations!

In the middle of the first knead I checked my dough (as always) and like some of the other reviewers I had to add additional water -- somewhere between 1/8 and 1/4 cup.  I just went a tablespoon at a time until the dough had the right consistency.  Also, these do need to rise a bit more than the prescribed 10 minutes.

These are sure to become a weekend staple in my house!

I just finished baking my bagels and wanted to leave a positive review right away. They're not pretty, and that's my fault: I don't have the hang of the shape yet, but boy, are they delicious. Like another reviewer, I had to add more water to the dough because it was too dry to shape, and it definitely made the dough easier to work with. I also cut the dough into 6 pieces, and still, they were not the size of the bagels I'm used to from the bagel shops. They're more of a medium sized bagel, but that's probably a good thing. I'm already looking forward to making these again with a variety of toppings.

ever seen a square bagel??  guess i have some practicing to do!  nevermind that...these are WONDERFUL!!  hour and a half, start to finish and i was drooling and my stomach growling by the time they were cool enough to split and toast!!  i had the first batch in the oven (sesame seeds and morton's coarse kosher salt) and decided that i needed to make an onion batch, so started right away.  i, too, put molasses in the water (~2 T) and made only 6 bagels to a batch.  i'll NEVER BUY store bought bagels again when these are so quick and tasty!  thanks, cristy!

First time I have made bagels and they turned out perfect, chewy inside and not too crispy outside. Just sort of changed the glaze since I used a whole egg, beaten. It's a keeper.

Excellent!  These turned out great even though I did something stupid.  I made the dough the night before so that my family wouldn't have to wait that long for them in the morning.  Well I was in such a hurry that I did not  let the dough stand at room temp after taking it out of the fridge.  I knew that this was going to be a problem so I tested one.   It was a brick.  I let the rest of the dough stand and they came out great.  It took as much time as if I had made the dough that morning.  I will do that next time.  The taste and the texture of the bagels were perfect.

This is a wonderful bagel recipe with predictible results you can count on! 
It can be adapted for sweet bagels (Cinnamon/Raisin, Raspberry/Walnut) or savory (Jalapeno/Cheddar, Toasted Onion/Garlic).

Easy and delicious!  As others have done, I made six bagels instead of nine, which turned out to be just the size I wanted.  Will definitely make again!

I have tried several different bagel recipes and they have all but this one left me exhausted and with no time to spare afterwards.  This is a great tasting and expedient recipe.  It helped to start making homemade bagels again. :o) Thank you for posting it!

mix water, salt, sugar, yeast and flour, mix in about 1/2 of the flour and knead rest of flour in by hand (I couldn't believe how much flour that 1 cup of liquid could take.)

turned out great!

Excellent! I made them by hand (activating the yeast in water & sufgar first), and followed the "Forming and baking bagels" article in the advice section after making the dough. They came out soft and chewy, with slightly tough crust, and weren't as ugly as I thought they would be =) Definitely New York style. Topped with chopped garlic lightly fried in olive oil, and salt. Used brown sugar in the water rather than white sugar. Yay!

Oh my goodness!  These are so good!  Just like bought bagels and even better.  Nothing but the good stuff you add yourself.  My Husband loves them,and said they are better then store bought.  We will never buy begals in the store again.  Thank you! this is great, and so much more healthier for us.
I followed the recipe and used my bread maker to complete the dough process, took 2 hours.

The preparation on these was very easy, the only problem is that we weren't sure if the dough should go through any rising in the bread machine (our machine does 2 rise cycles).  We let it go for 1 and then took out and made the bagels according to directions.  They came out just like bread, but that is due to the rising in the machine.  Next time we will only mix the dough, no rising, or just do it by hand.  I am definately looking forward to trying this again, with better results.  One last thing, we did boil them a little longer, about 2-3 minutes total, based on looks and other recipes, and that seems to have helped.

These were great just as everyone said, soft inside and krispy out. They taste just like fresh store bought I didn't find them to be anymore time consuming than other breads.

Great recipie! These bagels were a touch sweeter than I expected, but nice: soft and chewy. Very simple to make but a tad on the small size. Also, I'm not sure how long it takes these bagels to lose moisture because my family ate them so quickly!
