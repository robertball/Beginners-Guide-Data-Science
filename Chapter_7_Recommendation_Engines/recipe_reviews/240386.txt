I made this recipe for a birthday sleepover. Everyone loved them...perfect amount of sweetness, without being overbearing. I doubled the recipe and should have plenty of leftovers for tomorrow's breakfast. Very good...don't change a thing!

The flavor for these was outstanding and loved by everyone.  I had issues with the cinnamon mixture hardening while waiting on the waffles to cook.  I microwaved it to get it spoon-able, but was not particularly happy with the consistency.  Also, the cream cheese mixture was not thin enough to drizzle and I had to add milk to get it to a drizzling consistency.  We also had quite of bit of both the cinnamon mixture and the cream cheese mixture leftover after having generously spooned it over all six of the bigger sized waffles we got from the batter.  Overall, a nice treat for a special breakfast.  We served our with bacon.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe gave us a great out-to-eat bruch experience without the corresponding premium price.  We had a good bit of cinnamon sauce and cream cheese spread remaining after we consumed the waffles, and I didn't think we were skimpy with our usage - plan accordingly.  Delicious!

This is a GREAT recipe! I made a few modifications. I substituted melted butter for a little bit of light tasting olive oil. I skipped the cinnamon topping and used a different icing:

1 1/2 cups Confectioners' sugar
1 2/3 Tbsp milk
1/2 tsp Vanilla

We didn't have cream cheese in the house, so I used the icing above. I topped it with fresh whipped cream:

1 cup Heavy Whipping Cream
1 Tsp Vanilla
2 Tbsp sugar
1/4 Tsp Almond Ex.

I  will definitely make it again!

These waffles were just too sweet for my family.  The waffle part was tasty and I may make them again but not the cinnamon spread or cream cheese icing.  My guys like peanut butter spread on their warm waffle/pancake and the good old syrup.

I doubled the waffle batter but not the toppings and still had plenty left over topping - it is very sweet and the cinnamon topping hardens as you cook the waffles, but thins out if you heat in microwave for 20 seconds.  Can use the leftover cream cheese topping for a pumpkin spice muffin or zucchini bread.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for. The waffle part turned out fine--good for picky eaters as it didn't have much flavor so it is a nice base for plain waffles not from a box mix--but the toppings were just too sickly sweet and sugary. And the cream cheese portion of this recipe was a bit confounding as there was NO liquid called for in it. I really like the idea but it did not work for my family.

My daughter, wife, and I all had them and they were exquisite. But I didn't use butter I swapped it out for coconut oil ( or coconut butter) for it, my daughter and I have a low tolerance for lactose and it tasted out of this world.
