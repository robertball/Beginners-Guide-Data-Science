The taste was great...I didn't think the allspice overpowered at all.  Two aspects that I didn't care for:  the crust on mine was rather thick/tough...more like a bread than a cake; AND even though I put the oats in a food processor to break them down just a bit, they DID seem to be a bit much in the texture department.

I would make this again but leave out the oats.

(and FYI, a cup of banana equals two bananas)

Excellent, forgiving recipe. I was halfway through making this when I discovered that the two big bananas I had the day before had mysteriously become just one. Not wanting to have to go to the grocery store, I used 1/2 cup pureed, cooked sweet potato in place of the other banana. The cake came out FABULOUS, with a mere hint of banana taste, making this perfect for those who think they don't like banana cake. I added 1 tsp cinnamon, because it complements the flavor of banana anything. I used dark brown sugar, as well, since that was all I had.  In a 10-cup bundt pan, it took 50 minutes to bake completely. I glazed it with a cream cheese glaze (1 Tb softened butter, 4 oz softened cream cheese, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 Tb milk.) It came out tremendously moist, and received rave reviews. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I'm so glad I found this recipe. This recipe helped my terminally ill cancer friend going thru chemo. Everything tasted like chemicals EXCEPT she would eat a piece of this and then she was able to eat her other food. Feeding tube was then removed!!! Thanks!

We were looking for an alternative to banana bread.  I came across this site the other day, made the cake and it was great!  Very moist.

The best banana cake I have ever had. More like a loaf cake than a traditional cake. I made it in a bundt pan and frosted it with a vanila glaze. AMAZING!!!!! Made it yesterday and it's gone today! Can't wait for more banana's to ripen!

This is an awesome cake. I made it with the allspice cream cheese frosting and it was yummy. Had a TON of frosting left over. The only thing I did different was bake it in a 9x13 pan (easier to take to a church potluck). Still followed baking time as directed and it was perfect. I made another banana cake from this site and it wasnt what I was looking for (wanted a little spice to it). This is the one! It's a keeper. Thanks!

I made this and followed the recipe exactly. I baked it in a bundt pan for about 35 minutes, and it came out beautifully. I liked the flavor very much, but not sure I loved the oatmeal in it, as it added a "chew" I wasn't crazy about.  I am a big fan of oatmeal in cookies, etc. but it didn't work in this, as far as I was concerned.

I didn't like the texture of this cake. It wasn't fluffy like cake. It was rather dense. I didn't care for the oats in a cake but if this were a bread it would be fine. I used the amount of spices called for and still found the cake bland. I topped it with Cream Cheese Frosting II found on this website, and with sliced fresh strawberries on top it was good when not considering the heaviness of the cake. I won't make this cake again.

This cake is very moist and flavorful. I thought the allspice might be overpowering, as other reviewers had mentioned, so I used only 1/2 tsp. I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I baked this in a bundt pan for about 50 minutes and rather than frosting it, I sprinkled the cake with confectors sugars after it was cooled. A great way to use up over ripe bananas.

Delicious!  I did change the spices a little since our family likes cinnamon.  I also added a cup of real chocolate chips.  The oatmeal was a must for the texture.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was the absolute best best cake I've ever made.  Everyday bakers will have EVERY ingredient in If you are using a bundt cake pan you will need to bake cake for 55 minutes (at least).

This was delicious!  Very moist and flavorful... and I loved the chewy texture of the oats in the cake.  My family doesn't like a lot of frosting, so I glazed it with a Vanilla Glaze, which was just right!

This cake was very good. Lots of flavor...spicier than traditional banana cake recipes. The allspice does it! I did frost it with the allspice cream cheese frosting recipe here on allrecipes.com. Big hit and it keeps for days....still moist and tasty!

I really liked this banana cake recipe. It made a lovely moist cake with a bit of oat chewiness that I found appealing, besides being good for you. I did make a couple of substitutions. The spice I chose to use was Vietnamese cinnamon which is very intense. I also used Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream because that was what I had. The cake turned out perfectly!  Thanks for such a good and successful recipe!

Tasted good, but didn't rise.  I tried to make cupcake/muffins but the middle's collapsed on all of them.  Took the remaining batter and placed in a loaf pan and the middle was sunk on that as well.  Good flavor, but appearance was lacking.  I followed recipe exactly as written so not sure what happened.

This would be better as a muffin.  It needs the cream cheese frosting as it is quite dry.  I used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and allspice and nutmeg each.  This recipe needs to be improved for me to make again.

This is why God made bananas!!! A delicious Banana cake, especially with the allspice cream cheese icing.  Followed recipe to a 'T' and it came out perfect.  Next time I think I may add some golden raisins.

The cake itself had nice flavor, but I think I may have added too much banana because they were too mushy/soft for my taste.   The frosting was really good with them, though.  I made them as cupcakes.  Don't know if I would waste the time and ingredients to make this again.

This was a really great cake.  I made it at Thanksgiving alongside the pumpkin pie and everyone had some of each!  I used the allspice cream cheese frosting, and it was good too.   The only thing I would change is to use only about 3 cups of icing sugar in the icing, I found it a bit too sweet and I would have prefered a creamier frosting.  Will make again!

This was so delicious. The texture of this cake is a winner.

The only changes I made: I used 1/2c white sugar, 1/2c brown sugar (due to having 3 VERY ripe/sweet bananas). And instead of the 1 1/4 tsp allspice, I used 1tsp allspice & 1/4tsp cinnamon. 

 I mixed in the bananas, eggs, and sour cream into the wet mixture before adding it all to the dry mixture. Worked great. Was made in my bundt pan and added in chia seeds for a bit of some omega's.

The cake was wonderful to use up some very ripe bananas.  I used two bananas to make the cup.  I frosted the cake with a coffee buttercream frosting that was just perfect.  The cake is not overly sweet so it goes well with a rich frosting.

This was a deliciously, banana-y cake.  I made a glaze instead of the cream cheese/butter frosting to save some fat content.  Otherwise, i followed the recipe.  Totally a hit and will use it again when I have an abundance of bananas that need to get used up.

Very good cake!  I was looking for ways to use chinese 5-spice powder in baking, so I used 2 tsp. of powder instead of the allspice and nutmeg. I didn't have any sour cream so I used plain yoghurt.  I will definately make this again, and might even use 3 tsp of the 5 spice powder.

I only used a half cup of each sugar and only 1 tsp. of allspice. Otherwise, I made no changes. Two medium sized loaves took over an hour to bake, covered halfway with foil. Even then, they were really dark. It smells amazing. This is a gift, so I have no idea how they taste. I'll update my review after I hear back how it went over.

The allspice REALLY overwhelmed the banana flavor in this cake. The Oats gave an odd texture for a cake- it didn't rise very well. It would have been a better texture for a muffin rather than a cake

Excellent cake, the banana flavor is mild but present against the spices.  I used two bananas, probably less than a cup, and just tossed them in one at a time instead of mashing beforehand, yogurt instead of sour cream, and omitted the oats (can't find either in my part of Japan!); it was very moist and delicious.  I coated it with the Vanilla Glaze by Jamie Langston because I am not a fan of cream cheese frosting and it goes together well.

I wasn't so impressed..., Not a bad recipe, but I think I'll save my overripe bananas for a banana bread or the Banana Crumb Muffins on this site which are fabulous.

i loved this cake recipe! i'm not a huge fan of cake but this was fantastic! i think i like it because it has a slightly different texture than cake, more like a banana bread. I topped it with Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting and it paired with it beautifully! Will definately make this again :)

says it makes a 9 inch cake but directions are for 2 9 inch cakes. I used one 9 inch pan and baked for 30 minutes. Took it out and toothpick came out clean but it was NOT cooked in the middle and the centre fell. Besides that really good flavour (I added a handful of chocolate chips and walnuts.) I thought the mixing process would be over mixing so I added the sour cream and banana to the wet mix and then added the wet and dry ingredients together. Will definitely make again but bake longer.

Delicious and flavorful with great texture with the oats.  I thought the allspice would be overpower and it was just perfect. I actually had a tough time removing the cakes from their pans(cakes stuck to the pans in the middle) so I ended up with huge chunks of cake that could not be reassembled and frosted..I'm not that skilled.  HOWEVER, after my husband and I tasted the cake we knew it had to be saved.  We used a little creativity and decided to turn this ino a trifle.  So, for dessert that night we brought out individual bowls and I put chunks of the cake in bowls, heated up store bought buttercream frosting in the microwave to drizzing consistancy and drizzled over the cake crumbles/chunks in the bowl.  Everyone at dinner, unsuspecting company included, LOVED the flavors and they didn't even know it was supposed to be an assembled and iced 2 layer cake.  The cake is so delicious, I will be making this again.  I will definitely attempt the allspice cream cheese frosting also!!!

WOW! This was such a good cake! Very moist and flavorful. Made this for my husbands birthday and he loved it. Only thing is, I won't use the allspice frosting as noted, it was way too sweet and overpowered the cake. This would be good with just whipped cream, because the cake is really sweet and flavorful.

This was really good.  I usually make banana cake IV from this site, which I think is more or less the same with the exception of the spices and oatmeal.  I will make this again.

After reading the reviews I decided to omit the oatmeal . Other than that I followed the recipe and frosted it with the allspice cream cheese frosting as suggested and my family loved it. The cake was absolutely delicious and a good way to use up very ripened bananas and my family loved it !

Way easier then making chocolate Cake from Scratch. Less Flavor then Just plain Banana Cake. But a definite crowd pleaser. For my Husband coworkers. Especially if you pair it with a Vanilla Buttercream Frosting. (If I may suggest.) please bake and enjoy.

This cake was a real flop. It sank in the middle. Two nine -inch pans aren’t a good choice for this cake as directed. It was a very short, flat, sad little cake. Tasted ok. Needs more spices. Will not make again. And, I’m a pretty good cake maker. Followed the directions exactly as written. This is the first recipe from this site that wasn’t a big hit. I’ve loved the others I’ve tried from here. Very surprised.

This makes a delicious, moist cake. I can't speak to whether or not it keeps well because my dog ate the entire thing after my guest and I had just two slices. For what it's worth, his bowels were fine! (Sorry tmi!)

super super fantastic. Made it the way it was written. I was fist concerned by some of the reviews about flavor but this cake pops with flavor and I was expecting it to be more dense from the comments that were made but its not. I will make it again and next time I will probably add some walnuts and carrots. The frosting with the spice in it was fantastic. Love this cake.

I just made this last night to bring to work today for a food day. I just had a piece and it was so good. I didn't have any allspice so I used pumpkin pie spice instead and frosted it with buttercream frosting it was wonderful. Just a hint of spice along with the banana. This is a very moist cake. I will be making this cake again.

I never thought I'd be giving a banana cake a five star rating... But, man - this is phenomenal.  So super moist inside, and the outer edges got a bit crusty, so I was really diggin' that! (Watch your bake times though - I pulled mine 8 minutes early) The oats are completely necessary in this cake so do not skip them!!! *I have no idea what the bananas measured out to - I just used three medium sized ones*

This cake is SO GOOD. SO GOOD!!!
I did make some substitutions. I used margarine (Becel) instead of butter, nixed the oats for an equal amount of flour (used 2 cups a.p.flour). I also added the egg yolks in first and blended them into the mix and then whipped the whites with a bit of white sugar until frothy and added them in afterwards. I always do this with my cakes as it makes them more airy and less dense.
For frosting, I used a mixture of Jello Instant Vanilla pudding made with 1 cup of skim milk (usually you use 2 cups to make pudding) I also added in some light whipped cream (from a can) I had on hand. I don't know how much whipped cream I added, I just did it bit by bit until I got the right consistency. I put it in the fridge for about 2 hours to thicken up before I iced the cakes.

Very good!!

This cake was very flavorful but I didn't care for the texture.  The oats (I used quick 1-minute) made it rather chewy.  I also increased the recipe by 50% and it was the perfect amount for 9" pans. I will try this one again but instead of oats, I'll increase the flour and I think chopped walnuts would be a great addition, too.

I think the spices (especially the allspice) and the banana do not work well together.  Although I realize this may be a matter of personal preference, I thought the allspice was unpleasantly overwhelming.
