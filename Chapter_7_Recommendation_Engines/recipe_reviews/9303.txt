One very important detail that is not spelled out in this recipe and I learned the hard way.  After you bake the cake part of it, let it cool a minute or two while still in the pan.  Loosen edges and then turn pan upside down over your powder-sugared towels.  When you roll it up, ROLL THE TOWEL IN WITH IT.  This is where my problem was.  I have never made a jelly roll or roll-up dessert and didn't know.  Also the cake was too warm and it fell apart.  I'll know better next time!

Here's a hint...place wax paper on the bottom of the cookie sheet before you bake it and just flip it onto to towel, roll and cool.  The wax paper prevents "rips" or "tears" in the cake and makes the cake much easier to work with.  I also used pumpkin all spice instead of ginger and it does seem to add a little more taste.

This is the exact recipe I've been making for years and it is FANTASTIC! You can also add 1 tsp. nutmeg if you like to batter. The only difference in my recipe is you fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture just untill blended, don't overmix, and the baking time is 375 for 15 min. I bake in a 15x10x1 in.sheet. Can use walnuts instead of pecans. Do not panic if cake cracks when you unroll to fill(don't roll too tight) this is common. Just lightly press together and sprinkle with lots of confectioners sugar and no one will notice! Everyone raves over this! You must try! Oh I forgot, this freezes well too! Thanks Tammy!

I have been using this recipe for years.  It is great.  I make over 100 to give as gifts at Christmas!  My husbands board of directors can't wait for them each year.  I start in November and freeze them.

Always impresses the guests.  BTW, you can freeze leftovers (as if there may be some!).  Love the hint about baking the cake on foil and rolling it up.  So much easier than the dishtowel method I fought with for years.  Eliminates a lot of mess.  Thanks!

I make this every yr around fall. Though I will give a little helpful tip. I line my pan with waxed paper before putting in the batter. It makes it alot easier to get it out of the pan, also easier to roll it. I have found that using a towel can be messy & likes to stick. If you waxed paper, before u roll it up, just loosen the paper from the cake edge first =)

I just made a "practice" pumpkin roll. It came out fantastic! I did use wax paper to line the pan. When it was done, I used a knife along the edges to loosen the cake from the wax paper. I carried the cake with the wax paper attached to the counter. Holding onto the wax paper extending from the sides, I slowly rolled it up. The cream cheese filling was easy to make. After the cake cooled, it was easy to unroll (with the wax paper still attached)..I spread the filling then rolled it back up, peeling the wax paper off as I went. Hubby asked why it doesn't break and I think it's the texture of the cake that helps. It has a denser texture than a traditional layer cake.That, in addition to rolling it while it's warm is the key.  I've been thinking of making one of these since Junior High Home Ec class where the first one I saw was made by Mrs. Griffith. So, if you have been thinking of tackling making a cake roll, I highly recommend this recipe. It's a great place to start! (and very delicious, too!)

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!! I made this the night before Thanksgiving to take to the in-laws.  However, since I am not a very good cook, I ended up forgetting to add the ginger to the cake batter.  I did use it in the cream cheese batter and still turned out fine.  I also didn't realize the cake could fit on one dishtowel and I broke it in a couple of spots trying to get it on one towel to roll it easier.  Received rave reviews at the in-laws...I even took the leftovers form myself.  Totally Awesome- just the right rich taste and texture.

This is my boyfriend's favorite childhood dessert.  I found the recipe on this site and have been making it for him ever since.  It is always delicious!  We've done it with and without the nuts, and it is better with.  Thank you!

Big hit with my family at Thanksgiving.  They were very impressed with how it looked, as well as how it tasted!  The cake did crack in a few spots when I rolled it, but it wasn't very noticeable, and it certainly didn't affect the taste.  I did omit the nuts, just because my husband doesn't care for them, but I'm sure it would be great with them as well.

This is absolutley the best Pumpkin Roll I have ever made. I have been making other recipes for years and thought I would try a new recipe and I am glad I did. The ginger gave it an extra kick. This is a great recipe. I let my cool about 5 more minutes before I unrolled it. I will be making more of these. Does anyone know if you can freeze these?

I've been making this recipe a few years now and it will be continued to be made for years and then passed generation to generation!  It is the best pumpkin roll ever!  

I do not mess with sugaring towels though.  I just sprinkle confectioners sugar on waxed paper, turn out the roll, let it cool, frost it, and then as I roll it up sprinkle some powdered sugar as I go.  When I used the towels, I thought it was really sweet with sugar.

Awesome, awesome, awesome, is all I have to say though!

I have been making this recipe for many many years, and have learned a few tricks that make it even easier- put waxed paper down on your cookie sheet and spray with pam before putting batter on it to bake. be sure to loosen edges after letting cool for a few minutes before rolling. Lastly, I always roll my finished pumpkin roll up in waxed paper and freeze it until I am ready to serve. It will last for up to a month in freezer when properly packaged. (After it is cut, it thaws rather quickly) It is much much easier to cut the roll after it has been frozen (I use a bread knife) Hope this is helpful!

This is almost the exact recipe I've been using for years, minus the pecans and ginger.
I'm sure this has been mentioned, but placing wax paper in the pan before adding the batter really helps your pumpkin roll come out nice and easy.
Another tip is rolling it lengthwise to make more slices if you have alot of guests! :)

THis was absolutely a favorite in my house. I used pumpkin pie spice in place of the individual spices and I used real vanilla in the filling. I froze one but it didn't stay in the freezer for long. I plan on making a few to share during the holidays!

This recipe was so easy and made me look like the best baker in town! I added a 1/4 tsp of each spice. I made a trial banch and found it lacking some punch. 
And I also discovered that you need to be generous with the powder sugar when rolling the cake. Very taste

This was the first time I tried to make a Pumpkin Roll.  It was wonderful.  The roll may not have been perfect, but the taste was delicious!  I will definitely be adding this recipe to my collection.

I'm new to holiday baking and tried several different pumpkin roll recipes. This one turned out the best! It was so tasty! The only thing I changed was using pumpkin pie spice instead of ginger as one of the other users suggested. The others seemed a little tasteless and bland, but not this one! I received many requests for the recipe and for additonal pumpkin rolls!

IT WAS AMAZING!!! So tender and spiced! The frosting was to die for, though I think the butter should be well melted before mixing with the cream cheese. There were small lumps of butter in my filling... Anyway, the roll was still splendid, and a GREAT hit!

Nice recipe. Very tasty.  A regular cookie sheet with shallow sides will work fine -- this cake is very thin before rolling.

This was my first time making pumpkin roll, the cake, the part I was so afraid of turned out great, but the cream cheese filling needed a lot more powdered sugar and I still probably didn't put enough in, it was very soft. All still tasted good though.

I really love this recipe and so does my family. When rolling up the pumpkin roll on the towel be ver generous with the powdered sugar, if not the roll will stick to the towel. If making the roll the night before just wrap up the roll on ceramic wrap and when you are ready for your dessert just take out of refrigerator and sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve.

I've been making this roll for years and it is wonderful.  ChattyKat, thanks for the tip on rolling in the wax paper.  I never thought of that.  I've been using the towel method and it's tricky.

If I could give this 6 stars I would! I made this for the first time this Christmas, and it was a super hit! All I did differently was I didn't use the pecans. I will for sure be making this next year! My advice, if your bringing it to a gathering, make two!

I have used this recipe for years.  The only changes I made was to add some fresh ground ginger...about a teaspoon and a half teaspoon of cloves and a teaspoon of fresh ground nutmeg.  I used parchment (that I sprayed with PAM and lightly floured.  I get rave reviews for this pumpkin roll.  People think it is very difficult to make...I let them think that.

I have always used the powdered sugar on a towel method, and powdered sugar gets all over everything.  So this time I used the wax paper and rolled it up in the wax paper.  Big mistake!  I am annoyed with myself for not realizing that with no towel to absorb the steam, the cake would get soggy.  I had a terrible time getting the cake unrolled, it split on me, and I finally did get it rolled back up but it looks awful. Not sure how it going to taste since it was soggy.  Back to the powdered sugar and towel!

This was such a great recipe! I did however tweek it just abit. I lined my pan with wax paper and sprayed with cooking spray. I used wax paper to roll it up with instead of the towel. This was my first time making a "rolled" desert and it was easy. i am in the process of waiting for it to cool. Can't wait to eat it! :p

Always loved these when somebody would bring them to a church function but never could figure out what they were.   Made one for the first time this past Thanksgiving and it was devoured! Easy to follow and came out perfect on the first try!

I have made this twice now - I made my 1st one a few weeks ago as a trial run for Turkey Day. It was extremely easy, only thing I did differently was I sprayed my jelly pan with cooking spray ( like Pam ) then laid down wax paper, then sprayed a very light layer over the wax paper to ensure the cake came off easily and it did. Pulled right off! Very yummy with walnuts in place of pecans as well! As my hubby said, " This is better than pumpkin pie!"

Many details have been covered in other reviews.  But, one thing I did wrong 3 times was to NOT use the towel.  Instead, I only used the parchment or waxed paper that the cake was baked on.  Every one of my cakes cracked without the towel.  Finally, I did use a towel (keeps the moisture in as the cake cools) and had a perfect cake with no cracking.  I rolled the fourth one with the nuts to the outside and liked it better.  The towel is the key for this recipe.

Double the butter and loose the pecans. I was making p-roll for 4 years b4 I realized I was using twice as much butter as anyone else. Everyone says that mine is the best they have ever had.

This is an OK version of pumpkin roll, but it doesn't have much flavor. It seems much to bland. Overall, it is ok.

This was my first attempt at making a pumpkin roll and it tasted great!  It split a little in a couple of place but still looked good.  I got rave reviews on it at work.  Will definitely make it again.

The recipe seemed genuinely interesting & good when read. The reviews were great. BUT the baking time is all messed up. This needs to be baked for at least 25 mins at that temp.Quite a disapponitment.

I didn't have lemon juice and I didn't use the nuts. Otherwise followed exact. I did line my pan with parchment paper which I would suggest. Baked for exactly 12 minutes and ran a knife around the edges to make sure it would release.  It turned out perfectly and it is beautiful, but there was too much filling. I had to remove quite a bit of it as I rolled because it was coming out the sides and collecting towards the end as I rolled it up. I would like to note this is the first cake roll I have ever made and I was scared to death!!!!! I can't believe how easy it was!!! I did watch a few videos for technique and read a lot of reviews before deciding on this particular recipe.

I  used home grown pumpkin so maybe that was my fault but I could not taste pumpkin.  We enjoyed the cake anyway.

So delicious! I will definitely be making this again. I am not very experienced with cake so I wish I had read the advice in some of the other reviews first: Lay down parchment paper or foil to assist in getting the cake out of the pan for cooling. I had sticking with the dishtowels. Will remember next time!

This as close to my recipe as I have ever seen.  The only difference is I have always made it with chopped walnuts before.  So today I am testing it with pecans instead.  This was the first thing I ever made my mother in law that she would try.  lol  after this we were always trading recipes.

Really delicious! I added a teaspoon or two of quality vodka to give it a gourmet flavor. Adding a teaspoon or two to brownies or chocolate tortes makes a big difference. Thanks.

I have been making this for years from an old church cookbook.   I have all my books packed away so looked this one up on Allrecipes. Made several and froze them for gifts. They all turned out perfect! Lots of compliments and requests for a copy of the recipe!

This recipe is delicious! I would recommend making a double batch. It was very messy rolling the cake and cheesecloth but the results were worth the kitchen cleanup. I put wax paper down before flipping on the counter and also under the cake with a lot of shortening and some flour. A coworker recommended using a lot of powdered sugar and heavy foil on the pan. I left out the nuts for the first attempt since I thought it would be harder to roll.

The first time I made this recipe, I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out very yummy, but the flavors weren't as strong as I like them to be, so the next time I made it, I added a little extra pumpkin, and 1/2 teaspoon extra cinnamon, and it was perfect. Also, fyi, I used my own frozen pureed pumpkin, instead of the canned stuff.

Very easy to make and delicious. I sprayed my jelly roll pan with cooking spray and then put parchment on top. I sprayed that with baking spray, which contains flour. After baking, I turned it over onto a large kitchen towel with lots of confectioners sugar. It did crack a few places but when I rolled it up, you couldn't tell. Smoothing the confectioners sugar all over the top also helped hide the flaws of my first cake roll. As other reviewers suggested, I used maple extract in the filling instead of vanilla. Yum!

I made this gluten free for our Bridge group, two of whom are celiac, and it got rave reviews and recipe requests from everyone. I substituted the regular flour for the same amount of Bobs Red Mill all purpose baking mix (gf) and 1/2 tsp of xanthan gum, and used 3 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices. I crushed the walnuts and added them to the filling which looked very pretty. Definitely a keeper.

This is the most wonderful Pumpkin Roll Every!
Everyone in my family loved it and as we know the real test
is Nana and the Children and it was a big hit.
The only thing I would change for my taste is a little bit of a larger
Jelly pan so the cake part you roll wold be just a bit thinner.
Unless you really, really, really, hate Pumpkin, this will always be a Marvelous Dessert!

Deliscious!  It's critical to use a 9x13 cake pan, and line it with was paper so it will roll out.  No amount of spray and flour will stop mine from sticking to my cookie sheet  :( And I used 2 tsp baking powder as with 1 tsp only, it doesn't raise enough. Tricky to roll without it cracking, but worth the effort if you can do it!    If not, use plan b, and cut into obling strips and make a layer cake out of it.

Fantastic recipe. I used parchment paper instead of tea towels and it turned out fine, very minimal cracks. The frosting really made this. I added a bit of extra vanilla extract and sprinkled cinnamon on top after it was rolled. Would recommend!

It was not lacking in flavor or sweetness! I'm a roll baking novice and this recipe was very easy, straight-forward, and yummy.  I doubled the amount of filling however, it just seemed to sparse.

I tried this yesterday. First time ever making a pumpkin roll. I found that wrapping it in wax paper instead of a towel makes it sweat and nasty. Will use a towel next time. I used parchment paper to line my pan and the cake flipped right off. I LOVE parchment paper. Also, I used Splenda instead of real sugar. Maybe that was the problem. Or, maybe my baking powder is too old. I don't know, but it turned out terrible.  But, I am going to get new baking powder and use real sugar and a towel next time. I love pumpkin rolls, just not mine. I hate to even give this a rating since I think it was all my own fault it didn't turn out right.

I really love this on so much!!! I use a wax paper lay over the cookies sheet. It's so easy to come off. I have some idea, you can separate some of the battle, put the food color in it and make a zebra or any pattern you want on your roll, put it in the oven let it set for 4 minutes then pour the normal battle on it and follow the normal recipe ;D

I cooked two of these for a "Holiday Treat Week" I did at work this past week. This recipe was my..Big Finale!.. and I'm glad I waited until Friday. This recipe was absolutely spot on and delicious. I might also say it was my first time to try this particular dessert but most people would have never been able to tell given the direction and accuracy of the recipe. 

Definitely worth the time, energy, and resources!

A little hard to follow instructions if you have never made a log before. Had trouble with how to roll it. My spiral wasn't perfect, but it did taste the same. Just not real pretty. Next time I will change how I rolled it.

1st time making a pumpkin roll and I must say this recipe was delicious.  I did take a tip from other reviewers and baked on wax paper and flipped out on powder sugar dusted wax paper which worked well.  Thanks Tammy!

Hey, does anybody know a high altitude fix? I'm above 6000 feet, the roll is still good, but the texture is off. Made it a lot in Oregon, it's delicious, my boyfriend asks for it all the time.

It's the first time I made it and it tasted better than it looked. I had a hard time with it. My batter was too thin and didn't fill the cookie/ jelly sheet. Next time I won't add the pecans to the batter cake batter, but maybe to the frosting, finely chopped.  The frosting was runny. When the cake part was done, it seemed too thin and I had a hard time rolling it without it cracking when the frosting was in it because it was too thin in places. I froze it over night. It wasn't very pretty, so thank goodness for confectioner's sugar! People complimented it at the party, but it was hard to cut, even with a serrated knife. I chalk it up to being a beginner at making roll cakes. Maybe next time, I will make it in a smaller jelly roll pan, and add more confectioners sugar to the frosting while mixing to make it thicker and creamier.

This made a huge impression on my in-laws. My wife's cousin was actually mad because mine turned out so much better than her's. I am making 2 of them this year.

This is a staple around our house this time of year.  I usually have to double the recipe and make one for friends or sometimes we eat them.
