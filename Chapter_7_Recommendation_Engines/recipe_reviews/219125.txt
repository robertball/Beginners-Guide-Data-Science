Excellent! The flavors are wonderful in this recipe. I'm always looking for new ways to use chicken breasts and this did not disappoint. I used one whole bag of baby carrots instead of one carrot that the recipe called for, omitted the white wine since I didn't have any and used Herbes de Provence from a jar (about a teaspoon) instead of the fresh herbs. I put the flour directly into the stew (instead of mixing with water first) and it came out perfect.  I served this over whole grain Texmati rice.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was okay.  As stated in the description it does have a light, fresh taste.  Not overly flavorful and I was looking for more of bang.

Loved this! Yes, it mild tasting but that's part of what makes it great. It's a nice, hearty, warming stew great to dip bread in! Definitely recommend it, I made it as written except I forgot to put the spring onions in and didn't have a leek and just sprinkled Italian Seasoning in since I didn't have the fresh herbs. Will make again!

Fantastic! The boys all loved it. Very flavorful and comforting.  I did put a small lump of arborio rice in the bowl first instead of thickening.

In general it was okay, but it seemed really bland.   I added some bouillon cubes and doubled the garlic, but still seemed sort of plain.

Very good. I also noticed that, while it was subtly very tasty, it did benefit from a few tweaks. I saut√©ed the mushrooms before adding. I served with carrots and parsnips in the stew. I added thickly sliced fingerling potatoes to simmer and poured in about a 1/4 c of sherry at the end before thickening. I saved half and will add tomatoes and okra for a totally different taste later in the week.

delicious! I need to improve my bouquet skills or get an infuser for the herbs.
