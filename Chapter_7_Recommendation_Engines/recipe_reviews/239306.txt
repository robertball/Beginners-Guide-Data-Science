Fantastic caramel!  The caramels have a very soft, smooth texture and the flavor is excellent! I made the recipe exactly as written and it came out perfect!

Very, very good.  The night before making this I had an orange for a late night snack. Since it was the last  orange in-house,  I added about a tablespoon of orange juice. Don't think it changed or added to the flavor. Will definitely make again. Thank you!
