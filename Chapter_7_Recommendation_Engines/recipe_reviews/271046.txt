Delicious as the recipe is written. Cook the spaghetti squash in the oven just till it shreds about 40 minutes for the one I had.

As written it tastes great and is a good weeknight meal. Can be made ahead and reheated for a quick supper.

I did remake it with fresh garden vegetables as I didn't want to waste them. I used some New Mexico and Jalapeno chilis and also some Mushrooms i had bought. It was really outstanding. 

But the recipe as it is on here is great. Give it a try. It makes a great presentation as well.

Changed it to ground beef. Not crazy about ground turkey. It was still within my carb points for the meal. Will make it again.

I used Rotel can tomatoes make it a little spicy. I was kinda bland so added BBQ . To get my daughter(7) to eat we used ketchup. she actually said it was good without. Trying to learn to cook heathier and teach her as well.

This is definitely going to be a revolving  favorite for my family! I didn't make any changes to the recipe except doubled the basil, just because we love it so much and everyone loved it!

This was a very easy and tasty dish. I would cut back on the amount of filling items by 1/4, as we had plenty leftover. It did make a nice snack!
