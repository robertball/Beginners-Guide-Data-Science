This is my recipe, and I heat the milk in the microwave until it's just about to boil, then all all ingredients to the yogurt maker and stir thoroughly. I then set the yogurt maker for 4 hours. Once the 4 hours is up, I always end up with loads of whey, which, if left in the yogurt, will make the yogurt stringy if you just mix it all in. I always strain the yogurt through a coffee filter to remove the whey, then pour into a bowl, cover and refrigerate over night. I always end up with really thick, creamy yogurt that is delicious. You can leave the yogurt for longer than 4 hours - up to 12 hours (4 is the minimum though)but I have never noticed a difference in taste for leaving it longer. Therefore to save time (and electricity!) I generally only leave my yogurt maker on for 4 hours.

This is a great recipe.  I have made it mixing 2% milk with either skim or 1% and it comes out just as well.  It is not a thick yogurt but very good nonetheless.  (I don't straign the whey - more nutrients)

I didn't like the flavor of this. The texture was fine, but I expected more banana flavor, but it tasted to me like plain yogurt with a too heavy taste of vanilla and not much banana. I think a tinge more sweetness would really help.

I didn't use a yogurt maker, so mine took almost 48 hours to achieve the thick texture I wanted, like Greek yogurt.  I didn't add the vanilla or banana until the yogurt had completely drained, I can flavor the rest with berries or honey or just add it to a smoothie.  Great recipe, thank you Sunflower!
