This salad is real good, and the chicken tastes great! The ingredients for the marinade sound wierd, but they taste real good together.

I brought this salad to a party, and it was a big hit.  It was really easy to make ahead of time-- I grilled the chicken at the last minute.  Will definately make it again!!

My girlfriend and I made this salad recently on a whim.  The ingredients are cheap and the salad was quickly and easily constructed.  We substituted cheddar cheese that we had on hand for the swiss with no problem.  Olive oil also worked as a stand-in for the vegetable oil.  Definitely a keeper salad recipe!

I was excited to try this recipe because of all the rave reviews, but I ended up being very disappointed. The salad dressing was way too tangy and sour. And the chicken was nothing special. Not worth the effort. Won't make again.

this was okay.  I really don't understand marinating something in carbonation as opposed to just adding some lime juice.

So good, and so easy to make.  The chicken turned out a little dry, but definately a keeper.  Nice summertime main course.

We modified this recipe a bit but still found it very tasty.  We cut the chicken into chunks and stir-fried them which really brought out the flavor but my wife thinks that the strips would work better.  The salad itself was a mix of spinach and romaine.  Overall the presentation was very lovely and the meal tasted fantastic.

Excellent recipe, especially nice in summer.  I usually double the mozzarella and skip the Parmesan.

This was pretty good, but the marinade wasn't as strong as we'd have liked it. Perhaps I needed to marinade longer, or use a flat grill to cook it... but it was light, fresh, and tasty still!   =)

I thought the dressing was delish.  I had to use four tbsps of "fake" lemon juice instead of fresh and used olive oil intead of veg oil (just my preference).   Turned out great.  I thought the chicken was just okay.  I probably would have just added some lime juice intead using the soda. Overall, though, a great, healthy salad.  Next time I will add some avocados.

This was very good!!!  I usually follow the recipes exactly the first time but I made my own variations the first time around.  I added some Balsamic Vinegar to the dressing and also added some red onion and fresh garlic to the salad...it was very tasty!  My boyfriend loved it and he is a meat and potatoes man!

Delicious! Used one large head of romaine lettuce instead of two (enough to fill one large mixing bowl), otherwise I followed directions exactly. I only had time to marinate the meat for three hours, next time I will be marinating overnite for more flavor. Great served with Lasagna! Everyone loved it!

This recipe had a wonderful tangy taste.  The chicken was delicious.  A definite must-have summer recipe.

Very nice dinner salad.  I didn't use the lemon-lime soda, instead I used some liquid margarita mix and a squeeze of lemon - turned out fine.  We enjoyed the salad with crusty rolls and a glass of white wine.

the marinate makes the chicken so tender and delicious!  The dressing adds a wonderful flavor to the salad.

We loved this salad!  I think I used a small lemon because the dressing didn't have much flavor, but it still worked because there were so many strong flavors with the marinated chicken and the combination of cheeses that a subtle dressing was just perfect.  The chicken also turned out very moist and tasted great on the salad after being just off the grill for a few minutes.  My husband called it a "keeper" and we will be making this again soon.

It doesn't stand out to me, but it does taste very good.  I might suggest adding sesame seeds or crutons for texture.

Nice summer meal. I didn't have soda, so used lime juice and halved the marinade for just two breast, chicken was nice and tender. For the dressing I used olive oil and only 1/2 cup and lime instead of lemon. Added some black olives. Served with some garlic bread.

This looked good as written but tasted terrible. I had to do several enhancements to make it edible. Won't be making again!
