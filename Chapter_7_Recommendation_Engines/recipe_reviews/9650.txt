I was craving chocolate late one night, came on allrecipes.com and found this recipe. 25 minutes later I had brownies. But, I didn't have shortening, so I used oil. The oil was drenching them and driping down my fingers, so that wasn't a good choice! But I made them again today with butter instead of shortening, and used 1/4 c less butter than it called for (shortening), and doubled the recipe because last time they were very thin. These were excellent!!! They would be good with nuts. Maybe even chocolate chips because they are not very chocolatey. But so simple and they really did have a great flavor. Just don't use oil and use less butter/shortening than the recipe calls for.

If I could have given this recipe a zero star I would have. I really should have read the reviews before I made this. It is disgusting. These "brownies" are most like "whities" because of the color. There is too much shortening to flour and chocolate ratio. They taste awful.

When I think brownies, I think fudgey.  These were anything but.  They satisfied my sweet tooth, but left me yearning for chocolate...

This recipe is easy to make. I used butter instead of shortening and used less like someone recommended in previous reviews. However, they came out very wierd looking, they are very pale and moist, and have no flavor. I don't recommend this recipe.

Not exactly sure how to rate these... 5 for being easy to throw together. I used butter for the shortening, added some chopped walnuts, a teaspoon of coffee crystals, and a dash of salt. Baked an extra 10 min. in an 8x8 pan. Think they need more cocoa because they look a little light. Didn't wait for them to cool but they were pretty good warm with a glass of milk, crispy on the top but a bit gummy inside. Not your classic brownie flavor but I'd probably make them again in a 9x9 pan. Hubby said that he'd like them more well done.

I was looking for any easy recipe.  It might have been easy, but they were terrible.  The grease literally was coming out of the brownies.  They had no taste, and since I made a triple batch all of them ended up in the garbage.

My whole family loved these, they think they are the best ever! We used butter instead of shortening and Kalua instead of Vanilla. I think that made a difference.

We all really liked the recipe!  It was not too sweet or rich, which is just what we wanted.  I did substitute the shortening for margarine and doubled the cocoa, based on other reviews.  I cooked it an extra 10 minutes.  Added some chocolate chips on top after about 15 minutes of cook time.

This recipe was easy. But the brownies weren't very satisfying.  I ate one but wasn't sure I cared for it.  Tried a second one & didn't care for it.  My husband & 3 year old didn't care for the taste either.

These were awful. I read the recipe & thought to myself 3 Tbsp of cocoa just doesn't even sound like enough- I was right. I changed it to 1/4 cup cocoa, thinking I didn't want to overdo it, but something just told me...well I should have listened to that little voice that told me the cocoa was off because even after adding cocoa to the recipe they were just not right. My 5 year old wouldn't touch them even after I put chocolate frosting on them to try to save them. These, as somone else put were more "tanies" in color than brownies. Too much of everything else & certainly not near enough cocoa. They were flavorless. They were still warm when they went in the trash & we don't throw away food in this house. They were just that bad.

I had high hopes for these brownies but was definitely disappointed in the end. I have never had a brownie that tasted that bland! I couldn't taste the chocolate at all. It had great texture, etc. but taste was not there. I will keep looking for a better brownie recipe.

When I baked this I found that the outer edge got really hard and almost burnt, so I took it out, then the middle was almost like a really hot pudding. It tasted good but I would have liked it to have been a real brownie. We ended up taking a piece of brownie from the edge and pouring the hot chocolate pudding on it, it tasted marvelous, but not what it was meant to be.

It was some of the best Brownies I have had! I did what another lady said about useing 1/4 less shortening then what the recipe calls for,also i used butter in stead of shortening. We also put pecans in the mix and that's what really made it awesome.

I did not care for this recipe. A friend and I made these late at night out of boredom, and they tasted terrible. As recommended by some of the other reviews, we used less shortening and more cocoa and sugar to try and flavor them better. They still resulted in tasting like vaguely chocolate-y butter and looked like meatloaf. Very gross and inedible. They also needed an extra ten minutes to cook, they came out of the oven at 20 minutes still liquid. DO NOT MAKE THESE.

Very yummy once I made some changes.  I used margerine instead of shortening and less of it.  I also added chocolate chips to the margerine/coco powder mix and melted the whole thing.  They came out more chocolaty this way.

I rarely bother to comment on a recipe that I have to rate under 4 but do feel that there are errors in this one.  The amount of shortening does not balance.  Definitely very easy to make but not like any brownie I have ever tried (and that is many).  Do carefully check your recipe.

Yum! I increased the cocoa by half a teaspoon and the cook time by about 10 minutes.  I also added about a handful of chocolate chips and the same amount of walnuts.

These were DEFINITELY not ready after 20 minutes, and I made the mistake of not checking them.  I got a small taste of the edge and I don't think they're very good at all!   Now I have to look for another recipe to make this morning :(

I did three things differently:  *Butter instead of shortening *1 1/2 cups of sugar *Baked it in a non-stick mini muffin pan to make "brownie bites"  They turned out great. My family TORE THEM UP and asked for more!

These were great!  I thought that they were simple and quick to make.  Instead of using a double boiler I just melted the shortening in the microwave.  I also used only half the amount called for and replaced the other half with some pumpkin puree.  They cooked for 18 minutes and came out beautiful.  2 thumbs up from my family.  I will for sure make them again!!!

I do agree with the fact that there is to much shortening. I did think they were pretty good though. They should have more chocolate in them  considering they are brownies. Overall the recipe (for the most part) satisfied my sweet tooth.

I think I fixed the problems with this recipe, I baked it first according to the recipe, tried it and I think I fixed it, but I'm in high altitude (6500ft) so it might be different for those at sea level.    2/3 Cup Shortening (minus 2 tablespoons)  1/3 cup cocoa (Hershey's)  3/4 cup sugar  (I added a pinch of salt)  1/2 cup flour  1/2 teaspoon vanilla  2 large eggs  I baked at 350 for 15-20 minutes or until inserted toothpick comes out clean, then let cool for at least 10 minutes.  (If brownies are still too gooey, lower oven temperature to 300 and bake an additional 5 minutes)    These came out very fudgey, rich, and not too sweet.  They do fall apart, but not nearly as bad as the first batch! I sprinkled the tops with powdered sugar!

They didn't even look like brownies. Tan when they were supposed to be chocolate and really greasy from the shortening. After cooking for the specified 20 mins they were sliding around the pan. I didn't even try them.

I didn't like this recipe, the shortening seemed to be too much.  I think half as much shortening replaced by milk would probably do the trick.  If it's anu concellation, the kids and my husband had them gone in less than an hour!  So they must have been good.

For all you fudge lovers I added a half a cup of choclate chips just to make it a bit more coclatier, but if you want more you can always add more.Definatly put less butter!

I loved these. Throw away all your other brownie recipes... these are even easier than a mix, because you probably already have all the ingredients! I make these for every occasion possible.

I've noticed many people have said this recipe isn't so good. So, being an experimenter when I bake, add 6 tbsp of cocoa and if more sugar is needed, add the sugar. If you replace the shortening with butter or margarine, use more chocolate. Add real chocolate if you have some. Semi-sweet chocolate chips works.

I found this recipe one day when I was looking for a good brownie recipe. However, I found, much to my dismay, that these brownies are anything but fudgy. I even tried tripling the cocoa powder, but they were still dissaponting and sadly unchocolaty.

I followed this recipe exactly and did not get brownies but more like Texas Chocolate sheet cake but not as flavorful.  I made homemade icing for sheet cake and put pecans on top so it was still ok but not what I was looking for.

I used butter for shortening, half/half brown and white sugar and added some chocolate chips to give a bit more flavour. My rating takes into account how quick and easy these are. I have had better brownies but these are pretty good and still hit the spot and they were so quick and easy to make so I would reccomend them for a quick fix (using basic ingredients).

I was in a pinch and found this recipe calling for ingredients I had on hand. I should have read the other reviews first, but I was in a hurry. The brownies had a very light color, and the texture was just too sugary for my taste. 

On the other hand, the entire pan of them was eaten at the potluck I took them too.

This recipe could use some changes.  I love the fact that there are few ingredients, but I do not think they make a very good chocolate brownie.  After making the brownies and having my mouth water, I found that I taste flour and lots of sugar(not recommended for children after a certain time).  In the end I was craving these brownies so I did eat them.  I want to try this recipe again, but maybe change up some of the ingredients.  Like instead of shortening use butter and maybe less sugar.

I was looking for an easy brownie recipe because I didn't have any brownie mix. This didn't get the best reviews but I needed somethig easy. Someone said it wasn't fudgy enough so I put  more cocoa in. The brownies came out very pale. The palest browniw I've seen. But very good!
