Nice flavor. Easy. But not what I was expecting. I love the substantial flavor & texture of Greek food, always have. This seemed a bit like an American recipe of Greek pasta salad.

My kids really like this, which surprised me. The reason I didn't give it five stars, apart from my status as a grumpy old man, is that the recipe doesn't say what shape of spinach pasta should be used. I used linguine, and it was clunky looking and harder to eat than had I used penne or mezzo penne. Also, what kind of ricotta should be used? Regular ricotta is nice and creamy, but it makes the salad look like a train wreck! Maybe ricotta salata would be a better choice? You give up creaminess, but may have a nicer looking salad. This was a very tasty dish and it will be made again and again in our house. Other changes I would make are the addition of artichoke hearts, a bit of red onion and maybe a garnish of sliced green onion.
