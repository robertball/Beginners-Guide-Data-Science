Knew as soon as I read recipe that it was for dinner tonight. Best choice I could have made. It was delicious! I has almost all of the ingredients. Had to substitute ham hocks for ox tails & left out sazon seasoning w/annatto because I've never heard of it and didn't have any. Also left out parsnip since I have it.. I think I like this recipe even more than my original.
