This is very delicious. You can make it as described or you can just spread the cream cheese on a serving plate, top with crab (real or surimi imitation) and pour the cocktail sauce over and use sturdy crackers to scoop it up.

I LOVE THIS!!! I made it for a party, my guests could not get enough & asked for the recipe - and at the next party, the hostess made it. It is so simple & yummy - sometimes I grate a little onion for an added kick.

This dip does not stay long on the table. I have also used a variation of it, mix the crab meat ( I use real meat from the can) with the cream cheese, add about a tablespoon of mayo and put in a serving dish, spread the seafood sauce on top.
Very Very tasty!

This came out pretty good. I agree with the previous Ritz cracker comment. I bought a craker called Sociables, and it doesn't have that buttery taste like Ritz that would go so well with this recipe. I am going to buy some Ritz tomorrow! And I think I will dice up some green onions on top to add a little more zip.

As a child, this was one of my favorites. I have found a couple of ways to dress it up a tad. I used Philadelphia Light Garden Veggie cream cheese to add a bit more flavor. I threw in a tablespoon of mayo, a couple dashes of hot sauce and some Parmesan cheese (basically, whatever I had laying around) and served the cocktail sauce extremely lightly on the dip and put some more on the side. It was a hit.

Forget this recipe and choose one using REAL crab meat!
(I tried three others)
They were all better than this one using imitation!
I was humiliated that I served it before trying it first.

This is a great dip! Fast & easy.  I make it at least a dozen times a year for various parties. Everyone always compliments it and asks for the recipe. YUM!

My family has been making this recipe for parties and special occasions for years.  One plate full never lasts long!  The only thing we do differently is that we sprinkle the top of the cocktail sauce with chopped green onions and salad shrimp.  Its always one reason I look forward to the holidays!

This year my (small) family decided to relax for christmas & instead of formal dinner, just put together favorite appatizers & graze all day. This dip was the STAR of the table! I cannot emphasize strongly enough how this simple, 3 ingredient dip  WOWED everyone! I'd give it 6 stars if I could! I used flake-style imitation crab meat, pulled it apart just a bit & gave it a light chop for texture, low fat cream cheese, and McCormick cocktail sauce. DO USE Ritz/butter crackers, they are the perfect match. (Whole Wheat, water crackers, and flatbread crackers do not do the dip justice.)

Great and easy recipe! Only suggestion is add a little horseradish! Great with wheat crackers! Made it on a few different occasions and didn't stay long on the table! YUMMY!

This is a great recipe.  I've also found that instead of mixing everything together, I can make a ball of the cream cheese, spread the crab over it and pour on the cocktail sauce.  It goes very quick at offuce parties and buffets.

I have been making this dip for many years and although it is easy and tasty, it is not visually very appetizing. DO garnish it up to make it 'pretty'. Regardless of it's apperance, it is usually a favorite on the hor dourve table.  A whole jar of cocktail sauce tends to be a bit much. Mix it in a little at a time until you are satisfied with the taste. I have tried all kinds of crab meat and it all works fine. A dollop of horseradish tastes good, too. This is a versatile recipe and for a party you can't go wrong with this dip and some crackers.

i use this recipe all the time.  it's a great fast recipe.  however, i usually  add a little worcestershire sauce and then mix it together with the crab and cream cheese until it's a softer dip.  i like the cocktail sauce on the side.  sometimes it's too overwhelming.

I thought this was pretty good, although my boyfriend felt so/so about it. I modified it a bit- I used a whole pound of imitation krab meat, light cream cheese to lessen up the fat, and I only used 5 ounces of cocktail sauce so it would have such a "ketchupy" taste.

My mom makes a dip like this but adds cream cheese, a tablespoon of prepared horseradish, a few dashes of worcestershire sauce and a couple dashes of garlic sauce mix and chill.  I think these additions make for a more interesting dip.

It was ok, but not that special.  I think the cocktail sauce maybe a little too much.  Went well with the Ritz.

It was pretty good and very simple to make.  I added Franks Red Hot and served with Town House Flips (the cracker on one side and pretzel on the other).  Not sure I would make it again but it went over well.

I must be in the minority in this group. I like that the recipe is literally, very easy to make however, I agree with EMILESVT comment on trying the final product and thinking, hmmm...its Okay. The only difference is thatthe taste hasn't grown on me. I've definitely tasted better.

Excellent.  I used Crab sticks and diced them into the dip.  I also  used fat free cream cheese- which only has 30 calories per serving.  The fat free version is a little sweeter and blends with the refreshing taste of the dip- as well as being healthy.  :)
