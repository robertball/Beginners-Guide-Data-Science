So a JIGGER is 3 TBSP-- I had to look that up.  This is a good starter recipe.  I made quite a few adjustments according to other reviewers.  I used 3 cups of ice cream instead of the ice, skipped the whipped cream, used Cask & Cream instead of Irish Cream, and decided to use Kahlua for the coffee liqueur.  Yummy!

Instead of using ice, I used vanilla ice cream and blew my guests away with how great it tasted.  Even the manly men who would never touch "frou-frou" drinks came back for seconds.  Can be dessert for those who are calorie counting.

I sent this recipe to my mom and she made it over the 4th and they really like it. We had it in Jamaica and wondered if there was a recipe out there that we could duplicate it.

WOWZEEE! This drink was absolutely fantastic! It was a warm evening and our guests thoroughly enjoyed this out on the patio. Don't drink too fast or you'll get a bad case of brain freeze, as another reviewer mentioned. Thanks for this tasty libation, Margaret.

this was so good, but i get a chuckle every time I read a review and it says it is so good but here is what i did, i changed this to that, basically the whole recipe is different, so why give 5 stars on your own version and if yours is so good why are you even looking for a different one you are not even going to make, i dont know makes me laugh

This stuff is dangerous it's so good! I used a bit less ice and added a couple scoops of vanilla ice cream to make it extra decadent. Drizzling the inside of the glass with chocolate sauce is a classy touch indeed. Yum!!

Delicious! We use our ice cream maker and it is like a wonderful desert! Just added the liquor and chocolate sauce, and enough milk and fat free half and half to equal 5 cups and let it run. SO yummy!

Yummy!  My m.i.l, who is not a 'sweet' drinker, loved this.  Very nice as an after-dinner-dessert on a warm evening.  Substituted ice w/Breyer's Vanilla ice-cream and added just a tad bit of ice. So good!

You definitely know that this is an alcoholic beverage, but I think that it's well-balanced with the chocolate flavor.  I used Cool Whip and an extra drizzle of chocolate syrup on top.  I also used mint chocolate Bailey's and vanilla flavored vodka.  Delicious!

Delish! Exactly what I was looking for. I didn't have chocolate syrup so I substituted powdered cocoa and chocolate chips. I also added a few tablespoons of heavy cream.

What a great drink, more like a malted milkshake :)  I added a scoop of ice cream just to make it a little thicker.  Either way it's awesome!  Thanks for posting this one ... one that will be used over and over again!

Great recipe, but I definitely made a few changes on the alcohol pours after substituting the 4 cups of crushed ice for 4 large scoops of vanilla ice cream and 1 cup of crushed ice. use 2oz vodka (about 2shot glasses) and feel free to substitute vanilla vodka. use 1.5oz of coffee liq (Kahlua is my favorite) and 1.5oz of irish cream liq (definitely go with Bailey's). nix the chocolate syrup in the actual drink (add it on top of the whipped cream or drizzle around the glass) and add the ice last so it doesn't melt from the heat of the blender. Add a touch of milk if it's too thick for ya! Tastes JUST like a TGI Friday's Mudslide! YUM!

I love mudslides and I'm not really a drinker.  You can use "Carolines" instead of Kahlua, much cheaper.  I always thought it tasted like there was ice cream in it but have never done that.  I'm not sure this is a necessarily good for the calorie conscience ones, as one reviewer said.  Liquor is empty calories and then with the ice cream?  It's delish but low cal? thinking not.

These are excellent. I have used both whipped cream and ice cream and both are great. If you are in the mood for something richer, use the ice cream. If you feel like something lighter or are watching your calories, whipped cream may be a better choice. I made these for a family member and she said it tasted just like the kind you buy at the resteraunt/bar. Overall, fantastic! Thanks for sharing!

I had the luck to be in Hawaii over 20 years ago with a young romance.  I clearly remember lying by the pool with the ocean at my left and having my boyfriend bring me this "choclate ice-cream drink"...It did't last too long and I ordered them numerous times while there on the beautiful Island of Maui...Upon returning to Minnesota, I would order this drink but NO ONE knew what I was describing - the best was a white russian or black russian or a sexually named drink....After about 5 years I gave up and chalked it up to a great memory never to be re-lived.   So I saw this recipe last week and thought it sounded very close to that old memory and I was not wrong!!  This is fun, refreshing and different and I cannot wait to indulge my mother-in-law !  This is the only liquid that I have in my recipe file!  Forget the calories because this is a drink you just have to taste!

This hit the spot.  We tried it two ways - with lowfat frozen yogurt and then with crushed ice.  Of course the frozen yogurt tasted creamier, but with the ice it is slushier and still a great drink and tasted just like the ones available at the liquor store from their machine.  We did not use the whipped cream with either way.  Thanks for sharing.

a good place to start, but the origonal recipe has too much ice and not enough chocolate syrup. I'd say closer to 3c of ice and the same ammount of chocolate syrup as coffee liqueur.

Delicious.  Better than premade mix.  We used rum cream rather than Irish Cream, as that is all we had on hand.  A little whipped cream and chocolate shavings on top & you have a gorgeous drink.  YUM!  Wish I made more!

These go down way too easy! This is easily one of the best drinks I've ever made. I didn't use the whipped cream because I don't really care for it. I drizzled homemade chocolate syrup on the inside of my glass/ So freaking good! I have a feeling I'm going to be using my blender a lot from now on.

I don't care for icy blended drinks so instead of using ice, I used two big scoops of homemade vanilla frozen yogurt. I also used Smirnoff Whipped Vodka and homemade irish cream. My husband and I split this but honestly, we both wish we hadn't. It really was one of the best milkshakes we've had.

These tasted and looked fantastic!  I dripped the chocolate syrup down the sides of the glasses for visual appeal.  Next time I will add vanilla ice cream for a creamier texture.

This recipe is really good! It is as good as anything that can be ordered at a bar/restaurant. I used vanilla vodka for the vodka and had to sub the coffee liquor for creme de cacao. As it takes a cup of ice per serving, if making this for a party make some ice ahead. Also, make sure to have some plastic straws to drink this through, as it is thick. The only change I might make is to reduce the vodka some next time. I will definitely make this again, TY.

5 Star plus.  Only changes were based on other reviewers.  I used half ice and half vanilla ice cream and also used vanilla vodka.  MMMMMM good!  Spent $55.00 in the liquor store getting the ingredients but it was worth it!

Wish I had read the reviews before I made this drink. I bet Jbundle's suggestion of vanilla vodka is a good one! Doesn't much matter though...I loved this drink just the way it is although next time I will use the vanilla vodka.

I really had a taste for mudslides last night and I had all the ingredients for this recipe already. These were really tasty. I don't like frozen drinks so I just prepared this in a shaker and added a touch of chocolate ice cream. Yummy.

Almost like a chocolate milk shake only better. I like drinks that taste good and this is one of the best tasting alcholic drinks I've had! This has become my favorite drink on hot Summer days. WARNING>>> Don't drink this to fast or you WILL get brain freeze!!!

I made this over the weekend with some company. Personally, I think there way WAY too much ice and the people I served them too agreed. I also doubled the alcohol recipe as my guests said it tasted like "chocolate ice." Next time I'd probably only use 3 cups ice and see if that makes a difference.

Loved It!  It was just like you'd get in a restaurant/bar.  I usually get the T.G.I. Friday's Mudslide already made in the bottle and you just add ice- but this was just as good! (I already had the ingredients for it- so super easy and delicious!)

I made it, I drank it, I drank it, I lapped it out of the glass. Yeah, it was good!  I suck at baking, so I'm glad I found my calling in time for family gathering. Thanks!!

Every other week we have a family dinner with my adult children and whomever they deem to bring along.  I decided to start planning a signature drink for every family meal just to make it fun and use up some of the various bottles we have managed to accumulate in our household.  This is the first cocktail that we have tried that everyone (except my husband who only drinks beer) liked.  My son even told me to put this one in my recipie book lol.   I  followed advice from the other reviewers and used ice cream instead of ice.  Next time I think I will add even more ice cream to make it a little bit thicker.   We will definitely make this one again.

My fiancee and I really enjoyed this. My mom used to make these all of the time. I wasn't sure what a Jigger was so I just used a shot glass. I did 2 shots of each liquor, added a shot of milk at the end to make it more creamy and that was the ticket. I did not use chocolate and whipped cream only because I didn't have any. 

All in all this recipe was excellent other than it could have used some more description for me.

I used chocolate vodka to make this refreshing cocktail.  I wish it was a little creamier, and I would add a little cream next time.

I think it tastes way too much like alcohol. Maybe it's just the brands I chose. Vanilla ice cream instead of ice would definitely make it more tasty.
