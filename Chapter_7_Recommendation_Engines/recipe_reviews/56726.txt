Update: I have made this recipe several times now. Last year I bottled this and gave it away as Xmas presents. I started adding a tablespoon of Brandy to it. It is soooo good! Highly reccommended! Original review: I saw this recipe on the community reviews and just had to try it! It is simmering on the stove and making the house smell so good! So for smell alone, I am rating it 5 stars. Will update about taste. Thanks for the great autumn recipe! Taste update: This was great! I poured this into an afternoon cup of coffee. Wow! A taste sensation! Try this, you won't be disappointed!

This was ok for a homemade syrup.  I didn't think there was enough "gingerbread" flavor in the beginning so I crushed the ginger a little and that help release more flavor.  I left the ginger, cinnamon and cloves in the syrup and put it in a mason jar.  I had to used ground allspice, which was fine.  We used this in our coffee along with some half and half and it made a nice treat.  Thanks for sharing.

If you really want to make sure that the gingerbread stands out, try (1) a rough chop of the ginger in food processor and (2) soaking the chopped ginger in the water for a few hours before making (3) increasing the amount of ginger you use. This syrup doesn't last long in my house, being used for everything from coffee to over fresh apples. It keeps well and  makes a great host/hostess gift. CHEERS!

I made this with a 1/2 teaspoon GROUND of all the seasonings EXCEPT ground cinnamon and nutmeg, which I used 3/4 tsp. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. This is excellent.
I made this for my Christmas baskets two years in a row and I got several phone calls asking me to make more or for the recipe. I like to pair it with homemade coffee mix and vanilla-dipped spoons. NOTE: I did make one batch with Splenda and it worked out just fine. No complications. Great for people who are watching their sugars/weight.

The only problem is that there's just not enough! Next time I'll reduce the simmering time as it turned out a little too gloopy. I think I'll also use splenda, as I've eaten half of it already off the back of a spoon.
UPDATE: I got hold of some Allspice berries from ebay and it turned out WAY better with them than with the ground. I crushed the ginger through a garlic press, next time I'll try the suggestion of adding brandy. Just had a gingerbread latte for breakfast, just the thing for a cold Scottish morning!

This is very good. It's full of flavor. I did it different though. I couldn't find allspice berries so I used ground allspice instead. Also used ground black pepper instead of peppercorns and it turned out fine. Very good for coffee.

I made this for a dinner I hosted.  I think I tripled the ginger, rather than mashing it or grating it as others suggested, because I don't have any coffee filters or cheesecloth to strain the sediment through.  It's good, but the sweet to flavour ratio means that to get a good flavour in a cup of coffee, you need to have it pretty sweet.  I need to play with it more.  I am thinking of adding more ginger to it and then mixing some of the syrup with lemon and brandy as a cough remedy.  Ginger, pepper, cloves and cinnamon are very healing.

I've been making this syrup for about two years now and just haven't rated it.  It is awsome!  No one I make it for knows how easy it is to prepare but asks me for it all the time.  We use it on everything.  It is especially great in plain oatmeal, the kind that is supposed to be really good for you but no matter what never tastes like anything but paste.  It is super in tea, coffee and over ice cream.  I can't think of anything I wouldn't sweeten with this syrup.  I even like to snack on the sliced ginger after it's been cooked in the syrup.  Way to go!!

Oh Billy, you cruel cruel *cruel* man.  This came together so quickly - strained it, tasted it, thought "hmmmm" and set it aside (I was baking banana nut muffins at the time).  Came bake - tasted it again.  !hmmmmmm! Mixed a little with my coffee ... a little more with some cream cheese, and slathered it on the muffin.  ! YUMMMM ! Went back - poked a few holes in my muffins and drizzled it on top.  !!!! YUM X 265 !!!  This stuffis going to ruin my diet!

Delicious, simple recipe. I decided to add 5 cardamom pods and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla to the ingredients to make a Chai-flavoured syrup. Most of the spices I used were ground. It tastes wonderful in a latte!

Very spicy, and the submitter is right - so many good uses for this. It adds a lot of flavor to just about anything. I followed the recipe but used ground allspice as I had no berries. As it is so spicy and sweet, a little goes a long way.

I'll preface this review by saying I didn't make it exactly; I used ground spices instead of whole, brown sugar instead of white, and omitted the honey.

I intend on making the syrup as published in the next few months to give as Christmas gifts (yes, it's THAT good!), but using ground spices & brown sugar serves our purposes well.  We use this as a pancake/waffle syrup or to top fresh fruit.  I made this on a whim one morning, & my family & guests couldn't stop raving...or eating until every drop was gone!

This is absolutely wonderful. I opted to double the spices so that I could have plenty of flavor without too much sweetness, and that suited my taste perfectly. It's sweet, but also has the warmth of the ginger, cinnamon and pepper. Really a brilliant combination! I use it in both hot and iced coffee, I love it in both.
I think it's important to use the whole spices when possible; that way they infuse the syrup and don't settle on the bottom. 
Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Wonderful!  I was very happy to come across this recipe, as I became a fan of gingerbread latte's over the holidays! How nice to be able to make one at home for a special treat!  Lots of ideas to use this spicy simple syrup - to add flavor to frostings, to simmer sliced pears, flavor coffee and tea, and maybe even over pumpkin waffles or pancakes, although this is SUPER sweet - a little would go a long way.  Thanks for sharing!

I was so pleased with how this turned out. The flavor is outstanding. I may make more next year and include in home made gift baskets, it's just too good to keep to myself!

Delicious!  Made it over and over again.  I added some crystalized ginger, some fresh ginger, doubled the cinnamon & cloves.  YUM.  Tried it the "chai" way too, in the footnotes and I'm never buying chai again.  Wonderful.  Keeper for sure.

I used molasses in place of the honey, which gives it a darker colour and a little more gingerbread flavour. I bought all the spices for a double batch for under fifty cents in bulk. Tastes fantastic.

Interesting combination: If you cut out the allspice, you've essentially made a very basic chai masala syrup. Just a quick comment about a recent discovery, being a ginger chai lover (without all the other spices); add the ginger (grated finely, with a cheese grater) just as you get to the 30-minute mark, shut off the stove, cover (important) and let it cool. Unsure of why, but the aroma and flavor of ginger fades quickly if you overboil it (a volatile oil?). 20 minutes will give it plenty of time to develop in the syrup and you won't need to triple as so many people are suggesting.

Oh my god! This is the best! I love anything gingerbread and I love this! I just made a batch and I keep licking a spoon with it! Just the right amount of spicy and sweet.  Can't wait to try it in coffee!  Also thinking of adding a little to frosting to frost gingerbread cookies with.  Delicious!  Like most, I only had ground allspice and I think it's terrific!  I also used freshly grated nutmeg which I think has a more vibrant taste than ground nutmeg from the store.

I made it as written and found it WAY too sweet for my taste. After I'd added more water, allspice, cinnamon etc, it was perfect. I also added whole cloves for even more flavor. Absolutely wonderful in coffee - will try it on pancakes etc too. Thanks, Billy!

I too used ground allspice...it worked OK. Next time I will take the suggestion of crushing the ginger to release more flavor. This wasn't quite as tasty as another gingerbread coffee recipe from thsi site but it's got much less fat & carbs so that puts it in the lead. Thanks Billy...you hillbillys sure know how to drink your coffee. ;o)

I did a sugar free version of this using splenda in place of sugar and splenda brown sugar in place of the honey and it came out fabulous!  This is definitely a new staple in our kitchen!

This is SO good! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I pressed the ginger through my garlic press instead of sliced it. It made an amazing gingerbread latte - my holiday weakness. I'll be making many more batches of this yummy syrup!

Yummy! I haven't tried this in a drink yet, just pulled it off the stove. I will do an update later. :) I used ground allspice because that's all we have available here.

I am no longer in Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice thrall!  This is delicious, I used splenda instead of the white sugar (kept the honey), and even using mostly powdered ingredients, I was able to use the cheesecloth thicknesses to get it nicely filtered.  7 teaspoons is about how much I like in my cafe au lait.  Next time I'll try to get the fresh, unpowdered ingredients, and also use less splenda.

easy to make, and spicy.  I like it, but next time I'll put in less pepper (I had to use ground black pepper.).

Very good! I think the whole spices and fresh ginger make a difference.  I couldn't find cinnamon sticks (sold out), so used ground cinnamon.  I did not let the mixture cook to syrupy consistency as I planned to use primarily for coffee and preferred regular liquid.  As a side note...I am not one for artificial sweeteners, until now. I tried a couple of commercially-prepared flavored syrups for coffee, and actually preferred the sugar-free version!  I have since purchased cinnamon sticks and a huge bag of Splenda to make this syrup and keep it on hand.

I use AllRecipes regularly but this is the first time I felt I had to write a review. This syrup is fantastic over plain yogurt, in coffee, in tea and on oatmeal, so far. I've also subbed 50% and then 100% Splenda for the sugar, both delicious. I think fresh ginger is a must but I've subbed mulling spices for the cloves, allspice, and cinnamon and it turned out equally tasty. This recipe also spurred me on to create a pure ginger syrup and homemade grenadine for mocktails. Awesome recipe!

I live in an area where it's easy to get ginger paste.  If you can get it, a dollop of that will save you so much work!  
This stuff is also really good in homemade hot chocolate (use unsweetened cocoa so it doesn't end up being too sweet).  It's fantastic!

Amazing gingerbread flavour! I added 1 tsp of molasses to my mixture and it tasted just like old fashioned gingerbread. I did substitute ground cinnamon and crystalized ginger for the ginger root and sticks, as I didn't have any on hand. Much better than the artificially flavoured stuff!

Exactly what I was looking for!  I didn't have the allspice berries or whole ginger so just used the crushed versions.  Thanks for sharing.

This was okay, but too much trouble for such little taste. Will probably just buy the next batch.
