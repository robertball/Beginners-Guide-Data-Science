So easy to make!  I used bacon (instead of ham) only because it's all I had on hand.  But I stuck with the Gruyure as the recipe specifies, and I thought these eggs were excellent.   There are many possibilities with this recipe by switching up the chives with regional herbs that pair well with a specific regional cheese.  I'm sure all would be equally as good as this original recipe.  Thanks, chatoune.

This was the first thing I made in my new cocotte! It was easy and delicious. Good for a beginner like me! I took it to a family gathering and served it with Hawaiian rolls. It was a hit!

I don't make it exactly like this (I omit the ham & gruyere but add oil-cured olives & a fresh tarragon sprig, then top with Parmagiano-Reggiano under Panko crumbs, also substituting butter for the olive oil), but it's my daily breakfast & I recommend it to all.

These eggs are excellent. They make up for a meal. Just toast a few pieces of bread and you got a hearty meal for the cold months. I however will have to fine tune my cooking times since my yolks came out overdone. I made this using my toaster oven so it is different from my big oven. Overall, I will make this again. This is restaurant quality and simplicity all in one.

I thought this was delicious! I cooked a little too long and the yolk wasn't runny. Next time I would shorten the time after removing the lid.
