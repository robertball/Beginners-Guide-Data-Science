I have to say. I was pretty excited about this recipe. I was so excited I forgot to read the reviews, something I usually, and I also didn't even notice the rating. WAY too salty!! I saw the amount of salt and thought, that's a lot, but I never cook Cajun so I thought, I should stick to the recipe, I'm sure it's good. TOOOOO SALTY! I've been adding more water and trying to boil it out. Sad times.

I omitted the salt and reduced the cayenne pepper to 1/4 teaspoon-- it was very good that way.

Use low sodium broth & don't add any salt or this non-cajun dish will be inedible.

Agree- much too salty (I used only 1/2 tsp). However, the other flavors were tasty and it's a simple way to add some kale to a side dish. Would make with low-sodium chicken broth and no additional salt next time- maybe even double the rice/broth to spice ratio. Thanks for the recipe.
