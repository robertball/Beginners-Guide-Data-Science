Had to make a potluck dish in a hurry from ingredients I had on hand and this is what I tried. Great! I like a little kick so I added just a touch of adobo sauce from a can of chipotle peppers.  Not only is this a refreshing, cool side dish, but I brought it to a  cocktail party where we ate it on crackers and it was a real hit.  Nice addition to the summer recipe rotation - Thanks!

I made it for Easter dinner, to go with a ham dinner. My parents loved it, so I will make it again,for them, for sure.  1/4 cup of sugar sounded like a lot to me, so I put in about 3 tablespoons instead.  After everything had marinated for a few hours, it didn't taste as sweet as I thought it would, so next time I'll put in all the sugar.

This is a light and refreshing dish, especially good on a hot summer day, and no mayo involved. I had it with crackers, but tortilla chips would be good, too, for dipping into it. It's perfect as is, I'd like to try adding other flavor enhancers next time, such as Adobo, cumin or smoked paprika. Good for a New Year's Day bean dish as the author suggested. Delicious and healthy, too!

Really good simple recipe. I did not have red onions so used green onions with tops. Delicious Thanks for sharing
