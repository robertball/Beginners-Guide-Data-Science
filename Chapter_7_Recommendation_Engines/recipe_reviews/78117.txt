This recipe is very similar to the 1950's Luchow recipe...it's astoundingly good.  I make mine without the breadcrumbs, and with only one egg.  

Also, I do a sour cream mushroom gravy to go with it.  Once the chops are removed from the pan to a warm plate, I saute mushrooms and shallots in a 2 tbsp of butter and a tbs or two of brandy, and stir in 2 tbs of fresh sour cream...it's a yummy finisher to this most delicious of recipes.

Nice

good to put a drop or two of water between the veal and the plastic as it helps the meat to be able to spread.

the 3 minutes a side depends on the thickness of the veal...the recipe implies about 4 oz cutlets, which can be easily pounded out to a thiness that would cook in that amount of time. But it has to be 1/4 of an inch or so to cook enough in this time so be advised you'll need thin veal to start, not veal chops or something.

Boy did we love this!  Thanks to spiderfarmer for the topping tip (mushrooms, brandy & shallots), that really made it just perfection.  My husband was most impressed.

So quick and simple to prepare, so beautiful and delicious. To give the veal some color interest I added the parsley to the bread crumbs rather than the egg mixture, then browned it in clarified butter so it wouldn't burn. I omitted the nutmeg and, in keeping with the Italian twist of the Parmesan cheese, served this with tomato sauce with vodka and cream and farfalle (bowtie) pasta. ("Vodka Pasta a la Guido," also from this site)

I had two chucks of pork tenderloin.  I pounded them down to 1/4 inch and followed the recipe.  I fixed red cabbage and parsley potatoes to go along with the wienerschnitzel for an excellent German dinner. I will fixed these again!

I did these with beef, since I am anti-veal, but they were EXCELLENT! Came out crispy and delicious. Once I removed from the pan, I added just a touch of lemon juice, and it tasted just like Oma's Haus!

I spent my teen years in Munich and have been jonesing for Wienerschnitzel since 1987.  I used pork cutlets instead of veal (I just can't bring myself to buy veal), omitted the parmesan (it just didn't seem right) and forgot the nutmeg. Served with pommes and radiisalat, the way I remembered it.  It pretty much rocked.  Thanks for the post!!!

really really tasty!  I teach a cooking class for young children and even my picky eaters enjoyed this.  I did substitute pork for the veal and served with a side of Spaetzle--great German dish for my class to create!  Thanks!

This has to be the best Wienerschnitzel I have ever made! I used thin boneless Pork Chops and pounded them until I could read through them and followed the recipe exactly -Putting the breaded chops in the fridge is a must for the coating to stay put-I put the cooked chops in a 190 degree oven to stay warm and made a sauce using another poster's idea-I used mushrooms and shallots and cognac and when they were soft I added a tbs of flour and cooked it out and added whole milk to make a sauce-I salted and peppered it and it was fabulous! Well worth the extra steps but even the kids enjoyed it-The pork came out moist and tender -This recipe I will be making again-Next time for company

This was really easy to prepare and cooked up quickly too. My family just wasn't impressed though, they both rated this a 3. They offered no suggestions as to what would have improved this. My son ate his with plum sauce and liked it that way better that way. They thought this was dry and needed a sauce of some type. Thanks, I enjoyed preparing something new.

This rivals my Austrian friend's Wienerschnitzel!  I love it.  I did try it with thin pork chops and it was fabulous.  Did the recipe exactly except for that.  I don't doubt that veal would be excellent.  Will try that soon.  Thanks for the recipe!

DELICIOUS...EASY...KID-FRIENDLY!  

Fell in love w/pork wienerschnitzel after recently dining at a German restaurant.  Wanted to try and recreate that meal and this recipe worked like a charm.  

Substituted pork for veal. Started w/four thick boneless pork chops and cut them in half.  Pounded them flat till about 1/4" thick. (8 cutlets total). Added some garlic powder (about 1/2 tsp).  

Did not refrigerate the cutlets b/c I didn't have time.  Didn't matter...they were delicious!  Served w/McCormick's "brown gravy" (buy it in a packet in spice section of grocery store) on top of the cutlets.  YUM!

Excellent recipe, I've often said with substituting pork loin cutlets for veal, seasoning then breading, it's next to impossible to tell the two apart.
Real veal is very hard to come by, by saying real veal I mean milk fed. Most meat that is passed off for veal in butcher shops and supermarkets is merely baby beef,,,so save your money.

This came out terrific. The only change I made was to omit the butter and I used olive oil instead. I refrigerated for around 3 hours and I followed the directions to cook on medium heat. I did not have the problems that some reviewers have had where they have had the coating coming off in the pan. I served with a side of lightly seasoned pasta and a simple salad of greens and a vinaigrette. Perfect!

Easy and unbelievably tasty. Follow the recipes's suggestion and let the breaded veal sit in the fridge for a while before frying so the crust doesn't slip off in the pan.

This is good, but just wanted to note that this is not a german dish, it is Austrian, to be specific it is Viennese.  'Wiener' is german for Viennese

We loved this recipe! The crust was crispy and delicious. It was as good as the schnitzel I've had in Germany and Austria. I topped them with a creamy mushroom sauce and served with Brie and ricotta sacchettini pasta and it was amazing! Will definitely be eating again!

Great recipe! I forgot to dust the meat with flour first and it still turned out wonderful. I loved the flavors. I substituted veal for pork cutlets. Served it with spaetzle in a creamy sage sauce and applesauce on the side.

GOOD & EASY ! I have used thin sliced pork chops and also veal in this recipe.  It is VERY easy, but the key is letting the meat sit in the fridge after it is breaded.  Don't forget a squirt of lemon juice at the end of cooking time before it goes on your plate !  That makes a big differnce !  NOT low fat, but yummy !

Very good! I used Pork Cutlets and Panko bread crumbs. Watch carefully when frying they brown real quickly. The lemon works very well! I served this with New Potatoes sauteed with butter and parsley.

This was so incredibly yummy.  I served it with penne pasta in rosemary cream sauce.  Next time I will whip up a simple mushroom gravy to go with it, b/c I love lots of sauce....however, just a squeeze of lemon was perfection as well!

Good recipe. It works also very well with pork or beef milanesa that you can get in many Mexican stores.
Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Love this recipe, we use pork and increase the egg mixture by 50%. We also add about 1/8th cup of lemon juice to the cutlets after they cook. This recipe reminds me of the dish my sister in law fixed when she came here from Germany

This is delicious! This is about the third time I have made this. The only changes I made, I used cubed pork cutlets instead of veal and I used seasoned flour. You should also try Chef John's Mushroom gravy with this (on this site)! It's all soo worth the time and effort!!

Such amazing flavor! Perfect amount of breading.  I have to say, that I am used to seasoning the bread crumbs and not the egg mixture. However, I think I may do it like this from now on.  I made it into a veal parmesan and served it with Grandma's butter noodles from this site.  Loved it!

I like to add the salt and pepper in the form of freshly cracked pepper and kosher salt right into the bread crumbs. I also always use fresh parsley as what is schnitzel without parsley potatoes and lemon slices? Beautiful recipe--thank you.

Great!  Not having veal or pork on hand, I used chicken breasts that I pounded flat.  They were fabulous!

I used some chops that I deboned and pounded out somewhat.  I ended up fixing about 4 good sizes pans of it, and each time I added butter and a little olive oil.  I knew that by the end, there wasnt going to be enough left in the pan to drizzle, so I made a mixture of melted butter with a little lemon juice and I brushed it on after I removed the meat from the frying pan.  The crust absorbed it nicely but did not become soggy or anything.  Everyone really seemed to enjoy it.

I used thinly pounded boneless pork chops. The breading stayed on beautifully-maybe the refrigeration helps? I served this a la holstein, topped with a fried egg and anchovies, and it was as close to the real deal as you can get at home! Don't forget the lemon, it adds a lot to the dish.

This was very very good.  Everyone in my family loved it.  This was my first time trying veal and I will be cooking this again. I made it exactly as directed. I did have a hard time finding veal because not a lot of grocery stores carry it.  But, I had the butcher at the grocery store special order it for me at another store.  Boy, was I glad after I made it!

The recipe is great. I would give it 5 stars other than the amount of butter I used to fry them ideally. I tried using less but it left them pale and dry. I will definately use this again. Boneless pork was great too and a bargain.

Just made this today for the first time. It was DEEEEEElicous. Be sure not to heat your butter up too much, or you'll brown your breadcrumbs too much. I didn't have any parsley so I substituted Oregano, and it came out mighty tasty. Searved it with mashed potatos and veggies.

Omitted the Parmesan as it did not need it.  The sauce was a nice addition and didn't drown the meat. Will definitely make again.

Just finished eating this. Followed recipe exactly with following exceptions: used italian bread crumbs and used veal arm chops. It was very good, next time I will look for a thinner cut as they did have to cook a bit longer than recipe said. The lemon slices just made the dish. Had it with spaetzen, rye bread, and brussels sprouts. Good solid German food!

This was good.  I thought it a little boring to serve just as is....so after I prepared it exactly like the recipe above I topped it with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese broiled it for just a few minutes and laid it to rest on a toasted crusty roll.  I couldn't just leave it like that so I sauteed onions, mushrooms and peppers and voila...a DELICIOUS and filling veal sandwich.  YUMM

This recipe was absolutely wonderful. I used pork cutlets instead of veal & other than the breading coming off while cooking (make sure you move the cutlets while they're cooking or they will stick to the pan), it tasted so delicious. I will try this again and attempt to keep the breading from sticking to the pan in the future.

My wife and I enjoyed this for two nights in a row.  Served over angel hair pasta.  I used pork cutlets instead of veal.  I'm sure it would be great using veal and will try it in a couple of weeks.

Loved it!!! made it last night and it was delicious.  one problem ws that there was not too much juice to pour over cutlets on the platter. I had to keep adding butter to pan which is a problem if we are watching fat intake/calories.

Wonderful. The whole family called it a keeper. I used pork loin instead of veal - it was fine. Otherwise I followed the instructions. Next time I'll try the sauce mentioned by another reviewer. I served this with hot German Potato salad and red cabbage.

Wonderful!  I didn't have time to refrigerate this time and it still turned out great.  There is lots of flavor.  I didn't have any juice left in the pan so I just sprinkled them with parm and lemon juice.

This is wonderful!  We had a Girls Night Out with The Sound of Music as our theme--so we had this for dinner--with noodles of course, perfectly paired with Austrian wines (Gruner Veltliner and Zweigelt). We watched the movie (and sang the whole way through it) and had Salzburg Mozart Chocolates for dessert!  Super yummy and super fun!

Made this exactly according to the recipe, except used pork cutlets rather than veal.It was pretty good, but both of us deemed it a bit bland. Next time, I'll lightly season the dredging flour with salt and pepper. The egg wash that was left behind still contained most of the grated cheese and parsley, and probably the salt, pepper, and nutmeg, too. So I'll put the grated cheese (Probably Pecorino Romano instead of Parmesan) and the seasonings into the crumb dredge, hoping to get a little more of those flavoring agents to remain on the meat rather than going down the drain with the spent egg wash. Lastly, I may also throw a little lemon pepper in with the crumbs.

Great recipe! I added little bit of minced onion and garlic to the egg mixture. Also, instead of making a sauce to top it with, I heated up some red cabbage and dumped it on top, wonderful! This recipe is definitely a keeper! I served it with the 'Tangy German Potato Salad' recipe, also a 'keeper'.

Absolutely loved it! The only thing I did differently was to saute the veal in olive oil and just a little butter.  I will definitely make this again.

Simplified it for a quick lunch. Salt and pepper the flattened pork tenderloin, then plain flour, then into 2 beaten eggs with 1 Tbs veg oil added (tip I learned to keep the coating fluffy and not fuse to the meat), then bread crumbs. Deep fried in swirling oil (lifting the pot handle up and down) for better heat distribution. My 6 yr old loved it so much that he now wants it for lunch and dinner everyday and says they´re better than McD´s nuggets. I tried with the cheese in the coating but it left a sticky mess behind in the pan for the next piece, so each one got progressively darker and somewhat unappealing.

I tried this recipe because my hubby likes Wienerschnitzel. It was so delicious and both of us really enjoyed it. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used veal scallopini. My hubby asked me to make this again:) Thank you for the delicious recipe.

My boys and I made this after being inspired by the kids book "Bread and Jam For Frances."  We all LOVED it and they've been begging for it.  Today my 13yr old will make it on his own!

Even though I felt the recipe was very good, I can only give it 4 stars.  I work for a German company and travel quiote frequently to Germany.  I always have the Wienerschnitzel during my trips.  I guess my taste is conditioned to comaparing the authentic German Weinerschnitzel to this one.  It was veruy good though.

Great recipe!  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs for more flavor.  I want to try regular bread crumbs for a more authentic German taste.  I will certainly make these again.

I made the recipe with Panko Bread Crumbs.  Although it was tasty and worked out great, I suspect regular bread crumbs might have worked just as well.

I loved this recipe. I used pork, and plain Panko bread crumbs. I cut parm cheese in half. Other than that, I followed the rest of the recipe to a tee. If you can get your hands on packaged hunter sauce -dry mix, to pour over it at the end, it is amazing. This is how they serve it at my local German restaurant,

I used bone-in pork chops, cutting the bones out before I prepared the meat. 3 minutes on each side of these thin cut chops was not enough time; they were still pink. Use a meat thermometer next time. All five enjoy this dish.

Followed the recipe exactly. The meat cooked nicely and it was very tender. I didn’t think the flavor was anything great, it was okay though. They weren’t bad, just nothing special. I think I’d try another recipe before using this one again. I didn’t want to use the nutmeg, but I didn’t even notice it.

I used thin cut pork chops and omitted the Parmesan. My husband is on a low salt diet, so I didn’t add any salt just pepper. It was delicious.

I followed the recipe and was glad I did.  My guest even begged for the leftovers!  It was very tasty and easy.  Great for a dinner party since everything is breaded ahead of time, I served the traditional cucumber salad with sour cream dressing and par boiled, then microwaved at the last minute parsley baby potatoes.  Everyone was pleased.  And one of my guest lived in Vienna for a time and he loved it!

The flavor was not as distinct as I thought it would be with the parmesan. Overall, it is very good surprised me that it was cooked in butter I used to always cook in oil.

Huge hit for the high school German food assignment (yes, it's Austrian, but that was agreed to before it was done).  Also a hit at home.  We added peppercorn gravy to really make it stand out!

Very , very good. Made for Sunday supper.  Let sit in fridge for the afternoon before frying.  Also made a gravy from a package because I just made orzo for the kids. If making mashed potatoes would cook some mushrooms and add cream of mushroom for the gravy.  I bought pork cutlets from Sobeys.

Quick and easy, crusty and light. Didn't have a lemon. It would have improved it. But we did have beef gravy, spätzle, and German red cabbage. My husband was happy.

I made this with thin sliced boneless pork loin.  Instead if putting the parmesan in the slurry, I put it in the breadcrumbs. I think too much parmesan would get lost in the slurry. It was very tasty. Easy to do 4 pieces in a cast iron frying pan.  This one is a keeper.

Delicious!  Big family favorite!  No major changes other than using thin pork cops (still beaten) instead.

I have made this many times...always with pork. In a word...amazing!  Serve with a mushroom sauce, or your favorite tomato pasta sauce and parmesan. Delicious! Easy to make ahead and freeze for a quick easy meal.

This was fabulous , following the advice of others, I also made the sautéed mushrooms with butter, shallots, brandy & sour cream.  Simply said, DEVINE.  I served with fresh waxed yellow beans and easy rice pilaf also from this site.  Hubby was super impressed.   Thanks everyone for posting & suggestions.  That is why I love this site.  Will be making this over & over!!

I used pork instead of veal... It took 15 minutes or so per side. The recipe was ok but I definitely prefer the version without Parmesan.

This was delicious. I did have to increase the amount of wet dip though even though I had under 1 1/2 # of Pork cutlets. I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! It was my turn to host our get-together with our friends and this is what I made.  It was very well-received.  Even those who originally said they don't eat veal ended up eating every morsel!  I prepped it early in the morning and then let it hang out in the fridge for about 10 hours.  The breading stayed on the veal while frying and was a very light, delicate breading which did not overpower the flavor of the veal.  Will I make this again? Absolutely!

Didn't really like it. I used veal and the breading seemed like it was too much.

I make this recipe with venison cutlets and it is AMAZING!!! We love it so much that when we butcher our deer in the fall we put aside about 10lbs just for schnitzel.

It was awesome!! I didn't have any veal and neither did the store so I used a little thin beef steak.  It was soo good.  My only mistake was that a few of the pieces were too big.  They were still good.  Just not as easy to cook.

I loved this recipe.  I was at this function where they served wienerschnitzel and I had no idea what it was.  So I immediately looked for a recipe and this was excellent!  I was a bit afraid because I didn't remember to refrig for 1 hr. or overnight, but it worked out well - didn't loose and coating.  Thank you!!

Delicious and easy!  I only used one egg but followed the rest of the recipe as written. It was really tasty, my husband couldn't stop eating it.
