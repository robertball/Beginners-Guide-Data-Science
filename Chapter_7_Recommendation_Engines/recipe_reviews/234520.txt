These are so much easier and tastier than any fried chicken tenders! They get very crispy and the honey mustard adds a nice sweetness.

They were just too crispy. The sauce is good. But the two layers of breadcrumbs was too much.

I followed the recipe pretty much 100% and it turned out really tasty (according to the husband!). I put into the oven for 15 mins and then turned it over for another 5 mins. Will definitely cook this delicious dish again!

It was bland and had a slightly musty taste that my husband nor I liked at all. I think the whole wheat flour was a mistake and I found the sauce very strange tasting. Substituting a commercial mustard sauce helped a little.

Turned out much better than I expected. Did not have Orange juice so I used apricot jam instead. My wife was impressed.

So easy and good. I made my own panko using some sour dough English muffins and baked on a rack at 425 convection for 10 minutes. Then turned them over and turned off the heat and left in the oven for 5 more minutes. They came out beautifully crispy and tasty. This one is a keeper.

I will coat the cooling racks with cooking spray next time as my chicken stuck and I lost most of the bottoms.

Due to a food allergy I don't use the orange juice - that said - have made this a couple of times. I find that the longer you let it sit and marinade the better it tastes. The whole wheat flour gives it a healthy touch when using flour to allow the bread crumbs to stick and bake.

These were very good but just a little on the bland side for our family. I think next time I'll try adding some garlic salt and perhaps even a dash of cayenne pepper to the breadcrumbs. I did like the addition of the orange juice to the sauce it brightened the flavor and the color.

This was a great recipe for a healthy chicken tender. I eliminated the egg dip and flour simply took chicken out of marinade and coated in breadcrumbs. I used a combo of whole wheat and plain panko crumbs. And I sprayed both sides of tenders with with olive oil out of a mister. In marinade I used Dijon mustard since I do not care for the other recipe called for.

Delicious! Even freezes well. And you probably won't need as much flour as the recipe calls for.

I followed recipe as written and liked the flavor the marinade gave the chicken. Marinated for 5 hours. Didn't really like the Panko breaking.

My son requested "chicken nuggets" so I cut the chicken into smaller pieces before coating. I would recommend doubling the sauce for dipping we devoured the honey mustard sauce. A new family favorite!

Only one side of my chicken got crispy. That was a big disappointment.

My teens said they were good but not very flavorful i.e. not enough seasoning. I will try them again but may add some Crystal hot sauce and will salt and pepper the chicken before I marinate it.
