I doubled this recipe. I had to adjust this just a touch to reflect what I had on hand. I used lactose-free milk but I did add a touch of almond flavoring to the smoothie ingredients. I did not have flax seed oil but I did have flax seed MEAL, I added a tablespoon per serving. I also used honey instead of agave nectar because I didn't have that, either. The kids loved this smoothie. I'm sorry about the substitutions but it turned out just as delicious with what I had on hand.

very very good! Its wasnt as thick as most smoothies but it was good! I did change the recipe around a bit though. I did  not use the flax seed oil or nectar. My fruit was not frozen so I added about a cup of ice. I also added about a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Instead of almond milk I used 1% milk. I wanted extra flavor so I added 3/4 cup of strawberries as well as the blueberries. great recipe!

I love smoothies, and this one is no exception. I used nonfat black cherry greek yogurt because it's what I had as well as flax seed instead of the oil. Delicious way to start the day!

I didn't have flax seed oil so I used ground flax seed and I didn't have agave nectar so I used honey and It was absolutely delicious and I will definitely make this again, you could use any frozen fruit.

I changed a few things. I put spirulina, chia seeds, vanilla almond milk, and vanilla yogurt. It came out very delicious. I chose not to add any extra sweetener or nectar, tastes great as is! Yum! :)

It's yummy. You can taste the fruit. I omitted the agave nectar and flaxseed oil for some honey to taste. You should serve it like this: a cup, filled 3/4 way with the smoothie, a layer of yogurt and some honey to drizzle

This is a good smoothie. I used everything except I didn't have flaxseed oil. I used coconut oil instead. Since I use unsweetened almond milk, I used vanilla yogurt for a little more sweetness.

The only changes I made were substituting milled flax seed for flaxseed oil and added  strawberry protein powder(which made it extra delicious!!!), and a good morning meal replacement

I used coconut milk instead of almond milk,  I also used coconut oil instead of the flax seed oil .  I also added a 1/2 tsp. chia seed.    My husband even liked it & he doesn't usually like smoothies.  Absolutely one of the best ones I've ever tried.  Will definitely make again.

Made some changes to satisfy my taste buds. Used both the berries, honey, 2% milk, low-fat plain vanilla yogurt and some Medjool dates. Tasted Awesome.
