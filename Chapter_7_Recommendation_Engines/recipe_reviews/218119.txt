This is a fantastic recipe. I had planned on making this tonight and, rather suddenly, I found myself watching twin 7-year-old boys. I thought there would be no way that they would eat this, but I went ahead and made it anyway. They INHALED it and asked for more. My husband loved it and wants me to make it again soon. I made one change, I could have sworn that I had fresh ginger in the fridge, but I didn't. I used a teaspoon of ground ginger instead. Thanks for submitting this recipe, it's delicious!

I was intrigued by this recipe, I felt sure the tomato ketchup would appeal to my picky eaters. I wasn't wrong they lapped this up. I made 2 slight changes, I used jarred chopped ginger and to use it up one fresh tomato. My husband did say the lime juice was a little strong for him although noone else agreed with him. I might reduce it to just 1t next time and omit the zest. Thanks for the recipe.

I used 3 Tablespoons of whipped cream cheese in place of the cream and yogurt, and instead of stewed tomatoes, I used peeled whole tomatoes.  Came out wonderful. A little sweet tasting, but I think that is because of the cinnamon and the ketchup.  Easy and quick.

This was very very good. Subbed out some spices, as I didn't have them on hand, but other than that prepared as is.  I used cucumber and plain yoghurt as garnish; it worked very well. Basmati rice and pita (no naan in my very small town grocery) rounded it out. 

Family likes it; I'm allowed to put it on the rotating menu. :-) Forgot the lime, still enjoyed it. 

One small quibble, the recipe as written says nothing about the stewed tomatoes. I added them with the ketchup, etc., and as far as I could tell it was fine. I may adjust it in the future for heat, but solid as is.

I hate to do this but I want to help others from making the same mistake. The cinnamon is very overpowering in this recipe. Also very salty flavor. If you don't like Indian food don't waste your time or money. Sorry

Excellent. I used diced tomatoes and evaporated milk. I did not use lime juice or zest, or cream or yogurt.

Really good. Only question is... where do the stewed tomatoes come in? They are listed as ingredients but didn't know when to add them. Accidentally omitted them but didn't even realize until I had finished the meal. My boyfriend loves Indian food and was impressed with this.

I omitted the ketchup because I thought it would make it too sweet and it was absolutely delicious way, way better than the jarred sauces!
