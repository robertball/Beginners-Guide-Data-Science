It was a very good soup. I think needs more liquid. Next time will add a cup more broth. Also I think the garlic could go to 2 cloves. Very heavy garlic flavor as written.

Great flavorful recipe! Hubby complimented me on it. We agreed that the tomato paste and red pepper flakes were essential to the deep flavor. Only changes I made were adding a handful of chopped spinach and a diced celery stalk bc I had them. Also I used actual chicken parmesan breastsI had made a couple of nights ago.

I didn't have any penne so I used medium shells instead. Whenever I make it it's definitely more of pasta than a soup but it's delicious so who cares. I double the amount of garlic.
