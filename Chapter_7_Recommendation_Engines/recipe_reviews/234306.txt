Leaving to shop for the ingredients, but to me this is the ONLY style that can be called a cobbler!  It has drops of yummy dough in the filling! Yum!

This recipe is a keeper.  I modified it slightly.  I have a very small kitchen, and I do not have all of the kitchen implements that are normally found in everyday kitchens.  I used a wooden cutting board to divide the dough.  As mentioned previously, I dipped the dough chunks into melted butter followed by a bowl of sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon.

I used peaches in heavy syrup, and I drained one of the cans thoroughly, thinking that there would be too much liquid otherwise.  This turned out to be a wise move, since there was plenty of liquid, even after adding a bit more corn starch to the mixture.

Absolutely amazing!  Pretty sure my family and I heard the angels singing when we ate this.  Didn't have canned peaches on hand but did have fresh peaches we had gotten from our local peach festival here in Louisiana (used 8).  I won't use any other peach cobbler recipe, your grandmother's is definitely the best.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very easy recipe yielding delicious feel good comfort dish of days gone by!  I’ve made it twice now and my only comment is that the recipe didn’t specify whether or not the peaches should be drained. I’m more of a cook than a baker so most probably got that without the specifics. I will say it was much better when I didn’t drain the peaches. Thank you for sharing your wonderful family desert recipe with the rest of us!

Made it pretty much exactly according to the recipe. Only difference is I put a crust on the bottom. It was great and I will make it again.

I only made slight changes like making home made biscuits for the dumplings. Otherwise, this looks and tastes like the same recipe my mama and her people used in North and South Carolina. I picked many a peach from the backyard tree when I was a boy, so that Mama would make rhis cobbler. It went great with the vanilla ice cream. I'm 63 and retired now. Thanks for the memories and the great recipe. 
Peace.

It's a winner! This was my first time ever making peach cobbler. Everyone loved it. I think the only thing I will alter next time is cut my biscuits smaller next time. Everyone loved it!

Delicious!  Made it for Thanksgiving!  I changed it up, by using cinnamon rolls dough, instead of biscuit dough! Crowd pleaser, and very easy to make!

My Mom used to make peach cobber that was always...well...yucky to be honest.  And so I never thought I liked peach cobbler.  Fast forward many years and my hubs asks for peach cobbler.  This recipe is outstanding and I made it exactly as it reads.  I thought it was a little time consuming doing the biscuits but after tasting it I've decided it wasn't time consuming at all.  Heaven!

This was really good. I did make an error and didn't cover it before baking and the biscuits were black on the top and hard. Wasn't so good. Quick remedy......I took them out and dropped a few more biscuits in and reheated the following day and was delicious.  This was so easy of a recipe and I am finally a believer that you don't have to go through all of the work to blanch and peel peaches to have a great cobbler.

This recipe is reminiscent of my mother's peach cobbler which I had never made--only eaten for decades. My only changes were for convenience. Instead of using biscuits and pie crust, I used pancake mix (I had Krusteaz light & fluffy buttermilk pancake mix on hand). After following the recipe (adjusted to serve four), I sprayed a 4 cup Pyrex with butter; poured in the peach mix;  loosely mixed in a cup of the pancake mix; and baked as directed. Yum!!

Yes made changes but very similar...cooked keifer pears down and added ingredients.  I had frozen biscuits so cut 3 in half and layered then cut 3 up and poked into top layer.
Mmmmm! ;)
Next time adding blueberries to pears! ;)
