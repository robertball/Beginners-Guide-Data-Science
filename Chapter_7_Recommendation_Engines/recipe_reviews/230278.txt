Fantastic! Definitely a macaroon texture.  This is NOT a custard-y pie, but it is delicious!      Only had 3/4 C of sugar on hand and it was MORE than enough when combined with the sweetened coconut.  Any more would render it waaaay too sweet.  Also added vanilla because, well, vanilla.

About halfway through cooking-- foiled covered the pie crust and sprinkled some more coconut on top for a little toasted flavor.

Did I mention how easy it was to make?

I have made this twice to take to family/friend gatherings.  It disappears and everyone raves about it!  Once, I drizzled my special dark chocolate sauce over the top ... Yum!  Also, it doubles well!

nice, tasty pie. Turned out well 1st time. But a little too sweet as written. Next time I'll try 1-1/4 c sugar & 5 T butter. Also will make sure it cooks no longer than 1 hr...maximum. A keeper!

I enjoyed the pie and it was simple enough to make. I did use unsweetened coconut in mine and would highly recommend cutting back on the sugar. All in all it was a nice pie. Thanks for the recipe ??

Really easy; really yummy. One comment said to use less sugar, and add vanilla. It was delicious and disappeared quickly

This tasted like my Mom's coconut macaroon pie.  Enough said.
