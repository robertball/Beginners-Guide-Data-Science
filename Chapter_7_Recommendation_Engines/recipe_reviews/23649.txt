An absolutely scrumptios apple pie. Really easy, too. I loved the way the streusel carmelized...turning it into a flaky, spicy, melt in your mouth delicacy!

This was a great recipe for our family.  I made a gluten free version (which is easy to do because of the amount of flour used) substituting 3/4c rice flour, 1/4c potato starch and 1/4c tapioca starch for the all-purpose flour in the crust and just rice flour in the topping.  Excellent!

I was not impressed with the recipe.  The pie came out really liquidy, and after an hour, the crumble on the top had melted into the pie because it had so much liquid.  Perhaps I will try it again, but toss a few tablespoons of flour or cornstarch with the apples, along with some cinnamon and sugar.

I made this for Thanksgiving - truly delicious!  I doubled the recipe and used a standard 9x11 casserole dish...best with Granny Smith apples.

I thought it was a very nice way to do a pie...kind of a tart..but not really. I enjoyed it very much. I did however think it defeats the purpose of a "crumble" however when it just melts into the appples. Perhaps not covering it for the last 25 minutes would cause it to stay crummblt/crunchy on top.

I loved this pie, the filling was fantastic. I left the foil off altogether. The topping turned out crunchy but not over doing it. I did add Minute Tapioca 1/3 of a cup, but i also haved the recipe.  I did find that there wasn't enough pastry in the recipe to cover the bottom of an 8" X 8" square cake pan, so i did half with this recipe, and half with the never never fail pie crust that I had left over. It worked well.

I found that after I covered the pie for last 25 minutes, the topping turned to liquid.  It didn`t quite have the look I wanted but, tasted good.  Maybe I should have just covered the edges.  Live and learn.  I will try that next time.

This was delicious!! I didn't have white sugar or lard on hand, or unsalted butter. I used light brown sugar and made it 1/2 cup of butter (instead of 1/4 butter 1/4 lard), and used a pinch less salt in the crust. I split the butter in half, cold, and chopped into small cubes. I melted half of those, then put them in the freezer to quick cool (does not need to be frozen). Made crust in food processor with the cold butter (key for perfect flaky crust). Just don't overprocess, it should be clumpy, not fine powder. It should fall apart when shaken, but mold together if you squeeze it in your palm.

I also added 1/4 tsp vanilla extract & 1/4 cup finely chopped pecans to the crust, and another 1/3 cup chopped pecans to the streusel. 

Covered with foil for the last 20 mins as recipe states, and did not have the 'melting' issue others have noted. The texture was great, the crust was flaky. Allover perfection. My boyfriend doesn't even like sweets/desserts, but after trying a bite of my slice, he went and grabbed a heaping slice of his own! Perfect with a scoop of Talenti vanilla bean gelato!

Great tasting pie! I would make sure to use Unsalted butter because the bottom crust was a little too salty for my taste. The top was perfect- not too dark for being unwrapped the whole time.

Very good! I only covered the edges with foil for the last part of baking and it turned out perfect.
