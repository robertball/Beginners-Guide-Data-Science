Fabulous dessert that's simple and delicious! If you like baked apples in the oven then you'll love 'em over the fire. Not only because of the ease of prep (you can basically eyeball vs. measure), but because of the ease of clean up - there is none! I sprayed the foil with a bit of Pam so nothing would stick and added a pat of Land O Lakes light butter over top along with a splash of vanilla. This was great with vanilla ice cream. Next time I might add some raisins or a splash of rum vs. vanilla for a little different flavor...

I doubled this recipe and I used homemade apple pie spice instead of cinnamon. I didn't make mine in the "fire", I wrapped my apples in foil and stuck them in the cast iron skillet and baked it at 350 for ten minutes. The kids thought this was wonderful.

excellent at our last camping trip.  used red delicious apples as they are our favorite.  Took some of the other suggestions and in my apple I put caramel instead of sugar and cinnamon--sooooo good.  Afterwards I knew that next camping trip we were bringing LOTS of apples!!

O.M.G.! So easy and delicious. It's apple pie in a tin foil pouch without the crust. The brown sugar mix melts begging you to smoosh the apple into it. I needed more brown sugar mix to stuff my apple so bring extra with you. No need to wait for a camping trip ... any night your grilling you should consider this simple and satisfying dessert. I wouldn't hesitate to bring this prep'd and wrapped to a cookout for a unique and fresh dessert. Some vanilla icecream would put it over the top!

Easy, quick, and succulent. I added ground almonds and a teeny pinch of salt to the filling.

It was a great treat by the fire. I felt that the apple needed to cook just a little longer, about 20 minutes or so. But it is personal preference.

This is a great camping recipe.  Try incorporating small, hard, cinnamon candy bits to give it a "candy apple" flair!

I was in charge of meal planning for our church's youth retreat this summer and one of my challenges was finding yummy yet nutritous foods that teenagers wouldn't balk at. This was one of several recipes from this site that I used and it was a huge hit. Everyone just loved it!

It was great because my sister-in-law is allergic to gluten and dairy, she loved it! I added a scoop of vanilla icecream for everyone else and it was a hit! best of all it didn't leave me feeling full of sugar and guilty!

They were great! All of my children loved them - what a healthy way to enjoy nature's sweet-tooth.  I tried it with caramel and that was decadent too!

Sooo delicious and easy. We prepped before camping. I actually cut the apples in half and cut out the core. Then used toothpicks to hold the two halves together. Threw them on a grate over the campfire for about 15 min. We didn't end up eating them that night, but saved them for lunch the next afternoon. They were a little messy, but still yummy!

Outstanding!  My family (plus my parents) were very impressed with these.  Very simple but delicious.  I did add some butter and some chopped pecans as well.  Versatile; could play around with the spices a bit as well; cardamom would be a lovely choice.

This was great. Even my picky 4 yr old enjoyed these apples. I left it in longer, about 1 hr. It still came out perfect.
