This is a great recipe. I followed it exactly and it came out delicious. I used all whole wheat flour, I didnt have white flour. Also, I put it in the mircowave for a total of 2 minutes. Will make again!

Was pretty good, made with a whole egg as I did not know how to halve an egg!  Used a soup mug instead of a coffee mug and think it would have cooked over otherwise.  Accidentally put in 1/4 tsp baking powder but was still fine, added a small handfull of frozen blueberries to the batter.  My only complaint is the topping, would almost have liked to pop it under the broiler, used to having struzel topping that is melted and crisped up a bit.

As written, it seems a little eggy/rubbery as other reviewers have stated. With a tablespoon less sour cream and approx. 1/3 of an egg instead, the second mug cake was better. We will keep playing around with it because we like the concept. Thanks!

This was a fun recipe! Perfect for the nights you crave cake but dont feel like baking one. I didnt have any brown sugar so I just skipped the 2nd part of the recipe all together. It wasnt bad! Still worth five stars. I never liked frosting so this turned out perfect. I wouldnt say it was on the rubbery side like one review stated. More like bouncey? Its a microwave cake what do you expect? I saved the other half of my egg cause im going to make another one later. Next time one of my kids has a sleep over im going to show this one off.

This was a very good recipe. I didn't have sour cream, so I just used 1 whole egg instead of a half of one. Also, I substituted Pamela's gluten free all purpose flour for the regular flour. Fantastic flavor and texture! Especially for a gluten free cake. I think I will try mixing in the brown sugar and cinnamon topping next time though, because with the GF flour it was a little floury tasting.

I usually have issues with the texture of mug cakes so I kind of knew to adjust some of the measurements just a tiny bit. I used 2 tblsp of butter to the batter instead of the 1, added an extra 1 tblsp.of flour to the 1/4 cup, and 1 egg yolk instead of the half egg. The topping is great as is. I also microwaved for 90 seconds. The texture came out GREAT. Cakey just like a coffee cake should be. Very yummy and definitely a keeper.

I made this as a lemon cake which is my favorite.  I omitted the cinnamon and brown sugar and substituted 1 tablespoon sugar instead.   What a wonderful addition to my 1 serving recipes collection.

This was so easy and tasted pretty good. I made it without the topping. I actually liked the dense and moist consistency of the cake due to being microwaved. I was looking for a super quick pastry recipe to use when my fruit salad turned juicier than I wanted it to (so I used it as a topping), and it was perfect topped with the berries. If I were to just eat this cake by itself, I would add a little more vanilla next time. I doubled the recipe and made it in a bowl; it worked great. Thank you, Adastra808.

We made this when the kids were craving something sweet and we were low on groceries. We didn't even have an egg! We made an egg substitute (flour, oil, water, baking soda) substituted cream cheese and a little extra butter for the sour cream, and skipped the topping altogether. We doubled the recipe and split it into 3 mugs. Cooked each mug individually for 1.5 minutes. The kids said it was a little burned on the bottom. Keep in mind what another reviewer said about the "wet" appearance around the edges...perhaps that's not an indication it's undercooked. Five stars since we didn't have the right ingredients, so it wouldn't be fair to drop stars. The kids enjoyed it.

The eggs all went to the bottom. I didn't care for it, except for the crumb topping. I might make that by its self..

I accidentally put in too much baking powder, it rose too much, but I had an excellent time eating the spilled stuff off the plate! This recipe is fantastic.

I goofed. I got the two flour amounts mixed up somehow and ended up with the 2T of flour in the cake portion. I didn't realize this because I didn't make the streusel Topping. The next time I made it I realized the mistake and used the proper 1/4c of flour as written and also left off the streusel topping. The "goofed" version with half the flour amount was the one we preferred. It's more moist overall. This will be my go-to single-serving cake from now on. So good!

Made a few changes based on lots of other combined reviewers' suggestions: 1 TbL extra flour, Just the egg yolk instead of halting a whole egg, double butter amount for topping

Ive made this twice so far and its exactly what ive been looking for. Instead of shortening i just used an entire egg. it tastes great. i also, only recommend ONE minute in the microwave. Be cautious after that, the first time i overcooked very quickly. still tasted good though.

We loved them both.

I liked this okay. I added a tablespoon of cherry pie filling and used almond extract. I also added red sugar to the topping. (It was for a Valentine's Day theme.) Mine took 2 minutes to cook. It's not my favorite mug cake, but it worked for a quick breakfast treat.

It was okay. A little rubbery, I think. But tasty. I'd like to play around with the recipie. I have a large mug so I doubled and added walnuts that went great with the cinnamon! Tasty flavors, now to iron out the texture.

It's a little eggy/heavy instead of light and fluffy, but will do in a pinch.  I measured exactly 2 Tbsp. of  a beaten egg to add to the mug.  Next time I will try 1.5 Tbsp of egg and probably reduce the sour cream to 1.5 tsp too as it tasted a bit like sour cream.

This was tasty! I didn't have baking powder so I used baking soda and also did not have anymore sour cream so that wasn't included. Still not bad.

I really love this idea. I added a couple drops of lemon extract and omitted the topping, replacing it with a sprinkle of powdered sugar. I am surprised at how tasty this was, if a bit chewy. Okay, very chewy, but the taste and the fact that I had a piece of cake to eat five minutes after reading this recipe more than make up for that.

Followed recipe as written; too sweet and a bit rubbery.  Not crazy about the flavor; cinnamon too overpowering.

The best mug cake recipe I have tried.  Only sub was to use yogurt instead of sour cream and did not have vanilla extract so left out.  Just the right amount for a sweet treat.  Delicious!

Not bad. It's a mug cake, so not as good as the real thing, but close enough. I have made it a few times. I added cinnamon and nutmeg, and recently tried adding a few chocolate chips to the batter and liked it overall. I nixed the topping altogether and instead made a quick cream cheese frosting to put on top. Would have been good with or without the frosting. Over cooking made it dry. Does have a wet appearance even if it is done, so use the toothpick method. Can eat straight out of mug or plate it for a different look. Great when you are the only cake lover in the house!

Super rubbery...and yet dry at the same time, incredibly bland, and all in all unsatisfying.

I doubled the recipe and put it in a medium bowl.  Very very good - and easy.  Definitely satisfied my craving for a coffee cake - and I don't have to worry about eating an entire coffee cake.

I've made this recipe several times and can conclude that is better with sour cream, but if you don't have that on hand cream cheese works great or use a whole egg and a splash of milk. This recipe could also be improved upon by using 2 tbsp. butter instead of 1. My personal favorite part of this recipe is by far the topping and I have found that it is delicious on toast just use margarine instead of butter and 2 tbsp. instead of 1.

It was just ok for us.....a lil time consuming for something that was just alright. I do like the mug concept though and have made other similar recipes that were very good. I did like the crumb topping...I just thought the cake was a bit too "eggy" tasting for me. But thanks for a creative recipe.

Did this one. I made it with chocolate but for some reason (though it could pretty well) was a little bit more on the rubbery side. Oh well. I will try this again since I often get random cravings for cake.

Yum!  I used whole wheat flour, cut back on a little of the white sugar, and added a few dashes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves to the cake part.  Definitely rely on a toothpick, because if you have a clear mug, it still looks a little wet through the side even when it's not.  I think I'll try it with cocoa next time.
