A wonderful salad. I didn't do the pepper (cuz I was really short on time), and substituted for a few ingredients (like mushrooms), but that's the beauty of this colorful dish - you can add different things. I also put in a bit of seed and dried fruit mix. A keeper!

Spring Delight Salad Haiku: "It IS delightful. Vibrant colors and textures. But still needs some crunch." I loved the easy elegance of this salad, and the only change that I made was to swap raspberry vinaigrette for balsamic vinaigrette. Otherwise, stayed true to the recipe and definitely enjoyed it, but I think next go-around, I'll need to add something w/ a little bite to it, like red onion, toasted walnuts, or cucumbers. But I have to say that I love any recipe that has alfalfa sprouts in it!

Great recipe.  Instead of using plastic wrap, I used a brown paper bag.  Let the pepper "sweat" in the bag for 10-15 minutes and the skin will peel right off.

I used an organic spring mix for this salad instead of romaine lettuce and sliced baby bella mushrooms. I made my own italian balsamic dressing to toss with this instead of raspberry vinaigrette (my family dosen't care for sweet dressings). I just LOVED the combination of vegetables in this salad--roasting the bell pepper was a stroke of genius. I think next time, I'll make two large roasted bell peppers for this salad instead of one.

I loosely followed the recipe for ease and to suit my tastes.  I took the easy way out and didn't roast the peppers and I'm sure the salad would have been better if I had.  I am neither a fan of alfalfa sprouts nor raspberry vinaigrette.  That said, I omitted the sprouts and used a homemade lemon vinaigrette instead. This was light, colorful and refreshing; aptly named.

I made a version of this recipe with what I had on hand and needed to use.  I used yellow and orange bell peppers along with mixed greens and red leaf lettuce.  I didn’t have time to roast the peppers, but just chopped them and threw them in.  They added a nice crispy crunch to this salad, which I thought was a plus.  I used grape tomatoes and skipped the alfalfa sprouts because I didn’t have any.  I made a small batch of Our Favorite Balsamic Vinaigrette, also from this site, for the raspberry vinaigrette.  This had a nice mix of flavors and was very colorful!  I would make it again!

Great salad, easily adaptable to what you have on hand and your own personal preferences. I like a good bite to my salad so I added red onion and I don't like mushrooms so I omitted them, but otherwise kept it as written. Good stuff, thanks for sharing!

I love the mixture of greens but did not roast the red pepper, may try that next time.  The Raspberry vinaigrette was nice change.
