A great variation on the traditional egg salad! I made indian food last night and I was trying to find a way to use some of the spices I had purchased... this recipe fit the bill! I reccommend serving this on toasted pita bread with a sour cream spread. I may not make this often, but it's a lot of fun trying different things! I left out the jalapeno and added a little chili powder for spice.

I really liked this minus the cilantro. I love egg salad and this was just a little something different with a bit of spice.

If you're looking for a taste variation of egg salad, this is a good recipe to try.   I couldn't completely depart from the "traditional" egg salad sandwich though, as I served this on fresh bread with lettuce and mayo.  I did really like the fact that the onions were sauteed a bit, as I don't care for raw onion in egg salad.

Sorry but this was awful. There are way too many conflicting flavors. Husband wouldn't touch it, and he'll eat anything. Thanks anyway.

I really wanted to love this because I love Indian food and sandwiches but as another reviewer said It was missing something.  I left out the jalapenos (personal preference) but added some red pepper flakes instead. I added yogurt and mustard because I felt it needed some tang to balance the flavors.

This is excellent!! I had it in a pitta bread for lunch today and loved it.  Wouldn't change a thing. Thank you so much for giving me a new favourite sandwich filling :-)

Good, but I think I would use less jalepeno next time. It was a little much and tended to overpower the other flavors.

A nice variation on egg salad, but it's missing something...  We served in pita pockets with roasted red pepper hummus spread, which really helped out.

i made this today as an emergency dish after a mis-hap with some already cooked eggs.  the slow warming spices are very nice; however, i did not like that there was no binder.  that being said, i used a little mayo to bind.  i would have used plain yougurt but didn't have any on hand.  will serve with some naan.
