I have made this recipe twice, and I love it.  There are several things I did the second time around that made it better (all gathered from other reviewers)

1. I used about 1 lb of fresh spinach and blended the spinach mixture.
2. Used 2 cups milk & 1 cup heavy cream
3. Used fresh onion and garlic
4. Added a dash of Celery Salt, Cayanne Pepper, nutmeg, and thyme
5. Mixed in about 1/4 cup Parmasean Cheese.

Most of these ideas came from other reviews.  Combining them all together makes a really good soup (and not bland at all).

Following the recipe as is I would only rate this 3 out of 5 stars.  Do the following and its definately a 5 star recipe.  I thought it was too plain.  Take out the water and bouilloon; use chicken broth instead (better & fuller flavor) Use 2 cups of half & half and 1 cup of milk.  Substitute 1/4 cup fresh minced onion instead of dried. Add 2 cup of shredded swiss cheese. 1. Saute onion in butter in large saucepan until onion is soft. 2. Add 1/4 c flour, wisk with butter and onion until well mixed.  Pour in chicken broth, wisking rapidly to ensure everything mixes well. 3. Add spinach.  Bring to a boil. 4. Add cream & milk. 5. Add cheese, stirring constantly until all cheese is melted. 6. Season to taste.  (I also added two drops of roasted habinaro sauce which has a really nice flavor without making it spicy.  I hate black pepper so I use other peppers)  This soup was very filling and delicious.

OMG, this is so good. I have made this soup sooo many times! I've use just broccoli; 1/2 broccoli 1/2 spinach; combo of broccoli and cauliflower; cauliflower, broccoli and spinach. I have used chopped, whole and fresh spinach and had good results each time. I don't really measure, it's just what I have on hand. Never fails and always comes out good. Usually when I add broccoli to the spinach or cauliflower it just tastes like cream of broccoli. Also, I usually put 1/2 cup frozen chopped onions in with the veggies and don't use the minced onions at the end. I also use a hand blender and make the soup nice and creamy. It's such a quick and easy soup. I always have the stuff on hand so I can whip it up in a moments notice.

This is delicious, and the perfect compliment is shredded parmesan cheese. It's great with toasted garlic bread. Like others I caramelized red onion in the butter, added a few red pepper flakes, and used chicken stock instead of the water and boullion. Also I threw the cooked spinach and broth and a cup of the cold milk in the blender (be careful after you initially start the blender with the lid on as you need to allow the steam to escape or the blender might explode).

Excellent soup. I used half and half (in place of milk), veg. "chicken" boullion, fresh spinach, and also threw in some brocoli. Put half the mixture in the blender for variation of texture. I was able to get my kids  to eat their spinach & brocoli! Can't wait to make it again...thanks!

oh Lordie!! i was just surfing around ALLRECIPES for spinach recipes and encountered this. i had some frozen cut-leaf spinach and a ton of milk that was gonna go bad in 2 days so i said, "why not? it got good ratings". so i busted out all the ingredients. and mind you, the milk i had was the 1% milk fat, lowfat milk so i was expecting it to taste mediocre since it wasn't heavy cream or anything. but to my surprise it was wonderful!! i was even hesitant since it used water and chicken bouillon but the taste was so good, even better than the can! the one thing that i changed was that i used 2 chicken bouillon and 1 veggie bouillion and added a little water (2 TB) and cornstarch (1 TB) to make it even thicker. (i love thick soup). i also used frozen cut leaf spinach since i didn't have the whole chopped frozen spinach but i liked it even better because the spinach was more tender. so overall this recipe gets 5 kick- stars!!

Yummmmmmy!  I used fresh spinach and also sauted a little onion and mushrooms.  Used 1% milk and it thickened just fine.  Also added 3/4 tsp. mild curry powder, 1 & 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/4 white pepper.  Great recipe!!!  Thanks!

Excellent recipe! I don't know what else to say but it was fast, easy, and so delicious! THANKS!

UPDATE: I wanted to say here it is more then 5 years after I rated this the 1st time, and I still make this soup and people still LOVE it! I use fresh onions and garlic in it and its just such a great soup! Oddly, wonderful over pasta!!! Yes, you read that right, its a super light sauce for pasta and with a bit of Pecorino Romano or Parmesan Cheese, its a quick perfect dish!

We absolutely love this recipe!  We've made it many times, and it turns out great every time.  The only thing we do different, is to put the spinach/bouillon/water mixture into the food processor after it has cooked, until smooth and pretty green.  We like the looks a little better, and then you don't have strings of spinach hanging over your spoon while eating.  :)  Great recipe and perfect with a loaf of fresh french bread or cornbread!

A great recipe. I used a 10 oz. package of frozen spinach and substituted fat-free creamer, but otherwise stuck to the recipe, and the flavor was just marvellous. Oh yes, and I used about four cloves of garlic, too. This made great leftovers the next day.

I doubled the recipe and followed some of the suggestions from the other reviewers. I sauteed the onion and garlic briefly. I substituted soy milk for regular milk and vegetarian bouillon for chicken. The soup came out great. I will definitely make this again.

This was fabulous!!  I used a 10 oz. bag of fresh spinach that I roughly chopped into small spoon size cuts.  I used 2 c 2% milk and 1 c heavy cream, fresh sauteed onion (nearly caramelized)  and garlic in olive oil, cayenne, nutmeg, thyme, S/P & Parmesan cheese.  I did not puree.  This made an absolutely WONDERFUL soup that both I and my 18 month old enjoyed!  She gobbled it up...spinach pieces and all!

I have a collection of over 30 recipies that I make regularly from allrecipies and this is the one I make most often. Not only is it very good, it stores well and can be used as a soup or as a pasta sauce. I use fresh spinach and toss in sauted onion, mushrooms and fresh green onion. Basil, garlic and onion powder as seasoning. The is the only way I'll eat spinach, and even my fussy (and total carnivore) boyfriend went back for seconds!

This is an easy, healthy soup. Following the reviews of others, I substituted chicken broth for the water & bouillon cubes, and sauteed chopped onions for the dried minced onions.  I used 1% milk, which convinced the health addicts in my family to try it despite "cream" in the recipe title.  The soup was a bit bland, so I added garlic  powder, a pinch of nutmeg, and topped it with shredded Parmesan cheese and cilantro before serving.  It has a different, but addicting taste.  You can just feel all the healthful nutrients filling your body with each sip! I served it with cantaloupe slices and red seedless grapes.  Pretty, tasty and nutritious!

This was a really good soup.  I changed the procedure, though, since I didn't like the idea of using 2 pots (means there's 2 pots to clean), so I just used 1 pot.  I melted margarine and added flour, then added milk a little at a time,stirring to blend.  I added water and then some undiluted chicken concentrate and the dried onion.  I used pre-washed baby spinach instead of frozen spinach and seasoned with salt and pepper.  Then I pureed the mixture using my hand held blender and produced a wonderfully nutritious soup.

This was quick and very easy! I used fresh spinich and added a whole onion, 2 cloves of garlic and about 4 tbs of LIME juice - it really made the soup taste great! I forgot to chop the spinich beforehand, so I blended it in a blender, which was great too. Serve with a dallop of sour cream or a cube of cream cheese.

This was sooo GOOD! Coming from a person who doesn't like spinach soup, I LOVED THIS!!! I had to double the recipe, and the only thing I did differently was 1. Use fresh spinach that I chopped ( a whole box. It cooks down nicely.) 2. I did not put anything in the blender. The color was gorgeous. 3. I took the advice of other reviewers an added 1/4 tsp. thyme, and celery seed. l also added a pinch of nutmeg. 4. I used fresh garlic and onion. 5. I used 1 c. of heavy whipping cream. This was so good with garlic bread. Overall, a  wonderful meal, that I will be and again this winter! :)

I made some adjustments to the recipe and it is one of the best soups I have ever had- and quite healthy too. I used vegetable broth cubes because I am vegetarian and added it to the spinach with just a little water because spinach boils down so much. It looked like a little so I added some frozen broccoli too. Then I sauteed onion and garlic until it was nearly translucent. I blended both of those together in the blender until it was like a pesto. Then I did the dairy mixture with skim milk and a little cream, added spices of: curry, marquen (like red pepper), black pepper and nutmeg. It is necessary for the soup to have a little kick! I mixed the dairy and spinach mixtures together on the heat and voila! Parmesan would make it perfect, but I didn't have any of it in the house... sooooo good and you would never know how healthy it was!

Wow this soup is awesome! I made some changes based on other reviews... First I put 1.5 cups of water and 2 veggie bullion cubes in the micro for 5 mins. In the meantime, I melted about a tbs. of butter on the stove, and sauteed half a red onion and 2 garlic cloves, I had to add about a tbs. of water also. Then I added the 1/4cup flour (only had whole wheat, worked fine). It got kind of crumbly but worked fine. When the water and bullion was almost boiling in the micro, I took it out and poured it into the blender with about half a big bag of fresh spinach and blended that up. I wisked in the 3 cups (skim) milk into the pot with the onion/garlic/flour, added fresh gr. pepper, a little salt (the bullion is salty enough)and a couple dashes of nutmeg and paprika. Turned it up high to boil and thicken for a couple minutes, wisking constantly. Then poured in the spinach mixture and that was it. So easy, fast, and good! Wasn't thick, like a creamy soup, but still excellent! Great way to get rid of the extra spinach before it goes bad.

This soup was absolutely DELICIOUS!! AND EASY!! I made this as a starter for dinner tonight and everyone enjoyed it SOOO much!! My husband said, "DO NOT change a thing! It's PERFECT!" The kids LOVED it! I made this with frozen chopped broccoli (cream of broccoli is my favorite), I only used 2 bouillons but would have been great still with just 1-1/2 and I also used 2 cups milk and 1 cup heavy cream as other reviewers suggested. Came out thick and creamy and full of flavor! Will make this one again and again and will try lots of different veggies!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe Joyce!  :)

Quick & easy. This took less than 10 minutes from start to finish. This is the perfect soup to make for someone that is scared of making soup, doesn't like to chop veggies, the beginner to the expert.

I was excited to find this recipe with spinach. Once I started, I realized I had about a third of what the recipe called for. So I improvised by adding frozen broccoli and peas to round out the green. Once heated and added to the roux/milk mix, I used my immersion blender to puree the soup. 

Outstanding, thick flavor. Even forgetting to add the salt and pepper, I had three bowls of it. I can't think of any improvements needed to this recipe! Well done!

As written it was too bland.  However after making it using the tips from KOliveras comment it was excellent.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks for the base recipe.  It was a good way to get rid of some frozen spinach in the freezer.

i didn't expect to like this as much as i did.  i rated it four stars because as written it seemed a bit bland to me but w/a just a few tweaks it's delicious.  I added some garlic powder and sprinkled parmesan cheese into it.  just these 2 additions send it over the moon!

Just finished making this for the third time and it is still delicious.  Followed other suggestions and sauteed almost a chopped onion and 4 cloves of minced garlic with the butter.  Then added the flour and whisked.  Used 3 cups of chicken broth, 2 cups of 1% milk and 1 cup of heavy cream.  Pureed half the batch of soup.  Serve with French Baguettes from this site.

This was very easy to make and tasted delicious. Squeezed some lemon into it at the table, which added a nice tang. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

Excellent, relatively easy.I had a mega-bag of fresh baby spinach from the wholesale store and so I cooked that in chicken broth (instead of boullion). I ran it thru the blender for a few seconds for a less leafy consistency. Also added a bit of grated onion and garlic to the butter, as others suggested. Will make again, delicious garnished with croutons and shredded cheese.

This soup is so good. I put tomatoes in it with the spinach. SOO GOOD. I do use whole milk and extra butter as well but I'm sure it would be fine without it.

This was a great recipe for someone who had never made a "cream of..." anything soup. I don't really measure when I make most things, but this recipe was a good guideline, and the soup turned out pretty yummy.

Good flavor, but not quite as thick and creamy as I was looking for.  Doubled the spinach, used fresh, added a dash of red pepper and nutmeg.

This is SUCH a great soup, I love it and make it often!! It's so easy to make and is much more lowfat than most other cream soups!! I even use low or nonfat milk as well as lowfat butter to make it even healthier!!
Thanks for the great recipe!!

This recipe is wonderful.  I made the Broccoli version on Christmas Eve and my mom and I just loved it.  Try it with some hot fresh yeast rolls for a real treat on a cold day.  I plan to use this recipe many times more.

I had a BIG Costco bag of fresh spinach which I wanted to make a dent in so I chopped up about a pound or so. I did this in one pot. I  sauteed 1/2 an onion in some EVOO until it began to brown & added 1 clove garlic & a dash of red pepper flakes,added butter to pot and about 3 T flour and cooked for about 2-3 minutes. Added 1 can chicken broth, spinach & cut back to 2 cups 1/2 n 1/2 so it would be thicker.  Let is simmer a few minutes until the spinach was soft then went into pot with my immersion blender but left some of the texture...delish.

Fantastic soup!  I used fresh spinach from the Farmer's Market and it was delicious!  All I did was boil the spinach until tender and blended in the blender for 30 seconds.  It gave it a nice deep green look and I didn't even have to season it!

This was very good.  I made half the recipe using chicken broth instead of water and bouillon, and fresh, roughly chopped spinach rather than frozen.   I used 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup heavy cream.  I also used fresh onion.  This was very good and I wouldn't hesitate to make it again.  But next time I would use my emersion blender to slightly puree the soup making the spinach pieces even smaller.  My spinach, although not that large, did tend to stick to the spoon.  I think blending it a little would remedy that.

Excellent!  Made it exactly as written.  Used whole milk.  Wow, a great tasting recipe as is and also a great cream soup base recipe for adding all kinds of vegetables, cheese, meat, etc.  Will definitely be making this again.

Just made this in about 20 minutes.  Fast, easy and delicious.  I used a can of chicken broth and mixed in a half onion chopped and the garlic to cook with the spinach.  I then put that mixture in the blender to make it smooth.  I used 3 cups of skim milk and it turned out very creamy, whisking the butter, flour and milk until almost boiling, but not scalding the milk. Then I poured the blended spinach mixture into the butter, flour, milk mixture, turned off the heat, added some cayenne and celery salt.  Tastes great!

This was very good. I used 2 cups skim & 1 cup 2%. I did find that I needed to add more seasonings. I added minced garlic and a generous heaping of crushed red pepper, but I do find that I do that to most creamy soups. Thanks for the recipe! Update 2/15/16: Doubled it & made it again, found it way too "spinachy" this time (used 20 oz frozen brick spinach). I feel like the key was to add lemon juice when serving (in addition to the garlic and red pepper added previously) or to use buttermilk which is a trick I got from a creamy broccoli soup recipe on this site.

i'm glad i found a recipe for cream of spinach soup that didn't call for half and half...that stuff packs a lot of calories! my only comment is that, because the soup is cooked separately, don't season the cream too much. the chicken stock is already plenty seasoned, so it's easy to overseason and make the soup too salty once the two seconds are combined.

This was ridiculously good!!!!  Made it for lunch and my 2 year old had 3 servings.  Very easy.  I did put the spinach mixture in the blender for just a second (which made the soup a darker green) and added a little garlic powder and chicken broth.  Very forgiving recipe, as I didn't measure a thing.  Thanks!  It's a keeper!

This is so easy and excellent.  The only thing I did differently was add real onion.

This soup is delicious and so easy to make.  My mother-in law makes a great cream of spinach soup but I would have to say that this one is even better (even my husband says so, but we won't tell my mother in law.)  I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen and sauteed red onion and garlic with the butter, before adding the flour.  Will def make again!

This soup was nice and easy but my husband didn't think it was thick enough.  On reading the other reviews, I think this could have been because I used semi-skimmed milk but that's all we ever have in the house, so next time I may add more flour to make it thicker.

The other spinach soup I rated was the wrong one.  This is the good one.  Substituted a little finely minced onion for the dried.  Grated a little nutmeg into it and used chicken broth instead of water & bouillon.  This was EXCELLENT!!!!

I normally make Creamy Spinach Soup on this site but decided to change off.  Even though the ingredients in both are ALMOST identical we much prefer Creamy Spinach Soup - it had more flavor - maybe because it uses real onions and uses half and half instead of milk.  I did use 2 cups of milk in this one and 1 cup of heavy cream but it just wasn't quite as good as Creamy Spinach Soup. Only 8 people have reviewed that soup but 8 out of 8 gave it a 5. So if you are health conscious use this one - for a richer version use the other!!!  Thanks submitter.

A really easy, tasty soup.  The only thing for me was that personally, there was too much butter. Next time, maybe I'll just add half the amount. Thanks for the great recipe though! I loved it!

good base.  Read the other reviews, note additional ingredient ideas that you like/happen to have in the cabinet, and go from there.  I subbed buttermilk for milk with good results.  Also, sauteed onion and garlic are good additions.

Very fast and very simple and tasty! Taste alone, I'd give it a four, but all considered, it's a five star recipe. I used a 6 oz bag of fresh spinach and blended the spinach/water/bullion mixture in a blender before adding it to the milk.  It's a veggie dish that my husband, 3 year-old and I all like.  Definitely a keeper!

Never heard of Cream of Spinach Soup til we had it in a Deli awhile back. Came to ALL RECIPES and sure enough, there was the recipe.. Thanks Joyce, this is one of the best cream soups I have ever had. It is perfect, but a bit of cheese on top was good too. Have made it twice in a couple weeks. My husband loves it too.. I am very very impressed with how something so simple can be so good!!!

Hmm..well it wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. However, after trying it and looking at others reviews I tried what "Razhe" another reviewer had suggested by using a bit of red pepper and onions sauteed. That was the ticket, it really brought this recipe home. I give Joyce 4 stars but Razhe 5 stars for perfecting it.

Qick, easy, and satisfying. I used fresh spinach, some green onions and about 1/4 of a yellow onion. Ran through food processor. Cooked that mixture in the water/chicken bouillion, plus a dash of garlic (minced). In roux, I used 2 1/2 cups of 1% milk plus 1/2 cup of heavy cream. Added a good amount of nutmeg. Once combined I added a dash of lime juice. Served with a dollop of sour cream. Thanks!

A true hit. . . and I don't even really like spinach! I did use a cup of heavy cream and a cup of milk instead of 2 cups of milk. Soooo much better with the sweetness and heartiness heavy cream provides. Serve with hot French bread - couldn't be any better!

I *loved* this soup!  I would have eaten it all in one sitting, but it's very filling.  I used 2% milk and didn't have any problems getting it thick enough.

A great way to get your veggies!  I used chicken broth instead of water and bouillon, a 10oz bag of fresh spinach leaves instead of frozen, half of a small/medium yellow onion instead of dried onion, and cornstarch instead of flour, to make it gluten-free.  I cooked the spinach whole, but I used a submersion blender to chop up the spinach and onions just before serving.  It was delicious!

First, my result looked nothing like the picture, which is very green and almost looks like a puree! Mine is creamy looking with spinach green mottled throughout! I used the recipe with these changes and additions (based somewhat on reviews).  I did use bouillon cubes, but added a little garlic powder.  I cooked 2 small boxes (10 oz ?) of chopped frozen spinach, and used slightly more than one for the recipe, and all the water, saving back about a drained cup for later use (omelettes perhaps).  I sauteed about two TBL of finely minced Vidalia onion in the butter along with just a tad of minced garlic (from a jar).  I forgot I had the minced garlic and had already added garlic powder, so I did not want to overdo it.  I used only 2 1/2 cups of milk and whisked in 1/2 block (4 oz) of yogurt cream cheese.  I did this because I had it on hand, but it was expiring soon, and I thought it might add some depth.  It took a while to get the cream cheese whisked in.  The results, I thought, were fantastic! The best thing is it has none of those "additives" you see in canned cream soups.  I'm glad I did not double the recipe though, as this makes a lot of soup for one person.

WOW. This delicious soup saved me on a night when I thought my pregnancy-related nausea was going to prevent me from eating ANYTHING. I found this gem searching for spinach recipes because that was the only thing that sounded remotely appetizing. Boiled my 5-oz box of fresh spinach in a can of vegetable broth with some fresh diced onion, fresh garlic, and a handful of green peas and broccoli. Blended that until very smooth and stirred it into the 1-cup milk, 1-cup half and half cream base. Incredibly smooth, rich, and satisfying. I seasoned mine with s&p, FRESH basil, and a healthy dash of nutmeg. In my opinion, the fresh basil and nutmeg are a MUST.

Pretty good, basic recipe.  To give it more depth, I sauteed 1 TBSP of minced garlic in with the butter and added 1 TBSP of soy sauce just before serving.  I also thickened it more with potato flakes...that is just a personal preference as I like thicker cream soups.  I will make this again, and try it with other frozen vegetables, as suggested.

Good recipe. To make more lowfat I used skim milk and less butter and1/8 cup flour. Also used a handful of brussel sprouts. Put the spinach and sprouts in the blender when they were tender and kinda pureed them.Good to  see that it didnt have heavy creams in this  recipe. My sweet diabetic hubby loved this recipe.

This is delicious! Even my husband loved it. The first time I made it was with asparagus. I found that it was a little to thick for me. So, today I made it again with spinach and added a little more water and another boullion cube and it was so good. The flavor is delicious!!!

This soup was great!  I minced about 1/8 cup of onions and one clove of garlic in the butter, then added the flour.  After adding spinach, I added a little salt, pepper, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and a pinch of paprika.  I used 2 cups of fat free half and half and 1 cup of skim milk.  I did need to add a little more flour to thicken it up a bit.

I liked this but would probaby enjoy it more using fresh spinach.  I would also do more than heat it through as I prefer a thickened "cream" but I will make this often, even if only for adults.

I thought this recipe as is was a little bland. So I spiced it up a bit with dried basil and thyme. I also added sauteed onions, celery and garlic as well as some grated carrots. I hand blended the soup and topped with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. It turned out very good!

Decent soup... I like that you can adjust the recipe to include different veggies. I blended it with my immersion blender to make it more creamy and less leafy. If I make it again, I'll try some of the suggested upgrades like parmesan or swiss cheese. I put a bit of white rice in there to make it more filling.

I didn't have broth or bulllion so I boiled a celery stalk, half of a bell pepper, garlic cloves and salt with the spinach.  Then I grated 1/2 of an onion and sauteed it with the butter before adding the flour.  I blended half of the celery stalk with the spinach for extra flavor, discarding the bell pepper.  Then some thyme, parsley and salt.  Pretty tasty recipe.

I've made spinach soup from fresh spinach since I saw a recipe on the back of the bag of fresh spinach back in the 90's. That soup was awesome. This recipe is very similar except for the frozen spinach and lack of parmesan cheese. I've tried to copy that recipe since because I figured it would be included on the next bag of spinach I bought, I didn't cut out the recipe. But not so lucky. I know that nutmeg is in the recipe just not how much. I see some people have altered the recipe to include the nutmeg though. Try adding about 3/4 cup or so of parmesan cheese into the soup...you will love it. I do anyway. I've even substituted part mozzarella and part parmesan. Today I used heavy cream because it would get old otherwise.

I made a few changes, and in the end didn't like it so much until I added sour cream and then thought it was tasted good to my liking.

Following the other reviews advice of using cream, cayenne, celery salt, garlic powder, nutmeg, thyme and fresh onion I used my immersion blender then served this up to my husband.  The look on his face when served green soup was hilarious.  But....He loved it.  Thanks for a great core recipe and great "tweaks" by the other chefs.

this is a great starter recipe. i've used this recipe as a base for other soups. i've used this to make broccoli soup and even a seafood soup. when i make it with spinach i think it looks nicer with fresh spinach, the fresh spinach has a nice bright green color. it tastes pretty much the same with frozen spinach but it's more of a dark dull green.

I made the soup with a few changes recommended by other users and a few of my own.  I substituted chicken broth for water and bouillon.  I used 1 lb. fresh spinach, which I ran through a food processor before cooking.  I included 1 leaf of fresh basil with the spinach.  I added a pinch of cayanne, a pinch of dill, and the juice of 1 lemon prior to adding the roux.  The lemon was really great, next time I will juice 2.  I also sprinkled fresh Parmesan on top just before serving.  I will definitely make this again :)

This was excellent..I doubled it and used fresh spinach. I also sauteed chopped onions, carrots and 2 cloves of garlic in olive oil before adding the chicken broth. Also followed other reviewers and added, thyme, nutmeg, 1/4 cup parm cheese and cayenne pepper. I had alot of half & half to use up so used mostly that instead of milk...not the healthiest I suppose but yummy!

The only reason I'm not giving this 5-stars is because I did follow other reviewers' suggestions to add cayenne, nutmeg, garlic, fresh onion instead of powder, and parmesan. This recipe is very versatile, I'm sure you could do a lot with it. I even ran out of skim milk (I only got 2 1/4 of the 3 cups needed) and it still came out fine. Yum!!!

This soup was sooo good! I've never been a fan of cooked spinach in any form, but my husband made this and it was delicious. Even our 4 year old daughter liked it! We added about 2 medium sized shredded carrots to the spinach and only used about 2 cups of milk. Thanks for the great recipe!

The best Cream of Spinach soup that I have ever had.  I couldn't believe how delicious such an easy recipe was.  I used half and half instead of milk and sauteed minced garlic in the butter.  I also used fresh spinach and used an immersion blender right in the pot.  I finished it off with parmesan cheese.  The only thing I would do differently next time is use more spinach.  Other than that, it was perfect.

I am a "semi"-vegetarian, meaning I try to avoid eating meat most of the time. My husband, a carnivore, strongly believes that this soup needs chunks of chicken. I hate to say this, but: I agree. That said, this soup was VERY good, and I can see how it would make a great pasta sauce too, (as commented by other reviewers). Next time, I will save some leftover rotisserie chicken to throw in.

I liked this recipe.  I only made it once, but it seemed a little too soupy.  I decided next time I'll probably use half and half suggested by other reviews.

Excellent soup!  Nobody in my family is a big spinach lover, but this was a true hit.  Even my 16-month old loved this one!  I cut down on butter and only used 1.5 tablespoons.

I decided to have a dinner party for my sister and aunt birthday, and the guests thought the soup was absolutely divine.  I did take the advise of several other reviewers and added green onions, garlic to the butter, and used broccoli instead of 
spinach.  I also added carnation milk and heavy cream in addition to the regular milk.  It was great, although, a little lumpy.  Next time, I will place the mixture into the food processor to smooth out prior to serving.  Thanks, for a great recipe!!!

Great but made changes.  I used 1/2 onion sauteed with 3 garlic cloves.  I used ckn broth instead of the ckn cubes and water.  I also used a 9 oz bag of fresh spinach.  Yum.  I food processed the spinach mixture, but left the onions in chopped form.  I will make again.

My husband loved it.  I didn't have any minced onion, but used onion powder instead.  I minced 2 small garlic cloves and sauteed it with the butter before adding the flour.  It adds a wonderful aroma to the soup.  It was delicious.  Would definitely make it again!

Simple and delicious. Very easy to make and it's nice that one can substitute vegetables for variety. My family loves it when I prepare this. It's very comforting to eat on a cold day.

A very good and versatile recipe.  Even my husband and 2 year old like this one!  I have made it with broccoli and corn (added cumin with the corn) and it was great! I followed some of the recommendations and added Cheyenne pepper and nutmeg.

If I could give this soup 6 stars, I would - and that's the first time I've ever felt that way! (I'm usually stingy about giving five...) The soup came out thick, creamy, and delicious. I didn't have any problem with it thickening, even though I used 1% milk. It was way better than I expected - it's a bit expensive for me to make (spinach costs a bunch where I live) but it's worth it!

WOW. I just finished making this soup, and it tastes way better than I thought it would. Who knew so few ingredients could taste so good! I along with most of the others put a few piches of nutmeg, and I also put a pinch of cayenne pepper just to give it a little kick. I will definately be making this one again and again. Thanks for sharing Joyce :)

Excellent and easy!  I would not reccomend using skim milk - it was too watery.  I had to add cornstarch to thicken.

I used fat-free milk, which makes it much healthier.  I also added potatoes, baby corrot (for colors) and some nutmeg. It turned out great. If you want the soup to be thicker, just add more flour or some corn starch.

Loved this soup....I added one ingredient that sent it over-the-top...4 or 5 quick shakes of ground nutmeg, plus lots of freshly ground pepper.  Trust me, you'll love it with the nutmeg addition.

I cook for 6 people, and they all said it was delicious!  I really loved it.  I scaled the recipe to make 12 servings and after 20 minutes, it still wasn't thickening, so I did have to add more flour.  Another 20 minutes and it was ready.  I also didn't stir it constantly, I had too much else to doI had a time constraint.  It turned out wonderful anyhow.  I'm definitely making this again.

I absolutely can't stand frozen spinach... I'd rather eat most anything else!  However, this sounded like a nice second course for dinner to impress a girlfriend, so I thought I'd try it.  It was great!  As recommended, I used 2 cups milk and 1 cup heavy cream.  I also used slightly less spinach.  Amazing!

This soup was incredible! Not only was it easy to make with ingredients you have in your kitchen and pantry, but it was delicious as well. It seems it would be a good cream base for any vegetable soup. This will definately be a staple in our house.

Very easy to make and very tastey. The whole family just loved it. My little sister who normally doesn't eat anything that's green gobbled this soup up. I suggest doubling the recipe because everybody always wants seconds!

I made this soup on Ash Wednesday for something different on our meatless day.  WOW!  Before we got up from the table we were planning on making more.  My Mom even asked me to make some and freeze it for her to have on hand.  Thank you so much for a wonderful and easy recipe.

Wish I had a picture, it looked very elegant.

I realized too late that I was out of chicken bouillon so I subbed beef, only 2 cubes.  Turned out great!  Added some cayenne and fresh garlic and used fresh onion for the minced, then blended everything.

I used whipping cream instead of milk and I feel that it really increased the sweetness. I also added rainbow chard to the spinach.

Specially when you can’t eat any leafy green veggies, this is good way to obtain all the folic acids!

I loved this soup and I know my daughter will love it when she tries it too!  I did follow what other reviewers did except I did use over a pound of fresh spinach and whatever I had left of celery in 2 cups of water.  I would use 3 chic bouillon next time but add no salt or 2 chic bouillon cubes and little salt.  The salts from the celery was enough so if yiu decide tonuse celery I would suggest to not use any salt.  I made the rue as other reviewers suggested, with milk and heavy cream  I used 2.5 cups 1% milk and half cup heavy cream.  I sautéed onions and garlic in the butter then a stirred in flour and adding 1 cup at a time of the milk as I consistently whisked.  I added sslt, pepper, cayenne pepper to taste....next time no salt.  I mixed the rue in the spinach and broth aND then blended most of it.  Turned out to be a beautiful color and very flavorful!  This is a keeper of a soup recipe!

it was really yummy!! First  time I tried spinach soup, had no idea it could taste so good. I followed the suggestion in the reviews. I didn't have any chicken broth though, still it tasted really good. Would have loved if there was something to munch in it like maybe sauteed mashroom. 
Will try it again :)

Keep it really thin as it thickens in the fridge. Yes will make it again as it was very nice.

This recipe was just what I was looking for; mild for those who like it that way, and easily spiced up for others. I'll definitely be making this again.

I wouldn't add cream with koliveras suggestions, it's rich enough and at least slightly healthy if you don't.

Four stars as is. I really like the addition of a little cayenne and garlic. Very easy to customize and use what you have though... Have fresh onion, use that. Have fresh spinach, use a lb of that. I used a couple potatoes instead of flour also. Want to make it a meal?... Add mini cheese ravioli or somesuch. A great base to play with. I've even used fresh mixed greens instead of spinach and it tastes great. Simple and great to tweak for what you have.

Excellent, and thanks to other reviewers, I used fresh spinach (more than 10oz), 1/2 tsp curry powder,  minced garlic, 1/2 tsp hot red pepper flakes and fresh onion (about half an onion, minced). I served with some toasted (broiled) bread and butter.

I used fresh spinach, added minced garlic and fresh tarragon from my garden. I also emulsified it to make it nice and creamy. I seriously cannot stop eating this delicious soup!

Steamed frozen broccoli in chicken broth. Sautéed garlic and shallot in butter. Added red pepper flakes. After softened, wisked in whole wheat pastry flour. Poured in chicken broth with broccoli, 2 1/2 cups almond milk, 1/2 cup organic half and half and 1 can of white kidney beans. Liquified with emulsion blender. Salt and pepper. Topped with freshly grated Parmesan. Delicious! Next time I think I may only emulsify half, add some ham or bacon and use olive oil instead of butter!

yummy soup. I followed the suggestions of the top reviewer and added some more spices. 
Also, will use this recipe for a base for "spinach a la creme" by leaving out the water.

Delicious! Simple and fresh and yummy.  I used fresh onion, sauteed in the butter before adding the flour (I used gluten-free flour), and my own chicken stock with just a little bit of boullion added.  Mmm.

Had a lot of spinach to use up and this was the perfect solution. I did not add as much flour as they asked for so it would be a little more runny and I added some shredder cheddar cheese.

This was amazing!  I used fresh spinach and gave it a whirl in the blender after sauteing it in the butter with the onion (plus some garlic and thyme).  I think I'm ready to win mother of the year too, because my three year old gobbled this down with some Goldfish floating in it.....Shhhh don't tell her there's spinach in it!!!!

Good basic recipe. I added 3 pinches nutmeg and 2 large crushed cloves garlic (for 2lb spinach, doubled the recipe) and this time skipped the roux and just thickened with a cornstarch slurry and some cream. I garnished it with crumbled Havarti cheese and that was a great addition. Because I used Campbell's chicken broth out of the box, I hesitated about salt and we found I should still have added some, but it was all right when we all salted at the table.

Was looking for a recipe to help use up all the spinach I had in the garden.   I first stir fried the spinach in an olive oil/garlic mixture to add a touch of flavor.   Using another suggestion I also blended the ingredients to get a much finer/thicker soup.    The bouillon cubes made it taste too salty so my next attempt will use low sodium chicken broth in place of water (also suggested by someone).  BTW, I also had a lot of spinach stems and heck - blended they turned out just like I used the leaves themselves so if you are a gardener you can use the stems to make the soup also!

Great soup. I used unsweetened soy milk, added a cup of chopped onion and more spinach and cut out the chicken bouillon, since I am a vegan. Next time I'll try it with broccoli.

Even though I made this using very different steps, I used the same ingredients and so am rating this a 5 for taste.  I had fresh spinach to use, so sauteed it briefly in the butter.  Sprinkled the flour on top and mixed well, cooking for a minute or so.  Then added the milk, chicken granules, onion powder, and a little nutmeg. Served the blended soup with a garnish of sour cream.  Tasty.

Beautiful Recipe, I normally cook using 2x the ingredients so a family of four can injoy it and have seconds on hand.   I am a big soup fan and I cannot find anything in resturants that compare to this easy creation.

Great recipe! My fiance normally doesn't like soup, but he loved this. Used fresh garlic and onion and a little cream like the other reviewers suggested.

Awesome on a cold Monday.  Used low fat chicken broth added broccoli, cauliflower and spinach from the garden.  Added to the roux and emulsified but left it pretty chunky.  Love eating local. Thanks for the recipe.

I added garlic, onion, and paprika to the ingredients, but otherwise made the recipe as written.  I thought it had a great flavor, and I love that it was so quick and simple to make.  I'll use this recipe again and again as a base and try different combinations of vegetables and spices in the future.

This was a wonderful way to use the spinach that is past its salad days. Instead of the bouillon and water I used a can of low sodium chicken broth. I also ran the spinach/broth through a food processor for a creamier soup.  And added 1/2 shredded cheddar cheese.

DELICIOUS. I made two changes: I used vegetable bouillion (as I'm a vegetarian) and I accidentally doubled the butter. It was still amazing. I added garlic butter croutons and shredded cheddar cheese to my bowl, which just added to the taste. This is one of the best recipes I've tried making in a while, I'll definitely be making this again. I think next time I'll try pureeing some of the spinach.

I have made this recipe a few times, and each time it comes out excellent.  The only thing I changed is that I use two bouillon cubes instead of three, as well as two tablespoons butter instead of three, because it tends to be very, very rich otherwise.

This was a good base recipe. I had to add a lot of seasoning to bring some flavor to it though. I just followed the other reviews and added sauteed onion, garlic and cayenne pepper. Had trouble thickening it too. Thanks for a good base to work with though!

Good, but not great.  I followed other cooks' suggestions: sauteed onion and garlic, used broth, fresh spinach and half and half; added fresh basil, red pepper and parmesan.  I still feel it needs something to move into the 5 star category.

This is one of my favorites. I follow the advice to cook the flour on low, and to add a little nutmeg and basil. I also put about 2/3 in the blender to get the right consistency. Yum!

I've been making this soup for over a year. I have never found a recipe online better than this one. I usually use 1% milk, but last week I used whole milk YUM YUM YUM!
The only thing I do differently is sautee onions in the butter & add a bit of nutmeg. Every time I finish it, I wish there were more!

I made this last night and it was delicious and very quick to prepare.  I did not add the chicken bouillon as hubbie is a vegetarian.  I added a teaspoon of vegetarian bouillon powder.  I also added 1 potato, a few baby carrots and some dried minced garlic.  I also pureed the soup at the end to make it creamy.  I couldn't believe how fast this recipe came together.  This soup is definitely a keeper!!!  Thanks.

I did try this with broccoli, because my husband isn't a big spinach fan. I was very surprised how easy and delicious it was! I used double broccoli than what the recipe called for (not sure if you'd have to do the same with the spinach)after I boiled the broccoli with the water, I ran it through the blender and added it to the soup. I thought I would have to use more thickener since I added more broccoli and water, but it was perfectly thick. Delicious with shredded cheese mixed in!

Excellent recipe for the basic soup--I used the following and it was very flavorful: fresh spinach, fresh onion, skim milk. Then I added garlic cayenne, basil, seasoned salt and nutmeg. I added in about obout 1/2 cup parmesean in the end. Then I let it simmer for about 25 minutes for the right consistency.

fabulous soup! I used a can of chicken broth and instead of the minced onions, I used a fresh blend of mostly onions, a little bell pepper, and garlic. (known in new orleans as the "holy trinity.") I also used fresh spinach and a combo of fresh broccoli and spinach. Both were fabulous and SO easy.

This soup is great and so easy!  I didn't have chicken bullion so I used a can of chicken stock in place of the water.  Probably not as much flavor, but the soup was still wonderful!  This also allowed me to control the amount of salt.  Thanks, I'll definitely be making this again!

I have prepared this recipe often and have received many compliments from guests.  I like to puree the soup prior to serving for a nicer appearance and texture.   Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe!

Wonderful!  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen (chopped well).  I also put some chopped onion in with the milk for more flavor, and simmered for 30 minutes or so with the spices.  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup was very good.  I made the recipe as written EXCEPT I substituted 1/2 of the regular milk with evaporated milk.  In addition I gave about 4 good shakes of the nutmeg container per some others suggestion and I did enjoy the flavor more with that.  I garnished it with some grated asiago & parmesan cheese which also gave a nice added touch of flavor.  I love asiago!  If I could give it another 1/2 star I probably would.  I'll try it with cauliflower next time. Good recipe Joyce!

I loved this recipe!  I made it with broccoli instead of spinach & it was delicious.  However, I only used 2 1/2 bouillon cubes & it was still salty.  I'd probably only use 1 or get low-salt bouillon next time. If I had potatoes on hand, I may have added some to reduce the salty taste. I made mine with 2% Lactaid milk as I'm lactose intolerant & it was great. I also used a fresh onion instead of dried.  I definetely plan to make this again.  I'd never buy a can of cream of broccoli again!

This was really really good.  I had a friend over for lunch, and there was plenty for she, myself, and my husband.  I served it with crusty French bread.. it's so good dipped in it!  It is VERY filling.  The other really good thing about it is that it's so easy to make with items that you have on hand.  I added a little nutmeg like another reviewer said and it tasted great.  I also used dried onion flakes, which plumped up and added great flavor.  I will definitely make this again, maybe the next time with broccoli.

The taste was okay; I thought it wasn't thick enough. Also, the consistancy was a little off. I probably won't be making this again.

This soup was fabulous and so easy.  I used one chicken bouillon cube and two packets of buillion powder, which cut the sodium down to about 1/3 of the original recipe and it tasted perfect.  I think it would be really salty the other way.  Also, I would suggest heating the butter and flour on low, then turning it up to medium when you add the milk.  Mine nearly burned.  Thanks, Joyce!

This soup is great! I ran out of minced onion, so I used about a teaspoon of onion powder. This soup was so great that my 15 month old son, who is the pickiest eater in the world and only eats cheese, loved it. He ate bite after bite and he refuses baby food of any kind. Great! Thanks

This was delicious!  I used 2 cups of 2% milk and 1 cup of heavy cream (leftover from another recipe).  The soup was thick and creamy.  I used onion powder instead of minced onion.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is now my favorite soup! Luckily I'm the only one in my family who likes spinach, so I get it all! It's great to take for lunch. Next time I make it, I am going to puree the spinach mixture before adding it to the cream mixture.

You may want to thicken the soup a little more with extra flour or starch.  I also added some garlic powder, because we like to use garlic whenever we can.  The soup was very good - great to take to lunch, too!
