Nice! Great for me today with just the first green beans and zucchini!  I even had a young cuke to add for crunchiness.

great option for using fresh farmers market bounty.  I will season a bit more next time, as flavor was a little dull.

LOVED this recipe and 5 stars all the way! If I had to change anything I'd say add more potatoes to make them the true star of the show that they are. This a great alternative to your every day dull potato salad and I am 100% certain your guests will agree. SO fresh and full of life! Make this! You won't regret it!
