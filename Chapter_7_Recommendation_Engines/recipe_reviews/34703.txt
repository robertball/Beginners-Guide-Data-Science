i had high hopes for this recipe because of the sesame oil but the vinegar was overpowering.  i was able to salvage it with more sugar - about 2 tsps. and some sweet pickle relish - about 1 Tbsp.  i think if i ever use this recipe again, i'll put 1 T of rice vinegar instead of the apple cider vinegar - it was just too sour.  i didn't have peanut oil so i used vegetable oil.  mixed it up with some cubed boiled chicken breasts and chopped celery, green onion and diced yellow peppers to make a healthy chicken salad.  it was pretty good!  my teenage daughter thought it tasted like it contained REAL mayonnaise.  i will experiment with other tofu mayonnaise recipes till i find one i really like because i can't continue to eat 90 calories per tablespoon real mayonnaise :o(  thanks AMYJO107 for sharing!

My wife and kids are very particular on what they eat and like. It is complicated to find recipes they all take pleasure in. They really enjoyed the Tofu Mayonnaise and we have replaced regular mayonnaise with this recipe.

Bearing in mind a previous comment, and knowing I prefer a not-so-sharp flavour to my dressing, I made it with only 1 tablespoon of vinegar. It turned out perfect. Next time I shall experiment by adding garlic and herbs as well. A fantastic, creamy recipe that even non-vegans raved about.  I have since made it with the addition of mixed herbs for a lovely summery dressing or dip. This recipe is a keeper!

This was surprisingly amazing! I used Braggs organic apple cider vinegar and olive oil, and I omitted the sesame oil. Yummy!

This recipe is really good, I did use rice vinegar instead because I think using apple cider vinegar would be too sour. Even my hubby who hates tofu loved it and now he asks me to make it all the time instead of using regular mayo. I do like it but I can still tell the difference between regular mayo and this and I wouldn't want to completely replace the regular mayo so that's why I gave it four stars

I added 1/2 tsp of dry chipotle spice, and pinch of cumin and thyme. Sprinkle of basil. Also 1/4 cup milk to help my blender out. I guess I could have used water too. This was delicious! FYI- I liked the amount of apple cider vinegar recommended.

Loved it, I made it almost exactly to the recipe. I had a light sesame oil and than I only had canola oil so I used that to drizzle. It was so  good Iâ€™m considering making my own mayo from now on :)

Wow thank you, we're new to Vegan we were struggling to find a mayo alternative - it's not mayo but a way tastier and healthier alternative.

I really like this.  It's not as flavor neutral as the Just brand I get at the store, but it's quite a bit healthier as far as the fat content and calories.  Plus, I had all the stuff and didn't have to go to the store (not cause I'm lazy today, just sayin').  I like the bite the pepper gives this.  Like others, I left out the sesame oil, because I think that would have skewed the mayo flavor I was looking for.
