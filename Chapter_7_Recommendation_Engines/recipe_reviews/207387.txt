I just made these and the whole family enjoyed them. I had a yam I needed to use so I just steamed it and added a bit of the water and about a tsp of sugar rather than using a can of sweet potatoes. I also added a bit of vanilla. These had a nice flavor to them- you could taste the yam but in a good way. They were quite fluffy but filling and the peach topping was a nice way to finish them off.
