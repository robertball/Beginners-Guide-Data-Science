For the most part I liked this recipe surprisingly a lot! I gave it 4 stars for I made one change: Instead of melting the butter and oil and cooking the bread in it, I left that out and just sprayed a cookie sheet with Pam and decreased the time to 10 minutes on each side. I think next time I will add cinnamon or nutmeg to the egg batter for a little more "kick"

We used the homemade sanfransisco sourdough bread that is also on this site and the french toast was better than any resturant I have ever eaten at delicious!

I used Captain Crunch that was crunched up instead of the Panko Bread Crumbs because that is what I had on hand.  Instead of using the butter and oil, I used cooking spray.  I used 1 1/2 eggs that were egg whites and this turned out just fine.  My cholesterol is a bit high so I felt like this was a needed adjustment.  I reduced the milk down to 3/4 C. as well.  We're only a family of three and just need 4 slices instead of 8 slices.  I also used Lactaid milk since my son is lactose intolerant and this turned out beautifully!  I did add a little pumpkin pie spice for some more flavor.

Delicious! Very crunchy and flavorful. They were a bit greasy though, so I'll cut down on the oil next time or not use it at all. Yum!

I didn't have the bread crumbs that were called for, so I used my white bread crumbs. They worked great, nice and crunchy.

This is good. For a little different flavor, instead of the panko try Cap'n Crunch crumbs.

We loved the crunchiness of this french toast.  No panko at our house so I used Ritz crackers.  It's always my husband's job to squish things into crumbs for my recipes.  :)

I used french baguette in this recipe, wow was it GOOD!!!  I sprinkled cinnamon on one side of the soaked bread before adding the breadcrumbs.  It is quite greasy/oily, I may try using less butter or oil next time.  This is an awesome french toast recipe!

It was absolutely delicious!!  I added 1 tsp cinnamon to the egg mixture, otherwise as written.  This is the best way to serve individual french toasts to a group.  We will make this often!

These were very tasty! I did make some changes, though; I decided to do French toast sticks (which the kids loved) so I cut whole wheat bread into 4 sticks. I used 1 Tbsp. Flaxseed + 3 Tbsp. Water to replace one of the eggs and use1 cup almond milk. I added 2 tsp. Cinnamon and 3\4 tsp. Each nutmeg and ginger. I used homemade whole wheat bread crumbs and left the sugar out of the egg mixture and added some cinnamon sugar to the crumbs. I greased the pan instead of butter and oil. With these changes, they were amazing! The kids loved them dipped in pure maple syrup, honey, or, as I like it, in homemade pear jam. These are a must try!

This was so simple and really delicious! I used my homemade french bread,and I added some cinnamon to the eggs also. I love the crunch that the panko gives to this dish. It's a keeper!

This was awesome I used Italian Scali bread also added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg. One last item was added I sliced a ripe banana and put the banana slices between the bread slices at the point of turning and baking the last 10 minutes. Really good!

Made this today for the first time. Very good! I used what bread and it was still good. I wanted to find a recipe that would use up some panko crumbs.  I froze the leftovers in hopes that they will reheat well in the toaster.

My whole family liked this recipe!  I will probably use less milk the next time I make it. ..I seemed to have a lot left over and organic milk is expensive!   I used coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil,  and also added cinnamon!   YUM!

My fiance loved it! He loves the crunchy texture. I thought it was good, but prefer the traditional french toast more. I prepared the recipe with these few changes - added cinnamon, no butter or oil and cooked it 10 minutes on each side as per previous reviews. Will be making this again for my fiance! Thanks for the fun recipe!

We used captain crunch also, and that part was better I think than the panko would have been. However, even though I lessened the amount of butter called for, there was still too much butter. Next time I'm barely using any.  That was without even putting any on top, too. 

The crispy part of this rocked, and I really liked that about it. Maybe next time I'll try just using the walnut oil by itself in the pan or something, instead of butter. It's healthier anyway. We managed to find some really good french bread for this, too. That was also awesome. Oh and we added pumpkin pie spice. Even better. The 3 stars is for the butter content & making me feel sick. Otherwise it's good.

Hint: This (& all french toast) is way better with cream cheese icing. Highly recommended.

I loved this recipe. I  used cinnamon and raisen    swirl bread and it was  super good. I left the  bread in longer after I turned it over to crisp it more, about 5 min longer. Also next time I will use less butter and oil. This recipe is a keeper.

This was good, but we still like the traditional french toast cooked on top of the stove a little better.  However, if you were serving a large group of folks, being able to bake a couple sheet pans of bread at one time certainly would be convenient.  This is a nice option for french toast and certainly is different (and crunchy, too!).

okay, i was born&raised in south louisiana, so we love greasy foods. this was far from too greasy. i changed nothing except for adding a dash of cinnamon to egg mixture&instead of using just milk, i halved it with buttermilk (only b/c i had buttermilk in the fridge that needed to be used). the bread that i used were hot dog buns leftover from the weekend barbeque. i followed directions to the "t",& i am using this recipe right now, so i decided to rate and review it. i highly advise anyone who likes a crispy french toast to give this recipe a try. tweak it with ur own seasonings (cinnamon, nutmeg, sugar, whatever ur preference), or itll be somewhat bland. other than that, the texture is great and they hold their shape just fine. its a keeper!!

Amazing! A delicious twist on traditional french toast. The Panko makes for a light and crispy french toast with a slight crunch. Wonderful with hot syrup and bacon or sausage on the side. 5 stars all the way!

I used only butter and only half the amount called for in the recipe.  I also used French bread slices .  Loved how the toast is crispy after baking and not soggy as French toast can sometimes be.

This is an excellent recipe. It is definitely buttery, but my husband and I still love them!

This is the best french toast I've ever had. I've always made it on top of the stove, never baked it. I thought I was going to have extra batter, but instead, I ended up with just the right amount. I didn't add bread crumbs. I also didn't use quite as much butter and oil as the recipe called for, which caused the french toast to stick a little. It's very filling. Next time I make it, I'll probably use cinnamon raisin bread.

We thought this was okay, but it wasn't our favorite.  I followed the recipe, but added cinnamon.
