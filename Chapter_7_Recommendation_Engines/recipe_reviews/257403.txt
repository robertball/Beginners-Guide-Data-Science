OMG YUM!  I made this using sea salt & Raw honey as that's what i have on hand. Baked at 350 for 45 minutes ( i was baking another banana bread, different recipe at the same time) I forgot to add the chocolate chips in so i sprinkled some dark chips on top before baking. 
This is seriously one of the best banana breads i have ever eaten! Will be making this again, Thanks!!

My son and I just finished making these, and they were awesome!  We made them into muffins with a slightly larger amount of chocolate chips.  They will be a favorite high-fiber snack for months to come.
