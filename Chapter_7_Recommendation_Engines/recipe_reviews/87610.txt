this works best if you put into a large paper bag and vigorously shake before heating.  It helps distribute and remove excess oil.  I used chow mein noodles and just what I had on hand to equal the amt. of dry mix. good.

I read all the reviews and thought this sounded SO delicious. This was simply not good. I followed the recipe exactly, used 1/2 rice chex and 1/2 corn chex. I also used 1/2 pretzel sticks and 1/2 pretzel twists. I think it was the parmesan cheese that gave it such a funky flavor. I would not recommend this recipe, sorry.

I made this to munch on during the football games this past Sunday. Everyone loved it so much I had to make a second batch during half time. My kids have asked that I put some in their school lunches as snack. I'm going to add some whole almonds to the mix so to add some additional 'brain food.'

Buy slow cooker liners so you can add all ingredients and shake to mix.  (Even the large Ziploc bags aren't big enough to hold all the snacks in this recipe).  SO much easier than stirring ingredients in a bowl

This is a good recipe,but I tweaked it a little since I am a cajun from louisiana. Instead of butter I used olive oil just enough to give the mix a glossy shine.Also omit the microwave a wax paper step.I also added granulated garlic and little dry dill.I also added cayenne pepper to give it just a little kick.Omit the parm cheese it kind of throws it off.Those that have trouble getting it mix add the dry ingredients a little at a time to mix evenly.

I tried this a couple of times.  The ranch mix really didn't distribute too well.  I prefer the original Chex Mix--still my favorite.

I used the ingredients called for plus some mixed nuts, drizzled the butter a little at a time and stirred, then put about a third in a large paper bag, added 1/3 of seasoning, another 1/3 mix, 1/3 seasoning...you get it...and shook it all up (but not too vigorously or it turns to dust!). If you don't just dump the seasoning in, it shouldn't clump on you.  Overall, I'm happy with the results but I think next time I will up the seasoning to 1 1/2 or 2 packets. Oh, I also left out the parmesan since I'm not serving it until next week and I don't want to take a chance on it going bad....

It's not too bad, it quenches the savory fiend in me. I did a half and half mixture with pretzel sticks and twists. As suggested, mix it in a large paper bag, as the ranch tends not to mix very well with the cheese and you get clumps.

This is a nice change from normal chex mix. I used 3 cups each of rice, corn, and wheat chex. I also used pretzel rods as that's what I had on hand and then I used 3 cups of chedder goldfish! The only other things I changed was I melted the butter mixed in the Ranch seasoning poured that over tossed together then tossed in some parmesan cheese and baked it at 250 for a hour stirring every 15 mins.

It was just "eh."  Nothing too exciting.  I've made many different varieties of chex mix and this one left a little to be desired.  I made it with and without the parmesan cheese and prefer it without.  It's easy to make if you're in a hurry though.

LOVED this recipe! Make sure you use a really big bowl, and stir carefully.  It's also good to measure out all dry ingredients first & have that ready when you take the melted butter out of the microwave, so that you can stir it in right away & the butter doesn't have any time to harden back up.

I have found that he best Snax mix is just assorted cereal, pretzels and cheese crackers mixed with a variety of nuts. No baking, no extra calories from butter, no extra salt. It keeps very well in an airtight container. It is super quick to make, just dump them together and mix. It is a close to guilt free snacking as you can get, after all, it is mostly multi-grain cereal. Try it, you will like it.

I love this mix! Great stater recipe to teach my 9 yo cooking. I half the ranch mix because it's too salty for us as written. Hence the 4*'s. We also omit the parm out of taste preference. We use generic chex and what ever grain (corn, wheat, etc) we have on hand. There are partial boxes left that do not equate to a whole recipe worth, so we need another box to make more after the initial batch. No problem considering we like it ;)

Great idea, but needs more flavor.  Maybe more ranch?  Did work out very well as far as procedure.
UPDATE: baked in oven this time at 250 for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes.  Turned out much better!

I did not care for this version of party mix.  It didn't taste anything like ranch, and I even added more ranch than called for.  All I could taste was the parmesan cheese, and I followed the recipe.  I'll stick with the original or spicy version.

I used 1/2 bag of regular Chex Mix and 1/2 a bag of Cheddar chex. The butter made it soggy, but I baked at 250 for about 20 minutes to harden it back up.

I used pretzel nuggets, Goldfish crackers and I used vegetable oil instead of butter. I also made my own ranch dressing mix from my own recipe. I've always made Chex Mix in the oven. 250 degrees for an hour, stirring every fifteen minutes is just right. This turned out really well though I think it needs a bit more butter to make everything stick, seems to me I saw a lot of the spice and cheese sitting at the bottom of the pan. You expect that with Chex Mix but this was more than usual. Next time, I'll switch to using vegetable oil and increase the amount and see if that dosen't work better for me.

While I love the original Chex Mix recipe - I love this one even more.    Add mixed nuts/peanuts, prezels or whatever you want.  Absolutely awesome.

Great alternative to the regular chex mix! A lot of the seasoning sunk down to the bottom but I just made sure to pour it over the top when cooling.

Made this for the football game and everyone loved it. I would make it again - I followed the recipe as is. It to me wasn't a WOW recipe, but it was quick and easy. Good for a quick take along to any get together.

I love this recipe as do my college age sons.  I prepare it in the oven (250 deg, stirring every 15 min for 1 hr), but otherwise prepare as written.  I tried, on the advice of another review, to melt butter, stir in powdered dressing and pour over the Chex mix, but it lumped up terribly and was very difficult to disburse.  Pour melted butter over Chex and stirring in powder works just fine.

Pretty good and so easy.  My kids love it!  I use a mixture of corn Chex, wheat Chex, and Cheerios.  I didn't add the cheese as I wasn't sure if I would like it in this recipe.

This was just average. I made it for a party and it didn't wow anyone. The ranch flavor wasn't bold enough. It was simple and easy to throw together in a pinch.

LOVE this snack mix, but it is impossible to quit eating! Instead of regular ranch mix, I use the southwest ranch mix. It gives it a little kick. I have also made it with original ranch, but added chili powder and cumin. I usually add a handful or 2 of peanuts as well.

Very good.  I did make a few changes going by the previous reviews.  I left out the parmesan cheese and added 2T of worcestershire sauce and a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper.

Addicting!  Used extra ranch seasoning (not quite double?).  I definitely think it needed the extra seasoning.  Thanks!

I make this several times a year, and it never disappoints!  Since I usually double to triple the recipe, I find it's easier to put everything in a large, clean garbage bag to more easily mix everything.  Store the mix in the same bag it was mixed in (close with a twist tie). I also add oyster crackers and Bugles to the mix.

I definitely followed the recipe but baked this (it would be soggy if not!) and also added gold fish.  1/2 rice chex and 1/2 corn chex is best because they are different textures.

Ratios are way off on the "seasoning mix" for this recipe. Needs more butter or it only makes a sludge that clumps on a few pieces and leaves the rest underwhelming. Even trying to fix, still may not be worth eating.

This is a great recipe, I modified it a little by using the rold gold mini cheese pretzels instead of the plain ones, used a stick of butter to completely cover all ingredients in the bowl first,, then I used a large 3 or 2 1/2 gallon hefty bag. It works really well if you fill it first with some parmesan cheese, then add to the bag the buttered mix, then the balance of the cheese ( I used a cup of parmesan) and 2 packs of the ranch,. Then close up the slide zipper bag all but a little bit, blow it up like a balloon, then quickly close it, then shake vigorously, it will completely cover all of the ingredients. ENJOY!

Didn't care for the ranch flavour.  It didn't seem like the appropriate flavour for the snack.    I won't make it again.

It was very easy to make, but I think it needed a bit more seasoning.  It didn't seem to cover all 9 C of cereal and the 4 C of other crunchy bits with flavor and we even used parmesan cheese crackers.  I took out the pretzels and added in gold fish.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I did make a couple changes.  I added an extra tablespoon of butter to it. I've made it twice, and the second time I made it, I put in 1 less cup of cereal and 1/2 cup less pretzels and instead added 1.5 cups peanuts in with it.  Since some people said the Ranch flavor was light and hard to taste and suggested adding in additional ranch, I tried that the first time I made it. What I discovered is that the immediate flavor is strong and really good. However, we had some leftover from the party we brought it to, and over the course of a few days, I discovered that the ranch flavor became almost over-powering.  The second time I made it, I only added 1 ranch packet, and although I've only tried a few bites (we have friends coming over in a few minutes, so I'm trying to save it for the party!), it tasted just fine and was really yummy! 

Both times I made it, I mixed the ranch in with the butter, so you have to be careful to make sure the cereal is evenly coated when you mix it up. Instead of microwaving it, I baked it at 250F for 20 minutes and stirred once around 10 minutes.  

Our family loves this recipe, and I definitely plan to make if fairly often!

I used 6 Tbs butter (like the original Chex mix recipe) turned the mix into the butter first then sifted the ranch dressing over the mix while stirring using a flour sifter.  Worked like a charm!  No lumps and no pulverized bits from shaking it in a bag!  Bake in the oven at 225 for an hour stirring every 15 min.  Cool on paper towels.  Store in air tight container.
