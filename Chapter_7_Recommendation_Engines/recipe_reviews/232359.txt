This recipe is great and very versatile.  I've been making a version of this for years, only I use beef cut into stew-sized chunks.  Also, I add some peanut butter to taste towards the end.  There are many "authentic" Thai variations on red curry, including Panang beef curry.  The Panang uses Panang curry paste (Frequently available right next to the tubs or cans of red curry) and peanut butter is part of that curry.  Mussuman curry is another variant and it uses potatoes.  While Thai beef curries typically don't stew the meat (usually sliced thin and added towards the end) my favorite Thai restaurant from about 25 years ago made their version with beef chunks that were stewed and that's how I've been making it for years.  Experiment with any of the 3 red curry pastes: Red, Panang, or Mussuman, and change up the additions to suit your tastes and you can dial this recipe in to suit your exact tastes.  Keep in mind that the pre-made curry pastes of any color are concentrated and typically very hot, so plan accordingly.  Also, serving this with steamed jasmine rice and making a little extra sauce can really stretch this meal.  One last thing, the fish sauce by itself smells and tastes terrible.  But it adds a required (and wonderful) flavor to Thai curries and it mellows significantly when cooked.  Just don't over do it.

I made this once before and it was just ok. Then I read the reviews and made some adjustments and it was sooooo good. I used a grass fed roast. I tripled the red curry paste (Thai kitchen brand), I added one jalape√±o that had been seeded and sliced on top of onions. REDUCED THE CHICKEN STOCK
TO JUST ONE CUP. Followed directions to cook in slow cooker on low for 7 he's. Added 2  sweet potatoes cut into 2" chunks for the last 45 min.  OMIT THE BOK CHOY. It just gets too mushy. Cook it another way if you want. Remove the potatoes and strain the sauce into a saucepan. Bring to a boil. Mix 2 tbsp softened butter with 2 tbsp flour to form a paste. Whisk into sauce and simmer for a few minutes until it thickens. Voila!! Now it's a 5 star recipe.

Absolutely fabulous. TBH, some people shun Americanized "hybrid" dishes like this in favor of authentic ethnic entrees with established history and tradition behind them. I admit to having been one of those snobs, probably from having gone to one too many really bad Americanized Chinese restaurants (even one is too many). But this dish had me pleasantly surprised and has gone some way in reforming my antiquated mindset. I'd always wondered how the fantastic sweet and spicy flavor from the Thai curry coconut milk soup staples could translate to other dishes. Here is a well executed example by Chef John on how that happens, taking a dish as American as pot roast in a slow cooker and spicing it up with the all essential red curry and coconut milk ingredients signature to Thai.

My only changes were to use the more nutritious protein based chickpeas (dry stock) that I added at the start of the slow cook instead of carbs like potatoes. As personal preference and higher tolerance I also tripled the amount of curry and used gluten free quinoa flour instead of cornstarch. I'm very pleased with how delicious it turned out. I'll be returning to this recipe again in the future. Thanks John, I'm very happy about being able to have this in my repertoire.

I followed the recipe almost to the letter except I did not have Rotel tomatoes on hand so I used a can of regular diced tomaotes, and I used a 1T of red curry paste. Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  I didn't cook the roast as long, maybe 5 hrs on low and the vegetables cooked for  45 mins to 1 hour on high. At the end I transferred the sauce to a stove top pot to reduce the sauce (my attempt to concentrate the sauce).  That helped, but the sauce did not taste as rich and flavorful. My concern at the outset was the amount of liquid called for in a slow cooker recipe.  Experience has taught me that less liquid is better for most slow cooker recipes.  This recipe was no exception.  The sauce had a fabulous flavor initially, but  the extended cooking in the slow cooker made the sauce too watery and as a result flavor was lost.  The next time I will try this recipe in the oven as I think the sauce won't break down as much, and the richness in flavor will not be sacrificed.  I also think this sauce / gravy would pair well with chicken or fish.  I would have given this recipe a higher mark, but for the loss in flavor due to too much liquid. I would reduce the chicken stock by at least 1 cup.

Very flavorful! My son who ate a lot of Thai food loved it. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Maybe it's my slow cooker, but "cooking the potatoes in the slow cooker for about 12 minutes" was definitely not enough. Next time, I will cook it for at least an hour, or put it in a stock pot and cook it on the cooktop on a higher temperature. Can't wait to do it again!

Awesome recipe. I used a top shoulder roast and substituted chick peas for the potatoes. I also used 1 tsp ground ginger instead of fresh. Really tasty. Highly recommend.

The family I cook for are from India. I make this exactly as is except I use bones less skinless chicken breast. This is what they request when family and friends are invited. I personally love the beef but the chicken is great too. This is my favorite receipt of 2013.

I made this yesterday and everyone loved it. Made a few changes because I didn't have ingredients; first I used chicken soup base dissolved in 1/2 cup apple juice and mixed with 2 T of honey in place of the chicken stock and brown sugar.  I omitted the bok choy. I also added 2 peeled, chopped sweet potatoes.  I used 1 full tablespoon of red curry paste but found it wasn't "curry" enough for me so I added a tablespoon of curry powder. And I added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 to 1/2 tsp cloves and 1 tablespoon of peanut butter. The potatoes thickened the sauce sufficiently so that I didn't have to use any cornstarch. I didn't chop the meat after cooking but I did shred it into bite sized chunks, which were wonderfully flavorful. Thanks for this recipe!

Very flavorful.  I made it exactly like the recipe.  I did not however, have enough potatoes and by happy accident used a sweet potato, which IMHO is much better!  Next time I make this I will use more spices and definitely par-boil the potatoes.   The white ones took about an hour, the sweet about 45 minutes in the slow cooker.

The meat was tender, and there was a lot of fat to be skimmed off.  I will definitely make this again..maybe try chicken thighs.

This stuff is to die for.  A few tips.  Its hard to peel ginger.  I used a piece about the size of three fingers and cut it into slivers.  Even though I trimmed my roast, a lot of oil was present on top towards the end of cooking due to the coconut milk and I removed about half a cup.  With the bok choy, I put the stems in about an hour before serving and the greens right at the end so they wouldn't wilt.  Skip the potatoes and serve it over rice or egg noodles. You then need more cornstarch to thicken the broth, probably a tablespoon and a half.

This is now my favorite base for beef curry.  I did have to make some substitutions for what I had in the house.  I used worchestershire instead of the fish sauce (it taste good, although I think I will buy the fish sauce to make it next time).  I used 1tsp powdered ginger instead of fresh. Green curry paste (personal preference) instead of the red.  I felt it was a little sweet for my taste, so I threw in approx 4 oz of tomato sauce also.  I think this recipe is versatile enough you could put in whatever kind of vegetables, greens, or garnishes you would like and it would still taste great.  My husband said this was his favorite curry that I have made and I have tried alot of them on this site

This was so good. It was like a regular beef roast stew but with a mildly exotic spin. I used a lot of curry paste and it didn't even begin to strike me as hot.

Made a few minor changes - used chickpeas instead of potatoes, used only one cup of broth, skipped the tomato paste (had none), and added a spoonful of peanut butter at the end. Delicious!

Spectacular! I had beef cheeks that were just shy of 2lbs so I used just 1cup or chicken broth & a 14oz can of tomatoes. Also, 1tbs of red curry (from the video it looks like a tbs not a tsp.) Also, I added a kafir lime leaf. Per other reviewers, I added my potatoes to the last hour of cooking time then followed the recipe directions w/bok choy & cornstarch slurry. Incredible flavor & pretty easy!

Excellent!  I added potatoes the last 2 hours and tripled the red curry paste. The sauce was perfect until I might the line juice in, that's why I tripled the red curry paste because the lime juice over powered the sauce. I also used light coconut milk and served over brown rice.  I thought the ginger  root was going to be too much but it softened and the flavor was great after cooking was completed. Turned out excellent!  My husband just loved it!

This was so fantastic!!! I made a few changes WHICH I SHOULDN'T HAVE. Instead of using corn starch, I transferred the broth to a dutch oven and reduced it. I couldn't taste enough of the coconut milk...I love coconut milk, so I added another can of coconut milk. Yes I could now taste the coconut milk, but little else. I added more red curry paste, cayenne pepper...if I'd left it alone (I tasted it before any changes were made), it would have been perfect. My husband loved it, but he would have REALLY loved it if I had made it as instructed. I served it over rice so if it were soupier it would have been better. My husband doesn't appreciate the wonderful flavor of bok choy so it was nixed too. I will make this again following the recipe to the letter...minus the bok choy of course. Thanks Chef John for yet another fantastic recipe.

We enjoyed this, although I made a few changes.  I realized I didn't have Rotel at the last minute so I diced two plum tomatoes and minced a large jalape√±o.  I added the cilantro to the crock pot mixture rather than garnishing with it.  Also, I didn't have peanuts so I ended up adding a small amount of peanut butter to the sauce mixture.  Turned out quite well, served with rice.

My family loves this!  we've probably made this 5 times in the past year and every time they ask for more.  we like a little more curry paste and some ground red pepper for a spicy kick.

This was delicious.  I wanted to share it with a few of my Thai friends and they do not eat beef so I used a pork loin roast.  I followed the recipe as closely as I could.  My slow cooker has 2 low settings and 2 high settings, I am unable to adjust the temperature easily so I parboiled and par steamed the potatoes and bokchoy prior to placing them in the broth.  I added a little more curry paste and fish sauce than the recipe calls for  ( because it says " or to taste ").   The only thing I wished i would have done was buy a nice fresh baguette because the leftover broth in the serving bowl should not be ignored!! I did have a few frozen pieces of naan that I warmed up and they sufficed as a great transfer agent for the remaining broth.  Plus, that made it extra fusiony, it was an American southern favorite with a Thai influence and Indian accoutrement!! Lol.  Will make again and again.

This was delicious.  I didn't have potatoes or the bok choy so I added mushrooms.  When it was done cooking and after I thickened the sauce, I added cubed butternut squash that I previously roasted and chickpeas.

The potatoes definitely require more cooking.  I felt that the result was more of a stew and, by the time it had cooked for so long, the flavors were indistinguishable and thus not worth all the trouble - to me, part of slow cooking is ease of effort.

This is really good...I made it per the recipe and we were very happy with the spice level and crunch from the boo choy.  My only complaint is that the curry was very runny and I was hoping for it to be a bit thicker.  In any case, the recipe is very tasty!  Enjoy!

Ok what sold me on this recipe was Chef John's extremely entertaining video but this may be my favorite crock pot recipe yet. I agree wither other reviewers that the potatoes took more like an hour to cook and I used tiny white potatoes cut in half! I put the baby bok choy in closer to the end (maybe about 15 minutes?) as to not get super mushy. I also love spice so I tripled the amount of curry AND used panang curry paste because it's what I had on hand. I love the other reviewers idea of adding kaffir lime leaves. Trying that next time. Thanks, Chef John!

Tasty goodness. Our crock pot is a bit temperamental, so I steamed the bok choy and potatoes separately for 15 minutes, and then added them during the last 15 minutes of cooking.

I really enjoyed this dish. I followed the directions the first time I made it but it was a bit too spicy for my tastes.  I used twice the coconut milk for the second night's leftovers and it was perfect.  

I had to cook the potatoes for two hours, not 12 minutes.

Easy to make with a great flavor but this is not for everyone.  People who don't like spice should stay away.

This was excellent. So much flavour! My family loved it. One of the best recipes I have made form this site. Only change I made was, I cooked the potatoes on high in the crock pot for about 30 minutes, before adding the bok choy.

Wow! This is great. The potatoes take longer to cook than advertised. Next time I'll add them before the bok choy. Very good dish.

I have made this recipe at least 10 times and its a family favorite. I use 1 TBSP of red curry paste instead of 1 tsp and its more flavorful this way. I also prefer to cut the fish sauce in half. This is my favorite recipe on allrecipes.

Excellent recipe. Easy to assemble in the morning and leave for the day - to come home to a tasty, healthy dish. Served over jasmine rice. Definitely a keeper and will make again soon. (oh, added a sweet potato)  - yum!

Loved this! This is boring old pot roast made exciting again. We followed the recipe exactly. The potatoes weren't cooked through enough and needed more time in the slow cooker (maybe they should be streamed a little before being thrown in the pot?), but other than that it was perfect. The instructions were easy and the left overs froze nicely and lost none of their flavor when hauled back out of the freezer at a later date. This is our new favorite slow cooker recipe.

We loved this!  I used another reviewers suggestion and used a can of garbanzo beans instead of potatoes.  I also used one head of regular bok choy chopped.  Also, from another reviewer, I stirred in a tablespoon or two of peanut butter at the end.  I used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken.  My meat was so tender it pretty much shredded and this helped to "thicken" the sauce too.  I made basmati rice and put it in the bowls and ladled the curry over the rice.  The flavors were amazing!  I wish I had a side of Naan to soak up the last drops of sauce in the bowl.  By adding the beans and bok choy, this made a lot of food from one roast - which I am happy about because now we have delicious leftovers.  I will definitely make this again and would not change a thing other than using beans instead of potatoes.  We love cilantro so the fresh cilantro and chopped peanuts at the end were the icing on the cake!

This was fabulous!  Even the curry hater liked it!  I added more curry paste (used about 3 tsp for our tastes) and left out the bok choy (not well like by a few family members). My potatoes took a lot longer than 12 mins to cook.  I thought that would be the case, so I planned for that.  I will definitely make this again!

Prep time far from 15 minutes. Cook time for potatoes resulted in meal finished at 9pm. Needless to say, ate something else for dinner.  Not a very pleasant experience, but taste ok.

Yum!! The only difference, I used green instead of red curry paste, only because that's what I had on hand.  I imagine it would be just as fabulous with red curry.  Really enjoyed it and it made a ton of food with a small roast. 
Highly recommend!

I loved it, and so did my husband and dinner guests. I did use green curry instead of red curry, but that is because I don't like too spicy of dishes and I love the sweetness of green curry.

I love this dish!!! I did make it more like a Thai coconut milk curry soup which we love. I make a green chicken coconut curry soup so I loved finding half this red curry paste with beef recipe. I used about 1.75-2 pounds of beef (more soup consistency), sweet potatoes instead white potatoes, and kale instead of bok choy. The potato and greens changes were mostly personal taste reasons but I believe were delicious changes. If you like sweet, creamy dishes with a serious kick you really need to try this dish. It's a new dish in our recipe rotation. Yum!

I used chuck steak. Agree it is too thin. 
We love the flavor and tenderness of the meat.
Will make again using less liquid, add sweet potato (used no potato today) and will use spinach.
Again, Loved the flavor!

Wow! I love Thai food, but this is my first time using red curry paste. I followed the directions almost exactly, except I used 1/2 of the lime when making the sauce and the rest at the end, to bring a bit of freshness to the dish. I also followed one of the suggestions and added about 1/2 cup of peanut butter towards the end (when I added the potatoes). The potatoes definitely took much longer than 12 minutes, I wound up cooking them for over an hour. It came out awesome! I'm definitely going to make this again.

This recipe was absolutely delicious, and one that I will be making again!  I followed almost as directed, leaving out only the coriander and lime juice because we didn't have them and substituting stew-sized meat for the roast and light coconut milk. Still, it was delicious, not too spicy, but full of rich, layered flavors.  I'm back for more recipe suggestions from Chef John.  I hope others are as tasty as this one!

Easy and delicious.  I could not get good Bok Choy and substituted Kale instead.  I only used the leaves and it still turned out fabulous.   It was a hit with my family and I served it with crusty French bread.

I have made this type recipe for years like one other reviewer, but I learned to make it using sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes, and I have to admit that the sweets are still my favorite but the whites were very good. Oh,and I'm going to try the garbanzo beans next time, because that sounds yummy too!

This was a delicious pot roast alternative.  There was enough picante from the pepper to give it a kick, but not so much the flavors were lost.  I used an elk roast so there was absolutely no fat to skim and the flavor was great.  I did add one jalepe√±o chili diced up as well as pea pods, sliced red bell pepper and diced zucchini toward the end of cooking.  I like to sneak more veggies in whenever I can.  My potatoes took longer than 12 minutes, but I might have  made to large of chunks.
Next time, and there will be a next time, I will increase the red curry paste and ginger.

My husband and I loved this unique slow cooker pot roast. Our house guests loved it too. We live at high altitude so I cooked on low a full 8 hours but the vegetables took a lot more than 12 minutes to cook at high altitude. We ended up eating it the next day after cooking those vegetables the second day. It‚Äôs definitely worth planning on it being a two step(day) operation. We loved it and will make it again.

My family always asks for my curried chicken for each of their birthdays but when I fixed this, my daughter said it might be her new favorite. I think each person needs to tweak it to their own personal taste but it is a great recipe!!

We liked the recipe!  I did make one change:  I used a small bag of new multi colored potatoes and threw them in at the beginning.  Turned out beautifully!

I made it exactly & it was delicious. Next time I‚Äôll cook the potatoes a little while outside the crockpot. They came out very hard. That was after an hour.

I used a flour rue to thicken the sauce and served with asian veggies instead of bok choy.  I also like more curry paste and less stock.

I browned the meat and made the broth (added about Tbsp and a half of curry paste) without the coconut milk according to the directions but then added both to the instant pot. Cooked in high pressure 20 min. /Lb. (50 min). Slow release 10 min. Meanwhile I partially cooked the potatoes and chopped the bok choy. When it was done, I removed the meat from the  pan and shredded it. Turned the instant pot on saute, added the cornstarch and let the broth thicken. Added about a Tbsp of peanut butter. Added meat and potatoes back to the pot.  Cook about 5 min, add bok choy cook another 5 min or so. Turn off saute and stir in coconut milk. I didn't want to boil the milk. We decided to serve this on rice because the broth was sooo delicious and we didn't have bread or naan. Topped with cilantro. I might try this same recipe with chicken. My husband and I both loved it! He said is was 'devine!!'

Excellent!
Made this in the pressure cooker. Cook the meat and broth on the default meat setting. Slow release the pressure for 10 minutes. Take the meat out to cut it into bite size pieces. Add the cornstarch, potatoes, and bok choy. Put the meat back in. Cook on high for 10 minutes. Fast release the pressure. Serve.

Excellent recipe! I converted it to the instant pot so it was done in less than 90 minutes. I had a small roast, but it wouldn‚Äôt take much longer for a bigger one. (Conversion: Substitute lite coconut milk for the regular; substitute 2 tsp low sodium better than bouillon for the chicken broth but don‚Äôt add water; saut√© the onions, seasonings, curry and tomato paste in oil; add the remaining sauce ingredients and stir; add roast; meat/stew button adjusted to more, which is 45 min; 10 min release; add potatoes and Bok choy; hp 5 min with QR; add cornstarch slurry and use Saute to thicken sauce)

I am not a fan of pot roast but occasionally make it for my husband but this was a delicious recipe I will make a lot.  I used oyster sauce instead of fish sauce.  the flavors are so complex and go together beautifully!  Very easy too!

Did everything exactly except added 1 teaspoon red curry paste and 2 teaspoons of green curry paste.... my 12 year old granddaughter had to be restrained from sampling that and couldn‚Äôt wait for it to cook for one more hour... we were all in La La Land and ready for bed after we ate it!!

First off:  potatoes don't take only 12 min to cook on this planet.  Maybe something is off with my crock pot, but it took me over an hour to cook the potatoes....probably 1.5 hours.  Next time I will transfer everything to a big pot on the stove to cook potatoes and thicken the sauce.  My crock pot cooked the meat beautifully on low for 7 hours, but on high to cook the potatoes and thicken the sauce?  Not a chance.  This recipe was yummy.  I think I will make it again.  But man, today, I was very disappointed.  From 9-10am I prepared the meal for the crockpot, then at 5:20pm I prepared and threw in the potatoes and bok choy.  I was still waiting at 6:20 for the potatoes to be cooked but I had to eat it anyway, just had to take the potatoes out and it was runny, but I served it with rice.  Finally at 7:30 my husband tells me the potatoes are done.  I worked all day for this.  Ugh.  But next time I will cook the meat in the crockpot then transfer the liquid to the stove.

I had a boneless blade in the fridge and did not get around to cooking it when I planned.  It was awesome in this recipe.  Next time, I will probably double the red curry paste and add some Thai chilis to increase the heat.

Super good!  I did add more red curry paste, it did say to add curry paste to taste.   I added 1 T but it could have used more.  I also added two kefir lime leaves at some other reviewer's urging, and about 1/2 t of Madras curry and cardamom.  I could have used more of each.  I used sweet potatoes, that's what I had on hand and that was stellar. I cooked them the last 45 minutes, but had to turn the heat up to high for an additional  10 minutes to finish them off.  Perhaps my chunks were too big.   Then I removed the veggies, strained the gravy into a pot, thickened it with flour and butter , then cooked it on the stovetop.  I find it much easier to get the correct thickening without all the stuff in the pot.  Then I just added everything back into the pot and heated a few minutes to heat the meat and veggies.  Killer good stuff!

I didn't follow the instructions for the pre-cooking.  I put it all in a pot and came back 7 hours later.  This was a delicious blend of flavors but the lime a tad too much, which also lowered the sweetness.  I did have a fresh lime and it burst with juice, so maybe more than expected.  It does offset the coconut.  Very nice combination.

I followed the recipe as-written.  I thought the jus would thicken up more with the cornstarch but it was still pretty runny.  The favor is excellent, just maybe not as Asian as I had hoped.  This is still an excellent dish.

I really liked this recipe but I did not make it wholly as instructed. Due to lacking some ingredients like boo choi, peanuts, red curry paste, coriander, fish sauce.

So I made my own curry paste, added in kumera (sweet potato) and served with pita pockets one night and roti the next.

I cooked it in the oven in a cast iron lidded pot. Which is how I do all the slow cooker meals I make when there is only the two of us. I cooked it at 150 C for 90 minutes with lid on and half an hour with it off.

It was not spicy enough. I will add more curry paste to broth mixture next time I make it. Like, other reviewers, cook the bok choy in a pan, it becomes mushy too easily. Will probably maka it again.

Very flavorful recipe, and easy to follow. I halved the recipe since I only needed to feed two people. We enjoyed the dish fresh last night and will be eating the second half tonight over jasmine rice. I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used Gourmet Garden brand ginger paste. 

I had to cook the tiny potatoes (each cut in half) on high for 30+ minutes before they were soft enough to eat, rather than the 12 minutes outlined in the recipe. It may vary for others. Just poke them with a fork to make sure they're softened to your liking before serving.

Admittedly I used this recipe as more of a suggestion.  The big changes were that I used a pork sirloin instead of Chuck. Also, less fat means less skimming fat off the top. I cubed it before hand because arguably I'm lazy. Added corn, a little more red Chilli paste, and Napa cabbage instead of bok choy because in the northwest it's in season. Also, be sure to put the potatoes in a little earlier, you'll be glad you did.

I used larger potatoes & cut them into small bite-sized pieces, but it still took a long time for them to cook. I used stew beef & did not brown it. One tsp of red curry paste didn't add much flavor to my full crockpot. I added another tablespoon at the end and that made the dish slightly spicy & more flavorful. Also added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch. The end result was quite good & my family liked it. Will make this again.

One of our favorites. I have made this dish multiple times. We usually double it and have it over mashed potatoes instead of adding the potatoes. It is always a hit. Thanks Chef John!!

I love everything about this recipe except the last where potatoes and bok choy are added.  My All-Clad cooker is the bomb, but even it could not raise the temp enough to cook these little (1-1/2 inch spuds cut in half) enough in 12 minutes!  No way!  Cook the potatoes - whatever size you want, and the bok choy separately and add when you remove the beef.  The beef itself and the broth are wonderful - just  cook the spuds first!

I'm not a roast lover, but this recipe changed my mind about them.  I cook a lot of Thai and Indian foods and this recipe is definitely being added to the list of favorites.  It turned out more like a stew.  Love it and will make it again!

Nice twist on Beef Stew. I used sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes since they taste better and are more nutritious. I think I can cut most if not all the sugar as the coconut milk and sweet potatoes added enough sweetness. Definitely a keeper.

My husband and I loved this meal, and there was enough for the next night too! I made a few changes. First, I used my Dutch oven and cooked it for 4 hours  on the  stove top due to time. We love kale, so I reduced the amount of bokchoy by half and added some kale. Finally, my husband loves spicy food so I added 3/4 tsp of cayenne, and added an extra tsp.  Of curry paste. Thank you for this delicious recipe.

I made minor adjustments based on other reviews - upped the Curry Paste to 3 TBS. Made a slurry paste for thickening of Flour & Butter.  Reduced stock to 1 cup. Swapped in Sweet potatoes. Everything else to a tee. Really turned out great.  I also added back the strained veggies - no reason to throw those out or separate. Definitely a keeper. Will also up the amount of beef next time to 3 lbs.

Very tasty and we will make it again. Only adjustments I made was to add a dozen dried Japones peppers while it was cooking to kick up the heat some, and substituted 1/2 cup beer and 1 1/2 cup chicken broth.

Everyone loved it.  I cook the bok choy separately.  The recipe could have been more precise, i.e., the amount of ginger and the green chilies.

Well, it didn't quite turn out the way I thought it would.  I thought it would be more of a curry sauce. It really ended up like a beef stew.  I would follow other recommendations on these reviews and use only one cup of broth in the future.  I did use more curry paste than recipe called for and I'm glad I did.  I would next time pour off the liquid into a pan and then add the cornstarch, as my liquid never did thicken up.  The flavor was amazing, but I was disappointed that the coconut milk was basically non-existent at the end.  More of a broth-like consistency. I might wait next time and add the coconut milk to the broth in my pan when adding cornstarch to thicken up.  But overall, very tasty!!  Even my daughter who hates curry liked it.  Really love the addition of the ginger.  Do not omit that! Oh and I did not use bok choy but had a little green cabbage that I threw in.

Excellent! Everything worked together very well and very tasty. I was not sure about the baby bok choy since I had never eaten it before but it too was good.
I love Indian food and this has all the good flavors that I like.

This was wonderful.  I used 2 small venison roasts, which came out perfectly tender.  (Sometimes venison roast dries out in the Crockpot, but this recipe worked very well.)  I left out the brown sugar, used at least 2 tsp. red curry paste, full-fat coconut milk, and 2 tsp. cornstarch.   I added the potatoes during the last couple hours of cooking.  Next time, I may try what other reviewers suggested and thicken the sauce a bit on the stove. Thanks, Chef John!

This meal was an awesome mix of various palate pleasing flavors.  This tops the list of any flavorful dishes I've ever made.  I couldn't find Asian fish sauce so I subbed in Asian oyster sauce.  I also could only find bok choy so I used a full size bunch and cut it up in 1" sections.  The only thing I think it would have been even better with a little more curry.  I used the 1 teaspoon and should have probably used at least 2 after the fact.  Still all in all it came out wonderful and my wife and I enjoyed it.  I will make it again and again with more curry of course.  Hats off to Chef John!!!

Love this recipe!!  I used elk cut into cubes and browned instead of beef roast because that was what I had and skipped the cornstarch part.  Very good flavors, all my kids, teenagers down to 1st graders, loved it. Another thumbs up for Chef John!!

I made this for sunday lunch and it was a hit. the recipe had a very good balance of sweetness, spicy, sour and saltiness. i just adjusted the cumin to make up for the absence of coriander. I used fresh coconut milk instead of a canned milk. It really boosted the flavor of the dish.

Not as hot as we expected but still a great combination of flavors with no single flavor shining through above the others. We will make this again but will add more curry and more ginger. What a great way to add new life to a pot roast.

Chef John- Thanks for sharing another amazing culinary idea! The video was very helpful.

Edit:This time I made it and decreased the chicken stock to half a cup and used 3Tcurry  for more intense  flavor and after reading some of the other reviews.

Tried this recipe on Sunday and we really did enjoy it.  There seemed to be too many ingredients but well worth the time it took. I used beef chunks because that is what I was able to find.  This eliminated the need to break up the beef at the end. This was my first time cooking or eating baby Bok Choy, we thought it was tasty, but think I will add fresh spinach next time.  We prefer our food spicy so I doubled the red curry paste and then added a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper.  The flavors meld together nicely.  Will make again.  it was spicy.

Very good.   You would think all of the ingredients listed would result in a very exotic and strong flavor but my expectations were very disappointing.  I would like to know how you can make this dish more savory.
