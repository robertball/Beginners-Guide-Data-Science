This is straight from the Emerald Isle and should ONLY be made with Jameson's finest.  Wonderful way to end a meal!

Very simple, very easy. I will say I don't know the measurements of liquor in ounces. I just used a shot glass. I used 1.5 shots of Jameson Whiskey and that turned out to be very strong, but it's very good. lol Cheers!

This is a wonderful drink which originated in SF at the BV or Buena Vista on Hyde St. If you are in SF it is a fun place to go and watch the bartender make them in a long row at the bar. A note about the whipping cream: when you whip your cream don't whip it firm leave it a little soft then pour it over the back of a spoon on top of your hot coffee this will place the cream on top of your coffee not go down into the coffee. Also when whipping your cream add some sugar to the whipping cream. The presentation is lovely with the whipping cream floating on top....Enjoy!!!!!
