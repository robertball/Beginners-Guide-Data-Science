Excellent dish! So easy to make and it comes together quickly.  It's packed with flavor and the seasonings are spot on. I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but like the occasional meatless dish for a change of pace.  Season with salt at the end if needed, depending on how salty the broth and chickpeas you're using are. Next time I probably won't bother draining the tomatoes. I will definitely make this again, and can't wait to reheat leftovers for lunch!
