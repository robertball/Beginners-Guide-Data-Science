This martini is delicious!!  Added some caramel syrup to the rim of the glass--a bit sticky but tasty!  Or you can even swirl some caramel syrup in the bottom of the glass before pouring the martini in--mmmmmm!  Also try throwing in a Maraschino cherry.

This is my favorite drink in the world!!! the trick is to add a splash of sour mix. I just eyeball it but I use2 parts vodka, I part sour apple schnapps, 1 part buttershots, and half part sour mix. I also use  a mixture of cinnamon and sugar to rim the glass. its my ultimate indulgence

I've never had one of these before, but I love regular sour appletinis. I am having a cocktail party soon and so I've been looking into new fun drinks and this was great! Tasted very good! Be careful because after 2 or 3 of these you will be feeling great!

This was pretty good. We tweaked it a little, subsituting chilled apple juice and omitting the ice for a refreshing summer drink. I felt the caramel flavour could have been stronger but overall twas nice.

VERY strong. I made it as written and it was too strong to drink, so I altered it and made 2 parts sour apple pucker, 2 parts butterscotch schnapps, 1 part vanilla vodka, and 2 parts apple juice. Much better.

Very good as written, EXCELLENT with the caramel on the rim and on the bottom. For those who think it is "too strong:" Please see the definition of a martini. If you add juice, and it's just a mixed drink in a martini glass. And for those who thought it "tasted" too strong, get a better quality of vodka!
This drink is sweet(which I like)and strong(appropriate)and goes down like candy with the caramel syrup. Be Careful!!

The recipe was too strong as written with 3 alcoholic ingredients and no mixer.  I made the following changes and thought it was great.  1 pour vodka or vanilla vodka, splash of butterscotch Schnapps followed by enough spiced apple cider to fill martini glass and I added swirled caramel in the glass as one reviewer suggested.

We set up a Martini bar for our large family gathering on Easter - these were a definite hit!  I would say they ranked #2 or #3 of the whole bar, with chocolatinis being #1 (lots of women at the party - LOL!). Very refreshing, and one won't get you really bombed, but two....... :)

Anyway, very yummy - thanks for the recipe!

I give this a 4.5 stars. I did ask another viewer suggested and put caramel syrup in the glass. It was sticky and not worth it. By itself it's good

Tried these - beware: they will knock you on your kiester!  Had to cut back on the amount of vodka - way too strong for our taste.

I thought this was just okay. I would  have used less vodka, it was pretty strong tasting. Someone had put apple juice in it, that may tone it down. I don't think I'll be trying this again.

I like this recipe because the way I remember how to make it is to say that to make it is, "As easy as 1-2-3" 1/2 shot of butterscotch schnapps, 1 shot of Pucker and 1 1/2 shots of Vodka (or preferrably clear rum)!  Excellent!  :)
