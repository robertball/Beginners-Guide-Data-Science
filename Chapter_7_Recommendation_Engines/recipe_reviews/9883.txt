I followed most of the recipe except used unsalted butter instead of shortening.  The dough was very easy to handle-almost like playdoh consistency!  I used a plastic spoon to scrape out each portion before balling up and rolling into the cinnamon/sugar coating.  It was a surprisingly quick process.  The first time I made these I just dipped the top of the dough into the cinnamon/sugar spice coating - a quicker process yet, but rolling the entire ball into the coating gives the cookie better taste (well worth the trouble).   Just tried this recipe again, but I  only made half the batch.  For this  I still used butter instead of shortening.   I  added half tsp. vanilla and only half tsp.  cream of tartar.  Using a plastic melon baller I scooped up ~ tbsp. of dough, rolled in cin/sug mixture, then slightly flattened on cookie sheet (using bottom of a custard bowl).  I baked @ 375F for 9 minutes (as per another reviewer's direction).    The cookies baked up in the classic form; slightly flattened with the rough, crackly texture.  I got 3 dozen beautifully goldened, cinnamon-speckled cookies.  I think that adding less cream of tartar got the dough to flatten out more (instead of the "dough ball" look) while baking.

These are very traditional snickerdoodles.  The only thing I do differently is to dip the tops in the cinn/sugar rather that roll the whole cookie in it.  This way, the sigar doesn't burn on the bottom of the cookie.  I also do this with molasses crinkles.

Awesome recipe!  I changed a few things... used 1 cup butter instead of shortening.  I baked them at 375 for 9 min. PERFECT!  Great texture and not too sweet!

I have been making this recipe for years.  I love it with coffee, tastes like cinnamon coffee cake.  If you do not want the cookie crispy simply omit or cut down on the cream of tartar.  I like mine chewy so I omit the cream of tartar

I didn't have margarine so I used all butter. I also ran out of vanilla. But these cookies turned out so good!! I took them out of the oven at 8 minutes while they're still soft, but firmed up and became chewy once cooled. The only thing I'll change is to cut down a little on the sugar. Will definately make them again.

This is a fantastic Snickerdoodle recipe! Everyone who tastes them absolutely LOVES them and there are never any leftovers. At work, I always have to bring them when we have a luncheon. I cook them at 375 for 8 minutes so they are soft and delicious.

This recipe was awsome!  Very easy to make.  Only downside is mixing shortening with sugar!  That's a big workout.  My mixer splashes it everywhere so I have to do it by hand.
I have made these cookies about 5 times.  All 5 times have been wonderful!  Friends and family request it often!!   It's a great Christmas cookie.  I hope you try and enjoy it as much as I do!!   :)

don't know what happened, but my cookies came out the same way they looked when we put them in, balls of dough but they were baked through...
we think it's b/c of the spleda we used..

This is a very good recipe. I am in college and the first time I made these snickerdoodles I let almost everyone in my hall know...well they went instantly so I kept them to just my roomates the 2nd time so we would enjoy more of these for ourselves. They were still finished the very next day! I decided to add a picture here of my snickerdoodles. The only thing preventing me from giving this recipe 5 stars is that they are not very fluffy but still very good.

They were OK, good, but really need 2 tsp vanilla and 1/2tsp salt rather than just 1/4. Other than that, pretty fairly good. Mrs. Evelyn

Beware of these cookies - they disappear fast!!  I made these as a treat for my husband; snickerdoodles are his favorite but not a cookie I've made often. I should start by saying I am an avid baker and my various cookies are requested often by friends and family.  Since I didn't have a "go-to" recipe for snickerdoodles, I decided to search here and settled on this one after reading the positive reviews.  I did make some modifications: I needed to use up some butter-flavor shortening so I subbed that for the regular shortening, I took the advice of one reviewer, who like me prefers soft cookies, and eliminated the cream of tartar completely.  I did only make half a batch since it was just my husband and I.  Well, let me say this - the first dozen was completely gone before the second batch was even out of the oven!!  These are soft with a slight crunch to the edge, not too sweet, delicious for dunking in coffee/tea; really the perfect grown-up cookie and the kids will like them too! As far as some of the complaints/concerns regarding this recipe go let me make these suggestions: 1. ALWAYS use light colored cookie sheets - I like the "air-bake".  They will always give you great results for evenly baked cookies, no more burnt bottoms!  2.  400F is WAY to high a temp for cookies; reduce to 375F and bake these for about 8-9 minutes for perfect results.  3. Do not let the cookies sit on the cookie sheet for more than a minute, cool them on a wire rack - if they last that long!

Very nice recipe.  I halved the cream of tartar, but otherwise left it alone. **Update: I am a culinary student, externing at a high-end restaurant, my Chef is one of the contestants from a past season of "Top Chef" and he said that these cookies "are like CRACK, they are so wonderfully addictive".  I'd say that bumps it up to 5 stars.

This is the same recipe as the one in Betty Crocker's 1960's classic "Cooky Book," the same one my mother had as a teenager and that I baked from in the 80's. My 6-year-old picked these out for us to make together today.  I'd rate them five-stars on the nostalgia value alone, but they turned out to be delicious, slightly chewy with crisp edges, just as I remembered.  The only thing I might do differently next time is add a bit of vanilla to the cake dough when I mix in the eggs, no more than 1/2 tsp should do the trick to make the dough a bit richer.  My daughter loved them, too, and had fun rolling out the balls and rolling them around in the cinnamon-sugar!

I made these yesterday and they came out really yummy! I used butter instead of shortening, added 2 tsp of vanilla and only added 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar, like several other reviewers did, as well as 1/2 tsp of salt instead of 1/4 tsp like the recipe says. I was half way through making these when I realized I barely had any cinnamon. :( So, I ended up just using nutmeg and sugar to coat the balls of dough in and they still came out really yummy! My dough was a bit wet when I first made it (I think this was because i had my butter sitting out for too long) so I just popped the dough in the fridge for awhile (about 15 mins) and then made the dough into balls and baked. They flattened out nicely (not too flat, mind you) and they are soft and chewy~the perfect snickerdoodle! :) The next time I make these however, I'm going to use more cinnamon! hehe :P

These are pretty good, but not the best ones I've had. I used Butter Flavored shortening for more flavor. 

CHILL THE DOUGH WELL BEFORE YOU ROLL THE COOKIES and they will not be as flat. It lets the fats solidify before baking and helps a lot.

Fantastic recipe!!! I make it all the time and have become famous for it among friends.  I do make some changes though, for personal taste:

replace shortening with butter
use 1 c. light brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar
add about a tsp vanilla
add Hershey's Cinnamon Chips

I've made this recipe several times already. The first few times I've made it with butter instead of shortening and 1 tsp of vanilla.

Then, I started to divide the batter into two portions with half the batter with 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and the other portion of the batter with 1/2 tsp of almond extract. 
Every time it has turned out AMAZING.

I just cooked the last batch with butter flavor shortening (instead of the butter) and I didn't like them at all. I would def. recommend using butter instead. The cookies have a better texture and taste this way. I felt that when using shortening the cookies are tasteless and get hard quicker.

These went over so well that I'll have to make more before Christmas! I added a tsp. of vanilla to the recipe, and chilled the dough for 20 minutes before rolling it into balls.

These turned out really well- which is pretty amazing considering I ran out of sugar (only discovered this right after I got back from the grocery store with butter) and made them with gluten free flour. I think it speaks to the flexibility of both this recipe and snickerdoodles in general. I ended up using 1/2 cup of normal sugar and 1 1/4 cup of powdered sugar, and 3 cups of Pamela's baking Mix instead of the AP flour. Turned out great, thanks for the recipe... sorry I kind of bastardized it.

I omitted the cream of tartar and instead of rolling the dough in the sugar mixture, I sprinkled it on top.  It made them more like sugar cookies with cinnamon, but they turned out soft and fluffy with good flavor.

excellent snickerdoodles, just like ina made in Sweden.  just be very careful not to over bake these, as they can quickly go very crispy.

These were not only easy, they looked "fancy" and tasted great!  (The bigger you make them, the longer they stay chewy).  We made big & small and the smalls got a little hard after a day or  two, but the bigger ones tasted fresh.

This is a great recipe. I made a few changes. I used half the shortening and added butter to substitute for the other half. I also added a teaspoon (for 1/2 recipe) of nutmeg and the same amount of baking powder as baking soda. When the recipe says to blend the egg well, blend the egg WELL. I didn't do this the first time and it makes a huge difference.

These cookies were amazing!  They came out perfectly!  I didn't have any cream of tartar so I substituted 4 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder for the cream of tartar and baking soda.

This is a easy recipe and the cookies have a nice flavor - not very sweet. I made a mistake by not putting in the cream of tartar and my cookies came out hard as rocks. Turns out the cream of tartar is what keeps the sugar from crystalizing and making the cookies hard, so you definitely don't want to skip that ingredient! ;)

Alrighty, I tried this recipe again. First, I increased the oven to 410 degrees (a lot of high altitude baking must be increased by approx. 25 degrees). I used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter. After the first pan spread out way too thin, I made the balls of dough about half the size of the original - definitely not the size of a walnut - and tried again. And I pressed down ever so much with the bottom of a glass to flatten. The smaller size really worked much better for me and the glass-flattening cannot be skipped. With the red and green colored sugar mixed with cinnamon, they are just beautiful. My husband grabbed one of them yesterday evening (making the cookie nearly two days old) and said they were nice and chewy. I stored them in the new Reynolds Handy Vac vacuum sealed storage bags which can have the air removed from the bag for optimum food freshness. I'll stop sounding like a commercial now & say that I would make this cookie again.

Yummy, yummy.  Crispy AND chewy.  Just right!  I followed the suggestions to bake for only 8 minutes, and to use 3T sugar & 3t cinnamon for the coating, and they turned out perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe.

These flattened out more than I'm used to for snickerdoodles.  Also, they were quite crisp. If you like them really crisp, then I suppose that's fine.  I like mine a little bit softer.  Not the recipe for my taste.

I only gave this recipes 4 stars because I changed a few things just for my preference.  I do not like using shortening in any recipes, so I used butter  and 2 tsp vanilla.  I omitted the  cream of tartar completely since I like my cookies softer (as others suggested).  The dough was sticky so I put the bowl in the refrigerator, much easier to roll into balls. They turned out awesome, definitley will be making again.

I followed the directions exactly, and the over all flavor was decent, but the dough was so dry that it was nothing but crumbles, and I ended up adding another egg.

They tasted pretty amazing, although a little too salty.  Next time I may try cutting back on the salt a little bit.  They spread out and flattened more than I thought they were going to.  And my "small walnut size" was more like meatball size.  oops!  But overall, a delectable cookie!

Sensational cookies!!  I did do one cup unsalted butter instead of the shortening.  I used 1/2 tsp. of salt, and 1 1/2 tsp. of cream of tartar. I did not sift the flour.  Such good flavor!  I will definitely be making these again. :)

These were delicious!  Thank you!  I did change a couple of things, though.  I didn't have shortening, so I used real butter and then left out the salt.  I also added a tsp. of vanilla.  This is the first time I made Snickerdoodles without buying the premade dough and they came out perfect!

These cookies are very good, I have made them for years. I cook mine for 11 minutes, so the edges are crispy and the centers chewy. I add the cinnamon to the dough so they have a more stronger cinnamon taste. Two teaspoons of vanilla is also nice.

Loved this recipe.  I followed it exactly through the first time, and modified it the second time around.  I found rolling the cookies in the cinnamon/sugar left a bit of a burnt sugar taste on the bottom, and a bit crispier than I had hoped.  I ended up dipping the tops and sides in it, but leaving the bottom part out.  I baked them at 375 for 9 minutes, and they came out perfectly soft and yummy.  Thanks for the recipes and suggestions!!!

delicious and soft.  i followed the recipe exactly.  mine didn't stick and i was even able to roll them in the sugar/cinnamon completely.  i did flatten them slightly before baking.  they won't brown on the top, so don't wait for that--check the bottom.  that might be why some people are ending up with burning problems.

I never made snickerdoodle cookies before and I believe this is the best tasting cookie I have ever had. Once you mix all the ingredients and have your batter, I noticed it was very dry and unable to make a ball. I added about 1/2 stick of chilled butter and mixed it on the mixing setting on my mixer. This helped to make the batter less flaky/dry. It was so easy to roll the balls into the cinnamon sugar mix. I would bake this for about 9 minutes and let sit on a baking rack. I slightly overbaked mine for 13 minutes and the cookie became really hard, yet softer in the middle. This makes a great cookie with milk or to dip in tea.

I made these last Christmas and will be baking them again this year. They were excellent! I probably ate half of them before I even arrived at the party I was attending. I agree with the previous review - dipping the tops instead of rolling the entire cookie in sugar is the way to go. Enjoy!

Absolutely the best! I've been searching for a snickerdoodle recipe that made thicker cookies and I've found it! The only extra I added was vanilla. I did not chill the dough, there was no need to. Easy to get off the cookie sheet and crispy on the outside while being chewy on the inside. Perfect!

Just finished baking these, using butter, and they are the best!  I used a 3/4 oz ice-cream-type scoop to make the balls and actually got 36 cookies from this batch.  I'll be making them again - very soon!

First of all, this recipe is very good.  It is easy and has good results.  Half of them I rolled in cinnamon/sugar as directed and the other half I added a little nutmeg to the cinnamon/sugar.  It made them even better, if you like nutmeg.

Delicious! Cook just a little less time if you want chewier cookies.  Moisty and chewy with just the right crunch on the outside.

I just made these and the are amazingly easy and delicious! I followed other reviewers advice- used butter and baked them at 375 for 9 minutes. The came out perfect! I believe my cookie curse has been lifted as I made these to perfection. Normally I cannot bake cookies if my life depended on it. Ever. I will defintely make these again to hand out with Christmas cards to family and friends. Happy Baking!!

Fantastic recipe. So easy and delicious. My only addition was 2 TSP of vanilla. The cookies come out soft and chewy and perfect.

Perfect recipe. I followed suggestion of others and substituted butter for the shortening. I also used half the cream of tartar and added 1 tsp of vanilla. I did bake them about 12 minutes, possibly b/c of the reduced cream of tartar. They turned out perfectly!

If you look at snickerdoodle recipes they're all about the same.. so of course they're all delicious.  The main differences seem to be shortening versus butter, temperature ranges from 350-400, and servings.. usually 24-36.  I didn't have shortening so I used butter (some would say that I ruined them by doing that.. I think they're great though).  I also added some vanilla.. not sure if it made a difference or not.  I think cooking at 400 is the key.. I followed another recipe that said 350 and made sure not to overcook and they still weren't as good.  Then I upped it to 400 and they were much better.. a little crunchy on the outside and just lightly done/soft on the inside (mine sank in a little when cooked for 7 minutes or so.. which to me was perfect).  Thanks so much

Just like Grandma use to make.  One word of caution. The cinnamon/sugar mixture at the end has a strange ratio when it comes to color.  The end resulting cookie looked entirely too brown and not nicely dusted as in the picture.

This cookies were great but I did make a few changes. I used butter instead of shortening. If your cookies do turn out to hard you can put a piece of bread in the container and it will soften them up. I also would only cook 8-9 minutes if you want softer cookies. But they were great and the kids enjoyed helping make them.

Very yummy cookies. I have made these with the exact recipe and with adding about 1/3 cup crushed almond slivers. Both very good. Nice recipe and easy to follow. If your cookies end up too flat/runny just add a bit more flour and soda.

These cookies are AWESOME!  I've been making them for years using this exact same recipe.  I do also add 1 tsp. almond extract which gives it a slightly different flavor.  I prefer to undercook them just a tad so it produces a softer cookie. Yum!

This recipe is actually from Betty Crocker's Best-Loved Cooky Treasures-  (yes, that’s how they spelled “cookie”) an out of print paperback they published in 2005 which was a republish from 1963.    The shortening and the cream of tartar are the essential ingredients. Don't mess with these by substituting or changing the quantities.  The cream of tartar gives them an airiness.  And the shortening it what makes the cookies very tender.

Made as written. Perfect cookie except it had a strong shortening taste. I will either add cinnamon to the batter or change to half butter half shortening as some reviews suggested.

The were much much better than the "lighter snickerdoodle" recipe. And these only have 8 more calories....couldn't think of any reason not to make these. Anyway, 8 minutes at 400 was a bit too long...the bottoms burned, and I only dipped the top half of the cookie in the sugar/cinnamon mixture. Thank you for posting, I will be making these again.

I found these a little boring. They LOOKED like they were going to turn out perfectly when they were in the dough ball stage but they didn't. The sugar wasn't thick enough, the crust on top. The cookies were sort of flat. Disappointing :(

You know, sometimes when you're older you realize that some things you used to love doesn't taste as good as you remember. But this is not one of those things for me at all. I smelled when they were baking that they were going to be just as good as I remembered them and they were :)

These are great; I recommend making them a little bigger than suggested and also don't bake them quite as long.  Take them out before you think they are done so they stay chewy for a few days (unless you prefer crispier cookies, of course).

I liked these, and so did my mom and boyfriend. The only thing I didn't like was the aftertaste the shortening left in my mouth, perhaps I'll try using butter next time.

These seemed to be a little flatter than recipes I tried before.  I used butter instead of shortening and added vanilla.  I think the vanilla took away from the classic taste of a snickerdoodle.  Also baked for 11 minutes.  The first batch seemed a little soft.

I made these for my dad and he said they were the best snickerdoodles he's ever had! I used one recipe and they were disgusting. It was clumpy and unappetizing. Thank goodness for allrecipes.com! I didn't have cream of tartar so I used baking powder instead and they were marvelous. Great recipe!

My son and I must made these, and they are very good.  We used butter flavored Crisco and added a teaspoon of vanilla. Also we cooked them at 375 for 9 minutes.  I am sure we will be making these again.

These are very yummy!  My six yr. old told me better than his favorite, homemade chocolate chip cookies.  Big praise.  I did use half regular sugar & half Splenda.  I also used half butter & half shortening.  I added 1/2 tsp. extra cinnamon to the dry ingredients, too.
To hasten the cooking process I baked in convection oven at 350 so I could do two trays at once.  They took about 9 mins.
This is a keeper recipe.

These cookies are amazing and they really do stay soft for a long amount of time! I have made them two years in a row for Christmas and my family loves them. Don't skimp on the sugar and cinnamon topping...it makes the cookie! :)

I made these for my Uncle as thanks when he fixed my bike, they were tasty and quick. I didn't use as much sugar as it called for but I think that actually made it taste better.I'm in school right now so I don't have a lot of dishes (only one baking pan) so I tried to cook some in my muffin tray. Learn from my mistake and don't try it, the ones from the muffin tray didn't cook evenly and had to be thrown out. Bummer!

I used 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C shortening, it was pretty good.  They came out a bit puffy, and were best cooked at 375.

My daughter tasted snickerdoodles made at her school and requested that we make them.  These taste great!  Next time, we will either make bigger cookies, shorten the cooking time, or lower the temp as they were a little crunchy for her taste.

Made an absolutely delicious cookie. Followed recipe except for using 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c shortening. Baked at 400 for 9 minutes and results are soft and chewy middles with crispy edges. Yummy.

Excellent recipe. Once I made it a few times, I started experimenting with it and found it was even better with 1/2 tsp of vanilla added.  I have even done half butter, half shortening which while good is very rich.

This is the recipe my grandmother used which made me originally fall in love with snickerdoodles. I don't have cream of tartar on hand normally so I look for recipes without, but this recipe turns out slightly soft, slightly light, and delicious cookies.

Yumm-o. I tweaked the recipe and used whole wheat flour (which I've been using for lots of stuff lately,) and instead of shortening I used 1/2 cup reduced fat butter and 1/2 cup coconut oil. I'm sure they taste less indulgent than the original, but a bit healthier, and my 3 year old can't tell the difference! :)

These cookies turned out great!  Based on other reviews and some of my preferences, I made the following changes: (1) I used only 1-1/2t cream of tarter; (2) dipped only the tops of the cookies in cinnamon/sugar before cooking; (3) added 1-1/2t vanilla (vanilla make cookies even better!); (4) used only 2 cups of whole wheat flour.  Scrumptious!!!!!

PERFECT old fashioned snickerdoodle....exactly what you think of when you think of this cookie. Like other reviewers, I used butter instead of shortening. I assume they'd be chewier with the shortening...mine were fluffier inside, but still got crisp on the outside.

As another reviewer said, I also just dipped the tops of the cookies into the sugar/cinnamon mixture rather than the entire cookie. My cookies didn't spread much in baking so I could flatten them a bit and sprinkle extra sugar mixture on top as well. 

Easy, yummy recipe I'll definitely use again.

Very good, wouldn't change anything in the recipe. For easiest baking, use parchment paper lined sheets or a Silpat. Cookies slide right off.

Snickerdoodles are my son's favorite cookie.  I have searched many bakeries to find the best ones and haven't found many that pass the test.  Last week my daughter came across this recipe and gave it a try.  Oh my gosh!  These are the best cookies ever!  They were simple to make too.  I am amazed at how good they turned out since bakeries can't seem to do this well.  Awesome cookies!!!

These have really good flavor...however, like a couple other people have suggested, I would bake for less time or same time at a lower temperature. I baked these for 8 minutes at 400 degrees and they turned out slightly harder than I like.

Wow... these cookies are just extraordinary. I substituted 1/4 of the cup of shortening with margarine to get a more buttery flavor to the cookies and it worked perfectly without being overwhelming. We'll see what happens once they've been cooling for a while, but for now it's a definite A+! I'll make these many times in the future!

I just made this recipes and I did not like it at all, which is dissapointing because I love these cookies... I have a recipes binder composed of family/friends recipes, my own, and recipes collected and I only keep ones I like, and I had to remove this recipe.  I do bake and cook, the only thing that might have affected this recipe is that I used crisco shortening, butter flavor... The dough lacked flavor, so it tasted like a flavorless cookie with toppings of cin/sugar.I am still in search the best snickerdoddle cookie recipe.

Yummy!! I turned the oven down to about 375 and took them out after 10 minutes after leaving the first batch in too long and burning them :/ These are great and easy to make. Had to stop myself from eating them all as they came out of the oven!!!

Delicious and picture perfect as well.  I didn't have cream of tartar so I left it out and added 1 tsp lemon juice.  They turned out great anyway!

the recipe should have called for vanilla extract.  maybe that would have made it a little bit sweeter.  beside the need for vanilla the cookies were very soft, moist and delicious

Love this recipe.  Only thing I did to alter it was instead of shortening I used butter.  FABULOUS! I also made a double batch and got about 5 dozen that way.  I used a melon baller to measure per ball so it's not like my cookies were all that big.

These are the best Snickerdoodles ever.... The only thing that I changed was I reduced the oven temp to 375 and baked them for 8 and a half minutes!! They were perfect.My husband that does not like these cookies said that he liked them now!!

Soft, slightly chewy, and SO FLUFFY! I love this recipe!   I have made several times and have the following tips: I always double the recipe. adding an extra 1/4 t of salt improves taste. I suppose you could add 1/8th to the regular batch.   Cream the shortening/sugar mixture really well (I do for 4-5 minutes on medium mixer speed), add one egg at a time and don't add the next one until the previous is fully incorporated.   Butter flavored crisco gives the best texture to the cookie, and they keep chewy and soft for so much longer. Normally I wouldn't use crisco and would use unsalted butter, but these are SO much better with!  Tonight I decided to do a 50:50 mixture of cardamom:cinnamon. It was delicious! Such a nice, different taste with the same snickerdoodle sourness. Yum!

These are my absolute favorite cookie!! I used the basic recipe but did as suggested by others and used all butter. The one thing I did differently was to keep the dough refrigerated in between batches which made it alot easier to handle..Thanks for a great recipe!!

I love this recipe and so does my husband!  Instead of using shortening I used butter.  The cookies came out just right and they were soft.  I'll be making them again real soon.

I was very pleased with this recipe.  I wanted a softer cookie so I went 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening and they turned out just the right mix of crisp/soft.  The flavor is really good. I did chill the dough for about 15 minutes.  I baked on 325, but I always do for any cookies unless the recipe calls for a lower temp.  I baked using  four cookie sheets so I always am loading the cookie dough onto cool sheets.

Excellent recipe, just like the one my grandmother made during the depression. I did make some small adjustments; I add 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of butter flavoring OR just use butter flavored crisco.   Make sure not to overbake! These are a HUGE hit and everyone loves them. They are also VERY cheap to make and are a great treat when your wallet is tight.

This recipe was fantastic! Everyone in my neighborhood loved the cookies. One change I made was to cut out the shortening in exchange for a mixture of milk and olive oil.  The cookies were moist and sweet.  For sure I will make this again!

These were great and will be made again and again!  I took some of the other reviewers advise and made them with the following changes: (1) cooked them for 9 minutes at 375 degrees F; (2) used unsalted butter instead of shortening; (3) used 1 teaspoon of vanilla and only a half teaspoon of the cream of tartar, and (4) only used 1/8 teaspoon of salt.

i made these for a big party and they were a hit. my version was made vegan friendly by substituting 1/2 cup of applesauce for the eggs, and 1/2 cup of grapeseed oil for the shortening. absolutely fabulous!

I used butter in place of shortening and baked at 375.  I found that the cookies needed a bit more time at this temperature, about 10 mins.  Also, I think it's important to note that these spread a lot!  I made the mistake of leaving too little space between so definitly follow that step!

I did not add vanilla and these were delicious! I rolled them in the sugar/cinnamon mix and used silpats on my baking sheets and did not have to worry about sugar burning yet got all the flavor from rolling them, not just dipping the tops.

Every year I make each family member's favorite cookies.  I had not mastered this recipe yet. But because this was the favorite cookie shared by two of them I kept trying new recipes. This was the winner. They fought over how many each received. Thanks, and I don't think I would change anything.

Amazingly quick and easy.  These turned out perfect on my first try.  I used butter flavored shortening and added a few drops of vanilla, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I rolled all the dough first, then put the cinnamon and sugar in a plastic bag and shook each dough ball in the cinnamon and sugar bag (sometimes 2-3 at a time).  I cooked them for exactly eight minutes each, then left them on the pan to cool for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack and they turned out perfect.  Only problem is that they were so delicious I at half the batch!

wonderful recipe! I hadn't made snickerdoodles in years, and these came out great! The recipe is so easy and I had all the ingredients on hand.  Will definitely be a part of my Christmas baking this year.

Excellent cookies - my favourite!!

My husband did not care for these as he is into more "rich" cookies like peanut butter or chocolate chip, but I thought these were great. They are light and have just the right amount of sweetness to them. This is the third time I've made them and will make them again!

I use butter instead of shortening and dip the tops in the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  All in all a very good recipe for my favourite cookies.

This was an easy recipe and the cookies tasted great!  I did as another review said and used 1 cup of butter instead of shortning. My husband said these are the best snickerdoodle cookies he has ever eaten and he is a seasoned pro!

I love making cookies when I get bored, and I can make these with ingredients I always have in the pantry.  I use extra cream of tartar because I like the extra kick.  You should try adding butterscotch chips too...my co-workers loved it!

I just baked batch of these cookies and found them to be easy to make and delicious. If done properly the cookies come out lightly sweet and they sipoly melt in your mouth. They're perfect for any occasion.

These cookies are great! Very easy and quick to put together, but with a very satisfying taste. Per other reviews, I baked at 375 for 8 to 10 minutes and got a soft, chewy cookie. 1 batch made about 3 dozen.

Perfect! I had tried several other snickerdoodle recipes trying to get it right because I love these, but they were always too flat and not right. I found this recipe and my husband goes on and on about how good they are. I have made them a couple of times and always used the recipe just as it is written. Thank you.

This has a really weird aftertaste. I followed directions to a T. I’ve never used cream of tartar or crisco before. Maybe that was it? Not very sweet.

This recipe is great!! I did make a few tweaks though. I separated the dough into threebowls and colored each one a different color. I rolled out the dough and made a log. I then sliced the dough before dipping in the  cinnamon  sugar mix. To let the color show, I added less cinnamon and more sugar. I will make this again!

so yummy! I used a butter flavored crisco stick because I didn't have regular shortening or a regular crisco stick. Tasted perfect.

This Snickerdoodle recipe produces a light,  tan-colored cookie with just an ever-so-slight crunch on the outside and a great chewy inside.  I had no cream of tartar and looked up a replacement.  My choice was baking powder, and these turned out perfectly.

Dont like this recipe much.  Doesnt spread well.  Burns on the bottom before they're done in the middle if you follow it exactly.  Flattened the second batch down some instead of leaving them in balls.  Had to throw out the first batch.

These are delicious - and my friends and family think I'm a genius when I make them.  They rarely last a day in the cookie jar. Only change I made was use butter instead of shortening.

It was my first time making snickerdoodles so obviously it was not perfect. Mine turned out a little dry but my batter was dry in the first place and I don’t know what happened. So after I baked them of course they were dry but I will definitely make them again and try to figure out my mistake:)

Great recipe! Taking out the cookies when formed but soft was good advice, as they harden to have a nice crunch. The cinnamon/sugar mix was the perfect amount for the cookies.

My family loved this cookie but my oven runs hot so I had to adjust the temperature after the first batch. I also wish they could have been a little softer.

Really Awesome Flavor. I left them in the oven a tad too long and they were Really Crunchy. The Required time should be fine.. I went another 4 minutes due to an distraction.

Some one i know loves snickerdoodle cookies so i was trying to find the BEST recipe so i could make it for her as a present, and I found it right here! you have to try this! I only put the sugar on the top of the cookies so the bottom would not burn as much and i made sure not to go even a minute over the time because when it cools it will harden some. :) You HAVE to try this recipe!!!

This recipe was good but the dough itself could have used a little cinnamon . My husband’s comment was, “this cookie basically tastes like a sugar cookie rolled in cinnamon sugar.”

First of all,  I used half a cup of butter and half a cup of vegetable oil instead of shortening. The dough was extremely oily, it takes forever to wash your hands afterwards and the result tasted horrible. I would recommend 3/4 a cup of shortening and no cream of tartar (I haven't tried this so I'm sorry for any bad results).

These cookies were a hit with my dairy-free family. I even got a request for a birthday from a non-dairy-free cousin! I'm thinking of making these for my grandfather who's favorite cookie is the snickerdoodle, but with butter. Thanks for a great recipe!

I am an experienced baker and have a side baking business. This review is a compilation of the suggestions that I follow based on my experience and reading through many of the reviews.  These are the changes I make.  I use half shortening and half butter.  Sugar to cinnamon ratio for rolling 3 to 1 sugar to cinnamon (they look like the picture).  I add 1 tsp of vanilla , I roll them a little bigger than a walnut and flatten by half with a glass.  In order to determine baking time, (it can change based on your oven, temperature of your dough, and size of your cookie.  I chill my dough for at least a day.  Do a test cookie, I tested mine and 9 minutes was perfect.  They may look a little wet in cracks but cool perfectly for me.  The cookies are amazing.

I made a bit of a change and added a bit more baking soda & cream of tartar
it seemed to get them to "crackle" more and keep their shape ... and not spread too much
was very happy with how they turned out

A great recipe. I've not made any cookies in years. My wife loves snickerdoodles so I gave this one a try. They were easy to make. I used half real butter and half chilled coconut oil. I recommend letting the dough rest  by chilling it for 30minutes or longer in the fridge.   I also weighted out each cookie ball so They would be uniform. At 8 minutes baking they were soft and chewy. At 9 minutes they had a bit of crunch. We prefer softer so I baked the remainder at 8 minutes. This recipe made 36 nice size cookies. I will definitely start making them often.

I've found that putting 1/2 T. of vanilla, 1 tsp of allspice, 1 tsp of freshly ground nutmeg, 1/2 T. of cinnamon in the dough, and replacing the shortening with butter make these even better! If you want to make them a little healthier, reduce the butter by 1/8. The cookies still turn out perfectly. I made these for the first time in Jr. High School for a foods class and have been making them ever since. By far my favorite Snickerdoodle recipe.

This recipe is awful! It only calls for 2 T of sugar???? I saw in a review about vanilla? There is no vanilla in the recipe? Complete waste of time!!! Someone needs to go to the original recipe and fix the ingredients.

This is a really good snickerdoodle recipe! Snickerdoodles are my favorite cookie, and this recipe certainly delivered. I didn't have any shortening, so I used unsalted butter instead. Otherwise, I didn't make any changes to the recipe. I baked them for 8 minutes, and they turned out absolutely perfectly! Thanks so much for these awesome cookies!

These are delicious!  I did follow another reviewer's advice and just dip the top of the dough in the cinnamon and sugar mix.   I also used half butter-half shortening.  Will definitely make these again!

I have made many snickerdoodles before and I have to say this is a pretty good recipe. Honestly thought  I would substitute the 1 cup of shortening for 1 cup of butter unless you like you snickerdoodles crispy. I will definitely use this recipe again in the future.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. The cookies came out magical. Something that I ignored, but is actually important, is the spacing between the balls. I thought it didn't need that much space, but when I took them out, it was like one giant Snickerdoodle. SPACE THEM. Also, if you do not have cream of tartar on hand, use four teaspoons of lemon juice. Works great.

These turned out great. I followed some advice from the reviews (only 1 tsp. cream of tartar, adding 1 tsp. vanilla, baked at 375 for about 8 min.) and they were just about perfect. I also sprinkled more cinnamon/sugar on the cookies right after baking so more would stick. Will most definitely makes this again :-)

These cookies are awesome! Everyone loved them. They are light, soft and sweet. They practically disappeared. I made a few substitutions, I used butter instead of shortening like a lot of reviewers did, and I used Baking powder instead of the baking soda and cream of Tartar ( I didn't realize I had run out of the soda.... oops).

This is my favorite snickerdoodle recipe with 1 small change. I use a 1/2 cup of butter and a 1/2cup of shortening (from the Betty Crocker Cooky book). My coworkers and family are always asking when I'll make them again!

I used unsalted butter instead of shortening, but otherwise followed the directions. I have made them twice now and mine are always fluffy and awesome (and that doesn't usually happen for me!). I brought them into work and they were gone in 10 minutes.

These cookies were delicious, although, they were flat as a pancake.

they were ok. I was looking for a more soft snickerdoodle so maybe this wasn't the recipe for me. Plus I personally think that it needs more cinnamon or something.

These cookies are delicious. My only recommendation is to increase the amount of cinnamon that is used to roll the dough balls in, but I like a lot of cinnamon. Overall, very very good!!!

We love snickerdoodles in our house!  This recipe is very good--I use half butter and half shortening because my cookies always come out very flat.  I thought this might help with that issue.  It didn't.  I cannot make a fluffy snickerdoodle for the life of me!  I also cut back on the cream of tartar because hubby likes them softer.  Thank you for this recipe!

These cookies are awesome! Instead of shortening, I used salted butter and the baking time wasn't even quite 8 minutes (knock off a minute or close to two). I took it out the oven for about six minutes and just let it cool out. When I did it for 8 to 9 minutes the bottom of the cookies were too dark, so the second batch I kept a close eye on them. Definitely will make again in the future.

Perfect and foolproof recipe, even for the somewhat baking-challenged like myself.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of one thing...I used half butter and half shortening, only because that was what I had on hand.  These are the best snickerdoodles I have ever made, and my daughter, a snickerdoodle afficionado, totally agreed!

Wow!  Hold on, I can't type right now because I'm stuffing cookies in my face. Okay, I used regular shortening as directed.  I bought it special for this recipe before I read the reviews that some people had used butter.  So, I went ahead and used it.  I added about 3/4 a cap full of vanilla.  Just because.  No idea what that turns out to.  Maybe 1/8 tsp?  A little extra salt only because I used the wrong measuring spoon.  Not an overly skilled chef.  I found the dough dry and crumbly.  It was making me fairly cranky.  I squished a ball of dough together, rolled it around the cinn-sugar and dropped it on a parchment lined cookie sheet. I might have made them bigger than the recipe said to.  I like cookies.  Bigger must be better.  Baked them at 375 for the first tray for 8 minutes, expecting to give them more time.  Just wanted to keep an eye on them.  With two minutes to go, they still looked like cinnamon dough balls.  I was not happy.  But, I let them bake for another, maybe 6 minutes  (checking on them every two minutes) and they turned into the most beautiful, perfectly shaped darlings!  Crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside.  Little packages of nummy goodness.  Second tray, I bumped up the heat to 400 and made them smaller.  I think they took about 11 minutes. Head change didn't seam to make a difference.  These are the ultimate, perfect Snickerdoodle. Nicely crackled on top.  Perfect texture.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

I am a cookie dough eater (I know, horrible) so when I tried the dough it wasn't that good.  But I was surprised when the actual cookies turned out great.  Light, sweet, and beautiful coloring.  Makes a great Christmas cookie

Quick, easy and yummy!  I made these today and am so happy I did. I followed the directions exactly and the cookies came out light, fluffy and full of cinnamon/sugar goodness - without tasting overly "eggy" (like some snickerdoodles can). I will be using this recipe again.  Thank you for sharing N. Drew!

Great recipe! I used butter instead of shortening and refrigerated the dough for 20 minutes before baking. I did not roll as I have cookie scooper and sprinkled cinnamon sugar.

Added vanilla and less cream of tartar (because I only had about a tsp).  Turned out YUMMY!  My 8 year old daughter helped roll the cookies and dip in sugar & cinnamon.  She says they are her new favorite!

Superb! This year's Dixon Featured Xmas Cookie. (We gave as gifts in cute chinese take out boxes) HUGE hit, everyone enjoyed. :) When cooked right, these decadent little crispy on the outside, soft cakey goodness on the inside, and just the right combination of rich butter flavor with the cinnamon sugar cookies are hard to beat- with that said, don't over cook! As soon as you see the light browing, they're done. YUM!

*Also used butter instead of shortening; excellent tip!!!

I was ready to complain about the cookies until I realized that I forgot the baking powder. My oppsie. Anyway, they're delicious. I added vanilla and brown sugar to the batter, and I put brown sugar in the mix for the topping. They are delicious, they just have a weird texture because I forgot to add the baking powder (which I always substitute for powder and tartar.)

I affectionately call this my Paige recipe because I went into labor with her while cooking these cookies and instead of leaving them at home I fed the entire hospital with them while I spent my days in prenatal care. Lovely memories.

These are one of the best Snickerdoodle Cookies I have ever made. I think I cooked mines a little bit too long but it came out to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Very nice recipe!

Good cookies, I used butter flavored crisco which gave them a mellow buttery flavor. Also reduced the cream of tarter to 1 1/2tsp and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla excellent results!!!

Great recipe. They turned out crunchier than I would like so I cooked them a second time @ 350 instead of 400 degrees for 11 min and they were soft and great!

This is the snickerdoodle I remember from childhood!!  Perect just as written.  I bake some so they are soft, but I like mine crunchy so my second tray is baked just a bit longer!

I made these today in my toaster oven!  It gets too hot to use the oven this time of year and I baked them at 400 in my toaster oven; it seemed to take twice the time but they were wonderful!  I used butter instead of oil and they were great!

These are simply fabulous! The perfect combo of crispy outside and soft inside! I did 375 for 9 minutes, or just until they cracked. Thank you for this recipe! This is going in the safe-keep box! :)

The perfect little cookie! I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, and omitted the cream of tartar. Exactly 8 minutes gave me the perfect texture.  Yumm!

This is a really good recipe for snickerdoodle cookies. Like other people, I substituted shortening for 1 cup of butter, I used 1/2 teaspoon of salt and I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla. Also I baked them at 375 degrees.  The cookies came out perfect. I'm not quite sure what others are talking about regarding the mix being dry and the cookie crumbling???I did not experience that at all.  My family loves them. I will definitely keep this recipe around!!!!!

This was absolutely perfect. The only change I made was add a teaspoon of vanilla and I used butter-flavored Crisco. I also baked these at 375* for eight minutes, which gave me a soft, chewy Snickerdoodle. I am so thrilled with this recipe. EXACTLY what a Snickerdoodle should be.

I give this 4 stars because I add 2 teaspoons of vanilla and it comes out perfect. give it a try. Unless you plan on making cookies the size of quarters. you will not get 5 dozen from this recipe.

These are my husband's favorite cookies.  I make the following adjustments when I make them: 1/4 cup less flour; 2 tablespoons extra butter and shortening; 1 tablespoon of vanilla, a few dashes of cinnamon, and a sprinkle of nutmeg to the batter.  I also lightly flatten the cookies with my palm and sprinkle extra cinnamon/sugar mix to the top as well as cooking them at a lower temp for longer because I make very big cookies.

When making Snickerdoodles I often use nutmeg in place of the cinnamon in the mixture to roll the dough. Yummy!!

These were great cookies!  I generally followed the recipe...though I had to use four tablespoons of butter because I didn't quite have enough shortening.  They turned out very well!

Used shortening as I had no butter, added vanilla and cut the cream of tartar in half (as per another review).  Great!  I experimented with the time on different batches.  Next time I will definitely stay at 375 for 9 minutes.  Part of the batch I rolled in purple decorative sugar and it added a nice crunch without the cookie itself being hard.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  This recipe is great.  I was looking for a very soft and chewy Snickerdoodle and these were fabulous!    The only changes I will make to this in future is a personal preference to have the cinnamon sugar coating a bit lighter on the cinnamon.  I took these to a church function and they were a big hit!

Love these cookies!  Easy and they look so wonderful.  They were gone so quickly at my house - which rarely happens.

My mother also used this recipie and it is my favorite cookie. At Christmas, my 4 children each used a different sugar (cinnamon, red, green, yellow) to roll their cookies in so they could tell their dad which ones they made.  I add vanilla to all my baked recipies if it is not one of the ingredients.  I bake them on a baking stone and leave them a little under cooked.  When I bring them out of the oven, I leave the cookies on the baking stone about 5 minutes.  They are always soft and I don't usually have left overs when taken to work. this is my comfort food.  It brings back memories of coming home from school to mom bringing out them out of the oven and a glass of milk waiting to wash them down.

Thought these were great!!  Didn't have any shortening, so I subed in butter instead... added some vanilla (1t.).  I got lazy and didn't sift together the flour, salt, CT, etc... but they still turned out good (a little flat, but great flavor).  Will definitely make these again!

This is identical to the recipe that has been in my family for over 50 years.  I'm afraid to NOT use shortening for fear they won't be the same.  These are wonderful and now I bake them for my parents since my mother can't make them anymore.

This is a nice, simple recipe that probably worked for many others. But about 1/2 of the batch of cookies were burnt and were as hard as hockey pucks. I would recommend to cook them at 375 degrees, not 400. Though the cookies (that weren't burnt were pretty good)

Delicious, but I found that after cooling they were slightly more crisp than I would have liked. I sealed them in a plastic bag to trap what moisture was left. They were overall pretty good. If you like a more chewy cookie (as opposed to the "cakey" texture of these) simply omit the cream of tartar.

made these on Christmas Eve. They turned out great! Used butter instead of the shortening. The cinnamon/sugar topping made too much though (there was a lot left over) But I saved the rest in a little shaker, for making Cinnamon Toast

I made a double batch last night (91 cookie yield) & they were fantastic!  I took the advice of other reviewers and made the following modifications:  1/2 butter, 1/2 butter-flavored Crisco; added 1 tsp vanilla; added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to batter; reduced oven to 375F and baked for 9 min.  Perfect!  They developed legs early on & disappeared before my eyes!

I made these cookies today for a cookie exchange party tomorrow.  So soft and chewy.  I followed several other people's advice and only used 1 teaspoon of cream of tartar and half shortening half butter and baked for 8 minutes.  Perfect!

There were delicious!!! Sooo good, and my first time making snickerdoodles.  My only concern was the consistency of the dough.  It was really dry and crumbly and hard to form into cookies.  It just seemed like there was too much flour.  Or I'm wondering if I didn't mix the shortening in well enough? In any case they taste awesome!!

Used butter flavored Crisco, which I think lent a weird sour/chemically aftertaste.  Never used it before & wanted to try it before holiday baking ensues.  The texture was great, though they didn't spread very much.  Probably will try another recipe next time.

Very easy recipe. The dough was easy to work with and they came out wonderful. I added some vanilla and nutmeg because I like the extra flavor. Baked them for 9 minutes. Thanks for the recipe.

I ended up having to use margarine instead of shortening and then chose to use half whole wheat flour and the cookies still turned out delicious. I can imagine how much better they would be with shortening! (I also added 1 tsp vanilla and a little cinnamon into the mix itself.)

Delicious!  I used butter in place of shortening and added a bit more flour to combat the stickies.  Absolutely perfect cookie!

Excellent! I'm a cinnamon lover so I added a teaspoon to the batter. I also did 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter-flavor Crisco. I will make these again!!

Awesome recipe! These cookies didn't have a fighting chance with my family. They didn't even hardly have time to cool off before they were gone.   I pretty much followed the recipe completely.  The only thing I did differently was I moisten the bottom of a medium glass and dipped it in the cinnamon/sugar mixture and flatten the cookie a little bit.  I baked my cookies with a stone cookie sheet and had no problems with sticking.  They baked evenly and had a nice soft but crunchy bite to them.

Yum-o! I did not have cream of tarter on hand, so I too omitted it.  After I blended all ingredients together, the batter seemed really runny! I added a tbspn of flour and chilled in the fridge for a few minutes, then just drop them by the teaspn on the cookie sheet.  Also, like others, baked at 375 for 9 minutes.

These stay soft forever!!! so yummy, perfect recipe! I used margarine instead of shortening, and cut out the salt (because it's in the margarine), but other than that I stayed true to recipe, and these cookies were wonderful! They're a hit wherever I take them!

I LOVE this recipe. Perfectly crispy and chewy without a gooey center.  Halfed the recipe. Used butter instead of shortening and 1/2 tsp of tartar.  Also made it EGGLESS substituting 1 tbsp flaxseed meal and 3 tbsp hot water (let sit, stirring occasionally for about 10 mins).

This recipe makes a dough that is easy to work with and good cookies. But they tasted like they were made with shortening, so next time I think I will follow other reviewers' suggestions to use real butter. Also, as per other reviewers, I baked at 375 for 9 minutes and they turned out perfect--soft and a little chewy. I think with real butter and the temp change these can be five stars.

This was my first time making snickerdoodles... also my first time eating them. They are awesome! I didn't have quite a cup of shortening so I added 1/4 cup butter and also a little vanilla, then drizzled a few of them with some icing after they were done. YUMMY... they tasted like cinnamon rolls. My husband and son loved them too. I will definitely make these again!

Great recipe. I made one batch with shortening and one with butter. Both were good but the shortening is more like what my husband and  I remember as kids. I left out the cream of tartar in both recipes. Great cookie to make and freeze (you can eat them right out of the freezer and they are great!).

I made mine with butter flavored shortening and thought it was toooooo rich.  My family didn't like it.  We tossed them.  However, the cookies looked marvelous and had great texture (first time, too); the flavor was off enough to make it unappetizing.  I suggest using regular shortening.

I was baking a different kind of cookie and realized I made a mistake in my portions of butter and sugar. I went online and tried to find a cookie that required the quantity of sugar and butter that I had just prepared. I came across this recipe. WOW!!! I'm I glad that I made that mistake. These cookies are absolutely delicious and it made my kitchen smell sooooo good. I will be giving these as a gift to my kids teachers.

I made my cookies bigger than walnuts. Added a 1/2 T vanilla to the batter. When I pulled them out of the oven they were nice and soft in the center. I followed the advice of others and only dipped one side of the cookie. Nice and Simple Cookies!

These were very good, the only thing I will do differently next time is just to dip the tops in the sugar mix to avoid burning the bottom.

very tasty.  i did not dip bottoms in sugar mix as recommended by a previous review, thus, no burned sugar on bottom.

Good cookies.I like my snickerdoodles to be a little more "cake" like and these flattened out.  I added a touch of vanilla and the taste was great!

My Mom and I used to make these cookies all of the time. It was always my favorite Christmas cookie.  The only problem with making them this way is that the dough is too soft to easily roll in the sugar.  We always let the dough sit in the fridge for about an hour before rolling it.  Takes it a little longer but makes it a lot easier.

they were VERY crispy, almost rock hard. i guess i'll add less cream of tartar next time. i suppose they weren't too bad, taste wise, though.

I have my grandmother's snickerdoodle recipe, which calls for butter... but I didn't have butter, so I searched for a recipe that called for shortening instead. They were sooooo bland! My advice: Search for a snickerdoodle recipe with butter- your tastebuds will thank you!

I really liked this recipe- Though instead of rolling the dough in cin/sugar mixture, I dipped them as a previous reviewer suggested. I also added about a 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla to the dough before dipping. Definitely going to do this one again!

Delicious! I worried that the cin./sugar mix would burn on the under side of the cookie like some of the reviews mentioned, but I did not have this problem. Very moist, chewy, and they received rave reviews from my co-workers.

these were ok, a little bland. We frosted them and put colored sprinkles on them, then the kids were a little more interested. I probably wouldn't make them again.

Excellent!  I have never made this kind of cookie so I have nothing to compare it to, but they are an excellent cookie regardless!! The only change I made was by using real butter instead of shortening.

These cookies turned out wonderful!  My roommate gobbled up almost the whole 1/2 batch I prepared.  I had to fiddle with the cooking time just a little bit on my oven to get the right balance of "crispy on the outside, soft/moist on the inside" -- no big deal -- every oven is a little bit different.  Another user suggested making the cookies a bit larger so that they stay softer longer -- I think this is a good suggestion and I plan to try it the next time I make these lovely things -- which would be now!

Yummy!!  Followed instructions of other posters - added some vanilla and used 1/2 tsp of salt instead of a quarter.  Baked at 375 for 8 minutes.  This is our first attempt at snickerdoodles and they're delicious!

These snickerdoodles were wonderful.  Simple ingredients, easy dough to handle, they came out of the oven looking like a picture and tasted even better! If you are a snickerdoodle lover, this is the recipe for you!!

These taste very good.  My problem is I baked them on convection bake for only eight minutes and they are too well done.  I turned my oven down to 375 on my last batch and those were better.  I will make these again but just on regular bake.

Great recipe!  Made them for the Christmas party at work.  They were gone before the end of the day.
