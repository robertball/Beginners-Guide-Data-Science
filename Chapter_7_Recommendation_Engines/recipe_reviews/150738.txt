I love this dressing. But like the other reviewer, that is alot of blue cheese.  I just added about 1/4 cup(eyeballed it), put it all in a blender for a few pulses, and I have to say, it is the best I've tasted.  Even my kids love it, and ask for it all the time.  Now I keep blue cheese in stock.  It is just ever so slightly sweet when you first taste it, then you get the nice tang following that, with the nice strong flavor of the cheese.  I have never cared for bottled dressing of any kind, I have always liked making my own because I like to be able to control the salt and sugar and it just is always nice and fresh.
I wonder if the recipe might have been a typo or something.  Maybe it meant to be a half a cup instead.  This is the only reason as to why I had to give it a 4 star.  I also like adding to it chopped candied walnuts, chopped bacon, and chopped granny smith apples.  It just doesn't get any better.

This is a great salad!  In a hurry and don't have time to make dressing?  Simply docter up bottled blue cheese dressing.  I add just a bit of red wine vinegar, milk, sugar and black pepper and it tastes pretty much the same as starting from scratch.  Also,as others suggested, real bacon bits really add to it.  My kids love this recipe.

Fabulous dressing! I cut the amount of blue cheese in half.  I love the tang from the red wine vinegar coupled with the sweetness from the sugar.  Definitely give it time for the flavors to come together (I did make it the night before). I did add some crumbled bacon and chilled the salad plates.

Years ago I made a similar salad.  I placed a wedge on each of 2 plates and they looked great.  I was so proud of my efforts. My husband began to eat and very soon found an angleworm lodged between the leaves.  My suggestion is that the lettuce head should be soaked in salt water for some time in order to remove unwanted seasonings.

My husband loved this and asked me to save the recipe.  I served grape tomatoes and omited the onion.  Next time I will add the onion and some applewood bacon crumbles.

This dressing was wonderful with half of the blue cheese--both in the dressing and on top of the salads (I think it would have been way too over-powering with all of the cheese in and on top of the salad!). I substituted whole milk b/c I didn't have any buttermilk and the dressing was definitely elegant and delicious!

Love this - I eat it every week for lunch sometimes for dinner too!  I use the blue cheese gorgonzola dressing - yum!  But I add a little water to the dressing to try to save some calories.

Excellent!  I made this as a surprise for my husband for his birthday with dinner, and he loved it.  The dressing was amazing!  We will no longer use store bought blue cheese!  Thanks for the great recipe!  UPDATE.....I made this again and it is just wonderful.  I wish more people knew about this recipe.

This was very good. I was trying to copy a wedge salad I ate a nice restaurant on a trip to Tennessee. I thought this pretty much tasted like it. I made 1/2 recipe, used all low-fat dairy, and cut the amount of blue cheese in half. Blue cheese is not only a little bit expensive, but the amount seemed excessive.  I made a mock buttermilk and for the vinegar I did 1/2 red and 1/2 white wine vinegar. I was worried the dressing would turn pink. For the onions, I just chopped them, and added a sprinkle to taste. ty

YUM!  The only difference I made instead was the "homemade" dressing, I used homemade Uncle Dan's dressing.  I also added some crumbled bacon.  Definately will be serving this one again.

Excellent!  I made this salad for four but, like others, cut the amount of blue cheese in half.  I also did not use onions, substituted chopped tomatoes with grape tomatoes (that way, if you don't like tomatoes at all, you can just push them to the side), and I also added crumbled freshly-cooked bacon.  My sister-in-law always orders this salad whenever it's on the menu of fine restaurants in Chicago, and she scarfed hers down saying "it was awesome"!  Thanks for a winning recipe!

The dressing was wonderful--except for my very spicy garlic (but that was my fault).  I added glazed walnuts and that mixed well with the blue cheese.  Will do again but will probably half the recipe (makes a little too much for my family to use up).

Well, I wasn't a fan of iceberg lettuce until now.  I only looked this recipe up to make it for my boyfriend.  After tasting the dressing the night that I made it,  I thought to myself that I should give iceberg another try. Since we had a half of head of lettuce left I made a salad for myself on night two.  DELICIOUS! I only used an 8oz container of bleu cheese and it was great!  Thanks for sharing!  We will definitely make again and again!

Delicious.  Pretty sure the dressing recipe means 1/2 a cup of blue cheese though instead of 1/2 a pound.  I used 1/4 cup and it was great.   The recipe made about two cups of dressing too, so those cooking for a smaller group may want to cut it in half. Applewood smoked bacon is a must on top of this salad though!

This was so delicious that I ate it again for breakfast the next morning! I only used 1/2 lb of blue cheese and I also added crumbled cooked bacon. This is the best way to eat iceberg lettuce. Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my gosh this is the best blue cheese dressing ever.  My husband who is super picky ate ALL of his salad.  This is a keeper and will never use store bought again!!!  I agree however about the amount of blue cheese.  I think it is definitely a typo.  I put in 1/2 cup and it was the perfect amount!!!

This was sooooo good. And easy to make. I mixed the dressing with a fork and that left nice big lumps of the blue cheese so I didn't have to use so many sprinkles of it later. I also chopped up a handfull of pecans to add a nice crunch. The dressing is better the second day so you might want to make it the day before.

I've made it the original way and love it.  But now, I HAVE STARTED REPLACING BOTH THE SOURCREAM AND MAYONNAISE WITH GREEK-STYLE YOGURT.  It tastes phenomenal, is much lower in fat and has a lot of protein!  This is the first recipe I've tried this with, and it's great!

This dressing is absolutely fantastic. I replaced the bleu cheese with gorgonzola (since gorgonzola is a mild form of bleu cheese). A keeper!

The dressing was delicious! I used gargonzola instead of blue cheese and it was perfect. Blue cheese would have been great as well. I also cut the vinegar in half.

I also happen to love the wedge salad from my favorite steak house and this dressing is about as close as you can get to the taste of that dressing.  I did change one thing since I did not have any buttermilk and just used regular milk.  Buttermilk is slightly tangy so rather than use 100% blue cheese, I used half blue and half feta.  The feta cheese gave it a slight tang which would have been present had I used buttermilk.  Delicious and oh so easy to prepare.  I cannot wait to serve it at my next dinner party...they will never believe I made it myself.

This is the best blue cheese dressing I have ever tasted.  It is not the thick out of the bottle store dressing.  It is more the consistency of a ranch dressing.  This is a winner.

Making your own dressing really makes this one! I make it all the time, I might be addicted.

Finally, a blue cheese dressing I actually want to make again! This was delicious, very close to what you'd find at a good steakhouse. I didn't have buttermilk so I added a teaspoon of white vinegar. 
The buttermilk would probably made it even better. I also added a dash of Worcestshire. Used grape tomatoes and some bacon on top. Thanks for the recipe!

Really like this recipe.  I used more sour cream than mayo and added the vinegar a little at a time to my taste.  I also added cayenne pepper to give it a little kick.  I have made this twice so far and will use this many times.

Made for Christmas eve and got compliments on the presentation. I usually only rate 5 if I feel it is similar to what I would get in a restaurant - so this didn't quite make it, but will definitely make again. I did make bacon and crumble it over the dressing. I cut back on the amount of blue cheese - it seemed like too much. The dressing was a little watery even after sitting overnight - so may cut back on sourcream or buttermilk next time too.

This was excellent.  I added good quality bacon bits, but it does not need it.  Like many other people, I did not use all of the blue cheese.  I did put some of the cheese as a topping in case my husband wanted more.  My husband liked it so much, we finished off the lettuce the next night.  I will be using this when we have guests.

Really liked the dressing a lot.  Will make again.  I used 8 oz of blue cheese in the mixture and but didnt bother sprinkling extra on top (mainly because I didn't have any more blue cheese).  I thought it was great like that.

I have made this recipe at least six times. My husband even requests this salad.  I did take the advice offered by many people who said to halve the amount of blue cheese while keeping everything else the same. It is a fantastic salad.

I love these salads at steak houses because it's such simple flavour.  You can 'cheat' a little with a good bottled bleu cheese dressing, fresh ground pepper, and the crumbled bleu cheese on top.  I like mine with a large serving spoonful of fresh diced tomatos atop--the sweetness of the tomato goes well with the pungentness of the blue cheese.

The dressing is great! I didn’t find iceberg lettuce and used romaine, it was a big disappointment (at least for me) the taste is very different, if you don’t have iceberg lettuce choose another salad and avoid feeling super sad like me.

This one is a winner. The volume of dressing is fairly small. Our family of three used almost all of the dressing on our salads. If you like to have enough to to use the dressing again, double the dressing ingredients. Like others, I sprinkled half of the blue cheese on our salads. Do note that this will make the dressing itself a little less thick. That was fine with us. It was delicious.

Since I absolutely love wedge salads, I was really looking forward to this one.  The salad ingredients are fine (I, too, like many, lowered the amount of blue cheese), but I was so disappointed in the dressing.  As others have mentioned, the vinegar is overpowering.  I made the recipe as written so as to fairly evaluate it, but if I make it again, I will certainly reduce the vinegar.  Probably easier to find a different recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. I leave out the butterminlk and substiute milk. I've done both versions and don't notice a difference in taste. I add fresh bacon bits which really adds a great flavor.

Made for a late night Valentine's Dinner along with some steaks for my husband and I.  I added chopped bacon and dried cranberries to the salad as garnishes.  Also, I cheated and used a really thick store bought gourmet blue cheese dressing and thinned it with a little milk and then made a balsamic and brown sugar glaze to drizzle on top. (To mimic the wedge salad that is sold at Outback Steakhouse).  This was delicious and was exactly what I was hoping it would be!

The dressing was awesome.  It would be good with wings or chicken nuggets too.  I felt the salad was lacking something for it to work with the very strong blue cheese dressing.  I think it does need, as some other reviewers suggested....dried cranberries/diced apple and candied walnuts/pecan  and or bacon to help balance the dressing?

I really love this recipe, but I cut the blue cheese down to two 5 oz. packages, one for the dressing, and one to sprinkle on top.  None of my four children liked it, but they are picky eaters and I think blue cheese is an acquired taste.  As for myself and my husband, we really enjoyed it, and it would be easy to make the dressing up ahead of time and prepare the toppings to throw together at the last minute.  I will definitely be serving this again, but probably to a dinner party the next time, where they will appreciate it more than my kids!

This is a great, simple salad.  I love blue cheese so I didn't change the blue cheese quantity as the other reviewers.  However, it is great to be able to adjust that based on your personal tastes.  I added chopped pecans and dried cranberries with the other toppings.  The combination of the sweet (cranberries) and bite (blue cheese) is a great combination.  Add this one to the recipe box.

Good salad.  I think the recipe was mistyped--the 2nd blue cheese ingredient is supposed to be bacon, which I used instead.  The picture even shows the bacon.  Husband and I enjoyed it.  We will have it again.

I just made this dressing, and it is yummy! It's a lot different than bottled; which is a great thing! I used 4 oz. of blue cheese b/c that was all i had on hand. But i think if i had it, i'd add another 4 oz.! Because i am diabetic, i only added 2 teaspoons of sugar. Also cooked up some bacon to crumble over the wedge. Love the chopped tomatoes; esp. now when they come out of the garden. For convenience, I used an old mayonnaise jar to shake everything together; first everything but the cheese; after a few shakes added the cheese and gave it a couple more shakes! Great salad cabanagrl!! I will eating this often!!

This is an excellent dressing. I have made it several times since I found the recipe. I also sometimes substitute romaine lettuce for the iceberg with great results. I also think the  1 and 1/2 T of sugar is too much. I simply  added 1 tsp of sugar. I will never buy bottled blue cheese dressing again.

This was delicious!  I am not a blue cheese lover but this homemade dressing was great!  My family loved it.  I look forward to making this again.

With all the rave reviews I was expecting to love this recipe but mine was dissapointing. The only thing I changed was to use less vinegar but this was still too tangy for my taste. I will keep looking for one I will like or maybe play with this recipe a bit more to my liking.

Really good blue cheese dressing. I omitted the garlic because I really don't think garlic and blue cheese go together.  I did change the method of mixing a little.  Instead of putting in the whole 1/2 pound of blue cheese before mixing, I pulled out a small bowl of the largest chunks and blended the rest with the other ingredients, then I folded the large chunks into the dressing.  I omitted the blue cheese crumbles from the wedges.  This way you only need 1/2 pound of cheese, not a whole pound.  But overall, really tasty dressing and far superior to bottled.

This is the best tasting dressing even with the substitutions I had to make.  Can't imagine how good it would be as written.  Didn't have buttermilk so used regular - substituted feta for blue cheese - substituted apple cider vinegar for red wine vinegar.  Really good!!!

I will definitely make this again, but I will cut back on the vinegar and the sugar, both were a bit much making the dressing very sweet & vinegary.  As other reviewers, I only used 1/4 pound of blue cheese and it was plenty.  The one thing that I did add was seasoning salt, otherwise this would have just been thrown out.  I don't know exactly how much I added because I did the sprinkle, stir and taste bit.  Overall a good start to a good salad dressing.

Fantasic & so easy. Made the salad dressing with low fat mayo and sour cream, added a little extra garlic and some worceshire.  Sprinkled some very crispy homemade bacon bits when I served.  YUM!!  I also like to sprinkle toasted walnuts or pecans with my blue cheese salads.  Will try that next time.

My son-in-law’s favorite salad, and I didn’t even know it!  He even topped my overdone ribeye with some of the dressing and said it was fine, too. I did add freshly fried bacon bits and my daughter used the drippings to cook delicious Brussels sprouts!  A fabulous dinner!

Excellent and simple yet a very eye catching and retro dish. The fresh made Blue Cheese dressing sets it over the edge. I added only a hint of Worcestershire Sauce similar to a 1925 salad.

I tend to like savory Salad dressings, so this one was too sweet for me, even though I cut the sugar to only 1 tbs. I was able to salvage the dressing by adding more buttermilk, sour cream, mayonnaise and vinegar to balance out the sweetness. Those who  like sweet dressings would probably  like the recipe as it’s written. I did enjoy the pickled onions on the salad and it really did look very elegant.

This salad was a hit with my guests who are Wedge Salad aficionados.  Followed the recipe with minor changes based on very helpful comments from reviewers.  Used only 1/2 cup of crumbled blue cheese; only 1 Tbsp of vinegar (I'm not a big fan of vinegar); substituted 1/4 tsp of garlic powder for the garlic glove; used red onion but certainly not a whole one; added 1/2 lb. bacon and topped with scattered craisins. Rated  4 stars only because of some portion inconsistencies.  Will certainly make again.

This was awesome.  I substituted 2% milk whipped with  vinegar and lemon juice for the Buttermilk.  I also used a bit more mayo sour cream to make it thicker.  I blended in some of the cheese to make it even more thicker.  It was great.  Thanks

Just like at my favorite restaurant! I omitted the sugar by accident, but I don't think it was needed after all. I used half the amount of blue cheese, mashed up a little, put it all in the dressing . I didn't have buttermilk. I used regular milk with a little lemon juice. I liked the tang from the vinegar. My 7 year old grand daughter even liked it! I topped the wedge with diced tomatoes, red onions, bacon. Will be making this regularly!

This recipe is SO close to the dressing served at Morton's in Chicago! It is to DIE FOR!! I made as recipe calls the first time. It was absolutely delicious. The second time, I was looking to lighten the calorie content and used light mayo, light sour cream, and Splenda. Taste really did not change - just slight texture. I will make with fewer calories from now on. This salad is now a part of our regular rotation!! Thank you for this terrific recipe!! And according to My Fitness Pal (I entered all ingredients and they spit out a total calories per serving), each serving has been reduced from 362 calories per serving to 140 calories per serving!!

The dressing was great, however there is obviously a typo on the amount of blue cheese.  A half pound should read, both times, as a half cup.

This is a great recipe. I have made this dressing many times now with some variations. For my taste, I kept the 1/2 cup of blue cheese, used more garlic (2 tsp) and no sugar. It definitely tastes better the longer it's kept refrigerated to allow the flavors to blend.

I was surprised at the ingredients for my first attempt at the dressing. Huge wedge salad fan! My only edit might be reducing the amount of sugar. After setting overnight, it was a little sweet. My wife enjoyed it because it cut the funky cheese flavor that I prefer. Overall, it was good and easy to make.

I have made this numerous times. The second time I cut the blue cheese in half, but I believe that is personal preference, as it is wonderful with the full amount of blue cheese as stated in the recipe. It is excellent and my husband and I love it!!!

This dressing was very tasty. The only thing I didn't like was the sweetness. I doubled the recipe, so it called for 3 tablespoons of white sugar. I only added 2 and, for me, it is too sweet. However, after a couple bites the sweetness is hidden by the tang of the bleu cheese. I will definitely make this again, but I might just omit the sugar altogether or add to taste.

The salad dressing is amazing!  My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about it.  I used about 3/4 of the amount of blue cheese called for and a little less sugar.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe.  Great way to start an elegant meal.

This was good, but probably not my favorite blue cheese dressing.  It was a bit thinner than I prefer and a tad too sweet for me.  I made the dressing the night before so the flavors could blend.  Overall, it was very easy to put together and had great presentation.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, cabanagrl!

Awesome!!! I had this salad when I was in Las Vegas, and have been looking for a recipe for the dressing ever since. This turned out great! I followed the suggestion of cutting the amount of blue cheese in half. Personally, I think this depends on how much you like blue cheese, and you should probably adjust it to your liking.

I made this recipe for a different Christmas dinner salad. I have a group that know their blue cheese dressing!! I used low calorie versions of the mayo and sour cream. I left out the olive oil. I had rave reviews for the salad and dressing. We now have a new Christmas salad to have with our prime rib.

This dressing is DELICIOUS! Love everything about it. I read through the reviews and cut the amount of Bleu cheese in half because I bought it in a block. (I may have added more if I had bought crumbled since it isn't as strong.). I loved this recipe so much that I made a Greek style variation using all the same ingredients, minus sugar, substituted feta (instead of Bleu), and added dried oregano to taste- SO YUMMY too! I am very happy I stumbled upon this recipe.

Great dressing! It had a little kick to it (maybe the garlic or the type of blue cheese I used), and it was very good.  I used my vitamix and it turned out nice and smooth.

This a replica of "Shula's" bleu cheese dressing and is out of this world! I add extra garlic and bleu cheese. I use an  immersion blender so this comes together very quickly! Red onions are a must. I could drink this, it's that yummy;-)

I cut recipe in half for 4 servings and had to add a little more oil and buttermilk to get the consistency I wanted. Although we love garlic, I didn't want even the smallest pieces of garlic in the texture so I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder instead. All in all, loved it and will make again. Better than any store bought and as good as a restaurants. I don't think if folks say it has too much vinegar they should criticize so much, next time just use less to your liking. I found the ratio very good. I really haven't made a recipe yet I haven't tweaked in one way or another but they are always good start! Thanks for this one!

Made this for a New Years Eve party - but made sure I had back up dressing in case people weren't fond of blue cheese. Everyone was game and this was a huge hit. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I made two changes based on previous reviews - used approximately 1/3 C blue cheese and 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar. Delish, delish!! Will definitely make again.

We had this salad along with Suzies mashed red potatoes, and the high temperature eye of round roast ( all recipes from this site). A fabulous dinner, everyone loved this salad as much as any other part of the meal. It will definitely be a repeat at our house.

This dressing is so good my family could drink it! The vinegar gives a great amount of tang but does thin it considerably.  I also cut the amount of blue cheese in half and just let each person add more if they wanted. I use large cloves of garlic and it really complements the blue cheese.

Have to say that this salad dressing was the bomb!  Wasn't too sure about the sugar and wondered that it might be too sweet... but it was excellent.

I did, however, only use 4oz of blue cheese - as I prefer it in moderation.  Will definitely make it again and again!

I thought this was good but I think the sugar made it too sweet and took away from the blue cheese. I also added chopped walnuts to the salad. I'll keep looking for a recipe or tweak this one until I get it to where I like it. Just seemed like ti was missing something, but overall good.
