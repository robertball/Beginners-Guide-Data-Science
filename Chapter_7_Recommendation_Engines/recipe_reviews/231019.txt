There is no way I can give this recipe a good thumbs up.  For me, it calls for way too much garlic, and this statement is coming from a huger garlic lover!  Either its a misprint or someone really loves garlic powder...but 2 tablespoons is outrageous.  I would say 1/2 teaspoon is good enough.  I only halved the recipe because I was skeptical of the amount of garlic and soy sauce.  I didn't use anywhere near the amount of soy sauce called for.  I used less than a tablespoon to brush over the tops of the wontons.  While I think its a good idea, the amount of garlic and soy sauce needs to be adjusted.  I also think the egg yolk is not needed.  I would make this again but with major adjustments to the garlic.
