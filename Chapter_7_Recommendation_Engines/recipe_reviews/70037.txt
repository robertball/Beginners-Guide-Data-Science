I have to give this recipe a 5 because it won me our mock-Iron Chef competition!  We put it over pheasant, we used red wine vinegar instead and it turned out great.  Just the right amount of tang and sweetness.

A great base recipe b/c it alllows you to add and substitute many ingredients so you can make it your own. I used nutmeg, cinnamon, plain old vinegar, and ground ginger, a small amount of maple bacon to make it my own. GREAT with pork chops!

We will have this chutney along with our x-mas roast tomorrow on Christmas Eve. I prepared it today and just to make sure we won't be disappointed we all had a spoonful. Wow, we love it! It is soo delicious and I'm sure it will become one of our family favorites.

I hosted a dinner for 50 and 5 x the recipe so everyone would have a quarter cup portion. I used pears and it turned out fabulously! I cooked it a little longer than recommended and it was better the second day. Everyone loved it. Definitely a repeat!

Excellent!  I used old, mushy, sweet apples (decreased the sugar) and it turned out great.  Next time, I'll use less ginger since it was a bit overpowering.

Great flavor and very easy to make.  The ginger really packs a punch so don't over do it.  Watch the yield because it makes alot.

I followed the recipe, and it turned out too vinegary. Maybe use white vinegar instead of white wine vinegar? I'm not sure what I did wrong, but it's not good. It's OK except for the vinegar after-bite, which is intense. I'll go short on the vinegar next time.

I halved the recipe.  I put 1 whole cardamom pod and about 10 white peppercorns in a tea ball and buried it under the apples.  Used red wine vinegar, and Cortland apples which held their shape.  This was delicious with our Thanksgiving meal, and wonderful with leftovers.  Could be good as a dessert with some local ginger ice cream....will not be waiting until next Thanksgiving to make again!

I also had the same experience that others had--there was MUCH too much vinegar.  I made a special trip to the grocery store to get the white wine vinegar.  This was inedible as a typical chutney; however, I managed to salvage the batch by pouring it over a pork roast and putting it in the crock pot all day on low.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  We put it over pork tenderloin and it was a nice sub for the usual applesauce.  I only gave it 4 stars because it called for a variety of spices and the only one I could really taste was cinnamon.  I reduced the yield to 8 and there was still a huge amount left over.

This was so good. I also substituted black pepper for the white pepper, and used red wine vinegar, because that's what I had. I only made 1/3 the recipe, and it was more than enough for 5 people with plenty leftover (which I then heated and put on top of vanilla ice cream :)

This is an excellent recipe.  We substituted black pepper for the white pepper and added about 1 tsp of red chili flakes for some bite.  Just wonderful served with goat cheese on crackers.

We really enjoyed putting this apple chutney on chicken breast, even better with cheese melted on it. I chopped onion and ginger into it. Very simple and yummy!

Very nice, spicy yet mild. I did double the spices and added 1/2 tsp of curry powder to it. Good recipe to give your own twist too if needed.

I cut the recipe WAY down (I think I used only 2 apples.)  I used a little more of the spices than the recipe called for.  LOVED it!  Really flavorful and unique - this is not your same old sweetened applesauce!

This was a huge hit in our home.  We had it with a pork loin dinner, deli turkey roll-ups for lunch, and home-made lamb burgers with feta cheese another night.  I plan to make another batch of chutney and try it with a thick halibut steak.  It is very versatile.  I did use red wine vinegar instead of white and added about 1/2c or raisins and 1/2c finely sliced died apricot for interest. It needed more water and next time I'll just go ahead and double the liquid.

My DH made this chutney as a side dish with some pork - the end result was really good although he did end up tinkering with it a bit in the end to better suit our taste.  It was good and made a nice, big batch.

This is a great recipe.  I only had 1 apple left, so I substittued two pears and 1 apple.  I adjust the recipe to make less, since there's only two of us.  I used all the listed ingredients and it came out amazing!!  I'm serving with a Fresh Ham, Mashed potatoes, and some vegetable.  I just made it and tasted it.  Really good.  I had to put the spoon down and walk away or it would be all gone already, lol

This is a great recipe but definitely needed some modifications. I added another cup of vinigar and changed it to apple cider vinigar. Then switched out ginger for crystallized ginger and doubled the amount. Then with the added liquid I doubled the sugar and brown sugar.  Now with it being so sweet. I  deseeded  5 jalapenos and finely diced. The heat from those and the added ginger really pop. Then I added kosher salt tto taste. I would absolutely make again but think I'd use red onions if not for anything a little color.

Delicious!  Sweet, tangy, a bit spicey.  I did use apple cider vinegar instead of  white wine vinegar.

Instructions are a bit weird at the end, I left the onion and ginger in it, and it was fantastic.

I did this chutney as a side dish for pork chops on BBQ sauce and it was the perfect match! The flavors were rich and combined deliciously.

A deliciously easy accompaniment to pork chops. I had to use apple cider vinegar as it was all I had. Very tasty! Thanks for this easy and delicious recipe!

I made it a spiced up applesauce, after cooking I put the whole mash in the food processor, delicious. May add cooked cranberries. Was careful with ginger amt and tastes just right. Left out cardamom.

It made 15-20 cups and it tasted very poorly.  I don't think 15 apples is correct.

Really enjoyed this recipe I didn't have any cardamom so that wasn't included.  And like another review posted I ended up doing a little more on the spices than the actual recipe called for.  I did par it down to 6 servings instead of what it was originally.  Everyone at my house loved it though.  Def something I'll try again maybe with different fruit next time.  I also added a bit of hot curry to give it a bit of an extra kick and I really liked that.
