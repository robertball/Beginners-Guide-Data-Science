Can't go wrong with sweet potato fries.  I poked mine with a fork all over and microwaved it for a minute or so to make it easier to slice (leave skin on).  I ended up turning up my oven to get more browning (I like mine crispy)...made it 400 near the end when I noticed they weren't to my liking.  I made my own sauce based on what I had and it was really good.  Used vanilla yogurt (but any flavour yogurt will do!) in place of the sour cream and whipped dressing instead of mayo.  For seasoning I added some chili powder and cumin  to my taste.  I am updating quantities as I made it again yesterday and it is probably 2/3 whipped dressing to 1/3 yogurt and 1 tsp each for sprices. Again, try it and adjust to your preferences :)  Boyfriend asked me to remember that sauce...he loved it.

I LOVE love LOVE these Yam fries...I don't usually put seasoning salt on them as it might make the fries even more sweet. and I don't like adding extra salt to anything if it doesn't need it... the greatest thing about this superfood  my KIDS LOVE IT!

An easier method is to toss the yam or sweet potato wedges with olive oil or sesame oil along with sea salt into a zip lock bag, making sure the yams are well coated, then arrange on a cookie sheet.

Excellent - I grated course sea salt on the baking pan, and set oven at 420 degrees until tender in the middle. For the sauce I added some smoky chipoltle poweder and a little texas pete.  These are the best.  Thank you.

Yum, Perfect combo of sweet and tangy. This dip is really good and so simple, it does get better the longer it sits. I grilled my yams b/c it's to hot to turn the oven on (plus I love grilled veggies!). I tossed them in one tbsp OO, 1 tsp honey, salt and pepper to taste first, then grilled (around 20 min, flippin half way on my charcoal grill). Easy and delicious, thanks for the recipe:)

Awesome!  Loved the sauce (but I used more like 1 tsp. of taco seasoning!)  I also used sweet potatoes and my son gobbled them up.  Great recipe!

I used a homemade cajun seasoning salt and I tripled the "dip" as my boys are dip hogs. My kids and I loved these though my husband was just not a fan (too bad for him). but the spice really does need to be increased. I had no issues with soggy or burned fries and this recipe was easy to increase/decrease without causing the recipe to suffer which I appreciated.

I've never made yam fries but I bought some I really needed to us. The season salt was...okay on them. The sweetness shined through so it was a nice contrast. It did take longer then 25 minutes, and even though the yams looked done, they were very soggy to pick up, so I turned the heat on the oven up to 350 degrees to help get a crisp edge on them to pull off the pan. The dip was fine but mild in flavor, so I added an additional tsp of taco seasoning and it turned out prefect. However. I tasted the yam with the dip before tweaking and I didn't really think the dip matched up with yams. Yams were good, Dip was good...just didn't seem to think they went together well. But that's my opinion.

Toss the fries in the oil before baking!  I made this recipe as-is twice and they all turned out shriveled and rubbery and none of the seasoning stuck to the fries.  This last time I tossed the fries around in the oil on the pan so they were all coated before seasoning and cooking.  Viola!  Finally turned out like they should.  Somehow everyone managed to leave out that this is an important step.

Not bad, the dip had way too much sour cream in my opinion so I added more mayo. Also added more chili powder as it wasn't spicy enough for me.

This was a great recipe! This was my first time making yam fries, and I changed a few things up, but I'm so glad I chose this recipe. Unfortunately I didn't have all the spices needed, so I added a little piri piri sauce to spice it up. Secondly, I seared the yam fries before baking them to get that true 'fries' taste & crunch.

I know that I did well & the recipe was great because my red-seal-chef of a spouse gobbled them right up! The underdog prevails!!
I will definitely be making these again - my spouse has already picked up another yam & dropped hints! Thanks again for a wonderful recipe.

My husband has never been a fan of yams, but this is one that lured him in. I think a lot of that had to do with the dipping sauce (he is a condiment lover). I had to adjust a couple of things the second time around on this- first, I found that bigger wedges took a lot longer to cook and weren't as crisp on the outside as we prefer and a little too thick, not done well enough on the inside (even with an extended baking time). So I cut them a lot thinner the second time around, more like a smaller french fry would look. Those turned out much better with less cooking time. I also adjusted the mayo and sour cream the second time around because it seemed like one would overpower the other and my husband agreed the adjustment by taste was better. Overall, this is a hit in our house and requested often.

I would make this again and like that you can use more or less yams and it stays the same. I like my fries crispy though and that effect can be hard to get this way. I made sure to slice mine thin and baked at 400 but some on the edges burned.  I will use an airbake pan next time I cook them.
I also used a package mix of mango curry dip instead of tacco so not sure how that will taste. I think most dips would be good with this.

We love this recipe!  With 3 little kids, this is a great replacement for fries or tator tots with our quick dinners.  I especially love the dip- different enough from everything else but not too much so.

This was fantastic! I also included spears of eggplant and broccoli stalks with the yam fries and everything was so good! I think I even like the eggplant more than the yams- I recommend trying this with any vegetable you have on hand.

I didn't have any sour cream, so I used plain, full-fat yogurt. I also just eyeballed the spices to put in there, so I can't say how the dip in the posted recipe compares but mine turned out GREAT. I wanted to eat it by the spoonful!

This recipe is so easy to make and super versatile, not to mention healthy! I rarely review recipes I use on here, but this one was so great, I had to rave.

I made these a few years ago, only they were sliced potatoes and I grilled them, the oven would work fine. I made a dip with sour cream and maple syrup that was incredible. Yogurt would work and light syrup would as well. I love sweet potatoes.

This was good, and very simple. My potatoes didn't get crispy, but they were fine anyway, and I liked the combination of the potatoes and dip!

I cooked the yams longer than specified, but they were still very good and the dipping sauce was excellent.

Delicious!!!  Dip is amazing (didn't have taco seasoning, so used old bay seafood seasoning instead - with no paprika either)
The yams I left thicker chunks and cooked a bit longer, 25 mins as recipe said, then up to 400 and didn't time, but was probably another 20 mins.
In fact, I think I'm going to have tonight. THANKS!!

DELICIOUS!! I will be adding this to my permanent recipes. I did add some extra oil - enough to coat the wedges.

When I saw the recipe, YAM FRIES, I got all excited, as I love yams. Because they are called "fries", I expected them to be similar in texture to french fries, but the texture of these are like mashed potatoes - very soft.  Which was very disappointing.  I made them a second time tonight and had the same result as the first time. After 25 minutes at 350, I put them under a broiler for 5 minutes but even that didn't help to crisp them up.

Yams don't crisp--they just get limp.  Tastes OK but too much trouble to eat.
