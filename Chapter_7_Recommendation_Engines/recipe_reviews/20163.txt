Great recipe, just a few tips to avoid dryness and any disaster.

1. Combine the sour cream (make sure you use sour cream) and baking soda, set aside.
2. Mix the butter (make sure it is at room temperature) with the sugar (I just use 3/4 cup),
3. Beat the egg with vanilla (yes, I add 1 tsp. of vanilla)
4. Add the beaten egg to the sugar/butter mixture.  
5. Add the sour cream with baking soda and mix until smooth and creamy.
6. Mix well the dry ingredients and then add them to the wet mixture, just to get everything together, do not over mix.

From here, you can add as many "toppings" as you want.  This are tried and tested:
Chocolate chips
Craisins, raisings, cherries, etc.
Dried fruits such as apricots, figs or prunes (chopped in little pieces)
Nuts (chopped in little pieces)

I make 16 balls and press them w/ my hands to make a flat circle. Bake for 15 min. 
The secret with these scones is to not over mix or over handle.

I'd never made scones before but was having a tea party at my house and they were way too expensive to buy. I wanted to make them ahead of time so I used a 3" cookie cutter to cut them and froze them uncooked on a cookie sheet covered with wax paper. About an hour later I packaged them into ziplock bags separated by wax paper. For fresh scones anytime, put the desired amount of frozen scones (which look an awful lot like a hockey puck) on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 45 minutes. I added lemon zest and poppy seeds to one recipe, dried cranberries to another and left one plain. I now keep them in my freezer year-round so I can have fresh scones whenever I want. Don't freeze for more that 2-3 months but they probably won't last that long.

I've made this recipe MANY Times now.  It's a wonderful basic recipe, but I found the butter I use really makes a difference.  Regular butter creates a crumblier scone, and organic unsalted makes it more cake-like, like a Starbucks scone.  I prefer it that way.  My favorite flavors so far are Orange Spice (orange extract, grated orange rind, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and ginger), and lemon currant (lemon extract, lemon rind, currants).  My husband's favorite is regular chocolate chip.  I always break the batter in half and make 2 different flavors.  Then I divide each flavor into half and make 2 rounds.  If I only do 1 round per flavor, the scones are very large (Starbucks size). I prefer them smaller, so I don't eat so much at each sitting!!  They are PERFECT with hot tea.  I like the orange spice with lady grey, and lemon currant with green tea.  OH!  I also glaze the scones with a glaze made of orange or lemon extract and powdered sugar.  So yummy and so pretty!

These are absolutely fantastic! better than starbucks! The sour cream is the star of this recipe, makes them so moist and scrumptious. I have added 1/2 c dried cranberries and 1/4 orange juice to it for orange/cranberry scones, top them with a glaze of orange zest, orange juice and confectioner's sugar and you will just die of decadence. Add some pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger, glaze it with a simple confectioner's sugar and you've got a  wonderful holiday (or any day) treat. Add some bacon, onion and cheese, lessen the amount of sugar and you've got a super breakfast! I have made these in huge batches and put them in the freezer for easy microwaveable breakfasts. Add some black berry's and lemon zest and there's another elegant brunch item. what a great versatile, delicious recipe! This is a permanent fixture in my recipe box! Thanks Grandma Johnson!

I knew I was going to alter this recipe before I ever started, and to took some suggestions from others. I added an extra 1/2c sugar, 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2tsp nutmeg, and 1tsp vanilla. I brushed the top with milk and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, and sliced almonds.

I was looking for a stand alone scone (no jelly) and I found it, I will definetly make this again. Thanks

This is a great scone recipe.  I made pumpkin scones using this recipe.  I used 2/3 cup canned pumpkin and 1/3 cup buttermilk instead of sour cream.  I added the baking soda to the flour mixture and used brown sugar instead of white and cut it to 1/2 cup + 2 Tbsps.  I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice and a pinch of cloves to the flour mixture and then followed the directions.  Then I made an icing divided it and put cinnamon in half and then drizzled both over the scones.  VERY yummy!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

more like a muffin than a scone - cutting way back on the sugar, and eliminating the egg would make it more like a true scone. also, it makes me crazy when one of the "most useful" reviews tells readers to let the butter come to room temperature so that it can be creamed with the sugar. scones are meant to be flaky, which requires cutting cold butter into flour. creaming is a technique used in cakes and cookies...

These are truly wonderful scones. I made them for the first time this morning and they were pretty easy to make. I split the dough in half and made plain with sugar sprinkled on top and then tried to make the other half blueberry. I was not very successful with the blueberry half.  But it was my own fault. I had let the frozen blueberries sit on the counter for just a few minutes and they started to thaw so they were getting juicy and then I went to mix them in and it was a huge mess. But the plain with just sugar on top were fabulous so I will be using this recipe and doing all kinds of experiments in the future, starting with the blueberries. Great recipe!!! UPDATE: I have since made this recipe a couple more times and have used fresh blueberries in one batch and mini chocolate chips in another. Both turned out great. 2ND UPDATE: I made these scones again this morning and this time I used blackberries and sprinkled raw sugar (demerara sugar) on top of them and oh my gosh... this is by far my favorite combo. I love blackberries and the crunch of the larger sugar granules on top is really awesome!!!

Delicious!  I also added the nutmeg, cinamon and vanilla.  I wasn't prepared for them to spread quite so much.  My first attempt ended in one giant scone, because I put them too close together, so spread them out and plan for them to grow, grow, grow!

These are absolutely wonderful!  I made them for my daughter's bridal shower tea and couldn't have been happier with them.  I divided the dough into two circles (as recommended by others), cut it into wedges, then froze the wedges on a cookie sheet.  Once frozen, they went into freezer bags until the morning of the shower, when I popped them into the oven.  I served them with sliced strawberries and Easy Devonshire Cream (recipe from this website).  Delicious!!!

This is the best scone recipe I have found! I was using Pillsbury take and bake scones in my coffeehouse, so my customers were used to really cake-like supersweet scones.  I started making artisan scones using this recipe as the base.  I did add 1/2 cup of sugar, as the scones weren't quite sweet enough.  Chocolate Chips Scones - Add vanilla to sour cream mixture and use mini choc chips. Orange-Cranberry  - Add 1.5 Tbsp orange extract to sour cream mixture, zest of one orange to dry mixture and 2 c. craisins.  Almond,Cherry, White Chocolate - add 1/2 stick of almond paste, grated, 2 c. dried cherries and 1/4 bag white chocolate chips, chopped to dry ingredients, Lemon-Blueberry - add 2 TBSP lemon extract to sour cream mixture and 2 c. blueberries and zest of one lemon to dry mixture, Apple Cinnamon - Add 3 TBSP cinnamon and 2 c. chopped apples coated in cinnamon/sugar mix to dry ingredients.  Top all scones with egg wash and demarara sugar, except apple cinnamon, mix cinnamon with demarara sugar and top.

Great scone.  I divided the batch into thirds - put dried cherries in one, raisins and walnuts in another, and lemon zest and poppy seeds in the third (my favorite).  So many options to try!

I get rave reviews whenever I make this.  My friend declared it her favorite dessert.  I divide the dough into 3 flavors - cranberry orange spice (ground cloves), blueberry lemon, and pumpkin chocolate chip.  But the pumpkin version needs some work as the puree changes the texture.  For the other flavors, I use dried berries and citrus zest in order to prevent the dough from getting soggy.  I cut in the butter with a pastry blender and try to handle the dough as little as possible.  In order to make the thick triangle shape I see at many bakeries, I shape the dough into a square and cut it on a diagonal.  This makes four triangle scones for each flavor.  **The directions doesn't specify this, but I found that mixing the egg in with the sour cream mixture before adding to the dry ingredients works better than adding it in separately.**

I've made these (and tried other scone recipes on this site) several times now, and give these the highest rating.  I've found the following hints helpful:  handle the dough as little as possible so they don't get tough, use plastic wrap to help get the dough together, and instead of using flour when rolling out the dough to prevent the dough from sticking, try using confectioner's sugar.  It seems to put a little sweet coating on the finished product.

Thanks for sharing your fabulous recipe!!

These are by far the best scones that I have ever made.  We loved the scones in England and these are just as good, if not better.  We omitted the raisens and baked as directed.  We sliced them warm right out of the oven and spread strawberry preserves on them.  We then topped them with a "mock devonshire cream" that is to die for.  The recipe for the topping is as follows:  1/2 cup heavy cream or 8 oz sotened cream cheese (we used the cream cheese) , 2 TBSP confectioners' sugar, 1/2 cup sour cream.  In a chilled bowl, beat cream until medium stiff peaks form, adding sugar during the last few minutes of beating.  (If you are using cream cheese, just stir together with sugar.)  Fold in sour cream and blend.  Your family will love these!!

Oh my goodness!  These were absolutely incredible!  Moist, yet dense enough to hold their shape and crumble into bite size pieces.  I added white chocolate chips, 2 tsp. of fresh squeezed OJ and the zest from a large orange.  They came out with a slightly orange-y taste with a hint of yummy chocolate flavor from the white chocolate chips.  I served them with the Easy Devonshire Cream recipe from this site.  My co-workers said these were the best they have ever had and I agree!  I WILL make again and 100% recommend trying it!  UPDATE: I made these again and they were just as big a hit as the first time.  This time, I divided the dough in half, added blueberries and some grated lemon rind to one half and chocolate chips to the other.  I topped the lemon-blueberry ones with a lemon juice, confectioners' sugar glaze and the chocolate chip with raw sugar.  Both were very popular but the chocolate chip ones virtually disappeared!  You have to try this recipe because you can add anything and it will taste GREAT!!  UPDATE 2: I'm still making these and they are still amazing!  My favorite variation is 1/2 cup dried cranberries and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips.  Mmm, mmm, good!!

I love this recipe, I have made all types of scones from it. Just use the basic recipe and add whatever you like. I've made chocolate chip, cinnamon, and cranberry orange. I bring the scones to work occasionally, everyone loves them. The scones are very moist. I use a little bit more sour cream (sometimes I use plain yogurt) than required, it makes the scones a little moister. I also embellish with frosting or glazes on many of them. This recipe is massive and makes about 16 scones, but they go very quickly. Try experimenting with different flavors and mixtures. This is a great recipe, easy with a Kitchenaid mixer, and delicious for a morning treat!

The favorite blend by far is the cranberry orange scones. I add the zest of one orange to the batter and a bag of dried cranberries (orange flavored if possible) I also add a bit of orange juice and some more flour to even it out. When they are done baking I mix a glaze of powdered sugar, orange juice and orange zest into a not-too runny consistency and apply to the scones. They are great!!!

I adore this recipe! Have made it quite a few times before and it never fails. This last time, I substituted 1/2c. mashed banana for half of the butter. I added cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger. I also threw in some pieces of date and chocolate chips instead of the rasins. I have gotten rave reviews. They taste absolutely incredible!!!!!!!!! Thank you Rob for this delicious recipe

These scones are light, fluffy, and moist (I did add about 1/3 cup buttermilk)!!!  I enjoy scones, but I like my scones to be moist instead of dry -- these will be made many times in my house.  Since these are for my daughter's tea (birthday) party, I made them smaller and flash froze them.  Then I took them out right before the party so the scones were hot out of the oven, the house smelt great, and I had time to enjoy myself.  I took another reviewers suggestion of adding vanilla, and a little extra sugar (plus I added buttermilk) and they were perfect.  I added fresh raspberries to half the batch, and the other half was triple berry (black, blue, and raspberry) every plate was left empty.  Very good recipe and makes plenty.  NOTE: It's better to freeze before baking if you think you'll have extras, and then bake them fresh, than it is to freeze them already cooked and then reheat.

Excellent!  I made these on Sunday because I had purchased some from the store bakery the week before and my husband liked those.  He said he would skip the Pop Tarts for breakfast if he could have scones.  I was a little anxious because I thought they had to be hard to make, but boy was I wrong.  Having read the reviews for this recipe, I followed the recipe exactly, but divided the mix into 3 separate bowls.  I added cinnamon chips to one, raisins to the second, and chocolate chips to the third and ended up with smaller sized scones that were perfectly sized for us.  I had to bake them a little longer, but that could just be my oven.  Right now I am preparing another batch and adding raisins to one, dried blueberries to the second, and dried cranberries to the third.  Adding extra sugar to the recipe or on top would make them too sweet for us, but if you like sweeter scones, then go ahead.  This is definitely a recipe to keep and pass down to your family.

Great recipe! Both my husband and I are in love with baked goods ;), but are very concious of the calories consumed. So I tried to make a lighter version. First, I halved this recipe. Then I used light butter, fat-free sour cream, eggbeaters instead of the egg and half sugar half splenda. Then, I still made 12 scones out of the  circle. The scones came out very well, in spite of all the light ingredients. They were soft and fluffy and we both loved them! The size of each scone was just enough of a treat (they weren't huge, but they weren't that small either). Plus, the calorie count dropped to 150 cal per scone! Not a small accomplishment ;). So we got our scone and we got to eat it too! So, for all those health conscious, go ahead and substitute! You will still get a great tasting scone!

This is the best scone recipe I have ever had. I use it at all of my tea parties and everyone asks for the recipe everytime! It blows every scone recipe I have ever made away. Thanks Rob for sharing your treasured family recipe with all of us. It's the BOMB!

What a wonderful scone recipe...easy to put together and a delightful treat with tea or coffee!  I followed the recommendation of others and divided dough into thirds and flavored each third with something different...blueberries and orange zest, craisins and orange zest, and cinnamon raisins and golden raisins.  I cut each circle into 8 wedges...this makes for a perfect sized scone.  Next time I will try the clotted cream recipe to serve with the scones.  Thanks Rob and Grandma Johnson for sharing!

This has got to be the easiest recipe I've tried in awhile.  I used blueberries in place of the raisins (not a big raisin fan).  They turned out amazing, my fiance then asked me to make cinnamon scones, I used this same recipe and added cinnamon in the batter,and topped with cinnamon sugar.  These have become a household favorite for myself, my fiance, and a picky 13 year old.  Thanks so much for sharing...

Thanks Rob!  This recipe is great!  I have tried several variations-dried cranberries, chocolate chip, and even quince!  They are great as they are, but if you like something a little sweeter, like I do, then add some brown sugar and vanilla.  This recipe gives a lot of room for variation! I have been working on some holiday scones, and have tried molases in order to make gingerbread scones-they are wonderful, with nutmeg and cinnamon.  You can add as much molases to your liking, but dont add too much, as it will make the dough too heavy, and you'll end up with large, flat cookies!  But, all in all, this recipe is wonderful.  A hint though: Handle the dough as little as possible!  It's a very simple recipe, easy to throw together, and easier to eat!

I have reviewed this recipe before, but felt the need to come back and review it again because it is just so wonderful and versatile.  I have done many combinations such as cranberry/white choc, cherry, cherry/choc. chip, cinnamon chip, dried apples with cinnamon, blueberry, pineapple, and many experiments yet to come.  Everytime is delicious!  I wanted to repost though to let everyone know that these freeze very well.  I simply shape 1/2 the batter into a circle or square, cut into scones and place in a freezer safe bag.  I always make extra so that my freezer is stocked with scones for those impromptu visits from family or friends.  Of course, they know I have them in there which may be why I have so many drop by visitors :) When ready to use, just increase the cooking time by 2 to 3 minutes and you have a perfect scone.  I also take frozen batches when we go to the beach on vacation and that way we can make them fresh every morning for whoever wants them.

Great recipe! I followed Lucia de Wagner's tips and these came out perfect.  I did however use  1 c. of sugar and I did add the optional 1 c. of raisins.

I live in England and the first thing my boyfriend said was that these were not as 'posh' as the English ones, then he was surprised he didn't need any clotted cream or jam to eat them with, than he and his mate stopped playing their computer game and finished the whole batch. I made half of the scones with cranberries and half with cinnamon, nutmeg and chocolate chips (lovely). I also put butter in the freezer for 15 mins, gated it into the flour mixture and tried to make sure it was not fully incorporated to make the scones flaky. Thank you for the recipe

This recipe is beyond awesome!  I made these for a small home wedding shower and for a Sunday night dinner party!  I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon to the batter.  I divided the batter into thirds and flavored with different things.  So far I have made blueberry (1/3 c. dried blueberries with 1 T. lemon zest), coconut (1/3 c. coconut with coconut sprinkled on top), cranberry (1/3c. dried cranberries with 1 T. orange zest), chocolate chip (1/3 c. mini chocolate chips), cinnamon raisin (1/3 c. raisins with cinnamon dusted on top) and finally plain with cinnamon on top.  There are so many different things you can do with this recipe.

Made 2 versions of these Christmas morning, one batch with dried cranberries and the other with golden raisins, they were excellent and I will definately be making these again. I think I will make 2 circles of 16 scones per batch. They freeze well. Yum!

This is a really good scone recipe, I've been using it for several years. It's not dry like a typical scone. I have tried with mini chocolate chips, dried cherries and chopped dried apricots--all yummy! For a tea or shower make 3 smaller rounds and drizzle with a powdered sugar glaze.

These are AMAZING.  A few notes for the newbies like me:  The dough seemed way too dry, and I almost added more sour cream or some milk.  But DON'T - just turn it all out onto the counter and mix it with your hands.  It pulled together perfectly.  I made 3 rounds and used a pizza cutter to cut them into 8 scones each, and that was the perfect size for me.  I made a vanilla glaze with powdered sugar, milk, butter and vanilla and dipped the tops and sides once they cooled a bit...it hardened up and was PERFECT.  Tastes just like Starbucks' petite vanilla scones, but the texture is MUCH better and doesn't have that too-floury flavor.  I will make these again and again, I'm sure!!

I followed the recipe EXACTLY and was sure to carefully measure everything...especially the flour using the "spoon" method.  This recipe, as written, failed.  There wasn't enough moisture to mix the dough.  I ended up adding some milk just so I could form a dough.  They also took much longer to bake than what the recipe called for.  The flavor wasn't any better than my old stand-by recipe that doesn't involve an egg or sour cream (it just uses sour-milk and is less involved) so I'll be going back to that recipe.  I just had to try this recipe because of the great reviews, but I was disappointed.

I made these scones for a baby shower.  They were my 1st ever attempt at scone making and I was a bit worried as I am not a very seasoned cook.  These scones were surprisingly easy to make and were delicious to boot!  I made half with currants and half with milk chocolate chips.  I kept them in a ziploc baggie for a day before the shower.  They were soft, buttery, and the best tasting scones I've ever had!  I will definitely make them again - thanks for making me look like a pro!

Tip for newbies like myself... DON'T handle dough too much after kneading.     I used a rolling pin   to "flatten" to the  specified thickness and they didn't rise too much.  Freeform seems to yeild better results.

These scones were great.  I just got finished baking them and my boyfriend has already inhaled 2. They're not even cool yet!  I've never really been much of a scone person because all the ones I've tried have been dry, crumbly, and very heavy, but these are just the opposite.  I sprinkled a little turbinado sugar and cinnamon on the tops and added a bit of cinnamon to the dough, but left everything else unchanged.  Next time I'll add some fruit to the mix, as the bf said that would make this recipe a definite "10".  Looks like you made a scone convert out of me!

In the early 90's, I used to live near Central Square, Cambridge, MA, where there was an amazing muffin and scone place that has since disappeared. HOWEVER, these scones are the closest thing I've found to those delectable little morsels. They are FANTASTIC. I used a combo of yogurt and milk because I didn't have enough yogurt. I also added some mango puree, which made they beautifully moist. I even went a step further. I spooned half the dough on the cookie sheet, added mixed berries to the middle, then spooned a "dough hat" on each one, sealing the dough around the berries. AMAZING. I had to bake them for probably 20 minutes + since I made them so big. I highly, highly recommend this recipe.

Perfect scones! Exactly what I was looking for!
There are two things that I didn't differently the second time I made these however. Instead of making one large circle and cutting wedges, I made the two thicker ones. The wedges were more even and I was able to yield 8 from each making 16 altogether that were thick enough to break open and butter.
The second thing I did was to soak whatever dried fruit I decided to use, raisins, currents, cranberries or blueberries, in boiled water for 20 minutes. Just to plump them up a bit. There's not a lot of moisture in this recipe so if this is not done, the fruit remains dry.
After this they are perfection! Thanks for the recipe!

We do a lot of camping and traveling and I usually bake these right before leaving. They have proven to be very "durable" when packing up. I just seperate the different flavors into gallon zip locks and go. They have NEVER crumbled and taste just as great 2 to 3 days later.(I don't have much tupperware left...santa, are you reading this!?) SO TASTY. I have done plain,lemon w/ lemon zest topped with a lemon glaze, cinnamon, cranberry/orange (sometimes w/ white chips), chocolate chip, Almond - add almond extract then top w/ an almond glaze w/ slivered almonds. Yummy! I plan to make these and the pumpkin version to take with us on our road trip next week. Thanks so much for the recipe. Super simple and very delicious.

These scones were so delicious!!!    Very tender...not dry, like some I have made in the past.  I used blueberries, which were a bit messy, but were worth every bit of the mess!!!   I also DID NOT HAVE SOUR CREAM...so I looked up what could be used in place of it...and the cookbook I had said.....plain yogurt.  Well, I didn't have that either, so I used lite blueberry yogurt!!!  It was great!!  Gave the scones a pretty lilac color too!!!  Will definitely make these again!!!  They are addicting!

This recipe was phenomenal! I added dried cranberries. The scones were unbelieveably light and moist and wonderful with butter. This recipe is a keeper. Only one criticism. They were huge! Next time I will make 2 rounds and cut the scones a little smaller. Also, I divided the butter and dried ingredients into two and ran batches thru the food processor instead of cutting the butter into the dried ingredients. Then i added the wet ingredients and was careful not to overhandle. This all cut the prep time to nothing. You have got to try this recipe!

Every scone I've ever had at a bakery or restaurant was so dry that I finally stopped eating them. I've never made scones before so I thought I'd give it a shot. Instead of sour cream I used buttermilk; I didn't have cream of tartar so I used vinegar and doubled the amount; instead of 1 cup of butter, I used 1/2 cup unsalted butter and 1/2 cup coconut oil. I didn't have any dried fruit, so I chopped up some almond toffee candies and some milk chocolate. I was in the process of patting it out so I could cut it and bake when I realized I forgot to put the candy in. I dumped the 1 cup total of almond toffee candy and milk chocolate onto the dough and kneaded it in. At this point I was sure it wasn't going to work because every recipe I've read about scones warns you NOT to overmix. This recipe is VERY forgiving! I patted the dough out into a 12-inch circle, approximately 1/2-3/4 in thick and cut it into wedges. I baked at 350 for 18 minutes and they're yummy. Not super moist (my fault for overmixing) but not dry either. Definitely not crumbly. And definitely better than any I've ever purchased. I took some hazelnut non-dairy powder and mixed it with a little buttermilk and drizzled over the tops. So good! I don't care for overly sweet baked goods so these are perfect for me. Thanks for sharing!

These really are excellent. Everyone in my family loved them. I did follow the suggestion of the first reviewer in using 3/4 cup butter and just mixing in softened butter with sugar. The only thing I found in mine is that they baked much longer than the `12-15 minutes. More like 25 min and I even cut them smaller than suggested. My family is already asking me to make them again. I used choc chips in mine and also brushed them with milk and sprinkled sugar on them before baking.

I followed the recipe as is, except did not use raisins. The dough was very crumbly, like it did not have enough wetness? I pressed it together as best I could, and made 8 scones with it, they are pretty big and took 24 minutes to cook fully. This is easily the best scone I ever had. Even though the dough was very crumbly, they still came out delicious. I am going to have one with raspberry jam next!

These are outstanding, the best scones I've ever had!  I learned a few tricks from "Joy of Cooking" for making scones.  I cut the butter into little pieces and freeze for 20 minutes.  I use my food processor to blend the frozen butter and dry ingredients until the biggest pieces of butter are the size of peas.  Then I add the sour cream and egg and pulse just until the dough starts to clump together.  I then divide the dough into 2 and mix in by hand the zest of one orange and 1/2 cup craisins in one, and 1/2 Tbsp. cinnamon and 1/2 cup raisins in the other.  I then press the dough into rectangles and cut out wedges.  I use an insulated cookie sheet and bake for 18-20 minutes.  This is a great scone recipe!  I find it's sweeter than most others and not as dry, which are both pluses in my book!

I love this recipe. It is so easy to make and so versatile. I change the flavors to my scones all the time, but my two favorite flavors are Orange, cranberry, white chocolate scones and almond, cherry scones.On each recipe I leave out the currents. For the first flavor I add 1/2 to 3/4 teas. orange flavoring, 1 cup dried cranberries and 1 cup white chocolate chips. For the second flavor I add 1/2 to 3/4 teas almond extract, 1 cup dried cherries and 1 cup white chocolate chips. On both flavors I drizzle melted white chocolate over the tops of the scones after they have baked and cooled. I also devide the recipe into four equal size balls and shape each ball into a flattened circle and cut each circle into 8 section so that I get 32 little scones. It is a great size and works well for when you want to take it to a potluck. They never last long and I get asked for this recipe all the time.

These were DELICIOUS!! I followed the recipe exactly (except omitted the raisins - don't like them!) and it was moist, flavorful and flaky. Not hard and crumbly like I've had other scones. This was more like a sweet biscuit - I like it much better that way. Could use them for a base for strawberry shortcake too. Great recipe - have to add this one to my permanent recipe file!

In the past I've used a different recipe for scones, but this year I wanted to try a new one.  It was helpful to read the reviews and the suggestions, so I went with this one.

The scones turned out wonderfully!  Everyone commented on how soft they were and that normally they don't like scones because of their harder texture.  My guess is that the sour cream makes them so fluffy!
I did modify the recipe.  I did not use raisins at all, as I'm not a fan of them in scones.  But to create some flavor I did the following: 1) In the first batch I added a great deal of cinnamon in the dough while I was mixing it up and then sprinkled sliced almonds on top to create cinnamon almond scones.  2) In the second batch I folded lemon zest (two lemons) and some poppy seeds into the dough while mixing and then added more poppy seeds on the top.  
I glazed both batches with an egg-white wash which   made the scones brown nicely in the oven.  

Overall, this is a great recipe and I will definitely use it again and again and try some new flavors along with it!

Wonderful recipe!  I got many compliments on the scones when I took them to a recent open house.  I followed some of the many good suggestions by other reviewers:  added 1 tsp vanilla to the dough, divided the dough into thirds...then made one batch with mini chocolate chips, one with dried cranberries and orange zest (I also made a orange glaze for these), and one batch I just added cinnamon and dusted the tops with cinnamon sugar.  I used my food processor to mix the ingredients and cut in the butter and it couldn't have been easier.  Even though I divided the dough so that I got 24 instead of 12, they were still good sized...and if I make them for an open house/brunch buffet again, I will cut them a little smaller yet so that they would be more "bite sized".  Thanks for sharing (PS...I wish that MY Grandma Johnson had made these for me!)

Delicious!!!  I followed comments and made two circles instead of one.  I yielded 16 scones instead of 12.  Next time, will make 3 circles as were still fairly large.  I added milk and sprinkled sugar on top.  Raisins made a nice addition.  Ate some and froze some.

I have been making this recipe for a few years now and it is by far the best scone recipe out there!  I followed it to a tee with the exception of adding craisins instead of the raisins.  Excellent!!

Tasty!  Kids gobble them up.  I have followed other reviewers advice and made very large batches, adding mini chocolate chips to 1/3 of the batter, lemon extract and poppyseeds to 1/3 of the batter and orange extract, zest and crasins to the other part.  Can easily freeze in a ziploc bag and quickly defrost.  My kids actually like them frozen:)

These were fabulous!!!  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla, also 1 tsp of almond extract with egg mixture.  I split the dough in two after mixing all together, then added mini-choc chips to one, and grated orange rind (1 TBS+) and dried cranberries to the other.  I formed a ball with each and patted into a greased 8-inch cake pan.  Before baking, I also cut each round into 8 pieces using a knife dipped in flour.   I also brushed with cream and sprinkled with coarse sugar before baking.  I baked these in my oven at 350 and it took closer to 30 minutes.  I just kept an eye on them and baked till they were lightly browned and done in the middle.  Once they cooled, I cut again and drizzled with confectioners sugar/milk mixture.   SOOO YUMMMMY!!  They freeze well, and last for several days unfrozen - - If they don't get eaten!!!!

Not a true scone as it is cake-like.  Overly sweet.  My hub said, 'what did you do to the scones'???  He wants me to post my goto recipe for Tea Scones which I have been baking since 1970.  I really wanted to like this recipe because of all the wonderful reviews.

Still amazing.   I wish I could hug grandma Johnson. I reviewed this in 2006 and it's still going strong   Absolutely the best scone recipe I've ever tried and I've tried dozens. This one is it.  to this day I get antsy just thinking about those scones :). Dried cranberries or blueberries are an amazing addition If you are so inclined :)

This recipe deserves more than 5 stars!  I got this recipe to make for my 4 kids and husband. They loved them. Made them again for extended family, and everyone went crazy. Word got around, simple, small requests came in from friends and family. Grandma Johnson's Scones, have blessed my family. The irony is, I haven't even tasted them! I'm have Celiac Disease and am highly allergic to flour. Try these scones, if they don't work the first time, try again. Use a standing mixer or food processor to cut in the butter, and mix the sour cream & egg by hand.

My first scone attempt.  Loved it.  VERY fattening, but extremely good.  Made 1/2 with currants and the other half with poppy seeds and lemon zest.  Excellent.

Great recipe!  The store didn't have much selection in dried fruit so I used dried cranberries and orange zest instead of raisins and it was tasty.  My friends all loved it.  The cooking time took a little longer for me than stated, about 5 more minutes (20 minutes total)

This is a great scone recipe. The only variation was that I used blueberries.  I did like someone else recommended and divided my batter in half and did 1/2 blueberries and 1/2 chocolate chips.  Use frozen blueberries. They won't smash as easily and be quick once out of the freezer. If making more than one batch put the berries back in the freezer. Looking forward to making them again.

These truly are awesome.  Thank you so much Rob, for sharing this recipe.  I have made them often and the only change I make is adding dried cherries instead of raisins.  Sometimes I make this recipe plain and use it instead of shortcake with strawberries.

These scones are excellent!  I made them with some healthy modificaitons:  Subbed applesauce for half of the butter, used only 1/2 c of sugar and 1/4 c splenda, and used whole wheat flour. I didn't use the pastry kind (King Arthur?) but they still turned out great. Baked for 12 min, just shaped triangles out of the dough by hand and it made 13 beautiful scones.  I followed all of the tips in the most helpful review: 
"1. combine the sour cream (make sure you use sour cream)and baking soda, set aside. 
2. mix the butter (room temp.) with the sugar (just use 3/4 cup), beat the egg w/ vanilla (yes, I add 1 tsp. of vanilla), and add to sugar/butter mixture. 
3. mix well the dry ingredients and then add them to the butter/sugar/egg/vanilla, just to get all together, do not overmix.
4. Add the Sour Cream w/baking soda, again, do not overmix.

Thanks for a great recipe! I made with a heaping cup of cranberries.  Positively delicious!! :)

I love this recipe! I use it all the time but When it comes to the baking soda in the sour cream it works better to just mix those two ingredients in when it says to add the sour cream mixture because it makes the scones fluffier.

okay...while browsing through this website i kept seeing this recipe.  It never really interested me because I have never had a scone before so I passed it over.  But as I would search different lists and the recently reviewed lists I kept seeing this recipe.  So, I decided to give it a try and whoa...am I glad I did.  Again, I have never had a scone before so I have nothing to compare it too but this was fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly with 2 exceptions...light sour cream and instead of raising, white choc. and cranberries.  I already know what my home-made Christmas gifts will be this year.  If you're looking at this recipe wondering...should I?  The answer is yes.  It's easy and delicious. VERY HAPPY EATS!!!

I like scones, but always thought there should be a happy medium between barely-sweet biscuits, and overpoweringly-sweet confections. This is it! They are so good, and everybody loves them. I have made them 5 times in less than 8 weeks. They work great for tea parties, if they are made smaller (I just make 6 small circles, and cut each circle into 8 pieces, then decrease the cooking time to 10 min). For add-ins, I have done cinnamon-raisin, craisin, plain cinnamon, bluberries, and raspberries. The fruit makes the dough extra sticky, so those are hand-formed, and need to bake longer. However, they are very tasty.

I spent three months in England helping to plan a large event and used to go to the local bakery to get fresh scones every morning.  I have been looking for a great scone recipe every since.  The search is over, this is it.  They are so simple to make.  I added dried cranberries, chopped walnuts and golden raisins to mine.  Even my sister who is on a "starve yourself" diet, gobbled one down.

I have used this recipe so many times with many variations   and they always come out perfectly. I really like using craisins and white chocolate chips.  Another one to try: 1 cup frozen blueberries (don't rinse) added last and gently combined into the dough. These can be sprinkled with white sugar before baking or drizzle this lemon glaze over while still warm: 1 1/3 c powdered sugar, 2 TB fresh lemon juice, 1/3 zested lemon, 1TB veg . oil, 1TB water.  Has a great  flavor!

I've eaten alot of scones but never actually made them.  These were very good.  I divided the dough and made one batch with fresh blueberries and one batch with cinnamon & raisins(I soaked the raisins in boiling water for a few minutes to soften)I had every intention of adding vanilla to both but forgot so I can't wait to make more.  Any excuse-they were delicious!  I got 24 scones total and some were really large.  Next time I'll know to make them smaller and have plenty of dough to make 3 different varieties and still get 10 or so per batch.  So many great options to choose from-can't wait to add some choc chips!  THANKS...
Just an update to my above comments-I added a little honey and chopped up pistacchio's to a batch and they were superb!  I also used my food processor to mix all the dry ingredients with the butter and then added the egg and sour cream-so much easier!

I made these last week and although they were tasty....I am not sure that I would make them again. I did half in which I sprinkled cinamon and sugar on top and the other half I used the orange flavored craisins. I have a scone recipe that I have used for quite a few years that requires buttermilk and not only are they much much easier to put together...they are 10x better. I thought though after all the reviews that they would be outstanding but they definitely were not and also...not even close to what a true scone tastes like. Sorry  :(

My friends and parents insist that I make these scones for them when I am home.  Once, I used a tool that my mom had to cut the butter into the dry ingredients.  I found that the scones tasted better, for some reason, when i just used my hands to knead the butter into the dry ingredients.  I add cinnamon and chopped apples to my scones.  Delicious!

These scones are the best!  I added some fresh cranberries and they were perfect at Christmas last year.  My girlfriend (and myself) can't wait to have them again!  Thanks!

These were delicious and addictive. They were very buttery and had a wonderful aftertaste. The recipe was quite large and we didn't manage to eat them quickly enough. They don't taste nearly as good when they are not fresh. Any advice on storing?

Very Good.  I used dough hooks on my mixer to blend.  Worked great...also used a large cookie scoop and then pressed them down.  I added mini chocolate chips and they were a huge hit!  I will certainly make them again!

Fantastic recipe!!  Hate repeating hints, but with so many did not research to find this one. When I make these wonderful treats, BEFORE BAKING, I set aside 6 or more, wrap individually in plastic wrap, set on a tray and freeze.  When company comes or I want to bring a few to a friend, I just take as many as needed, unwrap, either put in my toaster oven or oven and bake for 30 minutes.  I do not defrost.  They come out wonderful.

EXCELLENT!

I used fresh blueberries and followed the following advice:

Great recipe, just a few tips to avoid dryness and any dissaster. 1. combine the sour cream (make sure you use sour cream)and baking soda, set aside. 2. mix the butter (room temp.) with the sugar (just use 3/4 cup), beat the egg w/ vanilla (yes, I add 1 tsp. of vanilla), and add to sugar/butter mixture. 3. mix well the dry ingredients and then add them to the butter/sugar/egg/vanilla, just to get all together, do not overmix. 4. Add the Sour Cream w/baking soda, again, do not overmix. From here, you can add as much "toppings" as you´d like, I try chocolate chips, but will try as many suggestions as I can. I make 16 balls and press them w/ my hands to make a flat circle. Bake them 15 min. The secret, not over mix or over handle.

good recipe, but curious.  Baking soda + cream of tarter = baking powder, especially good for those who can taste the bitterness of commercial BP.

Fantastic! I followed the advice of the very first reviewer, as other have, and my scones turned out light, buttery, and delicious.
I made one batch of lemon cranberry (add one cup dried cranberry, the juice of one lemon, and a teaspoon of lemon rind); one batch of raisin; and one batch of savoury ham, onion, and cheese (reduce sugar to approx. 1/4 cup, add sauteed diced onions, diced ham, and 1/2 - 1 cup of grated swiss cheese). I  baked a dozen, and froze another three dozen for use during the holidays. Thank you for this 5-star recipe!

I made these scones for my hubby who loves real scones and he loved them.  I used 3/4 cup sugar like the suggestions.  I added the zest of one lemon, and it gave the perfect hint of lemon flavor.  Great recipe.

These scones are fabulous and I make them often.  I add dried cranberries along with orange zest.  That is the way my family likes them best, although I have added raisins and cinnamon, etc.  I found  cutting these into 12 scones made them WAY too large.  I form my dough into 3 equal discs, then roll each one out, cutting each disc into 8 equal triangles.  Use a large pizza cutter for fast work.  Then bake as stated, perhaps a bit shorter time.  Once they cool completely, I make a thin glaze using powdered sugar and some orange juice and drizzle over the tops. I also like to add a bit of orange zest to the glaze.   The nice thing about these scones is that they freeze "great" and you can pull out as many as you want to thaw.  This is much easier than freezing them raw, then baking a few each time you want some, as one other reviewer suggested.

These scones were wonderful!  I made them for a brunch and they turned out great.  I divided the batch.  I made a batch of lemon poppy seed (using the zest of a lemon)and lemon raspberry (frozen raspberries unthawed and lemon zest) for the other.  I brushed the lemon raspberry scones with heavy cream and then sprinkled with sugar crystals before baking.  I should have put heavy cream and sugar crystals on the lemon poppyseed scones also.  I made these scones on a Wednesday, froze them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and then put the scones into plastic bags once they were frozen.  I thawed them out on Saturday morning for an hour at room temperture.  I also used whole fat sour cream.  I followed the preparation instructions using the review from "Lucy7."  I also put vanilla in my scones but I patted my dough into cirles and cut them into triangles (using a pizza cutter).  However, like other reviewers, do not overhandle the dough.  I served the lemon raspberry scones with balsalmic truffle cream.  Again awesome!!  These were seriously out of this world!!  I am officially a scone junky and will be making these on a regular basis (or maybe not because I had to eat them until they were gone!!).

This is one recipe that I continue to come back to when we're having weekend guests, or when my husband needs something for the office, or just whenever I want to treat him with something warm and homemade early in the morning.  I sometimes cut the amount of sour cream (light sour cream), but I make that up with plain low fat yogurt.  I don't mix the yogurt with the sour cream before adding the baking soda, just mix the 1 t. baking soda with the reduced amount of sour cream and set this aside.  In a separate bowl beat the egg and add low fat yogurt to make up the difference in the reduced amount of sour cream.  I also sometime add a dash of cinnamon to the flour mixture, and there are many variations on a theme when it comes to what the lumpy parts will be: raisins, walnuts, pecans, craisins (my husband likes the orange flavored ones - philistine!), currents, almonds, etc... also, I kneed the dough until it's sort of silky feeling and form a semi-rectangle - about 3 inches by 20 inches, depending on how thick I want the scones (they puff some) - and I cut triangles from this, alternating point to butt, if you know what mean. This method usually garners almost 30 scones. Sometimes I also brush these with a little milk and sprinkle them with Turbinado (raw) sugar.  The changes I make to recipes are my own preferences, but I rate recipes on the original version.  This definitely deserves 5 stars. When I search for recipes I usually dump between 2 and 7 of the same sort into my r

These are the most sinfully delicious scones I have ever made in my life.  I'm a baker and I have been searching for ages for the best scones.  These are them.  The combination of baking soda and powder and cream of tartar makes these so fluffy and light as air.  They're incredibly moist as well and literally melt in your mouth.  I made them for my flat and my flatmates couldn't stop eating them.

Seriously, you will never need another scone recipe again.

I usually use the store bought Fair Scone mix, or something that is a high quality mix. I figured, I'd give this recipe a shot. Let me just say that I never knew a scone until I had this recipe! I can not rave about this recipe enough. It was an amazing pleaser for our entire family of 5! I added 1 C. white choco chips and 1 C. dried cranberries. I also made the Devonshire Cream recipe, but added an extra Tbs. sugar and 1/2 tea. vanilla to that. EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK! YOU WILL NEVER WANT ANY OTHER SCONE AGAIN! =)

Well... how boring am I? All I can say is this recipe is fail proof.. Easy, delicious and perfect! Novice bakers should start with this one. I took one batch, divided batter in 3 and made cheese, raisin and blueberry scones. Fresh out of the oven, a little butter, fresh coffee, sunshine in the kitchen.. the perfect breakfast! Enjoy!

I'm not a baker so this was quite a step for me.  I loved them and so did everyone at my sister's Mother's Day Brunch! I added 1 tsp. vanilla, and fresh blueberries coated with flour and a little sugar. Wonderful! I made them a second time (next day)and I got the feel for them and will continue to make them!!!

Excellent recipe!!  My healthier variation -- Used 3 c. white flour and 1 c. whole wheat, cut butter in half to 1 stick, used low fat sour cream.  Used stand-up mixer and mini scone pan.  Added ten minutes to cooking time.

These are really good! I added cinnamon like others have suggested. I split it into two and put mini chocolate chips with sugar on top on 1/2 and put craisons and dried blueberries in the other half and then did a lemon topping that was suggested in another review. I then rolled them out about 1/2 inch thick and used a cookie cutter. They were wonderful! Next time I will make them a lot thicker because the bigger ones were definitely better (more "middle" tasty part). These were easy to make and incredible tasting.

These scones are just fabulous.  I made them and brought them to my daughter and her family for Christmas.  I made them with dried cranberries, chocolate chips and coconut.  I will be making these often.  My next try will be  with cranberries and orange zest. My son-in-law raved about them.  I knew they had to be good because he is a fantastic cook.  I'd rate this a 10 if I could.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.  I am very proud of myself.  Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed. Update: I just made these scones again today and I put in golden raisins, choc. chips and orange zest.  Also added 1 tsp. vanilla and cinnamon and also used brown sugar instead of white.  These are so fantastic.  The ultimate BEST.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I took the advice of others and added vanilla and lemon zest.  Wow did I impress my friends with this recipe. I made 2 batches, one with chocolate chips and the other with blackberrys topped with raw sugar.  The berry ones went first. Next time I will try lemon poppy seed with a sugar glaze. The dough freezes very well.

Wow!  This is a great scone recipe.  I put pecans into the dough.  They were oh so good. Because they are so potent, I made them smaller. I like to eat them as desert with vanilla ice cream.

Finally, a recipe that compares to scones found in coffee houses. Very yummy! Added raisins, walnuts, and cinnamon. Next time, will try with a little maple extract and pecans. Had to bake much longer though than what the recipe says (close to 30 mins.)

The only thing I wish could be different about this is that there were more than only 5 stars to rate the scones!! The absolute hands down best scone recipe that I've ever tasted. In my hometown we have a bakery that everyone says makes the best scones......and I can now make ever BETTER ones than they do in my own home!!! Didn't change a thing except adding half-a-cup of blueberries to half the dough. Wonderful!!!

I made these for my mother's monthly tea club.  They were a big hit!  They have an excellent texture and are just slightly sweet.  They freeze very well.

Wow! I've been addicted to All Recipes lately but this is the first review I just had to make. I halved the recipe because I was a little nervous. Then I got to the one egg part. Well, it was either do or don't. I did. The dough was a little wet and sticky but at that point I just had to chance it. I divided it in half and added orange zest and Craisins to one and dark chocolate chips and coconut to the other. Cut them into cute little wedges and in the oven they went. AMAZING!!! Now I'm afraid to make the original:) They were so moist and dense. I nearly burnt my mouth eating them just seconds out of the oven.

I love this recipe! I have made cinnamon-sugar "pinwheel" scones by rolling it out, spreading cinnamon sugar all over it, rolling it up and slicing them into little pinwheels. I've also added 1/2 cup cocoa powder and a tbs of sugar to make chocolate scones. They're ALWAYS a hit!

This turned out great! Its moist and buttery. I didn't have sour cream so I used one cup of buttermilk that I made from scratch using one cup of milk and one table spoon of white vinegar and let it rest for 5 min. It came out just as good!

Wow, what a perfect recipe.  I would say this is my very favorite recipe on this site.  I also made a gluten free version of these with Bob's Red Mill flour and some xanthan gum.  No one guessed they were gluten free and when I told all of my guests--after tons of complements they were pretty floored.  My favorite combination is bittersweet chocolate chips with very finely chopped walnuts.  I almost always add a little almond extract even if I'm using a different nut inside...I just love the flavor it adds and really isn't that what it's all about?

First time scone maker and I am sold.  I followed the directions for a basic scone leaving out the raisins and using 2 cups unbleached white flour and 2 cups whole wheat flour.  I also sprinkeled a little ground flax seed to feel healthy.  Once the dough was mixed I divided in half and added 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips to one half, 1 tsp almond extract and 1/2 cup craisins to the other.  I rolled the dough out onto a floured cutting board and cut scones using leaf shaped cookie cutters, then baked.  Delicious, everyone at work loved them.  Will definately make this again!

I make this recipe frequently and sometimes substitute unflavored yogurt for the sour cream.  I half the recipe and use 1 egg.  Excellent soft, moist scone

Love this recipe!  I use 1 1/2 cup of frozen blueberries instead of raisins in mine (work quickly once you get the blueberries in or your scones will be a nice purple colour!).  I agree with some other reviewers that the cook time is at least 10 minutes longer than the recipe says...so much of that depends on thickness, etc, and the fact that I put frozen fruit inside.  Regardless, this is a recipe I always make for brunches and company.  I love it!

I have made these several times now and LOVE them. They are the most amazing scones I have ever had, hands down, and a snap to make. Although I have made them exactly as instructed, I have also omitted the raisins and added blueberries, chocolate chips, and cinnamon. All varieties we have enjoyed. I made a "plain" batch today (minus the raisins) and served them as shortcakes with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.  My son is already begging me for more!! And have I mentioned they freeze great too?! Love this recipe! Thanks Rob!!

I just made this for my neighbor as a treat for Xmas and they are very good. I added a bit of vanilla and a cup of frozen blueberries. I finished it off with an egg wash and some sugar on top before going in the oven. Thanks for the recipe!

oh my goodness! these were fabulous! i tweaked the recipe quite a bit to make it healthier and it still turned out fabulous! here are my suggestions for tasty AND nutritious scones: use 3 cups whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup milled flax seed, and 1/2 cup wheat germ in place of the all purpose flour. use plain nonfat yogurt in place of the sour cream. i also halved the amount of sugar and used brown sugar instead and it was still PLENTY sweet! i threw in some slivered almonds and dried cherries and added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the dough. these were hearty AND delicious and you would never guess they were packed full of nutritious goodness!

Best I have ever had. Got this recipe from my friend carly. So good! Some tips she gave me where the following:   *When you add the wet ingredients, you can add vanilla or any other extract (orange, lemon, etc.). I do a couple teaspoons of each flavor. Orange goes well with dried cranberries, which I stir in where it says to add raisins. Vanilla combines well with lemon, or just vanilla alone is yummy too.  **When you have placed the scones on the baking sheet you can brush egg over the top of them to make the scones look more browned and “finished”. It’s just for looks, totally optional.  ***If you add berries, I recommend frozen berries to keep from “smushyness”. Cut large berries before adding, and add when the recipe says to add raisins. Any dried fruit could work as an add-in (craisins are my personal fave).  ****It says to cut in 12 pieces, but if you do these will be huge scones. I make 2 smaller rounds and cut about 8 wedges per round. You can also just make them square, but they are not as cute that way :)

WOW! These were great.This was my first attempt at making scones and I can't believe how easy it was. I used my food processor to cut in the butter. I added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract and substituted cranraisins for the raisins.Because the picture shows some icing, I drizzled some icing on the finished product(after they cooled down. Next time I'll cut the wedges into smaller pieces and bake in batches, as they spread more than I anticipated. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I love this site because of the reviews.  I only choose things that have five stars and rated by lots of people.  I made this and became the instant "queen of my castle" at home.  I started bringing them to school for the teachers and am now named the "scone fairy."  I add frozen red raspberries and white chocolate chips.  It doesn't get better than this and so easy.  I always have to use my hands in the last step to make everything come together.

First time ever making scones and they came out wonderful! I made mine with 1 1/2 cups of cranberries and 1/2 tablespoon of orange zest.  the cranberries are a must! They absolutely make the scones. I was a little bit intimidated about the kneading of the dough because it started out sticky in some parts and dry in others. But as soon as I kneaded the dough for 5 minutes it came together beautifully. They were extremely simple to make. Next time I will add chocolate chips to the batter ... YUM YUM!! ENJOY :)

Amazing!!!! Love these scones! Moist with a touch of sweet, easy to work with...a dream! I made orange zest, white chip and craisin, and a lemon poppy seed. My kids loved the mini chocolate chip ones. I even broke my mixer doubling the batch...my fault. But worth it! Won't try another scone recipe...the possiblities are endless. My next batch will be savory (I'll leave out the sugar) and make sundried tomato basil , and ham and cheese scones....when I get replacement beaters....:(

Oh, wow, have I been waiting to make these for a long time, and yesterday morning I finally got the chance.  First, let me just say that this recipe is the closest I have come to recreating the English scone that I basically lived off of when I was living in England.  It's dense and slightly crumbly with just-a-hint-of-sweetness that makes your mouth water just thinking about it.  I did cut the recipe in half, because I was only cooking for myself and my boyfriend, and twelve scones would have been far too much, despite the tastiness!  Even with it cut in half, however, I was able to make six hefty, perfect scones.  It did take a bit longer to cook than the recipe said; I ended up keeping mine in the oven for almost twenty minutes, until they were starting to brown around the edges on the top, but the bottoms were slightly golden and not scorched at all, as I was afraid they would.  I also decided to go plain and omit the raisins, but next time (yes, next time!) I'll definitely add something, maybe nuts and/or chocolate.  We ate them with strawberry preserves and, clotted cream, and tea, of course.  Take my advice, guys, this should be on your breakfast/brunch rotation!  It's definitely on mine.

These are wonderful and addictive! I've never tasted such a fragrant, tender, delicately flavored scone. I don't understand the reviews that call them "too plain", as I could happily scarf down most of a batch with no jam or anything. Maybe too many people's palates are becoming used to powerful artificial flavorings and super sweetness? I made the recipe both using whole milk plain yogurt and using sour cream, and the yogurt produces a moister, more cake-like scone that spreads more during baking. Made with sour cream they're more biscuitlike and rise higher. Either way delicious. I love them with lemon rind added and the tops dipped into lemon sugar before baking and my husband loves them with chopped tart apples and cinnamon sugar on top.

Yuk - very bland and boring, no matter what it's dressed up with.  Traditional English scones - warm from the oven with cream and jam.  Nothing beats them!

I've made these scones over a dozen times.  Brought it to my co-workers, to my husband's co-workers, for friends, even for my ob's office when I had my baby - always brings smiles and  compliments and gracious thank-yous.    
It's one of those recipes that is so easy to make that I'll make if I have some sour cream sitting in my fridge.     
I always use the ingredients as per the recipe but I usually bake for 18 min.  
I also soak the raisins in lukewarm water before throwing them in the dough.  
One thing that really helps me with this recipe is my pastry cutter.  It cuts the butter into the flour very nicely.

These also get my vote for best scone ever!  I followed the recipe to the letter.  Whenever a recipe calls for cutting in butter I grab my food processor and it did the job on this recipe quickly and perfectly with only a few pulses.  I suspect this is one of those doughs, like biscuits and pie crust, that do best with the least amount of handling. I do believe that mixing the dough could be better accomplished, with less handling, by putting the dry ingredients directly on a flat sanitized surface (or wax paper), creating a well in the middle, adding the wet ingredients to the well and mixing gently by hand.  Don't fret, the dry mess WILL come together with just a little kneading!  It's a fairly forgiving dough as I handled this more than I would have liked and still had good results.  You can simply pat the dough into a circle by hand.  For this first batch I added 1 c. roughly chopped dry cranberries and the zest from one whole orange.  The Krusteaz company makes a regionally available cranberry orange scone mix that we dearly love, but that I can only find in Colorado grocery stores.  Grandma Johnson's Scones are every bit as delicious, just as easy and readily available.  This is NOT good news for my diet!!

I decided to try this recipe based on reviews, but was disappointed with the results. I made the scones with cinnamon as some suggested, but felt the scones tasted like 3/4 inch pie dough. Sorry Grandma Johnson.

Just thought I'd jump on the Grandma Johnson bandwagon....these are great!!! I used fat free sour cream, subbed in about half white whole wheat flour and used cinnamon chips instead of raisins. I brushed the tops with half and half and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. Made 16 good sized scones. Very light and fluffy. Will make again.

This was so simple! I only made half of the batch (still added one whole egg) and divided the dough to make some with cranberries and sliced almonds, some with almonds alone, some with cinnamon sugar coating and some with english toffee bits. Mmmm.

The most wonderful scones I have ever made. I omitted the raisins and added 1 teaspoon of almond extract and 3 teaspoons of cherry juice; including diced up cherries to the top of the scones before baking. very tasty.

I have been wanting to make my own scones since I went to London 2 yrs ago!  Store bought and even bakery ones I've tried...were never just quite what I hoped.  I just made these scones!!! OMG they are better than good, they are even better than the ones I had in England...(ok it's been 2 yrs but still!)  I knew ahead of time I was going to add white choc chips (1cup) and cranberry/cran raisins, (1cup) I cut them out in heart shapes...they look as good as they taste...moist, yet still have that scone consistency...I used 3/4 cup sugar instead of a cup, since I added the white choc chips..still wonderful!  Will try different combinations next time.

Just made these today and it was really good! I used cake flour and added milk chocolate chips to mine. The dough was really sticky and the only shape I could manage was to make them into biscuit rounds. I also made them quite large so my total baking time was about 25 minutes. My kids loved them and so did I. Will make again for sure! Oh, don't forget to sprinkle a little sugar on top before baking....I think it really adds to the scones.

These are so good. I have made them gobs of times, using several variations and a couple of different sizes depending on how many circles you pat them into before you cut them like a pizza. The only sorta hard or time consuming this is cutting in the butter so I get out the food processor. Since it is dirty already, I go ahead and cut in the butter into the butter for several batches and I put each batch into a baggie and into the freezer. Now we are only minutes from having scones at any time. My last variation was 1 Tbl of almond extract. We used them as a base for strawberry shortcake! I got raves.

I initially made these scones because of all the rave reviews. Practiced twice and served at my daughter's after-wedding brunch in September. People couldn't believe I had made them. As others have said, the only downside is that it's tempting to bake more and more. I gained 5 lbs in 2 weeks! Incredibly easy, many variations (I liked dried cherries, husband liked raspberry-flavored cranberries in place of the raisins.) I found it more practical to bake smaller scones: cut the pie-shaped pieces in half, cutting from one of the two outside-edge corners to the middle of the opposite side of each piece. Out of about 15 times making these different ways, they only failed once - and that was when I forgot the egg!

What a great recipe! I halved the dough, adding lemon extract to one and almond extract to the other. I also subbed 2 cups wheat flour for 2 of the white flour. I made a simple lemon glaze with confectioners sugar and lemon juice for lemon scones and melted chocolate chips to drizzle over the almond scones. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

Really great recipe, came out just like the picture.  I substituted Plain Yogurt for Sour Cream (because I didn't have sour cream) and again squares of margarine for butter.  Can't imagine them being any better if I used the right ingriediants they were great and the family loved them too.  I added a bit more sugar because I read some reviews that said weren't sweet enough.  I also split into 4 and made cheese, blueberry, craisin and chocolate chip.  Came out with 4 of each.  The blueberry turned out fine because I used fresh and put them in as I was putting the dough out on the pastry sheet to cut.  I wouldn't use frozen as it would get pretty messy and the dough is stiff.  Thanks Grandma Johnson :)

Very good scone recipe - not JUST like an authentic scone - but pretty good.  These were served at a baby shower and were eaten up very quickly.   I added some blueberries to some and sprinkled some with cinnamon and sugar.

I did mine with chocolate chips and it was wonderful...although I needed to bake it more like 15-20 minutes.  The baking time may depend of what type of stove you're using.  Also, the recipe could easily make 24 good sized scones instead of 12.  They are delicious!

Very tender, and delicious.  I've just made these as written, but I think it would be a wonderful starting point to come up with a few flavor variations.  I love the maple oat scones at starbucks.  Any ideas on creating those with this recipe?

These are so yummy!  I made them for a bridal shower and used a small round cup to cut them with and dusted them with sugar, they were very popular.  My son ate three before I could put them away for the shower.  They seem to get better after a day or two.  Very moist and delicious.

Delicious! I several mistakes while trying this recipe (rolled the dough slightly too thick, placed scones too close together on the cookie sheet), and they still came out wonderfully. I used mini chocolate chips instead of raisins. I was a little worried at first, as I had never made scones before, and they looked a little to doughy. But they were just fine. I did have to bake them longer than the recipe said, due to the thickness of my scones. Will definitely  make again!

I ended up dividing mine into 3 batches because everyone mentioned how large they ended up being: the first batch, I used orange zest and craisins, the second I used lemon zest and poppy seeds and the third was cinnamon sprinkled with turbinado (raw) sugar. I cut each circle into 8ths resulting in 24 scones (perfectly sized).  There were only 3 left over from the baby shower I hosted!  I brought them into work and this is what my co-worker just sent me: "Thank God I got two of them.  They're Great!  Thanks!"

Very delicious recipe! I took someone else's advice and added nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, and more sugar. The scones came out great. The only downside was that the dough was quite hard to work with and it made too many. I will definetely make it again, but I think I'll cut the recipe in half next time. My family loved them! Thank you Rob!

YUM YUM YUM!!! I love scones and had gotten addicted to the lemon scones at Starbucks -- they are nothing compared to these.   I made new varietes based on this recipe by adding extracts to teh sour cream mixture just before blending -- lemon, cranberry orange, and cinnamon raisin.  They were all great!  These also freeze really well.  I divide the dough into half or thirds though before final kneading and shaping as these were quite large.  They still come out a decent size.  Mix it gently lie pie crust, an they will be great!

Wow - what a great recipe!  It was my first try at scones, and what a thrill that they were so tasty.  My husband and kids loved them, too, which surprised me. I also added dried cranberries, which were a good addition.  I followed the advice not to handle it too much; in fact, the dough was still in crumbly pieces when I put it on the kneading board.  I kneaded it just long enough for everything to hang togeher.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used chocolate chips instead of raisins and bread flower instead of all purpose- turned out great!  They were very moist.  I did have to bake them for a full 15 minutes to brown the bottoms.

Update: tried making these without chocolate chips, but instead, kneeded in a mixture of 1 cup unpacked brown sugar and 4t cinnamon before cutting with a cookie cutter.  I baked them for 18 minutes and they turned out great.

I have never had so many requests for more. I've made these with cranberries. Blueberries. Apricots. I think apricots are everyone's favorite.

Love this! This recipe will definitely be part of my regular baking for years to come! Didn't have cream of tartar so I just put in one extra tsp baking powder. I wanted savory scones so i cut the sugar in half and doubled the salt. Also added a heaping cup of shredded cheddar. Rolled it out and used heart shaped cookie cutter. Perfectly baked at 350 for 13 mins! So good!!!

Use large bowls! And You don't need a whole cup of butter. No difference in taste or texture. Use 11 tbsps (1 tbsp less than 3/4cup)instead of 1 cup, make sure to cut in cold, unsalted butter. The edges of the scones are the best part so cut or shape them smaller than suggested, they double in size. These aren't super dense scones, but not too fluffy either. If you cook them about 5 minutes past done, they're even better. Next time I will exclude the egg for even less fluff.
The Sour cream when mixed with the baking soda will rise and overflow if you mix it in too small a bowl (like I did).
If making cranberry orange scones, I used the zest of 1 large navel orange and it was just barely detecable. Next time I will use 1.5 oranges or 2.
Yummy scones! brush with egg wash on top before cooking.

This is an excellent recipe for scones, and will now be my one and only scone recipe! We absolutely loved this recipe.  The only thing that I did differently, was the way I prepared the ingredients. Like another reviewer suggested, it is best to cream the butter and sugar together in a large bowl, mix the sour cream and baking soda in a separate bowl, and mix the dry ingredients in another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture followed by the sour cream mixture.  I added only 2/3 cup of sugar and when the scones came out of the oven I brushed agave syrup over the top.  Thank you Rob for an awesome recipe.

This scones are SO good and the recipe so forgiving, that I made a mistake and they were STILL excellent!  I only used 8 ounces of sour cream and the dough of course was dry!  I looked at this recipe to be similar to a pie crust so I added enough cold water to hold it together.  My son brought them to work and everyone raved about them.  Now I don't know if I should make it the correct way next time or not.  I can't imagine them being any better!  Bottom line, if you don't have enough sour cream, they will STILL be excellent!  :)

Great recipe! It definitely makes twice as many scones as it says, though. I used white whole wheat flour and beat the egg with vanilla and got lovely, delicate scones-the whole family thought they were delicious. I've made them twice in two weeks and will definitely be making them again (maybe a variation...pumpkin sounds good.)

LOVE THESE!   So easy, and like others have said, you can split the dough and do two different kinds at once!  My husband says he doesn't like scones, but these never last more than three days at our house.  I like using cinnamon sugar with a little milk to dust on the tops instead of raisins, and I have added fresh cherries too.  Very flexible recipe!

DELICIOUS!  Great base recipe, very forgiving.  Here are some of the hints I used with great success:  use 3/4 cup of butter, divide the dough in half (otherwise the scones will be HUGE,) make two flavors (just add a teaspoon of desired extract to each half,) handle the dough as little as possible, flour your rolling surface liberally or add in just enough additional flour to reduce stickiness, bake at 375* for about 20-25 minutes. I found for the ease of preparation, cream the butter and sugar (forget cutting it in--it will be O.K.)  If you chose to do this, shape scones and allow the halves to rest in the refrigerator overnight.  Bake-off in the A.M.  Even the second day the scones were wonderfully moist.  I even tested the frozen scone theory, and it worked out great!  Just place a frozen/uncooked scone in a 350* oven (temperature adjusted for the frozen factor) for about 25-30 minutes--delicious.  I glazed my scones out of the oven and topped with turbinado sugar.  Enjoy the versatility and flavor of these scones TODAY.

The dough itself is pretty good, but the recipe as written needs lots of changes.  For one, 12 triangular scones make for scones that are WAAYYY too big, these need to be in either two discs cut into 12 scones EACH, or just rolled into 24 round scones.  Also, the flavor is quite bland and I recommend adding either lemon zest with lemon extract, or orange zest with orange extract.  Maybe finely diced strawberries or blueberries on top of that.  PLUS they took way longer to cook than written, and I have a brand new calibrated oven so I know that's not the problem.  After they had cooked at least 20 mins I ended up cutting them in half and putting them back in, and they still cooked another maybe 10 to 15 mins.  Honestly I think they could have used  few more mins too.  OH also, sprinkle a little coarse sugar on top for a nice crust.  --Different people like different things and perhaps in certain parts of the country these are the way scones are, here they are smaller, more flavorful and just a bit different.  THank you for the recipe! :-)

This is a great recipe I have tried other scone recipes and they have failed miserably. These are great and so moist, very much like starbucks scones. I didn't have sour cream so I used Greek yogurt instead (yum) and I didn't have cream of tartar so I just used an addtional 1/4 tsp of baking powder. I made cinnamon scones so I mixed 1/2 cup room temp butter with 1/2 c dark brown sugar 4 tsps of cinn and 1/4 c sugar and then mixed that into the rest of the dry ingredients along with the egg and other half cup butter. Also used salted butter. These came out delish! For fun presentation I pressed brown sugar and cinnamon into the top of my round before cutting so when it cooked it made a cracked sugar topping.

Really, really good recipe.  I used Lucia de Wagner's instructions even though they were unlike any scone instructions I'd ever read. I am glad I did because it was very easy to mix these up using the mixer and the texture of the cooked scones was perfect - moist with a good crumb.  The dough did seem a little dry as I was mixing in the sour cream (using my hands) but suddenly it all came together and then seemed a little sticky.  Many of the reviewers who didn't like these added extra liquid at that point and I think that was probably what led to them not enjoying the finished product.  I put the dough on a floured board to form the circle and decided to make it into 2 circles for a total of 16 large scones.  Next time I will make them smaller.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup because my add-ins were about 1 cup of crisp bacon bits, about 1 1/2 cups grated cheese and 1/4 of an onion browned along with the bacon as it cooked.  The first bite was a little sweet for a savoury scone but after that they were addictive.  The baking time was a little short at 350 so I added 4 minutes and even then the bottoms were just beginning to brown.  The tops still looked uncooked.  Next time I will cook them at 375 or 400 and hope I get a more appetizing looking top.  I am making a sweet batch maybe with cinnamon and nuts later this afternoon.  Love these.

Wow!  Never made scones before.  These were so easy and so delicious.  I split the batter and made half chocolate chip and the other half with dried cranberries and orange zest topped with an orange glaze made with orange juice and powdered sugar.  I am a fan!

I have been baking these for several years. I first baked them for a tea we were giving, then I made them for a woman who was willing to pay for them. I also made over a hundred of them for our church tea. They are already asking me to make them this coming year. Last Christmas I made them for gifts for my daughter's children teacher's gifts. This are the pertect scone and I have made others they don't come close to these. Thanks for a geat recipe.

So easy and delicious!  Soft and delicate.  Don't do like me, however, and mix the baking soda straight into the container of sour cream.  It mushrooms up and expands like crazy and you end up with a mess!  :)

UPDATE:  I just made these again but replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with 1/2 cup of cocoa powder.  This is delicious!  They are not too sweet but the depth of the chocolate tastes delicious with some homemade lemon curd!  I will be adding chocolate chips to this version next time per hubby's request :)

This was the perfect recipe for beginners in the scone business! I had made a batch for my boyfriend and he devoured them! Of course, I read other reviewers' advice and concocted their successful recipe: I took Lucia de Wagner's advice and mixed accordingly, then I made the orange-cranberry scones that poshbeki suggested,adding an orange glaze of orange peel orange juice, and confectioner's sugar as the came out of the oven. I followed the original recipe in cutting them into 12 big triangles. I let them cool over night and served them up for a nice brunch!  My only thing is that cutting them into 12 slices makes them very big!I recommend littler slices. Other than that, 5 stars!

Delicious and simple to make... I split the dough into three.  Made one with mini-chocolate chips, one with frozen blueberries and lemon zest, and one with dried cranberries and orange zest.  I formed each third into a long rectangle and cut triangles out of that, making about 30 mini-scones.  They do rise a lot so they will be huge if you only get 12 pieces out of the dough!

Wow, this is tasty.  I added blueberries to my scones (I soaked them in a tsp of brandy vanilla - they were frozen) and followed a tip from another reviewer, I brushed the tops of the scones with cream and then sprinkled them with demerara sugar.  Oh, also, I replaced 1/2 cup of sugar with whole wheat flour and reduced the sugar by about three tablespoons (I was worried adding the berries would make it too sweet).  Kneading the dough was difficult with all the cold butter bits and blueberries, but I managed to pat it into a circle and then cut them into pie-shaped pieces.  My son took one look at all the wedges on the parchment paper lined cookie sheet and said, 'that looks like blue cheese!' He was right, it did look like blue cheese and I thought, oh no, this will never turn out.  I turned the oven light on and saw butter bubbling out of the scones at 5 mins and was sure these were destined for the trashcan.  My worries were confirmed when they weren't done at 15 mins, then 20, finally, 23 mins! They were done and so delish, I ate two, slathered with lemon curd and butter.  Perfection.

This is the best scone recipe out there. They are moist, tender and delicious! I've made them for showers and parties and everyone always raves about them! One thing, I've made these as directed mixing the baking soda and sour cream AND I've made them just adding the baking soda to the dry ingredients and adding the sour cream with the eggs. THEY TURN OUT EXACTLY THE SAME! So, save yourself another bowl to wash and don't bother with the sour cream/b. soda mixture! I like to use dried cherries or dried blueberries in mine and make a lemon glaze with 2T lemon juice and  cup powdered sugar and drizzle over the top when cool. They're also good with egg wash and sugar sprinkled on top before baking and served with a good quality jam or fruit preserves!

Best scone recipe ever!!! I was searching for a good recipe that is suitable for my brother's coffee shop and this is the best one so far.  The texture is perfect, crispy outside, soft and moist inside.  It actually DOES taste better than the Starbucks one.    I made a bunch and freeze the doughs into preshaped scone, and just toss in the oven whenever I want.  It doesn't taste as good if you bake them all and reheat them the second time, since the skin can't be as crispy as the freshly baked ones.  Tip: Make sure use a good brand of butter, it makes a HUGE difference.

I've done a plain batch (without raisins), mini chocolate chips (substituting 1 C mini-chocolate chips for the raisins), and orange cranberry (adding 1 C dried cranberries and the juice and zest of one orange to the mix, topping with a glaze of orange juice, powdered sugar and orange zest). Every single batch has vanished within a couple days. Make sure you don't overmix this recipe...a light hand makes big fluffy scones!

I made into 4 rounds and cut each round into 4 to 6 triangles and they make plenty (I can't imagine how big they'd be if made in the way described).  I didn't find that they spread that much.  I didn't have any cream of tartar and so used 1/2 tsp of vinegar and it worked out well.  I made one batch plain, one with fresh blueberries, one with fresh blackberries, and one with chocolate chips -- all were great.  I put them in the oven for about 11 to 12 minutes and they were just right.  Delicious, but very rich!  Everyone in the family loved them!

These were great!  Tiny changes (shortcuts) I made:  add the egg into the sour cream mixture rather than the dry stuff; mix dry ingredients and cut in butter in your food processor with the bottom blade (may have do do in two batches) - SO much easier!  Be sure to not overwork the mix.  I made three batches:  lemon poppyseed, orange cranberry, and mini chocolate chip.  I found about a cup of "mix ins" and/or a tablespoon of citrus zest worked well for one batch.  Also, the ones I thought I burned (they got a little brown on the edges) actually tasted best; take them out when they have JUST started to brown on the corners.

The first time I made these scones, I made a big mess. They came out tasting great, but it was a lot of hassle. This second time, I used the food processor to cut the butter into the flour. (Tip: Dont put all 4 cups of flour into the processor. Cut all the butter into 2 cups of flour and add it to the remaining 2 cups.) I did add about 2 Tb. milk to the final mix to blend it better. I found a dried blueberry/cherry/cranberry blend at the store and it is fantastic in these! I drizzle a little melted white chocolate on top and they're perfect. Oh, and I didn't have a full cup of sour cream, so I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 plain mayonnaise and they were to die for!

This was DELICIOUS!!!  A few changes I made: used plain, unsweetened yogurt instead of sour cream.  Also made a glaze with cinnamon, powdered sugar, and fresh orange juice... this was GREAT with the raisins!  Finally, I recommend STRONGLY that you use a Kitchen Aid to mix this... it was a HUGE mess by hand... just use your dough hook and mix briefly before kneading.  But oh, so  worth it!!

With all the 5* reviews I don't really need to add mine but I will anyway.  I have been making these for about a year now and  I can't tell you how many times I've passed on the recipe. I use real butter but usually use light sour cream. I found that cutting into 12 are  too big. I usually make 3 circles cut into 8. This is a perfect size for me. I have made them with lemon zest and poppyseeds, cherries or canberries,orange zest and white chocolate, also with toffee bits.  What ever I put in them everyone raves. These are definately  better than the expensive coffee house scones. Many thanks to Grandma Johnson.

These are AWESOME!  I cater a tea for 130 women every spring and I took a chance on these this year...I figured they had to be good with over six hundred 5 star reviews and I was not disappointed.  This year I got RAVE REVEIWS on the scones...I omitted the raisins and served them right out of the oven with mock Devonshire Cream (heavy whipping cream, cream cheese and a bit of powdered sugar) and women were fighting over the crumbs in the bottom of the baskets.  I made 16 rectangles (instead of 12) out of each recipe and they were still HUGE.  This is the only scone recipe I will EVER use again! I can't wait to try them at home with some of the variations suggested!!

Excellent scones.  I make scones often and found the "simple scones" recipe on allrecipes to be the same as this one but half the amount and no tarter.  Both tasted great.  This recipe was more time consuming, you have to knead (more messy, more cleanup), and I had to do two batches in my oven when making 12 instead of 8 scones. Otherwise they are the same so I will keep using the "simple scones" recipe.

I searched the comments on these for a pumpkin version.  Found it, made them, got rave reviews!

I also came up with a Cranberry Orange Spice version: 1 Cup sugar = 1/2 cup white sugar + 1/2 cup brown sugar, to the flour mixture add 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. ginger, 1/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, pinch of cloves, and 3 tsp. orange zest, 1 Cup raisins = 1 cup craisins.  THESE make THE BEST HOLIDAY BREAKFAST!  This is the recipe I've been searching for for years.  THANK YOU!

These are the best scones I've ever eaten anywhere.  People are SO impressed by these.  I think it may be a good idea to cream the sugar into the butter before adding to the flour because its hard to "cut" the butter in.  I made a mess trying to do it with an electric beater.  (I finally made my boyfriend beat the butter in by hand!)  After adding in the egg and sour cream mixture, I just worked the dough together by hand because it was the most effective.  
Anyway, I seperated into two balls and added frozen blueberries to one (the dough gets a little blue but they still taste great) and raisins to the other.  Then I sprinkled cinnamon & sugar to the raisin ones and just sugar on the blueberry.  Cook for the max time of 15 mins.  I baked the night before a brunch, stored them in tupperware after cooled, and were still great the next morning.

I have never made scones before, but I brought these to my parents and my in-laws for Father's Day. Everyone loved them, especially my father-in-law who LOVES scones- he said these were the best he's ever had.  I don't have a scone pan, but I rolled them out and cut into triangles.  I did some with mini choc chips and walnuts, some blueberry, and some with fresh (frozen) cranberries and walnuts (those were the BEST).  These didn't last the day, they were so popular!

Excellent!  I made cinnamon scones by adding 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 cup cinnamon chips, and a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar on top before baking, and they were out of this world!  My kids love them, and my husband said I had to join Allrecipes so that I could submit the five-star rating this recipe deserves.  So I did!  Very tender scones with great flavor.

Deelish!  I just put the leftovers away, and know that they will be a great pick-me-up for my co-workers tomorrow morning!  
I made this recipe my own by taking others advice to use 1c whole wheat flour and 3c all-purpose, and also to add 1 tsp. cinnamon, and 1 tsp. vanilla (added with the egg).  
I made it "lighter" by ony 1/2c sugar, l. cream cheese for half the butter, and fat free sour cream.  I also added 1/8 tsp. nutmeg to everything from research on scones.  
For high altitute baking, I added another egg (can also do egg substitute), and subtracted a couple tablespoons of flour.
I then split the dough in half and added raisins, soaked in hot water for five minutes and coated with cinnamon and sugar, to half.  To the other half, I added chopped up walnuts and chocolate chips.  Both are wonderful!  I then brushed milk on the tops, and sprinkled on cinnamon/sugar before baking.  
Thanks Grandma Johnson!  :0)

LOVED IT!  These scones are SO much like the ones I had in England.  I added the zest of one lemon and a cup of blueberries as another reviewer suggested, and it was absolutely fabulous.  

I at first had trouble deciding when my scones were done, but I caught on after a while-- the scones are done when you can take them up with a pancake turner and they don't want to break in half.  

I cut my scones into 8 instead of 12, and they took longer to bake.  I suggest staying with the 12 slices that the recipe recommends.  These scones are very filling, too, and larger servings can be too much.  

I also made the clotted cream recipe on this site.  It's not *true* clotted cream, but it went extremely well with this scone recipe.  If you make the cream too, I'd suggest making the cream the night before, because it's a bit time consuming to make both at the same time.  

This is an excellent and easy recipe that I will make time and again.

HOLY YUM!
I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted 1 cup wheat flour.  I added thawed blueberries to half the dough.  They were great!  I ate scones for a couple of days.  Even my 3 year old loved them!

These scones are the best!  A great recipe to experiment with adding raisins, currants, chocolate chips, whatever!  So delicious with a good cup of tea!  The dough is a bit crumbly, but I just smashed it together into a mound.

This recipe is awesome.  I used blueberries in mine and sprinkled them with cinnamon/sugar mixture before baking.  Once they were done I made an icing of conf. sugar and milk which went very well.  Definitely a keeper!

Definitely a forgiving recipe.  I limit dairy so I used soy sour cream and margarine.  I also used whole wheat flour and turbinado sugar.  I split the dough in half and added almond extract, dried cherries, and sliced almonds to one half and vanilla extract, chocolate chips, and flaked coconut to the other half.  I divided each half into twelve pieces and threw them on a cookie sheet.  Even with all the changes, these turned out wonderfully.  Everyone loved them, especially the cherry almond ones.

This was exactly what I was looking for! I love the blueberry scones at Starbucks, so I added blueberries to mine instead of raisins. I was really worried b/c I have never made scones b/f. I just took the advice of others such as using less butter, and adding sugar on top. They were great! The only modification I would make is to brush them w/ egg wash b/f baking so they turn a golden color. I will definitely keep this recipe and make these many times! Thank you Grandma Johnson! :)

These are delicious!!!!  Very quick and easy to make with ingredients you have on hand.  I split the dough in half.  Made half with semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I mixed plain cinnamon in the other half of the dough and then sprinkled the tops with cinnamon/sugar before baking.  My kids loved them!  They are already talking about which flavors they want to make next time.  Personally, I'm anxious to try lemon and blueberry!  I must admit they were a bit sweeter than what I was expecting, but I'm not complaining!!!  I will probably take the advice of other reviewers and make them a little smaller next time.  A bit of advice from me -- don't waste your time trying to roll them out.  It's much easier and faster to just pat the dough out.  Now back to the kitchen -- for another...

I've made these a few times but last time I forgot to add the butter (just missed that step) and although the dough was hard to get together, they still turned out tasty!  A bit more crumbly than the original, but I think I'll cut the butter way down from now on, to maybe half a stick.

This is a keeper!  I was hesitant to try my hand at scones after a horrible mishap a year ago resulting in a batch of triangular hockey pucks, but with this recipe there is nothing to fear!  Instead of raisins, I made one batch with cinnamon coated apples and another with blueberries and white chocolate chips.  Both got rave reviews from coworkers, but the blueberry was my personal favorite.  They were very flavorful, buttery, and moist; easily the best scones I've ever had.  If you're going to use fresh blueberries, be warned... it makes for a very messy kitchen as the moisture from the blueberries makes the dough stick to everything.  I found it much easier to pat the dough rather than roll it.

All I have to say is "this is the best!"
If you like scones, but want it moist, this is the recipe.  I've made mini chocolate chip & cinnamon scones with a glaze, lemon raspberry, and blueberry.  
Heat it up in the microwave the next day for 8-10 seconds, it's just as good!

These turned out excellent. The only adjustment made was the bake time, which far exceeded the 14 minutes listed. I omitted the raisins and created a lemon scone (my favorite) by adding a lemon glaze for the top, combining lemon juice, powdered sugar and corn starch. I'll be making these often!

If you haven't tried scones before they are more like a sweet biscuit than a cookie.  If you like it more "cookyish".  Roll a little thinner, cut a little smaller and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar before baking.  These were too large for me.  I can make about twice as many from the same recipe.

Found this recipe on Monday, made them that evening for a book club brunch on Tuesday.  They were great!  Half with craisins, half with cinnamon chips.  Brushed tops with egg/milk wash, sprinkled w/ cinnamon sugar.  Used a very small round cookie cutter, so they were about 2-3 bites each.  Made about 40 of them.  Cinnamon were the best, the craisins were a little chewy and browned, I would soak them first next time in OJ.  Can't wait to make them again.  (They do need a little more baking time.)

OH MY GOODNESS!  My family regularly requests these scones (served with raspberry jam and clotted cream) for brunch.  Everytime I have ever served these I am asked for the recipe.  A recent returnee from the UK announced that these scones were better than any that they had while enjoying high tea abroad!!  I use chilled butter (flakier result) and parchment paper on my cookie sheet for non-stick and ease of transfer.  Thanks for this recipe, Rob and much thanks to Grandma Johnson!!

Wow - these were awsome.  They were a huge hit, I added 2 t. of a cinnamon spice mixture and some currents.  Next time I will let them sit out for a few hours so they get a little hard.  I can't wait to try them with orange zest and crasins soaked in OJ.

This is really simple and good.  I added about a half cup of orange juice concentrate and more than a cup of dried cranberries and everyone really liked them.  Will use this recipe again!

These are not like any scones I have ever had. They tasted quite a bit like a cakey sugar cookie. I didnt care for them much but my 1 year old liked them.

These were the best scones I've ever had.  They were just like some my husband bought at a Renaissance fair years ago and have been highly praised by every member of our family.  They aren't that hard to make and are certainly worth the effort.  We like them plain with jam and clotted cream.

I have made this recipe as written a dozen times and everyone loves it!  To lighten it up for everyday use I use white whole wheat flour, reduce sugar by half, reduce butter by half and add about 6 tbsp of buttermilk (or milk, half and half, heavy cream, whatever you have) to keep it more moist.  I have also replaced one cup of flour with whole oats on occasion.  Both variations create yummy scones also.  Again, the recipe as written is WONDERFUL but IF you want to lighten it up a bit don't worry about playing with a recipe :)

I just made the most amazing scones using this recipe. I didn't have sour cream so I used yogurt. I added lemon and orange zest and 2 tbsp lemon juice. This will be my go to recipe for scones. Thank you.

I never made scones before but everyone raved about the scones, so I will make them again. I just topped them off with some milk and sour cream before baking them.

Great recipe!  I used vanilla Greek yogurt (Great Value brand), since I was out of sour cream.  I did have to bake them a few minutes longer, but they turned out delicious & moist!  They were absolutely superb fresh out of the oven (kids couldn't keep their hands off!!), and still very tasty the next day.  I separated into 3 rounds, and pressed chocolate chips into the top of one, butterscotch chips into another, and fresh cranberries into another.  All 3 were VERY good, but chocolate chip seemed to be the favorite.  :)  Tonight I added about 1 tsp. coconut extract to about half of the dough, and pressed coconut flakes into the top before baking.  That is also REALLY good, but next time I'll add more extract for a stronger flavor.  Definitely recommend!

There wasn't nearly enough liquid so I added half and half. The dough was still hard to work with and when they were baking, all of the butter separated out. My family enjoyed the taste of the end result.

Hands-down, the best scone recipe I've ever used.  Or even eaten.  Not dry at all, the sour cream makes such a difference.  They're addicting though, so I don't make them often.  I especially like to use dark chocolate chips (chunks) instead of the raisins and drizzle the top with a tiny bit of coarse sea salt for the contrast.

Best scones I have ever had the supreme pleasure of eating! I have made this recipe twice now: first time I did cranberry/orange with cinnamon and the second time I made lemon/poppy seed. Both topped with a confection sugar icing and both excellent. My husband begs me to make these for him on a regular basis now.

These are pretty tasty! Followed the recipe mostly. Subbed plain nonfat Greek yogurt for the sour cream, and added 2 tsp cinnamon to the dry mix, and 1 tsp vanilla. Divided the finished "batter" in half, adding 1/2 cup walnuts (finely chopped) and 1/2 c chocolate chips to one half, and 2 tsp lemon extract and 1 c frozen blueberries to the other half. Each half made about seven nicely sized scones; I just rolled the dough into balls and pushed them flat with my hand. Baked at 350 for 23 minutes. Yum!

This was delicious.  I used cold butter that I cut up into small cubes and mixed with a pastry blender.  Then I used my favorite utensil on a lightly floured counter (my hands) to get to the right consistency.  I also added a zest of one orange and a few handfuls of dried cranberries.  Yummy cranberry orange scones that my friends and family loved!

We make at least 10 dozen a week at Sweet Arts Bakery, Avon NY. One of my best sellers!  The beauty is that we make them on Monday and freeze them, then take the out and bake as needed. I've even taught them our baking classes.  Thank you, Grandma Johnson!

After making these scones over 30 times, I have come up with a couple of observations...
//
Overmixing makes them dry.
//
I see no use for the cream of tarter, and they taste much better without it.

Cutting the butter in is a necessary evil.

Made these exactly as written and they are delicious.
Secret to any buiscut like this is to minimize the amount that you mix and handle the dough.

Excellent! I have made this wonderful recipe a few different ways, it is very versatile. My fav is to add 1c. dried cherries instead of raisins, 1.5c(more/less depending on your preference)toasted sliced almonds, & to the egg or wet ing I add 1.5tsp almond ext +1tsp vanilla. If you like almond these are delicious!

I love making mini scones and mixing in different fillings -- chocolate chips, lemon zest and chopped walnuts, shredded Asiago cheese, dried cranberries, dried cherries and chopped almonds, etc!!  It's a frequent request when we do breakfast potluck in the office!  We had a Scone fest at my house and came up with fabulous flavors -- Bacon chocolate, jalapeno bacon Asiago, raspberry lemon zest, cranberry orange pumpkin seed, blueberry cream cheese, as well as more traditional flavors.  This is an awesome base recipe.  Thanks, Grandma Johnson!!

Super yummy!  I made cranberry & white chocolate scones my first time, & they turned out great.  I failed at shaping them right, but who cares when they taste good.  I will make them smaller next time.

I made cinnamon sugar scones by adding: 1/2 c. sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1 tsp. vanilla. Brushed on milk and topped with cinnamon, sugar mixture. Mine took 18 minutes.

I freaked when it was very dry at first and then quickly turned sticky. Got it under control, but might use a food processor in the future. 

I made two rounds of 6 (12), but might might try 3 rounds of 6 (18) for smaller, kid-sized scones. These make 12 big, coffee house sized scones. Awesome!

This recipe is a KEEPER!! I have made these twice so far, AMAZING! The only thing I changed was used mini chocolate chips in place of the raisins. As others have stated, the cook time is longer than 12-15 minutes. Probably more like 25 minutes. It is well worth the wait!!  My husband and daughters love them! Looking forward to trying some other variations! Thanks Grandma Johnson for such a wonderful recipe!!!!

Incredible scones. Absolutely fantastic. Used 3/4 cup gran sugar + 1/4 brown sugar I make myself that is extra dark. Added 1 T of cinnamon. Divided dough in half and put 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips and sprinkles (for kids) in half, and 1/2 cup blackberries in the other. I made some powdered sugar and then made a lemon glaze for the blackberry scones, drizzled it over, and those were the favorite by far. I was told they were the best scones people had ever had. Absolutely fantastic, thank you! I did end up needing to bake them for a total of about 22 minutes, though.

UPDATE
Made another batch today for Mother's Day. Did 1c blackberries for the entire batch, no brown sugar, no cinnamon, just a dash of vanilla. I plan on doing a lemon juice/powdered sugar glaze again. I did one round, 12 wedges, and notice I preferred what I did the first time: two rounds, 24 total wedges. They baked up in 15 minutes today, even with the larger size, so I'm not sure why my first batch of smaller scones took 22 minutes! Maybe I had two pans in at once. Tsk, tsk ;)

Yum yum! I didn't have raisins (although I will the next time I make this recipe), so I added just a bit of vanilla, oh my goodness. My mother and I made a pot of tea and ate these with some jelly. Thank you!!

Delicious!  I made 1/2 with dried cranberries (about 1/2 cup) and topped them with sliced almonds and a drizzle of powdered sugar/orange juice glaze.  The other 1/2 I made with mini chocolate chips (the kids favorite).  Will make again!  Thanks.

This was a fantastic recipe for scones.  Have made scones before and this has got to be one of the best.  I did add the raisins, but next time will just make them plain and use strawberry jam, or any other fruit spread.  One thing that most scone recipes will say is to score the dough or cut about 1/2 way through - don't.  Made the mistake of doing this and it took about 45 min. and then having to cut them all the way through to finish baking.  Next time I will do as the recipe says and cut them all the way through.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

I leave out the raisins and fold in frozen raspberries and white chocolate chips as my last step before putting it on a lightly floured surface. It's super messy, the batter sticks bad to my hands and kind of difficult (at least for me it is) to knead it and make it one mass and mush it down to cut into 12 pieces...but it ALWAYS turns out great! I usually have to bake them for 20 min but that is probably because they are thicker than they should be. It's just hard to get them to the right thickness/thinness. All in all, the best scone recipe ever!! It's my husband's favorite baked good of mine.   :)

Excellent! I halved the recipe since it was for 2 of us! I beat the egg with 1/2 tsp vanilla and then poured half in the dry mix. I also slightly melted the butter. I thought the dough was a little sticky when I formed in a round but the end result was FANTASTIC! Perfectly moist and yummy! I used dried cranberries for 1/2 the dough and chocolate chips for the other half.

THE BEST SCONE RECIPE EVER!!!  So delicious!  The texture is amazing!  I made mine with lemon zest and dried blueberries...yum yum!  A coat of egg wash made them golden yellow!  I can't wait to make another batch and experiment with an endless possibilities of flavor combinations.

To me, this is more like a tea cake than a scone which would have a bit more of a biscuit texture to it.  I divided the dough in 2 & added cinnamon & vanilla to one portion.  Reminds me of my grandmother's sugar cookies which were incredible.  The other half got some lemon extract & zest & I patted a package of raw sugar into the top before baking.  
The possibilities are endless. Lemon & poppy seed, plain vanilla, chocolate chips, toffee chips or any other chip you have on hand, dried fruit, etc.  
Ended up with 12 wedges of each flavor & these are good sized treats at that.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

I used these to make shortcake for strawberry shortcake and they turned out amazing! I made them vegan for my family and was suprised at how well they hold together and weren't too cake-y.  I used 1 cup of Vegenaise instead of sour cream, and 1/4 cup of apple sauce instead of the egg and followed the directions of the other reviews. Tasted great!

These are ridiculously good!!!  I made them with dried cherries, cranberries and blueberries instead of raisins.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were fabulous!!! I divided the dough into 4 balls instead of one and made mini scones, which were sooo cute!  Also, I made a pomegranate drizzle using 1 cup powdered sugar and 4 tbs pomm juice.

These were great! I followed the recipe exactly except I split the dough into 3 then added chocolate chips to 1/3, cinnamon and nutmeg to 1/3 and dried cherries to the last 1/3. I then cut each 1/3 of dough into 8 scones, which I think was a good size. My husband loved all of the variations.  I think next time I will freeze the butter and grate it in to try to get more of a flaky scone to see which way we like better.

The scones were amazing! They weren't dry or bland like most scones, and the recipe was very simple and quick. I added blueberries and topped with my homemade strawberry jam. They were delicious, but the blueberries made them green.

SO amazing!  This is the best scone I've ever made, and I've tried many recipes and mixes over the years.  They turned out better than my fav coffee chain scones.  So moist and fluffy,  perfect amount of crust, cakey and soft inside, not too sweet or biscuity.  I used the food processor to mix the dry ingredients and cut in the butter, made it quick and easy.  I split my batch into 4 parts, added 1/3 c min choco chips to one, 1/3 c fresh blueberries to another, 1 TB poppy seeds and the zest of a lemon to the third and the final quarter got 1 TB maple  syrup, 2 TB brown sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I divided each quarter into 4, baked half of the scones and froze the other half unbaked for future breakfasts as other reviews recommended.  Seriously, if perfection can be achieved, this recipe is it.

Super duper good. I used dried cherries and blueberries and lightly sprinkled coarse cut sugar over them before baking. Served with lemon curd, mascarpone and devonshire cream on the side and serve them at my brunch. Everyone loved them! Very tasty!

Have done this thrice.  Simply gorgeous. My friends and family said they were "divine" and "super delicious".  I have tried with raisins and mixed dried fruits (the kind you use for fruit cakes) and these came out very tasty.  Gadzillion thanks!!!

I've made these 3 different times, and each time they come out tasting like the flour...even when I added lemon zest and blueberries!  Wish I knew what I was doing wrong - this sounded like a delicious recipe.

These scones melt in your mouth!!  Make sure you take them out when golden on botton, not top.  I mixed craisens with golden raisens.

As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a great scone base.  I added four bananas and chocolate chips to mine.  You really could add anything and I plan to.  The batter was a bit dry (before the bananas) but I attribute that to a fault of my own.  Great recipe to customize!!

These are amazing! I made one batch of pumpkin scones, roughly following the modifications recommended by the user Kingshorses. The second batch was with raisins with only one modification: I boiled the raisins in water with a splash of rum and vanilla extract before adding to the dough. The flavor of the raisins was fantastic!

I love these, they're amazing! I don't care for raisins so I put in craisins (I've also used fresh strawberries, which was good). These actually cut very nicely with cookie cutters if you don't mind them swelling up a bit.

These are delicious!  I didn't have sour cream so I used Greek Yogurt instead...worked like a charm.  I added chocolate chips to half the batch & poppy seeds, lemon juice & frozen raspberries (crushed up) to the other half.  The raspberry ones I glazed with powdered sugar and lemon juice.  So good!

These are SOO good!  I halved the recipe and put it in my scone pan which has 8 wedges, so they were extra thick, but really great texture.  No need to do an egg wash like some have suggested.  The top crunches up by itself.  I substituted blueberry juice infused craisins (much cheaper than dried blueberries) for the raisins, and these scones tasted almost exactly like Panera's blueberry scones!  Delicious!

This is one of two scone recipes I use on a regular basis.  I have tried several variations on this one and it has never failed.  Quick and easy every time.  I sometimes use half sour cream and half orange juice, fabulous.  Sometime I add dried cranberries in place of the raisins.  Adding chocolate chips is a huge treat for the kids (me too!).    My next addition will be lemonaide in place of half the sour cream, and adding icing.  Thanks for this truly great recipe.

If you weren't fan of scones before trying these, you will be now!!! Oh my these are FABULOSO! I split the dough in half and made two circles that I cut with a pizza cutter into 8 slices each. I sprinkled cinnamon & sugar on one batch and stirred dried blueberries into the other batch. Amazing!!!

I have made this a few times now. I now add a tablespoon of extract for flavor, (Almond is my fav, but Vanilla is DH's) plus all kinds of combinations of fruit, nuts and the kid favorite chocolate chips.  It is pretty much fool proof. My family and friends love them. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

So....I know I'm a jerk. I've tried hundred of the recipes on here but have yet to comment on one. But this one I HAD to comment on. This is simply the BEST scone on the planet. Thank you thank you for publishing it. Goodbye Starbucks $2.50 scones...hello better tasting and affordable home baked heaven. Thanks again.

I love, love, love to bake and this has become one of my favorite recipes! I've made them several times with different flavor combinations and everyone, everywhere says these are the best, scone they've ever had.  Many people said they've had scones and never liked them until they tried these.  My family's favorite is mini choc chips.  I've also made orange cranberry, apple cinnamon, smores, and my personal favorite....green tea.  Green tea powder can be purchased at the asian market also add cinnamon and just a pinch of cloves....YUM!  Definitely try this recipe!

Mmm! These are good! My daughter wanted to make scones, but I told her they're dry and crumbly. She insisted, so we tried these.   We added 1 t. vanilla and substituted a scant cup of mini chocolate chips for the raisins, and they were great! We also used light sour cream (Daisy brand, without gums or other added yuck). I recommend you DO soften the butter. I used it cold and cut it in like you do with biscuits, and the dough was too dry to come together at ALL until I had kneaded for a few minutes and the butter in the dough softened up.  To serve to a crowd, separate it into 2-3 rounds and cut each into wedges. The original recipe makes LARGE wedges!

I followed the first reviewer notes and blended in the butter. Next time I will 'cut in' the butter as the recipe states.  This makes for a better scone texture. I will also divide the batter into more scones. They come out rather large for a party setting.  I added dried cranberries. Yummy!

Absolutely fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception that I did not put in the raisins. I just split up the dough into four equal parts and added my own flavorings. I made one part with orange zest and craisins. The second was grated apple, all spice, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon. The third was fresh blueberry and lemon zest. The last was grated carrot and raisin with spices. Way to go grandma Johnson!! 10 stars!

Fabulous!  These were light and moist on the inside and crunchy (without being hard) on the outside.  Texture is key, and these had it.  I was using Sara Moulton's cream scone recipe before, but the outsides of them were a little too hard.  This dough is also very easy to work with.  I followed some of the suggested changes and made a few of my own.  I used 2% plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and mixed that with the egg, 1 GENEROUS teaspoon vanilla, and the baking soda.  I baked it on parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheet.  I used dried tart cherries, instead of raisins and sprinkled the tops with demerara sugar before baking.    It did take about 32 minutes to bake so that the tops were golden brown, as well as the bottoms.

A great recipe! My favorite way to make them is with craisins which I soak in very hot water to plump them up, then after they bake I brush them with a glaze made with powdered sugar and orange juice.

I had never eaten a scone so did not know what to expect.  I may cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup next time as they were very sweet.  Also you do need to bake them longer because mine were a little doughy in the middle.  I probably would make them smaller and have a few more.  Will make again.
Update: I cut down on the sugar and baked longer - THEY WERE AT HIT!

With the exception of reducing the sugar to 3/4 cup, I followed the general recipe for this one, but I can't help myself, when it comes to additions. I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp of allspice and ground cloves along with a healthy dose of orange zest. I also folded 1 tsp vanilla into the sour cream/baking soda mix. Okay, maybe I didn't actually follow the recipe, but the end result was a warm, dense biscuit type of scone with just enough sweetness to make me happy. Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing!  Almost like a sugar cookie in scone form, they're so rich and moist.  Adding dried cherries, almond extract, and sliced almonds is my favorite.

My husband considers himself a scone expert and he raved about these. ** Note: In high altitude, you will need to bake about 20 minutes.

I made to the recipe, never having made scones before, wasn't sure what to expect. Once I got it pulled together to knead it worked out fine. I only cut 8 slices, should have done smaller ones, they really raise up and out in the pan. Took a little longer to cook for that reason. Good flavor and texture, I think they would make great shortcakes. Pretty yummy overall, next I will try some with choc chips or other fruits. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was the first time I ever made scones and they were awesome. I didn't have raisens, so I substituted dried cranberries. After cooling, I added a glaze of powdered sugar and lemon juice. Yummy.

I found the mix dry and hard to work with. I was surprised the finished product was as good as it was. I had to bake them for 20 minutes. The ones I did at 15 were much too soft.

I just made these and they are wonderful!  I can tell I will have to make another batch.  These were slightly crisp on the outside and light and wonderful on the inside.  I used cranberries instead of raisins and added some orange flavoring, and I did not even bother to make the glaze.  My husband who has always said that he doesn't like scones says these are delicious!  I am planning on making the next batch with lemon flavoring and some frozen blueberries.  Thanks for the recipe.

WOW! Didn't have enough sour cream so substituted 1/3 cup buttermilk to make up the difference. Used currants instead of raisins and before baking, brushed with butter and sprinkled raw sugar on top for a little crunch. I patted this into 2 rounds instead of one, cut each into eights to make 16 instead of 8 scones. Delicious! Can't wait to try with dried cranberries!

I love chocolate chip scones!  I used to pay big bucks for them at a local bakery - now I make my own.  I do add a little more sour cream to mine because I prefer my scones to be more moist.

I followed this recipe to a T, but I split the dough at the end and added about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips to one half and a cup of craisins and a tsp of orange extract to the other. I wanted to make smaller scones, so I separated each "flavor" into two rounds and cut them each in 8 pieces with a pizza cutter. They are a little bland, but in terms of scones (which I believe aren't really supposed to be that sweet) they are delicious. With tea or milk or anything they are the perfect breakfast snack. I baked them for 11 minutes and they were slightly golden brown on the bottom. I could've baked them a bit longer to give them more of that "harder" scone texture, but at 11 minutes they had a nice crust and are light and doughy.

all in all a success. I think I would consider adding a bit of vanilla next time, or some other kind of flavoring. Maybe sprinkling them with a bit of sugar to sweeten them up. I might make a simple powdered sugar glaze and drizzle it on top. They look and smell delicious!

Everyone absolutely loved them and raved about them. They said they were the best scones they'd ever tasted!

The best scone recipe ever!

However, there is always room for improvement.

To make this a vegetarian recipe replace the egg with 2 tsp ener-g egg replacer.

To make this a lower calorie recipe:

1.) substitute half the sugar with Splenda

2.) use fat-free sour cream

3.) reduce butter to 3/4 cup

4.) *use Ener-G Egg Replacer (also makes this a vegetarian-friendly recipe)

WOW!  I never thought I could make scones - much less ones that were great!  Cutting in butter and rolling dough always intimidates me for some reason.  The key is cutting in the butter - your goal is to incorporate it in to the flour until it becomes little pea sized butter and flour balls (google cutting in butter for tips on how to do it).

This is what makes these flaky (same with pie crust) - the little balls of butter eventually kind of pop when they cook and give the flaking effect.

If making the recipe as it is, I would divide in to 2 balls of dough and then cut in to 12 pieces each.  You'll need 2 cookie sheets.  I made one ball and had huge scones and they needed an extra 2 - 3 minutes of cooking due to being a little too thick, so I think the 2 balls would take care of it.

I added dried cranberries and a dash of vanilla and cut back just a tiny bit on the sugar.  They were incredible!  Very substantial.  For the cost of one scone from Starbucks - you can make a batch of nearly 2 dozen, and they're better.

I really appreciate this recipe - I can't wait to try other variations.  Thank you Grandma Johnson!

My only scone recipe from now on.  I make one batch and add chocolate chips to one half and raisins to the other.  We usually freeze half of these (unbaked) and then bake the remainder as needed (about 35 minutes when frozen).  The best scone recipe I have come across.

These are the best...I have made about 10 batches since the holidays.  I like variety so I separated the dough into two halves and made 2 different types from one batch.  Variations I've tried... Lemon Poppy Seed: add 3-4 tsp Poppy Seeds and 1 generous tsp Lemon Zest.  I glazed them when still warm (1 cup Powder sugar, 1 TBSP Light Corn Syrup and juice from 1/2 of a lemon.)  Raspberry White Chocolate:  Add 1 cup of fresh or frozen Raspberries.  Bake, cool, then drizzle with melted White Chocolate chips mixed with oil (ratio: 3 oz chips to 1 tsp oil).  Cranberry Walnut:  Add 1 cup dried cranberries and 1 cup chopped walnuts.  Blueberry:  1 cup blueberries with clear sugar sprinkles on top. Plain or adding 1 cup of Currents are great, too! I made one large rectangle and cut 12 squares then cut them in 1/2 for 24 small triangles so people could sample more than one.  Served with lemon curd and clotted cream.

After 786 mostly rave reviews, there's not much more I can add that hasn't already been said.  These scones are FAB!  The dough is a little dry, but it's supposed to be... that's the nature of a scone dough (as opposed to biscuit dough, which is very wet).  Make sure your butter is ice cold when you cut it into the flour mixture - those hard little nubs of butter are what make the finished product light and airy.  I can't say enough about the recipe - it's pretty perfect as is.

It really works.  They are so fluffy inside.  Just the right amount of sweetness, as well.  The dough is deceptively sticky, so try just coating it with flour on both sides for easier cutting and transport. I wouldn't change a thing. (Soy milk, reduced-fat sour cream and light margarine worked for me, by the way).

Seriously.  Whoever says these are a lot of work is yanking your chain -- these take NO time at all to whip together.  Still good days later, but definitely the best the day of -- and don't close them in an air-tight container if you're serving them that day.  I have been told by SERIOUS scone fans (at my husband's place of employment) that these are the best scones they have ever eaten anywhere, bar none.  I use low-fat sour cream with no problem and always either just make a half recipe, cutting that quantity into 10 wedges, or make the whole quantity but divide it in half so that I can have two yummy flavor options instead of one.  My hands-down favorite is definitely white chocolate chips (lots of them!) with craisins; currently in 2nd place is milk chocolate chips and toffee bits with cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top before baking.  These are SO easy to make and totally addictive.  (Obviously, you have to use real, unsalted butter -- not some fake-o stuff :-) . . . if you go the fake margarine route, your possible lousy results will be your own silly fault!!)  Oops -- almost forgot -- I add 1 tsp. vanilla as well...

I read what others wrote and some said these are bland and some said they are amazing.  These scones are really amazing but only if they have things added to them.  Otherwise they taste like a buiscut.  I cut up the butter and put in my Kitchen Aid with the bread hook and then kneaded on the counter like someone else suggested.  This made it so easy.  I added orange peel and craisins to the scones.  I topped with an orange glaze (1/4 c. orange juice concentrate, 2 T. butter melted together, then add 1/2 t. vanilla, 1/2 t. almond extract, and 1 1/2c. powdered suger).  Then these really tasted like the yummy scones you get at the bakery.  My family couldn't get enough.

May 2007:.....
I served these at my daughter's bridal shower tea...for 45 guests and not one was left! Everyone wanted this recipe! I did make them half the size and they were still plenty big enough! Yummy with clotted cream and plum preserves! ..........................................,,,,,,,
Update Dec 2015.  By now I've made this recipe at least 100 times!  I have started substituting 1 cup of plain Greek Yogurt and have found no difference in the taste or texture.  Though I still can't say it's a low-fat treat, every little bit helps.
I love that it's easy to change up the flavors.  In the winter, I use cinnamon chips and a brown sugar cinnamon glaze.  In the summer, dried infused cranberries and orange zest with orange extract, or lemon poppy seed are often requested favorites.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

I kind of feel like what's the point of writing this review -  You should just trust the other 600 reviews on here! I agree!  These scones are delish.  I made a bunch to sell at a bakesale and made 4 batches - all different flavors. Cranberry orange, cinnamon raisin, chocolate chip and cheddar bacon. These scones rise and spread more than you think so plan accordingly when you first place them on your baking sheet. I hate it when scones have an overdone bottom and the middle can still be doughy. So to prevent this I raised the oven rack a bit, and I doubled the cookie sheets on which they were baked. They baked very evenly. The texture was cakey like but not totally unscone like. A sprinkling of course sugar on top before baking added a nice touch and a little extra crunchiness. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

These are truly wonderful! This recipe was my first attempt at making scones. I used it to make Christmas gifts for friends and neighbors. I ended up making a total of 108 scones and every last one turned out perfect! I added bittersweet chocolate chips and dried cherries and put 6 scones (they are very generously sized) on a Christmas plate with hot chocolate mix and wrapped it all up in celephane. They were beautiful gifts, not very expensive, and every single person asked me for the recipe. I can't wait to try some different variations this Spring (blueberries, plain w/ lemon curd, etc). Two recommendations; knead as little as possible to keep light and flakey, if your mixture is too dry, add a bit more sour cream.

OMG...these are INCREDIBLE!  I have been meaning to make these for at least a year now and finally made them yesterday morning.  I read several reviews before hand and although I don't feel this recipe needs ANY improvement, I did make a few changes.  The recipe yields 12, but 12 of these scones based on all ingredients as written would give you VERY LARGE scones (not a bad thing, lol).  I ended up getting 24, not too big and not too small.  I used 1 1/2 c. ww flour and 2 1/2 c. unbleached white, low fat sour cream (that's all I buy), 3/4 c butter (room temp) and cut the sugar down to closer to 1/2 c.  I did find too that they required longer baking time (closer to 20 mins).  Even with these changes, they were fabulous and I did find them sweet enough using only 1/2 c sugar.  I made them all with raisins and am very anxious to try them again probably splitting the dough into thirds, maybe some with blueberries, some with cranberry/almond/lemon and the other with maybe a chocolate combo, YUMMY, the options are endless!!  This recipe will be a staple, my 4 1/2 year old and 2 1/2 year old loved them and I had to get them in the freezer so hubby and I didn't eat them all!  Thanks so much for the fantastic recipe!

Very good! I have made these 3 times. I shape dough into circle then cut triangles. I then press each triangle out so I can put frozen blueberries in the middle and fold over to nestle them inside. press the edges together gently. After they bake it is a grand surprise when you bite into them!  Oh yeah, Sprinkle cinnamon sugar before baking. Yummo!  Very addicting!

I'm always a little wary when reviews for a recipe are so gushy, but in this case, I have to gush right along with everyone else. This recipe is hands down the best scone recipe I have ever tried. The scones are DIVINE--they taste amazing and the texture is just scone-perfect. Bravo, Grandma Johnson!

This was also my first try at making scones.  I took one of the suggestions and reduced the sugar by half and added grated extra sharp cheddar cheese (maybe a cup)...they turned out fantastic!  I'll keep this as a basic recipe and play with different versions.

I made these tonight with cranberries, white chocolate chips and added a little orange juice because they needed a bit more moisture. I also took the advice of others and cut the sugar down to 1/2 a cup and they were just sweet enough for us. If you're expecting traditional English scones, (which I must admit I prefer) you're going to be disappointed because the texture and the flavour is all wrong but ultimately this is a very good recipe for American type scones and for what they were they tasted great.

This recipe is awesome! The scones came out slightly crunchy on the outside and deliciously soft on the inside! Sour cream really adds something special to cakes and other breads! I made only some minor changes: I omitted the raisins, used Splenda instead of sugar, and used light sour cream. This recipe is also amazingly fast; from mixing bowl to cooling rack takes only 30 minutes!  Keep this one in your recipe box!

My mom and sister loved these. I used about 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and my sister said they were good enough to go in our bakery! My mom made me give them away, because she was worried she'd eat them all.

These scones were AMAZING!! I made cinnamon chip scones by using a tip from a previous review and adding 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 cup cinnamon chips, and cinnamon sugar on top. My only suggestion would be to press the dough into a square shape and cut them into bars rather than wedges because mine came out very large. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Grated frozen butter and added craisins to the dry ingredients. Divided into 3 rounds, scored, sprinkled with turbinado sugar and baked. Came out very tender. Best scones I have ever had.

These were so tasty. My boyfriend and I ate the entire batch. I made lemon, chocolate chip and cheese. I thought the lemon were the best. I iced them with lemon juice mixed with powdered sugar. I only used half the amount of sugar and thought they were plenty sweet. Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this recipe!  I split the dough in half and used chocolate chips in one half and cranberries in the other.  The cranberry one turned out very well, I wouldn't recommend chocolate chips however as they were very bland.

Wow.  Couldn't get better scones in any coffee house!  So easy to make and so delicious.  MUCH cheaper than buying them!!  I split the dough into three sections, made one with chocolate shavings, one with cinnamon and one with blueberries.  All three turned out delicious!  I cut the butter in half and they were so moist and not overly crumbly.  I had to bake them an extra 10 minutes, I like them with a slightly crunchy outside.  I used bread flour instead of all purpose.  What a wonderful scone recipe!!  Oh and I didn't roll them out.  I just took handfuls of dough, mixed in each topping (chocolate, cinnamon, or blueberry) by hand, shaped into a triangle and placed them on a baking sheet.  Will be making these many many times to come!

I made these scones with cranberries and white chocolate chips as suggested by other reviewers.  INCREDIBLE!  Everyone loved them!  Not too crumbly or dry, and ohhh sooo good!  I'll definately be trying some other flavor combinations too! UPDATE: Use bread flour instead of regular AP and they turn out so nice and fluffy!  Try it!

These were delicious!  I gave them as gifts with a jar of organic jam and people loved it.  They taste like big, sweet flaky biscuits - so they also taste great with honey!  In the days after I made them I put them in the microwave for 10-15 sec to warm them up before eating.  Also, I stored them in a paper bag so they wouldn't get soft.  UPDATE:  on my second try I used 3/4 c of sugar and they were still nicely sweet.  I also split the dough in half and left half plain and the other half with 1/2 c semi sweet chocolate chips.  Since Starbucks doesn't carry their chocolate chunk scones anymore these will more than do!!  Also, I ran out of cream of tartar but they still tasted good, just didn't rise as much - don't know if that was a coincidence or not.

These are absolutely the best!  I think I love Grandma Johnson!  For some reason, mixing the sour cream and the baking soda really changes the texture of these scones...lightens the texture so they're not heavy like other scones.  To make these a festive holiday treat, I add dried cranberries and white chocolate chips to mine and sprinkle them with coarse sanding sugar for some sparkle!

These scones are absolutely incredible. It is a fantastic foundation recipe. I have used this recipe and altered it to obtain many different flavors. The family favorite: Orange glazed scones. To the dough I add about a tablespoon of orange rind and 2 tsp of orange extract. As soon as the scones come out of the oven, I pour over the orange glaze. To make the glaze I whisk together 2 c. 10x sugar, 4 Tbls. OJ, 2 tsp orange rind, and 1-2 tsp of orange extract. Enjoy!

Gosh, I must be terribly picky.  I was disappointed with these scones.  They were too cake-like for my taste.  A scone with less sugar would be better if you plan to use jam or clotted cream with them.

I don't know what some of the others did to have dry, crumbly scones, but mine weren't.  I had trouble trying to knead the dough because it was so moist.(maybe to much kneading is why they had crumbly scones)  Making different varieties with blueberries, cranberries, poppyseed etc. made these extra special.  Will make again.

Oh, Rob!  I feel guilty that I've been so busy making & devouring these scones that I haven't taken the time to thank you for the PERFECT recipe.  It's excellent as-is, but it's also fun to think up new add-ins!  My very favorite is to add cinnamon chips and chopped apple bits and, when scones cool, drizzle with confectioner's sugar glaze.  Thank you for generously sharing a really special recipe.

Although the texture was not like any scone I have ever had these are very good.  I used one cup of cinnamom chips in place of the raisins.  When it says to place them 2 inches apart that's no joke they turn out huge.  It was a great breakfast treat.

This is the closet I have come to LaBou scones.  Outside semihard and inside soft and moist.  I followed the recipe and added a mixture of 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 tsp. cinnamon and a little lemon zest to the mix at the end, was a little trying should have added to flour mix but decided to do it late.  The one bit of advise.  Keep mixing do not give up.  It took a little more then I thought but it did come together. It is very easy and AWESOME next I will try Marionberrys.  This one is a KEEPER!

These are pretty good. But more cake or cookie like than a regular scone. They had a great flavor and were easy to make. I think that I will look for a more traditional recipe though.

Gee, this scone was too average. The dough was really sticky and a pain which is fine if the final product is awesome. One taster thought they tasted like corn bread! They weren't bad, just not very good. Oh well.=)

This is a terrific scone.  I've made it both plain and with fresh blueberries.  As long as you don't overwork the dough, these come out perfectly. Several people have said that these are better than any scones they've tried before. Yummy!

I never made scones before and I thought there must be a mistake..the dough is hardly put together. But lo and behold, it came out absolutely delicious. Even my picky 5 yr old ate half of one, and that means it's pretty darn good!

WOW.  These scones are most excellent.  I am not a fan of dry, crumbly scones, so these moist and light delights hit the spot!  I used brown sugar instead of white, added dried cherries, brushed with milk and sprinkled on sugar before baking and had to bake for closer to 20 minutes, but they are WORTH it!  Thanks for the great recipe!  Shayesmom

This was delicious!  I'd never made scones before, and my family adored them!  I had to bake them for 20 minutes, though.  I'll definitely make them again.  Thanks for the recipe!

The absolute best scone recipe! I added orange zest to the dough. Also dried cranberries and pistachios. Made an orange glaze for top. Do not let butter come to room temp! Instead cut butter into small pieces and work in with fingers. Bringing butter to room temp and mixing in will not give the proper texture to the scone. You want it to be more like a biscuit than a muffin! Handle the dough as little and as gently as possible for best results!

Really good base.  I think you can do anything from here.  We added blueberries and made a nice tart lemon icing.  Also did one set with fresh cranberries and a little orange.

Fantastic, easy to make recipe! I've used it about 10 times and used different things each time including: chocolate chips, white chocolate chips/apricot, sliced almonds/cranberries, sliced almonds/blueberries.. So many options! They're always gone in about a day.

I made this according to recipe except that I only had 2/3 c of sour cream so I used 1/3 c of vanilla yogurt to make up the difference. I was surprised to find that it worked great. I used white chocolate pieces in lieu of raisins or berries and iced with a lemon juice and powdered sugar glaze. Delish! This will be my go to scone recipe. Great with mock Devonshire cream too.

Absolutely the best scone recipe I've ever made (or eaten).  I love trying different add-ins each time.  So far lemon/poppyseed is my favorite, but I also love them with dried cherries, blueberries, raisins, apricots (cut into small pieces), and fruit mixtures that I find at Trader Joe's.  I find that I have better luck with dried fruit compared to fresh.  I enjoy making them with my little granddaughter because she loves to help me cut them out.  All my friends and neighbors are thrilled when I bring over a batch -- along with clotted cream, of course!!!  I highly recommend trying this recipe.  It really is the best ever!

Rolled into balls and flattened.  Made about 16 (instead of 12).  Took longer to cook, 18 minutes.

These were perfect!  I prepared a traditional English afternoon tea menu for my by British  mother-in-law and included these scones served with thick cream (Devonshire) and homemade strawberry preserves.  She absolutely loved them and commented that they were probably the best she has ever had.  They have a wonderful texture, slightly moister than regular tea biscuits due to the sour cream, but still dry enough that the addition of the cream and jam makes them perfectly delicious.  I will be using this recipe again and again!

Very good, but more of a cake than a true English scone, which is eaten at tea with butter/cream and jam, but pretty good nevertheless, and definitely as good as any scone I have ever had in an American bakery.   Next time I think I will try cutting down the suger by about 1/4 cup especially if adding the raisins.  Seems like the recipe should make many more than 12 servings.  I made 16 very large scones.  Next time I think I will make into 2 rounds and make into smaller wedges for more servings.

I just tried this recipe and it turned out to be one flaky mess.  I couldn't get the dough to stick together.  ANyone else have this problem.  I followed the recipe exactly….even watched the video to make sure I did it correctly.  Any advice?  They tasted fine but won't stay together.

I replaced the currants with blackberries for a morning business meeting. I did not have any cream of tartar so I left it and the baking soda out and added 1 tsp of baking powder in its place. They rose nice and high and my peers said they were moist and the best they'd ever had. They were a huge hit.  I will definitely bake them again.

We owned and operated a small drive through coffee shop  for six years and used this scone recipe as the base for several variations and they were great.  Variations we made were cheddar bacon, apple cinnamon, lemon ginger and cranberry orange.  Using a food processor to mix and dry ingredients and to blend in the butter (cut into small chunks first) really helped cut the time needed.

I did not change a thing with this recipe and I was amazed at how perfect these came out!  The BEST moist, tender, flaky scones with just the right sweetness.  I added golden raisins.  This is a lot of dough, so it could make a lot more than 12 scones.  This is definitely the best tasting homemade scone I have ever eaten.  Sure to be a hit as gifts or at a brunch buffet.  They are so buttery good I didn't even need to slather on additional butter.  Thank you Rob for Grandma Johnson's scones.  Wow.  BTW I followed the recipe exactly; mixed the sour cream with the baking soda and set aside.  It began to rise while I mixed the dry ingredients.  I used cold butter and cubed it into the flour mixture and cut it in with my pastry cutter.  Then added the sour cream mix and stirred in a slightly beaten egg just so the whites and yolk would mix in.  Baked it in a 350 preheated electric oven for 15 min exactly. I don't see any reason to alter this recipe one bit.  No need to cream the butter with the sugar (as another reviewer suggested) as I think that would alter the makeup of the dough.  You want the marbling of the butter throughout.  Perfect as is!  If I could give this 10 stars I would!!!

I made these last Sunday and they were fantastic! Very moist, delicious and flavorful. This was the very first time that I have ever made scones and so I was delighted to find an excellent recipe. My husband liked them very much and he said that they were better than Starbucks'. Thank you for the recipe.

Fantastic scones. Great texture. The only thing that makes them better is to leave out the egg and use it as a wash on the tops of the scones before baking. Beat egg and brush the tops of the scones. Sprinkle with sugar before baking. This helps them to brown nicely. Make sure the butter is cold and don't over mix. The chunks of butter make the scones tender. I also use parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheet. I prefer a half and half mixture of sour cream and buttermilk, but all sour cream is still very good.

Just made these exactly as written and served them at a "High Tea" today to 63 very opinionated woman and they were a HUGE success.  Everyone told me these were the BEST scones they ever tasted - and not dry as they usually are.  This was the first time I ever tasted a scone and I'd have to agree.  Thanks for making our tea such a hit with the ladies.

These scones were delicious! I did take the advice from another review and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the egg.  I used blueberries instead of rasins (personal preference).  Instead of flattening the dough and cutting wedges, I just spooned the dough onto a lightly greased cookies sheet.  I did have to adjust the time.  I baked for about 18 minutes (timing depends on the amount of dough/size of scone).

This is by far my favorite scone recipe. Every time I make them, I am asked for the recipe. I love adding cranberry, orange zest and pecans. Blue berries work as well!

Just made these and love them! I'm eating my 2nd one now! I halved the recipe and cut them into 8 pieces with my pizza cutter. They turned out nice and puffy with just the right amt. of sweetness. Easy recipe that you can throw together most any morning you want something different and yummy! (great with blackberry jelly!)

All I can say is YUM!! I have never made scones before so I looked over some recipes and thought I would try this one.
So glad I did, because they were easy and really good. I made the full batch and I used the advice from another review and added vanilla. Then I split it in half and made chocolate chip and orange cranberry. They are really good. 
So give them a try you won't be sorry!

very delicious scone... a nice simple basic recipe that is quick and easy to make... you can add different fruits and spices to your liking but this is a good start very very tasty.... mine took longer than 15 minutes to turn brown just watch them closely and adjust cooking time for your oven... thanks for the simple delicious recipe

Yummy and buttery!  I didn't have cream of tartar, but they came out just fine without.  I used golden raisens because that is all I had.  I wish I had cranberries, that would be perfect!  The only problem I have with it is that I think that cutting into 12 portions makes scones that are way to big.  I am used to smaller scones so I almost doubled the amount by cutting smaller.

Wow!  They were crumbly and so I thought they would be dry, but they were delicious!  The kids devoured them when they got home from school (fresh out of the oven!). I used reconstituted dried blueberries and they were the perfect flavor for these scones. (put dried wild Maine blueberries in saucepan covered with water, bring to a boil, turn off flame, cover, and let sit while you make the pastry)

Love this recipe.  It's not nearly as dry as scones normally are. Excellent with cinnamon chips and a dusting of cinnamon sugar on the top.

I just made this recipe today for the first time when I had a neighbor over for tea.  It was very good!  The only thing I would say is that 12 scones out of this recipe makes for very large scones.  It would probably be better if you made the 12 large scones into 24 small scones instead.  However, they were not too dry, but moist and tasty and perfect with tea.

My 2 small children the the sconees from Starbucks. So I thought I would give this a shot. I just made them. Once I added the wet and dry ingredients it never really formed into a ball. It was so sticky I could not get it off my hands while trying to knead  together. But i still tried to form them as much as I could on the baking sheet. they turned out ok. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla. When they came out of the oven I tried one and it does seem like it is still missing a flavor. I have some inthe oven now that has the tiny chocolate morsels. hope that adds a little flavor. I wil lmake again and maybe make a few adjustments. If anyone has any suggestions on my sticky mixture would love to hear from u. Thanks.

Fantastic.  I made these scones EXACTLY as the recipe calls for and they were perfect.  just as yummy the next day.  I doubled the recipe because I needed a lot of scones and divided the dough into three different flavors, cinnamon nutmeg, cranberry orange and lemon with a lemon glaze.  I just divided the dough into three bowls and in place of adding the raisens I added the drided cranberries and orange zest, cinnamon and nutmeg and lemon zest. Lemon glaze was drizzled on and I made that from some fresh lemon juice, powdered sugar and a bit of milk.

The other reviews say it all - these scones are amazing!  I was really nervous when I saw the batter- extremely sticky and hard to handle.  Got even more nervous when I had to coat with a lot of flour while kneading to get it to hold it's shape and not stick.  BUT, after I finally got it cut into wedges and started baking, they turned out magnificantly!  I added cranberries instead of raisins, also a little vanilla and cinnamon (1 tsp each).  Will probably add even more next time for more flavor, but they still had perfect density, fluffiness, shape, and texture- just like a bakery!

Wow, I misread the directions and used only 1 stick of butter instead of two.  And they STILL turned out fantastic!  This might be a good tip for anyone who wants a healthier version of this recipe.

these are honestly the best scones I've ever tasted! Rich and buttery (much like a fluffy shortbread), add whatever flavors you like (I added dried cranberries and orange peel). So versatile and easy!

I have made these several times for special events and when vacationing with friends.  If I made them for myself at home, I would eat them all!  They are delicious and my friends all love them.  I do prefer to make them into 2 rounds and cut them each into 6 large scones.  Don't be surprised if the mixture is very dry and crumbly when mixing in the sour cream and egg.  I end up mixing it with my hands to get it all into a ball or 2 rounds.  I press sanding sugar into each scone before baking.  For a bridal shower, I used a heart shaped cookie cutter to shape each scone into a heart.  I usually add dried cranberries to the dough and serve with the Easy Devonshire Cream recipe.

Wow these were wonderful! I took someone else's tip and added 1 tsp of vanilla. I used Craisins instead of raisins (just personal preference) and they came out great! Mine took a bit longer than 15 minutes (maybe 20-25), but they were worth the wait. This is now my go-to recipe for scones!

Simply the BEST scone recipe out there (that I've tried so far).  They turn out every time and I'm able to make whatever flavor I like.  I divide the dough in two parts and make two different kinds.  I then freeze half of each for another day and bake the other half.  I use natural white - unbleached flour, spelt, flax and a bit of buckwheat flour to make for a healthier whole grain blend.  They taste delicious and not too healthy.  If you're looking for a good recipe - look no further!  This one will be a family favorite for years to come.

these came out pretty good; my siblings rly liked them. unfortunately, i think i did not put enough flour because when i kneaded the dough, it was rly sticky and hard to put in one loaf. therefore they came out a little dry... because i kept on putting flour so it wasnt so sticky. overall, they were very good, but next time i need to keep an eye on my measurements!!

AHHHHHMAZING. I made these for a fundraiser and i had to make a second batch because i ate most of the first. I added cheddar, bacon, and chives to one batch, then i added lemon juice, lemon zest and poppy seeds to another batch. my only advice if you are putting alot of extras that don't have much liquid, add a little extra milk. The dough gets really dry. I had this problem with the cheddar bacon chive ones. I will definitely be making these in the future!

I'm a sucker for anything with sour cream in it, so I was excited to try this recipe. Instead of raisins I used diced apple which I browned in butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar and toffee bits. I also substituted half the sugar for brown sugar and added some vanilla and pumpkin pie spice mix (nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, etc). I put in the first batch and realized they were going to be huge, so I cut the second half smaller and managed to get 20 scones in all. Delicious! Even before I added my 'toppings' I was tempted to eat the plain mix.

These are excellent scones.  I split the dough in half and add 1 tsp orange zest and 1/2 cup dried cranberries to one half and 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the other half.  I pat each half into a 3/4 thick disk and cut each disk into 12 wedges (for smaller portions).  I don't know if I'll find a better scone recipe but I know that this one will be a definite "go to" over and over.

This recipe is exceptional!!! The crumb:the softness is perfect! I used 3/4 cup "light" sour cream, cut the sugar to a bit less than 3/4 cups (still pretty sweet), only 3/4 cup of butter, 1/4 cup of orange juice (actually I used homemade orange liquor) and 2 Tbsp of homemade mascarpone as I wanted to use it up! Made 2 rounds then divided each into 12 pcs, will try making a large rectangle then devide into triangles. Made 1/2 with walnuts and 1/2 plain, both were awesome!

This is my go to scone recipe.  I've make it frequently, and have used yogurt instead of sour cream and/or butter flavored shortening in place of the butter (I just cut the shortening in and then put the bowl in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes before continuing).  Glaze with a simple vanilla glaze - awesome! :)

Turned out great!!  I split the batch into chocolate chip and almond poppyseed.   We liked the poppy seed the best.   We also liked the smaller scones, which is making 2 smaller circles for each flavor and cutting 8 wedges from there.   I also added 1tsp vanilla as others have done when mixing the butter and sugar.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these the other day to take to a play date.  It was my first try at making scones and they turned out great. The moms and kids couldn't stop eating them.  I did half the batch chocolate chips and half cranberry orange.  I am excited to try other version and know they will become a regular around our house. Thanks for sharing.

Super easy and yummy.  I divided the dough in half and added dried cranberries and orange zest to one half and chocolate chips to the other.  The ones with orange peel, I made a glaze with powdered sugar, orange juice and a bit of zest.  All this for the royal wedding between William and Kate....super yum!

So good!  I replaced the sugar with 1 cup of maple syrup, added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg, and reduced the sour cream to 1/2 cup (to make up for the extra moisture from the syrup).  So easy and so delicious.  I didn't need any butter, jam, or any other toppings, they were amazing on their own.  I will definitely be making these again.

So many reviews, but I'll add mine - This was great, just like everyone said!  So Grandma Johnson must of known her scones!   My daughter and I made these for her 4H International night with the mock Devonshire cream (recipe also on Allrecipes), and we used chocolate chips instead of raisins, as we weren't sure how many people would like the raisins, and since we don't like them much in our family, we didn't want to be stuck with leftovers that we wouldn't eat.   These went over quite well at the 4H international night (everyone had to research a country, and make a dish from that that country).  I don't know if I'd make this again, as I don't know of too many events where I'd use these, and they were rich with the cream... but yummy just the same!

Really good, don't over handle the dough.  Made mine with chopped fresh strawberries, chopped basil and minced fruit leather.  DELICIOUS!  If you are making savory ones be sure to cut back on the sugar.

This is a great scone recipe, the best one so far. The only thing I would change next time is adding more sugar (1 1/2 cups). It just wasn't sweet enough. I'm usually the first one to cut the sugar down in a recipe. After reading reviews I decided to stick with 1 cup of sugar. Everything else I followed, except I added 1 teas of vanilla suggested by reviewers. I split the dough into 3 batches. First I made lemon scones- 1 1/2 teas lemon juice and 1 whole lemon rinds. I wanted it lemon-y. I added flour on my hands as I shape them, the lemon juice made it sticky. I rolled it into a ball, flattened it and cut 2 edges off like a mini scone, pizza shaped. Again I wish I would have added more sugar, esp if you are going to make lemon scones. Second batch- I added chopped pecans, raisins, cinnamon and nutmeg. Third batch- I added white and dark chocolate chips, about 1/4 cups combined. The toppings are endless. Next time I will try different flavor jams. Thanks for sharing.

I have used this recipe for a bridal shower tea and got rave reviews. I plan on using it again for another tea. The Perfect Lemon Curd recipe on this site is delicious with these scones. It's a versatile recipe and you can't miss with it.

A wonderful basic recipe with so many possible variations. Add your raisins, cranberries, etc to the flour  before adding the sour cream mixture. I actually cut my dough in half and rolled each  separately.  Used a pizza cutter to cut the wedges.  An easy recipe to follow, but do not overbake.  Thanks for the recipe, Rob!!

These turned out quite good, though I used Splenda for the sweetener.  The dough was quite dry and shaggy, but it did manage to come together to allow cutting out.  They didn't rise too high at all--maybe because of the Splenda??  Will make again and try using sugar to see if that makes a difference.

Awesome! Made them with chocolate chips. Can't wait to try them with blueberries. The recipe makes a lot of them, so I froze half of them (unbaked). They still tasted awesome out of the freezer.

Despite the four or five times I thought this recipe was a goner, it turned out great! Make sure to use a REALLY large baking sheet to give the called for 2 inches of space in between. Then be sure to let them cool a bit to set before eating. And boy are they good! I used carob chips instead of raisins and switched out the flour for a mix of white rice, brown rice and oat flours along with 4 tsp of arrowroot powder. Incredible.

This was exceptional!  I used mini semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of raisins.  Next time I would shape the dough into TWO 3/4 inch thick rounds so the wedges would be shorter/smaller.  Thanks for this recipe!

Oh. My. Goodness.  AMAZING.  I added about 3/4 cup blueberries to the dough.  Instead of 1 cup sour cream, I did 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt and 1/2 cup sour cream with 2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice and about 1/2 tsp lemon zest. I also used butter with salt, so I didn't use all the amount called for.  I made a lemon glaze to go on top. These scones were simply delicious.  A true 5 star recipe!!!!!

Sorry, but these were nothing like scones to me and I followed this recipe exactly. It did not work for us at all. The texture while mixing was so dry I thought they would be inedible because of that. Imagine my surprise when I dug into them and they were very, very dense and almost gummy, after baking for almost 45 minutes!  On the inside, mine looked nothing like the picture on this recipe. I will not be making these again, they're going to the birds! I'll return to my tried and true scone recipe that always works and makes wonderful scones. Should have stuck with that, but the rave reviews here made me excited to try them. Sad I wasted all those ingredients!

I've never made scones before because I've tried them in coffee shops & NEVER enjoyed them.  I thought they were suppose to be hard & dry...until I made these.  I made them for my son's tea party at school and, OMG, couldn't stop eating them!  They were not at all hard or dry.  I left out the raisins and drizzled a glaze on the top.  PERFECT!

I had never made scones before until I tried these, and I was amazed at how easy they were and how moist they turned out!  I did follow some other reviewer's suggestions and added vanilla and chocolate chips (no raisins) - I also added some cinnamon and put a light glaze on them when they came out of the oven.  Delicious!

These are so moist and good!  My Hubby brought home some fresh blackberries and requested scones.  So I froze the berries over night and used them instead of raisins.  I also used 3/4 cup of sugar, which made them plenty sweet.  They turned out perfect and so delicious!  :)

Didn't have cream of tartar and it still turned out great. I took the advice of putting sugar and cinnamon on top with melted butter before baking.

I don't mean to be rude, but I think that those that have reviewed these as boring or nothing to write home about, don't understand that this is a BASE recipe.  I make them with lemon zest and poppyseed, or craisins and orange zest.  They are to die for!  Surely much better than Starbucks or the fair.

OH MY GOODNESS. Words can't say good these are. My only suggestion would be to reduce the size of the scones. Otherwise they are very large. I kneeded in fresh cranberries and made an orange glaze for the top. YUMMY

I tried another recipe on this site and they turned out not so hot. All I tasted was the baking powder. This recipe was much better! My family gobbled them up. I did follow the suggestions from one of the reviews. I also used butter flavored crisco because I was out of butter (die hard butter fan, but just didn't have any) any way crisco worked, though I imagine butter would have tasted much better, but in a pinch this worked nicely.

These turned out golden brown and delicious!  I left out the raisins and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of almond extract to the wet ingredients, another 1/2 cup of sugar to the dry ingredients, and 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips to the dough before rolling it out.  I also topped with almond slices before baking.  They turned out great, but a little salty.  Next time I will use only 1/2 tsp of salt.

I was asked to prepare scones for a baby shower. Knowing the recipe I usually prefer is on the drier side and less sweet (as I prefer them) I wanted to try a different scone recipe.  I came across this and have been very pleased with the results.  I prepared them, cut them out and froze them raw.  This morning I baked 2 of them, frozen at 350 for about 20-25 min.  You willl have to check them until you feel they are baked enough for you. They came out wonderful.  I am now in the midst of preparing at least 4 more batches and freezing them to be baked the day before the shower.   For ease, I did divide the second batch into 2 pieces and patted them into a square.  I then cut that into 4 squares and then diagonally cut each square into 2 triangles.  It gives you a total of 16 scones (for the entire recipe)  that are not too large to include in a brunch menu. Now I can't wait for the shower.    I know everyone will be pleased.

This is a great recipe for making scones and can be changed up to suit your tastes.  I cut the recipe in half (using 1 small egg rather than a large egg) and made 12 smaller scones out of the dough.  I also substituted 1/2 cup butterscotch chips and 1/2 cup chocolate chips for the raisins and brushed the unbaked scones with beaten egg white and sprinkled with sanding sugar for a more dessert-like scone.  These are nice and moist but bake up golden brown as well.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and was careful not to overmix/overknead the dough.  This has definitely become my "go-to" recipe for scones!

Fantastic! I added about a teaspoon of lemon extract and some lemon zest and about 1/3 cup of strawberry juice. I also made a glaze for them. I made them into circles using a glass which was the perfect size and froze them overnight before I baked. They baked for about 16-18 minutes and were perfect. They're great warm or cold!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I usually omit the raisins and substitute with whatever I'm "feeling" at the moment.  I usually roll out the dough, slice into rectangles, freeze on a cookie sheet, and then throw into a freezer bag to use when I need.  They are awesome right out of the oven.

My husband said those were the best scones he ever had and my picky kids loved them too. I added dried cranberries and walnuts insted of raisins and used 50/50 butter-margarine mix to lower the amount of cholesterol. Also next time I will make them smaller. Delicious!

Very tasty!  I don't like it when people modify and then rate the recipes, but that's what I did. I left out the raisins. I had to substitute lemon juice for cream of tartar, and I added grated lemon rind to the batter. So I guess I am actually giving a 5/5 to my lemon scones!

Great recipe that's hard to mess up!  I added 1 cup of frozen mixed berries in the batter. After 15 mins baking time the dough was still very wet so I ended up baking for extra 10 min!!!  I thought my scones will end up dry on the inside, but they turned out super moist and just the right color and texture on the outside.  Since I added berries, the scones turned out little too sweet for my taste, I would use 3/4 cups of sugar next time.

Excellent!  I modify the assembly directions as suggested by reviewer Lucia de Wagner.  My favorite version is Cranberry Orange in which I add to the recipe: 1 tsp packed grated orange rind, 1/4 c orange juice (I make it extra strong from concentrate), 1/2 t cinnamon, a few dashes of nutmeg, and 1 c Craisins.  This recipe makes 16 servings for me: make two rounds and cut into 8 wedges.  Even with the smaller wedges, I need to bake this recipe longer (about 20 minutes).

These are by far the BEST scones I have ever tasted. They are moist, not dry like most. I never made scones before so I came to my trusted ALLRECIPES website and searched. I read about 100 reviews before I decided on this recipe.  The only addition I made was I added fresh blueberry's, which I placed in the freezer for about an hour, and added them to the dough mixture. Freezing the berries prevents them from bleeding into the dough.  I baked a half dozen and froze the remainder.  ROB thanks for a great recipe which will be enjoyed by many more generations to come.

I have made these scones twice now, each time with the addition of chocoate chips.  All were eaten within 24 hours--my kids couldn't get enough.  I am soon going to try the blackberry version another reviewer suggested.  I will reinforce what another reviewer mentioned, don't over handle the dough.  Knead as little as possible.  To avoid more mixing, I placed my chocolate chips on top of the rolled out dough and pressed them into the dough with a rolling pin.  After cutting them with a cookie cutter, you have plenty of chocolate per bite and placing them on top just before cutting cuts down on handling the dough.

These turn out perfect every time....just follow the ORIGINAL recipe. For a lower calorie recipe with the same great flavor use non-fat yogurt instead of sour cream. They taste great and have the same perfect scone texture. Everyone LOVES these! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

These scones were amazing.  They were somewhat crunchy on the outside but were super soft on the inside.  It has a great texture.  I followed the recipe as is...except I added a bit of vanilla..and I added fresh blueberries instead of raisins.  Everyone loved them.

These were NOT proper scones... way to dense (cookie- like)... It tasted like a sugar cookie! Not a scone! I bake A LOT and have been told I'm a pretty good baker and I've had some great scones when visiting Britain and this scone had a weird texture. Very dense. This recipe did NOT have enough leavening. I should've known when I read it. Would not make again.

Healthy alternative: I used whole wheat flour, reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup, added 2 tsp almond extract, sliced almonds, dark chocolate chips and dried cherries.  Delicious!

My family loves this recipe and I am often asked to make them for events.  If I am not adding frozen fruit (which makes the dough moist) I add a bit of milk (1-2 Tbls)to the dough. This makes the scones softer.

I used toffee bits instead of raisins. The kids really loved them! They are even good as snack the next day. Very easy to make, but they make a LOT! Next time, I'll use chocolate chips, and just make half a batch. Love them though. Thanks for the recipe!

This truly is the only scone recipe you will ever need! They are so quick & easy (especially on Saturday mornings while the coffee is still brewing) and call for ingredients I have around anyway. I've thrown in everything from chopped nectarine to frozen blueberries (the blue streaks are just fun!), but are certainly awesome without additions... Everyone loves these! I wish I had a Grandma Johnson when I was little!

These are wonderful.  The best scones I have ever tasted.  I did tweak the recipe to make it a little more healthy.  I used half whole wheat flour, and half a cup of olive oil, and half a cup of butter (instead of 1 cup butter).  I also made 2 batches of 8, to end up with 16 scones instead of 12.  I am going to try dried cranberries with an orange glaze next...I can't wait.

These were AMAZING! Not dry at all, just pefect! Instead of raisins I put in blueberries. After seperating the dough into 12 pieces, i would take a piec, flatten it, lay in some blueberries, roll it back into a ball, stick in some extra blueberries, and flatten it a bit like a hamburger patty. They turned out GREAT!!

Delicious!  For the first time making this recipe, I wanted to follow the instructions as closely as possible so I could rate the original recipe.  I discovered I was out of cream of tartar, but I substituted 1 tsp of baking powder for the baking soda and cream of tartar (for a total of 3 tsp baking powder) and it worked fine.  Otherwise, I kept everything the same without any additions and divided the dough in half.  In one half I used golden raisins to follow the recipe.  In the other half, I added cinnamon chips and a few sprinkles of cinnamon in the dough.  I patted each dough half into a circle and cut them into 8 triangles each - a perfect size for a serving.  Both versions were great!  It's less than 24 hours later, and there are only 5 of the 16 left with two of us eating them!  I definitely recommend this recipe and can't wait to experiment with different add-ins.  Thanks for a great scone recipe!

These are awesome! I did not alter the ingredients, but instead of raisens I doubled the ingredients and divided the dough into 3 portions. I added some orange zest and fresh cranberries to some, chocolate chips to some and fresh blueberries to some. I sprinkled a coarse sugar on top before baking. They were all such a hit- people who normally do not eat scones loved them!!!!

These should satisfy even the most discriminating scone lover. A tad dry, not too sweet, and a very nice consistency. They took a few minutes longer to cook than the recipe said, and the batter seemed dry when kneading, but they came out great. I made one batch with golden raisins & ground cinnamon, and another batch with fresh blueberries & fresh sliced srawberries topped with some coarse sugar (I had to add a bit of extra flour on the fresh fruit ones) and they both got rave reviews. I would make again for sure. Thanks for sharing!

I think I must have done something wrong here. All these good ratings and mine turned out not great at all. There seemed to be way too much dry for the amount of wet ingredients when mixing and the end result was dry and not very tasty. I'll try again sometime and rerate. Sorry!

These were SO good.  I added lemon juice and poppyseeds to them and then drizzled them with lemon icing, delicious.  I've never made scones before and I didn't realize how much they would rise, they ended up being huge, so bear that in mind when you're cutting them. I also froze half the recipe to make later and these were just as good.

Excellent.  Substituted half whole wheat flour and two tablespoons of flax seed, and they were still yummy.  Made a half batch since I only had half the required butter, but added a whole egg.  Used cranberries.  Mixed the egg with the sour cream before adding to the dry ingredients.  Mixture was a bit sticky, but when baked, it was fine.  Kids gobbled them right up.

This is a family favorite of ours!  I leave out the raisins, but have used dried cranberries.  My daughter loves to help make them.  UPDATE..I have made these several times and the kids ask for them most every weekend.  I like to add freshly grated nutmeg, almond extract for a change of taste.

If I could rate this recipe for more stars- the poster would get it. I have been making this recipe now and shared it with a couple of friends. It is simply wonderful. I have used: dried currants, dried blueberries/walnuts, and dried cherry and walnut variations. I looked no further after finding this recipe. It is easy, versatile and foolproof. I am very fussy so this is the one to make! It is perfect...

This is the best scone recipe I've come across.  I made them once with chocolate chips and again with dried cherries and both were great.  The only thing I altered was to brush the tops with egg whites and dust them with a cinnamon-sugar mixture (2 tablespoons sugar to 1 teaspoon cinnamon).

Another amazing 5 star rating.  I substituted in 1 1/2 c. whole wheat flour for 1 1/2 white flour.  I also substitued in 1 1/4 c. blueberries in place of the raisins.  I gently kneaded this into a rectangle the size of my large cutting board.  I cut it in half both ways, and then the 4 large squares I cut in half again.  I then cut each little square diagonal and ended up with 32 small triangles.  I sprayed two cookie sheets with Crisco non-stick cooking spray with Pillsbury flour, and placed 16 triangles on each sheet.  It took a while to cook.  I had to keep adding time as I had both cookie sheets in the oven at the same time.  They came off the cookie sheets no problem.  They actually increased into perfect-sized scones to take to a ladies breakfast.  They were so good!  Next time I am going to add in some cinnamon.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is - by far - the best scone recipe I have ever tried. I have made these with dried cranberry, orange zest & walnuts and it came out great!

These were absolutely what I wanted.  I ate at an Irish restaurant last weekend and I loved the scones that I had.  I wanted to re-create my meal there but I had never made a batch of scones before.  I saw this recipe on allrecipes.com and noted the glowing reviews.  I made the recipe tonight and the scones turned out beautifully!  I wouldn't change one thing about them.  Thank you Grandma Johnson, wherever you are!  (FYI:  I posted a picture of them.  It is the picture with a scone on a green plate. )

I use half whole wheat flour and half unbleached all purpose flour. As others have said, I also use a little more cream of tartar (usually a slightly rounded 1/4 tsp).  This is excellent.  I get requests for these from my husband's co-workers.  I can either make cinnamon (add 1 tbsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla) or cranberry-orange (soak dried cranberries in 1 tsp orange extract plus enough hot water to cover; use zest of 1 orange.  Once cranberries are plump, drain well.)

I really didn't like these...the dough was very hard to get to come together (I followed the recipe to the letter-and the dough was very dry).  It took them at least 30 min to bake and they are very dough/cake like.

After reading all of the other reviews, I guess I expected too much.  I have made scones numerous times and I have never been as disappointed as I was with these.  They were bland with a bitter after taste.  I will keep using my other recipes.

These were just okay for me - didn't taste as much like a scone as I thought they would.  More like a biscuit.

These turned out great! I used an eggwash on the tops so they'd turn out a pretty color. And I subbed the raisins with blueberries. They're fantastic!

I gave this four starts because they taste good.  However, I will say they don't really taste like scones I had while living in England.  They are way too sweet.  If I make them again, I'd use about 1/2 cup of sugar.  Also, the dough came out very dry.  I had to add sour cream.  They also took about 30 minutes to bake.

I made 2 scone recipes from this website for the same morning brunch.  This one was by far the better one.  I substituted dried sweeted cranberries for the raisins.  My guests really enjoyed these and they took some home with them.

I wanted an easy quick yummy fresh hot bread to serve with spagetti and this recipe worked! Being a lover of cheese, I added grated old cheddar cheese.  I didn't measure out, I added until I thought there was a hearty and evenly distributed amount of cheese mixed throughout the dough.  Then I rolled out and used a heart shape cookie cutter! That's funny!  This is not a heart smart recipe!!  Especially with all the cheese I added!! Eddie loved the scones more than my spagetti!!

Did everything as advertised.  Rolled out so nicely.  Just the right sweetness.  They were perfect.  Fantastic texture and flavor.  Melt-in-your-mouth (a lot!).  Missed the part about the wedges, though, so used a large cup as a "biscuit cutter" for the 12 and then went back and did all of the "scraps" it was so good.  Will be back to this one often.  Thanks!

These were wonderful!  This was my first time to make scones, and they came out great!  I think next time I will reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup, as they were a tad sweeter than expected.  I had only lowfat sour cream on hand, but it worked great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for a baby shower. They were a hit. I made chocolate chip (they were ok) and cranberry (they were better) I thought the scones were not sweet enough but evryone else thought they were perfect. Next time I may add more sugar and different berries and other sweet add-ins. Many compliments. Will use again!!

I love these things! Made half a batch and between me and my sister they were gone before nightfall. I put mini chocolate chips in one third of them, sprinkled cinnamon sugar on another third, and left the rest plain. I didn't care for the chocolate ones(and I'm usually a chocoholic) but my sister devoured them. I bet these would be great with berries in them, or just leave them plain, they are addicting.

WOW!!! wow wow wow!!! I just made these scones for a family brunch and they are OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!! I don't even know how to describe how yummy they are.  You just gotta try em!  I divided the dough into three parts, the first batch is plain. Then there is a cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla combo. The last is lemon poppyseed.  The last two are still in the oven, so I'm basing my review on the scones plain exactly as the recipe states minus the raisins.  Too good for words!!! :)

Another 5 star review....these were great! I just made them tonight. They are very light and yummy.  I divided the dough in half and added almond flavor, slivered almonds and dried cranberries to one half and pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice and rasins to the other half.  I also brushed tops with a little milk and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  I can't wait to try some of the other add in suggestions!

Perfect scone!!!! It's light, moist, soft and not too sweet.  I don't have sour cream so I replace it with plain yogurt.  I don't know if it's the yogurt which make the batter hard to roll out (quite sticky).  Next time I will use sour cream. I make it with prune instead of raisin, yet it's still very yummy! Thanks for the recipe.

These turned out perfectly.  I followed the suggestions to add 1/2tsp nutmeg, 1tsp cinnamon, and 1tsp vanilla.  I made half with raisins and half with chopped pecans.  I served them with clotted cream.  They were very popular!

I had some trouble getting the dough to come together - maybe since I used dried cranberries and white chocolate chips.  There were no complaints from the family though!

Excellent texture!  I used an insulated baking sheet and needed to bake longer.  I was tempted to add extra liquid because the dough didn’t come together easily.  Didn’t want to deviate from the recipe so instead mixed it by hand which did the trick.

Wonderful in all respects.  I have used 3 cups white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour to take it up another notch!!!  I have also rolled into a rectangle and cut into 24 diamonds which make them a smaller and more manageable size.

These scones were so good, they were incredibly tender and sweet.  A little different than what I was expecting, I was thinking something a little less sweet - they were almost like cookies.  But I loved them still, and were excellent with clotted cream and jam

Did indeed remind me of Grannies home made scones.  We like them smaller and add all kinds of things to them now!
Lovely, just how they are supposed to taste! Cheers!

My family is still talking about *my* famous scones! These are excellent and so versatile. I made them for Christmas morning and doubled the recipe ( I know that's supposed to be a big 'no-no' but with a family of 6, it is a necessity!) Anyway, I then split it 3 ways and added dried cranberries to one, mini-chocolate chips to the other and lemon oil (or extract - 1 tsp or so) to the last. I made some glaze and snipped the end of a baggie so I could pipe the decorative stripes and I swear, the people at Starbucks called and asked me for the recipe ;) The chocolate chip ones were a major hit and I made chocolate icing so the visual contrast was really good - the lemon were my favorite. I was in a rush but next time I will add a bit of rind and sprinkle a touch of yellow sugar across the top. ( I will skip the cranberry since it was sadly ignored next to the chocolate and lemon!)  **These did take a while to make - pastry blending the shortening into a double-batch had me grimacing a bit but they were really worth it**

This is the first time I have ever made scones and this recipe is fabulous!  My husband is a pastry chef and he has already scarfed down a few (they came out of the oven 20 minutes ago!)  I made the basic recipe with cinnamon chips and they are awesome!  I think next time I will take the sugar down to 3/4 cup, though - only because of the sweet chips.  I did not have any cream of tartar, so I substituted 3/4 tsp. lemon juice and they turned out great!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent scones!  This was my first experience making scones, and I made some changes based on previous reviews:  I used 2 cups of wheat flour and 2 cups regular flour, and the scones came out with a great consistency.  Also, I used about 3/4 cup sugar instead of the full cup.  I split the dough in two and added 1 cup butterscotch chips to one half, and about 1 cup dried apricots and 1 cup white chocolate chips to the other half.  I made patties out of the dough and got about 9 patties out of each half (18 scones total).  Also needed to up the baking time: baked in a convection oven on 325 for about 20 minutes.

This scone recipe is BY FAR the best I've ever tasted. I decided to try it because a small bag of scone mix from the store cost over $4....It's a decision I don't regret! These scones are absolutely delicious! I sprinkled them with brown sugar just before putting in the oven, and then served them with honey butter. WONDERFUL! My husband loved these scones! I will definitely make these regularly! Thanks so much... This recipe ROCKS!

These are wonderful and with unlimited mix-in options.  My favorite is w/ white choc chips and craisins.  Once I forgot to add sugar and my co-workers still ate every last one!  Crumbly at first, but keep kneading and it will stick together.  Rather than cutting like a pie, I cut evenly across in 1 inch strips.

This recipe was the first time I ever made scones.  My children and neighbors loved them.  It may be because I substitued mini chocolate chips for the raisins -- so they tasted like light, flaky chocolate chip cookies!  A time/effort saving step I used was to mix the dry ingredients in my food processor then drop slices of chilled butter through the chute while running.  That simplified the work.  I also made 24 smaller scones instead of 12 huge ones.

I have made this recipe several times, and it only gets better. I have also tried several other scone recipes, and none compare to this one. They freeze very well also. When I take them out of the freezer, I put them in the oven @ 350 degrees for about 10 minutes.

I divided the dough into 2 portions, made some plain and some with chocolate chips scones. Both turned out fine. I used cookies cutter to cut, I think 3/4 inch thick is abit too flat, 1 inch will be better. My fiance said this scone tastes nicer than the one I bought from bakery days ago. He doesn't like too buttery taste, this is just fine. I will bake again, perhaps with sultanas or berries.

My first time ever making scones and they came out perfect!!  I used white chips and dried sweetened cranberries.  This recipe made 16 large scones - I cut in in 16 as other reviewers suggested.  I took some scones over to two different friends and both asked for the recipe.  Delicious!  Next time: I will roll the dough into a rectangle and cut into squares instead of triangles, or roll into two circles and cut 8 slices from each circle. (my 16 slices were a little narrow at the tips)  Also, these filled up my largest baking sheet - I might try baking them on two sheets so they don't run together.

This recipe is fabulous!  My mother is an instructor at a culinary institute and she was impressed!  I  used a dried fruit  mix consisting of currents, raspberries, mango, papaya, cranberries, blueberries and cherries.   If you soak the dried fruit in some warm water for a few minutes it will soften the fruit.

I've been making these scones for a few months now.  My husband loves one for his coffee break and my sons are always asking me to make them for them, too.  I've given this recipe to friends who also love them.  They're easy and fabulous!!  I've made them with dried cherries and almond extract, with slivered almonds, lemon poppyseed (especially good!), any way I can.  Thank you for sharing!

Excellent recipe.  We're Scots, and this was truly the best scone I have made - better than the recipe from home.  Mother was mildly skeptical about the sour cream but these are moist and tender.
The only addition I will make in the future is a wee bit of lemon or orange peel to enhance the currants.  We thank you!!

These were really terrific.  The only modification I made was to add orange and lemon zest that I had let sit in about 1 tbsp of milk while I prepared the recipe.  I also made 2 rounds instead of just one and I cut each round into 8 wedges, like another reviewer recommended.  I baked most of the scones in my regular oven, and the rest in my convection toaster oven.  What a diffrence the convection oven makes!  I also sprinkled a few of them with sugar, but it didn't really do much. I won't try that again.  I may try to add a bit of moisture next time, maybe by adding a bit more sour cream, or a few tablespoons of milk or cream.  I also made a quick orange/honey butter to spead on these delectable treats.  I just blended some orange zest, a few tsp of OJ and of honey into a stick of butter, mmmmm.

Too much sugar, too much butter.  I could feel my arteries clogging as I ate these.  Sure they taste good but unless you're deficient in cholesteral or need to gain weight fast then I wouldn't recommend this recipe.  I give it 2 stars for the taste, and no more for the lack of healthiness of this food.

This is my second review of this recipe, after having read other submitter's comments and attempting the recipe several more times.  As written, I didn't have much success with the recipe.  However, following other's advice, I slightly softened the butter and divided the dough into two smaller circles before cutting it.  The scones have turned out perfectly the last few times I've made them.  The delicate and rich flavor is just to die for.  I brush them with an egg wash and sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar before baking, ala Panera Bread Company.  Absolutely delicious.  Highly recommended recipe for scone lovers.

They're easy to make and always a hit.

I have never made scones before, I think I messed with the dough too much as they turned out like a cake-like cookie.  They were still very tasty and easy to make.  I made 1/2 with chocolate chips and 1/2 I sprinkled with cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice!!!

These are fab!  I made these for a big family get together and did two batches, one with dried apricots and one with rum soaked raisins.  Both kinds disappeared in record time and now my husband's family is duly impressed with my talents in the kitchen.  I will be making these for Christmas morning breakfast.

Very delicious served with lemon curd or jam!  I like to premake the dry mix and have it on hand and then when I have company or feeel like scones my prep time is cut in half!

These were excellent!  I brought them to work and within 10 minutes I had 3 requests for the recipe!  I put raisins in some, cinnamon and brown sugar on top of some, and left some plain.  I think I will try craisins and orange zest next time!  I am going to make these for Fathers Day brunch!  I wonder... could yogurt be substituted for the sour cream?
Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I had no sour cream and used plain yogurt instead. Except for the added bake time, the scones were excellent.

This was too easy!!  I have never made scones before today and they were great.  I divided my dough and put craisins in half the batch and left the other half plain.  While both were good, the craisins are the way to go.  My cooking time was longer than recommended but they were worth the wait.  Will definitely do these again.

These were the best scones I have had since I live in England 10 years ago!  Thank you for the great recipes.  To all those "scone" lovers out there these are what I would call the American Version as they are crumbly on the outside and soft in the center........which is my favorite type of scone next to the more round and soft ones.

Excellent, easy recipe.  Rather than wedge cut the dough, I rolled it out and used a 3" diameter cookie cutter to make circular scones -- found I had to bake them a bit longer than the recipe called for.  Very tasty.  I served it for Friday afternoon unch with the gals, with a chilled white wine, strawberry/feta salad and the awesome Asparagus Quiche found on this site.  Excellent reviews!

I've made this recipe several times now for several different crowds.  They all (all different ages) liked them.  I also swiped the tops with milk then sprinkled sugar on before I baked them.  They turned out beautifully with minimal work.  This recipe has always made more than 12 for me.

These were absolutely delicious!  My husband is from Scotland, and after visiting there last year, I fell in love with scones.  These were better than any I had there.  They're very rich and yummy.  We topped them with jam and whipped cream, just as they are done in Britain.  The whole family loved them.

This was among the first scone recipes I have tried, and my whole family loves it.  They keep requesting them, and even though I would like to try some other flavors, my family just keeps wanting me to make these.  These scones have been shared with family and friends - over 20 people including my immediate family - and they ALL loved them!!

For years I've had a go-to recipe for scones that would use up old milk.  Lately though, instead of having a lot of milk to use, I've had a lot of leftover yogurt, and remembered I'd used this recipe once years ago.  I used the yogurt instead of sour cream, and the texture and consistency of both the batter and the finished product are exactly as I feel scones should be.  (That means, they are how I remember them growing up.)  The technique of activating the baking soda with the acidity of the yogurt makes them so fluffy, and is probably a lost art, as very few modern recipes use this method.  I might have to use this recipe more often in the future.  Thank you Grandma Johnson, whoever you are.

I first mad these delicious scones over two years ago.  Some friends and I were having a tea party, and I was in charge of the scones.  This recipe did not disappoint! I split the dough in thirds, and added a different mix in to each third. Then I made 3/4" high rectangle of each type, cutting zigzag across to make 8 mini scones of each type.  For the mix-ins I used mini chocolate chips in one, golden raisins in another and left the last plain.  Since then I have also added dried cranberries and orange extract for an amazing cranberry orange scone.  This also works well with pecans and chopped dates for a truly decadent treat! Wonderful recipe! A definite keeper!

These scones are amazing! They are very incredible.  

TIPS: 

Bake for 15 min , not 12. (underdone) 

Try Cranberry Orange! (dried cranberries instead of raisins and orange zest)

Bake with demerara sugar on top (crunchy and sweet) 

Use cold butter!  

RAISIN SUBSTITUTES: 
Dried Blueberries
Craisins (dried cranberries)
Chocolate Chips
Pecans


Great Scones.  I will definitely make them more.

Because I didn't want to overwork the dough I followed Lucia de Wagner's steps and came out with an amazingly WONDERFUL scone.  I baked three and froze the rest for future enjoyment.  Thank you for an amazing recipe

Added rind rind of one medium orange with dry ingredients and soaked one cup of craisins in the juice. Used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. Omitted the raisins. Brushed top of each scone with melted butter and sprinkled cinnamon ,sugar and brown sugar combined onto each scone. Baked for 30-40 min. Until tops golden.

I have never made scones before today, I immediately had to make this  recipe. I had 1/2 of a large container of sour cream in the fridge I needed to use. They came out great! The only thing I did different was smash sliced almonds on the top before I cooked them, I pushed them down into the scones. I also cooked them about 8 minutes longer than the recipe called for to make them toasty brown and crunchy. This is the way I will use the extra sour cream from now on!

I just made the scones and they are delicious, however, the round that I pressed the dough into created quite large wedges.  Next time I will make 2 rounds for smaller wedges, had to cut the scone wedges after baking and bake a little longer as the middles were not done. I added craisins and white chocolate chips.

These were a little labor intensive, but came out great. The sour cream/baking soda combination was new to me, but really made the end product light and delicious. I added about a tablespoon of lemon zest and 3/4 c of dried cranberries.

Absolutely wonderful! Made the basic scones (no extra additions this time but will definitely in the future) and served with homemade strawberry jam & raspberry jam. Num num num!

I'm not a huge fan of scones and neither is my hubby, but this recipe was so highly rated, I decided to give it a try. Guess what!?! Now we are fans! These are really good. Not dry like so many. I took others advice and added orange extract, orange zest, and dried cranberries and they were very good. I will definitely continue to make these.

great recipe!  I also added some vanilla and increased the sugar by 1/4 cup for cranberry/almond (to counter the tartness!).  I also tried chopping apples and walnuts and adding some cinnamon and nutmeg. Next, I'm trying chocolate & toffee with a caramel drizzle!

My daughter made this recipe. This was the first time I've had scones I liked !!!  Most are either too much like cake or too much like a cookie.  She made the basic dough then added chocolate chips to some and lemon poppy seed to the rest. This dough freezes very well. This one is a keeper.

Delicious!  Have made the recipe several times and decided next time I'll make "mini scones".  That way I won't feel as guilty eating two.  The addition of a teaspoon of orange zest and Craisins in the batter and orange zest and fresh orange juice to a confectioner's sugar glaze, drizzled over the scones right from the oven, is my favorite.  I'll be trying others suggestions, too. Great recipe!

This is such an amazing recipe. First,i halved the ingredients because i did not have enough flour. I did not have cream of tartar so i substituted it with lemon juice (1/4t cream of tartar = 1/2t lemon juice).I did not have sour cream so i used fage 0% fat greek yoghurt instead. I added the lemon juice and baking soda to the yoghurt. I also used mixed fruit(sultanas, raisins and candied peel) and sweetened dessicated coconut.I glazed the scones with egg wash before putting them in the oven and sprinkled cinnamon sugar... so yum yum and scrumptious. My husbie totally loves it.

Excellent recipe and works beautifully followed as per the directions. Someone said they might be better without the egg........scones nearly, nearly always have an egg  or two whatever depends on the amount of flour.         I was brought up eating and baking scones so have tasted good and bad.  Scones, like biscuits, are better eaten fresh.

Made these as a test run for my youngest's Tea Party Birthday.  Followed the directions exactly but divided the dough and made 1/2 plain and 1/2 with dried blueberries.  They were delicious!  My daughter loved them too (she's almost 4) and gave her seal of approval.  I plan to make these into 2.5 inch rounds with a biscuit cutter in blueberry and chocolate chip for her friends to have with their 'tea' at her party.  Thanks for a new favorite go to recipe!

This is a great recipe.   The only changes were I cooked them for a few minutes longer and drizzled confectioners sugar mixed with a small amount of water and vanilla.   Have made this for many occasions and it is always a hit.   Thanks for the recipe. DG

First time baking raisin scones using this recipe. Both me and my husband love it! I'd reduce the amount of sugar to 3/4 cups rather than 1 cup if you are adding raisins. In addition, I think the baking time should be at least 22 to 25 minutes? My doughs looked undercooked when I checked at 15 minutes...wonder if anyone experiences the same issue. 

Overall, very nice recipe. Thanks for sharing!

My first attempt  with scones was so-so. I decided to try this recipe and I'm so glad.  They were wonderful.  I made Orange Choc chip since they were for a kid's book club.  Added fresh orange zest and about  tblsp juice to sour cream mixture. Then topped with an orange glaze.  Mixed my egg with the sour cream just before adding  to the dry ingredients.  Picked up some great tips by watching the Chef John Scone video.  Add your fruit/Choc chips to the flour mixture to keep from over working the dough,  Split my dough into two  rounds. Loved the tip to use saran wrap to knead and form dough.  Saves on the mess

This recipe was GREAT!  I added an extra 1/2 cup sugar as others suggested. I only had low-fat sour cream so I used that instead of regular and could not even tell at all.  I mixed the dry ingredients in the food processor, added the butter and then the sour cream mixture. I made half the batch plain, 1/4 of the batch with a handful of mini chocolate chips and 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract and 1/4 of the batch with 3/4 tsp. almond extract and fresh raspberries.  The chocolate chip ones were my husband's favorite and the almond/rasp ones were mine.  The plain were REALLY good too.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and couldn't have been happier with the outcome.  The scones were delicious.  I had a very happy husband who has asked me to make them at least once a month from now on!  Next time I may try cutting them a tad smaller as one was too big for me and I will try some of the other suggested variations.  I also made the Devonshire Cream recipe which was perfect with a little lemon curd.  :)

I usually find scones to be a little on the dry side but these are just perfect and soooo good. I tried an orange/cranberry version that I read from the reviews and it came out awesome to be the first time I make them.  I got all thumbs up last night at my friend's place where I brought them to share.
I'll try more versions in the future and this recipe is to be treasured! Thanks for sharing!

I have made this a couple times now.  Each time the dough has turned out so dry that I have to add more sour cream just to get it to all stick together.  I much prefer the Simple Scones on this website to this recipe.

I read the reviews that some people were freezing 1/2 the dough but didn't think I needed to do that so baked the whole batch, 1/2 with mini choc chips and vanilla extract and 1/2 with orange extract and dried cranberries. Well, guess what! They were gone in less than 2 days! That means they were a hit at our home! I didn't have any trouble at all with sticky dough. It was easy to work with. This time I put butterscotch chips in 1/2 and cherry chips in the other 1/2 and forgot all about the extract. They weren't quite as good; definitely needs the extract and more chips (I didn't measure, just scooped up a handful). Both times I made these, I dipped the tops into sugar before baking. It was a nice touch, especially since they are not very sweet. My son already wants me to make them again and we still have some of this last batch! By the way, my ulu worked great for slicing the dough.

Spectacular!  I made them with cranberry-orange and homemade cinnamon chips.  They come out light and fluffy.  The sour cream and baking soda adds a nice fluffyness.

I was told many years ago, when a recipe calls for sour cream, substitute Crème Fraiche. So I did and YUM YUM! I also used one cup of chilled Irish cream (butter). I added a couple of dashes of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla as suggested by others. Will make these again and again.

These were amazing. I have never had such great scones. I suggested going to Panera, but I wanted to try this recipe. I think it is better than what I would've gotten!

This recipe is absolutely amazing!  This is now a major family favorite on the first try of baking (and tasting!) this simple recipe.  Also, instead of raisins, I used chocolate chips for a more kid-friendly food.  Try it-it tastes like cake!

these tasted delish! Very easy to make, I didnt add an other flour when mixing and I made blueberry white chocolate. They were dense and moist. I did have to bake mine for 23-24 mins. to get them brown on the botton and they were perfect. I cut them and put half of the uncut scones in the freezer.

These are the best scones I have ever had!  My husband couldn't get enough of them either!  I mixed the sour cream in baking soda in a bowl.  Beat the butter and sugar in another.  Then added the egg and a teaspoon of vanilla.  Mixed the dry ingredients together, added them to the butter/sugar mixture.  Then added the sour cream.    I used chocolate chips instead of raisins, but plan on making many different combinations!  I also sprinkled raw sugar on top before baking.  Thank you for an excellent recipe!!

Made these yesterday morning.  This recipe makes a lot of dough so I divided in half.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to one half and chocolate chips to the other.  Next time I would use 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and a few more chips to the other (I just kind of eye balled the chips).  Both were excellent.  I think the sky is the limit in terms of what you can add to these.  I also want to try freezing the dough after it's been rolled out and cut.  Excellent recipe!!

Excellent. I had never made scones before, but I tried this recipie this morning. I didn't have cream of tarter but I don't think it really made a difference to leave it out. They were SOOO delicious! Instead of raisins, I used chopped cranberries and some orange zest. They turned out amazing, I was shocked! My Husband ate 5 of them! This is the only scone recipe you need...

AMAZING!!!! Made them for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them!  I used dried berries instead of raisins.  Also, I cut the butter in with my food processor which saved time.  The bottoms turned brown quickly so I touched the tops to see if they were finished and it sunk in like raw batter.  I was worried but the firmed up as they cooled.  I should mention I am not an experienced baker so I wasn't aware that was possible:)

I love, love this recipe! The only thing I changed was that I added a little milk to make the dough slightly sticky, I can't tell you how much I added, since I did it by feel, but they turned out delish! I made cranberry orange spice scones and they were, by far, the best scones I've ever had. I am in love with this recipe!!

Thank you Grandma Johnson!  These scones are so tasty.  I ended up separating the dough into two parts.  One half I added 1/2 cup chopped chocolate chips, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1 tsp. vanilla extract.  The other half I added 1/2 cup of craisins, 1/2 cup sliced almonds, 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract and about 1/8 tsp. almond extract because I ran out, otherwise I would have used more.  Also, next time I will add more craisins.  I didn't use raisins in this recipe but this is a great one for altering flavors.  Each 1/2 of dough was sliced into 8 wedges-totaling 16 wedges.  I will use this recipe over and over, just change up the flavors a bit.  Had to freeze half of them, they are so addicting.  Thanks again :)

These are God's gift to humans. So great. I use half butter, half Nucoa (margarine) and they were so great. 

I added some pumpkin (about 1/4c) and 1tbs of pumpkin spice to HALF of a batch and those were nice for fall. Mild flavor, but I didn't want to over-do it and run half of a batch.

OMGoodness!  These are the best!  I did half a batch with mini chocolate chips and half with huckleberries.  With the ones with choc. chips, they were a bit drier than the ones with hucklberries because of the extra moisture.  Can anyone tell me what I could add to the choc. chips ones to make them moisture?
Wonderful, wonderful receipe!

These were absolutely delicious - soft, flaky, and tasty! I added about a tbsp each of lemon zest and juice while mixing in the sour cream, and I substituted a cup of dried blueberries for the raisins.

I made these this morning using a gluten free flour blend (I use 2 parts white rice fllour, 2/3 parts potato starch, 1/3 part tapioca flour). I added white chocolate and fresh berries. They were delicious. One of the easiest recipes that I have converted over to GF baking. I also made it as presented and the family raved about them. I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

I used currants instead of raisins. Got them at a British foods store. Also, brushed the tops with egg white and sprinkled with sugar. Made the night before and put in the fridge, then baked in the morning. Yummy!

OMG WOW!!! I added 1/2 cup orange juice, 1 tbsp orange zest and 1 cup cranberries instead of raisins. These were amazing! Needed a little flour to be able to knead them, but came out of the oven moist and delicious. I plan on making these again and again.

Awesome. I made just plain scones because I didnt want to mess up and waste my fruit lol. But they turned out awesome, except I have to learn to cut better haha. I added powdered sugar on top and they are crisp yet moist love it. The dough was a little crumbly but I think that was my own fault.

Excellent!  If looking for the perfect scone recipe MAKE THESE! Not too sweet; just right for a scone. I added the zest of 1 orange, 1/2 cup OJ and about a cup of dried cranberries.  Made them for my "Royal Wedding Party" when Prince William & Kate Middleton got married - very fun!  We topped with "easy clotted cream" (that was OK but I preferred to top with butter) - enjoy!!

these are wonderful...i have made these twice now; the first time was a bit fraught, and i had to add some milk to get the dough to come together---i made the first batch with regular sugar, and tonight i've made the second batch with Splenda (again needing a little milk) and they are brilliant!  they are light, sweet, delightful, and rise beautifully...only wish i could find some clotted Devonshire cream to have with them (Marscarpone cheese is a close but inferior substitute)---thank you!!!  My husband, who is from England, said his aunt, a lifelong member of the Women's Institute would be proud to serve them :)  High praise indeed!!!

Well, this is just an outstanding recipe.  I've been looking for the perfect scone recipe for a while when I stumbled on this one (why I did not search allrecipes sooner is beyond me).  It's very easy and the scones came out moist, yet crumbly they way they ought to.   They are exactly what I hoped for.    I did follow the one hint of mixing the butter/sugar/egg/vanilla and adding together to the dry ingredients and that worked really well.

This recipe definitely makes a big enough batch that you can do two flavors with it.  If I had cut twelve wedges from one disk of this recipe I would have scones that were much too big.  I took a hint from others and just cut out circles with a biscuit cutter and that worked much better -- about 20 scones per batch that way.

This will definitely become an oft used recipe for me.

The only scone recipe I use!! This recipe is so versatile, I make all kinds of different scones depending on the season and my family's moods. Great with any dried fruits. I add a cup of pureed pumpkin and some pumpkin pie spice in the fall (leaving out the raisins). I use molasses, ginger, and cinnamon at Christmas time for a gingerbread flavor. Each modification does require some tweaking of the flour, however. My son routinely asks for these on Saturday mornings, and they are great leftover! Just pop in microwave for 10-20 seconds.

I made these with the zest of one orange instead of the raisins, substituted 1 cup of whole grain white flour for an equal amount all-purpose, and added a generous splash of orange juice to get the dough to stick together(it was a little dry, probably because of the white whole wheat flour I used).  These are delicious despite my tinkering, and I can't wait to make them again- thanks for sharing!

My friend and I made scones for the first time and this recipe turned out really well! I would suggest that if someone likes less sugary scones to lower the butter and sugar, replacing the rest of the butter with oil. Our first batch turned out uncoiled in the middle and then my friend has a genius idea of sticking them into microwave wrapped in paper towel, they turned fine :) We are so making this again!

I get many raves when I make these scones.  I don't normally keep sour cream, so this is not a spur of the moment scone recipe (I have an authentic Scottish one for that).  It IS my favorite!

Good but rather rich in a different sort of way.  Seems a cross between and cookie, muffin and biscuit.  We used chocolate chips instead of raisins.  Very good.  I would cut it different to make each one smaller.  It is too big a piece.  I cooked it in a cast iron skillet which worked very well.  Made it thicker so had to cook longer.  I would do it again but try to cut recipe in half so not as think.  Overall good.

This is the best Scone recipe on the planet. We use the Ocean Spray brand Craisins. The Pomegranate Juice infused dried Cranberries are the best as far as my family is concerned. Enjoy, we do. And thank you Grandma Johnson.

These are so adicting I have to hide them from myself.  The orginal recipe is fantastic.  Just for fun, I subbed mango yogurt for the sour cream and added dried mango w/ a glaze made w/ powdered sugar and orange juice.  My husbands coworks are now paying me to make these.  Dried cherries & almonds w/ almond extract is really good too.

People-this is the one, this is the recipe you've been looking for! I will agree with others, the dough seems dry, but if you continue to knead gently, just so that it all holds together (like a pie crust) it will still appear somewhat crumbly, but it will bake beautifully! I omitted the raisins and added about 1 cup blackberries (halved) and about 1/2 c white chocolate (chopped)with the sour cream/egg mixtures. These are tender, moist and very rich-but everyone needs a treat. My son thinks he likes blackberries now :)

Good. I guess if you like scones.  Didn't care for them myself nor did my family.  They taste like a sweet, crunchy buscuit with rasins.  I threw the whole batch in the trash can minus the one we tasted.

An excellent, sweet, vanilla scone -- but 350 is too low a temp for baking. 400 degrees (the usual temp for biscuits) is better. The scones tend to brown on bottom before they brown on top, so check towards the end of your baking time.   I mixed these by hand (no food processor to cut in the butter) and the dough is a bit chunky and wet -- it may be easier to pat into shapes than to roll out and cut I did both, and all the scones came out just fine.

"Delicious"!!!  I rolled out the dough to 3/8" thick then cut in 6" squares. I cut each square diagonally making 2 pieces of dough. I topped one of the halfs with fresh blueberrys and placed the other piece on top enclosing the fresh fruit. I lightly moistuned the top of the scone and sprinkeled with sugar. My new favorite scone recipie!

These were very good and easy.  I made some plain vanilla ( by adding a little extra sugar and 2 tsp. of vanilla extract) and cinnamon and sugar.  My family loved them.  I will be making them again and adding different things.  Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect basic sconE recipe! The first time I split it in two and made ghirardelli chocolate chip and blueberry. Both were delicious and I can't wait to experiment with other flavors!

I love these!  They are SO yummy.  I use blueberries instead of raisins and add cinnamon and vanilla.  Would be good too in cranberry-orange, white chocolate raspberry and all sorts of combinations.

This was the first time I made scones, and they were absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe to a T, but used blueberries instead of raisins. I can't wait to make other kinds of scones following this recipe.

This was a delicious recipe. I did change it since I didn't have a few things in my panty, but, regardless, this is a great starting recipe and easy to change. I recommend looking up substitutions though if you're unfamiliar with them since often you will need to change the amount. Here is what I did: I used blueberry yogurt instead of the sour cream, and because of it, added an extra tsp of baking soda, I also used 1/2 tsp lemon juice instead of the cream of tartar, and used a cup of fresh blueberries instead of the raisins. My family loved it. I can't wait to alter it again and see what other wonderful things I do with this recipe.

Pretty good.  They seemed a bit salty so next time I will add less salt (I did use a tiny bit less sugar and thought I decreased the salt enough).  I sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon on top.  I looked for cinnamon chips but could not find any.  Also would definitely add raisins or something, but I did not have any on hand.

WOW!  This was a huge hit at my house- and it was so easy!!!  I love how versatile the recipe is.  I replaced with raisins with chocolate chunks, then in another batch I replaced the raisins with crushed walnuts and added a maple glaze (1.5 cups powdered sugar, tsp of maple extract, 5+ tsp water).  My favorite was (again, no raisins) adding the zest of one lemon, some dried cranberries, and a lemon glaze (1.5 cups powdered sugar and the juice of the lemon)  SO Yummy!

I love these scones! I made a few changes: 1) I use low fat plain yogurt instead of sour cream 2) no cream of tartar (did not have any and turned out great) 3) Whole wheat white flour instead of all purpose (regular whole wheat is great too). With these changes the nutrition value increased substantially making it a healthier breakfast option. I keep the butter because it tastes good and there are worse things for your health!!!

I've always been intimidated to make scones, but this recipe is surprisingly easy!  The flavor isn't bad as-is, but there's definitely room to improvise.  The texture, however, was a little too moist for my liking.

When I went to make this recipe I realized that I didn't have any sour cream, so instead I used 1 cup of yogurt as a substitute (though they cooked for more like 25 minutes). They turned out great! The yogurt gave a subtle bite similar to that of the sour cream, and the raisins were delicious. Three days later the center was still moist and light. My sister and mother loved them and are constantly nibbling on them.

These are tasty, but they dont have the right texture - more like a muffin top, moist biscuit or quickbread than a scone.

Tomorrow afternoon one of the world leaders of a Tibetan Buddhist lineage is coming to my house to bless a holy object I made with relics of Buddha and other enlightened masters. I wanted to serve tea and something nice like a scone, so today I made a test-run of this recipe exactly as-is, using dried cherries instead of raisins and adding 1 tsp almond extract to the sour cream. When the first one came out of the oven and I tasted it, I actually started crying. I was so happy to have such a PERFECT scone to serve on such an important occasion. I'm actually still crying about it. This is so great -- THANK YOU Grandma Johnson and family!!!

I just made a batch of these for a mother-daughter tea party. I've never been a big scone fan but wanted to try one before serving them. Wow! I think I'm going to be a big scone fan now. These are absolutely wonderful. I made them exactly as directed except for dividing the dough into two circles for cutting. I can't wait to try them with some of the suggested mix-ins.

These were unreal.  I've never made scones before and they turned out perfect.  I didn't have any sour cream so I took a chance and used plain yogurt (full fat) and it worked out fine.  I added 1 tsp vanilla and used milk chocolate chips and skor(heath) pieces.  Yummy

Amazing recipe!  I used it to make apricot ginger scones and they came out beautifully.  I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 cup dried apricots, diced, and 3/4 cup crystalized ginger, diced.  It may be because of my additions, but I found that they needed a little longer than 15 minutes, when the tops were golden brown they were perfect.

Very good scones.  the flavor of the sour cream is there but not overpowering.  I did add in the raisins but didn't have quite a cup, so I tossed in some leftover chopped pistachios as well.  I cut into 12 scones but it seemed weird to me (I didn't cut equally bc I cut as if I were cutting a pie--not what the recipe intended, but I've never been good at dividing equally) so I ended up with 16 scones.  They were still decent sized scones.  My only issue with these was the bake time.  Perhaps I didn't make them thin enough, but I had to bake for 35 minutes total to get any brown bottoms and for them to cook through.  Otherwise, easy and lovely scones.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! Just one problem, which I guess is just me, but I always have to bake them for about twice the time indicated to get the nicely browned.  I like them with orange zest and dried cranberries.  I've tried it as instructed and substituting yogurt and 1 tsp of baking soda for the sour cream. Tips: use frozen butter and grate it into the dry ingredients, mixing occasionally.  Also, divide dough in half and flatten into a large puck the thickness suggested.  Place into two greased/floured pie pans and cut like a pizza (without cutting all the way through the dough).  Bake and break up into pieces.  Both tips will help prevent over mixing, keeping the scones light.

Of all the scones I baked myself, these are the best. I divided the dough in half and added chocolate chips to one half and left the other plain bec my husband likes it plain.  cut up some strawberries and sprinkle sugar on them and set in the fridge.  when you are ready for dessert, add the strawberries on top of a plain scone and then top that off with cool whip or vanilla icecream.  so good to use this recipe for strawberry shortcake.

These are the best scones I've ever had! I made them for my three roommates and in one day they were all gone! I made two kinds - raspberry with white chocolate chips and lemon poppyseed; they were both really delicious! Honestly delicious, no changes need to be made to this recipe (I even made some plain ones, just to see).

So tasty! I didn't have sour cream so I used plain yogurt. I added pumpkin to half and bluberries & orange zest to the other. Brushed them with milk and sprinkled them with raw sugar and wheat germ. My 3 year old nephew ate two! I froze half of them before they were baked and they are just as amazing 3 weeks later. Thanks for the great recipe!

A friend who lived in Wales for a year said these scones are as good as any you would find in a Wales bakery.  I subbed Splenda for 1/2 of the sugar, used 1.5 c wheat flour, dried cranberries, white choc chips and walnuts and drizzled half of them w/powdered sugar icing after baking.  Soaking the berries in hot water before adding to the mix makes them plump up and they don't suck the moisture out of the dough.  Also, grate cold butter just before cutting into the flour mixture - makes mixing very easy.

These were great....light and fluffly!  I used fat free sour cream, splenda, and chocolate chips instead of raisins.

I love scones and this was a great, easy recipe.  I substituted frozen blueberries for the raisins and they still tasted awesome!  I did prefer them fresh and will definately freeze them like the other reviews suggested next time.  They cooked closer to 20 minutes.  I made half the recipe and it made 8 large scones, prefect amount for our small family.

My family absolutely raved about these! I made the recipe exactly as listed with raisins but also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Half way through baking time, I sprinkled cinnamon /sugar on top. I'm looking forward to trying this with other variations. Thank you!

My first and still favorite scone recipe.  I was pleasantly surprised by the moistness that is lacking in many scones.  I normally add blueberries instead of raisins but don't overwork them or you'll end up with blue scones.  :-)  Still will taste great though.  I normally make it into a long rectangle and cut triangles out instead of forming a round dough.  It seemed easier to get uniform sizes giving the sticky consistency of the dough.  I like to add a simple icing of powdered sugar and milk before serving.  This is probably the recipe I get the most raves about.

I'm jumping on the bandwagon with two thumbs up.  I've cut this in 12 wedges and frozen them individually (separate with waxed paper) so I can just pop one or two into the oven for a Sunday morning coffee with my DH.  Given as teacher "thank you" gifts to rave reviews!  Endless variations of additions besides those mentioned --- lime zest is fun, as is a cranberry/mini choc chip combo.  Melt in your mouth!

This was a very good recipe.  I followed the suggestions of a few reviewers and they came out perfectly.  I cut the recipe in half and came out with six good sized scones.  I added lemon zest to the dough and glazed with a lemon glaze.  they are wonderful!

I followed the recipe exactly except for the raisins-added chocolate chips instead. Made them once without cream of tartar (didn't have any) and didn't miss it. I now usually add some vanilla extract but this is an excellent recipe just as is! The key is to handle the dough as little as possible and to have the butter very cold. Our guests loved it! It tastes like a chocolate chip cookie...almost. My complaint is that it isn't really fluffy, it's actually pretty dense.

Excellent recipe!  Moist & tender! I followed other viewers suggestions and added the additional 1/2 cup of sugar which I am glad I did.  I also didn't realize just how much these spread.  I made six HUGE chocolate chip scones.  Had to bake them a bit longer but it was well worth it!  Next time I plan on trying some different variations, such as blueberries, raisins, cranberries

Delicious!! Need I say more! I did cut down the sugar a bit but they were still terrific. The only problem I had was they did not hold their shape in the oven but I may have made them too thick so I think it was my fault! Didn't really care what they looked like because they were sooo good. Thanks for the great recipe!

These were awesome!  Insead of raisins, I added fresh raspberries and white chocolate chunks, as well as drizzling a powdered sugar, milk and vanilla glaze on top.  Will definitely make again.  Oh, and I made these at 7,700 ft. elevation while at a family reunion, and don't usually have good luck baking at that elevation and they turned out awesome!  Very pleased.  :)

incredible!  i followed the directions almost to the letter however, i added the blueberries as another person suggested.  because blueberries can "bleed", i froze them first so that when they were added, they did not bleed.  i also took another suggestion and added sprinkled sugar before i put them into the oven.  can't wait to try other add-ins.  thank you grandma johnson!

These scones are delicious, and I love that you can freeze them and then pop them in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes to have fresh scones any time!  Per other reviews, I modified the recipe a bit by decreasing the salt to 1/2 tsp (because I used salted butter), decreasing the sugar to 3/4 cup, using half white flour and half white whole wheat flour, omitting the raisins, dividing the recipe in half, adding 1/2 cup cherries and 1/2 tsp almond extract to one half, 1/2 cup currants and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the other half, brushing all scones with milk and sprinkling with cinnamon/sugar mixture, and topping the cherry almond scones with sliced almonds.  I can't wait to try out other flavors as well!

I know this recipe doesn't need another review, but I just had to give credit where it was due.  These are the single best plain scones I have ever baked or eaten, bar none.  I left out the raisins, and made them for a tea, and everyone thought they were so good.  They are light and just faintly sweet, so you can use devonshire cream, jam or lemon curd on them.  My son used the leftover scones with strawberries and homemade whipped cream for strawberry shortcakes, and they were incredibly good that way, too!  We will be making these again and again.

I have never had much luck in the scone-making department, but this recipe is absolutely amazing!  They are moist and delicious.  I added dried cranberries and orange zest to the mix and drizzled them with a glaze icing made from powdered sugar and orange juice concentrate.  When my 18 yr, old daughter tasted one, she said she thought she was at Starbucks.

Wow!!!  The variations that we love the best are using pumpkin instead of sour cream and adding white chocolate chips, or, using dried cherries or dried blueberries with white chocolate chips.  These are awesome!!

This was our first try at making scones- and guess what, we thought these scones were awsome! We made a few mistakes along the way... but now we now how to make the scones just fine. We made a few changes: we put in choc. chips instead of raisins because we are not big fans of them in scones.  Hope this review helped you! - Emma & Sierra

I can hardly believe how good these are!  This recipe definitely 16 instead of 12, but if youe want HUGE scones - make 12!  I added 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 cup chopped pecans, then eggwashed the top and sprinkled cinnamon/sugar.  So good!

amazing, simple.  Kids and husband loved them.  I didn't have sour cream on hand, so I used vanilla lowfat yogurt, worked the same with the baking soda.  I pressed out dough then pressed in frozen berries, cut triangles from square/rectangle.  Baked convection at 350 for 15 minutes, won't buy scones again, can't wait to try raspberry...

These scones are light and tender. They rise so much that they overflowed my Nordicware scone pan. I added a 1/2 tsp of dried lemon peel and 1/4 tsp of lemon extract. They were perfect.

Great, easy recipe! Some of the other reviews say there is a problem with dryness, but in my experience the proportions were perfect. I froze the butter and grated it to make the cutting in process easier. I cracked the egg in a separate bowl from the sour cream, and added a teaspoon of vanilla. I also mixed in a frozen berry medley-delicious, classic flavor!

I made these for a baby shower tea party and they could not have been more perfect for the occasion!  I can't believe I've never made these before, I love them!  I omitted the raisins, and made 3 versions:  chocolate chips, dried cranberry with vanilla extract, and orange juice.  For each scone, I scooped about an ice cream scooper-size onto the cookie sheet instead of cutting (I prefer the random look, and the crispy edges that are achieved this way).  Delicious and perfect with a cup of tea.

First let me say I have never had a scone before, I've only seen them.  ;)  I LOVE these.  I didn't make any changes, but I did separate into to batches and added raisins in one and milk choc chips in the other.  I liked the raisins best but my kids, of course, liked the choc chips better.  When adding the sour crm mx & egg into the flour it was VERY dry...so dry I thought I left something out.  BUT, when I took it out of the bowl (after adding the raisins/choc chips to the mix) and kneaded it by hand it moistened up. I got more than 12 servings from mine.  Oh, I also used half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  My brother said they were BETTER than scones you buy at the store!!  I will keep this recipe and make them again and again!  THANK YOU!!

These are AWESOME!  I followed the recipe as written, but added 2/3 bag of mini chocolate chips to the mix.  I divided the dough into two rounds, yielding six perfect scones each.  I also brushed the tops of the scones with heavy cream before baking, then made a chocolate drizzle with the remaining chips and 1 T. shortening, and drizzled the heck out of them when they had cooled a bit.  I did end up baking for an additional 8 minutes, but these were TO DIE FOR...perfectly crispy outside, tender and delicate inside.  Beautiful!

I halved the recipe and ended up with 8 triangular scones. They were very soft on the inside with just enough crunch on the outside. I added a tsp. of pure vanilla extract. I will probably use this as the biscuits for strawberry shortcake (w/o dried fruit or nuts).

This seriously is the best scone recipe I've ever made.  I added dried cran-cherries and a teaspoon of vanilla (I would have added almond extract if I'd had any).  Before baking, I did a milk wash and sprinkled them with sugar.  And I divided the dough in two and made two discs.  One would have been too huge!  I know this recipes is a winner because my husband, who detests scones because they're usually dry and bland, loved these.    Serve them with the Easy Devonshire Cream from this site and you'll have a tea party to remember!

This is the first time I've ever made scones.  I needed something to take to work for an early meeting and had everything on hand for these.  I replaced the raisins with craisins and sliced almonds, added a couple drops of almond extract, and sprinkled course sugar on top before baking.  These were gone within 30 minutes!!!  I got compliments all day long and many asked when I was going to bring them again.  What a great recipe!!!!!  A definite keeper and I'm sure I'll make them many times over.

These were absolutely fabulous!!  My husband and I enjoy our tea a lot, and ate an entire batch of scones w/ our tea in a matter of 3 days (had to add a few extra workouts)!  Brings us back to the days we lived in England....thank you Grandma Johnson!

These had great flavor and great texture! Definitely don't take these out of the oven before they have a golden brown crust around the edge. I took my first batch out before that point and they were doughy. I had to throw out my first batch. I also recommend beating the egg before mixing with dry ingredients just to ensure it blends well.

I've made these several times now and they're always fantastic. They are much better eaten the first day though. I like to drizzle a little glaze made with lemon juice and powdered sugar. Sprinkle lemon zest on the glaze and you'll wow your guests.

These were really great.  Moist and yummy.  I took the advice of a few others and added in a little extra sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla.  And omitted the raisins since my family doesn't like them.  Next time I'll add cinnamon chips for a little extra.

Yum! I use nonfat plain yogurt instead of sour cream, to lighten it, and this works wonderfully. My favorite addition is fresh blueberries. Beware: the recipe does make a ton of scones, so you might want to half it.

I loved this recipe!  You can use this as the "basic" dough - and add whatever you want to make it even better!  I used dried cranberries with orange zest...then made my glaze with orange juice and powdered sugar.  These turned out wonderful and very addictive!!

I followed the recipe except left out the raisins and added cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger, orange extract, and orange zest.  I served them with the Devonshire Cream recipe as suggested by another reviewer.  Everyone at worked loved them and couldn't believe I never made scones before.  My 8 year old loved them too!

This is GOOOD!  I have made this so many times since I found this recipe.  Everytime someone taste it for the first time, they request for more or ask for the recipe.  I add walnuts to the recipe for a more fragant and nutty flavour.

For those who find it too wet (they are), I don't roll them out at all.  I just use an ice-cream scoop and it yields about 31 scones.  The scones are really creamy!  Thank you Rob for kindly sharing your recipe with us!

This is a great base recipe for scones - I made a couple changes my second time making them and added lemon juice, almond extract, and poppy seeds instead of raisins. I also made a lemony sugary glaze for the top and they were soooo good. :)

I made these last week for the first time - the dough was relatively wet and I had to incorporate a lot of flour in while kneading.  They spread quite a bit in the oven and didn't have the dense scone texture I was looking for.

I just made them again 20 minutes ago, but this time I changed the way I measured the flour.  Normally I spoon flour into the measuring cup and sweep it off, but this time I dug down into the densely-packed flour of a new bag.  Made all the difference in the world.  The dough came together perfectly, was easy to pat out and cut and baked out more upright.

Their the best !  I have a few suggestions:  I used Splenda instead of sugar.  I used 2 cups whole weat flour, 1 cup all purpose white flour and 1 cup oatmeal.  My 3 yrs old twins will only eat that at breakfast !  I am cooking this recipe every week...

Wonderful recipe!! I altered the recipe to make Java Chocolate Chip Scones! Omit the raisins and instead add 2 packages of dry hot chocolate mix and 2 TBSP. ground espresso in with the dry ingredients. Then fold in 1.5 cups (more or less to taste) of dark chocolate chips. They are amazing with your morning coffee!

I wanted to make my dad a batch of scones for his birthday. I didn't have a lot of time to research a recipe and just assumed that since this recipe had 800+ 5 star reviews, I could trust it.
Not only was it a fabulous recipe, but it was so.... easy.
I doubled the recipe and made one regular batch and one cranberry-orange batch. I just added some orange zest and about a cup of craisins. Fabulous!! 
This recipe is going into the family file right now!!!

I thought I must have measured out too much flour because these turned out WAY too dry and cru,bly to even roll out onto the counter top. I had to add several tablespoons of milk JUST to get it wet rnought to all blend together. As I recall I added the right amount of flour. Am I the only one who didn't think this worked out well?
#2 I tried these again and mixed them in the mixer after i cut in the butter with a pastry blender. The mixer mixed it better and I didn't have to add extra milk and they were plenty moist. I also divided the dough into two portions and rolled out each into a cirle and cut into triangles so they would be smaller. They turnedout great!

Just absurdly good. Put some apple butter on them and you'll nearly pass out from the deliciousness overload.

I *LOVE* this recipe! As it is, it's pretty basic... I don't think I've ever actually done it with raisins. But I've used pineapple/cranberry, lemon, cinnamon & apple, etc... and just finished making them with pumpkin pie filling and cinnamon / nutmeg, and topping with a simple powdered sugar/mike/vanilla frosting! It's very versatile, use your imagination. I'm sure a large part of the tastiness (as one reviewer pointed out) is the cup of butter that you cut into this recipe, but it's well worth trying and sharing with friends. Amazing :)

Delicious! I halved the recipe & had 6 really good sized scones. I used Craisins which might have added too much sweetness. Next time I will try raisins. These have a wonderful flavor (probably because they use so much butter)!

A recipe doesn't get almost 800 5-star reviews unless it's exceptional, but I have to say I was bowled over by how good thses are!  Light and fluffy, moist, and crisp on the outside.  The only thing I did differently was brush the tops with cream and sprinkle them with a little sugar.  These are outstanding and I'm sure I'll make them again.  Great recipe!

These scones were a huge hit! I added the zest of one lemon and a cup of dried blueberries for flavor, but kept the recipe the same otherwise. It took my oven 13.5 minutes to reach scone perfection, and they're delicious hot out of the oven AND the next morning. Next time I make these [and there WILL be a next time - and many more!] I'll be shaping the dough into a long "log" and slicing that into smaller pieces, as I found the scones cut from a round, pizza-pie-style, were very large and half of that size would be plenty for a single serving. FANTASTIC recipe overall - I can't wait to make them again!

These scones are certainly a stand alone.  But with lemon curd, jam and clotted cream, they are just wonderful.  I did add the extra 1/2 cup sugar and soaked the craisins in o.j. before adding to the dough and added 1-2 tsps. vanilla to the beaten egg.  Unless you like very large servings, cut them into 24 pieces.  I baked for 20-30 minutes at 350. But whether large or small, hot or cold, with or without jam, these are truly delicious.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  I will be making these again and again.

With all the modifications I made, such as halving the sugar, adding vanilla and cinnamon, etc, I have to say it was yummy, but I sure don't want to try the original recipe if it took so much to make it good. These were really filling even though I made them a lot smaller. Kind of hard... and didn't bake properly... The dough was so dry, I had to add some milk to keep it together. I think I'd use 1.5x more liquid. Plus, this recipe would make some really huge scones if you follow the amount it says it makes.... Not making this again.

I didn't want to roll them out, so I patted them to the 3/4 inches and put them in muffin tins. I also added the extra sugar, vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon recommended by others. Turned out great - very moist and delicious recipe.

These are fab.  Just made them for the first time.  Only change was craisins and white choc. instead of raisins.  After trying can see how some might prefer more sugar but it's not necessary. I will make again!

Very Nice. Everyone really enjoyed these. However, I may have done something wrong (I think it was the fact that I added semi-melted butter instead of just "softened" butter)...because my "dough" was nothing dough like! It was very sticky and wet...what a mess! And the scones didn't poof up as much as they probably should've....will try again though.

I made these this weekend.  I added vanilla, some cinnamond and about 1/4 c of sugar.  I also split the dough into three batches and made raisin out of one, cranberry/hazlenut with another, and dried mixed berries with the third.  They were a huge hit.  I didn't have any, but the rest of the family and my sister in law, who I took some to, loved them.  I'll be making these again!

Wow! These scones are awesome! My first time to make scones and they were a big hit at our bible study. I added 1tsp of cinnamon & 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and a little vanilla. The recipe said that this makes 12 scones, so I divided the dough into 12 balls. Then shaped each ball into a triangle. They came out huge, so once they were out of the oven I cut them in half, which was perfect. I used rasins for 1/2 of the dough. I added chocolate chip to a couple of scones, and fresh blackberries to a few (I cut the blackberries into smaller pieces because they were large). If adding fresh fruit to your scones, I would recommend shaping your dough into a square, then put the fresh fruit into 1/2 side, then fold the other half over the fruit into a triangle shape. That way you won't smash the berries too much. It took several extra minutes baking time. This is a keeper:-)

The best scones ever.  Used dried blueberries instead of the raisins.  I've also used a thumbprint of jam instead of dried fruit.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

This is a very tasty recipe. The consistency is a bit lighter than traditional scones, but I personally like that. The only changes I made were to use fresh, frozen cranberries instead of raisins, and I brushed the tops with milk and sprinkled with sugar before baking. My only comments are that these should be cut up into more than 12 wedges unless you like huge scones. If you want something you can cut in half to spread jam, etc. on, I would recommend using a round cookie cutter instead. Also, because I cut mine into 12 large wedges as specified, it took much longer than 15 minutes for them to bake.

Thanks for this recipe! My 6 year old daughter and I enjoyed making together.

I followed the recipe exactly and the scones came out with a very nice flavor. A little sweet, but not too sweet. Would be perfect with some jam or powdered sugar. The texture was similar to that of a homemade biscuit. Very light and fluffy. Something had to have gone wrong though, because the bottoms of the scones were a beautiful golden brown, while some of the centers were a little undone and gooey. I think I should have cooked them a little longer perhaps. Still, this is a good recipe and I think I will try it again with fruit.

I would give this one 10 stars if I could.  I use cinnamon chips and only bake what I will use right away.  The rest go in the freezer for fresh-baked scones all the time!

I've been searching for ages for a great scone recipe; I've tried many on this sight but all seemed rather tasteless.  These, however, are fabulous! I cannot figure out just what it is..perhaps it is the sour cream & cream of tartar. I added pecans and topped with just a bit of maple flavored powered sugar icing.  Also baked at 400 degrees for first 5 minutes then turned it down to 350 to get crispness on outside with softness inside.  But even without these minor changes the is a super recipe....Thank you Grandma!

I love scones and I was looking for a delicious easy recipe and I found it!
These are sooo good that you don't even need to put anything on top of them. You can eat them plain as a quick treat with a cup of tea or coffee.
But, on the other hand, they also go great with a variety of toppings. You could use frosting, cream, fruit, jam, butter, basically whatever you wanted to use. It is extremely versatile.
I often make up a big batch of these as they go quick in my house! My kids love them. I pack a few in their lunchboxes for snacks at school.
Please thank Grandma Johnson for me. I will be using this recipe over and over again!

These were very moist scones. The dough was a little tough for me to work with, because I was worried about letting it get too warm. But despite my early problems, they turned out fabulous. I made a lemon zest flavor with a lemon glaze drizzle, and I made one with orange juice soaked crasins and white chocolate chips. I used a orange glaze drizzle on the second flavor. The lemon flavor was the most popular. I will make these again, probably trying new flavors each time.

While scones are often apt to be bland and dry, this recipe was simply so excellent that theses were irresistably delicious! The flavoring was superb, buttery and sweet, yet subdued, as fitting to a good scone.

I made the recipe as stated, split the batter and made 1/2 the batch w/ mini chocolate chips and 1/2 with Peanut butter chips(Honestly the Choc. Chips ones disappeared WAY faster than the PB ones!) If you have kids or you love s'mores, try adding in cut up mini marshmallows, chocolate chips and small pieces of graham crackers- YUMMY! Don't forget to not play with the dough too much!...had to come back to add this in: I made some last night with a mix of frozen berries, and made a glaze with confectioners sugar and Cruzan mango rum- SO GOOD! I also made a paste with cinnamon, sugar and melted butter, pressed the dough out thin and ten spread the paste over the dough. I then folded the edges in to form it into the circle to cut the slices. I made a glaze for those w/ milk and conf. sugar. They were perfect! a great replacement for cinnamon rolls :)

I LOVE SCONES. I have eaten scones from MANY bakeries and have tried several recipes.  This recipe simply makes the best scones I have ever tasted!  Instead of raisins, I have tried adding chocolate chips, raspberries, or blueberries.  All are great!  I highly recommend this recipe!

These are beyond amazing. I used fat free sour cream and splenda. The mixture seemed a little dry but worked out in the end. I added craisins and sliced almonds and they came out gorgeous and are delicious. You don't even need to eat them with butter they are not dry at all and still have plenty of flavour. Will definitely bake these often!

I bake a lot and this was by far the best thing that I have ever baked.  We used the left overs that night to make strawberry shortcakes!  Yummy.

I added extra sugar (brown sugar) and vanilla to the recipe based on other reviewers' comments.  Omitted the raisins altogether (not a big fan); divided the dough in half and made 1/2 with just cinnamon & sugar sprinkled on top, and the other 1/2 with a cup of frozen wild blueberries.  Had to bake my scones a lot longer than the 12-15 minutes suggested in the recipe, but they tasted great.  I'm not a big fan of sweets nor of scones, but DH is; so I mostly made them for him, and I gulped down TWO! :-O  Served with homemade strawberry freezer jam and "Easy Devonshire Cream" (from this website).  Tasted SO-O-O-O good with those additions.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe with us, Rob!

These were DELICIOUS! I did what the other members suggested and added a extra 1/2 sugar, but other than that, perfect. Also, I added the zest and juice of one lemon along with 2 tablespoon of poppy seeds for lemon poppy seed scones. A delicious recipe worth tryng.

Yummy!  I actually made a few impromtu tweaks because *somebody* in my household used up all the sugar and forgot to buy more.  So, in a pinch I used 2/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup maple syrup instead of the sugar.  I also used walnuts instead of raisins because I thought they would go better with the maple & brown sugar.  And I was right, because these came out phenomenal!

In terms of the original recipe, it was super easy to follow.  The texture came out fantastic as well.

Unbelievable!!! This is the only scone recipe I will EVER need. I have made these over and over, using different fruits like dried cranberries, apricots & grated orange & lemon rind. I have also patted out the dough & used a flower shaped cookie cutter to make extra special looking scones. No matter what, this recipe turns out perfect & delicious every time!!!

These were wonderful.  Slightly crunchy but light and fluffy inside with a hint of sweetness.  I made these plain and served them with butter and jam, halved strawberries and whipped cream, and half the batch was with choco chips.  Hubby was sooo happy! Half a batch was more than enough for the two of us--as you can see, I did plenty with them!

I'm a bit confused- I hadn't tried oven baked sweet scones before.  These remind me of a puffy cookie without enough sugar.  The recipe calls for enough sugar to make  you think you're getting a sweet treat but it's not quite sweet enough.

excellent, I did make a few subsitutions, used whole wheat flour instead of white and used buttermilk instead of sour cream, as it was what I had on hand and they still came out wonderful.  Will definitely make again using different variations, chocolate chips, blueberries, cranberries, etc.  THANKS.

This recipe makes a tender and tasty basic scone. There is an infinite number of flavors that can be created from this one recipe. Try adding a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the dough, then brush with milk and top with cinnamon and demara sugar before baking.
Add some orange extract to the batter, brush with milk and top with orange zest and demara sugar before baking. These can be frozen before baking, as well.Thanks for sharing Grandma's recipe, Rob!

OMG, these were so good! I baked these for a baby shower's prizes with choco chips/raisins and white choco chips/dried cranberries. My sister fortunately was the one who got them and asked me to bake more because everyone in her house wants them! Definitely a keeper!!!

These were great...and easy!  My 11yo dd did most of the prep work, I just put them together.  We ran out of cream of tartar so I followed others suggestions and used 3/4tsp vinegar instead.  We also added about 1 TBSP of cinnamon to the flour mixture.  They were great!  We can't wait to try all sorts of combinations.  I never thought sconces would be so easy to make...and so much better than the ones I buy at the expensive coffee shops!

I made these for Christmas breakfast and they were fantastic!! I am going to make them again today so I can have them around for breakfast and tea. I like the soft texture. I did not use cream of tartar (couldn't find it) so I  substitute baking soda and powder for it. I made some plain ones and some with raisins. They are great just plain with butter or jam. I have never had a scone this good. The ones you buy in the coffee shops and supermarket are usually hard and taste like dust. Way to go, Grandma Johnson!

My husband owns a coffee house and makes all his own baked goods.  This is the recipe he uses and people just rave about his scones - he sells out daily no matter how many he makes!  I can even make them when needed and I'm not a great baker.

The best scone recipe ever! I always alter it by adding things to it like dried fruit and nuts.I even create glazes for this recipe. My last alteration included chopped dried fruit with roasted crushed macadamia nuts,lemon zest and added a lemon glaze on top-The best alteration by far. Now they(family)just cant get enough of them

My next door neighbor is an excellent cook.  My gift of scones using this recipe brought raves from her husband and herself: they were better than the ones they loved while in Scotland.  This recipe is everything you would ever want it to be.  5stars for sure...twice!

These were super crumbly for me, but I had used whole wheat flour. We just didn't knead it, but smushed the dough together like big cookies, cooked them, and they turned out DELICIOUS.
***
2 years later and we make these every Christmas morning.  If you use white flour and add 1 tsp vanilla, they will turn out perfectly.  We stir in 1 c. dried cherries. Mmmm....

This is a good recipe. I added frozen raspberries instead of the raisin and added a little more flour and it turned out great. I'll be trying it with all kinds of different things.

Easy but delicious!! I made it for an English tea party and even the most picky guest love it. All the girls in the party asked for the recipe. I used apricot yoghurt instead of sour cream and I will suggest reduce the amount of sugar if you want to have them with jam.

These are great! I wanted to make a scone-mix-in-a-jar to give as gifts this year, and didn't find one I liked.  So I tried this one!  I was worried about not being able to make the sour cream mixture (since the baking soda would already be mixed in the jar) and how that would effect the recipe.  I just mixed in the dry ingredients, added the wet, and they still came out fantastic! Since I was experimenting, I only made half a recipe.  I left out the raisins and added a generous tablespoon of cinnamon to compliment the apple butter we are also giving.  I highly reccommend using cinnamon! So tastey!!

Wow...these are lovely.  I used whole wheat pastry flour and dried cherries.  I find most scones too dry, but these are moist and flavorful.  I'm about to take them to a holiday party and I'm sure they'll disappear quickly.  This will be a new basic recipe for me.

Very good!  I just have trouble getting them to a size I like. They raise and spread a lot during baking, but the taste is excellent. These are very good the next few days after baking also, if they last that long! Enjoy

These are just beyond-words fabulous. I omitted the raisins, added 1 tsp. fresh lemon zest, and sprinkled the tops with coarse white sugar before baking. Everyone thought I had purchased them from a bakery. Wonderful recipe!

These are dangerous! So good I could eat them all. I was only going to sample a small piece of one to see how they came out but it was so yummy I had to eat the whole scone. I followed other reviewers advice and put in dried cranberries and white chocolate chips. I will be making these again!I used another tip I found here and that was to use the vinegar substitute for the cream of tarter so i did not have to buy that.Very delicious. This recipe is a keeper.

Snaps for Rob! What a wonderful recipe. I made chocolate chip and craisin white chocolate chip. FYI 1/4 teaspoon cr. of tartar = 3/4 teaspoon vinegar. These are very easy to make and you could add just about anything. It's a large recipe I had 15 and they weren't small. So good right out of the oven. A definite keeper!!!

These were so easy and wonderful!  I added craisins, 1/2 tsp. orange oil and a little milk (to moisten them up a little).  I made two disks, cut them in wedges,and brushed them with egg wash.  Mine took longer to bake--it may be my oven.  The dough keeps well.  I made one disk immediately and one a week later.  They were still excellent!  Nice to know you can make them ahead.

fabulous.  divided dough into three sections and added grated old cheddar cheese to one (delish) and raisins to the second batch and then finally white chocolate chips with dried cranberries to the third...the best.  Yummo!

Have made two batches and this recipe is so easy, simple, successful... amazing! I used whole milk (plain) yogurt for the sour cream both times and it worked beautifully. 

Subbed mixed dried berries for the raisins.

I wish I could give this more than just 5 stars.  I made two batches for my husband to take to work and they were gone in seconds.  The first batch was with raisins, the second with dried cranberries and white chocolate chips like one reviewer recommended.  Both were excellent.  I added about a tablespoon of water to the dough to make it more workable.  Awesome!!!!

Delicious, easy recipe. I made these this morning with my 2 & 4 year olds. We all had a good time making them, but an even better time eating them! 
We made them with chocolate chips, and ate them with some jam. YUM!

This was my first attempt at making scones. I made half plain & half white chocolate, cranberry & almond. I liked the plain ones more but have plans to try some lemon/blueberry ones next. They turned out more like a sweet biscuit than what I think of as a scone (dry, crumbly) but I definitely like these better! They're very moist but I think they're a tad too sweet for my taste. Next time I will cut the sugar a bit. Also, I have to say that I liked them better the next day for some reason.

I can't fault the flavor of these scones. They are tasty and RICH. However, although I followed the recipe to the letter, I had to add 1/4 cup of milk just to get the dough to come together. I also prefer scones that are not quite so sweet, and maybe even a little less rich. I think there's a lighter version of this recipe that I'll try next.

This is the best scone recipe I've ever used!  I like to split the dough into 3 equal parts before making additions so we end up with three flavors.  Chocolate chip is wonderful, so is almond poppyseed, and fresh cranberry!

Oh my gosh!!!  These are the best scones I have ever had.  I made them as the recipe called for except I used light sour cream.  They are even good the second day.  I dont like the dry and crumbly scones most recipes make but these are moist and simply amazing!!!   You have to try these!

I thought that this recipe seemed easy enough and it was easy to follow.  The outcome wasn't exactly as I had hoped.  I found the scones dry and a bit crumbly.  I was hoping they would taste like ones made at my local bakery that are moist and so soft.  It was fun making these with my 7 year old daughter!  She got to practice baking.

Excellent scone recipe!!!  Better than some store bought scones. I made them plain, and with chocolate chips.   Both are awesome.  They are so easy to make.  I usually lightly roll the dough out and use a heart-shaped cookie cutter to make small "cookies".

The taste alone is 5 stars!!! I made this recipe using 1/2 butter 1/2 shortning since I didn't have enough butter. I made half of this recipe with white choc. and dried cherries and it's unreal. I just took them out of the oven and eating it as I write this. They didn't puff up the way I wanted but I think I have over mixed it just a bit and it's a very sticky day out too. This recipe made 12 large scones. I did 2 circles and cut each into 6 pieces. I added vanilla to the sour cream mixture. Yummy....so good.

These were very good.  I added orange zest and orange flavored craisins.  I made the mistake of cutting these into 8 pieces instead of 12 and they didn't bake all the way through at first so I had to keep sticking them back in the oven til they were done.

soo good! i made them once according to the recipe, and it was great. then i made them again, substituting sour cream for NF plain yogurt and reducing butter and sugar. Turned out well, except i think i over-mixed since there was less liquid, but good nonetheless. good with frozen berries mixed in!! i love the fact that these scones are so good and don't require buttermilk or shortening (two items i never have on hand when i need them!)

Grandkids loved.  We baked it together.  We did omit the raisins.  Now instead of heading for the toy box they head for the kitchen and we now make them every Sat.  Thanks for the post.

These are quite tasty and very easy.  This recipe makes 12 huge scones, so if I make this again, I'd make 36 or 48 little scones instead.  I used mini chocolate chips instead of raisins.  Although I really liked these, it felt like something was missing.  Maybe I'll try adding vanilla extract and cinnamon like others have suggested.

Excellent! use shortenning instead of butter & plain low fat yogurt instead of sour cream & I love it all the way. I divide the dough into 4 portion and gets a lot of mini scones. While typing this review, I'm eating my fourth piece!

Delicious, delicious, delicious!  That is about the only word to describe these scones.  I have tried many recipes for scones and this is the easiest and best that I have ever have.  I like to serve it with double devonshire cream and it is heaven.

My first attempt at scones.  The dough was too crumbly to roll out - the butter may have been too cold (I grated frozen butter into the flour) - so I just scooped the dough out with my hands, molded it into a ball, and pressed it into a thick circle on the cookie sheet.  I used chocolate chips instead of raisins, and it turned out great!  Very buttery and crumbly, but moist.  I dipped pieces in melted vanilla ice cream - decadent!  Another reader had problems with the scones drying out the next day, but I stored mine in a plastic bag and they were fine.

I "do" tea parties and have been searching for the "perfect" scone. Even travelled to King Arthur Flour in Vermont and tried a dozen of their mixes. Grandma Johnson's are the best scones I have ever made or even tasted!

YUM!  I used craisins and white chococolate chips and they were excellent!!  Will definitely use this recipe again and try different variations. I had to double my baking time, I assume because of high altitude though that has never affected my recipes before.

Delicious.   What a great recipe.   I don't have a good track record with baking and this turned out perfect.   Don't let the crumbly texture after you have added the sour cream mixture to the dry ingredients scare you.   I just pressed it together a bit before turning it out on the counter and then kneeded it as the recipe instructs.    We served them warm with butter. They took approximately 20 mins to brown in my oven.   We put the leftovers in an airtight container and they tasted great the next day.

WOW! These are absolutely, by FAR, THE best scones I’ve ever made! The author (Rob) hit it right on the head when he said “Simply the best anywhere!”.  Soooo simply and delicious ~ even my 5-1/2 year old ate them (three, right out of the oven!).  I’ve always had trouble with scones getting too dark on the bottom, before the rest of the scone was baked through, so I was a bit skeptical to make them ¾” thick.  I opted to make them about ½” thick instead.  I ended up with 19 scones (nothing wrong with that!) and baking them for less time (about 8-9 minutes).  I used the dark, non-stick cookie sheets (greased).  I, too, had a bit of trouble getting the dough to stay together upon mixing..so I added a bit more flour and it was fine.  Can’t I give these tasty treats a ten star rating?

Wonderful! I was a little short on sour cream, about 1/4 a cups worth, so I used milk to finish it off. Be sure to take the scones out once the bottoms ONLY are golden brown. The tops may not look done, but they will be once they cool.

These were my first scones so I don't have anything to compare them to.  I wasn't swept off my feet, but I'm still giving them 5 stars because I don't want to mess with the masses.  :)  They were moist and yummie - made half plain and half with fresh blueberries (a bit of hard time folding the blueberries in).  I found they were sweet enough and don't really understand why some reviewers add extra sugar...

Lovely easy recipe. I use drop style scones on a parchment lined cookie sheet.For a special tea time treat Instead of raisins I often use my favorite tart dried cherries and drizzle the tops of the finished scones with almond flavored confectioner sugar glaze. The parchment paper keeps things nice and neat.  This paper can be found by the tin foil section in your grocer.

Not too bad.  I added 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  Dough was difficult to knead at first--very crumbly.  Turned out fine and tasty.  One was enough as they are rich in taste.

Absolute perfection. This is now my new scone recipe. These scones are so moist and cake-like. I was amazed to find that they were just as moist on the second day as they were on the first. I sprinkle extra sugar on the tops before baking and serve with the mock devonshire cream also found here. This is definately a keeper, thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

This was my first attempt at scones.  I'm giving it a five because my family just loved them.  I did change the recipe a bit so the rating may be a bit unfair???  I only had about 1/3 c. lite sour cream so I used that with plain lowfat yogart.  I also added frozen blueberries...kind of an ugly mistake.  The flavor was good and moist but they were bluish gray due to the thick dough and the mixing in of the berries.  Next time I'll try mixing in chocolate chips because I think that will go over better than the raisins.  I had to bake them 10 minutes longer probably because of the berries and they spread out on the pan...also probably because of the berries.  The dough is just too thick to mix in any kind of fresh fruit and I didn't realise that until it was too late.

Loved this!  Never made scones and this was so easy.  I added cranberries and a little milk.  I also dropped them by the spoonful on the baking sheet rather than rolling out. GREAT.

The scones were very good...I rolled out three layers and put butter, cinnamon, walnuts and brown sugar in between. If you decide to do this, make sure you roll your layers thin enough and cut the scones into individual pieces. I also used yogurt instead of the sour cream, which turned out fine.

I have made this recipe 4 time now. In my home I have to make 6 with craisins and 6 with chocolate chips! I got in a hurry tonight and added the cream of tartar to the dry mixture and caught my mistake too late. So after pondering what to do I added only 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar to the sour cream. Cooked for 20 minutes and WOW they came out wonderful. Raised higher than ever before! Same great taste and texture, just higher! So happy that this recipe was so forgiving of my haste!

Amazing scones!  I only had half the sour cream and didn't have cream of tartar.  This recipe is so forgiving.  The scones wer great anyway!  Must try.

I made these just as described and they came out perfectly! They're so good...not too sweet, not too plain. And I paired them with the Microwave Lemon Curd recipe found her and that was heavenly. Served them both at a tea baby shower and they got rave reviews! Thanks!

WONDERFUL!  Took a chance and made for the in-laws (without testing it first) and it was a beautiful hit!  Since then, I've made it once more for my husband and me but divided the dough before adding the fruit....then I added some blueberries to one half of the dough and apples and cinnamon to the other half.  Caution - the apples added a BUNCH of liquid to the dough so they took a little longer to bake, but they tasted great - in fact, my husband ate those up before he ate up all the blueberry ones!

I've made this recipe 4 times since discovering it a week and a half ago. They are awesome!! I keep them in a ziplock bag and reheat them in the toaster and they taste like they came straight out of the oven!! I do add about 1/4 cup more of the sugar and chocolate chips!! This is a keeper!!!

Yummy!!!  These were so good.  I used 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup.  I also mixed 1 ts. vanilla into the sour cream and added dried cranberries instead of raisins.  A great keeper recipe.  Thanks

This was an excellent recipe.  I made the scones plain, I only sprinkled with sugar.  I presented these in gift baskets with jam for Christmas.  I had many compliments and requests for this recipe.  I will definitely make again!

I don't know WHAT I could have done wrong.  I usually "snicker" at those who can't get a 5-star recipe right, but this time I AM ONE OF THOSE!  This was SO DRY!  I followed the recipe exactly and even used chilled butter as suggested and it was in crumbles!  I had to add 1/4 cup milk to get it to form a dough.  Then I made about 20 scones and it took over 25 minutes to cook the 1st batch.  They were pretty tasty, but not as good as I am sure if I succeeded with original recipe.  They weren't very pretty, either.  I might try them again, but it sure can be an expensive mistake to make more than once!

Very tasty and moist.  I left out the tartar, I didn't have any around. It was rather dry and crumbly, it made it difficult to mix in the fresh blueberries I used without squashing them.  Turned out nicely though!

Amazing -- I made them with Craisins -- wonderful piping hot from the oven and just as good the next moring for a quick breakfast.  I made the recipe exactly as written and they came out perfect.  Will become a staple.

I made these scones for a brunch and they were delicious.  I added mini choc chips and spinkled cinamon sugar over the top.  I cut about 20-22 triangles from this 12 serving recipe.  I rolled out the dough, cut stripes and then triangles with 3" sides.  Consider doing the same if these are to be served at a brunch or something becaue otherwise they are just too big. People want to sample a bit of this and a bit of that at a brunch- so it's better to make them smaller.  It was nice because it feeds a crowd.

i have never had scones or made them before this, so i don't have anything to compare them to. i will say they were good. i thought scones were more flakey like a biscuit, but these were more cake-like. that could be just how they are, like i said, i don't know, but it could also be my inexperience making them.

Excellent recipe - my friend and I baked 96+ for a tea we did, and received rave reviews, plus we sold all the extra ones.  Found the dough to be wonderful to work with - didn't roll it out, just patted it and cut into triangles.  Best scones we have tasted!

I have no idea what California girl is talking about. Everytime I make these scones I get rave reviews.  Kids absolutely love them and people are always asking for the recipe!  They are wonderful with fresh strawberries and the Easy Devonshire Cream recipe also found at this site.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

I've made these twice now.  My husband and kids can't get enough of them.  The second time, instead of cutting into wedges I used a biscuit cutter.  Then I just put the irregular shaped "leftover" pieces on the baking sheet and cooked them as is.  The kids got a kick out of the funny shapes.

Great versatile recipe. I use it to make cinnamon chip scones. Everybody that knows me wants these. Tip.  ALWAYS USE COLD BUTTER!!  Do not substitute the butter for anything else. Trust me. You want to follow the basic recipe. You won't be sorry. 
PS... USE ONLY REAL, COLD BUTTER.

My kids love scones and this is the perfect easy to make scone recipe. I only used 1 cup if sugar and it had the right sweetness for me. the texture and taste is amazing. Will be making these often.

These are the best scones ever!  I make the recipe as is.  My favorite thing to add is cranberries and slivered almonds.  People always ask for the recipe.

A wonderful recipe! I prefer my scones a little bit moist and I think the sour cream made them perfect. Other recipes I have made in the past always seemed too dry.mI added 1/2 - 3/4 cup of crasins plumped in water and a generous teaspoon of freshly grated orange zest and only 3/4 cup of sugar instead of the 1 cup called for. I like my scones smaller so I cut them to make about 40-45 per batch. Thank you Grandma Johnson.

I liked these scones. They tasted very similar to the ones I had at Fortnum & Mason in London England. I used a crimped edge circle cutter to make petite scones instead of large wedges for a cream tea service. I don't keep cream of tarter in my pantry so I just upped the baking powder. I did an egg wash for colour on the tops. They rose nicely and were flaky and tender inside. I'd make these again. A not sweet scone perfect to slather with preserves and devonshire cream! Mmm...

I have made this recipe several times.  I love taking one of these with me to the golf course.  Today I tried Lulu Mash’s suggestions.  I clearly enjoyed the flavour, moister scone.  I always use wild blueberries which are plentiful in Northern Ontario or New Brunswick.

We run a B&B.  Fresh pastries are a must every day.  I've made this recipe with lemon rind and blueberries; orange rind and cranberries; chopped fresh strawberries; chocolate chips.  I am sure I'm not remembering all the combinations; but it is limited only by your imagination.  Every time I serve them, the guests remark on these moist scones.  The best is I make them the night before and bake them the next morning for hot from the oven goodness.

I love this recipe!  I have made it many times and it is very versatile.  I usually omit raisins and include white chocolate chips and raspberries.  It becomes somewhat cakier with the extra moisture but they have become a family favorite!

I'm constantly making these per my 11, 7 y/o & husband's request.  It's a great basis for scones, sometimes I use chocolates that I have stored away & chop them up, sometimes I'll throw in some craisins w/ orange zest, I've even tried cooked diced applewood bacon & green onion. YUM!!!!

I tried this recipe when it first appeared on this site and I have had the greatest compliments. I made adjustments to the recipe using some of the reviews and it never failed. My son who was quite ill when I started making these could eat 4-5 scones a day when nothing else appealed to him. My favorite was the lemon juice and rind additions and only 1/2 cup sugar because I drizzled lemon juice and powdered sugar on the tops. Thank you for the best scones I have EVER tasted!

These are really full flavored scones that can be eaten plain. There's no need to add butter (there's alot in them already) or jam but you can. I added dried cranberries and 2 T orange juice. Very delicious! The scones are very tender with a light exterior crust. I will make these again for sure. They would be excellent used in strawberry shortcake, minus the raisins or cranberries.

I've made many scones over the years, and this is by far the best recipe. Note:  make sure you use real butter, handle the dough as lightly as possible and don't overbake.  Also, I "shred" the butter with a grater so that it's easier to work into the flour mixture.  Makes light, fabulous scones every time!

I'm giving this 5 stars if you follow the directions with a couple differences. I just now made this recipe pre-mixing the sour cream and baking soda, and also with butter that had been sitting out about 20 min -- big mistake!

Other times these have come out perfect, like THE BEST scone, flaky and incredible texture. Raves from everyone. This time, premixing the sour cream and with slightly less than fresh outta the fridge butter, they are... notably less good. As one other reviewer noted, "more like a muffin," alas.

Tips:
- KEEP THE BUTTER REALLY COLD
- DON'T PREMIX THE SOUR CREAM + BAKING SODA. Just mix dry things, then cut in butter, add sour cream and egg. It is VERY crumbly if you do it this way. I shape this recipe into two rounds, you really need to press it together but the butter will make them stick, but barely. Then cut into 6 triangles then cut each in half; I end up with 24 smaller triangles.

Add your extras after your mix, I use blueberries sometimes, or make cinnamon chips, or sometimes a "savory" verion by adding ham, cheddar, and green onion. They are ALL KILLER if you get that texture right!

Fantastic scone recipe.  I followed as written using cold butter and cutting it in.  Scones came out moist, but flakey.  Husband gave them an A+!  I did add 1 teaspoon of almond extract to the eggs before blending.  This is a great base recipe and I look forward to trying different flavor combos.

Wow. Just wow. I became more popular after I made this recipe! I didn't have any eggs, unfortunately, so I added milk until it reached the desired consistency. 3/4 cup sugar is plenty! It was really good! Moist... delicious... mmm...

Perfect. And I'm really fussy. I did everything exactly as followed with the exception of cutting the sugar back to 1/3 c. (Next time I think I'll use only 1/4 c. sugar, as I don't want super sweet anything for breakfast - but this is a personal taste question.) I am throwing out all other scone recipes I have (there are many). From now on, this'll be my base for any number of variations. I can also recommend using spelt BAKING flour on this one. Terrific. These have just the right density vs lightness. Congratulations, Rob and Grandma. Job well done - and much appreciated.

These are the best "like the store" scones I have found.  I was surprised to find that the next day they were even better.  I'm not sure if I rolled out the dough to thin, but I had almost 2 dozen various sized scones.  Delicious!

These scones are amazing.  They have the perfect amount of sweetness, and they melt in your mouth.  I added some white chocolate chips to change it up, and they were delicious.  I also use greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and in my opinion, it's even better.  This is the second time I make this recipe but definitely not the last because these scones are completely addictive.

I prepared this scones recipe today and they came fantastically! I did not have any cream of tartar, so I did not add any but the scones came out great. Highly recommended.  Thanks for sharing it!.

Oh my goodness! Melt-in-your-mouth amazing!! The only things I changed were to use less butter (because I didn't have enough) and less sugar (because I didn't want the scones to be overly sweet.  Turned out wonderful!

I made these tasty scones twice and the second time I used my food processor.  That made it so much easier!   As I dumped out the dough I added a cup of white chocolate chips and worked that into the dough.  Then I split the dough into fourths and formed each section into a six inch circle.   I then spooned raspberry jelly on one surface and then placed a second circle on top.   It was somewhat equal.  :)  I cut 8 pie-like wedge pieces then placed them on an air-bake cookie sheet.  (my other cookie sheet burned the bottom before the middle was done!). 
I repeated for the other two circles, making a total of 16 scones.   To make prettier, I drizzled white chocolate on the top.  They were fabulous.  
I gave them as gifts.

These scones are amazing! When I make them, everyone that eats them raves about them. I follow the recipe pretty close, except adding a teaspoon vanilla.  I also mix the baking soda in with the sour cream as suggested by one of the reviews. One review also suggested softening the butter and I would urge everyone to NOT do that unless you want flat scones.  The butter should be cold and cut into the flour just like most pastries. I use my food processor. Makes a huge difference in the outcome.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I never made scones before and these came out perfect! I made the recipe exactly as written excluding the raisins.  I was bringing them for dessert and wasn't sure how they would come out, so I divided the dough into 3rds.  I mixed 1/3 with some cinnamon & nutmeg, 1/3 with white chocolate chips and dried cranberries and left 1/3 plain.  Each portion I cut into 6 wedges which is smallish but I figured people could sample more than one, and each kind was delicious.  Also, I love Starbuck's scones and I thought these were just as good if not better!  Thank you for a fantastic recipe.

These scones turned out awesome. They were gone in a day and a half. I only had a 1/2 cup of sour cream, so I substituted the other 1/2 with plain home made yogurt (which is very sour!) and they turned out wonderfully. 
I think I like them better than the Allan Bros scones in Corvallis and that's saying a lot!

I made these for the first time today.  The flavor is delicious but they certainly were not baked after 15 minutes at 350 degrees.  I boosted the temp to 375 after 10 minutes and had to leave them in for an addiitonal 10 minutes until they were golden brown.  I hadn't read the suggestion to divide the dough into at least 2 parts but that certainly should be part of the recipe because these are too large when only 12 are made from the one round.
My caveat on these, and the reason for only 4 stars is that they are really too rich.  I think the butter could be reduced to 3/4 C.  They are so very soft they can't be sliced and they spread out so much they lost their shape.  Does anyone else have a suggestion for how to decrease the butter but still keep them buttery tasting?
I used currants instead of raisins.

I made a cinnamon version and a chocolate chip version.  Even though I LOVE chocolate, I prefer the cinnamon, but my coworkers perferred the chocolate chip.  The cinnamon contained cinnamon, nutmeg, and cinnamon chips.  I think I added vanilla to both batches.  I also found I liked forming the dough into a rectangle and cutting smaller pieces rather than the larger triangles.

These are the best scones I've ever had! They are light and buttery. They'd even be delicious plain. My first time making scones and followed the recipe almost exactly as written. The only change I made was to divide the dough in half and make part raisin and part cranberry.

This is my family's #1 favorite recipe.  Needless to say, I have made these scones countless times for home. They are also very, very popular with my coworkers! 

This recipe is delicious plain but also wonderful with additions of cinnamon/sugar, raisins, chocolate chips, dried cranberries, blueberries, and blackberries (I have tried all of these).  These scones are also FABULOUS with jam.  I should also add that these turned out wonderfully the first time I made them and have come out consistent every time since.  So thank you, Rob, for sharing this excellent recipe!

One thing to note: do not overwork this dough, it will cause the scones to become dry.

I made these scones with dried cranberries and a bit of almond extract and they were fantastic!! Great texture and extremely tasty! 

Also, compared to other scone recipes I've tried, this was pretty easy to work with. The only thing I would change would be the temperature of the butter. Other recipes tend to use very cold butter, and I've gotten better results with that.

Best Scone recipe ever!  I make these all the time.  Great with Mini chocolate chips!  Great with Craisins!  I sprinkle with Sparkling Sugar for a fancy look.
I cut up the cold butter into little cubes before I cut it into the flour.  These are super easy with an excellent result.

I was told "those were the best scones you have ever made!!!"

I did make a few recipe changes and they still turned out amazing. 1.) I used Greek yogurt in place of sour cream and it tasted fine. 2.) I used King Arthur unbleached white whole wheat flour which has all the nutrition of WW flour but a milder flavor. But it does have a disticnt wheat flavor.

Excellent Scones!  I used cranberries instead of raisins because I like the tartness of cranberries.

The best scone recipe ever! The dough scared me a bit at first because it was very dry and I didn't think it would come together. But after some good old fashion kneeding, turned out great. I cut mine 8 larger scones and had to increase bake time another 5-8 minutes. I added chopped pecans instead of raisins and they were simply delicious.

I made these a few weeks ago for the first time. I had trouble initially with the dough - it was really crumbly. I am still giving it 5 stars for taste though, I think it was just my inexperience making scones - and also the fact that I live at high elevation that could be affecting the outcome. I am definitely going to make this recipe again and anticipate that it will come out even better!

EXCELLENT! I made these just as directed and like other reviewers mentioned, they are "crummy" before you knead them. They do come together though  and turn out great. I added white chocolate chips to 1/2 and milk chocolate chips to the other 1/2 batch. Sprinkle with icing sugar and serve immediately! Yummy!!

These come out perfect every time and there is no way to keep your hands off their buttery tasty texture. It's one of my all time favorites and a must-have recipe for occasions like brunches or as a tea-time treat.

I will not be making these too often as I could not keep out of them.  What an absolutely fabulous recipe.  I used greek yogurt and added fresh blueberries and lemon zest.  I also made a simple lemon juice/icing sugar glaze for the top.  To die for.  Starbuck's doesn't come close.  Thanks so much for one of the best recipes I have come across in a long time.

Delicious! I added lemon juice, extract, and zest based on the suggestions of a reviewer. However - it's just crazy to make 12 out of this recipe! I divided further and made 18, and they were still HUGE! Better would be to divide the dough in two before flattening it in a circle then cut each circle into 12 wedges to make more reasonable-sized portions.

Original recipe is great - but if you're in a pinch (like me), a few substitutes for a half sized recipe worked great!  Used 0% greek yogurt for sour cream, sub. cream of tartar for 1/4 tsp lemon juice, and also used a flour mixture with white whole wheat and AP flours (1c of each), and one whole egg.  Can't go wrong with any add-ins either!

I had a lovely breakfast this morning thanks to these scones. I mixed gently and until just incorporated and ended up with wonderfully airy scones. I wanted to include vanilla extract, but I was all out. However, I did add 1/4ts of almond extract. I included some lemon zest and fresh blueberries I had on hand. Thank you for the recipe.

These are so great!  I don't add raisins and I sprinkle extra sugar on the tops before baking, I won a local cooking contest with these 2 years ago and my whole family loves them!  When you first turn out the dough it is a little crumbly, just keep working on it, it will come together and pat out nicely.

I wanted to do a trial run for a scone recipe as I  prepare for my daughter's sorority tea later this week.   I can not imagine how this recipe could be any better.  Absolutely delicious.  A couple of hints - make sure the butter is fridge cold, cut up in small squares and work the butter through the flour with your hands until the consistency is like rough cornmeal.  Everything will work together nicely and you will barely need flour to roll the dough out.   I added in blueberry infused cranberries instead of the raisins and after coming out of the oven, I drizzled the tops with an icing made of confec. sugar and fresh lemon juice.  I also found that the scones were too large so I used a quarter of the dough at a time, cut it like pizza to make smaller, cuter  triangles.

I just made this recipe exactly as written (without the optional raisins) and paired it with the devonshire cream recipe from this site and it was amazing.  Our guests were raving about these scones.  They were so simple to make!  I almost felt guilty accepting the heaping praises knowing that very little effort was involved.  

Just remember to not overwork the dough!  My wife thought that I needed to knead the dough a bit more as it was just clumped together, but the scones were perfect.  Fresh out of the oven, they were soft and moist.  After resting for a couple of hours, they had a nice firm crust with a moist center.  Simply amazing!

I've made this recipe many times, especially around the holidays when hosting or visiting family members. I have had to leave out the cream of tartar (I think added a little extra baking powder) because not everyone has that ingredient on hand.  They still turned out wonderfully.  I usually double the recipe because everyone just keeps eating them!!

Good basic recipe. I made them into pumpkin scones just mixing canned pumpkin and sour cream.

I love it!  I've never made scones before and these were really easy to make!  It did take me a bit longer...about 25 minutes to cook through, but that was my fault as they were maybe about an inch versus 3/4 of an inch thick.      I made mine with fresh strawberries and it was sooooo yummy!  I also made some clotted cream on the side :-)  I made them last night and took one to work today and it was still delicious!

These turn out just as good when you substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream.  These are by far the best scones I've ever had.

These are great to make spur of the moment because I almost always have these ingredients on hand.  And of course they are sooooo yummy!  But don't over handle the dough.

These were wonderful!  Weren't too dry like many scones are and had nice flavor.  Brought them to a tea party recently and they were a big hit!  I also added juice of half a large lemon and a little lemon zest & then coated them with a lemon glaze.

Not gonna lie...this is the best scone I've ever had. They are always a huge hit with my friends and family, and I'm always being asked if they can take some home with them.  If you are making them in a humid/warm environment, I definitely recommend making sure that the dough is uber cold prior to baking. I made a batch that wasn't cold enough and the scones kind of oozed out when they baked. They still tasted delicious, but they were a bit flat.  I recommend this recipe with the Microwave Lemon Curd and Easy Devonshire Cream recipes located here on Allrecipes.   Enjoy!

I love this scone recipe! I make these on a regular basis because my boyfriend loves these for breakfast. I've made chocolate chip scones, lemon poppyseed, and lemon raspberry scones. I will definitely keep making them!

Fantastic scone recipe. I used the base recipe and instead of raisins I chopped some dried apricots and toasted some pecans. I brought these scones to work with homemade lemon curd and a mock devonshire cream and my fellow flight attendants just loved them.  I brushed the top with some cream and sprinkled coarse sugar before baking. Great base recipe. I'll try them with some other ingredients added in the future.

I made these last night and they are delicious! I used my food processor to "cut in" my frozen butter with the sugar first, then added the butter/sugar to the mixed dry ingredients. Additionally, I mixed in Craisins, cinnamon, and pumpkin spice.  I didn't noticed till after that a reviewer also added a tsp of vanilla, I will try this next time.

Yum! I have been looking for a scone recipe that was similar to my Grandma's and this is it. I followed the recipe to a "T" and the used currants instead of raisins. I also sprinkled white sugar on top. These scones were light and flaky. They disappeared fast. This recipe is a keeper and doesn't disappoint.

These Scones are great. My wife and I made them last night. Yum, now I have breakfast for the week.  :-D  She has never made scones before and was pleased that they turned out so well with the limited amount of experience. I was also very pleased with the final product. These are quite flaky and dense. We put frozen blue berries in our since we don't care much for Raisins.   Thank you Grandma Johnson!   Dave

I should have looked more carefully at the other reviews...I did what the instructions said, and divided the dough into 12 wedges. They got massive and I had to keep on adding time onto the recipe. After I finally cut them all in half, they still took 35min to cook through.

Wonderful! Everybody should make these-I made an orange version with orange glaze.  I ran out of baking powder, powdered sugar, had no orange extract and no way to zest my orange and they still turned out wonderful!  You can't go wrong with these, and there are so many different flavor options!

As soon as I saw this recipe I made it, and as soon as I finished them I ate them! The only negative that I have to say is that these are too good to be called scones! I think of scones as a bit dry and hard, and these are so soft and moist.

Update: Since my last review, I've subbed 1C plain non-fat yogurt for the sour cream and it STILL came out delish! this recipe can't be beat.-------Original Review: I've made this recipe many times and it can't be beat...simple, delicious, and very versatile. To make it a bit more healthy, with my last batch, I subbed 1/2c butter and 1/2c apple sauce for the 1c butter and used WW flour. (Oh, and I always follow the instructions written by Lucia de Wagner - thanks!). The texture is a bit different, but still just as tasty! And its healthier to boot!

These were wonderful. The first time I used craisins, the second time I used Pomegranate craisins and sliced almonds. The possibilities are endless. It makes a lot, I got about 40 scones out of each batch.

Very similar to a mix Williams Sonoma used to carry, they were the best scones ever. I was so disappointed when they quit carrying them and so happy when I made these (I used currants). This is the best scone recipe and totally deserving of all 5 stars.

I've made scones with this recipe the 2nd time around now. It's extremely good! I used a different butter this time and I think it got an even better flavor. Sour cream is key!

This is different from the scones I've had before. It's dense and moist; but cake-y. I doubled the recipe, but made them smaller than the described triangles. I used an "old-fashioned"-style drinking glass as my cookie cutter... I got 53 rounds, and with the remaining dough formed one larger round. I found the dough to be a little dry so I chose to use a cup of orange juice as one of my add-ins; the other being a cup of dried cranberries. Maybe my orange juice ruined it? It seems that way... I am inexperienced with making scones. Will try again.

These are awesome. you can do so many variations with them. If I dont find a scone pan next time I will make 18-24 with one batch.  Excited to try freezing the dough like another reviewer as well. I also used light sour cream and they were delicious. people asked me for the recipe, but I just want to keep it all for myself!

These are awesome scones!  I made them exactly as written except I used blueberries since I truly hate raisins in any form.  These were super easy to whip up in the food processor.  I noticed they were taking much longer to bake than the 12-15 minutes specified, so I turned the heat way up to 400 like I do for all of my other scone/biscuit recipes.  They cooked up beautifully and people can't keep their hands off them.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have used this recipe many, many times and it always comes out wonderful.  I use my food processor to mix everything.  First add all the dry ingredients then cut the butter into pats and add to food processor dry ingred.  Last but not least add you wet ingred.  I've done orange zest and cranberries,  cinnamon and chocolate chip.  They're all good.

I substituted the all purpose flour for whole wheat pastry flour and cranberries for the raisins.  Added 1t of almond extract, cut them into 16 triangles, brushed with milk and sprinkled raw sugar on top - they were my first attempt at scones and I will likely never try another recipe.  However, I will probably cut sugar to 3/4c.  EXCELLENT!!

My entire family (including 3 teenagers) loved these scones, but you have to be a fan of dense (not light and crumbly) scones, which we are.  A few things:  1.  At the kneading stage, the dough is definitely dry but comes together after a minute of kneading. 2.  I roughly formed the scones in circles/mounds with my hands and they had a nice, rustic look to them once out of the oven.  MUCH easier than rolling and slicing. 2. I baked the first batch for 13 minutes and the centers were still wet.  I baked the second half of the recipe for 20 minutes and they turned out fully baked and nicely browned with crisp edges.  Next time I make these, I'm going to try adding dried cherries or chocolate chips, which I think will work great in this tasty recipe.

Delicious.  I used these for a strawberry shortcake base and it worked beautifully.  I left out the rasins and cut the sugar down to about 2/3 of a cup.  Definitely will be making these again!

Followed the recipe exactly as written, however I didn't have quite 1 cup of sour cream (probably 3/4 cup), and when I went to start kneading the dough it was way too dry. So I added just a small amount of milk.  Also brushed egg wash on them and baked them for about 20 minutes 350 degrees. Ate with butter and homemade strawberry jam.  These scones were the best scones I have ever eaten.  I'll be making these for years to come!

Addendum: second time making this recipe. Still very good, however I would cut them smaller to make 24 scones instead of 12. Next time I will add some cinnamon to the batter (cinnamon raisin scones) and chill the dough for about an hour before rolling and cutting them out. I forgot the egg wash this time (a mistake- it makes a big difference in the golden brown color on top!) I think they require a few more minutes in the oven (maybe 20?) then I will top with a powder sugar/milk glaze to up the sweetness factor. Overall a really good, basic recipe. I'd like to do a raspberry white chocolate recipe next! I'll let you know how it turns out!

I split this recipe in half.  Half was peanutbutter/chocolate chip swirl chips and the other was little carmel balls....I love sweets, although I am going to try ground sausage and cheese for a savory scone.  I tried one scone recipe befor this, I will be repeating this one, not the other:)  I followed the directions, for the most part, I used one sitck salted butter and one unsalted.  I cut them in triangles opposed to circles like the other recipe, I prefer the look of triangles, I got 19 scones total.  These are sweet, but as I mentioned, I like sweet, I'll be repeating this recipe.  Thanks Gma J:)

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!! I really loved these.  I subbed blueberries for the raisins and froze half.  I am going to do a powdered sugar+milk+oj glaze with some cane sugar for texture in my next batch but the tasteand texture can't be beat!

The scone's were rather large so I would form about 15 triangles. I made them with dried cranberries and shaved almonds. The additions didn't do this justice. The dough that cooked didn't taste good to me.

Great start to a fabulous scone....Obviously very versatile! I was in a rush and really flubbed the directions. I put the sugar in with the flour...oops! I started with a half batch to try it out..... I used half sour cream and half fat free vanilla yogurt, 3/4 cup sugar, tsp of vanilla, cinnamon,  whole wheat flour and frozen blueberries. Mixed it all together hoping it would turn out. Pressed it out onto floured parchment; it made 8 good sized scones. Baked 'em for 19 minutes and they came out soooo good! Will definitely try them many different ways!

Easy recipe for scones. I had never made them before, but they turned out well. the key is to NOT over-mix the batter. Also tried with chocolate chips. They are really good also with a powdered sugar glaze. Yum!

Followed the tips of Lucia de Wagner and the scones came out FANTASTIC! They were giant, and I couldn't even finish one. But they were very buttery, and soft. I substituted fresh blueberries for the raisins. Also, I served the scones with maple syrup...it was great!

Would not change a thing. Followed another reviewer and froze them and then baked later. Wonderful tip!

So delicious! It was a bit hard to roll out, but I split the batch into two: almond with an orange glaze and basic chocolate chip. So soft and moist!

OMG - this IS the best recipe! I didn't add raisins because I don't care for them but I did add two whole cloves poked into the top of each wedge (to add decoration and flavor) and then sprinkled with cinnamon and powered sugar. Fabulous!

My kids love these!  It's kind of a pain to make, because the "dough" is so crumbly and I have to use my hands (which I hate doing), but it's always worth the effort!  Thank you!

These had a nice tender crumb (soft instead of too crumbly) and a slight sweetness to the outside of them. Delish.

These scones are the best! I make these for my mom a lot, and she likes them more than the store-bought kinds. I use dried cranberries (dusted in powdered sugar, first), and add about 1/2 cup orange zest into the dough. I then drizzle them with an orange glaze (made simply of powdered sugar and freshly squeezed orange juice) once they are completely cooled. They're so easy to make, and YUMMY!

Yup....this is it!  Look no further for a GREAT scone recipe...Flaky with just the right amount of sweetness...served these with the Devonshire cream and Cranberry holiday chutney recipes from this site.  They were AMAZING!!!!!!  I look forward to making these many more times....mmmmmmm!!!!!
UPDATE***  I have made these soooo many times now and I get 16 scones out of the recipe.  I've added frozen blueberries and topped with a lemon glaze, added raisins to a batch,  and did a plain batch with an orange glaze...all delicious!!!!!

Everyone who ate these said they were fantastic. I made the recipe as is and it turned out great! The cook up way bigger than I thought so in the end I had a ton of huge scones. I glazed about half of the ones I made and those were the first to go (breakfast sweets and whatnot) but the rest were soon to follow. Great recipe!!!

i have the hardest time following any recipe and mostly use them for guidelines, so i seldom rate them.  i thought they turned out great, even though after mixing i wasn't sure the dough would hold together. This recipe was pretty much followed with the following exceptions. i didn't have a full cup of sour cream so i added plain yogurt to make up the difference, i didn't have cream of tartar, so i added 1/4 tsp lemon juice to the egg along with 1 tsp vanilla. i mixed the sour cream and baking soda and then got distracted so it actually sat for quite some time. I also didn't have a full cup of butter, so i used 1/2 cup butter and just under 1/2 cup of vegetable oil. After mixing the wet and dry ingredients, i divided the batter in half, and added dried cranberries, fresh mandarin oranges, walnuts, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice to one and sausage, broccoli, and goat cheese to the other. i didn't pay attention to how many slices you were supposed to cut the patted circle into and only made 6 out of each one. instead of kneading i just sort of smashed the dough into a ball , flattening and reforming a few times. I had to increase the baking time to 35 min to compensate for the larger size, but they turned out perfect. I only cooked half of each batch, and have frozen the rest for cooking later. Thanks for a wonderful recipe, my first attempt at scones were great thanks to this recipe.

I had been looking for a scone recipe for awhile when I can upon this one. I decided to try it and I am so glad I did. These scones are absolutely amazing. I make them exactly as stated except I add either blueberries or chocolate chips instead of rasins. I have made these for several family and work functions and I always get rave reviews. Grandma Johnson got it right!!

My God these scones were AMAZING! To make them my own, I added 1/4 cup of fresh squeezed orange juice, the zest of two oranges, and 1 cup of craisins. After turning the dough out I divided it in half and made two 3/4" thick rounds, and cut each into 6 triangles. I brushed the top with a little bit of butter and baked till the top was a VERY light golden color. I couldn't WAIT to dig in. It was so light and fluffy, the orange scent was wonderful, and it was just the right amount of flaky. Even my husband, who dislikes scones, devoured 2 of them for breakfast. Will make again and again!

My first attempt at scones...and they did not disappoint! I had a 5 year old helping me too so they were over-mixed but they still turned out delish! Divided the dough and made chocolate chip and cinnamon with icing glazes. This recipe is a keeper! Can't wait to try them with blueberries! Thank you Grandma Johnson!!!!!

I've tinkered with this recipe some. I make it a little wetter by adding buttermilk (sometimes take out a little sour cream and substitute the buttermilk). I add in white choc chips and frozen huckleberries.  My son can't get enough.  Any other scones are now just a dissappointment.

Recipe was super simple to whip up. Dough was good consistency to work with. I made a double batch, added fresh firm blueberries to one full batch (mixed them in super gently and not one popped), lemon extract, lemon rind and poppy seeds to 1/2 of the second batch and for the final 1/2 batch of dough I added currents, orange rind, orange extract, grand marnier, allspice and cardamom. Instead of cutting into pie slices from 1 large mound of dough, I used two large spoons and scooped out large globs of dough. I left a couple inches between the mounds of dough for expansion while cooking. One other thing I did, after reading some reviews about excessive spreading of dough while cooking; I used 1/2 crisco instead of all butter and I added an extra egg to my double batch. This kept the dough from spreading as much. I scooped dough mounds onto a cookie sheet lined with wax paper and froze them for later use. The other half of my dough I cooked on parchment paper which eliminated the need to grease the cookie sheet.  I cooked the dough an additional 10 minutes, 25 min total, since my dough mounds were higher than if I'd cut pie shapes. This left them a nice touch of brown. Great base recipe that can be changed to your tastes.

WOW!  These are excellent!  I ended up making orange cranberry scones with a orange vanilla glaze and they were incredible!  I scarffed down most of them (don't tell my husband :)!!).  I will be making these again and will be using this recipe as a great base for many more flavors!

I have made this recipe over and over again - using different "add-ins" such as cranberries, chocolate chips, raisins, orange extract WITH cranberries, and it never fails that I get RAVE REVIEWS.  Everyone LOVES this recipe.  I never made scones before, and I will never try another version.  I have even passed this recipe on to others.

This was a great recipe as is - I didn't have cream of tartar so I used vinegar instead, worked out well.  I divided the dough into three, kept one plain, added orange juice & zest to one, and added chopped pecans & cinnamon to the other.  They are wonderful!

Pretty good base recipe. I made half with mini chocolate chips (very good) and the other half with orange zest and cinnamon (even better). I think I ended up having to bake them for much longer than the recipe called for though.

This was my first time making scones.. I've made them three times n the last 2 weeks. These were perfect to serve with coffee and tea, at a morning meeting I was facilitating. I added fresh picked blackberries, just took some dough and blackberries mushed together lightly in my hand,placed on cookie sheet, sprinkled with sugar. Thanks to Grandma Johnson!

These were fabulous. I added about 1tsp of vanilla to the dough. Also grated frozen butter into the dough (as I heard on TV) to distribute perfectly. Split the dough into two pieces and folded craisins and white choc chips into one and lemon zest and frozen blueberries into the other. I had to cook them longer, but could be my oven. They are WONDERFUL.

I made this recipe twice this weekend and got rave reviews from the family.  I used raisins in the first batch and dried blueberries in the second.  I was a little apprehensive since the dough seemed so dry while I was mixing it, but it came together with the kneading and the scones were rich and moist.  It was my first attempt at scones.

These are wonderful, and so easy!  My husband is not a raisin fan, but had a cranberry/orange scone at Starbucks and I just couldn't be out done by them!  These were 10 times better.  I used 1 C dried cranberries, the zest of an orange and pumpkin pie spice to taste (about 1 tsp.).  They would be just as great with chocolate chips or plain old cinnamon sugar.  To make them extra sweet, make a traditional powdered sugar glaze to drizzle on top once they cool.  YUM!  (Regarding the butter comments, I ALWAYS use Land O' Lakes salted butter no matter what a recipe calls for.  If a recipe calls for salt in addition, I just omit it and I haven't gone wrong yet.)

Wow! The best scone I have ever had. I never really liked scones before but these are a keeper. I usually substitute the raisins for 2 cups of blueberries. They are a little hard to get the dough mixed with more berries than the recipe calls for, but they sure taste fantastic. The family absolutely loved them. I make a frosting of cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, and several drops of milk for my husband to top them off with as he is a frosting lover

Great base recipe, although was very dry on the offset.  I added OJ and fat free half and half to get a dough to form.  Great base for all flavors though....made orange, chocolate chip scones.  Nice flake to them, dense and moist.  Better after a day of sitting a mellowing.

I was expecting great scones after reading the glowing reviews.  First time I made them, the dough was crumbly and dry, and the scones weren't very good.  Thinking I may have done something wrong, I tried them again, this time adding orange extract and craisins, as others suggested.  Again, they came out crumbly and dry, and the dough was really hard to work with.  Sorry, but I won't be making these again.

When I stumbled apon this recipe, I was actually looking for a blueberry-cream cheese scone recipe, so I knew right away I was going to alter it about. I was worried about putting the cream cheese in with the blueberries, but they turned out fantastic! I followed the instructions posted by one of the top reviewers, as well. When it came time to add the blueberries and cream cheese (I added half of one package), I just used a knife and "cut" them into the dough. Immediately after I pulled them out of the oven, I drizzled with a cream cheese icing which I just stole from one of the cinnamon roll recipes from this site. These were exactly what I was looking for and tasted just like the ones I used to eat from England when I was a kid. Very scrumptious! Thanks for the great recipe, and I look forward to trying other ingredients with this as well!

Very very good.  I thought the dough might be temperamental (sp) but it wasn't at all to me.  I followed the changes of the reviewer just before me and they were very very good.  I used about 3/4 of cup of chocolate chips in the dough....perfect!!

I made these for mother's day with fresh strawberries.  I also drizzled the top with a mix of vanilla, milk and powdered sugar.  This added some extra flavor since my stawberries aren't overly flavorful, like raisins or nuts would be. My mother loved them.

As others have stated, very dry dough to work with and very crumbly and dense texture when baked as well as ugly looking.  They look NOTHING like the photo posted.  I made them to use for strawberry shortcakes and hope that helps save them, but will never make as scones again.  Chewing it, it felt like a mass of dense dough in my mouth.  They didn't rise during baking and needed to be baked 10 minutes longer than specified in the directions.  Really disappointing with all the great reviews :(

OMG...these were the best scones I have ever had! This was my first time making it and they turned out perfectly.  I did however make 2 changes. I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and sprinkled raw sugar on top to give it a nice crunch.  I do not have a food processor so I put the butter in the freezer for 15 minutes to harden it before cutting into small pieces. Freezing it made it much easier to cut it into small chunks. I also made only 16 scones and baked it for 25 minutes.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

Great recipe! No changes or modifications needed (although if you're watching your weight you can use plain fat free yogurt in place of the sour cream) I've made this recipe several times... scones turn out perfectly everytime! I've made lemon, cranberry orange, raspberry, blueberry, apple cinnamon and chocolate chip. Doesn't matter what you put in these.... they're all so yummy!

So good!! I made it exactly how the recipe states except I used dried cranberries instead of raisins. I had my sister over this morning and we had tea with the scones and spread lemon curd on them. They were so easy to make. This one is going in my recipe box!

I loved this recipe!  I substituted the 1 cup raisins for 1/2 cup dried cranberries and 1/2 cup dried apples.  I added 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tablespoon of vanilla and 2 tablespoons of caramel sprinkles. It was absolutely heavenly!!  It was almost a cross between a biscuit and a cookie!  My mother who adamantly proclaimed that she "does not like scones", loved it as well!  I can't wait to try a couple of variations with a more savory twist!

I've made this recipe 3 times now and it has turned out every single time.  I omit the raisins b/c I'm just not a huge fan of them.  I also like to make Alton Brown's Donut Glaze and dunk them in the glaze to make a scone just like the Vanilla Scones they sell at Starbucks.

I was a little nervous at first to try something like this but I'm glad I did.  It gets easier every time I make them.  I like them with cinnamon, vanilla, and cinnamon chips.  My kids like them too.

These were delicious. First off I was a little scared when they were baking. dough was very sticky and some of the butter seeped out, but when they were done they were fluffy and had a nice crispy sweet crust on the bottom. I put milk on top and then dusted with sugar before baking and it left a wonderful crackly sugar crust. no need for a glaze. also added frozen blueberries. terrific. going to try other fruits as well.

I have used several different scone recipes, and have purchased scones at many a tea shoppe, etc, and these are by far the absolute best I have ever tasted. They are good as is, but I typically add fresh blueberries or a dried medley of berries, and the fruit just sends them over the top!

This recipe is terrific!  I followed it exactly and the scones turned out great.  I didn't use the optional raisins, but after I had rolled out the dough, I decided to add some chocolate chips.  So the chips were only on the top, not mixed into the batter at all.  But, the scones came out great - no problem.  I have since made this recipe again and find this recipe to be very forgiving.  They always turn out great. I made this recipe to send to college kids in care packages from our church and they withstood the shipping well.  I put each one in a separate baggie.

These were INCREDIBLE! This was the first time I've ever attempted to make scones, so I followed the recipe as written, with the exception that I drizzled them with a powdered sugar and water glaze when I was finished. Putting the butter out at room temperature until it was slightly softened made it easier to cut it in with knives (I don't have a pastry blender). I can't wait to make these again with various fruits or chocolate, they were absolutely delicious and the whole family loved them.

I made these for my son's intergeneration day at school.  I used 1 cup of mini semi-sweet chips instead of the raisins and just dropped dollops of them on the baking pan instead of cutting them pie shaped.  Excellent and easy.

These are the best scones I've ever tasted!!! The possibilities are endless with this recipe. I divided in half and made one with raisins and the other with chocolate chips. Drizzled a powdered sugar glaze over both. Added cinnamon to the glaze for the raisin scone. Simply wonderful.

Mmmm.  Yummy.  Didn't add the raisins.  Instead I sprinkled the tops w/ cinnamon & sugar prior to baking.  I had to bake for 7 minutes longer than the recipe specified.

These are fantastic. I live in Utah, where tea time is uncommon, and the only scones that anyone has heard of are deep-fried. I've started having tea time, and wanted some real scones, and these were incredible. I love them. After cutting them in wedges, we cut them and put jam in them before cooking. They were yummy.

I have a fantastic scone recipe that I have been making for my family that is a wonderful flaky scone. I decided to switch it up a little and try this recipe this morning because of all the rave reviews. I'm sorry to say that it wasn't quite what I was expecting. These did not have the flaky consistency that I was expecting, I would try to say somewhere between a scone and a dense cake - leaning on the cake side. These were also just WAY too sweet for my taste, AND my kids. I made the recipe to the letter, with the exception of making half plain and the other half putting in some chocolate chips. Oh my gosh the sugar rush! These are perfectly wonderful if they are to be served in Starbucks or some other coffee shop as more of a pastry, but for myself and my family for breakfast, we prefer our scone recipe from The Ultimate Southern Living cookbook. My recipe has a ratio of 3 1/2 cups of flour with only 1/4 cup of sugar. Also, after 15 minutes in the oven they were not getting that firm and slightly tan coloring on the top, so I upped the temp to 400 for another 10 minutes or so. Grandma's recipe is certainly good if you have a sweet tooth, but I guess we don't, at least not first thing in the morning for breakfast.

Delicious!  I didn't even roll these out, just formed balls, and flattened them with my hand.  They are wonderfully soft and crumbly inside.  I love the way the baking soda makes the sour cream all fluffy when it sits in the bowl- a great science project for the kids!

This recipe was so delicious...and I even messed it up.  I decided to change the raisins to blueberries and bought some frozen blueberries.  I didn't thing to thaw them before I made it so at first it wouldn't stick together.  I waited until they start thawing and tried to roll it out to cut into triangles but the juice from the blueberries made it too sticky.  I ended up just making it into flat balls and baking it that way.  I had to bake them a little longer but they turned out just like muffin tops.  The flavor was the best!

I was craving some kind of comfort food and boy was this good.  I did not have sour cream, but did have some vanilla yogurt and used that instead, decreasing the sugar to 2/3 cup. I forgot the raisins and added an orange glaze.  Mmmm good! Had I known how EASY scones were, I would have started making them years ago.  I will definitely make these again.  Thank you, Rob for the recipe!

Very, very tasty scone recipe. I like my scones a little sweeter than this recipe, but I put a vanilla glaze over the top and that sweetened them up. I used a dried berry mix (raspberries, cherries, blueberries, cranberries) instead of the raisins. This will be my permanent scone recipe.

OMG these make the most AMAZING scones.  They are rich, not too sweet, moist and to die for!  You'll never be able to buy scones from *THAT* coffee place again.  I think my favorite thing to do is add grated lemon rind.  It lends a delicate lemon flavor.  I love to make a double batch and freeze the extra dough into smaller portions.  (If I make them all, I tend to eat them all..)  It's always handy to have on hand if I get a hankering for scones.

WOW! This is the only scone recipe I'll ever need now. Its perfect as is, and you can be so creative with the flavors. I divided the dough into two, and added rind of one lemon and 1 tablespoon of poppy seeds in one half, and cranberries and almonds in the other half. Both flavors are delicious! Thanks for the perfect scone recipe.

Delicious!  This makes 12 very large scones, so next time I will shape them smaller and it will make more.  I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla to recipe.  I may try low-fat sour cream next time.  I also served them with the Microwaveable lemon curd recipe from this site -- divine!

These are fantastic!  I am not a fan of raisins, so I add craisins and the zest from 2 lemons.  Perfect for afternoon tea - with a little devonshire cream, of course.

These are an incredible basic recipe to expand upon. I didn't have any sour cream, but I had some heavy whipping cream and that seemed to work just fine. I divided this recipe in half before the sugar was added and made one half of the recipe vanilla flavored ( the half with the sugar added, only 1/2 cup). The other half i made with cheddar and asiago cheese and some cayenne pepper. Instead of trying to divide one egg for each half of the recipe I added one egg to each half.  I made some vanilla glaze from cream, vanilla and powdered sugar for the vanilla scones. Both varieties turned out beautifully. I know I will use this recipe again. I would like to add orange rind and use an orange juice glaze for the next batch. Thanks Grandma Johnson!!!!

This recipe is the best! It adapts to changes easily.  I have added strawberrys & pecans, peachs & walnuts, whatever I have.  It is a larger recipe than what they say.  Stays nice & Fresh for days.

I made these scones the other day for a crowd and the reviews were wonderful!  My husband has requested them twice in the past week!  I followed other reccomendations with adding a little flavor to them.  I used a pinch of almond extract and some raspberries from this years harvest... what a great pair!

I had never, in my life baked scones.  However, my husband and I recently took a liking to going out for Afternoon Tea on Sundays.  I found this recipe, read the many RAVE reviews and decided to try it.  The recipe is EXTREMELY SIMPLE and has gone over so well with my friends and family that I have to make the dough, freeze it and distribute it out to the various households.  We absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I always use two eggs, rather than one.  It "fluffs-up" the scones just a tad.  If you have not tried these, you really should.

I made these scones as directed in the recipe (except that I used Craisins instead of raisins because that's what I had).  I thought these turned out GREAT!  They didn't last very long in our house! I loved them and will definitely make them again, trying out difference fruits.  These are definitely a keeper.
Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I wouldn't change a thing. You can make a variety with the same batter. I seperate the dough in half. I used  1 tsp lemon rind, and added blueberries. The other half I put in 1 tsp vanilla extract and then added semi-sweet chocolate chips. All of them have been light, like a buscuit. They travel well without breaking up. They make a good breakfast treat. They look good in triagles, the bakery we have makes them like clumps. Frosting is optional. I've made these twice and will make again in the future.

Followed word for word, no problems.
The family thinks they are incredible, like sugar cookies but with a scone texture.

I think I'll make another batch and freeze the dough.

The best scone recipe I have ever made.  It is always a hit at whatever event I take it to.  A favorite of the firemen at our local station.  YUM!

I've been making these for a while and like to add butterscotch chips to them for an extra sweet yummy treat. They are always so delicious, and the kids love um too.

These are pretty delicious (I made them with cranberries and walnuts), but I think the serving size is waaaaaaaaay off. Unless you want to eat a scone that is the size of a man's head, this serves more like 24-36. I used 2/3 of the recipe, thinking I would have 8 scones, and I ended up with 24. Oh, well--there are worse things in life than 24 scones.

This is my first time making scones. I will never buy scones again! I halved the recipe and they turned out great. I followed the directions provided in Lucy7's review and used dried cranberries and semi-sweet chocolate chips in place of the raisins. Then I sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. Great recipe.

I have made these many times and they always come out excellent. Usually I add dried cranberries and squeeze some fresh lemon juice in the batter before baking instead of raisins and I've had many complements. I've also tried them with chocolate chips but the cranberries are my favorite. Sprinkle the tops with sugar in the raw before baking for some added sweetness.

Very nice. This was my first time making scones.  My husband, who hasn't liked scones in the past, said they were good.  My sisters, who have apparently been making a variety of scones, liked them too. I used 1/2 dried cranberries and 1/2 raisins. I brushed the tops with egg and sprinkled sugar before baking. I will definitely make these again.

I made this for my friends and family, it was delicious! It was my first time at scones but it was definately worth an achey arm from mixing the dough!
I subsituted the raisins for chocolate chips and that seemed to make them perfect for us :)

As far as scones go, these are great!  Mine had some trouble browning so I turned up the heat for the last little bit of baking but these were very light, flakey and a little sweet.  I've tried a ton of scone recipes and these were one of the best, not as heavy as some.  I served with devonshire cream and sweetened sliced peaches for Father's Day breakfast and they were a hit, leftovers were re-heated and served with strawberry freezer jam-yummy!

By far the BEST scones we've tried.  They tasted like something you'd get at a restaurant or bakery.  I was concerned the dough would be too dry when it came time to knead it on the counter, so I ended up just taking off my rings and working it with my hands in the bowl which worked just fine.  We decided to use craisins ~ very good!  These were the highlight of Father's Day!  Thank you for sharing such an incredibly delicious recipe!!!

These are wonderful!!  I added 1 tsp almond extract, 1 tsp cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg to the sour cream mix.  Then I brushed with milk, and topped with cinnamon, sugar, and slivered almonds before baking.  Yum!!

Fantastic!!  I used the orange zest and cranberry variation.  My co-workers loved them.  I had several requests for the recipe.  As already mentioned, don't over mix or knead too much.  I usually just gather up the crumbs and roll it out.

SO DELICIOUS!!! I made a 1/2 recipe, which made 8 scones.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, then brushed the tops with milk and sprinkled with sugar before baking.  I made these for my mother, I usually don't like scones.  However, these ones they were SO GOOD!!!  I tried a couple other scone recipes on here and this one is the best by far.

My family loves these scones.  Made three batches one weekend while visiting relatives.  We don't like raisens but brown sugar/cinnamon and mini chocolate chips are the favorites.  Thanks for sharing your family recipe.

Wow, they are good! I wish I would have made only half because this recipe makes a LOT. I had about 15 large scones and gave some to my sister. I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 1/2 tsp finely ground instant coffee to the batter along with mini choc chips. I brushed the top with cream and sprinkled with sugar. Next time I would sprinkle w/ cin. sugar mixture. Awesome!!!!

I wasn't sure whether to use cold butter and cut it in or softened butter. I went with the cold and the dough was very crumbly. I had to add a few tablespoons of heavy cream to get it to come together. I also added vanilla extract, sprinkled the tops with sugar before baking, and baked them longer (I made them big). Turned out fantastic with these changes.

These were really yummy.  A little bit sweet but good. I also replaced 3/4 cup white flour with wholewheat flour. I cut these into round scones using a 1 inch pastry cutter.  I made 18 scones.  These scones didn't have that texture that a traditional scone has but it's a very nice version.  Will be making these again.

I have a scone recipe that I have used for years, but when I saw how great this recipe was reviewed I decided to change it up for easter.  Bad idea.  The consistency was all wrong right from the beginning: the dough was way too sticky, and then once they were baked were not what I would consider a "scone consistency".  It was lacking in flavor, and what flavor it did have was too sweet for me and my family.

Wonderful.  They were so good right out of the oven.  I added some fresh blueberries and raspberries to the top of the scones after I had them cut out.  Will try these again.

I've made this twice now; the first time I added about a teaspoon of vanilla and most of a bag of mini chocolate chips, and the second I added a bit more than a teaspoon of cinnamon and a bag of cinnamon chips.  (I omitted the raisins both times.)  They came out really wonderful both times.  I didn't make any other changes to the recipe.

Excellent!  I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins and they were great.  They aren't very sweet so if you like a sweeter scone you'll have to add more sugar.  Next time I think I'll double the dried cranberries.

These are FABULOUS!!  I absolutely loved them and so did everyone I shared them with.  I put pecans and white chocolate chips in mine.  Next I want to use some dried fruit.  I also plan on making them somewhat smaller, but that's the only change.   Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Excellent and totally customizable. A great base recipe. I've made with with cinnamon apples, blue berries and lemon so far. Next time I may try white chocolate chips and raspberries!

These scones were very moist (for scones) and were more like a crumbly cake than the typical brick-like substance that scones always get a bad rap for being. I made them for over a dozen friends who loved them and came back for seconds.

OH MY GOSH, these are AWESOME.  I did follow the tips from the reviewer Lucy 7 dated 9/13, thanks!  The only variations I made from hers were I omitted the raisins, still used 1c of sugar.  I made these for a Valentine's Day play group so I used a 3" heart cookie cutter which made around 32 hearts.  I also used the back of a 1/2 tsp to make a dip in the center and filled it with 1/4 tsp jam.  Don't put too much or they will over fill while baking :)  I got the jelly idea from Betty Crocker's website.  I can't wait to try them with fresh fruit.  I think you could add just about anything to these and you won't go wrong!

Truly the best!  Since I started making these I (and many of my coworkers too!) can't stomach the scones sold at coffee shops and grocery stores.  Try these and you'll never go back!  I follow the recipe except for omitting the cream of tartar and frequently substituting other goodies (craisins, chocolate chips, nuts) for the raisins.

Grandma Johnson's Scones weren't that bad, the only thing that stopped them from totally winning me over was myself, Ill make them again, but won't forget to add sugar.

Absolutely the best scone recipe! So tasty and easy to make. I couldn't agree more with the previous reviewer. It's worth rolling out between wax paper and sticking in a freezer bag to freeze for later use. I've done that many times and they always come out great. This truly is a great basic recipe that can be added to: dried cranberries, blueberries, and chocolate chips are just some of the ones I've tried. Yum!

Ahhhhh perfection! I am a pastry-eating junkie so trying to keep these out of my mouth is difficult! The changes I made were minimal. As a previous reviewer had mentioned, I added and extra 1/2 cup of sugar. I divided the dough into 2. In one half I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla extract. For those I also made a vanilla glaze with confectioners sugar, milk, vanilla extract and a touch of almond extract. The second section I put dried cranberries in and made an orange glaze for those with confectioners sugar, grated orange peel and orange juice. It was the perfect combo! This is only the first time I have tried this recipe, it was actually a test run for a baby shower I will be hosting in the near future. This surely passed the test and without hesitation I will be making these for the shower guests!!!!! Thank you!

Yummy! I added the zest of 1 orange and then squeeze some of the oranges juice in. I then cutthe batter in half and added chocolate chips to one batch and cranberries I soaked in warm water to the other.( I used Henry's strawberry flavored cranberries)I also beat the egg and added it to the sour cream mixture as well as 1tsp. of vanilla. *I found that using a silpat works wonderfully with baking these scones. They didn't stick and were beautifully golden on the bottom. I will be making these again soon. Next time I think I'll do blackberries, white chocolate chips and lemon zest.

YUM!  I have been eating scones that are more of a dessert scone for years.  Recently I decided I wanted to go for the more authentic scone...YUM!  Found it!  Tip- Let them cool to room temperature so they get that perfect consistancy.  I used brown sugar because it was all I had, but everthing else was the same and it was soooo good.

These turned out very well on the first try.  I also added vanilla as per other reviewers suggestions.  I made three types:  cinnamon/raisin, lemon/cranberry and blueberry/orange.  I also froze them individually and have been able to bake them from frozen. 25 min @ 350.

This is a great recipe - with just a few changes.  I cut the sugar down to 2/3c. I use currants or dried blue berries and fresh grated lemon peel or raspberried with white chocolate chips.  I make them small (24 scones).  You can put the dry ingredients and butter together the night before.  It makes the last minute prep so much cleaner and quicker.

UNBELIEVABLE!  This is perfect as written, but I added some (~1 Tbsp) frozen orange juice concentrate and a dash of lemon juice to half the dough, and it's the best scone I've ever had!  I glazed with OJ/powdered sugar.

Very good and moist! I used lite-sour cream, brushed with egg wash and dusted with sugar. The sones came out just wonderful! I divided the dough into 2 parts and made 2 flavors, one with cranbery/orange (quarted cranbery tossed with sugar) and one with raisen/walnut (plumped raisen with hot water). Both were very good!

Amazingly good...I was shocked that I was able to make scones that tasted this wonderful.  They were melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  This recipe deserves every single 5-star rating its received.  I made them plain, and went directly by the recipe as given, and served them with strawberry jam and fresh whipped cream...unbelievably good.  I will make these often, without a doubt!

These are the best ever.  I've had company over twice and served them for dessert.  They were a smash hit.  I added lots of yummies to dress them up.
Cranberries and Lemon Juice
Blackberries and White Chocolate Chips
Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chips
Blueberrites, White Choc and Lemon Juice
Raspberries, White Chocolate

Yummmm:)

These were awesome! I started out making peanut butter pie, but my cream turned to butter and I wasn't going to waste it. My whole family loved them and asked for more. I used frozen cherries that I drained really good and then chopped.  Next time I think I will use a larger chop and some of the fruit juices.

These are the best scones I've ever tasted.  So moist and easy to prepare.  I used the food processor and they turned out beautiful and tender.  Just be careful not to over mix.

I've never made scones before because I've thought they were too dry in coffee shops. These were great--even all my kids thought so. I made half with raisins and a glaze and the other half with white chocolate chips.

Loved these! Made 2 rounds of 8 and they were perfect. I used 1 cup of Craisins & 3 teaspoons of orange extract. Then made a glaze with 1c. powdered sugar, juice of 1/2 orange & 1/2 tsp. orange extract. Mine took longer to bake (20 min.) but baked on a stone, so that's probably why. Can't wait to try these again & try another variation, the possiblities are endless!

Absolutely delicious. I didn't change a thing other than I added Craisins and may use less sugar next time because they were sweetened already. My kids said it's a winner.This would be great with the Devonshire Cream. Thank you.

I have made these several times, always with super results. Sometimes I drizzle powdered sugar icing over the tops when cooled. Try adding blueberries, dried cranberries, or lemon zest for variety. They taste great with a cup of coffee!!

Light, flavorful & time consuming. Next time & will add dried raspberries to the mix & see what happens. Should be yummy.

very awesome. I make them exactly how the recipe stated. They taste good fresh and even the next day! They are so good. My whole family eats them all up so fast! They melt in your mouth. This is definitely a regular.

I have made this recipe a few times for a farmers market and each time all my scones have been the first to sell out. Of course I have tried each flavor I have created from tips found here. Yum yum!

Ugh. A total disaster. For starters, I didn't have baking powder, so I said to myself, "Self I says, google baking powder subs." And so I did. Two parts cream of tarter, one part baking soda. Well, it is kind of hard to divide 1 and .25 teaspoons into thirds. But I tried.  After combining the ingredients, I spread the dough out to knead it, and it's all dusty. It's not a dough, it's a ball of white dirt with clobs of butter in it. Ooops. Scoop up the stuff and put it back in the bowl. Jumping online I find to add 1 teaspoon of milk to help this problem, and I do so. It helps, so I spread it out again. Then I go to cut it. It won't stick together. Ooops. Back into the bowl, and more milk. Try to cut them again and it still won't stay together. Ooops. Or maybe it should be ARGH instead of ooops. By now I'm ready to throw the dough at the 4 year old who keeps saying "wah wah wah" to me as I struggle with the dough. ARGH. Now I just don't care any more. I grab a handful of the dough and ball it up and chunk onto the pan. Look ma, a new recipe, scone balls!

They're baking now,I'm scared to look into the oven. I can almost hear them yelling "You bloody fool!".

OK, on to the taste: YUM! I wee bit on the thick side, but that's OK. They're plenty sweet, even with reduced sugar. Worth the hassle? Tough call....

These scones are absolutely wonderful.  Every time I make them, people just love them.  They take a little practice to get the shape/size right but they still taste great.  I add craisins instead of raisins and some almond extract.  They are soooo good!!

this is such a great recipe!!  i only used 3/4 cup of sugar, and used organic sugar in the raw, as well as blackberries!!  DELICIOUS!!  I also made a vegan version, taking out the sourcream and egg, and replacing them with 3/4 soy milk, and one 8 oz. tub of tofutti cream cheese.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

These are definitely the best scones I've ever made! Other recipes tend to be a little dry, but these stayed moist and soft for days. I added dried cranberries, walnuts, and a bit of orange zest, but followed the recipe otherwise. This is now my default scone recipe!

I heart this recipe. BUT, you can easily make it VEGAN. Replace sour cream with 1 cup soy yoghurt, egg with egg replacer, and butter with vegan butter. Make it healthier by using brown sugar and whole wheat flour. This version is more moist than the original, so you may want to add a little more flour.

These were such a pain for me to cut and shape into something that looked like food. But these are just as tasty as they are ugly!!! Per another suggestion, I added an extra 1/2c sugar, 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp of almond extract and 1tsp vanilla. Then sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. I can't wait to make these again and see what combinations I can come up with.

this was my first attempt at making scones and this recipe was wonderful!  i used these for a sample platter for my business and was told they were amazing!  very moist and versatile.  while still warm, i brushed the top with melted butter and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  i will definitely use this one again!

This was my first time making scones, so I did not know what to expect, but these were SO easy (save for the huge mess). I threw in about 3/4 cup dried fruit (welch's) and roughly 1/2 cup white chocolate chips. Divine.

Next time, I might try some sort of glaze on the top.

This is a great basic recipe that allows you to use your creativity. You can add just about anything to this scone mix and it comes out great. Tried it with cinnamon and brown sugar, tried it with dried cranberries and then tried it with blueberries. All three batches turned out wonderfully!

Very nice recipe and one worth trying. I was intrigued by the prep method.  End result was a light, flaky scone, a result of the sour cream mixed with the baking soda and then the addition of cream of tartar. If I didn't have a recipe that I LOVED I certainly would have rated this a five.  I don't care for raisins (too big and flabby) so I swapped out for currants, made the glaze as pictured, which is an absolute "must have" addition in my opinion.  Grandma Johnson, you have a mighty fine recipe.  Mrs. Humphries, you're still my favoritest favorite.

Very good but pretty fluffy. I think maybe that was because the sour cream I used was light. I prefer a denser scone, but otherwise it would have been a 5. I'll keep searching, but this is my number 1 backup!

Fabulous! Some friends and I have after-work tea once a month. I make them without raisins and just a little less salt. Clotted (or Devonshire) cream & preserves/jam top them off perfectly. I knew we had a winner when my friend from England gave this recipe his endorsement for best this side of "the pond."

I'm giving this recipe a 4 because my 6 and 7 year old absolutely loved these with their tea.  I will continue to try other scone recipes in the hopes of finding something a bit more to my liking.  I would have given this a 3 star rating except that the kids really seemed to like them.  In my opinion these were extremely bland and tasteless compared to a multitude of scones eaten over a lifetime.

These were great scones, the texture was perfect.  However, the taste was a bit blad - definitely needs alot more sugar and cinnamon.  I was hoping this recipe would make a scone like i would get in a coffee shop but it wasnt nearly sweet enough.  I would add an extra 3/4 cup sugar and some cinnamon.  I also added cut up canned peaches to my scones - very tasty!

These were delicious. They rose to be huge, and they tasted marvelous. The only thing I changed was I added a little milk, because it was still way too dry. the dough wasn't even sticking together at all. Also, I added a few extra raisens. Even me, who's not such a raisin fan loved the zing of flavor they added to the delicious pastry. I would've sworn they were from a bakery

Delish!  I put currants in half and topped with a cream wash and cinnamon/sugar sprinkle and lemon zest in the other half, cream wash and followed with a powder sugar/lemon juice glaze.  To die for.  Easy and fabulous.  Definitely a permanant resident in my recipe box.  Thanks Grandma J!

The BEST scones ever! The don't need anything else, no butter, no jam-- just enjoy. Every I know asks for this recipe from me. My stepdad makes them for himself in his hotel kitchen when he's on the road-- they are that good. I cannot say enough about how great these scones are.

These are really good, but... scones are funny business.  Kind of like biscuits... the preferred textures run a wide range, and one person's finest biscuit or scone may differ greatly from another's.  I personally liked these a lot, my kids did not.  They prefer them the way I have made them in the past... Grandma Johnson's scones are soft all the way through and just slightly chewy, the ones I normally make are slightly crunchy on the outside but completely tender inside.  To each his own.  This is an excellent recipe for those who prefer no crunch but want a hint of chewiness.

Delicious scones and easy to make!  They were great plain - no butter or jam or anything needed for me.  I'm looking forward to making them again and trying some flavor additions like others reviews have suggested.

FANTASTIC! I wanted an elegant Easter brunch but didn't have time to cook beacsue I was busy w/ Easter dinner. Made these the day before (being careful not to overwork the dough, as adviced by reviewers) & served them w/ Stonewall Kitchen's lime curd, fresh fruit drizzled w/ honey (cut the fruit the night before), soft-boiled eggs served in egg cups, coffee & OJ. I had breakfast on the table in 5 minutes! Loved this recipe...thanks!

These absolutely melt in your mouth!  It's the sour cream that gives them that special kick and keeps them super moist.  PERFECT.

Three cheers for Grandma Johnson!  These are absolutely fantastic.  Quite a bit softer than most other scones I've had, but that's what makes them so good.     I've made them with chocolate chips, and also with cranberries and white chocolate chips.  Both were delicious!  I'd give this recipe 6 stars if I could!

These are so easy to make, and great that you can add whatever flavors you like.  They are better than the scones at my favorite popular coffee shop.  I made half plain and half with raisins, and both were delicious.

YUMMY!! GREAT recipe- I'd never made scones before, but will definitely be making these again.
I made a few change. I accidently omitted the cream of tartar. I have no idea what it would actually do to make them any better, but they were delicious without it. I used fat free sour cream. I mixed all of the dy ingredients and cut in the cold butter until crumbly. I added the egg and a dash (1 tsp?) of vanilla to the sour cream/baking soda mixture right before adding it to dry ingredients. I kneaded it just enough to keep it together. I would suggest making two seperate cakes (or decreasing the recipe by half or the scones you make will be enormous) Mine baked for 15 minutes. I had some canned vanilla frosting which I melted in the microwave and drizzled over the top.
These scones were so tender and yummy we didnt use any butter or jam at all-they were perfect right out of the oven.

I've never made scones and I barely know how to kneed, but this recipe is amazing.  I didn't have creme of tarter, so I substituted it for vinegar.  I baked them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper to try and cut back on the high fat factor of this recipe.  I wanted cranberry scones, so I threw in frozen cranberries and orange zest.  I was afraid the frozen cranberries wouldn't thaw in 15 minutes, but them came out great.  The scones were the best I ever had.  Now, if only they were low fat...

I made these with just a minor change.  I added 1 Tbsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla as another reviewer suggested.  I also sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top before baking.  All of my children loved these and asked me to make them again.

I thought I'd add to the hundreds of comments about these scones!  Delicious!  I thought I'd screwed up the recipe for sure when I accidently added some of the baking powder to the sour cream instead of the baking soda...but the recipe was very forgiving.  I also made half a batch because there is only two of us.  It makes a lot.  It tastes like a sweet biscuit.  I added Craisins...which were great but next time, I'll experiment a little and add different flavors.  I had never made scones before, so this was a real treat!  Thanks Grandma Johnson!

I have been meaning to make these scones for a while. I finally got to them this morning, and the flavor is excellent! Reminds me of a trip to Ireland, and all the yummy scones there! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars, though, is because they were kind of crumbly and wouldn't stay together after baked. I will definitely be making these, again, though.

Wow. These are wonderful. I substituted vanilla yogurt for the sour cream and dark chocolate chips and raspberries for the raisins. I realized after putting them in the oven that I had omitted the egg, but they are still amazing.

Definitely a keeper.  I needed to bake a little longer to achieve a golden look.

I made these last week ... and they are to die for! These tasted quite close to the scones sold at our popular Puyallup Fair here in Western WA! I did leave out the raisens, and I slice them open and put Raspberry Jam inside before serving. I tried something that worked pretty well (however right out of the oven is best). But what I did was to take the scones, fill them with the jam, and layered them in a large crock pot lined with a couple of clean dish towels. I took them to a womens gathering...they were nice and warm to serve although they were a bit more 'moist' because of the crock pot. Next time I will leave the lid ajar on the crockpot so the steam escapes better. Great recipe!

Wow - these were the best scones I've ever tasted!  I've never made scones before so I found the recipe incredibly easy to follow.  I substituted chopped craisins instead of the raisins.  The scones came out beautifully, very moist and full of flavor - not like the dried up cardboard-tasting version you find at those famous chain coffeehouses!

These are amazing! I only had bread flour on hand and I think they came out with a lighter texture as a result (good in my opinion). I used dried cherries and added about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips. YUM

I've made these three times now. The first time I made tham as is, minus the raisins. They tasted just like the ones MY grandma used to make. The second time I just couldn't get the dough into a ball and ended up way overhandling it...threw it out! The third time was another success...I used a glass to cut them into a circular shape and used the resulting miniscones to make miniature strawberry shortcaked for a party...very pretty! I'll probably use this recipe again.

This is really yummy scones. I still can't give it a 5 star though coz' it's still not like the scones texture that me and hubby always had in this famous cafe here in Washington.

these turned out great.  it is definitely a fool proof recipe where you are allowed to flavor it with your heart's desire.  another member mentioned that she had used this recipe about five times within a week.  so did i.  it was a great hit with family, friends, and coworkers.  this recipe is definitely a keeper.

AWESOME!!!!  I didn't have raisins so I made some plain.  But, I had some chocolate chips and some chopped up pecans and used them with the other half of the dough.  Very easy to make and so darn good!!!  Thanks for sharing, I will be making these way too much.

This was the first time I've ever even TRIED to make scones and they were delicious!!  I used the advice of other cooks and added white chocolate chips and craisins.  I work in a doctor's office and brought them in for the patients.  By 10am, there were none to be found.  A++++++  THANKS for this great recipe...

...plus like 15 more stars!! I LOVE these scones. We've made lemon with a lemon glaze, cranberry orange and mini chocolate chip(our favorite!) There's nothing else i can say -- these are absolutely the BEST.  I also use fat-free sour cream, 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 sugar and country crock instead of real butter.  and they're STILL fabulous!  i tried once using 1/2 margarine, 1/2 fat-free cream cheese and they were still VERY good, but not AMAZING, which they usually are.  thank you SO SO much for this great recipe!

I highly recommend this recipe.  I reduced the butter and sugar by half and the scones were delicious.  I added fresh sliced peaches to several of the scones.  I served the scones with fresh strawberries, jam and Devon cream I found in the cheese section at the grocery store.  I baked only 4 of the scones and froze the remaining scones.  The frozen scones bake well.  It's good to have frozen scones on hand for strawberry shortcakes.  Next time, I'll add matcha (green tea powder) to the dough.

these are great. i make them ALL THE TIME. not your typical dry scone. the only thing i change is that i add golden raisins and about a 1/4 cup of vanilla flavoring (i'm all about sweet).  i've also made these with maple syrup and cinnamon....which is twice as delicious!

Delicious scones!  I substitute plain non-fat yogurt for the sour cream to lower the fat content, and if you use salted butter, they have a more cake-like consistency -- not your traditional scones but delicious nonetheless.  They are great plain, or with clotted cream and jam.  I made a batch with Craisins and white chocolate chips around the holidays, and my co-workers asked me if I'd put crack in them because they were so addictive.  Great scones!

I've never made scones before and these were super easy.  I got lots of compliments too!  Based on others' advice, I added a teaspoon of vanilla and substituted chocolate chips for the raisins. I divided the dough in half and made smaller scones, which seemed to work out well. I also added cinammon sugar to the tops of half of them.  Great recipe!!

My mother and I occasionally "do" a high tea. These are always the scones I choose to make because they are fantastic. The last time I made them, I added orange and craisins to half and cinnamon and vanilla to the other half, as I believe I read in a previous review. Flaky, melt-in-your mouth goodness. Even better than scones at the Empress in Victoria (a well known high-tea place in British Columbia). Yummy!

I kept my husband FULL of these while he was in Iraq.  I add dried apples, cranberries, strawberries, or blueberries, plus nuts, and have also used sundried tomatoes, crumbled bacon, and cheddar cheese. These are simply the best scones ever!

I made these for our church's Christmas tea and served them with lemon curd and the devonshire cream recipe also on this site.  Everyone raved about them.  They are much better than what you would buy at the grocery or a coffee shop!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This is the best scone recipe I have ever made. They are so moist, not dry like most scone recipes. I replaced the raisins with choc. chips. Everybody just loved them. I will continue to use this a my scone recipe from now on.

It was very good, but we don’t usually keep sour cream home. So, that made it a little inconvenient. My old recipe uses less butter and sugar, but still turns out as good. 
My husband and I could not tell much difference besides being sweeter. I think I will stick to my old recipe. Thank you for sharing though

These were a big hit at my house.  I divided the recipe in half and added frozen blueberries to one half and mini chocolate chips to the other.  The blueberry ones were more popular asthey stayed moist for 3 days where as the chocolate chip ones seemed dry after day 1.  I did divide each half in half again so I had 4 circles that I cut into six triagles each.  Perfect size for kids.  (I also added vanilla to the recipe)

Made a batch and added chocolate chips.  Before placing in the oven I also sprinkled some sugar on top of the scones.  Very good.  I also froze some scones to see how they would be when defrosted, and they still tasted great.  This is a good base recipe for scones.

My whole family loved these scones.  They were easy and fun to make.  I had a very hard time trying to convince my dad that I made this from scratch and didn't buy it from Starbucks! Grandma Johnson, thanks for this mindblowing recipe.  I will undoubtly be making these again in the future!

5 stars for taste alone. My whole family loved it; it was like eating a big crumbly biscuit. Great to serve for tea. I made about 23 palm-sized scones using this receipe.

Next time I'll be using much less sugar and butter however, as it's too buttery and sweet for the health-conscious.

I have been searching (without good results) for the perfect scone recipe.  This is it!  I used dried cranberries and white chocolate chips and will be experiementing with other mix-ins.  This recipe makes plenty too.  Ron, thank you for sharing Grandma Johnson's recipe!

Oh wow are these yummy!  I have never made scones before and these are perfect.  Not too sweet, but definitely sweet enough.  I made mine with chocolate chips and another batch with craisins and orange peel.  OMG, the cranberry orange ones are to die for!!  Thinking a teaspoon of vanilla would go a long way to add flavor and will try that the next time I make these.  Perfect as they are, but easy to add to.  Thanks soooo much!!

All came out excellent...mmmmmm. I am making a batch for a baby shower this weekend!

This is awesome! It is also kid-friendly. I made the version of half whole wheat flour, half regular flour (and low fat sour cream)
 and gave 4 kids each a clump of dough to add whatever they wanted (cinnamon chips, white choc, milk choc,dried fruit, ect) They had a blast mixing in flavors and they turned out delicious! Great healthy afterschool snack!

This was easy to duplicate and my scones came out incredibly flaky & delicious!  I used milk chocolate chips in mine, instead of raisins.  I think you could successfully include many different kinds of "add-ins."  Next time I'm going to try them with a little orange zest and some dried cranberries.

These scones are really fabulous!  I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was plenty sweet.  I will use only 1/2 cup of sugar the next time and heed to other people's advice about cutting the dough into smaller wedges.

Truly awesome recipe, and I've tried some very good scone recipes before.  I thought I had messed it up when I accidentally mixed the baking soda in with the dry ingredients instead of with the sour cream -- but they came out beautifully.  I used ~1 cup rum-soaked currants and ~1 cup chopped pecans.  These are great for breakfast or tea!

These scones are absolutely scrumptious! I used butter flavored Crisco instead of the butter(and three teaspoons of water) and added 3/4 Cup of pecans. I don't know if I make my scones smaller, but I got 2 dozen scones out of this recipe. Instead of one large round of dough I made 3 rounds and cut them into eighths. I can't believe a recipe for scones can get any better than this!!

WOw these are soooo good. I've never made scones before but I can't imagine a recipe that could be better. I split the dough in two parts and added chocolate chips to one and bacon/cheddar cheese to the other. DELICIOUS!

I made these scones this morning subing the cinnamon chips for raisins.  I also added 4T of ground flax seed to try and make up for all that white flour!  I rarely eat scones so I can't really compare to others but it was pretty tasty and filling.  If you make 16 then one per person is really plenty- maybe 2 tops!  I think you definately have to have a hot drink to wash it down because it was like eating a very heavy rich muffin.

These tasted very good. Dough will not hold together if mixed by hand, and I did have to also use 1/4 cup liquid.  Make 4 circles, cut each into 4 wedges and back longer, maybe 20 minutes.

So good! My family ate the entire batch the first day so I made it again the next day!  Instead of rolling it out I just drop them on the cookie sheet - about 2-3 tbsp to make scone cakes.  A definate keeper.

Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.  I don't consider myself a good cook.  I surprised my kids with this one.  I substituted craisins for raisins and in half the batch also added white choclate chips.  The scones were delicious and very easy to make!

These scones were fabulous.  I made them twice now with dried apricots and white chocolate chips.  Everyone went nuts over them.  I will try them with different ingrediants in the future.

I have to agree with the rest, what an amazing recipe. So easy once you get the hang of crumbly dough :-) I divided the dough and made 1/2 blueberry, and the other half I simply sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I'll be making these often.

Delicious!  I made an apricot ginger scone variation (mimicing a favorite from a local tea house) and it was delectable.  Should I ever open a B&B, these are going on the menu!

This is the best scone recipe I have ever made and I have tried many.  It can be customized with any additions.  My favorite is to add a cup of dried chopped apricots in place of the raisins.

These are great. I have been looking for a scone recipe that tastes like the bakery by my house. They make the worlds best white chocolate cranberry scones, that is until I found this recipe. This is now the only way I will ever eate these. I added 1 c crasins and 1 c white chocolate chips, next time I will cut the sugar in half though. Quite a bit sweet for scones. I will be making these quite often.

Moist, sweet, flaky, tasty. Howver, not *exactly* like a scone should taste - this tastes more cake-like and is a tad too sweet. Also, I had to bake them far longer than the suggested 15 minutes. Like other users, I was able to divide the dough into four pieces and quarter each of them for 16 scones instead of 12. Next time, I will use 1/2-3/4 of the sugar, and try it with low-fat sour cream; I will also bake at 425 degrees for a faster bake time.

I had never made scones before.  These turned out very good.  They are quite buttery which tastes great.  Even my picky 8 year old wanted seconds and for me to make more the following day.

I think these are fantastic- super easy and yummy. 
One comment I have: some people complain that even though they followed the recipe, it ended up crumbly. This might have to do with where you are located- perhaps baking soda and powder both are reactives... and mixing at either very high or low altitudes may be making a difference? Interesting thought, anyway- is there anyone who knows better about this? I may be totally off. 
Anyway-
Melting the butter is a good way to get a little more moisture in the mix.

AMAZING!  I never knew that I actually *liked* scones...all I had tasted before were the dried out, tasteless versions for sale at various "insert famous name here" bookstore cafes.
But THESE...these were flaky, buttery, subtly sweet and incredibly delicious.
I did not have raisins, so I substituted cranberries, but that was the only thing I changed.  Next time I made add some orange zest and make a "cranberry -orange" variation...maybe even a "lemon-poppyseed" combo too.  Oh, lest I forget...I served this warm with "mock clotted cream" and blackberry jam.
Incredible!

These are absolutely the BEST! Thank you, thank you. I hosted a high tea this afternoon for my friend's birthday and these were a big hit. My husband has asked me to make more. (He loved them.) I served them with strawberry jam, pumpkin butter and the "Easy Devonshire Cream" from this site. 
I divided the dough into 2 parts, flattened them into circles, and cut them into wedges. Each part yielded 8 scones. They were the perfect size and shape. 

Thanks Rob!

Delicious and easy. I made to give as a hostess gift. Followed other reviewers' advice and made 2 rounds of 8 pieces each- I did one with craisins and the other with chocolate chips. Will make again.

Yum! I love these scones! I took the advice of those who came before me and divided the recipe into two rounds. This worked beautifully for three reasons...one-the scones baked to perfection, two-I was able to make two varieties (chocolate chip sprinkled with cinnamon-sugar and cranberry-orange)and three-they are just the right size serving. We ate them right out of the oven and froze the rest. I will make these again (and again and again..). Thanks Grandma Johnson!

I tried this recipe over the weekend.  It was awesome!  Instead of using 1 c. regular sugar, I used 3/4 c. Splenda and 1/4 c. regular sugar.  These scones are exactly how I like them, moist.  I made a lemon-raspberry, cinnamon-chocolate chip, and orange-cranberry.  The cinnamon-chocochip I dipped the top in a cinnamon-sugar glaze, drizzled a sugar glaze on the cranberry-orange, and sprinkled cinnamon-sugar on the lemon-raspberry.
This recipe is a keeper.

Made this for the first time tonight. We had to put the rest away so we wouldn't eat them right now! Really good. I didn't have cream of tartar, so left that out, but will get some @ the store - I don't think it affected anything though. Also, we split the recipe in half to make 2 circles w/8 pieces each instead of one circle with 12 pieces (those would've been BIG scones).

I make these scones and sell them at my husband's school and people are always telling me how good they are. They are very moistand buttery. Not your typical dry scone. It is very easy to make. I make 2 circles of 8 and top them with chocolate chips, cranberries, blueberries, and rasberries. I drizzle icing sugar on them. I have also used butter crisco for butter and it turns out great. You will love this recipe! Give it a try!

Awesome!!!! I actually messed up with the recipe by adding the baking powder in with the dry ingredients instead of mixing it in with the sour cream..plus I used 3 c flour and 1 c whole wheat flower..it still came out wonderful! I took the advice of others by softening the butter and adding cinnamon sugar...we ate them right out of the oven with some butter and homemade strawberry jam,,,absolutely wonderful! Thanks for this recipe, I'll be making it alot!

I was reading the reviews, and I decided that I had to make them as soon as a puddles started forming on my keyboard.  I used to think that the scones served in my school's caffeteria were the best, but these hand down beats them by a mile.  They were dead easy to make, and like the other reviews say they take 20 minutes to bake.  I also took the advice of others and made two rounds of eight wedges. Perfect size. Well I'm off too print out a recipe for my grandma!! :)

Without question, the best scone recipe I have ever tried.  They're buttery and moist and bursting with raisins.  Everyone for whom I've made them has raved about them.  If you like dry, crumbly scones, though (and some people prefer this type...), these are not the ones for you.  They melt in your mouth.  And you can vary them in so many ways.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is the first scone recipe that I tried and they turned out great.  Even my mom who is somewhat of a scone expert (she is English) loved them.  My favorite is adding a little orange juice and zest.  Love them!

These scones are fantastic!  I made them this morning and I am still in awe over how well they turned out!  I divided my dough into 3 batches as recommended by reviewers.  I added orange craisins to one batch, cinnamon chips to another, and mini chocolate morsels to the last.  They were all delicious!! I also made the Easy Devonshire Recipe to go with the scones.  Boy, I was in heaven !  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe Rob!

I made this recipe for a breakfast party at work.  I found the recipe to be easy, and fast to complete.  I did make one change. I added 2 tbs of  vanilla instant pudding mix, a friend of mine suggested the change and it made the scones even moister!   I rolled them out and cut them with a fluted biscuit cutter instead of making them into the suggested shape. I sprinkled some with sugar and left some plain.  They were a HUGE hit!  Thanks to Grandma Johnson for teaching this recipe with her family, and Koodos to the writer who was willing to share such a good recipe!

This scone recipe is the best.  Light, moist and rich schones are the result.  I had no difficulty with this recipe...I used it for a tea party and got rave comments even though I forgot to put in the cream of tartar.

I have made this recipe two times, splitting the dough in half to add extra ingredients.  I favored using a combination of mini chocolate chips and chopped up white chocolate chips.  This recipe definitely needs sprucing up.  I guess I'm just not a "scone" type of gal!

I served these scones at an afternoon tea bridal shower and they were a hit.  I also tried them out beforehand and brought samples to work...also a hit.  Yummy!

I made these quickly as "drop" scones instead of rolling them out. They were fluffy and wonderful without the raisins, and I look forward to including them next time (or chocolate chips, craisins, nuts, etc.).

Splendiferous!!!!  This is a great recipe and so easily adapted to different flavors.  I split the dough in half and cut each round into eight wedges to extend the recipe.  I've been very happy with how these hold up to freezing, too.  That way, I can hold back part of each batch and just warm them briefly before serving them.

This was my first time making scones and they were so delicious! Just for fun, I used 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of raisins instead of a whole cup of raisins...will definitely make these again!

Hands down, the finest scones I've ever baked.  I rarely deviate from original recipes, but I used a bit of whole wheat flour with excellent results.  Superb -- on par with bakery and coffee house scones.

Definitely my idea of a scone.  The scones were sweet and had a good crumb.  Big hit at work.I used unbleached flour and unsalted butter.  Also add dried sour cherries to the butter/flour mixture and then added the liquid.  I too turned these into smaller triangles, but I divided the dough in half and patted the dough into a circle and cut the circle into eigths.  Thanks Rob and Grandma Johnson for a great recipe.

Excellent recipe!!! I've never cared for scones as any i've had were dry and crumbly. Not these! I got rave reviews from my family and my husbands friends on the job site loved them. I had to make them an extra batch. Definitely a keeper!

This scone recipe was a hit at our house.  We prefer the scone that is sweet and not so dry, and this was IT!.  A big hit with the kids.  Definitely will add it to my favorites list.  It's a good idea to divide the scones up between TWO baking sheets (wasn't clear in the directions); won't fit on one very nicely.  YUM!

I have never made scones before and only just tried one recently.  I'm not very good at rolling out dough, so I wasn't sure how they would come out.  I was pleasantly surprised.  They tasted really good.  I did however have to cook them close to 30 minutes.

A wonderfully moist scone! With No sour cream in my refrigerator, I had to substitute with plain yogurt. Besides decreasing a few calories, the yogurt worked out quite well. Also, I did use Golden Raisins—these are more moist which I personally prefer over the darker varieties. My family & friends loved the finished product!

I followed the directions in the FEB/MAR 2020 edition of the printed magazine - 400 degrees, and I used dried blueberries.  I brushed them with cream and sprinkled with raw cane turbinado sugar.  My wife commented that they were much better than the ones I usually make - I agree.  Best scones I've ever had.

Mmmm...I love this recipe so much that I made them for Christmas morning! I've made them 10 - 12 times over the Holidays. Everybody loves them!! Most of the time I made half batches so I made them more often. I always use frozen butter and cut it into the flower mixture. Sometimes, I split the half batch again and put raisins in half and cranberry relish in the other.  The cranberry relish ones are a bit more moist dough, but cook up the same. Thank You for sharing Grandma Johnson's Scones recipe!

Recipe was simple and easy dough gets super thick I recommend using a mixer if possible. I substituted raisins for cranberries and added a light glazed drizzle. They were delicious.

I made mine with cranberries and they were the perfect sweetness and they were more biscuit than cookie. Will definitely make again!

Excellent! I would make it again but pat into 2 smaller circles instead of 1 large one. Would also be good with craisins or blueberries

First time to make scones. Followed recipe exactly, and they turned out perfectly delicious. Thank you for this recipe. Lemon curd is the ideal complement.

The scones itself were alright, but the raisins threw it off. It needed more sugar, and also chocolate chips would have been good.

Followed what another reviewer recommended and added the egg to the sour cream mixture  along with 1 teaspoon of vanilla. At the end, added orange zest from 2 oranges and 1 cup of dried cranberries (omitted the raisins). Once the scones were cooled drizzled an orange glaze made of 1/2 cup icing sugar, 1 tbsp orange juice, and 1/2 tsp orange zest over the scones. Next time if using a glaze on the scones would reduce the sugar in the scone recipe to 3/4 cup so that they don't get too sweet with a glaze added to them.

These are great but VERY buttery. Next time I will definitely use less butter. The only thing I had trouble with in making the scones was incorporating the sour cream and egg. I used a plastic spatula but eventually had to switch to a wooden spoon because it wasn't mixing enough. I thought I had put in too much flour at first, but it ended up looking like the video once I switched. I strongly recommend using a wooden spoon at the sour cream and egg step, but other than that they were great!

I followed the directions step by step and thought it was too dry at the kneading stage.  Tried to clump it together on a tray.  Added some milk wash and sugar to one tray in the hopes of saving them.  Turns out, they were delicious.  Next time, I'll be more careful mixing the dry and the wet ingredients to better incorporate all of it.  The flavors were spot on.  This is a keeper.

I have been using this recipe for years and love it. While I am known for adjusting recipes I found no need to change this one. These are moist and quite tasty. Try your own stir in ideas as this is a great base recipe for various flavored scones.

These were so good! I did what some of the others recommended. Reduced the sugar a bit. Divided the dough and did  one with chocolate  chips, the other with cranberry, orange zest and cinnamon.  Extras to put in the freezer.

This is basically foolproof if you measure the ingredients carefully. I made them with orange zest and thawed, chopped cranberries. My baking time was 22 minutes, so I concur with several other reviews. I found it was important to make sure the scones were uniformly sliced and of the same thickness to bake evenly. I cut them smaller, so it yielded 24 scones, and they’re plenty big. I can’t wait to try these with additional flavors.

These scones really. are the best. I’ve been making them for over 15 years. I use craisins that I chop up & soak in orange juice for an hour or so. I divide the dough in half & make 2 rounds. I cut each round into 8 wedges. I brush with egg wash & lightly sprinkle with sugar before baking. **NOTE: do NOT over bake or they’ll dry out, cook just until edges are slightly golden.

These are amazing! I've made blueberry lemon, almond raisin, and cranberry orange.  I've made the recipe to make 12-14 large scones and 24-30 small ones. The only thing I noticed is that they need a little more baking time than recommended.  

A tip...mix in the wet ingredients and then let it sit for five minutes before rolling out. Much easier to work with.

I didn't make any changes. However it tastes more like cake rather than scones. It was crunchy outside and soft inside. My daughter likes them anyway. A bit sweet as well with flaky crust. Thanks

These scones are amazing.  Some tips - the butter needs to be COLD.  I use a food processor to cut mine into the flour (put about half the flour/sugar mix into the processor, slice up all the butter into 1tbsp chunks and add them to the flour, then pulse until butter is cut in to desired size).  Also, once you add the sour cream and egg, if the mixture seems TOO dry or crumbly,  press it into a big mound in the bowl and let it rest for 3-4 minutes.  I generally add toffee or cinnamon chips at this stage, then knead dough to incorporate the chips, then roll out.

Awesome!!! It worked really well, one thing, don't overmix it! If you do, they won't be as light or flakey as a traditional scone, but they will still taste really good.

The recipe is VERY DRY! I had to put the whole mess back in the bowl and sprinkle some water just to get it to stick together. By then, it was overworked. I think I will just go to Panera next time.

This is my first time making this recipe.   It is the best I’ve ever made. Light and fluffy and flavor is awesome.  I accidentally used two eggs instead of one and it still turned out awesome.  The texture is amazing. I also used the tin foil on the pan. Easy clean up.  Awesome.  Will make again.

They did surprise even me: I love scones but I am usually defending them against detractors who are perpetually saying that scones are not really cakes, not really bread, not really worth the effort, not really satysfying enough and so on and so on. So yes, I am a regular scones champion, but this recipe brought them over the top. I just wanted to make this batch as plain as possible, I was in a hurry, I checked the pantry and no raisins, my husband was putting pressure as we were to go out... a culinary disaster in the making!  but oh my, these were no fuss and sooo gooood!!! instead of raisins I only had a mix of dried cranberries and raspberries, and didn't remember to add them till the dough was ready and packed. Maybe all this heartburn was the reason of the success of this recipe: minimum handling and baking. They were perfect, everyone was marveling on the light texture and the wonderful flakiness. Can't wait to try not all the fancy different combinations (lemon orange, white choc, and cinnamon, apples, and so on) only but strawberry jam and cream even.

I've never made scones but these turned out delicious. I did follow Lulu Mash's instructions from her review.  I brought them to a tea and the recipe was requested.  I will make these again.

I made these today and they turned out great!! My husband and I both agreed they were the best I've ever made!  To clarify with some other reviewers, the butter definitely must be cold and not room temperature (cold butter is standard for all scones).  I'm on vacation and didn't have cream of tartar and they still turned out great. I will make these again when I get home to see if they turn out much different with cream of tartar.  I divided the dough in half, made orange/craisin and chocolate/walnut, both were delicious!

Awesome! Nice crust bits but moist on the inside. Reduced the sugar a bit and tried it with orange zest and raisins. Beats Starbucks Orange Cranberry  Scones! The video was very helpful..realized I have to leave some whole bits of butter and to not overmix

These are always a favorite, made these for sensitive stomachs (gluten free flour, dairy free sour cream, non-dairy chocolate chips and non-dairy butter) and they turned out really well! A little crumblier than usual but not too dry, I'm guessing that's because of the non-dairy butter instead of regular salted butter, but the receiving audience were just happy they could have homemade scones again.

Found the dough a bit dry...added about 3 tablespoons of half and half...they were outstanding...very much like I remember from tea at Huntington Gardens in California.  My English husband gave them 5 stars.

I'm an avid bake but have never made scones before. I found this recipe and decided to try it. Delicious! I took many other reviewers' advice and divided this recipe in thirds. The first one I added craisins, zest from one orange, a 1/4 tsp vanilla, and a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cloves and ground ginger. This was my favorite! The second one I added 1/4 tsp of lemon flavoring and zest from one lemon. This was my husband's favorite!  And the third one I added some mini chocolate chips and chopped almonds. This was also very good but we both thought this tasted more like a chocolate chip cookie. I followed the basic recipe as written but I will admit to adding more sour cream as I just couldn't get it to combine well without it.  Will definitely make these again!

Excellent recipe!  It's too sweet for me, though, which is why I'm rating it 4 stars. The second time I used 3/4 cup sugar, and it was still too much.  I add orange or lemon zest and extract to the sour cream/baking soda/egg mixture and stir that  into the dry ingredients along with the raisins or craisins. That  way you don't overwork the dough incorporating everything. It might be my oven, or the fact that I like mine a little thicker than the photo, but mine take 20 minutes to bake!

This was my first attempt at making scones and I'm so glad I tried this recipe!  We made half of the dough with raisins and added a few dark chocolate chips; used blueberries on the other half and they were delicious also.

Don't listen to the reviews that tell you to have butter at room temp.  It goes against every rule of a scone.  Those reviewers are making muffins.    Cold butter cut in small pieces then pulse in food processor with the flour  then take your fingers and flatten out butter.  (  biscuit method ).  They will turn out very fluffy   Give them plenty of room on cookie sheet  they do grow.

These were as easy as making cookies! I made these exactly as the recipe. I added craisins for raisins and left some plain. After they came out of the oven I brushed with milk and put powdered sugar on the craisin ones and regular sugar on the plain ones.  My husband loved them and they were very flaky as I followed the instructions and cut very cold butter into the dry mix with a pastry cutter.  I did freeze some for later. Thank you so much! I love scones because they aren't so sweet. These were the best!!  I have to try craisins with lemon glaze and slivered almonds next time. Yum. Seriously, you can't go wrong with these!

I added cinnamon chips and any nuts I had on hand instead of the raisins. They turned out so good. This is a great base scone, I'm excited to try them with berries or chocolate chips, pumpkin. Really, I don't see how it could turn out bad. Easy and delicious.

This is a great recipe, I just want to recommend one thing. When I first made this recipe and cut it into 12 pieces, they were waay too big and wouldn't cook all the way through.  Instead when I make this recipe I cut the dough in half, and then cut eight wedges out of each circle.  It works perfectly!  No one else seems to have had this problem, but I wanted to mention it.

Tip: freeze butter then use your grater if you don't have food processor to cut butter into dry mix. First time making and These scones are absolutely amazing. I had added some blueberries that I had in the freezer instead of raisins they came out perfect.

Very yummy. Very easy to make. I opted out if the raisens and stuck to basic. I put a little milk and demarrA sugar on top that added a delicious crust layer on top. Only complaint was they were a bit sweet like a cake but still scrumptuous. Next time i will try either less sugar , omiting the egg or both. Either way im sure they will be delicious. Ate them with mascarpone and raspberry jam. I do end up with a min. 20 minute baking time to be done.

These turned out delicious. I think I made mine too thick as it took about double the time to cook. They were still flaky and yummy. I used craisins instead. Totally recommend this recipe!

Love these, it makes a lot so I froze half and baked the other half into two inch rounds. We topped with home made preserves and my son ate 3 in one sitting.  I make them plain and add toppings after baking.

These were great! I added a teaspoon of cinnamon in the batter to make cinnamon raisin scones, which worked nicely. The only thing I would do different next time would be to cut them smaller b/c they were pretty big. Also, I will brush them w/ egg or milk and sprinkle w/ sugar before baking to make them look prettier. The taste and texture are fantastic and I look forward to making other flavors~YUM

I found this in the 2002 Hall of Fame collection and had to make it.  We loved it, I thought that it was a tad sweet, and may cut back on the sugar next time around.  Great breakfast scone!

Such a great recipe! Very versatile. I added a cinnamon sugar swirl but honestly I think I like them better with just the original recipe. However it would be a great base to make a variety of flavors with. It's a good sweet recipe that's not overbearingly 
sweet.

I didn't have any sour cream so I substituted one cup of vanilla yogurt mixed with a teaspoon of baking soda. I followed every other part of the recipe, and the scones were fantastic!

Just made this! I grated the cold butter into the flour mixture. Also added 1 tsp orange peel.  It turned out very well, but you really have to work the butter into the flour even after you put on counter to knead!  It appeared to be a pile of crumbles at first!

I have made this recipe several times. We really like it a lot. I make it as instructed. I usually add Craisins and orange zest. I have also added turbinado sugar or a glaze on top, too. I like them a little sweeter. 
You really do need to "cut in" the butter. You aren't supposed to cream it with the sugar. Cutting it in gives you the layers. Also, don't over mix the dough. When I make them, the texture is a lot like a soft, fluffy biscuit. They are so good warm out of the oven.

This is my favorite scone recipe. I've been making it for years, usually subbing finely chopped dried cherries and candied ginger for the raisins. If I add more than the suggested one cup of dried fruit, i.e. 1/2 cup ginger and 1 cup cherries, then the dough becomes quite crumbly. Adding 1tsp of milk (or another liquid, like vanilla extract)  before kneading solves the problem. Bottom line: add 1tsp liquid for every extra 1/2 cup of dried fruit. Enjoy!

This is my first time making scones. Really is an easy recipe. I made several batches and substituted raisins with blueberries, craisins, and choc. chips. All were very good!  Before baking I sprinkled the top with large sugar crystals for a little extra sweetness and it looks nice. I also used another reviewers suggestion and made breakfast scones with shredded cheddar cheese and bacon. They were very good as well! I used 12 oz of bacon and shredded my cheese fine. I didn't measure the cheese so it may have been 1 c. Next time I will increase the bacon to at least 16 oz and shred the cheese using the bigger holes. I also only added 1/2 c. sugar in the breakfast scones and will use maybe 1/3 c. next time to cut the sweetness a bit. I only made 1/2 of each batch and froze the rest, before baking, so all I need to do is get a few out and bake for fresh scones anytime.

The best! Make sure you don't mix it to much. It needs to be worked with 2 knives...then, 2 hands! The less air in the dough, the more "pâte brisée", the better. I use orange zest and dried cranberries instead of raisins.

Not Bad. It wasn't the perfect recipie but everyone thought it still tasted good. It came out of the oven soggy and we had to bake it a little longer although I don't know what made it so soggy. Instead of adding raisins I added blueberry's  which I think made it taste a little better.

Extremely easy.  Keeps well for a day or two if you put them in a sealed container.  I have had issues with other scone recipes being too dry and crumbly, but these were nice and moist.  I used currants instead of raisins.

This recipe is fantastic as written. It has a very light sweetness that is perfect if you don't want something overpowering. the texture is slightly lighter than bakery scones I have had. I rolled in frozen blueberries and they worked great. I'm looking forward to trying other fillings.

I have discovered that, what Americans consider a scone, bears little resemblance to a traditional English or Scottish scone.  If you've had scones at your local coffee house, farmer's market, or bakery, this is probably a pretty close copy. If you've had tea at Harrod's in London, this scone is not even close.  These scones are sweeter and more cake-like; traditional scones are more like a dense biscuit, that's not really very sweet. That's not a criticism of this recipe, but of most scone recipes I've found. So, while this is not the recipe I was searching for, my kids are thrilled I've found this one- they love the lemon blueberry version, with a lemon glaze on top. It's exactly like the one they get from the farmer's market.

Wonderful scones!  We used to have a Tea Room in Acton, Maine and served the best scones ( as we were told) by our customers.  I think these tie.  Followed the recipe exactly as written except for the ''optional'' raisins as we had some dried cherries we wanted to use.  Can't make these too often or wont be able to fit into our clothes.  They are that good!

It is great receip. I never make any scones before and this is the first time I made it with two flavours, rasins and chocolate chips. It is a great success and my daughter says they are much better than these she bought from the store. Thanks grandma Johnson for sharing this great receipe.

I've made this recipe dozens of times now, and love it as-is or completely altered: less sugar, more sugar, chocolate chips, berries, cinnamon, etc.. I freeze my butter for about 10 minutes beforehand and grate it into the flour mixture with a cheese grater, then cut the butter in briefly with my fingers; it's faster than using a pastry cutter and keeping the butter cold seems to help keep the scones from spreading too much.  All four of my teenagers love these scones, which is a miracle in itself!

Great recipe. I was out of sour cream but had buttermilk. It worked fantastic. I just did 2/3 cup of buttermilk instead of 1 cup sour cream. It irritates me when people improvise recipes but in this case I was in a pinch and it worked! I thought they tasted great and not too sweet like others have mentioned.

My scones turned out flat like big cookies. However, I'm sure the problem is the cook not the recipe. I added an extra half cup of sugar like some of the other reviews suggested and I threw in a teaspoon of orange zest. They tasted great! Not much like scones though. I'll try them again if I can figure out why they didnt rise. I don't think I'll add the extra sugar next time because I don't think scones are supposed to be that sweet. I gave it 4 stars because 1.) I'm really not sure what the directions mean by "knead lightly" and 2.) the recipe was way harder than it sounded. About half way through I found myself wishing I hadn't gotten myself into this. Lol! 3.) working with flour is a mess! I'll probably try it again though because I like scones. :)

Update: I made these in my Kitchen Aid mixer using the flat mixer attachment. They mixed up nicely. This time I brushed them with milk before baking.  I increased the temperature to 375 & baked 18 minutes. They browned nicely but still seem a little sweet for my taste. (Original review - I make scones frequently. I made these exactly as recipe states except I used dried cranberries instead of raisins & I rolled the dough & cut with 3" cookie cutters.  The bottoms did brown nicely as stated in the recipe but the tops remained absolutely white and the scones did not rise at all while baking. These were very good...light and buttery. But to me, there are better, easier, less time consuming scone recipes.)

This is soooo good. Although I have made some changes on the recipe. I have halved the ingredients (except egg, I used 1 whole egg and reduced sugar by using only 1/3 cup of it. I don't like my scone to be too sweet and cakery) and these gives me a full tray of scones. I leave out the cream of tartar as i don't have it at home. used a mixture of the dry berries and chopped pecan and cashew. Pecan tastes amazing in the scone. It gives a extra crunch and texture to the scone.  I fold it couple of times to create layers, baked in 400 degree F for 16 mins. (i cut my scone think so it create the height nicely.)

Made exactly as stated the first time = 4 stars.  With changes, I believe it'll be 5 stars.  One thing I can't stand is cutting in butter!  Next time I will use softened butter, 1 tsp vanilla, and craisins or something of that sort.  Ended up mixing with my hand cos spatula wasn't getting it done.  Roll into 18 balls and press flat with hand.

Awesome!  I used coconut sugar instead of white ans I did used room temperature butter.  They came out exactly as the ones I tried from a French Bakery store a while ago and I couldn't replicate.  I know now why!  
I've made them cutting the frozen butter  and all that but this time these ones are the ones people are waiting for me to bake!

we've made this several times and love them! (My husband swears they have crack in them because they are so addictive. LOL)
We use the base recipe, and just change the fruit fillings. My favorite is cranberries with orange peel. My husband loves the raisin scones, but he'll start swiping mine after inhaling his.

These came out beautifully, though were more like tiny cakes than scones. I live in Idaho, so maybe that has something to do with the consistency, but they were not at all dry. They really were like eating the sweetest, most moist biscuit. They were more dense than cake, but very soft and fall-apart in your mouth wonderful.
What I did was add some lemon zest to the sour cream mixture and let it set for an extra 10 min. I tore off a small amount of finished dough and flattened it with my fingers. Then I added as many fresh, plump blueberries as I could fit on top, then added another flattened dough disc. I gently pushed them together and turned the disc while squeezing the sides until they resembled inch thick biscuits. Baked for 18 minutes (and they really could have been in there for 20). Recipe yielded 11 5-inch "scones."

I've made these scones many times and they are always a big hit.  In a pinch I have used yogurt in place of the sour cream and it worked just fine.  I always add a teaspoon or so of vanilla.  Sometimes I use raisins and sometimes I use dried cranberries.  I also cut each triangle scone into three, making them more like cookie size.  I usually drizzle icing on top, not always.  Yummy!

I cut this recipe in half and it ended up being a little dry, but I'm sure that is my fault somehow. In trying to keep the dough together I think I also over-kneaded it. Delicious though!

I tried this for my daughter's birthday tea and they were a hit. My step daughters even loved them and they are scone lovers.  I didn't have sour cream so I substituted nonfat greek yogurt. I added a splash of oj and a couple of drops of Do'terra Wild Orange and cranberries.  they came out great.  I am making 2 batches now so I can freeze 1/2.  I used my food processor to cut in the butter, they came out perfect!

This recipe is soo delicious! You can add to it and make any kind of scones you want. I thawed some frozen blackberries mixed them in with the sour cream and added dash of vanilla. They came out so perfect. Follow the recipe on the recommended thickness 3/4 in. Be careful not to make them too thick or its hard to cook them through with out getting the edges to done.

Great recipe, first time I have made scones. I will definitely be making these again. I tried to make them healthier but still took into account other's edits, and this is what I came up with:

1 1/4 cup sugar
NO sour cream, instead used 2 single-serve 0% fage greek yogurts
Only used 1 stick of UNSALTED butter instead of 2

If you are making orange/cranberry: Add about 1 cup of dried cranberries & a shy 1/2 cup orange juice to mix. Made a glaze for the top with orange juice, milk, powdered sugar & cinnamon. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon & 1/4 teaspoon of cloves to the dough, although my fiancé did not like that. It is a matter of preference but as the "household scone expert," he told me cinnamon has no place in a cranberry/orange scone. Up to you!

These are wonderful. People who don't like scones loved these. Divided dough into 3 bowls and made 3 flavors: vanilla with mini chocolate chips and demarra sugar on top, dried cherry with almond and then conf sugar/cherry preserves brushed on top after cool, and dried cranberries with OJ/orange peel and then conf sugar/oj/orange peel brushed on top when cool. The orange was awesome. After I mixed each flavor, I shaped dough into a round of each flavor and cut each round into 8 triangles. Dough is very forgiving. Even 2 days later, kept in lock top plastic bags, these were good. Just make 'em!!

Absolutely fabulous!  Divide dough and make two disks, otherwise they are too large. That also allows you to make two different flavors!  My favorite is fresh blueberry dusted with powdered sugar.

These scones were delicious! I read reviews and I decided to add a couple new things, I added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I really think these were great!

This is great! I used organic spelt flour, and used organic cane sugar, and chocolate chips. This is a family favorite and I make this often!

I can't rate these fairly as is, because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. When I read from some reviewers that the texture was more like a "muffin", I didn't want that. I wanted more of a crisp, crumbly texture. One reviewer recommended omitting the egg so as not to get that muffin kind of texture, so that's what I did differently.  Instead of the egg, I added 1/4 cup of milk in its place.  The dough was indeed very crumbly and hard to work with, but the end result was good, though still not as "dry" as I would have liked.  My husband LOVES them.  I added fresh blueberries instead of the raisins and baked them for 25 minutes (they are big).  I also gave them a quick brushing of egg white and a dusting of some course grained sugar on the top before baking, and that added a nice touch.

We made these this morning with chocolate chips instead of raisins. Overall they were really good. I tend to like things a bit sweeter so next time I will press the cut scone dough in some raw sugar before they bake to make them slightly sweeter and add some crunch. Also unless we made them tiny (about the size of my hand)the quantity it makes is off. We got about 28 scones out of this recipe.

First time making scones and they were fabulous! I followed other reviewers advice and froze some. I would suggest making smaller quantities as they are not nearly as good the second day.

Just made these as lemon poppyseed. Delicious! I ran out of eggs so used 1T flax seed meal mixed with 3T warm water (let it sit for 10 minutes), and they still came out great! The texture is wonderful. Slightly cake-like, but slightly crumbly. A wonderful scone. Mmmm... this made a lot so I baked half and froze half (raw) to make whenever I want later. I usually make a different recipe that doesn't require sour cream, and now I have two favorites depending on what I have in the fridge.

I was worried at first because the dough was sooo crumbly and wouldn't moisten up.  I had to knead for a while, but the dough came out perfectly in the end!  I rolled the dough into a log shape and sliced it because I was making them for my son's class and wanted smaller portions.  They came out looking like biscuits, but tasting like delicious scones!

We loved these scones.  Did a homeschool unit study on England during the Olympics and used these to accompany tea.  Soooo yummy even without anything on them.  Made ours with blueberries and followed recipe exactly.  Kids kept asking for more.

Best scone recipe I've ever tried!  My husband has asked me to make this almost every weekend using raisins, dried cranberries or chocolate chips.  I actually don't roll the dough out and cut into wedges, but rather just place large scopes of dough on a cookie sheet.  Works fine for me.  Great recipe! Thank you so much for sharing.

I gave this a 4 for taste...either mine didn't turn out right or the recipe isn't quite what I am looking for.  I am used to scones being more dense and well shaped.  However, my scones tended to flatten and were extremely soft and flaky...more like a biscuit, but without the actual crust of the biscuit.  I will try with a denser flour.  Worth making for the flavor...just not quite what I was expecting.

These are amazing! I have now made them with choc chips, mac nuts and white choc, sugar coating, and cranberry orange. The choc chips are everyones favorite followed closly by the sugar coating. Fun to use colored sugar for small scones for a baby shower...they were such a hit!

This recipe is amazing. I was afraid of people who have experienced this scones to be dry but I had no problem at all. They were amazing, not dry and with a great flavor. I guess you have to be careful like with other batters and don't over mix.  I divided the dough in 3  and made them with chocolate, walnuts and frozen berries. The blueberry scones were our favorite. Finished with a glace they were a nice treat in our 4th of July BBQ. Definitely will make this again and will add cheese and bacon for savory breakfast ones!

Wonderfully simple, delicious and filled with endless possibilities. I divide the dough and use different fruits and/or berries. My favorite includes minced dried apricots and slightly chopped sweet coconut flakes. On this one I sprinkle some raw sugar granuals on top prior to baking. With the raisin batch I sprinkle with cinnamon/sugar. No butters and jellies needed to enjoy these. Individually wrapped after baking makes for a great, convenient morning coffee mate or afternoon tea treat. Next experiment will be using blueberries, adding in a cream cheese mixture topped with a yellow cake crumb topping. I did add 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla as suggested in another review. Everyone loves these.

INCREDIBLE! I just pulled my first batch out of the oven and they are so amazing. I followed the recipe except I split my dough into 3 batches. The first batch I added orange zest and dried cranberries, then made a batch with dried blueberries and one with chocolate chips. This recipe is definately a keeper. I'll be making these regularly.

This recipe is great, the main trick is to handle the dough as little as possible for a flaky scone. I added apples and cheddar cheese, they were delicious. Definitely will make again.

Loved these! I added chopped dried apricots instead of raisins and used glaze as someone suggested.
Easy, fast, delicious. Next time (if I have any left), I'll freeze some

As I can't stand sour cream (no, not even in baking), I used plain Mountain High yogurt, but did need to increase the baking time by about 10-15 minutes. I added orange zest and cranberries and they came out fantastic! Definitely will make again. I'm thinking lemon zucchini next time.

Best scone recipe ever, and easy to make. I learned from reviewers and didn't mix/knead dough too much. Used cold butter, cut it into flour mixture, and "mished" with my fingers. Added 1 tsp. almond extract, 1 cup sliced almonds, and 1 cup yellow raisins. Perfect, moist, and repeatable. I thank this site and Rob and all the reviewers! Lots of variations possible with chocolate chips, etc.

Everyone raves about Starbucks' scones but they don't compare to these.  All the people I've given them to have loved them (raisins substituted with cranberries and white chocolate). I've found the recipe to be too sweet, esp when I use white chocolate, so I've halved the sugar and added 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. Otherwise, recipe is awesome.

Definitely easy to follow recipe. Nice flavor a little bland, added vanilla, white chocolate chips and cranberries and i still felt flavor was missing. This recipe makes more than just 12 servings, I cut them in half and the size was still huge.

When I tried making these the dough was so crumbly that it wouldn't hold together to knead. I had to add a little milk.

I’ve been making this for my family for the past 10 to 15 years. I add the zest of one lemon to the batter. Instead of the raisins I had a cup of dried cranberries and chop up half a cup of dried apricots. When the scones are done I top them with a mixture of confectioner sugar with 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice mixed with lemon zest and lime zest to taste. Let cool to room temperature.

I have to say, I was pretty skeptical on this one when I was trying to mix it up.  I could not get all the flour "moistened" in the rest of the ingredients.  I kneaded it probably a lot more than you were suppose to but finally it all came together.  The only changes I made were to use chocolate chips instead of raisins and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I glazed the tops with a bit of powdered sugar, vanilla, milk glaze and they are fabulous.  A definite make again.  I will try cinnamon chips with turbinado sugar or blueberry with turbinado sugar next!

I made these as written and felt they were too sweet and biscuit-y.  So, for my second batch, I lessened the sugar to 3/4 cup and reduced the butter by 2T.  They were still a touch too sweet for my own tastes, but I felt the consistancy had much improved.  I patted my dough on a lightly floured surface and formed a rectangle.  From the rectangle, I cut squares and then sliced each square diagonally to form triangles.  Mine were golden brown on the bottom (and a bit around the edges) after 25 min, but they were still soft.  I left them on the counter, uncovered, overnight and the next morning they were nearly perfect.

This is a delicious, easy scone recipe. I made scones for the first time using this recipe. These scones were better than the ones sold at starbucks. One thing I realized was that this recipe makes A LOT of scones. The next time I make these, I'll be freezing half of the scones. To give more flavor, I brushed maple syrup on the top and sprinkled some pecan nuts on top. YUM!!!

These were incredible. I did substitute craisins for the raisins though. I made them exactly like the recipe except I put them in 2 cake pans because they were crumbly. But turned out perfect. For 2 people I would halve the recipe. Can't wait to make more.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe! They did take 25 minutes to bake. I will try to make individually next time just for change.

DELICIOUS!  I followed KingsHorses pumpkin change below, and thanks to Katmani's advice about spreading them out.  I made the pumpkin with raisins and then 2 small empire apples chopped with lots of cinnamon.  They made a lot though (YAY!) so later I hope to try mixing cranberries & orange juice, and toss nuts in too.  Thank you for a PHENOMENAL recipe!!

very good but i don't think if i made all the changes that were suggested they would have been. I did as someone suggested with adding baking soda to sour cream and setting arsde then mixing butter sugar(i did an extra 1/4 c. of sugar) eggs and 1 T. vanilla and setting aside then mixing all the dry. Add egg/butter/sugar mix to dry then add sour cream. After i cut the dough in half added 1/2c dried cranberries to one half and 1/2 c. chocolate chips to the other to make two different kinds giving me about 8 of each. I shaped them by hand. After they cooled i iced them (1c powder sugar, 2 T. whole milk, and 1/2tsp vanilla; mix and apply with pastry brush) they came out perfect!!!

I didn't even like scones before I tried this recipe. Now it's my favorite and what all of my friends request I make. I accidentally only added half the amount of butter and they still turned out great! I prefer to make them with dried blueberries. Yum!

DELICIOUS! I love this recipe. These scones are easy to make and totally scrumptious with just the right hint of sweetness. Not too dry or bland. I added a couple handfuls of dry fruit mix to mine (mango, cranberry and blueberry) and they were awesome. The whole family is raving about them. Thanks so much!!!

One of the best scones I've ever eaten. I made them with blueberry flavored craisins and sprinkled demerara sugar on the top. They taste best eaten hot from the oven, as they dry out a little when frozen.

This is the only decent scone recipe that I've found--must be the sour cream. It comes out perfect every time. I cut the recipe in half, as it makes a bunch and I live alone. I visited a girlfriend in New Zealand 5 years ago and when I told her I wanted to try some scones, she laughed at the way I pronounced the word. In UK countries in NZ at least), it's pronounced "scon." Didn't know that! Anyway, thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe.  I've never had scones, so I had no idea what to expect.  They were soft and tasted a lot like sugar cookies.  I like that you can customize these with raisins etc. to change it up a bit.  Thanks for the easy recipe.

Decadent!  I followed the advice of being quite careful not to overmix; my scones came out pleasantly moist!  Makes 12 LARGE scones.

I've made these scones a few times, each time to rave reviews!  I do freeze the butter and then process the ingredients in my food processor to make it easier.  First mix all the dry ingredients, add the frozen butter that you have cut up into approx. 6 pieces. Mix well by pulsing the dough until choppy.  Then mix wet ingredients in a separate bowl and add the ingredients together.  

One note - I didn't had sour cream so I used plain yogurt.  They needed more flour and were too sweet.  I wouldn't recommend using that substitute!

Quite good! This was the first time I'd ever made scones. I used frozen mixed berries (blueberries, raspberries, blackberries) and cut the recipe to 4 servings.  They taste delicious and I still ended up with 6 scones! I will make this again.

First of all, I made like 28 scones with this recipe, not 12 and with the small size it took like 25 min at 350 to get it golden brown. Not too impressed with the flavor even though I made it with choc. chips.

Thank you Grandma Johnson - enjoyed these scones.  Combined dry ingrediants and butter in food processor then the rest by hand.  Turned out very nicely.  Would totally make them again.

Search no further!!! These scones are delectable every time! It is impossible to mess-up this recipe. I've tried a dozen recipes, but his one is truly perfect. I have even made exchanges such as plain yogurt to reduce the calorie content, craizins and sugared citrus bits instead of raisins, and this one is a real crowd-pleaser. The butter should not be exchanged, however, as this weakens the recipe.  Thank you Rob, and Grandma Johnson!!!!!

Fantastic.  I have made these a number of times, most recently for the day after Thanksgiving breakfast for the whole family. I like to add b. powder to s.cream and then whisk all dry ingredients.  Next I cut in cold butter, then add egg to s.cream mixture, whisk and gently blend into dry (using my hands after a few mixes).  Finally I add in chopped dried fruit (trader joes mix of cherry, blueberry & strawberry) dump onto floured surface, knead a few times, pat out and cut.  AMAZING my whole family raved & raved and I had to print out the recipe to pass out :)

I made these scones today, they tasted great but they were not exactly what I was looking for.  They were very light and fluffy.  A little cake-like.  I was hoping for a more dense and flaky scone.  I followed the directions exactly and I think that this recipe just produces scones are just lighter and fluffier.  Like I said they taste excellent, just not exactly what I was expecting or looking for.  Also, the dough became hard to work with when it was time to cut and shape them.  The dough was very sticky and a little too soft to really be able to cut into them.  I read another review on another scone recipe and it said that after you add the wet to the dry ingredients to put the mixture in the freezer for a few minutes to get the butter to solidify a bit before cutting.  I will try that next time, although I will probably try it with another recipe as I just want a more dense and flaky scone.  Good recipe though.

I really like the versatility of this recipe.  I made my first batch with lots of spices.  They do become soft if you store them together in a cookie tin or other airtight container.  I am still looking for a recipe or way to make scones that stay dry and crunchy on the outside, as that's the texture I prefer.

Such a good recipe. I served it with fresh homemade lemon curd. Needless there are none left! Will be making a few make-ahead batches to keep in the freezer for on-demand scones. PS lemon curd can be frozen too so all is well in our kitchen.

I have made these with frozen blueberries and also freeze-dried blueberries, didn't make any changes to the recipe, and they always come out wonderfully.  This is the first and last scone recipe I will ever use, they are delicious and the texture is great.

Great recipe! I`m from Germany and when I was in NYC a couple of month ago, I bought a Starbucks Scone. It was delicious, and so I decided to try them at home. So I found this recipe. First it was a bit difficult to find out what 'creme of tatar' means in german. But then I googled it and found the word: 'Weinstein' or 'Weinsäure'.   I also added chopped apples, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and vanilla flavor. I think because of the apples my scones were a little too squashy.

I tried this recipe and was quite pleased with it. The scones were moist and tasty but slightly different texture then most scones. I used 1 cup of brown flour and 3 cups white flour, also substituted white sugar for brown sugar. I split the dough and added orange zest and raisins to one batch and added mixed berries (blueberry, raspberries and blackberries) and lemon zest to other batch. Both varieties were very good. I will make it again and may substitute 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the flour for oatmeal next time, if they are supposed to be for breakfast then they should have some nutritional tweaks I think!

These are amazing.  Thanks a bunch!  I halved the dough.  I mized one batch with almonds, cranberries, and orange zest.  For the other half, I mixed chocolate chips, almonds, and some almond extract.  I added about 1/4 more sugar to the recipe.  This is great and thanks for sharing.

I cut the recipe in half and used frozen blueberries instead of raisins, about 3/4 cup.  I also added coarse sugar to the tops of the scones.  I baked the scones in a cast iron "scone pan" in the oven.  This cooking method added about 20 minutes to the cook time.  My husband prefers the more crumbly, shortbread-like scones.  While these were delicious, the texture was more cake-like.

Since I haven't made scpnes before, I am rating mostly the ease of this recipe. it is super easy, I just pressed the dough together briefly instead of rolling it out & cut smaller pieces (24 not 8). The taste is good as well. Tasty! I will use lemon, orange & chocolate chips the next time. Thanks for sharing!

BEST SCONES EVER!!!!!! mmmm. These are so good nice and moist. Which I find a lot of scones are dry which draws me away from them. Perfect sweetness. i added some dried cherries. Perfect. Next time i think I'll also add some orange or lemon zest!

We loved them! I substituted dried cherries and white chocolate chips for the raisins (about 3/4 c. each). Also brushed with egg wash and sprinkled with demerara sugar because we like that crunchy top. I use a metal dough scraper to cut them into twelfths, works great. Also use a non-stick liner, so don't have to grease the pan. As other reviewers noted, handle the dough as little as possible, knead only until it all comes together, then press into a large even circle before cutting. Thanks for the great recipe!

I had never made scones before, and Ijust made these and they are quite good. I added 1 tbsp of pure orange extract and some pecans and almonds to the dough, and they came out perfectly soft, crumbly, and very tasty. Give this one a try; it is fool-proof, even for a novice like myself.

I made it exactly as the recipes says, and it was perfect. If you want to try other add-ins besides the raisins, try craisins or blueberries.

Very good recipe, but not overwhelmingly great.  I found these scones to be more like biscuits (as in bisquick) in texture and flavor instead of the scones I'm used to, which is slightly drier and more firm.  That may just be my prejudice due to my previous favorite scone recipe, though.  Don't let my review deter you from making these - I've made several batches and I can attest that adding any of these things to the scone recipe works great:  Fresh blueberries, fresh raspberries, currants, diced apple (add a little cinnamon to the recipe for apples), and maple/brown sugar topping (mix brown sugar with good quality maple syrup until a very thick paste is made, depress scone in the middle with a spoon to create a dent and fill with maple/brown sugar mixture. Bake as normal, but be careful, the mixture will run. Yum!)

I don't think I'll ever buy a scone again!  These were great, cakey scones - I made one with mini-choc chips and orange zest and another with lemon zest and fresh raspberries.  For the raspberries, I rolled out the dough, laid the raspberries out across half of the dough and folded over.  They came out with the berries in the middle just like Starbucks.

Pretty good. Not what I was expecting. Expected a dense texture. I added a tsp of lemon juice and some fresh blueberries. I probably won't make again. IMO, it was a lot of effort for mediocre results. Will look for another recipe.

This scone recipe is great!  Sometimes I like more texture, so I use a little cornmeal in place of some flour.  I also use dried dates (chopped) instead of raisins--good!

These are so yummy.  Split the batch into 2.  Made half with chocolate chips and the other with cranberries.  To avoid over-mixing, after combining ingredients, flatten dough into a disk and spread on filling.  Fold in half and then in half again.  Form into a disk and using a pizza cutter, cut into wedges. My 6 yo had a blast helping and eating!

These are fantastic.  Like another reviewer I did an orange spice with vanilla extract, orange extract, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger, I was out of cinnamon.  I also added in raisins. Fantastic!

These scones come out so moist and are so changeable. I bought dried cherries and an orange and added the zest of half and orange and 1 tsp of orange juice along with 2/3 a cup of dried cherries and they came out deliciously. The sour cream really does the trick. Do not over moisten.

These were great.  They turned out moist and fluffy.  However, I made the mistake of adding some thawed bluberries we had picked a couple months ago.  The first couple batches were fine but by the end my scones were purple from all the burst blueberries!  But they were still delicious!  Next time I might just use chocolate chips or cranberries though.  :)  I used the Easy Devonshire Cream recipe from this site to go with.  People raved!  Thank you.

Heavenly is all I can say.  This is my first attempt at scones and I am well pleased.  They are light and flavorful.  I did add the teaspoon of vanilla and a little sugar on top, but did everything else as written.  I can't wait to try these again with other things mixed in.

These are the best scones I've had!  I added orange zest to the dry ingredients, and let it infuse for about 45 minutes before continuing, and they turned out sooo scrumptious!  (No raisins).

I just made these for my husband's birthday and they were a huge hit! I stuck to the original recipe; no need to adorn them with anything fancy- they're perfect just the way they are. I did freeze them overnight and baked in the morning at 350 degrees for 40 minutes. Yum!

Very good and versatile.  Made several batches with different flavorings (Raspberry & orange, chocolate chip, blueberry & lemon).  Got rave reviews from friends and family.  Very moist.

Fantastic!! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added 1 tsp. of vanilla and the flavour was great! I split the batter and added fresh blueberries to one half and mini chocolate chips to the other ... both were really good. I can't wait to experiment with other fruit and flavours! The scone itself is quite sweet,I may cut back on the sugar especially if using fruit in season. Thanks so much for the recipe!!

Prepared the recipe as written.  Divided the dough in half.  Made choc. chip scones and blueberry.  HOLY COW GOOD!  Grandma Johnson's recipe is a total keeper!!  Took a bit longer than specified in the recipe but worth the wait!!

Delicious! They were the perfect mixture of soft and crumbly.  I made them on Mother's Day and they were a huge hit.  I added cranberries to this batch. I will be making these again.

These are by far the best scones I have ever tasted!  I used 1/2. raisins and a 1/2 c. chopped dates which I cooked in 1/2c. water until absorbed.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  DELICIOUS!

This recipe is wonderful! One thing I changed was I used a cup of vanilla yogurt instead of the sour cream. They were to die for! Thanks for the great recipe!

These were AWESOME!!! So moist, and I totally believe that it's due to the sour cream!!!  I split the dough into two, added some vanilla bean and made a batch of Choc Chip Scones, and a batch of Vanilla Bean Scones.  I didn't cut them into wedges, but instead cut them with a star-shaped cookie cutter!  For the Vanilla Bean Scones, I added a Vanilla Bean Glaze on top.  It turned out just like the Starbucks Petite Vanilla Scones!  Gotta try them again with other mixins...:)

I guess I forgot to review this recipe but this was a very good recipe. Perfect breakfast for a brisk fall morning with a cup of coffee. When I did make this, I sprinkled some cane sugar before and after baking.

Really pretty good.  I made 2 circles w/six slices each instead of the twelve.  I don't know if that's why it took a little longer to cook.  They were quite moist, though.  Used 1 tsp almond extract and dried cherries...Delicious!

This is my default scone recipe, though I always mix up the flavor! I have done lemon-blueberry and raspberry. With raspberries, they get a little wet, so I kneaded it in extra flour, keeping it moist on the inside and drier on the outside. Would also be good plain.

Delicious!  I didn't have any sour cream so I substituted yogurt, and the scones turned out great.  They are a little sweeter than typical scones, I'm not sure if it's due to the yogurt or not, but either way this recipe is a keeper.  My dough was a little too soft/sticky to roll-out and cut into triangles so I just dropped scoops of dough on to the baking sheet and made round scones.  Also I used about 1 cup of raisins and 1 cup dried cranberries...Yum!

This is the first time I have made scones and I am in love with this recipe! I tried this recipe because of all the positive commements and I'm thrilled with how the scones turned out.  I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup (1 cup seemed too sweet) and I have made cranberry orange (I added juice of 1/2 an orange and 2 tsp. vanilla to the sour cream, and zest of one orange and 1 cup craisins to the dry ingredients) and cinnamon pecan (I added 3 tsp. vanilla to the sour cream, and 3 tsp. cinnamon and 1 cup pecans to the dry ingredients).  I'm not sure what happend with the bakers who said these were dry.  I found them to be perfect.  Thank you to whomever shared this recipe:o)

I love this recipe! I was short 1/4 cup butter, so I substituted it with shortening. I also used light sour cream and added semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. I brushed the top with eggwash and sprinkled raw sugar on top. These scones are the best!

I like plain scones, but these taste like sugar cookies when they are plain.  If you make them plain, reduce the sugar.

I made a orange-cranberry version and it was AMAZING!  Added orange zest, dried cranberry, and vanilla.  I was a little worried when everyone said not to overwork the dough so I panicked a bit when it turned out really dry and crumbly so I added a little OJ into it (about 1/4 cup) and it MADE these scones pop! Also, My dad is diabetic so I made them sugar free (with diabeti sweet)and everyone who had them couldn't even tell!  Going to try savory next time . . . can't wait!

I made a slew of these for my daughter's Kappa Epsilon faculty tea at Duquesne University.  I froze them after they were cut and she baked them a week later for the occasion!  She said they disappeared and she got rave reviews from both faculty and friends.  This recipe is truly a keeper and one that our family will continue to enjoy year after year.

These are good.  I had never eaten a scone before I made these.  I made them with the Devonshire Cream on this site.  I was thrilled by how well they turned out.  A simple basic recipe that is easy to alter according to what you want for the day, like fruit or chips. I was pleasantly surprised that they were chewy rather than hard.

These were really delicious! My kids ate them all up quickly. I did leave out the raisins since my kids don't like them instead I used apples and added cinnamon. I did mess it up a bit but it was my fault since I added the apples I think I should have adjusted the wet ingredients or added more flour because I could not form it into wedges so I just dropped them on a cookie sheet. Thanks for the recipe.

I made blueberry scones and they were wonderful!  They were a little doughy just out of the oven, but the next day they were perfect.   The only difficulty I had was the dough sticking to my countertop when I cut it into wedges.  Next time I'll have to flour it more.

I loved this recipe! It was the first time I attempted scones and they turned out great!   I added a vanilla glaze to them (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Vanilla-Glaze/Detail.aspx?prop31=1).

oh my gosh so GOOD!! best scones i have ever made. i cut the recipe in half and used the other half of the egg for a very light egg was which i stuck slivered almonds to my cranberry orange scones! but i spent a while cutting the butter into the flour but it makes all the difference and i used room temperature butter.

Amazing everytime.  I usually use chocolate chips and then I make the Devonshire Cream recipe from this site to go with it.  I am always getting requests for these!

yummy yummy!  I halved this recipe (yes, I just kind of split the 1 egg in half...) and put chocolate chips and vanilla in it.  Super easy and tasty!

I made cherry scones for a ladies tea, everyone said they were the best!  I didn't have enough time to ice them, but I think that would have made them even better.  I want to tweak the recipe some to see if I can make them savory :)

These were a hit! I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla and split the dough in two to make two circles. After slicing I sprinkled with some cinnamon sugar and baked. The whole family, from the three year old and up, really enjoyed them. Thanks for the recipe.

We just made and devoured these warm scones while enjoying a snow day off school.  They are fabulous. My 16 year old decided to sub cranberries for the raisins and we also added the lemon zest.
Made a glaze of icing sugar and the juice of the same lemon and brushed it on as soon as they came out of the oven.
Other than that followed recipe exactly and baked on parchment lined cookie sheet. Next time would roll out two rounds instead of one and cut into wedges, as the scones were HUGE.  Look forward to trying more flavors.  Try this recipe-you won't be sorry

Excellent - I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup and added a tspn vanilla.  I made 12 round scones instead of the pie shape.  It was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh YES!  These are very delicious indeed.  My first time making scones and after reading dozens of reviews, I found them to be quite easy to make.  I didn't used any kind of electric mixer, and i used two knifes to cut in butter (I don't have a pastry blender) but they rose great.  I made them a little large though, I would shrink the wedges down just a little.  I kept the recipe the same and added 1 Tsp Vanilla.  Yummers!

I have made these scones many times.  My husband absolutely loves them.  I have used fresh blueberries, craisins, chocolate chips and raisins.  All varieties have turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very yummy!! My first time making scones (for a tea party) and they were a hit! I added cranberries and sprinkled raw sugar on top before baking. I would say that the sugar is a must!! Gives it that extra something. Can't wait to make more!

This was my first time making scones. I did half with chocolate chips and half with orange extract & dried cranberry's.
I think I used too much flour while trying to kneed it but they tasted & looked great. My family loved them.

Made a batch up for a brunch & everyone loved them!  It was the first time making scones & this recipe makes 12 HUGE scones....next time I'll probabley make smaller ones.  I can see where you could easily add dried cherries, choco chips, etc....to change up the flavor.

I made these for an office brunch and got rave reviews; one batch following the recipe and using dried mixed berries and one batch substituting orange yogurt and using cranberries. The sour cream based recipe had a little denser crumb, while the yogurt based recipe was sweeter and more cookie-like. Both were delicious. I patted the dough into two half-inch thick circles and got twenty four nicely-sized scones for the brunch. I can't wait to experiment with different ingredients!

Nothing special, but 1 c of sour cream is the only special ingredient required.

Yum! These are a hit with the family. My extremely picky 7 year old loves them. I can't wait to try variations. I am going to try to make them a little healthier with wheat flour and maybe some oats... but of course will have to still put in the chocolate chips!

very good. I made them with raisins, and did a drizzle of glaze on top. I used low fat sour cream, because that's what I had, but they turned out great.

If you are looking for a light and flaky scone recipe, this is not for you.  However, if you want a heavy, thick, doughy scone, this is definitely the one for you.  In my opinion, these are not the best.  They taste like cookies more than scones.

I think I did something wrong because the dough was a little wet, so they didn't come out pretty. I substitued fresh blueberries instead of the raisins. They tasted out of this world, so I will make these again!

These are the best and easiest scones to make!! They come together perfectly and you can cut them out in any shape you like. I did not change anything about the recipe, sometimes I add raisins, sometimes chocolate chips and I drizzle it with either jam or a powdered sugar icing. Yum!

Wonderful recipe. I made mine in the food processor so I don't overmix or overwarm them with my hands. DH said they were perfect, I thought they were a little too sweet for scones. I used some as a replacement for shortcakes in my mixed berry shortcake and it was delicious. The rest we just ate as is.

Terrific!  I never made scones but last year my husband and I went to the canadian rockies after a strenous hike to an operating tea house we had scones and tea. We did this hike on July 4th 2007 so I wanted to start a tradition scones on the 4th of July I will be using this recipe.  I did add dried cranberries and orange zest and they were perfect.

I have been making these for years, decreasing the sugar to 2/3 cup and using half whole wheat flour. Tonight, I mixed up all of the dry ingredients, had the sour cream and baking soda blended ... and realized I only had about 1/3 cup butter left! I contemplated bagging up the dry ingredients until I could get to the store next, but decided to try using oil for the remaining butter. And they still baked up beautifully; the taste is still as awesome. As if it hasn't been said enough, these scones are TRULY versatile. Always delicious.

Let me start by saying these taste awesome however i must have done something wrong. My scones were REALLY soft and spread A LOT. I guess I'm just used to drier, crunchier scones. I'll be making these again because the KIDS love them. They're easy to grab and go.

I'm embarrased to say I forgot to add the egg, but they still came out great. I added about a cup of blueberries instead of the raisins and I sprinkled the top with cinnamon and sugar. This recipe made 12 very large scones. Next time I will cut into 16 smaller wedges. I think this recipe would also be great for making strawberry shortcakes.

Excellent! Not dry at all! Followed reviewers suggestions to add vanilla, cut the sugar and roll into balls in hands to reduce handling. Awesome with raspberries and very good with blueberries.  Yummy, yummy and kid friendly too.

Seriously, such a good recipe.  I follow it exactly (except I add an egg wash) and have now made this recipe 4 times.  I have added dried cherries and cranberries and they have always come out perfect.  Highly recommended!

Delicious!  I didn't have raisins so I used currants plumped in a bit of brandy.  I also brushed the tops with cream and sprinkled them with a little granulated sugar.  I've always used a different scone recipe that is less sweet and a bit more dense.  This is a sweeter, lighter scone that I'm sure I'll make often.

These are fairly average scones - possibly go for a buttermilk recipe if you're after a light & fluffy scone.

Yummy! Great with tea or coffee - or just by themselves!
 I used half white whole wheat flour, and half all purpose. Also decreased butter by a couple of tablespoons.
 Instead of raisins, I used dried cranberries (orange flavored) and a little orange zest. This is a great base recipe and there are so many possible variations!

I'm not rating this recipe as it came out and I want to leave the avarage, because I did not have Cream of Tartar, and had to use the lemon thing from the common subtitutions section- It came out awful, I just want to warn others not to do what I did!

Oh these scones are soooo good. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars was because I substituted 1/2 cup of whole milk plain yogurt and 1/2 cup sour cream for sour cream. I only cook with spelt flour and it came out great. Those who have wheat allergies can do the same by using 1 1/4 c spelt for 1 cup flour (5 cups for this recipe). Way to go Grandma Johnson!

This recipe is amazing, and I will definitely make it again. The dough seemed very dry, so I added a tablespoon more of sour cream before kneading. Since I then added fresh blueberries, I probably could have avoided the extra sour cream; the batter was almost too moist after the blueberries were added. The scones are very large, so I'll be cutting them in half next time.

I will give a "5" on taste, but prep work was a bit tough, especially if you are not used to making scones.  I also found my scones needed to bake at 25 minutes (with a normal oven).  At 15 minutes I had raw dough.  The scones were very large even cut into 12 wedges.  Could easily be cut into additional wedges.  However all of that being said these scones are the real thing if you like scones.  Perfect just like the bakeries make.  YUM.  Had to freeze them so I wouldn't eat them all.

Very tasty, but I found the dough to be dry and hard to handle.  I would have to try the recipe again.  I added lemon zest and dried cranberries, and they turned out very delicious, with some added moisture to keep it together.  I will try this recipe again.  The outcome ended up being great.

I think I live a sheltered life.  I had never heard of a scone nor had I tasted one.  I made them for a high tea party at work and EVERYONE raved at how wonderful the scones were!  BRAVO!!  We are having another tea party soon and it was requested that I make the scones again!  I followed the recipe step by step...wouldn't change anything...they were delicious!

Absolutely amazing.  I did as others suggested and added some extra sugar and then some cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract.  It makes them perfect to have by themselves for breakfast--quick, easy, and delicious to grab out of a bag.  I put them in a ziploc bag and they managed to last 2 weeks on my counter--I cook only for myself, otherwise they'd have been gone.

Wow!!! So easy, and so good. I added chopped dried cherries. When the scones came out of the oven, I poured a thin powdered sugar and water icing over them. They are better then the ones from the local bakery. I can't wait to try other variations.

Really good! The first time I made them they came out awful. I used room temp butter I think that's why. The second time I used Cold butter and they came out great. It was my first time making scones. I thought they were very dry, and theese were very moist. I made 2 different kinds blueberries, and choc. chip. They were great. I was going to make a glaze but they were fine with out it.

Pretty good. Not AMAZING, although I think that had to do with me. I had a messy sticky dough and I was stressed out that I was over working it. Some of the other reviewrs said to add more sugar- DO NOT. I did one and a quarter cup sugar and it was really sweet. Tasty, but too sweet for a scone if you ask me. And I used quarter teasp lemon juice instead of cream of tarter.  Once the dough was workable I rolled it out into a quarter inch sheet, cut it into rectangles, put a couple fresh rasberries inside and folded it over (potsticker style) and pinched the edges closed. Its really tasty that way. Finished scone was tender even if I did work the dough to death.

I followed the recipe exactly and left out the raisins. The scones were delicious! This is by far the best scone recipe I've tried. Tastes great by itself and paired with a bit of tasty cream! Even my picky husband loves them and that's saying a lot!

These were great!  I split the dough into three parts and put mini chocolate chips in one, vanilla and cinnamon in another and dried cranberries/golden raisins in another.  As one reviewer recommended, I mixed the egg in with the sour cream.  I may try using yogurt instead of sour cream and see how that turns out.

I followed the recipe except added craisins and walnuts instead of white raisins.  I am going to amend my first review and up it to 5 stars, because they tasted so much better the next day. Don't omit the cream of tarter, that makes your finished product less dense.  I also make a butter cream frosting and put it in a small ziplock bag, cut a corner off and piped on the scones.   (pronunciation of scone rhymes with gone)

Great recipe!  I added a dried cranberry/blueberry/raisin mix and 1/4 tsp of almond extract.  Remember these are not cookies, they don't need anymore sugar.  If you absolutely must have them sweet, brush the tops with milk and sprinkle with sugar.

mmmmmm...these smell sooooo good in the oven. I was only making them for my mom so I scaled down the recipe a bit. I didn't want to break an egg to just use a tiny bit so I used margarine instead of butter. For the raisins, I soaked them in boiling water for a bit to plump them up. I couldn't find cream of tartar so I didn't use any. For a glaze, I mixed some sour cream with powdered sugar and drizzled on top. These were great! Thanks!

I made half the recipe blueberry and lemon.  The other half was dried cranberry and slivered almonds.  The were good but I felt they were alittle too fluffy/cakelike.  Good recipe but there are better ones.

Nice taste, the texture is more biscuit like. I believe I could have achieved the same result with bisquick or pioneer baking mix. I’ve had a hard time finding a really good scone recipe so rather than risk another flop, I decided to cut the recipe in half so that I didn’t end up with a wastebasket full of scones. I then divided this mixture and  made 3 varieties. I made 4 scones with blueberries, 2 scones with cinnamon chips and 2 scones with cherry flavored dried cranberries and white choc. chips. I glazed the blueberry and the cinnamon chip scones with a simple glaze, flavored with vanilla. For the cranberry/white chocolate scones I made the orange glaze. The blueberry was by far the best.

This is the first scone recipe I ever tried - 5 years ago for a Christmas tea... It is awesome and absolutely the yummiest, tenderest scones come out of the oven.  I have made it with several variations, but the one my son lives best is blusberry.

YEAH, these were very, very good. I made some with cheddar and apples (very good but don't store long) and some with cranberries and orange zest. Sweet, moist, light. Everyone expects them to be dry and crusty then they want the recipe. I make 16-24 b/c they are very large if you just make 12. But then I eat them two at a time :)

These took a bit of work to make! I didn't realize how large of a bowl was needed for 4 cups of flour and all the other ingredients. It was my first time making scones so the vastness of the ingredients and dough took a little getting used to, but they turned out yummy! Even though I realized after popping them into the oven I completely forgot to add any of the eggs! I made some plain, with blueberries, with chocolate chips, and with white chocolate chips.

These were great! I loved that they were so simple and quick to make. I halved the recipe and then divided that into half and made half with orange extract and chocolate chips, the other half with cinnamon and sugar. I also increased the amount of sugar in the original recipe and added some vanilla, as suggested by other reviewers. Even my husband who isn't a scone kinda guy ate two!

I was not as impressed with this recipe as I thought I would be, judging by all the great ratings. They were slightly fluffy and cake-like rather than the dense scone texture. This might be due to the fact that I used light sour cream and light butter. I also kept the amount of raisins but added an extra 1/2 cup of dried cranberries which was nice. I would make them again and try using full-fat for the dairy products and see if they come out better.

I love the scones and so does my husband; I mostly followed the directions, however I did add 1 t. of vanilla, and I made mine with white chocolate chips and strawberry jelly.  The jelly makes the dough too sticky so I just kneaded flour back in until I got the correct consistency.  I sprinkled the top with white sugar, as others have suggested, prior to baking.

This was my first time making scones and this recipe was great. After adding the egg and the sour cream, my dough was a little too wet and sticky, so I had to add more flour in.

I added dried cranberries which I had soaked for about 10 minutes in warm water, and they tasted great.

This recipe's definitely a keeper!

I searched for this scone recipe to make a "Thank You" gift for a friend. I'd never found scones I was crazy about--until now! The first time I made them, I used cranberries instead of raisins, added white chocolate chips, brushed the tops with milk and sprinkled some "Sugar In the Raw" on the tops. Fantastic!!! Even my toddler (who can be a picky eater) was stealing them! I'll definitely be making these again!

WOW... here's another scone convert!  Other scones I have eaten tasted like a slightly sweeter version of a mediocre  biscuit.  Not these scones, these tasted like a cross between a biscuit and a sugar cookie.  My partner says he would have like them "thicker," but I figure that would take a bit more baking powder, I don't know what that would do to the taste though.  As for extra sugar, this recipe was the perfect sweetness, for me at least, but I did get a request by my Father-in-law to add coarse sugar to the tops before baking so I may try that and add raisins like he likes them.  However, these scones are yummy delicious eaten out of hand plain.  The first one I ate hot with butter, jam and whipped cream, but then the best was when I ate one cold the next day plain...MMMmmm

These were very moist and very easy to make. We made the dough and then cut it in half to make 2 separate batches with different ingredients.  The possibilities are endless.  They were very good the next morning as well.

I used cranberries & milk chocolate chips, and a pastry glaze from this site.  Had to do 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening and it turned out great, also I used light sour cream, still turned out great.  Highly recommended, company loved it.

excellent scones! been looking for a good recipe a LONG time and this one is finally it. only thing i did differently was made a half batch, and added chocolate chips. 
i'm going to see if i can make a healthier version today with whole wheat flour, oatmeal, dried cherries, and almonds....we'll see how it goes!

When I had my coffeehouse, I used to make these scones to sell to the public. Everytime I made them, I sold out immediately because they were so good. I would always put raisins in them and sometimes 1/4 c. of chopped nuts.

Fantastic scones!  Woke up this morning with a craving so while everyone was still in bed and ventured out seekng for scone recipe.  Easy to make, light & fluffy, superb flavour.  Took 30 minutes to measure, mix, roll out and bake the first batch.  Served with butter and homemade strawberry jam and it was like waking up at a country bed & breakfast.  In the future, I will experiment by adding lemon rind and cranberries or sugar & cinnamon.  Perhaps chocolate chip for the children.

it was a hit! i added  frozen blueberry's  and sugar/cinnamon sprinkle as "Julia" suggested. and as " LADYJAYPEE" said i had to add extra minutes to the baking time. i am a sconce fan but my husband isn't so after reading the good reviews i tried this to show him how good sconce is. and that was a success he loved them! all tho he tries to call them flat muffins instead of scones, he sais they are to good to be scones! ;)

These are awesome! I made them for a family breakfast and multiple people actually said "These are the best scones I've ever had".  I made them with chocolate chips and will be trying them using many different variations.

Absolutely deee-licious!!  These scones did not have that baking soda/powder after taste like I've encountered in other recipes. (I did add 1/2 cup more sugar like suggested by others.)

Added vanilla to this, and subbed the raisins with blueberries in half the recipe.  A little flatter than I expected, but very nice flavor.  Thanks for the recipe, Rob!

Simply delicious, I can't get enough. They were the perfect consistency and not too dry with just the right amount of sweet. I used dried cranberries in place of the raisins. Absolutely delicious. 
The other reviewer was right, they are very large which is great because you can maximize one batch. My boyfriend took them to his station and all the officers devoured them. The sergeant said that I always have to make them.

These were wonderful!  I added cinnamon chips and a little bit of cinnimon to the batter, brushed the tops with a little bit of milk and sprinkled them with sugar.  I'm looking forward to making them again with different flavors.

I didn't think these were fantastic. The dough was very dry ,too crumbly. If I make again I will add 1/4 cup milk. We also found they were very sweet so will probably cut the sugar by 1/4 - 1/2 cup.

It is easy to make and tastes great. To reduce calories, I used fat free sour cream and margarine instead of butter. It's still moist and soft. Perfect for Sunday breakfast.

I was so pleased with how these came out!  I made little tiny scones by cutting each scone into thirds, so I came out with 36 scones to the batch.  I added lemon rind and currants and topped them with a lemon glaze and they were a huge hit!  Can't wait to try some other combinations!

Very easy and quick!  I made these for an office breakfast and I had so many people  coming up to me saying how great they were.  I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1 tsp. of vanilla. I also used an egg wash to allow the tops to brown nicely.  I highly recommend using a pastry cutter to cut in the butter.  Also, divide the dough into thirds and make 3 circles to cut into triangles.  If not the scones are way too big! In order to make sure that they were nice and fresh that morning I made up the dough the night before and cut  into triangles and placed on the greased cookie sheet and placed the whole thing in the freezer.  In the morning all I had to do was cut on the oven and take the pan out of the freezer to bake.  It did take a bit longer to cook, but they were still warm when they were served (and I got to sleep in a little later!) 
  I divided the recipe into thirds and tried 4 flavors in two batches: Plain, Raisin (topped with cinnamon sugar), white chocolate cranberry, and chocolate chip (used  60% cocoa chips). The favorites were the raisin and chocolate chip. Everyone one of the scones were eaten and my husband was so disappointed that there were no leftovers that I have to make another batch just for him!

This was my first try at scones and they turned out excellent! When I made them though, I didn't have time to actually shape them properly. But I put them in a 9x13 pan and baked them that way. I also added fresh strawberries and white chocolate chips. Yummy! I think I'll continue to experiment with the stuff I put in them.

If anyone hasnt tried these, they are missing out! These were the best scones I have ever eaten. To think I used to spend 2.00 for one is mind boggling. They were so easy to make and way better than bakery scones!

Made them w/ whole wheat flour and pure cane sugar, no raisins.  They were great.  Really good w/ a clam chowder type soup, more like biscuits than scones though.

This was my first time ever making scones, and also my first time eating them! They were easy to make, and tasted very good. I didn't find them to be too sweet at all. I made a lemon glaze and poured it on half of them when they were finished. Soo good! :]

Absolutely fantastic. I was really looking for a recipe to replicate the ones she used to make with whipped cream, but these were just as great! I can't wait to try other variations. We made half w/ raisins (fantastic) and the other half with lemon and poppyseed (needs some work). THANKS!

What a tasty scone.  I made them plain and they were great.  The dough was a touch on the dry side as I was mixing in the sour cream, so I added about a 1/4 cup of milk.  They turned out light and fluffy.

These are not something I would make/eat everyday as they are wayyyyy too fattening....but as an occasional treat, they are fantastic!!

Wow! So good. At first I thought I messed up (and I did), but this recipe is very forgiving.  The scones would be awesome just plain.  I did half the dough in chocolate chip and the other with fresh peach.  Yum.

I divided the dough into thirds and made cinnamon chip scones, on which I used an egg wash and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar before baking.  I also made mini chocolate chip scones and dried blueberry and toasted pecan scones.  All were very good!

Followed the directions, but added blueberries.  I usually don't like scones b/c they are so dry.  These were moist.  Everyone *loved* them.  I served some of them with lemon curd from this site. Yummmmm......

This recipe was delicious!  I LOVE scones and usually treat myself to one with a cup of tea after the kids have gone to bed. 

This recipe is excellent.  It produces moist and tender scones with such little effort!  I used chocolate chunks in the recipe instead of raisins and substituted light sour cream for the regular and it didn't change the texture at all.  

A very good base recipe that you can dress-up to your liking!  Next time I'm going to try craisins and cinnamon chips.

Don't generally like scones, but after my sis-in-law made these I HAD to make them for myself.  I substituted the raisins for cherry flavored Craisins and mini chocolate chips.  They were GREAT!  Brough them to work and they were gone in minutes.

I made these scones with whole wheat flour, lite cream cheese instead of all the butter, and used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  They turned out really good! I froze some on cookie sheets for a later date.  Will make again!

Yummy!  I'm not much of a baker.  In fact, I had to ask someone in the supermarket where to find Cream of Tartar (it's with the spices, although I suspect most people know this).  But, these scones were easy to make.  Mine were kind of dry, but that's the consistancy of scones so I think that's right.  Only change I made was to substitute mini chocolate chips for raisins since I'm not a raisin fan.  Very delicious with a cup of tea.  Thanks!

i was too lazy to shape it the way it was supposed to be, also, the batter seemed  little too wet. i guess i could have put it in the refridgerator for a bit to hardenl. but, anyhow, i shaped it like a super fat cookie and it came out really good, though it wasn't scone-like. but ohmygod, the flavour was soooo yuuummmm. my sisters loved it. and they aren't sweet eaters!!=)

I made this recipe because I wanted something fresh and fast and irresistible to my soon-to-be 3 year old son.  Well it turned out pretty good, but I think it needs to be cooked longer than suggested.

My family loves these scones!  I found it when I was trying to copy a local bakery's scone recipe.  So, I add cinammon to my dough, maybe 1/2 tsp.  Then sprinkle the top with a little cinnamon and raw sugar.  They are fantastic and my husband requests them for breakfast all the time!

My first experience making scones.  Easier than I expected and delicious right out of the oven.  I made half with cinnamon/raisins and half with dried cranberries.  Only 4 stars because they dried out a lot overnight... almost too dry to eat.  Next time I'll just have to make sure we eat them all the day I make them :)

I have to agree with all of the rave reviews.  My family went nuts over these.  I followed the suggestions and divided the dough into two rounds and cut into 8 pieces each, but I think next time I will divide into thirds.  I altered the recipe and used freshly ground soft wheat and sucanat with honey instead of the white sugar.  I also sprinkled the scones with cinnamon sugar before baking.  These will become my standard scone recipe from now on.  My son is already begging for more!

We forgot the cream of tartar.  Not sure how this changed the recipe, but while they were quite crumbly the taste was excellent.  The proportions are quite big for young kids.  Next time we'll cut into 24 wedges.

This was my first attempt at making scones, and these turned out yummy.  They were fast and easy to make. The only thing I changed was adding about a teaspoon of vanilla, and I made powdered sugar glaze to put on top. My family ate them up.

This came out good, but I think mine were a little to thick. So next time I'll make them smaller by making 3/4" like the recipe said instead of 1" rounds then cut into wedges.  I also like the taste of butterscotch chips in it but next time I might try fresh blueberries.

I made these for a church get-together and many told me that they were the best scones ever.
I used craisins (dried cranberries) instead of raisins.  They were wonderful.

This recipe is fantastic.  My grandma's recipe called for unpasturized sour cream which I couldn't find.  Without it they tasted like rocks even though I tried buttermilk.  So I needed a new recipe.  This one is alomst the same...just a little better.  I used currents.  Now the weird part.  We put peanut butter on them instead of jam.  Try it...it's sooo good!

I thought that I had rated this before but I could not find it.  I have been making these and selling them to the local coffee shop.  They have asked me what I put in them (drugs) cause they can not keep them long!!  They have people mad at them if they run out!
I LOVE THESE SCONES and they are the easiest things to make.

Oh, I love this easy recipe. I even messed up and didn't cut the butter in with the flour. I had to soften it in the micro and just mix it in. It still turned out perfect! I added Craisins and sprinkled the tops with cinnamon sugar. I shaped two rounds and cut each into 8 pieces. Just the right size. They didn't last long at our house! Next time-Craisins and orange zest with citrus glaze!

Good scone.  This is sweet, almost like a sugar cookie.  I added the zest of an orange, white chocolate and craisins and it was a big hit at a brunch.

This was my first attempt at scones. It is everything I expected! I did underbake them a bit even though I went the full 15 minutes but I can adjust that next time. I divided dough into two bowls so I could try different flavors. It was easy and I will definitely use this recipe again.

excellent, excellent, excellent...what more can I say.  Extremely easy and simply melt in your mouth.  I had never made scones before and now I will be making them VERY often.  Variety of ways to make these are simply limitless.  My DH was soooo happy I discovered this recipe, as he loves scones and thinks they have an excellent "texture" and flavor.  I did replace 1/2 of the sugar with a vanilla sugar and cinnamon that I keep mixed up for various recipes and OMG were they ever delish!!  Thank you for sharing!

Quite good.  These make big crumbly, chewy scones.  The dough is a bit tough to work with but that's how short doughs are...the directions make huge scones, I will make more, smaller scones next time.  That should also help them bake through better; some of mine were still moist in the middle.  Followed recipe to the letter, with raisins, but I bet dried cranberries or cinnamon sugar (as suggested) would be great additions.

These were so good!  Used these at a baby shower/tea and everyone loved them!
I omitted raisins and  added choc. chips to half the batter and those were gone first!  I did not knead or roll out the dough but just 'dropped' them by Tbsp's onto the cookie sheet.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great "modern" scone recipe.  It is too sweet and too cake-like to really be considered a scone.

There's a reason this recipe has 5 stars!  They are awesome!  This was my first try at making scones and they turned out better than I ever imagined.  Very easy and a great basic recipe for experimenting with different ingredients and flavors.  I omitted the raisins and added orange extract and dried orange peel.  I would love these with cranberries,too, but was out.  Next time, I will try blueberries.  Also, I sprinkled sugar on top before baking.  Perfect! Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper.

Outstanding American-style scone recipe!  The texture both before and after baking was perfect, and the dough easy to shape.  I opted for plain this time (substituting washed raw sugar for the white sugar specified -- a swap which lent a lovely honey-like hue to the finished product, as well as a more delicately nuanced sweetness), but can easily see how these would lend themselves well to all manner of experimentation.  I'll definitely be making these often!

This is the BEST scone recipe I have ever tried. I added a hint of lemon, substituted blueberries for the raisins, and added cinnamon/sugar topping before baking, and then a lemon/powdered sugar glaze after baking....   Thanks, Grandma Johnson, and Rob, for sharing!!

perfect! turned out just right the first time ... i found that melting the butter instead of cutting it in made the dough easier to work with. a lovely addition to afternoon tea!

These were pretty good - and easy to follow instructions.  As others mentioned, I cooked them a few extra minutes and made two rounds that I cut into 8 pieces each.  
I added mini chololate chips and heath bar bits to satisfy my sweet tooth!

I made a huge double batch for friends at the lake over Memorial Day and they were fantastic.  I had 12 kids who had never tasted a scone fighting over the last crumbs.

This recipe is great!  My family and friends just love it.  Easy to prepare, too!
I replaced the sour cream with 1 cup Nestle cream mixed with 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice. 
For variey, I added coarsely chopped walnuts or chocolate chips or just baked them plain. They all turned out great!

Awesome.  I tried the variation with cinnamon chips and sprinkled cinnamon/sugar mix on top and everyone loved them.  I also made the plain to go with my homegrown strawberries and they are great too.

A terrific scone recipe!  Not dry and crumbly, but the perfect blend of ingredients.  I increased the sugar by 1/4 cup, and found this recipe is perfect when topped with whipped cream and homemade strawberry rhubarb jam.  It's now a family favourite.

Wonderful recipe.  I made four times the quantity for an English Afternoon Tea that I hosted (for 40+ people).  I baked them the day before and then heated them up in the oven before serving.  I received so many compliments for the scones.

These turned out very tasty, but I don't know if I made them right.  It seemed like there was too much flour, I think next time I'll try three cups instead of four.  There didn't seem like there was enough moisture to wet all the dough and I had alot of loose flour and dough falling all over the place.  I added 2tsp cinnamon, 1/2 cup walnuts and 2 T. extra sugar to the dough to make cinnamon scones, and then topped them with a white glaze (3/4cup powdered sugar and 5 tsp. milk) They are really good, especially with a cup of tea!! Like I said, I don't know if I made them exactly right.  I've only made scones once or twice in my life SEVERAL years ago, so I'm sure I need to work on technique and stuff.

Very good.  I dumped everything into my food processor to blend.  Instead of raisins, added white chocolate chips & dried cranberries.  Baked beautifully on ungreased baking stone.

These were so delicious and perfect.  I left out the rainsins and instead added craisins and orange zest.  And they were so easy, too.  I love this recipe and I plan to use it often.

These are very yummy.  A little bit bland but that's ok as I like to taste the preserves without being overpowered by the taste of the scone.

GREAT RECIPE!!!  My husband loved them and so does everyone at work.  I changed a few things...  I substituted 1 cup of the flour for whole wheat flour.  I left out the raisins but when they were just out of the oven I sliced them and added butter and strawberry jam.  They were great!
