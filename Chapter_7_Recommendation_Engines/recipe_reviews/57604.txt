This was wonderful!  Note that it took about 30 minutes to prepare.  I added 2 large peeled and sliced russet potatoes.  I used 1/2 of a large onion, cut in 'rings,' instead of chopping the onions, and a smaller cut of meat; I cut the cayenne pepper down to 1/8 tsp. to make it less spicy.  I would recommend mixing the spices with the tomato mixture; otherwise, they 'bake' on the top, and don't get mixed in.  I added 1/2 tsp. salt before cooking, then another 1/2 tsp. after.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I came home expecting my house to smell wonderful with this combination of spices, but instead of a wonderful smell, I was greeted by this pungent stench.  

Even though the smell was unappetizing, I decided to taste it anyway hoping that it tasted better than it smelled (like corned beef and cabbage tastes better than it smells), but unfortuantely for me, it tasted exactly like it smelled.  I wasted money on this recipe because I had to throw it away since no one in my house would touch it.  It even took me three days to get rid of the smell from the house.

I am a lover of curry, but this recipe is definitely not for me.  It should not even get a 1 star, but that was as low as I could rate it.

I was surprised to find such mixed reviews on this recipe. I threw this surprisingly simple recipe together last Sunday and let it simmer all day - what a delicious treat in the evening! NO bitter aftertaste was present for us. I followed the recipe pretty closely, though I didn't layer quite as suggested, rather I stirred all spice ingredients into tomato paste mixture, then mixed it up with the beef & onion - I didn't have ground coriander...also as with almost everything we make, I squeazed lime juice over it before cooking, and added more/tweaked the spices as the day wore on. This was a very underrated dish in my opinion which yielded beautiful results for my family. Thanks ChezDeb! :)

This is a good recipe!  I did not have any tomato paste so I left that out and put 2 cans of whole tomatoes and it came out great.  At first I thought it was "too gingery" but the flavor really grew on me!  Leftovers the next day were even better!!  Will make again.  Thanks for sharing...

This did not turn out well for me. The meat did not have flavor and spices were very bitter.  Made it to the letter, will not try again.

i tried this recipe today and was hoping that it turn out well since it smelled okay. My friend and I took one bite out it and didn't like it.  It had a bitter after taste that I tried to drown out with strawberry daiquiri.  I don't recommend this recipe to anyone.

This recipe is simple to make and is fabulous.  The spices are a unique blend and it makes the whole house smell wonderful as it cooks the entire day.  I couldn't wait to try it.  Everyone in my family loved it.  I will definitely put this in my "make often" category.  Thanks for the recipe Chezdeb!

for some reason, this came out tasting very bitter. the beef got stuck to the sides of my slow cooker and, though the spices were very fragrant, it didn't have much of a taste.

We thought this was okay, but not great.  I suggest cutting back or eliminating the cinnamon and nutmeg.  Maybe add real mustard seeds and cumin seeds?

I have made this twice.  First time was bad with the onions so small.  Second time, cubed the onion.  It was a bit better, but still not good.  Meat had no taste at all.  The only saving this recipe was that I had a fatty piece of meat which made enough broth to pour over the meat and rice.

This was the most God awful recipe I've ever tried.  The amount of spices totally overpowers everything.  I'd try the basic recipe again, but I'd use 2 tbs. of premixed curry powder.

I thought it would be right up my DH's alley as he really likes curry and ginger.  It was very bitter when I tested it, so I added a little sugar which sweetened it a bit, but really didn't help.

my picky Jamaican curry loving husband requested this to be a regular!  I won't complain as this is so tasty and easy to make, and if it makes him happy, I'm happy!

These are really really good!  I love cooking in my slow cooker and this is one great recipe.  I didn't even have all the spices the first time and it was still really good - just don't forget the salt at the end!

I was really interested by all the ingredients, and the smell cooking during the day was fine, but the end result was bland and unappetizing. I would not recommend this to anyone.

Everyone in my picky house loved this recipe and asked if it could be added to our "regulars"!  I have to admit, I added several small quartered russet potatoes and baby carrots, and left out the cilantro as we're not fans.  Next time, I'll add a bit less of the heat producing spices to accommodate my tastes, though hubby and kids will be unhappy.  It smelled wonderful cooking all day!  Thanks for a delightful treat!

It was delicious and ridiculously easy.  I’m teaching my eleven year old granddaughter to cook and we had a blast.  We used basmati rice and there were no leftovers.

I read the other reviews before making this recipe, and noticed that many of the reviewers didn't like the spices. So, I substituted 1/3 cup curry powder and added a little salt. It turned out great!

Although I'm the chief cook and bottle washer in our home, I've never cooked "curry" until now.  This was delicious and my wife agrees.  I followed the recipe except that I mixed all the ingredients together in the slow cooker and cooked it just 7.5 hours.  I agree with those who mentioned a bitterness that they didn't like, but I found the bitterness to be a welcome part of the complexity of flavours.  The salt improves this a lot.  I will make it again soon.

I would not recommend this. I followed the recipe to a T. The food looked like muck and despite all the spices, it was surprisingly bland. I had added salt but would suggest adding some sugar as well. The coriander produced a very bitter taste (I would suggest diminishing the amount), also too much clove for our taste. I added sugar to my portion to try and save it, my husband fed his to the dog. I will not make this again.
