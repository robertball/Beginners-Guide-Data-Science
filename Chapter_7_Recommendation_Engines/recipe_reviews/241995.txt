This is very close to a recipe my mom made throughout my childhood.  The recipe might even match exactly.  If I come across my copy in the kitchen, I'll compare.

We made it exactly like the recipe except for using stick margarine rather than butter.

The cookies were made for a holiday cookie swap at work, so I didn't get to eat many, but I feel like my Mom's recipe kind of melted in the mouth a bit more.  Since the last  cookie I ate was a bit stale, it may have affected my perceptions and memories.

Even with a slight texture variance, even not getting to eat many, they were phenomenal.  Brought back so many memories.

I followed directions exactly and it came out very dry, tastes great but almost as dry as regular oatmeal.  When I checked online, it said if this happens it’s probably because I cooked it too long. I was careful to watch the heat & time.  Wish I knew a way to use it without throwing it out. My husband is eating it dry by the spoonful, but not quite what he was hoping for!  Glad it worked for many of you,  I think I will try a different recipe.

Delicious!  I added a half a cup more flour and 1 tablespoon more cocoa.  Tip: make sure you have everything measured and ready in advance so you get the timing right.

Same recipe I grew up with! Lost my recipe card, so am happy I found this exact one.  Only had extra crunchy peanut butter, but have used it before & it adds a great new texture.  However, I do a slow rolling boil for 2 minutes, then add the vanilla & peanut butter, stir until PB is melted. Then add the oats. So not sure what all the extra cooking/boiling does to the recipe.   If want them a little chewy, boil for 90 minutes & freeze.

Easy to make. You do need to boil it for 5 minutes and then after the addition of peanut butter boil another 2 minutes. Cookie turn out not gooey and easy to pick up off the wax paper as soon as they cool.

These are really good! Not sure if you are supposed to boil for 5 minutes or if it takes about 5 minutes to bring to a boil but I just guessed and they turned out. The flavor is great! Thank you for posting this recipe!

This recip only takes a matter of minutes to whip up and you most likely have all the ingredients on hand. I scaled the scale down to 10 cookies and it was a fun sweet treat for my family to enjoy after dinner. Overall taste and flavor is very similar to most no bake chocolate oat recipe although the addition of peanut butter gave this one a little boost in flavor.
