My husband had a burger like this while we were on vacation in DE and he loved it.  I gave 4 stars because I did not use all the ingredients listed. In place of the pickle, lettuce and tomato we had sauteed mushroom, onion and peppers. I also added some fried banana.  Left out the sugar and salt and pepper and substituted american for the cheddar cheese.  Actually, we all had a little different version, my daughter only had the bacon, cheese, and peanut butter. I opted to forego the bacon. Overall, everyone enjoyed these and in spite of the high calories, we will make again.

This was tasty.. I've had this in my recipe box a long time but never seemed to have all the ingredients at the same time. Only thing I can say is a teaspoon or PB isnt enough to really taste it. Go big or go home! :)
