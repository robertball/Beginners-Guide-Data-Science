Lovely winter food. I made it up into individual pies, using bacon and dried mushrooms (which I soaked in the wine/stock mix to soften before I cooked them). I also added fresh rosemary and thyme (because I had them). The mashed potato inside the pie is a winner - cuts the saltiness of the meat mix beautifully.

Like Kathy, I added rosemary and thyme to this dish, and I think it improved it. I also added a few cloves of garlic, crushed. The flavor was great and I enjoyed the mashed potatoes in the pie - however, I found that the bottom crust did not bake and came out gummy, even after baking the pie for a full 30 mins. Next time, I think I'll try partially blind-baking the bottom crust or upping the baking temp to 400.

it worked on a cold Christchurch NZ night with snow on the ground. I also added some lambs fry (sheeps liver). Perfect!

Delicious.  Also tried this as a shepherd's pie, browning without the pastry crust and milk as a gluten free recipe.  Yum.

great recipe, very tasty. Last time I made this, we were having some friends at home and to fancy it up a bit, I added some chunks of brie cheese in the cold meat mixture. yum!

It was a good pie because the man I made it for likes kidneys BUT that is the only reason I gave this 4 stars....This recipe taught me that I could live without eating them  LOL.

I liked this. Always been a fan of steak and kidney. And the potato top adds an extra dimension. Just linked it to a friend in Auckland,NZ.

This recipe differs from the traditional UK version as it is a cross between Shepherds  and Steak and Kidney Pies, as it puts pmashed potatoes on top of the meat filling and under the Puff Pastry. The result being soggy pastry. If it were not for this then it would have been given 5 stars. I also added a dash of Worcestershire sauce and Itaian Seasoning to add more flavor.

I've made this twice and it did not disappoint! Each time I baked the crust a little before adding the meat to prevent it getting soggy. The second time I didn't have any red wine and I soaked my kidney in milk overnight to reduce the bitter flavor.  My mom thought she didn't like steak and kidney pie before this.  I caught her getting a third helping out of the fridge at midnight!

Turned out great. I used a ready made 9" pie crust with a topper crust (mainly cause I didn't have the puff pastry on hand) and the finished product was perfect. I'm not s big kidney fan but my English wife had two portions so I'm thinking it's a hit. This dish will go into my rotation of meal plans. Thanks for sharing it with me.
