My family really likes edamame and corn.  This is a really good I summer dip.  I might add more jalape√±o pepper next time.  Plus I added a bit of garlic powder.  We really enjoyed it.  Served it with Tostitos scoops!

I wanted something lighter than typical Mexican corn, to go with grilled chicken and carne asada tacos. This was the perfect option. Some guests added it to their tacos like a relish. Easy to make and delicious.  (FYI: I omitted the onion for personal preference.)
