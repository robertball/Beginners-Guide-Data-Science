These are absolutely delicious!  However, a few adjustments need to made to the recipe to make it work.  You need to use half of the can of condensed milk with the caramels and the other half with the cake mix.  DON'T prepare the cake mix first, use the cake mix like flour for this recipe.  And the butter should be melted, not softened.  Also, baking it for 15 more minutes instead of 10 results in a more firm bar and not so gooey.

These are really yummy as-is. However, they are more like turtle brownies. To make them actually taste like german chocolate bars, substitute pecans for the walnuts and add 1 cup of coconut. One point of clarification is needed in the recipe... The cake mix is to be used as flour, not made as directed on the box.

These bars taste fab!! The cake mix batter is more like the consistency of brownies –I pressed ½ of the mixture in the pan then baked it for 8 minutes.  Instead of walnuts, I used pecans and I also added coconut which makes them stick together better. I crumbled the rest of the cake mixture on the top, and then used a piece of wax paper to spread it out a little bit.  I also refrigerated them overnight –and brought then to room-temp before serving.  Everyone loved them!!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I changed a few things though.  I didn't add walnuts and instead of using a 13x9 pan I used a 8 x 11.5 2 quart baking dish instead.  I also used a smaller bag of Werther's rather than the 14 ounces of caramels.  I used half of the sweetened condensed milk with the cake mix and half of the can with the caramels.  When the dessert comes out of the oven it will look like it isn't done.  Let it sit for about 2 hours and you're good to go!

I tried making this recipe by following the exact directions; something is missing. Do you make the cake mix as directed on the package first?  If so, you should add this to the recipe.  If not,  it doesn't bake correctly and is all crumbly .

I mAde These Bars for A friend for a VERY big Gathering...Everybody LOVED them. One person at the party kept telling me how great they were, And right away asked for the recipe. I did however change it just a little i added 1/2 a cup of cream and 1/2 cup of water to the cake mix along with the butter and condensed milk otherwise it would have Been really dry.The results were Great..Thanks for Sharing this wonderfull recipe. I am sure it will be used quite often.

According to my taste-testers (ie my housemates), they were delicious. When I made this, the consistancy of the cake mix was very crumbly and thick. However, I flattened 1/2 of the mix onto a baking pan, cooked as directed, added the carmel mix, sprinkled on chocolate chips, then flattened the remaining cake mix (pref with a rolling pin) and placed it on top (as if it were a sheet). This was sorta makeshift first attempt but it turned out pretty well and stayed together due to the chocolate and carmel.  Extremely sweet!

This was way too sweet for my liking.  I followed the recipe as written and was disappointed, it just seemed like something was missing...coconut, maybe?  I dunno.  The consistency of the bars was off to me, too--the sugar was very grainy/crystallized or something.  They would probably be better with homemade caramel, but not worth the effort to make again.  Looks like I'm outnumbered, which is a first for me on this site!

These were pretty good, but too labor intensive to get a higher review.  If you make them, toast the walnuts before baking.    Note: this is more like a brownie, so don't sweat that you're not adding eggs, etc.

I have a VERY similar recipe from family friends and although it's made with German chocolate cake mix as well, they are just considered brownies. These aren't really "German chocolate" outside the title. So yes, if you're looking for that flavor, add coconut. The family recipe we usually use calls for evaporated milk. It can be used in place of the sweetened condensed. I haven't tried it with sweetened condensed so I can't review the flavor (currently in the oven) but I am sure it's very, very similar and wonderful. We use pecans in ours, like others have suggested. The main suggestion I have is to let the first layer cool for a few minutes before adding your chips, caramel and nuts. In fact, I usually wait to melt my caramel until after I take the first layer of batter out of the oven. Oh, and don't over think the top layer of batter. Just put dollops of it all over the top and spread them out a little. It does not have to cover the top. It will spread while baking and you want some of the gooey goodness peaking through. These are such a delicious treat! Enjoy!

These were a fun idea for a friend who loves German Chocolate.   The cake layer on top and bottom was too hard, and I did add coconut to the caramel, or it wouldn't have been German Chocolate.  I think next time I will apply this general concept to a from-scratch brownie, because the downer in this recipe was the boxed cake mix.

This recipe has many mistakes!  Is it condensed milk or sweetened condensed? It says one thing in the list of ingredients and another in the mixing directions.  When you say "cover with caramel" you should specify how to do that!  I put it on top and the middle of the cake fell in. Should it say ""drizzle" perhaps?  Another baker said she pressed the lower cake layer down like a pie crust...is that what I should have done to stop the problem of the ruined cake?  The cake is in the oven now and I hope it at least tastes good.  Oh, also you show coconut in the picture...not in the list of ingredients.  Wow, I think I just wasted a lot of time on this recipe!

I was going to make this for a potluck the other night, but didn't have enough time to get the few ingredients I was missing.  When I got home I assessed what I did have and it somewhat resembled this recipe.  However, everyone loved what I made, so I felt compelled to add it.  Instead of a Cake mix, I used a Brownie mix.  I followed the directions on the box, using 2 eggs instead of one, for a more cake-like brownie.  I used about 3/4 can of the sweetened condensed milk and about 1/2 c of Peanut butter, heated on med in a saucepan.  In the baking dish I layered 1/2 the brownie mix, then the peanut butter mixture, some shredded coconut and pecans.  Then the remaining brownie mix.  After it came out of the oven I drizzeled the remaining condensed milk.  They were so good!  Everyone loved them!  I will still try out this recipe as written one day, it just sounds too good not to!

Really good treat! Read the review by NENG - hits the nail on the head.  Added coconut and pecans to the carmel layer to make it more "german chocolate".  If you are going to cut up and serve pieces, definitely bake longer on both steps, like 9 min and 17min - helps it hold together.

As recipe is written, there’s too much caramel so I’d cut back to 1/2 bag caramels and 1/2 the con milk.  What would German chocolate cake be w/o coconut? So I added 1/2 c shredded coconut after baking the first time but before adding caramel mixture.  You must let it cool completely or it’s runny.  Very good otherwise.

These are absolutely delicious. My son bought caramel sauce instead of caramels so it came out more like a lava cake than dessert bars. Loved it!

I used pecans. Also, I have not seen an 18. 25 oz cake mix in a long time. The major brands are smaller in volume.

Wonderful.  I used the entire base on the bottom and added coconut on top. Also, I substituted pecans for the walnuts

Very rich and tasty.  The directions were vague.  We melted the caramel in a microwave at 20-second intervals and then drizzled it on.  Like others, we added coconut and then decorated the top with additional caramel and coconut. For the second layer of the cake batter, we rolled it between two sheets of wax paper. We added about 10 more minutes to the total baking time.  Allow the cake to cool for several hours before cutting to allow it to set, otherwise its too gooey.

I followed the recipe and added coconut to make it more "German". They tasted great I baked them in a 9X9 pan and there still want not enough dough to go on top completely. I ended up with about 3/4 of the pan have the top and bottom presentation worthy. Other then that they were good, too much caramel for me though.

SO RICH & YUMMY!  Caramels were difficult to melt & stir. I added coconut...what's German Chocolate without it??? The cake batter was more like dough than batter and didn't really spread on top of mixture. But overall, worth the effort!

Amazing bars!  I almost might say a tad too much caramel, but that might just be me.  I also added about a cup of coconut to get German Chocolate taste, and they were divine!  My hubby devoured 3/4 o the pan by the time I got home from work the next day!

I made this for my kids to bring to school for ethnic day; their teacher said the kids wouldn't even try it, but she had two pieces and put the rest in the lunch room for the teachers and they were all gone by the end of the day.  I even had 3 requests for the recipe.

This was good.  I didn't understand the directions myself.  I didn't mix the cake first..I used the mix as a "flour" .  Hopefully that was right.

A few years ago I was trying to find something easy that my club in college could make for an upcoming organization fair in order to lure people to our table.  I entered "german" and this popped up.  Living in a dorm, I was looking for something easy to make and this was it!!
