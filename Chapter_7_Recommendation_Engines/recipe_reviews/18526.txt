This was a quick and easy recipie and had very good flavor, but I like my pies to be higher.  This one wasn't as eye appealing as I like.  I used another package of whipped topping on top of the pudding and that worked nicely.  I also used chocolate pudding instead of the vanilla and mini peanut butter cups that I cut into forths.  Very good recipie.

My family really enjoyed this pie.  I used Milky Way minis that I cut into quarters and it worked well.  It will be a definate keeper in our family.

Very good and easy. It went fast at a potluck. I used chocolate chips since that was what I had on hand. It would be good with a lot of different candies or even cookies. I also like that you can get lower fat versions of most of the ingredients if you want to reduce the calories some.
