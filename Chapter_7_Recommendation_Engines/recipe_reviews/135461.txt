I was new to crab legs, so a bit hessitant.  These were very easy and YUMMY!  I like the dip in just melted butter... melt in your mouth!  The only hard part is getting the crab leg out of the shell- but that happens anyway you cook them.  Be patient, have lots of napkins and enjoy :)

This was very yummy! Ive never made crab legs before and this was very easy to make very good. If the legs werent so expensive I would make this all the time! It was worth it.

These were not only the best crab legs I've ever made, but they were the best crab legs I've ever had anywhere!  My girlfriend agreed.  Absolutely amazing.  I made them with 7 clusters of snow crab legs, and about halfway through cooking I added about 1/4 cup of water to help them steam better.  Unbelievable flavor!

Our family has had a tradition of having crab for our New Years Eve dinner. I've been  looking for a proper recipe for o long time. I tried this one last year and this is the one that I will use from now on. Easy and very flavorful!

I didn't add any salt, and yet it was still a bit too salty.

The fish sauce was so overpowering, I couldn't taste the garlic, lemon grass or ginger.
