We just did not care for the basil and oregano.  I will try this again leaving those out and adding garlic powder.  I always drain fried foods on a cookie cooling rack with a paper towel underneath so the food stays crisp on all sides.

These were fantastic! Great texture and flavor, but we sure didn't consider them spicy at all. DH thought there was too much oregano, but I used mexican instead of italian so that may have been why. I only did two onions and there wasn't enough batter for all of it. So if you are doing 4 you should double the stuff. I used egg beaters in the carton for this. My DH had me do some shrimp in this too and said it was a winner. This is a definite keeper, thanks Luna.

I tried this because I had a craving for onion rings but didn't have any beer or soda water to make beer battered traditional style onion rings. Anyway, these are pretty good! Mind you I didn't follow this to a tee. I used cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs, and omitted the pepper flakes, oregano and basil. They turned out light and crispy, with a little zing from the cayenne. Thanks Luna.

The spices called for in this recipe are a bit odd for my palette; instead, I substituted the oregano and basil for paprika and garlic salt--these spices work really well with the cayenne and red pepper flakes.  Also--for an easier and quicker clean up, forget the separate bowls, and put the sliced onions in a gallon-size ziplock bag.  Add the flour mixture and shake to coat all onions.  Then, simply pour in the liquid mixture and shake again.  Finally, add in the bread crumb mixture and shake.  Make sure to separate the onions before you fry them.  This is much easier and clean up is a breeze!

I omitted oregano & basil, but added garlic powder.  I also saw a recommendation to drain onion rings on a cookie cooling rack with paper towels beneath.  Very helpful.  The onion rings turned out great.  Definitely a keeper.

Very good, the batter stuck very well to the onions.  Wasn't very spicy, we added some more cayenne pepper to "kick it up a notch.."

So good! We don't do fried food at home very often, and these were my first try at onion rings...but they turned out great! I never buy egg substitute, so I used 3 eggs with a splash of milk and a few shakes of tabasco instead (and left out the red pepper flakes). I only had 3 onions but there was lots of extra flour/egg/breading to do more. My husband suggested cuting the onions thiner, but I enjoyed them as is. I dried them on a wire cooling rack over a cookie sheet lined with paper towel as suggested, and it worked well - kept them crispy and was easy clean up.

Per other reviews suggestions I omitted the oregano and basil and added garlic and these onion rings were awesome! Now I just need to find a good recipe or a dip!

These were really good!  Such a nice change of flavor from the normal beer battered or plain breaded onion rings.  I  used one large onion to one egg.  Omitted the basil and oregano and didn't have any pepper flakes to use.  This was enough for the two of us.  Will keep the leftover coating for future batches!

this was the best onion ring recipe I have found...loved how the bread crumbs stuck to the egg mixture.  My family thoroughly enjoyed it...even the spices!  My husband said they didn't even taste like homemade!  This will definitely be a keeper!

Really easy recipe to start with. I modified mine by using an egg, milk and Louisiana hot sauce. I seasoned flour with garlic, pepper, salt and cayenne and followed recipe by dipping onion first then I to my egg mixture then back into flour- back to egg then into garlic & herb seasoned bread crumbs. They fried perfect and really quickly In fry daddy so donâ€™t walk far from fryer. I dried the cooked onion rings on a wire rack. Planning on dipping these into a seasoned horseradish sauce and serving with fried fish!

My husband made these for me.  He did a good job, but we had to cull the recipe for all the pepper seasonings.  My digestive system doesn't work with it, it causes me much pain.   We decided to    substitute garlic salt for all seasonings. They were very good and I ate them with "yum-yum sauce," also culled of most spices.

I did not care for this recipe. The bread crumbs was all wrong when it comes to onion rings.
