This aromatic rice is full of flavor with just the right amount of spices! I used Uncle Ben's Basmati rice so the cooking time was closer to 10 minutes.

Too much bouillon and liquid in my opinion. In the end I added water and turned it into a soup. Don't know if I will try to tweak this recipe or just look for a different one.

I liked it but made a few changes. It was certainly a great base! It is probably really good the way it was written too.

We served this rice with Spicy Potato Curry and Raita and it was very good. The raita really brings a fresh bright flavour to the dish.

It didn't blow me away like I expected. I've had and made curries that I liked better but it does taste good. I think it could be better though.

I LOVE this recipe!! Super super quick and easy. (And cheap once you buy all of the spices!) However I did use just one bouillon the second time around because it tasted a bit too salty for my liking. I heated up a couple of naans and it was very filling and delicious.

Very good as written however with added sea salt cilantro a few more cashews steamed crisp snow peas and somewhat less coconut milk it turned out GREAT!
