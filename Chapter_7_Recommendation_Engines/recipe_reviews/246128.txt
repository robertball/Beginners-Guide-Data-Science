5 stars for how fast it is to make, and 5 stars for the amazing taste! So delicious! No changes other than garnished with green onions.

It was edible, but ultimately bland.  It needs a lot of things to be correct.  Peppers, onions, less curry paste or something.  Just wasnâ€™t quite right.

Seriously super simple & savory. 
Added 1 sliced green bell pepper prior to the beef and turned out excellent. 
Went well w white rice. 
Will def make again!
