This has been our summer go-to salad for home, church potluck, family gatherings, out of town guests, etc.  We make it often and everyone loves it. It never fails to get rave reviews. I put the recipe on my phone do to the demand for the recipe.

I had sliced cucumbers and radishes, handful of cauliflower, and a broccoli carrot slaw on hand. Added some cilantro from my garden, and this awful "snack mix" with nuts and dried fruits sprinkled with turmeric. A little kale.. I can only handle a little at a time. I completely forgot to add garlic but it came out so good!!! The snack mix really brought it together. Any dried fruit and nuts will do! This is like the healthy version of fried rice, which I also make on occasion when I have too many random ingredients leftover. Easy to remember and flexible with ingredients. Skip the cheese on this one!

This is a salad which you can improvise with if you do not have all the ingredients on hand. I used cabbage in place of cauliflower and dried cranberries and pecans in place of raisins and pumpkin seeds.I brought it to the office buffet and there was nothing left. Quick, simple and delicious.

I really liked the tastes of this dish. It was a little vinegary for me so I added 3 TBS of sugar and that was just enough.  I also substituted chopped walnuts for pumpkin seeds and garlic flavored olive oil for olive oil.  "That's What's For Dinner Tonight"

I am not a vegetable fan but thought the combination of this with the herbs would be a hit with my family and my hunch was correct!! This was absolutely out of this world- I added two extra cloves of garlic because we are garlic nuts. The dressing was perfect and the vegetables soak up the flavor. Give this a try!!

This salad was bland for our taste so I added additional red wine vinegar and about 3 tablespoons of sugar. I know it wasn't as healthy with the sugar but we loved it. I'm sure I will make it again. Putting the vegetables through the food processor made for an interesting texture.

Really good, will definitely make it again.  I didn't add the raisins because I liked the flavor without them.  So delicious!

My family were not fans of this salad.  We all thought it was too dry (not enough dressing for the quantity of ingredients).  Additionally, the cilantro was a little overpowering and did not compliment the other ingredients.  I even used a little less (half cup instead of 2/3 cup) than called for.  We'll stick to our usual broccoli salad.

I used different veggies that I had in the fridge and just chopped it really small and it was awesome.  Family loved  it.  Will keep in my favorites. Thank you.

My whole family enjoys this healthy recipe! So easy to make and modify if needed:  If you don't have pumpkin seeds, use sunflower seeds or even sliced almonds.  Don't want the sugar? Omit the raisins.  Overall, it's a great recipe!

I was so excited about this salad, because it's all foods I love.  It was so disappointing.  Not very much flavor.  I won't make it again.

Lovely salad, easy to make.  I could taste the vinegar so will add less next time and more cilantro. Only 2 of us to eat it, still tasted good the next day!

This was a great recipe; however, I found it a messy job to make with all the pulsing and scraping into the bowl.  The only ingredient I had to substitute was I used cilantro in the tube as I did not have any fresh and I increased the garlic as we love garlic. Yes, I would make again and I would always make the day before company so that the mess is tidied away ahead of time.

Made it and loved it.  Added about 2 tsp of honey to the dressing - I may have gone too far with the vinegar - but it turned out great.  I can see using this for BBQ's or for the days when I want a lower calorie option.  
I could easily add cooked pasta for the teenager.

I thought this was a great salad, and would definitely make it again.  Great dish to bring to a barbeque, as it is different from the usual fare.
I cheated and used the riced cauliflower and riced broccoli from Trader Joe's, which cut down a lot on the prep work.
I also shredded my carrots, vs. chopping them.
Easy, fast, and yummy....oh, and good for you!

I give this recipe a solid "4",  probably on the basis of personal taste.  It is beautiful, and there is no dairy or mayonnaise!  I wanted a bit more punch, so I put in about 3/4 cup of raisins, and doubled the pumpkin seeds.  Tasty!  They must grow cauliflower big in Texas, and my smallish head yielded about 5 cups, so watch the proportions, when you make it.  The amount of dressing seemed just about right.  I did combine the garlic, herbs, salt and pepper with the oil and vinegar, just so I could be assured of a uniform mix.  Thanks for the idea!
