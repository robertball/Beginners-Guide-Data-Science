Absolutely delicious!  Left out the fennel seed (too much for my husband) and used one cup whole milk and one cup half-and-half.  Can't wait to make this with fresh tomatoes this summer.  Truly a masterpiece.  Thanks for such a fabulous flavor.

This is wonderful and easy to make.  I cut the salt in half and use 2Tlb dried basil instead of the fresh as it's hard to find good fresh basil here.  I also add about 1 pound raw shrimp and 1/2 pound scallops and one can of chopped clams for the last 5 or so minutes of cooking (the shrimp turn orange when done).  It's an amazing meal that always seems to evaporate before my eyes.  Thanks Kim.

This is a good "thick" soup. I did not have anise liqueur or half-n-half, so I used 1% milk. I think next time I might add a cup of V8 juice or vegetable broth to make it more soup-like not sauce like.

Yummy! Changed the recipe a bit. Caramelized the onions in the butter and deglazed the pan with dry sherry (no anise liqueur on hand). Added extra fennel and dried basil, decreased the salt to a single teaspoon of coarse sea salt, and added a bit of sugar to cut the acid of the tomatoes. Instead of half and half, used a block of lowfat cream cheese and a cup of skim milk, and then hit it with the immersion blender. Ate it with grilled cheese sandwiches. Husband was pleased! Will definitely make again.

This is delicious! I was given some home-grown tomatoes so blanched and peeled them. I didn't have fennel or anise, I bet those would have made it even better. I like garlic so I added some. I had three varieties of basil growing outside and used a little of each. I didn't have half and half so I used a can of evaporated milk.

This bisque is absolutely delicious!  I didn't have any anise liquor so used a little bit of 2% milk and it was still amazing.  Easy to make and wonderful!  I highly recommend this recipe!

Great soup.  I didn't have any anise flavored liqueur, but I guess I didn't miss it because it was delicious.  I can't wait to use this on pasta.

Delicious recipe.  Like others I used less salt (only 2tsp).  I didn't have anise liqueur, but I did have anise extract so I substituted with 2 tsp of extract.  I was concerned the anise and fennel would be overpowering given the strong aroma, but after cooking and letting the favors blend I was pleasantly surprised.  We loved it!

The  recipe was brilliantly simple. Except for the rediculously extravagant and unnecessary "Pernod" reference as a anise flavored liqueuer ingredient when much less expensive alternates would work more than adequately, this recipe is a winner! I added two cloves or minced garlic and a quarter cup of sundries tomato to give a bit more kick as well.

Followed recipe exactly and we loved it! We are big fans of  the licorice-y flavor of anise and Pernod ( I used Ricard).  It has just the right hint of licorice to make it delicious but not overwhelming.  But, if like some folks, you hate even the slightest hint of anise flavoring, this is probably not the recipe for you. This is a keeper for us!

Awesome!  Delicious just like the restaurants!  I used anise seeds, fenugreek seeds and dried basil.  Mix the spices right in with the onions and chopped red bell pepper!  Added a pinch of smoked chili pepper to the mix as well for a slight kick!

As written, this is not my favorite-- take away the anise and caramelize the onions first, and you have a winner! Use an immersion blender instead of a regular blender. No mess and much easier.

10 29 17 ...  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/213228/creamy-tomato-bisque/ ... I don't think it's just me, but I didn't read other reviewers stating that this isn't a soup.  It's more a good sauce for pasta.  It's good & it's easy; one of those simple-but-really-good recipes.  I had a half can crushed tomatoes to use up so made a fourth of the recipe:  1T un B, 1/4c onion, 14oz crushed toms, 1/2t anise extract for the pernod, 3/4t fennel, 1/2t salt, 1/16t pepper, 1/2c 1/2&1/2, 1/4c basil.  'Don't know that I'll make this again, but it is good & I'm glad I tried it.  :) UPDATE: I froze this to have with linguine & shrimp, but, after thawing, sauce had such a strong anise flavor I dumped it.

I really liked the flavor and texture, but I ended up adding twice the amount of half and half and some milk because otherwise it was too much like spaghetti sauce.

This was simple, easy, and delicious! We didn't have any anise liqueur so we left it out, but I thought the fennel was enough. Thanks!

It had nice flavours, but way too much salt. I had to dilute it afterward in order to eat it. Next time, I would half the salt.

Very, very tasty and a great consistency. I reduced the salt to 3 tsp and used one airplane bottle of Jagermeister I had lying around for the anise liqueur. Everyone loved it.

I made this yesterday while we watched football and it was delicious! I didn't have any fennel or anise liqueur, so I left those out but it was a great soup.  I sauteed my onions in the butter, along with some garlic, and then added it to my food processor to make it smooth.  The small market by our house didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried and it came out nicely.  I added a bit of sugar, also, as suggested by another reviewer.  
I'm not a pro at soups by any means so it was nice to try this and have it come out so well.  Paired it with the obligatory grilled cheese and hello dinner (and lunch leftovers!)  Very, very happy with this dish.

It's a nice flavor, but could have a thicker consistency. I think next time I'll use full cream instead of half and half. I found canned tomato with fennel, and that does give a nice roundness to the flavor. I substituted brandy for the anise, as I like the flavor profile that gives with the tomatoes.

One of my favorites, added a side of Grilled cheese sandwhich, was wonderful! I did not have fresh basil so I used two tablesppons of dried/crushed...still tasted good. I also used FRESH tomatoes instead of canned.

I was looking for a basic tomato basil bisque to go with grilled cheese, and this one was perfect!  I didn't have anise or fennel, so I made it without those and it was so yummy, so filling.  Like everyone else, I cut the salt in half.  Will try next time with greek yogurt instead of the half and half.(I removed the soup from the heat before adding the half and half, no problems with it curdling.)  I will be making this recipe a lot!!
