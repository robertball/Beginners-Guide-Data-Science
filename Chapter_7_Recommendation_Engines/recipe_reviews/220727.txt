Five stars from a non cheese lover. I am not vegan, just not a big fan of cheese-especially cheddar. I do not like cheese on my veggies and if I can find a way to keep cheese out of my recipes, I will. Having said that, this recipe is really good. I added a bit more lemon than written and and added more turmeric. This went nicely with some chips. I also used it on a sandwich with toasted bread,  which proved messy but good. It goes very nicely with pickles, capers and pickled jalapeños. I am betting that this will make a wonderful jalapeño popper. I will report back. Thank you for the recipe. It is wonderful!

I will make it again and use less water. The flavor is excellent but I wished I'd remember the cook's note about varying the amount of water before adding the water to the blender. Still, it's very good and I can imagine a 100 different ways to use this delicious dish!

So so, ok but not as good as the reviews indicated.  I can say it was edible. But I would not make it again.
