This was really easy to make! Tastes nice and refreshing on this hot day! I cooled it quicker by dumping into a pitcher and adding two sandwich sized baggies full of ice and stirring till the ice melted... YUM YUM YUM!!!!!!!

This was awesome!  We made the syrup and then our soda stream. We liked this as much if not more than buying root beer from the store. Loved that we could adjust the carbonation by making our own. We also used this for root beer floats. Yum!

This did not work out for us...The title is accurate, it IS quick and easy, but everyone that tried it thought it was WAAY too sweet and sugary!  The root beer flavor was lacking and left an off after taste.  The entire batch was poured down the drain, as no one could drink it.  Sorry, for the the poor rating, but I did follow the recipe.  Thanks for sharing, Carla B.!

Very easy.  Kids loved it.  We added a scoop of vanilla ice cream to make floats.  Thanks for sharing a very simple treat, Carla B.
