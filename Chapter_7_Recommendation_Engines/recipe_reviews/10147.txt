5 cups of sugar is way too much! I followed other people's instructions and only put 1 and 1/2 cups of sugar in and added a bit more lemon juice and it turned out perfectly. This is sooo good, and it goes great on the daffodil cake!

As written, only an average recipe. Too much playing around with measurements to get it to proper consistency to rate this any higher. I used only half the amount of lemon juice (and added some zest to replace lost lemon flavor) and it still was thinner than I would have liked. And, as others have remarked, it really is too sweet. By the time I manipulated the sugar and juice measurements and added lemon zest, I really wasn't making this recipe anymore. Since I was using this to pipe on cupcakes and needed a sturdier frosting, rather than add more confectioners sugar I added a couple teaspoons of meringue powder, which helped. If I was to make this in the future I would still use only 1 T. of lemon juice, and perhaps double the cream cheese.

I made this frosting yesterday, and used fresh lemon juice and no food coloring (you don't really need it, the color is nice without coloring). The flavor is great, except I think that it's much too sweet. If I make this again, I will use less sugar.

Lovely, luscious and perfectly lemony ambrosia. Applied this to the lemon drop cookie recipe on this website. The cookie was OK without the frosting, but was just devine with this frosting. It's nice and tangy with the fresh lemon. Much better than using lemon extract only. The cream cheese imparts a perfectly compatible tang. Could be used to dress up a plain vanilla cake or on an orange cake. Can be used as a glaze by thinning it out a bit with drops of milk. Versatile and delicious.

This icing is great! I used it for both lemon cupcakes and carrot muffins and it was the best part. Half of the recipe iced 12 cupcakes/muffins.

Family loved this recipe.  

I doubled the lemon juice and added about 2 teaspoons of lemon zest to the mix and then added enough extra powdered sugar to compensate for the extra juice.  It was super lemony.  

I iced a lemon wedding cake that is my wife's favorite (I'll post the recipe for the cake soon).

I'm not usually a lemon person but omg this frosting is amazing and addictive. I can't keep my fingers out of the bowl! I use freshly squeezed lemon juice for the best flavor.

Easy, quick and delicious recipe! I did as other reviewers and used less sugar, added lemon zest, and a bit more lemon juice than what the recipe called for. It turned out great!

Deliciously sweet!  I scaled the recipe down to 16 servings. Added 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon zest.  Only used 2 drops of yellow food coloring to give a better yellow color.  I used this recipe to fill and top the Lemon Gold Cake recipe.

EVERYBODY loved it!  I used this on a fresh blackberry cake and it was perfect.  I used about 3 c. sugar in all, and added about a tsp of lemon zest and a dash of vanilla extract.  It was easy, so creamy, and just the right amount for a 2 layer cake.  Definitely a keeper, and the flavor variations that are possible mean it will get used often.

This recipe was very, very good, but extremely sweet. I'm a huge icing fan, so sometimes I taste it after I've made it to see if it needs anything. And this was way too sweet to eat alone. I only put in 2 cups of sugar, and it was still unbelievably sweet. It was good on cupcakes however. It didn't spread that well either.

This frosting is a bit thin but that was fine for how I was using it.  I poured it on a whipping cream pound cake cooked in a bundt pan. I did not have lemon zest so I added 1/2 tsp lemon kool aide.  It added a nice zing for a lemon lover like me.

I absolutely love this frosting.  I used lemon zest instead of lemon juice because it gives a stronger flavor.  I used this to frost chocolate cupcakes and they were fantastic!  I will be making this again.

This is amazing frosting! Creamy and delicious! I ended up halving the recipe because I didn't have that much cream cheese or confectioner's sugar on hand. I decided to still put in 2tbs of lemon juice, which made it nice and tangy.

This is one of the best frosting icings I have ever made. My daughter wanted Lemon frosting for cupcakes she was taking to school. We made this recipe and frosted them. It was a very nice frosting to pipe with. We will use it again. We added 1 T. orange rind for color and flavor. It was fabulous.

I've got to agree with another reviewer on the lemon juice making this too runny. I also scaled the sugar amount to my preference.

I made some sugar cookies and then made this frosting to go with them. I put the frosting in a separate container (so it could be kept in the fridge) and took it all to work. They were so yummy, not one cookie came home with me,and all of the frosting was gone!!

I used this recipe for my husbands birthday cake- meyer lemon with white chocolate and raspberry filling. It tasted wonderful, but was a little too soft.

This seemed to have too much butter in it. It did not set up well and was running off the cupcakes. Maybe it is user error but I would use half as much butter next time.

Awesome and creamy. I also cut back the sugar as it would have been too sweet.  I also added a few drops of pure vanilla extract to enhance the flavor! Yummy!

very delicious!  I used this to frost cupcakes and only needed half the recipe, but i made the whole recipe anyway so I can freeze some for a later use.  The frosting is even better the next day after the flavors have had some time to blend.

This was an alright frosting, I found it to be a little too sweet though so I would reccomend using it on something like shortbread, rather than sweeter goods.

This recipe needs a little less lemon juice and more cream cheese but it is perfect other than those tweaks.... I also chilled for an hour before I used it to get it thicker.... (I would not use it on lemon cake or pink lemonade cake it is a lemon over-kill, unless you tweak the lemon) I will be making this again it was a hit with my husband... And my mom and sister would not stop eating the frosting! Thanks Amanda for sharing!
*** I had left over frosting so a couple days later I made another cake and used this frosting... I beat it for a minute on low... Than added about a teaspoon of milk to help the flavor... And it helped a ton!!!

Wonderful frosting!  I too used it on the Lemon Gold Cake and the family just loves it.  I think I may try it with orange juice and try making the Lemon Gold cake with orange zest, instead of lemon.  May be good made up with orange. Thanks for the recipe!

Good flavor, but difficult to work with. It literally slid off the cake and made the layers separate. The recipe is too thin and doesn't stick to the cake very well.

Frosting was too runny with the stated amounts. I had to add quite a bit more icing sugar, and consequently lemon extract. It was very smooth and the cream cheese gave it a pleasant tang. It does keep its shape even if it looks a bit runny. Not really a life-altering or amazing frosting. I probably won't make it again, but thanks! :)

Excellent.  I liked the sweetness of the frosting, it balanced the lemon cake I made quite nicely.  However, one batch was not quite enough to frost an entire double layer cake, so I made a second batch.  We had leftover frosting then, but that was okay.  I did not add any food coloring, it did not need it.

Good recipe.  I did not use all the additional sugar recommended, only about 1/4 c more, to taste.  I also beat it for a while, and my mixer had a higher setting for frosting, so after combining everything, I used that.  I made two batches, actually, for two dozen cupcakes, since we dyed some to do some detail frosting (baseballs!).  There was extra, but I don't have any complaints about the amount.  Didn't use lemon, used vanilla instead, and it was really good.

This was soooo yummy!! Defiantly a keeper. I only had one Tbsp of lemon juice so i used that plus a splash of lemonade. It was good this way so I am sure it will be better when I actually have the right amount of lemon juice. Thanks!!

Delicious!  Didn't use the food coloring.  Great, light flavor.  Tried to frost a white cake filled with lemon curd, but the frosting was too thin to stick to the sides even thought I added more powdered sugar, but it set nicely on the top and was perfect!

LOVE this frosting!!  I use it to ice the easy lemon cookies (also on this website).  Everyone I make the cookies for raves about them and wants the recipe.  Today I'm switching things up a bit and changing the lemon flavor to orange and icing chocolate orange cookies.  I think they will be great!!!

I had a boxed white cake and needed some frosting for it (I loathe store bought icing) and decided to try this.  It was really really delicious and the perfect amount of lemon taste.  Like other reviewers I didn't use the full amount of sugar.

I thought that this frosting was just delicious.  It went on perfectly, and had just a great tang to it.  I however, do like lemon flavor alot, so peopl who are not so hip on it, might want to cut back the lemon juice just a bit.

I didn't put all 2.25 cups of sugar in at the end, it still tastes great.  I did put more lemon juice in since I just pulled a bunch of fresh lemons off my tree..mmmmm!

Good, but really more like an icing than a frosting.

This recipe taste very good,  I made a few of the modifications suggested.  However this is more an icing so the picture and title listing as a frosting is deceiving.  Definitely an icing!

It's not fluffy enough to frost a cake. It looks absolutely nothing like the above picture. You can, however, pour it on your cake. It's delicious.

Right now I’m on 3*. I didn’t add as much sugar (probably used about 2 to 2 1/2 cups) after reading others comments, but it’s too runny for piping. It’s in the fridge so hopefully will stiffen up in an hour or so.

This was fantastic! I loved it so much. But it definitely didn't make 32 servings. I played around with the amount on sugar. It turned out beautifully. Thank you for this recipe! I will DEFINITELY make this again. :)

I don't like anything overly sweet so I also cut back the sugar and it was perfect . Big hit with the family.

There is an error on the sugar. It says 1 cup and 2-1/4 cups of confectioners sugar.  I doubled the cream cheese and butter and used 2-1/2 cups of sugar

I used 2-2 1/4 cups for 18 cupcakes and it was plenty enough. I omitted the food coloring and everyone enjoyed it.
