I was looking for a way to use up my ground beef. This recipe came up, no comments, no pictures. I figured I'd give it a try anyway. We really like it. The only thing I changed is I used rotini pasta instead of spaghetti to make it easier to scoop out of the dish. The egg and milk helped make the sauce creamier. Next time, the only thing I would change is I would mix in the ground beef with the pasta and sauce mix instead of putting it on top as it kinda stayed dry.

We enjoyed this and we'll make it again. I used 12 oz of spagetti, a cheesy rosa sauce, and spicy pork sausage in place of ground beef. I mixed the meat in with the noodles instead of layering it. Next time we'll add minced garlic, onions and black olives, and try a different kind of noodle.

I added mushrooms to it as well since we like them and it turned out great! Cooked them in with the hamburger meat once it was almost done.

I thought this was okay. I also got 8 servings, but 582 calories per serving is crazy high. I was able to bring it down to 415, but still not a lite dish obviously. I used all reduced fat dairy products, leaner beef, and turkey pepperoni. I also saut√©ed green pepper, onion, and mushrooms (per suggestion that additional pizza toppings can be added) before cooking the ground beef. The flavor was okay, but it was just a bit to salty to me. I don't know if it was the pepperoni, cheese, and other canned or jarred items in combination. Not something I would make again, but it was interesting to try a different baked spaghetti recipe. I might just not prefer spaghetti this way as I have always felt it made it a little on this dry side. This one had just enough sauce, but the top got rather dry in the oven. I will see if others like this combination.

This freezes great for later use.  I double the recipe and it makes three 8x8 pans.  I always make more spaghetti than the recipe calls for.   I use fresh garlic, onions, green pepper and cook with the hamburger.  I add the sauce to it after that with seasonings and simmer while I cook spaghetti.   Once layered, I add mushrooms, pepperoni and black olives.   I top with a little shredded parmesan,mozzarella cheese and additional pepperoni.    A great weeknight meal.

Very good. Made just a couple changes. Used Italian sausage instead of hamburger. Also used macaroni noodles based on other reviews. Lastly used half pizza sauce and half spaghetti sauce. I mixed everything together vs layering it. Turned out great

Let me try again. My Italian dad made something similar with leftovers and I do too. I always make too much pasta so the next night, I add a couple of beaten eggs to the leftover pasta. I throw it in a frypan and let it cook for a little bit. I add grated cheese (usually mozzarella) to the top while it is frying. Then I put the pan under the broiler until the cheese is melted and gets a little brown. I remove it from the oven and let it sit for a couple of minutes before serving.  We eat it with ketchup. I do this with almost any type of pasta fro the night before.

my husbands first comment was "This is a Keeper"...I'll be making this again! I did not add the canned tomatoes just due to personal preference but added more spaghetti sauce so it wouldn't be dry. I also added mushrooms to the top..so good...thanks for an easy, tasty recipe

I used a little less pasta (12oz) and added my favorite pizza toppings. IT WAS GREAT!

I took the advice of some of the other reviews and used half rigatoni and half ziti. I also used half pizza sauce with half spaghetti sauce. I added diced tomatoes w/ green chilies to the meat and mixed it all together before adding the cheese and pepperoni. It was amazing and lots of leftoversd for during the week.

It was great. I think it would have been better with Italian sausage or ground turkey/beef. I just done think the pepperoni tastes good in casseroles. It does make it kid friendly though.

I used pizza sauce, added my own toppings and even made  a small batch with the low carb soy noodles. OMG! Delish!
