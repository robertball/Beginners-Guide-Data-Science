Realizing that this would be too bland I made some modifications. I added chopped onion and green pepper to hamburger. Then along with tomato soup and sauce added garlic powder oregano Ital. seasoning tsp. of sugar salt and pepper. I only used 1/2 box of macaroni as it would have been way too dry. I did like the ease of this recipe.

My son gave this RAVE reviews!  Said it was the best dinner I'd ever made.  He cleaned his plate!  I loved it.  I followed some advice of other reviewers and added more sauce, but my husband actually said he would have liked it better with less.  Either way, it was a winner in household!

4 stars because it needs more of the soup and sauce so its not so dry. It was really good though but needed an extra can of tomato sauce and soup. Husband and I really loved it other than that. Going shopping tonight and going to get ingredients to make it again! Very easy and yummy! I did add a tiny bit of Tony's seasoning to the meat while I was browning it but thats all I did differently. Definitely recommend this! I ate leftovers of it even though it was dry. Normally I dont eat leftovers but it was just THAT good! lol

Turned out great! It was pretty easy to make. I actually didn't have tomato sauce so I just used two cans of tomato soup and it still was great.

Never had goulash before but for a super quick meal this was really good. I added a can of diced tomatoes but otherwise kept it the same. My kids thought is was some great invention because of the name.

It was okay but not enough flavor for us. I did use extra sauce like others suggested and I wish I had used extra meat and added more seasoning.

I give it 5 stars because it was super easy to make & my finicky eaters 3 4 & 6 all loved it. I added more cheese on top than the original recipe called for. I also added more tomato soup & tomato sauce as recommended by others. Will be heating up the leftovers for our next dinner & will definitely make this dish again soon.

Tasty simple recipe! My family compared it to cheeseburger macaroni as opposed to goulash. After reading the reviews I added some onion and spices (salt pepper and Italian seasoning) to the hamburger 1 1/2 times the amount of tomato sauce and extra cheese. When the goulash was done I realized there should have been more vegetables. So next time I ll probably add some zucchini too.

I liked how simple this recipe was but I had to add more salt pepper etc. because the flavour to me was not bold enough. But I loved how simple it was and other than that I have no complaints! I ate my whole plate! Well done! It would be a good idea to add your own flavour flare into this dish though. Or you can add those fancy special flavour tomato sauces to spice it up!

Made it Tex-Mex style with Campbell's Mexican style tomato soup & Herdez Yucatan blend corn & beans. Since others claimed of the dryness (& it did seem a little dry going into the oven) I added a little margarine. YUM! KIDS WERE SILENT WHILE CHOWING DOWN!

The proportions were very odd with this recipe. We ended up using a can of diced tomatoes instead of the canned soup (I don't like canned soup) and browning the ground beef with onion. But there were way too many noodles. Even using 13 oz of noodles to start instead of 16 (what the recipe asks for) we still tossed out almost half the noodles because there were just too many. Even with half the noodles (about 7 oz in other words) the mix never would've fit in the 1.5 quart casserole dish specified. It barely fit in a 2.5 quart casserole dish and needed a ton more cheese (at least a cup) to cover the top. And with all that it was still a very dull and under-seasoned dish. (It looks like a 13x9 pan in the picture by the way which is bigger still and would need even more cheese to cover the top.) The melted cheese tasted good but I can melt cheese on noodles without a recipe. I might be willing to make it again knowing now that it needs half the noodles more spice (maybe paprika but at least salt and pepper) and maybe a can of pasta sauce. It sure needs something! But I suppose that would be a whole different recipe.

This was super easy to make. It uses ingredients that most people have on hand all the time. My husband liked it a lot but said it needed more sauce. For me the sauce tasted a lot like the sauce in that well known children's canned spaghetti that has noodles shaped like O-s which was never a favorite for me. I'm going to make this again using only Italian seasoned tomato sauce and crushed tomatoes to see how that works. All in all my opinion is that this is a great time saving recipe that kids will love.

I needed a recipe that could be made quickly.  I used salt, pepper, and onion powder when cooking the ground beef.  I used a 8X13 baking dish which meant I hade to use a cup of cheese to cover.  I used a 28 oz. can of tomato sauce to keep it from being too dry.  Worked great!  Reminds me of school cafeteria goulash back in the 50â€™s.

Followed suggestions. 1/2 the macaroni, peppers, onions. I used my home made sauce no soup. No cheese. It was very very good and easy. Skipped the oven part too.

I recommend spices vegetables. And double the sauce and soup. Also use a larger pan for baking.
