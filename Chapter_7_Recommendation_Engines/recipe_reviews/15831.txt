my family LOVED this pie. I will make this pie everytime I want something that tastes like butterscotch!  You MUST BROWN THE SUGAR.  If you don't cook the sugar long enough it will not taste like butter scotch.  The sugar will look like a caramel brown when it is ready.

I think the other reviewers are not familiar with what a traditional butterscotch pie is.  This is it!  Great recipe.

This pie had absolutely no butterscotch flavor.  It was basically a custard pie, so if you like custard pie this is a good recipe.  However, if you're looking for butterscotch, look elsewhere.

I have been trying to make a butterscotch pie for my 96 year old father that tasted like the ones his mother made for him.  I finally found this one!  All the other recipes I tried were made with brown sugar and didn't have that true butterscotch flavor you get from caramelizing the sugar with the butter and cream.  It took about 15 minutes of stirring to get that nice brown color, but it was well worth the time.  The filling set up nicely overnight in the refrigerator and sliced into nice pieces.    My father and I both thank you for posting this great recipe.

I read the other review and was astonished. This was truly a butterscotch lover's pie. I'm not a baker so I had some difficulty "browning" the sugar. It was excellent. No need to worry about leftovers.

NO ONE LIKED THIS PIE. iT DIDN'T TASTE ANYTHING LIKE BUTTERSCOTCH. WAS FLAVORING SUPPOSED TO BE ADDED BECAUSE IT WAS NOT WRITTEN IN THE RECIPE.

Glenda,Thank you for this recipe! I have been looking for a butterscotch pie that was like my mom's, and as one of the other reviewers commented, you have to "caramelize" the WHITE sugar to get a real butterscotch taste. Thank you again!!! MRSN

Where is the brown sugar that gives butterscotch the butterscotch flavor.  Somebody forgot something.  This is not a butterscotch pie recipe.  It got one star because I had to give it something to get out.

This is the lowest stars, but if there was a zero, I'd put that. As well as the other persons, I did NOT taste any form of butterscotch whatsoever. And it was like custard pie and really runny. It was also really sugary.
