This is 100% the taco soup version that is correct to the original recipe from Texas. It has the perfect amount of spiciness combined with the coolness of the ranch dressing mix. This recipe is a staple in our household, and is one my family comes running for time and time again!

My family loved this!  I omitted the stewed tomatoes & green chilies, instead I just added the diced tomatoes with green chilies in them.  I also added a can of sliced olives.  Topped this with sour cream, cilantro,cheese, fritos and lime zest!!!

This was really good.  Served it with cornbread, sour cream, and shredded cheddar.  Next time I will just use diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  They were in huge chunks.

I made this as a last resort dinner and it was very good.  My picky husband loved it.  I added shredded colby and chopped onions on top and served with flour tortillas to dip.  Great meal, thanks!

YUM! I made this according to the recipe, except I seasoned my beef with lots of onion powder and I omitted the green chile peppers because I'm a wimp with spicy stuff. Plus, I figured the taco seasoning and green chile peppers with the diced tomatoes would give it a little kick, and it did. It tasted basically like chili as is. I would definitely add shredded cheddar, a dollop of sour cream and / or guacamole, and crumbled Fritos or tortilla chips to the top to make it recognizable as taco soup rather than chili. Between the cheese melted slightly from the hot soup and the cool sour cream....this was such a divine rainy weather food! It's very thick and hearty; add more water if you'd prefer it to be thinner or to make it last longer. I made it with 'Golden Sweet Cornbread' from this site and they pair beautifully. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is absolutely delicious and tastes like you spent a whole day making it.  I served it w/ Fritos on top.  Since I make this a lot, I modify what type of beans I put in... black beans, great northern beans, etc.  Of course, sour cream on top is divine!

The longer you cook this the better it tastes I think.  I used the fiesta ranch dip and the hot chili beans for a kick.  Still GREAT!!!

This was a very good recipe.  For more flavor, I added chopped onion while browning the meat.  It was too thick as a soup, so I added more water and adjusted the seasonings.   I didn't have chili beans so threw in a can of yellow hominy, and added chopped jalapeno and cilantro at the end.  My family loved it!

This really hit the spot.  I used a can of Rotel's lime juice and cilantro flavored tomatoes (bought at Food Lion)...and the Hunts fire roasted stewed tomatoes. It had a great flavor without being too spicy. YUM! 

I also added half a can of beef broth to make it more soupy. This recipe is a keeper!

This was the heartiest tasting simple soup I have ever made.  It has an all day prepared taste yet extremely easy to make.  I have done some variations and found that it makes a great hot dip too.  I substituted the both canned tomato ingredients for for 1 quart of whole canned tomato and added a small can of chillies to it..This made is very thick.. once slightly cooled I served it with baked white corn scoops.  It was a hit at the christmas party...

Very good flavor and I love the zip of the dressing. So good that my family has decided that this is better than our own standby chili! Fantastic!

This is my first time making taco soup. I like how this recipe is so quick, easy and delicious to make. The ingredients are simple and easy to get. I did omit the pinto beans and used black beans instead. Didn't have ranch dressing mix so i just added dry parsley and garlic powder. Also fried the beef with onion and garlic and added a bit of chili beans mix. Will make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I really loved this recipe and so did my family. I made a few changes though, instead of the chili beans I used pinto, and instead of canned corn I used thawed frzn. corn, I added about a 1 1/2 cups more water, and instead of ranch dressing mix I used a recipe for ranch dressing and just mixed the dry ingredients of that recipe, if anyone would like those ingredients here they are:   1 TB of salt  1 TB of sugar  1 TB of parsley flakes  about a 1/2 t. of garlic powder   about a TB of onion flakes   and about a 1/2 t. of onion powder

So easy and good! I had nearly a pound of leftover taco meat so I used that and skipped the first part of the recipe. A can of Rotel works great if you've got it. My recommendation is to use half a packet of the ranch mix and then add more to taste, it's pretty strong stuff. Half was perfect for us. I also added some broth because we wanted this more of a soup than a chili. I'll fix this many times, I'm sure!

great soup.  After frying the ground beef I put in crockpot for 3 hours.   It worked well to make it ahead and just reheat in crockpot.

Delicious and super easy!  After browning the meat, I made this in the slow cooker set to low and ate it about 8 hours later.  I prefer to make soups in the slow cooker to really enhance the flavors, not to mention that it adds to the ease of this recipe.  I used black beans instead of pinto beans.  I omitted the stewed tomatoes and added a little more than twice the amount of water called for as it seemed a little too thick (I just filled the chili bean can twice with water).  Came out perfect.  My husband normally puts hot sauce on everything, but didn't even bother with this.  It has quite a kick to it, but I think it was a good amount of spiciness.  If you aren't big on spicy foods, I would leave out the can of green chilies, but we loved it.  I topped it with shredded sharp cheddar and some crushed Cool Ranch Doritos and it was incredible.  Definitely will be making this one again - and soon! =]

This is good, and quick - we used bison, frozen corn, and diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  Sort of like a not-particularly-spicy chili.  We'll probably make it again, but next time I might try to make my own spice mixes to cut down on at least a little bit of the sodium.  Served it with cornbread.

Simple is right.  This took no time to make and was very easy.  The only change I made was ground turkey instead of beef.  Excellent on a cold busy night.  I ended up eating the leftovers with Frito's, cheese, sour cream and lettuce ala chili tacos from my girl scout days, wonderful!!!

I have been making taco soup for years and my family loves it!  It is perfect for cooler weather.  The only thing I do differently is I do not drain or rinse any of my beans or corn.  I add maybe a cup of water but if you like it more soupy then add more. Usually I add it to the cans to get the rest of the juices left behind.  We do not like it real spicy so I leave the green chilies out.  I have made it with red kidney beans and I like it but my family doesn't.  This is a good wholesome meal that gets better and better each day for leftovers.

Delicious!  I made a couple of minor changes based on personal preference. Two pounds of ground beef seemed like too much for a recipe that serves six, so I only used one pound of ground beef.  After I browned and drained it, I added it with all of the other ingredients to a crockpot.  I added a 2.25-oz. can of sliced black olives, drained.  I left out the water because I ran out of room in the crockpot, but it proved to be unnecessary, I assume because the crockpot held in all of the moisture.

I've made this recipe a few times and these are the changes I make and it tastes great. I season the ground beef while cooking it with some taco seasoning, salt, pepper and diced onion. I use a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes.  I also add a can of tomato sauce. I don't add the extra chilies.  The can of rotel tomatoes give it enough heat for us. I add water at the end and only enough to make the soup the consistancy I want it to be.  Toss all the ingredients in a crockpot and let it cook on low for about four hours.All the flavors had enough time to blend and complemented each other nicely.  I added a dollop of sour cream and a little bit of shredded cheese.  We froze the leftovers.

Just like the name implies it is simple! I didn't have chili or pinto beans so I used ranch style beans.
Thanks!

I enjoyed this. I only used half a pack of taco seasoning and half a pack of ranch salad dressing mix and only diced tomatoes with jalapenos, no stewed tomoatoes. This was very good!

I like the simplicity of preparation, but felt it wasn't made better with the addition of the Ranch dressing mix. I have other taco soup recipes that I like better.

We loved this!! Not only is it tasty, it's also super simple and it's done in no time!  :)  
I used 2 cans of Rotel instead of using the stewed tomatoes and the green chiles, and also added a small can of sliced black olives. I only used 1# of ground beef because I only had 1# thawed and also because I didn't think it needed more than that (and after eating it, I think 2# would have been way too much).
I topped mine with shredded sharp cheddar and sour cream, and served it with warm flour tortillas. I will definitely be making this again!  :)

EXCELLENT! I made this for the first time years and years ago...its wonderful...tastes like something you get at a restaurant only better lol. I made some changes due to what was in pantry, omitted green chillis, had no diced tomatoes so used half a large jar of our favorite salsa, and used black beans because i had no pinto beans...very forgiving recipe...yummy! My family loves this and we always garnish with sour cream and cheese and have with tortilla chips!

Only change I made was black instead of pinto beans.. just because it's what I had on hand.. I am not a fan of taco soup, but LOVED this! So chunky and loaded with flavor. We topped ours with a dollop of sour cream and some cheddar. Yummy!! Will be making this again.. and OFTEN!

YUM! This was so good!  I sauteed some onion and garlic before browning the ground beef.  I also used chicken broth instead of water and used 2 cans of rotel instead of the stewed tomatoes.  Will definitely be making this again!

OH my goodness this recipe is such a family favorite!! It couldn't be easier, considering the end result. My kids absolutely love it and always go back for seconds. Everyone who tries it always asks for the recipe.  We really like to serve it with fresh tortillas (if you can get them) and we roll them up and dip like a breadstick. My gluten free family members like to use fritos in leu of tortillas. Top with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of cheese for a very nice, comforting meal!

This was delicious! It was pretty spicy, so bear that in mind if you intend it for little ones. I wanted to avoid the MSG in ranch dressing mix, so I used a recipe from allrecipes.com, using just the herbs and adjusting it to serve 16, which equates to what the envelopes yield.

With the exception of the stewed tomatoes, I followed this recipe and was disappointed. I ended up doubling the amount of water and it still wasn't enough. It wasn't soupy at all. The next day, what was left of the water had been absorbed and it needed more water. The flavor was okay, but the consistancy was nothing like any taco soup I've ever tasted. IF I make it again, I will definitely add a LOT more water, and because of that, I will probably have to add more seasoning as well.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I used Ro-tel in place of the diced tomatoes w/ green chile peppers and used beef stock instead of water.  This gave the soup a spicy flavor that my husband likes. Great recipe for a no fuss soup.

I made this as written, except subbed beef broth for water.  It was very easy to make, but rather bland and way too salty.  I might make again, but with some adjustments to cut down on the packaged mixes to reduce some sodium.

As written, this recipe was bland in my opinion.  I used it as a base and added to it.  I only used pinto beans.  Not the chili beans.  I also did not use the ranch dressing mix.  I used a variety of seasonings, including salt, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, dried cilantro flakes, one chicken bouillon cube, fajita seasoning and taco seasoning, and hot sauce.  I also chopped some onion and sauteed it while the beef was draining.  Note, I also used frozen corn instead of canned.  I added everything together and used more water than the recipe called for, adjusting the seasoning so it wouldn't be bland (1.5 cups of water didn't make it look like a soup).  Overall, it was good and I would definitely make this again.  Next time I will probably use fresh cilantro and put it on top after I put the soup in the bowl.  I served the soup with cheese quesadillas on the side.  My husband really enjoyed this meal.

Delicious! I've even made this soup using Quorn instead of ground beef. Still just as good to me. This recipe is quite meaty. I prefer less meat, but my husband likes it this way, so I continue to please the meat eater.

This was a good starting point for the basic recipe, but I had to modify it to suit my tastes.  I substituted black beans for one of the cans of pinto beans, and I also added two more cups of water.  The main thing was that it was very bland with just one pack of taco seasoning.  I added a ton of chili powder and cumin for it to have any flavor. I will make this again, but I will definitely have to spice it up!

Very good! You can really modify this any way you want. The last time I  made this I used a can of black beans, chili beans, diced tomatoes with onion and a can of rotelle...then added whatever corn choices...white, yellow, or mexicorn...you decide! We don't really like the big stewed tomatoes so I never add those and I always slightly puree the rotelle and the diced tomatoes. This soup changes according to what's in the pantry! And it's always very good!!

I agree that this is more of a chili-like consistency, but it is so easy and tasty! I used the 2 pounds of beef and it seemed to be too much. I substituted creamed corn for the whole kernel corn and added diced tomatoes instead of stewed. I made corn bread muffins to go with this. We placed a muffin at the base of out bowls, poured the soup over it and topped it with shredded cheddar cheese. Delish!!!!

Too much meat.  It overwhelms the other ingredients and also makes it more like chili consistency than a soup.  My family liked it, so I will probably make it again cutting the meat down to about 1 1/4 lbs--and increasing the liquid a little--probably in the form of beef broth.

Loved this recipe!  So easy, quick and tasty.  I didn't change much, just used what I had in the cupboard that was "close" to the ingredients, for example I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so just used regular diced tomatoes, and only used one pound of ground beef, which was plenty.  Nothing too drastic.  Yummy!

VERY YUMMY!

This was great! We substituted shredded chicken for the ground beef and even my picky eaters loved it! Served it with homemade lime tortilla chips, and our company asked to take the leftovers home! Would recommend this to anyone with finicky children and great for entertaining.

I loved this soup! I substituted hominy for corn and put it in the slow cooker instead of simmering over the stove. Even better the next day. Thanks for a great recipe!

I fixed this for a Christmas Party and it was a huge success! My husband isn't a soup person or a chili person but he loved this. Great flavor, very easy to fix, and kept warm nicely in a crock pot. Definatley a keeper recipe.

This was really good, even with the substitutions we made. Me, feeling 2#s of hamburger to be too much, replaced 1# with a can of white hominy. We also skipped the sliced chiles choosing instead to purchase diced tomatoes with chiles in the can. We topped the soup off with a dollop of sour cream and a small side of warmed flour tortillas. Awesome!!!

I give this a 5 star for the pure ease and quickness of this dish.  It tasted great and was so simple to make.  I did add a little salt to mine, but that was just personal preference. I served it along with the mexican cornbread recipe from this site and it was a huge hit.  Everyone was taking home leftovers.

Off the hook! I used 1lb of elk meat with the ground beef. I also added an onion, 2 jalapinos before I add the canned ingredients. Fresh Hatch green chili instead of canned green chilies made a huge difference as well.  Cilantro was sprinkled on top.

Yum! I love that you can compromise if you don't have something on hand. Switch out the type of beans, add more beans in place of some ground beef, add more corn, etc. Great recipe!

This was super easy and super delicious! I took it to work today and there are no leftovers! I thought the ranch dressing mix sounded odd but it was perfect. Added a can of black beans cuz I like their texture, will definitely make this again, thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe, I never really add water however, I don't drain the cans and maybe just a bigger can of stewed or diced tomatoes or I add a cup or two of chunky salsa as well and don't use the green chiles since the salsa usually has that and onions in it.  I also add some worcestershire sauce and a little sugar.  I only have used one pound of ground beef and it still turns out good and chunky enough for us.  Our kids love it!

I make it using chicken instead of ground beef, otherwise exactly the same.  Simply boil chicken until tender, remove skin and bones (save broth for another recipe), then shred/or dice meat in with the other ingredients while you are mixing them together.  Heat well.  Top bowl with shredded cheese and serve with nacho ships.  My 85 year old father's favorite for years!  And yes, we are from Texas, too!

Very good recipe - so easy!  It seems more like a chili to me, but what do I know?  Made it for our Missions Conference dinner tonight at church.  I added a pkt of dry fajita seasoning mix as I like that smoky flavor, and the rest of a mostly empty jar of slasa I used making some Flautas.  I also made it in a crock pot (after browning the meat on the stovetop).

Recipe as is gets 4 stars.  Really really really easy and yummy.  Only 4 stars because it is really thick, almost too thick to be soup, feels more like chili.  Personally, to make it a 5 star in our home, we add a LOT more water.  Don't measure it, just until it is to the consistency that we like it (keeping in mind that we'll add fritos and cheese and sour cream on top).  Other than that, it is the best and easiest recipe to follow.  Every time I make it I get compliments and people ask for the recipe.

Very good.  This makes way more than 6 servings though!  I halved the recipe and got at least that many!  I didn't have green chiles so I left them out and I added yellow bell peppers.  This is definitely simple, tasty, and easy.  I used Seasoning for Tacos recipe to make the taco seasoning for the soup.  Thanks for the recipe!

this was awesome. I added a small onion, chopped and sauteed, also, I added a cup of tomato sauce and 1/2 cup more water. We like our taco soup alittle on the sweet side so I added some sugar. Delicious with sour cream, cheddar cheese and cornbread!

Yum!!! This is the exact recipe my mother in law uses and it is delicious. I use diced tomatoes instead of the stewed ones and I omit the chili beans and just use pinto beans or Ranch Style beans.

I've been eating this soup since I started dating my husband 7 years ago...  except we know it by Santa Fe Soup.  It's super easy and super delicious.  It usually gets made at least once a month in our house during the fall and winter months.

This was really good and so easy. I left out the chopped green chilies and chili beans because I didn't want it to be too spicy. I used a can of whole tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes. I added a small can of sliced black olives and served with shredded cheese and sour cream. My very picky six year old even ate it.

I have tried different versions of this soup and this one is my favorite. I was able to entertain and enjoy unexpected company while I put this together. Great meal to warm you up when it's cold outside and very good.

This is delicious soup, the toppings really set it apart from chili, as other reviewers have said. The only substitution I made was using a small can of chicken broth instead of the water. I also made this soup about six hours before serving so it could marinate a little. I think any tomato based dish always tastes better after a day or so.

Very good and super simple.  I cooked the ground beef and fresh garlic in a pan and then cooked it all in a crockpot for a couple of hours. I subbed hominy for corn.  It was delicious!

Very good. I modified this using ground turkey to minimize fat, but added about 1 tsp salt to compensate for the less flavorful meat. Also sauteed 1 yellow onion and added. I used two cans of kidney beans as the mild chili beans. Adde a few dashes of garlic powder and one-ish of cumin, also a couple drops of hot sauce. I suggest you keep the tomatoes with chiles. You can use regular stewed tomatoes and diced with the chiles or vice versa. Just cut up the stewed tomatoes if they are too big. It was a hit.

Really enjoyed the taco soup.  This was such an easy dish to make.  Great for a snowy day like today.  I garnished it with sour cream and cheese, as suggested, I also, added a few crushed tortilla chips.

Very good! I used about 3/4 packet of ranch the second time I made it, and it was still great. (trying to save on salt wherever I can!) Thanks for sharing! Oh yeah...I also didn't have corn the second time and substituted diced canned potatoes. Still great!

So simple to make, yet so tasty. Definitely a new favorite of mine. My husband and I have to be very careful with spicy foods so I only did 1 oz. of the taco seasoning (and used mild) and cut out the 4 oz. of green chiles. To make up for the lack of liquid we didn't get with the chiles, I added a little tomato juice. I also added a can of kidney beans and a can of black beans; added more flavor and made it more colorful which was actually really pretty. I served it with sour cream, shredded cheese, and Frito chips (or tortilla). Next time I'll cut up some fresh avocado as garnich. Definitely a must-have recipe for easy, quick, affordable recipes. Makes ton of leftovers that continue to get better (microwaved leftovers for 1 m 30 sec).

10/30/09 WOW.I had originally printed an began making taco soup III but was finding the need to sub. a ridiculous amount of ingredients. So I went searching to see if Maybe I created my own thing. This recipe though, is pretty close. I made my own ranch dressing mix, used some leftover spaghetti sauce w/ meatballs, and an extra can off sliced tomatoes [[whih I now already regret]]. I'll update later on the *hopeful* success!! UPDATE:: Alrighty, so it's been a few days since I made this so I just gotta remember..It went over well, 11 year old was able to eat it fine with sour cream; said it tasted like 'regular chili from a can'. Which with what I'm working with, is good enough. I didn't add a whole lotta water to it, just let it 'sweat' [[???]] it out into a more chili consistancy, waalla, it's now chili soup. I would def. make this again for how easy it was an try it as written, just to verify my rating. THANKS for the recipe =)

This was the easiest quickest way to get my kids to eat beans (husband, too). I didn't have regular corn, so I used cream corn, and it worked just fine. I also did not add the chilis this time since I didn't know how spicy it would be. It had enough taste, but was not very spicy at all. We did have cheddar cheese, sour cream, and little soup crackers for everyone to add, and they did.  Lastly, we used deer meat instead of beef...no need to drain the fat!  (This is my favorite deer recipe now).
Addendum: This time I used last night's leftover hamburger patties, broken up. I also used regular ranch dressing instead of the powder, about 2-3 tbsp. Couldn't tell the difference!
I love recipes that work with what I've got in the house!!

DON'T MISS THIS ONE, FRIENDS.
First time I tried this, twas a perfect 
fall Saturday.  All day rain and great
college football match-ups.  Sauteed
ground beef, threw it and the rest in a
slow cooker. The only thing better than
the aroma was the soup itself.  My wife,
who is NOT a Tex/Mex food fan, loved 
it.  Loved it so much she asked me to 
make a very large amount for the office
Christmas pot luck lunch. I did, and now
all her co-workers want the recipe.  
Moral of the story : Try it. Try it just
as written, and then make adjustments, if
you dare try improving perfection.  Goes
great w/nachos and/or cornbread.
Thank you, Chef Glenda.

This was a really good and easy to make soup. My daughter loved it and asked for seconds. We topped ours with shredded cheese, sour cream, and tortilla strips.

I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used diced instead and this recipe was so easy and so tasty.  I topped it with Fritos, sour cream and cheddar cheese. It became a family favorite instantly.

We make Taco soup at least once a month.  Instead of water I use a can of beef broth. I also add chopped carrots, onion, fresh peppers, celery and even sometimes some cabbage or zucchini to pump up the vegies.  Love this over some fritos in a deep bowl or fresh warm flour tortillas.

Our family enjoyed this very much! I had to search for this recipe having made it several months ago but neglecting to save it. I let it simmer for 1 hour to let the flavors meld. Due to the additional simmer time I added 2 cups of water to allow for evaporation. Definitely more of a chili vs soup. We garnish it with sour cream and Fritos brand corn chips. Very tasty.   Thanks Glenda!

Absolutely a hit with my family of 5! I did omit the stewed tomatoes simply because my husband doesn't eat tomatoes and the rotel seemed to be enough. But besides that we loved the recipe

I really like this. It's much better than chili. The only change I made was I used black beans instead of pinto beans

Great recipe! I usually substitute black beans for the pinto beans. It's just a personal preference. The spices are perfect! Sour cream and cheese are great on top. I always double this recipe. I freeze leftover 2 cup servings in quart bags. It's perfect for a nice hot lunch later!

Had to leave out the tomatoes became hubby doesn't like them. So this was thicker than it should have been.  The flavor was just okay.

Really, really good!  Used refriend beans (1 can regular, 1 can black bean).  No stewed tomatoes, but 2 cans of diced with green chilis.  Added onion and garlic.  Even I can't mess this one up!!!

Nothing extraordinary about this soup. It basically like chili with corn in it. Very filling and a crowd pleaser though.

This soup is so simple and yet so delicous!! The only thing I did different was add another 1/2 can of corn. With some tortillas on the side... cheese, sour cream or avocado on top (or all of the above) and it is perfect!! A HUGE hit in our house.

I was skeptical about this, but tonight being a "simple night" I tried it anyway. All I can say is wow!!! The Ranch really works with this recipe. I'm quite impressed and so were the rest of the family. Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

Really good my husband loved it which is always a plus. The only thing I changed was the beans and I used one can of black beans and one can of kidney beans. We ate from that three nights in a row.
It was great.

Great easy soup that the family LOVES.  This is the second time I made it.  ALSO the recipe is very forgiving... if you don't have one thing or you have a different kind of bean... no biggie, still awesome.

This was amazing...is definitely one of our all time favorites now .......to make it stretch since I have 2 teenage boys  I doubled everything except the meat and seasoning packets and served it over rice. I was hoping to have leftovers the next day but they cleaned the crockpot.

I used dried beans (black and black-eyed peas) which I soaked overnight, drained, and rinsed (takes the gas out of them...), frozen corn, and a 16oz container of fresh pico de gallo. I cut the meat to 1lb. The only canned goods I used was diced tomatoes (which are sadly high in BPA). It's basically a chili with corn,  which I was a LITTLE disappointed in, but it still turned out good. I served it will greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and I think some Tostitos would be really good, too. I'll make it again.

So easy and so tasty!  We like to add fresh onions and cook it in the crock pot.  I've made this recipe about five times now, and plan on many more to come.  You can add and subtract ingredients to your liking very easily.  It is a keeper.

excellent recipe.  Quick to make and was just the right amount of spice even though I was weary at first of using the whole can of chillies.  Will definately become a staple in my recipe box.

This was really a great "staple" recipe for making often this fall.  I used 2 cans of black beans, one can diced tomatoes and a smaller can of tomatoes and green chilies. I omitted the additional chilies. a dollop of sour cream mixed into a bowl of this with shredded cheddar and corn chips on the side is divine!  Thanks for the recipe.

Love it the original way and also I made it using Onion soup mix vs the ranch mix.  That is delicious too!

very similar to one of our favorite camping recipes - we add a chopped onion, ranch style beans, and one more can of tomatoes and we don't drain anything.  You can eat it w/in a hour but much better long-cooked in the crockpot.  Great w/sour cream, green onions, avocados, and grated cheddar.

Ridiculously quick & easy to prepare.  I had most ingredients in my pantry.  This is a very forgiving recipe.  I only had 1# ground beef and it still turned out hearty & satisfying.  The kids loved it (I left out the chilies).  A great tasty quick dinner.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was so easy!  I added Chicken Broth instead of water and a 7 oz can of diced green chilis. It was nice and spicy!  I did add a little shredded cheese and crushed corn chips to the final product.  I will definitely be making this again!

WE LOVED THIS! My husband ate this all weekend and was so devastated when it ran out. He asked me to make more!! We added some sharp cheddar sprinkle cheese, tortilla chips, and Louisiana hot sauce to our bowl. I added a little sour cream also (:

I liked this recipe as I have NEVER had taco soup before today.  I did adjust the amount of ground beef to only one pound, we are not big fans of it.  I also have 2 small children, ages 4 1/2 and 3, so I did not add the chopped green chilies.  I didn't want it to be really hot.  

I really liked the taste but my husband and children did not like it at all.  I might make it again but only for a church gathering or fall soup supper (where my family can have other options).

I used ground turkey, my own homemade taco seasoning, fresh cooked pinto beans, and organic canned ingredients where I could. I also used beef broth in place of the plain water for more flavor. I did not add ranch dressing mix as I wanted the taco seasoning to prevail in this recipe. I did add some fresh onion, garlic and organic peppers that I sauteed briefly before adding it to the crockpot. I appreciated the ease of this recipe as I had a really busy morning and sick family members. Recipes like this can always be adapted for the crockpot and can be bendable to what you have on hand and can be made healthier, if you so choose. It's also quite cost-effective. A cup of this with half a sandwich or a side salad will suit me well for lunches during the week. NOTE: If you can, rinse your canned vegetables to eliminate the "tinned" taste.

I could not tell you what this soup tasted like, because we had to drink a gallon of ice water and eat a couple of crackers with each bite, it is so spicy!  And we like spicy food.

This was good, but nothing special. I made it exactly as written and found it to be a little too spicy for my taste (I used mild rotel).  If I ever made it again (which I probably won't), I'd use black beans instead of the pinto beans and maybe kidney beans instead of the chili beans.  I don't have a clue why the ranch dressing mix was added.  I couldn't taste it at all.

I pulled this recipe up by using an ingredient search with random cans I had in my pantry that I wanted to use. We added some sour cream and frito's on top. My daughter's all loved it! Will definately make again. It's also so great that you can tweak and add so many different things into it.

This was so simple and yummy!  I left the pinto beans out because my husband and I are not fans of them.  I used extra lean ground beef as well.  Finally, I took some of the other suggestions and before serving, I added a dollup of sour cream, some shredded cheese, and crushed corn chips.  I will certainly keep this on my list of favorites!

This was very good and not very spicy so the kiddos could eat it.  I made some changes to use the ingredients I had on hand.  I used 2 cans original rotel, 2 cans corn, black beans and pinto beans with ground beef, taco seasoning and a ranch packet.  I browned the beef and threw everything in the crock pot.  Very simple and delicious.

I had this at a 'soup' dinner and they added small chunks of cheddar cheese to it right before they served it in a crock pot.. the gooey cheese really made it pop! Dice some avocados, cilantro, olives, shreded cheese, crumbled taco chips, green onions and sour cream for garnishes, add some corn bread and you have a great pot luck dish.

This is my husband's favorite soup.  I add onion powder (or saute an onion with the ground beef).  We top the soup with shredded cheese, crushed tortillas, and sour cream.  It always gets rave reviews.

This was pretty good, but a bit too spicy for my kiddos.

Very easy, and delicious! I tweaked a few things to suit our family's tastes. I browned the hamburger with chopped onion, and minced garlic. I also used black beans instead of pinto. And lastly, I used italian diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes. This was perfect for a winter night, especially when served with warm conrbread. You can't go wrong with this recipe!

I'm glad I found this recipe.  I usually add one can of chili beans (instead of chili + pinto).  I also fry up some corn torillas up and garnish the soup with the chips and sour cream.  The family loves it!

Very easy. I substituted the beans for black beans and kidney beans. I also added green onions on top. Very delicious and filling. Will use again. Perfect for a college student!

I'm from Texas and live in Fort Worth and we always make this! This is the first time I've added ranch dressing and I always always add chili powder. I sub kidney beans for the chili beans since I didn't have chili beans and I double the tomatoes. Always a winner!! Makes enough for like 6 people.

This is a great soup for a quick meal.  It tasted like a basic chili recipe.  I didn't have time to make a taco soup in the crock pot so this one came in handy for the time I was alloted to make lunch for my sister-in-law  and myself.  We love mexican and it hit the spot with a nice salad.  I used three cans of beans and one lb of ground turkey.  I think the Fiesta Ranch added some more zip.  Thanks for the quick recipe.

Very good.  So good my daughter is taking leftovers in her thermos today.  That doesn't happen often!  Modifications made were only that I used 1 lb ground turkey rather than 2 lb ground beef.  I did not add the can of green chilis.  I added 1 can of beans with jalapenos.  Thanks!

Just add a couple of more beans and you have a favorite weight watchers recipe.
