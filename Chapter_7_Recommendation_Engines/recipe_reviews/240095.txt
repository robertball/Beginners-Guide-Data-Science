This was by far the most simple and quick-to-make fondue I've had. The white wine adds a lot of accent to the dish and is a welcome addition. I did add some black pepper, cayenne, and salt to taste, but it was fantastic. Definitely my go-to recipe for how quick, easy and tasty it is

Excellent and easy!  I also put fresh crab in the fondue and serve with artisan bread.

This is very good and very easy. I made it right in my electric fondue pot. I did 1  cup cheddar, half cup Swiss cheese and half cup gruyere.

Clumpy and grainy. Taste was OK, texture was terrible, even after mixing the flour into the cheese before cooking and adding a little lemon juice.

My husband loved this, but too "swissy" for the rest of the family :)  I cooked the wine a bit longer to mellow out the flavor which worked well.

Really, really good. Much better than what you buy.
