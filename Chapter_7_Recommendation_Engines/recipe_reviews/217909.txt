This was wonderful!   I've made it a couple of times now.  We've used it for to top chips, put on grilled chicken and used it in halibut tacos.  I once made it with lemon juice because I didn't have enough lime and it turned out just as wonderful.  I also add cilantro.  I would make it a day ahead and let it sit in the fridge so all the flavors can meld together.  You should definitely try this!!  I had friends come over that immediately asked for the recipe.  Thanks!

Awesome! This is a great way to use rhubarb without a lot of sugar. The lime and the apples make this delicious. 
I didn't have green onions so I used red onion and chives. I added a little Kosher salt. 
I'm guessing that if you thaw frozen rhubarb there would be no need to blanch it. 
I ate it with chips, but you could do a lot with this.

I made this for my friends to go with grilled chicken and we all loved it! I would definately recommend this to someone who wants to use rhubarb in their cooking more!

This was very good.  My 3 yr old grandson loved it.  I didn't use limes, I used 4 Tablespoons of lime juice and instead of jalapeno's I used salsa peppers and I also added a half can of rinsed and drained black beans

My dear friend, Shawna, has a huge garden and gave me the most lovely rhubarb. It was so fresh and it's flavor quite strong so I used the 2 cups of rhubarb then doubled everything else. Took another's suggestion and added fresh strawberries too. Fabulous! The next night I added some avocado to make it more of a guacamole! Great!

This recipe was fantastic. I caught my 15 year old daughter "sampling" it from the fridge while I grilling the chicken to put it on. 

I stuck to the recipe except for one addition. I added a couple sprigs of chopped cilantro, and I think that added the perfect finishing touch. 

One mistake I made was in blanching the rhubarb too long. I lost more flavor than I intended. I also would add a second jalapeno next time. I added one per the recipe and couldn't get a lot from it... and that's something for me to say since I'm a wuss when things are too hot.

I really liked this recipe and basically ate it all myself, because nobody else at the picnic would eat it.  Oh well, more for me!

The salsa is delicious and interesting. I always was looking for the no dessert rhubarb recipes and that is. I used the salsa on potatoes, but we found it would be better with bread or tortilla chips. I didn`t have honey and used brown sugar instead that worked well. And I had big limes, so 1 lime was enough too. Thanks for a great rhubarb recipe.

Loved, loved, loved it.  SO great to be able to use rhubarb in something other than dessert.  We added strawberries and would cut a bit of the onions next time to suit our tastes, but all in all, we loved it!  It'll be something we bring to summer gatherings for sure.

Although I enjoyed this somewhat, I didn't enjoy it as much as other reviewers.  I will not be making again.

Oh my! We all loved this.
I was given some rhubarb from a friend's garden, but I didn't want to make anything with it that required lots of sugar. When I found this recipe I was curious, and had everything I needed to make it. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added a little cilantro, and since I had organic limes, I also added the lime zest, which I grated with my microplane. I topped tostadas with this salsa. It has such depths of flavors that it gave the tostadas a "restaurant quality" flavor. My husband is already asking for it again, and he isn't even a  fan of rhubarb.
I made this in the morning so it had plenty of time to chill, and for the flavors to mingle by the time dinner rolled around. Really looking forward to having this again.

Fantastic. My significant other made this for a jewellery party she was hosting and it received rave reviews. I am glad there was some leftover and was surprised I liked it as much as I did

I really enjoyed it, but it wasn't spicy enough for me. I will try again adding more jalapenos (unseeded with a little less lime juice). I gave some to my neighbor and she loved it, as is, and asked for the recipe.

I was skeptical because when I blanched the rhubarb it looked very unappealing but mixing it all together and it tasted amazing!

I  made this salsa  today,  I used a whole red pepper instead of a jalapeño  pepper as my  family doesn't  like them.  This is amazing.  I also used Palm Flower Honey that brought from Hawaii.   I hope my  family likelikes it as much as I do.

Loved it only thing I did different was I didn't blanch the rhubarb.  It gave it a little bit of a crunch.

I gave this 3 stars because while it's not an impressive dish, it is addictive. I can't explain it, it just is. I only tasted it with chips; I plan on making grilled chicken breasts and serving the salsa with them. Hopefully I will be able to up the stars then.
