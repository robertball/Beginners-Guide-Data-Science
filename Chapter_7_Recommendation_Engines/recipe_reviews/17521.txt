I live in Australia and have not always been able to purchase marshmallow fluff but now seems to be readily available. I also added grated orange rind for a bit more zing. Have noticed family is now eating a lot more fruit, which has to a good thing.

this was such an easy recipe for a last minute party buffet! My guests really liked it. I left out the confectioner's sugar like another reviewer and it was still sweet and great!

This fruit dip was a party favorite! My family and friends loved it! Very easy to make. But I only put a splash of orange juice concentrate, so the orange flavor didn't over power too much.

Liked very much at a party I went to. The orange juice gives it a slight tangy flavor. A little hard to mix all together, but overall it is my favorite fruit dip so far.
