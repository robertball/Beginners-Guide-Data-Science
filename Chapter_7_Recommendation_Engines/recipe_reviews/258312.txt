These were good, yet pretty mild in flavor. They were more "icy" than creamy in consistency, so I may add some cream for a portion of the almond milk next time.  I substituted agave syrup for the honey. Also, the mixture filled 8 of the popsicle molds I bought at Walmart, with a little left over.

If I were to add a little rum to this, would it work ( as liquor doesn't freeze very well) if so any suggestions on how much?

My 3 year old was very excited when I showed him this recipe and photo and told him I was making them for him!   AND he loves them.  They are really good and I can feel good about him having an "ice cream treat."
