WARNING - : an oven temperature of 250 degrees Fahrenheit will cook the meat rather than dry it. 150 to 160 degrees is the temperature usually used for dehydrating in an oven, which usually takes 4 to 8 hours.

This recipe was OK.  It tasted a little too much like the Worcestershire sauce for my liking.

Found this recipe to be a good start. I didn't have any hot sauce in the house so I used 1 tsp of white vinegar & 1 tsp cayenne pepper. As I tasted this, I decided it needed to be a little sweeter, so I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar. My daughters don't like spicy foods. It now has some sweet and and small hint of spice and my daughters love it. I believe this will now be my recipe for jerky. I may try another table spoon of teriyaki next time?

I didn't care for it.  Tasted too strongly of Worcestershire.  Which is a taste I actually like, but in this case it overwhelmed the venison.  I wouldn't make it again.  Too bad, too, because from a casual read it sounds like it would be really good.

Made this marinade and used a dehydrator to dry my jerky. Tasted so good I barely got any. Between family and co workers it was gone in under 24 hours. Really good recipe.
