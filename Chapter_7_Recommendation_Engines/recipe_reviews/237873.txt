There is something wrong with this recipe.  I did everything exactly the way it said to and by the 15 minute mark, my zucchini were a chared mess.  450 deg is WAY to hot.  I searched for other similar recipres and most call for 200 deg bake fir and hour and flipping after 30 minutes.

Followed directions to a tee...burnt mess. I thought the flavor was good but like the others will try a 200 degree oven, for one hour, flip after 30 minutes.  Also the photo looks like the chips were flash fried in a oil fryer.

First time I tried it, it was a burnt mess.  As I really wanted to like this recipe, I gave it a second attempt, this time cutting the zucchini thicker (maybe about an 1/8 of an inch).  Nope.  They weren't burnt (not all the way anyway) but some were a gooey vegetable with burnt parts.  Whatever picture is used in this recipe is NOT what you get.

After 20 minutes in the oven the chips were still mushy. The only crunchy chips were the black ones! 
Terrible recipe! Will not do again!

The temperature in this recipe is way too high and 30 minutes was not enough.

I followed this recipe as directed and it burnt 95% of my zucchini slices. This recipe wasted an entire zucchini. I am very disappointed. I will look again for a better recipe but DO NOT USE THIS ONE! I should have read the reviews.

This recipe is a disaster. I have never cooked anything from this site that wasted my food. It was burnt at 10 minutes. The cooking time is all wrong. Would not make again. Sorry
