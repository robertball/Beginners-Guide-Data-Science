I'm an Allstar and this was a brand sponsored recipe we could select to make.  I had no qualms about the ingredients used, but it lacked any flavor entirely. There also was no "wow" factor.

The pork itself is very tasty.  I browned it all, but did not toss it all in the dish at the end.  Happily, I think the slices may easily be re-purposed into sandwiches, with the addition of some barbecue sauce and/or other condiments.  Now to the problems with the combination.  Frozen baby corn is not part of the line-up at any of the grocers in town, so I had to use the canned product as well, which I often omit from Asian recipes.  Other than the visual aspect, it did not add to the overall flavor profile.  I used an orange bell pepper instead of red because that is what I had on hand.  I added about 1/2 cup of chicken stock to the vegetables, to keep the minced garlic from burning, and I wish I had added more, along with some additional seasoning.  But that's the problem.  Is this an Asian dish with okra and thyme added, or is this a Southern dish with baby corn added?  What seasoning to add?  For me, I think this should go all out Asian, with the usual associated flavors of soy sauce, ginger, sesame oil and maybe some sherry for a bit of sweetness.

I have never seen frozen baby corn so I used can and I chose to use fresh okra from my garden. The Smithfield portobello pork loin was excellent and not overly salty like others I've had in the past. The hot sauce was a must in my opinion or else it would have been a little bland. This was super simple and quick and the possibilities for the loins are endless.

Our family truly enjoyed this recipe. 4 people chowed down the whole thing! It was quick and easy to make too!! My kids are freaked out by the baby corn cobs so I substituted canned corn niblets. I also added some salt. All in all a fantastic recipe that I will use often!!!!!
