I thought this soup was wonderful but i did make a few additions. I added carrots and garlic to the sauteed leeks/onions. It was kinda bland so I added about 1 teaspoon of red curry paste..the curry with the coconut milk and pumpkin- so good!Next time I'm going to add basmati rice as well. This is a nice fall soup and super easy!

This was really good - exceeded expectations. From a nutrition point of view it was excellent. The pumpkin (I used butternut squash)and sweet potato has a low G.I. and the servings are low in fat. My family ate a delicious low fat, vegetarian, high in vitamin and mineral soup with a lower glycemic index. Definitely a keeper. Thank you!

I didn't have leeks when I made this, but even without them it was a wonderful soup!  The coconut milk really makes it.  I find that it helps to add some of your own spices.  I added some fresh ginger, some curry powder and a touch of chili peppers to the salt and pepper suggested.

Oh wow! I just ate a huge bowl of this soup over some rice. I added curry powder and ginger, as suggested, along with a clove of garlic. What a wonderful, quick, easy meal idea. I'm going to try adding chicken next time.

An amazing soup! But I like it hot. I mixed in some red thai curry paste to offset the sweetness from the coconut milk.

I love the idea of this soup, but it needs just a little something to give it some oomph--I'm thinking fresh sage, which I'll try next time. I used butternut squash because there is no fresh pumpkin this time of year, so the soup was a touch sweeter than it might otherwise have been. I'll definitely make this again.

This is delicious, healthy comfort food.  I added zuchini, peeled turnips, and used canned pumpkin puree instead of fresh.  Also went with the suggestion of more spices, and tried nutmeg, allspice, ginger and curry.  No need to puree, just mushed the veggies a little, and enjoyed it a bit chunky.

I read other reviews and modified this recipe to my liking. I used 1 large can of pumpkin instead of fresh, 1 tsp red curry paste, 4 large carrots, 4 cloves of garlic and ground pepper. I blended it all until smooth in a blender. This soup is amazing, will definitely make it again!

This was SO good!  Only four stars because although I loved it, my husband didn't rave over it like he usually does for everything I make.  I used onions instead of leeks and left everything chunky, because that's how I like my soup.  I loved the sweetness of the coconut milk.

Very delicate flavors but a small amount is very filling.  Takes better each successive day.  Great as a first course or by itself and relatively easy to make.

Made as stated and really enjoyed it.  (Didn't measure the exact sizes of pumpkin or sweet potato, just used one of each and the whole can of coconut milk.)  I can see why some people thought it needed some pizazz, like garlic, ginger, or spices, and I would suggest that, but I still found it really good without.

This was OK.  Definitely edible, but not great.  My 4 year old would have nothing to do with it.  We coaxed my 7 year old into eating by adding a dash of cinnamon.  I spiced it with two tsp of red curry paste (could have used 3), salt and pepper.  It was an interesting way to use up some leaks we had lying around, but I won't be making it again.

smells good and tastes great.   I added these additional ingredients to the recipe: 2 vegetable bullion cube; roasted or smoked turkey drumsticks cut up; 1 can of bamboo shoot strip in water; creole seasoning; garlic chopped; ginger chopped; curry; Enjoy a healthy meal. You can also serve with basamati rice ***** roasted the pumpkin seed from the pumpkin later.

Im never sure quite how to rate a recipe when modifications are made..this is a nice start, but as written much too bland.  If you combine what you like from this recipe, along with what you like from the Coconut Curry Pumkin Soup recipe (from this site),you will have a perfect soup! Salt is a must.

I didn't have fresh pumpkin so I used a couple more sweet potatoes and then added 1 can of pumpkin when I added the coconut milk. I also pureed in a blender for a smooth consistency.  I added the additional spices as others did.  Maybe it would have more flavor if the sweet potatoes where roasted first? Just ok.

My husband and I made this yesterday; it is very simple to make and we thought it was really yummy. We did follow the advice of one of the other reviewers, and added curry powder and fresh ginger, at the end, when we added the coconut milk. Otherwise I think it would be kind of bland.

Fantastic! I also added a few cloves garlic to the first step as recommended by others. I doubled most of the veggies and cut down on the coconut milk because I was nervous it would b too overwhelming. The taste was bland at first but then added allspice and OMG! Just can't get enough of it!

This soup is so yummy and filling. I altered it a bit by addding a zucchini and substituted the pumpkin with a sugar pie squash (just happened to have it) and also added garlic, curry powder and cumin. yum!

I had just enjoyed this soup in a neighborhood deli.  The next week there it was in my in box.  I love the flavors and pumpkins were everywhere at the time.
