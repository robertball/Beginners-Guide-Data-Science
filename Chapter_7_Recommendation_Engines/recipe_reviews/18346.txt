About 2 hours before we had 20 people in for dinner, my husband convinced me that we didn't have enough side dishes. My pantry was bare except for an abundance of potatoes and I didn't want plain baked. I checked in with this site and found scalloped (since I had never made them before). I sliced up some Kielbasa and grated some cheddar cheese and layered them in this recipe. My guests raved about it! Denyse is right about this being a great dish for fancy meal. PS I used mushroom soup.

We enjoyed this very much.  I used cream of onion soup and didn't use the sliced onion.  I used red skin potatoes and sliced them very thin.  I didn't peel them.  I mixed the soup, milk, pepper, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, 1/4 teaspoon ground mustard and 1/4 teaspoon of paprika with 1 heaping tablespoon of corn starch and then poured over the potatoes.  They cooked up thick and creamy and delicious.

This is a great recipe.  It's just like the one my mom made when I was a kid.  To make it a bit less bland, soak the raw potatoes in cold salt water for a couple hours.  Drain them and par boil them with a can of chicken broth in the water.  This gives the potatoes more flavor and cuts down on the baking time.

I tried this recipe because it was simple.  After reading the reviews I modified it slightly by adding salt to each layer, adding a little crushed garlic to the milk & soup, sprinkling the top with crushed rosemary, and baking it at 450 for one hour covered.  Then I topped it with French Fried Onion rings and let it brown in the oven for an additional 10 minutes.  It was great!  Will definitely serve this at a dinner party.

I added ham and cheese and cut back on the pepper.  My kids really liked this recipe, but it was a bit soupy and could have used some more seasonings.  Next time I'll cut back on the milk and add some salt and seasonings.

Very good! You can vary it by putting different cream soups. Sometimes cream of mushroom, sometimes cream of potato, cream of chicken, broccolli, etc.

With my changes I'd give it 4.5 stars. I halfed recipe (only me & my daughter). Added 1/2 cup sharp cheddar cheese to ingredients. Left potatoes unpeeled, and thinly sliced them. Mixed 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup with 1/2 can of whole milk. Sauteed 1/2 diced onion in a pat of butter. Used 1/8 tsp pepper & 1/2 tsp kosher salt. Layered as follows: 1/2 of everything - potato slices, seasoning, onions, soup mix, cheese, repeat and cooked for listed time & temp. My daughter loves 'em and I was happy with recipe. Wanted a scalloped potato recipe that wasn't swimming in cheese so this had the perfect balance for me.

I use this recipe as a guideline for the cooking time but have made quite a few changes. First I peel, then slice 4 medium-szied potatoes as thin as I can. I put a layer down on a casserole dish, season with salt and pepper, then top it with onions. I then mix together 2 cups of milk and 2 cans of cream of cheese soup (Nacho Cheese soup works too!). Then I pour the soup on top to cover. I repeat the layers until I use up all the potatoes. I can usually do one potatoe per layer. I cook covered for 1 hour, remove the cover and cook for another 30 minutes. Cooking time varies on how thinly you can slice the potatoes. Make sure to put the casserole dish on a foil-lined cookie tray to catch any boil overs.

This is a great recipe.  I added some ham and next time I will probably use less pepper, but I will definately make it again.

I boiled the potatoes for 10-15 minutes before I sliced and baked it all. It only took about 30 minutes to bake. I did need to add a bit of salt and garlic.

This recipe was quite good - except for the directions to add more milk if the sauce does not 'almost' cover the potatoes.  There is no need to do this and as a result, mine came out quite runny and lacked flavour as the addition of milk dilluted the flavour of the mushroom soup.  I added a lot more onion than what was called for and I added a blend of cheeses during the last 20 (or so) minutes of baking.  I will definitly make this dish again, but will not add the extra milk.

Even with adding the onion soup mix, we still thought this recipe lacked in flavor.  I probably wouldn't make this again.  Sorry :(

I agree that this recipe was very simple and easy to make. It was a bit blan, so I added garlic salt and a packet of onion dip mix. It added a lot of flavor to it.  I will make it again, but with my touch ups. :0)  ~lesleylafuze

I have made this a few times and it is just a really quick and easy way to make potatoes (I leave the skins on the potatoes to make it even easier).  I've served with different meat dishes and it goes with just about anything.  It also reheats well in the microwave when I take the leftovers to work the next day.  

This is the first review I've posted, but I figured since this recipe has become somewhat of a regular I ought to tell people about it!  Great way to make potatoes and easy to have a can of soup on hand.

After reading the other reviews, I was prepared for a blah taste.  Instead of 1 1/4 cup of milk, I used 3/4 of milk and 1/2 of chicken broth.  I also used Cream of Chicken and Herb soup.  This recipe was still lacking something, even after I added salt.  I would love to make again, if I can figure out what it is missing!

Ok.... This is fantastic! Here is a fool proof method! Sauté a small cooking onion in large pot on stovetop in butter or margarine. Add salt and pepper. When soft, add minced garlic and small can of mushrooms. After fragrant..... Using whisk, stir in a couple ounces of cream cheese and 1/2 cup of sour cream (or whatever you have leftover in fridge). I had homemade ranch dip made with sour cream and HVR powder, so used that. Stir in can of cream of mushroom soup and fill can with milk and add to pot. Combine well. Stir in a Tbsp. of Worcestershire sauce, more salt and pepper to taste, parsley, garlic powder, (and I also added garlic salt). Stir well and let simmer until fragrant. Stir in your sliced potatoes and cover. Let SIMMER on stovetop in sauce, stirring every 5 or 10 minutes, for at least half hour! Wen almost soft, transfer to casserole dish and slip in oven until potatoes are soft and brown on top! You can add cheese if you like but doesn't need it! I added grated Romano cheese to sauce just because I like a little tang, but that was a personal touch! :). Add sautéed ground beef to make it a meal, serve with tossed salad! Do not omit Worcestershire sauce.... Yummy!

I went ahead and gave this 4 stars but I'm a little on the fence about this recipe.  It's "good" but it's not what I was expecting at all.  It was more like the potatoes and sauce I have had cooked with pork chops than scalloped potatoes.  I did add the ground mustard and paprika and 1/2 c. grated cheese to the dish as well as some salt and pepper, before baking.  I did use the onions.  It was good, especially for being low fat, but I don't feel like it screams "scalloped potatoes" for me.  I will make it again, but maybe try some low fat velveeta or parmesan or something to give it that extra umpf I'm looking for...  Still, great recipe, so glad you shared it!  OH! - Also I used cream of mushroom soup.  Next time I will use cream of chicken and see how that turns out! :)

Delicious and easy!  I added ham and was sure to put a cookie sheet under the dish (having read the reviews), mine bubbled over too. My 2 year old loved it.

Excellent.  This was a huge hit.  I don't know why people were complaining about the baking time being off because mine was perfect and I baked it for exactly an hour.  I sliced mine super thin, so I guess that helped reduce cooking time. Anyways, I seasoned the potatoes with salt, pepper, dried rosemary, and garlic powder and also grated 4 cloves of garlic.  I also thinned out the cream of mushroom mixture with a cup of milk.  Sprinkled some cheddar cheese on the top and it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing this!  I

It wasn't that these tasted bad, in fact, they tasted pretty good (after I added garlic, cheese and additional seasonings.) The reason I am only giving these 2 stars is because it took me 2 days to achieve an edible result. The first night, I had a great dinner planned or my hubby and I (kids with the grandparents) of thick cut ribeyes, broccoli and scalloped potatoes, and because of these, we had no starch, well done steaks and cold broccoli...after an hour and a half in the oven,these still were only half cooked at best, and had managed overflow all over my oven. Not one to waste, I put them in the fridge and planned to use them last night for dinner. After 10 mins in the microwave, then another hour and 15 mins in the oven at 375, these were finally edible...( that's right, an incredible total cooking time of almost 3 hours)but for all that, they were defiantely NOT worth it...my potatoes were sliced very thin, so it wasn't that, and my oven tends to cook hotter than other ovens i've had previously, so I am just trying to figure out what went wrong...but I won't be making these again to find out!  sorry!

I was concerned when I read other reviews that maybe mine would be a little bland or the potatoes would not be cooked throughly, so what I did was slice the potatoes. I put a layer of potatoes, chopped onion and then leftover Honey Baked Ham and then another layer of potatoes and chopped onion. I mixed 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1/2 cup of milk in a bowl then added season salt, onion salt and garlic salt. Once these were all mixed in the bowl I spread the mixture evenly in the pan and covered with foil and cooked for 1 hour. I stirred the mixture and then added more ham and cheese I left the foil off and cooked for another 1/2 hour. Big hit in my household. I will be making this again. Was very flavorful and throughly cooked.

These were almost as good as the ones I make from scratch.  I added cheddar cheese and some salt.  I also cooked them for 30 minutes more than what the recipe called for. I will definately make it again.

Very good! This is a great, simple, way to make scalloped potatoes. I followed the recipe, however I also added 1 C of cheddar cheese to the soup mixture. FANTASTIC!

Very simple and very good.  Next time I will omit the soup though.  I remember my mom layering potatoes, onions, cheese and a couple of Tablespoons of flour.  After about 3 layers she would pour milk over the top and bake covered for 30 minutes.  After 30 minutes uncover and continue to bake for 30 min. more adding cheese when there are 10 min. left.  I baked my potatoes this way mixing the soup with the milk and they were great just I like them a little runnier.  Will make again and again.

Turned out great!  I used 1 cup of 2% milk and 1/4 cup of evaporated milk.  The only thing I changed was the baking time; it took about 1.5 - 1.75 hrs in the oven.  Then, I let them cool for about 15 mins before serving so they weren't too runny.  Will definitely make these again!

Quick and simple enough to make. I was looking for a recipe similar to what MIL uses as DH loves hers. This was pretty close. It did need some extra seasoning, however, as the potatoes were somewhat bland without it.

This was a very tasty dish.  I did have to add more milk in order to almost cover the potatoes and had to add 30 minutes to the cook time as well.  Overall it was a success since my potato-hating husband ate all of it.

Made a huge mess in my pan but was yummy. Creamy & flavorful. The adults & kid liked it. My 11 year old asked for it more often. I used thin sliced potatoes & probably a few too many onions (2 small ones).

This was very bland. I followed some of the other user's suggestions and it was still lacking in flavor. Also, I followed the baking directions as suggested and the potatoes were not cooked :(

 I've had worse, but I won't be making this again.

Easy scalloped potatoes! Put it together and forget about it.  Don't bother with carefully layering potatoes in a scallop pattern...just throw them in.  Taste was creamy and good.  Don't add extra milk, it's soupy as is.  I also recommend a dash of nutmeg for flavor and broiling some cheese on top.

Sorry to give it one star, but I made this exactly as directed for Thanksgiving and no one took seconds or wanted to take home.  Thank goodness I made another dish from this site and everyone loved it.  Regarding this dish, I got comments like, it's too peppery, the potatoes should be sliced not diced and the cream of mushroom is so common.  It's true, COM is such my staple for Make-A-Fast-Meal dish.  So it wasn't special.  I think adding other items would make the difference.  I should've read the other reviews before making it but I was in a hurry!

I decided at the last minute to make scalloped potatoes, and opted to use this recipe as I didn't want to take the time to make them using a traditional recipe.  I must say, I was pleasantly surprised at how they turned out!  They tasted very similar to scalloped potatoes made from scratch.

When making these, I used red potatoes and did not peel. I used my mandolin and sliced them and an onion very thinly. I baked them at 400* for about 50 mins. Covered the first 30 mins and put some sharp cheddar cheese I needed to use up on for the last 10 mins. They were good!

This was very bland. I tried adding salt and pepper, and even a little cheese towards the end but it just didn't seem finished. I also didn't like the onion in there. It was okay but I don't think I'll make again.

Good recipe.  I cut back to just 1 cup of milk, probably could cut back a little more (I like my sauce thick and creamy).  Next time I will add more seasoning.

Great basic recipe, but definitely needs to be seasoned to your specific tastes.  Used my 2 qt casserole dish and it took 2 hrs to cook, so be forewarned-turns out the other reviewers were right.  Also added shredded cheddar, 1/2c sour cream and 1tsp onion powder and was still a little bland.  But great starting point for someone who doesn't have the time to mess with making their own sauce from scratch...

I uses this recipe to make a meal for 40 people at a lunch program. I added layers of ham to make it more filling. Then I added some garlic powder and a some Tex Mex spice to add a bit more flavor. I found the potatoes were runny so I mixed some flour in for the last hour; this could have been because I made such a large quantity. I used 20lbs of potatoes and it took four hours. It turned out really well and got great reviews from everyone.

Always like potato casseroles and this is easy and good.  I do think any cream soup works fine.  I used cream of shrimp and only had 3 potatoes on hand.  Made the adjustments and topped with a grated hard cheese.  Thank you.

Good recipe, I added garlic powder and fresh grated parmesean cheese between the layers, also soaked raw potatoes in cold salt water and partially boiled in chicken broth per another reviewer and it was yummy. First time for my scalloped potatoes for my hubby and he liked. Will make again.

I liked this pretty much but agree that it needs a little more zip so will add the garlic salt or seasoned salt next time.   It definitely needed more cooking time, too.  But I did like it, it was easy, so it's a keeper!

I layered the cheese and soup/milk mixture several times and sliced the potatoes quite thin.  It still took over 90 minutes to bake to the doneness I wanted.  I did double this recipe, so that could affect cooking time.  I also seasoned my dish a bit more with pepper and garlic.  This is a great side dish for a holiday ham.

I used cheddar cheese soup and three large russet potatoes, sliced thinly. This turned out great but a little underseasoned - I would add garlic salt next time.

I took a chance and made this for the first time for company.  I was a little nervous about trying something new when I was having company over.  This was a complete success!!!  My guests ate every last bite and my husband could'nt get enough.  It was so delicious and turned out perfectly with the recipes and directions given.  Thanks so much for the new and easy addition to my menu!!!

This is a good old fashioned recipe...however, I used Cheddar Cheese soup...NUMMERS!!  Sometimes scalloped potatoes can be flat...using this soup rather than cream of chicken or mushroom adds the zip I've always been looking for.  They were gone in a flash!

This tasted good and was so easy.  I like that it used common ingredients that I always have on hand.  The only thing it needed was to bake longer.

This was pretty good.  I added some chopped red pepper with the onions and a chicken bouillon cube (crumbled) into the mushroom soup mixture before pouring over -- think it needed the extra flavor.  I sliced the potatoes instead of cubing -- maybe that's why it took much longer for the potatoes to get done than the recipe says.  I sprinkled some grated cheddar cheese over during the last 20 mins. in the oven.

I thought the mushroom soup would have added a bit more pizzazz to the potatoes, but I didn't think it did. This was okay. I probably won't make it again...sorry

I liked this recipie.  It was easy to make and tasted really good.  Even my picky kids loved it.  It needed a little more salt after cooking--but that was okay.  I will definitely make it again.

I modified this recipe and it was GREAT! I seasoned my potatoes first using garlic powder, minced onions and pepper using my hands to stir.In a bowl I mix cream of mushrooms, butter, water and cheese sauce(Ragu) in the microwave for 1.5 mins then I stirred it.I pour it over my potatoes and took a big spoon to blend it in.I put it in the oven for 1 1/2 hrs uncovered on 350°.It was delicious btw this was my first time and I will make it again.

I just finished eating these scalloped potatoes and my boyfriend and I really enjoyed them! I took advice from others....I soaked the potatoes in salt water after cutting them thinly and I also added a bit of extra milk(but I don't think I will add extra next time). I also added paprika, salt, onion and garlic powder, and oregano.

This is a great starting off point recipe for someone who has never made scalloped potatoes before.  I used cream of mushroom soup, sliced yellow onions, doubled the amount of potatoes (so it wasn't to runny), and added bacon pieces as well to the layers.  Honestly the best ones we've had yet!

Because I had a large-ish casserole full of potatoes, I used two cans of cream soups:  cream of celery and cream of mushroom.  I also added half of a Velveeta brick because I was aiming for the "cheese" potatoes and cut up several breakfast ham steaks.  ThEN, I added the milk, too.  I think that is where I went wrong.  It was WAAAAAY soupy.  After an hour and uber soupy-ness mess, I ended up ladelling out much of the extra liquid, which ACTUALLY ended up being FABULOUS cheese soup.   My potatoes weren't getting done, either, so I put the whole dish in the microwave and nuked it for about  ten minutes, then put it back in the oven on low broil to brown the top.  It took a lot longer than expected, but the flavor was phenomenal.  And now I know how to make cheese soup.  :)  Fabulous.   I know what changes to make next time, too.

These would have only been a four, but I added shredded cheddar during the last ten minutes of cooking.  If there were bacon bits added as well as the cheddar these would be fantastic!  This recipe is a great way to use extra potatoes and would be a nice complement to any meat dish.  Plus it's inexpensive and easy to make, definitely worth making.

This recipe is fantastic! I was definately skeptical about the mushroom soup, but after trying numerous recipes wtih a cream/flour based sauce, I was ready to try it. I added about 4 cloves of grated garlic and after stirring it at the 30 minute mark, I covered it with grated sharp cheddar. It's definately a keeper and a household favorite!

Made this twice. The first time with cream of chicken and the second with cream of mushroom. I preferred the chicken, while my husband the mushroom. To say, both were delicious.We did add cheese (personal preference) and we had to cook much longer than recipes states...but well worth the wait. I will make again and again and again!

This was a good basic recipe, just have to add a few more things for flavor.  I added some sour cream, fresh thyme, a little garlic and some shredded cheese. I topped it with french-fried onion rings. It also took forever to bake.  It was very tasty once it was done. (Almost 2 hours)

This is was good. My boyfriend really enjoyed it. I thought I would try something new...I did change a few things though. I used tri colored potatoes (red, yellow, and purple) sliced them into thin slices, mixed cream of mushroom soup with the pepper, a lil nutmeg, a couple tablespoons onion soup mix, milk and corn starch. After I mixed it all up I poured it over the potato and onions then sprinkled with a mixed shredded cheese blend and couple slices of prosciutto. It baked up creamy and delicious. I will def. make again...next time I want to add thyme and rosemary...I think herbs would give it a nice touch...maybe serve next to rosemary roasted chicken and use some of the extra soup mix as a gravy. YUM!

I recommend thinly slicing the pototoes and soaking it in salt water for about 1 hour.  Then boil it in hot water for another 5 minutes or so to reduce the baking time.  Also when mixing the ingredients in the bowl be a little more generous with the salt.

I made this last night with a glazed ham and it was out of this world.  My 13 year old is VERY picky and she ate three helpings. She doesn't like onion pieces so I used 1/2 tsp onion powder for the taste and added cheddar cheese to the soup and on top at the last 20 minutes. DO NOT add the extra milk..not needed!  Just like all the reviews say it does take alot more time to cook.  Also I sliced the potatoes instead of cubing. I will be making this again..in fact my daughter asked me to make it again tonight before she left for school.

A new twist on an old favorite.  I used cream of chicken soup, and it was rich and tasty.  Thinking about using cream of cheddar the next time I make this!

I only had about an hour to make these, so I nuked the potatoes for 15 minutes after peeling them. For more flavour, I added 3 cloves of chopped garlic to the mix, as well as 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarela on top. This recipe was easy and very good!

Added 1 cup Cheddar Cheese and garlic to the soup and milk mixture. Also used 1/2 milk and 1/2 half and half to  keep the sauce a little thicker.

Very good. I layered some cheese in the middle & on top as well. It did need quite a bit more cooking time than called for though.

This recipe was ok.  I did what the recipe said about adding more milk if it didn't cover the potatoes, and I don't think I should have done it.  My recipe was a bit runny.  They tasted ok...but needs a little more flavor per my family. I may try again and add some seasoning, etc.

This recipe is easily converted to each persons tastes, which makes it so great.  I used cheese and broccoli soup and also added mozzerella and cheddar cheese.  The liquid did not cover the potatoes, I didn't add extra milk, and I was glad that I didn't after I started cooking it.  It turned out wonderfully, this is a great recipe that is easy to change-up everytime you make it.

Used this for my mom's birthday dinner. I used c. of chicken to tie in the grilled chicken we were having, added some chives into the mix and some cheese to the finished project. Everyone loved it and was impressed. 4* b/c I made changes.

These turned out great this time. I had made them about 2 years ago and wasn't fond of them (based on my review, LOL) .... I made them again this past week and we really did like them. I also added some shredded cheddar cheese.

I used this recipe as a foundation for a one-dish meal.  I added ham, peas, and corn, along with Velveeta cheese to the mix.  I did add a little salt and used onion powder instead of onion since I didn't have any onions. (I used cream of mushroom soup)  The end result was a creamy cheesy mix that had everyone asking for more!  Next time, I may add just a little less milk--it diluted the cheese flavor just a bit too much in my opinion.  Believe me-I am not a kitchen whiz, but this recipe helped me to look like one--thanks!

Super easy and good tasting recipe.  I doubled the recipe and added 1 pouch of lipton's french onion soup mix and the flavour was very nice.  Next time thought I think I will slice the potatoes instead of cubing them.  Thanks for sharing.

I really enjoyed these potatoes and so did my husband. For the soup, I used Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic (Campbell's) and it was delicious! I will definitely make this again. I used one less potato than the recipe calls for.

It was easy but we found it to be bland!  I needed some cheese.  But that is probably just a matter of personal taste.  Thanks for submitting!

Very easy. Never made scalloped potatoes before because I don't like them. Made these for my wife and she ate them for 3 days straight (made lots).  Very popular.

Thes potatoes were delicious.  The only change is I used cream of onion soup as something else recommended and I really liked it.  I will make again and will sprinkle with cheese next time - maybe Parmesan!

Here is the key -- add a package of Lipton dry soup to the cream of mushroom and the milk, mix up and that gives a GREAT flavor to the potatoes.  Everyone raved about this recipe.

I used a can of Campbell's mushroom soup and followed the instructions exactly. Found this dish very bland with a very boring zest of heat from the pepper. If it wasn't for the onion it would have no flavor at all.  I also experimented adding 4 diced fresh garlic cloves to another batch with no added success to amplify the taste.

Recommend adding shredded cheese to the dish after you remove from the oven to give it some additional flavor and texture. Also broiling the dish for an additional 5 minutes can make the world of difference.

Second attempt. I pretty much followed the recipe but used once can of milk. I also put cheese in middle and on top and melted butter with mixed breadcrumbs. I'm experimenting with how long to cook and when to take the tinfoil off - still not perfect! I didn't try stirring mid way through and this might be helpful.

I used cream of mushroom, but mixed paprika and dill into it aswell as the pepper and about 1 1/2 cans of whole milk. I also added a little bit of marble cheese. Baked for 30 mins covered and 45 uncovered. Turned out really well.

Very good. I used cream of potato soup instead of cream of mushroom, as I had a can that needed to be used.  I will continue to use cream of potato soup in the future, as you really get only potato flavor.  Will make this again.

Just tried this for a family reunion. I added salt, garlic, onion and sharp cheddar cheese.  It took forever to cook up in the crock pot so I cooked it 18 minutes in the microwave, it still could have been cooked longer. I will fix again but add more of all the stuff and cook potatoes first.

I used more potatos, so I used 2 cans of soup.. but didn't double the milk.  I also use a whole small onion, and I mean small, but I think it was a bit too much.  They were a bit runny even though I let them rest about 15 minutes before serving.  I also cooked them for 2 hours.  All and all, they were good and I am hoping that the leftovers will microwave well, assuming they will be creamier since there's so much sauce.

Yes, I did it with only the addition of some shredded cheddar and mozzarella. I'd recommend sprinkling a bit of salt and fresh ground pepper as you layer. This was almost a main dish. Making it again tonight and added a little leftover sour cream. It was so beautiful last time, I did not want to stir it, so I just put it back and let those golden brown spots form all over the top. Wonderful to eat.

We added broccoli, peppers(the other kind), tomatoes, and Parmesan to our scalloped potatoes. It tasted great but we forgot the black pepper though. We didn't have to bake so long.

I made this recipe yesterday and this dish was amazing and so easy to make. I used 1/2 can of cream of mushroom and 1/2 can of cream of chicken. I topped it with a 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese too. My husband asked me to make this dish again this weekend and for thanksgiving! Thanks Denyse!

The first time I tried this recipe the potatoes came out a little hard.  This might have been due to the fact that my oven heating element went out on me during the cooking time and had to take it to my mother's to finish the cooking.  Will definitely try again.

This was good, but I have to say 4 stars because the cooking time is way off. I halved the recipes and mine still took over an hour to cook through and my potatoes were VERY thin. I added shredded mild cheddar in between the layers and on top, yum. Loved the cream of mushroom soup in there, tasted great. Thank you :)

This really was a hit!  I really like cheesy potatoes, so I added about 12 oz cheddar.  I was in a hurry & forgot the onion, but followed another reviewer's suggestion of the French's onions on top.
Thanks so much for sharing!

This is a great recipe but we prefer it without the onions.  I have fixed it both ways.

I followed this recipe exactly as it says and it turned out horrible. As easy as the recipe sounds, I most definitely would NOT recommend this recipe to anyone.

Not quite as good as mom's, but still pretty tasty. I halved the recipe and found that I didn't need the full cooking time. Per other reviews, I added some extra salt, pepper and garlic.

Turned out like potato soup. Very runny, it never got thick at all. I baked it for an extra hour hoping it would thicken up but it didn't. I did add extra milk like the recipe said, but that was a big mistake. Potatoes swimming in warm milk is what I ended up with. YUCK!  Also, incredibly bland.
Embarassing to have a flop like this when I had company over.

This was very tasty, but not what I was expecting.  It all got eaten up, but I was not able to get a nice brown "crust" on top without the rest of it drying out.

Will make again and keep working with it.

This recipe was OK but it was very bland and it didn't get gobbled up like other scalloped potatoe recipes that I've fixed.

I'm not too sure about this recipe...although I made some changes and that may have been where I went wrong.  I sliced the potatoes rather than cube them and also added a little cooked ham and a bit of cheese.  I used a can of cream of mushroom soup and the called for amount of milk.  Here's where things got strange...it took over 2 hours to cook.  I even used an oven thermometer to make sure it wasn't my oven that was the problem. I don't think I'll be making this one again.

This was just okay in my opinion.  Someone asked to take the leftovers home though; so, maybe I'm just not a scalloped potatoes fan.

They were pretty good, but i found i had to add extra sauce and lots of cheese to make them taste better.

I DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS THE BEST DISH. I HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE POTATOES NOT COOKING THROUGH IN THE GIVEN TIME.MY FAMILY DIDN'T THINK IT HAD ENOUGH FLAVOR.
