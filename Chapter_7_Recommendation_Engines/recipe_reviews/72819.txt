Hi Everyone, I'm Claudygirl.  First, a reminder to use 2.5 teaspoons of yeast, not a package that has 2.25.  Some have complained that they didn't rise well, but the recipe was changed after I submitted it.  And, thank you for all the great reviews.

Fabulous.  I made a few modifications- I used about 1/2 of an onion, finely diced and sauteed, instead of the other onion ingredients and did not top them.  I also used oats instead of potato flakes (they didn't need to be chopped up- they just melt into the dough).  Another thing I altered was that I used all water.  In my experience, breads made with milk get tough quickly and aren't that good unless they're super fresh.  Makeing it with all water keeps it fresher longer.  But these were wonderful!  My husband called them "a little piece of heaven."

Fantastic Onion Rolls! We’ve made them for burgers, pulled pork and lunchmeat sandwiches. We loved the onion flavor of these rolls so much that I will never buy them from the bakery again. I made one small change to the recipe since I do not have dried onions on hand and that was to sauté about 1/4 cup worth of onions to get the moisture out and they worked out fine every time. I also don’t have a bread machine which is simply to proof the yeast and only start out with 1 ½ to 2 cups of flour and knead in the last cup. Knead for the standard 8 or so minutes and let rise, covered, in a warm place for an hour or more and then follow recipe from step 2. They are Easy to make without a bread machine and Mmmmm are they sooooo good!

Although I don't have a bread machine, these rolls turned out great! I used my Kitchen Aid Mixer and made them (somewhat) the old fashioned way. I did not have dried onion flakes, which, in the end I was actually happy about, because I finely diced a fresh onion and then fried in a pan until very brown. The rolls tasted bakery fresh Claudy and we were all very happy! Thanks so much for a weeks worth of lunch sandwiches!

Our family loves these rolls! I usually brush the tops with melted butter instead of egg white since my oldest is allergic to eggs. Be sure to note that 2.5 tsp of yeast will cause the rolls to rise better than only one pkg, which only has 2.25 tsp.

Delicious!  Be warned that these have a very strong onion flavor but my family loves onions so we all loved them!  I agree with the reviewer who said they taste like onion bagels.  I substituted the milk with water and used ground oats in place of the potato flakes.  I got 14 dinner size rolls out of this recipe but will double next time and try freezing some. Thanks!

FANTASTIC!  I use these a lot, make them about once a week.  Tonight we're using them toasted for French Dip sandwiches.  

I didn't modify the recipe in any way, so the review is "as is" and it's great!!!

Yum! Super easy & worth every bit of (little) effort involved! Even the shaping step was simple and I'm not a baker per se (which is the reason I waited so long to try these...). Made these to serve w/  slow cooker French dips (lonwolf32). I'm used to French dips on crusty bread, but as it turns out, onion rolls are an excellent substitue! I pretty much followed claudygirl's directions to the letter except for 3 (minor) changes. Not wanting tough rolls, I used all H2O. I also flash fried 1/4 c. of fresh, finely choped onion instead of using the dried minced variety in my topping mixture (I added dried onion to my dough, but didn't have enough left for the topping also). Finally, I added about an 1/8 c. of poppyseeds to my topping. The popular St. Rosen's brand onion rolls include poppyseeds in theirs, so I decided to do the same! :) NOTE: This recipe yeilds 1 lb. worth of dough. My bread machine users manual includes several recipes, one of which is an rye onion roll recipe. The 8 roll yeild instructs to chose the 1 lb. loaf setting. Additionally, your liquid should be no cooler than 98 degrees F & no warmer than 105 F to be considered "lukewarm." Oh, and be SURE to increase the amount of yeast to 2.5 t as claudy's top review suggests. Doing so will yield a batch of perfectly risen rolls! I'm SOOOO glad to have given these a try. These were FANTASTIC fresh & just as good the next day! This recipe will be added to my keeper file for sure. Thanks for sharing, claudygirl! :-)

For whatever reason, my dough didn't rise, and I ended up tossing out the dough and starting from scratch, but my second batch didn't really rise much either.  I shrugged my shoulders and popped the rolls in the oven anyway, and they ended up puffing up nicely while cooking.  So despite all my worries, they turned out perfectly!  I didn't have any dried minced onion, so I put fresh minced onion inside the dough.  I flash-fried some more fresh minced onion in very hot oil for a few seconds until it was golden and put this on top of the rolls before baking.  The flash-fried onions were a flavorful addition.  Great recipe!  We had BBQ beef sandwiches on these rolls.

These are dry as written.  I should've added more liquid but by the time i realized it was on the rise cycle and i didn't feel like adding at that point.  I'd add more liquid, probably at least 2 more tbs to help it out.  They do taste like onion bagels.  Thanks!

Great sandwich rolls!  2nd time I made these, I left out the onion ingredients and made regular dinner rolls. Both times rolls were delicious!!  Highly recommend this recipe!

Taste on this is great. I had some trouble with the second rise though. Let me start at the beginning! I do not have a bread machine, so I proofed the yeast with the sugar and water, then added everything else (heated up the milk to 110 before adding). I was out of dried onions (shame on me) so I diced some fresh, 3 T. Then I kneaded for about ten minutes and let rise in a bowl dusted with flour in my oven, with a bowl of boiling water and the door shut. When it was just shy of double I took it out and re-kneaded, then formed into rolls on ungreased pans and put back in the oven with fresh boiling water. They took forever to rise; after an hour and a half I got impatient and did the egg wash (make sure your egg white is room temp to avoid deflating the dough), then topped with a sprinkle of fresh parmesan cheese and some flash-fried onions. Cooked about 20 minutes, they puffed a little bit more. They got a beautiful golden brown color, the house smelled absolutely divine, and the rolls tasted fantastic. They are lighter than I was expecting, I thought because they are not as big as I wanted them my air pockets would be too small for a soft bread, but they are actually really great. UPDATE: Made these again with much better luck! They are soft and flavorful and amazing with dried minced onions! First rise took about an hour, second one 50 minutes. Added poppy seeds to the top dressing :)

The smell of these baking is awesome. Followed the recipe to a "T". The yeast amount is 2.5 tsp Love these rolls with a burger on them or slathered with butter right from the oven. Mmmmm UPDATE: I made this into a loaf in the bread machine layering the ingredients according to the manufacturer's recommendations. It came out awesome, sliced well and was truly great for grilled cheese and cold sandwiches too! See pic

So GOOD!  Very tasty with our stew for dinner.  Made these using 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups bread flour.  I added 1 tsp vital wheat gluten.   Didnt have potato flakes so I tossed a small potato in the microwave and cooked it  fully.  About 8 minutes. I scraped out 1/4 cup, maybe a little more as I didnt wast any of the potato, and added it to tne mixture.  They were so good the kids even used the leftover buns to make their lunches for school tomorrow!  Will surely make this over and over again!---------------------------------------------------------------------made these again for our crab cake dinner.  This time I followed the recipe exactly and did not use WW flour.  Still and exellent recipe - so easy!  Next up will be onion wirh RYE flour!  This is a nice recipe and yo should try it!

These rolls are fantastic! Like others, I didn't have a bread machine-- I started with the warm milk and water, added the yeast and mixed. Then added all the other ingredients and mixed in my KitchenAid on 2 for about 8 minutes. (I left out the onion powder, added sauteed chopped onions on the tops of half of them before baking)
I let the dough rise in a slightly warm oven for 1 hour, then continued with step 2.

They took slightly longer to bake for me to get golden, as I use stoneware pans. About 30 minutes. But they were "better than store bought!" according to my 9 year old!

Delicious, soft and oniony.  I realize looking back at the recipe now that the rolls are out of the oven that I neglected to put the potato flakes in.  I don't know what difference that would make because they are wonderful!  I doubled the onion powder because I really wanted an onion taste, used 1 cup of whole wheat flour in place of the ap, making by hand I probably only used 2 1/2 cups of flour total.  I soaked some dried minced onion in a little hot water to put on top before baking.  These will make wonderful fresh tomato sandwiches!  Thanks!

These turned out rather nice despite my budding bread making skills. This recipe is so easy as the bread machine does most of the work. I cannot for the life of me divide dough evenly. When I must even it out I'm forever dealing with separating creases that refuse to smooth out and blend completely. I worry that this may make the end product full of air holes. I fear the extra handling may cause tough bread. I'm also very shape challenged. Make a round mound? Heart, oval, square, oblong... everything but! This recipe is hardly to blame for my failings and I shouldn't be so hard on myself. Bread making takes much practice. If shaping ability is a main shortcoming, then I should be grateful and happy. And I really am. Tonight I made steak sandwiches a la Pioneer Woman. Normally I go for the bakery made onion buns but I'm pinching pennies and had the ingredients for these rolls. I followed a re-viewer's suggestion to top with caramelized onions; A wonderful tip but I must find a way to make the onion bits to stick to the bun tops better.   These rolls had great flavour and just about perfect density. Perfect for a dinner sandwich. Thank you for the great recipe. I will make these again for sure. Practice, practice, practice!

I made these for leftover smoked turkey sandwiches and they were the best sandwiches I've ever eaten!  I used oats instead of potato flakes because I didn't want to go to the store, added a tablespoon or more of water in the knead cycle in the bread machine, used a whole onion softened in butter and split for a little on the tops but most in the dough.  I still used a little dried onion for extra flavor.  I made the dough and shaped them the night before and just popped the sheet in the fridge until an hour or so before baking.  They were so good!

wonderful.  I ran out of dehydrated onions.  I had used them up making onion garlic bagels.  I did have dried chives so I said what the heck.  Can't hurt.   Came out really nice with a subtle flavor of chives.  Great recipe.  Thanks

I love these and make them quite a bit, especially if we are having hamburgers. For an extra kick you can add 1 tsp of paprika which somehow enhances the flavor.

These were to die for, absolutely delicious.  The only thing I would change would be to soak the dried onion that goes on top before baking a little.  The onions were very crunchy and flaked off, but still DELICIOUS!!  Will never buy onion rolls at the market again.

easy and good! we didn't think the onion was too overpowering: my son finished it off this morning with chocolate hazelnut spread... if I may suggest anything, it's to add some little more milk while the machine is making the dough.

I have made this several times now and the rolls are awesome.  I make a half batch (4 rolls) formed round and baked in a 9 inch cake pan...the pan helps keep the rolls soft.  I like poppy seeds on top.

These were absolutely fantastic with the Philly Cheesesteak from this site.  I made as written with the dried onions but I did top them with sesame seeds instead as I thought there was enough onion flavor going on.  I shaped into 6 hoagie rolls and they held up perfectly to the "sloppy" cheesesteaks.  I would definitely make these again, and so easy using the bread machine.

Awesome recipe!  I used sauteed onion in place of the dried minced, and added a little on top before baking for appearance.  I served the Original Italian Beef, from this site, on them & some melted provolone.  I will definatly be making these again!

Made these to go with 'BBQ Pork for Sandwiches' from this site & they were great. Sort of dense, but it worked with this recipe. They had a great taste & soaked up the juice well. My husband love onion & liked the rolls as well. I followed the recipe exactly, but left out a bit of the onion powder. I also did mine the old fashioned way...not in a bread maker. Which made the first rise time about 1 hour, covered in a warm place. Good sandwich roll recipe, thanks! ~I also increased the yeast to 2 1/2t yeast.

These are postively delicious!  They are perfect for any type of sandwich.  They would be good as dinner rolls too.  I had one right out of the oven with butter on it.  YUM.

I'd make these again. They were pretty tasty.  I didn't have dried onion, so used equal measurement of Lipton's onion soup mix. Cut back a bit on salt and onion powder as it was already in the soup mix. I bet these would make a great roast beef sandwich!

Sorry, but I did not like these. The flavor wasn't 'wow' and the texture was a bit too dense for me - I did use 2 1/2 tsp of yeast. I make fresh bread every day, so I'm not a novice. The dough seemed good mixing it up, but not happy with the end result. (I used fresh onion and sauteed it like others.) I think I'll try adding onion to one of our other recipes to create an onion bread for my husband who has been asking.

We loved these rolls!! First of all I wanted to say how easy the dough was to work with. They came out just perfect. I used a mixed onion blend of red onions, white onions, and chives. I then sprinkled some Pecorino Romano cheese on top just before I put them the oven to bake. Thanks so much for this recipe! Yummy!

I want to start by saying the only reason I'm not giving this a 5 is because I tweaked it; I was very very happy with the basic recipe and made exactly the soft rolls I was looking for! I needed a soft submarine roll without herbs, oats, or a crust and this was perfect. I reduced the sugar to 2 Tbsp. since I didn't want it too sweet and reduced the salt to 1 tsp. since I used salted butter. I also removed all the onion items for a plain flavor and attempted to make them into roll shapes, with medium success. These rolls were chewy, soft, filling, and very easy to make. Next time I'll double the recipe!

these are a little too bready for us as sandwich rolls, but they're still good.  i use the recipe to make a loaf in my oven--FANTASTIC!  its perfect for sandwich bread!  i've been searching for a recipe like this forever!  used my bread machine to make the dough and then punched down, loosely rolled up jelly-roll style and let rise about 45 min in a loaf pan.
when making rolls, i scaled the recipe up to 12 buns and thats as much as my bread machine will hold as it rises.

GREAT GREAT GREAT! My husband is one of those men who when you think something taste awsome he just replies "it's good".
Well with this one he said WOW YOU made THIS?!!!!!!! It's REALLYYYY good."
 I myself would use less salt next time maybe omit the 1/2 tsp. Also a helpfull  hint,....make sure egg white is room temperature so the coldness doesn't deflate your rolls on contact and make sure to lightly spray cookie sheet w/ cooking spray. Also I sprinkle garlic powder on top along w/ the onion bits. These make great rolls for a egg sandwhich! P.S. My 5 year old daughter HATES onions,.... well I didn't tell her what was in and on top because she didn't ask,... and needless to say she even loved them.

These were great.    I did brush the rolls with the egg wash before letting them rise the second time and put the extra dried onion on top after soaking in a bit of water.  I find that they didn't burn.  Thanks!

Awesome bread!  Our friends thought it came from the store!  I made it into a loaf and it turned out great.  Tweek on the amount of onion ingredients to your liking as it is 'oniony.'  Perfect as is for my taste though!!!

I made these without the onion flavoring and they were excellent with pulled bbq pork.  I didn't let them rise for 40 minutes, it was more like 15 because I didn't have time, but they were so good.  Not too thick or thin.  Apparently people are having different experiences with it, so it's not for me to say how yours will turn out, but I had a good experience and will definitely make them again.

Easy and ever so good!  I doubled the recipe to make 32 rolls, used 1/3 wheat flour, egg washed and sprinkled poopy seed on top.  Slightly crisp exterior, soft interior and delicious onion flavor.  Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe

This is an amazing and delicious recipe. I live in California and I found I needed about 1 and 1/8 cups of milk. The dough is too dry otherwise and will not rise. Don't know if anyone else has a problem with this.

Before tasting,I thought these rolls looked and felt like they were going to be a little too dense to my liking.  However, after tasting, I thought they were wonderful and worked very well for finger sandwiches, when cut in half.  The flavor was spot on!  Thanks for sharing, claudygirl!

Great rolls!  I have to add almost half a cup of warm water in addition to what is listed for my bread maker. The rolls come out fabulous. I bake them on a pizza tray (round with holes on the bottom).

These were very good for making sandwich buns.  I went by the recipe except used all water instead of milk and for the topping I sauteed up slivers of onion to use instead of the dried and just lightly sprayed the tops with oil spray.  These make a lot, so the first day I used half the recipe to make the sandwich buns.  My husband had a sandwich for lunch the next day with them and said they were still soft.  Obviously two days later they began to become stale which is normal for fresh bread.  My sandwich rolls were pretty flat but that may of been my fault because in the middle of rising I noticed my paper towel started to stick to the tops and I deflated them a bit.  The next night I made these as rolls, 8 of them for half the recipe.  They were also good but I think I liked them a little better as sandwich buns.  They did have a lot of onion flavor in them.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I made for vegi burgers and they were yummy.  Only changes were:  1.did not have milk so used all water 2. did not have onion powder so omitted.  They were still very oniony without the powder and dont think I would add if I had it.  I cut into 15 pieces and they were just the right size.  I think 8 would be huge.  The dough needed a very long first rise to double, but worth the extra time.

There were great. Did not want these to be dairy.  I used soy milk instead of milk and 5 tsp of dry yeast for a double recipe. I subbed oil for butter. I egged with whole egg not just yolk and baked longer than suggested.  I wrapped each in foil and froze and rewarmed in my oven - tasted like fresh baked, they were amazing.  They were not very heavy on the onion flavor though if that is what you are looking for.  It was subtle.

These came out very good. The recipe was along the lines of a yeast roll recipe I use. They tasted like that except with onion. I made them for pulled pork sandwiches. I didn't have any dehydrated onion so I did like some others and sauteed some raw onions until they dried out. The rolls still came out good. Thx :)

Mmmmmm!……….Who can resist fresh onion rolls?  These are perfect and so easy to make.  No bread machine required.  I mixed and kneaded them in my KA, but you can easily do it by hand.   You won’t be disappointed.  They are truly soft and much better than store bought.

Excellent! They stay nice and soft, but are oh so yummy. I'd give it five, but personal preference makes me want to dump even more onion in there.

These were wonderfully soft and delicious. I do not think they were overly onion flavored and they were great for sandwiches! The whole family, including my kids, loved them! Made as is except used sauteed onions, I put all of them inside the dough. I topped some with sesame seeds and some with poppy seeds. My husband couldn't believe I made them and they were so easy!

Definitely a solid 5 star recipe.  We loved these rolls.  They taste great, and they have a nice soft texture.  I am out of butter so I subbed margerine, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  When I saw how nice the dough turned out, I knew these would be winners.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

We are onion roll lovers and we thought these were AWESOME! Made them exactly as written, except formed into 6 rolls instead of 8 to use as hamburger buns, which was the perfect size for us. Also, I topped mine with toasted dried onions and poppyseeds before scoring the tops with a knife (just for looks, lol). They were perfect in every way...I will definately be making these again, and OFTEN! Thanks for sharing. :)

This are dense top notch rolls with an intense, melt-in-your-mouth onion kick!

Soft with mild onion flavor, and I surely would NOT consider them "dense." Everyone likes them, and we made Southern Pulled Pork sandwiches -- wonderful! I used 1 pkt + 1/4 tsp yeast (as per Claudygirl, recipe's creator) and baked 13 minutes. I had to add about 4 Tablespoons of water while mixing, as the dough was very dry.  Dough had a nice feel to it when kneading. MUCH better sandwich rolls than many of the others on the site. Flavor is good, without overpowering what's inside. Thanks!

These are fantastik! I, too, had no potato flakes and substituted oatmeal.  These have a great bread flavor and texture, SOOOOO much better than those 'puffs of air' hamburger buns.  Made exactly as directed, except for the oatmeal sub. Will definately make these again for chicken salad sandwiches and burgers!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are very very easy to make. They turn out perfect everytime. I make with and without onions as some of my kids dont like onion.Non onion rolls get cheddar and jack cheese, sometimes spicy jack, just depends what I have on hand. Always a winner with these rolls.

Wonderful! I used 21/2 tsp. yeast, and did not put the topping on before baking. I did brush the buns with butter after they came out of the oven. Soft and tasty and the bottoms have a little crunch to them.     Delicious!

I ended up with 2 batches of these...the first time I accidentally added water instead of milk but didn't realize it until after the bread machine was mixing...so rather than throw it away, I just let it go and made another batch with the milk.  I could hardly tell the difference.  I made them by the recipe but I didn't have any onion powder left, so I omitted that...they were phenominal!    We ate them warm as hamburger buns...yummy!

Oh, yeah! These rolls are the cat's meow, awesome, da bomb! I, too, have baked up many a disappointing batch of rolls. These are what I have been looking for. Nice with or without the onions on top. Try them with Dan's Favorite Chicken Sandwich from this site and some pan fried pickled jalepenos. Oh, WOW!

I have made this recipe, as written, many times. Once you try these you will never buy the ones from the store again. They are SO good and have a great onion flavor but not too much.  The only downside - they smell heavenly when baking.

I've been making these for a while now. They are great for sandwiches and as dinner rolls. I haven't bought sandwich rolls since I found this recipe. These work well whether made with milk, water or buttermilk.

These were very good. Kind of a lot of work for making Hamburger Buns -- but my Husband was Ecstatic!! My Brother-In-Law wanted the recipe :) **Helpful Hint: I purchased 3 sets of Mini Cake Pans (in the wedding section of Target -- made by Wilton) and they made perfectly shaped buns and helped to rise taller instead of wider. 3 sets equals 9 pans,

I loved these rolls.  I proofed the active dry yeast for 10 minutes with the sugar first.  Used olive oil instead of butter and water instead of milk. I also used double amounts of onion powder and only 2 tbl of the minced.  I cooked them on the second from bottom rack in the oven for about 20 minutes and spritzed them with water the first 10.  I also brushed rolls with olive oil before baking and sprinkled some poppy seeds on them as well.

I don't have a bread machine, so I processed these using my KitchenAid, and I let them sit for about an hour (didn't increase in size at all, unfortunately).  After additional kneading (after that first hour), I don’t know if this is standard, but it took my rolls almost 3 hours to double in size!  I was going to just throw in the towel after the first 40 minutes, but luckily my husband had an additional 2 hours of yard work to do.  So, I set the baking sheets of rolls on my dishwasher (which had recently ran a load and was still quite warm) with the towel over them and took my time.  Lo and behold, when I finally went to throw them in the oven, they had finally almost doubled in size. *LoL*  Maybe it’s because we live in Phoenix and are already running our air conditioning throughout the house (set to about 80 degrees)?  Who knows.

Overall, they were very yummy, even though they didn’t raise quite enough.  We will definitely be eating them again!

(For those wondering, the only thing I had to change (as we don’t use milk) is I changed the milk to water.  I used a .25 ounce packet of active dry yeast, as per the instructions.)

I found this to be really dense, kind of plain and not oniony enough. Kind of disappointed, but I might try it again, with modifications.

For my first attempt, I used soy milk instead of water or milk. Also, after the dough cycle finished in the bread machine, I didn't take it out right way to shape the loaves because I was working on other things. I just left the dough ball in the bread machine for about 40 minutes, then took it out, shaped it, and put it in my convection oven/microwave for 180C (my oven only does increments of 10C degrees) for 20 minutes. It came out kind of pale, but that's probably because my oven just takes longer, even though convection ovens are supposed to bake things faster.

To serve, I toasted it twice, and dipped it into warm, salted butter (kind of like a garlic knot, but with onions). Next time, I'll try following the directions more closely, and put more salt and onions for more flavor.

So simple to make and they taste wonderful. I made these yesterday. Used about two large onions and I felt it needed maybe one more. This dough is extremely sticky. Like one other reviewer, I gave up trying to form into balls and just emptied the dough into the pan. I couldn't even score it. Cooked it about 5 minutes and cut it before serving. Huge rolls and will freeze the rest.

I made this as a loaf, not wanting to deal with shaping into rolls. I flung the ingredients into my bread maker and hit go. Four hours later, I was rewarded with a sturdy, slightly crusty loaf. It won't be great for PB&J, but for my boyfriend's daily ham sandwich, I imagine it'll be delish.

Very good, and very easy.  I did have a bit of trouble getting mine to make bun shapes, so only two of them were actually round, but tasty all the same.  I'll cut back a bit on the onion to my tastes next time.  Used butter flavor shortening rather than butter because I'm lazy and butter was in the fridge.  Used evaporated milk in the dough, as well as mixed with my egg white for topping.  Dough is a treat to work with after the dough cycle, altho I did have to add a bit of milk to this during the mix cycle, but my flour is ultragrain, so it's a touch dry.  Thanks for sharing!

Awesome taste, super easy.  Did not change a thing.  Made spicy chicken salad to eat with it.  Kids loved it too.  Only half of the rolls made it to the supper table.  Will be making this again in the near near future!!

I had to add a lot more liquid to make this dough come together, the first time was a disaster! Since then I have just added additional water to it and they are fabulous. I even wrote about them on my blog and gave them four out of five wooden spoons. Thanks so much, this recipe brought me right back to my childhood.

These rolls are awesome... I LOVE onion. But just like other reviews I had problems with my rolls rising and I used the recommended amount of yeast. The taste and moistness were still great tho.

These are YUMMY! I will not buy them from the store again. I did alter the recipe slightly. I omitted the dried minced onions completely, upped the onion powder to 1 1/2 teaspoons and did dice and saute a small onion for the tops. I made these for BBQ pulled pork sandwiches but these are so easy to make and so good, I'd make these for anything.  lol  I definitely will be making these next time for hamburgers.

These rolls were delicious!!! I actually misread the directions and didn't add minced onions into the dough, only onion powder. I didn't have dried onions, so I cut up an onion and sauteed it in the pan and sprinkled it on top of the rolls before baking. Even without additional onions in the dough, it was still so yummy! Can't wait to make again!

This is very good & very easy.  I made them the "old fashioned" way - sans bread machine or fancy mixer.  Just measuring cups/spoons, a bowl & my 2 hands (tho I did use a digital thermometer to temp my water so I didn't accidentally kill the yeast)I had a roast in the crockpot & wanted to use the leftovers to make sandwiches for lunch the next couple of days but had no bread in the house & am trying to improvise from items in the house instead of running to the store.  I am NOT an accomplished bread cook - I've made Parmesan herb bread 2X (the one from this site that cooks in a 2 qt casserole dish) & Jay's pizza dough once.  If I can make this by hand, anyone can.  Oh & after my limited experience making "yeast" products by hand, I may never use my bread machine again, as I loathe dragging it from it's storage location, layering the ingredients, cleaning it after use & putting it away again.

These rolls are awesome!  I didn't have onion powder or dried minced onion, so I used real onion and finely chopped it.  Then I melted the 3 tablespoons of butter and sauteed the onions in it so the butter was infused with the onion flavor.  The result was wonderful!  I had one this morning with an egg and ham on it.  Delicious!  I will make these again for sure!

This is so good! We've been blessed with a bounty of tomatoes this year, but if I have to eat one more BLT or tomato sandwich on sandwich bread I will scream! I made these today and they are wonderful.  Tasty, airy, the texture is just perfect.  I didn't have any minced onions so I did as others did and fried up some vadalia onion on my own and added some to the mixture and some to the top.  I can't wait for hubby to come home to these!  I will for sure be making these over and over.  Thanks!

I made these rolls as the original poster suggested using 1/4 cup dried onions in the dough and 2 1/2 t. yeast (bread machine).  I also used dried milk and did not brush the rolls with egg white nor did I top them with additional dried onions as I thought the onion flavor was sufficient.  They were very soft and a nice change to plain rolls for burgers.

These were absolutely delicious. Just like the onion rolls from the local bakery that I love. I'll make them again and again!   Oh...as a couple of other reviewers have said, they were pretty dry as made  originally. I ended up added a few extra T of water while they were still in the stand mixer to get the dough to a better consistency. (I don't use bread machines).

Not a bad idea.  I thought the dough had too much onion in it and it overpowered everything.  I want to have the yeasty taste of the bread also.  I would recommend cutting the amount of onion powder and minced onions in half.

Really great rolls!  They did make my entire house smell like onions, but it was worth it!  I increased my yeast to 2 1/2 tsp and put in a full 1/4 cup of minced onion into the bread per the submitter's additional notes.  My husband thought they tasted a bit like a biscuit, which wasn't bad, just an observation.  Very flavorful and great for burgers!

These were the softest, best rolls I've ever tried.  Hands down better than anything you can buy at the grocery store.  I didn't include the onion on top because my son wouldn't like it (he didn't like the onion inside either, so I will be making these again plain).

I have made these rolls many times - both with the milk/water mix and without milk (just water). So easy and they always come out perfect. They're also great with garlic instead of onion, or plain. My husband likes them for sandwiches but my favorite is warmed with butter and honey.

These had a really good flavor but they needed more liquid.  Mine came out dense and I am wondering if it is because the recipe states to knead the dough after removing it from the bread machine, that is when the dough seemed to get tough on me and I had just began to knead it. I will try this recipe again and skip that step.

To say these are easy to make would be an understatement. They are extremely easy. I made these without the onion ingredients and we used them to make pulled pork sandwiches (Sarge's EZ Pulled Pork BBQ from this site). Everyone liked it. The kids also liked to eat the rolls plain. The time to fix/cook these was right on. A definite keeper! Thanks for the recipe!!

I forgot to buy buns before company arrived.  Had Italian beef (from this site) on the weekend menu.  I whipped up these rolls without a bread machine and they were the PERFECT compliment to the beef.  Next time, I'll slice 'em, butter 'em and broil/toast/grill them just before serving.

I couldnt get dried onions, so I used potato flakes with roasted onion. I had half a red onion to use up so I finely chopped it and fried it and sprinkled it on top along with some mature cheddar. These are very large rolls so I think I'll divide it in to 10 next time. Thanks

The first time I made these I only let them rise once, which I didn't realize that at the time. They came out only about 1/2" thick. But I served them thinking that's how they were supposed to be. My husband loved it. I have made them several times now and continue to let them rise once. I also leave out the onion ingredients. They tasted awesome the next day toasted with butter too, like an english muffin. My husband insists they be the sandwich bread & hamburger bun of choice.

I Recommend these. Nice and soft rolls. I don't have a bread machine, so I made them the traditional way. Also, when i let the dough rest, I noticed the melted butter I had forgotten to add in. :-) And they were just fine. I will add it next time, just for the fact that fats help prolong the shelf life of breads. Thanks I will be making these often.

I used King Arthur Flour's White Whole Wheat.  The crumb is very nice and holds butter or seasoned oils well.  They have  a tasty, onion flavor but don't overwhelm sandwich fillings. The rolls don't fall apart with either vegetables or burgers.

Just finished eating one warm out of the oven and wow, these are fantastic! I didn't have potato flakes, so subbed 3 T of corn starch, and I added some shredded sharp white cheddar. The corn starch worked fine -- the rolls are soft and wonderful. I can't taste the cheese at all, so next time I won't bother and will just make as written. Mine rose slower than promised, so I let them sit and they did eventually puff up. Takes some patience, but it's worth it. These will put my leftover meatloaf sandwiches over the edge tomorrow!

My first time to use the machine for other than loaf.  Pretty nice sandwich rolls, though a bit onion-y.  Ours turned out a bit flatter than those pictured here, but easily sliced open for sandwich.

Hi everyone, I just made them by hand. The water/milk qty was not enough to produce a good dough so kept adding to it during kneading. Substituted the onion topping with Zataar for a couple of them and both are delicious. Unfortunately it produced only 4 *big* buns for Texas-size sloppy joes which held all the sauce nicely. Will bake it again!

This rolls were very good. They smell amazing while baking. I didn't have onion powder but the flavor was still great. I followed the recipe except I thought that the quarter cup of dried onions would have been too much for the topping. I was wrong will definetly use it all next time. The family loved them

Instead of water and milk I used water and dry powered  milk that's what is generally used quite often in most bread machine recipes. Didn't use the egg whites and water, just a bit of warm water and pressed the dried onions into the bun. After I pulled them out of the oven I use a stick of butter and ran it across the top of the buns, buttery and soft.

We really enjoyed this brand. I made everything pretty much exactly as it is, except for sprinkling the dried onion on top. When I have dried onion on the top, it tends to be too overpowering for me. Plus my kids prefer the bread plain. will definitely make it again!

Rather than to create hamburger buns I used this recipe to create rolls.   My husband enjoyed the rolls so much he took several to work to share with friends.  His coworkers have asked to place orders for these rolls.

I've made these at least five times now. The second to last batch my husband ate half of them before I woke up the next day. The last batch? Yeah. I got two. He nicked the remaining six for a road trip this morning. I usually leave out the powdered onion and just used minced, wether dry or fresh. We prefer a more subtle onion flavor. Thanks for sharing your recipe with us!

These were good, but I did make a few changes based on what I saw in other reviews. I used all water and no milk, I used oats instead of potato flakes, and I used a heaping 1/4 cup of onions. I also sauteed my onion until it was dark brown instead of using  dry minced onion.

These rolls are great, and for those of you worried about getting a good rise, just mix the yeast, water, milk, and 1/2 cup of the flour in a bowl and let it rest 15 minutes.  This will not only jumpstart the yeast, but magnify the volume of yeast cells, thus making a 2.25 packet perfectly fine for this recipe.  Personally I always use rapid rise yeast, and I always start in this fashion.

I made a few minor changes - used garlic powder instead of onion as I didn't have onion powder in hand. I also added some mixed dried herbs and used real caramelized onions on top.

WOW!  Mine turned out moist and fluffy.  I made hamburger buns and hot dog buns out of this dough.  I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and in my bread machine the mix was "dry" but I just drizzled in water until I got the proper consistency.  I also let it do a double rise, formed my rolls and baked.
I will make these again.....these are way better then ANY store roll I have ever purchased.  
I did not do any topping.....just a personal thing.
THANK YOU so much for posting this.

This was my first time making rolls with my granddaughers help. I used a breadmaker that i got at a yard sale and it worked just fine. The rolls were very good my daughter is still talking about them. I had prepared bbq beef from this site and ate with them the flavor of the onion roll with the beef was awesome.

4 stars as written with the onion-I made them last week for pulled pork sandwiches, but I just made a batch of these with no onion and 1/2 whole wheat flour-I made 15 balls and baked them in a round skillet after brushing with a little olive oil and they are the best dinner rolls I've ever made!

Made with 1 c water, which was too much.  I would knock it down next time, so as not to have to add more flour.  Used 1 T onion powder and 1/2 pan sauteed onion.  Didn't have any potato flakes, so used oats as others did.  Didn't have any problems.  Also used 2.5 t yeast, although next time I will use 1 T, as rolls didn't raise that much.  Made eight rolls slightly smaller than hamburger buns.  Nice dense texture.

Great recipe, I have made this one at least 5 times now, I use it anytime I want a good sandwich roll or hamburger bun. I use fresh onions that I saute in a pan and than add to the mix, I also use 2.5t of yeast. Loved them thanks again!

Our local grocery store used to have good onion rolls, but they changed their recipe lately and they just don't do it for us anymore.   I searched and found this recipe and decided to try it. Okay, I changed a few things. I don't have dried onions, onion powder, or potato flakes, so I used finely minced yellow onion, which I squeezed some juice from (in a strainer over the measuring cup), and then sauteed the onion lightly in butter. I used the onion juice to replace some of the water in the dough. I microwaved a small potato and used about 1/3 cup of it in the dough. I used a KitchenAid mixer instead of a bread machine. I replaced 1 cup of flour with white whole wheat flour.  While baking, the house smelled heavenly, and the rolls are perfect and delicious. They are large, though, so maybe next time I'll make ten. Thank you for posting this recipe!

These were very tasty rolls.  Did have a little problem with the 2nd raise, but that may have been my fault.  Will definately try again.

GOOD RECIPE, but not "wow" Made w/o bread machine...I will probably make again. My husband suggested I add cheese and garlic and serve as dinner rolls. Might just try that. We had with Philly cheese steak...mmmm

These are absolutely amazing! I did add about 1/2 cup of sauteed onions like other viewers suggested, but I also added the 3 Tbsps dried onion to it as well, and increased the onion powder to 1 Tbsp. (We like them oniony.) I didn't put the onions on top. I made them with pulled pork and coleslaw and brought it all on a camping trip with friends. They all loved them so much! Thank you Claudygirl for an easy and wonderful recipe!!!!

Awesome!  Like other reviews, I fried 1/2 medium white onion in about 1 TB of olive oil, let cool and incorporated it with the other ingredients in my bread machine.  We ate these with tuna salad, yum!  Thanks for the recipe, it's better than store bought onion rolls.

This is the best recipe for rolls I have ever made!!  Extremely versatile, I have made, onion rolls, hamburger garlic rolls (using l teas. garlic or more to your liking), plain dinner rolls, and today I made 2 loaves of wheat bread. I replaced 1/2c. flour and used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  Bake 350 for 25 to 30 min.  Next time I bake, I will try 1 cup whole wheat flour. Also, I took another reviewer advice, and I do not use milk, just 1 cup of water.  I just love this recipe!!  Thank you so much for sharing with us.

This was my first time making rolls and they turned out well I think. I didn't have any instant potato flakes but I used quick cooking oats instead based on another review. I also substituted one cup of wholewheat flour for 1 cup AP flour. Also I was running low on Whole Wheat flour so I topped up the cup with some cornmeal. Good recipe. I will use again

These are faaaaabulous! Best rolls I've ever made. The sprinkling of dried minced onion on top makes them look extra gourmet. I've added a bit of garlic powder which is nice with these too. Perfect texture and they rose beautifully. Great recipe!

Absolutely incredible.  Probably the best I have had in a long time.  Made the eight rolls and by the end of the night they were gone I was proud of myself.  Did use the sauted onions as someone suggested.

Great! I have made them as onion rolls and plain rolls. They turn out to be wonderful. Soft, light, and flavorful. The only difference is I let them rise a total of three times.

Good recipe but it does need some tweeking.  Good for a starter and then you have to experiment to get it right.

I've made this recipe several times, excellent every time! To make delicious dinner rolls, omit the onion powder and minced onion, (I skip the hand-kneading step)form the dough into rolls (about 1/3 cup each), cover with damp dish towel, put into oven with a bowl of hot water until double. After cooking, rub tops with butter. YUM!

I love this basic recipe.  I did not make it with the onion though.  The first time I used sweet potato flakes and bread flour.  I made it again a few days later with roasted garlic potato flakes with bread flour.  Each time they came out light and WONDERFUL.  My family loves these.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I made them for pulled pork sandwiches and it made a simple sandwich much more special.  I didn't have dried onion so I sauteed 1/2 a Walla Walla sweet onion and mixed most of that in- reserving about 1/4 cup for the tops of the rolls.  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't have a bread machine.  I did these with an electric mixer and the hook attachment.  Good flavor, but after a day, they got really dense and they weren't any good for sandwiches anymore.  I forgot to put the potato flakes in and I added them after the first rise.  Maybe that's why they were dense the next day.  I will try them again, and maybe use garlic instead of onion.

I was excited to make these, however I wasn't as excited as to how they turned out. The texture wasn't quite what I had hoped for and the flavor seemed kind of artificial.

Very good!!  I left out the dried onions on top of the roll. Was afraid it would be too "onioney".  I liked the flavor just like I made them.

I'm giving this a 4 star because we did not like the onion flavor and dried onion topping and that's coming from a gal who eats onions on everything!  Will make again and omit onion.  The texture  and outcome was very good.  Only alteration was to grind up quick oats instead of potato flakes only because I don't buy the flakes anymore.  Overall good bread

These were very good. My husband absolutely loved them! For as much onion in them, they weren't as strong as I thought... I will make these again.

These are easy to make, tender crust and soft inside. I omitted the onions and potato flakes and added in 3 tbsp of honey. Afterwards, I brushed the tops with melted butter. I don't have a breadmaker and this was my first time baking bread.

Very good! They tasted a little like an onion bagel in bun form. I think next time I'll let them rise a little longer to make sure they're a little fluffier.

I made these rolls the other day. I had a bit of trouble getting the dough to stick together. I had to add about 3 Tbsp more water to the dough, but then they turned out great! I also added real fried onion to the tops with some cheese when I baked them, and I made them with soy milk instead of regular milk. Me and my husband ate them as sandwiche buns and also for chicken burgers. Mmmm Mmmm! The dough also seamed a little stiff when I shaped them, but they still turned out great! So, don't let that scare you off. Give these a try! They are simple and delicious! :)

Mine didn't turn out too well... very dense, but the flavor was delicious.  I am a beginner at making bread, so I'm assuming it was me:) I'll try again.
