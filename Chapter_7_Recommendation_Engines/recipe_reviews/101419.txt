This was wonderful!  From the husband "pork, my least favorite white meat", to "this is awesome, what meat is this?".....  only change I made was to decrease the chili powder to 3/4 tsp as the hubby dislikes spicy foods and based on other readers reviews, this was the perfect mix.  Worked beautifully!!!  Thanks so much for this recipe!!~!

This recipe is EXCELLENT! It is a must try!  I only cooked one tenderloin (vs two)so I only made half the glaze. (I then divided that glaze into two small bowls and used one for brushing onto the meat and the other to set on the table with dinner for dipping or whatever.) I followed the advice of another reviewer here and baked the tenderloin in the oven at 300 degrees for 1 hour 10 minutes, brushed on some glaze, put back in oven for 10 additional minutes, turned tenderloin over and brushed rest of glaze on other side and baked 10 more minutes (total baking time of 1-1/2 hours).  I let it set out for 5 minutes before slicing. It seemed to be the longest 5 minutes of our lives. It smelled that good! We LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this recipe!   My husband thought it was just a tad too spicy for him so next time I will cut back a bit on the chili powder in the rub. However, I thought it was just perfect!  The spicy and sweet flavors complement each other well. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Wow! What an incredible grilled pork recipe! I doubled the spice rub for approximately 3 lbs. of pork and rather leaving the tenderloin whole I cut the pork into medallions. I dipped each piece into the rub and then skewered it making kabobs and left it in the fridge for a few hours. I've found it's much easier to cook that way. It's easier to turn and make sure it's cooked evenly not dried out. I kept the amount of glaze the same, but cut the amount of bbq sauce in it by half. I found that you could easily melt the preserves in the microwave and then add the rest of the ingredients. The sweetness of the glaze definitely compliments the spiciness of the grilled pork! This goes great with grilled sweet potatoes. I will definitely make this again!

Note to cookinkiwi - review the recipe again and first see step 2.  Divide the glaze so that people can use it at table.  Then go to step 4.  With 4 minutes to go, brush the meat with the remaining glaze.  Spray out any flames, though that shouldn't be a problem with tenderloin since it is lean.  The general rule with any sweet sauce (barbecue sauce and others) is to use it briefly near the end of grilling.  That's long enough to warm it and bond it to the surface of the meat, making an attractive and tasty coating.  Sugar is a molecule containing carbon.  Leave it over a grill too long and it burns and turns to black charcoal.  Most folks don't like the taste of cinders.

A five-star recipe for sure.  
Although the recipe doesn't say when to first put the glaze on the meat, I did it right at the start, and because I didn't want to grill outside in the freezing cold, I pan-seared the meat on the stove, placed it in a baking pan, poured sauce over, and baked until internal temp 160f. was reached.
One other thing - I didn't have apricot preserves so in its stead I used orange marmalade (which is tart so I eliminated the lime juice). This was so moist and tasty, bit of a bite, served with oven baked fries and Amish Cole Slaw - a great meal.

Fantastic recipe.  My tenderloins were closer to a pound and a half so i made a little extra rub.  I used a homemade ancho chili powder, which is more flavorful than the store-bought chili powders which have other spices mixed with the chili.  I opted for cooking inside after letting the rub sit on for about 3 hours.  I tied both tenderloins together with butchers twine, seared it on all sides on a grill pan, and put it in a 325F oven until multiple thermometers read 155, then added the glaze.  For the glaze, i cut the bbq sauce in half, used fresh garlic along with the fresh ginger, and extra hot sauce (cholula).  The cilantro was a nice addition.  Kudos to the author of the recipe!

This was delicious.  The only thing that I would do differently (and I will make this again) would be to reduce the amount of barbecue sauce in order to let the apricot flavor come through a little bit stronger.  I would also reduce the amount of glaze by half.  I used it to glaze while grilling and also as a sauce for dipping and I still had to much.  This was excellent and it would be great for company.

This was so visually pretty coming off the grill I could only hope it would taste good too.  Well this deserves a definite ride on the "hot tamale train" for sure.  OMG the perfect mix of spicy and sweet.  I did add just a small amt. of chipotle chili powder also and I thought the heat level was spot on.  The leftover glaze was so good for dipping.  I love the lime in this and next time just might put some more in but I had a small lime.  There were lots of smiles all around while eating this.  Served it with Parmesan crusted asparagus from AR  and Shitake Mushroom Brown Rice from Food Network.  It was good too.  A 5-star recipe and a 5-star meal.  Thanks Pork Board!!

This recipe was great.  I vary my meats throughout the week and I usually cringe when it comes to pork because nothing ever seems to flavor it very well.  This recipe has made me fall in love with pork.  Just the rub alone is awesome, but the apricot glaze really adds the extra flavor.  Bravo. I cut down on the chili powder to get my 5 year old to eat it.  I wouldn't change anything else though.

I just made this for dinner and my husband loved it.  It was fast (minus refrigeration time for the rub), easy and delicious.  I followed the directions for the rub exactly, but only refrigerated for 1 1/2 hrs. and it was still very flavorful and extremely tender.  For the glaze I used reduced sugar apricot preserves since that was what I had on hand.  I used just over 1 cup of preserves and probably 1/3 cup of barbecue sauce.  I didn't have any hot sauce but it still had a little kick.  I also added a tablespoon or so of brown sugar. The remaining ingredients I stuck to the recommended amount.  We still had leftover glaze, so next time I may follow other reviewers suggestions to cut it in half & keep the proportions the same as the original recipe, but it was still very good.  We'll definitely be making this again.

This is delicious.  My family devours it everytime I make it.  This is how I prepare it in the oven: Preheat to 425.  Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray with cooking spray.  Bake the seasoned pork for 10 minutes.  During that 10 minutes, prepare the glaze.  Brush the pork with half of the glaze that is to be used for cooking (not the service glaze).  The pork needs to be cooked for 12-14 more minutes.  Halfway through that time brush the pork with the remaining cooking glaze.

Excellent.  I doubled the meat and all other ingredients except the chili powder, keeping at 1 tbsp.  Cooked in oven at 300 F for 1 hour, then glazed the tops.  Back in oven at 325 for 10 minutes, flipped them, and then another 10 for that side.  Rested them for 5 minutes before carving.  The meat was so tender, and the glaze is amazing.  Thanks for a recipe I will make again and again!

Delicious!  I ended up using twice the amount of rub, since the recipe amount didn't cover the two tenderloins very well.  I shook the rub in a large ziploc bag, added the meat and shook it up some more to coat the meat, then left it in the bag to marinate overnight in the fridge.  Since I'd doubled the rub, I left out the hot sauce in the glaze, and the heat level was just right for us.  The sweetness of the glaze complemented the spiciness of the pork just perfectly!  And we thought the amount of glaze was just right.

I made this for our Christmas dinner a year ago, and it was such a huge hit that I am returning to it again this year. First, though, I have to say that I really don't understand why people modify a recipe, and then give it a poor rating because their modifications didn't work out. I followed the recipe pretty closely with one exception: I don't eat sugar, so I substituted granular Splenda in the rub (DO NOT use Equal/Nutrasweet--it breaks down when exposed to high temps), and I used sugar free apricot preserves. This worked very well for those looking to cut back on sugar (there's not a lot of sugar in the recipe anyway). I do have a few suggestions. The recipe is best if you can leave the rub on for as long as possible before cooking. I took the meat out of the fridge for about 30 minutes before I started to cook it. I also baked mine in the oven--it's a bit cold for grilling outside at this time of the year. However, before putting it in the oven, I seared the tenderloin on all sides in hot pan with a little oil. Finally, I put it in the oven at 375 (covered) for 20-40 minutes, until temp was 135-140. I removed the pork from the oven, and turned it up to 475. While waiting for the oven to come to temp, I glazed the pork. Then back to the oven for about 10 minutes until the temp reached 145. Do not go any higher. In 2011 the USDA changed the recommended temp from 160 to 145. For good reason--145 kills bacteria, but it doesn't turn the meat into shoe leather. Hope this helps

This was so good I shared it on my Facebook page!  The longer you let the rub sit on the meat, the better your tenderloin will turn out.  The glaze is outstanding!  I would recommend making the glaze a few hours ahead to allow the oils from the cilantro and ginger to properly incorporate.  The only change was to the sugar.  You should always use brown sugar in dry rubs for meat.

Liked the rub, not so much the glaze. May have been my mistake.  I used polaner's all fruit apricot spread. One jar is exactly a cup so I had to decrease the rest of the ingredients in the glaze. I also used sweet baby's ray's bbq sauce and I don't think it went well with the polaner all friut. I tried dipping it into the raspberry chipotle sauce from costco and that taste was much better. I will try again, just change the glaze ingredients.

This was fantastic!! I only put a dash of chili powder in the rub and a dash of tobasco in the sauce. I let my roast marinate 24 hours. I baked it in my oven at 300 for 1 1/2 hours. I basted it when there was 20 minutes left and flipped it over and basted the other side. There was LOTS of sauce but I loved it. I made spanish rice but next time I think I will make brown rice because it will be so good with the sauce! The whole family loved it- even the kids!

Really enjoyed this, the sauce was yummy! I didn't trim my tenderloins completely because they tend to dry out easier being that they are so lean and they came off the grill perfect!

This was the best pork tenderloin recipe I've ever tried, and I have made TONS.  The sauce was amazing, and went perfectly with the rub on the pork.  After reading another review, I was worried that the rub would be too spicy - it was not at all, even without the sauce!  Instead of grilling, I made the pork in the oven (uncovered, in a roasting pan):  15 minutes at 475, then 30 minutes at 375.  Be sure and let the pork rest about 10 minutes before slicing, as that is what makes the juices evenly distribute and not dry the pork out.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Excellent and easy.  Like the sweet and spicy flavors together.  I was out of apricot preserves so used some applesauce with happy results.

I made exactly as written. Loved it!  So did the rest of the family. Husband was especially quiet during dinner! Oh, I didn't grill but baked it as suggested by one reviewer.  Tender and juicy.

I made this for dinner a few nights ago - it was quite easy and absolutely delicious!  Our grill is put away for the winter so I pan fried it to brown the exterior of the pork and baked it for about 20 minutes at 350 F.  YUM!

This is a very good recipe.  I'd like to say it's a 4 1/2 star recipe just because it's very sweet and I think it'd be better without the sugar in the rub. I used the exact recipe and let the meat sit in the fridge for about 6 hours and then another hour on the counter, coming to room temp (it was freezing here).  This turned out very moist and every one enjoyed it.  Will make again, but without the sugar. Thanks :)

This was very good.  I followed the recipe with no changes.  It was devoured by my family.  Not too spicy so if you like it hot add something to it.  We grilled it and it was moist and just plain wonderful.

I made this as part of a meal for 20-25 people.  It was an absolute hit, and pretty easy to pull off.  The glaze is very flavorful, and teople kept raving to me about how great it was!  I highly recommend it.

It was tasty.  Would have liked more chile taste.  The sweetness from the apricots overpoured the chile powder a bit but we had no complaints at all from my family.

OMG, this was amazing! I did cut down on the chili powder and I also used fresh garlic isntead of garlic powder. The only BBQ sauce we use in our house now is the Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce recipe on this site, so that's what I used to make the glaze. Great recipe for pork tenderloin.

Perfect Pork! After years of my mother and my husband's mother mutilating pork, we decided to make this recipe and give pork another chance... FANTASTIC! This recipe is a staple in our household now.

I have to say, after I rubbed the spices on the pork, I was pretty sure I had made a mistake (too much spice) No, everything was perfect. My ever doubting bf thought this was very good and he's a buthcher! We followed others advise a baked in the oven  ( I'm absolutely positive the grilling method will be divine ) but right know its to cold and snowy. Made one change and used orange marmalade instead of apricot bacause I didnt have any. My son is the KING of sauces and this one will be a staple in our fridge. I'll bet its fantastic for dipping chicken fingers etc.  The leftovers made kickin sandwiches the next day...ssoooo much flavour.

Oh my is this great! Served it to company tonight and they all raved about it. A definite keeper ... easy enough for everyday and special enough for company. I did bake it in the over as other reviewers suggested ... turned out great and nobody had to be outside in the cold! As a side note ... I made some baked chicken wings; we dipped the wings in some of the sauce when we ate them ... yummy!!! Next time I will use the glaze for the wings as well.

So yummy! I doubled the rub and baked it in the oven (too cold outside for me to want to grill) and the flavors were wonderful! Had too much glaze left over, but that's OK... I see myself making this again in the very near future! Maybe on a nicer day so I can grill it!!

This was great. Enjoyed the first night over rice with salad on the side.  The second night we used for panini's.  Used the sauce and a little grated monterey jack cheese.  If there isn't enough sauce left, try with a little jalepeno jelly.

This was delicious!  We loved it and will make it regularly.  The glaze was perfect and charred nicely on the grill.  We served with "creamy potatoes au gratin" and asparagus sauteed in butter and garlic and a fresh fruit salad.  YUM!

Awesome dish, big hit at the firehouse. Use brown sugar instead of regular sugar, gives it a real nice color and sets off the chili perfectly.

This was good, but the cilantro was completely out of place in this recipe.  It really overpowered the flavor of the sauce.  Everything else was delicious.  I doubled the sauce, because we like to use it for dipping, and it was way more than enough.  I think a single batch would have been fine.  Next time I'll just make a single batch of the sauce, leave out the cilantro and it will be perfect for my families taste-buds!  On a side note: 1 1/2 cups of apricot preserves = an 18oz jar.

FABULOUS!!!  This was absolutely delicious.  I used boneless pork chops and let them "marinate" with the spice rub for 24 hours.  Then I baked them at 350 degrees for 40 minutes, adding the apricot glaze after about 30 minutes.  I saved some of the glaze to spoon on the chops when they came out of the oven.  Not too spicy, not too sweet.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Very good recipe. I only have time to marinate the pork for an hour. I used a barbecue sauce called Soy Vay which was flavorful as it contained ginger, garlic and onion. However, it was quite watery and contained a bit too much soy sauce for this dish. So I boiled the glaze over the stove until it became thicker and added 1.5 tbsp of honey. Next time will use less Soy Vay or change to another barbecue sauce. I baked the pork at 350 for 40 min, poured the sauce over and baked for another 20 min. I waited 10 min before cutting it. The pork was very tender and moist. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This recipe was delicious! We followed it pretty much exactly (peach instead of apricot preserves) and found it to have the right amount of kick and tang at the same time. I would definitely make it again.

This was absoutely mouth watering delicious! The combination of spicy ( the chili powder ) and sweet ( the apricot glaze) blends so nicely on the palate.  If you are cooking for a crowd that does not like spicy food, I would tone back the chili powder.  I, however, think it's perfect the way it is! Did not have a grill ( live in a condo ), so I seared it in a very hot pan for 2 mins, then cooked in the oven at 320 for  40 mins, then added glaze and cooked another 10.  Went really nicely with a almond rice pilaf and brussel sprouts. This apricot glazed pork is an entertainment worthy main course. Melts in the mouth! FYI: I kept the pork loin in the fridge for about 5 hours, soaking in that amazing dry rub.

An impressively delicious recipe my bf and I really enjoyed! I loved the flavors in the spice rub--very flavorful and just the right amount of spice. I also loved the glaze, as I had everything on hand. My modifications included using pork chops, cooking on the stove, and omitting cilantro (my bf is among those who think it tastes like soap). --Sometimes I slack off with sides, but decided to make black beans alla olla, which has been in my recipe box for quite some times. Paired quite nicely with this and basmati rice.

This was very good. I loved the spice rub on the pork (which I adjusted for serving size). 
WORD OF WARNING - I oven-roasted one large, almost 4-pound  tenderloin (which is what I had on hand), and the glaze plus the barbecue sauce kind of overpowered the rub. So, if you're using a larger tenderloin I would recommend adding an extra portion of the rub to the glaze to enhance the flavor and heat. This was definitely a delicious recipe and I wish I had had the right size of tenderloins because i think it would have been perfect.

This was excellent, so very tender and just the right hint of spice and sweet.  I did not use ginger, only because I had none on hand and it was superb.....will make again with the ginger.

Excellent. Had leftover sauce. Company will be impressed- such an easy low prep dish. Served with rice and grilled asparagus for a perfect meal.

This was delicious!  I didn't have apricot jam so I used some homemade lemon marmalade (1/2 cup or so) and it was still great!  I also grilled my meat low and slow, definitely one of the best pieces of meat I've ever grilled.

Excellent!  We loved it!  I used a pork loin, as that's what was in the freezer.  Very moist and delish!  The sauce was a fantastic addition.

We served it with Killer Cole Slaw, roasted Yukon Gold Potatoes, and fresh Green Beans with Red Peppers, bacon and slivered almonds.

wow, this was amazing! what a unique combination of ingredients.  this is definitely the spring/summer version of the Quick Savory Cranberry Glazed Pork Loin Roast found on this site.  in fact, i don't work a grill, nor did i marinate the meat, so i prepped and cooked it according to the "Quick Savory Cranberry Glazed Pork Loin Roast" directions. it was amazing!

I agree with everyone else's rating!  A WINNER!  So easy.  I had the sauce made in advance, cooked it on the barbecue.  Timing was perfect.  If you are a beginner, it is so simple and very impressive dinner!  I served it with cole slaw, asparagus, and mashed potatoes.  Company was impressed!

I used pork tenderloin chop which as already cut in about 1.5" thickness. I browned then on a frying pan first and put them into an oven to finish baking.  My husband LOVED it and couldn't even stop how good they were!

YUM! I baked mine in the oven and it took more than one hour like previous comments state. I baked it at 300 for an hour and a half, then another 45 minutes at 350. Maybe my tenderloin was thicker than most, but it still took a long time. It turned out WONDERFUL though! I waited till an hour into cooking before I basted it with the glaze. Then I basted it until it was finished. Yummm...

Phenomenal.  I used this recipe for a backstrap of a wild boar.  Served with brown basmati rice and lightly steamed broccoli, it was a hit.  A fantastic union of spicyiness and sweetness.

This was good. The glaze actually went better on a more savory, spicy rub for chicken.

My husband absolutely loved this!  I made a couple of changes, I left out the sugar for the rub as others had suggested.  And I used sugar free red raspberry preserves since I had it in the cupboard.  I used an electronic thermometer and pulled it out when it reached 160.  I also added cayenne as I really like a kick!  It was so tender, hubby used leftovers for a sandwich the next day with swiss cheese.  Awesome and I am not a glaze person!

I never review (though I should more often) but I have to recommend this to anyone who is considering it.  Made it exactly as indicated, though had to slice the tenderloin and grill the pieces to get it to cook through (it was a large tenderloin).  Excellent taste, easy to prepare, HUGE hit with "kids" ages 9 - 43 (all of whom are VERY picky eaters, 43 year old included!!).  They asked when we can have it again!  Served with basic mashed potatoes and corn on the cob.

I made this dish for 22 people using 6 pork tenderloins.  At the last minute I realized I had forgotten to buy the apricot preserves, so I omitted the grated ginger and used a mango ginger chutney (Trader Joes) I had on hand.  It came out fabulous and I think I would use the mango ginger chutney again next time.  Fabulous recipe.

Rave reviews even from my kids!  Sweet, spicy (but not too hot) and savory.  I took the recommendation of others and seered the meat in my cast iron skillet, covered it in foil and baked at 300 until the internal temp was 160. (appx 1hr)  I served it with the onion rice recipe from this site and added cilantro to the rice recipe.

Very Yummy!  I altered the recipe a little.  I watered down the glaze with a 1/2 bottle of beer.  I made the glaze fairly watery so I could baste the pork through out cooking.  I slow cooked it on a gas grille with temp at 280.  At the end I turned up the heat and browned it.  Wow, it was amazing.  I also put extra ginger than the recipe called for cuz I am a ginger lover.  Highly recommend this recipe, it's so tasty.

Wow. We adore this meal. The sauce was easy to make and the meat grilled beautifully. For others who may not have purchased pork tenderloin before (as I had not), fyi: a 2 pound pkg contains two 1 lb pork tenderloins. I was worried about adjusting the directions for grilling a two pound tenderloin and was pleasantly surprised to open the package and find two inside. Served with a melon/blueberry salad and sliced grilled potatoes. Yum!!!! Will use for company.

Very good indeed! The only thing I altered was to add one tsp. of hot sauce rather than just the half it called for. We like spicy food, so it seemed like the right thing to do. Although the glaze was good, we really didn't find it to be very spicy at all. (Even with doubling up on the hot sauce). I think the apricot preserves were just so sweet that it sort of overpowered the spicyness. Still excellent and extremely flavorful, but if you were hesitant about the level of heat in this dish, don't be. Also, we had lots of glaze left over, (probably about half of it), so I think I'll try it on something else next. I bet it'll be wonderful on some grilled shrimp skewers! Okay, now I have tomorrow's dinner planned! Thanks for posting this one... we loved it!

Awesome!  Don't change a thing.  We decided it was better than the Pork Tenderloin specialty at a local upscale restaurant...a definite keeper!

Marinated for 8 hours. I was unable to grill, so put in 425 oven for 15 minutes, then decreased the temp to 350, covered, and continued until it reached the internal temperature of 140. Oh, also basted every 10 minutes. When I served it to my husband... without prompting, he laughed, and said, "Oh, YEAH" and gave me 2 thumbs up. Astounding. So cheers all around. Thank you for the recipe!

This was pretty good, my BF especially liked it.  I let mine sit with the rub overnight in the frig.  Followed others suggestions for preparing in the oven:  475 for 15 mins uncovered, then 375 covered for about 30-40 mins until the internal temp reached 140.  Then applied the glaze a few times and kicked the oven temp up to caramelize it.  This method worked really well.  Rested 10 mins before slicing.  I did reduce the chili powder a little since BF doesn't like it too spicy, and it was fine.  I love recipes with fresh lime, yum!

Thoroughly enjoyed this!  Instead of grilling I cooked in the crockpot on low for 6 hours.  Made it for company, cooked two loins so I had left overs to nosh on during the week.

Followed recipe exactly and it is EXCELLENT!  Very flavorful, has a little "kick" to it, which my husband and I both like.  Even my very picky children ate it!  This is definitely special enough for company too!
Thanks for this recipe...will definitely make again and again.  May even try it with chicken breasts...

Best pork tenderloin we've had. Good flavor and easy to make. Used peach preserves instead.

Made this using a 2-pack pork tenderloin from Costco.there'd ancho chili-powder rather than regular, and cut the amount by half as I was making it for the whole family. The rub was just enough to cover both loins and I baked it in the oven for 50 min at 300 degrees. I spread the glaze on 5 min before it came out of the oven and used the rest as a dipping sauce for those who wanted it. The kids gobbled it up and there were no leftovers! 5 Stars all the way!

I made pork tenderloin with three different sauces/seasonings for christmas.  This was the favorite sauce.    Only suggestion I have is, watch out with what chili powder you use.  Some people say this rub is too hot.  My guess they used their 'red hot alarm' chili powder.

LOVED THIS! Only thing I did different was (instead of grilling) I seared the spice-rubbed meat til brown on all sides then finished (topped with glaze) in a 400 degree oven to 155 internal temp. Perfection! Had a little leftover glaze that I used on a simple meatloaf later the same week...Awesome as well.

This recipe was great! But I made a few changes. I'm not a big fan of cooking with apricots so I switched to honey and when I heated it, I added in a teaspoon of rubbed sage. In the spice rub I doubled the amount of chili powder and also used 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. I already had a sliced pork tenderloin so I cooked them in a skillet and poured the glaze over it while cooking. While the glaze and pork were in the pan, I added 3 dried red chilis to give it a little kick. I served it with mashed potatoes. My husband loves it! I make this recipe once a week!

Love this recipe!  The sauce is outstanding!  Thank you for sharing.  I made everything as stated, but I had to broil the meat as I'm having grilling issues right now (and I used a garlic clove minced - don't like the powder).  Can't wait to make it again but on the grill next time!!  For anyone planning to make this you can broil it. I do it for 5 mins at a time and turn the meat at each 5 min interval.  It took right about 15 mins for the tenderloin I was cooking and during the last 5 mins I brushed on the sauce.  Be sure to have an instant read thermometer handy so you don't overcook it as each one will be different depending on thickness.  Take the pork out when it reaches 150 and let sit for about 5 mins. Any longer it will overcook and be dry and tough.

Oh my GOODness this stuff is awesome!!!! I made it last night and we absolutely loved it!!! The dry rub would be amazing on a steak, and the glaze isn't too sweet. I, like others, used orange preserves because I had them from a different recipe and aren't going to use them otherwise, and it was delish. Also was a little more generous with the garlic and hot sauce, and used half the BBQ sauce, which was spicy because that's what we had on hand. SO good. We will definitely make this again. Goes great with some sauteed sugar snap peas and mushrooms. Thanks for this new family favorite!!!

Fantastic! I was a little worried because I've never grilled before, but it was really easy and took almost exactly 20 minutes to cook. I wish I could have marinated mine longer, but it still had great flavor. It was really mindless cooking too!

This was very good! I didn't have garlic powder so used minced garlic, that worked well as the rub became wet and 'finger painting' it onto the meat meant it stuck really well.  I used a foreman grill and it took quite a bit longer to cook than the recipe listed but I think my tenderloins were closer to 1 1/2 pounds.

Outstanding!  Contrast of spicy/sweet/tangy was delicious.  Rub & sauce would be great on chicken as well.  My picky boyfriend said "yum" as soon as he took a bite - I was surprised!

Um. Wow! So tender. So full of flavor. So tasty. So...GONE. This was so good I hardly have words to describe it. Do not pass this one by. This is perfect for company, but quick enough to make on a weeknight. Just pull the rubbed pork out of the frige and throw it on the grill while you whip up some potatoes and a veggie. It really is done in 20 minutes and so tender and tasty... I know, I already covered that. Don't miss out on this recipe.

I made this for dinner tonight and got RAVE reviews from my two finicky teens.  My husband said I should make this every week!  I folowed the recipe exactly except I baked it at 425 for an hour and basted w/the sauce repeatedly.  This would be awesome w/chicken or salmon as well.   A real winner!!!!!

This is the best pork loin I've ever had. It tasted like it came from a restaraunt. I served the sauce on the side. I served baked sweet potatoes and side salads with this and it went well.

My husband and I love pork tenderloin, but this is by far the best recipe! Don't let the preserves fool you, if u don't like them, you will love this! I make my own rub and always have the sauce on the side, almost every time I make it someone leaves with the recipe!

No doubt about it this is definitely a 5 star recipe. Everything about it the way it was written is absolutely perfect including cook time which was right on. The most flavorful and tender pork loin I have ever had in my life! Must try recipe as written cooked on the grill.

This pork had an amazing combination of flavors!  It was very cold outside so I seared it on all sides and baked it at 350 for about 30 min.  It came out very juicy and flavorful.  I served it with candied carrots from this site and egg noodles.  Will make again!

OUTSTANDING! We just finished this meal, and I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow!!! I didn't have pork tenderloins, so I used four thick, boneless pork chops instead. I marinated the pork chops in the spice rub for around 20 hours, and my only change here was to use 2 cloves of garlic instead of the powder.  I only made half the glaze, since I only prepared half the meat. I didn't have any hot sauce, so I used 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper.   Be sure to grill these, as it adds tons of flavor and they come off the grill looking as if you ordered them from a restaurant. This is company worthy!

This was very good.  Followed other suggestions and baked at 300 for 70 minutes then basted on each side for 10 minutes longer each.  Served with rice and was excellent.  I will do this in the crockpot next time (cook for 6 hours on low in 1/2 inch of water with quartered onions then drain and add glaze for 45 minutes longer).  Thanks for sharing!

Amazing!  The pork was a bit done for my taste with the given time, but juicy none the less!  A keeper!

I used boneless center cut pork chops and seasoned them as directed minus the sugar.  I seared them in my cast iron skilliet, and made the apricot glaze to dip the meat in.  OMG!  THIS DISH WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD!  Next time I will use a pork tenderloin for the "real" experience.

This is a very good and easy pork recipe with a sweet sauce.  I made the sauce the prior day and doubled the spice rub to have on hand for the next meal.  Only comment that I would make is that I think the servings should be six (instead of eight), but maybe we're just gluttons!

Exellent recipe ! Marinated the loin over night and baked in the oven, as another review suggested. Used dried ginger and omitted the cilantro, as I was out on these. Will be a regular, if pork loin is affordable ! Thank-you for a great combo of seasonings and flavor !!

OMG!  This is EXCELLENT!!  I made this making only two little changes.  I used peach preserves instead of apricot and I didn’t have fresh cilantro, so I threw in a little dried.  I made extra glaze to drizzle over the pork when plating and it was delicious!  We’ll be making this one again for sure!  We also thought the glaze would be very good on grilled chicken as well.  We’ll be trying that out soon.

Absolutely fantastic!  Yes, it's a bit of work, but the results make it totally worth it.  This recipe has never failed to impress.  Everyone loves it!  I have mixed up and keep a jar of the chili rub and use it on pork and chicken for grilling.  So good!

On a whim, I looked for a pork tenderloin recipe and after searching a couple recipe web sites I came across this recipe.  It is absolutely wonderful.  5-star.  If anyone rated this below the 5 star rating I'm not sure why.  I prepared the meal exactly the way it's suggested in the recipe.  (Next time I'll double the sauce).  The flavor was unexpected it was so good and I can't wait to make this meal again.  A suggestion:  with the meal serve steamed green beans and grilled potatoes with red onion.

Terrific!  I tested this last night.  Only marinated it for 1 hour, and forgot to add the cilantro (husband doesn't like it anyway).  Seared it on the stovetop and finished it on the grill.  Served it with sweet restaurant slaw from this site.  Awesome!

Really really good! I had to make some changes due to the fact I didn't have a few things.   I made the rub as instructed but used it for only one pork sirloin (It's what I had.)  As for the glaze I didn't add the ginger or cilantro. And only had a lemon so I used that instead of a lime. And it came out just amazing. I rubbed the rub all over the pork. And I didn't have much time so I let it sit out for about 30 minutes. From there I baked it at 350 for about an hour, I also didn't have a roasting pan so I took one of my cooling racks and placed it on top of a pan. After that I took it out and put it down in a new pan (after changing out the foil) and poured the glaze over it.   I served it with red mashed potatoes and corn. It went very well together.

Five-star delicious.  I had two 1-pound tenderloins that I roasted in the oven at 425 degrees for 30 minutes.  I sauced the tenderloins after 25 minutes, then cooked for the remaining five minutes.  It was too cold outside to grill.  I didn't add the lime or cilantro because I didn't have any.  The pork was perfectly cooked, moist, and tender.  A definite keeper.

I rarely write reviews but this one was worth it. I served it for Christmas Day dinner and everyone raved on it. They were initially disappointed it wasn't ham but after tasting it...no more ham on Christmas Day. I also cut back on the sugar but kept everything else the same. Thanks!

I followed the advice of another reviewer here and baked the tenderloin in the oven at 300 degrees for 1 hour 10 minutes, brushed on some glaze, put back in oven for 10 additional minutes, turned tenderloin over and brushed rest of glaze on other side and baked l0 more minutes (total baking time of 1-1/2 hours). I also cut the chili powder down to 1 teaspoon and omitted the cilantro completely since I do not care for it.  My house smelled so good while this was cooking.  Delicious.

This is a great recipe.  The only change made was to use orange marmalade.  I made this a while ago and forgot to rate it, but was looking for something to make for dinner and had to find this again.  The rub and glaze are just perfect.  Only marniated for a few hours and baked it in the oven.  I put half the glaze on the pork while it is cooking and save half for dipping.

I first made this last year for a special birthday dinner.  I don't care for apricots much so I used peach preserves and it was wonderful!  Everyone at the table loved it and I told them that the recipe really called for apricot preserves but I used the peach.  My son said he would like to try it with the apricot so the next time I made it, I used the apricot...WOW!  If the peach was wonderful, the apricot was AMAZING!  The rub drives me crazy...it smells so good every time I open the fridge and the glaze is pure perfection of sweet and spicy!  The only real change I have made is that I increase the cilantro by quite a bit as I have found I LOVE it!  If you are looking for a great meal, special or not, you HAVE to try this, you will NOT be disappointed!

We made this exactly as listed and were very happy with the results.  4 kids at home who are known to be fussy on occasion and they ate this down to the last bite.  They were even picking the little pieces off the serving plate.  Its a "make again" in our house, and I am making it again as I type this :)

I have made this at least half a dozen times. For the most part I've followed the exact recipe, the only differences I've made are: cooking... I cook it at 425, 10 first side, glaze 8 mine second side, glaze, stuff it in for a couple of minutes for the glaze to get nice and bubbly and done. Yes, the glaze does make a LOT! I half it then I reserve the rest for dipping... Here is where I see a lot of reviewers differ.... the glaze itse3lf. You HAVE to use good 1. BBQ Sauce (I use sweet baby rays) 2. an apricot jam/jelly/preserves that isn't overly sweet (I use an all natural one)3. don't be afraid of the hot sauce (I use franks red hot and I have a Yankee husband and a 4 year old that both LOVE this)... what I don't use... Cilantro... not because of me, because it's a love/hate herb, I love it, husband HATES it, so I leave out both that and the lime.

This is UNBELIEVABLY good!! I'm a beginner cook and made this for a party of ten and it was perfect. I made it as is, and I wouldn't change anything except make less sauce (have a WHOLE lot of extra). It is definitely worth five starts.

I never was a huge fan of pork until tonight after truly enjoying this recipe!!  I made it exactly as written and it was awesome.  The only thing I did differently was the cooking method.  I followed another reviewer and cooked it at 475 for 15 mins uncovered, then 375 for 30 mins covered.  I only marinated it for about 2 hrs and the flavor was perfect.   Even my 4 year old daughter told me I made a really good dinner!!  Its def a keeper in this house.

This was extremely good and adding it to my list of nice things to grill for company this summer. I used a home rub just slightly different because my husband can not have powdered garlic. The glaze is wonderful! I used the leftover pork, glaze and BBQ sauce to make pulled pork sandwiches. Grill once, eat twice!! Thank you!

I give this a 4.5. It was very good but Max heat for our palates that like our stuff medium spicy but not very spicy. It is sitting on the edge of the spice overpowering any of the other flavors. It probably did not help that the bbq sauce I used was pretty spicy too. All in all I would make again but cut back on the hot sauce so more of the apricot flavor came through. The sauce: made double what was needed to glaze the pork.

My  new favorite Pork Tenderloin recipe.  Glaze makes double what you need but it is truly excellent.  It is not too spicy, do not change the proportions.

Made it as written, very good.  Next time might try Thai Chili Paste instead of hot sauce.  All three kids (7 yrs, 3 yrs and 1  yr) all liked the rub.  Only the 1 yr old liked the glaze.

Amazing baked and broiled instead of grilled. The flavor on this was delicious!! Even my daughter ate it and shes super picky. I rubbed the spice on and seared it in a pan, then brushed the glaze on and baked it. When it was about 5 minutes from done, i put some more glaze on and put it under the broiler for about 6 minutes so the edges of glaze crisped up a bit. It was delicious! This will become a regular in my house.

Absolutely Delicious! I didn't have any ginger or apricot spread at the house so I left them out and used the rest of the ingredients for the glaze, it was still fantastic. I also baked the tenderloin in the oven at 350 for 40 mins. I will definitely make this again!

Delicious!  The only thing I changed was peach preserves for the apricot.  I accidentally grabbed the wrong one but it came out awesome.  I also grilled it and then finished it off in the oven because I had a thick tenderloin.

Fantastic pork recipe! I baked mine in the oven instead of grilling it and it turned out great. I had two one pound tenderloins and baked them at 350 degrees for about 50 minutes or so. I took mine out when it reached 150 degrees in the center and it was perfect. Very moist and juicy, but cooked all the way through. My husband is already asking for it again.

Huge hit with family and guests - small children and adults alike!  I baked at 350 until meat thermometer hit 155, then took out and let rest and internal temp rise.  So juicy!  Served with white basmati rice, steamed green beans, and sweet potato ginger soup.  Yum!

I have learned to cook pretty well over the years but have NEVER gotten such rave reviews from a guest....a well-travelled and gourmet-dined guest....than when i made this pork dish.  My husband and kids love it as well...and its super easy.  I didnt have apricot jam so the first time i substituted orange ginger marmelade and the second time a raspberry jam mixed with an apple chutney.  All were fabulous...think it needs the ginger and garlic along with something jammy...and it rocks!

my husband's favorite meal!  He says he could picture being served this at a 5-star restaurant.  The combination of flavors and the ginger are wonderful.  I make the recipe as written.  Every time someone new eats it they ask for the recipe.  I try to marinate the pork the night before but have also put the rub on about 1-2 hrs before cooking and it is still delicious!

My family LOVED this recipe!  I did prepare it slightly different than described.  I applied the rub to the whole tenderloins, but sliced them into medallions just before cooking.  I also applied the glaze at the beginning of cooking.  I grilled them on the George Foreman grill.  Served with the extra glaze.  The meat was so tender and flavorful!  Perfect!

Excellent, easy and comes out perfect every time!! Made it twice for dinner parties and everyone wanted the recipe. Ive also made it with a peach glaze as well (made from fresh peaches and some sugar instead of jarred preserves - fabulous).

Used bone-in pork chops (1" thick). As written, very good four-stars...for me, adding some heat to the recipe would make it a five-star (habanero dust in the rub and/or chopped habanero in the glaze).

Absolutely wonderful! I used 1/4 cup barbecue sauce as someone else suggested. Grilled it for about 30 mins. The flavors were delicious and this is totally company worthy.

I was worried we wouldn't like this, but it turned out great was enjoyed by all! I used a small pork loin roast (trimmed excess fat) instead of the tenderloin. I used much less chili powder than called for, even in the halved amount, as the kind I have is very spicy. I only made 1/4 of the glaze. Used fresh ginger and garlic, maple BBQ sauce and skipped the cilantro. I cooked it at 350F or 375F for roughly an hour, give or take until the roast reached 160F (internal temperature). I would line my pan with foil next time as it take some scrubbing to get whatever burnt on (soaked it for two days!). Very tasty.

WOW - I used a chipotle BBQ sauce so it was spicey but I love spicey so it was fantastic. The pork marinated in the spices for about 8 hours. So tender and delicious. I grilled it for 5 minutes on one side then about 8 on the other but these were over a pound each. Then a basted and grilled for a while longer. Removed and let rest for 30 minutes covered with foil.

Can't wait to make this for my son and daughter-in-law. Definately will save and make again.

Delicious!  I used chipolte chili powder, and cut back a little so it wouldn't be too spicy.  We loved it.  Also, used Polaner AllFruit Apricot & Sweet Baby Rays for the sauce.  I did not add the lime juice & ran out of garlic powder after making the rub, so did not have those in the glaze, but it was still very good.

Just made this for the first time this evening, and it was very good.  I would definitely make it again.  Due to rain, I cooked it in the oven at 300 as suggested by another reviewer, but would give it a try on the grill next time.  

The spice rub was incredible and gave the pork a wonderful flavor.  I dialed back the chili powder to 1 tsp which was just right for my 5-year-old.  However I thought the glaze was way too sweet and I don't think I would bother with it next time.  Between the preserves and the BBQ sauce, there is a LOT of sugar in that glaze.  The rub gives the pork plenty of flavor, nothing more is necessary.

This was awesome!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe - baked in the oven at 300 degrees as others suggested - only took about 1 hr.

Okay, I make it a little differently just for ease of cooking, but it comes out great! I use pre-cut pork chops, trim the fat off, put them on a baking sheet, and rub the spices over them. I bake at 400 for about 14-15 minutes. Then I pour the glaze over each and serve. Yum.

Really liked the Chili Rub but didnt care for the apricot glaze, it was more sweet than I care for. Did everything by the recipe except for cilantro.

This was a great dish!  I loved the glaze for it.  It pairs very well with the pork.  I baked mine in the oven at 350 for about 50 min.  I had just one tenderloin about 1.5 lbs.  I cant wait to grill this next time to get the nice charcoal and caramelization on it from the glaze.  Thanks for the recipe!  UPDATE:  I have made this several times now and it is one of our favorites.  I have used apricot and orange marmalade and they both are delicious for the glaze.  Next time Im going to try raspberry preserves.  I bet it will be divine!  My prefered method is on the grill.  Its also great rotisseried.  I normally simmer down the remaining glaze til it gets nice and thick and serve it along side the meat.  Lip'smackin good!

I usually have a hard time getting pork tenderloin to be juicy but this was perfect. We brushed the glaze on the whole time it was on the bbq and it developed the most delicious crust. The spice was perfect even though it marinated for a day and a half. Will definately make this one again.

I love this recipe!  I had a lot of people over and they loved it.  I did add one change though and that was some red pepper flakes for some heat and also used Cedar planks for a smokey flavor it was awsome!

This was delish! Tenderloin is amazing as it is, but add all these fabulous flavors and you've got an amazing dish. Tried it out on my French DH and he loved it too. Definitely something I will make again, this time for a dinner party! Served it with buttered peas and, as suggested, coleslaw with an Asian vinaigrette. Yum!!

Omigod, this was delicious!  Has slightly Asian flavor, so might be good with an Asian side dish.  Definitely grill, though, because a slight charring makes all the difference in flavor.  Just the right mix of spicy and sweet.

This was amazing! I had originially intended to halve the glaze, but ended up using half of the apricot and BBQ sauce and the original amounts for the rest of the glaze ingredients. It still turned out great- the flavors meld together perfectly.  I pan-roasted the tenderloins (too lazy to fire up the grill), but this would have been even better grilled.

Stunning flavorful. Because of my kids I made it with 1/2 the chili powder and none of the hot sauce and they applauded.   Thank you National Pork Board.

Just had this for dinner and the taste is very good.  Immediately after eating my husband said he was going to get another tenderloin so we could have it again for dinner this week!  The weather was not so fantastic for grilling so after "marinating" the pork overnight in the spice rub I baked it at 300 degrees covered for the first hour.  Then spooned the glaze over every 10 mins for 30 mins total.  The rub was not spicy at all.  I omitted the hot sauce from the glaze in anticipation that the rub would be enough but next time I think I'll add the hot sauce.

This was absolutely fantastic--I've made pork tenderloin many times, but this was definitely the best! I served it with smashed red potatoes and greens sauteed with ginger and garlic. Yum! Everyone loved it--I wouldn't change a thing.

Wow, this was great. Made as is, but I would use all of the glaze on the grill next time. I didn't like it as much as a dipping sauce, but it tasted wonderful grilled onto the meat. Will definitely be making again.

Made this for my wife an I tonight along with some bacon wrapped asparagus and it was REALLY yummy!  Be careful though, if you use anything more potent than Tobasco for "hot sauce" you may want to scale back on the amount in the glaze.  I used "Spontaneous Combustion" and the glaze was a bit too spicy for my wife.  Great recipe though! Thanks for sharing!

I rarely review but this was a big hit.  My one son is not a pork eater but asked for me to make this again very soon.  My other son only likes his food "plain" but raved over the taste.  Followed the recipe to a "T" and it was simple and excellent.  Served with grilled sweet potatoes and melon...nice summer meal.

Oh, yeah!  This was really good!!!  The glaze is fantastic!  I served this with white rice and grilled red peppers, mushrooms and red onion...a good accompaniment. We poured some of the glaze over our rice.  That was tasty!  I'm now moving this recipe over into my "serve to company" folder!

This was DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe, except I used powdered ginger instead of fresh, dried cilantro instead of fresh and bottled lime juice. Per a couple of reviewers, I cut the BBQ sauce a bit. I cut the glaze recipe in half for one tenderloin, but left the rub the same amt as for 2, per another reviewer. I marinated 24 hours.  I baked it at 350 for a total of 40 minutes, putting the glaze on the last 10 minutes.  Looking forward to having it again!

This recipe by far is the best pork recipe I've ever tried on AllRecipes(or anywhere else) The tangy,spicy rub is magnificent and the way the flavors of the preserve glaze blends together...just amazing! My husband loves to play ginuea pig when I feel the urge to experiment with exotic recipes and he LOVES the tenderloin and went back for seconds.  My only suggestion is to watch the meat on the grill because the 15-20 minutes recommended seemed a little much-- Try this recipe as you will not be dissapointed!

This is definitely a five star dish!  I followed the recipe exactly, and the spice in it was perfect!   I cut the sauce in half, and even then I didn't use it all.  If I were to have dribbled some of it over roasted potatoes or rice, I would maybe have used the rest of it.  I will absolutely make this one again!  YUM!

I made it as is and it was good but not phenomenal. I will eliminate the ginger next time and maybe add chili powder to the sauce.

This was DELICIOUS!  I followed recipe exactly, except I used powdered ginger instead of fresh,  and bottled lime juice (what I had).  I cut the recipe in half for one tenderloin, but left the rub the same amt as for 2, per another reviewer.  I also did not have time to marinate, just rubbed and put on grill, but this was AWESOME!  I think the sauce would make an excellent sweet and sour sauce for shish-kabobs, or chicken or about anything!  I loved it!

I used one tenderloin that I seared and roasted instead of grilled.  halfed the sauce and added less bbq sauce to highlight the apricot.  The apricot preserves and chili powder blended nicely.  Thanks for a great recipe!  PS- didn't add hot sauce.

This is the best pork tendloin recipe I have ever made.  I did not change a thing ingredient-wise, and it was to die for.  Even my guest commented that it was better than anything they ordered from a restaurant.  The only thing I did differently is I cooked it on the grill for about 5 minutes to crisp up the outside and then baked it in the over until a meat thermometer read 160 degrees.  Do not change a thing.

Not sure I can properly explain how much my hubby LOVED this dish.  He complimented evey bite.  I made exactly as written only I cooked in the oven since it's winter.  375 for 30 minutes then added glaze and cooked for 10 more minutes.  It came out perfect!

This is gonna become a commonly used recipe in my house!    I made this exactly as is with a big sized pork loin, trimmed the fat and baked in the oven at 350 for about an hour and a half,  basting on the glaze the last 15 minutes of cooking, then let it set for 10 minutes, with steamed brown rice, and it was a huge hit!! Absolutely delicious.

What a wonderful tasting pork tenderloin. I prepared this the day before serving & is a 5 Star without a doubt.  I followed it exact putting the glaze on towards the end & using the rest for dipping.  My huband, grandchildren~~the whole family enjoyed this so very much.  I served it with corn on the cob & whole wheat rice pilaf.  Thank you again All Recipe . com!!!!!! Happy Cooking Everyone.... Enjoy the rest of the summer!!!!  Nana

OMG!  This was gourmet great!  The sauce is fantastic and the pork was tender.  I don't have a grill so I cooked it in the oven, putting the sauce on 20-30 minutes before done.  I also found & made "mom's coleslaw".  Really enjoyed this and great for entertaining.

Well, I didn't even have all of the ingredients, but I can tell that this is a 5 star.  I was missing Apricot preserves so I subbed Honey and it was awesome.  I amped up the lime juice a little since I figured I needed more fruit/acid flavor.   The other thing I changed was using real garlic rather than powdered garlic in the glaze.  That may have saved the flavor, but it was really distinctive and will probably still use real garlic in the glaze next time. Next store run will definitely include apricot preserves.  Hopefully tenderloin will be on sale.

This was tasty, but I won't go to the effort again.  My husband makes BBQ ribs in the oven by simply smothering the meat in spicy BBQ sauce and then cilantro.  It tastes exactly the same without as much work.

Perfect rating should have been my clue, but I just had to see for myself.  Wow, double wow!  what a great recipe.   Rub has stuff that most everybody has ALL the time, so very easy.  The glaze might require some shopping, I didn't want to go out so I just substituted one ingredient.   Marinated 2 lb roast for 3 hrs, then baked at 325 til temp was 155F.  It was juicy, tender and flavorful.  Next time I will make just a third more glaze for dipping.  Perhaps I will also use a sugar free preserve and splenda to save on calories.   I didn't have apricot glazing so I used cashew apple preserve, which is what I had.  I think any preserve mixed with the chili, ginger and cilantro is going to be successful.

Absolutely yummy!  I love the hot kick to it.  I didn't have or like cilantro so I used parsley on a tip from my mom :) I only made one tenderloin so I saved have the glaze in a freezer bag for the next time.  It was really easy and I will make this again for sure!!

I accidentally bought a pork loin, and this was still 5 stars.  Can only imagine it would be better using the right cut of meat! The only change I made (besides buying the wrong roast) was to leave the cilantro out of the glaze since I don't like cilantro.  

I cooked in the oven at 325 and it was moist and delicious.

The glaze kind of tastes like intense sweet and sour sauce. I was hoping to bring out more of the apricot flavor, though this could be due to the brand of bbq sauce used? It might be hard to adjust the proportion of the bbq sauce without ending up with a glaze that's too thick when it cools down. 

I was a little displeased with the texture of the pork itself, being relatively hard to cut; this might be due to the fact that I had to bake the pork, not having a grill. Not sure if possible, but I might try brining the pork before hand to see if I can get the pork a little more tender.

This recipe was a total hit with my boyfriend and his parents. The only thing I changed was not adding hot sauce to the glaze, just because my boyfriend's father doesn't like a lot of spice. The chili rub had a little kick to it, but not overpowering. Everyone was so happy with the meal they kept going back for seconds, thirds and even fourths. I made the chili rub and coated the pork 24 hours before I baked it. Same for the apricot glaze.

I made this the other day for family and it was awesome. I found a jar of Harry and David apricot preserves in the pantry and thought I would give it a try. My wife complimented it with some forbidden rice with slivered almonds and some sauteed snap peas  and it was a hit! The guys kept putting the leftover glaze in with their rice to flavor it. Being from Texas I kicked up the ginger and chili powder just a notch, marinaded it before heading into work and served it for dinner (about 10 hours).

Delicious!  Next time I will make it spicier, because we really like our food spicy.  I think the sweet and the heat are delicious together.  Super easy to make!

Great recipe.  We were out of propane so I cooked it in the oven: 10 minutes at 400°, then 20 min at 325°, then glazed the loins, cooked an additional 10 min at 325° and then broiled on HIgh for an additional 7 minutes to an internal temp of 140-150° and let it rest. Turned out perfectly moist with some nice char spots on the glaze. Yum.  It was a hit with my husband, too.

WOW!!! This is one of my new favorite recipes!  It is absolutley wonderful.  The only change I made, which was a personal preference and no reflection on the recipe, was to use pineapple preserves in place of apricot.  I broke the rule and served this to company without preparing in advance - boy was I glad I trusted the many positive reviews.  My company raved over it and my husband and children requested that it be added to our normal dinner rotation.  "You can make this again, soon."

This was wonderful.  The spice was just right for us.  The sauce was delicious. The lime juice & cilantro added a great pop to the sauce. I think I'd add a littl of the zest to the sauce next time, just for a little extra zing. But really, it is great as-is.

OK, if you haven't tried this, you need to.  Seriously delicious.  I roasted these little babies at 400 to an internal temp of 145, then tented.  This glaze is amazing!  I added more ginger and just enough heat to let you know there was some in there.  I think this depends on the type of barbecue sauce you use.  My sauce had no heat, so I added some.  Definitely company worthy, and I can't wait to make it again!

THIS WAS SO GOOD - packed with flavor!!  I did not change a thing!  Used freshly grated ginger and fresh cilantro. While the apricot preserves were melting, I whisked together the remaining glaze ingredients in a separate bowl and just poured the mixture in the preserves when the time came.  Also, zucchini and yellow squash would make nice sides for this dish.  Yum!!

This recipe is AMAZING and it never fails to impress guests. I have even had friends request it at a dinner party I was throwing. I have also used this recipe on pork chops so I can make it for just me and my hunny and not have to buy as much meat, I just cut back on the amount of sauce. thank you for sharing your amazing recipe!!

If I make it again, I will leave out the cilantro.  I thought the sauce was tastier without it.  Also, I found this made much more sauce than we needed.  All in all, nice, but I'll probably keep searching for a to die for pork tenderloin recipe.  This was good but not 5 stars.

Delicious!  I could see preparing this ahead of time and then grilling it for company. Also have done it in the oven at 300 for 1 hr, then added glaze and bake for 10 minutes on each side. Did not use the hot sauce. Kids loved the glaze.  Went well with wild rice & beans.

Very flavorful recipe but apparently nobody in my house likes apricot (including me) which I did not know until I tried this. I would definitely try it again without the glaze or a different flavor of preserve. Possible a honey glaze would fit our tastes better. If you like apricots it would be really good I think.

One of my favorite recipes from this site.  When I buy a bulk loin, I cut into chops and coat several with the rub before vacuum sealing and freezing.  Then I only have to make the glaze for a quicker dinner.  Great for dinner parties! Hint: dont coat with the glaze until almost done to save your grill from the hard to clean sticky mess.

I'm picky about pork tenderloins and this was one of my favorites.  Everyone at the party loved it and I didn't use the reserved marinade.  I put it in the oven at 300 degrees as recommended and put the marinade on it for the last 30 minutes (covered in foil).  Very succulent.  I didn't have enough apricot preserves and took the advice of another reviewer and used crushed pineapple.  I also used the black bean and couscous salad and layered spinach salad with some riced sweet potatoes and peas.  Yummy and great way to celebrate the holidays with lots of color!

This flavor combination was lovely. I made the sauce and used the dry rub on chicken breasts that I braised after searing in a cast iron pan. The only thing I would do differently would be to add a little cayenne to the rub, I ended up wishing it was just a little bit spicier. But the flavors, total package and appearance were wonderful. Can't wait to try this on the grill next summer!

This had tons of great flavor!  I use ground ginger instead of fresh because I didnt have any on hand but I had all of the rest of the ingredients.  I am so glad I tried this recipe!  Thanks!

Excellent!  Had a little sauce left over and used on the grilled chicken the next night, delicious. Don't leave out the fresh cilantro.

Fabulous! I did not get fresh ginger, so think I might have not used enough of the ground ginger in the glaze, but this was amazing!

This is a true 5 star. I made it exactly as it was called for, except I cut back on the chili powder.I doubled the recipe and had two tenderloins. I let it sit in the rub for 24 hours. Then I baked it for two hours with the glaze on it minus the hot sauce. Turning and basting every 30 minutes. It developed a thick glaze which was to die for. The family went nuts for it. Will surely make it again. Served with mashed yukon golds and string beans. I never know what to do with Pork tenderloins, what a great recipe.

This recipe is awesome!  I followed it exactly (except used pork chops) and it was incredible.  My six and four year old both loved it and asked me to make it every week (the four year old is very picky and difficult to please).  Will work this into the regular rotation.  Thanks for a great and simple recipe!

Wow, the juiciest best boneless pork I've ever made!  I served with homemade coleslaw and grilled corn for a perfect meal.  I did the dry rub the night before (threw everything in big zip lock) and it showed.  I had cut down just a lil on the chili powder so it wasn't hot but had just a lil kick.  The pork alone was outstanding but the glaze brought it even further.  Just be careful with your grill.  Mine tends to run high so I put it just above medium for about 10 minutes on one side and it got a bit charred.  I flipped it and grilled another 8 or so minutes; basted with glaze and did 2 more minutes on each side.  Searing on the grill really locked in all the juices.  And even though one side was a lil well done I easily trimmed it off before serving.  I can't wait to make again, thank you.

I love this recipe!! I've cooked it on the grill and in the oven and it has turned out beautifully both ways. Everyone I've made it for has loved it too and demands me to make it every chance they can. I wouldn't change anything about this recipe!

This was absolutely excellent the spiciness of the chili powder, and the sweetness of the apricot glaze makes the dish.  I don't think I would like it much without both.  Will definitely do it again.

This is a great rub, I add cumin & let it sit for at least 1-2 days. The sauce if perfect & can be used on chicken as well.

What a great recipe. I used raspberry preserves left out the cilantro and used lemon instead of lime. It's what I had on hand. This is one to serve to guests.

Okay, I feel like I'm cheating here as my meat isn't even out of the oven yet (ssooooorrryyy), but I just had to rate for my own personal records if nothing else.  The Apricot/Ginger Glaze is simply to die for - I made it first as I wasn't in the mood for anything "too barbequey" and I wanted an idea of what I'd be looking at.  Truly  outstanding - only change I made was having to use an Apricot/Pineapple Marmalade as that was all I had (okay - okay - and I was short on BBQ sauce as well - about 2/3rds of what they called for), but yikes - wonderful.  I've another recipe for cornbread stuffed chicken breasts that are baked with an apricot/chicken broth glaze and that is SO out the door.  The ginger, hot sauce, and lime juice just give this so much depth of flavor....can't rave enough!  If I'm wrong with outcome of final product, will revamp my rating, but I'm not usually that far off :) TYVM for recipe!

I'd give 10 stars if I could! Wonderful flavors and so easy.  We have grilled pork tenderloin about once a week so I'm always looking for new ways to zip it up a little differently.  This hit the spot!  We normally use a spicy rub very similar to this one, but the glaze took it to a new level.  And what a gorgeous dish!! Did not (would not) change a thing~Thank you!!!

This is delicious!  I used garlic cloves instead of garlic powder.  One warning, if you use a brined tenderloin, omit the salt in the rub as it will already be quite salty.  I served it with roasted yams and pan fried asparagus.  It also made for amazing sandwiches the next day, sliced thin on a baguette WITH the yams and some of the reserved glaze.

This recipe has a TON of flavor! I don't have a grill so I baked mine in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes, then added the glaze, then baked it for 10 more minutes. This was for one tenderloin (not two). Thanks for a great recipe!

My new favorite recipe! We baked the pork in the oven at 350 for an hour because the weather was too nasty to grill. Other than that, we followed the recipe exactly. I do think it will be better on the grill and I can't wait to try it. Thank you for an amazing recipe.

Need to double up on the rub -- as written, it didn't coat both of the tenderloins well at all.  Added extra garlic (always!); put a little less bbq sauce in the glaze so it didn't overpower the other flavors.

Used the rub on pork chops, then pan seared them. Then put hem in the crockpot with the glaze. Cooked on high till it was hot and bubbly, then on low for about 6-8 hours. Husband & kids loved them!!! Meat was falling off the bone. Served with mashed potatoes & peas.

This was just the right mix of spicy and sweet. The pork loin was soooo tender and juicy. I marinated the loin for approx 5 hours with the dry rub. Rave reviews from the entire family!! I agree there was a lot of extra glaze but I'll save it and use it on chicken or salmon.

My family and I enjoyed this delicious tenderloin for Christmas dinner served with a spinach/fruit salad and brown rice. The rub and glaze flavors go together perfectly. I did four tenderloin pieces and had a bit leftover. For a quick supper the next evening, I used some sliced baguette and made open faced sandwiches--a little light mayo, the pork, some provolone and a dollop of the glaze--then broiled until melted. Very good with  a cup of soup on a chilly evening. I will definitely make this tenderloin again.

Both my husband and I loved this. We did not grill it because it's winter, but baked it instead. We can't wait to try it again on the grill!

Absolutely superb.  I used real garlic as well for the marinade, which was delicious.  Of note, it takes about 5 minutes for the preserves to melt on medium heat.  Delicious and one of my favorite recipes to date.

Wonderful!! I prepped the tenderloin(with the rub) and then had last minute dinner plans, so I but it in the freezer and made it 1 week later.  Turned out great.  I will make a double batch next time and freeze one for later.

A major winner at our house. The rub can make the overall recipe a bit spicy for some, but if you don't mind a little heat, definately go whole hog. We roasted in the oven with a thermometer, glazing twice about twenty and ten minutes from the end. There was more than enough glaze for roasting the loin, passing around the table, and some left over for ribs another meal (excellent, even without the rub).

This recipe is phenomenal!  The dry rub is perfect, and the glaze has the perfect amount of spice (I added the hot sauce to taste).  I don't usually follow a recipe to the "T" but the only things that I did change was the fact that I used powdered ginger (didn't have fresh), lemon juice instead of lime (all I had), no cilantro (didn't have any), and the amount of BBQ sauce (from recommendation of other reviewers).  I halved the amount of BBQ to make the flavour of the apricot more substantial.  And let me tell you...this was amazing!  My husband (who always enjoys my cooking, but never really "raves", let me know how much he loved this dish!)  I even used the left over "glaze" as a sauce for chicken wings!  You have to try this recipe, 5 stars all the way!

Excellent! Fantastic flavor. Be sure and save half the glaze to use as a sauce when you slice and serve the meat. It is very spicy but this may be because I used McCormick Chipotle Chile Pepper instead of regular chile powder. I also added a little lime zest to the glaze and an extra table spoon of brown sugar to sweeten it a bit more. This was very, very good. Will make again for sure!

I whipped this together for a large family get together.  Easy recipe to follow with no special ingredients to run to the store for.  The results are outstanding.  Everyone at our Sunday dinner party loved it...4 lbs worth of tenderloin was almost polished off.  Very, very flavorful rub with an equally delicious glaze.  Thanks for posting!

I pan seared the pork first and then baked in the oven at 425F.  I poured the glaze over the meat before popping it in and turned out great!!!  Note:  as other reviewers have said, there is way too much sauce left over.  Half the recipe and you will be fine (or use leftover sauce for dipping wings the next day;)

Great recipe - instead of starting out on the grill, i smoked the pork loin on Pecan at 235F for 1 hr, then moved over to the grill.  I got a nice grilled glaze after about 8 mins on each side, after which i let them rest, wrapped in foil for 30 mins.

OMG this was an awesome recipe.  I baked it instead of grilling due to weather.  It was totally awesome.  I put rub on and placed in a oven preheated to 300 degrees for 2 1/2 hours.  However during the last 20 minutes of cooking I basted it in the glaze and put back in for 10 m. took out and turn the pork over and basted it.  cooked 5 min or so and YUMMY was the result. Thanks for this one.  My family of very picky eaters said that this one is a KEEPER!!  My husband wants me to cook it for his mother. Now that is impressive. lol... Update: I made this for my In-laws and family and they raved about this one.  The meat just melts in your mouth. Thank you again!! :)

Made this exactly as stated, baking in oven instead of grilling and it is now a family favorite!  HOWEVER, there is a mistake - the 1/2 tsp of garlic powder should be salt, which is indicated in the recipe instructions, but not in the ingredients.  Garlic powder is listed twice in error.

I've made it 5 or 6 times now after having it at a dinner party. It turns out awesome every time! I would note the fresh coriander really makes a difference. I've made it once with dried coriander and another time with only half the amount fresh and both times it was noticeably missing something.

I made this recipe for Easter Dinner YEARS ago and just now found it again and made it for dinner. It is so DELICIOUS!! The salty chili rub mixed with the sweet apricot glaze and such a great flavor combo. I ended up just basting it at the last 5-10 minute and having the extra has a sauce for people who wanted more after it was cooked. I also cooked it in the oven instead of the grill since it was raining. I seared it first in a pan for a few minutes and then finished in a 350 oven until the internal temperature was 150. It maybe took 25-30 min in the oven. So good! My family of me and 4 boys ate most of it for dinner and I'm claiming the leftovers for tomorrows lunch!

This turned out beautifully!  I pretty much followed the recipe ingredients as written, except I halved everything because I used a very small tenderloin for the 2 of us.  I  also cooked this in a 300 degree oven for about 45 minutes, then brushed on the sauce and let it cook 10 more minutes on each side.  Very easy and I had most of the ingredients already, most definitely a keeper!

I didn't follow the recipe exactly - I simplified it according to my tastes. For instance I didn't add bbq sauce, lime or cilantro in the glaze - I did ginger powder because I didn't have fresh and red pepper flakes instead of hot sauce. I also halved the recipe. It was soooo good! Will definitely make again.

My husband and I enjoyed the chili rubbed pork, but not a huge fan of the apricot ginger glaze.

I made a this tonight and it was really tasty. Really well balanced dish and that rub blackened beautifully on the BBQ. I had quite a bit of both the rub and the glaze left after smothering the tenderloins in both, so next time I'll cut down on the amounts. Overall, really really great!

Originally I got this one for the rub, but I like it as a whole with the glaze. I bake a pork loin on a glass dish at 350 for an hour instead of grilling tenderloins.

This was delicious!  We followed the recipe exactly as written. We did not reduce the chili powder and didn't notice any spice. The whole family ate it, even the kids, and everyone is fighting over the little bit of leftovers. There was a lot of sauce...but I'm saving that to make another one in a few days.

Oh my goodness!!!  I'm not a big fan of pork but I could eat this dish at least twice a week it's so darn good!!!!  I stick fairly close to the original recipe.  The rub can get pretty warm so when we make it, I only rub one tenderloin and leave the other one plain.  The sauce has a bit of zing to it and gives enough spice all by itself.  My Aunt is in a gourmet cooking club and I've shared this dish with her.  She loves it too!

YES!!  I didn't have apricot preserves...so I use raspberry instead.  Delicious!!  Also, I baked the tenderloin in the oven instead of cooking it on the grill.  Very tender and juicy!!  The glaze was amazing!!

Pork tenderloin is so fast and easy to cook on the grill.  The combination of the dry rub and the glaze worked very well together.  You could adapt it to suit your own taste.  I don't like a lot of spicy hot, so I left out the hot sauce.  I also didn't have quite enough apricot preserves, so made up the difference with apple butter. I made 2 and froze one for later.

Big flavor. Grilled it and finished with the glaze in the oven. Twice as much glaze as needed, but I'll use it on roasted chicken later.

I've made this a few times now! Delicious!  Love the dry rub!  I marinate it for about 12 to 24 hours.  Then I baste it with the scrumptious glaze.  And if that wasn't enough...I then wrap in in bacon and baste again...that's right!  YUM!  I bake it at 450 for 15 minutes and then lower it to 350 until the internal temp is 140/145. I then take it out and cover it and let it stand at least 15 minutes. Watch the bacon while it's in the oven, you may need to cover with foil.  Thanks for a great recipe idea!

Great stuff!  I didn't have fresh ginger on hand so I used ginger jam instead.  Second time I made it, I cut back on the BBQ sauce just a bit.

I cut the chili powder in half due to those in the family that do not like spicy food.  I rubbed the pork, wrapped it and put it in the fridge for about 24 hours.  Made the glaze the night before.  Everyone really loved this!  We had lots of glaze leftover so we used it to baste tuna steaks on the grill a few nights later- delicious!

This recipe turned out wonderfully! We tried it the following weekend on chicken and it was equally delicious. On the pork the first try, we substituted mango preserves for the apricot, which gave it a bit more of at tropical flair. Meat was tender and juicy, loads of flavor. Will continue to make this in the future!

Love this recipe!  I tried to make it as written but had to make some substitutions based on what I had on hand.  I used peach preserves and brown sugar in the rub.  For the glaze I only had 1/4 cup BBQ sauce, no ginger or cilantro and it still turned out great.  Thanks!

This was good. I had a single 2-pound tenderloin so the salt in the rub wound up being too much. (Less surface area than in 2 singles.) In the future I would modify the salt to match my meat (my mistake) and use peach jam instead of apricot simply because it turns out I still hate apricots in in jam form. Relic of my childhood, I guess. Thanks for sharing! (The sauce was great over grilled broccoli & steamed rice.)

We love this recipe and use it anytime we have guests and want to grill.  It's always a hit!  The sauce is different and delicious, yet easy to make.  It's great on chicken too.  I've also used the rub mixture on country style pork ribs.  This is a definite staple for your recipe collection.

Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Tastes best when made with homemade apricot jam. But still excellent with store bought.  The only thing is the meat temperature. With my thermometer the meat is still raw at that temp. Cook longer

Outstanding!My family can't get enough and requests this every time I host Sunday dinner.  I cut the bbq sauce to 1/4 cup when I make this now, as the bbq flavor is a little too dominant in the sauce.  I'm a huge cilantro fan, so I seem to add more and more every time I make it.  Great recipe. Definite winner.

Super glaze.  That was my fav part.  The blend of ginger, hot sauce, apricot preserves, BBQ sauce, etc.. So good.

This recipe is excellent and always a big bit. There are two things I do different: 1.) I sear each side for 2 min before putting in the oven at 350F and I bake to 140F and let rest 15 min before cutting. 2.) I don't add the hot sauce to the glaze in case someone has an aversion to hot food. This is a top recipe for me.

Unbelievably good!  My husband said this is now the only recipe we'll use for pork tenderloin.  Loved the addition of cilantro!  Such a unique combination of flavors.  A real winner!!

my husband loved, but i wasn't super impressed, it was ok, but i thought with all the reviews that it would have some heat, but it was mostly a really smoking taste...will try again.  maybe just add more hot sauce.

Delicious!  I used pork chops and did it in the oven at 325 degrees for 40 minutes and it came out perfect!  Nice and moist and great flavor.  My husband is very picky and he even loved it.  Will definately do again.

A very good, very easy recipe (might well be 5* if made as written but I made a few modifications based on my circumstances).  I agree with reviewers who said the recipe for apricot BBQ sauce makes alot.  I made a 1/3 recipe for one (rather plump) tenderloin (served 3) and that was perfect.  For the rub, I didn't have garlic powder, so grated in fresh garlic, which worked fine (rub became more of a paste).  After adding the "rub", I only had an hour before I had to cook it.   I followed the advice of a reviewer who suggested roasting at 425 as an alternative to grilling.  I added the first half of cooking-designated glaze after 10 min and the second bit 10 min later, and rotated each time I glazed it.  The total cooking time was about 30 min to reach 165 degrees.  Served with the reserved glaze, roasted mini potatoes, and coleslaw.  A very easy weeknight meal but this is nice enough to serve to guests.

Excellent. Made it with about a pound of chicken. The rub was the right amount for me. I had to halve the sauce because I didn't have enough apricot preserves and I thought it was the right amount, not too saucy, just saucy enough. It has a really lovely sweet and spicy flavor. It appeared at first more compliacted a recipe as you have to marinate and then create a sauce, but it was very easy!

I used the spice rub on a tenderloin I put in the crockpot. It was so good. I put it in a ziplock bag for 4 hours in the frig, turning it occasionally to coat it evenly. Then I cooked it slow in the crockpot with just a bit of water. I will use this recipe again! So simple but so good! I look forward to trying the glaze when I grill one as well...

OH MY! This was AWESOME! I cut the chili powder in half because I don't like too much spice and we have a toddler and it had NO heat with half the amount. Easily could have used a little bit more. Also, the glaze made A LOT - would make 1/2 or 3/4 a recipe amount (Note: we don't drown our pork in the sauce when eating, but if you do then make the full recipe.) This is a new staple in our house.

This is absolutely delicious.  It's versatile, too, as I've made it before using apricot, I've made it with peach, I'm sure there are some other jellies that will work as well, too.  Definitely one to keep in the "remake this soon!" pile!

Very good! The pork came out very tender, juicy, and flavorful. The ginger in the apricot glaze was a little over powering to me. I think next time I will reduce the amount of ginger... just my personal preference. Also I had a lot of glaze leftover. I may cut the glaze recipe in half next time. Will definitely make this again! This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious. I marinated for about 5 hours. It took longer to cook - about 28-30 minutes total - and it was very moist! I didn't have parsley, but I didn't miss it. I used my husband's "Dave's Insanity" hot sauce..I only used a few drops because it's so hot, and it added a nice kick, but not too much. Will definitely make again.

This is definitely a five star recipe!  My entire family (including 2 small children) absolutely devoured it.  I found that I only had one cup of the apricot preserves, so substitued the remainder with pineapple preserves.  The pineapple really added a great flavor~and I would definitely recommend it.   If you do have the appropriate ingredients to prepare the sauce as listed..you may want to consider adding a small can of crushed pineapple to the mix!  Fabulous :)  It paired nicely with garlic mashed potatoes.

It didn't meet our expectations for a 5 stars rated recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, and although the amount of rub seemed tight, the taste of chili powder was overpowering and not blending very well with the other flavors of the glaze.

This was so good!  I had sauce left over and plan to use it on some coconut shrimp for dinner tonight.  I think that it will be perfect with that as well.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  We eat pork tenderloin a lot and it is great to have one more wonderful way to cook it.

My husband and I couldn't stop saying MMM! through the whole meal. We followed the recipe exactly except for putting 1/2 a tablespoon of hot sauce and garlic powder instead of half a teaspoon by mistake. It was soo good though that we might repeat the mistake next time to be sure we enjoy it as much the second time around. We paired it with some grilled squash and a spring mix salad topped with dried fruit and nuts and a garlic vinaigrette. It was a perfect meal.

Fantastic!  I was scared of the ginger since I've never cooked with it before, but it was mild and didn't overpower the sauce.  It was too hot outside to cook on the grill the day I fixed this, but the pork fell apart in the oven and basted in the sauce and the juice from the pork.  Really really good.  Think I'll try the leftover sauce on grilled chicken!

This was fantastic.  The kids gobbled it up.  I only had one tenderloin but easily would have been able to make two dissapper.  I had to use powdered ginger and did not have fresh cilantro, I am sure that would have made it even better!!

Great recipe.  The pork loin came out really juicy and tender.  Instead of setting it on the grill, I roasted it in the oven instead at 350 degrees for 45min with the glaze poured right on top.  Also, I'm not too big a fan of store bought bbq sauce so I went easy on the bbq sauce and instead added a splash of cranberry juice for that extra tartness.  It came out just as nicely and even the left overs the next day was good.

I made this for my boyfriend and another couple and served it with rice and everyone loved it!  Very simple to make, my advice would be to go ahead and season the tenderloin when you wake up and let it sit...that worked out great for me.

Awesome!  I was skeptical because I'm not a pork fan.  The only changes I made were cutting the BBQ sauce down to 1/3 cup (any more and the apricot would have been totally overpowered) and I substituted parsley for cilantro because I don't like cilantro.  My husband raved about it and ate more than he should have.  Definitely a keeper!

oh my gosh! YUM! my husband is normally pretty hard to impress and he couldn't stop saying how delicious this was. i only used one 1lb tenderloin and the original amount of glaze and rub and it was perfect- a little bit left over but if i was going to do 2 i would definitely at least do 1.5 of the glaze & rub.

Followed the recipe word for word.  It turned out excellent.  The only trouble I had was that my grill wasn't incredibly hot, so the pork took a bit longer to get to 160 degrees.  But still turned out great.  Everybody loved it.  Thanks!

Have to agree with everyone else - 5 stars! Two thumbs, way up! Had one tenderloin so I halved the glaze recipe and still had plenty.  Kept the rub amounts as is.  Wrapped rubbed tenderloin in plastic wrap and refrigerated for about 4 hours.  Did the tenderloin on the grill.  Served with a vinaigrette slaw and boxed angel hair pasta dish. Only changes I would make: less or no sugar in rub since it just encourages burning on the grill. I think Chipotle hot sauce would be awesome in this - pork and chipotle are made for each other.  Definitely will make again!

My husband and I LOVED this recipe.  I took some of the other suggestions and since I had 4lbs of pork loin I used the orange marmalade suggestion for half of the marinade and the apricot/lime.  I will be making this again that is for sure!

I thought this tasted pretty disgusting. The dry rub of seasonings was delicious, however the glaze tasted just like it sounds--lumpy apricots and an over abundance of BBQ sauce. We wiped the sauce off and then it was bearable. Anyone can dumb BBQ sauce on a tenderloin, definitely nothing special.

AMAZING! And easy. We prepared the recipe as directed, other than using orange marmalade instead of apricot preserves. We did have extra glaze like others had stated. There was not one bite left-our guests (2 adults and 2 kiddos) loved it!

This is a really delicious recipe!  Really easy to and tasty to boot.  I had some apricot preserves left over from a previous recipe and it was good to use it up.  I cut the sauce in half because I only used 1 tenderloin.  Spicy, sweet and salty it was an all around winner.

I cut the recipe in 1/2, and it came out wonderful.  I had been concerned about it coming out too spicy, but it didn't at all, almost didn't taste any spice and I followed the amounts exactly.  I think the next time that I make, it will add a bit more chili powder and hot sauce. Also I left out the cilantro, I just don't care for it.  But this was a great recipe, we loved it and will definitely be making again!!

Three letters: OMG. This is hands down the best way to season and cook pork I have ever found. I'm going to keep trying this recipe on different cuts of pork, because it was SOOOOOOO DELICIOUS! I don't think I could ever get tired of this.

So Yummy! We had a lot of extra sauce left over but we can't stop thinking of all the other ways we can use it. Maybe with a little Vanilla Ice Cream.   It was pretty easy. We did not marinate the pork in the rub, because we did not plan ahead enough, but it was delightful still.

Based on the other reviews, I took a gamble and prepared this for the first time for guests - everyone raved about it!  It was delicious and just the right combination of spicy and sweet.  There was even one guest who didn't like spicy food and she loved it.  Like other reviewers, I cooked it in the oven (375F x 30 min, then added the glaze and cooked for about 20 more minutes).  The recipe makes a huge quantity of glaze and next time I will probably cut the glaze recipe in half.  Will definitely make again!

My husband loved this but I just thought it was OK.  I think it would have been 5 stars if I had used real ginger instead of powdered ginger.  The powdered ginger gave it a bitter taste.  I also cooked it in the oven because it's too cold to grill.  I'll try again with real ginger and grill it in the spring.

Wowie!! So good! It was below zero out so I just roasted it at 425 for 20 minutes, then reduced the heat to 325 until it was done! My tenderloin was almost 7 lbs. Man, this was great. I didn't have cilantro and cut the bbq sauce (not a fan) down to 1/2. As we call it... this is a Keeper! Served with garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans..

Wish I could have done this outside, on the grill, but it was 15 degrees with 25 mph winds... so, it went into a 325 F oven instead, for about 30 minutes.  Since I was anticipating the in-laws (78 yr olds) joining us for dinner, I decided to be safe with chili powder in the rub and halved that ingredient.  Two other substitutions: grape jelly instead of apricot (I've read numerous times that grape jelly and BBQ sauce pair up nicely, and it's true) and parsley for cilantro... other than that, I followed the recipe.  Glazed loins at 140 F, 150 F and one last time at 158 F.  Father-in-law gave the meat two thumbs up, saying it was about the best he'd ever tasted.  How good was it?... the four of us polished off the two loins, along with french fries, in one sitting. YUM.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Far and away the best pork tenderloin I've ever made or tasted and one of the easiest recipes also!  Made 2lb roast for extended family Christmas Eve as a side for the non-beef eater, and everyone ate this.  Not even a scrap remained.

This was really delicious. It's too cold outside to BBQ, so I put the tenderloin in the oven at 350 and basted with the glaze when there was about 10 minutes left. Next time I will reduce the glaze some because I had a lot left over. I can't wait until it's warm enough to try on the BBQ!

Only changes were in using real ginger and less of the hot stuff. I couldn't do the Tenderloins on the grill cause it was 0 degrees outside. Sauced them and did them in a pan in the oven at 425 F for 10 min, then flipped em' and added more of the sauce. Made the mistake of just using the olive oil spray - should have used foil on the pan - the sauce that slipped off the tenderloins really burned to the pan. Had to cook a little longer to get them medium (another 5-8 min).

Wow Wow Wow was this the most delicious pork I have ever tasted!  This will most definitely be on our recipe keeper list.  Great recipe for having family over for dinner, I can't imagine anyone not liking this dish, one of the best tasting ever.

This dish was amazing.  So easy, and lots of "bang" for your buck.  Family loved the glaze, and they gobbled up every last bit of it.  It was almost like, "have a little pork with your glaze!"  I made this with the Grilled Potatoes with Mushrooms recipe, and steamed broccoli. My husband said I out-did myself.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Well I found a 7lb Pork Tenderloin on sale.  Searched for something to do with it, and came up with this.  Boy was I glad. This was to die for! Everyone in my family loved it, I brought some to work the next day and they devoured it.  I put the rub on and left it in the refrigerator for about 3 hours.  Then put it in the oven. Served with rice and corn bread. Was a huge hit.  Thanks!

4* - so easy to make, just have to have ingredients on hand.  We were missing bbq sauce, used sambal asli (asian hot sauce)  instead along with  apricot jam (heated up) with cilantro, lime juice, garlic powder, fresh grated ginger.  Didn't have time to let the spice sit, so just seared it straight away and it was fantastic!  seared in a pan on high and then put into the oven at 350 F for 20 minutes......perfection.  Served with  bok choy/red onion/red pepper/celery and garlic stir fry and oven roasted/fried potatoes (as per someone's suggestion)

I didn't have time to marinade for 2 hours - I think I was able to leave it on for about an hour max, and we had to broil instead of grill, but it still turned out well.  The glaze is what makes this dish excellent!  Next time we may try it on some shrimp.  Yummy!!

This is PHENOMENAL!!!! Followed the recipe except I omitted the cilantro(personal preference) and baked according to previous reviewers instructions, came out A perfect 160 degrees, moist and delicious! The flavors are complex but compliment each other perfectly!! I would recommend to anyone and will use for gatherings, it's low maintenance preparation is perfect so I can still enjoy company!

This is really good. I ended up using it on chops since the store didn't have any tenderloins when we went shopping. I forgot I was supposed to put the rub on and let them sit so they only sat for about an hour before we grilled them and they were still really good. I did use some chipotle chili powder in place of about half of the regular just to spice it up a little and add to the smoky flavor in the bbq sauce. I also used orange marmalade because it was what we had in the pantry. Can't wait to try this again and actually let the meat sit in the rub longer

This dish is delicious! Definitely a favorite in our house. We had some glaze and pork left over the next day so we put it over some lettuce and made a salad. You can use the glaze for just about anything because it's so tasty!

My first time I gave it 5 stars.  The second I used a 5 lb. pork loin and substituted pear preserves for apricot.  We all enjoyed it, but I would probably give it a 4.5 this time.  Apparently, tenderloin is better.

Very good!  Tasted like we were eating at a restaurant tonight.  I'd cut down on the chili powder a little bit since it tended to be a little spicy for me.  I didn't use any hot sauce.  I cut the sauce recipe to a 1/3 of it and we still had enough.
