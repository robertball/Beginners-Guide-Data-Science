Instead of adding ice cubes, try freezing the watermelon and then blend with papaya, & honey. I keep zip loc bags of cubed watermelon in my freezer. I take one out to defrost a little while I'm getting ready for work.  For a variation, I sometimes blend it with slices of mango or strawberries! (the ice just waters it down)

This was just ok to me. It tasted like watered down watermellon. I think it could have used some strawberries. It was a light refreshing drink but the flavor was just lacking a bit to me. Watermellon flavored Vodka would be good in this.

Cool and minty!  Make sure you take out the seeds, or they will be part of the drink!

I thought this was delightfully refreshing and a good way to use up watermelon. My teenage daughter was not so enamored with it.

This is a very refreshing drink. I thickened it up by adding some strawberry yogurt and for an adult twist added some silver rum. The fresh mint makes this recipe, so delicious.

Thanks for the recipe!  I made it just as written except I used 1/8 tsp mint extract instead of peppermint leaves.  It's a lot cheaper and it doesn't go bad.  This freezes well also.

This was so great.... refreshing and restorative. I added a couple teaspoons of fresh lemon juice for added tang. It was a great way to use up a rather insipid watermelon. Of note: my husband was badly depleted after throwing up and 4 oz of this perked him right up, settling his stomach and found him wanting more.
