I used 10 cups of blueberries with 2-1/2 cups water + 3T+1t minute maid lemon juice.  Followed directions as writen.  Mixed 5 envelopes Knox with 1-1/4 cups water.  Added 1 cup sugar after berries simmered.  It yeilded 11 8oz Glad snack size containers.  Excellent and only 20 calories per once!  Also was great over ice cream.

I didn't feel like canning this, especially since it makes a very small amount, so I just refrigerated it in a freezer container. It seemed to work just as well. I also used frozen berries which didn't seem to affect the quality- it was very tasty! I made a PB&J with this for lunch and it was one of the best PB&Js I've ever had! My only complaint is that it doesn't spread very well. But if you zap it in the microwave for a while and mix it up, it makes a really good filling for crepes.

This was pretty good.  I used sugar substitute and it turned out well.

Great versatile recipe.  I use it on cheescake, pound cake, as a layer cake filling, and of course pancakes.  I freeze it in small amounts (Glad plastic containers, the small size) and defrost throughout the winter.  Thanks

I increased the blueberries by approximately one cup and the sugar to 5 tablespoons. This worked out perfect for my family as not everyone likes their preserves too sweet. The extra blueberries gave the fruit flavor an extra boost.

I am editing my review since it is now about 6 months later and I have just thrown out the jars I made... totally stiff! Less gelatin next time...

I made this recipe with fresh peaches instead of blueberries.  Be sure to cut up the peaches into about dime size pieces.  Make exactly how recipe calls for.  This is great on bagels with cream cheese and the peach spread.

VERY NICE SPREAD!  I had some frozen blueberries that I needed to use, so I tried this recipe eventhough it called for fresh blueberries.  I made it according to the recipe.  After it jelled we tried it.  The blueberry skins made the texture chewy; so, I emptied the container into a saucepan, heated it, then ran it through a strainer.  Once cooled, I refrigerated it overnight.  It jelled again and made for a very nice blueberry spread that would be great on top of waffles or pancakes.  It reminds me of a cross between blueberry syrup and jello.  Thank you Lovesmurfs for sharing your recipe!

WONDERFUL...low sugar recipe.  I doubled it & used fresh lemon juice (including the zest).  First time I have found a recipe on this site that doesn't need at least 4 changes...& really deserves 5 stars.

I followed the recipe exact BUT I did let the jam-filled jars cool on the kitchen counter overnight before refrigerating. I made eggs and jelly toast for breakfast this morning--we all liked this spread. I loved the textures in this jam and the thickness was spot on. My littlest especially loved this spread. I loved how the recipe submitter sweetened it just enough to bring out the natural sweetness of the berries.

I liked this well enough, especially since our blueberries were so flavorful this year.  I would definitely use more sugar, and might incorporate it in the cooking process.  Final product, as written, is almost like a soft blueberry jello.  Not quite what I was looking for.

I doubled the recipe and it never really set well.  So it was more of a blueberry sauce than a spread.  But it went well on pancakes.

I used frozen berries instead of fresh.  Frozen tend to add more liquid than fresh so I cooked this twice as long.  I also blended the berries with a hand blender.  Very good.

Blueberry Syrup: I failed but wound up making the best blueberry syrup. I had enough blueberries for 1-1/2 recipes. So i tried increasing all ingredients by an additional half. I am sure it went wrong with the gelatin.  I am tempted to experiment with Sure Jell the next time or try just increasing the gelatin amount. It did not set near the consistency of jelly but was very much like pancake syrup.  Boy was i right. That will go away very fast. So if you like blueberry syrup i encourage you to keep the gelatin on the light side and enjoy. If your recipe doesn't turn out right the first time experiment until its right. Good job on the recipe, it tastes delicious. Oh yeah, when my ingredients were in the pan cooking i used a potatoe masher and mashed the blueberries.

I made this and it's very good but I think I'll use a bit more sugar next time. It's really easy to do so I made two in a row and gave one to my mom.

If left out of the fridge for any appreciable amount of time, it'll start to melt. But a while back in the fridge will re-firm it nicely. It's great on buttered toast.

This is about the third recipe I get from Allrecipes. None of them ever come out good. My friend says the same thing.

Definitely a keeper! I used frozen berries from last year's garden and it came out just fine. Just a note: I wasn't sure of the measure of a packet of gelatin but thought it would most likely be the amount called for in the recipe. Nope! A packet has twice that. Glad I measured!

I tried it and love it. I used stevia sweetener. After the berries were cooked , I put the mixture in my bullet type blender for a few seconds to grind the skins. It worked perfectly.

I loved that this was so low on the sugar.  So many jellies and spreads have a ton of sugar in them.
