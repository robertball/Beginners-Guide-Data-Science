I tried this recipe because I had the ingredients on hand and I needed to make use of some Rice Krispies. The flavor was good-not too fishy. I liked the tang of the mustard in the topping (I used Zataran's Creole mustard). The texture was just different. I think I was expecting a tuna noodle casserole. I know noodles are not an ingredient, though. I might make this again if I am in the same ingredient situation but I think I prefer a tuna casserole with noodles and cheese.
