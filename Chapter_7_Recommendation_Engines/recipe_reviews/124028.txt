I make something very similar to this and we call it a breakfast quiche.  I use a whole pound of cooked meat (sausage, bacon, etc.) a sleeve of finely crushed Club crackers (which equates to about two cups) omit the butter and combine all.  Bake in a 9x13 casserole dish.  Do not double it as it will not turn out right, just make a sccond batch.  You can prepare in advance or bake immediately and it reheats well.

This was excellent, my husband really doesn't like casseroles and he loved this, great for warming up afterwards as well.  I added about 1/4 cup of parmesan to the mix.

Absolutely love it! After making it as is twice, I now add a couple extra eggs & 3-4 more pieces of bacon to up the protein a bit. Comes out perfect every time! Thanks, Patsye!

Great 5 star easy & delicious recipe!  I used one sleeve of Ritz(R) crackers, added about 1/4 cup of chopped Vidalia onion and used real BUTTER!  This recipe could be changed quite easily by using ham, sausage or chopped peppers. Thanks Patsy Yonce for sharing your recipe - it is a keeper for me.

We didn't care for the saltines, it left a odd texture.

This is a great recipe.  Very tasty, very easy.  I choose it for it's simple ingredients.  I served it to a dozen teenagers and they gobbled it up.

Well I really liked this but my guys thought it was so-so. I halved the recipe- because I didn't want to have waste in the event they didn't like it. My Husband said he probably would have liked it better if he didn't see me make it last night. (must've been the crackers). I did add one more piece of bacon and used heavy whipping creme instead of milk. I am going to try this again.

Made this for recipe group. Very good. Though I did tweak it a bit (= I used whole wheat saltines. I counted out 30 - and there were just a few left in the sleeve, so I used those, too. [38, total, because I ate 2 (=] I used 3 eggs and 6 whites, to bring down the fat and cholesterol. I used [1.5 oz - ~6 slices] bacon bits, because I HATE frying bacon. I used a triple cheddar mix, and added ~1/2 c grated parmesan, and ~1/2 c feta. I also added 2 minced garlic cloves and a bunch of green onion, diced. Next time, I will probably mix the eggs and milk, then later everything over the crackers, pouring the egg/milk mixture over last . . .

Very tasty for how easy this was to make. Everyone enjoyed it!  Will be making again because you can't get any easier.  We did substitute sausage for bacon.

I made this for Recipe group of 4/7/12.   We thought this was very good, and so easy to prepare.  This recipe would be easy to adjust adding additional ingredients too.  A nice, hearty breakfast to start the day.

I saw this as the Recipe Group selection and it was a perfect fit for using up the last of a few things in the kitchen on vacation. I used Club Crackers and didn't even notice they were in there. I added diced red onion and used Maple bacon. I didn't use any of the butter and it was fine (didn't mean to omit it, just forgot to add it).

Recipe Group Selection:  07, April 2012  My DH and DS loved this recipe.  I thought it was good, but the cracker layer was a little softer than what I like.  I did make one change to the recipe, I used sausage (family prefers & I have a lot of it) instead of the bacon.  I froze a couple of pieces for son to take back to school.  He called and said it was great heated up.  Because this is so quick, I know I will make this one again and the only change I will make is to cut back the butter just a bit.

Recipe group selection of 4/7/12.  I'd really like to rate this 3.5, the recipe itself is written just fine and it baked up just fine, but none of us really cared for this.  I used good extra sharp cheddar and real butter as well as 6 slices of thick cut hickory smoked bacon but it just seemed mediocre and I doubt I'll make it again, but thanks, Patsye for the recipe.

Easy recipe but didn't get oooh and ahhs at this breakfast table. I did use swiss instead of cheddar so maybe that changed the taste a little. Great recipe for making the night before and feeling less stressful in the AM.

Made for Recipe Group 4-10-2012.  Followed the directions as written ( used butter, not margarine ).  No one cared for the saltines in this.  Reheated leftovers were okay.  I may try the club or ritz crackers next time.  Or maybe some lightly seasoned croutons.   Thanks Patsye for submitting.
