Try topping it with this creamy, sweet, tangy dressing.
Mix together: 8-oz softened cream cheese, 1 cup sour cream, 3/4 cup sugar, and 1/2 teas vanilla extract.  
After taking this to dozens of gatherings, I now bring preprinted recipe cards with me for the onslaught of requests I get.

This was a welome sight at our Thanksgiving table, only 2 of the 12 there actually like cranberry sauce - but everyone liked this, several guests took seconds and my husband said - Honey!  This is good! I did not add the pecans.  And I reserved the juice from the cherries, added water to make 2 cups and heated this up to dissolve the jello.  Next time I may try the cranberry jello instead of the cherry. But at any rate, this will become a traditional holiday dish in our house!  2006: Now I've made this over again with some successful changes: I used whole cranberry sauce and like another reviewer used an additional package of unsweetened gelatin.  I skipped the whole cherries since I had the whole cranberries.  It turned out yummy as before.  Now this Thanksgiving I am trying the cran-raspberry flavored jello instead of the cherry to give it more cranberry taste.  We'll see if it's consumed as rapidly as before!

Did I miss something?  I thought this would be like jello - and set in a mold.  Instead it was a runny mess...and I followed the recipe exactly.  I would try more jello packets or less water - this didn't set at all!  Don't think I will be trying again.

This was very tasty, but also very sweet.  I will make this again, but next time I will add more water & unflavored gelatin to keep the consistency.  (It solidified great, as long as you add 6 ounces of jello not 3 like in the small boxes) I also topped it with a blend of 1 cup softened cream cheese, 1 cup plain yogurt, 3/4 cup sugar & a dash of vanilla.  Cranberry haters did like it - never even knew they were in there.

If you plan on preparing this dish to contribute to a potluck or family meal - double it! Everyone loves it, and the dish is empty before you know it!  I normally omit the nuts, for allergy reasons - you don't miss them.

I made this for my family Thanksgiving. There were many requests for its return for our family Christmas. Though I did not use the pecans.  Everybody loved it even the kids!& non cranberry lovers. All asked for the recipe. Great job Sharon!

I have made this recipe for years with the following changes:  use 2 packages of raspberry jello instead of one cherry and only use 3 cups of water and I use the whole cranberry sauce.  It is not necessary to melt the cranberries on the stove, simply stir them into the hot jello before adding the cold water.  I toast the pecans and then mold it in a decorative mold. When ready to serve warm the outside of the mold in a bath of warm water and turn it out onto a platter lined with decorative lettuce and garnish with orange slices. It's beautiful as well as tasty.

Crazy Great Gello Salad!! Reviewer are right: people who do Not like cranberry jello loove this salad!! Tip: used a large package of Raspberry Jello dissolved into warm cherry juice from canned cherries, adding water to make 2 cups. I used whole berry cranberry sauce as my family enjoys the fruit texture.  However non-family members who are also smooth-cranberry-jello lovers slurped this up!!  I also oven-roasted a cup of pecans a few minutes to crisp them up before cooling & adding to the salad. I then poured this into two separate 4-cup decorative molds (sprayed with PAM first to ease removal). After refrigerating overnight, this delicious gelatin salad unmolds onto a bed of greens looking like a magazine photo shoot!! Drizzled some sweet coleslaw dressing over all, sprinkled with a few more roasted pecans and plopped a dollop of whipped cream on top. Wowee Kazowie!! It was Gone in 30 minutes!! Thank you for a fabulous recipe!!

Double stars for this, 5 just isn't enough!Loved it for my thanksgiving feast and it will definately appear for Christmas too. Divine and so easy to make. I couldn't bear to put it in a 9x13 pan though. It's too beautiful...just lightly oil a mold of any kind and chill it until set. To release it from the mold put the bottom of the mold in hot water for no more than 10 seconds and flip it onto a plate . Gorgeous just gorgeous!

I really enjoyed this salad.  I only had whole cranberry sauce on hand, so I used that and it didn't set up well.  But I just added one packet of dissolved unflavored gelatin and it turned out fine. Great taste.

I made this for Christmas Eve and then served the leftovers on Christmas. I was very pleased with the results and had many request for the recipe. Followed the instructions exactly except I served in a crystal bowl and it looked lovely. If you do this then cut down on the nuts since they float to the top and you will have less surface area to cover. I disagree with the reviewer that this taste nothing like cranberries and like cherry jello. It does have a subtle cranberry flavor and the cherry flavor blends in very well. Will make again next year.

I made this for a Ladies Valentine Luncheon (16 guests).  I changed the recipe a little to use what I had available.  But everyone loved it!  Here's what I changed: I used strawberry gelatin rather than cherry, and I used fresh sliced strawberries rather than the pitted cherries.  Otherwise I followed the recipe and scaled to make 24 servings.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it received rave reviews from all who tried it.  Everyone had seconds!  I served it in a decorative glass bowl and it was beautiful.  I omitted the pecans because of the kids, although I think they would have been delicious in it.  I also had whipped cream on the table for anyone who wanted a dollop on top.  It was absolutely delicious and I will make it a lot.  My mom even asked for the recipe!

One word - awesome!  I was short on refridgerator space this Thanksgiving so I prepared it the night before, stored in my freezer and then took it out the next morning to defrost.  Everyone loved it - very cool and refreshing.

Everyone loved this gelatin salad.  Before dinner was finished we all voted to have this for Christmas dinner and for next years Thanksgiving meal.  100% better than the canned jellied cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving past.  Christine

I made this salad as part of our Thanksgiving feast, and everyone LOVED it (many went back for seconds)!  It is simple to make, pretty on the table, and so tasty!  I do not care for plain cranberry sauce, but loved this salad.  The cherries and cherry jello make it sweet, and the pinapple gives it that little something extra.  It is great for kids, who focus on the jello and forget that they are getting cranberries, cherries, and pineapple as well!  It is also fairly light because it does not have a rich cream topping, as many gelatin salads do.

This was really good.  Use the right amount of Jello - a small box is 3 oz so you need two boxes.  Prepare the Jello according to this recipe directions, not the box directions, otherwise you're adding twice the amount of water than needed.  I used sweet cherries packed in water and pineapple packed in its own juice to cut down on the sweetness. I also added a teaspoon of lemon juice. I used the cherry juice and added enough water to make 2 cups for the liquid. I left the pecans out.  I'll be making this again soon.

My family would give 10 stars if we could. I made this for Christmas Eve. I have been assigned the cranberry jello person for years. I have been making a different for years, but will now bring this one.  Everyone has agreed this is the WINNER! I did follow the suggestion of "frosting" once it has set with:  8oz. softened cream cheese, 1c sour cream, 3/4c sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla. It was nice and firm and we cut it in squares. Thanks Sharon.

I love gelatin salads and this is so good.  The cherries really add to the flavor. Not only does it look pretty, the flavor is wonderful.

Wonderful! We'll enjoy this more than just at the holidays. Easy and quick. I put it in a Jello mold sprayed lightly with Pam, and it came out perfectly.

This jello is DELICIOUS!! I've made this about a dozen times over the last year because everyone LOVES it and everyone wants the recipe!  And if you have a cranberry-hater like I do, don't tell them they're in there and they'll never know.

Took it to a Christmas party and it was snarfed down!  Added one extra box of jello per Marleen's review and the topping in the review by MPCHARVAT.  It was really dessert like and tasted great.  Will definitely make again.

My family -young and old- loves this salad. I make it every Thanksgiving and it's always a hit! Only change I make is I leave out the nuts (family doesn't care for them) and I add sliced oranges and parsley as garnish on the top. Thanks for this delicious and festive recipe!

I made this for my diabetic grandpa who recently had a stroke and is in hospital. He loves gelatin salads. I used sugar free jello, a little less cranberry sauce, and I drained all the fruit and added an extra package of sugar free cherry jello and 3/4 cup extra water (because the fruit has sugar in it.) I poured it into mini disposable tin foil loaf pans, and bring him one every day when we see him. He LOVES it! Thanks for making his day. As a side note: I hate gelatin salads, and I can't stop eating this one...I would eat it as a dessert and can't wait to try other flavors of jello, like black cherry or wild cherry or raspberry...mmmm.

This is an outstanding recipe and I have made it for several family and church gatherings and everyone raves about it.  I have made one slight change and that is to use the whole berry cranberry sauce instead of the jellied cranberry sauce.

I made this with our Christmas dinner. I used dark cherry gelatin and omitted the pecans. It was not too sweet and a nice change from the fruit salad I usually serve. Everyone enjoyed it. Thanks!

Yum! This was very good, and I do not even like cranberry sauce that much. I made the cream cheese topping someone suggested, but it would have been delicious without it too. (I would suggest making one batch with topping and one without, the cream cheese was too sweet and heavy for some people's taste.) I accidentally dumped an entire 16 oz can of pineapple in instead of the smaller amount, but it tasted just as delicious! I added cut up peaches and pears too, and I rinsed and used the cherries from some canned pie filling since I couldn't find a can of just plain cherries- still good!

I thought this was just okay.  My family has been enjoying cranberries and cranberry gelatin salad for years.  I lost my recipe so I thought I try something a bit different.  This was not a hit and I ended up throwing away over half of it.  It just didn't have the tartness we like.

Great alternative to cranberry sauce.  I too used whole cranberry sauce, accidentally bought tart cherries, 3 oz of jello, small can of pineapple, 1 cup water plus juices from the fruit and did not put a topping on.  Yes it was tart because of the tart cherries but it went well with the rest of my meal.

I played around with this recipe too much, but I am still impressed.  Instead of using cherries, I tried to incorporate the bag of fresh cranberries I had lying around into a mixture that already had jellied sauce.  This can be done without a hitch, but I somehow added twice the liquid after, so my poor salad turned out like applesauce.  BUT!  I decided to throw the mixture in the blender and freeze it, which turned out to be a lovely sorbet.  It sort of tastes like wildberry and the consistency is soft due to the gelatin, I suppose.  Good stuff!

This was very good! It was not like jello though. It looked like it would be able to be cut and served in chunks but when I went to serve it, it kind of gooyed on the plate. It was definitely more of like a cranberry sauce but sweet and really good! I will remember this one for Thanksgiving next year as a cranberry sauce side.

I've made this for three family gatherings, and it's been a hit each time.  Even those who don't care for jello salad love this once they try it.  I serve it with the cream cheese/yogurt/sugar topping another reviewer suggested, and it comes out perfect.

What a delicious jello salad. Everyone loved it. I used two pkg. of sugar free cherry jello and just sprinkled chopped pecans on top. When I make it for Christmas this year I'll try the cranberry jello and whole cranberry sauce just for something different. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

People who don't like cranberry sauce like this because it doesn't taste like cranberry sauce at all.  It tastes like cherry jello salad.  I had a cranberry jello salad at a party and I'm still looking for the recipe, this wasn't it.  But if you like cherry jello, make this one.

My family loves this recipe and they don't even like cranberry sauce!  The only thing I did different was to use fresh cranberries.  Following the "whole berry" recipe on the back of the bag but reducing the water to 1/2 a cup, I mashed the berries with the back of a spoon. It set beautifully and had a great texture.

This was a simple, to the point, yummy recipe. The only reason it's not totally kid friendly is becuase it's red and stains.  We loved it and will make it again!

The jello turned out more like sauce. It had a good flavor but not a thick jello consistency at all.  I put another pack of jello after 1 night and it still didn't set up completely.  I ended up freezing it and calling it sherbert.

This rating is with modifications.  I wanted to use up a can of jellied cranberry sauce and I wanted to make a frozen dessert. I used this recipe as a template only, but it stood up great to the modifications so it's getting 5 stars. If it didn't work I wouldn't have rated it at all since my modifications were pretty major.  I only had a 3 oz package of sugar free peach jello so I used that and mixed with 3/4 c of hot water, not the 2 cups the recipe called for. I drained and pressed all the juice off a 14 oz can of pineapple, used a can of mandarin oranges (well drained) instead of cherries, and added an 8 oz package of cream cheese I melted in the microwave (and stirred smooth before adding to the fruit/jello/cranberry sauce mixture.) Then I stirred in 1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut. After pouring the mixture into a pan sprayed with Pam, I crushed some walnuts over half of it and patted them in (only some of us like nuts. I marked the nut end of the pan with a marker on the handle for reference.)   Then I put the pan in the freezer for several hours and topped it with cool whip before serving. Everyone in my house liked it, but we all like coconut a lot. It was creamy but chunky and had that frozen dessert texture I love.

Great recipe!  I add small pecan pieces to half of it and leave half for those who are allergic or don't like pecans.  If you don't want to use the cream cheese mixture topping, cool whip works well too.  Whether in a jello mold or in a glass pan, the taste is fantastic!  This is now a standard dish for Thanksgiving and Christmas family gatherings.

This is an excellent cranberry dish.  I made this yesterday with a topping and minor changes.  I used a can of jelled cranberries, a can of whole cranberries, a large can of crushed pineapple, the cherries and as per another reviewer a small can of mandarin oranges.  I drained the juices from the fruit and used it for the liquid to mix with the large box of cherry jello.  I omitted the pecans at this point.  After cooling to set, I made a topping using one 8 oz pkg of cream cheese, 12 oz. Cool Whip, 1/2 cup sugar and a small container of strawberry yogurt.  I spread this on top, garnished it with fresh stawberries and sprinkled the chopped pecans on top.  DELICIOUS!!!!!

I made this for thanksgiving this year. I used whole cranberry sauce instead of jellied and cherries. I couldnt find cranberry jello as reviewers suggested, so I used the cherry as in the recipe. I also made the tangy cream cheese topping as suggested by a reviewer - this is what I think made the whole thing. If I hadnt made the cream cheese icing for it, I think it would have been just a plain cranberry salad - nothing spectacular. But people did like it w/ the cream cheese icing... may or may not make again.

Super delicious. Even the family members who claim not to like cranberries no matter what you do to them liked it. I had to substitute pitted red tart cherries and added Splenda to sweeten them as my grocery store didn't have the sweet cherries. But it is delicious and even some of the small children liked it very well.

We make this recipe every year!  The kids and adults love it too!  It is easy and yummy....nice texture.(my kids love it more when we add marshmellows to the top,after jello cools)  I made this once with cherry pie filling because I couldn't find the dark-pitted cherries, It changes the color, to a brighter red, and the cranberry flavor is not as strong, but it is incredibly good. This is a great recipe!

Loved it! Used sugar free jello. The cans of cranberry are now 14oz instead of 16oz so the sweetness was cut down a bit. Next time I may drain some of the juice in the pineapple to cut more sugar. Only used about 1/3 c of pecans & I thought that was a good amount.

With the topping this is a fastastic jello salad!   And am not usually a big jello fan!  Two tips.  Use the water drained off the cherries for the jello.  For the topping less sugar is better.  Allows it to compliment the sweetness of the jello.  I use 1/4 cup or a little less, rather than the 3/4 cup recommended (with 8oz cream cheese, softened, 1 cup sour cream, and 1/2-1tsp vanilla)

I've made this recipe for YEARS (and I'd love to know where this person got her recipe!), with only 3 changes. First, I use 1 can whole cranberry sauce, no cherries and I add a jar of marshmallow creme. (GOTTA have the pecans, people!)Unbelievably good!

I am usaually the person who brings store bought things to potlucks...but I went ahead and tried this recipe for a recent potluck at our church and for a beginner, it turned out very good! I got so many compliments and even had people asking ME for the recipe! I have even been asked to bring it again to our thanksgiving gathering. It is so easy and delicious!!! Try It.

We are having a huge seafood christmas dinner and I new the Crans would be missed so I settled on this recipe to get it in there somehow.  I added a small can of mandarin oranges I chopped, I made the other reviewers sauce and set aside, This hasn't even hit the fridge to set when my husband came by to do a (taste test), All I heard was "WOW, where you get this, This is great", So my mold will be an inch lower than it should be,(extra testers) More room for topping I guess, So This is a Huge hit and it hasn't even set up Yet, Thanks, I'm gonna make another one I see where this one is headed already!

I don't eat fruit, but everyone told me this was one of the best gelatin salads they ever had.  I topped it with the tangy topping that MPCHARVAT recommended.  I also saved the juice from the cherries and used as part of the boiling water.  I sent this recipe home with all the families that were over.  They have since told me they have made it for potlucks for their work,etc and they have not brought any home.

This recipe can easily be used for a refreshing dessert.  Serve with gelatin set in champagne glasses and top with whipped cream.  Top with a pecan half.

Use all the fruit(s)drained liquid to create a portion of the liquid required in this recipe.  The flavor will be enhanced!

Leave nuts out of the recipe for those who do not care for nuts!

The salad jelled fine after 6 hours. It was good-even my 4-year old was asking for more.  I personally prefer the orange-apple-cranberry chutney.  It's more tangy.  This is not a relish.  It tastes to me like jello with fruit cocktail in it.  Why put cranberry in it at all if the finished product tastes like cherries?  Good, but not the spectacular Thanksgiving dish I was looking for.

This was really good! I left out the nuts. Instead of using it like a regular jello, I  used it on top of the very popular strawberry pretzel jello. Instead of the traditional strawberry topping that goes on the pretzel jello, I used this topping instead for Christmas. It looked so pretty and festive and everyone loved it! Thanks!

My family loved this! We had it on Christmas Eve and everyone agreed it was a keeper. We made it without the nuts so it would be more kid friendly. No suggestions for improvement, it is great as is!!

Well, I goofed the first time I made this recipe and used 1 3-oz. pkg. jello instead of 1 6-oz. pkg.  However, my guests loved it as a sauce on their ham and thought it was a delicious mistake.  The second time, I followed the recipe correctly and loved the firm jello, too.  Great taste, color and texture!  I left out the pecans since my family is not big on nuts.

I don't like pineapple so I didn't try it. But my family liked it at Thanksgiving.  It's a good alternative to plain jellied cranberry sauce.

Absolutely delicious. I didn't have cherry Jello so I used one raspberry and one black cherry Jello.  Also, no pecans, so I used chopped walnuts.  I mixed the cherry juice with to water to make two cups.  Set up very well.  My mother has advanced cancer and doesn't eat much but she just loves the gelatin.  Best gelatin salad I've ever made.

I served this for Thanksgiving and it was enjoyed by all.  I served it in a large beautiful cut-glass bowl and it looked beautiful and festive.  It really is delicious and I will serve it again. I mistakedly purchased the whole cranberry sauce instead of the jellied but it was still fabulous.  In fact I plan on using the whole sauce the next time I make it.

This was the item that received the most compliments this year - as I tried a whole new Thanksgiving meal based on recipes and reviews from this site.  I followed some others advice and instead of using only boiling water to add to the gelatin I used the cranberry and pineapple juice.  And then I also used the cranberry gelatin.  It wasn't soggy at all.  Thank you!!

As said in a previous comment, this salad (prepared with the topping) received lots of compliments and requests for the recipe!  Even a little girl seeing me with the few leftovers in the pan said, "Oh, YOU are the one who made that!  It was good!"  I had an epiphany this morning thinking that this would be good on a pretzel crust like that strawberry jello dessert. hmmmm...

This was a good jello recipe.  I changed a couple things.   I took advice of others and added the extra packet of jello.  Also, my oldest son doesn't like pineapple, so I replaced it with a can mandarin oranges.  I skipped the cherries.  I did not add the topping as suggested by another reviewer, but I did beat up some whipped cream and added it.  The taste was wonderful, but my son still didn't care for the texture and wouldn't eat all of it, but it was loved by the rest of my brood.  :)  Thanks for the recipe!

2 cups of water is way too much for melted cranberry sauce and pineapple with juice. Very disappointed. It did not jell. Will probably make again, but with half the water.

We're hooked. It was really good. I served it on Thanksgiving with the topping given by one of the reviewers here which is also excellent. I couldn't find the cherries anywhere and finally used a can of fruit cocktail I happened to have. Used whole cranberries. My sister-in-law and niece hate cranberries but LOVED it. Will make with cherries next time. Still, rave reviews from everyone.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty! You cannot taste the cranberry at all! I actually feel like it's kinda healthy with all the different fruits and the addition of nuts. Yum!

This turned out great both times I made it.  The first time I used raspberry jello and dried cherries, turned out very good, used the cream cheese topping as another reviewer suggested, it was good but didn't really need.  The second time I made exact recipe without topping, was excellent.  Will definetely make again.  Next time I may try to incorporate sour cream into topping or layer (sounds good and similar to an old recipe).  Thank you for this one!.

This an excellent recipe.  I have made it several times and it is always a hit.  I do mix up the melted cranberry sauce with a whisk until it is smooth and it comes out looking much better.  My husband says it would make a good, light dessert with Cool Whip. I leave out the nuts.

I have to admit that I haven't personally tasted this salad.  I was requested by my sister to bring a cranberry salad, and, of course, I chose this one.  I got rave reviews from quite a few people, and my mom and sister actually requested that I make it for our next get together, which I did and found some new fans of this recipe.  One thing, though, I forgot to add the pineapple both times.  (It has to be a subconscious act because I'm not a fan of pineapple.)  Either way, the next time I make it I'll use pineapple and really impress my mom and sister.  They absolutely love this recipe, and I've gotten rave reviews from others too.  Thanks for the recipe!  I guess one of these times I'll have to try it.  By the time I go to try the salad, it has already been eaten (probably by my mom and sister too!).  ;-)

I found this recipe while looking for a cranberry based recipe for Thanksgiving. I had 4 people come over and there weren't ANY leftovers. I have made this 4 times since Thanksgiving and every time there isn't a spoonful left the next morning. Thanks for this recipe and adding a new dish to our special dinner traditions!

I made this for a recipe swap group that meets for brunch once a month. Everyone loved it!! I am adding this to my recipe folder and using it for the holidays (and other days too).

Excellent! The entire crowd at our Thanksgiving gathering loved it-even those who don’t normally like cranberries. I made it with the cream cheese/sour cream/sugar/vanilla topping. One thing I will do differently next time is to drain the pineapple, as it was a bit runny. Didn’t take away from the taste, though!

This is a wonderful dessert salad!  Reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it used canned cranberry sauce.  I use fresh / frozen cranberries I chop myself.  Also to make it diabetic friendly, I use raspberry sugar free jello.  After it is jelled, I stir in the cool whip.  I don't use the entire small container of cool whip, but enough to get right consistence.  Put it back in the refrigerator for another half hour minimum to set.

Very good taste, I did use the topping as another suggested of sugar, cream cheese and sour cream.  We had so much food at Thanksgiving and only a couple of people ate it, but I ate the day after and the taste was outstanding.

This has been a thanksgiving tradition for our family for several years now.  I double the recipe and use walnuts instead.  I serve it with whipped topping on the side!  Always a success, my family loves it.

My mom makes a cranberry relish sort of like this. You'll need whole fresh or frozen cranberries, sugar, gelatin (any red flavor, it doesn't really matter. We have tried all different.) At least 1 apple (I like Macintosh), 1 orange, a whole pineapple & canned pineapple juice.  About 1 bag of cranberries to the 1 apple & orange & put in food processor or blender(mom just puts the apple & orange in whole).  Add up to 1 cup of sugar then mix with red gelatin that has been mixed using 1/2 the water it states on package.  I mix fresh pineapple "mush" + extra pineapple juice with the cream cheese.  DELISH! & yes, people who do not like cranberries do like this. :) The cherries I might use this year to sweeten!

Just "ok"  I ended up throwing a good bit of it away the week after Thanksgiving.  Just wasn't special.
