1.19.17  If you like olives and hummus, you should try this recipe, it’s awesome!  Don’t know if I’d ever use it as a sandwich spread, but it was certainly delicious with some Trader Joe’s Olive & Fig Crisps, and I easily can see spreading this on some toasted crostini, as well.  I used roasted garlic hummus, and you get a delicious, salty pop of flavor from the minced olives.  therationalpi, this one’s going into my Favorites folder.

This was a delicious, salty spread great as a dip and on the veggie sandwiches we made. I wouldn't recommend using it on a sandwich that has other salty elements. It'll be overpowering.
