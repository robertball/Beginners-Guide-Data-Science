This was very tasty after marinating for just a couple of hours.  I didn't have red wine vinegar salad dressing -- so substituted with a mix of red wine vinegar and canola oil.  Great way to use things I already had on hand.  A keeper!

Excellent marinade!  My husband loves A1 so I gave this a try.  I used a combination of red wine vinegar and olive oil instead of salad dressing and dijon for the prepared mustard. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate overnight.  It turned sirloin into a very tender and delicious cut of meat. I would definitely try this on chicken just to see what happens...

I miss read the recipe and put in red wine vinegar rather than red wine vinegar salad dressing.  It still turned out okay.  I have to say I think it would be better on chicken than steak though.  The BBQ sauce taste was a little too over powering for me.  I will probably try it on chicken though.  I think that has real potential.

Hubby insists that this is out of this world and deserves a 5. This is a very good marinade, but only if you like barbecue sauce on your steaks. I agree with another reviewer that I think that this would be outta this world on chicken. This really was a nice change of pace. Be sure to barbecue the meat slowly, the sauce lends itself to flaring up and burning if you aren't careful. Thank you for the post!

I Marinated the steaks all day.  I then washed off the marinade and sprayed olive oil on the steaks and used Montreal steak seasoning on each side as we grilled them.....Fabulous.

I recently tried this marinade because it was one of the top rated steak marinades on  this site.  What I was most worried about was that this marinade would have a heavy A-1 Sauce flavoring...and I was right. It's really not a sauce that I like at all. I can't describe what it is that I don't like, but I just think it's one of the worst flavorings for meat! I really don't get why it's so popular. So, while I liked this steak, I didn't love it. And it's probably not something I'll make again because there are so many other great flavors out there! But, if you're a fan of A-1 Sauce, you will probably like this.

Very tasty marinade!  Good on chicken thighs and shrimp as well!  Do NOT need to add salt.  The soy sauce is salty enough.

I loved this recipe! I forgot marinade at the store also and this worked out great. I used two tablespoons of canola oil and two tablespoons of redwine vineger instead of the redwine vineger salad dressing. I beat the steak before marinading it for two hours. The steak came out AWESOME!!!

The whole family loved it!  We used red wine vinegar and canola oil mix, like someone else suggested, and it turned out great!  We only marinated for about 2 hrs, and we used cheaper cuts of steak, but everyone wanted seconds.

This recipe was ok. It tasted too much like BBQ even though I cut out about 1/4 cup. It would taste great on chicken. I don't think I will make this again for steak.

You're gonna LOVE this!  I just barbecued some T-bone steaks and used this marinade.  We ate the meat clean off the bones! I didn't have any red wine vinegar salad dressing, so I used apple cider vinegar instead.  This cut the tartness of the A-1 and mustard and gave it a nice balance.

pretty good, but for the effort, I'd just as soon use a bottle marinade. And I agree with one of the other reviewers - this would be much better on chicken.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  I should have known it wasn't going to be too good when I saw the first ingredient listed.  If I'm going to make a marinade at home I don't usually want to use a prepared sauce. It just tasted like doctored-up barbeque sauce.  I'd have done better to just use lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper on my steak.  Sorry, I won't be making this again.

EXCELLENT!  I marinated our steaks all day and then my husband grilled them when he got home from work.  We literally cut the steaks with our forks.  This marinade is delicious!!!  We are trying it again, and adding red pepper flakes next time.  GREAT IDEA!!  Loved it.

I have fallen in love with this marinade.  I use it everytime I cook steaks, but my favorite is to marinate my meat for Kabobs in it.  Oh, they come out soooo yummy!

I made this for dinner last night and my husband gave it 6 stars~he absolutely loved it!  We had Choir practice later that evening and he told everyone how wonderful our meal was.  He said our meal was like dining in a restaurant.  He enjoyed every bite.  Thank you for sharing this recipe~needless to say, it is a keeper

I made this recipe last night.  I used red wine vinegar, because I didn't have red wine vinegar salad dressing.  I also added in about 1/4 of a finely sliced onion.  Marinated the steak in that for a couple hours, cooked the steak, and reserved the marinade for a sauce.  I boiled the marinade and just added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar to it.  Then served it over the steak.  Really tasty!

Pretty good steak marinade!  We enjoyed this but it seemed like more of a sauce than marinade because it was a little thick.  Overall very good though.

This was so good. I didn't have red wine vinegar dressing so instead I opted to use 1 T red wine vinegar and 1 T of oil.  Seriously I loved it. Thanks for the great marinade!

I used this on ribeyes and then I wondered why?  It was a good marinade, just not necessary for a better cut of meat.  I would recommend this for chicken or a lesser steak.

This was really good! So easy, I didn't even measure, just tossed the ingredients in, marinated a steak for 4 hours, turned out juicy and tender. I wished I had more outside pieces though, the flavor of the marinade was so good. I'm going to try it on chicken tonight!
Thought I'd post that I did try this on chicken and not so good. Too strong. Oh well, was worth a try, still really yummy on steak.

This recipe is the best steak marinade I've ever had!  My friends and family love it as well!  I don't make any additions or substitutions - it's perfect as is!

This was great! I was skeptical of all the ingredients and was a little worried that it would taste like BBQ sauce, but it was just delicious.  I only had about 15 minutes to marinate and it still turned out awesome, not overpowering, just like a steak should taste!  Thanks!

I used this on chicken and it was great.  I marinated the chicken for about 10 hours then cooked it over a camp fire.  I boiled the leftover marinade and used it as the finishing bbq sauce.  I will definately use this on chicken again.  I'm not sure I'd ever use it on steak, it seems it would be to much bbq and would overtake the taste of the meat.

Have to have all those handy things in your cubboard.  It seems like it would be less expensive to buy ready made.  However,  If one has all those ingredients then it could be cost effective.

Needed a marinade for a couple of venison steaks and this recipe was perfect.  I made the recipe, and let the steaks marinade for about 2 hours.  My husband then grilled them on the BBQ. They were so good, we normally eat the with steaks A1, but they needed no other seasoning.

Love this marinade, but I had to make a few changes based on what I had on hand. I didn't have any red wine vinegar salad dressing so I used balsamic vinegar instead. And I ran out of mustard so after a few squirts I just put some lemon juice in instead. And added some red pepper flakes like another reviewer suggested. When we went to put in on the grill turns out we were out of propane gas so we put it in the oven at 500. It still turned out great and everyone loved it!

My family loved this marinade and I would definitely make it again!!!  I followed Jamie Oliver's method of cooking the steak in a pan and it was delicious!!  I didn't have red wine vinegar salad dressing either but I mixed red wine vinegar and light italian dressing together.

Fantastic, I used dijon mustard instead, and olive oil instead of the wine. I used kroger hickory bbq sause instead of baby rays. Couldn't get better in kansas city, thanks for the recipe.

I follow this recipe down to the letter.  It is absolutely scrumptious to the point that I would rather have it than any steakhouse steak.  I also like to pour some of the extra marinade over some homemade mashed potatoes!  So good.  My daughter will even eat this steak and she's a picky, picky eater.  I'm keeping this recipe for good!

Steak was super tender.  I am not a big fan of steak sauce (I used A1) and could taste it some, but still thought it was a great marinade.

I just tried this and I was missing a lot of ingrediants so I substituted.  I used red wine, red wine vinegar, soy sauce, wirchestire sauce, italian dressing, minced garlic, mustard, and honey, syrup, sweet chili seasoning and catchup with water to sub for barbeque sauce with a bit of salt and slap yo mama peper seasoning.  We will see how it turns out - it smells delightful.  My marinade is only for 1 hour.  I laid two rib eye steaks down in the mixture in my slowcooker on low and pierced them with a fork - flipping over and doing the same on both sides.  Letting them marinade in the slow cooker on low should help speed up my process.  Once ready - these will be pan fried in olive oil.  Meanwhile my slowcooker will cook down the marinade to a sauce to serve up the steak with.  I will strain the sauce so all the minced garlic will be gone and then add in some catchup for thickness if necessary.  This should be awesome.

I too, like others used red wine vinegar, rather that the salad dressing. Fortuneately it came out GREAT! I added a little more BBQ sauce, and mustard to kind of "drown out" the vinegar. it was AWESOMW!

This wasn't fabulous but it was pretty good. I think if I was to make this again I might add a pinch of sugar to cut the acidity of the red wine vinegar which was a bit overpowering.

Very good on beef. I made beef shish kebabs. Pounded the steak - cut into cubes and marinated it overnight. They came out really great. I also did seperate shrimp ones - just ok. Definitely for beef only. My company loved it.

I'm not much of a red meat lover at all. My family and I couldn't get enough of this steak even though we need to buy cheaper cuts of meat. I couldn't believe how flavorful it was and made it again shortly afterward.

This was so good! I don't usually like marinated steak, because I like the meat taste without "disguise", but this was excellent!
