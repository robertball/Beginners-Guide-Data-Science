This is a good family meal recipe. ---I varied the recipe a bit. I used uncooked chicken breasts and let them cook with the casserole (350 for an hour)and added some cheese whiz (because I did not have a lot of cheddar cheese on hand). Also used frozen green beans and cream of mushroom soup.-- Thanks.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and it was absolutely delicious! Reading other reviews, I did make some changes to the recipe. I used cream of mushroom and added a small can of sliced mushrooms (cause I love mushrooms). I also added 1/2 cup 1% low fat milk and cooked the chicken with a couple chopped up cloves of garlic. I did not add any extra salt, but did pepper it a little, used "no salt added" green beans and Stovetops Chicken stuffing. Only used about 1/2 cup of cheese (chedder & jack) to sprinkle on then topped it off with about 1 1/2 cup of french fried onions. Very easy recipe and very very good! My boyfriend is now requesting I make it all the time!

I thought this was excellent.  I used leftover chicken breasts cubed rather then can chicken. I also wanted to make a double batch so I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 cheddar cheese soup. I then cut down on the amount of cheese on the top to just a sprinkling.  I added some chopped onion and a little garlic for extra flavor.  I also used flavored stuffing because that's what I had on hand.  I have 3 super picky eaters and they loved it.  As someone else mentioned the leftovers almost tasted better then it did the first time.

The kids & I enjoyed this simple meal, hubbys flying home from a business trip as I type so he didn't get to vote (nor does he get any casserole because there was none left).  I used a 6 oz. box of brownberry stuffing & that was plenty.  Next time I will go for the sage, or onion & garlic flavored stuffing.  Thanks so much Cathy!

Made this for a potluck and got requests for the recipe--great family fare! I'm not a fan of canned green beans, so I used a 20-oz bag of frozen green beans (microwaved 5 minutes and drained). As others suggested, I opted for mushroom soup instead of chicken soup, added 1/2 c. milk, and eliminated the salt. For the stuffing, I used a 12-oz. box of Mrs. Cubbison's Cornbread Stuffin', which I already had on hand. Yummy!

This was absolutely wonderful! Definantly comfort food.  I used sage stuffing instead of plain and its also great without the chicken (I've made it both ways).

Mmmm I think this was very good and very easy to make. I liked eating the leftovers the next day. My daughter said she didn't like it but she did finish her whole plate. My husband said it was good and he did have 2nds. I am going to make this again soon because I want more. I used low sodium soup and rinsed the green beans and did not add extra salt, so it wasn't at all too salty. I mixed in half a can of milk (so it was more creamy and not as thick) and a little cheddar cheese in the soup mixture as well as adding the full cup of cheese on top, I thought it was good with the cheese.

I love this recipe and make it often! If you only have uncooked chicken breasts, just cut it in strips and lay it in the bottom of a casserole dish-top with green beans and cream soup, (you can also use a white sauce if you don't have soup); then top with your stuffing mix. Cook at 350 about 45 minutes covered- then 15 minutes more uncovered. Personally, no cheese is needed for this recipe. I top with just a little of the white sauce.

This recipe delivers on several levels. The guys are still saying chomp-chomp and telling me to rate it 5 stars. It is a great recipe because we usually have all of the ingredients on hand. It is also easy to substitute if needed. Several reviews have mentioned the salt factor. Did not add any but probably should pay attention in this recipe, because as always you can add but you can't subtract. We will be making this many times in the future. Used some french fried onions on top of the flavored stuffing.

I had leftover rotisserie chicken, green beans, and a box of stuffing we didn't use at Thanksgiving so these came together really nicely in this dish.  First I sauteed some onions, made the stuffing and added the onions and some dried cranberries.  I added half a can of milk to the soup mix (I used cream of mushroom soup, low sodium).  I added cheese on top of the soup/chicken/green beans layer and then again on top of the stuffing.  I'm not sure it added much flavor but helped the texture and my husband liked it.  In the end it was a comforting, delicious dish like my mother never made!

The kids and I thought this was a great tasting recipe, however, my hubby thought it was just O.K. He's got a cold and nothing is tasting very good to him right now, so his vote doesn't count. I'll definitely make this again and for those of you who are concerned about it tasting a little salty, try using low salt cream of mushroom soup instead.

This is a rather standard recipe for a baked chicken casserole.  There is a ton of ways you can go about making this recipe.  I add chopped onion and often add a small amount of rice.  I do use cream of celery soup but I also often use cream of cheddar cheese soup.  You can also make a very wet cornbread mixture and pour over the top.  You can experiment adding variety of spices to your cornbread mixture.  Some people put corn instead of beans but I don't care for the corn as it taste.....corny.  I have also put a small carrots in it and peas to where it is similar to a chicken pot pie using cream of chicken soup.  Chopped celery is very good to use as well.  You almost can't go wrong with this recipe.  I do always add some milk and some water too.  Usually I add about 6 oz of milk and 6 oz of water depending on how large a batch I make.

I am sorry.  This was a huge disappointment.  I did the recipe exactly as written.  Neither of us ate it. I appreciate that you shared it with us and I know it is just a question of what we are used to.  I thank you for sharing it.

My husband and I love this recipe and it's so easy to make.  Great dish to make if you have chicken or turkey leftovers.  I use cream of broccoli soup and either chicken or turkey flavored stuffing.  I also add a splash of milk (maybe a quarter cup) so that it's not too dry.  My husband likes to call this "Nikki's Thanksgiving Slop" because it's all of our favorite Thanksgiving dishes all rolled into one.  It's fantastic!

Yummy! I used low sodium cream of mushroom soup; added some sautéed onion and garlic, a can of mushrooms (fresh mushrooms would have been better), and about a cup of frozen peas; and cut back on the cheese. Quick and easy comfort food that we will definitely be making again.

My family really liked this, though I didn't expect to - recipes with canned soup usually wind up all tasting very similar to me.  I tweaked this a little bit and it came out pretty good.  I used raw chicken breasts, cubed, as I didn't have any cooked chicken on hand.  I sauteed chopped onion and garlic in butter and added to step 1.  I also mixed in some of the cheddar cheese with the chicken/soup mixture (and definitely used more than 1 cup total in the recipe - my older daughter loves cheese) and garlic powder.  I don't use canned veggies, so I partially micro-cooked frozen green beans before adding them.  I used StoveTop stuffing rather than an unseasoned stuffing mix - again, what I had on hand.  I baked at 375 for about 50 - 55 minutes and then uncovered to brown the top.  I will make this again, as even my picky 9 year old ate it.

Added no salt. Added extra frozen veggies. It was mushy but overall not a bad dish.

I didn't have any stuffing so I used French Fried Onions and it was great.  I'm sure it would be just as good as written with the stuffing.  Mushrooms are a nice addition as well.  Thank you for my husband's new favorite.

Delicious and satisfying served with a garden salad. This is definitly a keeper. However, I did add more seasoning to adjust to my family's taste. I added garlic salt and paprika to the chicken breasts before sauteing in olive oil, added sauted fresh mushrooms, and used chicken flavored stuffing.

Made as is.  It was fine, nothing too great or too bad.  Oh, I did use fresh green beans that I cooked with a little water in the micro first.

All of my favorite ingredients: chicken, breading, cheese, and green beans! I loved this recipe becuase of the changes I made: I seasoned the chicken mixture with seasoned salt, pepper, red pepper,paprika, a little milk, 1Tbs sour cream, and shredded cheese. I then made the stuffing in chicken broth instead of plain water.  With these changes this recipe is 5 stars! My husand LOVED it!!

This is a pretty good and very easy recipe. I think it tastes WAY better with cream of mushroom soup, rather than cream of chicken. It's a good "on the cheap" and fast meal.

I made this last night and really liked it.  It tasted even better as leftovers  for lunch today.  My picky preschooler also ate it both times, including the beans, which is a real plus, because I can't usually get her to eat green veggies.  I made only one change: I couldn't find unseasoned stuffing, so I used sage flavored StoveTop.  This was fine for us, because I like my chicken heavily seasoned.

My husband LOVES stuffing, and this is a great use for some Stove Top.  To me the cheese conflicts a little with the green beans, so when I make this I pick one or the other to put in instead of both.

This recipe was good and easy. I used fresh green beans, and I think I should have cooked them a little bit first, because they ended up more crunchy than I would've liked. Also, the casserole ended a bit on the salty side. I'd recommend using reduced sodium ingredients.

I have been making this for years. I don't use cheese. I use French style green beans and 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup instead. I use the Pepperige Farm Cubed Herb Seasoned stuffing. Very low fat this way. Everyone loves it.

Good meal..I will definitely make again.  I substituted broccoli and cheese condensed soup as that is what I had and stuffing for chicken as that is also what I had (I only used 8 oz and that was TONS).  I didn't add salt as the stuffing was flavored.  Make sure you rinse your canned green beans, otherwise the dish could taste salty..

Great recipe.  I made it for my boyfriend, who is a huge fan of the traditional green bean casserole, and he absolutely LOVED it and it's now one of his absolute favs.  I prefer to leave out the cheese and add crispy fried onions on top.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used boneless breasts for ease of preparation; I cooked them with the soup mixture for 30 minutes, then topped with the stuffing, french-fried onions, frozen green peas instead of beans, and cheese and cooked for another 25 minutes.  It was a tasty and easy dish, although 2 out of 3 of us found it too salty.  Low-sodium soup and/or stuffing mix might be a good idea.  Hubby loved it. Thanks!

The whole family (5 people) loved it! The only changes I made were using raw chicken and adding French fried onions on the top. Because I used raw chicken, I didn't cook the stuffing but instead added a half cup of chicken stock to the top and kept it covered to absorb the extra liquid. No leftovers.

I give this recipe 5 stars because it is a great base recipe.  Use it as a guide and throw in whatever you have in your refrigerator/pantry that you feel will go with it.  I was too lazy to run to the grocery store so I found this recipe instead.  I was able to use stuffing mix that had been sitting in my pantry for way too long, celery that was starting to get wilty and some leftover velveeta cheese dip and it turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe idea!

Ok, I hate it when people change the recipe and then rate it, but I used what I had in the house.  It was cream of mushroom, broccoli, corn and chicken topped with prepared stove top.  A little mushy, but SO GOOD!!!

My family really liked this!  That made me like it...now I have another "quick and easy" for lazy days!  I only made a few small changes.  I used 4 B/S chicken breasts, cubed and seasoned well.  Sauteed them in a little butter.  Used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, added about 1/2 cup of milk to the soup mixture, used cornbread Stove-Top (2 boxes), and sauteed diced onions and celery in a little butter then added the water/butter for the stuffing mix.  This was quick, easy, and pretty darn tastey!  Thanks!

This was a really good easy recipe.  I used fresh green beans because I prefer to use fresh whenever I can.  I also used cornbread stuffing mix.  It was very tasty and the stuffing was just a bit crunchy.  This one is definitely a keeper.

Was good and kids liked it.  I didn't cook the chicken before adding it to the dish (let it cook in the oven-much faster) and I didn't layer the cheese and stuffing, just mixed everything together and topped w/ French Fried onions.

4.5 stars.  We loved it!  We used a can of chicken broth to boil the chicken, then used that same broth to make the stuffing.  I was a little worried that the chicken flavor might be a little too prevalent and overwhelming, but it wasn't.  Maybe next time I would try Cream of Celery?  Definitely worthy of a "repeat performance."

I followed the advice of several reviewers and used cream of mushroom soup, I rinsed the canned green beans. I also only used 8 oz. of stuffing, and it was plenty. My husband and I both really enjoyed it! We'll certainly make this again.

We liked the flavoring and the ingrediants of this dish, but I don't know what I did wrong but it came out very liquidy. I will try this again to see if it comes out thicker next time.

This is awesome!!! I added a small can of mushrooms and used more cheese on the top. I couldn't find unseasoned bread stuffing mix so used one that said "herb". My husband and I both loved it. This recipe is certainly going in my recipe box to make again.

Really simple to make, but I found it to be too salty and really nothing special to write home about.  I might make it again with a different stuffing mix - I used Mrs. Culbertson's brand, and it made the whole casserole very "gummy".  This recipe might work well with Stove Top Stuffing mix.  All in all, nothing spectacular about this recipe - I was wondering about all of the "Rave Reviews" it got.

Good taste, top crust got a little dry but still good.  I mixed the cheese in with everything else before reading the recipe fully...maybe that would make a difference.  Doubled the green beans, added mushrooms and used cream of mushroom soup.  A good recipe incorporating things I always have on hand!

My husband really enjoyed it but I thought it was too soupy, not a lot of flavor to it.  Probably won't be a recipe I'll use again.

I needed a quick meal and this was great. I did not prepare the stuffing but instead added water to the chicken soup and added some more vegetables. I also added some milk and butter, mixed it all up, put it in the baking dish and after 45 minutes it was done. We had a green salad with it. Will make it again.

This recipe was ok, but kind of bland for me. I was expecting the cheese to add more flavor but it didn't I doubt I will make this again...

YUMMY!  I did make a few changes though..  I used two cans of french cut green beans and mixed in crushed up french fried onions.  I left out the cheddar cheese, I just don't think it would have been good.  I used one 6oz stove top long grain and wild rice and one 6oz chicken flavor low sodium. Before topping it with the stuffing I stirred in some of the chicken broth from the chicken tenders I boiled so the stuffing wouldn't be so dry.  After it baked I uncovered it and topped it with more french fried onions & baked for about 5 minutes. Next time I may use 3 can of green beans because the french cut are thin and I felt it needed more. (we prefer the french cut to regular) I didn't use quite all of the stuffing, seems like it would have been too much. Definitely skip the salt and if you can find it use the low sodium soup and stuffing.  My husband ate three helpings and he never likes anything! At Thanksgiving I'm making this and leaving out the chicken.  I think it will be a nice change to the regular green bean casserole.

I made this cassarole for a Church pot-luck social and they ate every bit of it. It was quick and easy to make too. I added a small 8 3/4 oz can of Whole Kernal Corn along with the Cut Beans and I also sprinkled some French's French Fried Onion Taste Toppers on top. All I had was one box of Chicken seasoned cornbread stuffing mix and one box of plain cornbread stuffing mix. It all turned out OK but was a little salty. Next time I will not add any salt to the mixture.

This was easy and delicious!  I used two jars of gravy instead of the soup, and added an extra can of beans.  A side of homemade mashed potatoes made it almost like Thanksgiving leftovers! My whole family enjoyed it.

It's a miracle. He liked it!!! My husband absolutely loved this one and it SO easy on me to make everything all in one dish. He took leftovers for lunch the following day and then wanted the rest again for dinner the next night! Kids wouldn't touch it but I gave it a 5 for kid friendly anyway...my kids are beyond impossible and I don't think most kids are so difficult to please. I will definitely make this one again. Thank you!!

We all LOVED this recipe! I just used my George Foreman grill (LOVE this too!) to grill 2 chicken breast fillets, 8 1/2 minutes later it was perfect, and threw the rest of the stuff together and was done! Even used fat free cream of chick. soup! Only thing was, I couldnt find a 12 oz pkg of stuffing so I bought two 6 oz Stove Top "traditional Sage"--highly recommend it! Im gonna try it next with a can of carrots or corn, at my son's request!

Very yummy! I doubled the recipe, added french fried onions, a can of mushrooms, and used chicken flavored stuffing. Used some milk to give it more of a creamy gravy. Thanksgiving in a casserole dish.

wow this made a large amount and that's a good thing b/c it came out super yummy.. i used this as a base for making bf's lunch for work and made the following modifications.. 12 oz of kielbasa that i sliced up and fried for the cubed chicken breast, condensed cheese soup instead of cream of chicken and the additional cheddar, a 16 oz bag of frozen green beans for the canned, and turkey seasoned stuffing for the plain.. i also added  one large carrot, a quarter of an onion, and a large handful of radishes that i chopped up.. i splashed in some almond milk b/c it started looking a bit dry.. i didn't bother baking it, just cooked it on the stove top.. ty so much for the recipe

Pretty good. I used fresh broccoli instead of green beans because that is what I had. Also, added milk to the soup which I'm happy I did to increase creaminess. Chicken stove top was used for the topping.

This was plain but good.  It almost seemed a bit dry with only one can of soup, but I wouldn't put in another because then it would be waaaay too soupy.  I did add a handful of craisins and would have added a bit of french fried onions but I didn't have them (I thought I did).  A good simple meal, very quick to make, and everyone liked it.  Will make again, next time making sure I have those danged french fried onions!!!

Yummm! I made some alterations. I used raw chicken breasts in the bottom of my casserole dish. I made the stuffing with 1 .5 c hot water in the casserole dish, added the beans and soup amd mixed well. Then added 1/2 the soup can of milk. I also used cream of mushroom soup , omitted the salt and pepper and baked for an hour at 400. Turned out yummy! Will make again!

I'm a new mom so easy dinners are a must! I needed to be able to make this without having to cook the chicken first. I cut the chicken into pieces and covered it in the cream of chicken soup. Then I baked that at 350 for about 20 minutes or so. Then I stirred in the green beans, and topped it with the stuffing and cheese. After that I followed the cooking instructions in here. Easy and yum!

Reading the reviews, I was skeptical which choices to make the recipe, but I went with the things I had on hand, which were cream of mushroom soup, a left over grilled huge chicken breast, chicken stuffing mix.  It was really good.   Will definitely make it again, and look forward to making it with some of the other ideas people posted such as turkey instead of chicken.   For a side dish along with the casserole I had chilled cranberry sauce & mandarin oranges.  Pretty close feeling of thanksgiving, a hearty meal for sure.   The only real change I made was not using a 9x13 pan.  Instead I used 2 smaller foil pans.  One we baked and had for dinner, the other we put in the freezer for later this week.  Such a simple idea/recipe turned out really nice.  Thanks for sharing.

Pretty good - comfort food, for sure.  I've also made this with ham and mozarella and liked that, as well.  Definitely does not need additional salt.  I keep thinking it wants celery and/or water chestnuts - something crunchy, anyway.  Thanks for the recipe.

Instead of using stuffing, I used 3 cups of cooked rice.  I didn't like canned vegetables, so I used fresh cooked green beans instead.  I also upped the cheese to 2 cups.  After the modification, the whole mixture looked dry, so I added 1/4 cup of broth.

This was very good, but a little salty. Next time I will use low-sodium soup. But there will be a next time!

Glad I tried this - very easy to make & convenient because the ingredients are pretty much always on hand.  I also used leftover chicken.  Will definitely make again & will try with the frenchfried onion rings.  Got a big thumbs up from my boyfriend so it's a keeper! Thanks for this easy, tasty recipe!

simple, tasty, home-y recipe for weeknight supper.  Used a 2-qt oval casserole & only 1 box (6 oz) stuffing, cornbread flavor.

Yum!  This is almost identical to the recipe on the stuffing box.  I baked my cubed chicken in the soup for 30 minutes and then stirred in the green beans and topped with stuffing and cheese to finish it as written.  I did not add extra salt and it doesn't need it. Used an 8x8 pan and it fit great.  Comfort food for sure!

My hubby and I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I tweak it a bit by adding a bit of garlic and sometimes use mixed veggies instead of just green beans. I also double the chicken portion for a larger portion of protein. We really love this recipe!

Pure comfort food! I fried up 2 chicken breasts with some butter and chopped garlic, added some celery when the chicken was almost done. Added a can of mushrooms and I did add a splash for milk too. Mixed everything together and followed instructions as written. I did use a Chicken flavored stuffing (a cheap-o from Aldi's and it was pretty good!) and also used cream of mushroom instead. I only cooked for about 20 minutes, took foil off for last 5 and it was perfect. Thanks :)

I have been making this recipe for years.  I have loved it every time.  My husband likes it as well.  I have changed it just a tad bit and normally add a little bit of milk and light sour cream to the cream of chicken soup.  This makes it a little bit creamier then normal.  very good

Oh, my family loved this stuff. It was wonderful. I made some changes, based on some of the reviews I read, also some of my own, thanks for the advice. Here's what I did. I used chicken breast, and I seasoned them really well, with alot of different seasonings, while cooking. I also used, Stove Top Savory Herb dressing. I doubled my recipe, and used 2 cans of mushrooms. I also added a bunch of spices to my meat mixture before putting it in the pan. Then lastly, I used Shredded Colby Jack cheese on the top, instead of cheddar. Oh, and one more thing, I used 2 cans of Mushroom Soup, in place of the chicken soup. It was just wonderful. Thanks so much.

For a quick no brainer meal that has great flavour you've got to try this, my 16 year old daughter never comments on food much and has asked for this for her birthday dinner this month. I did add half cup of milk as others commented and I added organic frozen green beans..AWESOME !

I did not care for this recipe. It tasted like "bagged stuffing with some chicken thrown in it. I took it to a Christmas pot luck and no one liked it either. There are much better recipes for chicken. I was very disappointed. I picked it because it was easy to make, but definitely not worth the time.

Very tasty and filling. I used leftover chicken cooked with herbs (rosemary, basil, garlic & pepper), French-cut green beans and added onion and mozzarella cheese. My one-year-old son  gobbled this up--even though he hates green beans! I will make this again, although I think next time I will use cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken and maybe add some French fried onions--it was a little bland.

Very good recipe!  I used fresh green beans, gorgonzola cheese, cream of celery soup and turkey stove top just because those are what I had on hand and it was amazing.  I think you are better off with a white/creamy  cheese than a cheddar type cheese.

My family liked this recipe but we tweaked it a little bit.  I added sauteed mushrooms and added about 8 oz sour cream with the cream of chicken and it was great.  I also used a montery jack/cheddar blend, which was great.

This is a very good recipe to have in your family dinner/fussy kids recipe collection. Its tasty, filling and is so comforting! I used a 6 oz box of chicken flavored stuffing and had mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar. It was so yummy. Ok, its not gourmet, but it tastes good and is so easy to make, many times, simple is best.

5 stars for taste and ease. This will be a regular in our house. I used 2 boxes of uncle bens "stuff and such" 120grams. Leftovers tasted even better!

Good, quick recipe. Used only 8oz of chicken flavored stuffing, which was plenty. Also used fresh cubed chicken breast rather than canned chicken. It had a rich taste and I could only eat a small serving, my boyfriend had seconds. I was glad I already had all the ingredients.

This is by no means a gourmet meal, so as long as you know this is a comfort, kid-friendly recipe you won't be disappointed.  I added a can of wole kernal corn like someone else suggested and added some french fried onions for more texture.  Must be my kids amazement, the LOVE this dish.  I tossed on some extra pepper and Viola!  I like!

Great recipe.  I made this to eat all weekend while my husband was out of town and  never got tired of it.  The only changes I made was I added 1/2 cup milk (only b/c I like my casseroles creamy) and used chicken flavored stuffing.

Great, quick, easy recipe!  I couldn't find unseasoned bread crumbs, so I use boxed chicken stuffing.  I only use one box, and it's plenty.  Then to cut back the saltiness, I use Healthy Choice cream of chicken soup.

This recipe was pretty good, however I did make some changes. I used french syle green beans(no salt-added) also added a small can of corn (drained). Then used chicken flavored stuffing mix and put french fried onion on top then added the cheese. Will make again trying turkey breast and turkey flavored stuffing. Thanks Cathy

This is a simple, good recipe.  It was a little salty, but it made great leftovers.

This is a great quickie meal for the cooler weather especially.  I used the lower fat, lower sodium soup and no-salt-added green beans, 2 regular sized boxes of stuffing (stove top - one chicken, one reduced sodium chicken) and omitted the cheese - I love cheese, but this recipe doesn't need it.  It tastes like thanksgiving leftovers.  Yum!

This recipe was great for a quick, easy meal. I used flavored stuffing and added velvetta and white rice to the green beans and chicken. It turned out perfect and everyone loved it. I will definantly make this again.

This had excellent flavor; my husband and I really enjoyed this.  Per some other reviews, I left out the salt, added double the green beans and put cheesy french fried onions on the top instead of cheese.  My husband still sprinkled shredded cheese on the top of his however, so the next time I think I'll add some shredded cheese in the last 5 minutes of baking.

I made this last night for wife and 3 year old son.  Everyone liked it very much.  I added an extra cup of broth on the stuffing as suggested here and it turned out perfect.  Not too dry, not too wet.  Will definitely make again.

This was an excellent recipe!  I varied it a little bit as did other reviewers and it turned out perfect.  I sauteed 4 cubed boneless chicken breasts with half an onion until cooked through.  Instead of using cream of chicken soup I used cream of mushroom (I think this helps with the salty complaint many reviewers had) one can of green beans and one can of corn.  I used 12 oz of Stove Top Chicken stuffing and I left out the cheese.  My husband and 9 year old twins loved this recipe and it is also easy to prepare, my kids even helped cook it!

Doubled...Used chicken stuffing mix, healthy request soup and a quart of home-canned green beans.  Omitted salt and pepper.  Only used 1/4 cup of cheese on top but won't use any next time.  Added diced apple to the stuffing.  It is a bit salty so I'll be looking for ways to change that in the future.  Thanks, Cathy....This one is a keeper!

EDIT: Wanted to add that I made this again tonight with eight cups of fresh snipped green beans, two packages of stuffing, two cans of soup and cubed ham...a nice change from the chicken!  :)

Very tasty!  I included half a bag of mixed veggies along with the green beans (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots) and topped with french onions like other reviewers suggested.  I agreed that cheese didn't seem to flow with the rest of the ingredients.  Doubled the stuffing on top, but when I made it the second time, I used the recommended amount.  Too salty with doubled stuffing - go with the recommended.  I thought it was a five star recipe, but husband felt it was still a little too salty towards the end (even after cutting stuffing amount).

DELICIOUS! I used low sodium cream of chicken (which was perfect not too salty). Also from reading other reviews I decided to add corn (another winner). In the chicken green bean mix I added 1/2 can french's fried onions, then on top of casserole after spreading the stuffing, I added some cheese then the rest of the onions ( I favor the crispy onion taste). Also had to admit it was pleasing look to the eye with the onions golden brown and layer of shredded cheese on top. This is a meal that will be a family favorite!

Hubby and kids loved this!  I doubled chicken amounts (leftovers from chicken fry a couple nights earlier), added a packet of dry turkey gravy with 1 soup can of water....mixed gravy, water and soup together before adding turkey, beans and spices.  Also, I used a whole cannister of chicken stuffing mix from Wal-mart.  Cheese didn't seem to add much.  Next time I may try adding it to the chicken/soup/etc mixture.  But kids did top with more cheese; hubby and I didn't.  Will add to menu rotation...very well received.  Thanks Cathy!

I used a 6 oz. box of stuffing mix, and it came out great.  Very simple idea that everyone loved.  Would probably be just as good with mushroom soup instead of chicken.

After reading several other reviews, I decided to make this as a base and add my spin.  I used a pound of boiled chicken, stuffing seasoned for chicken, steamed fresh green beans, added a half teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, added a half cup milk, added 8 oz of sautéed mushrooms, added French fried onions, and added bacon crumbles.  I have no doubt this original recipe is good...as my results were stellar.  Thank you for posting this recipe...I had never seen anything like it.  =)

Excellent. Simple. Kids and husband loved it. My kids thought peas or corn would be better than the beans...I disagreed.  I did use Stove Top for the stuffing. This is an easy way to use up leftover chicken

Easy, delicious, and yes I will make it again.  I boiled the chicken breasts and they stayed moist.  I also added about 1/2 cup of sour cream so it wouldn't dry out.  Worked!

This one is now my favorite meal to fix, and its my go to meal for potlucks.  I've now made this twice, the second time being tonight and it was even better than the first. When I first tried this one, I subbed the cream of chicken soup with cream of mushroom. C'mon, who puts cream of chicken in green bean casserole?! I also doubled the recipe both times. The first time, I did add a can of french fried onions, which was a nice addition. What made tonight a lot better, was that I used French's Fried Onions "Carmelized Onion" flavor to liven things up. Those things out of the can are good enough alone. Added to this meal, they compliment each other. And of course, I now have left overs. I probably will be making this again in a few weeks for Thanksgiving, maybe sub the chicken out for turkey.

I did make a few changes following other reviews. I used frozen mixed veggies because that is what I had. I added some sour cream and milk to the cream of chicken soup and I layered the cheese in between chicken mixture and stuffing. I will definitely make this again. I found it to be comfort food  ;)

I made this exactly as written. We didn't care for the cheddar cheese topping. It  seemed to overwhelm the flavors of the dressing. If I make again I'll use mushroom soup and maybe canned onion fries for a topping.

As written, I would give this a 4, as it's a little bland.   To bring it to a higher level I suggest the following:  Use cooked frozen green beans, which I think is more flavorful than canned.  Also, we think this is fine with only the small package (6 oz) of  (seasoned) stuffing mix.  I think more stuffing would overwhelm this dish. I also saute onion, green pepper celery and mushrooms (or any combo of these) before mixing.  Lastly a dash of hot sauce (Frank's or Tabasco) and a small can of pimento adds color and additional flavor.

Very easy and tasted like Thanksgiving.   My additions were seasoning the chicken, adding a little sour cream and milk to the soup mixture, and I didn't cook the chicken before adding them to the casserole pan. It came out great! Moist chicken, creamy sauce, and crunchy topping. Will definitely make it again.

As a single mom, I'm always looking for quick and simple recipes. Well, this definitely fit the bill. I didn't change this much at all. I used 2 chicken breasts and instead of just using green beans, I used mixed vegetables. I seasoned the chicken while cooking it and then I also seasoned the mixture and it turned out wonderful. Even my picky 7 year old scarfed it down and she even asked for seconds. This will become a staple for us.

Very good!  I ended up making a few changes.  I added chopped onion and some garlic.  I added some shredded cheese to the mixture as well as a layer between the mixture and stuffing.  I felt 12oz of stuffing is a little too much, but 6oz doesn't seem enough.  I tried using foil on the bottom of my pan, but was disappointed so will not do that again.  I should add that the leftovers are better than the first time around!

Absolutely loved it. I used cream of celery instead of the cream of chicken. Added garlic powder and my own season blend, little extra cheese on top. Just left the aluminum foil on the while time and came out perfecto. Definitely a recipe will make again and again.

Used chicken tenderloins and seasoned it well with seasoning salt and pepper. Used stove top Chicken stuffing and mild cheddar cheese. The green beans were on the side :)

I actually added different ingredients from two different recipes. It came out absolutely delicious!! The prepping took a lil time but I wanted it a certain way. I mixed the green beans and cream of chicken in a bowl , than smoothed it onto the class pan then cooked the chicken breast cubes, Then lay that on top. then sauté onions in butter and flour sugar and salt , sour cream in a pan. Then lay that on top of the chicken . Then lay the stuffing on top and add cheese . Voilà!!! (;*~} happy I discovers such a delicious dish that can serve many and even have left overs !!

Delicious, despite being so simple! I poached my chicken tenderloins in spices and onion before dicing, and used stovetop cornbread stuffing:) I will be making this again, even my toddler ate his and he is the pickiest eater I know! ;)

I varied the recipe too. I added egg noddles to the bottom of the casserole, chopped up some fresh mushrooms and fried then added a can of Campbell's C of Mushroom to the mushrooms with a little chicken broth to thin & poured over the egg noodles. Then cooked cut up the chopped chicken breasts, added Campbell's C of chicken to chickn breast and thinned a little with chicken broth poured over the mushroom and noodles, added stove top stuffing, cheese and baked. Mmmmm, mmmm.

An excellent casserole that is very easy to make esp with leftover chicken.  I altered the recipe and used fresh green beans that I boiled for about 10 min and with bacon, salt & pepper and simmered them for a few minutes. I also minced a clove of garlic and sauted it in butter and added it to the chicken, bean & soup mixture.  I also added about 6 oz of sour cream to the mixture and 2 tbps of water which gave it more sauce/moisture.  Fabulous results!   My family has already asked me to make it again!  Txs for recipe.

This is good, filling, and quick and easy.  I threw in boiled leftover chicken I had in the freezer, and used herb flavored stuffing. It was a good, easy weeknight meal.

This was a great recipe, quick, easy and very tasty!!! I chose to partially cook the cubed chicken breasts in a skillet with a little butter, salt, pepper, garlic powder and poultry seasoning, then mixed it with the cream of chicken and beans, and mmmmmm good!!! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this without meat to go with a roasted turkey (easy herb roasted turkey from this site). I used the full 12 oz of stuffing with 20 oz of mixed frozen vegetables. It was a little heavy on the stuffing and I would probably use only 6 oz next time but if this was your only stuffing on the table, it would be OK. Very tasty, easy. I think I will use this recipe with leftover turkey next time and more veg as a type of turkey pot pie topped with stuffing instead of fat loaded pie crust.

The entire family loved this dish and have been asking for it again and again. It comes in handy with leftover roasted chicken. I did add chopped onion, a finely diced apple, 1/2 soup can of milk and a dash of lemon pepper seasoning. There were no leftovers! Thanks for a great recipe!

Quick, easy, and good. Followed recipe and added garlic powder & onion powder to chicken while cooking. Used chicken flavored stuffing. This fit into an 8x8 dish with room to spare. Used cut green beans (french get too soggy). Cooked a little longer than stated only to crisp up the edges a little; glad I did, those were the best parts. Made this several times now. **Update: I really like this and eat it for leftover lunch throughout the week. I have switched green beans for a basic frozen veggie blend (carrots, beans, corn, celery); I just throw the frozen veggies in and cook it like normal. GREAT!!

This was great. I used cranberry stove top, and the cranberries really added to it. My kids named it thanksgiving casserole. It would taste great with leftover Turkey too. You could easily double the recipe and still fit it in a single 9X13 dish too to feed more people. We'll definitely add this to our regulars.

Good recipe. Even though I seasoned the chicken, I added sauteed onions and garlic. I think it would pretty bland without it. Will make again.

I already had something like this but this inspired me to jazz it up.  I also added 1/2 cup milk, small can sliced mushrooms drained, and some Durkee FF onions.  I used cornbread stuffing mix.  It was really  good.  I used 3 grilled chicken breasts that were left over and chunked them up in the green bean/soup mixture.  Easy and quick.

Everyone absolutely LOVED it!  I did use cream of mushroom soup and a half can of milk because I thought it seemed a bit dry.  I also added a small can of carrots.  Very easy and fabulous!!!

Yummy quick cassarole. Didn't have any cream of chicken soup so I instead used about 1 1/2 cups of milk and two tbsp of chicken stock powder. I also mixed the cheese and stuffing into the recipe to hold it all together.

I made this two nights ago.  I thought it was very good.  My mother and my children loved it too.  They are 13, 11, and 4 and are very picky.  Especially the 4 year old so if she liked it, I know it was good.  The only thing was that I thought it was really "rich" tasting to just have by itself so I just made some mashed potatoes to go on the side to balance out the richness of the dish.  But all in all, I thought it was really good.  I will make it again.

I used fresh french green beans instead of canned, and it was wonderful.  It was simple and quick to make but yet turns out like you were slaving over a hot stove all day.  It makes a hearty meal and my daughter and husband were fighting over the leftovers the next day!

This was delicious -- I skipped the salt/pepper and the cheese, opted for the french fried onions instead.  What a hit!  The amazing thing is that my husband actually ate some of it the next day and the next and he VERY RARELY eats leftovers!  And what made it even easier was that I used canned chicken... will definitely be making this again!  (p.s. I planned on adding chicken broth to the stuffing, but I forgot and it turned out just fine -- nice and moist)  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband really enjoyed it...he loves stuffing; I personally found it to be bland and did not remind me of Thanksgiving at all.  It was OK....definitely NOT great.

Fantastic basic recipe that's infinitely customizable.  We substituted canned corn for canned green beans, added fresh carrots and green beans, a touch of white wine.

Not too bad for an easy and quick meal to have on hand. Needs some more flavor to it. I was out of a lot of stuff in the house so didn't even have onion to zest it up. I agree that the cheese on top isn't quite right. The French's onions would probably be better.

I thought this was really good.  I used low salt/no salt soup and green beans (2 cans) and a small can of corn.  Very yummy.

We thought this was great!  I had turkey flavored stuffing left over from thanksgiving so I used that.  I skipped the cheese and topped it with French's Fried Onion toppers, but I used the cheese flavored ones.  We really liked this.  It was not too salty at all.  Will definitely make this again!

This recipe wasn't bad but it didn't do anything for us either.  I won't be making it again.  I made it by the recipe and included the french fried onions on the top like the other reviews stated.  I kept some of the leftovers to try it again tomorrow, however it just doesn't beat a plain chicken casserole.  I think this recipe tries to include too many different types of ingredients.

Pretty good recipe.  This is a great way to get my husband to eat his green beans! I left out the cheese and it still tasted great.

Very good.  I put French's fried onions on top and omitted the cheese.  I just don't think cheese goes with this recipe.

This is a very quick, very tasty meal. My husband is still talking about it and even took leftovers with him to work and ate it two days in a row. I substituted peas for the green beans and it was just as good, if not better.

My whole family liked this one, even the 5 and 6 year olds.  I used two cans of green beans and made up my own dressing.  Delicious!
