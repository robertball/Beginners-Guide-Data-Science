It's the crust I want to rate/review.  I've been using this crust recipe for years as I'm not very good at making rolled crusts.  This is soooo easy and is very flaky.  If using it in an 8" inch pan, reserve some of the dough to crumble on the top of the filling--almost a double crust pie! The double baking time helps keep the bottom from getting soggy, even with juicy fruit pies!

I made it again (three pies in 2 days!) This time I left out the oil and halved the cinnamon plus baked it at at 425 degrees for 5 extra minutes before lowering the temperature. It was WAY better than the first attempt!! It still took longer to bake, though not nearly as long as the first pie! And I tried the crust this time- SO EASY AND YUMMY! I may never buy a premade crust again! :)

Adrienne can eat it with her current list of food intolerances and everyone said it was pretty good.  It took longer to cook than it said, though.

I used this recipe to make a large 12" inch pie and it was delicious. Even though I have good luck with rolled crusts, I tried the one in the recipe and was pleasantly surprised. For the 12" pie I one and a half times the crust ingredients and doubled the filling which was exactly the right proportions.  I used unsweetened almond milk which is what I had on hand and was thrilled at how unnoticable this change made to the taste of the pie (and really decreased the number of calories per serving--an added bonus).
I too would have had to cook this pie longer than stated even in a regular sized pan.  In my supersized pan (microwave safe) I cooked the pie for 6 minutes on high in the microwave--which is a great trick for lessening overall cooking time of pies if your pan is microwave safe.  I then cooked pie in oven @ 425° for 15 minutes and 350° for an hour.  Simply a perfect pumpkin pie.--Johanna

This pie is amazing! I chose this recipe because it is dairy free and because of the easy-sounding pie crust. I was a little worried because it just seemed too easy, but happily I was wrong. It turned out excellent, no one could tell it was any different than a traditional pumpkin pie, and it was the first thing to go at our Thanksgiving dinner. This is my new go-to recipe!

Very yummy. I had to bake it twice as long as called for, but otherwise everything was perfect. I thought it was much more flavorful after it had sat in the fridge for 24 hours. We will be making this again!

Ok I only made the filling & I love it..it is super yummy. I had been searching all over for an easy dairy free pumpkin pie & here it is. I used almond milk but followed the rest of the recipe. I wont ever need another pumpkin pie recipe. I used gluten free gingersnaps to make my own crust by the way.

This recipe was awesome!  Thank you 'BakesCakes' for the inspiration.  We are trying to omit as much dairy as possible and I needed to use up some pumpkin that I froze last Fall.  I made my own crust, but I am excited to try this version.  Working with pre-frozen pumpkin, I thought I'd need to make up for the extra water so I decreased the milk to only 1 cup.  For the rest of the filling, based on comments that it came out a little less "set" than the traditional recipe, I omitted the oil.  I also halved the cinnamon per reviewer comments.    And the kicker...I added a heaping tablespoon of cashew cream (raw, soaked, rinsed, the purreed with water) hoping it would give the recipe the 'fat' that was missing from the diary.  It baked at 425 for 20 mins, then 350 for 1 hour.  The result?  A perfectly set, firm pumpkin pie.  It is absolutely unnoticeable that it is any different from traditional pumpkin pie.  Thanks again 'BakesCakes.'

I used regular milk for both crust and filling. This was a delicious spicy surprise. My husband and I are not big fans of pumpkin pie, but I had to use up some pumpkin puree (from a fresh pumpkin btw). We both enjoyed and will be using this recipe again for leftover pumpkin! Thank you!

I'm in HEAVEN. Dairy-free? No need to substitute tofu to compensate? The crust turned out perfectly even with my clumsy hands, and the filling was so easy to make! I made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, and it'll be a staple for many years to come. Thank you so much! Easy... as... pie!

Ohhhhh SOOO good!  Everyone loved it.  I have found some different pumpkin pie recipes that are good, but not a traditional pumpkin pie.  This pie tastes just like a delicious traditional pumpkin pie.  I used my gluten free crust recipe so I am just reviewing the filling.  I used almond milk because that's what I had and I cut the ginger to 1/4 tsp because my husband doesn't like alot of ginger.  Thank you SOOO much for posting.  My search is over...LOVE IT!

I baked this pie for a get-together with my boyfriend's friends. My boyfriend can't eat gluten, corn, or milk, so pumpkin pie has been difficult for him. We only made a few adjustments, according to his dietary restrictions and other reviews on this recipe. We substituted cashew milk for rice milk (his preference) and decreased the amount of oil in the filling. We also substituted Red Mill gluten-free all-purpose flour for the crust, but made no other changes to the crust. As others have mentioned, we had to cook it a bit longer than the recipe suggests. This pie was so amazing! Everyone absolutely loved it! The pumpkin pie filling was just right, and I heard so many comments about the crust. This will be my go-to pumpkin pie from now on. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!

This is one of my favorite recipes! I started looking for vegan-ish pie recipes when my daughter started showing signs of lactose intolerance. This one is sheer perfection. I've found that my oven take about 75 minutes at 350* (+ the 10 minutes at 425*), so make sure to test the center before assuming it's done.

Tried the whole thing last night - Delicious!!!  I normally make my own crust, roll it out the whole thing, this one was so much easier and tasted great!  Everyone loved it!  Need to try to make it gluten free one of these times.

Very easy to make and I didn't change a thing! I only told the person that was lactose intolerant that this was lactose-free. Everyone loved it, especially the crust. Very flavorful. The only difference I could tell between this and the "traditional" pumpkin pie was that this was just slightly less firm. No one else noticed this, so I don't consider it a big deal. This one is a keeper--thanks for sharing!!

I thought this tasted really good. Did not use the crust recipe though, used another one.  I needed a dairy free filling, and this fit the bill.

Fantastic recipe!! Thank you!!! I made it straight from the directions the first time (used a store bought crust though because I was super short on time). The center didn't get quite done enough before my crust started to blacken slightly... so the second time I followed user tips and baked for 15min on 425 before lowering to 350 for an hour. I also omitted the oil on the second pie and substituted the extra 1/3 rice milk for 1/3 sweetened condensed coconut milk and wow-so delish!!

This recipe was awesome and my eldest said that it made him happy.  I used my own pie crust recipe and substituted soy milk for the rice milk.  Very good and will make again and again! :-)

I used a 9 inch pie pan but there was way too much filling for it. I probably could have made two pies out of it. The crust would not come together for me and did not make enough to fit my pie dish. Overall, I'm somewhat disappointed in this recipe. I might try it again with a bigger dish and a different crust recipe.

I absolutely love this pumpkin pie! I'm the only one in my family allegeric to dairy and with this pie, no one even notices it's dairy-free. It is so good I make it every Thanksgiving and Christmas! I do notice that I have to cook it longer but I think it's due to me living at a higher elevation. Regardless, the crust and filling is amazing! I even use this crust for other pies as well. Thank you for making my dairy-free life brighter!

Instead of rice milk, I used 2/3 cup coconut cream and it makes it much more rich and creamy. Less liquid too so it doesn’t have excess.

Absolutely no changes to the ingredients! this is a "killer pie" our daughter is dairy free and the entire family loved this! I did use a 9-10 inch pie plate and it worked great. People were saying it took longer to bake but no one gave suggestions. I did 15 minutes at 425 and 55 minutes at 350. Perfectly done.

I made this recipe exactly as is. Overall, it's very good. The filling tastes amazing, and I'm super happy that we now have an amazing pumpkin pie filling recipe that my dad, who's milk- and soy-intolerant, can eat. 

The crust, however, I found way too salty. 1 tsp is too much. If I make the crust again, I'm halving the salt. I think I'd rather use a rolled-crust recipe next time, instead.

Also, the pie definitely needed a longer cook time than what's listed here. I pretty much cooked it twice as long-- an extra 40 minutes.

Used almond milk because that's what I had on hand. Came out a bit sweet and took longer than the cooking time stated. Will reduce the amount of cinnamon, brown sugar and oil next time and increase the ginger a bit.

After 20 years of having to eat the apple pie at Thanksgiving, my daughter can finally have pumpkin pie!  And no one could tell that it was an "altered" version.  Thank you for your recipe!

I have kiddos with allergies as well so am always on the lookout for good dairy free recipes.  Pie came out beautifully and tasted really delicious.  I needed to bake it 15 minutes longer than the time, but I baked multiple pies at once, so maybe that affected the cooking time.  Got lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.  Will definitely be making again!  Thanks for the recipe :)

Used 1/4 cup coconut cream and 1 cup coconut milk (light) for the rice milk. Left out the oil. Used 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice instead of the ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. Baked for 20 minutes at 425 then 40 minutes at 350. Kept checking every ten minutes until utensil came out clean. Used a homemade gingersnap/graham cracker crust using coconut cream instead of butter to bind. One of the best pumpkin pies that I have ever had! Thank you!

Great Pie! Used all fresh spices and an alternative crust recipe! This was a hit at Thanksgiving. (Cooking time for me was approx 1.5 times the amount listed and I did use foil for about 30 mins around my decorative crust)

I had to make a gluten/dairy free pumpkin pie for my son's school. I made another one and it was terrible. I tried this the second time changing the all purpose flour to gluten free flour and using a little more than was called for. I also used Almond Milk instead of rice milk. I made the brown sugar with white sugar and molasses. It is so good that I will use this recipe instead of my regular recipe for our family gatherings. Excellent!

Used a store bought gluten free pie crust and used almond milk instead of rice milk and it turned out great! Took a little longer to cook but that’s ok! Definitely will make again.

Amazing! I've always done the premade pies or crusts before and just picked around the thick cardboard tasting crusts.  Never again! The flaky crust this recipe makes was my favorite part even though the pumpkin filling was also wonderful.  I used unsweetened soymilk and  made the crust using whole wheat flour.  I used oil in the crust,  but substituted cinnamon applesauce for the oil in the filling. Turned out absolutely delicious. Thank you for this great vegan-friendly recipe!

The crust is awesome, whatever you put in it. I substituted sesame oil for a meat pie, to add a little rich flavor, and used coconut oil the first time because I didn't have canola on hand. Both worked great, and I love the crust exactly as instructed, too.

I have made this pie three years in a row at Christmas for my brother in law who is severely lactose intolerant.  He’s from the south and says it’s the best pumpkin pie ever.  I will never make pie dough any other way always comes out flakey.

This pie is exactly what it says, Killer Pumpkin Pie. Have made it twice this way, the third time for Christmas, I pureed Pecans and used Almond milk. We are so thankful for this crust recipe, now no matter what we put in the pie, the crust is always perfect. My son shaped the dough to perfection with the high sides, he is a chef and did a great job even fluted the edges. Thank you so much for this, will always know a great pie is in store.

I have made this several times with whatever non dairy milk I have on hand. It is always very good. I use my own flaky pie crust though (the one from smitten kitchen with non-dairy margarine instead of butter)

Crust is a must!!  I actually only used the crust portion of this recipe BUT it was so good that I had to leave a review. I did use coconut oil and regular milk because it was what I had, and it was perfect. Really easy too. No reason to buy premade crust again.

Just made this pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving. I made it the night before & kept it in the fridge. For my first time making a pumpkin pie, I am SO pleased with how this came out!! I took the advice from other reviewers and halved the cinnamon, and omitted the oil in the pie mix. I cooked it for 1 hr 20 mins which was perfect. The pie turned out delicious, but the crust was a bit too salty, so I would halve the salt for the pie crust. Super happy otherwise. The first pumpkin pie I’ve been able to eat without getting a stomach ache!

This was perfect! It did take a long time to bake, but it probably didn't help that our cruise was pretty much frozen when we started it. I used almond milk instead and that worked well.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this didn't work for me at all. The filling was way too liquid and it never set -- it just bubbled away at a low boil for almost two hours until finally the top started to burn and I took it out. Even after chilling it never got any firmer than a soft pudding, and it was all lumpy because it had boiled. On the plus side, my daughter ate the filling with a spoon and said it tasted pretty good.

I used gluten-free pie crusts already made, and I used almond milk. I found that, with a little added pumpkin puree, this made two small pies. Very good!

I have made this pie 3,4 times now. Last night was the best! I used freshly made pumpkin purée , used dairy free half half in place for milk, delete the oil in the filling, added 1 tbsp cornstarch. even though I have made it in the past, but the house smelled amazing last night! Hubby said that was the best! Maybe it's because the fresh pumpkin purée or maybe it's the half half made the difference.  This is definitely my go to recipe for dairy free version. I'm breastfeeding and my baby is allergic to protein found in dairy so I am on dairy free diet. Thought I'd share my experience with friends here, hope it will be helpful to some of you. Thank you for the recipe! Love it.

I used a pre-made gluten free crust and only made the filling.  I used one of the previous review's suggestion and cooked it an extra 5 minutes before lowering the temp.  I also covered it after the time specified because it was browning up.  It tasted amazing!  Even my friends who can eat dairy loved it!

I made this tonight using oat milk instead of rice milk - and used about two cups of roasted pumpkin instead of canned.  took about 30-45 minutes longer to set in the oven (at least 90+ minutes total of cooking time).  Was truly the best dairy-free pie I have ever made - my family didn't even realize there was no dairy - even got compliments on the crust!  Will definitely make again - however I may have to either cook some liquid off the pumpkin or use less "milk" in the future.

Great recipe! I found that the ratio of crust to filling was a bit off but still great. Filling tastes amazing!! I went without the oil in the filling and it's a really nice consistency!

I cook dairy free!  This recipe was enjoyed by my whole family. I bought a premade Pillsbury pastry just for convenience.  This was quick to prepare and the oven did the rest.

Only made the filling and added it to a GF graham cracker crust. Used cashew milk instead and consistency was lovely. Next time I will omit the ginger and cloves as it ended up tasting more gingerbread-like; the pumpkin didn't shine through as well as I had hoped.  Baked in a convection oven at 400 degrees for 10 min, then reduced to 325 for an additional 30-35 minutes. Other reviewers said they needed to back for longer than directed, but I found the pie was set and the middle quivery using the above time frame.

This pie crust is amazing and I've made it at least five times, but somehow the proportions got messed up or the ingredient list got mixed up. Can someone please comment with crust ingredients???

Too sweet and not thick enough.  The cook time was way off (took FOREVER!). We prefer a thick creamy custardy pumpkin pie, so this recipe isnt for us. Might try to add an extra egg next time.

This pie turned out great! My son has been dairy free for years and said this is the best dairy free pumpkin pie he's had and we did a side by side comparison with the standard home cooked pumpkin pie and this one - they were amazingly close in taste! I couldn't find rice milk so used almond milk - came out great!

This pie is delicious, but it was more custard-y than like pie filling.  I followed the directions carefully and put a thermometer in the oven the second time around to make sure the temperature was correct.  Yet even after cooking an extra 20 minutes the center was still mushy.

I made this recipe.  It was absolutely delicious.  However, I used a ready made Gluten Free crust from "Longos".  I also substituted the pumpkin for a butternut squash.  I cut and roasted the squash, let it cool, then scooped out 2 cups and used that in the recipe.
Everyone loved the pie.  I will definitely make it again!

This is only for the filling; I used a different crust. The filling was as thick as regular pie filling. Dairy free is often runny. I used soy milk. When the pie was sliced, the filling didn't slide down over the bottom crust, but stayed perpendicular to it. It also had a great flavor. I will be making this again.

Great Pie!  Made because of multiple food allergies in my kids, but  my husband and mother in law (who are big pumpkin pie lovers and do not typically eat dairy substitutes) also thought it was delicious!

You did a great service by posting this recipe!  A last, a wonderful gluten and dairy free pumpkin pie that I could bring to my friends' house for Thanksgiving dessert - it was light and delicate, with great texture.  Though I was the only GF and dairy free one there (and was given the assignment to bring dessert), all enjoyed it. As other reviewers have noted, I was skeptical that this crust could really work.  Well it does, and is tender and flaky - one person even noted that it was a "homemade crust."  I followed the advice of another reviewer and cooked it for 20m at 425, then it did take quite awhile at 350 to finish.  Thank you.

Great recipe! I didn't have everything on hand--and honestly I was just trying to find a recipe without condensed milk. I used olive oil instead of canola, and instead of rice milk I used 1/2 cup cream and milk for the rest. 

Then...I thought I would experiment with the graham crackers I had on hand so I made a graham cracker crust from Allrecipes.The crust was delicious on its own, but I'll be the first one to say, while it was good, pumpkin pie should have pumpkin pie crust. The next time I make this recipe I'll try her crust. Nevertheless, the filling is simple and delicious!

The filling is delicious! However, I do not recommend making the crust gluten free. I used a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch and potato starch and it ended up somehow being chewy and crunchy and just sort of a mess.

This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever eaten, and I love that it is milk free for people with food allergies. I used plain almond milk instead of the rice milk. It has a perfect amount of spice, and is a great consistency. This is also a wonderful crust - so easy to make, and it was crisp on the bottom instead of soggy.
