Delicious!  I reduce the maple syrup to 1/4 cup and add 1/4 cup of Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown Sugar BBQ sauce for a little bit of smokiness.

This recipe was just.....ok.  It was a little on the sweet side.  If I make this again, I might use less maple syrup.  I also added one chopped onion to the mix.

I am supposed to give this 5 stars. Even though I made it for a night I had to work for the family. My BF loved it!!! And so did my kids (they can be hard to please) The kids even ate it all. So yes this is a keeper in my book! Instead of rolls I made home made bread in the bread  machine to put it onto.

This was delicious!  As other reviewers suggested, I cut the maple syrup down to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup bottled BBQ sauce (I used Stubbs).  I used 2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts but still used the full amount of sauce called for the ensure the chicken did not dry out.  I cooked mine on high and they were done in 3 1/2 hours.  I served this with whole wheat tortillas, shredded cheddar cheese and lettuce.  Thanks for the delicious and easy recipe!

Recipe worked well. Was sweet for a BBQ sauce if your interested in a more tangy spicy flavor.  I would try with a cheaper cut of meat such as a pork end or chicken thighs/legs.  The idea of braising meat in a crockpot such as this recipe usually allows for the fat of the meat to work into the flavors.

Very good recipe. My husband and 13 yr old son loved it. Had ingredients on hand and was very easy and good. Did cut back on the syrup due to other reviews stating was too sweet. Was worried that it would be to spicey with the pepper and hot sauce, but it was just perfect. Thank you for the recipe.

The sauce I didn't think have a real BBQ flavor. I ended up adding almost a bottle of Head Country BBQ sauce. The one thing i did like is how it gave it spice. I would make it again, it was still delicious.

AWESOME! This could not be easier to make. Perfect for days when you're going to be out most of the day. Just throw in the crock pot and forget about it for hours. The sauce is on the sweet side, which is great if you like it, but easy enough to cut back on the maple syrup if you don't. The chicken came out perfectly, not at all dry like I was concerned about. One of the best all around recipes I've tried in a while.

Great recipe!  I didn't even bother to thaw the chicken breasts, just threw them in frozen and they turned out great. I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the maple syrup to 1/4 cup, added a cup of bbq sauce and half an onion, sliced. I also added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch during the last hour of cooking to thicken up the sauce.

I wouldn't say this is what I think of when I think 'pulled bbq chicken' but it's still Really good!!  Like other reviewers, I change it up a bit -- I use 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of maple syrup and 1/4 cup bbq sauce (we like Sweet Baby Ray's).  I also add a small onion, a clove or two of garlic, and a bit of liquid smoke.
I'm not very patient so I usually end up cooking it on high for 3-4 hours instead of low for 6...it seems to work just fine.
Super easy and good leftover too -- actually maybe better after it has time to thicken a bit!

This was ok.  Not great, but ok.  I think we'd have been better off just throwing the meat in with BBQ sauce over it.  It needed more sauce as it dried out fast.

This was allright. Not the best BBQ I've had, but certainly acceptable for a weeknight meal. The sauce is star quality and not at all too sweet. It is probably one of the best I've had (not THE best, but very good). It was the texture that was off-putting to me. There is a fine line between perfectly cooked and overcooked (slow-cooked) chicken. I think 6 hours, even on low, is far too long to slow cook already tender chicken breasts. I'd like to try this again, but on a weekend so that my chicken cooks / sits in the crockpot for no longer than 4 hours (mine cooked for 6 and sat for 6). I really think this is why my chicken's texture was "off." Served on sesame kaiser rolls with sweet pickles, BBQ kettle chips and Mike's Hard Lemonade, this was a yummy meal. Thanks SHELDAWG! :-)

Fantastic! I love the sauce for this recipe and would even use it any time I need a quick bbq sauce. It's tangy and just a bit sweet and very zesty. I added a bit of cornstarch to the sauce just before serving in order to thicken it up a bit more, but otherwise changed nothing. We had it over brown rice, but it would be good topping for a baked potato as well. This is a versatile recipe that I know I'll be making again some time. Thank you.

The original is WAY too sweet. I thought it had potential though so I tried again with a finely chopped onion, only 2 Tbsp of maple syrup, 1 tsp chopped garlic instead of powder, and 1 tsp. Wright's Natural Hickory Seasoning. It was very good once it was tweaked but the 3-stars are for the original.

Being gluten-intolerant, of course, I skipped the buns but this is very good as a main dish.

Just had this for dinner tonight. Wow!! I used it for bbq chicken stuffed baked potatoes and topped it with sour cream, cheese, and chives. My husband and daughter loved it. I loved it because I threw it all in the crock pot, baked some potatoes, and it came out perfect. It took me about 5 minutes of prep time total.

This recipe is great as is. Everyone I have ever served it to loves it just as originally described. Don't get caught up in all the comments and start changing things. Just try it first! Putting in store bought BBQ sauce makes it something it's not intended to be. Serve on Kaiser Rolls with bread and butter pickles and you'll see what I mean.

Very sweet but so good!  I was worried about the maple syrup but it was delicious!!  It actually wasn't as spicy as I thought it was gonna be so we added some sliced serrano peppers on top as well as purple onion!  Served on an onion bun.  Thanks!

.The chicken was cooked perfectly, but the sauce was bland as bland can be.  I will use this method for cooking chicken BBQ again, but I will not use the sauce.  I had to put a ton of Tabasco on the sandwich to even get any flavor.  I ended up eating all the leftovers because my son and husband were not interested after the first time trying it.

This recipe is wonderful! I've made it several times and the chicken turns out perfect each time. I love the sweet and spice combination (although I double the cayenne amount, I like it more spicey). Thanks for this great recipe!!!

Dave, the high carb count isnt from 1/2 a chicken breast. You can easily reduce your carb by using some sugar free items for the maple syrup, brown sugar and ketchup.

Loved it and everyone that tried it loved it. I prep the night before and in the morning I popped it in the slow cooker and went to work, came home for dinner break and it was perfect! Took it to my man for his dinner and he had enough to share with a couple of his buddys and they loved it too, I did change it up a little, I use left over BBQ sauce that I had and then added everything else.

I made this for supper tonight and had a very hard time waiting for my husband to get home from work!!! I halved the maple syrup and added some smoked paprika and onion powder and it was just perfect! I served it over some grain-free biscuits. It was just the two of us and there is not much left over, it was so good. I will be making this often!

This is a really good recipe, It is a little spicy so when I made the second batch of BBQ sauce I added about 1/4-1/2 cup of brown sugar. It made a sweet and tangy sauce. Definitely needs to have some cornstarch to get it thickened as the sauce is a little thin otherwise. Overall, Very yummy and fantastic for a BBQ, or if you need to take something in for a Potluck dinner.

The sauce was easy to make and the chicken shredded nicely. However, it was overwhelmingly sweet. For next time I'll probably drop the maple syrup down to a tablespoon or two or just substitute a tablespoon or two of brown sugar.

Good stuff. Being from NC, I love vinegar based BBQ, so I greatly reduced the amount of ketchup and replaced it with cider vinegar.  I maintained the rest of the recipe because it looked so interesting—many more flavors added than I generally use, but they all blended together nicely. Keeping this recipe!!!!

This was wonderful.  I didn't have maple syrup on hand so I added 1 tablespoon of sugar as a substitute.  I will definintely make this again.

This was fabulous! Like others, I cut the maple syrup to 1/4 c. and added a 1/4 c. bbq sauce and a splash of liquid smoke. I was going to be out all day so I left it on low for around ten hours. I served it over rice and the kids loved it!

Made this the other night using chicken thighs instead of breasts. I also cut the maple syrup a little and added some cider vinegar. Came out just ok, I agree with others that say it needs a little "something" just can't put my finger on what it is. Might make again, was easy and had all ingredients on hand

Not happy with this.  Everyone said it was good, but I had to change the sauce at the end and do "my own thing".  I won't keep this recipe.  Sorry.

It was good.  I made a mistake and added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice instead of teaspoons.  My family liked it. My finicky son LOVED it. Made macaroni salad to go with it.  It needs something else, but I'm not competent in the kitchen to be able to say what.  Smokey BBQey something. I will make it again though.

I made this today for a family get together. It was easy and delicious. I started with half the maple syrup as others have suggested and, after tasting, decided to not add the additional 1/4 cup. I will definitely make this again!.

Made this for dinner tonight. Loved that I could control the heat as I don't like overly spicy food. Hubby forgot to turn it on at noon so I cooked it on high for 3.5 hours instead of low for 6 and turned out just fine. Will be making it again But maybe with a little creamy coleslaw on top next time.

So So good! I did make some slight changes due to what I had in my fridge. I used lite syrup(I think that might have helped with it not being too sweet) soy sauce instead of worshtishire,lime juice instead of lemon. Lastly half Dijon mustard/yellow mustard. It was perfectly balanced. Not too sweet, a good amount of heat and tang. We will definetly use this recipe again with the variations !!

This was simply delicious. I did make a suggested change because of the amount of reviews stating how sweet the sauce was even after cutting the syrup down to 1/4 cup. So I only added a pinch of syrup. You could prob. cut the syrup out altogether but the sauce was just right....not too sweet, not too tangy. (although I really like tang.) I also added about 1/2 a chopped onion to the sauce. Also, it came apart in the crockpot so easily. The recipe came out wonderful. A definite keeper!

I probably had this on low for about 8 hours or so . . .I put it together with frozen chicken breasts the night before, kept it all in the crock in the fridge, and had my husband put it in the slow cooker this morning, then switched it to warm and shredded the chicken in the crock when I got home.  I tasted it and thought it needed something, but figured I'd wait for the bbq lover (AKA my husband) to taste it and see if he thought it needed anything.  He thought it was good as is, so I left it alone.  While mixing the sauce, I did double the sauce itself, halve the maple syrup, and added garlic powder and liquid smoke (probably about 3 tablespoons of the liquid smoke--no, I didn't mean to add that much, but it seems to have worked).  I served it on Hawaiian rolls with cheese and hubs enjoyed it.  This did have what seemed to me a lot of leftovers, but I'm giving some to a friend to try and we'll put the rest over baked potatoes sometime this week.  I liked that this didn't use bottled bbq sauce as well--a great recipe when I'm out of it in the house and don't feel like picking up any.  I also think cooking in the slow cooker makes the sauce a bit runny, but after shredding the chicken I thought it mixed together just fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

We love this and have it at least twice a month!  Only a few minor changes:  cut the maple syrup to 1/4 cup and add 1/4 BBQ sauce, and for the last 1/2 hour, after the chicken is shredded, switch to cooking on high.  This will thicken up the sauce so it won't come running out of your bun or tortilla.

We have enjoyed this several times now.  We use a little less maple syrup and also add some low-salt chicken broth so that it doesn't dry up in the slow cooker.  Super delicious and would be good with coleslaw on the bun like pulled pork!  I prefer this to pulled pork any day!

I'm sorry for being one of those guys that alters a recipe and then rates the original...busted.  OK, so I used three giant breasts, plus they fit in the big cooker (not my puny one). I used NO SALT ketchup, Reduced salt Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mixed with yellow mustard, a splash of white wine, Some diced Garlic and sliced red onion also. Added a cup of TJ's BBQ sauce (doesn't use HFCS). I did use about 1/8 cup sugar free maple syrup as well (I need to get some organic maple syrup from TJ's for next time). The seasonings and hot sauce DO add some zing to it. Probably good as written, better for ME the ways I altered it.

I gave it only 4 stars because I made some adjustments. Instead of using syrup I used a 1/4 C brown sugar. I did not have any Chili powder or Cayenne pepper. I used a little more than two dashes of Hot sauce to make up for the missing ingredients. 

I put this in the crockpot on high for 3 1/2 hours, which was about a twenty minutes to a half hour too long on high because the edges started burning. However, what I was able to salvage, which was a rather large part of it, was delicious! 

This is a keeper for me.

It was just "okay" but I think with work and a few simple changes, it could turn out better. I used Jack Daniels Hickory Brown Sugar BBQ Sauce and a 1/2 a cup of lite syrup...maybe that's where my sauce went wrong..My son loved it.

Made this to have yummy sandwiches on hand while wine tasting and it was such a hit! Spooned the goopey-BBQey-goodness into torta rolls while still hot and then wrapped in tin foil. After about 2hrs of wine tasting busted the sandwiches out and have to say, everyone was very satisfied. I wanted to give it 3.5 stars because it was really really good but I think next time around I may just nix the maple syrup all together and use a couple tablespoons of honey instead. The sauce was a little bland for me but I think after dressing it up a bit this will be bomb-dot-com.

I liked this recipe, but my husband thought it was just ok.  I would make it again, but would maybe change up the sauce a little bit so hopefully my husband would get on board.  It was definitely an easy recipe which is very nice to have sometimes.

I haven't fixed this recipe as is, but I do make a similar one.  We add onion, butter and vinegar.  We also use a whole chicken and boil it for 30 minutes to reduce the fat it the slow cooker.  We eat it as is the first night and pick out the bones.  Once it is cooled, I sift out the bones and freeze the leftovers for sandwiches another night.  Thought this might help people who thought it was to sweet or runny. (Plus, I happen to like seeing peoples changes.  They help me adjust recipes to my families tastes.)

I loved the flavor of this! Ours turned out tangy, so we were caught a little off guard but it really was delicious. Next time I won't cook the chicken as long.

This turned out really good! I was unsure if it would be too runny but as soon as you shred the chicken, it soaks it right up.

I cut back a bit on the ketchup and syrup.  At the end of the cooking period I added in some bbq sauce.  It turned out great!

I subbed 1/4 c of brown sugar for the maple syrup and a small handful of crushed red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne and hot sauce (due to what I had on hand). It was so delicious! I didn't see the cook's note about making another batch of sauce to put on at the end, but I would definitely recommend it if you want it saucy.

I'm calling this one good, not great, though my wife rated it an 8 on a 1-10 scale and my son enjoyed it too. At any rate, it was a good way to use up some of the boneless, skinless chicken breasts I bought in bulk from Costco.

I used a couple of bread and butter pickles and a splash of mustard on mine. We had everything on hand except the maple syrup, so I substituted a little brown sugar.

Do note that adding the additional helping of sauce at the end (before cooking for an additional 30 minutes) is almost mandatory. Without it, I'm sure--even with the shredding--that the chicken would have been too dry.

Great recipe! Ended up cutting maple syrup in half and doing other half with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Cooked on low for about 7/8 hours since we had dinner later tonight but the chicken just fell apart and Tate's so good! Paired it with another recipe on here for "sweet cornbread muffins" and also made a recipe on here for "Maine pumpkin bread" as dessert. My family enjoyed this taste and I enjoyed how easy it was to make :)

I didn't have a full amount of maple syrup so I subbed bbq sauce for it. I used actual garlic instead of garlic powder. I would probably not make this again, unless I drastically alter it to get rid of the super sweetness. Honestly I think just dumping a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's in a crockpot with some chicken would taste better. This was just ok, but not great. My daughter wouldn't eat it though, said it was too sweet and tasted too much like ketchup. I would agree with her on that.

I love this recipe, it's easy and tasty. I did make some changes, only because I don't like hot stuff. So I will put some hot sauce and cayenne pepper on the table for others to add to their liking. I also just added store  BBQ sauce I had on hand after shredding the chicken, then let it simmer for a bit. I could have eaten it before adding the extra sauce, it is fantastic.

Loved the taste and the simplicity of this recipe.  I didn't have any maple syrup so I substituted 1/2 c Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory Smoked sauce and 1/4 c brown sugar.   Next time I'll make sure I have maple syrup so I can try it that way too.  I also made the extra batch of sauce as suggested by Cook Sheldawg and glad I did.  I cooked this on low for about 5 hours - I'm guessing it was probably done by 4 1/2 hours because my crock is pretty hot.  I'll test it earlier next time.  Thanks!!

This turned out great! Hubby and I are eating clean now, so I don't use bottled barbecue sauce any more.  I used honey in place of the maple syrup, and it worked well. The kids really liked it, too.

I made this for July 4th and my family raved about the BBQ sauce.  Followed the recipe exactly except cut back on the spices as my 90-year-old mother can't tolerate too much spiciness.  Will make again!

This was fabulous! Chicken so tender and tasty...much better than bottled barbeque sauces. I just added some liquid smoke, to give it that grilled flavor. I will make this again and again!

I only had 3 chicken breasts, so I adjusted some ingredients.  I used 3/4 cup catsup, 2 tbsp. Dijon mustard, 1 1/2 tsp lime juice--I didn't have lemon juice & substitute references said use a little less if substituting with lime juice.  Used little less than 1/2 cup maple syrup, used 1 1/2 tsp Worchestershire sauce and added 1/2 cup frozen chopped onions and remaining ingredients as listed.  I only had a couple flour tortillas to serve them in and it was great!  My husband is a very picky eater & he really liked it.  I will be making this many times in the future.

This is so easy and so delicious. I used 3 breasts and cooked on high for 3 hours and then shredded the chicken and cooked on low for another hour or so. I also used a little over a 1/4 cup maple syrup and added 1 Tablespoon corn starch to thicken. I will definitely make this again.

Based on other reviews, I cut the maple syrup in half and it came out wonderful. Definitely would have been too sweet if I used the full 1/2 cup as in the recipe. Overall very good.

Followed others and added 1/4 cup Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and lessened the maple syrup to 1/4 cup.  Also added 1/2 cup finely diced onion.  Great advice to spread and leave to cook another 1/2hr.

Very delicious and easy to make. I also followed someone's suggestion and cut the syrup to 1/4 cup. I wish I had made more sauce, wasn't quite juicy enough. We had BBQ sauce on the side.

My whole family loves this recipe. My husband and kids enjoy it on a bun, but I like it on its own with coleslaw or Texas caviar. I'm not much of a planner, so I usually prepare it with frozen chicken breasts and it comes out perfect.

Absolutely amazing. I forgot to include the maple syrup, but I used very sweet hot sauce. Great the next day too!

This was delicious. I too added 1 cup of bbq sauce to offset the sweetness, and turned it up to high. It was done in just over 3 hours. It's not a tough cut of meat to begin with, so it doesn't really need all that time to simmer.

I could not follow this recipe to a T, because I did not have enough maple syrup. I added a little bit of brown sugar and some store bought sweet barbecue sauce. The main thing I did not like about this recipe is that it tasted way too salty for me... Still fairly good, but I will look for another similar recipe to tweak.

This recipe is delicious. I made some adjustments to the sauce. I took out the chili powder and cayenne pepper because I prefer sweet bbq sauce over spicy. In order to give the sauce a sweet taste, I added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I also added a dash of salt and pepper. After 6 hours on low in the slow cooker, the chicken fell apart so easily and it was perfect on a fresh sandwich roll. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

My husband made this. Everyone really liked it. Instead of the maple syrup he used 1/4c. Honey & 1/4c. Bbq sauce. It's got excellent flavor as it was or it could easily be spiced up.

I wanted to make some BBQ sauce and had all the ingredients shown in this recipe on hand.  It was great!  We didn't mind the sweetness of the maple syrup at all.  I shredded a rotisserie chicken and reheated it in a saucepan with the BBQ sauce for about 45 minutes.  Served on slider buns with coleslaw on top and a side of baked beans.  Great meal!

I made this for a recent party.  I halved the maple syrup but still found the sauce not what I enjoy to call a "BBQ" sauce.  It was okay...and the chicken was very moist, but I think I will keep looking.  Thank you anyways.

Absolutely delicious! I reduced the maple syrup to 1/4 c, omitted the cayenne pepper, added a few more dashes of hot sauce and out came the best tangiest bbq sauce ever! I served in hard taco shells topped with melted cheddar cheese. My fiance keeps asking when I am going to make it again! Thank you for the recipe :)

Loved this recipe and did not change anything. I did make an extra batch of bbq sauce and served it on the side. I also made the sweet restaurant slaw recipe and  some of us put that on the sandwich as well. Delish!!!

My husband loved it!  The chicken shredded so easily and was tender and delicious!  Tweaking of the ingredients in the sauce is a snap.  It is a sweeter sauce but you could lessen and swap out ingredients as others have suggested.

Excellent alternative to regular BBQ out of a bottle, much lighter and ours was juicy & moist. I did reduce the syrup to 1/4 cup as others recommended, that goes without saying for my family since we prefer savory with a kick of heat. I prepared just over 3lbs of chicken tenders and increased sauce by an additional half and used one full onion. My measurements were liberal in the season salts as we do like a little heat and it was a perfect subtle after heat flavor.

This was absolutely amazing!!! It was so juicy, tender, and the flavor was seriously a part of the chicken. It wasn't like chicken and you added sauce on top, the chicken WAS the sauce. It was amaaaazing. Seriously. Try it. You will LOVE it.

Great flavor...I used Gouldens for the mustard, and a locally produced Chipotle hot sauce. But this was the first time I tried this recipe, and if my results are typical, it should be called "Slow Cooker BBQ Chicken Soup". The resultant "sauce" was entirely too watery...not thick like good BBQ sauce should be. This recipe will be a good jumping off point for the next time.

Very good. The chicken shredded easily at the end of six hours, the sauce was as good as store bought although I did add some just to stretch it out a bit. Worth every one of the five stars.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and my family loved it! My husband though it was a little sweet, so next ti e I am going th cut the map,e syrup in half. Also, after I shredded the chicken I halved the sauce ingredients and added it to the crockpot. It gave it just a bit more sauce but not too much. Definitely a keeper!

Excellent recipe.  As others suggested, I used only 1/4 maple syrup.  I didn't need to make a second batch of sauce at the end as some people did.  My chicken breasts were frozen and quite flat, so I had plenty of sauce in the crock at the 6 hour mark.  This was a big hit with the family! Next time I'll try using 6 frozen chicken breasts, since mine were so flat to start.

Just wanted to say that this is absolutely delicious!! I didn't have any bottled bbq sauce so I made my own. I did't have any bottled Italian dressing either, so I made the good seasons Italian dressing. I was a little worried about adding more brown sugar because my bbq sauce already had it in it and worcestershire sauce also, but I followed the recipe exactly and I also shredded the chicken and put it back in and let it cook for another hour or so and it was awesome! Thanks for a great recipe and I made Belles hamburger buns to put it on. Yum! I made macaroni salad and baked beans with this as sides. Very good!

Turned out well. My husband loved it. Will probably have to cut the sweetness for the kids to eat.

I served this to nearly 20 people tonight.  I think the servings are off a bit because it barely fed everyone.  (changed servings to 24)  People commented overall that it was good but was a little on the sweet side and that the maple syrup was easy to taste.  I left out cayenne pepper and hot sauce, as we were going to serve it to children but then they ate hot dogs!  I think next time I'll had those spices to give it more of a zing.  Also, this was very saucy, more than sloppy Joes.  Overall a good, easy recipe.

This was good! I did as the others said and only used1/4c of syrup and added 1/4c bbq sauce. We had leftovers and it was even better the second day. Easy, great summer recipe!

Great recipe!  I served on rolls with pickles.

The leftovers were too sweet... if you don't eat it all, store the meat and sauce separately.

This was so easy and delicious.  I omitted the hot sauce and cooked on high for 4 hours after returned to the crockpot for 45 minutes on low after shredding the chickin.  Everyone loved it and I will absolutely make this again.

Delish!  I followed suggestions and reduced maple syrup.  I also used tablespoon of minced garlic instead of powder and used Trader Joes KC BBQ sauce.  Put on a hoagie roll with sliced dill pickle... So yummy!

This was fantastic! Made exactly according to the recipe, piled onto big, crusty kaiser rolls plus fries and coleslaw.  Soooooo much better than that stuff in those plastic tubs.  Ding-Ding-Ding---Keeper!!!

I thought the overall recipe was okay.  Because of my 3 year old, I cut out most of the spicy elements and only used the cayenne pepper. Also- I used bone in thighs and legs, which made the yummiest bones to gnaw at after the meat was all gone.  Over all the recipe was ok- I agree with some of the other reviewers that something was missing.  Not sure I'll do this one again.

I used boneless thighs and it was yummy! The video suggests making a second batch of sauce but I’m glad I didn’t. One batch was enough! We ate it on rolls the first night (4 adult portions) and over rice the second night (2 generous portions). Also, I used the cheep syrup I had on hand instead of buying real maple syrup. We still liked the results.

Nice and easy for busy evenings. I only used 2 tablespoons of maple syrup and served mine with rice, steamed green beans and salad. My boyfriend said this is the only way he wants to eat chicken breast from now on!

We all really liked this! We used boneless chicken breasts. I took the suggestions and cut the maple syrup back to 1/4 c. I also added some liquid smoke. After shredding the chicken, I added it back to the slow cooker and mixed in some bottled barbeque sauce. Super easy!

It was a little sweet, but overall, it tasted great! Similar to other reviewers, the next time, I will go easier on the maple syrup. This is a keeper though.

Loved this! I put it on tortillas and made chicken tacos and loved it. I think it would've been a little bit better with naan bread and/or rice to soak up the sauce better though. The flavours were awesome though! Not too spicy

This was a really easy recipe and very tasty. Next time, I’m going to try using real maple syrup, but even with bottled syrup it was good. 

For myself, I would add more cayenne and hot pepper sauce. But the spice was just right for my kid.

Very tasty!  I followed other reviewers suggestions and replaced the maple syrup with 1/4 cup light brown sugar and 1/4 cup Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  I used 2 T of regular, prepared yellow mustard and that was fine.  (I was not sure if the recipe was calling for ground/powdered mustard or prepared mustard.)  I also sliced up 1/2 a large onion and spread the slices over the chicken, but under the sauce.  I used 2 - 1# each chicken breasts.  Cooked everything in the slow cooker for 6 hours, pulled the chicken, and left it in the slow cooker for another 30 minutes.  It was perfect.  Everyone in the family loved this.  I will definitely be making this again.  So easy for a weeknight meal!

Double the sauce and keep some on the side to use later.  The sauce in the slow cooker is really thin and I felt it didn't keep flavor on the chicken. 
Regardless, it's a great recipe for parties! I have been asked for the recipe now several times. Always send them straight to this link :)

My family LOVED this and it was so easy to make. I cut it down to 1/4c maple syrup and added 1/4c bbq sauce (I used Diana’s Honey BBQ). I used half the amount of chicken (2 large chicken breasts cut in half), but made the full amount of sauce. Using half the sauce, cooked for 5hrs on low, added the rest of the sauce, cooked on low for another 30mins. Shredded the chicken and served on toasted kaisers with grated old cheddar and thinly sliced avocado. So delish!

My whole family liked it. Even my dad and he is a picky eater. I followed one of the reviews where they first added only half of the maple syrup then did a taste test to see if they wanted to add the other half. It didn't need the other half. Was perfect. Thanks for sharing.

. I only used 2 teaspoons of maple syrup and it was not too sweet. I also used one teaspoon of fresh garlic. Really good dish!

This was really good! I have to double any recipe because of my family of 6. I doubles the seasoning, but next time I’ll triple it to give it a little more flavor. Slightly bland.

Excellent!! This smelled amazing while it was cooking!!On a busy day I texted the recipe to my husband for him to start. I reduced the maple syrup and chili powder by half thinking it would be to spicy for the LO. Delicious! Easy to make, flavorful and reducing the maple syrup to 1/4 cup was perfect balance of sweetness.  I served this with cole slaw.

Easy and delicious!! Yes is sweet, but not too sweet. (Maybe ppl that didn’t like it used pancake syrup instead of real maple syrup?) I measured heavy on the seasonings to make it spicier. And even then the spice was mild, which I like. Made with chicken breasts. Totally worth trying!!!

I thought it was best the next day heated up. I'm pretty sure I followed the recipe exactly, but my chicken was a little tough and instead of a thick BBQ sauce, the chicken was really just sitting in a thin sweet sauce. Would try a different recipe next time.

After reading some of the reviews, I was a little hesitant to put that much maple syrup into the recipe, as I typically prefer tangy to sweet. However my daughter doesn't like tangy or spicy, so I went ahead and gave it a try.
SO GLAD I DID!! 
I'm not sure why some reviewers said this doesn't taste like barbecue sauce. It's much more authentic tasting than majority of your name brand bottles, and was absolutely delicious! I have already made it twice, and swear I could live off of this stuff if it wasn't so expensive to make (using organic maple syrup, etc).
I did add onion powder to my sauce, and a dash of chipotle powder to give my sauce a bit of a smoky hint to it, but aside from that the only changes I made were cooking it for 5 1/2 hours the second time made, and I made a little more sauce. There is no need to double it, but make about a 1.5 batch, and that's just perfect!  =)
Thank you so much for the awesome recipe!

Followed recipe.  Turned out ok, 2 of 4 family members really liked it, one thought it was pretty good, and one thumbs down.  For a crockpot recipe it’s pretty involved.  Probably won’t make it again.

Fantastically delicious! I made it in a pressure cooker. We did 2 hours on the slow cooker setting and then shredded the chicken added in the double sauce and cooked for another half hour and it was so good! Making it tonight for easy  Christmas Eve meal.

The kids loved this. I more than doubled it and I'm glad I did so we had leftovers for lunch. I didn't have the time so I cooked it on high for 2 hours and low for 1 hour and it turned out great. I did not add all the maple syrup and used some bbq sauce instead.  I also didn't serve it on buns but I will do that next time.

This is a great recipe!  I did modify it a bit by adding a sliced sweet onion.  I also used 1/4 cup maple syrup and 1/4 cup bbq sauce (instead of the 1/2 cup maple syrup) and added a dash of liquid smoke!  This recipe has become a favorite "go to" for a simple, casual meal that doesn't cause me to be in the kitchen forever whenever friends or family come visit!

I love  this. Its easy to do. Not a lot of clean up involved. I will make it just a little hotter by adding some more tabasco then suggested but that's because we like a little heat. This has definitely made its way into my recipe binder. Its a great summer dish.

Very good. When You take the chicken out to shred it, add a mixture of three tablespoons of cornstarch and three tablespoons of water. Thickens the sauce up nicely.

I served this last night after a long day of moving.  Everybody really enjoyed it.  I used 6 chicken breasts and doubled the sauce.  Served it on slider buns. I did take the recommendation of others and cut the maple syrup in half, otherwise followed as is.  Delicious!

This is the first time I made this. I followed the recipe but I Doubled the recipe and added a 1/2 cup of brown sugar into the barbeque sauce.  The thing I did differently was that I had some frozen bone-in chicken leg quarters with the skin on which I thawed.overnight.  After being thawed, I then pulled off the skin, cut the leg from the thigh quarter with a butcher knife, and placed the legs in one Dutch Oven and the thigh quarters in another dutch oven and turn the stove top dial between three to three and a half and cook or 3 hours.

Tip:
For those of you with stove top dials that have the Low, Medium, Medium High, and High,  I recommend setting the dial anywhere  between low and medium.

For those of you with stove top dials that have the numbers on them, I recommend setting the dial between three to three and a half.

Trick: Is having the water boil, ever so slightly, that you want the chicken to cook in hot water but not to over boil the chicken.  You just want it to simmer in the hot water for 3 hours.

Once all cooked, turn off stove top,  take out the thighs and place on cutting board to cool for a few minutes until you can handle the chicken with your hands.  Then with your hands start pulling the chicken off the bone and throw away all scraps into a plastic Walmart bag to be taken outside later., ( Tip: Don't throw any chicken scraps into your garbage  or garbage disposal as it will smell later). Do the remaining chicken thighs.  Do the same thing with all the chi

This is my second time making this recipe. As many suggested, I used half the amount of syrup and replaced the other half with BBQ sauce. I put about 1/2 tsp hot sauce instead of the cayenne pepper. It was still on the sweet side but delicious!

I halved the recipe since it was just for the two of us. I didn't have enough ketchup, so I used more barbecue sauce in its place. I also forewent the maple syrup, and added more hot sauce because I like barbecue sauce a little more tangy and hot. The chicken came out delicious! Perfect for shredded chicken sandwiches. Four stars only because I wish there was more sauce in the crockpot when the cooking was done. Maybe the ketchup would have left more. I found myself having to add more jarred barbecue sauce to the sandwich.

Substituted some maple syrup (I used less than half of what was stated in the recipe) for BBQ sauce as I don't particularly have a sweet tooth. Also added a lot more hot sauce than described. Cooked for 4 hours on high, shredded the chicken, then left for another half an hour on high - simply due to time constraints. Also used tortilla wraps instead! Great recipe overall, only tweaks were down to personal preference.

So easy to make and so good! I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce so I subbed soy sauce. By using ketchup with no fructose this has to be healthier than using store-bought BBQ sauce that's loaded with sugar. And it still has a sweet yet tangy flavor.

super easy and made out of what I had in the kitchen! I did take the suggestions of cutting the syrup in half and adding a cup of bbq sauce.  I also added a tablespoon of corn starch to thicken the sauce towards the end. the family LOVED it!  definitely will make this one again... plenty of leftovers to!

Really good recipe. My parents and even one year old loved it; leaving the entire crockpot nearly empty with no leftovers. To kick it up a notch I added  garlic cloves, Apple cider vinegar, brown sugar and  ghiradelli  unsweetened cocoa powder .   I wouldn't be able to give measurements because I did it by taste.   It definitely added a great flavor to this recipe.  It's easy to pull  the chicken apart  and if you really want to: mix cheese like gruyere or cheddar , for more  of a yummy flavor.

So easy and so good!  BF made himself one and then went back and made a 2nd because it was so good.  I did cut the maple syrup in half as suggested.  I cooked on high for 2.5 hours, then shredded and cooked another 30 minutes.  I'd probably try 2 hours next time as I think the chicken was a little overcooked.  3 breasts for the amount of sauce seemed to work out perfectly.

My family really liked this. I left out the chili powder, cayenne, etc because we are big wimps and used sugar free syrup to cut the sugar content but it was still in high demand for lunch leftovers!

I'm giving this 4 stars ONLY because I made changes based on reading other reviews. I added a LOT more spice. I cut the maple syrup back by half and subbed regular BBQ sauce to get some smokey flavor. I also doubled the mustard, cayenne and hot sauce, added 1/4 tsp pepper and subbed red wine vinegar for the worcestershire sauce. I loved the spicy, tangy sauce, and the sandwiches were delicious! Plus, with the slow cooker, I can make this the night before.  WINNER!

I absolutely loved this! The chicken came out perfectly cooked. I used three late chicken breasts and instead of the syrup I used a small amount of brown sugar. Still a bit sweet tasting, but delicious none the less. Even used leftovers for nachos!

This was really good. The chicken was a little dry, but I confess to cooking on high for 2 hours, then turning it to low for another 2+ hours, so this might have been the reason. However we were able to use the yummy sauce to dunk the chicken pieces in. We all enjoyed it.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It came out tasty and wasn't hard to make at all! I accidentally substituted chicken thighs and it was fine. The only thing was the suggestion that  you make more sauce and add it at the last 30 minutes--mine was already so liquid that I didn't want to add more. So now I have some extra sauce.

Good, easy recipe. I used honey instead of maple syrup. I found the sauce a little too sweet for my liking, so when I made the second batch as suggested by the recipe, I used more of the Worcestershire sauce and the spicy ingredients. Put the two batches together and the sauce was just right!

Really good.  As suggested by others, I reduced the maple syrup to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of bottled BBQ sauce.  Served over good sandwich rolls for super bowl.

I was so pleased with this recipe. I cut the recipe in half and used 1.23 lb. of boneless chicken breast. The rest of the recipe I kept the same with no changes. I cooked it on high in my slow cooker because I started late. I don't know how long it took to cook because when we got back from the garden store it was cooked! The chicken was moist. It was a little sweet and a little spicy. Just right for us. I am very glad to have found this recipe. Thank you!

This is a great Saturday night option.  I would reduce the amount of maple syrup unless you like a very sweet bbq sauce.  I would like to try this on with pork as well.  Crispy buns work best.

Loved this recipe! The BBQ sauce is sweet, just how I like it. To save time, sometimes, I will buy a bottled sauce instead of the homemade kind. You need to use two bottles for this one for the initial cooking, then the second for the extra 30 minutes. It really is wonderful! My husband loved it and I'm making it for my in-laws tonight!

It was pretty good, but I ended up changing the recipe a lot.  Some of the ingredients I just didn't have on hand and left out and in stead of Cayenne Pepper I used Chili Powder and I added cinnamon. Over all my family really enjoyed it though.

I made this as my first ever slow cooker dish! I added mixed fresh vegetables for the last 30 minutes and served it on a bed of rice. Scrumptious ?? 040216EC

I really enjoy this recipe, although as a disclaimer I've never made it with chicken. I have used pork which turned out great. More recently I have been using 2 cans of young green jackfruit in brine, rinsed, in place of the meat which works really well. I cook it the same way as the meat and it shreds almost identical to pork. As suggested by other reviewers I used 1/4 cup maple syrup and 1/4 cup barbecue sauce instead of 1/2 cup of maple syrup.

I saw many reviews recommending to cut they syrup in half and add bbq, so I did. And still, it was very underwhelming. It smelled fabulous the whole time when it was cooking, but it tasted very weak. The remedy was more bbq sauce.

I thought this was pretty bland, even with the variety of ingredients and spices. Maybe I should have upped the amounts of the spices and cut back on the syrup?

I didn't have any maple syrup, so i substituted brown sugar instead. I also did not use any lemon juice but it turned out great! I could barely stop myself from eating it before my family got home!

As many reviewers said, this is a very sweet recipe.  I even halved the amount of syrup and substituted the other half with spicy bbq sauce.  We prefer more spice in our BBQ, but if you like sweet this was very good.

This is wonderful.  Now I'm from pig picking Onslow County and my favorite way of serving it is put it on a plate with a huge pile of  coleslaw, fries and hush puppies.  LOL  and for those who dislike the vinegar smell.  It's a crockpot.  Just plug it in out in the garage and shut the house door. Or outside on a side table.  Think I'll take the suggestion and try chicken this way.  I was so tired of the places in California listing Authentic N. C. BBQ and then here comes a gloppy mess soaked in Sweet Hickory BBQ sauce.  Finally a way to recapture the real thing.

Very tasty recipe.  I used chicken and doubled the sauce recipe per the 'Cooks Note'.  Like others, I substituted half the maple syrup with bottled BBQ sauce.  I'll definitely make this again - maybe pork next time.

Some of the ingredients I did not measure accurately but it was wonderful. I did not make mine so spicy and plan on trying some things like different mustards.

I made this according to the recipe except for the hot sauce and cayenne to make it more kid friendly. It pleased a wide variety of eaters the first time we tried it. You don't need to make the second batch of sauce as it recommends. One is plenty. Also only cooked for 5 hours then 30 minutes more. It was great.

I didnt change the original recipe except to add some chopped garlic and some dried onions and I didnt add the hot sauce.  I used partially thawed chicken breasts.
Very tasty and tender and plenty of sauce.  I didnt need to thicken it at all.

Great recipe.  I did follow other reviews and cut back on the maple syrup and added in some bottled BBQ sauce.  I also used a mixture of chicken thighs and breasts.  My husband and son loved it!!

This is the first time of me making this recipe for my family they really enjoyed it they were skeptical but it came out good I tweaked the sweetness to our own taste I used 1/4  cup of sweet baby rays instead of syrup then the last hour I put a table spoon of corn mill in to thicken the sauce paired with a sweet coleslaw half cabbage head , lil bit diced onions , cap full of vinegar ,cup of mayo , squirt of mustard and sugar to taste.  excellent sandwiches !

Will definitley make this again. Great flavour. Cooked on high for 4 hours, pulled apart with two forks (which is very easy), then put back in crock pot for another hour. Make sure to scoop out with a spoon that has a drainer on it because the gravy made some of the buns too soggy.

Pretty much followed the recipe as is - only thing I adjusted was the maple syrup (only used 1/2 of what the recipe called for as I didn't want it to be too sweet) and it was ready after just the 6 hours.  It came out sooooo good!  Have given the recipe to 2 co-workers and they are making it this weekend!  Will def be making this again & again & again & again........lol

I made it as the recipe said, without making the extra sauce.  It turned out very good.  Eating with some Cole slaw on the side or right on top was a great compliment to the sandwich.  I'll make it again and again.

I haven't made this recipe only because I'm not much of a bbq sauce person but I do have experience with all types of cooking. In my experience whether you make or buy bbq sauce more often than not it's going to have some level of sweet to it. Whether it has actual sugar, fruit juices, ketchup, or some other ingredient. If there isn't then it probably didn't come from the U.S.. Either that or those trying this recipe have no clue what the typical flavor of a pulled meat bbq sandwich is meant to taste like. If you didn't know it was meant to be sweet you shouldn't have even tried it. The fact some of you substituted a store bought premade sauce for the maple syrup is an insult. You should've used that in place of the scratch recipe to begin with or attempted to adjust it to your tastes. I bet you're the types who smother A-1 sauce on every steak you eat as well.

I love the flavor of the homemade BBQ sauce!  I followed the suggestion of cutting the syrup to 1/4 C and added 1/4C of Sweet Baby Ray, 1tsp of Liquid smoke, and a half of an onion.  Cooked it on low for 9.5 hrs using 4frozen breasts.  I thickened the sauce with 1 T of corn starch at the end.   Also cut the onion into large rings so I could fish them out before shredding the chicken.  Worked great.

Very good - But the BBQ sauce recipe was a little too sweet and ketchupy tasting for me. Add any or all of the following if you like a more traditional tangy bite to your BBQ sauce: 
2 Tablespoons of vinegar (apple cider is best), 1 teaspoon mustard powder, 1 Tablespoon black pepper. You can also add a bit more yellow mustard if you still want more bite.

Great flavor! Based on other reviews I made the adjustment to the syrup by lowering it 1/4 cup and using 1/4 BBQ sauce. Next time I might try eliminating it altogether as it's definitely sweet enough even with the large amount of ketchup. Plus I'd like to make it a little lower calorie overall.  I also added chopped onions which made a nice texture difference and flavor. Served them in wraps with Havarti cheese to my boys, used Jalapeno Havarti for my husband and me. They were great!

I loved this recipe and even the most picky eater of the house enjoyed it. I took tips from other readers to skip the maple syrup and to use 1/4 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup barbecue sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chipotle) a medium onion finely chopped, 2 cloves of garlic, and Louisiana Hot Sauce to taste. Cooking my thawed chix for 3.5 hours on high kept it moist and tender. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was pretty good and so easy to make.  I did make changes to the bbq sauce as I felt it was too sweet for my taste.  I decreased the maple syrup by quite a bit, increased the worcestershire and added malt vinegar.  Overall not bad.  The kids enjoyed it.

Is is AMAZING and the definite "secrete" ingredient is truly the Sweet Baby Ray 's BBQ Sauce is what completes the dish and makes it a one of a kind.  I'd recommend this to anyone who loves BBQ chicken dishes-- KUDOS on a terrific recipe!!!  We loved this one ????

Amazing! Great as-is, but also delicious and not so sweet with this quick change: replace half of the maple syrup (1/4 cup) with Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown Sugar BBQ Sauce. It adds a great smoky flavor which really complements the rest of the sauce. I'd eat this every other night if I could :)

It's like pulled pork but it's chicken. I made 2 substitutions based on personal tastes. I switched the ketchup for BBQ sauce since I like that better and I can't stand Worcestershire so I opted for more hot sauce. Soy probably would have also been a good substitute too.

I am cooking this recipe today for the third time! Absolutely love it! Per the other reviews, I also did 1/4 cup of the maple syrup and 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce (I chose original Jack Daniels). This is a great, quick, slow cooker recipe. When cooked on high, it will be done in 3.5 hours. Easy and delicious. Can't go wrong!

I really liked this recipe but I messed up on the sauce, I think. I added a bit too much Worschester Sauce I think, and I added some vinegar. To counteract the forwardness of these two ingredients, I added about 4 T of honey, about 1 c of water and 1/4 c brown sugar. Once I did that, I reduced it and the flavors balanced beautifully. I suspect that if I had just followed the recipe without the vinegar and you know, actually MEASURED the Worchester, my outcome would have been different from the start. Overall though, it was delicious and I would make it again.

I love the flavor of it, but the Chicken "texture" was not there for me. Next time I will try marinating it first in the mixture, grilling it, shredding it, then put back in the crock pot for 30-45 minutes with the marinade mixture.

I have been told to rate this one high, but the teenager didn't save any for me. Based on other reviews I only used 1/4 cup of maple syrup. I took the chicken breasts out of the freezer the night before placed them in my crock, poured the sauce over them, then tucked it in the fridge. The kids had the day off from school and set the chicken on low for 3-4hours when they got up. Rave reviews. We will be making this again (I hope to try it next time).   Thanks for sharing!

I made this w/ 1 1/2 times the sauce. Did NOT make in a slow cooker because it was a last minute decision. Put all sauce ingredients in a pan & simmered, added cooked, shredded chicken, simmered until the chicken had soaked up most of the sauce. I couldn't stay out of this it was soooo addictive! I hid a couple of portions away in the freezer & they reheated perfectly! Thanks for a winning recipe, SHELDAWG!!

A little on the sweet side. Might add a little more mustard next time. Overall, I will make again. Also, I made a coleslaw and stacked it on the sandwich, which help cut the sweetness.

Schedule Change & no time for slow cooker! 3 1/2 hours on low/simmer on stovetop and dee-lish. Doubled sauce recipe (reserving enough to serve on table); used 1/4 cup syrup; combined chili sauce with ketchup; upped the hot sauce. Served on slider buns with baked beans and cole slaw. YUM-OH! Will try slow cooker next time.

Loved this recipe! It's so easy, and the ingredients are relatively simple. I am impressed the fact that this recipe doesn't call for the store-bought barbeque sauce in it! First time, I followed the recipe exactly, and turned out great! Today, I added 1TB of red wine, just to experiment. The sauce mixture smelt wonderful.

This was a really great recipe. I made it twice:

First, I used thin sliced breasts. I 86'd the Worcestershire sauce and added about 1/3 cup of store brand bbq sauce. I used the full 1/2 cup of maple syrup. After 7 hours the chicken was so tender, it fell apart with just a stir of the spoon!

Second time I made it, I used thighs on the bone, and only 1/4 cup of maple syrup. It came out less sweet but just as delicious. 

I personally prefer the first way I made it because I loooove sweet bbq sauce. Definitely will be making this again!

Very good. However, I used spicey  ketchup and should have omitted the cayenne pepper.  It was a little hot but still good. I also added a splash of regular BBQ marinade.

This was good, but I liked it even better the next day. I had to use honey because I didn't have enough maple syrup. I like sweet BBQ. I would have liked even more of the spicy to compliment the sweet--next time I'll add a few more shakes of cayenne pepper and hot sauce. This recipe saved me because I was out of bottled BBQ sauce and had planned on making shredded chicken with that. I thought it needed more sauce, but I didn't read the cook's notes at the bottom, and she suggests making more to put on later. I will definitely do that next time too.

This was a good recipe.  I made it as is seasoning wise but used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead.   I turned out great and went over well with my other half - I will make it again and make adjustments to make it a bit spicier and a little less sweet - Just personal preference to what we like.

Loved it! But reduced maple syrup and ketchup, and added Butt Rub. Also, I added about 3/4 cup of Stubbs Spicey BBQ sauce as the sauce in recipe wasn't enough.

Was very easy to make and delicious and I'm not a big fan of BBQ.  The hubby and 5 y.o really like sit. I also halved the maple syrup and added another batch of sauce near the end as mentioned.

I listened to the others and reduced the maple syrup by half and added some BBQ.  I made a ton of sauce and it still felt a little dry.  I think the cooking time was too much, so next time I will cook it a little less and have more of the sauce on hand to add in the end.  Pretty good flavor!

I substituted regular for honey mustard, and instead of adding cayenne I simply added more chili and garlic powder.  Still fantastic if you want a little sweeter taste!

This was really good! I think next time I will double the sauce as the chicken was a bit dry. We added a little store bought bbq sauce on our buns, lettuce, thin sliced onions, and pickles. Easy dinner with some corn on the cob and baked beans :)

Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a family favorite now! So easy and the kitchen smells amazing until dinner time. I thickened up the sauce a little with a little more ketchup and used 3 breasts rather than 4. Enjoy! :)

Excellent!  only change I made was using less ketchup and using either tomato paste or sauce instead. and didn't use maple syrup...i used bbq sauce (was worried it'd be too sweet) I served it over rice the first time i made it just because i didn't have buns on hand... 

family loved it!

I've made this a few times and my hubby & I like it. I've made a couple adjustments as the other comments suggested and think it's best to either leave the cover off the last hr to let the sauce thicken or just add alittle cornstarch.  All & all a good recipe when u just want something easy & delicious!

I have made this twice now and my family loved it.  I used molasses in place of the maple syrup because it is what I had on hand and it turned out delicious!  I also added diced red onion while it cooked and it turned out amazing!

I thought this was great! Very easy to make and tasty! I only used half the amount of maple syrup that it called for, otherwise I think it would have been too sweet.Also, I added a few drops of Liquid Smoke hickory flavor.

This was fantastic, it's amazing how easy it is shred chicken breasts (I just purchased my slow cooker).  Instead of putting them in buns, we made bbq chicken quesadillas -- pan fried (with no oil) flour tortillas, with some cheddar cheese and the chicken.  Delicious!

I added the barbecue sauce like other recommendations have suggested.  We still found the chicken to be a little bland.  Adding a nice coleslaw to the sandwiches did help.

This was a great base recipe. I tweaked it a bit based on other reviews that said it was too sweet.  Since I love maple flavoring I did not decrease the syrup. Ketchup is full of sugar, so I replaced the ketchup with 6 oz of tomato paste mixed with enough V-8 juice to equal 1 cup (about 3 oz of juice). I added a tablespoon of Dijon mustard, as well as the regular prepared mustard, and added 1/4 teaspoon of onion powder since my ketchup has that in it. I used all the remaining ingredients in this recipe except the chili powder. I replaced that with 1/2 teaspoon of Misty's Bar-B-Q seasoning, which I just happened to find in my cupboard. I did not use the optional dashes of hot sauce. This turned out delicious! Thanks!

This was VERY good the first night, we spooned it right out of the slow cooker while it was still hot. My husband loved it and he is very picky about BBQ (he's a BBQ snob!) However, I went back to heat up some leftovers the next day, after it sat in the fridge and really had a chance to absorb all that extra sauce, and it was too sweet for me the 2nd day. First night it was slightly sweet and tangy with a little bit of a spicy-ness to it, very good. Second day, too sweet for me. Maybe it's just the type of thing that just tastes better right out of the pot. I think this would be good on nachos too.

A few alterations - I left out the mustard altogether...my husband and I both hate the taste of mustard (even when there is just a tiny bit in the recipe, we both seem to be able to taste it, we just aren't mustard people). I also halved the amount of maple syrup and added about 1/4 cup of  bottled bbq sauce - ok, I cheated. But I just didn't like the idea of using all that maple syrup, so I cut it in half with a bottled sauce. And I used 3 large breasts instead of 4 - the 3 breasts fit perfect in my slow cooker without crowding each other, and i thought the sauce-to-chicken ratio was perfect with 3 large breasts.
