Not the best fried chicken recipe I've ever had.  I added all the ingredients thinking it would be way too spicy, but actually, it was quite bland.

My friends and family love this recipe for fried chicken. I never did find savory, so I make it without it, but it is still delicious and after trying 10-15 other recipes, this one is our favorite.

If your expecting KFC chicken don't make this!  My family ate it but none of us were overly impressed. This recipe has potential though.  Personally I would leave out the savory next time this herb is way too strong for chicken.  I may try this again but will definately adjust the herbs and spices more to our liking.  Spice mixture will also stick to chicken better if you dip in plain flour then egg then spice mixture.  I also double dipped in egg and spice mixture.

I really have no idea why everyone is comparing this recipe to KFC. KFC wasn't even around when fried chicken was invented. This is a Spice Mix FOR chicken, the recipe author DIDN'T state it was KFC's spice mix for chicken. Most reviewers are taste comparing this with a fast food chain's flavors, instead of basing their reviews on the flavor itself to chicken. The taste was pretty good. It bumped up a regular fried chicken recipe. I made it exactly as directed for my first batch. With my second batch, I added a little bit of poultry seasoning, sage, onion powder, marjoram, corriander and cumin. I'm giving 4 stars to the recipe because of the process of double cooking. I would prefer to do it once and be done, not add extra steps.

My Husband was disappointed.  Didn't taste at all like KFC.  I rather go to KFC next time to get my fried chicken.  Spices are expensive probably come out cheaper going to KFC! Beth Turney

We enjoyed the taste but it did not taste that much like KFC. I'll still use it again. It was good. Thanks!

This is a great chicken recipe, however, it does taste anything like KFC chicken. A person can play around with the amounts of spices being used to fit your own taste.

This was good, but not to die for.  You can experiment with so many seasonings you will definitely come up with something that suits you eventually....It is a good base to start...

Chicken was very flavorful. My husband really enjoyed it.  The leftovers still tasted great. It does take some time to measure out all of the spices.

This recipe was good.  It was different tasting.  When I make again, I may play around with it a little bit.

After spending a fortune on spices I have never used, I was expecting a robust burst of flavor.  I was very disappointed!  I don't know where the family ate her KFC chicken, but it sure doesn't taste anything like it.  I was expecting spicy, but very bland.  My normal flour mixture is much more flavorful.  I will not try it again.

This is the "real deal"!  I soak my chicken in buttermilk overnight first, to tenderize it.

Thank you, Shauna!

I'm rating this recipe based on the spice mix, not the cooking method.  I made the spice mix according to the directions, cutting the recipe in half.  This was more than I needed for a package of two chicken boneless skinless breasts from Costco.  I dredged the chicken in the mix and then fried it on stovetop with several tablespoons of olive oil.  We thought it had a great flavor, but then I found myself wanting to dip it into a sauce---which happened to be my leftover salad dressing.  My hubby said it was really good, but then he sopped up several pieces of the chicken in his salad dressing, too, without even noticing.  So my guess is that a good dipping sauce is a good bet for this.  I would definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe, Shauna.

I was very good, but my family found it to be too spicy. However, I will try it again (with a little less spice, of course).

While this is a delicious fried chicken recipe, if you make it expecting KFC chicken, you will be slightly disappointed.
