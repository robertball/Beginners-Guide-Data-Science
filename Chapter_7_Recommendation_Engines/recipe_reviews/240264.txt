I love Brussel Sprouts and who doesn't love bacon?  Was in the mood for Brussel Sprouts and wanted to make a salad and my palate said yes to this combination.  Sweetness of cranberries,  mild crunch of apple, firm crunch of almonds, and the flavor of the Balsamic vinegar swirled in amongst the various textures and flavors to create a warm salad.  Fairly easy to whip up.  I used a bit more and quartered my Brussel Sprouts because they were small.  Used an apple I had on hand, roughly chopped whole almonds,  and used a Balsamic vinegar "to taste".  I also used about 1T. of bacon fat to really heat things up for the last couple of minutes.  Could be served as a side salad but we had this as a main entree.
Keeping the recipe in my files and think I will be making this again soon.
