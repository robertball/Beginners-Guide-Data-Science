This is exactly like Houston's salad, which I love, only it is missing one piece, and i think that is what is frustrating some of the reviewers. At Houston's, the peanut sauce is drizzled over the salad (or put on the side if requested). The main dressing is a LIME VINAIGRETTE. you can make a simple lime vinaigrette if you like, or Paul Newman's line makes a light lime vinaigrette that is great - i like very few dressings out of the bottle, and this is one of them. So if you make the salad, toss it in the lime vinaigrette, and then drizzle the peanut sauce after you put the tortilla strips, then you have a Houston's chicken salad. YUM!

Well finally I know the secret ingredient in my favorite salad at Houston's Restaurant:  Hoisin sauce.  The salad was good, I just didn't love it.  The sauce was good but I should have added the veg. oil as suggested by other reviewers - it clung heavily to the greens.  Also I love spicy but I thought the chili paste was too much.  Maybe cutting it in half or even leaving it out would be prudent.  I tried 1/2 Napa cabbage, wish I had stuck with all romaine.  Oh, and the wontons were great.  If you cut them thin and bake them on a cookie sheet - at low heat as suggested by another user - they puff up and taste great.  Make extra b/c your family might snap them up before the salad is ready.  Oh, and I sauted my chicken in some hoison sauce and sesame oil.  It did add a lot to the taste of the salad I thought.

This was so good. I wish I had some left for lunch today. I doubled the recipe as a side dish for a party, and the bowl was cleaned out. I used some reviewers suggestions and added mandarin oranges and substituted napa cabbage for half of the romaine. It was a great suggestion to thin out the dressing with the juice from the oranges. The dressing smelled and tasted wonderful. I shredded the napa cabbage and romaine lettuce really fine. I also substituted chow mein noodles for the wonton wrappers to save time. Thank you, Teri for this great recipe that I will definitely make again!

I made this for dinner tonight and we loved it!  Really tasted like restaurant-quality. My husband said he could eat it every night!  I added a can of mandarin oranges and added some of the juice to the dressing to thin it out.  I also really had to keep an eye on the wontons since they browned very quickly (in about 5-7 minutes).

Mmm, this is a delicious one and has been put into my personal recipe collection. After reading other reviews, I also deep fried my wonton skins and I highly recommend that touch. I found the amount asked for in the recipe was more than enough however, and will probably cut it down next time.

Also, on the dressing, the peanut taste is strong, so if you are not really into peanut, cut the amount back. I like peanuts but think I will still scale back the peanut butter last time. It felt like it was too overpowering and covered up some of the other lovely favorites.

I found this great for a potluck. Just keep the wontons and dressing seperate till right before or things will get soggy.

This salad is wonderful. I made it for a co-worker and she just loved it. I substituted fructose in place of the brown sugar. I also added a can of mandarin oranges. I did add some canola oil to the dressing to thin it out a bit. I will make this again and again.

This is an outstanding recipe, Teri! I've made this a few times and my whole family loves it. I have made it exactly per your instructions which are easy to follow, and I have also made it with some modifications for personal preferences. I used 1/4 cup of olive oil to dilute the seasonings in the dressing when my mom-in-law came over,and I've made the salad with cabbage a couple times. All in all, there really is no need to change a thing. Its perfect, but my family also enjoys variety. Thank you for sharing this tasty recipe.

Yum, yum!  I really liked the sweet and mild spiciness of the dressing and the green onions, carrots, and wontons add a crunchy texture.  Watch the time on the wontons ~ I only kept mine in for about 7 mins to get crispy and golden in the oven!

Chinese Chicken Salads are one of my favorites because they're so versatile and easy to put together.  I usually like to add mandarin orange segments and slivered almonds into the mix.  I prefer mine over shredded cabbage and carrots (pre-mixed of course).  I'm still waiting for my hubby to order me a food processor.  There are several chinese salad recipes on this site, and they all sound delicious.  Use your imagination with this one and enjoy.  Thanks Teri.

We simply loved this salad. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of Thai Red Curry Paste in place of hot chile paste. The flavors blend together so well and the salad is very pleasing texture wise. The toasted wontons are also a great addition. Thanks  Teri.

You can also toss the dressing, chicken and vegetables (except the romaine) over cooked and drained pasta and serve Chinese Noodles and Chicken

OMG!  This is AWESOME!  I really don't like salads that much, but this one sounded so great, so I decided to give it a try, glad I did, I ate 2 servings! I was out of peanut butter, so I made some from scratch (roasted peanuts+peanut oil) and used leftover shredded chicken from last nights dinner.  I also left out the carrots, but I sauteed some thinly sliced onions and tomatoes to add color and added flavor.  Also, I added more oil to the dressing to thin it out and fried the wonton.  Everyone loved this!  Will be making again, thanks a lot!

This was great!  I used tofu instead of chicken (pressed the tofu for 30 minutes, and marinated it in the sauce for a bit).  Did NOT make the wontons, in interest of time, it was great w/o the wontons. Also, I halved the sesame oil (make it healthier).  I added fresh bell peppers, purple cabbage, one orange (diced into smaller bites).  I used the juice that came out of the orange in the dressing.  Also, squeezed the juice of one lime into the salad, hubby and I noticed that both the orange and the lime, added excellent flavor to the salad, and would NOT forget to put that into the salad in the future.  We also felt that the salad would taste great with some nuts (maybe cashews) on top, we'll definitely add that, the next time.  Definitely a salad worth making again!

This was so tasty. I made a couple of modifications. One, I used a product called Better N Peanut butter instead of regular peanut butter - it has 2g fat a serving and has a lighter taste. I also added water chestnuts, just because I love their crunch in chinese food. My wonton skins were nicely crispy and brown in 7-8 minutes, so I think at 15 minutes they would have been soot!! I had this two days in a row, On the second day, I added a dash of soy sauce to the remaining dressing... mmm good. This is a very fast throw together meal. I'll be making this often.

Wow...I love this recipe.  I did add napa cabbage and it made it even more colorful and yummy!  The only thing I would actually change is how much fresh ginger is put in even after chopping it finely and putting it in the food processor I could still taste the chunks.  I don't mind just a hint of taste but I'm sure others that don't like ginger will be thrown off by it.  5 stars! Yum...I will definately be making it again.

This recipe was divine! I made it exactly as stated and it came out awesome. I took it to a pot luck dinner and it was quickly devoured. A truly spectacular salad... one I will be making again & again. Just be REALLY careful when baking your shredded wonton wrappers; 20 minutes is WAY TOO LONG. If you don't want to burn them, bake for about 10 minutes and then check them.

i loved the salad - but, what i did was use the sauce and made it an amazing stir fry....my husband's favorite.  in fact, i ordered a stir fry in a restaurant and it tasted exactly the same. make sure you double the sauce, but 1/2 onto the cooked chicken, use rice noodles (soak X 30min) and place rest of sauce on it to coat.  add veggies of your choice and you have an awsome stir fry

DRESSING ONLY REVIEW:
Have been looking for years to find a really good dressing for an Asian chicken salad, and this one is the best I've had thus far. I echo other reviewers in adding mandarin orange juice for thinning, and I also scattered the orange segments on the top of the salad for more citrus flavor. My own salad consists of a recipe from a restaurant I used to work at, which is parsley, green onion, shredded carrot, shredded iceburg lettuce, chow mein noodles and chopped chicken with sesame seeds on top.

This is one of our favorite recipes! It has a wonderful mix of flavors that work very well together, and has a nice "kick" to balance the sweet tone of the dressing. I am certifiably addicted to this salad--so much so that I made up a ton of extra dressing--and have extra grilled chicken in the freezer--to keep on hand so that I can have this anytime I want it.
Unlike some of the reviewers who preferred less peanut taste, we love the flavor that the peanut butter gives (sometimes we even toss some peanuts into the salad for some added peanut flavor and crunch).
For those folks who don't like the dressing so thick, you might add some juice to the dressing (we've added mandarin oranges, or canned pineapple (the pineapple, in particular, surprised us by how well it blended with all of the other flavors) to the salad, and used juice from those cans to thin out the dressing a bit).
This salad is definitely in the "restaurant quality" category! Thanks for sharing!

A slightly different take on chinese chicken salad (reminiscent of Thai) but very delicious!  I cut down slightly on the carrots and included 1 cup of bean sprouts and some chopped snow peas for extra crunch.  I also deep fried the wonton skins for a not-so-healthy but tasty treat for my hubby.  For anyone on the Atkins or low-carb diet, try sliced almonds instead. Super recipe!

This was very good.  We like spicy food so I added 1/3 cup of chili oil to the dressing.  Next time I think I will use napa cabbage, maybe to bean spouts and more chicken. Oh, I doubled the sauce like may others.

So after reading 4 of the "most helpful" reviews, I came up with the following modifications - I used chicken fingers (mainly because I love the crispiness in a salad), I divided the sauce into two, one with the peanut butter (1.5 tbsp), hoisin sauce, and brown sugar - this sauce was to coat the chicken.  The second sauce, or dressing, consisted of the rice wine vinegar (2 tbsp instead of 3) , sesame oil, and rather than hot chile paste and ginger, I used a chile/garlic/ginger paste mix - this dressing was used to toss the salad prior to topping the salad with the chicken.  After reading a few reviews noting that the salad was missing the "lime flavor" that allow this salad to almost match some restaurant's famous salad, I decided to add 1 tbsp of lime juice (bottled) to the dressing, and a splash or two to the sauce.  I also added the 1 tbsp of rice vinegar that was omitted from the dressing to the sauce in order to thin it out.  Finally, I used 1/2 bag of bagged garden salad (which had the shredded carrots, along with some red cabbage) mixed with about 8 leaves of chopped romaine.  Do not leave out the cilantro, as this adds a nice flavor as well.  I left out the wonton wrappers due to lack of ingredients, and lack of time.  This salad is by far the best salad I have made yet!  I love it!

This is  an excellent salad.  I cut the peanut butter to 1 T, add some cut up napa cabbage and sliced almonds for more crunch.  I have made this several times.

Love this salad.  It has great flavor and crunch.  After reading reviews, I used only 1 TBL peanut butter in the dressing and added, instead of napa cabbage, about 1 cup of dry broccoli slaw mix which includes shredded carrots, red cabbage, and broccoli.  That added great crunch, color, and nutrition.  I baked the wontons and they added a great crunch.   I agree with other reviewers that 16 wrappers would have been way too much.  I used one and that was enough.  I did not have any mandarin oranges.  However, it was excellent without them.  Thank you for a delicious salad.

This was very good but I did make some minor adjustments. I marinaded the chicken in soy sauce, hoisin, chile sauce, brown sugar and sesame oil before it was grilled. In the marinade and dressing, I used a sweet chile sauce because I didn't have hot chile paste. I really liked the crispy wonton pieces but 16 wonton wrappers would have been overkill. I used 6 and it was more than enough. And they REALLY don't need to be in the oven 20 mins. I did them at 300 for about 7 mins and they were nice and crispy and golden brown. I used a little less carrot, but added bean sprouts because I really like them and look for reasons to use them. Also added cashews for a little more crunch. The dressing was nice, I did add about 2 T orange juice to thin it a little. My parents said they felt it needed a lot more dressing, but my serving had plenty for my tastes. If you like your salad swimming in dressing, maybe increase it a little. All in all, we really liked this! Thanks for the recipe.

I made this salad for dinner the other night and served it alongside some cornbread.  The end result was really delicious and quite filling!  I grilled the chicken and didn't add any cilantro to the salad - we will definitely make this again. The dressing really makes this salad - but as other reviewers have mentioned, it does need oil to thin it out so I added about 1/4 cup of EVOO.

This salad was good, but not great.  I did like the dressing but a little goes a long way.  The wontons added a nice crunch but not a lot of flavor.  They were thoroughly browned in less than 10 minutes.  Next time I will use chow mein noodles instead, I would also add mandarin oranges and toasted almonds for some additional flavor.  Some cabbage would be good too.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous!  Very tasty.  The only thing I did different was add some bean sprouts for extra crunch and flavor.  Terrific!

We were disappointed in the dressing - we've had better dressing out of a salad kit from the local specialty food store.  The dressing is very heavy and the peanut-butter&hoisin overwhelms the salad.  Sorry - no one in our family liked this recipe and was voted "thumbs down"

I attended a potluck and normally I get nervous because I don't know how to cook well.  I found this recipe and decided to try it for the potluck. The directions are very clear and easy to follow.  The salad was the hit of the party.  I made TONS of it and only a small portion was left over.  People were fighting to take the leftover home.  I was really glad that I brought something that everyone LOVED!

This is absolutely the best salad ever! Delicious dressing. My husband and I eat it at least once a week. I double the dressing ingredients and add about 1/3 cup of vegetable oil to thin it out and make it a little lighter.

The dressing was full of flavor and good for summer time salad.  It was too sweet to me though, so I added a tablespoon or a little more of soy sauce to it.  That helped smoothe the texture of the dressing as well. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this without the wontons to save on calories. I also used a healthy amount of chilie garlic paste and a touch of sriracha to add spice. It was thick and tasty. Might add a touch more cilantro next time.

I already had grilled chicken breasts in the freezer, so I decided this would be good for dinner since our weather here has been super hot and humid.  I did make a few changes as follows:  I cut back on the chile paste because the one I have is really hot.  I used dried ginger and I added yellow bell pepper that needed to be used.  We’re not big fans of cilantro, so I left that out.  And I used Chinese rice noodles instead of the wonton wrappers.  We liked this, but I did think it was a little heavy on the hoisin sauce.  And my dressing was so thick that I had to thin it with a little orange juice, which worked quite well.  I would make this again cutting back a little on the hoisin.

I thought it was great although not eaten by my husband as it had a fishy taste to the peanut sauce since it had hoisen sauce in it. The kids & myself ate it up. I think I'll use the sauce for something else in the future. I added sesame seeds to the sauce as well.

I didn't have any trouble with the wontons, I just kept an eye on them and tossed them around every 5 minutes or so, removing any that were getting dark. Next time I'll try adding a little oil to the wontons.  The salad was very good.  I added some seeded, diced cucumber (I had one in the fridge that needed to be used, fast).  And used shredded cabbage instead of romaine.  DH liked it, but said it wasn't as good as my regular Chinese chicken salad.  I liked it a lot, though.

I made the dressing for this salad and tossed it with with grilled chicken (sprinkled with some Asian 5 spice powder), romaine lettuce, and chow mein noodles.  The dressing is thick, has a good kick, and is very tasty.

YUMMY!!  A great blend of flavors, I could have eaten the dressing alone!!  I also added some chopped cabbage to the salad along with water chestnuts.  And added 1 more tablespoon of vinegar to make the dressing a little thinner so it would blend and toss better (I love vinegar, so this was no problem, if you are not a vinegar lover try adding a tad bit of water to thin it out some!)!  A keeper for sure! Thanks!!

This salad is flavorful, full of texture, and a quick one to prepare.  Using pre-cooked chicken saves a lot of time.  I used packaged crispy chow mein noodles instead of the wontons, and it was delicious.  This is a keeper!

I made this recipe today (with minor adjustments.. read on..) and we all LOVED it.. it's go into the Longaberger recipe basket and we'll definitely use it again and again!

OK, now for the alterations:  I doubled the dressing recipe, and added 1/3 CUP of vegetable oil.  It is a FABULOUS recipe for dressing on it's own.  I also substituted finely chopped cabbage for the lettuce.. I like cabbage better for this type of salad.  It has a great crunch and holds up well.  One more thing (yes I altered it a bit more than a little..) I used a package of ramen noodles crushed up and toasted with 1/2 cup of slivered almonds in the toaster oven for about 10 minutes, that was the substitution for the wonton wrapper things.  This salad is ADDICTING!!  Oh yah.. use the natural type of peanut butter, and don't assemble the salad until you are ready to eat it.

This was excellent.  The cilantro isn't required though and I'll probably skip it next time I make it.  Also, I ended up burning the wonton wrappers twice before lowering the temp to 200F and finally came out OK.  I couldn't find hot chile paste, but used chile sauce instead and it was fine.

This salad is awesome!!  I swapped out the wonton wrappers for toasted almonds to lower the carbs.  I also used 1 T. of peanut butter and thought that was plenty.  Pounded and broiled the chicken with a little s&p.  Will definitely be making this again!!!

This is amazing! Every time I make it, my family drools. Today my son suggested we throw it in a wrap with the lettuce and the crunchy wontons on top. It was a supreme innovation for taking this deliciousness on-the-go.

Delicious as is.  Tastes like a restaurant salad but is much healthier!  I added some roasted almonds and some sesame sticks.  Next time I will thin the dressing as it was pretty thick.  I will also use less brown sugar as the PB has some sugar in it too.

Really, really good.  I marinated the meat in hoisin, chili paste, and fresh crushed garlic.  I also recommend you make the dressing to your liking, I added more vinegar and less sugar and peanut butter, added a splash of lemon.  I added sliced snow peas to my salad and used coleslaw mix from the produce section to make it faster.  Will be a regular in my house from now on.

This salad was outstanding.  I thought it was easy, quick and the taste was awesome.  I love the Won Tons on top.  I nipped and tucked just a little to lower the calories (peanut butter, chicken & sugar), but used everything and made just the way the recipe said.  We absolutely loved it.  A keeper!

This went over really well!!!  Contrary to other reviews, I thought it could use a little more peanut butter, brown sugar, & chili sauce.  I boiled the chicken with a little white wine, but I think it would of been much better grilled.  I used spring mix, subbed 1/2 the carrots with red pepper strips, used toasted almonds in place of the wontons, & half the green onions (it was a really large bunch).  After the dressing cooled, it was extremely thick, so I thinned it with mandarin orange juice.  Will definitely be making again!!!

This was fantastic!  I substituted a couple of items, but it still turned out fantastic!  I switched almond butter for peanut butter since that is what I had on hand.  I also used napa cabbage instead of romaine.  I added some shredded purple cabbage and julienned red bell pepper which gave it some extra color kick.  I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used powdered, but I think fresh would have been better.  I also used a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from my local market, which I thought gave it a little more flavor.  I was amazed at how good the dressing turned out.  This is one recipe I'll definately use for myself as well as other gatherings!

We loved this. I made the sauce as written but might use less peanut butter next time. We used rotisserie chicken and chow mein noodles instead of won tons  and it was super quick and delicious. We'll definitely be making this again.

I always try to compile the best suggestions when I try something-added red pepper, toasted sliced almonds and decreased the peanut butter just a little. Took it to the work potluck at the hospital-nurses  are your best critics! (So little time....so we love quality!) It seemed about 50% loved it. Not as many compliments as usual. Dressing was spicier than I expected. The more I ate-the more I liked it. The best wontons are cut into 4 strips and fried a couple at a time in peanut oil. Time consuming, but worth it.

Made this for dinner tonight, and it was excellent.  Only changes I made were: garlic salt on the won tons as they baked, a little extra brown sugar and  hoisen sauce along with a little orange juice to the dressing.  Topped with orange segments.  Good stuff and my husband is taking leftovers to work.  The chicken was moist and tender done on the grill with garlic powder.  Thanks, Teri.

Although baking your wonton strip is obvisiously healthier, tuning the oven on for 20 mins for something that will take 2 mins in a little oil. I choose frying. The first couple bites I found ok, however, once the flavors started melding together, oh wow! Hubby loved it too!

Wow, this was good.  This reminded me of the salad at Souplantation.  We used 2 bags of pre-cut and washed romaine.  We doubled the dressing and used half of it to marinate our chicken in, for the dressing for the salad, I think if you are using 2 bags of pre-washed lettuce, I would make a little more dressing.  We grilled our chicken and used pre-made wonton strips.  It made a huge salad.  We have made it twice, once for company, and everyone loved it and went back for seconds (and thirds!).

Dressing was too strong, too salty.  Hoisin sauce is already strong by itself and adding the peanut butter didn't make it any better.  I eat hoisin sauce all the time and I think it wasn't used properly in this recipe.  This would probably be better as a meat marinade or something.

What a great, easy salad!

I did a few things to make it quicker.  First, I bought a bag of tri-colored cole slaw mix (I prefer cabbage to lettuce in this kind of salad).  Second, I used a roasted chicken from the grocery store and just shredded that instead of baking my own.

As far as the dressing goes, I took other reviewer's advice and used some Mandarin orange juice to thin the dressing.  I also ommitted the ginger (hate it), and left the brown sugar out because it was by far sweet enough without it.  With some minor modifications to fit my taste, this salad totally hit the spot, and I'll be eating it for days to come!  (To help with the ease-factor, I made a big batch of the dressing to keep in the fridge, pre-chopped up my scallions and cilantro and added it to my cole slaw mix, so that all I have to do is shred some chicken and drizzle my dressing, and I'm set to go.

This salad just rocks.  I added mandarin oranges, water chestnuts and toasted almonds.  I also used chow mein noodles.  The secret is the sauce.  Put this sauce on a brick and the brick would taste good.  My wife loves this and only asks that I stop her after two bowls.  FYI-Williams Sonoma has some awesome peanut sauce if you don't have the time to make it.

I love this recipe and have made it several times. Some changes I recommend: add mandarin orange juice from can to dressing to thin it out, don't bother with the wonton wrappers the crispy chow mein noodles from the grocery store are fine, and I omit the chili sauce too bc I am not a spice person and it still tastes great!

Toasting the wonton wrap was a little time consuming, but it was well worth the effort.  However, next time I might use dry instant noodle instead.

Mostly followed the recipe to a 't' but omitted sugar-very sweet already. Also added juice from mandarin orange can. Excellent flavor. Added mandarin oranges to salad with red bell peppers, pea pods.

Neither my husband or I liked this salad and we are both big fans of asian inspired salad dressings.  I really disliked this dressing. It was really yucky....a thick, bad tasting glob. I did like the greens though...the cilantro and green onions were very good.

I LOVE this salad. The dressing is completely addictive. The chicken tastes better if I cook it with a little seasoning, like soy sauce and ginger, or garlic salt and hoisin. I sprayed the wonton wrappers with a little peanut oil before baking, and they were done much faster than 20 min. (I like chow mein noodles just as much as the wonton wrappers, and it's less work.) Try this recipe!

Hmmm, very interesting.  When I made I liked it but not sure about all the different flavors. The next day it was actualy better.  Next time maybe I will make the dressing the day before tho let all of the flavors combine well.  Cooked wonton wrappers a lot less time.  They almost burned.

I thought this salad was really good.  The dressing was quite thick though.  I know it's supposed to be low fat, but I ended up adding a little vegetable oil and water to try to thin it out a little.  I had a hard time getting the dressing to coat the salad evenly when it was so thick.  It tasted great though!

Fantastic.  Absolutely gorgeous salad.  I like my salads, and eat a lot of them, but this one is special.

The salad can be customised in many ways, like substituting whatever fresh veggies I have in the fridge, and using fried noodles instead of wanton wrappers.

I think as long as you have the sauce, the shallots and the chicken, you can't go wrong!

Also good for weight loss.  By eating sensible salads like this, I have lost over 30 kilograms (66 pounds) and kept it off for over two years.

Wow!  Dee-licious!  I doubled the dressing ingredients and added 1/3 c. canola oil, as some suggested.  I also used 1.5 pounds of chicken, and sauted the breasts in hoisin sauce and sesame oil, also as suggested.  My guests RAVED!  The baked won tons made a yummy and unexpected addition.  Couldn't find "hot chile paste" at my grocer's, so I added 3/4 t. of hot chili powder, which gave the dressing a nice bite.  Thanks, Teri!

Great recipe, and I love the dressing. I doubled the dressing recipe and added 1/3 of veggie oil, just to thin. (plus children like a lot of dressing usually) In the beginning, we used romaine lettuce, now we have used different types of lettuces and even the pre-made salad mixes (which is cheaper and easier for large crowds.)

This was an excellent salad! The dressing looked a bit different when it was done, but it tasted amazing.  The crunchiness of the baked wonton wrappers added a great touch.

Wonderful flavor. The dressing seemed to have too much peanut butter, but after it was all together, I wouldn't have changed a thing. It is delicious.

add wontons and lettuce immediately prior to serving, else they go soft. This is a delicious salad to take on a picnic.

My husband and I really enjoyed this salad!  I followed someone else's post that recommended putting a lime vinaigrette on the salad first then topping with the hoisin/peanut dressing.  Perfect!  I used store bought crunchy chow mein noodles that I had on hand.  Definitely will be making this salad again.

This recipe is great, as is! I did use ready-made chow mein noodles to save time. I also typically grill chicken breasts in advance, then slice then, put a portion in snack-sized zip lock bags, then freeze them for use on salads later. I take a pkg out of freezer and put in microwave for 45-60 seconds when I want some for a salad. I also per-grate ginger and wrap 1 tsp portions in plastic wrap, then put them all in a labeled zip lock and when needed, I put a tsp pkg in microwave for 15 seconds. This way I also have access to fresh grated / chopped ginger without a lot of work. For the grated carrots, either grate last or sprinkle with lemon juice to slow down the oxidizing which causes them to go brown quickly after grating.

This was really good! I used this as a cook once, eat twice salad from chicken we grilled the night before. The dressing is wonderful!! However, it is tad rich for us, so I used a lime vinaigrette dressing on the lettuce and drizzled the hoisin/pb dressing over the top and served it on the side as dipping sauce. i would definitely make this again Thank you!

I haven't written a review in a while but I feel compelled to write one for this recipe. Definitely 5 stars. Simple, delicious, restaurant quality. The only change I made was use fried crunchy noodles instead of preparing the wonton skins because it was the only ingredient I couldn't find. Will add slivered almonds and chopped celery next time for more crunch. Yum!

I only made the dressing part of the recipe.  It was very good.  I added a clove of crushed garlic.  It reminded us of a dressing we had on grilled shrimp at a restaurant in Jeffersonville, VT (154 Main I think is the name--only restaurant right on Main Street).

I thought this was awesome.  I gave it 5 stars even though I tweeked it just because of what I had on hand.  I did not have hot chili paste but I had sweet chili sauce so I used that instead and added 1 tsp of additional red pepper flakes for a bit of heat.  This was perfect.  I also added pea pods.  Awesome recipe. thanks for sharing!!

Really good.  I made sure to add lots of cilantro to the lettuce and I marinated the chicken in soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, sesame oil and garlic with a little sugar.  I cooked the breasts on a skillet on the stove whole and then sliced them up after.  The won ton strips cooked a little quicker than the recipe calls for and they need to be tossed about halfway through.  I think about 15 mins is about right.  Mine strips also needed a little salt.  Delicious and I'll definitely make this again.

It was an ok salad. I did not care for the dressing at all or the baked wontons! Without the two its just a typical salad. For the dressing I ended up using Sweet Baby Rays bar-bq sauce. That was really nice!

I love this salad! DH didn't love it as much as me but he did like it. It's really flavorful! The only item I didn't have was the chili paste. I used chili sauce which I am sure isn't very much like the paste but I used it anyway. I will definitely make this again - yum!

So good!  I did take a few recommendations and made a couple changes but still giving it 5 stars.  I used one bad of cabbage mix and a head of romaine.  Since I added more with the cabbage, I doubled the dressing.  I didn't have chili paste so used 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper.  Added juice of one lime and some juice from the mandarin oranges I added to the salad....it was so good, tasted like right out of a restaurant but I knew the ingredients which is why I'd rather cook at home!  Thank you for a great recipe!

This was delicious! I realized at the last minute that I had no hoisin sauce, so I added a little light soy sauce, garlic paste, more ginger and some Chinese 5 spice powder, and got a similar effect (maybe a bit less salty, which is a win in my book).  I used 1 tsp of the stronger flavored toasted sesame oil and the rest was grapeseed oil, for it's nice neutral flavor.  The dressing was still a bit thick so I added some lime juice.  As an afterthought I tossed in about a cup of edamame into the salad.  I also only baked about 6 wontons, at 375 for about 10 minutes, but I actually forgot to even add them to my serving because it already looked so good!  Really liked this a lot!

This was delicious and very easy. I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter flavored dishes, so I only used 1 T peanut butter and it was great. Oh, and I used cabbage instead of romaine.

Thanks Teri for this terrific recipe!  This tastes identical to a salad at Steamworks in Durango, CO.  I tossed the dressing with cooked rice noodles and added that to the rest.  It didn't need any additional dressing.  Yummy!!

We loved this salad!  I only wish I had made double the sauce so I would have some dipping sauce for another time!  I think the sauce would be great for lettuce wraps.  The only change I made was to sprinkle sesame seeds on top of each serving for a little finishing touch.  Great combination of flavors.  Thanks for sharing your idea!

I had many leftovers in the fridge, that I found would be perfect to use with this salad. I didn't follow the recipe completely, however U found that the base of this recipe was great! I was able to not only have it for dinner, but there was enough leftover for lunch the next day! this is worth all five stars!

This recipe is fabulous! The only change that it needs is to add some juice from a can of mandarin oranges to the dressing. I always add extras to the salad like mandarin oranges, crispy noodles, slivered almonds... whatever.

We loved this..forgot the ginger at the market, so I used 1/4 tsp of ground ginger.  I agree with other viewers...8-10 minutes for the wontons.  Thanks for a great recipe -- this one is a keeper!

Loved this!  Easy and got great reviews at home.  Used natural p.b. and added fresh lime juice to the dressing.

Very good - kind of a little more work than I bargained for, but that's because I made the chicken from scratch.  Next time I'll either use a rotisserie chicken or leftover roasted chicken.  I think I agree that this recipe is a bit carrot-heavy, and might replace them with something else -- julienned cucumbers? -- next time.  I also agree that the wonton wrappers don't take anywhere near to 20 minutes; some of mine were burned at 8.  Next time I'll stir them a few times and start checking them at five, just to be on the safe side.  I was pleased at how crispy they came out, though, and the peanut dressing was awesome!  Finally, I took the advice of another reviewer and dressed the salad with a lime vinaigrette (lime juice, a half teaspoon or so of mustard, and salt, pepper and olive oil to taste) and I think that really pepped the salad up.  The peanut dressing is very sweet and a bit heavy, and the tartness of the lime juice adds brightness.  Thanks for the recipe!

The dressing for this salad was fabulous...the problem I had with this recipe was that there was way too many carrots which made the salad soggy....i guess if I would have used the carrots from the supermarket that are already shredded and dried out it may have worked.  I would just use less fresh carrots next time.

This recipe was quite good and I will make it again with the suggestions of others, cut the peanut butter in half, adding the mandarin orange juice to the sauce to help thin it out as it was quite thick. I think I may even bump up the hot chile paste a tad. Thanks for the great recipe Teri!

What a great recipe.  Read the reviews and added mandarin segments and almonds as didn't have the wontons.  Recommend cooking the chicken in a little Hoisin - gives it a great flavour.  Also added some red bell pepper for extra colour.  Thank you so much!

My family loves this recipe, I too add mandarin oranges and I use a chicken pieces with a crispy coating/batter ( in freezer section)  on it heat it and then cut it up, adds a lot to the salad. I always make double the dressing. So good.

Wow this recipe was delicious.  My family thought it was great as well.  Like others next time I would only put 2 tablespoons of peanut butter in and increase the hoisin sauce by 1 tablespoon.  This is a keeper for us.  Thanks Teri

I made some changes that made this a 4 star recipe, but it's only 3 as-is.  The dressing was entirely too thick and heavy.  I added about 1/4 cup of the juice from a can of mandarin oranges.  I still didn't like the salad all that much, but when I added the oranges to the salad, that made all the difference.  Probably won't be making this again.

I love this recipe.. the only changes I made were to cut the chili paste a bit, and I marinated the chicken for a bit in Lawreys Sesame GInger Marinade. If I am pressed for time.. or lazy.. I substitute chowmein noodles or fried LaChoy rice noodles for the won tons and the taste is still great!

These flavors are great. I've made this dressing several times for cabbage based salads, but changed the consistency by doubling the oil (olive instead of sesame; I just don't like sesame oil). Also halved the hoisin and peanut butter, eliminated the brown suger (the hoisin is quite sweet) and doubled the ginger. Yums.

This is an excellent recipe, specifically the dressing!  You can use any veggies you want, I chose: Napa Cabbage, Romaine Lettuce, Cilantro, Julienned Carrots, Cucumber, Bean Sprouts & Thai Basil. I watered down the dressing just a little so it was easier to toss. I added a little lime juice to the dressing & that really enhanced the flavor well! This is a restaurant quality salad! Thank you for sharing!

We loved the recipe.  I would agree with a previous reviewer and would cut back the red chili in half (or just add to taste).  We also put additional sesame oil and olive oil to reduce the thickness.  I tripled the recipe and took it to a potluck last night and everyone loved it!

I was hoping that I would like this, but it turned out that I didnt care for it.  It was mainly the sauce.  I thought the sauce was way to strong and had a wierd flavor.  The salad is wonderful, but I would just prefer a different sauce to go with it.  I just ended up making it into a regular chicken salad with ranch dressing.

Ok recipe.  Needs some adjustments.  I too, thought it was thick and clumped to the greens.  Next time I'll take the advice of others and add some more oil.  My husband thought that the peanut butter could be cut in half.  I will try it one more time with some new changes!

Delicious Salad! My husband loved it!! make sure to use only 2 TBSPs of peanut butter..... I did add a little too much peanut butter for the dressing, and it was peanut buttery :)....It was still good, but I really had to play with the other ingredients to tone down the peanut butter flavor...Great salad...nice change from the usual boring salads that I make :)

OH MY GOSH!!!  This salad is awesome.  I was enticed by the picture and then by reading the ingredients.  I made this last night and had a hard time sharing it with my family because I wanted to eat it all myself!  I followed the suggestion of others and added some mandarin orange juice to the dressing, and I also mixed it in the food processor so that I wouldn't have to do much stirring.  I added the oranges to the salad, and it was perfect!  I didn't have Chili paste so I put in some red pepper flakes.  I also used a whole head of romaine lettuce plus about half a bag of the cole slaw mix in the bag because it had carrots in it, and I didn't have to buy them otherwise.  For the chicken, I only used two good sized breast fillets that I grilled on the George Foreman after letting them marinate in salt, pepper, red pepper flakes and teriyaki sauce.  All I can say is "WOW, I can't wait to make this again!"

This dressing is awesome! One of my 2 favorites that are so good you have to keep some on hand at all times.  Sure it's thick, but I just water it down to the consistency I like.  There is plenty of flavor to support extra water.  I like PAMMYGG1's idea of using it in stir-fry.  I'm going to try it as a marinade and baste for shish-k-bob this weekend.

This dressing had an amazing flavor even with the substitutes I used!  My husband and I are not big fans of fresh ginger or cilantro, as they both can be so strong, so I omitted those ingredients.  I also didn't add the brown sugar and used Splenda instead.  I added more vinegar, sesame seed oil and water to thin out the dressing.  My supermarket didn't have the chile paste, so I bought hot mustard paste instead which gave it a nice kick.  I added very thin strips of red pepper to the salad.  This recipe is such a favorite salad for my husband and I.  Thanks for sharing!  The intense flavor of the dressing is just what I was looking for!

Can't go wrong with this recipe! This salad has become the #1 salad in my household. We prepare it at least once a month for ourselves and have served it at parties and pot lucks.
The SAUCE is the key.  I've also started using the sauce in my stir fry recipes.

I made this with Crab Rangoon I and had a wonderful dinner.  The wontons only took 8 minutes to bake, I'm glad I checked or they would have burned in 20.  Added a little extra vinegar to thin the dressing.  May  use less Hoisin sauce next time.

I made this salad for my bunco group and it was a hit!  The dressing was fantastic!  It was also easy. I added mandarin oranges and I couldn't find the wontons so I substituted the crispy chow mein noodles. Delicious!

Absolutely YUMMY!!  I liked everything about this recipe.  The thickness of the dressing is something that can be easily adjusted. This is refreshing and filling!

I didn't have most of the ingredients on hand, but it was worth the trip to the grocery store.  The salad has a little kick and different from most Chinese Chicken Salad recipes I've tried. Good!

I used light peanut butter and omitted the sugar since the peanut butter is already sweetened.  I added a spritz of lime to the dressing, which freshened it up.  Also, adding more veggies to the salad, like cucumber and red pepper, was a delicious way to get in your daily veggies servings.

I didn't use carrots or cilantro and it still turned out delicious. It was even easier because I didn't oven bake the wonton wrappers, just tossed them into my deep fryer and it was done very fast. Highly recommend.

Definately EXCELLENT!  Love the flavors!!  Didn't care for the extra crunch of the wonton wrappers.  I think there should be a little crunch and I will replace that with some type of chinese crunchy noodles.  I added toasted sesame seeds, it made a great topper.

This is the BEST Chicken Salad I have ever tried! My whole family loves it, including all 6 kids, right down to the 5 yr old. It should be called "Thai" Chicken Salad though.....that is what the flavor is.  SUPERB!

Absolutely Superb!  It's a hit at every party.  I like to fry the wonton for a crispy touch.  You can make the dressing ahead of time.  Also very easy to take to any Potluck and mix at the event!  Once again DELICIOUS!!!  Thanks Teri you're a Fabulous Chef!

This was absolutely delicious!  The flavor is great and my husband and I polished off a large bag of salad, and added everything else.  It was healthy, too.  Thanks for sharing and I have been making this at least once a week.  Yummy!

My family thought this was one of the best chicken dishes they'd tasted! Spicy, but not too, and flavorful - and low-fat is an added bonus.

This is so yummy my family asked for it for my nephew's baptismal party! I've used kale/cabbage mix before and it came out so good! Thank you! This recipe is in my favorites box. Will be making this again and again especially during the summer.

Instead of all romaine I mixed 50% hard cabbage and 50% romaine lettuce. I also added at least a half cup of orange juice to the dressing to thin it out. At the end when I was eating the salad I could have used a good twist of lime juice on the finished product. In general it was a good recipe but needs some tweaking. They should have called it Chicken Satay Salad because the dressing was more like satay sauce.

I used less than half of the PB and rice noodles for wonton wrappers, since I couldn't find any. Also, I served mandarin oranges on the side for those that wanted to add them. This salad was very good.

yum. we've made this as the recipe is - a salad. tonight we made the chicken, the peanut dressing/sauce and put that on top of the chicken and rice. We added red pepper,, green onion and mushrooms. there are many ways to serve this and not go wrong.

When we cook the chicken, we cook high heat, get it a little blackened, and add sweet chili sauce, hoisin sauce and hot chili paste to flavor it. 

I prefer it as a salad, my husband prefers as a dinner with rice. with the sauce and seasoning, it's hard to decide. just simply yum.

ETA: i tried baking the wonton strips and thoroughly burned them so I fried them in a bit of oil (1/2") on the stove. Husband doesn't like  fried food much so....darn, guess I'll eat extra!!

This is a really great recipe - especially with a couple variations that I think really enhance the flavor. I always get rave reviews - especially from my husband who "hates cabbage"! Add half bottle of finely miced crystalized ginger (chop until almost a powder). The ginger adds just a hint of sweetness but makes a huge improvement to the flavor. And instead of sunflower seeds, I prefer using roasted sesame seeds, which tend to blend better with the rest of the ingredients (if you don't buy them pre-roasted, you can roast them with the almonds). And finally, I ncrease the almonds by 1 1/2x to give a tad more crunch and flavor.

This was so good.  I had an issue with the wontons burning in the allotted time. I only needed to keep the next batch in for 7 minutes.  I also dressed the lettuce with a lime vinaigrette. The brown sauce is pretty thick and isn't quite a dressing. It's  super tasty but not a dressing.  I pan fried the chicken in peanut oil with salt and pepper. I subbed radish for he carrot.

This was so easy to make. I love to experiment with flavours so I substituted the rice wine vinegar with apple cider and included some shredded cucumbers in the salad. I also used crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy. Oh and I used hot curry chili paste instead of the regular hot chili paste. I would def. be making this again

This was very good! I agree w/ others that the dressing is waaay too thick, so I thinned mine w/ a little veg. oil and mandarine orange liquid from the can (I used the oranges in the salad). I wanted this as a side salad, so I did omit the chicken, but added the mandarine oranges, as I said, and some red and yellow bell pepper that I had to use up. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Yummy!! I probably added 1/8 cup of vegetable oil to the dressing and used a can of chow mein noodles instead of baking wontons. So good and satisfies my craving for Chinese Chicken Salad from Applebees.

This was delicious!  I did not care for the wontons so much so instead added some toasted sliced almonds - delish!  Next time I will add some mandarin oranges.

AWESOME!!! I have not eaten at whatever restaurant that this recipe mimics, but I certainly love this salad. After adding the chicken and dressing to the lettuce, it did wilt a bit- but I actually loved this more! The dressing and toppings were perfect and I will make this again and again.

OMG that was YUMMY!  I had seconds.  I needed something quick so I used pre-packaged coleslaw mix instead of the romaine and carrots, Tyson pre-grilled chicken and Fresh Gourmet Wonton strips.  I also used olive oil instead of sesame oil because I didn't have it.  I thought the dressing was wonderful and love the cilantro flavor.  A definite keeper.

Great salad!  Used iceberg lettuce and it tasted fine.  I loved the dressing.  Added mandarin orange slices to the mix which gave it another element of flavor and color.

I took this to a potluck and had raves over it. Lots of ladies wanted the recipe. What delicious flavor. It was even good left over the next day believe it or not. I just saved out some of the fried wontons to use the second day. Yum. I think if I were to change anything it would be to salt the wontons before baking them. Perhaps spray them with a tiny bit of cooking spray so the salt would stick.

Really flavorful.  The dressing was good but I made the mistake of putting the entire amount on the salad.  Next time I'll only make 1/2 amt drsg or add more lettuce.

The dressing was great even without the chili paste.  I used roasted slivered almonds for crunch since I didn't have wonton wrappers.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  The family loved it!

This is similar to a salad my mom makes. But the dressing needs to be tweaked. My hubby said the peanut butter was a little strong.

I served this to a crew of 7; even the kids went back for seconds.  I used Jif "Natural" in it, which made the peanut butter too prominent; if you plan on using a natural variety, it would be prudent to dial down the amount of PB.

This was VERY good -- the dressing was AWESOME!!!!  I will definitely make it again.  I substituted broccoli slaw for the carrots and onions. Although the wontons took a lot less time than the 20 minutes in the recipe (closer to 8 minutes)

I'm "studying" for a good cholesterol score.  It's steamy hot and humid here.  Voila! Up turns this delicious recipe in my email this morning.  Made dressing by closest approximation by memory and intentionally lowered sodium levels.  The romaine and shredded carrots with green onions and grilled chicken are nothin' but Yum! Yum! Yum!

This was just OK.  My husband and I didn't care for it that much.  We thought the dressing did not taste as good as it smelled.  We did eat it but wouldn't make it again.  Also, the wonton strips did not take 20 minutes for me to bake - they burned after 10 minutes in my oven and I had to make them a second time.

I had a luncheon at my house for 6 and didn't know about it till 3 hrs before!  I made this exactly as written, (I never do that, I like to add my own special touch.  no time for that!)  It was perfect as is.  I paired it with the Butternut Squash Soup recipe and my guest ate every bite and asked for more soup.  Everything was gone, they loved it!!!

This is way better than the chicken salad my family loves to get at a local restaurant. I actually did the sauce in triplicate because my Dad loves to put extra on his salad. I poached the chicken in broth so that it would be very moist and tender and have some good flavor (for about 15 mins on med heat, halfway covered in broth or stock). I also added julien sliced red and orange bell pepper for flavor. I didn't want to turn on my oven in the heat, so I sprinkled the top with chow mein noodles after tossing and served with them on the side so ppl could add as they choose. Next time, instead of tossing the salad ahead of time with dressing, I will serve it with the dressing on the side. It caused my romaine lettuce to wilt a little too much. I was unable to find chili paste at my grocery store, so I substituted Hot Garlic Chili sauce, and it added a nice flavor without too much heat. I will def. continue to cook this as a meal in the summer since I love a one dish meal.  Delicious!!

My 14 year old, picky-extreme son said this is "sick".  Which in teen-speak is a 5 star.  We all loved it.  Added a few chopped peanuts for texture.  Didn't have chili paste on-hand so just used red pepper flakes.  Also held the carrots because they make my son nervous :-)  Wonderful.

really good, I use half the Pbutter though to cut down on the fat, and pump up the spice a bit with some hot sauce. YUM! Sometimes I roast sesame seeds adn throw in as well.

We added a full tsp of chili paste, lots more ginger, and some fresh garlic minced very finely. Added 1 less tbl of vinegar. Red pepper matchsticks make it even prettier, chopped up peanuts adds a nice final touch too. Delicious!

This was really good and the longer the dressing sits the better it is. I also added some juice from mandarin oranges to the dressing. I baked the chicken on 350 for about 35 minutes and I basted it with hoisin sauce....yum

2 tablespoons peanut butter seemed a bit much.  If I make this again, I will start with a teaspoon and work my way up.  The peanut was all we could taste in the dressing.  Boyfriend and 2 kids all said: with a different dressing, this would be a wonderful meal.

This is the most addicting salad I have ever tasted. I did alter a bit to suit my tastes. I used natural peanut butter a little less than called for, I did not have rice vinegar so I used a combo of lemon juice and white vinegar.I also used ramen noodles uncooked and half the flavor packet to the sauce. The grated fresh ginger is the key to this recipe! I also like thinly chopped celery and cabbage in the salad. 5*

I added fish sauce to the dressing and some lime juice instead of the rice vinegar.  I also added bean thread noodles to the salad and skipped on the wontons.  Loved the flavours thanks!

This salad is all about the dressing and it is addictive!!! Following the suggestions of previous reviewers, I decreased the peanut butter by half and found it to be the right amount. I also used 1 teaspoon of chili paste b/c we like spicy things and it was great. I also added crunchy chow mein noodles and mandarin oranges to the salad. I also fried my wontons rather than baking them. This was a huge family hit and I will certainly make it again.

The salad itself was okay.  It is the dressing that gives it punch.  I could see this better as a wrap though.

This is a great salad but I made a few changes.  The wontons were a NIGHTMARE and after they burned long before the cooking time ended, I added salad sensations nuts/Asian mix for an easier and better flavor.  I also added Paul Newman's ginger/sesame dressing which enhanced the sauce in the recipe.  With these 2 changes, the salad is fabulous! (Note--the Paul Newman's dressing is spicy and my husband preferred it without).

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  The only thing I didn't use was the hot chile paste.  I did add a couple tablespoons of water to thin the sauce out just a little.  Great recipe!

My husband LOVED this recipe!  He is not one to volunteer a comment but the first time I made this he told me he really liked it and thought it tasted better than the ones he has eaten in restaurants.  By the way, that is HUGE because we live in the SF Bay Area and he eats out daily for work lunches and he travels for business all over the US.  He even asked me to make it the following night!  I stuck to the recipe except I added some chopped roasted peanuts and I used fried maifun noodles instead of the wonton wrappers.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thank You!

Though I like this salad, the flavor was a bit strong near the end, maybe it was all the green onions. Not my #1 choice for Chinese Chicken salad, but good for a change.

It was very tasty, but the sauce was so thick it was like glue. I prefer a more watered-down dressing so it disperses more evenly among the items in the salad.

Since I'm not really a peanut-butter-sandwich person, I made this salad to take in my school lunches.  Even my (very picky) friends enjoyed it.  I added water chesnuts for the crunch factor.

Wow, the sauce was incredible!  This salad was just like the Chinese chicken salad at the Cheesecake Factory restaurant!  I think next time I'll use 1/2 tsp. hot chili paste instead of 3/4 tsp. (was a tad too hot for me).  I used 1/2 Tbl. sesame oil instead of 1 Tbl. because I find that oil to be very strong, and I wanted to decrease the fat a bit.  Didn't change the flavor at all!  I also added thinly sliced red bell pepper, and increased the cilantro to 1/2 cup (big cilantro fan).  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Thank you for a TERRIFIC salad.  My family loves it!  We usually do salads several times a week as our dinner in the summer and this salad is *wonderful*  I added more cilantro, as we love it but besides that, I wouldn't change a thing!

While a very tasty salad, the dressing is very thick and the peanut butter should be cut back, it overpowers the other flavors.  Lots of preparation needed for this salad.

Great Salad! Leftovers keep well if dressing &
wontons are added at the last minute. ** If you
are making more than 4 servings be sure to double
check quantities needed. I found a few errors in
the system.

This is excellent, this is the first recipe that I have tried from this site but if it is any indication of others I will be a regular visitor.  This is a fabulous salad, I did decide to deep fry the won-ton wrappers instead of baking, but it was the only change I made..

Love how easy this is! I leave out cilantro as I don't enjoy the taste and use store bought wonton strips as they are easier to find. The dressing is the best part about this recipe!

Fabulous sauce!!  I made my own hosein sauce (very easy) and added a can of drained mandarin oranges and toasted almonds to the salad.  Next time I'll use creamy peanut butter instead of chunky for a better texture. This is definitely a new favorite!!

Sauce is great, needs a little more oil though as you can't pour it.  I baked the wontons, 6-7 min at 350 and they were perfect.

This was delicious!  The dressing is fantastic, though very thick. It was thick even though I cut the peanut butter by half, so I added some lime infused olive oil and as other reviewers suggested, juice from the mandarin oranges. Also as another reviewer mentioned I sautéed the chicken then added hoisin sauce to coat and since the hoisin is thick it clings to the chicken and does add great flavor. I cut the wonton skins into ribbons with a pizza roller and was surprised how good they were. This one is a keeper for sure. Oh - forgot to say skip the brown sugar if you’re carb conscious- you won’t miss it a bit. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious salad!  The dressing is superb!  The only change I made was omitting the green onions but that is just due to personal preference.  My wontons were done much quicker than 20 mins so keep a close eye on them.

The dressing on this salad has a very good flavor. Everyone liked. We added cucumber just because we had some in the refrigerator. We thought it might also be good with edamame and peanuts.

I loved it.  I altered the dressing a little by leaving out the sugar, it's plenty sweet with out it. And I double the sesame oil to thin it out.  There is enough salad dressing for two servings, but definitely not four. I doubled it and it turned out great.

The sauce is exceptional and I highly recommend the dish.
My dressing came out a little thick for our tastes, but a little water thinned it out just fine.
We've had it twice now- not a bad recommendation.

Awesome recipe...I always follow exactly as written but today I had to deviate because I ran out of sesame oil and rice vinegar. I used a little vegetable oil and added soy sauce. For the rice vinegar I used Sherry and Vermouth...turned out great! I was nervous not having the ingredients but relieved it tasted so good. So, if you're in a pinch...great subs! Thank you for the fantastic recipe

I made it 3 times.  The first time I forgot the brown sugar. It was perfect!  So I left the sugar out, on purpose, the next two times. I had some left over fried chicken,  used that instead of making more chicken. 
Lovely salad.

So yummy!  I made it per recipe and then tasted the dressing  and tweaked it to my taste.  I added an extra teaspoon of peanut butter and a teaspoon of honey.  So good...  even my kids loved it!

Good salad! The only thing that went wrong for me was that even less than 20 min at 350 degrees was enough to burn the wonton skins. At first I thought my oven temp was off, but I did one batch in the regular oven and the other batch in the toaster oven and both burned at about 10 min. So 350 may be too hot and 20 min is definitely too long. But the rest of the salad was delicious, especially the dressing!

I made this exactly as written and realized it needed some serious fixing up (dressing did, anyway).  First, I heated it up until the brown sugar melted into it to help the gritty-ish texture.  Then I added a teaspoon extra of the rice wine vinegar and the sesame oil.  I added a tablespoon of lime juice and a teaspoon of soy sauce.  After all the extra effort, it was fairly tasty.  I would still only rate it maybe 4 stars- it's just too thick of a dressing for me.  But hubby gave it 5 stars.

I loved this although I had to make some changes due to not having everything on hand. I used Thai red curry paste instead of the chili. I didn't have wontons so just left them out. also only had spinach, no romaine. even with the subs,this was delicious.

It was a good salad dressing, family enjoyed it.  I made it just as the recipe called for.  My own touches were a salad using  Romain lettuce, green onion, bok choy and chopped garlic. I tossed the salad with a small amount of lite lime dressing.  On each plate I arranged chicken and rice noodles on top of the salad and drizzled the peanut dressing on top.  (Didn't fry wantons due to lack of time)

We very much enjoyed this recipe, and by "enjoyed" I mean inhaled.  Yes, the dressing is thick and we prefer it thinned down to easily pour vs. glob over the salad.  Simply thin down with water or orange juice, as mentioned in another review.  I  often make a triple batch and store in the fridge alongside our other favorite homemade dressings, it keeps well for several weeks.  Our favorite rendition of this recipe is to use sunflower butter in place of peanut butter and have also used almond butter.  The almonds really stand up, flavor wise.  The sunflower butter is wonderfully rich yet mellow so I'll often reduce the hoisin sauce by a tablespoon.  Wonderful recipe that can easily be tweaked to your tastebud's preferences!

Great recipe! However, my wonton crisps didn't turn out like how I expected them to (like the picture), but it was still delicious! Followed the sauce recipe pretty much to the T but added a tad more siracha sauce-- fabulous! Definitely making this one again.

Delicious!  I took suggestions from other reviewers and added mandarin oranges, adding a little bit of their liquid to the dressing.  One other thing that I did was, before grilling the breasts, I sprinkled on some five spice powder and applied i like a rub--really added nice flavor to the meat!   Also, I baked the won ton wrapper slices and they were fantastic!  Mine tasted just like deep fried...I just sprayed them good with canola cooking spray before baking.  Can't see why anyone would go to the trouble and mess of deep frying.  I told my hubby that next time I might try using some rotisserie chicken and crispy chow mein noodles to make it even easier and he said, "don't change a thing!"

I need to stop listening to reviews and just try the recipe as written first. I added a little mandarin orange juice to the dressing and now it tastes diluted. It basically ruined the salad which makes me upset because I only have a limited amount of time to cook and I want my efforts to amount to something edible. Reviews can be helpful, but unfortunately I've been led astray by a few bad ones in recent weeks.

Try the recipe as written! It was wonderful before I decided to take some bad advice. Perhaps a little less hoisin sauce, but that's because I'm watching my sodium intake. Very good recipe. Make your own adjustments instead of listening to other people!

The whole family enjoyed this quite a bit. Made a few minor substitutions- didn't have hoisin like I thought, so used teriyaki sauce. Put in a squirt of lime juice in the dressing. Purposefully used fried chow mein noodles because the husband has had a hankering for them. And cooked the chicken in sesame oil and a little teriyaki in a saute pan. Otherwise everything was the same and quite delicious! We think next time we'd like to add avocado, even though that's more California fusion than Chinese, but we think the creamy fattiness of the avocado would pair nicely with the spicy and bright flavors.

We included this salad in the food served at our backyard party, our goal being to prepare foods that could be served cold whenever everyone climbed out of the pool and wanted to eat.  The dressing was a little too strong for our tastes, but having read the reviews, I also included the lime vinaigrette, with just a drizzle of the hoisin-peanut dressing, and it worked perfectly that way. We would definitely make this again.

Glad to have this recipe finally after eating this incredible salad.  It was a little on the milder side (it is usually hotter when ordered in a Chinese restaurant).  I will add red pepper flakes next time.

Tasted fabulous.  I would probably add some oil or something to thin the dressing out a little as it was a bit pasty.  But delicious nonetheless!  I actually made extra of this honey chicken recipe and simply made the salad with leftovers http://allrecipes.com/recipe/yummy-honey-chicken-kabobs/detail.aspx

bf liked this more than i did.. i felt the dressing was a lil too peanut-y for me.. but we had no problems devouring the whole thing.. used ramen in place of the wonton wrappers.. i totally forgot the carrots.. doh!.. didn't have the brown sugar so i just left it out.. used bbq sauce in place of hoisin.. used dried instead of fresh ginger.. ty for the recipe ~~~~UPDATE.. so i did this a second time.. and figured i probably just used too much PB the first time.. but even after going strictly by the PB amount.. it was still too much PB for me.. only change to the dressing this time was to double the chili sauce.. added half a cup of bean sprouts.. 10 baby corn chopped up.. doubled the cilantro.. forgot the ramen ugh.. and only had 3/4 lb of chicken breast.. i liked it MUCH more this time..

I loved this, but my husband thought the peanut dressing was too sweet, and the kids just didn't care for peanut in their salad. :(

Yummy a home run!!  I did add a red pepper and mandrinn oranges.  I was afraid the chicken would be bland with out a marinade but it would of been to much if had anythingelse other than salt and pepper on it.

Excellent salad that is satisfying enough for a main dish. There are so many delicious flavors and textures mixed in here. To make life a little easier, I skipped the wontons and added chinese noodles instead. I'm making it again tonight!

I had to alter this recipe a little - didn't have hoisin sauce and didn't want to wait, so used sweet chili sauce in the dressing instead.  cut out the brown sugar.  Still, it is a fantastic dressing, and over crisp veggies and crunchy noodles, this was the best chinese chicken salad I've ever had!  This dressing would work well as a dip for chicken skewers, egg rolls, and pot stickers.  Delicious!

This salad was by far one of the best chinese chicken salads I have ever had, even betther than most restaurants. My husband had three servings. The only changes I made was that I bought the wontons pre made to save time and I bought some General Tso's chicken at the deli cut it up into strips and put it in the salad rather than using plain chicken. We will definitely be making this again.

I started a membership just so I could review this recipe.  We made this for our Monday night girls' night this week and everyone loved it.  The dressing is to die for, and would make a great marinade on meats as well.  The only change we made was that we bought the prepackaged crunchy salad noodles.  I will make this again!

This was even better than those at the restaurants! The dressing has a slight kick that really makes it great. As stated in some other reviews the dressing is slightly thick so i did add another tablespoon of sesame oil and one of veggie oil. i also shredded the romaine instead to mimic my favorite restaurant's style and did 1/2 lettuce and 1/2 napa cabbage. i also marinaded my chicken in a store bought marinade  because we don't dig plain chicken. everything turned out great. even without changes this recipe is a surely keeper.

OMGosh! This is a family favorite. My mother-in-law always requests this salad when we visit. The only changes I make to the recipe is instead of using wonton skins, I roast some slivered almonds & crushed up ramen noodles on 325 for about 10-25 minutes. Then top the salad with that. It adds a wonderful crunch & a fantastic flavor.

I left out half of the peanut butter, and used vegetable oil because I didn't have any sesame. Also left out the chili paste, but added a pinch of red pepper flakes. Took others' advice by adding a can of manrarin oranges to the salad and some of the juice to thin the dressing. My last change was to cook the chicken in hoisin sauce. The end result was very good. My mom said it was the best Oriental salad she's had.

Hmmm.. not what I was expecting.  The dressing tasted a little off. I did add the mandarin juice, which salvaged it I think.  My husband did say it was "ridiculous!", so I will give it 4**'s. Don't think I'll be making it again, though.

We love this recipe! I've made it over and over again. However, I do add either water or mandarin orange juice to thin out the dressing to the right consistency and I also don't bother with the wontons--I just add crispy chow mein noodles. A really great salad--makes a perfect light dinner or lunch.

I loved the dressing!  I didn't have the chili sauce so used chili oil (with the chili peppers in it) and it turned out great.  I also used Napa cabbage instead since that's what I had.  I think it would be great with sliced red peppers, snow peas, water chestnuts, etc. The one thing I wasn't so keen on was the wontons. I didn't particularly like the way they came out baked in teh oven. While I appreciate the lower fat content, I would have prefered mine fried.

At first I didn't like this dressing as much as the other Asian style dressings I usually make.  But the spiciness and peanut butter are not usual ingredients in a chinese chicken salad dressing, and by the end of my bowl of salad, I was ready for a refill.  I didn't even add chicken or wonton skins, and it was still great.  I used green leaf lettuce, though, because that's what I had, and I wouldn't recommend that.  The lettuce was wilted right away.  Stick with romaine or other crunchy things like cabbage or iceberg.

Rave reviews from the family.  Sauce is excellent.  I followed other reviewers and thinned the sauce with the juice from mandarin oranges although I did not care for them in the salad.

This is exceptionally good, it is a bit on the more peanut buttery side, but altering the ingredients works perfectly. This recipe reminds me more of a vietnamese flare than Chinese - we will definitely be making again - thanks for sharing!

Loved it.  I was lazy and used broken Top Ramen noodles for crunchiness instead of the won ton wrappers.  Also added sliced red bell pepper and sunflower seeds.  The dressing is wonderful.  Served this for some friends, all five of them went home with the recipe; they liked it so much.

Excellent recipe for a change from the usual.  Added a jullienned red peppe and some celery sliced on the diagonal.  Made with and without the lettuce.  Prefer carrots jullienned instead of shredded.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Loved it!!  I didn't have a couple of ingedients, so I used toasted ramen noodles with slivered almonds and omitted the chili paste.  It was great, but I think my husband would have liked it spicier.  Can't wait to try it with the wontons.

I made this into a stir fry and it was great hot too.  I only gave it four stars because it was a little thick.  Otherwise it tasted great and I will make it again.

This was wonderful.  The dressing was what made the salad.  I made it for company and everyone loved it.  The only suggestion I have is to not cook the wonton wrappers for so long.  Mine burnt when I baked them.

Great salad!  Looked like something served at a restaurant, and tasted even better!  Made a great meal!  (a couple of them actually, this makes a lot.)  I followed the recipe exactly, (slightly work-intensive with many ingredients,) and would make it again the same way.

Very tasty and healthy salad. Dressing was exceptional. Baked won-ton added excellent texture to the salad. Girlfiend gave it a 4.5 mark.

I just brought this to a party and everybody raved about it. The dressing was outrageously delicious. (I added slivered almonds to the salad and omitted the sugar from the dressing.)

This salad was excellent.  I did not have rice vineger so I used white wine vinegar.  I also fried wonton squares (two stuck together at a time)..they puffed up and turned golden brown.  This reminded me of the Luau salad from the Cheesecake Factory.

A big YUM for you Teri! I cut back on the brown sugar and skipped the cilantro. OMG, this was great and thanks so very much!

The tastes just didn't seem to combine properly, though we followed the recipe to a tee. Out of our family of ten, only my husband cleaned his plate. It was very disappointing.

Fantastic! Cooking it again tonight and hoping that I've made enough for leftovers this time! Only things I changed were due to not being able to find them in the grocery- instead of rice wine vinegar, I used red wine vinegar. And instead of red chili paste, used red curry paste. I also took someone's advice and dumped a bit of hoisin and sesameoil on the chicken before sticking it in the oven. Delicious.

My family loved this!  As written I gave it four - with a few changes - it's 10!!!
I put a few tbs. of hoisin sauce on cut up strips of boneless breast, tossed to coat, covered tightly in foil and baked for 40 mins at 350.  It gives the chicken such terrific flavor!!
I also added water chestnuts, julienned jicama and sliced mushrooms to the salad!  The dressing was a little thick, so I added a couple tbs of water to thin.  In the end - both my finicky eaters rated it a 9 out of 10!  Thanks for sharing this one.

The dressing is expecially good.  I took others' suggestions and drained mandarin orange juice into dressing to thin it out.  Also, I added more fresh vegies and substituted chow mein noodles for wontons.  I will make this often, especially in the summer!

Delicious dressing! Better than any I have tasted in a restaurant. I skipped the wonton wrappers, used chow mein noodles and added water chestnuts and pea pods. I also used the suggestion of adding mandarin oranges and adding some of the juice to the dressing. Perfect!
