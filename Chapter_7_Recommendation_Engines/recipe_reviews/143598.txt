A hugh hit at my dinner party! Some changes I made, was to mix Italian seasoned bread crumbs in with the other ingedients before stuffing. I omitted the cheese and Alfredo sauce for a lower calorie dish and everyone loved them. Will definately add to my favorites!

I also made these tonight to go with the pasta salad. And I must say, these are INCREDIBLE. I made them exactly as written (I'm trying to stick to the recipes as closely as I can from now on...) and I dont think I would change a thing. They were salty, creamy, buttery... heaven on a plate. I think I might make another batch this weekend if the mushrooms look good. Thank you!

I made these for a potluck and they were a hit! I used baby bella mushrooms, substituted provolone cheese for the jack and omitted the alfredo sauce. Good eats!

Good flavor, but the amount of butter it called for made it way too greasy for my taste, sorry, won't be making these again.

Awesome - made a couple of minor adjustments. Used just enough butter to moisten the mixture and substituted Parmesan and Romano cheeses for the Montery Jack. Didn't use the alfredo sauce either. Yum!!!

These were delicious! I added about a tablespoon of cream cheese to the mix. I made some with diced bacon, and some without bacon, and they were both equally delicious. I only gave this four stars because the recipe calls for waaaaay too much butter and it's a waste because I didn't even end up using half of the filling. Next time I will use less than half the butter the recipe calls for, and maybe I'll add some crab to the mix. Even my picky husband liked these! =)
