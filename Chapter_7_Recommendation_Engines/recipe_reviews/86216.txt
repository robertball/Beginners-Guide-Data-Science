Although I tried following the directions, the textures weren't right (too much "slicing") and the portions were HUGE...  this would feed 8+ people!  (This was after already cutting down ingredients.)  Next time, I'm going to swap the carrots and radishes for another reviewer's suggestion of olives and cherry tomatoes.  And I'm definitely going to halve this to meet our household's needs.  A good idea, but too many changes to make it a straight 5-star recipe as it stands.

This is a great summertime recipe! I added a pint of grape tomatoes, a can of sliced black olives and instead of regular italian dressing I used Kraft's Ceaser Italian With Oregano to accent the romane hearts! thanks!

I was skeptical about this, but it was filling and tasty for dinner.
