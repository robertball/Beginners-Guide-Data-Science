These were really good! I thought they were going to be bland and need ranch dressing or ketchup, but I ate two helpings without anything on it and was very happy with the taste.

This was delicious and a huge hit!!  I used Avocado oil, 2 large red potatoes, skin on, green onions and shallots, 3 cut up sausage patty's, one red bell pepper, my own seasonings and Mexican cheese blend i had on hand. Topped it with over medium eggs and hot sauce. Divine!!!

This recipe is great when you've got a bunch of leftover veggies and nothing to do with them! You're gonna wanna add your own salt or seasonings bc it's not really super tasty on its own.

Loved the recipe. I only made a few modifications.  I'm not a huge Canadian Bacon fan so I substituted crispy bacon (aprox. 8-10 pieces).  I also used a mixture of the white scallions and shallot. I topped the potatoes with the green scallions and had sour cream as a side dish. Everyone loved this at brunch.

I made this with a few additions and it was GREAT. The fresh potatoes I par cooked in the microwave 3 min, then diced.. cooking about 5 min alone in pan. To this I added 2 sliced links of hot italian sausage, and a handful of real bacon bits (instead of sliced bacon). When almost browned add 2 eggs and gently scramble in the center, along with the fresh basil and stirred it all together. This made a filling breaky scamble that was easy, and delicious.

I made this for my teenage son before practice this morning. Sometimes its hard to get him to eat but he had two helpings!

I added some ranch dressing mix for extra flavor since I was missing basil and canadian bacon...
