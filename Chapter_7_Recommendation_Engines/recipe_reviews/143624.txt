First of all, I did not follow recipe exactly.  So I am rating this on my changes.  I did not add chipotle chili peppers because Ive seen this recipe before and it didnt have them in the recipe and I wanted something I could use for anything.  Kids dont like spicy.  I used 2 cups of olive oil becauce  I like to use the oil for pan frying.  Used 1/2 cup lime juice and 1 tsp of salt. Dont waste your time chopping garlic, just keep them whole and put them in your baking dish with the salt and oil.   Cook this in the oven at 325* for about an hour then added lime juice, put it back in the oven for another 25 mins or until golden brown.  Slow cooking this is the key.  I used potato masher to mash the garlic up.  Possibilities are endless with this one.  Use your imagination.  I made plain spagetti noodle pasta and added this to it with some parmasan and extra salt.  Sooo good.  You can also make this with popcorn.  I also heard this lasts forever as long as the garlic is covered in oil and its kept in the fridge, but I cant testify to that because we eat it too fast to know.

This was just SO delicious! I tossed it with grilled shrimp, zucchini, and red and green peppers. Next time, I'll add mushrooms. The chipotles gave it a wonderful smoky flavor, and the garlic was nice and sweet--not too strong at all (but you have to cook it on low; otherwise it could become bitter). Easy to make, as well. It's worth it to try to find the dried chipotles--canned ones in adobo wouldn't give you the same flavor.

Had this in Mexico, on fish - WOW!!! Soo happy I found this recipe. I cut it down to smaller proportions as we are just the two of us - but, we love garlic!

I tried this brushed over grilled shrimp - after reading the recipe I just had to brave the Chicago cold and fire up the grill and it was so worth it.  Fantastic recipe!

This "sauce" is basically an infused olive oil. It has great flavor and smell. (Not so good the next morning when I could still smell it throughout the house.)For a huge time saver, I used a chopped garlic that I purchased in jar, drained and rinsed. I put in only three chipotle because I was worried it was gonna be too spicy. I went back later and added three more to the jar. Great flavor to keep on hand for just about anything that requires olive oil. I used it for sauteed kale and white beans.

I moved to Mexico and I had this at a local food spot. So I had to make it. So far so good.

havent tried it yet but it sounds good. has anyone tried just putting all the ingrediants in a cuisinart (after the peppers have rehydrated) and blending everything together- then marinating meat or veggies in it?
sounds good :)
