Trying to find simple and healthy recipes to cook.  This was GREAT but I did add a few additions.  Added a clove of fresh garlic chopped, a leaf of chopped fresh basil, and added a teaspoon of bread crumbs.  I melted the butter and added the tomatoes, garlic, bread crumbs, lemon juice and spices to make a mixture.  Then put the mixture on top of the flounder and baked as directed.  Thanks for the recipe.

We love this recipe - it is sooo easy.  However, instead of using fresh tomatoes - I just pour over the fish a 15 1/2 oz. can of diced tomatoes with garlic and onion (undrained).  I also sprinkle on some garlic powder.  Fast and easy to make.  We love to serve it with broccoli.

We loved this, Susan.  Instead of plain basil, I used an Italian dried herb mix as this was all I had on hand.  I used extra tomato as others have suggested and also topped the fish with 2 tbsp of grated parmesan.  The fish was so moist this way.  I used a cheap fish from the supermarket and was amazed that the dish still tasted superb.  This goes well with baked potatoes and the sauteed garlic asparagus recipe from this site.

This is a very simple but very flavorful recipe!!  You can adjust spices to your particular liking.  I used diced tomatoes from a can that were already seasoned with basil , oregano and garlic.

I use this same basic recipe with frozen tilapia and sole about once a week, only varying the cooking time depending on how delicate or thin the fish is. I also usually do it in a skillet instead of the oven, so the fish doesn't overcook. Diced vine-ripened tomatoes is much better than canned. And I always add wine, letting it cook down and poach the fish a little after it's cooked in the butter and garlic.

This was great!! I made two adjustments based off of what I had on hand, I used 2 cloves fresh garlic diced, and a added a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomato. I really liked this! My husband and son thought it was ok, but I really enjoyed the flavor the seasonings gave to the tomatoes and the fish. I will definitely make this again! We served it with steamed green beans and linguine.

i am new to cooking fish and wanted a quick easy recipe.. found it! i read some other reviews and decided to tweak it the first time. Had some sole fillets, so i used those. I also used olive oil instead of butter. Then in the oil mixed the diced tomatoes with fresh crushed garlic, crushed chili peppers, dill, basil, oregano, salt & pep.  I wanted to use bread crumbs but didn't have any on hand, so i chopped 4 almonds very fine and mixed that in too! Broiled until flaky! Dee-lish!

I would give this a higher review, but I think according to the recipe, you are bound to over-cook your flounder. It probably only needs to be in the oven for about 20 mins, tops.   The topping was great - I also used fresh basil, tomatoes and garlic, and topped with some fresh grated parmesan, but the fish itself was dry from being over cooked.

My family and I absolutely love this recipe! I make it every other week and we never get sick of it (including a toddler!!!). It is quick, easy, and delicious. I mix the softened butter, with cut up tomatoes, and spices in a bowl first, and then pour it on the fish. I sprinkle a bit of breadcrumbs on top before popping it in the oven. I usually serve it with brown rice and a veggie of some sort (sauteed zucchini/squash, broccoli, green beans). Enjoy!

Delicious!  I halved the recipe for two fillets and it came out perfectly.  I did not try adding the cheese but it was great without it. Next time I might add a little more diced tomato.  Easy!

This was very easy to make and tasted great.  I made it exactly as the recipe states (without the cheese.)  Definitely will make it again.

Amazing and easy flounder recipe!!! Although I used one pound of flounder, olive oil to grease dish, Italian Herbs instead of just basil, fresh green onions, fresh garlic, 2 tablespoons of butter and deli american cheese. It was AMAZING!!!! I made Near East brand Wild Mushroom & Herb Rice Pilaf to go with the flounder: THE PILAF WENT AMAZINGLY WELL WITH THE FLOUNDER! I highly recommend this. (Oh and I baked the fish for 20 minutes then broiled it a bit for 2 minutes).  This was one of the best recipes ever. Thank you so much!

Okay for what it is, bland fish and tomatoes.  Needs a lot extra spices.  Add some spinach for another vegetable and try serving over pasta w/ some olive oil.

I'm a busy Mom, wife, teacher, and grad. school student online so I have hardly any time.  This is WONDERFUL recipe!  It's restaurant quality and so easy to make.  I did add a little Italian seasoning to it and added an Italian shredded cheese combination I've been getting for years.  It has asiago, mozzarella, parmesan, and american cheese in it.  This was WONDERFUL and I'm definitely adding it to my rotation of meals.  My husband seemed to like it and cleaned his plate.

This was delicious! Covering the fish really helped for the flavors of the toppings to seep into the fish. I used fresh garlic and fresh basil. I also didn't find that the fish needed to cook for 30 minutes. My fillets were very thin, so it was more like 10-15 minutes. Make sure to not over cook! Chewy fish is bad fish.

Yum! I am so glad I found this recipe. I needed something fast and had to use what I had on hand and this worked like a charm! I used thawed flounder fillets, from my freezer. I changed it up a little in order to use what I had - 2 cloves fresh garlic, a little white wine, some salt & paprika, some mild salsa in place of the fresh tomatoes,a few leaves of fresh basil from my garden, and added green beens. After cooking for about 20 minutes, I uncovered the dish and sprinkled on some shredded mozzarella cheese and let it melt over everything. I WISH I had made rice to go with it because the liguid created by all of the ingredients was delightful and would have been so good over the rice. Next time... Thanks! With my changes/variations, I give 5 stars!

Very quick, easy, and tasty!  I used garden produce I had frozen from last season.  I used home-grown tomatoes and added a few pepperes that I had also simply frozen straight from the garden, let semi-thaw and then easily sliced over the flounder.

Loved it.  Used fresh chopped garlic vs garlic powder, but otherwise perfect.  Flounder doesn't get dry, and the whole recipe just tastes healthy and fresh.

Very easy but not a great amount of flavor.   I substituted  to 2 tbs butter, 2 garlic cloves and seasoned with 1 tsp pepper and still felt like it could use a little more of something.  Will try it again and season the fish first next time.

This was pretty good. I only cooked it for 20 minutes or else it would have been overdone. I went a little easier on the garlic and basil as it seemed like a lot for just 2 pieces. Next time I'll try the recommended amounts.

My family enjoyed this recipe, but I did make a couple of modifications to the recipe.  I omitted the butter. I substituted dried Italian Seasonings instead of dry basil, and in place of fresh tomato I used a 14.5 oz can of basil, garlic & oregano flavored diced tomatoes drained.

What a healthy and delicious flounder dish!  (Although I'm sure you could use other types of fish.)  I, too, used canned diced tomatoes and seasoned with garlic powder and Italian spices.  Next time I might add capers for a little "zing".  Can't wait to try this when the fresh tomatoes are in season.

used 2 cans of diced tomatoes, upped the garlic powder and basil and added a little oregano -- sprinkled locatelli cheese on the top and baked.

Very good.

Followed the recipe as written and ended up with a soggy fish that fell apart.  My guess is that the fish was just frozen too long, so next time I will use fresh fish.

For what it is--very quick and very simple food--I give it a 4. Tastes good, not fabulous, but if you want great you better have more time and ingredients to spare (usually)! Added some fresh parsley on top, together with a little paprika and some red pepper flakes. Presented it with brown rice, steamed broccoli and a glass of wine...a decent and healthy meal I wouldn't mind making again!  Oh by the way, 20 minutes is enough on this one.

It was ok. Some came out ok, some too mushy. I'd recomment to bake as less as possible, 30 minutes was too much.

We all liked this really well. The flavor was great and it was a nice change from how I usually like fish. My only complaint was the amount of liquid in the bottom of the dish. I took the foil off half way and still it was fairly watery. We will be making this again for sure.

Delicious and cooks to perfection.  I halved the recipe and used a chunky tomato salsa as I had no tomatoes available.  In spite of the Mexican influence this dish has a decided Italian flavor.  We love it.

To simplify prep, I used a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes with garlic, onion and basil (no sodium added) and added some additional fresh garlic. I also used 3T of fresh squeezed lemon juice. It is definitely an easy to make healthy meal for during the week.

tried this one last night. Followed exactly except I used Rotel instead of regular tomatoes, since I needed to use it up. I didn't think the combination of seasonings did much for the fish.

Not bad for diet food, but all in all very bland.  Needed something more to give it a little flavor, but was very tender.

My husband is the one who usually cooks fish dishes. I made this for him tonight and he loved it. I did used fresh tomatoes and Italian Seasoning also added bread crumbs. It only took about 15 minutes to cook. I served it over a bed of rice. I will definately make it again. Next time I am going to try it with shrimp.

Simple, quick and inexpensive. I found that 30 minutes was WAY too long for baking, but my filets were pretty thin. I didn't have tomatoes on hand, so I used homemade salsa instead and sprinkled some part-skim mozzarella cheese on top, it turned out very well.

This was not good at all!  The fish came out very mushy as others have said.  It may be because I used frozen flounder.  It was very watery and tasteless. It ruined our entire meal.

This is one of my favorite discoveries on AllRecipes.com. It's both simple to make and flavorful. I usually substitute turbo for flounder and it always comes out great, although I do cut down the cooking time from 30 minutes to about 20-25, as some of the other reviewers have suggested. Thanks for the great recipe.

I used flounder that had been frozen, and I pressed out as much of the water as I possibly could.  I also reduced the cooking time as others suggested and this stil come out mushy.  The flavor was okay, but it was overshadowed by the mushiness of the fish.

Overall taste was good but it was very very mushy.  We couldn't get past the consistancy to even eat it.  Maybe the flounder was not fresh, maybe too much liquid in the reccipe - I'm not sure what went wrong.

This recipe came out mushy, mushy, mushy!!!!  The only thing I did different from the recipe was to use diced tomatoes (drained) from a can.

I really liked this dish!  I used a little more butter, and melted it with minced garlic in the microwave, then poured over fish.  Used Italian seasoning, and about 1 1/2 cups of fresh tomatoes.  I sprinkled top with parmesan cheese.  I found that it had a little too much liquid in pan (don't know how to correct that), but the taste was great, and fish was very moist and flavorful.  Will make again!

4 stars is the average from me (3) and my husband (5)!  Very easy dish to prepare - I used canned diced tomatoes and added in some grated parm, bread crumbs and minced garlic for flavor, plus a sprinkle of Old Bay and some Italian Seasoning.  Very tasty but the tomato flavor almost overpowered the fish.

Tweaked thi a bit based on previous comments.  Sprinkled "old bay" on the fillets to spice it up a bit, used canned diced tomatoes (no fresh ones on hand), added a little white cooking wine over everything.  A good recipe when you are trying to throw together dinner with whatever is on hand.  My 4 year old loved it!

This has become my go to fish recipe. It's super easy to do. I use any white fish, really, but usually flounder. I add some fresh basil to the tomato/onion/garlic mix, and a bread crumb and herb mix to the top. The one thing you have to watch out for is all the extra liquid. So be sure that your fish (if frozen like mine) are drained well. Make sure the tomatoes are drained well if you use canned. (I prefer fresh, but canned works in a pinch.) Also, a quick splash of lemon initially, before dressing with tomatoes and bread crumbs never hurts and adds a little something. All in all, I love this one and it is both husband and kid approved. :)

Simple, healthy, and delicious. I added a dash of white wine and capers to mine, and I cooked it uncovered for 15 minutes.  Also traded out the butter for a spritz of olive oil from my Misto.

a little light on flavor, but pretty good for such a fresh and healthy dinner. will make again and probably top with some fresh basil after cooking for additional flavor, and maybe use a fresh lemon. the flounder fillets i used were on the thin side, so it only needed to bake for 15 mins

I made this just as recipe called for, except instead of fresh tomatoes I used a sweet tomato jam I bought at the farmers market. So yummy, hubby loved it and I enjoyed it too, even though I am not a fish fan. Try to eat it once in awhile for the health benifits. Will be making again.

This is great, I change it a little bit each time I make it.  Sometimes I use canned diced tomatoes, sometimes a fresh tomato.  I've used fresh basil, and sometimes dried.  I also use Italian style bread crumbs sprinkled all over the top to give it a little more substance.  Love it!

i didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I was worried about the fish being watery from the tomatoes based on what other reviewers were saying, so I cooked the tomatoes separately and made it a side dish.  I used orange roughy, added much more garlic powder and fried the fish in a frying pan instead of baking it.  Turned out delicious!

Too much juice from fresh chopped tomatoes plus the excessively long cook time made for mushy cardboardy tasting fish. And yes, the fish was fresh today. I just don't like cooked fish, prefer to eat it raw (salmon or tuna) or briefly pan fried. Sorry everybody!

This dish was super mushy. I used frozen flounder filets. Tried to soak out excess water with paper towels first but didn"t help. It would be good with a firmer fish maybe Mahi mahi. Maybe leave it uncovered when baking to soak up some of the moisture.

This was a flop for us.  I am surprised, because it is made of ingredients that we generally really like. The fish came out mushy (maybe because we live in CO & it was frozen vs. fresh?), and the lemon didn't seem to pair well w/ the other flavors...probably won't make again.

I really liked this recipe. I changed the directions slightly by spicing the fish in the baking dish with White, Red and Black peppers, salt, and the basil and then tossing red and yellow peppers in garlic, basil, fresh cracked black pepper, salt and olive oil. I then covered the fish and convection baked it for 25 minutes.   Thanks for the recipe.

Should of followed the recipe. Listened when someone else said to throw in a can of diced tomatoes undrained instead of using fresh tomato. My fish was ruined! Turned out like complete mush! Very disappointed, but not the recipes fault.

I do not like fish, however, I have been lookinf for recipes to make to try to incorporate fish into our meals.  I followed this exactly except I used a can of diced tomatoes with herbs.  ( I do not like store bought tomatoes)  To me, it was edible.  The fish ended up mushy though.  My b/f who does enjoy fish said the recipe was just "ok".

I just realized I forgot to add the butter!  But it was very good regardless. I added the parmesan cheese and extra tomatoes that people suggested, and some adobo.  I mixed the ingredients in a bowl separate from the fish (per another reviewer) and then topped the fish with it. I will make this again.

Good - But I made some changes. I omitted the butter and the tomato (I don't like cooked tomatoes). I used olive oil instead, fresh basil and garlic. I spread it on the flounder and rolled it up. I baked covered to keep the moisture in.

It was good, but nothing to write home about.  My fish was somewhat overcooked after 20 minutes.

My whole family loved this!  Even my 8 year old (who never has seconds) asked for seconds and thirds!  I will definitely fix this frequently.  Thanks for sharing!

I wasn't terribly impressed by this one. Flavor was good, but nothing to write home about. And the fish came out a little on the mushy side. I don't think I'd make this again.

Came out really well and was super easy to make!  The only 'effort' was chopping tomatoes...and it was such a small amount that was needed.  I halved the recipe though--for 4 servings, 2 pounds of fish is a lot.  Family gave 'two thumbs up.'

This was okay.  My hubby gave me a thumbs-down, however because he said it didn't take the strong fishy taste away.  I added more lemon juice and he said it was better.

This is delicious!  My husband said so several times during dinner.  This recipe made my boring flounder fillets into something really special.  The only tweeking I did was using more butter (1 T.), canned diced tomatoes (so I'm guessing it will be even better when made with fresh!), and alittle less basil.  Also, I broiled the fish for 12-15 mins. & it turned out great.  Will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

This very simple recipie was a definite winner in our home. I used a different white fish since flounder wasn't available which worked just as well,  a litte more butter and tomatoes than called for, and 1/2 cup fresh Grana Padano(a nice variation from Parmesean)over the top.  I then served the ensemble over rice with the remaining juices too...my husband loved it and he doesn't normally eat seconds of fish...thanks for the recipie!!!

This was pretty good. I added addtl seasoning to my flounder (oregano, basil, salt, and pepper) and added a sprinkling of parmesan cheese prior to baking. My daughter and husband both enjoyed.

Sorry, but this recipe just didn't do it for us.  We thought we'd give it a try, but even my fish loving husband wasn't thrilled.  I can't really say what it was that wasn't to our liking, but I know I won't be making it again.

I was looking for a quick easy meal to make with ingrediants I already had.  I actually used a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and onions instead. I also used chopped garlic and sprinked with parmesan cheese - DELICIOUS!  My husband loved it and my 5yr old had 2 helpings.  Thanks!

My husband and I enjoyed this dish although the kids wouldn't eat it.  Since some reviewers felt the recipe was bland, I halved the fish but kept the same amount of sauce and felt it was quite tasty.  I also simplified the sauce as follows: Sprinkle fillets with salt, pepper and basil to taste.  Sqeeze 1/2 fresh lemon over fish.  Top with can of diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil (drained).  Bake as directed.

I thought this was an easy and tasty recipe. I used tilapia instead of the flounder. I also used diced grape tomatoes and fresh garlic.It doesn't have a sauce so I may add more butter the next time. I cooked it for 25 minutes which was plenty of time. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very quick, way to cook mild flavored fish without overwhelming the taste. Be very careful with the cooking time! Thin fillets require far less than 30 minutes in the oven.

A couple adjustments made to the original: added panko crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and only baked for 20 mins. I think next time I'll use a higher temperature or just broil it because there's the slightest bit of mushiness to it as is.

I felt the recipe was very bland. I only cooked the fish for 15 minutes and I'm glad because it was cooked perfectly. I might try my own version of this recipe by adding more spices

I will be making it again.I did add fresh cut asparagus from my garden,and some grated coblyjack chess because me husband doesn't like parmesan. It was wonderful. I can't have gluten it seems so I didn't add any bread crumbs as I see others have done.But it was very good.Trying to eat healthy is hard, recipes like this make is so much easier.Thank you for this. We will be having this with little variations as different veggies become ready to eat fresh from the garden.Even the picky kid in the house likes it.

We tried this  recipe to use up some Pollack from our freezer. I had most of the ingredients but the tomatoes,so I substituted frozen mushrooms and red,yellow and green peppers. The fish turned out great and the next time I make it,I'll use fresh tomatoes and the peppers.

TASTY & SIMPLE!  This was so easy to make with ingredients I had on hand.  My only changes were to use fresh basil from the garden and bake only 10 minutes.  I deducted a star because I feel 30 minutes would have over cooked the flounder.  Flounder isn't a very thick fish and doesn't need a long time to bake.  Thank you SUE416 for sharing your recipe!

This recipe was excellent as is except next time I make this I will not use frozen flounder from a package, get your fish from a fish market.

This flounder recipe was another to-die for one. I didn't have any tomatoes or basil, but I  took another reviewer's suggestion and mixed Italian Style breadcrumb mix  with  Smart Balance butter, and fresh minced garlic. I had seasoned the fillets with salt and pepper and grated fresh ginger for a little kick to it, then spread the breadcrumb mixture on top of the fillets, and added dried parsley and thyme. I  baked it at 350 for 25 minutes, then broiled it for 5 minutes for a crispier topping  (I stood there to watch it because I  never leave the broiler unattended).  When I took  the fish out, I had seasoned it with lemon juice, fresh cilantro,  had served with  salad,  garlic/lemon juice-sauteed  steamed asparagus (another delicious recipe that was posted on this site) and with my husband's homemade garlic bread.  It was delicious. Thank you for posting and for the recommendations! :)

My family raved over this recipe.  I used two thin pats of butter on each filet. I added the Fire Roasted w/Garlic diced tomatoes, first I drained the can then spooned then on the founder.  I added Mrs. Dash's Basil and Garlic spice generously and then added some more garlic powder.  I then sprinkled on seasoned Panko bread crumbs and baked for 15 min.  Finished by putting some mozzarella and American cheese on for the last 5 min.  I served it with Spanish rice, broccoli and a salad.  Amazing!!! My husband was blown away!!

I did not care for this recipe. My 1/2 inch thick Flounder filet ended up as a mush. 30 minutes in the oven most likely should be 10 minutes.  I did add some slices of American cheese but I don't see how that could have caused the fish to be so over cooked.

Tasty. I customized it by adding fresh garlic and basil. Yummy. It made a nice fish sauce. With white wine.

Very nice and light.  I would add even more diced tomatoes than called for.  Some grated parmasean cheese on top would be a good addition too.

I followed the recipe exactly but I sliced the tomatoes instead and I used light butter.  Tasted great but the tomatoes probably would have been better if I diced them up.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!
I used Sliced tomatoes  and layed them out nicely on top of the fish. Also I used fresh basil. It was So Aromatic and very light. I will make this again and again. Finally I found a recipe for fish that even I can eat and enjoy! Thank you!!!

My fiance liked this, but I thought it was a little bland.  On the flip side though, this is my first time trying flounder, so it might not have been the recipe at all - just me :-)

This was very good. I would cut back on the salt next time, although my husband loved it like it was.  I also added some bread crumbs to the top.  I would definitely make this again.
