This was so delicious! I made it for tomorrow but my husband got into it. He is not a bread eater so for him to say it was good is quite a compliment! I made a few changes: 1/4 c. oil, 1/4 c. milk, added overipe bananas to the mix, and used only 1 egg. Used 1/2 c. pumpkin. We really liked the taste of the cranberries in this!

Excellent moist bread, not too sweet, perfect for using up my leftover pumpkin and cranberries, thanks!  I made this in a bundt pan and it turned out great.

I made this as a Thanksgiving breakfast bread.  It is so moist and the flavors are wonderful!  I used Craisins and also added chopped walnuts and everyone loved it.  I didn't have the size bread pans indicated by the recipe but it fit fine into 1 pan 9 1/2 x 5 1/2 x 2 1/2.  Will be making this again!!

Mm, thanks Kathryn!  This bread is delicious!  I followed the directions, but had to improvise with the pumpkin pie spices.  It turned out great.  I would not make any changes, but could see it tasting good with diced apples or chocolate chips.  I doubled the recipe and made (2) 8x4 loaves and (3) mini-loaves.  Can't wait to see how it tastes tomorrow.

This bread is great! I made it as a Thanksgiving test recipe and got so many requests for it from my family and my inlaws. Just leave out the cranberries and you've still got a fantastic pumpkin bread recipe. I thought it was great just the way it is!

This bread is elegant in it's simplicity. There are not too many flavours competing, and the absence of walnuts (so common in this type of bread) is refreshing. The cranberry taste comes through loud and clear, with the pumpkin providing a lovely undertone.
I did change 1/2 of oil to applesauce, and next time will try changing all the oil to applesauce. Also, I used my own pureed and frozen pumpkin, which, when thawed is quite runny, and it still worked beautifully.

Truly easy to make and beautiful to present. Everyone loved it. Have to make another one for tomorrow's Thanksgiving dinner. The first one didn't make it. Already gone…… :)

Delicious. Tried my own version of Thanksgiving Bread. I will make some additional adjustments and do this recipe again for the family Thanksgiving Dinner. I baked a small pumpkin (not canned). I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, eliminated the vegetable oil, added 1/2 cup frozen, thawed,  concentrated orange juice (undiluted). I added 1 cup Craisons and 1/2 cup walnuts, chopped. I will cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup next week. Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  The only change I made was I used sweet potato instead of pumpkin.

I made half of this recipe as written with the exception of the pumpkin pie spice, which I didn’t have.  Instead I used 1 t. ground cinnamon, 1/2 t. ground ginger and 1/4 t. ground cloves.  This produced a smallish loaf, even using the size loaf pan that was indicated.  I also think, if I make it again, I will add more cranberries, maybe half again as much.  This was good, but it didn’t wow us the way I had hoped.

This is SO yummy, everyone loved it last thanksgiving! I am going to make it again every year. The bread is not too sweet, and the cranberries are not too tart. Wouldn't change a thing. Also, its VERY good the next day!

Very moist and delicious! Used only 1-1/2 cup sugar because that was all I had on hand, same with the oil - used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce because was all the oil I had on hand. Thank you for this recipe.

So good! I substituted half the flour with whole wheat flour and it was still very tasty and more nutritious.  Great recipe!

I only used a cup and a half of sugar and felt I still could have cut back more.
