My hubby loved this -- he's a huge fan of "creamy" style mac cheese, so I made this as a treat for him.  I followed the recipe with the following additions: dash onion powder, dash dry mustard, dash worcestershire, and 1/4 cup of mild cheddar, finely grated.  I had to add a bit more milk than called for, but that may just be my personal preference.  Great recipe, easy, and I love the fact that I can make it with standard pantry staples.

I found this recipe when I searched for "leftover ham" recipes. Imagine my surprise when ham wasn't listed in the ingredients. It is mentioned in the submitter's description, though, so I went ahead and made it. I had all of the ingredients *except* elbow macaroni, but any short-cut pasta should work well in this recipe. I chose Campanelle. I added one cup frozen peas (which I thawed in boiling water for 2 minutes) and one cup julienned ham. I was honestly leery of this recipe because of the cheddar cheese soup, but I was very pleasantly surprised. The combination of cheeses made this a winner. It is definitely quick and easy and scores points there. It would be a great recipe for kids or beginning cooks. The next time I may add shredded sharp cheddar cheese for a little more flavor. I found this needed a sprinkling of black pepper for my taste. Thanks for a super-simple, tasty recipe!

I will never buy another box of Kraft Mac and Cheese again! So easy!!!! I added a little ground mustard, a dash of garlic powder and a dash of black pepper. My husband just sampled it and now doesn't want me to take it to my event tomorrow evening (the reason I made this).

Very creamy.  My kids liked it but I would like more of a cheddar flavor.  Maybe I will try to add cheddar cheese next time.  Very easy to make

My husband enjoyed this very much.  I thought it was good.  Although I prefer "traditional" baked macaroni and cheese, this was extremely easy to make.  (I even snuck in 1/2 cup of pureed cauliflower to the cheese mix and no one knew!)

Just ok. Not a whole lot of cheesy flavor. Will keep searching.

A hit with my family.  I prefer baked mac n cheese, but this is perfect when you're strapped for time.

Quick & easy and the kids love it!! Said it was the best they have ever had, so cheesey! Double the recipe and you have leftovers.  Add a little milk to the leftovers and heat up in the microwave & they taste like you just made them.

I made this for a Christmas party this week and it was a big hit!  I was worried that making it in such a big quantity might affect the flavor, but it was no problem.  I did add a little garlic powder and pepper to it, like suggested in other reviews, but I mainly followed the directions.  I'll probably add some meat to it next time to make it for dinner one night.  I highly recommend this recipe, easy and good!

I sauteed cut-up chicken in butter first.  Removed the chicken and added the rest of the ingredients (less the butter).  I didn't have Parmesan, but I had a 6 cheese Italian mix that I used. I also didn't have elbow macaroni, so I used small shells - a whole box!  It barely fit in the pan!!  I also added some leftover mashed cauliflower - another member's rating reminded me I had it!!  It was fantastic!!  Mine could've used some pepper and a bit of garlic powder or salt, but I asked the kids and they all said it was better than Kraft!!!  I may never use the box again either!!  Thank you for a great and versatile recipe!!

The flavor is really good, but it was a bit dry. Will definitely make it again, but add more milk and cheese to make it creamier.... Very good base to jump off of and make it your own.
