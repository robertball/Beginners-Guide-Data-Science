To the people who are having trouble with this tasting to much like perfume: You may be using dried Lavender Flowers instead of dried lavender leaves. If you use the flowers you should only use about a tablespoon or two. The leaves are not as strong so a 1/4 cup is necessary.

This is delightful!  A couple of notes:  If you are using lavender flowers you may want to decrease the amount to 2 Tbsp instead of 1/4 cup, otherwise it could taste a little strong.  When you make the lavender tea at first, it will be a brownish color... but the instant you add lemon juice, it transforms into a lovely pink.  Fun!  Sometimes I make a concentrate of the sugar/lavender/lemon and then mix it with ginger ale for a sparkling lavender lemonade.  Excellent for bridal showers, Mother's Day luncheons, etc.

I actually brew the "lavender tea", let it cool and then use it to make with Lemonade Crystal Light. It is nice and refreshing and sugar-free!

This really was incredible. I used fresh lemons (no concentrate can compare) and instead of adding water, made a concentrate of just the boiled sugar-lavender water and the lemon juice. It saves space in the fridge and means everyone can adjust the strength to their own personal taste!

This is soooo yummy. The lavender is very subtle and really adds to the drink. I don't know if I will like plain lemonade anymore! Thanks for the recipe!

I've been experimenting with culinary lavender and this is the best lavendar lemonade I have found to date. I was sceptical that your's was so pink in the picture because my lavender sugar water was a grey/green.  Then when I added the lemon juice, it turned pink.  I love food science!

Awesome! It was also good with some more water added.  I first tried to use lavender from my plant, but wondered when the water turned brown and not pink. Turns out that nurseries often use pesticides. Luckily I called a friend who picked up some food grade lavender, and my guests were spared!
Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a wonderful drink, I made it for a wedding shower and needless to say the coffee, punch and soda were all left to pack up and bring home. 
It was a tremendous hit with everyone and there was not a drop left to transport back home.
Thank you for this great recipe

This is the first time I've ever used culinary lavender in anything.  I used a bit less then the recipe called for because lavender is pretty strong.  The lemonade had a nice refreshing aftertaste but didn't end up tasting like perfume.  I'm not sure if I'd use lavender in my lemonade every time I made it but for a change, it was a pleasant experience.  You can also halve the recipe.

I really don't know what to make of this! At first I thought it was horrible - sort of detergent-y tasting - then it kind of grew on me and I thought it was quite different and refreshing, but then I got tired of it fast. I always like trying new things, but I think maybe once is enough for this one! Thanks anyway!

Delicious! I made this with fresh lavender, with the normal substitution (3 times more fresh than dried). It was delicious & so fun watching the magic happen as the lemonade turned pink. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe without tasting along the way - big mistake!  I got very watery lemonade.  Make sure you taste as you add the last few cups of cold water, you probably won't need as much as the recipe calls for.

This is a delicious alternative to plain lemonade. I also cut down the lavender amount to 2 tablespoons and that was the perfect amount of lavender for this recipe. I really like how the lemonade turns pink right when you add the lemon juice, it looks so pretty. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

i love lemonade, and i LOVE lavender. 1/4 cup of lavender is WAY to much, what i suggest is about 1 tablespoon to maybe 2 tablespoon if you like it strong. i make my own teas, so i always have tea bags on hand, what i did is i crushed the lavender real fine, and put it in a tea bag to soak. you get more flavor from crushing it, and no need for straining, just throw the tea bag away. definatly really tasty. another really good idea is take a favorite fruity tea, a really good one is liptons bavarian wild berry, and soak a few tea bags like you would the lavender. AMAZING flavor

I made this over and over again all summer long after I had something similar at a local cafe.  By far the best lemonade recipe I've ever tried.  The lavendar is absolutely fantastic and the recipe is so easy to make.  A must try!!

This was just delicious! However, I decreased the amount of lavender too, because it seemed like a lot. I only used about 1/8 c. and it was wonderful. The lavender flavor was subtle and refreshing. I would definitely make this again!

Very yummy and easy recipe!  I couldn't find any lavender at my local grocery store, so I used about 2 tablespoons of dried hibiscus flower instead.  Other than that, I followed the recipe given.  I'll definetely be making it again!

we made this for a bridal shower and it was a big hit.  we used less lavender (dried flowers) just because it was all we had.  the flavor is strong and some may like it sweeter.  the color is devine.

A summertime favorite.  It's more complex than regular pink lemonade, and has a soothing quality.  Very refreshing.

I love lavender anything though had not thought too much about drinking it, but I have been making a honey lemonade for years. So I used honey instead of sugar once I finished steeping the lavender. Equal parts lemon juice and honey. The lavender was such a nice new flavor. Very refreshing, almost decadent, one of those summer things that builds pleasant memories.

I would use less Lavender next time as it was a little too strong.  Otherwise I could appreciate the change of flavor.  Also, I tried it with Crystal Light Lemonade, next time I will try homemade.

Very very good! My sister and I had a good time making this together. We used less lavender, like some of others suggested and wished we'd used more. Next time we'll make it exactly like the recipe!

This was great! We served it at our wedding reception, and although people were wary about it at first ("I didn't know you could eat lavender!") it was thr first thing we ran out of. And easy to make. I infused water with lavender using my coffee machine, just make sure you clean it first.

I didn't use the lavender in this, but it's the perfect recipe for lemonade.

READ THIS REVIEW FIRST!!!  I was very confused after reading all of the reviews, so I would like to set the record straight on this recipe. You DO NOT need to change this recipe IF you use the correct ingredients. The most you will need to do is adjust the water and/or sugar a little to suit your taste buds. You DO need to use culinary lavender which I was able to find on Amazon. You DO need to use fresh lemons. If not, it WILL affect the color and flavor A LOT!! I should add that I used an electric juicer which gives you every single drop. If you are just hand squeezing, I would add 1-2 lemons depending on your "tartness" meter!

The only thing that makes this lemonade better is a splash of vodka. Helllooooooo summer!  Oh, and I second the motion to use fresh lemons, the squeezing is worth it. Cheers!

I love Lavender Lemonade. I did think however that this recipe did call for too much lavender. When I made it I kinda felt I was half eating a flower. The lavender was much more prominent than other recipes I have had. But it did meet my craving.

I was glad I looked at the reviews first! I have culinary lavender and 2 tablespoons was MORE than plenty! Also, the tip about tasting as you go was essential! Thanks for those who put those tips in! The OP should note that in the recipe so people don’t add too much lavender or water. Otherwise, this is refreshing and delicious! Great summer drink. I would like to try it with sparkling water next.

Very nice,easy and refreshing . I have organic lavender from France. You need lavender that hasn't been sprayed with chemicals.

Increase sugar from 3/4 cup to 1-3/4 cup. The lavender was very subtle--go for more lavender next time!

Mmm. Fancy sounding but easy. Perfect for a mellow summer night. And a good way to use up the lavender I bought for lavender shortbread cookies many moons ago. :)

I have mixed feelings...sometimes I love it and other times I can taste the chemically taste (even though my dried lavender as designed for cooking)..... I would try to make it a bit weaker and see how that goes

Excellent! My lavender is strong, so I used only 3 Tablespoons. In the end we added a bit more sugar and I still found it on the edge of too tart. DBF thought it tasted like soap, but most other guests seemed to enjoy it. Thanks for a unique take on the ole summer standby!

I love this recipe! I made some to take to a meeting at work and by the time the meeting was over, almost half the dispenser was empty! I did use a natural, non-bleached, drawstring tea bag for the lavender. No need to strain for anything! I also had a hard time trying to keep lemon seeds out, so every time I squeeze some, I painstakingly pick them out. But this recipe makes it worth while! Maybe I should just use cheese cloth or something. Hehe! I highly recommend using real lemons. I have used the fake powder stuff, and nothing will ever compare to real lemons. Plus, I love watching it turn colors! =D
