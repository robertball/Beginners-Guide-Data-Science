AMAZING!!! I cooked this dish tonight to try it out first before serving it at my New Year's Eve dinner party for 8. My fiancee and I both INHALED it. He gave it a 9 out of 10. :-) The only slight changes I made to the recipe was to use crumbled goat cheese instead of feta. I just prefer goat cheese; it's smoother and less salty. It worked very well with the bacon, which was already very salty (I didn't use the additional salt & pepper in the recipe either.) I also used 2 strips of bacon per chicken breast - one inside the breast and one to wrap around it for a nice extra flavor and pretty presentation. I marinated the flattened chicken in the sauce first for about an hour and then assembled each breast in the pan, using a toothpick to hold it all together. 25 minutes was perfect. After plating the breasts, I sprinkled some more of the goat cheese crumbles for presentation. The chicken came out sooo juicy and tender. I give it a 10 out of 10!

Lovely flavor.  Like others I halved the oil and the oregano and used goat cheese.  The chicken does not need to be pounded to stuff it-- use a very sharp knife to cut a pocket into the breast, making the entrance hole at the thickest, short side of the breast.  Swing the knife inside the breast to enlarge the pocket without making the entrance hole larger.  Use one toothpick to close the pocket once you have stuffed it.  Also like others, I crumbled the bacon and mashed it with the goat cheese before stuffing, and I wrapped the breast in a par-cooked (microwave) slice of bacon before cooking the breast.  Pan juices were heavenly over some orzo!

This always gets nothing but rave reviews at my house.  The first time I made it, I accidentally used 2 tbsp of lemon juice, instead of 2 tsp.  Good thing.  It turned out delicious.  The only suggestion I have is beating the chicken extra flat before rolling them.  Makes the whole thing alot easier and less time consuming.

I've made this twice now. It has a nice flavor, although I think it needs a bit more of something - haven't figured it out yet. The feta and bacon go great together. Just make sure not to overcook it, because it can get realllly dry, even though there's bacon in it. The second time I made it, I wrapped the bacon around the chicken breast and it turned out great! I actually prefer it this way now. The bacon was nicely cooked with a slight crisp, not soggy like when you cook in inside the breast.

Great idea! I however, was extremely lazy & in a hurry: just put individually frozen chicken breasts in a baking dish(still frozen), threw all the ingredients on top without measuring(used hormel's bacon bits), and baked at 375 degrees. It was delicious served atop a bed of fresh spinach. The kids gobbled it up. Great combination of flavors!

A Definite Family Favorite. I come from a very large and very greek family so the staple greek flavors of feta and oregano were a natural hit. Chickem is never dry. Marinating for several hours if possible really helps to bring out the flavors.
I also added a little bit of dried basil and/or thyme to the mix just to really bring out the herbaceous nature of this dish. Excellent and Easy!

This was VERY good! I marinated chicken for about an hour, used (moist) bacon bits & mixed with crumbled feta before stuffing chicken. Followed recipe EXACTLY and it worked beautifully. When using smaller chicken breasts definately only 25 minutes @ 350. I cooked covered for 20 minutes, then put broiler on for last 5 for some color on top.

This turned out wonderful!  I did make some changes...I used boneless skinless thighs instead of breasts.  I marinated them for about 4 hours because I had to run errands.  I used chevre instead of feta because it's what I had on hand, and I wrapped raw bacon around the outside of the chicken instead of cooked inside.  It was rich and flavorful!  The flavor was so intense we were satisfied with only one serving...built in portion control!  I will definitely be putting this recipe in my permanent file!

This was so tasty. My Greek friend gave it highest honors. I used some of the pan juices to dress up the steamed cauliflower and broccoli I served with it.

This turned out great! My boyfriend devoured almost all of it and then wanted more! We love bacon so I wrapped the chicken with 1-2 pieces of bacon around the outside as well and the flavor really soaked into the entire breast. I will absolutely make this again!

We loved this!  The flavors are fantastic together, and it's really very easy to make.  The only change I made was to use only 5 tbls of oil.  I will make this again and again.

This recipe was really good, but I changed it up some after reading some of the reviews and I probably will change it a bit more. I used the goat cheese and crumbled bacon inside the chicken, with a partially cooked slice wrapped around the whole thing. The chicken was thick enough that instead of trying to pound it flat, I used a knife to cut it in half starting at the thickest part of the breast and going down the length, leaving a section connected along the opposite side of the incision. The chicken will be thin enough and perfect to stuff. I didn’t have fresh garlic, but garlic powder seemed to work just fine. I used way more lemon juice about 3tbsps. The one thing I didn’t like was the very strong oregano flavor, it tended to over power everything else, next time I will try halving that.Ok, I’, revising my original review a bit. I cooked this chicken for the third time tonight and here are my final notes. The chicken and bacon prep have remained the same. I still prefer it with goat cheese and actually the garlic powder I think is better. Cut the oregano to 1 t and take the lemon juice to 3T. Follow the rest of the recipe. This is a GREAT dish… LOVELY blend of flavors!!!!!!!!

A must TRY. Absolutely delicious!!!! I make this at least once a week now as it has become a family favourite. Only thing i did was add sliced onions to the pan before baking. They end up carmelized and taste great. Steamed asparagus is a great side.

This was really good.  Few changes based on reviews: Used 1/3 cup olive oil (approx. 5 TBSPS), 1/2 TBSP oregano, 1/2 TBSP Pampered Chef Greek Rub (probably would be good with all oregano), 2 shakes of pepper, 2 shakes of salt, and the juice of a whole lemon (almost 1/4 cup, or 4 TBSPS).  I pounded 3 chicken breasts thin, crumbled 4 strips of bacon with about 3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese and one roma tomato, diced.  Added the olive oil/lemon combo to the Ziploc bag that I flattened chicken in and let it sit in fridge while I prepared the rest of dinner, feta mixture. Heated a grill pan lightly brushed with oil while I filled the chicken breasts and rolled up.  Placed seam side down in a hot grill pan to 'sear' the seams shut.  Browned both sides slightly and then placed in baking dish.  Baked for about 30 minutes at 350. Served with couscous and broccoli.  It was very good.  Will definitely make again.

Absolutely fabulous - we loved it!  I only made two chicken breasts and did not half the other ingredients.  I left them as written, although I did use a tablespoon of minced garlic because we love garlic. This was so mouthwateringly good, we are marking it as a good recipe to serve for guests.  YUM!  I was so pleased the cooking time was spot on - that rarely happens, so I was thrilled!  10*'s

I barely followed this recipe as written so here's what I did. I marinated the chicken in a Greek vinagarette all day, pounded it out flat and stuffed it with spinach (I sauteed it first), crumbled bacon, herbed feta cheese, and tomatoes. I then wrapped two slices of bacon around the chicken secured it shut with toothpicks, put it into a baking dish, drizzled a little more dressing over top and baked it at 350 for a bout 40 minutes. Before serving I sprinkled a little more feta over top and served this with roasted red skin potatoes, green beans and a salad.

I hate when people alter a recipe and rate their version instead of the way the food should have been cooked, but now here I am doing the same thing. I used considerably less oil and left out the lemon juice (didn't have any). I still give this recipe 5 stars because it was so good. I'm sure it would have been even better if I had prepared it the way I was supposed to, but I loved it anyway. The oregano, feta, and bacon blend so perfectly with the chicken. This one is on my "make again" list!

omgYUMMY! This was so delicious! One note - even though it says "salt to taste", remember that you're using both feta and bacon, and your sauce really doesn't need salt. (I remembered the other, super salty ingredients just as the last few grains of salt were falling from my palm!) The whole house smelled amazing while these were in the oven - I was practically clawing at the oven door waiting for them to get done!

I loved this dish. I did use considerably less oil - I tripled the recipe for a dinner party, but still only used the 1/2c. of oil and I didn't use quite as much oregano either (2tbl. for the tripled recipe). It was really helpful to pound the chicken breasts flat and then fold the bacon and feta cheese in and secure with the toothpicks. So good and definitely a great company dish!

A great mix with the Greek Taste in this chicken.  I think just a bit more Feta, and another slice of bacon or two for me.  If you are a person who loves Feta, you might want to put more into this recipie!  Other than that, it was wonderful.

I went looking for a feta and bacon stuffed chicken recipe because I was trying to re-create a dish I'd had at a local restaurant.  Although not exactly like the restaurant version, this was delicious!  I topped it with a balsamic glaze and served it with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli.  After testing it out, I made it for my sister and a friend and they loved it too!  Definitely a keeper!

The chicken was ok.  It was a little too oily for my taste.  I think if you used less oil it would be very good.

I made this last night, and it was SO YUMMY! I took the advice of others and didn't add any extra salt and wrapped bacon around the chicken breasts. I made extra mariande sauce and put it over bow-tie noodles as a side. My boyfriend ate it all and went for seconds before I could finish my first plate!

WOW!  This was awesome!  I took some other people's advice and decided to wrap the bacon around the chicken.  I wasn't sure if I should cook the bacon first, so I didn't.  The bacon did not come out quite cooked enough for me, but was fine for my boyfriend.  I prefer mine a little crispier so I took mine off and microwaved it a little more and threw it back on.  But, the flavor was absolutely awesome!  One of the best dinners I have ever cooked.  I paired with one of the garlic green bean dishes on here and was in heaven!

Although I wish the cheese had melted a little more, and I also thought that 30 mins was too long, this turned out pretty well. I pounded the chicken to an even thickness, and think that 15/20mins would have been sufficient. It probably wouldn't have done any harm to marinade the chicken in the oil/lemon juice/oregano either. Thanks.

This recipe was very good. It was very easy to make and also had lots of flavor. Even my two year old liked it. I think it might even be better if had thick cut bacon

This recipe was really good!  I halved the recipe since it was just my fiance and I.  I realized I didn't have a lemon so I used lemon olive oil.  Also I couldn't find sliced feta so I bought the crumbled kind.  I crumbled my bacon and mixed with the feta and stuffed my chicken.  My fiance really enjoyed the lemon flavor.  We will be making this again!

Great recipe and VERY simple. I took advice of others and let chicken sit in the oil/lemon juice/ garlic/oregano mixture in a ziploc for a little over an hour in the fridge. I then removed it and stuffed it with crumbled Feta mixed together with pieces of crumbled bacon. Any leftover feta/bacon I placed over the top of each breast during the last 7 minutes of baking. Great recipe, will make again and again.

This is probably the best home-cooked meal I've ever had!  Every time I serve it (which seems to be at least once a week now) it gets rave reviews.  Try it with pemeal (Canadian back bacon) for an even more tender dish.  My favorite meal by far!!!

Very good!  Just brushed the chicken with the oil mixture, as we thought it would be too oily if we poured it all over the chicken.  May have used about half the marinade for 6 small breast halves and that was fine.  The chicken was nice and tender and perfectly flavorful.  Will make this again!

Amazing!  I used crumbled feta and I should have used a lot more, but still good.  And I used extra bacon.  We ate it all and the fam wanted more.

I've made this several times, and it is always well-received. For best results, pound the chicken to 1/4"-1/2" thickness so it's easier to "stuff"--put the bacon and cheese inside and fold the two edges over. You don't even have to secure it with toothpicks if you lay it seam side down. I love it with feta cheese but my husband isn't a big fan, so I've also made it with jack, which adds a nice, smooth flavor that still goes well with the oil mixture. Basil also works if you're not a big oregano fan. I usually cut down the oil and add a bit more lemon juice, and it's still yummy. I like it best with a green salad, asparagus and sauteed zucchini, but my husband likes it best with baked sweet potatoes and green beans. It really is versatile enough that you could eat it with whatever suits you.

I stuck with the basics of this recipe, but made a few changes and turned this into a super simple dish that we just inhaled and loved!  Here's what I did:  I BUTTERFLIED EACH CHICKEN BREAST (I USED 5 OF THEM) AND THEN LIGHTLY SEASONED THEM WITH A SEA SALT/ROASTED GARLIC BLEND AND FRESHLY GROUND PEPPER.  I GOT MY PAMPERED CHEF GRILL PAN, LIGHTLY DRIZZLED EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL ON IT AND GOT IT SCREAMING HOT.  I GRILLED THE CHICKEN BREASTS ON BOTH SIDES AND THEN I ADDED 1 T. REAL BACON PIECES, SOME DICED ROASTED RED PEPPERS AND SOME TOMATO/BASIL FETA CHEESE ON TOP AND LET THAT GET MELTED AND HEATED ON THE CHICKEN.  IT WAS INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS AND SO MUCH EASIER!  GRILLING THE CHICKEN GIVES IT A GREAT FLAVOR WITHOUT DRYING IT OUT!  EVERY KITCHEN SHOULD HAVE A GRILL PAN!

This recipe was very good, but i did take the advice of some of the other reviewers. I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours and I would cook the bacon BEFORE stuffing it into the breast. I cooked mine half way and it wasn't enough, the bacon was not cooked all the way. Personally my family prefers our bacon crisp. Last, I did add another slice of bacon around the whole breast before I cooked it all. The marinade was great! I will use it just by itself!  Thanks for sharing!

I had to make a few minor changes, but this was still VERY good! I used crumbled feta because I didn't have slices and I piled it on top with the bacon. I also accidentally used cilantro instead of oregano...so it turned out that I used 1 T. cilantro and about 1/2 T. oregano. Also, I cut the oil down to about 7 T. but that was still a bit much. I served it with pesto rigitoni, yum!! :]

We loved this.  I had a hard time stuffing the chicken, so I ended up sprinkling the feta and bacon over the top, then pouring on the sauce.  It was divine.

This is a very flavorful chicken recipe, and of course the fat content is through the roof.  Toothpicks are essential to keeping the breasts together if you use crumbled feta.  I used sundried tomato and basil feta and it was fantastic. :)

This is a really good recipe!  I think I would cut the oregano at least in half next time, or switch to dill or basil. Our 3 year old loved it; 5 year old didn't care for the oregano.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe was quick, easy and super tasty.  My fiance and I really enjoyed it.  It's something that I would definitely prepare for company or just the two of us.  Note: We used crumbled feta instead of slices and it worked just as well.

Made this for the first time yesterday and loved it. I cut the slit into the breast and marinated the chicken breast in the sauce for a couple of hours and then stuffed it. Like some others mentioned, I pre-cooked a slice of bacon and wrapped it around the breast. Yummy.

I needed a recipe to use up feta cheese and this filled the bill.  I stuffed the breasts with basil leaves instead of using oregano, because that's what I had.  They were delicious, hubby loved it.  We both thought the breasts were too pale.  Next time I'll give them a quick run under the broiler.  Recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was an amazing recipe! Next time we have company over for dinner I will most def be making this! I did only make a small change, I cooked my bacon first and then stuffed it with the feta.

Excellent dish, however, I HIGHLY recommend completing step 3 prior to step 2 or you will be cleaning instead eating.

Way too much olive oil, I cut it in half and it was still too much. Next time will cut it down to 2tbsp and add some chicken broth for cooking. Pounded out the chicken and then folded it over into little stuffed pockets held closed with a toothpick. Chopped up the bacon (used turkey bacon) and used crumbled feta.

Delish!  I used only 5 tbsp of olive oil instead of the suggested 8.  I also used the pre cooked bacon from costco and it worked well. Not greasy at all.

This was good.  The oregano was too powerful compared to the other flavors though.  Next time I'll cut it down by 1/2 teaspoon.  Overall, the chicken was juicy - the recipe easy to follow - I'll definitely try it again.

To be honest, this didn't look all that great after it was cooked (appearance).  But it was very delicious.  I would suggest cutting into the chicken very deeply in order to best distribute the cheese and bacon.  Will be making it again!

This was very good.  I marinated my chicken in buttermilk for a few hours-for the ultimate moistness(if no buttermilk 2 cups milk with 2 tbsp vinegar or lemon juice) I made extra bacon and crumbled it up and mixed it into some crumbled feta(didn't have sliced)and added a dollop or two of sour cream to hold it together good. I did add in some fresh parsley to that as well.   I made a slit down the side of the chicken and stuffed away.  I do wish that I added more of the stuffing.  It is the best part.  I poured on the oil mixture after I stuffed them(which next time I will only do half-not necessary to have all that oil)
Will make again.

What a great tasty recipe!  I added less olive oil than prescribed.  However, I will not include the olive oil to the mixture the next time I'll be preparing this dish; personally, I don't believe there's any need for it to be part of the lemon juice / garlic mixture.  At best, I would substantially reduce the amount of olive oil.  My other suggestions include adding extra crumbled bacon and adding lemon pepper to the lemon juice / garlic  mixture.

I have made this several times, making slight adjustments each time.  The biggest being that I've consistently used plenty of fresh, chopped rosemary in place of or in addition to the oregano and gotten EXCELLENT results.  My kids think they are eating in a restaurant! This is my favorite!!!

These were awesome. I'd cook them slower next time to keep them from drying out, and maybe add more lemon juice.

I made this last night and it was absolutely delicious!  I added one extra clove of garlic and I pounded the chicken breasts flat with a mallet between two pieces of plastic wrap.  I used crumbled bacon and feta cheese and just rolled it up and secured with a toothpick.  35 min. was long enough.  Such a good combination of flavors!

Husband and I loved it - kids (ages 18 and 13) just OK with it, but will go into our "save" file.
The flavors were great!  I did make a few changes, but only because I didn't have the recipe with me when I was shopping (and we are not big fans of chicken breasts).
I used boneless, skinless thighs (they are so juicy) and crumbled feta.  As several comments suggested, I did double the bacon and marinated for a few hours.
My prep (I followed the recipe directions with these few exceptions):
2 boneless, skinless thighs per person
2 bacon strips per person (plus a little extra to crumble on top, if you are so inclined!)
Marinate thighs - as far as I am concerned, the longer the better. Really gets that nice garlicy flavor into the meat.
Place 1 thighs(s) on bottom of 9 X 13 pan, cover with feta and lay 2 strips of bacon on top.  Cover with a 2nd thigh (thus the 2 thighs per person).  
If you have left over feta and bacon, crumble on top.  Cook at 350 for 30 mins - but check to make sure done/not overdone.
This makes a good size serving, so be hungry or enjoy the leftovers!
Really great flavor - 
Thanks for an easy and Yummy dish!

This was SO good.  The only variation we made was to use ham instead of bacon (only because I didn't happen to have any bacon but I did have some deli ham on hand) and like other reviewers we put the meat inside the chicken as directed but also wrapped the chicken in it.  A VERY good recipe we will definitely be eating again - thank you to the contributor!

Hold the salt, cut down a bit on the oil and oregano, cutting a simple pocket in the chicken breast makes for easier prep and then you've got a full-flavored winner!

Very tasty & made the whole house smell so good!  However, next time I would only add 1-1.5 cloves of garlic.  4 cloves is way to much.  I did tweek the receipe a little.  I used crumbled feta instead of slices.  I used 3 slices of bacon in each piece of chicken.  I think you could even use bacon bits to save some time.  Next time I would also omit the salt because there is so much salt in the feta & bacon already.

I made this for dinner last night and both hubby and I really enjoyed it.  I used chicken cutlets as they were what I had on-hand and also used flavored feta crumbles (roasted garlic & red pepper). I also did not have fresh garlic, so I omitted the salt and used garlic salt instead, and it turned out fine, but I will try to use fresh next time as I am a garlic-junky. The 30 minute cook-time at 350 deg. was not cooking the chicken through, so I bumped up the oven temp to 400 deg. and cooked it for an additional 15 minutes, and chicken was still moist and tender.  To brown the tops of the chicken, I turned on the broiler for about 3 minutes for for appearance sake.  Since there were some leftovers, I plan on slicing the chicken and serving it was pasta with pesto sauce and a nice rosemary/herb bread for dinner tonight!  Definintely looking forward to making this again!

As a lover of all things feta, I really enjoyed this!  My husband who doesn't like feta much liked this as well.  I have also altered it to make simple baked breasts -  just make the sauce (less of it) and bake the chicken in it, sans bacon and cheese.  Very simple and good!

Oh my goodness!  What an incredible recipe!  I actually omitted the bacon and added sauteed mushrooms instead and it was SO good!  Thank you!

This was a nice recipe.  It was a little messy due to the feta cheese but the taste was great.  I used more bacon than what it called for and added a little more oregano. I also used tomato and basil feta cheese for added flavour. Definately will make it again.

This dinner was prepared in 20 mins (which includes bacon frying time) and was excellent!  I'm going to experiment, using fresh
mozz, prosciutto, roasted peppers, etc.  VERY good!

Delicious recipe! Very versatile, as I was out of feta and oregano and substituted meunster cheese and basil instead, turned out great. Perfect for anyone on a low-carb diet.

I did think the oregano was a little overpowering, but what an awesome chicken dish! The bacon and feta complemented each other wonderfully.  I will be making this again!

Awesome!  I made this recipe this past weekend with rave reviews!  Everyone loved it.  So easy, I prepared everything ahead of time I was able to enjoy my company. So quick to cook! I have passed this one to my family and co-workers! I will be making this next time I have company over!
Thanks for sharing!

This was very good and rich. I followed other reviews and marinated it about an hour. I used italian seasoning instead of oregano because I detest oregano.  I mixed feta (sheep/goat combo) with crumbled up bacon and stuffed the breasts. 30 minutes later and presto, yummy chicken. I served with white rice. Since this dish is rich, I won't make it often, but I will make again.

My husband (a SUPER picky eater btw) and I are making this for the 10th time - this time because we're snowed in! We don't change much except substitute Italian seasoning for Oregano and add a little poultry seasoning. It's also good to add fresh parsley to the stuffing. Great with garlic mashed potatoes. Your whole house will smell like roasting garlic. PS - we've also used cooking rubber bands to secure and these turn out awesome on the grill, but not tonight because of the blizzaster.

I took out the bacon but overall i'd rate this a 5/5. So mouthwatering and the chicken is always juicy when prepared this way.

Oh, this was so good, it's like chicken cordon bleu except you use bacon in place of ham and I used pepper jack cheese in place of feta, personal preference.   I would make this again in a heartbeat.

My mom made a similiar recipe, and I remember it being so good.  This one does not disapoint!  I was just testing this for Easter, so I used the thin breast strips.  Instead of stuffing long ways, I made smaller rolls with the thin breast.  I put the feta slice in the middle and added a leaf of fresh basil over the top (that was the difference in my mom's).  Then I rolled it, and bent in half, and placed bacon over the top to cover the roll.  I think I might cook the bacon a little before placing on the top next time, so I don't have to broil it.  It wasn't dry, but it was borderline.  I also doubled the lemon juice, which didn't hurt.  Overall, delicious!!!  We will make this Sunday for Easter, and again... and again.

I love stuffed chicken - when I go out to dinner, it's pretty much guaranteed that that's what I'll have if it's on the menu.  I have tried a couple of different stuffed chicken recipes before but this one is my favourite.  The blend of spices was great (I added some chicken seasoning and basil into the mix) And the feta worked really well. Thanks!

This recipe was awesome! I made a couple changes. Only used two chicken breasts, 3 tbsp. of lemon juice, freshly squeezed, still about 8 tbsp. of olive oil, 2 cloves of garlic and 1 1/2 tbsp of oregano. I let the chicken breasts marinade in the sauce for about 20 minutes. I used two slices of bacon per breast, crumbled after I fried it. Also I used about 1/3 - 1/2 cup of crumbled feta. I poured the sauce I had used to marinade on the chicken breasts and sprinkled the remainder of feta and bacon on top of the breasts... Yum!

THEE Best recipie yet!!!! If I could give it 50 stars I would! This is something I'm going to make for all guests coming over- I also pounded out the breasts, then marniated them for at least an hour, and wrapped the end result in bacon- but I didn't feel like the bacon wrapping added any flavor, just looks fancy :o)~ I needed mine in the oven for at least 1 hour though- and they were ssssoooo juicy and tender!

We found this to be a little bland for our tastes.  The bacon and feta combo was good but hubby and I agreed the chicken itself really needed something.  If I make this again, I will either layer the bacon and feta over the top or include some type of sauce.

I thought this was a great recipie! i made a few changes to it though. instead of pre cooking the bacon i wraped it around the chicken raw. it turned out great, the bacon added a nice crisp texture to the chicken. i also just rubbed the marinade on the chicken instead of pouring it on the chicken in the pan. The chicken turned out great and i served it over a bed of fresh spinach leaves with diced tomato's, crumbled feta and a light vinaigrett. Everyone loved the meal and were begging for more.

Mmm-mmm-mmm!  Was looking for a chicken recipe that included feta, as I had some left over from another dish.  Wow!  The whole family really enjoyed this, and asked that I make it again soon. I put the chicken in the marinade about an hour before I thought I was going to bake it, but something came up, and I didn't actually make it until the following night.  As this was the first time I've made this dish, I don't know if the additional marinating time made any difference.  I do know that the chicken was tender and juicy, and we loved the zing that the lemon juice added. I cut the olive oil to only 4 tablespoons. I had only crumbled feta, so per others' suggestions, I mixed it with the crumbled bacon, and added just a little bit of sour cream to bind it, which made it easier for me to stuff the chicken.  Also, we too love bacon, so I also wrapped each breast with a slice of partially cooked bacon.  Sauteed some mushrooms in a little olive oil & added fresh spinach just till wilted as a side.  Plated the spinach/mushrooms over orzo and topped with the chicken - looked great and tasted even better.

So good! and so easy. Next time I think I will let the chicken marinate for a while, but, even without marinating, it was delicious.

Really good! the only changes I made was to marinate the chicken first for a couple of hours as others suggested, then I added a couple of tsp of mayo to the filling to make it "stick" without changing the flavour. Fabulous.

Great recipe!  Very easy to fix.  The only thing I did differently was to use crumbled feta and real bacon bits.  I mixed the bacon and feta together and put a heaping spoonful in the middle and folded the chicken breast over.  Wonderful flavor and will definitely make again!

Just got done making this.  I made this as written for me and my SO and he absolutely LOVED it.  He usually says well I like it but it needs this he actually said I can't say anything.  Now I know it sounds weird but I made it with some creamed corn and the sweet and salty thing was great. I gave it a 5 because the ONE thing I did change only because I bought the wrong oil, was i used vegetable oil.  I can only imagine how good it is with olive oil.

Excellent!! My husband ad 2 teenage sons gobbled it up!! The only changes I made were that I used a little less oil and more lemon juice. I also did not stuff the chicken breasts. I marinated the chicken in the oil, lemon juice and spices for a couple of hours. I then laid them out in a baking dish and sprinkled the feta cheese and crumbled bacon on top and baked. Delicious

I have to say that this recipe was pretty good. The feta cheese should have been goat cheese, but otherwise, the chicken turned out very tasty. I will make it again in the future!

Very nice flavor. Enjoy better with the bacon on the outside so it crisps up. Nice change from regular chicken recipes.

This is an amazing dish, the flavors blend so well together.  I would definitely make some sort of pasta as a side and make more of the sauce to put over it b/c it was that good!

one of our favorites.  I buy fresh chicken breast in bulk when it is on sale and make 30 or so of these (I use the cut-a-hole-in-the-fat-end-and-stuff-it method; I think I will try crumbling the bacon next time - I like that idea), then freeze in 6-breast freezer bags.  When I remove them from the freezer, I place the chicken on top of cooked basmati rice and then drizzle the oil mixture over the chicken and rice.  The rice makes a wonderful addition and the flavors from the marinade and the chicken makes the rice to-die-for!  I usually make a greek salad to go with it and fresh pita.

This is an awesome recipe! I used fresh crumbled feta applewood smoked bacon. I didn't cook the bacon first - it cooked fine in the oven. If you don't like feta, try mozarella.

I made this chicken last night for Valentines dinner. My whole family loved it. I forgot I didn't have lemon juice, so I didn't add that, and it was still really good. I cooked the bacon till crisp and then crumbled it up and mixed it with crumbled feta instead of slices and rolled the chicken around it and secured with toothpicks. 1 lb. of bacon and about 1/2 c. feta was enough to fill 6 chicken breasts. Then I drizzled the oil mixture over chicken. Great recipe, thanks.

Yummy!  We are garlic fans and this will keep the vampires away!  I didn't have nice enough breast to stuff so I cut them into strips and put the bacon and feta on top and stirred it around a little.  Had some rice, green beans and a salad.

This was an amazing dish... and it was so easy and quick! The only changes I made to the sauce was I added more lemon, and also some red pepper flakes to kick it up a little. This sauce would be great as a dressing for anything as well! Thanks!

This recipe is awesome. I was sick of making the same old chicken recipes, when this new one came to my mailbox.(via e-mail) This is by far one of the best atuffed chicken recipes I have ever tried. It melts in your mouth,tender and juicy,full of robust flavor. I rate it a ten out of ten.

This recipe is FABULOUS!  The flavors go very well together.  My family loved it, and there were NO leftovers!  The only thing I did differently from the original recipe was marinate the chicken breasts in the olive oil / garlic / oregano / lemon juice for a couple hours before stuffing and baking.  Otherwise I kept everything else the same, wouldn't change a thing!

This was tasty.  I followed fellow members' advice by reducing the amount of oil and allowing the chicken to marinate for an hour-or-so prior to cooking.  My entire family enjoyed this recipe.  Will make again.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and it was excellent. Easy, quick and yummy meet all the requirements in my kitchen. I did not have chopped garlic so I substituted 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder and I left the bacon out but it was still fantastic. Definitely a keeper.

This was just okay, if you love Greek flavored food you will love this. Hubby said it'd be better w/ cream cheese(he's not a Feta cheese fan)but overall it was okay.

I have been making this recipe for about a year now.  We absolutely love it.  You can make it just the way the recipe says or you can add mushrooms, etc.  The lemon/olive oil marinade is the best! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a good recipe that is special for everyday or for company. I also used less oil than what was called for. In addition, I lightly breaded the rolled chicken breasts with breadcrumbs before pouring the oil and lemon mix over.

This is my first time making any of the recipes from this website..I was so anxious to try this one out..Overall it was good, but for my liking I would definetly cut back on the 1 Tablespoon of oregano and change it to a teaspoon.Otherwise the chicken with feta and bacon had a great taste.

Very good!  The feta cheese and bacon gave the chicken a great flavor.  I used fresh ground pepper after they were finished baking and it brought out all the flavors.

This really hit the spot!  This recipe reminded me of a chicken dish that we LOVE
at our favorite Greek restaurant.  The husband and kids ate it up quickly and 
asked to have it on our "regular" dinner menu.

This caught David's eye & he got the ingredients, planning to make soon! We had plans to go out, but postponed, so this was his 1st thought! I'm glad he did, it was excellent! I love that he looks at these recipes & is willing & excited to try them! I get spoiled & he is developing a list of specialties! I think it makes him feel special, proud  & accomplished to do this for me! I use to do a lot more cooking & experimenting! We would call the good ones, "keepers"!! This is a keeper! Maybe he's trying to inspire me, I'm inspired to share the kitchen!! ?? When I smelled the chicken, I got nervous, because the garlic smelled strong, but it was perfect! We think the salad suggested to go with, may have offset it, but all the flavors came thru on their own & none overpowered the others! Both chicken & salad were great, very filling, he made 3, we split one & were full, "leftovers"!!!

This was really good! I just want to say, my chicken was still kinda frozen. I poured all the ingredients on it, then cooked it for about 20 minutes. Then I slit them and stuffed 3 per directions, on 2 of them I
I sprinkled the cheese  on top then wrapped with bacon just to see the difference. ( I made a 10 slice thick bacon) then put back in the oven another 15 minutes. Both ways were great! There is a mashed PO side on this site where you mix in sauteed mushrooms and onions, I used half the bacon grease to saute them in and it was a awesome side for this dish. Thank u....very tasty!

I really thought I would like this recipe since I love both bacon and feta.  It was not what I expected.  I think the feta over-powered the chicken though I was conservative with the amount.  I won't be making this again.

I tried this once and my 3 and 6 year old loved it!! Not to mention my husband as well. I made this so simple instead of stuffing the chicken I mixed the ingredients and put it on top of the chicken to bake, so easy and delicious.

I made this last night and it was really good. I didn't have Feta so I used provolone and it worked well. As others have said, the chicken is a little bland. Next time I will make twice as much "sauce" and marinate it then wrap it in bacon. Otherwise, it was very good!

It came out great! My husband raved about it (and his praise is not easy to come by!).  I basically did everything as the recipe required, with just a few slight changes.

I added some fresh spinach (which I put into the microwave for 1 minute so that they would wilt) to 1 cup of crumbled feta cheese.  I fried 6 pieces of bacon and then cut them into small pieces and added it into the feta and spinach mixture.  

Served it with quinoa and and a blueberry/spinach salad/balsamic salad.  Think I will try goat cheese next time though.

Made this many times.  It's a favorite.  I've even prepared the raw chicken and then froze for future use.  The result may not have as delicious and the fresh version, but my family and I still loved it.

I made this the other night to try something new - and it turned out really good! I always overcook chicken, but it came out moist and juicy, the bacon and feta complimented the chicken and herbs wonderfully. But there are some changes I would make... 

1.) More filling, I used about 1.5 slices of bacon per breast and 1/5 cup of feta, next time I will definitely use more. Another note on the filling: I think it helps to mix the feta and bacon in a separate bowl before stuffing to make it even.

2.) My friend and I both decided it was missing something, maybe a white sauce, extra feta, a glaze, or something along those lines to finish it with.

Another Note: I stuffed the chicken differently, if you are the type that cares about appearance I would recommend making a small pouch in the breast for stuffing instead of cutting it in half and tooth picking it together.

I served it with wild rice and a lite vinaigrette salad. Overall - definitely one to try, and one I will definitely make again.

This recipe is a standard for us.  I used more oregano and lemon juice then called for and cooked the bacon prior to putting in the chicken.  I also used crumbled feta.  Smells amazing while it is cooking.

I really like this recipe due to the simplicity. The base recipe allows for a lot of experimentation. I've used bacon, prosciutto, spinach and just feta. I like to use crumbled feta most of the time. Now as for "stuffing" the chiken breast, I like to make a deep pocket with a very sharp knife (fillet knife maybe) with a smaller opening to avoid the toothpicks. The filling tends to keep the breast meat tender. I generally season the breasts and pocket with salt,fresh ground black pepper and garlic powder, but I think you can try a lot of different seasoning combinations. I try to be careful with the salt so as not to over season. Without some additional seasoning I found my first attempt to be a little flat. So I leave the salt and pepper out of the olive oil mixture. Anyway that's my take on this recipe. Obviously, a lot of this is per taste per cook/chef. A great recipe to play with over time.

This was really good. Used four and a half tablespoons of vegetable oil(didn't have olive oil) instead of 8 and it turned out great. I also only used a tsp of oregano. Used 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, perfect amount. I stuffed it with bacon bits and feta, then wrapped it with two pieces of bacon. Instead of using crushed garlic...I used garlic salt and everything tasted great! Will definitely be making this again. Everyone in my family loved it.

This was the first recipe I tried from Allrecipes.com and it didn't disappoint.  I subbed in Canadian Bacon, which worked fine.  The chicken is moist and flavorful, and the feta cheese and bacon give it a nice "salty" kick.  This is my "go-to" recipe when I dont' know what else to make for dinner.

Delicious!  I didn't have boneless so I used breasts with bone/skin.  I stuffed bacon, crumbled feta and a slice of swiss cheese under the skin.  I also added a little parmesan on top of the chicken. My husband always complains about how dry chicken breast are, but he loved this!

Extremely flavorful! I will be making it again and agree that wrapping the bacon around the outside holds it all together and adds extra flavor. I may reduce the oregano a little, but that is simply a personal preference.

I made it as written (well, OK - I had crumbled feta instead of sliced ;-) and it was absolutely delicious!  Super easy, especially since I used the new Oscar Meyer bacon that comes aleady pre-cooked!  I'll definitely be making this again - both for myself and I'd make it for company, too!

Made this last night for me and my fiance. He is starting a new nutrition plan and he can't have any starches at dinner time. He gave this rave reviews! I looked at the reviews and took the suggestion by many of cutting down on the olive oil. I also added some diced tomatoes to the feta and bacon. DELISH!!

My husband and I loved this dish! The olive oil sauce was a little overwhelming in terms of the amount left over in the pan. I might serve this over a pasta next time and will add capers. If you add more lemon, it turns into a rather delicious lemon chicken dish. Reminds us of a dish we love at a big time Italian place downtown.

BF LOVED this!  Said I'd better give it 5 stars! :) I used twice as much garlic, and was twice as delish!

I like this recipe a lot. I think the next time I make it, I'm going to use just a little less garlic though. I used chopped garlic because I didn't have a garlic press. I also didn't use any salt because the feta and bacon gave it plenty of salt. It turned out great!

Yum. So I stuffed the chicken with feta and then wrapped it with the bacon. I wanted my bacon crispier somehow but the taste combo was to die for! Thanks!

I hollowed out an area in the center of the underneath of the breast.  Drizzled some of the olive oil mixture in the hollow first, then added shredded mozzarella cheese, bacon, then crumbled feta cheese.  Baked with the hollowed side up.  When finished, I thought the Mozzarella cheese really added what it needed to hold the stuffed ingredients together.  Next time I think I will add some Mozzarella on top when almost done.  We loved, loved this recipe!

I was really impressed with this dish! The chicken came out exceptionally moist and tender and very flavorful. I went light on the salt because of the feta and bacon. I also dusted the outside of the chicken with some paprika and a little pepper. This was extremely delicious and surprisingly easy to make, considering how fancy and tasty it is.

this chicken is SOOOO good and moist.  i subbed out the feta for blue cheese, since that's what we had on hand, added some cooked spinach, and held off on the salt...since the cheese and bacon were so salty already.  Its pretty easy to put together, and comes out looking fancy! One to use to impress dinner guests!

Super good! I used the lemon herb flavored chunk feta to compliment the flavors in the rest of recipe! Brown up the chicken in a pan then throw in a 350 oven to finish it up, makes it a little quicker and will cook a thicker chicken thru and won't burn the outside.

This was a tasty way to jazz up a chicken breast.  I was a big fan and will make again.  Very easy too!  I followed the recipe as written and also wrapped an additional piece of bacon around the outside of the chicken breast.  I paired with a spinach salad.  YUM!

Fantastic! I marinated the chicken in the sauce for about an hour & it came out so juicy. Then I stuffed the breasts with 1/2 goat cheese, 1/2 feta, sundried tomato (with some oil), fresh basil, and crumbled cooked bacon. I also half cooked bacon and wrapped one around each breast. I didn't use any toothpicks because I didn't want to have to take them out or guests to bite into them. Finally I served it with a touch of the Basil Cream Sauce from "Chicken in Basil Cream" and let people add more if they wanted. It was sinful! (I had to reheat this at the party and it was still juicy. Just got home and heated another half back up - still moist and delicious.)

SO GOOD!  I use the already seasoned crumbled feta and leave out the bacon (personal preference).  Like another user suggested, I didn't flatten the chicken and roll, but cut a pocket into the chick breast to stuff with the feta.  It was really easy to do, and turned out great.  I also topped the breast with some capers before serving - got rave reviews!

Feta, bacon, chicken...how can you go wrong, these were FANTASTIC!  I mixed equal amounts of fresh lemon juice and olive oil (maybe 3tbsps each) along with greek seasoning and 4 cloves of garlic.  I cut a slit in each breast and stuffed with the feta and some fresh basil.  I then poured the marinade over and topped with pancetta (leftover from a pork roast I had done the night before).  Let them sit for several hours and then baked covered at 400 for about 30 mins and uncovered for another 15 or so!  SO YUMMY!

I maranated the chicken overnight and made it with ham instead of bacon and it was great. I thought it was fine, but my husband LOVED it...and he's super picky. Give the recipe a try, you'll probably really enjoy it.

Very good. Although how does one actually stuff a chicken breast and keep the chicken tender and juicy without drying it up?

This was good, but I really wanted it to blow my socks off, and it just didnt.  I took the advice of one reviewer and made an extra half serving of the sauce and served it on angel hair pasta, and that was good too.  Overall I think I will make it again, but will tweak it a bit.  I think it needs some spice!

Wow! This is going in my favorites file at home! I used 1/4 cup olive oil and two tablespoons of lemon juice for the marinade mixture and let it marinate for five hours in the fridge. I stuffed it with crumbled turkey bacon and feta and cooked it for exactly 30 minutes at 350. It smelled great and tasted even better! FYI: It was also fork tender which hardly ever happens with chicken! Try this recipe & you won't be disappointed especially if you have time to let it marinate for a while.

i absolutely loved the juicy tenderness of the chicken entwined with an awesome aroma and flavour!
the only changes i made were to use ham instead of bacon(coz i had that on hand) and to add some basil along with the oregano.
i also marinated the chicken overnight.
i made two batches...one with lemon in the marinade and one without...both were equally great...a little extra feta cheese in the chicken without the lemon makes up for the absence of the lemon (its weird i know...but it does!)!!!

This was fabulous and it was the first time I have made stuffed chicken breasts!
I made this last night for my family and everyone, including my 4 yr old, loved it.  I pounded out my chicken breasts because they were to small to cut a pocket into.  I diced up my bacon before cooking it, let it cool and added that to my feta crumbles.  I was worried I didn't have enough cheese so I grated a little bit of Jack cheese also.  I let the chicken breats marinate in the olive oil, lemon, oregano and garlic while I cooked the bacon.  I did cut the olive oil in half and it was still plenty.  The chicken breats were perfectly done after 35 minutes at 350 degrees, juicy, tender and full of flavor.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

I LOVE this dish, I have been  making it for awhile but haven't rated it. I often makes it as is but sometimes I splurge and put extra feta and bacon in. I usually increase the lemon juice. This is my favorite go to dish, it is so easy and I always have the ingredients on hand.

Delicious! This is one main dish that I get asked for seconds, and it was very easy to make.  I used 1/2 a package of crumbled feta, as well as crumbled the bacon, and added it to the olive oil mixture. I also beat the chicken to 1/4" thickness for faster cooking and reduced the olive oil by 1/2.
Definitely will make it again.

Made this again, months later, tip, marinate the breasts in the oil/lemon sauce for an hour or two, pound them out a little first, added minced garlic, little onion powder, also added chopped artichokes, and alittle sour cream to the stuffing mixture, goat cheese instead of feta, cooked and crumbled the bacon before adding it, also put some on top of the chicken once it was wrapped, whole entire family devoured :)
Tastes incredible! Big hit with the family! Used goat cheese instead of feta as bacon is so salty already and LOVED it! Pounded the chicken also and it made for great folding. Will make it again!

This is great.  However, I found it to be a little rich.  I will cut back on the oil next time and maybe add some spinach in with the bacon and feta cheese.

This was good.  Next time maybe a hair more lemon juice.  I can't find Feta slices so I used crumbles.  Average reaction to this dish was 4.5 stars so I put 5.  Thank you.

This was delicious! I made an alfredo pasta for the side, and the flavours went together perfectly! I ended up cutting up the chicken and mixing it in with the pasta.

Very Good. Excellent flavor. Followed recipe exactly, added a touch more lemon though. Only had feta crumbles but it worked great. Put some crumbled bacon and feta on top as well. Will definitely make again. Thanks !

Really, very delicious!  I did change a few things, in keeping with my family's preferences.  I added chopped tomatoes to the "stuffing" and used fresh basil instead of oregano.  Also, I added dried, crushed lemon verbena and about 1/4 cup white wine to the olive oil mixture that you pour on top.  I was a bit concerned the chicken might dry out on top, but it didn't.  It was succulent and wonderful--very mediterranean, and a big hit with the fam.  

Next time, I think I will even make a cream sauce of the leftover juices/wine mixture to pour over the finished chicken.  It will make for a great presentation and if the chicken DOES get a bit dry on top, will mask it. I love this recipe! Many thanks for sharing.

This recipe was FANTASTIC! I marinated the chicken over night in olive oil, minced garlic, and italian seasonings. I only made two chicken breasts but still made the same amount of sauce that the origional recipe called for. I followed one of the tips to cut a pocket in the chicken to stuff the crumbled bacon and feta mix. I then rolled the chicken, placed it in baking dish and topped with the sauce. I basted it about every 15 min until cooked all the way through- checked temp with a meat thermometer.

Our family really enjoyed this and it was an easy meal.  I made it with the all ingredients but added a little more lemon juice, used more bacon and used flavored feta because I happened to ahve that in the fridge.  Instead of rolling them up, I basically set the feta and bacon on top of each breast, pulled up the sides, and fastened with toothpicks.   I also had to cook it 45 minutes.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband is a very picky eater, and I figured since he likes bacon and chicken, I would try this. I substituted the Feta cheese with Swiss cheese, and the chicken came out amazing. My husband loved it as well as my 2 yr old daughter. This was an AMAZING recipe.

Well worth making - this is company fare, but so easy you can spend lots of time with your guests. I halved the oil mixture; also mashed the feta as others suggested and chopped up the cooked bacon and mixed it with the feta before stuffing the breasts. Yummy! Great recipe Gillian.

Terrific Recipe.   I added a little more bacon than the recipe calls for and it's okay to be generous with the Feta.  I made this for some friends and they loved it so much that they requested me make it again the next time they came over.

This was all in all a good dish. Followed directions exactly. The seasoning was very good although there was a little too much lemon taste on the bottom of the chicken so next time I make it I was use 1/2 teaspoon less lemon juice and more garlic. Also, next time I will use 2 stips bacon for each and mozzarella cheese so you can taste it more. Will definately make again with just a few changes. A definate keeper.

I thought this would be really tasty but it was very bland.  We couldn't even taste the cheese or bacon because the oregano was too overpowering.  Sorry I wouldn't recommend or cook this again.

I was very excited to make this recipe because of the good ratings, and it looked delicious,  but we didnt like this recipe, not at all. It was aweful, this was the worst recipe I ever made all my life. My husband said it was horrible. Sorry :(

I was so pleased with this dish and my husband loved it also.  The cheese put a new twist to it and complimented the chicken.  Great dish and easy to prepare.

While the dish was easy to make, the oil mixture was rather disappointing.  It was not at all to my liking.  The feta and bacon stuffing was savory and paired rather nicely with the chicken.  However, a different exterior coating is called for.

this dish wasn't as flavorful as I expected. The chicken was also quite dry, even though I cooked it as suggested. Thinner chicken & more marinating time could help. But I wasn't impressed.

Wonderful flavor!  My husband, who has very limited cooking experience, was able to easily follow the directions and make a great meal.  We had never prepared a meal with feta cheese before, so I wasn't sure if I'd like it.  The combination of feta, bacon, garlic, and oregano was awesome!  Every bite tasted great.  This will definitely become a regular meal choice from now on.  Thank you for posting!  We paired it with snap peas, but I think grilled fresh asparagus would also compliment nicely.

Yummy, very easy and good.  My guests loved it.  Watch the salt.  I added a little salt and pepper before baking, and I really didn't need to.
Thanks for this one, its a keeper

This was very good, did not take as long as recipe suggested to cook, so watch it.  Since it is split for stuffing, it takes less time, I wrapped in bacon also as one lady suggested, as well as bacon cooked inside, and bought a brick of flavored feta rather than plain.  I doubled liquid, but it was too much, saved rest for another use.  Was great leftover sliced for a sandwich or cut up in a salad. I would make it again.

Easy to cook and very tasty dish. I used previous suggestions and wrapped each breast in additional bacon slice. It took me more than 30 minutes, though. More like 45-50.

This recipe was a hit with my boyfriend and his parents!  Like the rest of us..I used crumbled feta and added extra bacon (which I chopped up and placed in chicken so that there is bacon with every bite of chicken)  After tasting and reading reviews..I agree that unless you are die hard garlic lover..then maybe only 2 cloves of garlic.  Besides that-this recipe was great!

This recipe was very tasty and easy to prepare, plus everyone loved it!  The feta cheese and bacon added a wonderful taste to the chicken.  I basted the chicken a few times just to keep them most.

This was a very good recipe.  It was easy and although I cooked mine a little longer than recommended; it was fast.  I couldn't get feta cheese slices in my neck of the woods.  Are they available in other areas?  I used crumpled feta and extra bacon and everyone enjoyed it.  I will make it again.

this was very tasty...the only change i did was added 4 tbsp of lemon juice as the more the better in our house..however, i would like to point out for some reviewers who substituted "goat's cheese" instead of feta that authentic FETA cheese is made from goat's or sheep milk...thanks for the recipe gillian

Incredible.  Raves from the entire family (minus the terribly picky eater).  I followed others advice and put a second piece of bacon (partially cooked) around the chicken breast.  So tasty.

I recently took over the cooking duties in our house and I am not an experienced cook. However, this was very easy to prepare and although I think I may have overcooked it just a little, it was very good. Very easy and very good, what more do you want?

Everyone loved this, my 5 y/o daughter calls them cheeseburger chickens.  Even my picky eater asks me to make this all the time.  I made 8 servings but I didn't double the oil - worked out great!

"Eh."  That's all, just "eh".  Nothing spectacular here.  As noted by other reviewers, this recipe calls for too much oil & oregano.  I cut back on those ingredients & added more lemon juice to the sauce.  I also used a kalamata olive/sun-dried tomato feta and still the flavor was just average.

This is a great recipe!  For once I wasn't hearing "chicken again?!?!" from  my kids.  They all love it and it wasn't hard to make at all. This one is definitely being added to the "let's do that again" list.

These were fabulous!  I did reduce the oil to 5 tsp as suggested and it seemed fine.  Everyone liked them.  Will definately make these again.

My husband and I liked this alot and it was really easy.  Next time I may pound the chicken a bit to make it easier to stuff and I will also cut back on the oil.  It does turn out really lovely and would be great main dish for a Mediterranean supper for guests.

It wasn' the best  but it was pretty good. I added the dried chopped tomatoes (one per breast) - it refreshed the dish.

This was a good part of my Greek dinner.  The lemon oil it is cooked with adds a wonderful flavor.  It was a bit dry, but I probably overcooked my chicken a little.  I will make this again.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe but got crumbled fetta instead of blocks (much cheaper) and in the toping for the chicken I added basil and Rosemary and it gave it a nice flavor!

This was very easy to make and it tasted great. I did let it marinade for about an hour before baking it, and I wrapped a strip of bacon around each breast to hold it together.
I will definitely be making this again.

This was delicious, but I substituted the feta cheese with sharp cheddar cheese! It turned out great. Served my own recipe for Cole slaw on the side and topped it off with dessert of cottage cheese on lettuce leaves with peach halves and watermelon slices!

I doubled the lemon and added a teaspoon of honey to the mix. Nothing but empty plates at the end. The bacon and feta just go great together. Will make this again anytime.

I've had this recipe printed out since 2009 & don't think I ever made it cause I didn't have it rated. What a mistake, it is a keeper & then some. I used smoked gouda cheese which gave it a nice flavor. We also marinated the chicken for several hours. I do want to try stuffing it with some fresh spinach sometime. It won't take me that long to make again that is for sure. This is easy to make & tastes like a "special" meal entree.

I like to make recipes exactly as written the first time.  As submitted, this is a good basic recipe resulting in very tender chicken.  However I thought the cheese/bacon stuffing was kind of underwhelming.  I want to try this again but alter the stuffing to add more flavor & pizazz.  It smelled absolutely delicious while baking & I was so excited to take a bite but it's missing something.  Too bland as written.

I pounded the chicken to 1/2 inch and marinated it for several hours.  Then I added the feta and bacon, folded the chicken and baked for 30 minutes.  I wanted it alittle brown on the top, so I put the chicken under the broiler after basting it with the juices.  Delicious!!!

I gave it four stars because I didn't follow it exactly, but I rarely follow recipes exactly. I added sundried tomatoes to the filling and had marinated the chicken breasts for about 2 hours... absolutely delicious!!

Really enjoyed this but made a few changes. I added herbs de provence to crumbled feta and the crumbled bacon. Then I butterflied the chicken and covered it with the cheese/ bacon mix. I marinated the chicken in the lemon juice mix and dumped it in the bottom of the pan when baking the chicken. Came out great!

I used slightly more feta than directions call for and still could barely taste the feta or bacon

I made this for a Christmas dinner with my friends.  I think I used about two thirds of the oil,  and I also put half a slice of bacon on top of the breasts. It was so delicious! We had plenty,  but I wanted more!

I made this per the instructions  and I loved it.  The flavors were really pronounced by the feta cheese. I think when I make it again,  I will try using goat cheese,  as I saw in other reviews.  Thank you!

This is super good, it tastes a lot like greek chicken.  i also sprinkled the top with Feta and bacon.  Very good.  I was afraid it was going to be weird i have never stuffed anything but it went fine i used crumbles and sliced feta.

substituted the oregano with basil pesto - stuffed it with the bacon and cheese not added with oil garlic etc. It was delicious - makes boring chicken interesting

My husband, my teen and I loved it!  I only made one change, and that change made it a little more fattening, I cooked the chicken in some of the bacon grease. That  added more flavor. I will definitely make this again for my family!

VERY VERY GOOD!  My husband and I enjoyed every mouthful.  He also said that it was easy to eat.  You were able to cut it and the slices and stuffing stayed together.  It was easy for me to put together.  I will give myself a little more time to marinade the chicken next time.  That is the only change!  We loved it!

This was a well liked dish in my house (and my kids are picky!) *I only had limes, so I used that rather than lemon.* I will say it is very rich in flavor so less is more. Next time I will use less feta as I used the crumbles and I used too much. I will also add no salt to the dish until it is done as the bacon and feta had a lot of salt in it! (And I love Salt!) The appearance is lacking for a more formal looking dish, I would say. And you should serve it with another food that would help cut the richness of this dish, IMO. I may tweak this recipe and use moz cheese for the kids next time. All in all, a good dish!

We loved this. Very rich flavour. I was surprised by a few comments that it lacked flavour .... ours did not. 
The only modification I made was that I didn't have chicken breasts, only thighs, so I used those instead. Fabulous.
We decided that it was so rich that next time we would do a baked apple and serve those pieces with it to cut the richness a bit ... but this is hardly an indictment. If you are a complete novice just make sure to reverse steps 2 & 3, otherwise you'll be cursing someone. I'm intrigued by a couple other reviewers who suggested increasing the amount of lemon juice ... it sounds like a good idea. Regardless, this has entered my KEEPER BOOK.

I had Black Forrest Ham and Swiss Cheese that I needed to use up instead of Bacon and Feta.  Raves all around the table including my three-year old.

Delicious! After reading reviews I stood in the grocery store deciding between feta cheese chuncks and goat cheese, we do not use either much but decided to follow the recipe.  Glad I did! Remembered after eating this dish that we really did not care for goat cheese after trying it in another recipe! 
So I did cut the oregano in half and added basil for the other half, put a splash more lemon juice and cut the oil down to 5 T.
I cut my pockets into the chicken and then pricked the top of chicken with fork to let the chicken absorb the oil sauce better., marinated all afternoon.
Stuffed with the cheese and crispy bacon bits while coming up to room temperature. My slits were small so really did not need much closing. But did wrap 1/2 way cooked bacon around the tops of the chicken breasts and secured with toothpicks.
I spooned the oil sauce over each breast again.
When done cooking- spooned oil over breasts again and put under broiler just to add color.
We loved the dish- even my very picky daughter ate her entire portion. I am glad I have feta left over as we will  be making this again and again!
Thanks for a great recipe!

I butterflied the chicken, used goat cheese instead of feta, also used 2tbsp. of lemon instead of 2 tsp. Placed it on top of some Mediterranean quinoa. Amazing and simple! My husband said it was the best stuffed chicken he had ever had. A keeper!

This was so much easier than I anticipated.  The only issue for me was, I only had a brick of white cheddar on hand (though goat cheese sounds delicious as well!) and I cut it up into tiny cubes.  I put a slice of bacon inside each piece of chicken breast and wrapped the outside with another.  I couldn't believe that the chicken maintained its shape and that it wasn't a huge gooey mess when all was said and done!  Yum!

I modified the recipe a little bit.  I used Italian seasoning instead of oregano, added bread crumbs on top of the chicken which I then poured the lemon/oil mixture over, and I used Mozzarella cheese which I also added on top as well as inside.  My boyfriend and I liked it, but I didn't feel that I would make it again until the following day when we put the leftovers on a burger roll.  Oh was it heaven!  We liked that much better and will definitely be making this again but serving it on a roll! My boyfriend just texted me and told me he's craving that sandwich as he's at work right now! Thanks so much!

This was very good and the chicken was very moist.  The next time I make it, I plan to use less oregano.  1 tablespoon was a little too overpowering for us.

This dish was easy to make and makes a great impression on guests!  I loved the mixture poured over the chicken; it really added a lot of flavor.  Will use this again and again!

I thought this had great flavor and very easy to make.  I think I will try not precooking the bacon next time.  Yum!

The BEST! I took the breast and cut in the center and stuffed it with crumbled feta cheese and bacon. The bacon did not dry out this way. It wasn't until after I made the chicken is when I realized that you were supposed to fold the chicken. Well either way, it was great. This is a dish that you NEED to follow as is.

As I was making this recipe, I realised why the pictures confused me so! The breasts aren't stuffed per se; they're wrapped around the feta and bacon. Anyway, I had already cut pockets into the breasts, so I just put the feta and bacon inside them as I had originally assumed. The bacon didn't turn out soggy at all. The oil, juice, and spices drizzled over the breasts is simple and delicious.

I stuffed the chicken with fresh basil and used crumbled feta since its what I had on hand. Per other reviewers, I wrapped a slice of bacon around each chicken breast, it was delicious!

I usually don't make changes in recipes and then comment on them but I've tried a variation of this one before and didn't care for the softness of the bacon so I wrapped the breast in bacon instead of stuffing them and seasoned very well with seasoned salt, drizzled in olive oil and wow what a dish...

OMG. This is a favorite in my home.  I use flavored feta (tomato basil) which works well with the seasonings in the lemon/oil mixture.  Absolutely a hit.

Used some chopped spinach (thawed) to help the pieces of feta cheese 'hold together.' Very, very good!

I got this recipe from my sister in law. I love it! We did it a little different. We got crumbled tomato and basil feta cheese, and stuffed the chicken breast with the cheese. I also wrapped the bacon around the chicken and secured it with toothpicks. I used all the spices and add rosemary leaves. It was fantasic. Boyfriend loved it also. Already made twice now. I would for sure recommend this to everyone I know.

I made this for my husband and he wouldn't stop talking about how good it was. The only thing I did different was wrap uncooked bacon around the outside of the chicken before baking so it was a little crisy on top.

So yummy.  I substituted a few things though, I used spinach and fresh grated parmesan cheese inside the breasts and wrapped two pieces of bacon around each. It came out delicious, and even my picky 7-year old loved it.  It's hard to find interesting chicken recipes, so this was a hit!

Very good!  I'm not sure where you can find slices of feta so I used the crumbled.  Rather than going through the mess of frying up baking I used the precooked kind.  Easy, tasty, and a delightful presentation.

very good recipe! I made a few alterations i added more lemon juice and used garlic powder instead of garlic chunks...only because i ran out of real garlic.I also added American cheese. But the chicken was very very tender and i didnt even marinate it like other viewers said they did. I was worried about not marinating it,but i just didnt have the time. It still turned out great though! Thanks for the recipe!

None of my family really cared for this dish.  I made as directed, except used crumbled feta rather than sliced.  It was a bit dry, but that's my fault for cooking a few extra minutes.  Okay.  Probably a good dish, just not to our tastes.

This recipe is so easy to make and so delicious. It sounds like you spent a lot of time in the kitchen making and in reality it takes about 20 minutes tops. The only thing I would add is a little more lemon juice to give it more of a tang, but that is just personal preference. 
Def try this!!! YUMMY!!!!

This is delicious.  I am a huge fan of bacon so did 2 slices per breast and used a small palm full of crumbled feta instead of slices.  Tasted great and cooked up juicy.

This just didnt have much taste to it. The chicken was plain and boring,even with the bacon and cheese. I gave it 2 stars because I did like the olive oil and lemon juice flavor.

I don't know why this has such rave reviews.  I wanted to make something special for my husband after a weekend away.  The only alteration I made was crumbling the feta and bacon.  I enjoyed the flavor of the marinade. I managed to eat half of it and my husband who eats EVERYTHING . . took one bite and politely asked me if he had to finish the rest.  What a waste!!

This meal was good but perhaps because we've never really eaten feta cheese like this, it seemed a little over-powering for our non-greek tastes. We liked it and I used feta cheese instead of goat (mostly because we came across the feta cheese in the grocery store first) so next time I'll try the goat cheese but if that still doesn't suit our tastebuds I'll later try a more basic cheese. My husband does not like what he considers to be the "smelly cheeses". Thanks for a good recipe though. I just have to modify it for us specifically.

My very picky children loved this recipe. I was a little less thrilled with it (bacon and feta are both very powerful flavors), but I had to write a favorable review based on the kids' reaction. Rarely do they ask for more meat, but they did tonight!

This chicken recipe was divine! Like others, I halved the oil (it just seemed like way too much) and increased the lemon juice. I also pounded the breasts before I stuffed them. This one is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!! :)

I used this recipe tonight and my wife went nuts. She is now planing a dinner party using this. I will be cooking this with rice and a Greek salad.  he only change I made with the chicken was to use chicken breast with the bone.

I flattened out the chicken and wrapped it up sealing with toothpicks.  This was ok, the chicken was extremely juicy and flavorful, I am just not sure I loved the feta.  May try again with another cheese.  It was easy to cook so its a great recipe in a rush.

I made this recipe for a small luncheon I catered.  I used 2 extra tbsp lemon juice and used goat cheese.  Served it over rice pilaf and they just raved!!!  Very simple prep, just takes a little effort, but the results were worth it.

Wonderful. Only thing I did differently was cut the olive oil in half to reduce some calories & fat, and upped the lemon juice just a tad. It might be good if you tried marinading the chicken in the olive oil and stuff for a few hours first. Soooo good. This is going to be a regular in our house for sure. Thanks!! :)

This was amazing. I did pound the chicken first to flatten it more. I let the chicken marinate in the lemon/oil mix while i prepared everything. I used crumbled tomato basil feta. I cooked 5 slices of bacon and crumbled it. I mixed the crumbled bacon with the feta and about 1/2 cup of parmesan. Placed the mixture in the chicken,rolled it up and the took a slice of raw bacon and wrapped it around the chicken. Then I rolled in italian style bread crumbs. Placed it in the dish and pour the remaining lemon juice/oil mix over the top.Absolutely no leftovers!!!!!!!!!!!

This recipe was GREAT.  Since i dont eat pork, the only change i made was turkey bacon.  Other than that, everything was awesome.

Really good!  I liked how the cheese stayed inside the chicken instead of oozing out like Swiss. The bacon I used was not my regular brand and cooked up to nothing, so it didn't add much. Everyone liked this, hubby even had seconds.  I am used to pounding chicken, so this was fairly easy and quick to make.  I made it according to recipe, and the "sauce" was tasty too. I might put some chopped olives inside the chicken next time. (And GOOD bacon:)) Thanks for adding another tasty chicken recipe to my rotation!

Very tasty and easy to make.  Used real bacon bits instead of strips and it was a good time saver and tasted great.  Next time I will try adding mushrooms like some others suggested.

This was a very good meal!  I doubled the sauce, added some rosemary and basil, and let the chicken marinade while I cooked the bacon.  Once the chicken was done, I removed it from the pan and poured cooked pasta into the marinade.  The remaining sauce gave an excellent flavor to the pasta without making the overall meal too heavy.

I'll definitely give this one a try again, but maybe with some tweaks: - I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and wrapped the chicken breast in bacon, as well as stuffing it. I never thought this was possible, but it was actually too much bacon. Wow. - You definitely need to pound the breasts out, or you'll end up with stuff oozing all over the place, and it also makes for an interesting baking experience. Otherwise, we liked the flavors, and the way the different textures worked together.

These were really good.  I also wrapped them in a piece of bacon.  My 3 year old didn't put down her fork!  
I think next time I may try blue cheese.

I didn't have enough Feta so I used the goat cheese as one suggested and it mixed with the bacon bits and it was SCRUMPTIOUS!  I think I will marinate the chicken breasts a little differently next time to intensify the flavor but overall,, WONDERFUL

Great easy recipe. I agree with the reviewer below about using a little less oil. I added one super thin slice of mozzarella along with a heaping tablespoon of crumbled feta cheese. I also used turkey bacon. An option is defintely to add some spinach. I husband and kids said to definitely make again...and I will.

This was excellent!  I agree that the amount of oil called for isn't needed.  I didn't have bacon in the house but did have the real bacon bits (in the pouch).  I also had the Kraft Crumbles (Medditerranean Flavor).  It was great!

If you want to substitute something like spinach, make sure to really up the spice!
