10 stars! This recipe made delicious and fluffy cookies.  I only used 1 1/2 tsp. of cinammon because I was running low, but it still tasted wonderful.  I also whipped the egg whites  before folding them in to make them extra fluffy.  Tip: if the dough starts sticking to your hands when you're rolling them, spray your hands with some non-stick cooking spray.  Also, I ended up lowering the temperature to 375 and cooking for a full 8 minutes (the bottoms dont end up as burnt).

This cookie was very yummy! I only used 1 egg, 1 cup of sugar, and fat free cream cheese it still came out fantastic!

A very tasty lower fat/calorie cookie.  I am on Weight Watchers and they are only 3 points each!  The dough can be sticky so be sure to spray your cookie sheet with a non-stick spray.  I also sprayed my hands with the non-stick spray to make it easier to roll the balls out.  Watch your bake time!  These taste dry if you bake too long - all of mine came out perfect at 7 min.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were *so* good. More cake-like than the high-fat version, but still just as tasty. Make sure you watch them so they don't burn. They'll still look like they need to go back in the oven for a couple of minutes when they're done as they don't brown as much as a regular cookie (check the bottoms). I ended up baking mine for about 6 minutes, and they were perfect. I'll make this one again.

Excellent cookies!  My husband is very picky and usually doesn't like it when I lighten things.  His cholesterol is high so now we're doing more lightening and he LOVED these.

I really apreciated this recipe as I am watching my fat intake and am addicted to sweets.  My kids didn't care for them, but I thought they were really good for a "diet" cookie.  Thanks, Lisa!

These are very tasty!  The cream cheese gives a great flavor to the cookies, and they stay soft and chewy.

Delicious! I love anything with cream cheese in it. These are so good!  I see several people leaving out the cream of tartar but to me snickerdoodles have to have it! That's the way my grammy always made them. Thanks for sharing.

These are one of my favorite cookies!!! I use unsweetened applesauce instead of the egg, fat-free cream cheese & light margarine. They always turn out really well!

WOW!  I actually prefer these over a regular snickerdoodle.  Made as directed, these cookies had a little crunch on the outside, but were soft and tender on the inside.  I flattened them before baking and then gave them another little push down after about 5 minutes in the oven when the dough was softer.  They turned out perfectly round.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Maybe I'm dumb, but after making this recipe for three years, I finally figured out an easier way to roll the dough in the cinnamon/sugar mix- so I'll pass it on for any other baking newbies like me!

as this dough is really sticky, instead of rolling a ball, then rolling it in the dough, it works better to roll a batch of balls at once, then roll them in the cinna/sugar. this cuts down on the amount of times you have to flour your hands.

The first time I made these I did not have white sugar so I used light brown sugar. I didn't rate them because I had changed the recipe. This time I followed it to the "t" and I just did not think these tasted like a regular snickerdoodle. They were a little cake-like and not that sweet to me. They tasted kind of plain. I actually liked them better when I used brown sugar (but you have to watch them because they burn easily). I cooked them on 375 for ten minutes...I cut them kind of thick. They were ok.

I really wanted to like these but just can't say that I did.  I had 4 oz of cream cheese to use up which is the only reason I found this recipe.  I doubt I'll ever do it again.  These are more cakey than the normal snickerdoodles which probably is why I don't care for them.  :-(

Overall really good recipe. I made some changes: just used 2 eggs instead of dealing with the 1 egg+ 2 egg whites; substituted 1/4 cup of brown sugar for 1/4 cup of the white; baked them at 380 for 10-14 mins (although next time I will just do 400 because I dont think they ever were going to burn). I didn't find the dough too sticky to deal with but you have to refrigerate it first for a few hours and stick it back in the fridge between batches. Everyone I've given them to really likes them. I would give them 5 stars but the second batch came out so different from the first even though I did nothing to the dough in between. Must have been the difference between putting them on a hot pan v. a cool one? Who knows. But I would recommend it.

I was very excited to try this recipe, but the cookies just didn't turn out for me. I probably did something wrong. My cookies were definitly too thick. I will try this again and re-rate it . thanks for posting.

These are sooooo good!  I used fat free cream cheese and baked them at 375 for 8 minutes on a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper.  They have the perfect amount of sweetness/softness/chewiness.  My roommate couldn't even tell they were "light" cookies, and he says snickerdoodles are his favorite!  I am a bit of a calorie freak, and these only have 65 calories per cookie the way I made them-- definitely a healthy alternative and thus, a KEEPER!

Not my favorite. Very obviously low fat. I would rather eat one real cookie than 4 low fat ones. They were ok when they first came out of the oven but now I can't give them away, no one wants them.

A very good cookie.  I made mine a little larger and only flattened them slighlty.  Still they were done in 8 minutes, so be careful NOT to overcook them.  Although the dough is very sticky- I will make them again.

A great tasty (mild flavor & moist) cookie recipe.  If you want a flat cookie, be sure to really flatten the dough balls to 1/8 inch, if not, they will turn out puffy.

This recipe made the yummiest and softest snickerdoodles!!!  I ran short on cream of tarter, but they still turned out delicious!!  Will make again, and again, and again!!!  The first round I think I made to big, so I adjusted to a smaller size and they cooked better all the way through.

Excellent recipe! Light and fluffy--not at all the consistency of the "full-fat" snickerdoodle, but it has ALL the flavor. We'll definitely be making this again! Three thumbs WAY up!!  :)

These taste great! They even held up (and actually turned out looking better in my opinion) using gluten-free flour. These will become a holiday staple for sure.

I don't understand these at all, I did everything to a "T" and they were just odd.  I don't see how "slightly flattening" them will get them in the shape of a cookie.  Mine were basically balls of dough rolled in sugar.  They came out the way they went in it seems, lol.  Not particularly sure I want to investigate.

These turned out fabulously! I put about 3/4 C of butter and a little less than 4 oz of cream cheese in. I didn't measure to the exact and they still turned out. On one batch I cooked longer than 10; for a minute and 50 seconds longer, just to see if longer was better. Ends up, 10 minutes is just perfect. The cookie is light, soft, and a bit moist. (the others are still yummy. They will be eaten, but a bit dryer). Thank you for the recipe!

I absolutely love snickerdoodles and these were the best. I can not tell they are lighter one bit. They are wonderful, no changes made.

This is a VERY tasty alternative snickerdoodle recipe.  I'm not giving it five stars because I like the full fat version better, but this is really quite nice. My biggest thing missing from this recipe is the crispness that I get from the version with more fat.

Really Great! Tasted Amazing, not "diet" at all. I even froze half the dough for a few days and then made the rest then. Yum.

This is one of my first attempts at cooking cookies from scratch. Great recipe, but for a novice like myself, you might want to add the part about greasing the cookie sheet, as I burned my first batch. Great recipe though!

I reduced the temp to 350 because I was making other cookies at the same time. The were wonderful. I couldn't tell which ones were the light snickerdoodles and which ones were full fat. My cookies looked like second picture not the one displayed with the recipe.

Awesome, awesome, awesome!  I took these alongwith an oatmeal raisin cookie that I had also reduced the fat content and these went the fastest!  I was having trouble with the stickiness of the dough, so ended up using a spoon and then tossing it in the cinnamon mixture, worked great.  Tried with the nonstick spray on my hands but had to spray my hands each time which I found to be a hassle.

Snickerdoodles are a favorite of mine, and these were great.  I love the softness and the fact that they are lower in fat.

The reviews for this recipe were good, so I doubled my first batch, and I'm so glad I did! My husband says they are AWESOME and he eats them for breakfast, lunch and midnight snack. Do not overbake these and they will stay wonderfully soft.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Will definately make again and again.

Cookie is still soft after several days.  Tastes good, considering it's a "lower fat" cookie.  To avoid getting my hands all sticky with the dough, I used a small ice cream scoop to release the dough into the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  Once it gets coated, it's easy to transfer to the baking sheet.

Love, love love these. They taste just like the full fat version - and I used a vegan egg replacement. They are soft though - not for crunchy cookie fans.

I made these cookies at Christmas, and I loved this recipe!  I used some lemon juice instead of cream of tartar, and they still turned out very tasty.  These cookies didn't stick around- I gave some to friends and family and everyone commented on them.  They are definitely light and fluffy, with just the right amount of flavor!  Definitely a successful recipe.

This cookie wasn't bad.  It isn't as good as the original snickerdoodle recipe.  For a cookie that doesn't use shortening it is ok.  I probably will not make this cookie again.

I would have marked this w/3 stars because I thought the cookies were a bit dry but at work they loved them so I'm giving them a 4.  I added a tsp of almond extract which I think improved the cookies tremendously. Without that addition I probably would not have liked the cookies as much.  I will make them again but will try to find a way to make them less dry....or just bring the whole batch to work!

they were pretty much dense hockey pucks. 1st batch were doughy but burned on bott9ms at 400 so I lowered 2nd batch to 350 and baked about twice as long. they were ok,but guess I'll stick with a higher fat version.

This was a great recipe! It could have had less toppings though, and it tastes amazing if you add some nutmeg to the topping. Also, only cook it for 8 min!!! It becomes to hard otherwise!

I made the cookie a little healthier by substituting one cup of whole wheat flour for white flour.  The cookie is a little dryer than the full butter version, but very good.

These were light and chewy....I liked them as an alternative to the cookies that use shortening. I didn't have a problem with the dough being sticky, but I refrigerated the dough overnight. Also stuck it back in the fridge between cookie batches....reminds me of cinnamon toast.

This is an all-time favorite.  I make these every year on Christmas Eve.  The hardest part is rolling them into balls without getting sticky.  I've tried flour and baking spray, but it still makes a mess.  I end up just dropping dallops of dough into the sugar/cinnamon mixture, tossing to coat, and then rolling.  Not quite as pretty, but still taste wonderful.

Thank you for this great recipe. The only thing I did was add Cinnamon chips. It added a warmth to the cookie.

They taste like Cinnamon and Sugar cake cookies! Which I LOVE! Not as crunchy as I remember but I am a new cook. The raw dough is a battle to be won...I did not win. So I kinda plopped it in the mixture and rolled it from there! :)

These are AMAZING!!! I'm considering using the dough for other types of cookies too because I love the moist-ness and texture. Only thing I did different was instead of rolling it in the mixture I sprinkled it on top. Delish!

Great cookie! They turned out light and fluffy.  I took the advice of spraying mu hands with cooking spray so the dough wouldn't stick. Will make again for sure! Thanks Warren!

These tasted just okay. They sat around until the last ones got stale and I tossed them out. But the reason I will never make them again was how difficult the dough was to work with. Simply chilling wasn't enough. I had to freeze the dough so it wouldn't stick to everything. And even then, the dough was getting too sticky to deal with before I could get a pan ready to go in the oven. Simply not worth the hassle of the super sticky dough.

Great Cookie! Everyone loved them.  Couldn't tell it was low fat.  I'm always looking for a low fat recipe!  I did exactly like the recipe.  Used non-stick spray on hands too.

These turned out perfectly! I followed the recipe, except for also slighly beating the egg whites before adding them into the mix. As other reviews state, they don't seem completely done when you first remove them from the oven, but they cool to a chewy/fluffy great cookie! ^.^

I had to use up egg whites and came upon this recipe.  I probably won't make them again unless I run into a similar situation.  Regular snickerdoodles are definitely better.  As PF says, if you're going to have a cookie, have a cookie.

I thought these turned out very well on the first try.  I liked the fact that they were small cookies - very cute, and people liked that they were lower fat.  Make sure to watch not to overcook them since they are so small.

Are you sure these are low fat? I can't believe how tasty these are. I am so glad I ran across this recipe. I made them a little smaller, kind of like chippers, and froze them for little snacks. They are so good!

I doubled the recipe and used light instead of low fat cream cheese. Our family loves soft cookies and these are perfect. I also made some w/ green and red sugar for Christmas. They are sticky as you are trying to roll them. I tried to keep my hands cold!!
