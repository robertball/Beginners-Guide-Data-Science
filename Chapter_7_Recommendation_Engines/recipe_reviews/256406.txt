This was good tasting. I didn't care for the consistency. If I make it again, I will brown the ground beef first, with the onions and peppers and not cook it as long. It was a bit mushy. I would add more rice and add it late in the cooking process, that also was too mushy.  I did add a small amount of turmeric, marjoram and chili powder.
