I rarely make Beef Stroganoff because the meat is so expensive and the perfect sauce takes forever.  I used this recipe, only using 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup (all I had), and fresh mushrooms that needed to be used.  My picky husband is eyeing his third plate.  Should I try to stop him or let him explode? ??  This is a great recipe!

I'm 13 and don't really like to cook that much. This was super easy and kind of fun. Something for thought, I added Tuscan bread on the side. I will DEFINITELY make this again.

I made a few minor changes.  The guys in my family dislike mushrooms (how sad) so I had to omit those.  In their place, I added a stalk of celery I had.  I chopped it up and added it into the ingredients when everything was mixed together. (the noodles and the sauce). Everyone loved it and the celery added a nice crunch to it.  I added bread and a salad and it was an awesome, inexpensive meal!
*UPDATE* I had my husband recreate the meal a few night ago, as I was busy.  His tasted a lot better....less salty.  The texture was a bit lighter too.  We found out later that evening that he forgot the sour cream and instead of using butter, he used extra virgin olive oil.  I prefer this to the original recipe.  He also added a can of corn, a can of sweet peas, and an extra half lb. of ground beef.  This gave us enough for seconds, lunches, and leftovers.  I believe the substitutes, additions, and omitting the sour cream made this recipe healthier.

Husband loves it!  I fry onions and fresh mushrooms and set them aside.  Brown hamburger and drain fat.  Add flour for a couple of minutes then soups and mushrooms/onions.  Add garlic and a bit of seasoning salt and Worchestire sauce to taste.  I find 1/2 to 3/4 cup sour cream is enough and also add approximately 1/2 c milk to thin sauce a bit.

Oh my...this is WAY TOO SALTY...i should have went with my instincts and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, but since none of the reviews mentioned it being too salty i didnt....could have got at least 4 stars if not for that.  The soup is salty enough as it is, garlic powder will work just fine and you can add salt if you feel it needs it.  I also suggest omitting the flour step and draining the grease from the hamburger, it seems the only purpose the flour serves is to soak up the grease, plus just takes more work - i felt the end result was too thick anyway

Three modifications were made:  
1)  No onions
2)  No sour cream
3)  Proper seasoning w/ salt and pepper to the raw ground beef just prior to cooking.

Made this for my wife almost exactly as is for dinner tonight, and she loved it!  We've been struggling for a while to find a stroganoff recipe that she really likes.  This is complicated by the fact that she's not really a fan of sour cream.  Since this recipe called for a small amount of sour cream and no cream cheese, I picked it, and I'm glad I did:)

Anyway, we were so impressed with how well it tasted for being such a simple recipe that I've already saved it away for later use.

To be honest I was very skeptical of this recipe. Mixture of cream of mushroom with cream of chicken and sour cream; however this was very delicious. Sorry Betty Crocker but this recipe beats the recipe I made hands down! Thank you for sharing. Yummy will make this again.

This is a very simple and tasty way to make stroganoff.  A couple of things I added to give it more flavor:  A little Worcestershire sauce, some cooking Sherry and I added crushed garlic instead of garlic salt, as other reviewers did.  I would definitely make this again!

You don't need soup. Add cup of beef broth, then thicken, then add sour cream.

I've been making this for years. The flour is unnecessary. You can sautee the mushrooms with the onions and ground beef. Add the soups one at a time heating each through, then add sour cream and just mix to combine. If you heat too much it can curdle. Quick, easy and delicious. One of my go to's.

Hubby loved it!  I used about 1.5 lbs of ground beef, a clove of garlic (smashed) and salt instead of the garlic salt, and also 1/2 lb of fresh mushrooms instead of canned mushrooms.

It felt weird to put in cream of chicken soup into a beef dish, but it turned out great.  Loved how easy it was.

I made this for dinner tonight because I had hamburger that needed to be used or it was going to spoil. I followed the directions exactly with two exceptions. I did not have fresh mushrooms or cream of mushroom. I did not have anything to substitute so I just went with 2 cans of cream of chicken. I also added a few dashes of Worcestershire Sauce when I added the soup. Served over rice because I did not have egg noodles. Will make this again! It was so yummy!

This was fabulous! My boyfriend said it was the best stroganoff he's ever had. The only thing I would do differently next time is either cut the butter down or omit it completely. It was just added fat and wasn't necessary. Will definitely make again!

In a desperate search for an easy meal to serve my family, I tried this recipe. My husband & son really liked it. I did make a few changes. 1) I only used a 1/2 onion along with fresh garlic - sauteed - rather than garlic powder or garlic salt; 2) I set the sauteed onion & garlic aside while browning the hamburger. After the hamburger was browned,  I drained the grease  then added sauteed garlic & onion with the flour; 3) instead of sour cream, I used Greek yogurt. I took the suggestion of another person by adding a splash of worcestershire sauce along with a tablespoon of dry white wine. This was pretty tasty.

I love this on family dinner nights! The only thing I change, is the garlic salt, I only use 1/2tsp, otherwise I think it over powers the dish.

I gave this 5 stars not only for the ease of preparation but also for the taste!  This was surprisingly good even though I really didn't think the presentation was that great.  My husband loved it and I will keep this one on hand for those nights when I need something quick and comforting to feed him!

A perfect week night supper!  Was super quick, easy and tasty!  My 2 and 4 year old had 3 helpings!!  I made it exactly (almost) as written...minus the flour because I completely forgot about it until after and I also omitted the garlic salt because I'm not a fan of salt and would rather add it after on the side if each individual wants it.  This will be added to my 'favourite' list of recipes!  Thanks for sharing :)

Very good. Used fresh mushrooms, fresh garlic and some garlic powder, a squirt of ketchup and two tablespoons of   Worchestsire  sauce.     Did not use the butter. Otherwise did everything else the recipe called for. Will be making this again.

I made this yesterday as a quick dinner, because I lost track of time and needed something quick and easy...true to what I had hoped, it was very quick and easy to make, and everyone liked it saying that it was filling. That being said there was nothing wrong with this recipe, it was just average.
I will probably make it again though if I happen to lose track of time again, or need something easy to make.

I did this recipe and it is really good.  Additionally, it took only about 45 minutes to make.  I found I only had a half cup of regular sour cream,  so subbed in another half cup of plain Greek yogurt.  Couldn't tell the difference.  Thanks for sharing.

Read other reviews and changed the garlic salt to garlic powder.  Used fresh mushrooms rather than canned.  This was honestly INCREDIBLE.  I said to my husband I felt guilty for liking it as much as the recipes that are more effort/expensive...a keeper for sure.

salty, so reduce that. Only had two cans of cream of chicken so it looks disgusting but is actually tasty.

Excellent!  Easy!  I followed the recipe, but reduced the sour cream just a bit as a few people suggested.  I omitted the flour because it was too thick and added a bit of milk to thin it some.  Very tasty.  This is a keeper.

I had to improvise because I didn’t have an onion. So instead I used Lipton dry soup (onion and mushroom)  and added  dry onion dip to the sour cream. Everyone liked it. (I didn’t add any spices since I figured the Lipton soup probably had enough).

Tasty, easy to make, and quick.  with two cans of soup, it was salty so next tie I’ll use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

Followed others advice and trained the hamburger and omitted the flour. I used minced garlic, two cans of cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, and fresh mushrooms.  Great basic recipe!

It was easy & delicious, *almost* as good as my mom’s recipe! I made this as directed, then after tasting (before the sour cream), it seemed a bit bland. I added 1.5 tsp salt, 1 Tablespoon black pepper (seems like a lot, but the sour cream mellows it), & 5 shakes of Worcestershire sauce. PERFECTION!

I was a little concerned initially with using cream of mushroom and cream of chicken together, but I’ve used them together in other recipes and the dish has turned out great. So I decided to give it a try and I’m glad I did!!  I really like this recipe!!

Couple of things I changed for my own tastebuds though 1) I don’t like mushrooms, so I omitted them  2) I didn’t use garlic salt just because I’m pregnant and don’t need the extra salt and garlic salt tends to be vary salty! I did however, use a little kosher salt, fresh ground pepper and garlic powder while browning the hamburger 3) I doubled this recipe and used the family size cans of both soups. Worked like a charm!  4) I omitted the flour because I missed that step and honestly if I had a little milk (ran out this morning and forgot to get more before coming home) I would have added just a smidge to thin it out some. 5) I only used about 3/4 - 1 cup of sour cream (in a double recipe) because I’m not a huge sour cream fan. But hands down, this is the best stroganoff I’ve ever made!!  I love it!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Family LOVED this and it was so easy! I pretty much followed the recipe however I used rehydrated dried morel mushrooms pre sauteed in garlic salt and butter and used wild game burger. The sauce was a little thick as others stated so I added some of the water that the morels rehydrated it to thin it down. YUM! And so easy!! Thanks!

Super easy recipe that's perfect for a weeknight. It's also inexpensive to make and fills up the whole family. The only thing I did different was ad a mixture of beef broth and soy to the ground beef but only because I was out of Worcestershire

Very creamy. I have to be honest but when I make something like this I don't measure. I just throw stuff in. The only change I made was I used real garlic instead of powdered, otherwise I used all ingredients listed. Very, very good.

I made it without the extra mushrooms and the addition of the sour cream at the end, and it was still so good! 
I did add some frozen peas and corn, just for a little extra something to consume, and eye-appeal for my picky eater :) it worked! 
The family enjoyed it, too. I didn’t salt the egg noodles enough when I was boiling them, but that was not the fault of the recipe, just a personal opinion. 
Great, easy and fast recipe!

This is by far one of the best hamburger stroganoffs that I've ever had. I followed the advice from other reviewers and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I also used very lean ground beef and drained the grease instead of adding flour. The sauce is definitely thick, but it's absolutely delicious!

I have been cooking this delicious recipe for years. My husband always loves it. Garlic and salt should be added to taste.

Have been making this for years.  We love it, and friends that my kids bring home love it too.  More than one Mom has called and asked for the recipe.  So easy, and I always have the ingredients on hand.

This recipe has become a family favorite.  I find this to be a quick week night dinner. I made the recipe as written. The only change I made was in the cooking order. I browned my drained, canned mushrooms in the butter first until they released moisture.  I removed them to a plate. I browned the meat in the mushroom flavored butter, and continued as per the recipe.  I have also made this using 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup. It is delicious too.

This is from the old red Betty Crocker cookbook I got as a wedding gift in 1972. It was one of the first recipes I ever made for my husband and has been a family favorite ever since.   It uses ingredients we usually have on hand, Is hearty and quick to make. When I’m being “good” I make myself something else, as I lovingly referred to this as “cholesterol  casserole”!

Really easy and delicious. Bit salty and realllly creamy (which is fine), so I’ll reduce the garlic salt a bit and cut down the sour cream a little next time.

I’ve made this a thousands times without cream of chicken and thought, why not?

‘Cause it’s chicken and hamburger, that’s why.  It was disappointingly “chickeny” instead of the creamy dish I love, and yes, very salty even when using garlic powder.  While I don’t mind cooking with condensed soups, this double whammy made it very...cafeteria-like.  I’ll stick to only using cream of mushroom in the future.

I made this and it turned out great! I found the meat to be bland before adding soups so I added black pepper generously, used garlic powder but tripled it, and used salt but tripled it. We love mushrooms so I tripled those as well. After adding the soups but before the sour cream I added 2 splashes of worchestershire sauce and more black pepper. With these changes it met our flavor expectations.

As written, it was far too thick as others have said. Easily remedied by adding milk to desired sauciness. I also add abt 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire. It's delicious as an easy..if not terribly healthy...weeknight dinner!! Thanks for the idea!!

I ‘m a horrible cook. Made this recipe almost exactly as written. Didn’t call to drain grease from ground beef but I think that’s common sense. Didn’t have much garlic salt but added garlic powder to onions while they cooked. That was the key I think. Added the garlic salt I had to ground beef but I think adding to the onion is what did it. Awesome flavor! Will definitely make again!

Followed the recipe almost to a T just added and teaspoon more of the garlic salt and used fresh mushrooms when cooking the onions. Couldn’t be better. My daughters 2 and 4 won’t stop eating it, that’s always a good sign. This is the tenth time we’ve made this and it is so easy.

I  probably would have rated this higher but it was extremely salty. I did use fresh mushrooms instead of canned and may try again with some changes such as using fresh garlic and draining the beef after browning.

I would have given this 3 1/2 stars if I could have based on the sodium content. I have been making almost the exact same dish for over 40 years! I always liked it. Nowadays I make a lower fat/sodium version due to health reasons. Garlic powder or fresh to taste instead of garlic salt, salt free canned mushrooms or fresh, 1 can of lower salt/fat mushroom soup and fat free Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. The end result is just as good and much healthier.

My first ever stroganoff. I didn’t have cream of mushroom soup so I by passed that, I also didn’t have an onion (blizzard here today, not running out). I used everything else on the list except I used ground Venison burger. Was easy to make and a hit!

Not too bad actually. I’m always skeptical about recipes with sour cream but this one was really good. My rating came from the fact that 3 out of the 5 people in our house liked this recipe, but it helps to know that it was the youngest two kids that weren’t too crazy about it. The only change was I added a beef bullion cube to make it a little more beefy. It was a little salty so next time I will use garlic powder instead of salt.

the only changes I made was I used homemade cream of mushroom soup instead of canned due to the salt content. Other than that followed it to the T!  delicious!!

My husband loved it. I made it as close to the original recipe as I could. I omitted the mushrooms and used 1/2 T of garlic powder and 1/2 T salt since I didn't have garlic salt. I also used about 3/4 the sour cream and next time I'll use 1/2 cup sour cream to make it make it less heavy. But I will make it again.

We really love this! I only doubled the meat and didn’t use an entire teaspoon of garlic salt. I also omitted actual mushrooms but the mushroom soup I can stand! Pretty easy and delicious. Definitely a nice change of pace for us but I will be making this regularly! ??

Instead of using canned mushrooms I sautéed fresh chopped mushrooms with the onions. Yum! Will definitely make again.

Great as is, but I find that a good dash of worcestershire adds zest and compliments the beefy flavor.

This was a nice base recipe, but to add some flavor I added sherry (1/2 cup), hot pepper flakes and peas. I didn't have any sour cream, so I! just skipped it. Very tasty! Oh...used fresh mushrooms.

My family thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  I did add some white wine to the fresh mushrooms and cooked it off. Then I added crushed garlic instead of garlic salt.  I must say it did Enhance the flavor.

Took the advice of others and forgot the garlic salt. Used a tbsp Worcestershire sauce for salt. Also used crushed garlic cloves (3) cooked with the onions.

I love the idea of a quick meal when you're running low on ingredients, but this was too salty for me. I'd like to try making it again with garlic powder rather than garlic salt as someone else suggested.

I used olive oil instead of butter and added a little milk at the end to keep it from being so thick. Next time I will use less onion, too. Very good and so easy! I will definitely be making this again.

I think there is too much salt.  I would change garlic salt to 1/2 tbs or less.  Maybe add garlic powder and 1/4 tsp salt.  Otherwise an easy disk to make with pantry staples other than sour cream and meat.

I enjoyed this recipe. Made a few alterations. I left out the butter as I used minced onions and drained the grease so I didn't use the flour either. I also used garlic powder instead of the garlic salt, and i didn't have any sour cream or I'd have used some. Still, I thought it was quite delicious.

I have made this many times however I don't like the flavor of it with cream of mushroom soup so I use 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery!  Much better! Garlic powder instead of garlic salt, season salt, onion powder and pepper, the I taste if it needs more salt I add it then, but rarely does.  Love my version!

I add a 1/2 a soup can of milk otherwise followed the recipe. My family weren't thrilled with the appearance, but after they tasted it they really liked it! It's a nice quick meal just add a veggie and fruit and all set.

This dish was SUPER salty. I would recommend not using garlic salt. The two Campbell's soups have msg already so for me this dish was not good.

I've made this recipe for 40 years (!!!). For what it is, it's full of good flavor and it's super easy. I add a bit more garlic and use Cream of Mushroom soup instead of Cream of Chicken. I like that extra flavor boost.

I only give it 4 stars bc I deleted some ingredients. It would be better with onions, but I made it for my sister's bday and she hates onions. I skipped only them and mushrooms. I don't like mushrooms, but I did use cream of mushroom soup. I am sure it would be even better with fresh ones added.  The garlic salt helped the flavor, so it didn't need to be seasoned. I would try a different soup than cream of chicken bc I didn't like the chicken taste with the beef. It was a hit and just the right amount of sauce. I was worried it would be soupy, but it was perfect. This recipe wasn't hard and definitely made a better meal than a pre-made mix.

This recipe was easy to make, and tasted very good.  I will definitely keep this one in my recipe box.  It will be wonderful in the colder months as it is very hearty.

I have made this from scratch, which took forever and was a minor let down after all the time.  This recipe is fantastic!  I added chopped garlic but besides it was great.  I have now made it for several people and they love it!

This was VERY good but I did make the following changes:  I didn't add the flour, I only used 1 teaspoon garlic salt, and I added about 1/4 cup water to the soup mixture. I also added worcestershire sauce to the soup mixture , probably 3 or 4 tbsp. because we LOVE that flavor. I also added some garlic to the hamburger mixture.  It was really good. I think the recipe is great but tweak it as you see fit and beware of ALL that garlic salt, because a tbsp is A LOT!!!

I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so instead of salt used garlic powder,  cream of celery instead of cream of chicken, used milk instead of sour cream and stirred a little beef bouillon in. The family loved it. No leftovers.

This was oh-so-easy to make.  From start to finish, it was done in about 35-40 minutes and on the table.  Plus, it tasted delicious.  I highly recommend this recipe and I think kids would really like it as well!

This one was a hit with my family. I used garlic powder instead of the garlic salt. Omitted the onions, but will try them next time. Also used only cream of mushroom soup not cream of chicken. Definitely a keeper!

Quick, easy and delicious!  My kids are picky eaters, and they cleaned their plates - something that rarely happens.  I did add a bit of extra garlic powder,  just because we love garlic.   We ran out of noodles and I was hungry for a bit more, so I just spooned it over a piece of bread.  Will definitely be on our regular dinner menu!

This is easy, quick and delicious.  Since the soup has such high sodium content, I used minced garlic(personal preference) instead of garlic salt.  I drained and rinsed my beef and onion mixture when it was cooked.  Otherwise, no changes.  Great dish!

This is a good base for an Easy Hamburger Stroganoff.  I did make a few changes : used crushed garlic with the onions and browning the ground beef. I found it a must to drain the fat. I used the soups and sour cream but I did not use the flour and I used beef broth to thin the sauce. For seasoning I used fresh ground pepper and sea salt and dried dill weed (fresh would also be good). The egg noodles are a must. 
Overall, it was delicious and the best part was how very easy and quick to make.

Quick & easy recipe. Used a couple of subs w/good results: yogurt vs sour cream, onion powder, added pasta water to loosen soup/yogurt/meat thickness. Family really liked it & will make again.

I make a version of this but use rice.  I get the beef rice and make like on the box then add cooked ground beef.  Can of cream of mushroom,  cup of sour cream then simmer.   It is a version of rice a roni stroganoff that they discontinued and went to only pasta roni.

I thought this was so incredibly easy. I two three and its done. Taste was great or so simple a dish. I used 3 cloves of fresh garlic because we all love garlic.  So we didn't think it was too salty. I omitted the butter and just cooked the onions & chopped garlic cloves with the ground beef to leave out the extra fat and leave out a step.

Very good base recipe! I made quite a few changes as I was concerned about it being too bland and I also have VERY picky little girls. I doubled the meat, added a Tbsp of minced fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, used only cream of mushroom soup, substituted heavy cream for sour cream because I was out, used reconstituted dried mushrooms instead of canned & seasoned with salt-free steak seasoning and porcini mushroom powder. I also browned the meat separately so I could make the sauce and run it through my VitaMix before combining with the noodles and meat because my girls won't touch anything with mushroom or onion "chunks". This went over great with my girls BOTH having seconds!

Delicious!  I'm not an onion fan so I used dried minced onion rather than fresh. This was such an easy, tasty dish.

My kids love it!  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I used turkey burger because our family doesn't like ground beef.  I added some ketchup for flavor (2 tbsp).  I also added some milk to thin the sauce.  Great, easy recipe.  I will make it again.

Really good recipe. Added a little Worcestershire sauce. Next time will add a little more liquid, but will make again.  A keeper for sure.

My family asks for it all the time. We also like to crumble French Friend Onions (like you use for green bean casserole) over it.

Dish was delicious so my wife said. There really wasn't much to this amazing meal. I did what somebody said and splashed the beef and onions with Worcestershire sauce. Other than that, stuck to the recipe and created a masterpiece. Great dinner!!
