The directions are sketchy at best.  I had good results only b/c I know how to make creme brulee.  I chose a different method entirely to make this.  I blended the egg yolks & sugar together and placed this in a double boiler, and added the vanilla and cream.  I continually stirred this mixture until it had thickened.  I then poured it into ramekins and refrigerated it.  After it cooled I used a finally ground turbinado sugar (raw sugar) and carmelised it w/ my butane torch.  Simple recipe but given the instructions wouldn't recommend this to a beginner.

After reading another review, I read a few more recipes to see how to make this. I mixed the egg yolks and sugar and vanilla together, heated the cream, added it a little at a time to the egg yolks.  Worked fine.   I didn't put it through a sieve, and cooked it in ramekins- but it only fit into 3 6oz ramekins.  Loved the taste.  It was quite thick.  I used a torch for the sugar- still getting the hang of that, but overall it was very good.

i love the taste but a bit sad when i tried to caramelised the top with oven broiler and the whole contents shinks.. i was left with a small amount of creme brulee to eat. I would recommend to add more egg yolks and whipping cream.

Great recipe! Easy to follow. This was my first time making creme brulee so I was intimidated, but following this recipe made it a breeze. I topped with caramelized banana quarters (nice addition) but this recipe would have stood on its own.

I was away from home and was making this for friends, and this recipe followed nearly as close to the one from Cooks Illustrated Best Recipes formula. I used: per 1/4 cup cream, 1 yolk, 1 T sugar and I strain the hot mixture before I put it in the ramekins. There are so many sizes of ramekins now~a serving can be quite relative!

It came out perfect and very good. I put a little too much sugar on top. Next time I will know to use just a little on top.

I made it. I doubled the recipe. It came out runny. Not cooked for long enough or should have cooked at a slight temperature. The taste was excellent but wished it had solidified.

I put the ramekins in a glass dish with hot water to reach the level of the creme brulee within it and that seemed to work in place of a double boiler.

Simmer heavy cream for at least 5 minutes... and bake for 45 depending on your oven... use the torch, works much better!!
