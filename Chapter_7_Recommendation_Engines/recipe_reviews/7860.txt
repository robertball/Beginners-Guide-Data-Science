Delicious! I did however make some changes. I wanted to make it a little bit more healthier so I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 applesauce. Also added more spices than recipe called for. I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour. Also cut down the sugar to less than 2 cups and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. Finally I topped it w/ cream cheese frosting. So good! moist, flavorful and delicious :)

Easy to prepare, moist, and tasty.  Not too spicy either.  You can cut the cooking time in half if you use a 13x9 rectangular baking dish.

I made no changes to this as I saw no need to. Looking at the recipe, the combination of ingredients, especially the spices, seemed just right-and they were. No applesauce, no reduction of oil for me-if you're gonna eat cake, eat cake! It isn't supposed to be healthy, just a nice treat! Neither did I add raisins or nuts, even though both would be good. Just wanted a pure and simple pumpkin cake. This one delights - tender, soft crumb, not too sweet, and a pleasant blend of spices, none of them overpowering. I baked them in mini pumpkin pans, then decorated them with tinted orange and green Butter Cream Frosting II from this site. The end result was autumn bliss-  smooth, silky little pumpkin cakes that are melt-in-your mouth good. Hubby and his staff gobbled up all 23! (out of 24... I had to taste-test one of them, right?)

The blend of spices really gives this cake nice flavor!  I normally prefer to make cakes with butter and/or margarine versus oil, so next time I will try that.  Oil does make the cake moist, but butter gives much more depth of flavor.  I baked the cake in a tube pan and frosted the top portion of the cake with an orange cream cheese frosting.  The frosting:  6 oz. cream cheese, 3 T butter, 1 1/2 T freshly squeezed orange juice, 1 T grated orange rind, 1 t. vanilla extract, and enough powdered sugar to make the desired frosting consistency (approx. 2 cups).  The cake and the frosting make a great combination!

This cake was very good!  I made it for a dessert contest at work around Halloween - I baked 12 little mini bundt cakes and used 2 cakes together to make mini-pumpkins.  I used frosting to keep the 2 cakes together and then placed them in a baking dish of crumbled oreos and chocolate pudding (you wouldn't think chococate and pumpkin cake would go together, but they do!)  I brushed  the pumpkins with glaze(using powdered sugar, milk and a little red and yellow food coloring), let them dry, and then glazed them again and used green frosting to create stems and vines.  viola!  pumpkin patch!

One word: DELICIOUS!!!

I was a bit confused as to why the recipe called for "Allspice" AS WELL AS cloves, ginger, and cinnamon which are all components of "Allspice." (I went into Allrecipes' substitutions chart and found that "Allspice" was comprised of ginger, cloves, and cinnamon.) But hey - it worked! Thank you D. Adams! This was a hit with my 7-year-old as well as with my whole office!!! It was very moist and no frosting was needed, just a light dusting of powdered sugar - yum!

This cake was wonderful. I used 1/2 c. applesauce and 1/2 c. oil as others had suggested. The cake was very moist and the pumpkin flavor was good (not too strong or overpowering). I took it to a family gathering and got rave reviews. I will make this again.

Absolutely awesome!  Made this for church coffee hour and 2 people asked for recipe.  It tastes terrific with real whipped cream.  I used a bundt pan, and because it was a dark teflon one I decreased the temperated about 10 degrees.  It came out perfect made exactly as the recipe states. Would probably freeze well, too.  If you need an excellent Fall desert that is simple, delicious and tasty, you have to try this!

This was a great cake it was moist and very easy to make. I made some alterations such as the oil instead of a cup I only did 1/2 and the rest was applesauce I also used fresh pumpkin instead of the canned varity, the fresh was awesome tasting I encourage you to try it. I added golden raisins instead of nuts I'll try both sometime. Thanks for this wonderful receipe D Adams
I will enjoy passing this along to friends and family as gift's this holiday season

Fantastic!   I get requests & compliments on this constantly!   I DID make a change & a substitution.   I use less sugar  -  1 3/4 cups.
I was out of pumpkin one day & used squash instead - a big hit!    If you have access to Pampered Chef's Cinnamon Plus - use 4 tsp of that instead of the separate spices.   This recipe is a family FAVORITE!

This was amazing!  I did use some applesauce to cut down  on fat,  but this doesn't cut down on flavor at all!  Also, I didn't have cloves so I used more cinnamon, nutmeg and  allspice.  In reference to another review, allspice is not a combination  of the other spices.  the other spices can stand in for allspice as a substitute  but Allspice is the dried, unripened fruit of a small evergreen tree, the Pimenta Dioica. The fruit is a pea-sized berry which is sundried to a reddish-brown color. Pimento is called Allspice because its flavor suggests a blend of cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg.

Wonderfullymoist flavorful cake.  I used 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c unsweetended applesauce.  In addition to the nuts, I added 1/2 c dried cranberries.  Everyone in the house gave it 5 stars.  Sending some to my daughter at college.

This is the first time I wanted to write a review . . . probably because it is the best recipe I have come across in years!  I followed this recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  I did bake it in a 9x13 for 40 minutes and then frosted with cream cheese frosting.  Wonderful - will make again and again!

This was really good!  I had no problem getting it out of the bundt pan.  The only change I made was to the pan.  I greased the bundt pan with butter then instead of flour, used granulated sugar.  The sugar gave the outside crust a crunch.

This cake was phenomenal, and perfect for using up leftover pumpkin puree!  I made the following changes:  Cut oil in half and subbed in additional 1/2 cup pumpkin puree (for a total of 2 1/2 cups...slightly more than called for); Cut down sugar to 1 cup white, 2/3 cup brown; Added 1/4 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp ground ginger; Omitted cloves, allspice, and walnuts. This recipe was easy and fun to make (I didn't even need to break out the hand mixer...just used two forks).  I agree with other reviews that it is somewhat like a pumpkin bread in texture...but a delicious, moist bread at that! I did not find this cake to be too dense or sweet. It is lighter than bread, with subtle, delicious flavor, and best served plain; I think any frosting would be too overpowering. I baked this in a flexible silicon bundt pan, lightly spritzed with nonstick cooking spray, for about 1 hr 15 min. I HIGHLY recommend the silicon pan because its flexibility prevents the cake from flaking off or sticking to the sides when removing. I believe that this recipe is impossible to mess up.

I LOVE this recipe!  It is the perfect balance of sweet/spicy and makes a great background for whatever you want to pair it with.  I also used applesauce, but used Splenda, rather than brown sugar.  The one addition I made was 1/4 tsp of cayenne.  It was not hot, but just warmed it up a little.  I baked this in a jelly roll pan and made a torte of it, using a sweetened cream cheese between the layers, alternating orange zest and chopped dried cranberries.   It is AMAZING.

Allspice is not actually comprised  of separate spices.  It is a plant entirely in itself and does add a difference to recipes.  But, it can be substitued with a collection of the spices cited.

Fabulous!I made this for a frien to take to a "pumpkin festival".I used 2 pyrex bowls levelled them abd inverted one on top of the other I sliced the tops and stuck them to the sides of the ball to make ridges. I frosted everything with Ricks butter cream. When I made a second one for my family I used the "Best Buttercream Frosting" which was a not too sweet perfect compliment for this cake. Both frosting recipes are from this site, and I made sure to read the reviews before makeing them, great tips there.

Amazing, and I followed the 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup applesauce. The cake was so full of flavor and moist.  The *First cake I made didn't rise and I noticed this about halfway through the baking - it was then that I realized I never added the baking soda! I let it finish cooking and although it came out half the size, the flavor was fabulous. I'm going to use it in my 'pumpkin muffin stuffin'. :)

This is the recipe you want for dense, moist, spice cake.  I used it to make two small bundt cakes, placed the flat ends together to make a pumpkin, and iced it with an orange buttercream frosting.  The cake took the stacking and heavy frosting without collapsing or shedding a bunch of crumbs.  The pumpkin was real cute, too!

I made this cake in 25 muffins and they were de-vine. They were perfect after 20 minutes and got a nice chewy crust on top. The inside is moist and had a great texture and crumb. These are so flavorful they really don't even need frosting, but I put some cream cheese frosting on them anyways and they were awesome. I will use this reicpe a lot this fall for sure.

This cake is yummy, though too sweet for me.  But the texture is wonderful and the spices are just right.  I made it with chocolate chips instead of walnuts and it was really really good!  Next time though i will cut down the sugar.

i had to rate this cake. i really messed it up and it still came out moist and delish! first of all, i only had about 2/3 cup of oil so i threw in a couple of tbs. of sour cream. next, no cloves so i added extra cinnamon.i put in in my bundt pan in the oven and 5 mins later realized i didn't add the baking soda! so i dumped it back out in a bowl, stirred in the baking soda and returned it to the oven. i just knew i had ruined it but no! it was great and it stayed moist for several days.this was a big hit at my house. i will make it right the next time and i am sure we will like it even more! thanks for a great and easy recipe.

I made as directed the first time and decided I wanted less oil,  although it was wonderful as written.     Second time,   made it with 1/2 applesauce to replace some oil,    and reduced sugar to one and 1/2 cups instead of  2 1/2.   Used part brown sugar instead of all white. For 3/4 cup of the all purpose flour,  I subbed some rolled oats and white whole wheat flour. Increased spices a bit and added chopped dark chocolate. Excellent!  Thanks for a great base recipe that is very flexible!

Great recipe; I made it about three times and each time it was delicious! I did not make any changes, except I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned (only because I had them) and I don't think that made too much of a difference. Also, the second time I made it I added raisins, and that was good too. I think the recipes is fairly healthy so I did not think it was necessary to eliminate sugar or oil. The whole wheat flour idea sounds good, but my family probably would not go for that. It had the perfect amount of spices; I find with pumpkin, carrot and zuchinni cake recipes it is often hard to find one with enough spices and many are bland; it is the spices that really make it. Often I find myself adding spices just to make it taste good and sometimes others cannot handle the amount I put. However, I did not need to add any spices and we all liked it! I added powdered sugar like the recipes said and that really added the sweetness.

I just got back from my Easter dinner and everyone just loved this! Including me!  The only thing I changed was that I didnt use the cloves or allspice, only b/c i didnt have any, so i just added 2tsp of cinn. and 1.5tsp of nutmeg.  It was so moist and was a good simple dessert with just some powdered sugar on top. Although my dad said it could use some cool whip.  I will most definitely be making this again and again!

WOW!  I just whipped this cake up in the midst of making dinner & lunches, supervising homework, doing laundry, and it couldn't have been easier!  I just dumped everything into a bowl at once and mixed it up (I did make two changes - I decreased the sugar to 1.5 cups and replaced half the oil with applesauce.)  IT'S SO GOOD!!  I did not use nuts, as I knew my kids wouldn't like them, but I can tell nuts would have made it even better!  I've gotta go have another piece!

Yummy, very delicious!  I didn't have a bundt pan so I used 2-9" round cake pans, and it turned out fine.  I ate it without any frosting and it was still yummy!  The longer you let it sit, the better it gets!  So don't eat it right when you take it out of the oven!  And I used pumpkin pie filling spice, and that worked out fine, and I didn't add the last 1/2 c. of sugar, which was good.  Well, enjoy!

I made this recipe as cupcakes and everyone loved them!  They bake faster than a full-size cake would, obviously, and yield about 24 cupcakes.

Pretty good.  A little too much nutmeg for me.  It is the predominate spice flavor in the cake.  I substituted unsweetened applesauce for half of the oil and splenda granular for half of the sugar.  I used the walnuts since I had some, but if I make this again I will definitely use my favorite nut -- the pecan.  I was worried when the recipe did not say to grease and flour the pan, but the cake came out beautifully with only greasing the bundt pan.  One coworker said it "was to die for!"  Another, who is on a wheat-free diet, said "it was worth cheating for."

I love anything pumpkin and had to try this. It was much better than I thought and tasted oooooh so good. So moist I couldn’t believe it. Instead of all the spices I bought pumpkin pie spice from my grocer because it has a few things all spice does not. 
I made this as cupcakes for my co-workers with cream cheese frosting and they all raved about it and had to have the recipe. Oh I work with all men so it has to be good for them to get into the kitchen.
Yummy is all I can say.
Thanks for sharing this.

This was soooo moist and delicious.  My kids didn't like it, i think because they knew pumpkin was in it, but it didn't matter because my husband and I ate 1/2 of the bundt cake by ourselves after dinner.  I will finish it off when I go home. Wonderful recipe.

This is so yummy! I made it in mini bunts and cupcakes and I only took 20 mins for the mini bundt. I was also out of cloves and nutmeg, so I doubled the other spices and it was still delish! It was a huge hit in our home.

Incredibly tasty, very moist and aromatic. I tested this cake to see if it was a viable option for Thanksgiving and now am certain that the extended family will be very impressed! I didn't  add icing or decoration this time around, but the cake stands well on its own.

I'm giving this 5 stars, mainly because of all of the great compliments that I received!  I reduced the cloves by a little bit & they were still way too strong in the mix.  I didn't have allspice, I don't know if that would've made a difference........and I was sort of annoyed that the cake didn't taste a whole lot like Pumpkin to me.    In saying that, I got rave reviews about it, even an applause at the Bday party I brought it to!  It kind of reminded me of Carrot cake in a way, especially the texture.

I have made this cake 4 times now, and every time, someone asks for the recipe.  I used equal parts of whole wheat and regular flour (it was still super moist!), and omitted the walnuts.  So easy, and super yummy!

This is a wonderful recipe! I read through a lot of the reviews with all the changes people have made, but decided to give it a try with just the ingredients listed, and it turned out delicious! I was a little concerned mine would be a little "gooey" since I used fresh pureed pumpkin rather than canned, but it is just very moist, and not doughy at all. I baked it in a 9x13 cake pan for about 45 minutes, versus the bunt pan. Great cake! Will definitely make this again! Thanks!

Made this cake for a co-worker's birthday who likes anything pumpkin.  It turned out beautifully and had a lovely pumpkin spice flavor.  I made the cream cheese frosting from this site & made it orange and drizzled the frosting on the top.  Also frosted an ice cream cone in green frosting and placed it upside down in the center of the bundt cake.  It was a beautiful pumpkin flavored pumpkin cake & my co-worked loved it!!

I made this cake for my friend's birthday when his request was "something pumpkin" as he has a fall birthday.  This cake is AMAZING.  I made it as written, the only change was instead of 4 tsp of each spice, I used 4 tsp. of pumpkin spice (which includes all four spices)and it worked beautifully.  I made the cake in two 9" pans so that cut the baking time down to 30 min.  I made a honey spice buttercream frosting and that was literally the "icing on the cake!"  I bake often and this is by far my favorite recipe. I've already been asked to make this for Thanksgiving and had several requests for the recipe.  Definitely a hit!

Great tasting, moist cake. The spices really come through. I would recommend cream cheese frosting as a fantastic compliment.   The best part though is the presentation. Make 2 bundt cakes, flip one over on top of the other and frost to look like a full 3D pumpkin. It will feed a crowd and they will love it. I made one for an office Halloween party and it is now legendary - The Great Pumpkin cake! I am making it again this year.

This cake was so easy to make and it turned out fabulous! Very moist with a smooth pumpkin pie/spice cake flavor. The cake is not lite & fluffy...it's a little heavy but very good. I drizzled cream cheese glaze over the warm cake and it enhanced the flavors even more. Tasted a lot like a pumpkin roll without all the fuss. Definitely a keeper! I think I will add fresh cranberries to the batter & sprinkle the baked top of cake with chopped pecans when I make this for Christmas just to make it a little more special. [basic cream cheese glaze- 4-oz. cream cheese-softened, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon butter-softened, 1 tsp vanilla extract, mix till there are no lumps and add enough milk to make it a glaze constancy about 2 Tblsp.]

Very moist and dense. I used apple sauce for the oil and 3/4 c. egg substitute. One cup each of granulated and brown sugar is sweet enough.

Really easy recipe. I made this for my mom's coworkers, so I didn't actually have a piece but it smelled heavenly and I heard very nice reviews. Also, I was very glad that the recipe used an entire can; a lot of the recipes on Libby's website didn't and I didn't want left over pumpkin.

Mmmmmmmmm. This recipe was made for Fall. The spices in it are the perfect combo and the cake is so light and fluffy. I used this recipe to make little  cakes in my William Sonama Pumpkin Patch pan.

this cake is excellent!  i added 3/4 cup golden raisins (soaked in 1 c boiling water and drained) with the nuts.  also, i glazed the cake with 1 cup powdered sugar mixed with 4 teaspoons orange juice.  perfect!  remember, if you have a dark nonstick pan, watch your baking time - it will be slightly less!

I made this following a few suggestions from other reviews: 1/2 c. oil & 1/2 c. applesauce; split the sugar to 1/2 brown and 1/2 white, and added 1 tsp. baking powder.  It's very good and moist, better the next day than fresh out of the oven.  First time I made it was with orange cream cheese frosting and the second time just a powdered sugar glaze.  It's a matter of preference if you like the orange flavor. I think I will cut back slightly on the cloves; I think they overpower the pumpkin flavor.

It had a good flavor, but after only a couple hours it started to taste really dry.  It wasn't good enough that I'd want to make it again.

I was looking for a pumpkin cake recipe calling for a whole 15 oz can of pumpkin, so as to not adjust a recipe or waste any pumpkin. This was very good. I cut down on the sugar a bit (but should have left it the same) and I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for part of the oil (good substitution). Also, I didn't have allspice so omitted it without adding more of the other spices....I should have though because it didn't have quite enough spice for me. I made cupcakes and they were a hit.

This is a fantastic cake. I also use this recipe to make mini pumpkin muffins.  Also great with cream cheese frosting.  I have also made this recipe using applesauce to replace half the oil and found that it tastes just as delicious as the original recipe.  Pecans also work well if you don't have walnuts on hand.

I took the advice of others and used 1/2 cup unsweetened appleasuce and 1/2 cup oil to cut back on the fat. And I also used 1 cup Splenda and 1 1/2 cups white sugar.  Other than those 2 changes- I followed the recipe exactly.  It turned out nicely--not too sweet- but great with confectioners sugar on top.  I love pumpkin and I will use this recipe again.

This was great. Very moist, very dense. Even my mom liked it, and she hates pumpkin and walnuts. It was not nearly as sweet as I thought it would be, considering the amount of sugar. I added the vanilla frosting glaze variation from the "Pumpkin Cake with Orange Glaze" recipe, and it relly went well with the cake. The only modifications I made were: used 1/2 cup applesauce in place of half the oil, used 4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice in place of the spices, and added 1/2 cup raisins. Definitely a keeper!

This was a good "cake" but it called for too much flour and too much oil.  It was very heavy and it turned out more like a bread than a cake.

Took this to my in-laws for dessert for a family dinner.  It was a big hit.  Excellent served warm with fresh whipped cream.  Just made this again and used mini choc chips instead of nuts and frosted with cream cheese frosting.  Everyone including the kids LOVED it like this.

Followed the recipe exact. Greased the pan extremely well. Cooked cake exactly 1 hr until toothpick came out clean. Waited exactly 5 minutes and turned out on plate per instructions. And ended up with a big mess as the cake stuck in the pan terribly. Tastes OK, but is a shredded mess. Gonna have to figure out how to serve as trifle instead... ugh!

This cake recipe is perfect as submitted, and requires no changes at all!  To the lady who wondered why Allspice was included.  Allspice is not a mixture of spices as she mistakenly believes but is, instead, a spice of its own -- often used in Jamaican cooking.  I always add a generous dash of it to pumpkin pie, in spite of all of the other spices.  Its addition provides an extra bit of verve.

Fantastic fall cake.  I replaced the oil completely with applesauce and used a little (maybe 1/4 cup) less sugar than called for.  Probably would have been good with just 2 cups of sugar.  I also replaced the flour with sorghum flour (gluten free) which worked just fine.  The blend of spices was delicious, especially as I am a big fan of fall spices.  I whipped up a little cream cheese glaze to drizzle over it which turned out okay.  It didn't add much of a cream cheese taste, just sugary, but it looked nice.  Roommates liked this cake a lot.

Very good recipe.  I did not add any nuts, but did add a 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to bring out the pumpkin flavor.  I also made whipped cream cheese frosting to frost the cake (8 oz. cream cheese, 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/8 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream - directions:  whip cream first, then in a separate bowl combine all other ingredients, beat until smooth, and then fold in the whipped cream).

Oh.  My.  God.  So dense.  So moist.  So deliciously pumpkiny.  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly except that I only used cinnamon as I didn't have the other spices on hand.  I made three 9x1 inch layers.  So so so so so good.  This is a permanent staple.  You MUST try it.

Doubled recipe and used 2 cups wheat flour, 1/3 cup each oat bran, wheat bran, and wheat germ.  Last 2 cups of flour was the regular white stuff.  I also used canola oil.  Turned out Great!  I added 1 cup rasins and wish I had omitted the nuts as I'm not a big fan of them in cake.  Baked in two 9x13 pans for 35min.  Topped with cream cheese frosting.  Very moist and yummy!

Cake very moist-my husband said that it tasted like pumpkin bread. I left out the oil and substituted 1 C of melted butter and it turned out just fine. I also left out any glaze-seemed good enough on its own!

Not my favorite cake recipe.  It doesn't work well with typical subsitutions to lighten it up (applesauce for half the fat, splenda for half the sugar).   It is probably as written, but I won't try it again.

Oh this was soooo good! Very easy to make, I didn't sift and it was still delicious! I baked it in 2 8" square pans for about 50 mins. This recipe was great even without the frosting (I used a cream cheese frosting).

I made this for my nephews 1st birthday.  He is a Halloween baby.  Used 2 cups fresh pumpkin and everybody raved about this cake.

I made in a bundt pan and used the real pumpkin stem in the middle.

Great recipe.

I will keep this recipie around for years!  I now have another reason to look forward to fall.  I topped half with chocolate creme chess icing (find recipe on this site) and left half plain, and the entire side with icing was gone before anyone even touched the plan side.  Will ice every time now.  Thanks!

These were fantastic! The only changes I made was to substitute half brown sugar and half whole wheat flour. And a little extra cinnamon. Very heavy and flavorful. We made mini pumpkin-shaped cakes and decorated them like jack-o-lanterns!

This is a great cake, moist, not too sweet, spicy and healthy. I used have whole wheat flour and 1 cup of Splenda instead of all white sugar. I also added a couple of tablespoons of molasses, fresh ground ginger, and 3 tablespoons of ground flax seeds, I used almonds instead of walnuts.  My cake turned out great. I will make this again.

I made this for my husband's birthday party, and it was a hit, even with little kids, and I was worried about the amount of spice being too much for people, especially kids. I used half natural, unsweetened apple sauce and half oil, and it was plenty moist--no problem with dryness. I was really scared of the amount of spices, but it is a really good, full, robust taste and I'm glad I didn't cut back. I made this in a 9x13 pan, and it was a pretty deep cake; I also found I didn't have to bake the cake for nearly as long as the directions state (probably due to using a 9x13 instead of a tube pan). I topped it with the allspice cream cheese frosting from this site, and it was also really good. The cake is very filling and dense, so you will probably want to cut smaller pieces.

I love this cake.  It is so good!  I also added 1 tsp of ground ginger.  Adds a little more flavor to it!   We now make it the night before Thanksgiving (while everyone is anxiously waiting for the Thanksgiving dinner) this cake will please them. Give it a try! This is good with cream cheese frosting. Also great with mini chocolate chips!

I've made this twice and everyone loved it both times.  I used half the oil, as someone else recommended, and it was still plenty moist.  The other change I made was, I used 4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the four separate spices. I frosted it (with cream cheese frosting the first time) and the second time I added about a cup of mini chocolate chips and just dusted it with confectioner's sugar. The cake is so yummy, it doesn't need frosting.  I will be making this again.

This cake was very moist and tasty! My husband loved it, and he's not very big on pumpkin. I didn't have applesauce to use instead of the oil, but I will try that suggestion next time.

Yummy, made it last night, brought it into work today.  All my co-workers loved it.  I followed recipes to the tee, w/ the exception of I left out the cloves. (which I didn't have on hand) I don't think it made any difference. Very moist and festive!

I just made this beauty yesterday and it's delicious! Very easy to make and extremely moist finish. I was concerned the cloves would be too much, but it's not overly spicy.

I followed the recipe exactly.  The cake is so soft and moist.  I did make a different glaze though.  I used apple juice and less powered sugar so it would seap into the cake, then sprinkled it with pecans (next time I will toast the nuts.  This glaze was so yummy, even the bottom of the cake soaked up sum of it!

Ok...this is the best pumpkin cake I have ever had! Very moist and easy to make. I have made it 4 times in the last 3 weeks (took it to my and my husbands work 3 of those times) Rave reviews from all our coworkers! I've made it as loaves and individual muffins, also plain with no walnuts, or stired in  1/2 cup of raisins. Topped with a Cream Cheese frosting is also great. Coworkers seem to REALLY love it with walnuts AND raisins. Absolutely delicious any version!

Everyone loved this--even those who are not fans of pumpkin pie.  I baked it in a tube instead of bundt pan so that I could frost the top with a thick layer of cream cheese frosting. It was to die for!  It took almost an extra 10 min baking than the recipe time, fyi.  Great recipe!

This is one of my favorite cakes to make in the fall, although it's great anytime.  I've gotten many recipe requests for  this cake.   Delicious.
I like lightly toasting the nuts (at 350 F for 8 minutes or so) before adding them to the cake.

Yummy! Made 12 cupcakes and one 9 inch round. 22 min at 350 was perfect for the cupcakes. Frosted with cream cheese frosting and put a candy corn on each one. Super easy and cute treat for our Harvest Cake walk at church.

My 8yr old gave it "2 billion thumbs up". I did make a couple small changes. I used 2.5 cups Butternut squash that had been BBQ'd. I also cut back the nutmeg to 2/3 tsp since I was using freshly grated. No nuts either. This is a wonderfully moist and flavourful cake.

GREAT! This time of year I am on the hunt for good pumpkin recipes.  This one intreeged me because it called for 1/2 a can which is more than most call for, and had a lot of spices which also was great.  I added a few white chocolate chips as well as dried cheeries.  They were a hit.  One trick, don't overbake them!

Very moist. Delicious. (And I don't like pumpkin!) I only made a few substitutions: used a cup of applesauce instead of the oil, the equivalency of egg substitute for the eggs, and 2 tsp allspice instead of 1 allspice and 1 cloves (I didn't have any cloves). I would love to try it with chopped nuts next time. Thanks for the great recipe.

Wow!  Great cake, or bread if you want to bake it in loaf pans.  I don't like to change recipes that are submitted too often, but I did change a couple of things.  I don't like cloves or nutmeg, so I add two teaspoons cinnamon and 1 teaspoon allspice for the spices.  Did I mention I like cinnamon?  I only had canola oil and I think it comes out moister with it.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!I've made it twice in one week.

Wow!!  I made this cake for my husband's birthday (he LOVES anything pumpkin) and it was outstanding!!!  He was completely impressed and it made for a delicious ending to a special birthday celebration!  I made it in a 9X13 and then iced it with Cream Cheese Frosting...it's rich, sweet and SINFULLY GOOD!  Let yourself splurge on this one - you won't be sad that you did!

This was really yummy! The only change I made was to use half oil, half applesauce, and it was still very moist! I also reduced the temp to 325 halfway through because I was using a heavy dark bundt pan. I'll definitely make this again!

I made this recipe using 2 - 9" Round Cake Pans and frosted with (Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting) from this web site. What a great recipe, our grand children loved it, even the picky 4 year old. Our thanks goes out to D. Adams. Iota

I liked this cake, but I thought that the spices were off. Too much clove - it was overpowering. Next time I would eliminate the allspice, cut the clove in half, put in more cinnamon and a bit of ginger.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out wonderfully moist. However, the spices were a bit overpowering for me. This cake is perfect for those who prefer a nice, strong flavor.

I am ratign this pumkin cake with 5 stars because my husband and co workers love it. I do not like pumpkin cake so of course, it wasn't good for me. :)
It is very easy to make and pretty reasonable price wise to bake.

This is a really good cake--very moist, and it actually gets better later in the week. I used a cup of brown sugar and a cup of white sugar. Also, I didn't use the allspice (I was out), but I will next time. It was heavy on pumpkin taste and low on spice without it. I'm going to try swapping the oil for apple sauce and see how that works.

Really good cakeness.  Reducing the white sugar to 1 cup and adding 2/3 cup brown sugar was a great suggestion. Whole wheat party flour worked great and I left out the walnuts.  I forgot the salt, so I just added some to the glaze, which turned out really well. So moist and delicious,

This was a good hefty cake. I added more spice and it wasn't ruined. I also added some miniature chocolate chips. Turned out good. Will definitely make again as you could play with alot of combinations on this one, thanks for the recipe!

mushy consistency.  needs more flavor-- more spices?  after freezing and thawing, and adding a mollasses glaze, gets rave reviews.  people think itt astes like pumpkin pie.  my changes:
* replaced oil with apple sauce
* replaced 1 c. of flour with whole wheat flour

LOVED this bundt cake!! It was easy to remove from my pan using the PAM  with flour spray.  (I made mine substituting applesauce for oil).  I usually insist on an icing with cake but this was so good I didn't stop after the first trial bite before making the glaze.  Instead of the glaze though, I used a cream cheese frosting I had and loved it as did the family, I highly recommend trying this recipe!

This recipe is so excellent,I made this cake a few times already and even one for a good friend and she loved it, its so moist! With her cake i didn't add the nuts as she doesn't likethem and she still raved about it,I add the nuts to mine and sometimes I just dust the cake with powdered sugar. My sons also love it when I add mini chocolate chips to it too,no matter what this is just super excellent and I will be making it many times over!!!!!

This cake is FANTASTIC!!!  I love pumpkin, and this cake was a dream come true.  It was a real hit with my family, and co-workers.  It's the first time I've ever made homemade cake, and I was surprised at how moist and flavorful it was.  Thank you for this recipe, it will become tradition in my house form now on!

This recipe is delicious!  I made it for my friends and husband, and they raved about it.  We ate it warm, with a little powdered sugar on top, and a large dollop of whipped cream.  As my friend put it, "It tastes exactly like a pumpkin pie, but it's a cake!"  The recipe said to sprinkle powdered sugar on top, but I was wondering if I should mix up some glaze instead, and I'm glad I didn't.  The cake was sweet enough, and I think a glaze would have been overkill.  This cake was awesome, and it now has a permanent spot in my recipe box.  I will be making this recipe again, because it's perfect for the holidays!

I love this recipe!It's one of those recipe I'll make for ever and ever.The only problem I ran into is when the whole top of the cake stuck to the pan!!!My sous-chefs came up with the idea to put a delicious glaze over the the cake so you couldn't tell what had happened. It was a hit!!!!!!!

This is a great cake and the family loved it.  Made it exactly as the recipe detailed and it was perfect.  This is a dense cake so small slices go a long way. Topped it with cream cheese frosting and decorated as Frankenstein for Halloween.  This is a perfect cake for structures as it is a sturdy dough. Will make it again.

Everyone loved this cake when I made it for Halloween.  Very dense & moist.  You can drizzle with a powdered sugar glaze or melted chocolate, or sift some powdered  sugar on top of the cooled cake.  I added about 1/4 c. of pure maple syrup, used half apple sauce & half oil (instead of all oil), 1 c. of brown sugar and  1  1/2 c. of white sugar and added about 2 handfuls of mini chocolate ships to the batter after it was mixed.  Baked it about 45-50 min. in a bundt pan.  Yummy!

Loved this cake  . It is very moist and flavorful . I did not change a thing because then I would not be reviewing this recipe . I like that it calls for the entire can of pumpkin because some recipes use only 1 cup and you are stuck with the rest of the can . Expect to get lots of compliments if you bake this cake . It is a winner .

I made it exactly as the recipe was written. I did have to substitute some spices due to not having them at the time. I used 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. It was NOT oily as someone else said. I did bake it in a 13X9 pan for about 40 minutes (and did the normal doneness test). I made cream cheese frosting  and everyone loved it.  I had none to take home.

My daughter made this as a bundt cake for Thanksgiving and she did a great job! This cake was moist and very flavorful. She did omit the cloves and nuts. She also added a Simple Orange Glaze from this site which really gave this pumpkin cake another element. Very good! Thanks!

I have made this recipe three times already for my family and plan to make it again for Thanksgiving. We love it! I did 1/2 c. of cinnamon applesauce and 1/2 c. of oil instead of 1 c. of oil. I also used 1/2 tsp. nutmeg instead of 1 tsp. because I had some really strong nutmeg from my food coop. I also left out the nuts because of my daughter's nut allergy. If you like spice cake and pumpkin pie, this bundt cake is the perfect choice for you! We like it served with a little whipped cream on top ;)

This is the most moist, flavorful, pumpkin cake I have ever tasted.
I made this cake for a co-worker who loves pumpkin anything for her birthday in March.....it was a huge hit...so moist and flavorful.  In June I took it to a family reunion and it was the first dessert to go.  The only think I did differently was make a "light" cream cheese frosting with 8 oz reduced fat cream cheese, 1 large pkg of instant vanilla pudding mix, 1 cup milk, 1 tsp vanilla and 7 oz reduced fat whipped topping (Cool Whip).  Both times I served the icing on the side and people just put a dollop on top of their slice if they wanted it.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Why mess with a great recipe?

I followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the salt and nuts.  As others have said, this is a very moist and delicious cake.  The cake also tastes better the day after it has baked.  A cream cheese type icing would go great drizzled over this cake!  We ate the cake with a side of French Vanilla ice cream, which tasted great with it!  Will make again!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Tasted excellent.  When I baked this, even though the toothpick came out clear, after cooling and cutting the cake, it was a little too moist.  I am going to try less oil next time.

Instead of making this myself, I sent the recipe to a friend and hinted that she should bake it for me. Omitting the nuts and nutmeg, (knowing I'm not a fan of them) she baked the yummiest pumpkin cake I have ever had, and quite possibly one of the yummiest cakes in general. I could eat it everyday!

I made this the other day.  I thought it might come out more like a muffin than a cake, and it did.  It's a dense cake, but moist.  I omitted the cloves because I don't like them.  I also used chocolate chips instead of walnuts like the other user did.  It's good, and everyone liked it, but I think it needs something else.  Can't put my finger on it...maybe brown sugar?  rum?  Well, I'll probably just use this recipe for muffins...

WOW!  I took this cake to a Halloween party last night and people I didn't even know were actually asking the hostess who had made it, and then seeking me out to tell me how delicious it was.  The best part was that it was SO EASY TO MAKE!!!!  p.s. I left out the walnuts due to a niece's food allergy.

This cake was easy to make and went over well on Christmas Day.  The texture is more of a denser, pumpkin bread than a cake but it has very nice flavor.  It is reminiscent of a spice cake.  I used a homemade cream cheese frosting with this cake.  Will make again!

Very good!!!!   I couldn't find ground clove  so I used 4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead.  Next time i'll cut back a little on the sugar and use a little less oil.. cake was a little too sweet.   and a little to moist.

One of my favorite cakes.. instead of making in a bundt pan I used 2 (9 in) round pans, omitted the walnuts in the batter and instead spread a walnut filling between the two layers then finished off with a cream cheese icing.

I have made this cake dozens of times, just as the recipe is written, and with or without chopped nuts. It's a favorite and I'm asked to make it ALL the TIME! I usually make a not too sweet cream cheese frosting with it, and it's fab!

I made this last Christmas, but put it in loaf pans.  It was a hit.  I made 6 loaves, (2 loaves per receipe) and gave only 3 away as gifts because the others 3 never made it out the door! This year I need to find a way to leave out the eggs because my Mom is allergic to them, and I want to share some with her.  If anyone has suggestions....!  :D

I made this, following the recipe exactly, except that I used a cooking spray with flour as I did not want the grease from the pan to be absorbed by the batter.  The cake is quite good.

However, I regret following the instructions to remove it from the pan after 5 minutes.  I did it against my better judgement, and sure enough, one side of the cake broke, from the outside to almost the inner hole.  If baking in a tube pan instead of a bundt pan, It needs to cool in the pan longer, because unlike in a bundt pan, and unlike angel food or pound cakes baked in a tube pan, the top of the cake in the pan will also be the top of the cake on the cake platter, so the cake needs flipped after removed from the tube pan.  Next time I will let it cool on a rack in the pan for 15 minutes.  I also don't recommend turning it onto a plate immediately after removing from the pan, as the cake can not cool properly.

I found this cake a little on the sweet side. When I make it again, I will use equal parts brown sugar and white sugar or even reduce the amount of sugar.  But overall, a nice cake!

This cake came out so moist and flavorful, my whole family started eating it before i could even take a nice picture! the only exception i made was only adding 2 cups of sugar because i didnt want the cake to be too sweet. I also did not add the full amount of oil. If i had added 1 cup of oil it would have had a bad consistency. I would definitely reccommend this recipe to anyone looking for a nice pumpkin spice cake! the powdered sugar at the end added just the right amount of sweetness 10/10

Really strong Allspice and Clove taste....it was too much for me.  The cake itself was moist and the texture good.  I will make this again, but cut back on the two above spices or perhaps use Pumpkin Pie Spice in place of them.

I showed my daughter how to make this as she is still just learning how to bake and it looked very easy.  She needed a dairy free cake for her boyfriend and this one turned out amazing! It was moist and flavorful and smelled fantastic every time we opened the lid covering it.  To do dairy free icing drizzle we used spiced apple cider, powdered sugar and a little pure vanilla extract and it was delicious!

This came out moist and delicious. The only change I made was to cut the sugar to 2 cups, which was perfect. I think too much sugar tends to cover the taste of the pumpkin.

This is a quick, easy and versatile recipe. I added chopped Fuji apples and fresh cranberries, baked in a bundt pan. Drizzled cream cheese icing over the top and sprinkled chopped walnuts. It was a big hit!! Replacing walnuts with pumpkin seeds would be yummy too.

The texture of this cake is nice, but something about the spice ratio isn't suiting me. I think next time I'll just use pumpkin pie spice, or just use cinnamon ginger cloves and nutmeg. It might be the allspice that's throwing me off.

Stick with the serving size, cut sugar to 1.75 cup, so added more flour to balance it out. Light, moist, and spiced. I probably would make it a little more spiced next time.

I really liked how this turned out! I baked it in a mini bundt cake mold and had enough batter to make 12 of them. I used a creaming method for the mixing of the batter rather than the way the recipe called to mix it and it turned out wonderfully! I will be using this recipe again in the future!

This is pretty good with a few modifications! I really don't think it's necessary to use 1 full cup of oil (or butter in my case)--so I only used 1/2 cup of melted butter,  1 cup of brown sugar, and added an extra egg. That's all I changed about it though, and this makes a great cake! I love the amount of spices in it! And it definitely gets better the next day. Mine cooked in 50 minutes at 350. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good pumpkin cake. I made a few changes as suggested by others--a little less sugar, substituted unsweetened applesauce for all of the oil and added currants, approx 3/4 cup with the cup of chopped nuts.. Raisins would work, also. Baked an hour in a tube pan. Frosted with a light butter and powdered sugar glaze. This will be made again.

This is  a simple recipe that makes a great cake.  I added pumpkin chips and baked it in two small bundt cake pans.  Frosted with orange cream cheese frosting it looked like a pumpkin.  It was a great hit at our dinner party.  I will make it again.

I have made this recipe a number of times but have changed it in the following ways.  You can use your own pumpkin puree, 2 cups instead of canned pumpkin; 1/2 cup canola oil rather than 1 cup veg oil; 1.5 cups sugar instead of 2.5 cups, add 1/2 tsp  ground ginger; increase to 1 tsp salt; and add 1 tsp baking powder.  I also use 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or chopped pecans.  I make it in either two 9" round pans or a 13x9 pan.  Cooking time is about 40-45 minutes.  Prepare the pans by lightly greasing and flouring.  I use a standard butter cream frosting and also spread chopped walnuts over the frosting.  Everyone loves this cake.  My husband normally hates anything pumpkin but likes this cake.
I have made the recipe gluten free as well, using 2.5 cups rice flour instead of regular flour; you may substitute 3/4 cup honey instead of the sugar.   The recipe also works with substituting 3/4c brown sugar packed+ 3/4C white sugar.    The first set of changes is the way I generally make the recipe and prefer it that way.

I adjusted the sugar to one cup (1/2 cup each of white and brown sugar) and 1/2 cup each of applesauce and oil  as suggested by other viewers. I am sure it would have been wonderful without the changes but  it is a little healthier with the changes. This has a wonderful spicy flavor which I will make many times.

delicious.  only change was to sub out all the oil with applesauce.  everyone complimented on how moist it was and surprised that it didn't have any oil in it.  I did bump up the spices a bit just out of personal preference.  I like being able to use the entire can of pumpkin so was glad to find a recipe that used the whole can.  made this in a bundt pan and 55 minutes was perfect in my oven.  It is a thicker batter so if one were to add nuts or chocolate chips, this would be a good recipe, as they won't sink to the bottom.  glazed with a buttercream glaze thinned down with Pumpkin spice creamer.  complimented it nicely.

This is excellent. I did use 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce as others had recommended. I recently made an apple cake recipe and it was so moist that I was mentally convinced the applesauce was the reason, hence my substitution. I swapped one cup of sugar for brown sugar and rounded the measurements of cinnamon and nutmeg too. Lastly, I topped the slices of cake with the vanilla sauce from the best bread pudding recipe on this site, which is great in so many situations.

Great recipe. Made a few small changes.  Instead of using plain vegetable oil, I mixed in 2 TBS butter and brought the volume up to 1 cup with the veggie oil. The butter added creaminess and body.  I used only 2 cups sugar. I omitted the cloves, because I  find that taste a little overpowering. I pressure cooked raw peeled pumpkin for 4 minutes, drained it in a colander overnight and weighed out 15 oz. instead of using canned.  All in all, perfect.

Good recipe!  The only thing I changed was to cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups as 2 1/2 seemed way to sweet.  It came out perfect.

I thought it tasted very good.  I think a glaze or a bit of icing wouldI improve it.  Very easy to make too.

I made this cake to take to work to share the day before  Thanksgiving.  I did not add the walnuts.  It was a big hit.  I had enough left for my family Thanksgiving day.  My husband really liked it and he doesn't even like pumpkin!!!  This recipe is a definite keeper!!!!

Made it exactly as written except I used 1/2c oil +  1/2c applesauce, to help cut down on calories. Also, I was out of Cloves so I skipped that spice.  It was easy to make and came out perfectly. It was not done at 1hr, it took 1hr 15min.  It was a hit with everyone (kids, husband, friends). Will make again :)

I made exactly as described, doubling the recipe so I could make two cakes.  The only issue I had was that  both cakes, despite putting Pam in the bundt pans I used, and running a knife down the sides, stuck to the top, one worse than the other did.  Wondering if I should flour next time and/or let cool at least 10 minutes in the pan?  Did anyone else have this issue?  Regardless, I drizzled the cake with a wonderful cream cheese icing  thinned with milk, making it a bit thick on the top to "hide" the torn off parts, and the cake was a hit at an event I took it to, and at home with my pumpkin-flavor-loving husband.  Recipe is a keeper.

It's spring cleaning time, and today the pantry was on my list. I found a can of pumpkin a week from expiring. Even though spring in Florida means temps in the 80's, when I saw that can of pumpkin, I just started craving something that tasted of autumn and reminded me of cooler temps. I made this recipe pretty much as-is, I just substituted pumpkin pie spice for all the spices listed, as that is what I always have on hand. This cake is so moist and flavorful! The pumpkin flavor really comes through. I glazed it with a maple syrup/powdered sugar mixture, maple and pumpkin are just so good together! I only have one small criticism, the cake itself, without the glaze, is a little on the too sweet side. It won't stop us from eating it though, it's really that good and nearly close to perfect! Next time though, I will cut back on the sugar a bit(1/2 cup maybe?) especially if I frost/glaze it. Thanks so much for the recipe and a taste of autumn! :)

5 stars with my slight modifications. 3-4 stars as is. First, too much oil. I reduced to 2/3c and added an extra 1/4c of pumpkin. Also, I reduced the sugar slightly to 2 1/4c. Lastly, I did not have cloves so we went on without. This cake was fabulous! Moist, dense, perfect pumpkin/spice flavor. I topped with a cinnamon cheesecake frosting from another recipe on this site. Everyone loved it!

I also made mine out of two bundt cakes and stacked them to look like a pumpkin. Due to the hole in the middle of the bundt cake I threw some pumpkin spice m&ms in the middle hole to be the same height of the cake. Then I took some of the cake I had cut off to make it even for stacking, put it on top of the candy, and had a stem. I used cream cheese frosting dyed orange for the pumpkin and green for the stem. It was awesome and so easy! 

The cake also tasted really good. I typically am not a huge pumpkin fan (except in my coffee drinks) but thought this was great. It was extremely moist. If I make it again I'll leave it as just a bundt cake with a glaze as you really don't need the frosting. I also didn't have all the spices on hand so I substituted an undetermined amount of pumpkin pie spice instead and added a pinch of extra cinnamon. I'm confident though the cake would have turned out better had I been able to follow the recommended amounts.

Refreshing to find a good recipe that doesn't need alterations to be 5 stars on All recipes!!

I am thrilled with this cake!!  It has so much spicy flavour and is super moist!  I don't usually have luck with cakes made from scratch but this cake is the exception.  It even tastes great a couple days later!!  My family and co-workers loved it!!

Very good cake.  The smell was great as it was baking.  The only trouble I had was to take the cake out because I had only greased it and didn't flour the pan so the bottom was stuck and cake broke.  We still ate it and enjoyed every bite.

Great cake, easy to make. I have actually made it 13 times....that how easy it is to put together. I omitted the nuts (food allergies). I gave them as fall presents and everyone loved them. I didn't have all spice and replace it with pumpking pie spice, turn out great. I put less than a tsp of cloves because it was such a strong taste that after 13 times I adjusted it a little bit. But all around a great and so easy cake. Thanks

I liked this cake very much....it is extremely moist, which I like, but others in my family thought it was a little 'too moist', almost doughy. I cooked it 10 min. more, but I think that's just the way the texture is supposed to be. Other than that little issue it's a wonderful cake perfect for fall.

This recipe was really good.  As others did, I used half apple sauce and half oil.  But if I were to make it again I would cut down on the spices, there were too much and it took away from the pumpkin flavour, would also consider adding some crushed pineapple.  I used freshly cooked cinderella pumpkin.  Wish I knew how to make the texture not quite so dense? - anyone with ideas?  I made a double batch and took one to work, with a cream cheese icing, it was a big hit!  VERY EASY and quick to make.  I will keep this and make it again.

Great pumpkin taste.  Reminds me of pumpkin bread.  The family liked it with no topping on it at all.  It was very moist.

This cake bakes beautifully! I's moist with good festive flavour, too. It's a nice size and slices and presents perfectly. A good cake for guests or family, it's superb.

WOW!!!! I don't care for pumpkin at all but this cake is scruptious!!! I am making it for a combination Thanksgiving and birthday for my father (who loves pumpkin pie). I am making a large loaf (16 by 4) and needed to double the recipe. It took nearly two hours to bake FYI should anyone want to do the same. I will use cream cheese icing to decorate with. I can't wait to present this one!!! Thank you for the recipe!!!!!!!!
