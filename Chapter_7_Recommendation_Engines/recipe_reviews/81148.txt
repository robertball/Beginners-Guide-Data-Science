We really liked this. Simple fast and yummy! Made as is. At first thought the ingredient proportions were off but it worked just fine. "1 serving" was enough for an appetizer for both my husband and I.

Five stars for quick easy and oh so tasty! This was really simple and healthy. Hubby first asked if there was dressing for it and I said no. He proceeded to eat the whole thing! I used garlic and herb feta cheese. The red pepper gives it some juice and the feta adds lots of flavor. Thanks for sharing!

Brilliantly simple and extremely tasty too. My daughter is not a huge fan of salad dressing so this was a definite hit with her. She did add a fair bit of freshly ground black pepper at the table. Thanks for sharing this Mandy.

I wasn't sure if I would like a salad without salad dressing but this was excellent. I also wasn't sure how well I would like a lot of raw red bell pepper so I only used a quarter of the bell pepper and I doubled the feta. An amazingly delicious combination with 4 simple ingredients. Thanks!

I had high hopes for this recipe since it had four ingredients that we like and was simple to make. But we found it to be unexciting. Not something I would try again. Maybe the addition of a flavored feta helped the one reviewer.

Tastes good! I didn't have feta so added shredded sharp white cheddar instead. Tastes delicious!

Bland because there's no salad dressing
