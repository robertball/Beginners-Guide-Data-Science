Nice recipe to dress up round steak.

re: dry vs. fresh - for most herbs you should always cut the measure at least in half if you use dry (there are exceptions). Rosemary is strong anyway (and can be a bit chewey) - so if you haven't cooked with it before it's probably best to reduce it a bit further than that the first time.

I didn't want to pan fry the steak, so I used the sauce as a marinade, and grilled them on the grill.  This was one of the best steaks I have had in years.  I used flat-iron steaks and marinated them in the sauce for 5 hours before grilling.  Better than the steaks I have had in steak houses!! The entire family loved them.

I made this a couple months ago and just haven't gotten around to rating it.  I thought the flavors were really unique and amazing.  The flavor is really strong though so it's one of those recipes you'll either love or hate.  Didn't have bacon and was still good without it.

I'd rate the recipe, as written using round steak, a four...the sauce was definitely 5 star though. It was soo good that you didn't even care if your meat was rather tough but next time, I'll save the round steak for a crockpot recipe & top a N.Y. Strip w/ this delicious sauce. The only changes I made to the recipe were cutting back just a tad on the mustard in the sauce (I didn't have sweet/spicy mustard so I added a bit of honey to spicy brown mustard) & I used real bacon bits instead of frying bacon. I did cook my steaks in just a little bacon grease though. Will have the sauce again on a better cut of meat...thanks!

Made a couple of alterations to this one and it is really good.
I didn't care to have the crumbled bacon on top of the steak, because it made the steak seem crunchy. But at the same time I did like cooking the steak in the bacon greese. Oh the dilema here. My solution... add the bacon to a baked potato.
Also, I added a few sliced mushrooms saute in the sauce and it turned out really well.
Go easy on the Rosemary, three tablespoons is too much. One or two works, or just eyeball it.

I substituted tequilla for the whiskey and left out the brown sugar. It was great.

This was my first time ever cooking steak and I made it perfectly. The only thing I thought it needed was a bit more of a sauce but less mustard taste. I was expecting it to be different than it was but it still turned out wonderfully! Great recipe!!!

Rosemary too overpowering. Otherwise, the sauce was pretty good. I used dried Rosemary instead of fresh. Maybe that was the problem?

The sauce was a great combination of flavors.  It was good on the round steak we used, but I think a better cut of steak would really make this a wow dish.  I could've just eaten the sauce with a spoon. ;-)

The sauce was really bitter, not really sure why, but had to add a lot of brown sugar.  The mustard/garlic mix came off in the pan  Made it work, but won't make again.

This is a great recipe, but cleanup was a nightmare. I used 1 tsp. dried rosemary and ended up adding a little more lemon juice, Worcestershire, and brown sugar as the sauce seemed to evaporate almost immediately.  Other than that, the sauce was a hit and the steak, an otherwise mediocre cut of meat, was a hit.  I will definitely use it again, but I won't put my Calphalon pan through the ringer!

My husband was crazy for this sauce!  I left out the bacon and sauted the steaks in olive oil like someone else did. Also, I had to use dried rosemary.  I left all the other stuff the same.  I used Beaver brand mustard. 
This sauce is really good.

Best dinner I ever had! Instead of ordinary whiskey I made it with the Jack Daniel's Fire and oh my god it was amazing! No steakhouse dish has ever gotten close to this heavenly meal. If I ever get married this will definitely be on the menu.   Oh and btw I paired it with some rosemary potatoes and green asparagus wrapped in beacon. It was perfect!

I don't know what I did wrong, but my sauce separated and turned into a clumpy disgusting mess and it smelled absolutely horrible.  We ate the steaks with just the mustard and threw away the sauce.

The sauce was aweful.  Usually I like most things but we threw this away.  Horrible.  Sorry for the bad review.  The whiskey was so overpowering you could not taste any other flavor.

This is a sauce you either love or hate. Unique in flavor. We at first taste found it bitter. I added more sugar and lemon juice. Next time I will also  use less worcestershire sauce.The rest, I followed the recipe. My husband made me freeze the leftover sauce.We loved it.

I made this for my fiancée and I. The only things I did different was I used ribeye (it was on sale) and I sifted the sauce. It turned out amazing with a really robust taste. I’ve never tried using mustard on a steak before but I would absolutely recommend this recipe.

The whisky and rosemary overpowered the rest of the flavors quite a bit. Would recommend to all those attempting this to reduce whisky and rosemary to half. i couldn't eat all the steak because it was overpowering but my girlfriend liked it so I'll give it a four.

Very yummy! Used half stone ground mustard and half Dijon. Added just a touch of honey as recommended by others. Made round steak taste delish.

We are on a low fat diet at my house so we don't eat a lot of red meat and I did not follow the recipe exactly but it was good.  The bacon was the only thing I left out and just pan-fried the steak in a little olive oil.  I can't wait to try the sauce on a different cut of steak next time.  Thanks for the recipe.
