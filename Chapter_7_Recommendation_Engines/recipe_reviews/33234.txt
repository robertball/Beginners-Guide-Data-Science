I actually heated the olive oil on low heat and then added some crushed garlic to it. I usually do about 1/3 cup of oil to 1 tsp of garlic. However, it can be altered, depending upon how strong of a garlic flavor you want. After I heat the oil for 5-7 min, I turn off the heat and remove the garlic pieces. Then, I brush the oil onto the bread. After that, I follow the recipe.

Really good.  I, too, added a splash of balsamic, which the tomatoes seemed to be begging for.  I put the tomatoes on first, topped it with a slice of fresh mozzarella, then popped it all back in the oven to just melt the cheese.  This ensured that the tomatoes didn't fall off--they were held in place by the melted cheese.  Oh--and I used sliced grape tomatoes because that's what I had on hand.

Really liked this very much; we got the expensive imported "ball" mozzarella cheese that's almost white in color from the italian store.  It made all the difference.  And used garlic salt in lieu of the garlic clove being rubbed.  This got RAVE reviews from everyone in the house and is a great evening snack!

Literally I make this every night with dinner. I add sweet onion, salt and extra virgin olive oil and it has to be fresh basil. The garlic rub is the way to go and to make it a little more heated thru, top with the fresh mozzarella and place in oven and melt the cheese all over the tomato mixture. Drizzle olive oil and sprinkle with kosher salt. Yummy!!!! Definitely trying it cold with my family reunion in July!

LOVE It! Love it! Love it!  My family had this as a light dinner with fruit and summer sausage.  We are definetly going to keep this one!  Thanks for a quick and easy recipe that is bursting with flavor.  We did add onions to the tomatos and used dried basil, as we didn't have any fresh on hand.  Also good with Cavendars Greek Seasoning on the toast before any other toppings go on.

Not a whole lot of discussion or analysis required on this one. It's classic, authentic and delicious. This is like a staple in our house (once crostini is topped with something it becomes bruschetta, and this recipe is your basic bruschetta). We have this often, generally as an appetizer before dinner.  No need to measure - top it to your liking.   Fresh, good quality ingredients will make or break this treat. Also, the bread can be grilled rather than broiled, on either an indoor or outdoor grill.

I don't really like bread broiled. So I mixed it all up, heaped it on the bread & cooked at 375 for 6-8 min. Perfect, thanks!

The flavor was very good.  The bread was too hard to bite into to.  I will try it again but with extremely fresh, softer bread.

I keep going back to this and similar recipes for bruschetta and am pretty set on what works best for me. I use Iowa-grown Graddy's or garden-fresh roma tomatoes, fresh basil (chopped or torn), fresh pressed garlic cloves, equal parts balsamic vinegar and quality extra virgin olive oil, and a sprinkle of onion powder, mixed and served cold over warm bread out of the oven. I've tried adding the tomato mixture and baking it altogether in the oven, but the bread can get soggy. So I prefer to spoon the topping on afterward, adding cheese directly to the bread before toasting or finishing by topping with chilled fresh mozzarella. :) About to try it tonight on texas toast.

Uninspired by this recipe.    Calls for too much cheese which overpowers other flavors.  Needs enhancements as other posters recommend, ie. balsamic vinegar.

These weren't bad, but I probably won't make this version again. I think caprese is better without toast (more of a delicacy), otherwise a typical bruschetta is more appealing if a baguette is being used.

What a hit this was.  My mother-in-law (!) drizzled a few more drops of olive oil but that only made it more flavorful.

Very good bruchetta.  I thought it was a little heavy on the garlic, but I may have just had very fresh garlic.  Adding balsalmic vinegar is a great addition!

Good basic recipe. I used minced garlic and put on top of the olive oil brushed pieces of bread. Next time, I will just incorporate with the tomato mixture. Also, I added a splash of balsamic vinegar, which was nice. I think the bread slices shouldn't be so thick.

This was delicious! I loved it. It is super easy to make and tastes very authentic like in real Italian restaurants. This would be great to eat as a lunch too.

I made this recipe last night for a progressive dinner I was involved in, and everyone thought it was really great.  I  made a couple minor modifications and that was to add 2 large cloves of garlic to the tomatoes, 1 large sliced green onion, a spash of balsamic vinegar and a few Tbsp of olive oil.  I only rated the recipe 4 stars because we found that the cheese did not add anything to dish.  Between the robust flavours of the tomato/basil/garlic, the cheese was completely lost. I will make this dish again, but will leave out the cheese.

This was delicious but I had a hard time keeping the tomato mixture from falling off, even though I laid the cheese on top.  That said, the flavor was wonderful.  When I try it again, I'll make sure to use a more substantially sized baguette.  I also added a splash of balsamic vinegar and added the garlic straight to the tomatoes, as I'm a garlic fanatic.  :)

Fresh mozzarella and basil are absolutely essential to this dish, so don't skimp and use the powdered or dried stuff.

so simple but so tasty. i like to make a balsamic reduction to drizzle over the top, which does take this dish over the top. 4 cups balsamic and a 1\4 cup molasses cook down until thick and coat back o spoon.

Very easy to make. I use bottled minced garlic, which I mixed in with the tomatoes (fresh from the garden). There is a similar recipe in Bon Appetit from August 2012 that uses fresh oregano and feta in place of the basil and mozzarella. That is also quite good.

Good start, but much more flavorable if topped with a good store bought brushetta. Loved the idea of the baguette and the cheese. Thanks so much Eleanor!

I followed the original recipe for half of my slices and for the other half I  put the cheese on top of the diced tomatoes and melted it slightly in the oven and then added the basil.  I would do the “oven” method the next time.
