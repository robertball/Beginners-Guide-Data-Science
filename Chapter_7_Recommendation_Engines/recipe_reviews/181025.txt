this works. I did a LOT of research first. here's my notes: a. did not use calvados as cheapest bottle i could find was $40. thought about subbing apple juice, but decided to not use anything at all. b. used mixture of apples. granny smiths not recommended (surprisingly) as they did not hold up well to being fried. fujis better, oddly enough. very tasty. c. meat thermometer a must. took 4 hours to cook at 400 deg. used a single layer of foil to wrap bird, not fully, just like a taco shell lengthwise. edges exposed a little, tried to cover it up with a second smaller patch sheet. came out fine. important: uncover for last 20-30 minutes of cooking to brown skin. important: leave bird in oven for 20 min after hitting 180deg at thigh center with door open so juices recirculate and gets really tasty.  d. meat came out TENDER and very nice. all gone in 20 minutes and used 11.6lb bird (suggested is 8-12, no more because bird will be too old and tough. e. HIGHLY suggested to use a pan with rack. i didnt have one so i had to gingerly move the bird out with bamboo spoons to a wok, then pour the 400deg oil out into glass jars, then move bird back in... if i had a rack i could have just lifted the bird out. don't burn yourself! f. enjoy the goose. it was an amazing hit. $60 frozen at store, UNEVISERCATED is best.

Fairly easy and tasty recipe.  This was my first try at goose, my hubbie has wanted it for a couple of years for Christmas but it has always been so expensive; I found a frozen goose in January after the holidays on sale that was MUCH cheaper so I thought I would give it a try.  I pretty much followed this recipe exactly and it turned out nicely.  My nine pound bird took almost three hours to cook to 185 degrees. The apples were worth the time it took to fry them, as they were a good accompaniment to the bird itself and had most of the spice flavor. Since the skin is spiced the flavor is mostly in the skin and juices, but the bird itself had a good flavor that really didn't need too much else. It is akin to a cross between duck and a red meat, very dark.  It is also a very fatty bird that generates a lot of oil. I made a gravy out of some drippings, the organs and chicken broth and it paired nicely. Served with some au gratin potatoes for a very tasty meal.  This was a nice way to serve goose in the winter, the sweet spices made it aromatic and interesting.  Would recommend this recipe.

Good recipe!  I followed it fairly closely and only changed a couple of things.  Instead of stuffing with just apples, I combined apples with pears and persimmons.  I also sauteed a half a small onion with the fruit.  I did not have the apple brandy, so I used Grand Marnier (orange liqueur).  My goose was 9 lbs. and it took about 3 hours to cook completely.

This was a huge hit.  The only change was substituting blackberry brandy for the Calvados.  Also, for the "salt and pepper to taste" we used a teaspoon of "Krakow Nights" seasoning from Penzey's.  The bird smelled wonderful while cooking and came out very moist with only hints of the spice in the meat, but such a delicious smell.  Looking forward to trying again next year!

I had the same-sized bird as duenor (review #1) and took full advantage of her research, following her modifications pretty much to the letter and it really does work!  Even people who were protesting that they don't like goose, liked this goose.  A keeper, for certain!

I made this dish for thanks giving and it was extremely moist and delicious. My whole family even the ones who had previously tried goose and not liked enjoyed this way of preparing it. I will definitely be utilizing this recipe again and again.
