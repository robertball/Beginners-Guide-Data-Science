While this recipe did save time and space on Thanksgiving, I think I will stick with my usual dressing recipe made on the stove top with very little broth and no egg.  This recipe was flavorful but I prefer a much crispier, crunchier dressing.  After releasing the pressure, I poured the mixture into a 9x13 and baked at 400F for about 15 minutes and it was still soggier than I care for.  If you like your dressing soft, then you will love this!  Only ingredient change I made was using bulk breakfast sausage instead of Italian which I think works best for dressing.
