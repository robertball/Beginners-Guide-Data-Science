I make this icing quite a bit but I whip the whipped topping first as per the instructions. Beat together the pudding mix and one cup of milk until almost set. Then fold in the whipped topping. It makes for a fluffier icing with less 'pudding' taste.

This icing was OK - very easy to make - but tasted too much like pudding for me.

I have tried this recipe at least twice. It is very good! Can be made with Chocolate pudding for a good but not TOO chocolaty frosting.

This did not work for us at all. Way too runny.

This was real good and will make again. We dont like sweet frosting so this was a huge hit. The only negative is that is does taste alot like pudding so will mix in more whipped topping next time.

It was so so but not great. Also made it so that the leftovers had to be refrigerated.

This is my favorite frosting from childhood. I use chocolate pudding and use it to frost an angel food cake. Yummy and not too sweet.

Excellent pudding frosting. Quick and easy. The more you whip it the thicker it becomes!
