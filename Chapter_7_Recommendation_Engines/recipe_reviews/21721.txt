Yummy!  I marinated my chicken in a little of the sauce for a couple of hours, then grilled it on the BBQ with a drip pan underneath to avoid flares and it was SOOOO good.  It looked as good as it tasted!

The sauce was very good.  I will probably make this again with chicken breasts instead of chicken peices.

This was really good although I added a splash of Tabasco for a little kick.  Thanks BC! I'll probably do this one again.
