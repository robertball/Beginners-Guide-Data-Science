These are a nice butter cookie. I mixed the oats in because I was too lazy to roll the cookies in them :) My husband looked at the title of the recipe before I made them and when he walked in when the first batch was done he said "those don't look like bread" (he loves fresh bread out of the oven). LOL! He still asked for seconds.

These are delicious! But because I can never seem to leave a recipe alone, I made a few changes. I used butter-flavored shortening (since I have an abundance of it), omitted the oats, and replaced the self-rising flour with all-purpose flour + 1/2 tsp baking powder + 1/8 tsp salt. I also rolled out the dough so I could try out my new biscuit cutters.   For those curious about using this recipe for cutout cookies, be warned that the dough is quite crumbly, so go slowly when you roll. You also might want to use shortening in this case because butter might cause spreading. Oh, and reduce baking time to 7-8 minutes or so, since cutout cookies are thinner than drop cookies.  Regardless of how you decide to shape the dough, these cookies are definitely flaky and light with a hint of sweetness. Before baking, brush the tops with a bit of egg yolk for a lovely, shiny, golden crust. I will for sure be making these again :o) Thank you Jayna!

I had planned to have these with our main meal, but as I made them I kept thinking "These seem more like cookies than biscuits."  Then it dawned on me that in the UK, biscuits ARE cookies!  That's what I get for being Southern.  Other than that little mix-up they were great.  They really do melt in your mouth and they left my dad begging for more.  Absolutely delicious!

Delicious! My British ex-pat husband requested that I mix oats into the dough. I add about 3-4 handfuls at the very end. I also add an extra tablespoon cornstarch to make them crispier. And because of the extra cornstarch and oats, I end up having to add a tablespoon of milk.

Simply amazing. The rolled oats gives extra crunch & texture to the deliciously crisp cookie. Don't omit it, okay? (:

Comes out perfect every time. I add some vanilla sugar to the oatmeal to make it slightly sweeter. Try not to substitute margarine for butter if you can help it, it really doesn't do the recipe justice.

I too made my own self-rising flour by adding 1/2 tsp baking power and 1/8 tsp salt to the flour.  Turned out great.  My husband loves these because they are not too sweet.  Rolling them in oats is a MUST.  I sometimes make these as biscuits (cookies) or in a biscotti shape.  If you are making them as biscotti, roll the dough into a round, flatten the bottom on your cutting board as you slice them, then refrigderate for a few minutes before you roll them in oats and bake.

Really good straight out of the oven. These cookies really do melt. The first time I made them I made a horrible mistake! I didn't have any self-raising flour and I heard that if you put in 1 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp of baking powder. It was only supposed to be 1/2 tsp each, so they tasted horrible and had a really bitter after taste. But I made them again and fixed my mistake and they were delicious!

A delicious not-too-sweet cookie/biscuit! Since they arenâ€™t too sweet, it is possible to enjoy more than just one or two of these! I had to change a few things in the recipe: I didn't have cornstarch, so I omitted from the recipe. Also, I used all-purpose flour, because I didn't have self-rising flour. In the end, the cookies were still delicious! The taste closely resembles a Russian Tea Cake. I advise serving these with an afternoon tea.

Really good! Hubbie told me "these are not a biscuit, this is a cookie." Great with a morning cup of coffee. My oats didn't stick but they are still good and easy!

These are delicious.  But I figured out that "biscuit" means cookie across the pond... These reminded me of Lorne Doone cookies... thanx for the recipe.  I will definitely make again...

Delicious! Not too sweet; nice and light - perfect with a cup of tea. For what it's worth, I don't think of these as being traditionally English. The only biscuits I can think of that resemble these in any way are Hob Nobs. I associate oaty biscuits with Scotland more than England. But anyway, these are recommended. Thanks!

What a wonderful recipe this is!  They looked beautiful and tasted delicious.  I made 24 cookies and did have to add more oatmeal, which was no problem at all.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are very good, but mine did not spread at all (followed recipe exactly) so they don't look much like the picture.  They came out like little buttons.  I also had a hard time getting the oats to stick to the dough.
