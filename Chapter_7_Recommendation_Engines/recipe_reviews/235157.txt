I have to admit I did do two big changes to the recipe. First I went to buy the lamb but found it was pretty expensive this week. So instead I bought some pork butt instead selecting the darker cuts of meat. The second was when I went to add the squash after it baked in the oven. he stew looked a little dry so I added abut 1/2 cup of red wine to it along with the squash. It turned out very good. Nice flavor and tender meat and veggies. I want to try it with the lamb next time since I think that will be an even better flavor.

A great meal for a chilly autumn evening. I followed the recipe until it was all done I added some curry and yogurt on my helping. Easy preparation too. Enjoy.

I wish more people would just make the recipe first and tell us how it worked and THEN substitute to your hearts delights. I made the recipe as written and it was delicious and easy to make and was devoured in one sitting by the family.
