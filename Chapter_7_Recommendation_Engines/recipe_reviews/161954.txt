Wonderful! I used regular tuna (the type in a packet instead of a can) and replaced olives with grape tomatoes. Wonderful! Light but satisfing.

This is the perfect, easy lunch or side dish. I didn't have parsley or mint when I made this and it still tasted incredible.  ----- Tried it a second time using canned salmon which was just incredible. Better than the tuna, I think.

This salad tasted really good as a light, quick meal even though I didn't add cilantro or parsley.  I served it with soup. Thank you!
