This is THE BEST.  I made it in the crock pot and the corned beef was so tender and everything was so tasty.  I won't wait until next St. Patty's Day to make this again.  Fantastic!!!!!!

I made this in the slow cooker and cooked on high for six hours. The meat was so tender you could eat with a fork. I forgot to add the parsley and the butter at the end and it was still perfect. Next time I'll add a little more onion.

It was soooo beautiful here in Chicago yesterday (I'm wonderin' what happened today) that I started the meat in the crockpot at 11 a.m. went outside & forgot about it until I came in and took a whiff of the awesome aroma that it produced.  I used beef broth (low sodium) instead of the water and added the veges & potatoes at about 3p.m. (I served at 6)  I used Vienna corned beef because the last time I skimpped, it was very tough, not this time...it was so tender & tasty.  Thanks Cindy..Happy St. Patty's Day!!

I've used this recipe for the last two years and have had excellent results with it both times!  FORK TENDER and JUICY!!  I did cook mine in a 300 degree oven for about 6 hours while at work.  Than put on stove top and added the vegetable to cook.  One thing that I do is rinse my corned beef after removing from the package mainly to remove the blood.  I use Boyle's Corned Beef.  After eating for supper and fixing leftovers for lunches for the next day never have anything left.  Everyone has seconds when this is served!!  Thanks Cindy!

Cindy, this was exactly what I was looking for to celebrate St. Patrick's Day at our house.  I had to do in a slow cooker while I was at work, but with a few changes, it still came out very good.  I put EVERYTHING your recipe called for (including some red potatoes)in a slow cooker and cooked for about 7 hours on high.  The meat was a little tough still so, I boiled on stove (about an hour) with meat and juices only, to finish. Great flavor and the potatoes and carrots (I used baby)were actually perfect (not too overcooked)The cabbage however was overcooked;which was okay because I only added half the called for amount(for the flavor).  I added the other half of fresh cabbage to the meat as I boiled the extra hour and it worked out fine. Thank you so much for the recipe!

I have never made corned beef and cabbage before but I will have to say that I am hooked.  This was great!  I cooked mine in the crockpot on low for 8 hours.  The beef was tender and the veggies were great!  My VERY picky 12 year old even liked it.  This is a keeper!

I've never made Corned Beef before.  I had no problems; it was easy and delicious.  I did remove the beef from the pot and placed it in the oven to keep warm while I cooked the vegetables.  (I needed room for them.)  I cooked carrots and potatoes approximately 15 min., then added cabbage and cooked for about 15 min. more.  This was about right, and I added the veggies in amounts to suit me.

Very easy to make and it was very delicious.  I let it cook on top of my stove and it smelled up the whole neighborhood.  Good thing I like cooking and company.

Terrific recipe. My husband and 3 yr old daughter loved it! I've only made corned beef once before and it was tough and dry. This was moist and tasty (although I would personally add more peppercorns and garlic next time). Thanks for sharing your recipe!

It has now been 7 years of using Cindy's recipe for my Annual St. Patty's Day Dinner for a local Organization. This year I had over 50 attendees. The members look forward to this dinner every year. After reading some of the comments from other reviewers, and how they "modified" the recipe, I decided to let you all know what my secret is; I follow the recipe to the letter. If after scaling the recipe for 509 people, it calls for 32 1/2 peppercorns, I use 32 1/2 peppercorns. I also do not use cheap briskets of corned beef. There is so little fat in the pot that when its time to add the potatoes and carrots, the butter is needed to provide the fat. I do not mess around with Mother Nature, and I don't mess around with Cindy's recipe.

I love the method but I did make some changes for more flavor.  First I used two bottles of beer, a can of Beef Consomme, two cans of water, 6-8 garlic cloves minced, added the seasoning packet, 3 bay leaves, cracked fresh pepper, and fresh thyme.  Simmered as stated and at the end took the Corned Beef out and added red potatoes, baby carrots, one sliced onion, cabbage and fresh parsley.  Once vegetables were done I sliced the Corned beef and added back in at the end.  Added two TBSP butter and served.  It was delicious.  Oh, and I used premium beer, a Lagunitas IPA and a Deschutes Brewery IPA.  And I think the Beef Consomme added a more beefy taste without adding so much sodium that beef broth contains.  It was awesome!  My best one ever.

Great recipe. I used 2 cans of Swanson vegetable broth in place of same amt. of water. Served it St. Pat's day, 2008 to friends and they loved it. I also put the corned beef in the bottom of the slow-cooker and add veggies the last 2 hrs. I put in the cabbage the last 45 min of cooking and cook a total of 9 hrs.
Try serving with horseradish sauce . . . MMMM!

A-mazing!  We absolutely loved this recipe.  The corned beef was so good.  I cooked it in the crock pot on high for a little over six hours.  I put the veggies and potatoes in about three hours before it was done.  That was a little too long, so I will put the carrots and potatoes in a little bit later next time.  And the cabbage doesn't take that long, so I will probably try a half an hour next time.  I also drizzled a mustard sauce over the corned beef, and it made it really tasty.  This recipe was awesome!

Don't use garlic powder but use real garlic.  Garlic powder has a chemical taste to it. as does any of the powdered spices.

I have made corn beef and cabbage every St. Patties Day for many years, and this year wanted to try a different recipe.  I will never go back to my old one.  This was simple, and the taste was amazing.  I started it on the stove, and after 3 hours, transferred the meat with just a ladle of juice into a crockpot, then started to boil the carrots in the remainder of the juice for 15 minuted, then added the potatoes, and lastly the cabbage.  Then added all to the crockpot, just to keep warm till ready to eat.  You gotta try this!

Tried this but it didn't have enough good flavor.  Thanks to Milana87 I found the best recipe for corn beef in the world.  I am telling eveyone about the 'Slow Cooked Corn Beef for Sandwiches' since it is the best receipe I've ever found.

I've made this at least six times so far and every single time, the dish turns out great! I have a large family & we like seconds, so I double the recipe but that's the only thing I do differently to this recipe. It is already a favorite in our house and I recommend it to anyone else who likes corned beef & cabbage.

This was great, but not sure it is substantially better than just using the seasoning packet that comes with the corned beef, as much as I hate to say that. I made 2 at the same time - one exactly as written and one adding a bottle of regular (e.g., lager) beer. The one with beer was better. My mom made one using the seasoning packet and people didn't seem to have a strong preference between all of them. (we had a large party so three corned beefs in one day!)

This was the absolute best recipe for this dish....hands down.  Loved it and it came out perfectly.  Adjusted the time according to the weight of my brisket and cooked at total of 7 hours altogether. Delish!! Thank you!

This was by far the best corned beef & cabbage i've ever made. It was very tender and wasn't dried out. The only thing I did differently was to add the spice packet that came with the beef and added a lot more potatoes and carrots to feed all 4 of us. the guys love their potatoes. There are even enough for leftovers. Yummy recipe definately a keeper in my book.

I made this recipe in a crock pot combined with the "Corned Beef and Cabbage" how-to video from this site.  (Which means that I added 1 bottle of red Irish beer instead of water and included the spice packet that came with the meat.) The spices were perfect.  I have made this 2 times since St. Patrick's Day this year! :) Goes great with the "Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread" from this site. *Remember to cut the meat against the grain.*

This is how I make my Corned Beef & Cabbage, but I put about 1/2 cup of Cider Vinegar in it also which gives it a little zing & helps make the meat more tender.

Halved recipe and cooked in slow cooker (adding veggies only after half the time was up) -- and this was delicious!  Great blend of simple flavors! Definitely omit the salt, corned beef is salted already!

What a meal!! I added 24oz of Guinness draught, and added beef broth to cover the meat. Used crushed garlic instead of powdered, more onion.  Also cubed and sauteed 2 rutabaggas and added at the same time as the potatoes. It took about 1/2 hour for the potatoes and cabbage to get done. Served Carol46's horseradish sauce from AR. Also made Penguin ladie's Irish soda bread also from AR. Thanks to all the contributers for a great St. Pat Day

I followed this recipe entirely, with the exception of using garlic cloves in lieu of the garlic powder. I was impressed with the great results, and will certainly make this again. The only thing better than making this meal is eating it as leftovers the following day. Be sure to make extra! A thousand thanks, Cindy!

This was very good and exactly as I remembered from when my mom made it. My meat didn't come with a seasoning packet so I was worried, but the meat had plenty of flavor. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a 16.9 oz bottle of beer at the beginning when I added the water, and the meat had wonderful flavor. I didn't even bother with the butter and parsley at the end, and I also just added my chunked veggies to the pot during the last 45 minutes of cooking.

I have been a member of this site for quite some time now but I have never left a comment until now.  This dish has now become a family favorite which surprised me because we are a family of very picky eaters!  We all fought who was going to get the leftovers the next day!  I did make minor adjustments & thats just because we like specific tastes in our meals.  We just increased the garlic power (added more as I was cooking) and added maybe a tsp of minced garlic.  Thats it!  Excellent dish and def. a keeper!

Cooked it in the CrockPot... used stout beer instead of water... gave it a robust flavor! Would do it again!! Remember to cut your corned beef against the grain... you'll know the difference if it is stringy, then you are cutting it wrong.

Delicious flavor!  This recipe is great!  My only suggestion is to perhaps specify what variety of potatoes would work best in this dish, as I used Russet and this was clearly the wrong choice--I ended up with disintegrating potatoes.  Thank you for the recipe.

We loved this recipe! I changed it a bit, though. I rinsed the brisket & trimmed the fat, which separated it into two pieces. I used all of this recipe's spices, as well as the spice packet that came with the 4 lb. brisket. At the end of cooking the meat (about 2 1/2 hrs.), I added the carrots & red potatoes first, and cabbage after 15 minutes, then simmered til tender. Skipped the butter & parsley, & served with spicy brown mustard & dill rye bread. Perfection! I can't wait to use the leftovers for Reuben sandwiches, Irish Egg Rolls, & CB&C soup. Thanks for the great recipe, Cindy!

We had guests over for St. Patricks Day. They all loved it, as did I. I did not follow the recipe exactly. I used the packet of spices that came with the roast instead of the bay leaves. I also did not add the parsley because it seemed like it was just for color, and I did not add the butter as it seemed the that juice was greasy enough. I cooked it in a crock pot for about 8 hours. I pulled out the roast and put it on a pretty dish with the vegetables and put it in the oven on a low temperature. I tried to cook the cabbage in the crockpot, but it took to long and we eventually just dumped it all into a stock pot with more water and let it  boil for a few minutes until it was done. It was delicious. Everyone raved and had second. We will do this again next year. We ate it with Irish Soda Bread and limeade.

I didn't like this much but Husband couldn't get enough. I cooked it in the crockpot; it was tender - but by no means shreddable - after about 7 hrs. The carrots and cabbage took about 20 mins.

Cindy, you were right--we were not disappointed!! This was absolutely delicious. I made this for St. Patrick's Day in the crockpot--I cooked it for 6 hrs on high and then had it on low another hour while waiting for my husband to get home from work. I used small red potatoes instead of 6 large potatoes and added more carrots. I had to drain off some liquid and fat toward the end or it might have overflowed. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you!!

I make this every year- I would suggest however that you don't put the cabbage in until the last 20 minutes- and that the carrots, potatoes, (and I also use rutabagas - which are so yummy) take longer than 15 min.

Last year my corned beef and cabbage was a flop.  This year I did some research and found this recipe.  Wow!  What a difference.  This recipe was fun and easy not to mention very delicious.  I did vary it slightly.  I added garlic salt, more peppercorns, a dash of ground cloves and a couple of glugs of beer.  We had my cousin and his family over with their two small children.  What a hit! Both my kids and theirs loved it!  This is a recipe that will definately be made on more than Just St. Patrick's Day!

GREAT recipe.  I tripled the peppercorns and also added a bottle of Michelob light when I began the simmer.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe exactly and it came out perfect!  I need to make this more often than just the obligatory St. Patrick's Day feast!

I grew up on my grandma's corned beef and cabbage on St. Paddy's Day, which she overcooked until dry and stringy.  Understandably, I shied away from corned beef and cabbage for many years, until persuaded to try it well into my adulthood.  It's recipes like this one that have convinced me that corned beef can in fact be juicy, flavorful and delicious; thank you for rescuing me from a bleak culinary memory!

I took half the brisket after cooking,mixed 1 and a half teaspoons mustard with 1/2 cup light brown sugar,put the brisket fatty side up,spread the mustard mixture to cover top,put it under the broiler for 2 to three min till the top bubbled and turned slightly brown.It makes a delicious glaze and everyone loved the taste....it is FANTASTIC!!!!

This was excellent!!  I cooked it for closer to 3.5 hours.  Very tender and the flavor of the vegetables was awesome cooked in the broth.  I took the meat out and let it rest while I cooked the veggies.

This was the first time I've made Corned Beef & Cabbage...it turned out so good and so tender!!!  I did boil the meat on the stove top and added 2 bottles of O'Douls non-alcoholic beer to the water, to give a little extra flavor!  I will be making this dish again!  I think I may have to make this more than just once a year.

This was fabulous. I had to hide a plate for a friend who was late for dinner. I cooked mine in stock  pot on a rolling boil for 30 minutes and then on lo - med for 3 hrs. I also added extra peppercorns and a table spoon of garlic then added the veggies about 20-30 mins before it was finished depening on how tender you like your veggies. The meat was so tender it fell apart when we were cutting it and soo flavorful. Served with a side of this: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Irish-Soda-Bread-3/Detail.aspx  soda bread everyone loved it not a bite left. I also added some caraway to the bread.

My husband has been giving me hints that he would like to have Corned Beef and Cabbage for dinner. I am no Irish and I haven't eaten Corned Beef and Cabbage before. So I don't know how it looks like nor how it taste. I decided one day that I will try to cook it for him coz I we have been eating Lean cuisine for a while and we want some real home cooking. I looked this up and OMG. It taste so good. I was even afraid because I am not sure if I was doing it correctly. The spices just blend together and the corned beef was soo tender. Even my father-in-law loved it. I made this with the Amazingly Irish Soda and it just blends together. They just asked me where is the dessert? :)Anyway, it looks like my husband will be asking me to cook this again.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I had no idea what I was doing and I don't usually care for corned beef.
The butter and parsley at the end is a MUST for buttery tasting veggies and fresh color.  I only cooked the cabbage for 5 minutes and the veggies for 15 (tender crisp).  I substituted Beef Broth for water(recommended by another reader), used coarse sea salt, added 4 whole cloves for a nice added flavor, and red potatoes and baby carrots (on hand).  My brisket was almost 6 pounds and this recipe still worked great.  I had to take the meat out to cook the veggies, but that was perfect for the 'rest period' for the meat.  Also, I had no seasoning packet for the brisket (home raised beef) and it made no difference.  It was better without it!

We loved this.  My brisket was only 3 1/2 lbs, so I added a bunch more potatoes (used small white potatoes, halved).  The whole family loved it, will make again and often!  Our 3 1/2 lb roast comfortably fed 7 adults one 3/4" thick slice.

And add a few pluses to the rating. My husband wanted it for lunch on St Patrick’s Day, so I ended up cooking it the night before in the slow cooker, but potatoes, cabbage and carrots on the stovetop once the meat was done. My 4-year old daughter ended up eating it in the morning for breakfast and she is Russian, not Irish and my husband couldn’t get enough of this meal as well. This was my first time cooking corned beef and I will buy more meat while it’s on sale to cook it again later this year. Thank you for sharing!

This was so easy!  I'd never made a boiled dinner before but my husband really likes them so I decided to surprise him with this for dinner last night. Cooking it was a breeze, and the meat was so tender it just fell apart with a fork.  The only adjustment I had to make was the vegetable cooking time. It took my carrots and potatoes about 22 minutes instead of the 15 stated in the recipe.  Other than that it was perfect!!!

I tried to make this in the crock pot, and followed the suggestion of adding the vegetables in three hours before serving. They came out a bit crisp! Next time I will put the vegetables in with the corned beef. The corned beef was tasty, though.

Excellent recipe!  I made this for last year's St. Pat's day for the first time and I wouldn't change a thing.  As others suggested, try serving it with horseradish sauce - 1/2 cup mayo + 1/2 jarred horseradish.  You will not be disappointed!

Not traditional corned beef and cabbage - I'm over half Irish, so I know the real stuff. It was okay, but I don't reccomend it if you are making a traditional Irish meal.

This dish was a big disappointment for us because it just didn't seem to have enough flavor.  As other posters suggested, I substituted beer for some of the water but otherwise followed the recipe.  The result was disappointingly bland.  This is a high-calorie recipe, so perhaps it's just as well that we didn't like it, but I'll be looking for something more flavorful next time.

This was very good!.. I love corned beef and cabbage!  I was looking for a recipe that didn't need a slow cooker... Our only dissapointment was purchasing a inexpensive off brand brisket and it was very fatty!  Getting around that, the flavor was very good!  I didn't have parsley, so I left it out! I added a can of beer too!  We don't have enough left overs to make hash tomorrow!  That must say something!

This meal was wonderful.  I scaled up the recipe to 10 people.  The only changes I made was, used one bottle of beer in the water, the corned beef came with season pkgs used them plus the ones that the recipe call for.  Also, since we were having 10 people for dinner I put all of the veggies in seperate pieces of cheese cloth, it worked out great, one cheescloth of potatoes (5 lbs), one of carrots, etc... this made it so easy to serve.

All of the food went and everyone raved!!

Gave 3 stars since I tried this one but once I founded "Slow Cooked Corned Beef for Sandwiches" on this sight I found my keeper.  it is simlar except it usese lots of garlic and peppercorns and beer and it is much more tasty than this recipe.  all you do is add the vegetables after the meat is cooked and it would make a much better tasting meal.

This corned beef was really good.  I used the season packet and all the spice suggested in this recipe.  The only thing I changed was putting the butter in after I put the veggies in a bowl.  I also salted and peppered them at that time.

Excellent!  I cooked mine with beef broth - wonderful suggestion, have never done that before.  I liked the addition of the butter at the end as if the beef did not have enough fat to start with!  Yummy!

Excellent! Very tender, very flavorful. I did tweak the recipe a tad. I rinsed the brisket well. I used the spice packet, plus what the recipe called for. I also used a can of beef broth along with water. I cooked it a little over three hours. The potatoes and veggies were very tasty as well. The butter and parsley at the end of the cooking time put this recipe over the top. Everyone at the table loved it! I'm keeping this recipe for next year.

I have always been curious about Corned Beef our local butcher sells one with the spice package but I also used all the spices called for in this recipe. I also used a bottle of Dark Beer and 2 cups of beef stock along with water for cooking liquid. My Hubs and 6 yr old LOVED this meal and next time I will use my slow cooker.

This recipe was very good as it was. My children enjoyed it...that says a lot. I gave four stars because of that reason. I have not tried brisket that I liked that much.   Because I had no peppercorns, I used about 1/2 tablespoon coarse ground black pepper (actually, Meijer pepper supreme).  If I make this again, I will put in half the salt and use more pepper or peppercorns.

No sure I'm the biggest corned beef fan, but this recipe was great to make this dish on St. Patricks Day so I could find that out. Better luck next year with finding the St. Patricks Day dish that I love.

I really liked this a bunch. I had a 6.5lb corned beef and I think I should have cooked it a little longer than 4 hours but, that was my error. The recipe was very good. The best part was adding the butter and the parsley at the end. I did add a little salt at the end as well. 
Thank you for sharing!!!

I have made this recipe many times, but this time I did something different.  I added a bottle of Guiness, 3 garlic cloves, and some beef broth along with the water.  My family loves this.

This dish came out fabulous.  It was the best corned beef and cabbage I've ever had.  I took the meat out and let it rest while I cooked the vegetables because there wasn't enough room in the pot for it all.  Also, I thought it was ruined because the meat never seemed tender with a fork, but when we sliced it, it was nice and tender and moist.

Not bad, but I would only make this once a year.  It's boiled food, so it's gonna be bland.  I do love corned beef sandwiches, so I'm looking forward to my sandwich today..  I added a bottle of beer, used sliced fresh garlic, and I quartered the onion and put toothpicks in the quarters to keep them together.  I ate this with soda bread and Guiness.  Erin go bragh

This was fairly good, but the Slow Cooked Corned Beef for Sandwiches uses lots of peppercorns and lots of real garlic and it is a thousand times tastier.

Very good recipe! I used a 3 pound brisket and covered it with water and pickling spices and added one bottle of Sam Adams lager. The meat simmered for 3 hours and 30 mins. and I added the carrots and cabbage during the last 30 mins. I served this corned beef and cabbage with mashed baby red potatoes and the "Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread" from this site. Wow! The meat was juicy and tender and sliced beautifully once it rested for about 10 mins. Absolutely delicious!

This was very good! My corned beef came without a seasoning packet, so I was glad to find this recipe!  I cooked it in the crockpot most of the day, probably 7-8 hours in all. I did leave out the potatoes, because I made colcannon on the side instead. Thanks for the recipe!

This is very yummy but if you really want great corned beef and cabbage use a little more than half beer instead of all water.  I use 4 12oz cans of Budweiser and the rest water.  It makes it so much more tasty and tender!

Excellent!  We've always done our St. Patty's Day regular old corned beef/cabbage/potatoes, and it was always good--but this just about pushed us over the edge.  I used one can of beef broth and added some beef bouillon granules to the remaining water.  Followed the recipe and also added the spice packet, cooked in a cast iron dutch oven on the stove top.  The recipe didn't indicate if it should be covered, but I did throughout most of the simmer time.  I saved the cooking liquid because my husband wants a repeat today instead of corned beef sandwiches!  Thanks so much for posting.

This was very good! My husband loved this recipe and it is easy to use the leftover meat for reubens-just make with rye bread and swiss cheese and sauerkraut. Yum!

Very good recipe!  I made a few minor changes.  Instead of the peppercorns I just added the packet of seasonings that came with the brisket (it had peppercorns in it).  Thankfully I didn't have to skim the fat off the top because I left it for a few minutes with a lid on the pan and the fat boiled out.  :)  I wouldn't have skimmed anyway due to the fact I didn't want to take the spices out too (they float).  Also, instead of garlic powder I added a whole bunch of minced garlic.  Very, very good.

This was great! I've tried many Corned Beef and Cabbage recipes and this by far was the best. My husband and two little kids just loved it!! It made our St. Patty's Day dinner perfect.

I had never made corned beef before and didn't know what to expect. This was sooooo good. I left out the butter and salt and added much more garlic powder. I also put the veggies in with the beef for about 2 1/2 hours and they were great. I also cooked more veggies in the leftover broth because everyone ate the first batch and they were almost as flavorful. I made hash using just the potatoes and beef and it was fabulous! I made this today in the crock pot and it wasn't nearly as good. It was dry and had very little flavor. Stick with the stove top!

The Corned Beef beef was awesome, but the cabbage and potatoes were not that flavorful. But it was good.

Very tasty recipe!!  My husband and I really enjoyed it but the children didn't really go for the cabbage.  I love cooked cabbage so I have no problems with leftovers.

This is great; the only thing I did different was to add a few chicken bouillon cubes and a little Cavender’s Greek Seasoning to the water for a little more flavor.

Absolutely foolproof and delicious!  I substituted a bottle of beer for some of the water, took my 4-pound plus corned beef out of the pot after simmering for two hours, and cooked the veggies in the pot for about 30 minutes.  We
did not need the soda bread; being that I have Type II diabetes, I did not  miss the bread :)

I used beer instead of water. I also added a beef bouillon cube. This turned out sooo tender. It also made some of the best corned beef hash the next day.

We are an Irish family through and through, and we have boiled dinners quite often. Corned Beef and Cabbage is a staple on St. Patrick's day. Since we love it so much we had this at my mom's house last weekend. This weekend was my turn to cook and the family wanted to have it again! I'd never made it before, but this recipe was fantastic. Very easy and flavorful. The only thing I noticed was that the water kept boiling down below the meat, so I had to add some every 45 minutes or so. Thank you for making me look like a great cook, even compared to my mom's delicious meal. :)

This was a perfect, classic way to make corned beef and cabbage.  The vegetables and meat came out perfectly and were delicious.  I don't usually care for cabbage but even that was good since it absorbed the other flavors.  This will be my go-to corned beef recipe from now on!

I have made this recipe every St. Patrick's day for years, and it is by far my family's favorite. I tried a different recipe last year and was terribly disappointed. I'm back to this one this year because I know it is the best! Thanks, Cindy!

Great Recipe!! One change that I did instead of all water...use 1 large bottle of beer.(any kind) Adds a rich flavor.

I have looked for a corned beef and cabbage recipe and Wow,What an amazing meal this was! I followed everything I did add a little more garlic powder and pepper corn and used Kosher salt instead of regular salt, it was absolutely delicious!  My husband loved it and I did as well and will defiantly make this again thanks so much!

I made this for St.Patty's Day this year. It was the best corn beef and cabbage my husband and I ever had. As per other reviews, I used beef broth instead of water. I only had enough to cover half of the roast, so I ended up using some water anyway. I also added lots of minced garlic as my family loves garlic. It was perfect!

We really liked this one. I only changed the seasonings a bit because I was using a brisket that had already been seasoned.
Unseasoned briskets are hard to find in our area.

Very good and easy recipe that my kids liked!  I've made Corned Beef & Cabbage before but this is, by far, the best way I've had it.  The potatoes were yummy and the meat was very tender. It does take a while to cook so next time I would start earlier!  I would definitely use this recipe again. Delicious!

A St. Patrick's Day staple! I used a 1.5lb brisket and still didn't have enough room in the pot for the potatoes (maybe my dutch oven is only 4qt). Just took the meat out at the end and cooked the veggies in the juices. Easy and delicious.

Yum yum yum.  I made this meal as instructed, and although it was time consuming, it was delicious.  I echo the suggestion to buy a good piece of meat, though. The extra cost will pay off in tenderness.

This was my first time having corned beef and cabbage, and I personally didn't like it(that's me not the recipes fault).Now my partner loves it(she has had this type a meal allot) and she said it was a 5 star so that's why it's getting the highest rating.

This is my first time making/ trying corned beef and cabbage, and I discovered I don't like it, not the recipe's fault but after skimming all that fat off the corned beef I really lost my appetite... But my guy is a big fan and he said it was fine, just like corned beef and cabbage should be.  He said he's had better, (his mom's, of course), but this one was still really good.  If I make it again for him, I'll probably use this same recipe.  Thanks, Cindy.

WOW! Fabulous recipe! I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of a little more butter. I also ground a little sea salt over the vegetables right before serving them. My kids & picky-hubby devoured it! We'll make this again - and not just for St. Patrick's day! Thanks Cindy!

This meal hit the spot. It was a little bland but I'll blame it on the cheap brisket I bought on sale for $2.50 (yikes). The family still enjoyed it! This is a Keeper......
