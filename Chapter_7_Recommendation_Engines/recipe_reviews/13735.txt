Wow!  Yummy!!  I actually didn't make this recipe on the stovetop.  I roasted the brussels sprouts in the oven.  They were carmelized and oh so good!  Just put the brussels sprouts in a baking dish, almost cover them with broth (I used about 1/4 less than the recipe called for), bake for 20 minutes on 400.  Remove them from the oven, take out the brussels sprouts and prepare the mustard sauce in the baking dish (since there is less broth, the sauce gets really creamy-yum!!), return the brussels sprouts to the dish and bake for about 10 minutes until the sauce reaches the right consistency.  These were the best brussels sprouts I have ever had!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  Even my toddler ate them!  The only change I made was to add less corn startch (based on reviews I'd read).  Sauce was creamy and very flavorful.  It was a great way to dress up often boring brussels.  Will make again!

Yum! This is the best sauce ever and tastes great on the Brussels sprouts. I also use it on artichokes and asparagus. I put in 2 tablespoons of lemon juice instead of 2 teaspoons to suit my taste.

This was so tasty!  I used horseradish mustard and doubled the amount.  Didn't have corn starch, so I substituted 4tbsp flour. Also added some chopped up corned beef I had sitting in the fridge and topped it with seasoned bread crumbs.  I served the dish with buckwheat and sauerkraut - absolutely delicious!

Neither my husband or I are brussel sprout fans but boiling in the broth really did take the bitterness out of the sprouts - the sauce was tasty as well.  Good with Corned beef & mashed potatoes.

Whoops!  Clicked too soon!  Want to tell you that this is a totally wonderful recipe for brussels sprouts.  I've always loved them, but did, in fact, always find them a bit bitter.  I'm truly amazed at how sweet and tender they are prepared this way.  And the sauce only enhances them; although I had to add more broth to thin out the sauce---but no biggy.  Great, great recipe.  I'll be having sprouts more often now!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Delicious but sauce was too thick...needed to  add more broth, less cornstarch. Once sauce thinned out, recipe was fabulous.

Very nice!  I really like brussells sprouts and enjoy them steamed without anything added, but my husband, on the other hand, is not really a big fan (usually he will only eat one or two sprouts), however, after I made this recipe, he had two large helpings.  I would also suggest to those who mentioned the sauce needed to absorb into the sprouts - try using baby brussells sprouts.  I find these are ususally more tender and not bitter.

My family (even the kids )love brussels. I make this quite frequently- sometimes with fresh and sometimes frozen.

If your Brussels are still bitter after boiling in chicken broth- you aren't boiling long enough.

This recipe as written is great- different and delicious. Being Italian, I need garlic in everything so I add garlic every time bacon sometimes, fresh herbs, etc..You can customize to your liking. 
I have made these with Dijon and Honey Mustard- it's great every time.
We really enjoy this as written and modified.
Thank you for sharing!

Awesome and everyone asks for this recipe. BUT, I suggest roasting/grilling/caramelizing with garlic S&P and Olive oil to get the sugars out, then cover with the sauce and serve.

Excellent recipe. Even the non brussel sprout fans in family liked this dish.  Next time I think I will add toasted walnuts just before serving just to give it some star power. But excellent as is.

We are not huge fans of Brussels Sprouts but need to incorporate more veggies in our diet. For being Brussels, this was GREAT! The mustard and lemon combo made them completely tolerable. Thanks!

I loved this recipe! The mustard sauce is also good with artichokes, asparagus and even over chicken! Boiling the sprouts in chicken broth first really made all the difference. I added a small amount of horseraddish to the sauce for a little extra kick!

This is about as good as brussel sprouts can get, IMHO.  I'm not a big fan, but needed to add some additional veggies to my Thanksgiving dinner.  I actually ate all my brussel sprouts, for the first time in my life.

Boiling in chicken broth really does seem to cut the bitterness of the sprouts.  I found that the sauce was rather thick, but added more broth until I got the right consistency.

The widely varying reviews are probably that way because everybody used different mustard. Luckily, my mustard worked well. I didn't have lemon juice but next time I'll try it with lemon juice and I'm sure it'll be even better.

This has become one of our families favorites.  It's quick and easy to make and even my older daughter who now lives on her own has stated that she'd better get an invite for dinner when they are on the menu.  My husband who hated vegetables asks for this quite often!  If you haven't tried this, it's worth the minimal effort.  You will be surprised and it will become a go to recipe for you just like it has for me.

Very good.  Too much sauce for us though and also too thick.  I'm cutting the cornstarch in half next time and quartering the sauce amount.  Thanks for sharing!

We loved this!  My husband is not usually a brussel sprouts fan and he went for seconds and then finished off the one or two left in the serving dish.  The chicken broth really does help with the bitterness of the sprouts.  I was trying to decide between this recipe and another with bread crumbs and decided to add some bread crumbs to the sauce at the very end and then sprinkled just a bit on top after adding the sauce to the sprouts.    Will definitely make again.

This recipe was great.  I don't think it needed as much cornstarch to thicken the sauce so I might just cut back on that next time.  I was looking for a good low-fat preparation for brussel sprouts and I know I have found my new method for cooking them.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year for something different. It was a hit - there were no leftovers. I would make this again without any changes.

This is good, but I always add more mustard, and pepper. Otherwise I think the sauce is too much like cornstarch.

Quite good, just needed a little salt and pepper added to it. Even my 3-yr-old daughter liked the brussels sprouts with this tangy sauce.

Wasn't a fan of the lemon juice.  The second time I made it I left out the lemon juice and added a tsp of sugar, it was awesome.

The brussels sprouts were bitter, while the sauce was a most unappetizing color and consistency. Although we love mustard,the sauce did not enhance the sprouts.

Per some earlier reviews, I wish I would have cut back on the cornstarch as it was way too much. If I cook this again, I'll also leave out the lemon juice and be sure to use a creamier, less coarse dijon mustard.

I made this in the oven method and it took much longer than 30 minutes to cook. It actually took almost an hour. But, I started cooking early so no harm, no foul. It was good this way, I would cook this again.

Not bad.  My husband and my 7 year old love brussel sprouts.  Me and my 4 year old are not the hugest fans . . . but we both ate them prepared this way.  My 4 year old ate 4 of them which was a MIRACLE!  And I even ate a few.  This is the best way I have ever tried them. (I did add more broth)

I enjoyed this recipe - it was easy to prepare and quite tasty.  The sprouts retained a bit of their usual bitterness, but not terribly so.  I sliced my sprouts in half to expedite cooking.

Enjoyed making it and the taste was nice. Likely won't make it again as I prefer to steam and saute with garlic and olive oil/butter or place it in the oven topped with bread crumbs and grated cheese, olive oil, and garlic.

I made this about a year ago, and threw out what was left over. Maybe I did something wrong, but the consistency of the sauce and the taste did not go well with the brussel sprouts in my opinion.

I wasn't sure if "prepared mustard" meant dry mustard.  I used chicken stock I'd frozen from having boiled chicken.  I am a lover of brussel sprouts, but this did not come out the way I expected at all.  I will not be making it again.

People always rave about my cooking; I'm some glad I didn't serve this to guests! Not good at all! My only saving grace was that I tasted the sauce before adding the sprouts, which we love, so we didn't waste them.

OK for sprouts, but I think it needed more mustard flavor.  I had plenty of sauce-perhaps because I covered the pot when cooking the sprouts?

I changed it around a bit, used flour instead of cornstarch, lime instead of lemon (about three squeezed) and added Balsamic Vinegar to the mustard. Still, the concept is fab; my son is 16 months old and even he loved it!

The sauce was wonderful and when people went for seconds they used this sauce instead of gravy.  The brussel sprouts were very good also and they retained their heat because of the sauce.

We didn't care for this recipe too much.  I am the only one who likes brussel sprouts and didn't like them like this and those that didn't like them didn't care for them anymore this way.

The sauce was a bit thicker than I would have liked, so next time I will either decrease the amount of sauce or increase the amount of sprouts.   I'm not a big fan of mustard but tried one with white wine and Walla Walla sweet onions in it and it was flavorful.  The consistency was just a bit off; definitely a keeper recipe.

I made a small batch of this, and the hubby and I really enjoyed it, even as leftovers a couple of days later. Because I  do often have leftovers, I roasted them instead of boiling them, so  they'd err on the crispy side to stand up to reheating. My hubby particularly liked the mustard in the mix. This will be my go to recipe for Brussels sprouts when I serve them on their own.

We normally love our brussels sprouts roasted with bacon. This was a really nice change. It is excellent the way it is, but I might experiment next time and roast the sprouts first, then cover with sauce!

I have made this recipe many times & it is always enjoyed by all.  Chicken broth does a nice job of lessening the strong taste of the Brussel sprouts & the mustard & lemon juice give them brightness.

This is quick, easy, low cal and delicious!  My husband, who likes Brussels sprouts told me that these were the best he ever tasted.  The next time I make them, I might add a little more mustard.   But really, they are delicious as is.

Have tried a couple of different recipes for brussel sprouts.  Roasting is the best way if you think brussel sprouts are bitter tasting.  The sauce is good, but the brussel sprouts still taste bitter.

Delicious as is! I forgot to add the lemon as I did not have a fresh one on hand. After I tasted it I realized what was missing and added a few sprinkles of True Lemon crystallized lemon. Just the right flavor. Even my husband said, "Ususally I am sick of eating them after a few but I am finishing the leftovers now!" I did add salt to taste while on my plate.

Disappointing! The brussel sprouts tasted great when they came out of the chicken broth...but then when i poured the sauce, ooh, it just didn't taste good. Almost like it needed salt or spices or something. Now granted - perhaps it's because i used spicy brown mustard instead of dijon?

Substituted flour for corn starch which worked perfectly.  While not the best brussels sprouts I've ever had, a very servicable recipe.

This was a good way to cook these greens. I never liked brussels sprouts until now! This is a healthy way to eat them (rather than covering them in salt and butter). I didn't have cornstarch, so I used flour instead, and it turned out just fine.

This is not a recipe for those who enjoy the flavor of brussel sprouts. I used 4 tablespoons flour in place of the cornstarch, so that may have affected the result, but I found the sauce to be too "mustardy" (and I LOVE mustard!), and that it generally took away from the deliciousness of the brussel sprouts.

I think this recipe is great. Cooking the sprouts in the chicken broth takes some of the bitterness out of them. The only thing I might change was using half the amount for the lemon juice. Excellent though makes me like sprouts which I am not necessarily a fan of plain.

OK. I've always hated brussels sprouts. I'm trying to make myself eat them. This really didn't do much for me, but they were better than normal and I was at least able to finish my plate. I was hoping it would make me love b.sprouts. Oh well, I'll look for a miracle somewhere else...

Meh. I had less than a pound of Brussles sprouts, so I tried to adjust the amounts for the sauce. It came out too watery, so I must've done that wrong.  As for the flavor, it was okay but nothing special. It definitely needed something more, perhaps just salt and pepper.

I followed another users advice and baked in oven at 400 for 20 min. Came out really nice, except I should have left them in there for longer because they were still a bit tough. Great flavor though!

Very simple and good.  Take the sauce off the burner a little earlier and let thicken.

A great way to make brussels sprouts taste great! I used a spicy brown mustard that gave the sauce a mild mustard taste.

What a great recipe. The sauce could be used on other veggies too. I am on WeightWatchers and love low point foods with flavor and flair. Thanks for the recipe.

Hubbie and I both love brussel sprouts, and I'm always looking for different ways to fix them, but this will not be one of them again. Neither of us cared much for it. I wasn't crazy about the mustard taste.

Wow! This was a very delicious sauce - even my hubby who is not crazy about Brussel Sprouts loved it.  And now I make it to go on other dishes like fish, chicken, pork and other veggies.  Its a keeper!

What a great way to serve those dreaded-by-most brussel sprouts. I followed the recipe to a T.  As soon as I added the cornstarch, it turned to paste.  I did not have any more chicken broth, so I added a bit of water.  Then tasted it and thought it then tasted watered down, so I added 2 T butter.  YUM!  This side dish was enjoyed by all.  Thank you!

I changed a few things in this recipe, but overall it was great. My husband and I had never had brussel sprouts before, and we both really enjoyed this recipe.

I agree that the sauce needs to penetrate through the sprouts somehow in order to make them more edible. Maybe cutting the sprouts into smaller pieces so they can be covered in sauce would help? Anyway, I enjoyed the tangy sauce but it didn't really improve the sprouts. UPDATE: I have been eating the leftover sprouts cut up with salt and pepper and they aren't too bad, provided there is lots of seasoning. 3 stars.

The flavor of the sauce really doesn't get a chance to "perk up" the sprouts.  The sauce has promise, but would be more appreciated with something that got the chance to soak it in.
