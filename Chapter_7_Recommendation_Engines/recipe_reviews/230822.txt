Yum. I used a whole sweet potato and less onion. Instead of heavy cream I used half and half. And parm for the cheese.

Used onions in place of leeks. Added some leftover diced ham for my meat loving family and it filled their bellies for brunch with a salad & soup.

excellent tastes, I did add some fresh rosemary, and i just used the cheese that I had in my frig.  It tastes fabulous, however, Next time I will be sure to have the cheese it calls for,
I did not have any sour cream so I omitted that and added an additional 1/4 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 cream.
Consistency still good.

We do meatless Mondays, and my husband isn’t crazy about most dishes - though he eats them.  this he really  liked.  Easy and the leftovers will make a lunch or breakfast so this one’s a keeper.

This was very good.  After reading the other reviews, I used a whole sweet potato.  Also added spinach and used fat free 1/2  & 1/2 instead of the cream.  I put it in a crust, just because I like having crust on a quiche but it baked up nicely and would be fine without one.

Very happy with the results and will make it again.  I did add the 1/2 c flour.  Used white potatoes as we didn't have the sweet but look forward to trying it with the sweet potatoes the next time.

I added three extra sweet potatoes (consulting another recipe) to get rid of extra sweet potatoes I had in the fridge. Because there was a lot of potato to cook, I cooked them in the microwave (again, due to the other recipe - stick holes in each with fork and microwave in about one half inch of water for about 12 mins) then cut them up and added them to the onion mixture. It makes a very sweet quiche but still very good. I also used just whatever shredded cheese I had in the fridge (Mexican four cheese blend) for the topping.

Good recipe. I did modify a bit- used 1/4 cup of flour the others have mentioned to add a crust to it. I also used a whole sweet potato, probably 2tsp of kosher salt and added about 1/4 cup of Asiago into mix prior to baking. I also topped with a mix of sour cream, Greek plain yogurt, olive oil and salt and pepper for a sauce. It was good!

Great recipe.  I did not have asiago cheese so shredded old cheddar and put a lot more on the top.  I am not sure it is necessary to use whipping cream but I thought I would try and follow it and it is good.  However next time I will probably just use my 1% milk and see what happens.  This is a great way to use up your vegetables and stretch the budget.  Would be lovely with a nice salad and this would make a nice meal fresh out of the oven for company!

A good way to use up a sweet potato which is definitely healthier than a regular potato. I, too used a whole medium sweet potato. My grandson (8 yr. old) said they tasted like carrots. He did eat his whole serving. If you want more of a crust on your quiche, add 1/4 cup of flour to your egg mixture. Because I often add Tabasco sauce on my cooked scrambled eggs or omelette, I added hot sauce on top of my serving. I would make this again if I wanted a sweet potato for my meal. I would not buy a sweet potato so I could make this, though.

Great recipe. I made a simple crust under the quiche and the whole dish came out amazing. Didn't use leak (didn't have any) needs more salt than the recipe calls for. Used a whole sweet potato and boiled it in hot water before putting it In the frying pan. Used a different cheese on top.
Definately will make again :)

It was flippin' gorgeous coming out of the oven and the flavor was wonderful but even though I served it with rice, I missed the crust to hold it all together. Also I had more than enough ingredients for my 9" pie plate.
