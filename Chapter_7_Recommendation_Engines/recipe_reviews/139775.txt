I only gave this 3 stars because I had to make a major adjustment... it was excellent AFTER I doubled the peanut butter.  It was WAY too sweet and didnt taste much like PB when I followed the recipe.  Do yourself a favor...either 1/2 the sugar, or double the PB.

I went with VOODOOMISS's suggestion & made this recipe with 1/3 c. sugar, 1/3 c water, then 2/3 c. pb.  After I stirred to blend, I just used a whisk to fluff it up.  Turned out exactly how i wanted it to.

Easy to make and tasted great. It didn't look smooth so I whipped it with my stick blender and fluffed it up. I didn't think that it would get thick but it was just right. Will make again.

This recipe is very close to the Friendly's restaurant peanut butter sauce.  It came together easily and a quick mix with the hand beaters fluffed it up quite a bit.  It has a wonderful consistency that doesn't harden up and it's just sweet enough.

I followed the advice of others. I used 1/3 cup water, 1/3 cup sugar and 1 cup peanutbutter. After I stirred the ingredients I added 1 tablespoon butter and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. It was velvety smooth and delicious!

We made this for Father's Day.  We doubled the PB, and used a stick blender to make it nice and smooth.  My son is licking the pan clean!  Yum!  Oh we used it on top of "Elvis" Brownie Sundaes:  brownie, then vanilla ice cream, bananas, and PB topping.

Excellent! Much better than those store bought toppings. I agree with the other review, it thicken up beautifully once I used my stand up hand mixer.

I made this like the other comments suggested, 1/3 c sugar, 1/3 c water, 2/3 cup peanut butter. It was really delicious! It tastes like our favorite ice cream place.

SUPER YUMMY!!! I love the PB Hotfudge sundae at Braum's, and now I can make it at home...ALOT cheaper though!!! Be sure to use the hand blender thing, it wouldn't come together without it! Girl Scouts love it too!! We had a sundae party and I brought the PB topping!

Eh, not so great.  I have a *major* sweet tooth and as is, the recipe is wayy too sweet.  I ended up doubling the peanut butter and adding a pinch or two of salt to cut the sweetness.  The texture was also a mess.  I stirred it with a wooden spoon and tried a whisk but with no luck.  I ended up having to dump it all in the blender and give it a healthy whirl.  This is a recipe with room for improvement.

I also used 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup water like some other posters. I still kept the peanut butter to 1/2 cup. I whisked the PB in with a hand mixer and let it sit for a few minutes and it thickened up a bit. Very tasty!!!!

Today my son and I made this together. He said it was quick and easy and he thought it would take longer to make this kind of sauce. We put sauce in the middle and on top of our ice cream. It was very good. I added a little less water and more peanut butter. Next time I may add even less water and sugar. Very good, though.

This was AMAZING!!  I only rated it 4 stars because I used only 1/2 c of sugar, 1/2 c of water and an extra big scoop of peanut butter.  It melted together beautifully and was creamier than I expected.  I served it with chocolate syrup over bananas for dessert.  I can't wait to try it over ice cream!

I'm wondering if it would be a little better with evaporated milk? I didn't care for the consistancy.

I cut the recipe in half and used splenda in place of the sugar. It came out just as I had hoped.  I mixed everything by hand and the sauce was smooth.

This recipe was sooo quick to whip up. I also opted for the 1/3 c. sugar 1/3 c. water and 2/3 cup peanut butter. My husband is such a nut for peanut butter and icecream so the extra peanut butter was a plus. I think I will try this with the crunchy peanut butter as well. Thank you MsRonnie7 for sharing.

When I was pregnant, I decided a peanut butter sundae with peaches would be excellent.  I did not have any peanut butter topping, so I made this recipe and was not disappointed.  Not quite as good as the pre-made store bought kind, but it did the trick!

I used VOODOOMISS' recipe: 1/3 cup water, 1/3 cup sugar, 2/3 cup pb.  Awesome!  I also took everyone else's suggestions about whisking.  Perfect!  I refrigerated the leftovers and spread it on chocolate graham crackers the next day. Super yummy!  I plan on making these for Christmas gifts.

Followed other reviewers by using 1/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup water and 2/3 cups peanut butter. So quick and easy to make and crazy good. I'm going to use it as the swirl in my homemade pb ice cream this afternoon once ice cream mixture chills a little longer in fridge. Also going to add Reese pb morsels. I'm trying to re-create, or at least come close to, Publix's Greenwise PB Trinity Ice Cream. Fun!

I went with the modified recipe in the most helpful review: 1/3 cup water, 1/3 cup sugar, 2/3 cup peanut butter. I didn't need to whip or whisk it; stirring it constantly eventually causes the PB and sugar water to blend nicely together.

The flavour is very good; I'd probably still cut back a little on the sugar for my own taste. But this still hardens and gets clumpy when put on ice cream. I'm looking for a recipe that stays syrupy, if possible.

Disappointing...way too sweet as written but when I made it with 1/3 c. sugar, 1/3 c. water and 2/3 c. peanut butter, it was way too thick, almost crumbly, like fudge. I was really hoping to find a decent peanut butter sauce....the search continues...

I used 1/2 cup whole milk instead of water & 1/2 cup sugar with 1/2 cup peanut butter.   While I trying to create a thicker consistency by whipping with hand held mixers I also ADDED a teaspoon vanilla. It was perfect. Definitely sweet.

I made this using 2/3 water, 2/3 sugar and 1 1/3 cup of peanut butter. It went together beautifully and tastes wonderful! Not too sweet and just the right amount of peanut butter flavor. I just used a wisk and it turned out perfect.

I used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup water. Brought to a rolling boil for 1 minute. Added 1 cup peanut butter. Turned burner off but left pot on hot burner while working in the pb. Nice consistency. Good pb flavor!

I am definitely going to try this recipe. There were many comments on the grainy consistency. I will make a simple syrup using 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup sugar. Bring to boil and reduce heat while stirring to completely dissolve the sugar. Then add 1 cup peanut butter, a small amount of butter (for sheen) and a bit of vanilla. Whisk with hand blender (whisk attachment), or whatever means you have to blend till smooth.

I thought this was way too sweet. I did not enjoy it at all...it actually ruined my bowl of ice cream :(
I agree with an earlier review...either cut the sugar in half or double the peanut butter.

Eh, the recipe was OK to start with, MUCH better with a couple alterations. I used 1/3 cup sugar.  Still pretttty sweet though.  If you're going to try this, I recommend using 1/3 (or even 1/4) cup sugar, and twice the recommended amount of PB.   I def. will next time.

I searched for a peanut butter type filling or frosting using a limited source of ingreadients, So I made this adding a teaspoone of hot fudge to get a more setup finish. Then using a pipeing bag I injected it into my chocolate cake batter and finally drizzled it over the finished cake. Awesome just what I needed for a recovering alcoholics monster sweet tooth!!:)

This was ok, but if you are seeking something closer to the Friendly’s topping I reccommend this instead: use all natural peanut butter (this is important for the right texture and flavor. Most grocery stores have various brands)). I usually start with 1/2 cup; mix in  a small amount of peanut oil (add about a tablespoon at a time and stir to combine after each addition until you get a consistency that is still thick but can be poured). Once it’s the desired consistency add powdered sugar, again by tablespoon, mixing after each addition, until it is sweetened slightly  or to your preference. Note: if the addition of powdered sugar thickens the sauce too much simply add a bit more peanut oil and stir until it’s pouring consistency. Any left over can be stored in an airtight container in a cupboard for a few days.

I too doubled the peanut butter, though for my tastes it could have used even more. It looked a bit curdled until I took a whisk to it and it started to cool, then it smoothed out beautifully. I think the instructions may just be a bit incomplete

My family were unhappy with plain vanilla ice cream,  so I got on allrecipes.com & found this awesome recipe. I added one tablespoon of vanilla & 2 tablespoons butter. It was amazing. All seven were very happy. It only took about 5 minutes. Smiles all around.

I looooove peanut butter sauce on ice cream. So I had to make this recipe. I used organic peanut butter (because that was the only thing I had on hand) so I left the sugar alone. Followed the directions, I noticed it needed some extra stirring to make it nice and smooth. It turned out delicious! I will make this again no doubt. It was perfect with a brownie and vanilla ice cream.

Follow the third cup water and sugar with two thirds peanut butter alteration.  Came out great that way although a touch runny. 

Also I put the sugar and water in a glass bowl in the microwave, heated and stirred to dissolve sugar then added peanut butter and whipped it, worked fine took 5 minutes to make start to finish.

Very tasty and much better than Dairy Queen's p.b. topping!

I wanted peanut butter sauce to go with hot fudge on my husband's birthday cheesecake--brownie chocolate chip cheesecake from this site. He LOVES Friendly's peanut butter sauce, so when I saw another reveiwer compared this to that, I got very excited.  I didn't think it was quite right, though pretty similar.  Also, I followed ratios given by reviewers and used 1/4 c. sugar, 1/4 c. water, and 1/2 c. peanut butter.  I will use this again, but I may try some powdered sugar to get more of a thick, Friendly's-like consistency.

I used 2/3 cup peanut butter, 1/3 cup water and skipped the sugar. I heated up the water in the microwave and added the peanut butter to the hot water. I mixed it with a wire wisk and added a little extra water (about a tablespoon) to thin it out a little. It's perfect, exactly what I was looking for and very easy!!

I made this with 1/3 C  sugar, 1/3 C water and 2/3 C peanut butter. I liked the proportions (it made it kind of thick, w/ a good PB taste), but did mix in about 1 Tbs milk at the end to make it slightly creamier. Pretty good!

I made this recipe yesterday. It was so easy to make took probably 5 minutes to make. It is good but it is not like the friendlys peanut butter sauce. i find it to be thicker and sweeter than theirs. I would make it again, i love peanut butter.

Very simple and straight forward to make.  I used 1 cup of peanut butter instead of the half cup.  Made a delicious and different ice cream topping.

Even just using 1/2 cup of sugar, it is too sweet.  The texture is grainy and gritty.

I made this with 1/4c of splenda sugar blend and 'all natural' peanut butter. It was YUMMY on top of vanilla ice cream. It looks unappetizing though!

The recipe was simple for what we needed in  apinch/we read recipes off this site from athens, greece-we are american they do not have a lot of things you can just buy at the grocery store in america, so this was perfect for us. I followed someone elses advice & doubled on the peanut butter, it was still a bit sweet, so next time i may cut down on the sugar-but it was simple to make! thanks for the simple yummy recipe!

I used this as one of the middle layers of an ice cream cake I made for my 13 year old niece.  She looooved it!  And so did everyone else in my family!  The compliments were neverending!

1 cup sugar to 1 cup water works much better.
