I was looking for something easy and fast, and since I had most of the ingredients on hand, I gave it a go. I made my rice in the rice cooker, and made the sauce. Poured it over the rice and mixed. Really tasty! I just had Indian curry and canned black beans on hand, so I substituted those. Needed a little more seasoning, so added some garlic pepper and Cajun seasoning. It makes a good amount, so I'll have meals for a few days. Thank you!

This recipe is very good and makes a great side dish.  Next time I would use less sugar and add more salt.  And possibly more curry.  It is good leftover as well.  I would definitely make it again!
