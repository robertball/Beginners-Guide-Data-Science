I made these as the directions state but for a party of six. They were fantastic! I was very careful not to over mix the egg whites into the chocolate mixture, and as a result I think I under mixed a bit. The flavor was still amazing, but the color was not uniform.  Next time, during that step, I'll mix them a bit more.

I did not have the 70% dark chocolate so used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead. I also used a wheat free flour mix  for the flour. It was a fun desert to make, and my husband and I loved it! We served it with a dab of whipped topping. I enjoyed watching Chef John's instructions before I started cooking! I will definitely make this again.

Superb recipe.  I topped it with creme anglaise and it was excellent.

Some tips; The flour, butter and milk mixture will be almost a thick batter, don't worry, this is correct!  Fill your ramekins almost to the tippy top.  This will ensure that when your souffle falls in the time from oven to table, it will still have height and look stunning.

This is the first time I have ever attempted a soufflé, and it worked beautifully! My ramekins are 8 oz, so I made 150% the recipe and it made precisely what I needed to fill both ramekins up to ¼ inch from the rims. They both rose perfectly and after 12 minutes had just the texture I hoped for! Wet and airy. Perfect for chocolate lovers. I made soufflé! So fun!

Delicious.  Used semi-sweet chocolate chips. I doubled the recipe, put into 3 ramekins (6 oz each), and baked for 20-25 minutes.

Delicious and fairly straightforward, I had never made a soufflé before and I found this pretty easy, surprisingly..  I used semi sweet chocolate as I didn't have any dark, and I omitted the cayenne, again because I didn't have any.  I only had ramekins that were too big (about 8 oz) so it didn't crest the top as it should have. Next time I will double the recipe so that it will suit the size of my ramekins. I made this start to finish in under 30 minutes, and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Excellent.

This souffle was good. It had a nice, moist, chocolaty flavor. But I would add just a little bit more sugar, everything else was delish. Thanks Chef John!

My ramekins were 9.5 oz, so I doubled the recipe and made 3 large individual souffles. Cooked for 14 minutes but was a little too wet. Great recipe!

This is a great recipe. I have never made Souffle before, and the step where you add a little less than half of the egg whites to the chocolate mix really helped to make the folding process easy without losing volume. Everyone enjoyed the sugar crust on the outside. I also added a mix of 4 parts sugar to 1 part cocoa powder sprinkled on top. It partially melted into the top  which added a nice sweetness but left a slight crunch.

I made these and they came out great! The only problem I had was being the messy person I am I accidently forgot to preheat the oven, which I'm pretty sure caused them to rise a little less, but they still tasted great.

This souffle was very delicious. I kept the cayenne, added strawberry extract, and dropped the tar tar. I've never made nor eaten a souffle before this, so I took this as a challenge from my wife. Made 3 separate batches to dial in the process. First one failed into a gelatinous mess, second really over cooked but I got a picture, but the third came out really well (sorry no pictures of this batch).

I made it and followed the recipe but made it for 4 people. It was my first time attempting souffle and it scaled up really nicely without issues. The souffles rose very nicely and were delicious. Next time I make them, I will use this recipe but maybe add some orange liqueur or make a raspberrry coulis to add to the flavour profile but the recipe itself was wonderful!

It was light and fluffy! Just the way I like it! It did make a little bit more than the recipe said. Maybe my ramekins were a bit smaller that the recipe called for.  But, I loved it, my family loved them too! Highly recommend for people  who love chocolate!  p.s. it was a lot easy to make than most souffles!

These came out perfectly! I’m planning to scale up to 6 soufflé, do you know if I should adjust baking time for this? Also, do you know if i can prepare the batter hours before baking? Will the batter last? Thank you!

Doubled the recipe, and put into five small ramikins instead of four. It bubbled up and was still soft and sticky at 12 minutes. I left them in for almost 25 minutes when I could visibly see the top edges getting darker than the rest. I like a difference in texture. I used salted butter so I didn't add any other salt. I also made a creme anglaise to go with it. Aaaamazing

I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled it and baked in a single 24 oz souffle dish for about 32 minutes, then portioned it out.  It was a delicious, warm, fluffy, chocolatey treat. I had never made a souffle before and I did watch the video first, just to be sure.  It turned out fantastic.

made no changes.  Delicious! 4 stars because mine were not so pretty - a bit lopsided.

Super easy and was really good but I think I baked it 2-4 mins  to long. Other then that  it's good!  going to try it again next time I'm going to take it out at 15 mins. Mine didn't rise over the edge that's what I was waiting for..

Making a Souffle isnt nearly as hard as I thought!  Made this on an impulse, was bored at home and already had everything needed.   Came out great!  I do need some real ramekins, the little bowls I have are shaped wrong but it still worked.  Love Chef Johns recipes, I've tried many of them and he's never let me down.  Thank you!

I loved the recipe and it came out perfect and i will keep making it. however there were some issues with the instruction steps with the egg whites so watch the video a few times before hand and layout all of your measured ingredients before you start and it will go well.  it is not as hard to make as people make it out to be but it is not a simple recipe, if you have never made something like this before give yourself an hour total time.

OMG! I can't believe I made a soufflé! This was really easy and absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe as stated. The only thing I would do next time is let my imagination run wild with flavors. I love the hint of heat from the cayenne. Yum! It was light and just the right amount for dessert. I can't wait to try it again!
