I've made this recipe for potlucks a few times and its ALWAYS a huge hit. My timesaver suggestion? I layer it in a 9x13 glass pyrex pan instead of making individual triangles. It cuts PERFECTLY into squares that are easily servable without falling apart. I brush the pan with melted butter, layer 3 sheets of phyllo with a little melted butter on each layer and spread half of the spinach filling. I place 3 more sheets of phyllo and butter, then the rest of the spinach mixture and another 3 sheets of phyllo on top. Use a knife to cut a few slits to allow steam to escape. This is SOOO much quicker than individual traingles if you dont have the time!

This is authentic Spanakopita, as you would find in any Greek household or restaurant in Athens. The other two recipes o this site are very poor imitations and adulterated. True spanakopita has NO cinnamon in it and certainly has no Swiss or other cheeses in it. Feta and Parmesan, used as a subsitute here for the Greek equivalent, are always used, and dill is also a must for authentic flavor. 
Bravo, Mary Kessler, and thanks for not making this "Mary's version" - true classics don't require silly additions or "improvements."

A poem about Spanakopita:
Filo dough is very picky,
If left out it will get brittle,
If it's wet it will get sticky,
This recipe is time-committal.
Leave a towel over dough,
in between all your folding,
Fold and fold and fold although,
your sanity is not upholding.
Preheating the oven in step one,
is a little premature,
and folding dough is not much fun,
with lots of effort you'll endure.
This recipe will win you smiles,
from your family and your friends,
but you will wonder if your trials,
were really worth it in the end.
So in short I recommend,
this recipe will turn out great,
but if your time you do misspend,
you'll tell your family: "Dinner's late."

This is the yummiest recipe.  I did add a splash of lemon, 1/3 cup parmesan reggiano, and 1/2 cup pine nuts.  

Hint:  To fold the dough into triangles:  Cut the sheets into lengthwise strips of about 4 1/2 by 8 inches.  Place a heaping tablespoon of spinach mixture in the center, and starting from the bottom, right-hand sid, fold flag-style.

Delicious spanakopita,  be sure to use good quality feta to get that sharp 'bite' these should have. I did add a little garlic and a bit of fresh lemon juice to  the mixture. I am giving this only 4 stars, not for the taste but for the directions. If one hasn't worked with phyllo, they would need more specific directions. Be sure to keep it covered with a damp cloth and only expose the sheets you are currently working with to the air. Otherwise they dry out and are impossible to fold, cracking and splitting. There are plenty of tips on the box and don't forget to allow for defrosting time!  I also feel that the baking time is off. The trianles that I baked fresh were done in about 20", nice golden brown with bubbly filling. I also froze some and those took closer to 45" to be done.  I doubled the recipe and took a platter to a baby shower and everyone enjoyed them.

The only reason why I didn't rate this five stars is because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used 1/3 of a cup of olive oil instead of veggie oil, only one onion (saut√©ed with 1 tsp of minced garlic), three eggs, added 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese, 1/4 tsp pepper (the feta is already somewhat salty), one package of Fillo brand phyllo dough (8 oz; it's already the appropriate size for a 9 x 13 pan), and about 1/4 cup of butter. I went for the layered spanakopita, with 10 sheets on phyllo on the top and bottom of the spanakopita and the spinach mixture sandwiched between (this is done by putting two sheets at a time in a buttered pan, brushing the top with butter, and adding two more sheets until you get 10 stacked sheets). Turned out great!

Thanks for the inspiration!

I used phyllo cups (in the frozen food section of the grocery store).  It makes it much faster to make and eliminates the need for the butter.  Me and my guests thought it had way too much spinach in it.  I would use half as much.  I added ricotta cheese to make it creamier.

I love the authenticity of the recipe, but not all of us have access to authentic ingredients. My grocery store had no phyllo so I had to use puff pastry. I cut the pastry into 3" squares and stretched the middle in order to get enough filling in, then folded them over and crimped the edges with a fork. Then I brushed the triangles with butter and sprinkled them with sesame seeds. In 45 minutes, they were beautifully browned flaky pastries, as delicious as they were pretty. People at the party I took them to asked me if I was a professional cook. Great recipe.

This was a great recipe.  My daughter who is 9 and son who is 5 loved it they kept sneaking it off the platter.  My company all adults asked for the recipe.  I would make this again.

This was the most flavorful Spanikopita that I've ever had.  You REALLY need to know how to use Phyllo Dough.  That was the only tricky part.
VERY TASTY!!

I have made thousands of these in a restaurant and eaten them in many other Greek restaurants.  I used much less onion, (Maybe half of this at the most) and other than cooking the onion, there was no other cooking of the filling involved.  And you can use about half of that oil or less.  Just cook the onion (Don't Brown it) then add it to the rest of the ingredients.  The frozen spinach is already cooked before it's packaged and the rest of the flavors meld together when it's cooked in the oven. Squeeze every last drop of water out of the spinach. 

Also, I would stack at least 2 layers of phyllo with butter before cutting it into strips.  The extra layer or two helps the very delicate sheets hold together while folding and give even more layers of crunch.  One stack of sheets would be cut into thirds lengthwise.  

Another tip is to clarify the butter.  When you melt the butter the water separates from the oil.  If you skim the butter off of the top or at least try to avoid dipping your brush into the water I find the triangles brown more evenly.  I used to make 2 or 3 packages of phyllo dough into triangles a night so I got pretty good at working with the stuff.  But I still find phyllo to be my least favorite ingredient I've ever worked with because of how bad it sticks sometimes.  It helps to let it thaw slowly in the refrigerator but sometimes it just wants to stick together no matter what you do.

Made this today and it was so good. My daughter and I ate 6 of them.  We are making and freezing them for Christmas but couldn't resist the temptation to try them. I used butter-flavored Pam Spray on half of one sheet lengthwise and then fold it lengthwise. then I fold the raw edge about half and inch.  then I add the filling. I found doing it this way makes the triangle stronger and also gets rid of the flaking edges. I brushed the top with olive oil on some and butter on some. of course the buttered is better tasting. That's what I'm bringing to the party.  Changes I made were to use two medium onions instead of large, based on reviews. I used only 2 eggs. Used 2 1/2 cups feta cheese. and I left out the dill bec we don't like dill.  My greek coworker suggested next time that I add 4 green onions to the mixture. I'm sure I'll be making this again and will try that.

These were delicious. This was the first time I had ever worked with phyllo and it was much simpler than I thought it would be. The pastry is delicate but very forgiving, and the directions for this recipe were well written and easy to follow. Simply lay plastic wrap over the sheets you are not working with and they stay moist and cooperative. This wasn't nearly as time consuming as I expected either. Once you get into a rhythm, the folding is fast. Tip; if you have no fresh dill, the conversion is 2 teaspoons dried dill. I used dried as I could not find fresh. Thanks for this great recipe!

We love this recipe! I have traveled to Greece and this recipe tastes pretty authentic! Phyllo doesn't have to be intimidating. Just handle with gentle hands. If you use butter, lay sheets vertically and brush butter gently horizontally. A shortcut, which makes it less fattening and phyllo even easier to handle is spraying the sheets with butter flavored cooking spray. We've done it both ways and this spanakopita comes out great either way! My daughter is quite the picky eater and I don't know if it is because it is a fun shape or what, but getting her to eat spinach is worth the effort of this recipe!

My fiance is Greek and he makes an awesome Spanakopita.  I was visiting my mom and wanted to try to make some decent Spanakopita without his help.  I found this recipe and it is extremely similar to his.  Very authentic.  I made these for a party and they turned out EXCELLENT!!  I added extra feta.  I prefer my Spanakopita with extra cheese! =)  Also, the only thing that this recipe is missing is the fresh garlic.  It's a must for any good Spanakopita.  Chop, slice, or press a few cloves of garlic and add to the onions when you saute them.  It makes for a much better flavor.  Greeks LOVE garlic!  Swap the vegetable oil for olive oil.  Much better.  Make sure you squeeze the spinach as dry as you possibly can.  Too much moisture can cause mushiness.  Make these changes and this is an awesome, authentic recipe that would make any Greek proud! Thanks Mary!! =)

Phyllo dough is really fussy so to make my life a little bit easier (and as recommended by another reviewer), I opted to layer the phyllo and spinach mixture.

this is the real deal folks....no parmesan, no (yikes) ricotta HELLO this is Greek cuisine, not italian.  I have read of a bit of nutmeg in a Greek recipe book also, and bump up the dill (fresh is best) just a bit.  I am making this for a party and I can't find my tried and true recipe...guess what- this is pretty close to the one a Greek restaurant owner gave me 20 years ago.  Freeze the triangles on waxed paper and cook when you need to for a party, they come up beautifully.

My Greek mother makes spanakopita with these changes:  3 10-oz. bags fresh spinach, 1 bunch fresh dill, 5 bunches of green onions (instead of white), 1 pound of crumbled feta and 3/4 cup parmesan (no additional salt needed).  Use a rimmed cookie sheet and butter 1/2 of a pkg. a phyllo dough and put in the pan.  Then add the spinach filling, then butter of other 1/2 of dough.  Cut into squares or triangles and bake.  The fresh ingredients really make it delicious!

Hot and crispy spanakopita. I love the fresh dill.    Athens Filo dough comes in 9"x14" sheets, ~40 per 1# box. These are perfect for cutting into 3"x14" strips. Recipe uses up almost 1 box, not the 1-1/2 boxes as called for. There were 4 sheets left over. Follow directions on box for handling filo dough.     Recipe uses less than 2 sticks of butter, not the 3 sticks called for.  Remelt the butter if it solidifies.     We ended up with 54, 3"x3"x4.25" triangles.    I baked one sheet of 18 spanakopita and froze the rest for baking later.  I baked them at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes. Frozen will probably need to bake longer.     We will definitely make this again. My husband promptly ate six, hot out of the oven.

OOOOHHHHH, total taste sensation! I'm on a phyllo dough kick now that I've finally started using it. I did add some ricotta to cream it up a bit, cut the eggs back by two and skipped the flour. I made a couple of these for my lunch today and plan on using the rest for some appetizers tonight. Delicious Mary!!!!

Great without any changes! They re-heated very nicely the second day in the oven without getting soggy.

I am part greek and though this recipe is similiar to my moms there are a few changes we would make; #1-change the veg oil for a better quality cold pressed olive oil.#2-as all Greeks know be sure to add plenty of sauteed garlic with one whole onion diced.#3-use fresh spinach that is wilted in the pan of sauteed onion/garlic. #4-omit the eggs.#5-when mixing ingrediants be sure to add 4-6 sprigs of fresh thyme.#6-my idea-mom hated it but instead of brushing on melted butter I spray butter flavoered Pam no-stick spray.This cuts out SOmany caleries and I prefer my Spanakopeda to not be greasy.#7-brush tops with stirred egg white and use egg-white to seal phyllo parcels.This is a good Base recipe kind of.

Exellent job Mary! This is the best recipe I've seen for authentic Greek Spanakopita :)! I agree with THELASTBARON 100% about not using other cheeses and most definitely NO cinnamon! I would like to add though that being Greek and being around my family who makes this all the time, we also add a bunch of green onion, this adds to the flavour and gives it the extra sweetness! Once again high five to Mary for a true Greek pita :)! Ty!

I have been in love with the Spanakopita that a local place serves, and couldn't wait to try this recipe! So good!! Did make a few changes though. Used fresh spinach and sauteed it with one onion and a teaspoon of garlic. Added an extra container of feta cheese, and a handful of parmesan cheese. I omitted the extra salt and glad I did so because the feta is salty enough, and only used 2 eggs. Turned out perfect!!

Spanakopita is a favorite dish in my family and this is a very traditional recipe. The only changes I would make would be to use olive oil rather than vegetable oil and in my family, we will also add lightly toasted pine nuts which gives you the nice, nutty texture now and then, as well as a lovely marrying of flavors with the other ingredients. Also, another review may have mentioned it, though I have not read through all of them, but when working with phyllo, it is best to use a slightly damp towel to cover the dough. The directions state to use the plastic but I would fear that it would still dry out too much. Phyllo is a bit time intensive and temperamental to assemble, but it's well worth it in the end. Bravo!

This recipe is AWESOME!!  Exactly what I was looking for.  There is absolutely nothing that needs to be added to the recipe.  However, I did cut back on the butter.  3/4 pound??  Who uses that much butter on these??  They don't need to be drenched!  I used a total of probably 5 or 6 Tablespoons of butter and that was plenty.  And like another reviewer, I also cut back on the eggs, from 4 to 2.  Overall, the flavor is awesome.  It takes some time to fold up these guys, but it's worth it.  I'm planning to whip up another batch and freeze them to have on hand.
Oh and about the folding: Use one sheet of phyllo dough at a time.  Put the filling on one side in the middle.  Fold both sides over and then "roll" up into a triangle, one sheet of phyllo per spanakopita.  You only really need 1 pack of the 16 oz phyllo dough, the ones that have two bags in them.

How yummy were these?  My boyfriend wanted spanakopita for his bday dinner, so I made these little appetizers.  Only used about half an onion and did leave out the dill, but they were still fabulous.  To fold into triangles, fold them like a flag.  I didn't know how to do this, so I googled 'how to fold a flag' and folded my phyllo like this.  Great recipe

Phyllo pastry was not as difficult to work with as some reviewers made it to be. We definitely did not make 27 triangles, but perhaps we stuffed our triangles too full! Very filling and very delicious - 45 min was perfect, but waiting for them to cool enough to eat them was torture!

I changed a few things, I cooked some chopped chicken breast with olive oil onion and garlic and oregano.  Put half the onion with some shallot and half grn onion and chives and black forest ham with the spinach and put blk pepper feta with one500lite cottage cheese with the eggs and fresh dill plus a tiny bit of fresh oregano.  Even baby said it smelled good. a miracle. 8 or 9 layer melted butter and olive oil each then mixture then 8 more with lemon juice squeezed around top and edges.  cooked 50 min 350 on parchment paper in ceramic dish.Make slits all over for steam to escape.

Spanakopita is one of my FAVORITE foods.  This was by far the best recipe I found.  It is a little time consuming and a little bit of work, but totally worth it!  So if you are in the mood for some hands-on cooking and an extremely rewarding meal, this is it!

After reading all the reviews this is what I did.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil to cook the onions, before adding the onions, I minced 2 garlic cloves and sauted them.  I actually forgot to add the fresh dill.  I omitted the flour.  I used 3/4 lb of fresh spinach,steamed it,chopped it up and added it to the onions and garlic.  I only used 3 eggs. To the feta cheese mixture, I added about 2 tbsp of fresh lemon juice. These were so easy to assemble.  Just a note to not worry about figuring out how to fold them.  On the box of Phyllo are all the ways you can bake with phyllo and it clearly states how to make the triangles.  Also I didn't use 3/4 lb of butter...I used about 1/4 lb. for the whole batch!  I cooked these for about 20 minutes `When my company ate these last night - they said "these are as good as..pardon me...even BETTER than that restaurant! In other words...a real hit!!!

I made this recipe yesterday and although it was time consuming, I would do it again.
Here's my tip for folding the triangles. First, butter 2 sheets of Phylo dough and put them on top of each other. Then,cut the sheets into six strips . Use a pizza cutter, it works great. Put a little bit of your filling in the corner of the strip and fold into rectangles until the strip is all used up. I think the trick is to use 2 sheets so that the dough doesn't break. Make sure, you have a wet towel over the remainder of the dough so that it doesn't dry.
Hopr that helps!

Really, really good and easy to make.  I did find it a little bit dry though, next time I make this (and there WILL be a next time) I'll omit the flour.  I also baked it for only 30 minutes instead of the recommended 45.

My guests really enjoyed this appetizer. The feta cheese is pretty salty so next time I'll omit adding any extra salt to the spinach mixture.

These were so much better than any frozen kind. It was a bit tedious to make since I had not used phyllo before but once I got all set up and started getting the hang of it, it went faster. Will make again and freeze half to have my own homemade spanakopita  whenever I want! :)

A lot better and easier than I thought it would be. Thanks to the reviewer who outlined how to lay down the phyllo sheets in a dish (I opted to make this in a glass dish instead of making little triangles). It turned out flaky and delicious with a surprisingly tasty filling. I'd probably add a little more salt or maybe substitute a flavored feta (like garlic and herb) instead of using the plain. I also added about 2 tsp minced garlic to the onions. Used dried dill because I didn't have fresh on hand. Made half the recipe and this worked really well in an 8 x 8 inch dish. Thanks for this one - easy, tasty, impressive. Will definitely make again.

Perfection!  I wouldn't change anything about this recipe!  Phyllo is a pain to work with, but worth the suffering.  I simply waited until everything else was ready, only then did I open the phyllo which made it easier to work with as it didn't have time to dry out.

I gave this a 5 because it's so nearly perfect it'd be unfair to give it less, but there are a few things I do differently when I make spankopita: -I use fresh spinach (4 bunches, about 3lbs before I remove the stems, about 2lbs after)  -I wilt spinach in olive oil, one bunch worth at a time, then set aside to cool while I do the rest. Once the spinach is cooled, I squeeze out all the remaining liquid and chop it fine. A tip I picked up online: Chop in about 1/3c cooked rice (I use brown) to absorb the moisture as it cooks, I do this instead of flour, you'll never know it's there.  -Meanwhile, I sweat only about a cup of chopped onion (my preference) with a few minced cloves of garlic in a little bit of butter, and mix that into the spinach/rice.  -I use about 2.5tsp dried dill (fresh is ridiculously expensive around here), and mix it (along with salt and pepper) into the eggs, to ensure it's as evenly distributed as possible when I mix it into the spinach. I adjust salt and pepper afterwards, if needed. -At the same time I mix in about 2tsp-1tbsp lemon juice to help cut the richness just a little, but if you can taste lemon, you've added too much.  -I use clarified butter on the phyllo so there's less moisture, and it comes out flakier. But there have been times I haven't had any clarified butter around (it keeps for ages, so it's easy to store), and used regular. I'll admit the difference is probably only in my head.

This is my standard recipe that I go to every time I need an appetizer.  The flavor in this is outstanding especially with some tzadziki sauce.  (and yes, I know my spelling is off on that).  Work fast with the phyllo.  It will dry out faster than you think.

Delicious! Quick tips: I used a pizza cutter to make the strips of phyllo. I only used one package of phyllo, which made 36 tarts. I only ended up using about a cup of butter. I made it just like the recipe says, but it would also be good with a little ricotta or some chopped artichoke hearts. This was a dry filling, not a creamy one, but it was very tasty. I am a fan! Thanks!

I found these to be pretty eggy, and not as cheesy as I am accustomed to. However, I will be trying this again (with less egg and more cheese) because it is so close to the taste of the ones I miss from the restaurants in my hometown.

These were terrific. I made a half batch but kept the cheese the same amount. They took a long time to roll out, it was my first time working with phyllo, and I was thinking that they weren't worth the time...until I ate one! I will definitley make them again.

Absolutely delicious! I use just a bit of oil in the filling and add extra feta. I've never found that I needed the flour, but I add it anyway. I use olive oil mixed with a bit of melted butter for brushing the pastry. I always have leftover oil/butter at the end. I put lots of filling (bunching it into a triangle before wrapping) and end up with only 14-19 pastries. I don't find the phyllo that difficult to work with if I move quickly. I keep the unused phyllo covered with a slightly damp cloth and use one sheet of phyllo per pastry, folding the sheet in half before adding the filling and wrapping it up like a flag. I don't worry too much about tearing the phyllo or making it look nice - they all end up looking pretty good once they're baked. This recipe takes me just over an hour plus baking time. They usually only need 20 minutes in the oven.

I have not tried the recipe yet, but will tonight.  I just happened to notice that the directions do not say to cut the phyllo into strips before folding (like a flag).  I assume that's how you do it?  I just can't imagine some poor soul trying to fold an entire sheet up into a spanakopita!

Amazing!  I was trying to replicate the spanakopita I'd had in a Greek restaurant, and I think I even liked this better.  Even my Greek friend said it tasted very good.  I used less onion than called for, added a bit of parmesan, and sprayed the phyllo with olive oil cooking spray.  To make the triangles, I layered 3 sheets, spraying between each, and then cut them lengthwise into 3-inch strips with kitchen shears before rolling the strips football-style.  I didn't have much trouble with it, really--though it is time-consuming. :)

These turned out great! I think they are just rich enough as is. I would have given this 5 stars but the cooking time should be more like 30 minutes and the prep time was more like 1 hour.

These were wonderful! I prepared them (wrapped them up but didn't cook them) and stored them in the freezer. Took them out when we needed them and put them straight in the oven at 350 for an hour and they were perfect! This also makes it really convenient to choose how many you want to bake right then, and put the rest away for another day. One substitution I used was 1 tbs of dried dill instead of 2 tbs of fresh, but only because I didn't have any fresh on hand. A great vegetarian recipe, thanks a lot!

This recipe is AMAZING! I made it in a glass pan instead of making individual ones as one member suggested and it was so easy. I also used cooking spray instead of butter between layers to cut calories and this worked well too.

This recipie is sooo good! My whole family is always pleading for me to make more. I do change one thing and that is that I double the feta cheese. I found that when I didnt it was more spinach than I liked. It is really easy to make although it is very time consuming, although I think its worth every minute

I used to make these years ago when my kids were small.  I'd make them to go with dinner and then we would snack on the rest.  Out west was no problem fnding the philo, but I'm finding here on the southern east coast, people don't know what it is. My mouth waters just thinking of these!  I might try the puff pastry as noted on here!  What a great idea!

I would recommend using butter just on the outside and not between layers. It was to much. The spinach mixture is phenomenal.

These are fantastic! My only complaint is that you really do not need to season with salt because the feta is so salty, as a result mine was a little too salty but I still loved it.

This recipe is so wonderful! I put in a dash of nutmeg with the dill and flour - I think it really makes a difference. I also use two sheets, then cut them into strips. Watch the 'how to' video for the confidence needed to tackle the phyllo dough. They are very easy once you make them the first time. I can cook the filling and stuff and fold them in about an hour. I do cut the sheets up into four strips to make four per two sheets for appetizers, or two big ones per two sheets if they are a main dish served with a greek salad. I now have made them five times, and they are always popular and my boyfriend always begs me to make extra!

I think I hate this recipe more than I've ever hated a recipe. I guess phyllo dough is not for me. It was so tedious that I got upset and my boyfriend had to finish making it for me. Plus the corners make the filling hard and burned. Awful.

Pretty good!  Compiled other reviewers advice & added about 3 cloves of crushed garlic & about 1 T lemon juice.  Didn't have enough feta cheese, so I added some grated parmesan - it worked just fine.  I didn't have the patience to make triangles, so I made little Greek cabbage rolls!  All in all, a good appetizer recipe!

Excellent. Added more feta cheese than this recipe called for though, and a tad more dill too. Season all salt instead of regular salt for more flavor. So easy to make and looks/tastes delicious!

This was a perfect recipe. I recieived rave reviews. It is going to be one of my staple dinner recipes. Quick and simple.
I used the quantities for 27 servings, but ......
layered in a 9x13 baking dish and baked for about 35 minutes. rather than butter, I sprayed the layers of phyllo with a cooking spray. this really cuts the calories and fat. this is better than our local Greek places serve.
Don't remember when I added this review... But here we are 2014 and still loving this recipe. So does everyone who has it. Just finished throwing it in the oven, it took about 20 min to put it together. I have quit browning the onions and mix them in raw with the other ingredients. Can hardly wait to eat..... serving it with pork skewers.

This is the best ever!!! I was craving these & usually I get the frozen store bought, but screw THAT from now on.  The only thing I did different was use green onions since the recipe would be more authentic that way.  I made them huge because they were all for me & I also used dried dill because I froze some & when I bake them the dill will become brighter. I've never worked feta before other than in this dish & now, I will eat &/or work with it without any problem.

Mary, thank you for curing me of my fear of working with phyllo sheets. I had some left over from cooking these & I made dessert. This is the best, did I say that already?

This is the first time I've thought highly enough of a recipe to bother giving a rating.  I made this recipe for company and it could not have turned out better.  I love Greek food and this was as good as I've ever had in a restaurant.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.

I absolutely loved the filling. It was hard to keep from eating it my itself.  I added some parmesan simply because I like it. Because I am a lazy chef, instead of layering the 2 sheets of phyllo, I simply folded each in half lengthwise after buttering it, then started the flag style folding. Works well, and you won't have to worry about ending up with an odd number of phyllo sheets. I'd heard using cooking spray instead of butter works well enough for people trying to watch their diets. I tried that on the last few. The results were impressive enough.  After all, the filling is the star here.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I really didn't care for the use of the  phyllo dough in this recipe. I found the dough to be dry and very messy, however the spinach part was awesome so what I did was slice a loaf of french bread, drizzled it with evoo, baked till crunchy and just use it as a bread dip. Everyone loved it and thats the way I will make it from now on. Nice recipe, Thank you

Very tasty, though time consuming to make.  I froze half the batch and they still tasted great two weeks later.  I also made miniture triangles out of mine to be served as appetizers.

This is an interesting take on spanakopita and certainly more authentic than thee other two here, however, if you want true authenticity, use olive oil instead of the butter (better for you, anyway) and the only cheese should be feta.  If you don't care about authenticity, though, this is a very good recipe.

I was worried about these as I was making them because it's pretty labor-intensive to wrap them, and I just couldn't get them to come out as triangles. So I ended up with little hockey-puck shapes. I froze them overnight and made them the next day for a party. They cooked up perfectly and I got great reviews from the guests! The filling is awesome. I recommend cutting the phyllo sheets into four strips and using all four strips per apptizer to help keep them from breaking (and also to give it a good dough-to-filling ratio). I'll definitely be making these again!!

This may be the tastiest spanikopita I've ever had. The mixture was a little wet for using just one phyllo sheet per triangle. Next time I might use 2 sheets per triangle. The only modifications:  I added 2 minced cloves of garlic to the mix, and 2 tbsp of chopped basil alongside with the dill. Simply amazing.

I wanted to make larger triangles to have as a nice main course with a side salad.  Took a little getting used to on rolling them up but let me give you my advice.....I took 4 to 5 sheets stacked on top of each other. I buttered the top layer then placed about 1/2 cup of the mixture onto one end and just started folding it till it kinda made a triange...each time I folded it over, I place a tiny amount of butter on top, then buttered the top of the completed triangle.  I also rolled them to make a rectangle and that worked out well too. It made about 12 of them!  Either way you roll em, they are yummy yummmy!!!!!.........PS...to get all the water out of the spinich, take a bunch of paper towels and place the spinich into it and squeeze the heck out of it. Make sure you're over the sink when you do it and be careful if the spinich is hot!

Great recipe.  Made with fresh spinach, and had to really cut down on flour.  also, to fold into triangles, you should use 3-4 layers of phyllo

The filling is delicious.  I added a couple tablespoons of Parmesan cheese.   The problem I had was the assembly, trying the 3" wide with various lengths and filling amounts.   The best ones were 1 tbsp filling with 3 x 3 1/2 inch squares.

This was absolutely awesome.  I of course did thing differently but it was right on the money for a wonderful spanakopita.  I did this in a 13x9 pan instead of individual portions.  It layers wonderfully and cooks up like a dream.  I would add more dill next time (I had to use dried and not fresh - and more would be fine).  I added more cheese because that's just what we do in our family and I found that the feta cheese is a bit salty, so the original amount of cheese is fine.  I hope I can find a lower salt feta so I can keep the cheese level up there.  Fresh spinach is awesome in this - much better than frozen or canned or anything else.  All in all, this is a great recipe to start from (or actually follow).

Very yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly and followed the advice of other posters adding one minced garlic clove and a good splash of lemon juice at the end.  I didn't have enough frozen spinach but happened to have some frozen beet tops from my garden, so i used them!  They turned out awesome!  My husband even commented that he thought they weren't "overwhelmingly spinachy", I think I know what he means...haha!  I will definitely make these again...with a mix of spinach/beet tops!

This recipe has become a staple. The freezer is no longer complete without a batch of it. I love having it ready for unexpected company, for a guaranteed hit at a potluck, or just a special dinner for the two of us. I make the pastries larger and use one as part of a main dish. I take one sheet, put butter on half, fold over, Put butter on half, fold again. I use more filling. I usually add a bit more after the first fold.  Ah, the thrill of having mastered the triangle! My sincere thanks for this. 

This recipe also helps to use the glut of frozen leafy garden greens. It works with swiss chard, or half chard and half kale. You may have to simmer a bit longer.

This is a great recipe, very reminiscent of what I ate in Greece.  I only do two things differently - I add a tiny bit of lemon juice to the vegetable mixture and I also use fresh baby spinach because I think the frozen kind is gross.  I made it in a jelly roll pan, spread thin with the phyllo and then cut into squares, it was thin and delicious.   I only did it that way because I had doubled the recipe for a party and didn't have the time to make all the triangles.  Awesome recipe.

great!!  the dill makes the difference... I love the idea someone had about phyllo cups and will try next time.  I did it as a casserole (the triangles daunted me).  That worked out fine, but still fussing with phyllo is the hardest part of the recipe..

Marvelous! i just made a few changes. First i did the recipe on half and made mini pitas this made about 30...instead of frying the onions with oil i used Pam, and I also used Pam instead of butter.  I took three sheets of phyllo dough spraying Pam in between each sheet. Than cut the dough in thirds...putting the mixture on the dough and rolled into triangles. Spray Pam to keep edges together and to keep pitas from falling apart.   If you have extra dough grate some apples with cinnamon and a bit sugar and do the same process.

I made the easy/cheating version of this.  I had a sheet of puff pastry that needed to be used so I mixed the filling, put it into a casserole dish, and layered the puff pastry on top.  It was delicious.  I cut the eggs in half because all I had were extra large and it just seemed like it might be too much.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and only used about a tablespoon because I do not like my food very greasy.  Also, I used dried dill instead of fresh, though I'm sure fresh would make it even better.  Very tasty!

This was a good recipe. 4 stars only becase I made changes. I used 2 eggs and NO oil, (I used only about a tablespoon to saute garlic/onion) No flour, I aslo added a 12 oz container of cottage cheese. Saute garlic & onion in olive oil. Mix into spinach (I squeeze dry in a paper towel). Beat eggs add Cottage cheese, mix add feta. Mix cheese mixture with spinach mixture. Use a rubber scraper to get onions mixed in well. start by brushing pan with melted butter, add a sheet of phyllo dough, build from there. Reserve about 6-8 sheets of dough for top. Slice on a diagonal about 1/2 way through, prior to baking. 40 mins should be perfect~

We made this for Thanksgiving yesterday and it was wonderful!  Took the advice of a previous reviewer and replaced the flour with 1/3 cup brown rice medley (from TJs),  used garlic and herb feta along with basic feta cheese. This is a time consuming recipe and I needed my husband to help assemble (to keep the phyllo dough covered yet make it quick enough so it wouldn't dry out).  How do people do this by themselves?  Great, great recipe and a treat for my family.

This recipe was excellent! Exactly like Spanakopita in good Greek restaurants. It really impressed my husband, and he is not easy to impress! I followed the recipe exactly. One thing I think I will do next time is coat the outside with more olive oil; the phyllo was a little too flaky and I prefer an oiler crust. The best thing about this recipe is how well it freezes. I made a huge batch and froze them. Just pop the frozen triangles in the oven and heat at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. They turn out great. Also, the video was helpful to me as a first time phyllo user.

*TIP* Use butter flavored nonstick cooking spray instead of brushing melted butter over each phyllo sheet - it makes the process much more simple. Great authentic taste. My hubby loves them and they are perfect for entertaining.

Excellent recipe.  I added a hint of lemon juice as well.  Something I've learned with cheese fillings, though,--especially when it says "salt and pepper to taste"--is to scoop out a teaspoon or so and microwave it for 5ish seconds and taste it.  You get a much better idea of the cooked filling's seasoning and are able to adjust it BEFORE it's already rolled/ folded/ layered/ baked... and too late.  Thanks for a great recipe!

WATCH THE VIDEO! Not only will you yield more than 60 with the ingredients listed in the recipe, it also makes the process so much easier.

Before putting then in the oven, I put a bit of butter on the top and then some sesame seeds. They looks beautiful and taste delicious.

WATCH THE VIDEO!

Absolutely FANTASTIC! The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the directions are a little unclear and off. Cooking time was only 25 minutes - and I had a lot of extra phyllo dough. You only need ONE 16 ounce package. 

Only a few small tweaks. Used dill spice instead of fresh. Added a dash of nutmeg to the spinach mixture and used clarified butter. 

Cut phyllo sheets in quarters - and used 2 layers to roll one. Perfect appetizer size. Yum! I hope they are just as good leftover! 

Watch the video, it is really helpful!

These were a Thanksgiving sensation, and were very easy to make.  I froze the filling ahead of time and made them immediately before guests arrived.  Very good!

SO GOOD! This actually tasted better than the spanakopita I get in our local restaurant. The filling is SO delicious, but I HATE working with phyllo dough (not a fault of the recipe). I may try this recipe with puff pastry, or even the phyllo dough little shells. But the filling is DEFINITELY a keeper. (Oh yeah, I did NOT use the dill, because I didn't think it fit.)

Absolutely delicious!  Time consuming, yes, but worth the effort.  I would recommend scaling the onion down a bit - otherwise great recipe.  Also, I use one entire sheet of phyllo per triangle- so the triangle holds together better than using a 1/3 sheet of phyllo.

With the alterations I made, this turned out five stars, but I felt the amount of onion was far too much.  I used half a sweet onion.  I also added half of a wedge of Parmesan and a couple of spoonfuls of ricotta.  With the phyllo, I cut the sheets in half, then layered them, buttering each sheet, the inside of the last fold to make it stick better, and both sides when it was completely folded.  I got about 40 out of a double batch, but I stuffed them pretty full to use as a side as opposed to appetizers.  It went over well at the meeting I served it at - some even took extras back to their employees!  I served this as a side to the souvlaki  on this site.

I cut this recipe in half, added garlic, and used herbed feta cheese instead of plain.  I also spiced up the mixture with some cayenne and a pinch of nutmeg which is so great in most spinach dishes.  I think the best way to do the phyllo is to cut the dough into 2 x 8 inch strips, place a small amount in the bottom righthand corner and then just fold it over and over again.  This is very tasty and once you get the folding down it's very easy to put together.

I grew up with a Greek family as neighbors and this is the closest recipe that I have found that compares with their authentic recipe.  I followed this recipe to the "T" with the inclusion of the juice of 1/2 lemon and a dash of fresh lemon zest.  This is a party favorite every time.  Flaky and buttery on the outside and moist on the inside...delish!  It's truly a labor of love, but SOOOOOO worth it!

I have never worked with phyllo before, so I was excited and scared.  Once we figured out exactly how to do it, it went quite well.  My mom and I made a few testers to get it just right and then we went to town folding our little triangles.  It was a lot of work, but I think they taste fantastic and am excited to serve them at my upcoming party.  

One note I did find the baking time to be really off. We baked our for about ten minutes (with three layers of phyllo) and they were hot, and golden brown.

This is an excellent recipe!!! I made these for a Oscar Awards party for an appetizer and the whole party couldn't stop talking about them. I made the spinach with feta spanakopitas and then I came up with my own recipe with meat. I bought lean ground beef from the store. I sauteed onions in vegetable oil and then added the ground beef. I then added one packet of Lipton Onion Soup to flavor the meat. I recommend this recipe to somebody that can by patient with the phyllo dough. It is worth all the work!!!

I made this recipe and think this is the best spanakopita recipe on this site.   I made this recipe in a 9 x 13 pan instead of making individual triangles. I chose to use a few extra sheets of phyllo for each layer and I brushed each sheet with butter.  I pre cut into small square s before baking. I can't wait to make this again.

Turned out fantastic. We used two bags of freshly chopped spinach and it worked fine.

Anytime you use phyllo make sure to thaw it long enough... & the triangle shape works great for holding together. If you don't work with the phyllo right, you'll end up swearing it off forever.

I follow this recipe as written.  These are easy to make, they taste fantastic and the triangles look beautiful.  I have tried them with light feta and the decreased sodium content does leave them a bit bland so I prefer using regular feta in this recipe

Oh. My. Stars.  I made this just as the recipe directed, and I am in HEAVEN!  I forgot to thaw my phyllo dough, so I zapped it for 30 seconds at 50% power in the microwave, which thawed it just enough. Don't be afraid of the phyllo dough!  Do a quick search if you're unfamiliar with how to handle it, and you'll be fine! I did an extra layer of butter on the top of the dough before filling/folding (mostly because... butter).  The only problem is the self-control I'm going to have to muster to save a few for my husband.

I did alter the recipe slightly.  I combined this with a friend's scaled-down version of what he uses in his catering business. I added about 2 cups of thinly sliced crimini mushrooms, upped the feta to 16 ounces, crumbled (buy the block/chunk feta rather than buying pre-crumbled.  It's more moist.)  I also added two cloves of minced garlic and about 1 to 1-1/2 tsp dried rosemary (I prefer fresh, but my bush died.)  The two tips I would offer are:  DON'T CUT THE PHYLLO!!!  It's so prone to tearing as-is, trying to cut it just aggravates this.  Instead, I buter about 1/2 of the sheet, then fold it on top of itself lengthwise.  It works out just the same as if you cut it in half, then layered it.  On some of them I used just one sheet of phyllo (two layers) and on others, I layered one sheet on top of another, then folded it onto itself, for a total of 4 layers. (I added slightly more filling to these.)  I still haven't been able to figure out which way I prefer it.  I think with the larger layers & more filling.  Another suggestion is to shape it into rolls, rather than triangles -- less fussing.  Next batch, I freeze, to see how well they turn out!  I can definitely see adding these to my entertaining collection.

Great recipe. This is definitely my go-to dish for pot lucks and parties. I always add a bit more dill, because I really like dill. I also make it in a big pan rather that individual servings. As long as you thoroughly coat both sides of each sheet of dough with butter it comes out great!

The spinach and feta stuffing is very tasty. I liked the dill undertones. I constructed this in a 9x13 baking dish using an 8 oz package of phyllo dough sheets. This seemed to save time, though the result was somewhat soggy (yet tasty). Next time, if I can set aside more time, I plan to try to make the triangles as recommended by the recipe.

This is a great recipe!  Phyllo is easy to use - once you have done it.  The flavor and the ingredients are great so even if the first ones don't look perfect they will taste good and the more you fold the easier it gets.

I used this recipe but used 6 oz feta, 6 oz swiss and 6 oz parmesean.... Absolutely wonderful!!.  Increased the spinach to 3 pkgs..  If you have Phyllo dough that comes in about a 12 " sheet. just cut in in half and now you can use 1 (or 2) sheets per tablespoon of filling and it makes it easier to handle and faster. Just fold and brush with butter.

Fabulous recipe! I added a couple cloves of garlic and made them the night before I needed them, put them in the freezer overnight and thawed and baked the next day and they turned out great!

I've made this dish multiple time over the past 2 or 3 years and my family loves it. It is a little time consuming putting the mix on the phyllo dough and folding it up but soooo worth it!

This recipe was so good and so easy to do. The dill sets the flavor and mixes so well with the spinach and feta. Will be making these again and again. I will never need another Spanakopita recipe ever. Thanks Mary!

My husband makes these for us frequently - and they are so delicious!  We have this recipe bookmarked and they never last long at our house.  A great lunch item.  Props to the husband of the house!

These were really time consuming, but in my opinion worth the effort. The only thing I would change is seasoning; I minced garlic and added it to the softened onions and continued to sautee' them until they started to brown 30-60 seconds. Don't be afraid to add the salt & pepper, because you'll need it. I used goats cheese instead of the feta and they turned out wonderfully. These were Sooo good!

Tidy, yummy, and very satisfying. I didn't have dill but it was still very delicious. I used some good quality feta and quite a bit of pepper. Can't wait to try it again with the fresh dill. Worth the effort! Best if you can get a helper for assembly,  so the dough doesn't dry out.

This seems very authentic. But, it's not what I'm used to, so I didn't care for it very much. I didn't think it had enough cheese in it, and the phyllo was like eating parchment paper. If you were raised with this though, I'm sure it's wonderful. If you want to be adventurous, give it a try. :)

very good. only used 2 eggs after reading the reviews and used some more salt and olive oil and left the dill out b/c I didn't have any. I made a square pie versus the triangles to save some time on the prep.

AMAZING! Fresh dill a must. I didn't make triangles - I just baked it in an 8 x 8 following other reviewers advice. I have made it without the dough as well - kind of like a spinach casserole. This was only because we were tight on our food budget otherwise definitely prefer the phyllo dough. It is not too difficult to work with.

Excellent recipe! Tried these for Thanksgiving and they were a hit. Perhaps it was because I was a novice, but 30 mins prep (as the recipe instructed) was way off. I spent almost 2 hours folding the phyllo. (That could have been because I like my triangles really bitesize.) But it was well worth it in the end and I will be making these again. They were delish!

These were very good- similar to those from a Middle Eastern restaraunt I used to work at.  I added lemon juice to my spinach mixture and REALLY stuffed each triangle with the spinach.  Consequently, I had leftover phyllo dough at the end of the recipe.

Great! First time using phyllo and it was a little challenging but well worth it. I used 2 eggs instead of 4, 1 large onion instead of 2, sauteed some garlic with it and included some parm cheese as well.

These are restaurant-quality or better.  Worth the effort.  I read all the reviews and incorporated a lot of the tips given that I thought would work well for me in regard to the rolling and the flavor.  I did the 1-sheet, fold-in-half, then fold into flags technique and I also did the egg-roll style with 1-sheet.  I used butter flavored Pam spray.  I also used only 2 eggs, added a bit of garlic, lemon juice and nutmeg.  The filling just needs to be tweaked to your liking.  That said.....LOVED THEM!!!!!

It was well received, but I thought it would be better with more feta.  Good tasting as is though!  I only had to cook mine for 25 minutes (in triangle form).

My daughter had to make Greek food for a school project and I thought, even though I know it's not the traditional preparation, individual servings would be good.  In theory, it is.  However, unless you are experienced at working with phyllo dough, the prep time is MUCH longer than 30 minutes.  It took me well over an hour just to roll up the triangles.  The flavor was pretty good.  I agree with some others who said there was too much dill.  I also think I would use less onion (maybe one large) and maybe more spinach.  One last tip I got from a friend with a Greek wife (after I had already made them) - cut the feta with cottage cheese.

The recipe isn't clear on working with the phyllo dough, although you can consult the box for instructions.  To make the triangles I made one by taking a sheet and buttering half long-wise, then folded the sheet over.  Then I folded it into triangles.  I also made them smaller by cutting the sheet in half long-wise first and then following the same method as above with each half sheet. The small size would be perfect for appetizers.  Note that 4 oz feta is 1 cup. The phyllo bakes quickly so I only cooked the pastries for 20 minutes.  I think that I dried my spinach too much before cooking it.  It would have become more tender in the frying pan with more moisture.

These were amazing!  I used a little more dill than called for and one less egg.  I hate when I order these out and they taste too much like eggs.  The flavour was amazing!  Make sure to watch the instructional video if you've never used phyllo!  Also make sure you squeeze all the excess moisture out of the spinach!  These smoked a bit in the oven when I cooked them from fresh due to all the butter but they didn't smoke nearly as much and turned out better when cooked from frozen.  Excellent crowd pleaser or just to pull out of the freezer and into the oven anytime!

Watch the video on how to make this, there's a link at the end of the recipe. My phyllo sheets were way too big, I did not cut them enough so the triangles were very big. Next time I will cut them into fourths to make them appetizer size. Filling was yummy, when I added the cheese and egg though it was too wet so I turned the heat back on to cook the egg a bit. I used a 10 oz bag of fresh spinach that I blanched, squeezed dried and chopped up.

I made this recipe as written and it was perfect.  It was my first time working with phyllo so the instructionsl video really helped.  Once I got in the swing of things, I was able to put them together really fast.  I froze them and baked them from frozen and they cooked perfectly.  Thanks for a keeper!

scrumptious and flavourful...i dont think using salt in the spinach mixture is necessary because i didnt, the feta cheese adds enough saltiness and flavour to them

I substituted out 1/4 of the spinach for an equal amount of cream cheese (since I'm not actually Greek I can get away with it ;). I accidentally left out the egg and these still turned out great. Even without the added volume of the egg, I still yielded about 28 when using about 2 tbsp of filling in each. I took two sheets of phyllo, buttered in between them, then used a pizza cutter to slice the combined sheets into thirds from the long side. A lot of work, but they got a great reception!

Tasty.  I make these appetizer-sized.  We've traditionally always used green onions in the filling and a dash of nutmeg too.  I brush the tops with a mixture of butter/oil before baking. You can also freeze them before baking to store for when company's coming.

I go to 'Taste of the Danforth' every year, an annual Greek festival and buy a frozen Spanakopita from this nice little Greek lady at her bakery.  I really didn't think I'd be able to find one as good as hers.  I'm both happy and sad to say that I won't be buying one next year - this was absolutely fabulous!!  Thank-you so much for this recipe!

I made this for my book club and they were fantastic! While the spanakopitas are a little labour intensive, they are definitely worth the effort. 
Like others have suggested, I only bought 1 package of phyllo pastry and baked the spanakopitas approx 25 mins. I recommend cutting 6 sheets of phyllo lengthwise into 4 strips, which makes 24 spanakopitas.

We did a test run on this and even though before rolling it out on our un-american pot luck dinner and even though it's time consuming it's well worth the work!  I received rave reviews from everyone that tried one.  I served it them with tzatziki sauce, greek kabobs (both recipes from this site) and cous cous.  Even for a novice beginner this was easy to do!

I gave this a 5 star..but wanted to say I thought working with the sheets was very time comsuming. I found the 'shells' in the freezer section at the same time I was grocery shopping and picked a couple boxes up. I'm glad I did, cause I used those for half the recipe. What a life saver! Great flavor..will use this recipe again (with the shells)

This recipe is excellent and freeze very well.  
The baking time was less than 45 minutes in my oven (approx. 20) so watch for them turning golden brown.

I had a lot of fun making these. I used butter flavored oil spray to help speed up the phyllo-buttering process, but I did follow directions otherwise, and the video was a huge help. I thought they were delicious, but my family did not go nuts over them like I thought they would.

My friend and I recently catered a Christmas party and we made spanakopita.  They were a big hit.  Instead of making them into triangles we rolled them and cut them into bit size piece.  I one roll longwise we got about 12 per roll.  They were great!

I tried this recipe out to bring with me to a cocktail party and though they were a success, I thought they were a little bland surprisingly.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used a pizza cutter to cut these into strips which worked really well and then I used spray olive oil to speed things along and this worked fine but the final taste would have been better with butter.  Give yourself plenty of time to make this dish and factor in thaw time for the dough and adequate cook time.  I would try these again but kick up the flavor a bit.

Turned out pretty well....make sure you break up the feta really well or you get lumps in the final baked product.

Great Recipe, the first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great, the next time I make it I had planned on doubling the recipe and changed my mind last minute and that led to the mistake of doubling the eggs, but that was a wonderful mistake, my husband likes it better with the extra egg.  I also now add bulk sausage and cheddar cheese to the mix and make it a main meal.

I made these for a party, but had never had them before. I was sure this was an excellent recipe when one of the guest (who told us he was Greek) came back to the kitchen to compliment them. Thanks for the great recipe!

I received rave reviews for this recipe!  
Only issue I ran into was the Phylo dough.  More than one sheet has to be used.  I used 2 to 3 sheets for each triangle and the cooking time was more like 10 to 15 min.  
I am definately making this again! Thanks for a great appetizer!

I made these individually as opposed to one large "pie".  It was really good, my kids even ate it!  I can't give it 5 stars as I'm not sure I would make it again.  It was really good, but not a MUST do again.

Great! My boyfriend and I loved it! We added about 2 T. of basil, 2 cloves of garlic and some lemon juice to the mix - it was delicious! I used two sheets of fillo pastry and folded them into packets instead of triangles - which was fast and easy. Next time I think I'd like to try adding a little more feta - maybe feta with herbs just to see what that's like. Thanks so much!

Pretty good.  Never had the "authentic" kind to compare it to, but it was a nice finger food.  The spinach and feta go nicely....all I changed was adding a touch of nutmeg.  Working with phyllo dough is not my idea of a good time though!  Thanks for sharing, was a nice change of pace.

This is the best spanakopita recipe I have found!  I added some minced garlic and used a sweet Vidalia onion but otherwise left the recipe alone.  Delicious.  The sweet onion really added to the flavor.  I served it with fresh lemon slices and pita bread with hummus.

I loved the flavour! I also used only one sheet of phyllo dough and will try with 2 or 3 next time as the pastry layer was too thin. Adding garlic and a bit of lemon juice is a good idea

Very good recipe. I've never used phyllo before and was a bit scred, but it was really simple. I made these for a potluck and everyone loved them. I added a few cloves of garlic too and they turned out awesome.

This is a GREAT recipe!!  I made just a few minor changes . . . I only used about a half of an onion, chopped.  I also didn't have dill.  So I omitted it and added some fresh lemon juice.  To embelish the lemon I replaced the pepper with lemon pepper!  SUPER TASTY!!  Thank you!!!!

This was amazing. I made this version of the filling and also did a version with mushrooms and rosemary instead of spinach and dill. Make sure to fill up the triangles. I did a heaping tbsp and it was not enough.

I used Stouffers Spinach Souffle instead of eggs and spi ach.  The prep time is longer than an hour.  No way to do it in a half hour unless you're referring to just prepping onions and mix.  Took me 45 minutes to roll up the triangles.  Only takes half hour to back.

Excellent recipe - delicious, authentic flavors and texture. I also tried it vegan (almond feta, almond ricotta sub for eggs, earth balance butter sub). Wonderful. Thanks for sharing!

These are SUPER tasty and I was amazed by how easy they were to assemble.  I ended up freezing the majority of them after assembling them because this makes a bunch.  My whole family loved them!

Used margarine instead of butter but it still tasted fantastic! The filling was a bit runny but that could totally just be my own problem.

I have never made this before and was really happy with how it turned out. I also have never used Phylo s I double checked the reviews...layered it with spinach filling, like a lasagna, buttering the sheets of phylo-  I think 3 eggs might be enough and it def. needs salt/garlic/pepper but it was delicious! I also didn't cook spinach, just drained and added lightly cooked onion mixture.

I loved this!  I had never worked with Phyllo dough before .  My husband and I did it together for our "Gourmet Group" dinner. Together, it took us maybe 30 minutes to do the rolling dough part, which is the hardest.  Don't use a wet paper towel on top of the plastic wrap over dough (those directions were on the package) because it accidentally touched some dough and ruined it.  Just cover it with plastic wrap, as this recipe says.  Also, we cooked it just 20 minutes, which was perfect.  Delicious!

I tried to follow the recipe without making any changes. In the end I  used a lot less butter and had plenty of phyllo left, but the final product was very good. I'll definitely make it again, maybe adding a little lemon but otherwise keeping it the same.

i followed several other reviewers suggestions: added a spoon full of uncooked rice, cut before baking & poured a swig of olive oil over the surface to drizzle down & be absorbed, only used feta cheese, added a slice of prosciutto thinly sliced, added dill, as well as parsley, used about ten bulbs of organic garlic, used organic filo, put 8 layers on the bottom, another 8 on top, used nutmeg in the filling, added cut up artichoke hearts to the filling as well as the dill & onions, drained the filling in unbleached coffee filters in a colander for an hour while the filling cooled, tried the plates after but the filters had been so successful i didn't need to, used a combo of olive oil & butter between layers of filo.  it was great.  thank you so much for this recipe.  i served it with lamb & a greek salad of artichoke hearts, tunisian organic cherry tomatoes, red peppers, season fresh radishes, asparagus tips, 6 different kinds of olives, bococcini (to balance the feta), red onion, green onion, lots of fresh basil...the mom in law refused to eat anything but the lamb.  the meal was perfect, DH & i adored the spanakopita, felt like we'd been jettisoned  to a beachside restaurant in crete.  dear MiL has no idea what she missed.  thanks again.

Absolutely tremendous! my first time with phyllo, and definitely not for the faint of heart! I think I did stuff em a little much, the amounts were close on the boxes, but I still have a whole box left. may have to try my hand at Baklava lol.

first few were a mess till I got the swing but on the second tray it was blowing right through. I did use some extra V for the onions and added some parm reg.

Instead of triangles, I made this in a baking pan. The Spanakopita turned out pretty well, but it lacked something for me. Still doesn't taste the same as my fave Greek restaurant. Might have to have tweaks, but overall pretty good.

I cut this recipe in half and it was still a ton of food. I followed the directions exactly though and these came out awesome! Made me look like a master chef. I have to admit the filo dough was a challenge- definitely use a towel to keep it moist even if you work quick like I do you still need the towel

This recipe is fantastic!  I was in a bit of a hurry and used the ready made Phyllo shells for a holiday party.  The appetizer received rave reviews from everyone at the party.  I made some small changes to the recipe.  I only used 1 onion, omitted the flour and used 2 eggs.  The fresh dill in the recipe makes the taste amazing.  This will be a go-to appetizer in the future.  Thank you for sharing, Mary!

I added extra feta and dill as I often have found that store-bought ones don't have nearly enough for my personal taste, and without the cheese they can be a bit dry.

With these modifications, they turned out GREAT --- they were a big hit as an appetizer at my dinner party.

Yummy and probably worth the work and time it takes to make these, but I would rather eat them than make them!  I don't think the directions state to cut the phyllo in half before folding into triangles, but the how-to video explains it all.  I froze a bunch to bake later.

I live in a Greek neighbourhood, and this reicpe is awesome and VERY authentic.  Tastes just as good, if not better from the local Greek shops.  I got tired of buying fresh spanakopita all the time, and these are great and a lot cheaper then buying them as take-out.  They are a little difficult, but definitely watch the spanakopita how-to video on this site.  It makes everything a lot easier.    I have a bunch in my freezer now, and they're perfect right out of the freezer and into the oven.  Thanks a lot!

So good! i decided to cut the time in half my cutting the phyllo in to horrible looking squares and bunched the phyllo around the spinach mixture... maybe it didn't look as great but tasted great... my Egyptian boy friend it reminded him of when he went to greece!

If you have the time and the patience this recipe taste amazing! I watched a video on food network on how to fold these, that helped me alot. Great recipe! If you do not take your time though, they will not come out right. For me its not worth my time to make them. But five stars on taste

I have made this recipe probably 20 times and every time they turn out delicious.  The only thing that I omit is the dill because I never have it but we don't miss it. My kids love Spanakopita and ask for it regularly. It's so funny when they ask for it around other people....they get some strange looks!

This is seriously an awesome recipe. I made these for a get together recently and they were gone in less than an hour. You really don't need to change anything. The recipe is great as it is.I did add some parmesan along with the feta cheese. You must use feta it really makes these and don't skip the dill either. It is essential. I also didin't use the whole amount of butter. You really only need about 1 1/2 sticks. The recipe says to cut the phyllo sheets in halves and fill. You can also cut into thirds. This will make a good size for appetizers. Wonderful recipe!!!

Watch the how to video it really helps!!

These are AMAZING! It was my first time making Spanakopita, and I was a little nervous, but they turned out awesome, and I got rave reviews from everyone. The only changes I made were instead of using the oil, I used butter, and I couldn't find phylo, so I used puff pastry instead. Very tasty! Will be making again for sure! :)

Absolutely wonderful. My daughter & I made this for a special dinner. Working with the phyllo definitely required a team effort, but I'm sure it gets easier with practice. May try & cut down on the butter next time, since it was dripping out as we ate them, but it was oh so yummy!!

This recipe was delicious, and quick prep!  I cheated a little and used the pre-made, frozen phylly cups in spinach and tomato, and took a huge tray of these to Christmas dinner.  They looked festive in the red and green cups, and disappeared very quickly!  Thanks for the great recipe!

These are really good and make a great presentation!  No joke, though, that phyllo is really finicky.  I followed the instructions on the video and I strongly suggest you do the same.  I didn't need all of the butter - using any more than I did would have left the phyllo too wet to make a proper triangle.  I followed the recipe as written, forgetting to add in some nutmeg as the lady in the video did.

Ijust finished making these for a party. I think they came out great. 
I cut down on the butter to 1/2 lb and think I could have used even less. I had to cover them with a loose sheet of aluminum foil to keep them from browning up too much about midway through the baking.  Great recipe. It helped to look at the Spanakopita "how to video" first.

This was exactly the flavor I was looking for. Delicious! These were a big hit at the party I made them for. The only changes I made were to cut the veg. oil from 1/2 cup to 2 Tbsp and I only used about half the butter -- I just wanted a lower fat result.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Love the recipe, my whole family gobbled them up!  I gave it 5 stars because I think its a great recipe by itself. But I like to mess with recipes (my dh hates that), I only used 3 eggs, and added some garlic.  I used dried dill and thought it came out fine as well.  I would prefer the next time I make it to use more feta, but then again I love cheese. I think the recipe is great as is!

These were sooo good. A little bit of work, but well worth it. I served it for dinner along with a salad. My kids who don't usually eat spinach loved these, and my husband couldn't stop eating until there were none left! A great recipe.

i absolutely loved this recipe! i made it for cultural food day at my highschool. it was fun to make, and everybody ate maybe a little TOO much of it lmao. the only thing though was that the mixed smells of spinach, onions, and garlic were overkill.

This was really good!
I added some parmesan cheese for more flavor.
Did have trouble folding the phyllo dough into triangles - mine were oddly shaped rectangles, I'll have to work on that.
