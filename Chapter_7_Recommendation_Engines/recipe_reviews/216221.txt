Delicious! If you want the marshmallows to be toasted, then turn the broiler on for a few seconds. Also, fudge is a bit runny to put on right away, stir it a bit, and you won't lose too much chocolate goodness due to dripping! Otherwise, amazing.

Even with the many steps required in the making of these cookies, I found that they were fairly simple and quick to make. Timing is essential in getting your marshmallow to look just right on the top of the cookie.  Not enough time, and it won't squish dowm enough.  Too much time, and it will be melted all over.  Two minutes in my oven was just perfect.  The fudge topping set up very nicely and I didn't have any messy fudge running off the tops of the marshmallows.  My kids and their friends loved the look and the taste of these cookies.

You need to read the package ... you only use 1/2 cup butter, not a cup, and you should probably bloom the cocoa to a liquid so that you get a chocolate flavor in the cookie. The water is a must to get a shine and melted-like fudge topping.  They tasted great and make a wonderful presentation.  I added chocolate shreds in my cookie base ... added flavor!

Decent. Better after a day or two. Nothing really to write home about. I don't know if I'll make these again.
