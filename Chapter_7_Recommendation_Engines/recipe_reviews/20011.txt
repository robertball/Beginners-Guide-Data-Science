Why would you want to cook Mango? All you need to do is cut in half, scoop out and puree with the cream.  If it isn't very sweet, then add a spoon of sugar (actually, honey will distort the wonderful taste)!

Delicious? Yes! Quick? No!! It took a lot of simmering in water before discovering that the skin would not start to remove. (I even slit the skin with a sharp knife - no luck!) Finally I took the mangos out of the water and after a cooling-off peeled off the skin. Now came the really rude surprise: the fruit DOES NOT easily come away from the huge pit (nothing like a peach!). I squished and squeezed and scraped that pulp away. It took what seemed FORever! What did I do wrong? Are there different kinds of mangos? I served this to my ladies' Euchre group and got rave reviews for the taste. I insisted that even the dieter's have some because of how much work went into it. LOL! One of the gals suggested that this would be great made with peaches - I'll sure try that next time!

We didn't enjoy this at all. It was something of a pain to make just because I had trouble getting the mango to really blend well but the main problem is the taste. It tastes like a blob of honey with a little mango flavoring on the side. I'm a sugar addict and this is way over-the-top too sweet even for me.

Mangos were easy enough to peel - about 5 minutes in boiling water and let cool - skin peeled right off. Nobody in my family liked it. I wont be making this again. Guess you really have to like Mangos. My son said it would be great with strawberries instead.

I'm not sure what the point of boiling the mango is. I simply removed the pit and skin diced it and whizzed it up with my hand blender. Meanwhile I beat some whipped cream with honey (added in a little cinnamon and vanilla extract) and then folded in the pureed mango and chilled. The end result was light and tasty...but nothing exciting at all.

This was a flop! The skins did not come of the mangoes. The honey taste was too over powering. I think this would have tasted much nicer if the mango was raw. I ended up with a liquid mess. I ended up cutting up a raw mango mixing it in adding lemon jello to set it all. I think it spoiled the lovely raw and fresh mangoes.

This wasn't at all what I expected. I ended up with a mango puree. It tasted good (just like mangos) but I didn't care to eat it by itself. My family wasn't impressed by it either. Maybe it would be good as a filling in a cake?

it's kinda hard to boil the mangoes enough for the skin to come off (ir maybe it just feels like that cuz i'm only 12...) but other than that the recipe was quite easy and very yummy!

The recipe idea is a good combination - fruit with cream. But I used canned Mango puree (available in asian stores)to save myself the trouble plus you get consistent taste. I blended the pureed mangos with one cup almonds/ 2 sliced white bread/ half and half and added whipped cream. Freezed it overnight. Tropical treat heaven!!!

Honestly I was not impressed. Perhaps I just didn't do it right perhaps I was having a bad day... It tasted like semi-creamy mango mash that's all and unfortunately I was expecting a nice fluffy mango-flavored dessert. I even like mangos! The mangos were quite stringy maybe I didn't blend them long enough? The cream never whipped properly either I wondered later if I should've added the honey later with the mangos instead of whipping it with the cream because that sure didn't work!! It has potential but that's because it's such a nice basic recipe. I imagine it would be good with other fruits.

It makes no sense boiling the mangos?? just cut them open and scoop out the meat with a spoon. we make something called a "mango float" just mix sweetened condensed milk regular milk and mix in mangos beat until slightly smooth. layer pan with graham crackers and repeat to the top. pour remaining over top pop into the fridge. Fantastic!!! I am from Puerto Rico but now live in Cebu Philippines and eat mangos everyday.

WARNING. MANGO are in the same family as Poison Ivy. Young children sometimes get a poison rash around their mouths from eating the ripened fruit in early season. Peal and discard outer skin first before stewing the mango.

I chose to use frozen mangos instead (since I made it in winter) this made it very easy and quick. I heated them to warm before blending. I was looking for more of a cream topping so the amount of mango made it too soupy. Double the cream and honey and half the mango (or add to taste and texture). I also had raw mango honey on hand so the taste is incredible (the cream and honey alone would've been sufficient).

I agree that the mangos do not need to be simmered. Just peel and remove the pit. BTW this is a great jumping off recipe for mango ice cream!

I ended up using an entire pint of heavy cream and it still wasn't anywhere near creamy. It was the consistency of a smoothie.

I agree with another rater why cook mango? If it is ripe it will peel easily. I didn't like the honey flavor with this.

Okay so definitely no point boiling whole mangos. Just peel cut and toss them in the blender with the honey and cream took 5 minutes! I topped with more mango pieces and cinnamon it was very light sweet dessert.
