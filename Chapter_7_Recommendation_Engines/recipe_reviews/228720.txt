I'm the original submitter for this recipe and I noticed that there's a typo. There should only be 1/2 cup of 7-up. That's why so many batches are ending up too wet! Sorry about that. I hope it helps!

This recipe as written is a soupy sticky mess!  Uses too much soda and butter goes in the baking pan not the bowl! I had to throw out this recipe batch and lookup the Pinterest recipe to have a successful outcome. Pinterest recipe; 2 cups Bisquik, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup 7up mixed together and turned out on a floured surface - pour 1/2 cup melted butter in a baking dish, then drop in the biscuits. Bake at 425 to 450  for 12 - 15 minutes depending on your oven.

When I made these biscuits, I used a homemade baking mix and I dropped the batter in greased muffin tins instead of a greased baking sheet. This is a nice variation on Grandma's Baking Powder Biscuits--I served them with Lasagna Roll Ups and the family seemed to like them. My husband says they're good "sopping up" biscuits.

I have just recently discovered these delicious biscuits.  I made with diet soda and fat-free sour cream, so quick and easy.  I keep a can of soda on hand so I can quickly put this together for dinner.  Thanks brighteyes_22 for sharing.

I have never in my life made such a light, fluffy biscuit.  I have tried and tried and only been able to turn out hockey pucks until this recipe.  

Two suggestions.  As many others mentioned, cut the amount of 7-up.  I had been given another version of this recipe and after reading the comments decided to go with a half cup of 7-Up measuremment from that recipe instead a full cup mentioned here.  All the other measurements were exactly the same.  PERFECT BISCUITS.

Second, don't just butter the bottom of the biscuit dish.  Butter the tops of the biscuits as well.  ]It gives the finished biscuit a nice golden color.  

They're fabulous!!

I tried these this past weekend and they are great. I cut the amount of 7up down to 1/2 cup. I melted the butter in the pan that I was going to cook the biscuits in, instead of adding to the dough mixture. I patted out the dough on a lightly dusted surface (with bisquick) to fit my 9 in square pan and used a biscuit cutter to cut my biscuits. I then added the cut biscuits to the melted butter in the 9 in pan. This is definitely a keeper. I think next time I make these I am going to pat out dough to fit my 9 in square pan and use a pizza cutter and cut into 9 pieces. Thanks for sharing this great recipes.

Be sure to correct the recipe to 1/2 cup lemon lime soda (7up); biscuits are light and fluffy.  Dust your board and  top of do, then give it a couple gentle kneads and press into a rectangle.  Use a pizza cutter to cut into 12 biscuits.  Once you put into the buttered pan, (I used a 10X13 dish.  Brush with additional melted butter before and after and these are a family favorite.

These are without a doubt the BEST biscuits I've ever had.  Noting submitter of recipe said there was a mistake and that the soda should be half the amount called for.  I was completely out of 7-up, but I had some club soda and thought "What the heck - I'll give it a shot".  I also completely nixed the butter as it seemed unnecessary (having just made a batch of bisquick stuff and knowing it was full of shortening).  They turned out light and airy and were an absolute delight to eat.  Which I did.  Smothered in butter and jam.  YUM!  Note to self, it was a humid day when I made and I only used - oh, about 3/4th of the club soda...mine were perfectly cooked in 10 minutes, but I made smallish biscuits..

My hubby told me to throw away all other biscuit recipes, he loves the tender inside and crispy outside of these biscuits. We differ on how thick we like our biscuits. For his thinner crispier biscuits I place in an iron skillet and don't let the dough touch. For my thicker/fluffier biscuits I place in an iron skillet with sides touching, they bake up and not spread out. Thanks for sharing!

These are great **IF** made correctly.  Do NOT put the melted butter into the batter.  Put it in the bottom if the baking pan and put the formed biscuits on top.  AND...only use 1/2 cup soda. I used diet Squirt because I had it.

I don't typically like a Bisquick biscuit, but, I thought I would give this a try.   I was pleasantly surpised!  The biscuits were light and fluffy and very good. The top and bottom of the biscuit was softer than a normal biscuit, but, the bottom was soft and buttery and had great flavor. I did pat out the dough with a little extra Bisquick and cut with a cutter instead of drop biscuits. ***MAKE SURE YOU READ THE SUBMITTERS REVIEW - She states there is a typo in the recipe.  You are only supposed to use 1/2 cup of 7up.   I double everything in a 9 x 13 pan 4 cups bisquick, 1 cups sour cream, 1 cup 7up, but,& 1/2 cup butter.  Easy and yummy!

Made as written, this dough turns out to be a wet gooey mess. My husband tried to make them exactly as stated in the recipe but had to adjust. He just sprinkled on more baking mix, worked it in, then repeated this process until it was a workable consistency. The result was definitely a 5-star biscuit.

Next time I think we'll cut the soda in half as suggested by other posters or try dropping into muffin tins as suggested by another. I really liked that these were sooooo buttery that no additional was needed after baking. I may try them with a little granulated or powdered garlic sprinkled on the butter and maybe even add a dash of Italian seasoning into the batter for a savory dinner roll. Loved how tender and light they were too.

This is the best biscuits recipe I have ever made -- but the typo needs fixed ASAP.  It should read 1/2 cup 7-up.

I made it today ...Biscuits and Gravy for breakfast and OMGosh...the best ever.I would give it 5 stars if the 7up measurements were correct but THANK YOU for the recipe!!! Also, I kneaded them slightly in bisquick,cut them out with a glass and placed them in the buttered baking pan. Bake as directed!!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and only used 1/2 c. soda. My family loved these though I think they just love biscuits in general. I thought they were OK but nothing really special. I'll probably try making them again with a little more soda than half. They'd probably be more moist that way.

As others have stated....DO NOT MAKE THIS RECIPE AS STATED ABOVE WITH A FULL CUP OF 7-UP.  ONLY 1/2 A CUP AND IT WILL TURN OUT PERFECT.  This is such an awesome recipe, the biscuits come our so light and fluffy.  I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream to make it healthier, and you could not tell the difference at all.  Also, I make the version in which you leave the butter out of the mix and instead melt it in the pan, placing the biscuits on the melted butter before baking (also cutting the dough with a biscuit cutter).....so good this way.  I'm not much of a sprite or 7-up drinker but will definitely be keeping it on hand from now on, if only to make these biscuits.

I really like these when they turn out.  Once in a while they spread too much on the cookie sheet.  This may be due to the elevation I live at.

Too much liquid will make biscuits flat, so use only half the soda and this recipe will turn out fine. I doubled the recipe, using 4 c Baking Mix, 1 c sour cream, 1 c soda, and 1/2 c butter. They fit into a a 9x13 inch pan, and were very good.

I just made these to go with sausage gravy and they had to have been the BEST biscuits I have ever tasted!!!!! They are so light and fluffy and so very tasty!!!!!I made them with the 1/2 cup of soda, I used Diet Ginger ale and they turned out just WONDERFUL!!!! After mixing, I patted it out on my counter, shaped it like my pan and cut it into 9 pieces and fit them into the oblong pan. They fluffed up beautifully and weren't flat at all. Thank you for this recipe. Will never buy biscuits again when they are so easy  to make this way!!!!!!

You only need 1/2 cup of 7 up.  Melt the butter and put it in the bottom of the pan and then drop the biscuits in (instead of mixing it in the batter)   Much better ;-)

Liked it better with 1/2 cup of 7-UP, and putting the melted butter in the pan not in the mix as others suggested. I also cut the sour cream into the Bisquick with a knife (as for scones or pastry crust), then added the 7-UP - it is really sticky wet dough,so you need extra bisquick on your surface to aide in patting the dough into a 9 "circle. I used a small juice glass to cut them out and got 9 biscuits. Hubby likes them too. Good with jelly or fried ham, and tonight I am making chili to eat with the 6 leftover :)

I tried this recipe tonight however I needed to add alot more bisquick and flour to make the dough. I was a little disappointed and was about to throw it all out, I am SO glad I didn't. The dough finally came together and I baked them on a cookie sheet. AWESOME! I didn't give it 5 stars for the frustration/anger issue I had with the dough. Other than that, this recipe rocks!

These were so light and fluffy and yummy!!! And of course, so easy to make. Will certainly be making these again.  I did pat dough out on a Bisquick sprinkled board and cut into 6-9 squares then put into 9" pan with the melted butter. They were easy to pull apart when done and looked nice altogether.

I have 6 kids that never agree on anything but they all loved these biscuits. I quadrupled the batch and it still didn't give them enough.

Amount of 7up in recipe is wrong. Unfortunately, I didn't figure this out until after I poured the listed amount and it was too liquidy! Not cool!

This recipe is written wrong. The butter goes in the baking pan Not in the batter. That is why it's sticky and soupy. I've seen this recipe many other times and butter never goes in the batter. Recipe gets a 0 from me cuz I wasted ingredients. Biscuits turned out like pancakes. Sorry but this recipe is horrible.

My son was disappointed I was making biscuits instead of yeast rolls until he tasted these fluffy biscuits.  Now he asks for these!  Not your traditional biscuit, but so good!  As written, the dough is too moist.  You have to add more baking mix or cut back on soda.

I had to add considerable more mix.  I think it should be 1/2 cup soda. Fortunately I had more mix to add to get the right consistency. I remembered seeing this recipe and did not take time to read the reviews(I almost always read the reviews), so I have to take responsibility in that respect.

As others have pointed out, 1 cup liquid is too much.  Use 1/2 cup.  I had no soda but I did have lite beer on hand, so I used half a cup of that.  Also, I had no sour cream but I did have buttermilk, so I used half a cup of THAT instead.  Even with my weirdo substitutions they came out great!  Butter in the baking pan, as others have pointed out too, and I made mine as drop biscuits not rolled this time.  They are in the oven now and we can't wait!  Biscuits 'n gravy for Sunday morning breakfast!

I just made a double batch.  Easy, moist & very good taste.  I will definitely make these again.  I followed previous suggestions & used 1/2 cup soda per batch & also DID NOT mix the butter in with the dough.  I brushed it on the bottom of the pan & also on top of the biscuits before cooking them.  Next time I will try adding spices or seasonings to add a little kick to the biscuit.

This is a very good, easy recipe....except the soda amount is incorrect.  For 8 biscuits it should only be 1/2 cup of soda.  Recipe will still work with the full cup but is much too runny.

I have this recipe and it should call for 1/2 cup lemon-lime soda. Not one cup. That is too much. Using only 1/2 cup makes these light fluffy and best biscuits ever.

Wow! These were fantastic. I used the "Homemade Biscuit Mix" scaled down to 8 servings, since I don't keep the commercial kind on hand. I also didn't have 7Up, so used diet Mt Dew instead. They were so fluffy and light! Definitely a keeper, and couldn't be easier. Thanks for sharing!

These biscuits were a disappointment the first time I made them because they were flat as pancakes.  The next time I added another 1/2 cup baking mix & that made the batter thicker & they baked up much better.

These are yummy!  I made these using Bisquick and they turned out light and fluffy with a great flavor.  I highly suggest using a greased muffin tin or even ring molds because the batter tends to spread out a bit so they look kind of flat instead of raised biscuits.  Definitely easy and a real keeper!

These are great!  I make them for our church Wed night dinners. Everyone loves them.  I don't roll out the dough. I just melt the butter in the pan then spread the dough over the butter and smooth it out (as best as you can), then bake.  When they are done, I just cut into the size I need.  I usually make them for Biscuits and Gravy, so the shape doesn't matter.

My grandson made these biscuits, not realizing that  we were only to use 1/2 cup soda instead of 1 cup. What a sloppy mess. We read many reviews and this happened to others. One person had added more flour. We did the same. I know that all people make mistakes, but in this case you had to read the reviews to see that a mistake was made by brighteyes. Granted she told about the mistake but could have told us how to correct the problem. Ingredients are expensive and time is valuable so she should have corrected the mistake before so many other people  made these biscuits.

Really upset that the OP doesn't just delete this.  How many others have to find out recipe is screwed up TWICE after they've already made it?? 

Way Too much 7up • and • butter does NOT go in the recipe, it goes in pan under biscuit dough

Look, the original submitted admitted the recipe has a error that results in a far to wet mix that runs. the end result is more akin to pancakes rather than biscuits. However, with the correction of only 1/2 cup 7-up these biscuits come out great and are easy to make.

Only four ingredients? No kneading?, no rolling pins involved? Oh yes! I have found my "go-to" biscuit recipe!  I use a cast iron biscuit pan and I've found that I have to up the cook time to just around 20 minutes (with a watchful eye after 15 minutes), and they turn out perfectly. The bottoms are not overdone, they're not dry, they're tasty and the family loves 'em. This one is a keeper!

This recipe makes the best biscuits.  I roll out the dough, cut 9 circles and use a square pan instead of a rectangular.  They rise beautifully and they are light and fluffy.

I've been making these biscuits for years and this recipe fits that bill. These are so so easy to make that the kids want to get in on it too! The dough can be sticky to work with, but this doesn't have to be a problem. Pour the whole thing into a casserole dish (atop the butter of course) and level it. Bake it like a cake and cut your biscuits into squares. Tastes the same without the added rolling and cutting, and no mess!! Once the gravy is on it no one will care about biscuit shapes and it just saves so much time. Love this!

I've made this three times now, the second time forgetting that the original recipe as published is wrong, and the amount of soda needs to be halved. I wish this could somehow be fixed, because if you get the proportions right, the biscuits come out flaky and buttery, perfect to go with sausage gravy. I do as others have suggested, melting the butter in the baking dish, then I pat the dough down so the butter is on the top and the bottom. Yummy, but please, can someone fix the published recipe? When I forgot and added one cup of soda, I had to just eyeball it and add more biscuit mix until the dough seemed right. They came out okay, but heavy compared to how they're supposed to. UPDATE:5/14/16: I made these this morning using Greek yogurt instead of sour cream to bump up the protein, and reducing the butter to three T. to save fat and calories. We noticed no difference in the flavor, and actually prefer the less buttery version. They were still plenty buttery, and when serving with sausage gravy, they were perfect.  I'll be making them this way from now on for the improved nutritional values.

They were okay, like other reviewers it came out soupy but I added more of the baking mix and it was perfect. The only real issue is they came out very flat. They tasted pretty good and soft just like a biscuit should be but I don't think I want to taste 7up in my biscuit

If you want to make this recipe DO NOT add a whole cup of soda, it is WRONG !!  It needs only 1/2 cup  and then then biscuits will taste okay (at best ).

Theses were a very good alternative to traditional biscuits (which I make every weekend for breakfast). They are non traditional in the fact that the soda has sugar which is not part of a traditional biscuit. They are very light and nice with butter and jam. I also have added grated cheddar before putting in a muffin tin and then right when they come out of the over I brush liberally with melted butter that has been simmered with a couple of smashed cloves of garlic. Taste just like those you get at a famous seafood chain. Yum!

I didn't have biscuit mix on hand but I did have waffle mix which contains a couple less ingredients. I added a half teaspoon of baking soda. Instead of lemon-lime soda I used ginger ale. The biscuits look more like flat, soft muffins but it works. They lift right off of parchment; don't bother greasing a baking sheet.  Great flavor. Can add cheese and garlic for some spunk.

These biscuits are great but you have use a 1/2 of 7-up not 1 cup. I did put some the melted butter in the pan and some on the biscuits.Mine came out perfect.

My dough was soupy, I, like other reviewers, had to add at least 1 more cup of bisquick in order to get a consistency for drop biscuits.  Wish I had read reviews first like I do 99% of the time! They came out ok, very fluffy, not really bisuit-like.  Also- I used Polar Half and Half (grapefuit) soda, which did not alter the overall taste (I've made them before with lemon-lime soda).

perfect and NOT SOUPY AT ALL!!!   However I accidentally only did 1/2 C soda ;) And difference between butter in pan recipe versus butter in the dough one is, this is a drop biscuit recipe which is why I chose this one!  My kids are eating these up!!!  Best texture EVER!  I don't think a ton of flavor but MAN put some ham in these bad boys and YUM!  I'm gonna use em for next time I make homemade sausage gravy and biscuits.  Thank you for submitting this recipe :)

This recipe as written is terrible and needs to be fixed.  The amount of soda is twice what it is supposed to be.  I had to make the Betty Crocker dry ingredients for baking soda biscuits minus the baking soda to try and fix it.  Unfortunately for me, I started out with a double batch b/c my kids love them so much so wasted 1/2 a box of Jiffy Mix.

I've made these biscuits before but didn't have a copy of the recipe handy. So I turned to AllRecipes expecting that a recipe with a 4 star average would be okay. The ingredients were the same. The amounts seemed right. But they were NOT right. Two simple things make this so different than others - and not in a good way! If you make these and follow the directions, the batter/dough is WAY too runny and sticky. We still tried the finished biscuits and they were flat and more like thick, weird pancakes. Not tasty.

The original recipe calls for 4 cups of bisquick,1cup of sour cream,1/2 cup of melted butter,which goes in your baking pan,not the mixture. This is a great recipe,and they keep very well in a plastic bag.

Too much soda! I didn't read the reviews first because I had these last night at a friend's house. It's supposed to be a sticky mess. This recipe makes unusable soup. Added more baking mix, hope it turns out. Very disappointed the author needs to fix the recipe.

Loved it!  Didn't change a thing after taking note the measurement change.  I've made them 5 Times!  After pouring the butter in the pan move it around a bit too coat them and get a lil on top the more butter the better!

wondering if there is anyone who used this with success and altered for higher altitudes?  I am on the lower side, but for some things, such as biscuits, it makes a difference.  This recipe is apparently one of them.  Switched the butter into the batter and had a better result, but still not as fluffy as I would prefer.  Thanks for any suggestions

These were the best biscuits I ever had.
I used 2 C Bisquick, 1/2 C 7up, 1/2 C light sour cream, and no butter in the biscuits.  I did use butter to lightly grease the pan.  They came off the cookie sheet easily.
The second time I made them, I dropped batter by spoonfuls into chicken soup boiling on the stove.  I really liked the way it thickened the soup and the dumplings.

I followed this recipe after making them several times from another recipe. I realized when i was measuring the 7up that it was too much but i checked the recipe again and used it. When i saw how soupy it was i went and pulled out the other recipe i had used before and realized it only called for 1/2 C soda. so I doubled everything else and put the butter in the skillet, like i had always done, and they turned out great! actually having a double batch, I made some huge biscuits.

The only reason I didn't give these 5 stars, is because I would have preferred a taller biscuit and to be able to shape them. You can't really shape drop biscuits.  The texture was soupy and way different from the usual 7-up biscuit recipe I follow where I have to actually cut the biscuits.  Just based of the consistency of the batter, i thought the recipe was going to be a disaster.  But I added another cup of flour to the batter and a quarter cup of melted butter to the bottom of the cookie sheet and these biscuits turned out GREAT!

I wish so much I would have read the reviews...they spread out like pancakes :(  They were tasty but next time I will cut back on the 7-UP and use a 13x9 pan instead of a sheet pan.

Half the soda- 1 c. is over doing it.  Also, the second time I made them I added Greek Yogurt in lieu of sour cream and they turned out funny.  Not sure if it's the yogurt or something else!

I believe there is a typo in this recipe-  I think it should call for 1/2 Cup 7up not 1 whole cup.  
I have made these many times before, but misplaced my original recipe, thus led me to this one.  As I was mixing I noticed the dough was much too sticky compared to when I have made before.  I added more baking mix.   
I found my original recipe and it was 1/2 cup - thus better texture, easier to handle and no flat biscuits!!  
For those of you that posted yours were too thin or spread out too much, try using 1/2 cup 7up instead!
Love these biscuits!!  YUMMY!!
