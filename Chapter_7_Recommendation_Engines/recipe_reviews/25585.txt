In my quest to find an atypical chocolate cheesecake, this was perfect!  I made it exactly as stated, and made it again using another high quality bittersweet chocolate rather than Gianduj. The phyllo is a wonderful change. Knocked everyone's socks off.

the batter tasted really good, but it was just ok once it cooled down.
maybe because i used a heart shaped springform pan, i wished i didnt have phyllo on the side.

I tried this recipe scaled down to 8 servings and the results were amazing. Note that instead of a phyllo dough I made it with Graham crakers crust... Amazing! Also gets better with age!  Thanks again I will be making it again!

Loved the taste! I didn't like the Phyllo dough crust.  It was hard to work with and cut and I don't think it added that much to the dessert.  I would make this with a chocolate cookie crust if I was going to do it again.

This was FANTASTIC!  I love Gianduja, even though I can't pronounce it very well.  :)  

I made this for my wife for Valentine's Day, and she loved it.  But, she doesn't like the alcohol taste, so I substituted 2 tablespoons of Starbucks hazelnut syrup.  Worked great!
