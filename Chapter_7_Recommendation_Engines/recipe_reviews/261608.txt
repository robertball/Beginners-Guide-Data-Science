Loved it!  Tasted great and made a quick, healthy weeknight dinner.  I did make a few changes based on the ingredients I had,and my oven.  I baked it at 425 because my gas oven runs hot.  I used lemon wedges instead of lime, and sliced scallions (greens only) instead of cilantro.  I added some fresh broccoli florets and before baking topped it all with sliced sweet Italian chicken sausage.  Before the last 5 minutes of baking, I sprinkled on some parmesan cheese.

This was excellent! I am not Vegan so this was a side dish for me and it works great for that too. I've never been a huge fan of "raw" garbanzo's on their own like in salads but roasted like this and paired with roasted cauliflower and I couldn't get enough. This also plates nicely and has an elegant look to it making it perfect to serve to company yet simple enough to make for your every day average meal.

This turned out excellent! Awesome idea. I actually worked with what I had. I didn't have limes or cilantro (unfortunately) so instead, I put the Cauli, Beans, Cherry Tomatoes & also some halved Brussels Sprouts into a large bowl. I tossed them with some olive oil, dry white wine, balsamic Vinegar, Sea Salt, Pepper, Rosemary and minced garlic. This turned out so delicious and the outside of the brussels were caramelized. I drizzled some more balsamic over the top when it came out of the oven and a bit more rosemary. I will definitely be making this again!

Added a sprinkling of curry powder and about a teaspoon of cumin seeds.  Squeezed Mexican lime juice all over.  I served it over Israeli couscous.  It is a bit flavorless as written.  You have to toss it a few times while roasting.

This was very good and my family enjoyed it. I added a whole sweet onion to the recipe and also used garlic olive oil. I may add some avocado on top (after roasting) next time.

Great dish! I like it over brown rice or barley with a little crumbled feta on top. It's also good as a side dish. I enjoyed the leftovers the next day.

Very east and very good!  I took the sheet out a little early, drizzled with truffle oil and then cooked another ten minutes.  Perfect finishing touch.

LOVED this recipe.  We made it 2 nights in a row.  I'm going to try some of the other suggestions and cook chicken sausage on top next time too for a whole meal.  Thanks for sharing!

We are not vegans but my husband and I love this recipe.  We did cut the tomatoes in half because they stay too hot, too long, if I don't.  Love it.

It was pretty quick and easy. We loved it. It is very light though. As a main course, it barely made two adult servings.

We loved it as written.  One lime was just right.  My son and I served it over barley and sprinkled garlic powder on it at the table.  Very satisfying!  Looking forward to having this again next week.

I have made it several times for my vegan daughter with NO changes.  Today I added an additional cauliflower head, an extra cup of tomatoes, 3 additional limes and 1 lb of riced cauliflower to be able to spread it out for a few meals.   She liked it better with the changes.   This is a new favorite and very easy and quick to make.

I just skipped the cooking spray and halved the salt. Making sure I used all organic ingredients because they taste so much better. And who wants to eat pesticides anyway!

So simple and so good!  I had to make changes based on what I had (or rather didn't have - like a lime and cilantro).  So I made it "Italian style" with a lemon, extra garlic, and 1/4 tsp mixed Italian seasoning with the salt and pepper.  Roasted for 30 min to get that caramelization (stirred twice).  Then topped with 1/4 c shredded parmesan cheese.   It's a very versatile recipe, and I'm excited to try both the original flavors, as well as other flavor combos in the future.  So tasty, super easy, clean-up was a breeze, and a filling meal without feeling heavy.

I used as a side dish for pesto feta turkey burgers. My husband commented that it was a great combo.   I did not read the reviews for some reason, so next time I will add a sweet onion.  We loved this dish!  Will definitely be making it often!

I didn't have any lime or fresh cilantro (coriander), so I drizzled some lime balsamic over the roasted veg once they were roasted. I roasted them with a bit of ground coriander. Turned out very yummy indeed, but I'm still keen to try the original recipe here.

Really  great flavor!  I took other reviewers advice and cut the salt in half, which was perfect.  Also, I used an extra lime and put a little over the top of the dish before baking.

This was better than I thought it would be. I will admit to having added some cumin and some Montreal Steak Seasoning, and I didn't measure the oil, just added until there was enough to coat everything. Served over Israeli couscous like another reviewer suggested. We both loved it, and we're not vegans. Keeper.

Delicious! The only thing I think I would change for next time is to add lime juice as part of the olive oil mix.

It's a hit. I did not have small tomatoes so I introduced Red Bell Peppers for another flavor as well as the color. Do not over roast as this will make the garbanzo beans tough. Even more flavorful if you have time to marinate the veggies all together in the olive oil before roasting>

Something different for us. I probably wouldn't add the tomatoes next time.

My wife loved it. Very easy prep and roasting. I substituted cannelini beans, that is all I had at the time.

YES! Will absolutely make again. Some of the chickpeas got a little over roasted and crunchy but tasted great and the added crunch was surprisingly  good. My photo has a lot of cilantro on top. Probably didn't need that much but we love cilantro. So good! 
Thanks :-)

I put this over  a quinoa-mixed grain and it was tasty enough that I could eat it, but somehow it just didn't spark my taste buds.  I might make it again with some of the changes other reviewers mentioned, but it's not a dish I will crave.

Everyone loved this dish! A couple changes; added a few TB honey to help it carmelize and some Mrs. Dash seasoning  (purple cap). I could easily serve this as a main dish with a salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! will definitely make again.  I had a big head of cauliflower so I doubled the olive oil.  I squeezed the lime juice into the olive oil mixture as well.  Keep an eye on the chick peas so they don't dry out.

Very light and refreshing. I was multi-tasking so I accidentally put the last bit of cilantro in with the mix, not wanting to ruin the bake I threw it out and made as written minus the cilantro. I will pick up another bunch today for the leftovers.  I loved it and will make this regularly. The chickpeas are a little dry but didn't take away from the dish to me. Next time I will toss them in a little extra evoo before adding to the mixture

I did as another user suggested, used lemons instead of limes, green onions instead of cilantro, added broccoli and Italian chicken sausage. Since I added the broccoli ( and others said dish was a little bland) I added a dash of Italian dressing ( instead of more olive oil) and increased the salt and pepper just a Little was done in 20 minutes came out perfect!

Great. Makes a healthy, filling main dish. I used a pre-cut bag of cauliflower broccoli mix which was more than 4 cups.  I also used grill seasoning in place of the salt and pepper and 2T oil. No cilantro on hand and can't say we missed it.

This dish was hearty, however it was not to my taste.  It had some good crispness and flavor but the chick pea’s we’re a lil dry and chewy. I would still recommend it and may make it again with a few tweaks.

I did add parmesan cheese last 10 minutes and increased
cooking time to 1 hour at 425.  Not being a fan of cilantro
may try basil next time.. Very nice side dish or light meal

This is so very easy to make and just fantastic. I squeezed the lime over the veggies after it was all baked. Made a perfect main course for me, but would make a great side dish as well. My husband is not vegan so he put cheddar cheese and sriracha on top. He loved it!

Was so looking forward to this dish, all my favorites ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly as I do every recipe for the first time.  It was a horrible mush.  I have always loved almost every recipe I have tried, this was the first failure.

This was so interesting! Followed the directions, but not to a 'T' as I didn't really measure. Just used a head of the smallest cauliflower I could find since I was making it for 2,  a pack of cherry tomatoes with said can of Garbonzo beans. The rest I did to taste. Especially because I couldn't believe you could coat everything with just ONE tablespoon of olive oil. I probably used at least 4 and glad I did otherwise it would have been too dry. Next time I'll add more tomatoes as it's nice and refreshing with a bite of cauliflower. But it all worked well together and I had two big helpings. I was pleasantly surprised. Would be great for summer if you didn't have to cook it in the oven! LOL. Hoping my husband likes it as he's working late. This doesn't seem like a dish that would stay well for leftovers though but I'll see tomorrow...

This is a wonderful recipe as a meal or as a side dish. I made this just the way it said (except I added extra garlic).  The flavors blend into an enticing aromatic combination that even made my husband say, "Mmmm!" (He criticizes me for saying that)
He wants to try it again with fish.  I'm quite willing.

Added a bit of Avocado Citrus dressing to the seasonings before tossing with cauliflower, tomatoes and butter beans on the sheet in lieu of lime wedges and garbanzo beans.  Substituted quartered Campari tomatoes for the cherry tomatoes. But it was so yummy....
