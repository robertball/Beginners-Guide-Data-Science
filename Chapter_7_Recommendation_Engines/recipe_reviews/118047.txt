This is an easy, refreshing salad, full of lots of yummy bites!  I believe my mom would have loved this salad, since Waldorf salad was one of her favorites.  I followed the recipe exactly, and since the recipe did not specify, I used half red delicious and half golden delicious apples.  Thanks for the idea!
