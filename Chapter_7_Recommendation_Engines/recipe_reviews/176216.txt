Very nice marinade for chicken!  I left out the sesame oil, used low sodium soy sauce and cut the black pepper down to 1/4 tsp.  In order to give this a sort of sweet and smoky flavor I added 1 tsp. of liquid smoke.  I let this marinate all day.  The brown sugar carmelized the chicken on the grill and the result was very nice in both color and flavor.  It went great with rice and veggies!

SO DELICIOUS!  Even got a "Wow!" out of my husband.  Took 5 frozen chicken breasts and put them in a big zip loc with the marinade and stuck in a bowl of warm water to defrost.  2 hours later, grilled on my stove (on grill pan, we were out of propane!) and the chicken was moist and "wow" quality.  The key is to grill on low heat to retain the juices.  This is a simple and quick recipe I will make again and again.  Served with spicy vegetable chow mein and hawaiian rolls.

I made the marinade for chicken while camping.  We enjoyed it, though, it was a tad salty (and I LOVE salt), even though I used reduced sodium soy sauce.  Soy was the predominant flavor I got from these; if I make them again I think I'll reduce the soy a bit and bump up the balsamic.  TY for a nice marinade!

The Best! I marinated boneless, skinless chicken breasts overnight plus 6 hours. My husband grilled them on the charcoal grill.  The chicken was perfectly tender and full of flavor. No modifications of the ingredients made.

Uhh, this marinade really IS perfect!  I had four thin sliced chicken breasts that I marinaded in it for about five hours.  It was AMAZING.  I was dubious initially, but I was proven very wrong!  It grilled up beautifully.  I topped it with an avocado/tomato/onion mixture and my DH said it was Top Chef quality.  I highly recommend.

Overall the flavor was good.  However, next time I'll cut the sugar in half.  Too sweet for us.  This may be the cook eror though...  Marinaded longer than the stated 2 hours.

Sensational!  Followed the recipe to the letter and it was fabulous.  Not too salty or too sweet.  Marinated 4 poussin (small chickens)  overnight and baked them for 40mins.  Absolutely perfect.

This was very good; made as printed with no changes.  I let the chicken marinate over 4 hours and used chicken thighs and legs.  The marinade is a strong one and I thought the darker meat would be better.  I think I would use this on sirloin steak tips or a flank steak as well.

I made the marinade for this overnight and let the chicken sit until dinnertime the next day. The longer it sits, the better it is. I did add some chopped green onions. I plan on using this again, I plan on cutting the sesame oil down to one tbsp. Two tbsp. overpowered the rest of the flavors. I served this with Sesame Noodles, which are also from this site.

uhmmmm - ok and kids did eat, but IMO too much sesame oil.  Balsamic vinegar is better on its own IMO, not mixed with soy sauce and sesame oil.

Awesome Marinade and really easy to do.  I marinated the chicken for about 24 hours.  I made it right before we left to go camping and we had it the following day for lunch.  The chicken was delicious and tender.  Stabbed the heck out of the chicken with a fork before I added the marinade also didn't have sesame oil (couldn't find it at walmart) but it was still very very very good and we will definitly make it again!

We grilled boneless/skinless chicken breasts.  I omitted the fresh garlic and sesame oil since I was out of those ingredients and substituted garlic powder and added garlic powder as well.  I also added about 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter to it.  We only marinated the chicken for 30 mins and it gave the chicken a wonderful flavor and made it very tender  and by poking holes all through the chicken it let the marinade get deep into the chicken.  Next time I will marinade longer to give the flavors more depth.

This is a DELICIOUS marinade!!! I have made it a few times, the first time with no modifications - there was too much sesame oil for my taste, 2 tablespoons was way too much in my opinion.  So now I make it as written but with just a DASH of sesame oil and it is perfect!  I marinate the chicken overnight if possible and I usually bake it but grilled would be delicious too.  I also crush the garlic in my garlic press rather than chop for more flavor.  YUMMMMMMM!

This was good.  I did reduce the soy sauce by 1/4 cup and increased the balsamic by 1/4 cup.  I sliced BLSL breasts into strips and let it marinate 6 hours. I grilled the chicken and served it in a nice hoagie with bacon and provolone cheese.

I just eyeballed this one (didn't measure anything out perfectly) and it turned out great!  I know some people commented that the sugar was too much.  I did not pack the sugar, and went a little easy on the scoop.  I found the sweetness to be just right

Can't go wrong with a tangy, tasty marinade like this!!  I misread the recipe and just used sesame oil, but liked the added flavor boost on our veggie and beef kebabs!!  Marinated for 4-5 hrs. and the flavor was outstanding...

I have made this several times for different groups of people and everyone LOVES it!  It is easy, quick, and loved by all.  Only tip I have is to cut the chicken breasts in half before placing in marinade - doing this allows the chicken to absorb more flavour.

This really is the perfect marinade - though I've never used it for chicken! I will very soon because I just know it's going to be GREAT on chicken. I've made it a few times now and it's great on everything. I always cut the recipe in half (except for the sesame oil - I sometimes add the full 2 tablespoons of that). I also like to add some sesame seeds. I've used it as a marinade for pork and for a sesame steak stirfy (just added thin strips of steak, 1/2 a thinly sliced onion, and a head of broccoli cut up into smaller florets & quickly steamed - sauteed it all in a frying pan and added cornstarch/water mixture to thicken the sauce to serve over rice). Well balanced flavors - wouldn't change a thing.

My husband & I woke up yesterday morning (Memorial Day) and decided to try a totally new grilling recipe. We read the reviews and took the suggestion of cutting back on the sesame oil a bit. Wow! While we usually Don't try out new recipes on Holidays, This was a Huge Hit! Don't let the strong smell scare you....It cooks off and you end up with some Pretty Amazing Grilled Chicken!

Excellent recipe! Easy to do with common household ingredients. My family loved it and were impressed with the quick meal. I did add red pepper flakes to ours as we like a little spice.

It' PERFECT. I didn't change a thing. I marinated skinless-boneless thighs for 24 hours. Sweet, sour, tangy, tropical, YUM!
Now I use it for all my chicken, wings etc. Today I added a dash of cayenne pepper.

This recipe is great!  The only thing I did slightly different was switch the sesame oil (I'm not a big fan) with EVOO, and added some white wine - GREAT!  And it always gets rave reviews!!

This IS the PERFECT marinade!!!  A wonderful blend of flavors, not one dominating or overpowering another.  I made 1/4 of this recipe for two boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I reserved some to use for basting and marinated the chicken in the rest for about 5 hours.  Hubs grilled these and basted with the reserved marinade, which gave the finished chicken a beautiful glossy sheen.  This is a winner and one that we'll be repeating often!!  Thank you!

I tried this with four turkey wings.  It's sweet AND tangy.  It isn't typical (Kraft) barbecue sauce, as it states.  It's sauce for when you are barbecueing.  It wasn't bad, just not what I had in mind.   One big thing, & same problem with "marinade for chicken" I'm about to review, is that the flavor is barely noticable on the cooked food.  I didn't get the true taste of if from dinner - only from a dish of it I'd reserved.  My 12 year old boy preferred this & these are the measurements I used:  1/4c brown sugar, balsamic vinegar, rice wine vinegar, vegetable oil; 1/2c plus 2T soy sauce; 2 worcestershire; 1T hot chile sesame oil; 4 cloves garlick 1/4t black pepper

Great recipe! I was out of sesame oil, but it was still wonderful. I am anxious to try it again with the sesame oil though!

sooo good! it reminds me of the obon festival (japanese) chicken i used to have as a kid and never was able to duplicate. i only used 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil as it can be overpowering. sadly i only had 1 hour to marinade. i can't wait to make it again to marinade the proper length, 6 hours maybe. i will also try it with steak. thank you so much for this recipe. this is a keeper!

Definitely a "wow" factor here, and I only let this marinate for a very short time. Amazing taste. Cooked it on my cast iron grill pan.

Krystal's Perfect Marinade Haiku: "Can't say it's 'perfect', too much sesame oil, and too sweet for us." Sesame oil over-powered the flavor of the end-result chicken, which was also a little too sweet, in my opinion, so if I use this marinade again, I would greatly reduce both the brown sugar and the sesame oil. (As I've noticed several reviewers mention doing too.)

I made this 2 nights in a row. 1st time for pork kabobs (didn't have any sesame oil so i just wend without) let it marinate for 6 hours and they were delicious! Then I made the marinade for beef top sirloin steak (had all of the ingredients and made exactly as directed) the next night. It only had about an hour to marinate but it was still really good. Everybody liked it a lot. Oh and we put the rest on the asparagus....everybody was in love with that too.

Great marinade, we really enjoyed it.  I'm just mad at myself for not cutting my chicken into smaller pieces or pounding them out so they could soak up more flavor.  Followed recipe exactly using low sodium soy.

I made it without Worchester sauce (I was out) so I added about a teaspoon of liquid hickory smoke and used low salt soy sauce.  I also did inject about a teaspoon of marinade in each chicken breast while cooking. Got rave reviews, delicious!!  Thanks for sharing

Was good but wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I think next time I will add more brown sugar and less sesame oil since this did dominate the flavor.

This was recommended to me by luv2cook on the Recipe Buzz today. I had about 2 pounds of pork loin sliced into cutlets. I pounded them even thinner and marinated them in this for about 6 hours, then grilled them. Delicious with rice and grilled pineapple. An easy winner that I'm happy to add to my marinade arsenal.  Thanks!

I made this for chicken I was planning to cook on the grill, but it started to rain so I baked it in the oven.  I did not have any balsamic vinegar, so I used about 2 tsp. of apple cider vinegar instead.  This turned out great.  I know that it will be even better made on the grill.  Thanks for sharing!!

Wouldn't change a thing!  A refreshing change to the typical marinade.  My only change was that I used sesame seeds because I didn't have the sesame oil.  I only marinaded for about an hour, but that was ample amount of time for an awesome flavor.

I'd give this more stars if I could! I wondered what to do with the chicken breast I had taken out early in the day.  I only marinated for an hour and a half or so, boiled up the remaining marinade and basted the chicken breast on the grill.  Oh...my...gosh...This is the only way I'll grill my chicken anymore.  I made this exactly as stated, reducing the serving size to 2, and it was perfect!

Delicious!  The only change I made was to add Hoisen sauce and a little less brown sugar.  I marinated boneless/skinless chicken breasts for 24 hours and it was the perfect amount of time.  I had a few leftover the next day and they were a little "over marinated" but still good!

This is now our favorite marinade for chicken.  We didnt have any balsamic vinegar, so we substituted malt vinegar, and it was still great.  Makes the chicken very flavorful, and juicy.  A hot grill is the key, but it was so good.

Great!  I marinated my boneless, skinless chicken breasts for about 6 hours and then put them on the bbq.  They stayed moist and had lots of flavor.  Another keeper. No modifications required with this one.

Awesome stuff I use it for chicken, jerky and pork. It is the best for marinating a turkey breast overnight then on the BBQ. I recommend you marinade your meat longer than just two hours. If you don't have the time, follow the recipe and then put marinade in pot and bring to boil lower heat and reduce 10 mins. Great glaze.

The predominate flavour I got from this was vinegar. Too strong for my liking. It was still edible, but I wonâ€™t be using this recipe again for that reason. I cut the sesame oil in half but that was the only change.

Great flavor in this marinade. I was originally looking for something with a more traditional BBQ flavor, as this has more of a teryaki tang, but still very tasty. I'm always looking for new flavors for my chicken, this one's a keeper.

It was fantastic!! I ended up cutting the sesame oil and in half due to others saying that it can overpower the dish. I also cut the soy sauce in half to make the dish less salty. I will definitely make this again!

I have tried TONS and a TON of chicken marinade recipes over the years and this one is HANDS DOWN the best one I've EVER had! Thank you for this! I will use this often this summer! I used it on boneless chicken breasts, grilled them, sliced them and used them on an Asian Chicken Salad. But I am telling you I ate a bunch of the meat before it even met my salad it was so good!!!

I made this last night for dinner. I made the marinade about noon using Splenda Brown Sugar instead of the real stuff and left them in the fridge for about 5 hours, turning the plastic bag a few times. My husband put them on the grill. WOW! We loved them. We'll be doing them again often. For our taste they were not too sweet or too salty. Five plus stars!!!!!

Used this recipe for about 45 lbs of chicken breast meat to feed over 100 people.  People raved about the chicken and wanted the recipe. It is absolutely  the best marinade I have found yet.  I found brining the chicken ahead of time then the overnight marinade made this the best I have ever tasted. We used regular gas grills to cook the chicken.

I used less sugar and a touch of chili, just for our personal taste. A fantastic recipe.

Ooo yum! I added a little lemon juice and ground mustard and it tasted just like the chicken on a stick from our favorite Chinese restaurant. Added to my faves, definitely making it again!

This marinade was quick, easily and extremely delicious on chicken breast. I only used one garlic clove because I ran out but added a little garlic powder to substitute. I also didn't have sesame oil but had sesame dressing which worked perfect. Marinated for 8 hours then threw it on the BBQ. My in-laws made their famous Guamanian marinade for chicken and this recipe was the winner!!!! Will def be making again.

Very, very good. Have done this a hand full of times now. Used on thighs, legs, and breasts - bone in/out, skin on/off - baked and grilled. Good every time. Tried on steak too, works to change things up, is better on chicken. Haven't really made any changes to recipe.

I was only able to marinate my boneless chicken breasts for about 2 hours, but, wow! This was a big hit with my family. We will definitely put this in the rotation. Thanks for a great marinade.

This is the best marinade for chicken! I lessened the vinegar by a 1/4 of a cup because I know my family's taste. The rest of the ingredients together was phenomenal. I marinaded chicken tenderloin in a ziploc baggie all day, and have the best grilled chicken.

Loved this recipe! Was looking for a quick tasty marinade and this worked! I didn't have time to marinade for 2 hours so I just did for 30 mins and then put the chicken in the BBQ.   I continually marinated with a brush while it was in the BBQ and this turned out delicious.  I didn't have sesame oil but I substituted with a little coconut oil. I'm not a chef so I'm not sure if that's a no no but it tasted delicious. Thanks! For sharing this.

Loved this marinade!  It added a great deal of flavor to my chicken tenders.  I knew there was more marinade than what I needed, so I saved some before adding it to the raw chicken.  My husband basted with it as it cooked and we added it to the chicken on our plates.  Very good and I would most definitely make it again.  We enjoyed this chicken with hash browns made in a waffle iron and salad.

I was looking for a quick, easy marinade for chicken tonight and am so glad I found this one! So easy to make, and all the ingredients were in the cupboard. After reading the reviews, the only change I made was 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce just in case it might be too salty for our tastes. I used boneless, skinless breasts and let them marinate for about 3 hours. My hubby grilled the chicken to perfection on the BBQ. The whole family loved it. The kids said this is the best BBQ chicken we've ever made!  Thanks Krystal!

I really liked this marinade. I made 1/2 recipe, because I didn't have that many chicken breasts and let it sit for about 1 hour in it. I thought all of the flavors blended well together, with none really dominating. It was a nice change from the Italian dressing marinade I typically do, which sometimes can come off as too sweet. This didn't.

An excellent and easy marinade.  I followed the recipe as written (except that I used grapeseed oil instead of olive) and marinated boneless, skinless chicken breasts for 4 hours.  The chicken was moist, flavourful and looked wonderful after it was BBQ'd.  Highly recommended.

Made this yesterday just as it's written...good recipe, was a tad salty even with low sodium soy sauce, but I'm really sensitive to the salt since I don't use it much anymore...husband said it was good, and he's the one who needs to be happy...:)

Very good on beef. I made a little jar of it for ease of use. *update* I made it again and cooked the chicken in my cast iron skillet and I actually prefer it that way. The caramelized sugar is so good! I also boiled the rest of the marinade in a separate sauce pan and drizzled a little on the finished chicken. Definitely making this marinade again!!

The aroma was tantalizing!  I only marinated for an hour and a half due to time crunch for dinner.  Other than that, I didn't change a single thing.
 I served it with brown rice that I'd minced small bits of pineapple, mango and mint into.  I added some aged hard cider to the leftover marinade and made a demi-glaze to pour over the rice and my guests really loved it.
  I'm saving this marinade recipe. Other reviewers have used it on other meats and I'm going to do that as well.  Thank you so much for such a simple and well balanced, elegant marinade!

WOW!!!  Fantastic!!!  I used 2/3 cup of balsamic, 1/4 cup of soy sauce, and sprinkled in the black pepper.  We let chicken sit in marinade for an hour and 15 minutes and then my husband grilled the chicken!  Sooooo good!  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!

This is a great marinade.  We used all olive oil instead of sesame, and it still turned out very moist and flavorful after grilling.

This was a seriously a delicious marinade.  I did not have Balsamic Vinegar so I left it out and it was still delicious.  I marinated the chicken in a zip lock bag for about 5 hours and it was excellent, this is my new go to marinade for chicken.

We were looking for a good marinade for chicken and stopped looking after we tried this one.  I like to leave it in the marinade for 24 hours and then grill it up.  When using only one package of chicken I cut the recipe in half so we don't waste it.

This was so good!  And so easy!  The only thing I changed was using minced garlic instead of chopped, because it was all I had.  I had everything else already on hand.. This was like a sweety teryaki flavor..  Everyone loved it.  A definite keeper - go to marinade!  Thanks Krystal!

This is a good start for a marinade, but the sheer amount of sesame oil in this is completely overpowering.  It's all I could taste.

In our version, we halved the Worcestershire, sugar, sesame, & garlic. We used Braggs liquid aminos as soy sauce & subbed grape seed oil for olive (grape handles the high temps better.) The combo was delicious, even with the milder flavor.

Yum, yum, yum!  Definitely using this marinade again!  I only marinated (whole chicken legs) for about 4 hours and they were delicious.  Next time I would like to marinate for at least 8 hours or overnight.

I make a couple of really good chicken marinades but my husband informed me tonight that this is his favorite.  It was really good - my 4-yr old stepson asked me to fix it tomorrow night too.  I am quite sure this will be a family regular!  Followed the recipe exactly and let it marinate for 6 hours.

We loved this marinade!  I marinated chicken for about an hour before throwing it on the grill.  Even my son, who is a picky eater, asked for seconds.  I didn't use the whole 1/2 cup of soy sauce that the recipe calls for because I ran out, it was closer to 1/3.  I will definitely be making this one again!

This is also great on a mix of veggies done up on the bbq. I use a bbq basket and put in onions, peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, what ever your family likes.  Marinate for a couple of hours and grill!!

THE best marinade ever, just as is!  Sometimes I increase garlic or add ginger.  I also reduce sesame  oil, slightly.  I marinade 24 hrs or longer, with great results.  But I am sure that a shorter time would be fine too.  Sometimes I use boneless/skinless thighs and breasts and shorten cooking time.  Everybody in my world loves this recipe!  Give it a try!

This marinade is amazing. 
And I do 2 different things.
I add a splash of mustard.
I also cook it to bring it to a boil.
That seems to blend everything a little bit better.

I didn't have enough balsamic vinegar - about 3/4 of the 1/2 cup required - so I added a balsamic vinegar dressing to meet the requirement... I really liked it with chicken legs, which I marinated for like 20 hours straight... My guess is that this marinade would be a killing with chicken wings.... :)

Amazing, followed directions x 15 for a event and everyone love the taste and texture. I marinated for 10 hours. Be careful with the flare up as there is a lot of oil....nice a crunchy skin

I made it as is and added one pressed garlic clove. Marinated for about 9 hours.  Easy and very good.

I've made this twice (with the same batch of marinade, it makes quite a lot - reserved half for my second try). The first time I marinated skin-on chicken pieces for a few hours and grilled it. It was good but not a game changer. The second time I poked a bunch of holes in the chicken before marinating, then baked it in the oven with some of the liquid in the pan, flipping it occasionally. IMO this was much better,  far more flavourful. I will make again, but might add some fresh minced ginger.

Only my second time ever grilling chicken. My kids said it was the best grilled chicken they've ever had! I am by all means not even close to a good cook so the fact that this was quick and easy helped. I was strapped for time so only let it marinate for roughly 1 1/2 hours. The taste was great!

This was very quick, easy, and absolutely delicious. I eyeballed the measurements, added some onion powder, and used honey instead of brown sugar. I let the chicken marinate for 24 hours, and i couldn't have asked for better results. I'll definitely make this again.

As noted, nice & easy with a very rewarding  taste. 
Used bone in thighs, & though unplanned they marinated for a day & were delicious. Took the recommendation  of the Sesame noodles as an accompaniment.

Yummy.  I used this with boneless chicken thighs and cooked them on the stovetop.  I cooked the leftover marinade down and used it as a drizzle sauce on the chicken.  No changes necessary.  Thank you for sharing.

Just as good as I suspected it would be! Can't go wrong with brown sugar. My family loved the chicken I broiled in this marinade! Can't wait to make it again! Did not have balsamic vinegar but was able to sub red wine vinegar/white sugar. Awesome recipe!

Wow!!!!! I was skeptical of this recipe. But my oh my! I used half the brown sugar and half the soy sauce for 6 thighs and 8 legs. We marinated the chicken for 4 hours and basted with KC bbq sauce halfway through grilling. Needless to say...we had it for dessert too!

I took a whole chicken cut out the backbone and filet the chicken carcass so it sits flat on the BBQ then marinade and inject the marinade under the skin and into the meat then let marinade for four hours 
I will be having it this way again

I couldn't find my Worcestershire sauce and left the vinegar out so my boys would eat it. I also sautÃ©ed the garlic with a little chopped onion in canola oil (what I had available) let it cool, drained it( again, so my boys would eat).  It turned out fabulous and definitely the juiciest chicken I've ever grilled. I didn't have time to soak the chicken longer than 20 minutes either.

This was a nice, flavorful marinade!  Looking at the recipe, I thought it sounded like a ton of marinade, and it was.  I halved it for 4 chicken breast and it was still too much, could have easily quartered it.  It was cold that evening, so I decided to just cook these up inside on my cast iron grill pan.  It was perfect topped onto a salad, with a balsamic honey dressing drizzled all over :)  Will make again!

DELICIOUS! I made this for my husband and parents and even my Dad asked me what I put in the marinade. I didn't have sesame oil but I did have sesame seeds, which I added. Sooooooo good! I will definitely make this again.

I just used Apple cider vinegar because my Husband doesn't like Balsamic vinegar. It still tasted very good. So far we used it with Chicken Breast and Beef Short Ribs. Both tasted very good. Will try Pork later this week.

Used this recipe on meat-free chicken and it was amazing! Moist, juicy and SO much flavor. I also reduced some of the marinade and drizzled it over grilled asparagus.  Excellent as well. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was really good. Didn't have a lot of chicken, so took half the marinade and simmered it down to thicken a bit, then added sautÃ©ed mushrooms and green onions to it and served it as a sauce with the chicken. Great flavor combination, will be making this again.

Made this the other day. Followed the recipe exactly. Used thighs and legs on a gas grill. The best marinade ever! Even my husband who slathers BBQ on everything didn't use any. I was surprised! A keeper!

I used this marinade for a party I threw with my girlfriend. I marinaded thighs and wings over night and threw them on the grill the next night. Amazing results people were saying they couldn't stop eating the chicken, and wanted the recipe. I must have printed out 6 or 7 copies of this recipe for friends and family, I will be using this again.

My all time favorite for boneless turkey breasts, chicken and pork. Marinade atleast 24 hrs. Pierce turkey breast insert garlic slices all over. I double the garlic in marinade. The soy sauce adds a perfect amount of salt and flavor

I made this for chicken breast sandwiches with Tyson tenderized boneless chicken breasts. Did I mention it was for 30 people?!?!? I doubled the recipe and left out the sesame oil because I didn't have it and my guests raved about the chicken! It stole the show! I'm so glad I found this recipe:) I was going for a bbq chicken sandwich, but this has a bit of a teriyaki kick which made the guests want the recipe. We served them on regular hamburger buns and onion buns along with mayo, bbq, ketchup, mustard, lettuce, red onion, and leaf lettuce. Perfect feast!

Delicious. I was initially afraid this would taste too much like soy, but it turned out quite tasty, imparting excellent flavor to generally favorless boneless/ skinless chicken breasts.

Absolutely delicious, flexible recipe....... adjust brown sugar and or balsamic vinegar for different flavors as well as the duration you let it marinate for. Great sliced up on salads or chicken burgers!

I made this for a Birthday Party at in-laws house(no pressure). Cooked it slowly over charcoal and was fantastic!!! Everyone loved it!! I am forwarding this recipe to all who were there. Only things I changed was to use a lite soy, splenda brown sugar and to use a rosemary flavored olive oil. The reason I changed the first 2 were for health reasons of folks at party.

Like others have stated, this recipe is a bit flat and doesn't have much of a taste. I added 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup molasses, and it's now wonderful!

Awesome marinade. Quick and easy. I used it on chicken, and then again with beef kabobs. Flavour absorbs quickly. No need to marinade for several hours.

Just grilled chicken thighs after marinating for about 5 hours. This marinade is outstanding as is. Didn't change a thing. Will use this recipe many more times.

It's not often that I'm so at odds with a highly rated recipe. My family did not care for this marinade at all. In spite of the variety of ingredients (or perhaps because of) it tasted quite flat and didn't complement the chicken at all.

Very tasty marinade! I did use low sodium soy sauce and bumped up the balsamic vinegar to 3/4 cup.  Allowed chicken breasts to marinate for 4 hrs.  Perfect!

An absolute keeper!  The only so-called adjustment I made was to use Lite Soy Sauce, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  The marinade is powerful, but the result is mild and very tasty!  I thought the flavors blended perfectly, ours wasn't overpowered by the sesame oil.  I think next time I will bake in the oven, though, as my barbecue grill gets too hot, burning the marinade before the chicken is done.  This is an outstanding recipe!  Thank you for sharing!

This was an awesome recipe!  I do not have any leftovers :)  The only changes I made were I cut the brown sugar and soy sauce in half and I didnt have any sesame seed oil so I left that out.  It was a huge hit, I will definately make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly except for the sesame oil, which I didn't have. It was fantastic! The chicken was so so tender and very full of flavor. A little saltier than I usually cook, but such a tasty treat, it was worth the extra sodium. :) Our guests had thirds!! We didn't have a single bite of chicken left over.

I just tried this recipe on steak. It works so well. We had a sirloin steak and poked it with a fork both sides. I marinaded it for 2 1/2 hrs., and it came out so juicy that you didn't even need steak sauce. The well done pieces also came out tasty that my son who prefers chicken and doesn't really like steak, loved this one. The steaks that were not even cooked with a sear, came out delicious. I will next time try not to get too much marinade in the pan, so that I can get a sear. The last steak had a sear and my oldest son was exceptionally pleased. I got so many thank you for cooking, and it was so easy.

Awesome chicken, very moist. I marinated for about an hour and it was still awesome. When grilling use the marinade to keep basting so it stays moist.

This was just okay.  I marinaded chicken breast tenderloins overnight (over 24 hours) and then grilled them on a george foreman grill.  The chicken didn't have much flavor.  I was hoping for a stronger flavor I guess.

Used this recipe to marinate some chicken cabobs for grilling.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it needs to marinate for a long time.  Definitely not something that you can just throw together and grill, but tasted good.  I would use it again.

This marinade is so good.  I left out the sesame oil.  The chicken had so much flavor.  This will be my go to marinade.  Thanks for sharing!

Great marinade!  I used half to make a smaller batch, a little less soya sauce. Added about 3 tbsp of fresh grated ginger and 1/4 tsp of hickory smoke powder. This will be a marinade that I will make many times for sure!  Thanks for posting it :)

Good Marinade, not fantastic. I was worried since I put it in the fridge the night before it would be too salty but it turned out really good. I will keep this and use it again! Thanks Krystal!

This was delicious! Made it for my mothers birthday and it was such a hit! Even my two year old, who almost never touches meat, gobbled down almost an entire breast herself. I didn't have any sesame oil on hand, but I don't think it really mattered. I will most definitely be making this again.

I really liked this! Easy marinade and if you boil the marinade afterwards it makes a great sauce.  I also want to mention that I did not grill my chicken with this marinade.  I baked it in the oven with some olive-oil/herb drizzled potatoes.  It was really delicious and the potatoes were fabulous! I still used the marinade (reheated) as a sauce over the chicken, and I also put some on some steamed carrots, which was delicious, too! That's how I prepared this dish :)

Wow! Awesome! I marinated flatened chicken for 6 hours. I cooked on medium heat, basted with marinade also. I downsized the soy sauce and  balsamic vinegar to 1/3 of a cup and I used 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. This was one awesome recipe! Will definitely use again.

Awesome marinade.  I didn't have the sesame oil on hand and replaced it with red wine vinegar and it came out perfect.  I made chicken and pineapple kabobs and used the marinade as a baste while grilling.  Fantastic.

YUMMY!  I tried a little less brown sugar like another reviewer.  Also used canola oil instead of sesame because I didn't have any.  Made the chicken juice and wonderful!

This was very good! I had to sub. white balsamic for the regular(i was out of regular).  I marinated overnight and the flavor was good but strong - next time I will try it for 8 hours.
