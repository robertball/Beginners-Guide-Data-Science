I sometimes add a packet of Sazon Goya con Azafran to this recipe if it is seeming a little lifeless.  It is a nice switch up from the basic recipe.  Additionally, a shot of powdered garlic or onion is often added.

This recipe is fantastic & authentic.  I agree that  Pork is an absolute necessity for Cuban Black Beans.  I'll often use a smoked pork foot.  If folks want more spice, it's easy to add.  I wouldn't rate this recipe down for that. It's nice to have a slow cooker option for us working woman.

I thought this recipe was quite flavorful.  I cut the serving size to 4 as I was only cooking 1 cup of dried beans.  I also hot soaked the beans first (boil 3-4 minutes then let sit in water for 3 hours).  Didn't have the annato seeds, and omitted the olives based on personal tastes.  Used all dry herbs except the cilantro.

I love this recipe however, altered it a little. I include a jalape√±o with the onion and omit the olives, parsley and achiote seeds. We love heat in the south so I also add hot sauce. Even my boyfriend who doesn't care for beans loves this recipe. I serve them with yellow rice and homemade pico (diced tomatoes and onions with garlic and cilantro in lime juice) topped with sour cream. yum!

I love black beans & I thought the concept of this dish was interesting. I followed the directions exactly. It was a very bland dish. I added some hot sauce which helped. I am not going add this to my recipe box. Sorry.

Bland and I added Goyan Sazon packet, and used all the fresh ingredients.  Something definetly got lost in the sauce.  I added so much fresh salsa to kick it up I lost all of what little flavor was there.  Too much liquid even though I followed the recipe exactly.

I made this recipe as is because I wanted the 'Cuban' flavor. This was not a huge hit with the family. They grinned and bore it. Everybody thought it was too spicy. So, with the left overs I poured some condensed milk over the dish and then grated some sharp cheese to top it off. The milk cut the spice down and the cheese . . . well, cheese makes everything better!!!

Pretty good, but needed some tweaking to please my preferences.  Had to add more garlic.  Don't care for pimento-stuffed olives so I omitted them.  Added some diced tomato and red bell pepper.  Served over Saffron Rice (customized by Bill).  Will definitely be making this again!

such a flavorful dish!  i made a simplified and smaller version of this recipe without the meat and achiote seeds.  used dried herbs instead of fresh, and balsamic vinegar in lieu of lime juice, and added a a tsp of liquid smoke.  the beans cooked down to a rich black sauce.  soooo good and sooo easy.
