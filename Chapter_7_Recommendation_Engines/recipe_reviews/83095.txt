I've made this recipe several times and I just love it. I did omit the raisins b/c I have this thing with hot raisins. I also used tumeric in lieu of saffron as someone else suggested. This is a regular at our house. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a very good recipe.  The raisins were a great addition, and the curry was just enough to give some flavor but not turn it into a "curry" dish.  Served it with rice, steamed veggies, and bread.  Family enjoyed it. I'll make it again.

I really enjoyed this recipe, and so did my family. We didn't have white wine, so I substituted sake. I also used about a 1/4 tsp of tumeric instead of saffron threads, because I simply can't afford the saffron. My mother complained that I didn't use enough salt. I told her to add her own! ;)

Pretty easy to make, all things considered. Came out a lot sweeter than I thought and than I liked. There was too much liquid after I added the wine, so I ended up boiling it uncovered for 15-20 min. I liked the saffron flavor. Overall, a good dish, but again just too sweet for me.

A very tasty and easy recipe.  Try adding 1/3 cup brown sugar to the flour in the coating.  Adds a sweet kick that is surprising and good.

Sooo delicious. Came together very quickly also. I did not have shallots, but did use more garlic. Also instead of two cups white wine, I used one cup of white cooking wine and one of homemade turkey broth. I did not cover while simmering, my sauce was still soupy a bit, but delicious. Loved the raisins, will make this again...

Wonderful!  Only change I made was 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of chopping my own.  Hubby and I were both impressed and will DEFINITELY make it again! 
Enough sauce to serve over brown rice or quinoa too- thank you for this one!

Chicken was very juicy, but I expected more flavor.  The rice complimented the entree nicely, although I added extra curry powder for additional flavor.  Next time I'll add the curry powder to the chicken during the coating stage; also going to add more salt and pepper during the process in order to improve the flavor.  Overall, it was easy and something I'd be willing to make again.  I rate this 3.5 stars.
