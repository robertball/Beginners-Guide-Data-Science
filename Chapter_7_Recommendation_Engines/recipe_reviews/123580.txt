I know these are basic and that everyone out there has made these with just the noodles, butter, and cheese. But adding the couple extra ingredients here really changes the dish into something you can actually serve adults and not just picky kids.

Good, easy side dish.  I put the butter out to soften in a serving bowl about 30 minutes before dinner, and then added the parm and onions while I was boiling the pasta.  The hot (drained) pasta on top of the butter melted it completely and it all came together nicely.  I used whole wheat egg noodles and served this with Crispy Baked Basa, (fish) from this site, along with a salad.

I didn't like this recipe at all. There was a true lack of flavor, even after trying to boost it a bit with extra garlic and some sauteed onions

This was very good and simple to make. I was looking for something different than just regular mac & cheese. This is really good. I made it with large shells since that's all I had, and it was still good. Served it with the "Pork chops in Tomato Sauce" recipe. Thanks!

This was really good for being so simple. I did add a little zesty Italian dressing to it because it was a little dry, but after that, very nice. Thanks for the idea!

This was pretty good.  I used mini bow-tie pasta and omitted the green onion.  When I added the parmesan cheese it got really thick, so I added some milk to make it creamier, just enough to stir it with ease.  I think next time some fresh basil would add a nice touch.

I used fresh shredded parm cheese and it was fabulous. It wasn't dry at all. My whole picky family loved it too! Definitely a keeper in my house.

I have been doing this for years. You can also put in small pieces of meat, any kind really. I have used bacon bits, spam, flavored tuna and canned chicken. It is also really good mixed with mashed potatos with minced garlic, italian seasoning and creamy italian cheese. Also very good with mixed veggies, or broccoli, cauliflower, peas and carrots. This is so simple and easy to make your own. Take a chance and make it with ingredients you love!

I thought they were great! I used fresh grated parmesan which I think really made the difference. My kids didn't care for the green onions so I'll probably leave them out next time or substitute broccoli for it.

My rating is more of a 3.5 than an actual 3.  As far as ease of preparation 4, but when it was all said and done I needed a lot more parmesan and threw in quite a few other spices laying around to liven it up.

Grumpy makes this but calls it Bachelor's Pasta.  Garlic is added to the recipe, a bit more butter than called for here and we always use salted butter - not margarine, preference in taste.  No onions here either but we do sprinkle it with parsley to give it a bit of color!

Easy but not as good as I had hoped. I followed the recipe exactly as written and felt the noodles were too dry and needed more butter. Also I thought it was bland but with  the garlic salt and pepper to taste thats probably my fault I should have added more seasoning. I will make these again but try with more butter or possibly 1/2c to 1c of chicken broth so that it isnt as dry.

We all love this.  Great when you need something quick and easy (and you're tired of the ole baked potato).  We add some chopped walnuts to it and sometimes substitute olive oil for the butter.

Awesome served with stuffed tomatoes. I added some chopped bell peppers and celery for an added crunchy texture. I also threw in about 4 leaves of fresh chopped basil. It really added alot more flavor and made the recipe alot more interesting.

this was a tasty and simple alternative to a packaged noodle side dish.  4 instead of 5 stars because I cut the amt. of parmesan down to about 1/3 cup and added a tbsp. of butter.  I think it needed it.

I made this as a side dish to grilled chicken the other night.  As other reviewers suggested, I added more butter (doubled it), but I still wasn’t getting the creaminess I was after.  So I added a little milk, but that didn’t help either.  Maybe heavy cream would have been a better choice.  This was ok, but not what I had hoped for.

We LOVE this for a simple side or a light main dish served w/ salad! I found this recipe yeas backin a Taste of Home Magazine...not the this is really anything new (we've been making buttered noodles FOREVER), but the green onions really set this apart from the usual. I use more butter, but that's a personal preference~YUM! :)

This was soooo simple yet so delicious!  I had garlic salt that I added to the cheese before I tossed it.

Quite good, and exceptionally easy. Kind of reminds you of fetuccini alfredo. I sauteed the green onions in butter with some sliced mushrooms, and also tossed everything with steamed broccoli and cauliflower to make it more of a "one dish" meal. Yum!

A decent and easy side dish. I added some frozen peas for a little something extra.

This was a very easy and tasty recipe. I did not add the green onion but I am sure they add great flavor to the recipe. I will make this again.

I,m only giving this  3 stars as I think it tasted rather bland -- just as it's called--noodles and parmesan. I would probably never make again.

Didn't have green onions, substituted with parsley & a few pepper flakes. Topped with crushed ritz crackers.
