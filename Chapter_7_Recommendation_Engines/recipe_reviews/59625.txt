This recipe was so good, everyone in my family loved it. I used boneless pork chops. They were so tender they fell apart in your mouth. I did put the sweet potatoes in at the beginning because I can never get them completely cooked otherwise. The apple pie filling disappeared, so you didn't even know it was in there when you were eating it. Everyone in my family enjoyed this.

This was great. Everyone in my family liked it. I couldn't find apple pie filling and so used an apple & cranberry pie filling. I also put the sweet potatoes in at the beginning (in small chunks) and they were very soft at the end.

Great recipe.  It was very easy.  I used about half a can of chicken broth.  If you cook this recipe, don't count on eating the apples as a side dish.  However, they flavor the meat SO good.  I will definitely make this recipe again and again.

I have made this recipe several times.  My family just loves it.  It is so easy and delicious.  The one thing I would suggest, make sure you have sweet potatoes, not yams.  Yams (orange) make it sweeter than it needs to.  The sweet potatoes (yellow) have a less sweet taste to them.  You can also slice them leaving the skins on and place them on top to cook.  They stay togethe much better and the skins can be easily taken off before eating (though they actually taste pretty good).

LOVED this recipe !!!  In fact, I'm here adjusting the recipe to feed 10 people this weekend.

As someone else had suggest, I did add the sweet potatos right from the beginning.  

Recipe is easy and your house smells "delish" all afternoon.

This was a good recipe. We did a lot of adjustments though.  We didn't brown the meat first, just threw it in frozen and it was very tasty and tender.  I used 3 granny smith apples sliced, 2 large golden potatoes, 1/2 c apple juice and some nutmeg and cinnamon.

Very good and easy but lacked some flavor.  I added a little apple juice to boost the apple flavor, otherwise very good the whole family enjoyed it.

For all of the ingredients and trouble to put this together, the end result in flavor wasn't worth it.  However, the chops were tender, only because I did not brown the chops for the full 5 minutes on each side.  It's better to brown for about 2 min on each side and then let them finish cooking in the crock pot.  I probably will not make this one again.

This was a great recipe!  I'm new to cooking and my boyfriend loved it!  My only suggestion is that when you go to put the potatoes in - make sure to get them down in the liquid so they will cook thoroughly.  As I added the potatoes I arranged it so the pork chops were on top of the potatoes.  This helped cook them faster and filled them with all the flavors of the yummy juices.  I've recommended this one to everyboyd I know!  Thanks!

this was very good and very easy to make.  i added my own spices to pork chops; thyme and sage; red pepper flakes to add some heat to the sweet.  next time i will do as directions say and add sweet potatoes later as they did get mushy, but still tasty.

I cooked on high for 3 hours and added the potatoes at the start.  The potatoes were very soft and on the verge of disintegration.  Very tasty.  I also make a similar recipe using whole berry cranberry sauce instead of the canned apple

This one flopped for my family.  Lots of leftovers...  The chops were tender, but not very flavorful.  The sweet potatoes either needed longer than 1  1/2 hours or to be cut in smaller pieces; they were  still pretty firm.

I'm going to give this 3 stars because it is a good base recipe, but needs a little bit of help in the flavor department.  Here's what I did to tweak it.  I added a can of frozen apple juice concentrate to improve the flavor and a couple of tsps of cinnamon.  I used half a can of chicken broth instead of 2 tbs of chicken soup base.    I cut the pork into bites during the last half hour of cooking to give this more of a pork stew kind of feel.  I also added 2 tsp of cold water to 2 tsp of cornstarch, stirred it until it was smooth and added it to the crock pot.  This thickened the sauce up quite nicely.  I served it over rice and my husband said it tasted like a sweet and sour pork dish.  It was much better with these changes but not something that we will make again.

I have to agree with the other people who felt this dish lacked flavor.  I really thought the apple pie filling would add some great flavor to this recipe; but, it did not.  I don't think we will be making this dish again.

I added choppped red pepper, a little salsa and sliced zucchini and about a 1/2 cup of water for a better gravy. The veggies and gravy was very good, but the meat was disappointingly bland. I don't know why, but I felt the meat needed something more. The next day I made a pot of rice to go with the veggies and gravy and it was great.

Very yummy! I browned the porkchops with allspice & brown sugar since alot of the reviews said the pork needed more flavor. I also took the advice of others & put the sweet potatoes in at the beginning. Excellent! Next time will add more pork!!

Decided to make this despite seeing questionable reviews. Pork is juicy but had no flavor-maybe marinating it next time would help. I would make something based on this in the future, but change it drastically.

We did not care for the combination of tastes.  Pork was tender and Sweet potatoes were good with the apples.  Other than that - would not bother making again.

Cooked this tonight and it was awesome!  The porkchops are so tender we did not use knives, and the flavor is sweet and hearty.  This would be a great dinner to kick off harvest/autumn time!

My husband thought this was good "bland food for days when you're sick."  I didn't like this at all - far too sweet and not much flavor otherwise.  If we make this again, I'll dice some fresh apples, add seasonings (apple pie spice + cayenne + ?), toss in the juice of one lemon and some brown sugar instead of the canned filling.  The onions had a good flavor, but the sweet potatoes didn't soften even after 2 1/2 hours in the Crock Pot on high.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I forgot to brown the pork chops first, but it didn't matter.  It was like a rich, hearty stew.  The pork was very tender and falling apart.  Yummy!

We loved this recipe.  My husband could not stop complimenting dinner, and I felt guilty because it was so easy.  Next time I might 1) trim some of the fat from the meat before cooking and 2) add some real cut up apples in with the potatoes.

This recipe is pretty easy, but I made it for 8 servings. Tasted amazing! I added the sweet potatoes in at the halfway point, 3hrs. Unfortunately they did not cook all the way. Next time I would add them from the beginning.

Great, savory recipe! I loved the flavor and tenderness; my boyfriend actually added bacon which made it even better!

Slight change....omit the sweet potatoes and after browning the pork chops, you can bake them in the oven for the same effect.  Mom made this for us and tastes like it took all day!

Very tasty and a nice fall/winter comfort meal! I made the following adjustments: Used chicken broth instead of base, used two Gala apples, unpeeled, cored and sliced, sprinkled thyme and brown sugar on pork chops, layered the apples on top, sprinkled more brown sugar, layered slices of unpeeled sweet potatoes. Poured more chicken broth over all. Cooked 6 hrs on low, basted with juices from bottom twice during cooking. Delicious!

I changed the canned apples to fresh apples and added a glove of garlic and about 3/4 tsp brown sugar.

I doubled this recipe and it was delicious! I watch my granddaughter ( she just turned 3 ) 2 days a week and on one of those days we "cook" together and make a meal for her family. She loves it. I have been doing this for several months and I always pick a slow cooker recipe from here. I double them now so I have some dinner to take home for me and this one worked fine. Did follow others advice and put the sweet potatoes in with skins on and cooked them for 2 hours. My daughter told me her family loved it - even her son who is a somewhat picky eater. Just yummy!

This is literally probably the best meal I have ever made. Made this one a few times to perfect the recipe, and I have tweaked it quite a bit. The following is for 10 pork chops. Season the pork with mix of 4 teaspoons salt, 2 teaspoons paprika, 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon onion powder, 1 teaspoon ground thyme/oregano, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1.5 teaspoons ground black pepper. Seal in bags and put in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours to allow the seasoning to set into the meat. Prepare a dredge mix of 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon salt, 1/2 tablespoon seasoning salt, 1/2 tablespoon celery salt, 1/2 tablespoon pepper, 1 tablespoon dry mustard, 2 tablespoons paprika, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, 1 tablespoon onion powder. Dredge each piece of pork thoroughly on both sides and edges and brown in a pan of hot olive oil and butter. Cook each side until nice and brown (~1 min each side) and place in the slow cooker with one layer of the veggies below and the rest above and around the chops. The veggies to add to the slow cooker should be celery, onion, carrots and sliced apples (instead of apple pie filling, and yes, I realize apples are not veggies). Pour 2 tablespoons of chicken broth over everything and cook on low for 7 hours. Then prepare to have your mind blown!

This was a good dish. The family liked it.  I used bone-in pork chops, peeled and cut into wedges Gala apples (3), Dijon mustard, honey, salt & pepper in the slow cooker. Cooked on low for 6-7 hours and reserved the left over for another recipe.

This recipe is good. The meat came out really tender and it taste good. The next time I make it I will try white potatoes though. I followed the directions to the letter. It's a nice comfort food for cold weather, cheap and filling.

Simple and great.  I doubled the recipe and added half sweet potatoes and half red potatoes since my son doesn't like sweet potatoes.  It was simple and turned out great.  We loved it.

I was very disappointed in the flavor of this dish.  It had very little flavor and although apples usually go well with sweet potatoes in this recipe the sweet potatoes did not blend well with the other ingredients.

this recipe sounded so good to me. i knew i wasn't going to use the sweet potatoes with it, but have fried potatoes instead. the meat as very tender, but the taste was so awful... but in all fairness, maybe omitting the sweet potatoes missed blending all the flavors.i don't care for sweet potatoes,and if that is what makes this recipe work, i won't be trying this recipe ever again. one star is more than generous without the sweet potatoes!
