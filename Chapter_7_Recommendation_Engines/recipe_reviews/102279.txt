Didn't add nuts.  Shaved and chopped chocolate instead of using chips.  Was easy to make and was an excellent dessert.  Will make it again next year.

This was better than our family recipe. I added almost a tablespoon of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and was liberal with the cinnamon sugar. (I keep on hand (special, such as Ceylon or Fancy Vietnamese [from Penzey's Spices]) cinnamon sugar made with 2/3 cinnamon and 1/3 sugar. 

Per our family receipe, when the cooking time was complete, I pulled out the cookie sheets and turned each cookie on its side and baked for 10 more minutes. Then the same on the other side. This makes them extra crunchy and substantial tasting.

I know that mandel bread is traditional on Passover, but I made this this morning for our Rosh Hoshanah celebration tomorrow. My first time making it, but I've always loved it. Followed the recipe exactly except for sugar. Used splenda instead due to dietary restrictions; also used flour and corn starch because it's not Passover. These are great. I did slice them and put them back in the oven with the oven off for 10 minutes, because I know they usually are baked twice. Great recipe. Will go into my rotation, provided the rest of the family loves them as much as hubby and I. Happy New Year!

I have been making this EVERY year since I found the recipe here over 5 years ago.  I follow the recipe exactly except that I leave out the nuts (allergies here), and I check it after 18 minutes to make sure it's not getting too brown.  It is delicious every single time I make it, and always the favorite dessert.  I know people say "this doesn't taste like Passover food" all the time but this absolutely does NOT taste like Passover food!
