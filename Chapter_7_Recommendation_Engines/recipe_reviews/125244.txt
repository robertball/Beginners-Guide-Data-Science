This was great, I used 2 bunches of broccoli instead of using the cauliflower because my family doesn't eat it. This was sooo goood. Thanks.

I blanched the broccoli and cauliflower before combining into salad.  I also omitted bacon (for vegetarians' pleasure), used red peppers not tomatoes.  Used a few tablespoons of brown sugar and rice vinegar.  Good recipe for expanding to cook's taste.  Thanks.

This is a very colorful and great tasting salad.  Made this today instead of my usual salad.  If it is too sweet for your taste, reduce the amount of sugar.  I added the bacon in last to keep it crunchy.  Next time, I'm going to mix in sharp cheddar cheese.  Enjoy!

This was fantastic! Hubby loved it and asked for seconds. Wouldn't change a thing. Nice mix a sweetness from the dressing and tang from the onion. Will make again. This will be great for picnics, parties etc. Thanks!

Subbed avocado for the mayo and was surprised how much I liked this. Also, using green onions in place of white is a must!
