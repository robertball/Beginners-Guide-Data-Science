This was a great meal.  I added 1/2 lb browned sausage, to make it more hearty.  Husband loved it, will definitely make this again.

Nice start for a pasta recipe. I used macoroni instead of twists since it was all I had. I'm not sure if the pasta shape affected it or not, but I had to add a can of plain tomato sauce to make it less dry. I also used a different sauce since I don't like Prego.

It didnt taste as great as I thought it would. And the croutons are better left on the side if you want them to stay crunchy.

The best thing about this is its easy... I used Francesco Rinaldi sweet and tasty tomato sauce instead of prego (you can find it at your local grocery HEB, SUPER WALMART) made it taste very good...also if you want crunchy curtons wait after the cheese is melted to add them

This was good although next time I think i will go with a different sauce. The prego was just too tangy.

This would be good as a spagetti bake. Try the meat sauce and canned mushrooms.

I was surprised at how good this was. I had to use different brands, but the ingredients were the same. I liked the flavour of the croutons. It was also really quick to cook and easy to clean up. It great as it is, but it would also be good as a base.

Not very good! Husband didnt like it. Kinda of bland. We saved it for the next day and added cheddar cheese and a little salsa to give it some more taste. But will not make again.

It was alright, not very flavorful but filling enough. It helps if you scatter breadcrumbs on top and my boyfriend added hot sauce and extra croutons.

Boring but simple recipe. On a plus side this recipe is easy to triple or more for buffet style entertainment.
