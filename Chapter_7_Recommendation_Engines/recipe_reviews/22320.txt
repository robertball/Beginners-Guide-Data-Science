These turned out great but i do agree that once i first iced them, they were kind of "blah" looking. I had some mini gingerbread men and christmas tree sprinkles and with this addition, they looked beautiful. These squares require patience when cutting them in order to get the perfect looking square. I froze mine slightly prior to cutting it.  I also did not have a food processor, but i used my pampered chef chopper and it did the cherries and nuts perfectly.  Great addition to my christmas baking.

Sweet, buttery and rich, rich, RICH! So sweet my husband said it made his teeth "tingle".The shortbread base seemed overdone, I would suggest not waiting for your crust to get to the light brown stage in the first baking step, just go with the 12 minutes realizing that it's going to cook for another 25 minutes. You must definitely wait until the bars are completely cooled to frost or it will be a mess. There is another recipe on this site that I like a lot called "Pink Ladies" that uses a similar frosting for a chocolate base, I think I'd like to try and combine parts of each of these recipes to have a chocolate base with cherry topping.

Mmmm... I saw this recipe & just had to try it... I'm glad I did.  Maybe these weren't the prettiest cookie on my Christmas plates, but they were one of the tastiest!  They are time-consuming with the different steps, but well worth it.

Kids of ALL ages love this recipe! My Sister inlaw has been making this
recipe for over 18 years that I know of, dont know where she origionally
found it, but it is a delicious cookie..my favorite! We also add coconut
to the frosting sometimes. Its best to keep these refridgerated after
they have been frosted, cover them with plastic wrap and they will last
for several days...if they arent eaten up first!  =)  Mine dont last but
a few days..cause they are so yummy!

My husband really, really likes these.  The "crust" can be a little dry if you aren't careful.  Also instead of spreading the frosting I drizzled it in zigzags or other designs and they actually looked quite nice.

I made these this year as part of my Christmas cookies. They were very easy to make, and yieled quite a few cookies. One tip I have is to make sure not to process the cherry mixture in the food processor more than a few seconds, you just want the cherries to get a little chopped up. I made 2 alterations, one was that I forgot I needed the cherry juice and dumped it out, so I just used water in place of it to make a white frosting. The other is that my family doesn't really like nuts, so I just left them out. The bars are pretty sweet, especially with the powdered sugar icing, but they are sooo good and have a great texture with combination of the crust and the cherry layer. Overall, a definite winner. Try this!

I got compliments on these.  I took the advice of another reviewer and drizzled the icing over the bars to make it less sweet.

I completely agree that these taste GREAT... But I also think they aren't very pretty. I made these for Husband to take into work but I changed my mind after seeing the neon pink frosting! I'm not complaining though - they'll be great with a nice cup of mid-afternoon tea! Thanks! (and btw, this is NOT a one star recipe...)

These are really great, and look wonderful on a Christmas Cookie tray. I would definately suggest to double the frosting, and add at least 2 more tablespoons of butter to make it more creamy. I think I am going to try these with almonds next time for variation. I sprinkled red sprinkles on top- and they looked very festive.

These are very good.. I baked the crust for 10 minutes, then after adding the topping, I baked for another 20. I added a little extra cherry juice to the frosting.

I found this recipe in another magazine and decided to give it a try this Christmas season.  Boy, the bars were a huge hit and were usually the first to go on my cookie trays.  They are incredible rick!  The frosting/glaze can be tinkered with.  Great recipe!

I have been making these for years now and every year they get requested.  They are on the sweet side...so cut them small.  I usually freeze them before cutting.

These are delicious bars, easy to make, and a huge hit with my family.  The only thing I changed was to use another tablespoon of butter in the frosting to make it creamier.

These were good. The family liked them more than I did. I was kind of worried when they came out of the oven because it was very brown and the edges had kind of burned, but they tasted good. Not as cherry flavored as I thought.

These bars are absolutely delectable!  My neighbor and I crave them throughout the year!  I happen to have a super sweet tooth, and double the frosting for these.  (Most people find that a bit over the top).  These are must have for my family at Christmas time, but great any time of the year!!

Delicious!  I will definitely make them again.  I probably over baked the crust, it never turned brown.  So they weren't very "gooey" but the flavor was excellent.

Fantastic!  I had trouble frosting my bars so I added another tablespoon of cherry juice to make more of a thick glaze.  I will be making these over & over again - thank you for this wonderful recipe!!

Delicious!  Made it for Memorial Day, so added about a cup of blueberries with the cherries, and made icing using milk instead of cherry juice so that it would not be pink.   Only other change made was to use pecans instead of walnuts based on what I had on hand.    Recipe stands great on its own.  I'll make it again.

Hello I've made this recipe for years,and have always called them Party Pinks. I noticed a problem with this recipe from mine.1/2 cup of flour goes into the batter with the cherries for more of a cake like center. That's why the baking powder is in it.Also if you find this too sweet I add a dash of salt to the frosting which is more creamy depending on amount of cherry juice added. Family favorite for over 40 years.
