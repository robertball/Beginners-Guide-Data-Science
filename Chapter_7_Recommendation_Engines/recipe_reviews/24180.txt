This is so good! Very easy to make, we canned a bunch for Christmas gifts.  I added a can of whole cranberries in sauce, 3 T. diced jalapeno peppers and 1/2 cup brown sugar to each batch I made. Both times I've made this (the original recipe and my version) it didn't thicken on it's own, I added 3 T. corn starch. They're right---this is very addicting!!

This is delicious.  I serve it at cocktail parties and give it as a hostess gift with baked pita chips.  It is probably too spicy for most children, although you can cut back on the red pepper flakes.   ADDICTING!!!

Sweet, spicy, fast, cheap, & easy. Sort of like me:o):o):o) I cut the pepper flakes back to around 1 tsp. & added cornstarch as others did. It isn't even cool yet & half of it's gone. Awesome with cheese or just plain crackers. I will always have this in the fridge. Thank you so much for sharing! Love it!:o)

Very similar to a Harry and David pepper and onion relish I recently tried.  Add 1 cup of this Indian Relish to 8 oz of cream cheese (mix well) and you have an amazing dip to serve with Wheat Thin crackers!!  You can add crushed pineapple or pecans for a different flavor.  This recipe makes 3 cups which is probably a great amount served by itself, but definitely would half the mixture if you plan to mix with Cream cheese, as this recipe will create 3 batches of Cream Cheese Relish Dip.  When I made the relish it did not thicken, so after an hour of simmering on the stove I added 2 tablespoon of cornstarch mixed in 2 tablespoons of water and it thickened right up!  This is a must try Relish and will be great for any occasion.

The beautiful red color of this dish makes this a perfect Christmas appetizer. The relish, almost like candy, is paired well with the cream cheese. I used my stick blender to puree the relish and had no problems with it being runny. I made the recipe as written and enjoyed the hot bite. This sauce would also make a very good sweet and sour pork or shrimp dish.

Yummy!  I have had a similar relish and had never been able to find the recipe.  This is it!  I simmered it for 30 minutes, however, I ended up boiling it again for a few minutes at the end to thicken it up.  It also caramelized the onions. Super!

This is very delicious! I spooned over cream cheese on crackers. Tasted like crab rangoon with a kick. It is very rich, & would not recommend making unless for a crowd of people because a little goes a long way. Made it for myself & my husband who did not care for it so I had a lot to throw away.

This relish was fantastic.  I reduced the red pepper flakes to 1 tsp, simmered for 1 hour, and in the last 10 minutes added 2 tbsp. cornstarch diluted in 2 tbsp. water.

This was exactly what I was looking for.  Reminds me of this relish that I buy at a gourmet food store in a mall.  Now I don't spend nearly as much or have to drive 45 minutes.  This is a keeper.  Thanks!

Not for kids, too spicy with the red chile flakes, but significantly tamed by the cream cheese, chopped liver, or peanut butter.  I got it to thicken up with a longer cooking time.  Beautiful color.  The second time I added a few whole mustard, celery, and allspice seeds.  It was a fun addition to a roast beef or roast chicken sub sandwich. Really like how well it keeps since you don't add dairy butter or oil to it.

Great...but it is what it is...a sweet and sour relish.  If you're looking for an appetizer for your husband's superbowl party, he'd likely rather a spinach or 7-layer dip as they can be consumed in mass quantity.  This relish is nice for tasting and the ladies will rave when served at the baby shower.

Vegan I think not white sugar is not vegan. This should be moved to the normal appetizer recipe section;  especially as the poster lists cream cheese to to spread on the crackers for use with this sugar concoction:(

Simple and delicious! I have served this at several events and it always gets rave reviews. Usually the first empty dish of the evening. To serve simply place a block of cream cheese in the center of a large platter. Spoon on this lovely relish and surround with water crackers. Put cheese spreaders on each side of the platter and stand back. A perfect recipe as is and also handles substitutions quite well. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I served it over a block of cream cheese with crackers.  Everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.  It is very similar to putting pepper jelly over cream cheese, which is much easier.  BTW I followed the recipe (except with 3/4 C of sugar) and no one thought that it was spicy at all.  The cream cheese probably helped there.

This recipe is excellent! I made it and served it according to Cindy's exact directions (except that I had to use 1 red and 1 orange pepper, its what I had). No changes needed! The color of the dish was gorgeous too! Nothing beats a pretty dish that tastes great! I made it as a part of a big party spread. Everyone loved it. I have transferred this recipe into my personal recipe book. Thank you Cindy!

This recipe is great.  It's so flexable.  It looks like reviewers (myself included) have made substitutions for almost every ingredient and it still gets rave reviews. I had to sub a few things.  I used yellow bell peppers and had to use a half cup of white sugar and half a cup brown sugar.  I also substituted red wine vinegar because that's what I had.  We've had it with cream cheese and crackers, but  I'd like to try it on a sausage or brat as another reviewer suggested.  It did turn out a bit sweeter than I like, so I'll lower the amount of sugar next time.

Fantastic taste for a very easy to make relish. Great also with a variety of cheeses. I did have to cook mine for about 1.5 hours to get it thicker. Once I took it off the heat, it seemed to thicken. I may try it next time with a little corn starch like the other reviewers had stated.

This IS tasty, but I'm only giving it 3 stars because of the consistency issue, and the color.  I cooked it for well over 30 minutes, and it never firmed up.  I purred the majority of it with 1 T of corn starch.  And then reheated.  Consistency is much better,  but it's a very red/orange color (a little unappetizing).  I only used 1/2 t. of red pepper flakes, and it was just about right.  We like things "mild".  I also used about 3 oz of cream cheese that I melted into the mixture.  It IS tasty - just not sure how to use it (other than with crackers).  Seems like it would be a good spread for sandwiches (??)

Took the advice from others and mixed one cup of the relish with a brick of low fat cream cheese.  Served it with wheat thins.

I love this!!  :)  I was a little worried when I began that the vinegar would be overwhelming, but it turned out very sweet.  I brought it to a family reunion potluck and I didn't have any leftovers to take home!  I will definitely be making this again!

Yum!  It came out delicious, although it did make the house smell while making it.  I did make a few additions:  1) I added chopped kale since I had some leftover that I needed to use up.  This added a little nice green specks to it, and 2) I added pineapple chunks and the pineapple juice it came in from leftovers as well.  It came out tasty!  Boyfriend and guests loved it.

Wow!  This relish is even better than the sweet pepper and onion relish from Harry and David's.  I will definitely be making this one again.  I followed the advice to use the canned whole cranberries with sauce.  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar, but added a 1/2 cup of Splenda brown sugar.

The flavor of this was really awesome! I served it over 2 blocks of cream cheese with pita chips and people really loved it. It didn't look all that appetizing (it was a weird orange color) and it didn't really cook down like it was supposed to though, I cooked it for a full hour and it still hadn't thickened up so I went the corn starch route. Also I reduced the sugar and vinegar as suggested by other reviewers and I thought the flavor balance was perfect when I was done.

I've made this several times with rave reviews. While still warm I add 8oz of cream cheese.  This weekend I made it for the Bishop when he came to visit our parish and he commented on how wonderful it is.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a very good-tasting relish but I am giving it 4 stars because it really does stink up the house.  I finely chopped the veggies using a food processor and simmered for an hour.  I mixed about half of the relish with a block of cream cheese to make a spread and it tastes great!  However, it tastes A LOT like the jalepeno jelly you can buy in the store.  Just for sake of ease, I'll probably stick with my standby appetizer recipe of a block of cream cheese with jalepeno jelly on top spread on crackers.

Definitely a keeper!  Liked by all who tried it.  I cut the recipe  in half and served to 6 people and that was perfect except I was wishing I had leftovers.  I personally am not a big fan of "hot" spices so I cut the red pepper flakes to 1 teaspoon and again, for me that was perfect.  A little bite without making me uncomfortable.

Excellent! 
Instead of chopped peppers I did rough slices. I also skipped the crushed red peppers since I was serving this at my children's birthday party.
I placed the peppers and onions on top of a package of cream cheese, served with Ritz. It took about 45 minutes and both the toddlers and adults devoured it all up. Got several recipe requests. Don't drain the pepper mixture-its the best part!

Delicious and easy!  I add a little flour or corn starch to thicken it then I use a stick blender  to make it smooth.  Wonderful over a block of cream cheese.

As I was making this, I was confused on how it was going to turn out and my gosh did it stink up my house... I let it sit overnight to serve for Christmas Eve, I microwaved it for about 45 seconds to soften it, poured it over cream cheese and served with wheat crackers. WOW - what a hit!!!  I couldn't believe something so simple would be so good! It was the first thing gone. I didn't make it very spicy because of kids but can't wait to try it that way next time. THIS IS AWESOME..just make sure you have good ventalation in your house when preparing as the wine vinegar is strong during the simmer.

Made it just as the recipe indicated and it was perfect.  Didnt have any problems with it thickening.  I made it to go with the Blackened Salmon recipe on here. Paired up great, something spicey with something sweet.

I made this for a party I was hosting and basically everyone loved it!  The only person who wasn't so fond of it was someone who did not like spicy food and since this has a little kick, it wasn't her favorite.  Be sure to chill it for a while so it gets thicker.  Mine was runny due to not having the time to refrigerate it long enough.

excellent with cream cheese and bagels . Also as a side dish with Mexican Bean Dip Yummo.Some people seem to have trouble with thickening this dish . Be patient . You can start it at a low boil and reduce the heat as it thickens . Be sure to keep stirring it towards the end . I have gotten it to an almost Jelly consistency  .I have made this many times and never had a problem getting to the thickness that I wanted .

We enjoyed this very much.  I didn't mind the "stink" in the house....It reminded me of all the canning my mother used to do.  This will be a regular for us.  We used it on meatloaf.

Everyone who tasted this LOVED it!  I had cut back on the red pepper flakes to 1 teaspoon, and the unanimous decision was to double that next time.  Otherwise this is a fast and inexpensive relish that tastes great served as a snack or appetizer over cream cheese.  It would also be good on a hot dog or sausage in a bun.  I'll be making this over and over again.

Delicious!  This was surprisingly very, very good.  Everyone loved it and commented on it.   Next time I won't cook it for as long as I did because it gets pretty hard and sticky.   But the flavors are delicious.   The smell of vinegar is overwhelming while you're cooking it, but it tastes fabulous.

This makes me a snacking hero at any and all parties. My friends love this. It tastes complicated, but it's super easy. Give it a try. It's sweet and spicy, and everyone will ask you to make it again. (This I have learned from experience.) :)

I made this for a holiday gathering.  I served it atop cream cheese with crackers.  I added a little bit of fresh crushed garlic and some finely chopped jalapenos and about 1 teaspoon chili powder (we like it hot).  Everyone loved it, asking for the recipe.  I personally felt the sauce was too sweet.  Next time I will use a little less sugar.

I am so in love with this recipe. I only altered the recipe by changing the red pepper flakes for a serrano pepper. I love foods that have multi layered taste/flavor. I am making this for Christmas gifts for my co-workers. Mahalo!

Fantastic!! Reduced the vinegar and sugar to 3/4 cup as suggested by other reviewers and cooked for 45 min instead of 30 to thicken it, after it was refrigerated for 4 hours it was a perfect relish!!! Served this with cream cheese and crackers and have topped burgers with it! Outstanding!!!!

Good flavor. It's a sweet and sour Indian relish. About my only complaint is that there needs to be a more detailed warning about cooking time. "Simmer for 30 minutes" doesn't take into account the temperature control issue. It will basically go from syrup to congealed "candy" in about 30 seconds, so after 15 minutes of simmer you have to stay at the pot constantly. DO NOT leave it alone on a timer!

I have made this recipe several times now and people just love it. I have reduece the amount of sugar and vinegar to 3/4 cup each. Still a little runny, but I just drain it slightly before serving. Anyways, like I said everyone has loved it and there is none left at the end of the evening.

I took this to work for a cultural event we were having and won a 1/2 day of vacation in our food contest! It's very easy to prepare, and everyone raved about it.  My store was out of red peppers so I substituted with orange, and they worked great too. I also added a bit more crushed pepper and it had a really good kick!

Yummy! I measured the red pepper flakes generously, and this was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy. Very good with crackers and cream cheese. It was a little on the runny side, though, so next time (there will definitely be a next time) I may add a little corn starch.

The recipe is amazingly simple and delicious as written. It also adapts well to variations.  I've added such things as minced jalapeno, minced garlic, candied ginger, a bit of cayenne to up the heat, toasted and ground cumin, and the flavor shifts slightly to accommodate but remains fabulous.  Thank you for an incredible appetizer recipe!

Served on top of cream cheese, per everyone's suggestion. Used cornstarch to thicken at the end. Everyone loved it and polished it all off. Will def. make again.

This is amazing!  Great sweet hot flavor and was a hit when I took it to work. I highly recommend adding some cornstarch to thicken it at the end. I also reduced the amount of vinegar and sugar.  Must serve it by spreading some cream cheese on a plate and then spreading the relish on top.  Very pretty too.

This recipe is great. It reminds me of a condiment my Mother used to make, we'd use it on roast beef. My Mom's recipe always seemed to thin to me, when I made this I did as others said and used some cornstarch to thicken. That made it perfect. I too only used 1tsp. of the crushed red pepper flakes. I am so thankful I decided to try this recipe. Thanks Cindy for the walk down memory lane. Even when this was cooking it smelled like my Mom's house when she was canning.

Awesome!  Thanks for the great idea.  I struggled to make this since I was out of everything.  I used yellow bell peppers from my garden, rice vinegar instead of white wine, cayenne instead of crushed red pepper, cane sugar instead of white, and I added mustard seeds and tumeric for that lovely yellow color!  It turned out delicious anyway.  I plan on serving it for dinner tonight as a chutney with chicken that I will also add some curry powder to.  Perfecto!

I've made this several times and it's always a hit.  I use one red, one orange, and one yellow pepper when making (because the store where I frequently shop pre-packages the colored peppers) and it looks and tastes great.  I also put over cream cheese when serving.  This is definitley a addictive and a favorite.

I made this one, the brown sauce, and the green sauce just like what we get in the Indian restaurants.  This red Indian Relish is very good...you do need to add some corn starch as other suggested to thicken it up a little in the end.  I halved all the ingredients and used 1/2 heaping teaspoon of the red pepper flakes.  3/4 of a teaspoon might have been good too.  This one's a keeper  8-7-0...made it again and made the mistake of forgetting to turn the heat down to simmer....the sauce was almost caramelized before my husband mentioned I had something going on the stove...duh!!  It still tasted fine though.

This is somewhat of a misnomer - there isn't really anything "indian" about it - but it is amazing - we had it in hamburgers, hot dogs, on cream cheese & crackers, even with fresh pineapples - and it was great everywhere we used it!!  I did have problems with it not thickening - but that was easily fixed by adding some cornstarch in water as suggested by other reviewers.  And i have to admit that i had to change things quite a bit to suit what i had on hand - substituting celery for onion, rice vinegar for white wine vinegar and chopped fresh thai chili peppers for the crushed chili pepper flakes - but it was still awesome!!

This is a really great recipe.  My husband LOVES relishes on sandwiches with cheese and has begged me to ALWAYS keep this one in the fridge for him.  But he eats it faster than I can keep it made!  Going to have to make a huge batch and try canning it.  It's great over cream cheese too.  I reduce the vinegar and sugar amounts to 3/4 cups each and have made this several times now.  Thanks for making my husband think I'm amazing!  He says it's better than any storebought, fancy relish or chutney that he's ever had!  I too love it with the cream cheese and crackers, it's wonderful! (Though I have to admit that I'm not sure what makes it Indian . . . no matter, it's great!)

Soooo scrumptious!  I frequently take this to my wine club and pair it with a wine that calls for a spicy appetizer.  It's always a hit!  I double - or even triple it!  It just gets better the next day.

I used 2 large red Peppers, 1 cup of red wine vinegar, half a sweet onion,  a half a normal onion, a large medium red chilli,
1/4 cup white sugar and one Thai red chilli brought the mixture to the boil and simmered for 30 mins then put it through the food processor and it was perfect for me as I love very spicy food

I looked for Indian recipes for my book club. Could hardly believe I found one that I already had the ingredients for, and it was easy and delicious. Only used one tsp of the red pepper flakes, as I thought it must be a misprint!

I didn’t make any changes.  I took it to a potluck and everyone loved it. Sweet and spicy. So delicious. 
I did add some cornstarch like others had suggested to thicken it up a bit. 
This is a keeper for me that I’ll be making quite often. 
Thanks

I was looking for a sweet red pepper relish to surprise my son-in-law with for Christmas.  He was to Ireland a couple of years ago and when in Dublin went to the Queen of Tarts Café for breakfast.  He brought home bottles of Sweet Pepper Relish and raved about how good it is.  I looked for a recipe to replicate it and this was the closest.  I made it using the same quantity of ingredients 2 very large red peppers or 3 smaller ones, a large sweet onion and instead of white wine vinegar I used red wine vinegar (as listed in the ingredients of the Queen of Tarts relish), I added one jalapeno pepper instead of the pepper flakes and two large cloves of garlic.  I chopped the vegetables in my food processor.  I placed the veges in a larger pot, added the vinegar, sugar, 1/2 TBSP of mustard seed and salt to taste and then simmered to near jam consistency. I then pureed the relish and canned it for 10 minutes in a hot water bath (using Ball or Bernardin standard canning practices).  Voila!  This relish tastes as good as the relish he brought back.  I can't wait to give it to him.

This is delicious and I make it every summer when bell peppers are abundant.  Terrific with many things, not just cream cheese.  Try it on leftover pork or beef, so yummy on eggs, taquito or in quesadillas.  Some I make spicy but mostly not.  The jars don't last long!

This is really good. It has a nice flavor and heat. Like others, my relish took longer than 30 minutes to thicken. I did not add cornstarch or any other thickener. I simply let it simmer for much longer. Probably closer to 1 hour. This reduced it down until the liquid was fairly syrupy. This is great mixed with cream cheese. I find about 3/4 c of the relish + 8 oz of cream cheese is a good ratio. The relish by itself is also great as an alternative to cocktail sauce for shrimp.

Great taste, beautiful presentation. I think the color is what draws people to this dish. If you're not one for spicy stuff, you can always cut back on the red pepper flakes. Try half a tablespoon or even a fourth. I have had it with crackers and pita chips. It's good either way. Some one mentioned it's really good with cream cheese. I'm gonna have to try that next time. Overall, a great dish.

I have made this before and LOVE it!  However, we ate this up pretty quickly so I do not know how long this will last in the fridge?  Any idea as I would like to make this 2 1/2 weeks before Christmas and give as gifts?
Thanks very much.
