I made this into healthy muffins instead of cake. I used whole wheat white flour, cut the sugar down to a half cup, I used Healthy Request tomato soup, half homemade apple butter in place of half the oil, and I added 1/2 cup of organic raisins that I soaked in hot chai to "plump" them before adding them to the batter. I did not use the cream cheese frosting but that would be excellent on these. I got twelve biggish muffins out of this recipe and they turned out beautiful, moist and very tasty. 350* for 20 minutes was just right. This was an excellent recipe to use on hand pantry ingredients to make a healthy breakfast/snack for my husband and kids.

Very very good!  Substituted the shortening for equal amount of applesauce, added 1 tsp of nutmeg and 1 cup chopped walnuts.  Made it twice this week.  A hit here :)

WOW!!!! This is totally the secret ingredient that will quench the curiousity of any cook who wants to make the ultimate soft, tender, and moist spice cake! My whole family loves it (they are eating it as I speak), and no one could tell I used tomato soup!! The frosting is the cherry on top that completes this great desert! A six star spice cake!

This recipe is fantastic - lots of flavour and freezes well too. Don't be put off by the soup, believe me you don't taste it but it makes the cake incredibly moist.

I made this cake into cupcakes and it was superb. I (of course) made some changes. I omitted the water and subbed a half cup roasted applesauce for the shortening and 2 rounded tbs of plain Greek Yogurt for the milk. I also added raisins and will likely add walnuts next time. For the frosting, I used 8oz of cream cheese, 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract, and 3/4 cup of powdered sugar. I can't imagine how sweet 2 cups would be!! If you're unsure about this recipe, try it. You'll be pleasantly surprised.

My Mom used to make this cake and I did not have her recipe. I looked this up and it is so much like it, although I think moister! It got all eat in 2 days. Love the cream cheese icing, I also added some raisins which Mom used to put in hers. Thanks so much.

I was highly skeptical.  Basically, you throw every thing into a bowl and mix.  It really shouldn't turn out well.  But it did, and it's amazing.  This is a delicate and fragile delicious cake.  It tastes more like pumpkin than any thing else, but it's much lighter than any pumpkin cake recipe I've found.  This is a new 'go-to' recipe for me.  I'll make it again and again.  Easy and delicious!

I had my reservations about this one, but it turned out great.  Super moist even 4 days later.  I used a cream cheese frosting I had left over from a previous project.  Even my husband liked it and he's not a sweets person.

I made this into cupcakes, and they took 20 minutes to bake. The crumb has the perfect consistency-soft and moist, not dense or spongy at all.  If only all my other cupcakes came out like that! The flavor is very good, too, and reminds me of gingerbread.

This was my fault, I thought I had a can of soup in the pantry but didn't. I used a can of tomato sauce and used tomato paste.. the consistancy was right. I went to make cupcakes, but they crumbled, SO I ended up making cake balls, using the cream cheese icing.

I made the recipe exactly as written (except in cupcake form so the baking time was a little different) and it was a huge hit both at home and at work.  No one could believe that tomato soup was in the recipe!

I had half a can of tomato soup leftover from making another recipe and decided to use it up by making half of this recipe.  I followed the recipe, but I did omit the ground cloves, as I am not a fan.  I baked this in my 6-cup bundt pan for about 30 minutes.  This produced a small cake that was nicely spiced.  Since I served this as a coffee cake, I didn’t make the cream cheese frosting, although I’m sure that would have been wonderful.  I did add a little whipped cream to one piece to dress it up for my photo.

Maybe I did something wrong, or maybe because I was the one who made them, but I swear I can taste the tomato soup... I didn't really like these, but the kids ate them.

Don't let the tomato soup scare you away from this recipe! You can't taste it AT ALL and it makes the cake really moist. Made recipe exactly as written. Really good cake.

It was great for using up an extra can of tomato soup, but I've had better spice cakes.  It seemed to dry out within a day or two.

Most people find the cake got too much salt so I feels that maybe try to buy a low sodium tomato soup ok....sounds good for the cake's recipe. But I will try to make this recipe with a low sodium tomato soup without adding salt.

I chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients to make it and my husband loves spice cake. I was intrigued by the tomato soup and figured with all the positive reviews that the soup was virtually tasteless once it was baked into the cake.

The ingredients are very easy to find in your pantry and the fact that you dump them all in the same bowl and mix was fast and convenient. While the cake baked, I made the icing and let it sit until the cake cooled. One thing I noticed, and this may be because I have a gas oven, was it began to brown about 25 minutes into the cooking time so I took 25 degrees off and let it cook the rest of the way. It turned out perfect!

My kids and my young nieces and nephews didn't believe the secret ingredient was tomato soup. The cake was moist and perfectly spiced and the frosting tasted so much better than store bought. I will be making this again and again!

Outstanding!  I had half a can of tomato soup to use up after making the Dorothy Lynch salad dressing (recipe here on AR) and was led to this recipe by the reviews on the salad dressing.  While being skeptical about putting tomato soup in a cake, I pressed on and made a half recipe.  I baked it in a 9x9" square pan for about 30 minutes.  I may have overcooked it just a bit because the edges and corners were very dry.  I just eyeballed the cream cheese frosting using a partial package of cream cheese also left over from another recipe.  I think you could put cream cheese frosting on shoe leather and it would be delicious!  This cake was a delicious surprise.  Thanks!

My mom's family all used this recipe.  The only difference is they added chopped dates and, for some reason frosted the cake with chocolate frosting....believe it or not, it was good!  I haven't tried it with the cream cheese frosting, but I think that would be even better.  Memories!
