I make this recipe every Christmas. I have found that one 8 oz block of cream cheese and 1-2 pound bag of powdered sugar with 1 teaspoon of mint works great.  Using 1/2 tsp of mint and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla is tasty as well.  Try dipping the finished mints in  dark chocolate.

This was an excellent recipe, which made a tasty and smooth candy. I had trouble with the pliability of another similar recipe on this site... but this one was quite easy and I was able to mold it into shapes using candy molds. I did add some chocolate coating to mine when hardened, but they would be fine without that. The texture was terrific... very "melt-in-your-
mouth" good!

Thanks!

I also used this recipe for wedding favors and they turned out awesome!  I rolled them in sugar and pressed them into heart molds.  The sugar made them all "sparkly" giving them an even better appearance.  They tasted great and held the heart shape really well.  Great recipe!

So easy, so addictive!  I followed the advice of using 8 oz of cream cheese, 2 lb of confectioner sugar and 1 t of peppermint extract.  My kids and I added some gel food coloring to make pink for Valentine's Day and yellow for the Steelers :)  Can't wait to share them!!

I agree with whatarat. I also think that they need to be baked or at least dipped in a chocolate. I let mine sit over an hour and they still did not get hard. I will not make this recipe again. Hubby and kids did not like it either.
***NOTE****
I did try this recipe again but this time I put them in the freezer for about 30 minutes. Then put them in the fridge for about a day took them out and dipped them in chocolate. What a difference it made. My kids and husband now like them. They are still pretty sweet but if you like peppermint patties that is what they taste like. Just miniature peppermint patties which will make great Christmas candies to give as a gift. I will make these again in the future. Remember to keep these in the fridge until you are ready to give them away.  I also change my rating from a 2 to a 4.

I have had this same recipe for over 20 years. My kids beg me to make these very christmas! I roll them in small balls,, dip the balls in red and green sugar, then flatten with a fork. I read that some people had trouble with drying... try using food coloring paste instead of drops. the liquid is just enough to hamper drying time. Hope this helps.

So easy and tasty! You can also use butter flavoring or orange or lemon extracts for variety. I don't like rolling them in granulated sugar, I think it takes away from the creamy texture of the candies.

I gave this recipe to my Maid of Honor to make for my wedding in October. They were fantastic, everyone commented on how creamy and delicious they were, and wanted the recipe for themselves. Very easy to make and had a wonderful taste and froze well so can be made ahead of time, and were easy to put in molds.

I made these for Christmas plates that we give to friends.  I only used 1/2 the amount of peppermint extract called for and used vanilla to make up the rest of the 1/4 teaspoon. This flavor was amazing! I also flattened the balls with the waffled end of my meat mallet which made a pretty crosshatch pattern, then sprinkled with green and red sugars.  They were beautiful, looked so festive.  Great recipe!

I found pretty much the same recipe in my Kitchen-Aide Mixer cookbook (not the booklet that comes with the mixer, but an actual cookbook sold in bookstores).  It's been a while since I made these, but they were so easy and really tasty, not to mention they looked really cute.

I suggest adding a little green or pink food coloring to get the desired color.  I also rolled my mints in granulated sugar before flattening with a fork.  After checking I see that the measurements for my recipe were a little different and are as follows:
3 oz light cream cheese
1/3 teaspoon peppermint extract
2-3 drops green food coloring (or color of your choice)
4 1/4 - 4 1/2 cups powdered sugar
granulated sugar

Wow!  Not at all what I was hoping for.  I thought there was too much mint flavoring, I would have perfered it to be a bit more subtle.  Also, the powdered sugar was very strong as well.  I could barely taste the cream cheese, and then only when I was really trying.  I basically tasted just like minty powdered sugar.

Wow, wow, wow - is this a great little treat.  I made this for our Girls Night Out this month, and everyone loved them!  Three ingredients + 20 minutes and you are done.  I added green food color as I wanted these for a pre-St. Patrick's Day treat. They truly just melt in your mouth.  A great recipe that I will be making again.

My great-grandma used to make these, and now they are my go-to treat for the holidays! Look for some fun rubber candy molds. Roll them into little balls, coat with white sugar and press into the molds for fun holiday shapes! The sugar coating helps them set a little better also. Be sure to experiment with different colors and flavors, too! I usually don't measure out the flavors but I add little bits at a time until it tastes right. Root beer and almond flavors are two of my favorites! :)

Love this recipe, though I'm not a fan of mint.  I just used vanilla and they turned out great.  I divided the dough into 3 sections.  I left 1 section white, tinted 1 pink and 1 red.  I rolled each color into long, skinny logs.  Then i gently pressed and rolled the 3 logs into one log and sliced them into sweet Valentine's candies.  My kids did the tinting and rolling.  It was just like play doh and they loved it.

I used this recipe to make three different flavors of cream cheese candies. The first one that I made was peppermint, but I only used 1/8 tsp of peppermint so it wouldn't be overwhelming and died it green with color paste. The next flavor that I made was coconut (per request) I had to use 3x the flavor for the coconut as the mint. The last one that I made was strawberry. We couldn't find any extract that wa reasonable to purchase so we bought some strawberries. We diced them and then used a blender to puree them, strained out all of the seeds and used about a tsp to flavor (this of course required more powdered sugar since I added a liquid, but they taste just like fresh strawberries). I made them into little pillows for my client, I hope she will be as pleased by the flavors as I was.

This recipe is easy and delicious!  I took another raters suggestion and used an 8oz brick of cream cheese with a 2 lb bag of confectioners sugar.   I used enough sugar to keep the mixture from being sticky (almost the whole bag)  After forming into balls I flattened with a small glass dipped in leftover sugar, froze them, and then dipped them in melted dark chocolate.  They are great!  I will use this recipe many times.

My mother made these for every wedding we were invited to when I was a kid. Use food coloring to make them look pastel and pretty. For added presentation we had these little soft plastic molds in the shape of leaves and flowers. After pressing in mold dip in SUPER fine sugar.

This is a great recipe. I use 1-2# bag of powdered sugar, 1 8oz cream, and a little more than 1/2 t. flavoring.  To save time, I just roll the dough into logs and slice into 1/2" pieces. I also don't use granulated sugar at all. It definetly take away from the creaminess of the mint.

These turned out great! I wanted to try them ahead of time since some seemed to have some problems. I think it might be they used an 8 oz package of cream cheese. 3oz is plenty to help the sugar stick together. I did put it in the fridge for about 15 min to harden it before shaping and placed them on wax paper to prevent sticking. Can't wait to make these again for the holidays

These were soooo goood!!!!  My 10 yr. old made them for a valentine "sale" in his classroom.  (We chose this recipe 'cause it is no bake).  Because they taste like Peppermint Patties, we dipped in chocolate.  They went over very well.  The first time we make them, the dough was dry, so I added couple of TBSP. milk, and it worked great.  We also made batch that we rolled out and made heart shaped.  They need to be thick to be dipped in chocolate, otherwise it went well. Will make these again and again.

I peppermint lover. This recipe was very lovely. For some reason though it stayed kind of soggy and didn't harden for a real long time. I also adjusted the recipe for my family who don't like peppermint. I added coconuts and walnuts. They loved it.  For some reason that one harden just right and was fantasic. I think I may have made a few mistakes in measuring. But Over all it was great. It is now a requested item. Thanks for sharing.

These were very good, but mine were a little too sticky.  I ended up using more powdered sugar than the recipe called for.  I also used a little extra mint extract so they would be very minty, like an after dinner mint.  I drizzled a little milk chocolate over a few of them. Mmmmmmmm!!

I didn't have peppermint oil, so I used cinnamon oil.  These were very easy to make and tasted good.  I used red and green food coloring because these were a Christmas treat.  I will probably make these again.

If I could give this recipe a negative star I would have. Unmanageable, inaccurate measurements to make the candy as listed. Like previous reviews had to fiddle with the sugar content and still to soft; will not try again.

We make these for every wedding reception, all graduation parties and sometimes just cuz we want to!  My son is getting married this weekend.  Grandma just made 8 oz mint flavored and I'm working on fruit flavors-my son's favorite!  One piece of advice, they are a bit sticky when the weather is humid, just add a little more powdered sugar to get the right consistency,

5* Only if you read the other reviews. Recipe as written does not have anywhere near enough powder sugar for the mints to set up. When I made this it was the first time I had ever made a recipe with out reading through reviews first...BIG MISTAKE- READ THE REVIEWS.

After reading the reviews, and since I am in Europe, I used a 90 gram package of cream cheese (which is about 3 oz), 1/4 tsp peppermint extract, and 500 grams of powdered sugar. I also used the idea of flattening them with the waffle side of the meat tenderizer. They turned out just right!

My mom use to make these for weddings. She would dust candy molds with white sugar and press into molds. I like these so much more than the chocolate mints. For the ones who said this needed to be cooked. Cook these and you will end up with a runny puddle of mush that is nasty.

I give this recipe 5 stars not because the taste is out of this world, but because I think the recipe is perfect for what it's intended to make - little mint candies (my family is not mint fanatics, so I didn't make this recipe thinking we'd go nuts over the flavor).  This is a very easy recipe that yields a creamy, flavorful, versatile candy.  I read all the reviews prior to making the candy and then made modifications on proportions of extract and sugar as many indicated.  HOWEVER, if I were to do it over, I would have followed the recipe exactly as written, because in reality, I think the proportions are probably right on, or at the very least, the best place from which to start tweaking the recipe if needed (the most seemingly informed reviews were not at all on target and led to lots of tweaking of the cream cheese, extract, and sugar proportions).

This recipe looks like it could not be easier and with all the great reviews, I was excited to give it a try.  I attempted it three times and each time the end result was like eating a flattened out piece of cake icing.  I like icing but this was extreme!  I will not be making this again.  My kids even commented on the sweetness and those types of comments aren't usually uttered from childrens mouths!

These are OK.  Mine hardened up and then I dipped them in semi-sweet chocolate and put them in the freezer.  They're good but not anything too spectacular.
