Entire family, including 12-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter cleaned their plate.  My wife and I had two helpings.  Sized recipe for 6 servings and there was plenty left over. Took others suggestions and cut broth back to 2-1/2 cups from 3, added a can of diced tomatoes including juice, added 3 large cloves of garlic (minced), added 1/2-lb. small/medium  frozen shrimp (last 10 minutes), substituted turkey kielbasa for smoked sausage, and substituted  chopped baby bella mushrooms for canned. Sauteed bell pepper, onion, carrots (chopped), celery, mushrooms, & garlic until onions were soft.  Added kielbasa and tomotoes after chicken was browned/cooked mostly through.  A definite keeper in our family. Very rare when all agree the food was good. Thanks everyone for the great suggestions.

This recipe tastes fine, but it is very far from any recipe I have ever used to make traditional cajun jambalaya.  I'm originally from Lafayette, La in the heart of cajun country so I have eaten Jambalaya my entire life.  It tastes good, but it isn't jambalaya.

I read the reviews yesterday and thought that the recipe was simple enough so I tried it last night. I'm pretty sure it took me more than 15 minutes of prep time, but I agree with the other reviews that this meal went over well with my husband and kids. I did follow other reviewers' leads and made my own adjustments, chopping the carrots instead of slicing and sauteing them with the green peppers, celery, onion, and of course lots of garlic. Then I added the chicken. I too added a can of diced tomatoes with the juice, cutting back on the broth. I tend to like things a little more seasoned and spicy, so next time I think I would add a tablespoon of cajun seasoning after adding the chicken and use andouille sausage instead of smoked. But all in all with some steamed broccoli on the side, it was a pretty good meal.

OK recipe if you're not from the South like I am.  It's definitely bland and not hot and spicy like the real thing.  Also, I'd use Andouille sausage and leave out carrots.  I've never heard of carrots in a Jambalays before!  More onions, garlic and real Cajun seasoning...like Tony's!

used andouille sausage instead of smoked, also added red bell pepper to give a little color, used cajun spice blend instead of the cayenne pepper, was very good, even better the next day.

One of our household favorites because it is a one dish meal (no dishwasher) and is ready in under an hour from start to finish.  And it is pretty healthy when I sub my favorite turkey sausage!  The only change we make is to adjust proportions (1 can chicken broth, 1 c. rice, two carrots, two celery, 2 chicken breast halves, 1/2. turkey sausage loop, whole small onion, half green pepper) and we add a 16 oz. can of diced tomatoes with the rice.

May not really be Jambalaya, but it is totally tasty and satisfying on a cold night!

Although this was very tastey, it did not remind me of the Jambalaya I have had down south. I spruced it up a bit and added Talpia fish, but ommited the sausage(we dont eat read meat. I used an array of spices from chili powder to carribean jerk seasoning. I also added sweet corn, okra, and diced tomatoes. It was definitly delicious, and I think it's a great recipe for first timers with Jambalya and families that don't really like spicey food.

Loved it.  Did change the recipe a bit.  Chicken sausage... more onion, a ton more spice and heat.  The aroma stuck in the house overnight and I dreamed about it!

Very good flavor. The only problem I had was the rice got a little soft.  There were leftovers and the rice was not detectable the next day.  I will make this again but I may keep the rice separate unitl we eat it.  Will try it again.

I signed up to be a member of allrecipes.com just so I could review & rate THIS recipe. It was fabulous; just made the following alterations: used linguica ( portugese sausage) instead of smoked sausage, added 3/4 lb of shrimp at the last 10 min, omitted carrots, doubled celery, added Tony's Cajun seasoning to chicken when browning, and the added another Tbsp to broth when I put the rice in. I also added 4 cloves of garlic when saut√©ing the veggies. I did not add tomatoes, as my husband is allergic, so that's what attracted me to this recipe. The tomatoes were not missed! This made a TON of food, but it's jambalaya-it's supposed to! Leftovers were AWESOME!

I cheated and used Zatarains Jambalya rice mix instead of plain rice. Used beef sausage since we don't eat pork, and added 4 cloves of garlic, and several shakes of Tony Chachere's creole seasoing for flavor to sautee the aromatics and meat. I sauteed the onions, garlic and celery, omitted the carrots, then added the chicken chunks, and sausage. Simmered the rice until al dente, and added the meat/aromatic mixture. So, I technically used 2 pans/pots. No biggie in my opinion. I only used 2 large chicken breasts, and omitted the mushrooms. It's definitely a great base recipe.

Even with the serving size dialed down, this recipe makes a lot of food.  It is a solid dish, and one I would recommend to any cook looking for a good Jamalaya recipe.  It lasts in the fridge for quite a bit longer than one with shrimp would.

This recipe is awesome. I have made it twice and have had an awesome response both times, I have added the additional ingrediants suggested by the other readers, colorful peppers, Louisiana sausages and my own person addition shrimp and this recipe has been a winner every time.  I agree it is even better as a leftover.

This pleased not only my man but my 7 year old daughter and myself as well. I didn't have sausage so I added some shrimp and had to omit the celery due to not having any on hand. There wasn't any spiciness to this but had the perfect amount of flavor. Subtle, light and a healthy feeling. It left us all feeling good and full and there are plenty of leftovers!

I have two jobs and am a full time student so my time and resources are limited when it comes to cooking, but I have to say this was probably one of the easiest, cleanest, and best tasting things I've cooked so far. 

I didn't have all the ingredients so I used what I could including Cajun rice-a-roni instead of long grain rice, louisiana sausage instead of sausage, a red bell pepper, nix the carrots and cellery, fresh mushrooms.   Since I was cooking for me and my boyfriend who can't handle too much spice, I made two pots, one spicier then the other.  In his I poured in a little milk and less cayenne pepper.  

My roommates got to the rest of it before I could save any leftovers. =)

Huge hit!  I made this for a potluck and everyone asked for the reicpe.  I substituted fresh mushrooms for the canned.  I also only used 4cups of broth but added one can (don't drain out the juice) of diced tomatoes.  Yummy!

I don't understand all the rave reviews of this recipe.  I thought it would be a good jamabalaya recipe to try and it was just bland to me.  I even added louisiana hot sausage, garlic, hot sauce, shrimp...it just wasn't that great.  It's rare that I salt my food, but I certainly did on this one.

Totally yummy. If you're short on time (or just lazy like me), use a prepackaged seasoned rice mix and throw it in, making sure to cut back a bit on the cayenne. I added some beans and changed to kielbasa, threw in some cornbread on the side and I was in heaven. Even the picky eater in the family enjoyed.

This was a fun dish to make.  I added some fish, shrimp, old bay seasoning and some cajun seasoning to spice it up.  Great, cheap, and easy to make.

Although this is not your typical southern jambalaya, it is still a favorite of mine. I do not use mushrooms, but add cajun seasoned shrimp and about 5 times the amount of the cayenne pepper to spide it up. Some chili powder will really put it over the top!

I love this recipe.the taste was delicious.The only thing different I did was use long grain brown rice which must take longer to cook because the first time the rice was a little hard.I made this recipe at least once a month last winter.YUMMMY

5 stars as prepared using comments from others!  This is a great weeknight shortcut version of the much more time-consuming jambalaya.  Based on others comments:  used andoille sausage, skipped carrots and mushrooms, substituted poblano for green bell pepper, reduced broth, added diced canned tomatoes with juice, added lots of garlic and cajun seasoning to taste.  We also added frozen shrimp near the end and let the mixture simmer a little longer.  BIG HIT serving a weekend special for company dish on a weeknight!

Delicious jambalaya!  I omitted the celery (my boys don't care for it) and added 1 cup of fresh spinach leaves. The only reason I didn't give this recipe five stars is that the carrots were a bit mushy.  I will slice them thicker next time.

This was a big hit at my house!  My son had been asking for Jambalaya, so I looked on here and found this one.  Only change I made was to leave out the mushrooms - personal preference.

This was really good.  My kids loved it, and even my lovey hubby liked it (that's saying alot - he is really picky about creole recipes).  I used Tony's creole seasoning in this and I don't think I added enouph, but the chicken flavor really helped the rice alot!  I'll make it again!

Two thumbs down.  I made the recipe as stated, other than adding a can of Rotel tomatoes, and there was just no flavor to speak of.  The rice was bland, the chicken was bland; there was some kick from the heat of the Rotel spice, but that was pretty much it.  I added some Liquid Smoke which helped out some, but it still seemed like it was missing something.  So I added half a can of tomato sauce.  Small improvement, but not a fix for the flavor it was missing.  I am not familiar with what Jambalaya SHOULD taste like, so maybe this is a good recipe for Jamalaya.  I'm sure there are lots of picky kids and meat-and-potatoes hubbies out there who might be pleased with this meal since no flavor really exists to offend anyone's pallette, but our family prefers more flavor than this dish had to offer.  I highly recommend cutting the servings back to 6 until you know for sure if you need more (if you are, say, feeding an army or high school football team)--I started out at six servings and had PLENTY for four adults.  It almost filled up an entire 4-qt dutch oven and rice goes a long way, so people don't tend to eat as many servings of it.

This was really fun to make and very tasty! I used coconut oil instead of vegetable, added about two tablespoons of my favorite hot sauce, since I like things spicy and one can of stewed tomatos. Also, I used turkey sausage and added cooked shrimp about 5 minutes before the dish was done. ...And yes, a pleased my man with this one!

Just the recipe I was looking for, to take to next week's Pot Luck.  My family rated it "best ever Jambalaya"!  I replaced some of the broth with a tin of chopped tomato and doubled the mushrooms.  After browning the chicken breast, I kept it warm and added it 10 minutes before the end, to prevent overcooking.  I also gave the Jambalaya 10 minutes standing time, before serving.

This is really good, but if you like your Jambalaya spicy you'll need to add some heat to it. My kids don't like spicy food(yet!)so this was just right for them. To give it more flavor I added shrimp, one can of Rotel tomatoes, and used fresh mushrooms.  I will definitely make this again!

We love this recipe!  It has become a weekly favorite in our home.  I leave out the mushrooms and carrots, but keep everything else the same.  I think the key is the chicken broth - it gives it a wonderful depth of flavor!

Instead of regular sausage I used beef summer sausage... the flavors were excellent!  I also added a can of Mexican tomatoes, as it seemed like it needed something extra.  In doing so, I cut back on the stock by about half a cup, as I just threw in the tomatoes with their juice.

Really good. I had 2 servings and my husband went back for thirds. Its great if you can't handle a lot of heat, but if you want it spicier just add more cayenne and some Cajun seasoning.

I just finished making this dish and it is FANTASTIC!  I substituted the chicken with shrimp, scallops and spicy hot Italian sausage.  I also added hot pepper flakes and it is delicious and super simple to make.  I will absolutely be making this again and again.

I found this recipe a little bland.  Also, the rice seemed to be a little mushy.  I am not sure if it is me of my equipment - probably me, that everytime I try to make a rice dish it just doesn't turn out.  I love Jambalaya but can never seem to make it at home succesfully.

Made this for the very first time that anyone in my family (including myself) had tasted jambalaya. I wasn't ASKED to make it again --- I was TOLD that I would. It was even a big hit with my 3yo grand daughter who is a picky eater.

Thanks for the great recipe - we really enjoyed it!  I think, for our spicy tastes, it would have been a bit bland, but we spiced it up a little and it was excellent!  I added extra onion and chopped up 2 cloves of garlic and fried it with the onions.  I left out the mushrooms.  I also (made it scaled to 4 servings) added 1 full tbsp. cayenne and 2 tbsp cajun seasoning, and finally I had about 1 cup of stewed tomatoes left from something else I was cooking, and I threw this in.  I added a little extra rice to compensate for the extra liquid, but not much because we were actually happy that it wasn't all absorbed at the end.  My husband loves his gravy!

Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Quick to make, easy and super tasty.  I added 2 large cloves garlic, diced and about 1 1/2 cups frozen okra--thrown in for the last 7 minutes.  My 12 yr old son says 10 stars! By the way, this makes a TON of food!  I only made 1/2 the recipe and have LOTS of yummy leftovers.

I asked the butcher for smoked sausage and he gave me andouille susage which was good. I made the recipe as stated and found the sausage gave heat but the meal lacked flavor.

I used about 1 1/2 Tblsp of Minor's Chicken base to the 6 cups of water and only 1 1/2 cups of the rice.  No added salt as the sausage and chicken base took care of that.  I did sprinkle the chicken pieces with a little of Paul Prudhomme's Poultry Magic.  The rice soaked up every bit of the broth.  The dish was flavorful but not spicy in any way.  I will reheat it and add in a little Bayou Blast to liven it up.  I've made heavier rice/chicken casseroles that were loaded with extra calories and not nearly as flavorful as this was.  I couldn't find my little bag of frozen tail-less shrimp or that would have gone in also.  Sausage was skinless.  Makes a lot and would be a great take-along dish for a potluck.  Enjoyed all the suggestions especially the one about adding tomatoes.  Will make this again.  It's a good dish to turn the grandkids loose with and let them season to their own preference.  I did use the carrots .... about a good handful of baby carrots which I chopped finely in the food processor.  They added flavor and were thoroughly cooked.

This was great! I recommend this recipe and will make it again myself very soon! Had it with a bowl of grated cheddar, hot sauce and a nice cold beer.

too bland.  Fresh garlic, chili powder, worchesteshire, and hot sauce give this recipe a little more taste.

This is great. My friends and family loved it, and they love Cajun Foods of all kinds, my boyfriend does not like seafood, so it was great to find another recipe without seafood that I could fix for him.

Makes a massive amount of food; definitely best for large families, or if you like a lot of leftovers. Absolutely fills my huge pot. Besides that, it's amazingly delicious. I love making this. Recommend for everyone to try.

Only thing that I changed was to use Cajun Seasoning in place of the cayenne. This makes a lot and it's delicious!

Did not care for it at all. Used Cajun spice seasoning on chicken prior to browning and a combination of smoked and andouille sausage.  Not enough sausage so I added more.  I will not make this again

Mixed emotions about this one. It's good. I knew going in that it would be bland, so I quadrupled the Cayenne to 1 tsp., added a little Tony Chachere's, a can of Ro-Tel, a pinch of garlic powder and marjoram. Good stuff!

Man Pleasin' Jambalaya: "He was kinda pleased. Really needs some seasoning. Only did two swaps." I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and cubed zucchini instead of carrot (never heard of these kinds of veggies in jambalaya, but both the man and I always prefer more vegetables anyways!) and only scaled back for the two of us to eat, using 1/2 lb. andouille sausage. I thought the andouille would provide enough flavor to everything else, since the only spice was cayenne pepper, but I was wrong. After it had simmered and I had a nibble, it tasted like, well, not a whole lot, so I added two heaping teaspoons of Cajun seasoning which significantly helped. I won't argue the "is-it-or-isn't-it" traditional jambalaya b/c I liked the taste and did enjoy it, but regardless of the recipe's title, as it is written is severely lacking in the flavor department.

This is a really easy recipe and with my busy life I need easy!  I bought some N'Orleans Cajun Seasoning by Webber and put a little more then recipe called for to spice it up a bit.  Nice thing about this recipe is that you can add to it to make more spice or just leave it how it is to keep it simple and easier on the kid's mouths.  I made fried pickles on the side and ceasar salad and it was an excellent meal.

This is a great recipe.  Was a big hit with my husband and kids.  I did add some ham, and used a little less broth and a can of crushed tomatoes instead. I also added 2 cloves of crushed garlic because I'm a big garlic lover.

Definitely a keeper.

Jambalaya doesn't have carrots in it ... is what my man says. :) He suggested more veggies and it would be great.

Very good recipe! Makes A LOT....instead of canned mushrooms, I sauteed 8 oz of sliced fresh and added them to the meat mixture. My husband likes Jambalaya more liquid, so I added more chicken stock after completing the cooking. Had some to freeze and leftovers for a couple of days. Tasty!!

This came out delicious.  Only change I made is adding an extra cup of rice.  I didn't have any mushrooms on hand so I didn't add those, but I definitely will be next time.
