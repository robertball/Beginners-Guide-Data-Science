Awesome recipe. I made this last night for Valentines dinner and we couldn't stop eating it! I used 2 fresh habaneros which I roasted @ 400*F for 10 minutes.Then threw shallots, garlic, and habaneros in food processor b-4 browning. I also added fresh chopped spinach to the pasta right after I drained it and heated some left over chicken breast. Warning Very Addicting!

This was really good and spicy.  I cut out a lot of fat by using 2 ounces of neufchatel cream cheese instead of heavy cream.  Also, I used a can of diced tomatoes with jalepenos and 1 fresh habanero pepper from my garden.  Next time I will add chicken to it.

Absolutely delicious. I made some slight modifications because of what I had available: I used a fresh habanero instead of a dried one, and I used grated Romano instead of grated Parmesan.

One word of caution to anyone who's going to cook this. I recommend wearing rubber gloves when handling the habanero, and when you're cooking it make sure you have plenty of ventilation in the kitchen. I almost went into a coughing spasm when I was browning the veggies due to the capsaicin that gets released in the air when the habanero is cooked, and it feels like someone started a fire under my finger nails. Just be careful. It's a delicious dish, and well worth the peril.

I added the following 1 small yellow squash,and zucchini; 1/2 cup sliced  fresh mushrooms and a quarter of a red pepper.  Make with 1/2 n 1/2 instead of cream.  Toasted some breadcrumbs with butter and baked as a casserole for 1/2 hour.  It would be good with tuna, salmon, grilled meat of any kind added.

I made this for my boyfriend and he shared with a co-worker. Both were impressed, and said that it was just spicy enough without being too spicy. However, VERY high in fat. I used spaghetti, a fresh habanero pepper (instead of dried), half & half (instead of cream), and half cup of grated Parm. cheese (instead of 1 cup). I also added sauteed shrimp & scallops. They loved it.

Wow! This DOES taste just like the Penne Rosa at Noodles & Company, which I can't get enough of. This was my first time using heavy cream, but I was quite pleased with how well the sauce turned out. The only modification was I used 1 whole, fresh habanero, since I couldn't find dried ones. No doubt about it, I'll be making this one over and over again. Thank you!

My husband and I love spicy recipes, so we used 3 habaneros.  We also doubled the pasta amount and used 16 oz of dried pasta.  There was still a lot of sauce left over, which I didn't mind because it makes good left overs

A nice base for a spicy cream sauce.  I like things fairly spicy so I used 2 dried habaneros but next time I will only use 1 as the extra perpper made the heat overtake the dish.  It is just a basic cream sauce however - further tweaking is needed in order to round out the flavours better.  I personally prefer the Calamari-in-a-Creamy-White-Wine-Sauce from the site for a nicely flavoured cream sauce with a little bit of kick.

Excellent taste!  From the previous ratings I was afraid to use a whole habanero, so I used half of one.  It wasn't spicy at all so next time I'll use a whole one.  I also added shrimp and spinach, as one person suggested, to make it a meal in itself.  So good!

The sauce was a little bland. A dash of salt pulls out the flavor more, but it is still lacking something.  I, personally, thought some fresh basil would make it amazing. I used a whole fresh pepper (seeded) and thought the heat wasn't bad at all.

I absolutely loved this!!  Having never cooked with habaneros, I was a little sceptical that one small pepper could pack so much punch.  Glad I only used the one, though -- it was perfect!  I tossed the sauce with some bowtie pasta, chicken, and spinach and then garnished with some sweet orange bell peppers.  It was beautiful and very, very tasty.  Will defintiely make this one again.

One word: HOT! As expected this is a pretty spicy dish. I cooked this per the recipe, with the addition of some shrimp and scallops to make it a full meal. The flavor was great. I love spicy food and while I enjoyed the heat in this dish, it would definately be a bit much for some. I would say it is just on the border of being too hot. The good news is that even though the habanero has a good size kick, the heat seems to cool off quickly after eating. I would make this again, but I may adjust the heat a little.

great recipe! I used a fresh habanero and a jalapeno and it tasted amazing (wearing gloves is a good idea, I touched my face like 2 hours afterwards and my eyes were watering like crazy.)  just the right amount of heat, could have even been hotter without compromising taste. It did get a bit too thick for my liking; next time I'll use less flour than recommended.

Travis, you are my hero! This was divine! I actually just made the sauce and served it over chicken. I used jalapeno instead of habanero, and added about 1/2 c. salsa instead of tomato. It was so good I wanted to eat it with a spoon! Thanks for the post!

I used spaghetti as my base for the "hot" sauce.  I omitted the oil and butter because of spray oil, used a fresh habanero, and subbed soy milk for the cream, then I found that I needed an extra T of whole wheat flour(I didn't use ap flour).  I served the sauce on the spaghetti, topped it with the chopped tomatoes, and sprinkled on the cheese.  This warms you up as it goes down when warm!  As a leftover, the "heat" isn't quite as intense!  Great idea!

Like others, I used fresh habaneros. Also threw in a handful of sliced mushrooms that needed using up. Served it with garlic bread and salad. Not bad at all. Thanks!

This dish has become a staple in our house--it is absolutely mouthwateringly delicious! The only thing I did differently was to use a fresh habanero instead of dried, (I scraped the seeds and it was still really hot for me, but my husband asked me to keep them in next time--guess I'll eat with kleenex next time I make this!), I added 2 chicken breasts, cooked and cubed (you could also flour them if you want), I changed the parmesan cheese to 1/2 a cup--that was plenty, and stirred in about a cup of chopped spinach right at the end. I attempted this with a jalapeno last time I made it and kept the 1 cup of parmesan cheese--there is a reason it's called Habanero Pepper Cream Pasta--you won't get any spice out of the jalapenos unless you maybe add like, 4 or 5 or more, and the 1 cup of parmesan was too much. I'll go back to the original recipe with the habenero and just cut the parmesan--it's  become one of my husband and I's top favorites!!!

We loved this recipe!  I used a whole fresh habanero because we could not find a dried one.  I agree you will need 16 oz of pasta for all of the sauce.  Our sauce was super thick.  Next time we'll add less flour and a little less cheese.

I loved the spicy/creamy flavor of this sauce!  I was a little bit anxious that it would come out too spicy, but it was just right for my entire family.  I couldn't find dried habanero peppers so I used 2 fresh peppers with seeds and white membranes removed.  I used kitchen gloves to handle them and diced them up very small.  I also served sliced roasted chicken breasts on the side and my whole family stuffed themselves!  This also provided leftovers that worked very well for a couple of lunches.  I'll definitely make this again!

This was fantastic!  I had a few modifications: I used a fresh habanero (one was perfect), half & half instead of heavy cream, and I didn't have a tomato, so I used a can of diced tomatoes w/green peppers and onions.   It took a little longer for my sauce to thicken -more like 15 minutes, but I will definitely make this dish again.  My husband loved it too.

This pasta dish was great.  I loved the spicy flavor, but I didn't like the chunks of pepper in my pasta.  Next time, I'll puree the sauce in the blender before adding it to the pasta.

I'm honestly surprised by the reviews for this recipe. There is SO much wrong with it.  First of all, it is WAY too spicy.  I love spicy foods (can't get enough Thai food), but this was CRAZY hot. I even removed all of the seeds from my peppers. I would use no more than half of a pepper for this recipe. Second, it is SO bland. I tested the sauce throughout the cooking process and felt it needed salt.  I kept assuming, however, that the cheese would add the needed flavor...NOPE. Had to add a good bit of salt to get any flavor.  I will not make this again.

OMG this was SO good!  I cut down on the parmesan cheese as other reviewers mentioned, I omitted the butter, I used rotini instead of cavatappi, I used minced garlic, a fresh habanero pepper (instead of a dried one) and I added chicken and mushrooms.  Definitely make sure you let it simmer and thicken, tastes so much better.  Also I added some salt.  My fiancé was in heaven!  DELICIOUS!

I made this a couple weeks ago--it was so good.  I used fresh habanero since my grocery store didn't have dried.  It was spicy, but not overwhelming.  I would suggest adding chicken or shrimp to it, however.  I found the tomatoes sort of...refreshed what may have otherwise been a very creamy/rich dish.

I review everything that I try from allrecipes - this is the first recipe of many that I didn't like.  It was OK, but not good enough for all of the fat in it!  Not even close -  I'm not super healthy at all and I absolutely love spicy food.  It was missing something too - maybe a splash of white wine.  I will not be making this again.

I love this recipe!  I couldn't find a habenero pepper at our local grocery store so I substituted a chipotle pepper for the habenero.  I chop one chipotle pepper that comes in the adobe sauces.  It tastes great!

I was expecting more from this habanero cream pasta. The taste was good but I thought it would be more spicy, I added 2 fresh habaneros with the seeds and membranes in half of one. I thought it would be spicy and my mouth would be burning but it wasn't at all. Might try again with three habaneros and the seeds in all of them.    **** edit **** I brought this for lunch today and it was soooo good and really spicy, I wish I had more. My nose won't stop running and I am so hot right now LOL. So much better the next day. Will def. make again!! Thank you. Changed from 3 stars to 5 stars.

This was AWESOME!  I didn't have a habanero pepper, so I just replaced it with some red pepper flakes instead and it was absolutely DELICIOUS.  I also added some grilled chicken to it to make it a whole meal and it was perfect.  My husband and I could not stop eating it!  I will try it with a habanero pepper next time since that's kinda the point of the recipe.

I liked the sauce, but next time I think I would cut some of the parmesan cheese out; it was a little much. I skipped the flour step, since the sauce was thick enough with all the cheese. I used two habaneros that I oven-roasted. I could have easily used four or maybe even five! This recipe does yield a lot of sauce, which I liked considering I used a larger box of pasta.

Probably the one good recipe I have for using habaneros.  Mellows them out with the cream.  I grill them outside first to release essence

This was very good. I used one fresh habanero from the garden and had no shallots so used about 1/2 a white onion with an extra garlic clove for the loss of shallot flavor. I sauteed garlic, onion,habanero, then once it was brown I added canned mushrooms and cut up grilled chicken breasts. Then added 2 cups of evaporated milk which I had whipped the flour into as well as salt and pepper. Heated and simmered then added a bit less than 3/4 c parmesan.Sauce was thick but we love it that way. Served with chopped roma tomatoes on top with side of green peas (just to get a bit of relief from the deliciously hot n spicy forkfuls. Will make again for sure. Bowtie pasta perfect with it. hubby keeps saying how spolied he is haha he loves it too. Thanks for making me keep looking like a pro in my kitchen!

Delicious! I have made this recipe twice.  I used a fresh habanero which makes it very spicy!  The only comment I can make is I find the sauce can get too thick so I only add 1 tbsp of flour and if it's still too thick, I thin it out with some white winte.

I grow and freeze habanero peppers just to make this.  It is just wonderful with grilled chicken sausage served on the side.  I've even used canned diced tomatoes and half and half and it's still wonderful.

This was very tasty.  If you like spicy pasta dishes you will love it.  We doubled it to have some leftovers to save, probably shouldn't have doubled the habanero because it was VERY hot, but luckily we like spicy so it wasn't a disaster.  It is clearly not the healthiest dish but could easily be made with some substituted healthier ingredients.  We steamed some broccoli to a soft state and added it as a topping - made a great flavor combo.  Also, we used bowtie pasta (faralle) instead and it looked nice as well as tasted good.

This recipe was very good!  It was definitely a hit with my friends, especially when I added some grilled chicken strips to it. 
Word to the wise: WEAR GLOVES when handling habaneros! The burn from the capsacin is awful if you're not careful!

This pasta is awesome!!! Tastes a lot like the Penne Rosa at Noodles and Company (which is one of my favorite dishes!!) I added a handful of sliced mushrooms and a handful of spinach to make it similar to the Penne Rosa I love so much. If you don't like spicy food, this recipe is not for you. It is HOT!! I would maybe use a 1/2 dried habanero next time. Top with shredded mozzarella or parmesan or even some crumbled feta cheese. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!!

Alike a previous review, I also blended the garlic, pepper, and tomato. I did roast and use nearly a full garlic bulb, and also roasted and used two habenero. Yes, very hot! Use one or switch to Serrano or jalapeño if you want more mild.

This sauce was delicious my 15 year old absolutely loved it!
 I used a small fresh habanero pepper instead of a dried one. I wore gloves and used a fork and knive to cut the habanero pepper. I also threw out the seeds from the habanero pepper. 
I made 16 oz of pasta there was plenty of sauce.
Next time I make this recipe I will only use 1 tablespoon of flour as the sauce was very thick.

Definitely needed salt. Used one fresh habernero along with half the seeds....very spicy!! Also used three Roma tomatoes. Used less parmasan then called for. Also added a chopped zucchini and orange pepper for a nice vegetarian meal. Rich and downright delicious!

Added salt, nutmeg, and sugar.  Used two habaneros perfectly spicy. Very little mouth heat but warms you from the inside out.

Awesome recipe! I have used it many times, and it lends well to alterations & substitutions. I ran out of habaneros today, and used 3 dries red chillis instead; This time I added Sun Dried tomatoes, chopped asparagus and garlic sausage for a treat and WOW was it good. No leftovers at my house. This is a must try.

Fantastic recipe!!Used the fresh habanero as well. I am always surprised when I see other reviews that say "it was very good, but high in fat". Shocking, 2 cups of heavy cream will do that. I recommend going for a walk after dinner, if you can move after gorging yourself on this fantastic dish!!  We added 2 pounds of peeled and veined jumbo's as we do like seafood in our past. Will make again!! thanks Stef.

This dish is fantastic. It did have some heat to it, but I grilled some shrimp and added it to this recipe. I was perfect. I too, per other reviews used a cup of diced canned tomatoes since tomatoes are not in season. I will stick with that change when I make this again.

After all the reviews, I don't know if I did something wrong, but I just thought it was "so-so".  The only change I made was using half and half like some others. I think it needed something else.

This was an awesome, unique recipe.  I did get lazy the second time I made it and just added the pepper and onion to a jar of pre-made alfredo sauce.  I also added it to raviloi.  My husband commented that both recipes were the best things I had ever made-but I like the ease and convience of just spicing up a jar of alfredo sauce and it's a little lower in fat.

Pretty darn good.  I used half and half to save on calories and fat AND added another half of dried habanero pepper for more kick.  Will definitely keep this one for future use.

Made as per recipe. One word describes this dish, delicious! One habanero pepper was enough for my sons and I. My husband said three would have been great! I added some shrimp and oh my, hmmmmm good! Thanks for sharing the recipe. Can't wait to make it again!

This dish had a nice spice to it, but I felt it needed salt.  Adding the spinach and shrimp also made it a more complete meal.

Fabulous!  I made this with penne pasta, roasted a fresh habenaro from my garden, and added grilled chicken.  It was wonderful.

I adore this recipe!  I have made it twice now and I find it delicous and easy.  The pasta is something I have never used before and I really liked the texture.  The second time I made this I added Jumbo shrimp.  I will make this again and again!  LOVED IT!!!

Wonderful recipe! I have been looking for a recipe similar to Lipton's pasta Jalapeno Jack. Couldn't resist trying it, and there are no regrets! Perfect Consistency! I love spicy food, and this definitely left me with a "burning sensation!" I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of shallots. I rubbed them with Intalian herbs,freshly ground pepper, and Montreal Chicken seasoning from McCormick. I baked them in a tin-foiled covered, glass cake pan with water (the water should not go over the top of the chicken breasts) and a few thin slices of butter for about an hour at 350 degrees F. I did not have a full cup of parmesan, so I put about a half a cup of mozzeralla in the sauce. Combine pasta, sauce, and chicken for a warming and filling meal!

very good recipe - full of fat, though.  I think you could use half and half and still have great flavor.  Used only one habanero from the garden.  I also added one large chicken breast (pan-fried and cut into bite size pieces). Delicious!

Good amount of heat but lacks the depth of some sauces. Definitely something to play with according to your own taste! I used farfalle pasta and it worked great!

Great recipe!  I made it as a side to one of my favorite spicy chicken recipes and it all went together perfectly.  My roommates were big fans, too.  Delicious and simple to make, I think this dish will make a frequent appearance at our house.

This was delicious and addictive!  Made as written, but may try half and half or even milk next time to cut down on some fat!  May add some lump crab meat or shrimp, too!  Excellent - thank you!

Excellent recipe- Used five habaneros (too much will go down to three/four next time but only if you LOVE LOVE spicy use that many).  Also, threw in broccoli, chicken, shrimp and served over shells type pasta (like in velveeta, great decision).  Delicious!

I used two fresh habaneros and bowtie pasta, and added broccoli.  Everyone is already asking me to make this again. It would be great with shrimp.

I really liked this recipie.  It had just enough spice that it was good with out being over powering.  I think it would also be good with broccoli added to the sauce.

first of all, the fat in this recipe is WAY too much, so i tried to cut down on it a little, maybe that was the down fall of this recipe. i did not like it at all. the spicy is just right but everything else is wrong. my husband said he didn't mind eating it, but it definately was NOT a make again.
