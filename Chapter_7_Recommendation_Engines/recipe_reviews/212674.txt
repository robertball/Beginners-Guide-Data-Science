Yummy! I'm not a fan of sweet desserts (this has 1 cup of sugar), but this was pretty good. The first flavor to hit is the sugar, followed by the almond as you start to chew, and ending with a slightly menthal-y aftertaste from the cardamom. Using a mortar and pestle was a pain, as always, but I'll probably make this again the next time I have the ingredients on hand. Thank you, SUSMITA, for yet another delicious recipe!
