A hit! I used country bone in pork ribs. I made the sauce according to direction but I didn't have any steak sauce and used a splash of soy sauce and put a bit more garlic in. The 3 men in my house went ga-ga over this. I thought it might taste a smidgen too ketchupy but the guys  absolutely loved it and said I was crazy - lol. This did make a gooey sauce that stuck to the ribs and didn't run off. The meat literally fell away from the bone. We will make this again and again. Thank you for a new family favorite.

I made this with country style boneless ribs. I put them in the crockpot ontop of a layer of vidiala onions. When they were done I transfered them to a baking pan and spread "The Sauce" on both the bottom and tops and baked at 350 for 1/2 hour. Wonderful! I had cut "The Sauce" recipe in 1/2 and still had a ton left. A few days later I made a oven roasted brisket from Paula Deen and served the remaining sauce with it. Dh now will eat it no other way! Will definatly use "The Sauce" when ever we BBQ! Thanks for posting!

These are by far the very best ribs I have ever made.  The meat falls right off the bone.  And the sauce is to die for.  I plan on using this sauce for different meats also.  I had someof the sauce left over so I brushed it on Chicken breasts.  They were just as good as the ribs.  It is the sauce that is the real killer in this recipe.  I like to just make batches of the sauce and keep it in the fridge for just about any type of meat.  Give it a try.

Hi all:
This is Sylvia, originator of this recipe. I don't know how my recipe got on this site but I sure am glad everyone likes them so much. Thank you for your great reviews.  These are my daughter's favourite. Such a versatile recipe as well don't you think?
Cheers,
Sylvia

This was a hit with my family.  I had bought a cheaper cut of spare ribs that were ok, next time I'll spend the extra for a better cut and it'll be great.  Lots of sauce, I saved it and will use it for something soon. Enjoy:)

I disagree with the reviewer who said that bottled sauce would be better. This sauce was super! I added finely chopped onion and bottled chili sauce and soy sauce to taste. It was excellent! I always parboil ribs before grilling, but I've never finished them off in the oven as this recipe directs.  The texture and flavor of the meat really reminded me of carolina pulled pork. YUMMY!!!  One suggestion -- Add a quatered onion, some crushed fresh garlic, peppercorns and salt to the cooking water. It really adds depth of flavor to the meat itself. I've also added beer and/or apple cider vinegar to the cooking water in past. Mmmm!!

Really good ribs with a tangy/sweet sauce. Makes more than enough sauce. Could probably cut sauce recipe in half. I always add a beer to the water when boiling ribs. Gives it a little extra flavor. Thanks so much!

This is a great base recipe, but it needs to be changed to suit your taste.  I made as stated and it was very good but we thought it had a little too much ketchup.  Will make again and experiment with the rations of ingredients!

This is a keeper recipe! I ran short of ketchup and made it up with BBQ sauce, but it came out fine. We used Sonny's Mild BBQ sauce for a sweet sauce, but the pork came out like Carolina BBQ - tender enough to eat with a fork. We substituted 5 lbs country style pork ribs for the 2 lbs spareribs and still had a smidgen of sauce left (which I will save). Thank you for a wonderful way to cook ribs inside the house. My husband and mother both want me to make this again - frequently.

The bomb. I had to make my 8 year old get up from the table.  The whole family loved them.  I made triple the recipe except for the ketchup. The presentation was beautiful as well.  Thanks for making our Sunday dinner delicious.

These were fall off the bone good!  Thanks for a great, quick rib recipe.  I did everything according to the directions only I added a couple tsps of chili paste to give it a kick.  I couldn't stop tasting the sauce while it was simmering. : )

my husband and I absolutely loved these ribs.  I used a bbq sauce that had molasses in it and I cut the recipe in half since we only used one rack.  Superb, it will become a standard in our home.

Hands down the best ribs I have ever had.  I personally make the sauce without the garlic, the steak sauce, or the hot pepper sauce and it has been a huge hit with my family (and not just on the ribs!).

These are awesome!  I never vary from the original recipe the first time I make something - and I'm glad I didn't with these.  The second time I made them, I didn't quite have all the ingredients so these are the changes I made - 1) used less ketchup - only 1 1/2 cups. 2) Didnt have any worcestershire, so I used 1/3 cup of liquid smoke. 3) I used the rest of the ingredients as stated.  The only other thing I did different was I added the garlic to the meat while it was boiling and also threw in a sliced onion.  Either way you make these, you absolutely CAN'T go wrong.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I have been using this recipe for some time now and then forget to review. I have always boiled my ribs for an hour but never really had a great recipe for the sauce...that has now changed. This is absolutely wonderful!!! If you love your ribs, this is the way to do them! I've also done them this way in the slow cooker...just as good.

We used Pork shoulder ribs, and used the grill rather than the over.  These were the best ribs ever!

Excellent!!  I followed the recipe exactly, but also added more to it.  When boiling the ribs I added a can of beer to the water.  In making the sauce I added onion, a lot more garlic, soy sauce, and sweet chili sauce.  I've made this so many times, but it just keeps getting better and better!!!!

These ribs were  definitely fall off the bone, which was fantastic. I really liked this recipe and will do it agian. I found the sauce to be too sweet, though I didnt use steak sauce so maybe that's what it was missing.

I will admit that I picked this recipe because my mom's name is Sylvia.  Silly, yes, but it definitely worked out okay, because these were fantastic.  I cut the recipe in half because I only had four pounds of ribs, and for my very first time making ribs, these were very tasty.  They were messy and gooey and good.  If you like sweet and tangy, then you will really go for this recipe.

These ribs were the best I ever made!!  I didn't have all the ketchup requesyed in the recipe, but they turned out great nonetheless. My hubby (who didn't like ribs before) had nothing but rave reviews! A definite keeper.

Great base recipe. You can add to it or leave out to your taste. We skipped the sugar, lemon juice, hot sauce and steak sauce and it still tasted great.  Pappy's Steak Sauce was perfect for this!

I have never boiled ribs before and was not picturing a good outcome.  But these were awesome!!!  Some of the most tender ribs I've ever made.  Only reason for the 4-star rating is that they were just a tad sweet for me.  But that can easily be adjusted next time.  Next time I also think I'll line my baking pan with foil - all the sugar from the sauce burned on the bottom and I think it might be a nightmare to clean.  Thanks, Sylvia!

Love it! I was sceptical at first like some about boiling the ribs and losing flavor of the meat (boiled meat ew) but it was fine. The only change I made was I added some lawrys seasoning to the water (thought what could it hurt). Now as for this sauce everyone is so gung ho about, I was not really feeling it while it was simmering on the stove. I followed the recipe pretty close. Used only 2 cups of ketchup after reading the other reviews because I hate a ketchupy sauce. Cut back on the sugar a little because I used KC masterpiece Honey for the bbq sauce and I didn't want it to be too sweet. I added a little sauteed onions and soy sauce also. It was really thick so I thinned it out with a little of the cooking liquid from the ribs. There was a ton of sauce since I only used 2.5 lbs of spareribs but I love my ribs smothered in sauce and these definitely were. They were awesome. Tender and flavorful. Sauce turned out perfect after baking the ribs in it. This ones a keeper for me. Thanks!

This is the first time I've ever boiled ribs before baking them in sauce...and I'll NEVER EVER go back to the old way again! They were moist, flavorful and very tender. Loved the 'jazzed up' bbq sauce too. I ended up using more BBQ sauce...2:1 ratio to ketchup. Tasted fantastic. 

Next time the only thing I'll change is to make MORE RIBS!

Delicious!  A big hit!  I loved the sauce, however, I did cut it in half like many others did, and I still had plenty!

This sauce was great! We had it over ribs and pork chops so far and I still have a whole bottle left! I did change a few of the amounts... I used 2 cups of ketchup and 2 cups of BBQ sauce and the rest of the amounts stated in the recipe and I think it came out perfect!

Great recipe except I never, ever, ever, never, never boil ribs - hence the 4 out of 5 stars. I just added the ingredients to the ribs and put them in the oven. You end up losing SO much flavor and the meat isn't as juicy because most of the fat ends up in the water. You need the fat for self basting and that also enhances flavor! You just end up "masking" the taste and juiciness with the sauce.

Wow!  These are so good. I admit, I was a bit skeptical about the sauce as it sounded like someone opened their refrigerator door and started dumping stuff in the pan, but it is AMAZING!  Sticky and sweet and oh so good.  I used baby back ribs because that's what I had.  It was one rack and just over 3.5 pounds.  I halved the sauce due some reviews I read and it turned out perfect.  However, I would not halve the sauce recipe if I were cooking the entire 8 lbs ribs called for in the recipe (some suggested you do this).  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Bottom line, I almost halved the meat and I halved the sauce.  That's the only changes I made.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The sauce is absolutely fantastic. Just make sure to watch it when it's on the stove and medium heat was to high on the electric because it started bubbling and splattering and made a huge mess. Also, if your using country style boneless ribs I wouldn't recommend taking the foil off when in the oven, because mine turned out too chewy. Sauce is great though!!

Totally AWESOME recipe. I would give this a 10 star if I could. I did not boil the ribs first. I always found that it took flavor away. I put a rub on the ribs baked at 250 for 3 hours then put that delecious sauce on the ribs and baked at 350 degrees for 1 hour.. Awesome.. My family can't get enough of this.

I wish I could give this 10 stars! We have declared these ribs the best we have ever fixed! Fanastic and then some! They were so tender that they fell right off the bone. Instead of boiling them as the recipe stated, I placed them in a dish and added some seasonings, covered with foil and baked for an hour. Then I followed the recipe by baking another hour with the sauce on. Couldn't have been any better! Thanks so much, Sylvia!!!! :o)

Yummy in my tummy good.  I ran out of katcup and only used 1/2 what the recipe calls for and the BBQ sauce was a BBQ sauce with onion.  It was heavenly.  It's so good, I can eat the entire 2 lb. of ribs.

Delicious and simple recipe! I fed my boyfriend's parents who are from Spain and had only ever tried american ribs from Tony Romas. They were amazed that they tasted better than the restaurant. I added some fresh dill and sesame seeds to the sauce to give it an extra kick and it turned out delicioso. 
Great recipe! Thanks for sharing

I liked how easy it was to make this dish. The instructions were very simple and the sauce was delicious! My husband loved the ribs... I loved how tender the meat was. It just fell off the bone but I think I prefer my ribs to be grilled rather than baked. But other than that this was a great recipe that I will defintely try again.

OH MY!!  Excellent sauce!  I did mine a little differently by adding 1/4 katsup plus the 2 tbsp and 3/4 c tomato sauce, a full clove of garlic and did a dry rub first, let them cook in the oven for 1 1/2 hrs, then put them on the grill to finish cooking for about 20 min or so while the sauce is cooking.  You could either baste on the sauce then, or after they come off, we put it on immediately and wrapped or tented it with foil.  WOW!  Thank you for the recipe!!!

These were great and really easy to make. Per some advice in the reviews I cut out 1/4 cup of ketchup and added 1/4 cup BBQ sauce. A lot of people have said that the sauce end of this recipe ended up being too much, I halved the recipe all together and I had Bo more than an 1/8th of a cup left.

Thanks for the recipe!!

This was a very easy tasty way to make ribs.  I was looking for an easy quick way to make ribs and I found it!   These were a big hit in my house, everyone really enjoyed them.  And the left overs were just as good.

Delicious! I put everything into the crock pot and cook on low for 8 hours. Doubled the garlic and  used SBR's Hickory Brown Sugar sauce  and a drop of Thai Sweet Chili sauce. Also a tbsp of onion powder. Was a tiny bit sweet (my fault for the BBQ sauce choice...just too much sugar)...so I added chipotle pepper sauce (approx 1/4 tsp) and 1/2 tbsp of cider vinegar to tone it down. Came out great. After removing from crock pot, broiled under low heat for 15 min to candy coat the sauce on the ribs! Seriously great recipe!!!! Must try!

Amazing! Exactly what I was looking for. However I did marinate the ribs in a pork marinade for 24 hours and added marinade to water to boil. I added diced onions and soy sauce to rib sauce and reduced the amount of ketchup to 2 cups.

This is the first review I have ever written on this site. I have used dozens of recipes from here but tend to take bits and pieces from a few similar ones and blend them together to make my own dish. I decided that Sunday was the day that I would actually follow a recipe to the "T". I had spare ribs in the fridge and decided on your recipe as it held a trustworthy 5 star rating. I AM SO GLAD I DID! These ribs were fall off the bone delicious!! I must admit that I began the sauce mixture with only half the recommended amount of Ketchup because I was nervous it would be dominating. After trying that mix I went back and added the remaining recommended serving as the sauce tasted very potent and I figured the Ketchup would tone it back down. I made the right choice because they turned out beautifully! Guarunteed my Fiance will be asking me to make these on a regular basis! 

Thank you Sylvia for a perfect recipe!!

Awesome!  Gave 4 stars because I had to tweak for my own taste. Went by directions and cooked the sauce, but thought it needed something.  Molasses may have helped, but I didn't have any.  It was good on it's own, but I wanted a little more depth, so I added about another cup of BBQ sauce and a splash of liquid smoke.  Tasted again and was perfect.  The only other change I made was I put them on the grill instead of in the oven.  Everyone raved!  This was my first time attempting ribs on my own (hubby is a chef so I rarely cook) and even he loved it!  Thanks for an amazing recipe!

The whole family thought it was delicious!!!  I only used 2 lbs of country style ribs so used about 1/4 of each ingredient.

These were the best ribs I have ever had. We didnt boil them and did ours on the grill under low heat. Added 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, 1/3 cup margarine, and a tsp of thyme to the sauce. They were amazing!! My husband requested them again for this weekend! :)

I can only rate the BBQ sauce. I made the sauce to go with a brisket recipe I found here on allrecipes. One person reviewing mentioned she used the sauce from Sylvia's ribs. This sauce is really very good. I told hubby I made home-made BBQ sauce, He was like ok, but when he tated he raved over and over about how good it tasted. Will definately use the sauce again and cant wait to try the rib recipe you have. KUDOS!

AHA!! I found the secret. The reason some people have had trouble with this recipe. Last week Hubby bought baby back ribs. But not enough to suit me, and not enough to have leftovers! When he picked up more on his way home yesterday, he had gotten pork spareribs. Like from adult porkers. I mixed all the ribs together to boil, then bake. Not surprisingly, the BABY backs were perfect. The big ones were horrible. I took a bite, chewed, chewed, and ended up spitting it out. Today I took all the big ribs, put them in a baking dish with water, covered, then steamed on low heat for 2 1/2 hours.
PERFECTION! Added a little more sauce to perk them up after cooking, left covered. So happy.

These were really good . I think a hour of boiling was too much , maybe next time  I might try cutting back to 45 minutes to see if it makes a difference , I all so added a little soya sauce and onion salt to the sauce and salt in the water while boiling . These were really good though and I would do them again . I am not a rib person but I like these ribs

These ribs are AWESOME and the sauce is AMAZING! I like my ribs to have a smoky taste, so I added a dash of liquid smoke along with everything else. I made the ribs according to the recipe the first time and they were perfect. The second time I tossed everything into the crockpot and they were just as wonderful! I'm looking forward to more of Sylvia's recipes...thanks for sharing!

This was the first time I've really made ribs and this recipe didn't let me down!  The only thing I changed was I didn't add the steak sauce since I don't like it.  The ribs were tender and flavorful.  Will make again!  Thanks.

Made this for my sons birthday dinner, the whole family loved it!! This will become a regular in our house. The ketchup seemed kinda of much so I started with 1 1/2 cup and slowly added more to taste while it cooked. I also put in little more of the bbq sauce. Tasted fantastic. Great recipe.

Loved this sauce - a little sweet then the spicy comes at the end. Used Country Pork ribs and they were falling off the bone. Will be keeping this one around!

These where so good, the best ive made, do not over boil the meat, one hour max,  and i did bake them covered for about 45-60 minutes before uncovering, rebaste and cook uncovered (took a good 40 plus minutes uncovered to get them to brown, REMEMBER dont rush the cooking, drink beer while waiting, it enhances the ribs!

So delicious.  Everyone enjoyed them at the SuperBowl party and asked for the recipe.  I didn't need that much sauce so I reduced the amounts.  I used 1 cup of ketchup instead of 3 and reduced the spices by 1/3.  I used A1 sauce instead of Heinz 57 and all went well.

Mmmmm!  Made these for dinner yesterday, Hubby and his brother devoured them.  The kids weren't big on them.  Put them on the BBQ on low for about 45mins basting and turning instead if the oven.  Will make again for sure.

I use this recipe everytime I make pork spare ribs... The meat literally falls off the bone, and the sauce is super sticky and delicious. I do make a few changes to the sauce, but stick to the same ingredients. These are so good!

Finger-licking good! I added whole cloves and peppercorns to the boiling water for extra zing, and it was a great compliment to the BBQ sauce.  My husband requested it for his birthday dinner.

I made this recipe exactly as follows and all I can say is this is WONDERFUL! I like how the sauce kind of carmalized a little bit and stuck to the ribs. I will add this to my favorites and make again.

I don't understand the all the good reviews. Tasted like ketchup on ribs. Ribs need a much longer/slower cook than this to come out good. My family did not care for this.

I loved this sauce. It has just a little bite if you make it according to recipe. I steam my ribs in oven rather than boiling. I cooked @ 250 for 4 hrs.(covered with foil) or until tender. Refrigerated overnight and then I sauced them on a baking sheet and finished the recipe. I added more sauce after I removed the foil. ( I brushed the the ribs rather than pouring suce all over.) I only made 1/2 the amount called for. Company loved them!

Followed recipe exact and used 1 rack spareribs and 1 rack baby backs. It was delicious! I saved this recipe over 2 years ago and finally got around to using it. During the boil I added in sliced onions, soy sauce, crushed garlic, and some vinegar. You could add any spice/seasoning and I'm sure it would be delicious. My husband shredded some leftovers to make pork sandwiches the next day.

The Best BBQ sauce I ever made or tasted hands down. I used Sweet Baby Rays as the BBQ sauce ingredient in the recipe. I cut the sauce recipe in half and that was plenty. Will boil the ribs only 30 minutes next time. Then cooked as directed in oven for 1 hr., did not need the extra 30 min. cooking time uncovered, they were already falling off the bones. Will try the sauce recipe with country ribs & chicken. Thank you Sylvia!

I have finally found my rib recipe! Followed recipe exactly, except for I threw in a few garlic cloves and a splash of liquid smoke into the water that I boiled the ribs in.  I used baby back ribs and a honey garlic BBQ sauce.  I love how the sauce actually sticks to the ribs.  They were nice and tender and I didn't have to slow cook them all day.  A definite keeper, thank you so much Sylvia!  Update:  I've learned that if you're using a sweet BBQ sauce, it's best to either cut down the sugar by half or eliminate completely.  I've used this on chicken too - both in the slow cooker (shredded after cooking for a BBQ chicken sandwich) and on the grill.

This will be my first time posting a review. I had to rave about these ribs. They were absolutely delicious. I've never had ribs so good. I didn't have any steak sauce so I used worcestershire sause again in its place. I made sure I cut the ribs b/t each bone. I think this way they soak up the most flavor. I can't say enough about these ribs. I could eat them once a week every week. I will be trying this sauce on a lot of meats now.

Really good!  I loved how thick and gooey the sauce was. I added some liquid smoke and I didn't have lemon juice so I substituted some vinegar.  Hubby enjoyed this during Sunday night football.  Will make again!

These ribs were decent.  I used it on pork ribs, which are fattier yet more flavorful than beef ribs.  Boiling them for so long seemed to remove most of the flavor, and didn't seem to get rid of much of the fat.  The meat ended up very tender, and tasting mostly of the sauce.  I prefer to use a rub on my ribs, bake them for 1-2 hours in a slow oven, then cover them with a barbecue sauce and grill or broil them for a few minutes.  They're still tender, and they haven't had all their natural flavor  boiled away.

Great recipe! I used my favorite bottled bbq sauce and doctored it a bit more instead of making my own. This was my first time making ribs and they turned out extremely tender and tasty. Will definitely make again.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  He said it was the best ribs that he has ever eaten.  I cut the recipe in half and doubled the amount of ribs and it was just right.  They are great heated up too.  Thanks.

These ribs were absolutely delicious.  I doubled the recipe and I have enough sauce leftover to feed an army.  Okay though because I'll make them again soon.  Also, I'll use some of the leftover sauce for chicken.

I made this dish for dinner and my husband and myself absolutely loved them.  My husband normally dislikes ribs, but this is now a new fav.  I followed the recipe fairly closely and will take away two learnings for next time - I'm going to reduce the amount of sugar next time as I found it a little too sweet, and, I'll add a couple more dashes of hot pepper sauce to give the ribs a bit more of a kick.  Overall a great recipe!

These were very yummy. I ran out of garlic (HERESY) and substituted garlic powder and a little onion powder for my taste. Worked out very very well! I reduced the recipe to 2lbs, and the rest of the ingredients accordingly and it was still wonderful! Next time though, I'm going to try pear juice(or puree) substituted for the lemon juice to try and make them even more tender.

This was perfection! My kids cleaned their plates and asked for seconds.  I used a Jack Daniels bbq sauce and used baby back ribs as my meat of choice.  A great meal for under $20.

My kids devoured these. They said multiple times that they were better than their favorite BBQ joint. The sauce is awesome and does produce extra. I lowered bake temp and increased bake time and they really did fall off the bone. Thanks for this wonderful family favorite.

Ok, let me just say these ribs are awesome!! Sweet, tangy and oh so good! I was using 5 lbs. of pork ribs, I halved the sauce and added about a TBS. of vinegar..I also put some dry spices on the ribs before adding the sauce. Can't wait to make these again!!

LOVE IT! I couldn't stop eating it. The only thing is I did not add steak sauce (didn't have any) and I added a little soy sauce (to calm the sweetness) and onions. The ribs were so tender and tastey. DEFINITELY A KEEPER.

I didnt add the Steak Sauce (didnt have any) and didnt put any hot sauce (my preference) and I absolutely loved these ribs. Sauce was fantastic! Make sure you cover the bottom of your baking pan in tinfoil before making these saucy ribs...otherwise its a pain to clean up - lesson learned.

I boiled my ribs for about 20 minutes, threw them in the crock pot on low with about half the BBQ sauce for about 5 hours.  Then I took them out and put them on a baking sheet, brushed them with the remaining BBQ sauce and baked about 15 minutes then I flipped them and brushed the other side and baked 15 more minutes.  These were the PERFECT ribs and it was the BBQ sauce that made them that way!  My husband (who rarely compliments a meal) couldn't stop raving about these ribs.  He even called his mother!  Thanks Sylvia for the recipe!  I'll be using this forever.

The ribs turned out great!...very tender and falling off the bone.  I've been wanting to find an oven based recipe for ribs for those times when we don't feel like grilling out or when it is inconvenient to do so.  I tried a few other recipes in the past.  The results were alright but not good enough to do again.  This one is a keeper.  The submitter of this recipe makes a good point about adjusting the ingredients to suite your tastes.  In our case, we used honey BBQ sauce because that's what we had on hand.  That combined with the brown sugar made the sauce much sweeter than we would have preferred.  Next time, we'll use a tangier BBQ sauce and reduce the amount of brown sugar.  The most important parts of this recipe are the actual cooking instructions.  The ingredients can be and should be experimented with and altered as you see fit so that you end up with the type of flavor you and your family prefer.

we usually use the baby back ribs recipe on this site but i had run out of barbeque sauce and couldn't marinate the ribs overnight. so i found this recipe which didn't need overnight prep and we found it tastier and more tender than the other recipe. albeit more work but worth it! i estimated all the ingredients and after baking as instructed, i basted the ribs with the rest of the sauce and placed it under the broiler until the sauce carmelized. delish!

Wish I would have read the review about not taking the foil off if using country style ribs...mine were way too chewy.  But it was the fault of the cook, not the recipe.  The sauce was great!

I halved the recipe and added 3 cloves on minced garlic and about 3 dashes of hot pepper sauce. Oh my God!!! So GOOD!! I will use this BBQ sauce from now on! Both of mt kids, ages 10 and 4 LOVED it. The 4 year old hardly ever eats meat so when she gave me the first compliment I knew it was a hit. Everyone cleaned the bones and they were oh so tender. We finished ours on the grill after a little over an hour of boiling. I just didn't want to turn on the oven considering it was over 100 degrees outside. VERY, VERY, VERY GOOD!! I will ONLY make my ribs this way from now on. I would give it 10 stars if I could! Definitely a MUST TRY.

I'm only rating the sauce because I cooked my ribs according to the Baby Back Ribs recipe on this site.  The sauce was good compared to most bottled barbecue sauces, but still not comparable to Sweet Baby Ray's.  Wish I hadn't diluted out my bottle of SBR's making this sauce.  Still, I would recommend this sauce if you don't have something as good as SBR's on hand.

The best sauce-EVER!  I'm about to make barbeque meatloaf with it.  I like how flexible it is.  I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and the ketchup to 2 cups.

My family loved this recipe.  I don't eat ribs so I didn't taste them, but they RAVED over them and said these were the best they ever had.  This was also my first time making ribs, so if you're new too, start with this one.

YUMMM!!!  I have searched high and low for a good ribs recipe, and I have finally found it!  My husband loves it, he said this would be a good dish to serve to company.  The sauce actually sticks to the ribs, and by boiling them first, they come out nice and soft, amazing!!!

Delicious, finger licking good ribs. Mine were so tender they fell off the bone. I used 1 rack of St Louis style ribs and 1 rack of baby back ribs. I did not double the sauce as it made plenty for both. I think the next time I will add a little liquid smoke though as I missed the smoky flavor from smoked ribs. I didn't have lemon juice so I used cider vinegar instead. I served this with creamy spiced coleslaw, baked beans, and deviled eggs, for an indoor BBQ. Thanks Sylvia for sharing!

This is one of the best rib recipes that we have ever had.  I have a refrigerator smoker and enjoy the 5-12 hour smokes but I dont think my wife will let me anymore!!!  She took the leftovers to work and her co workers called me to rave!  I didnt change anything but have tried it now with spareribs and riblets. The wifes says they are better than applebees!  Great recipe!

These were very good, when I asked my family to rate them they all said 5, I myself gave it a 4.5, I think they probably should've cooked a little longer and they were a little too gooey.

First time to try ribs cooked this way.  Definitely prefer the dry method, dipping the ribs in sauce each bite to minimize the sauce.  It seems this way it's like eating pork flavored sauce rather then ribs.  Sauce was too sweet, too strong, killed the rib flavor (but then, I think where I'm from, when you use sauce it's one that's more spicey then sweet).  Didn't find this method any more tender then the dry/smoked way, so not sure why people stick with boiling.

I bought ribs on sale and then was afraid to make them and have them turn out too dry and tough. I also didn't want too much salt.   I searched and found this recipe.  I made the ribs for my husband's birthday. They turned out great! What a relief!
After reading some of the other comments I made the following changes; I added 2 beers to the water for boiling.
I used only 2 cups ketchup but added 1 cup Sweet Baby Rays and 1 cup Captain Curt's Jackpot Famous Boss Sauce (mild) omitted steak sauce because I didn't have any and added 6 dashes hot sauce.

They were a hit!

Thanks for the recipe!  I will confidently make them again.

Delious Mouth watering fall of the bone ribs made only half the sauce & it made enough to do 2 chicken legs plus enough ribs for 3 people. I used all the ingredients listed only added more hot sauce. This recipe is easy yes and it's a keeper.

Loved it!  I skipped the ketchup (we can't stand the stuff) and used more BBQ instead, and cooked these on the grill (watching the temp carefully!) but they were fantastic! Oh, and extra garlic of course.
I made it again. This time I had steak sauce  It makes a difference, I'm glad I picked some up.  I used 1/3 the sugar (we found it to be a little sweet). I think we have perfected this. Boy, that was easy!

These were WONDERFUL! Even my very picky and hard to please husband loved them! I used 2.5 pounds of boneless country ribs, cut the sauce recipe in half since I was using less meat, omitted the lemon juice (didn't have any on hand), used a cup less ketchup and a cup more barbecue sauce, and added a little onion powder. These were so tender and the sauce was amazing (ok, so I may have licked the spoon when I made the sauce). Thank you so much for sharing the recipe - I will definitely make it again soon!

Awesome ribs with a great sauce. Perfect timing with the boiling and baking. It came out perfect. I did not add Worcestershire sauce nor steak sauce (my choice). Wonderful recipe. Thanks.

This is the first time I've ever cooked spare ribs.I've gotta say these were really, really good.  I followed the recipe exactly. I used about a Tbsp of sriracha sauce as my hot sauce. Also, I used boar spare ribs. My kids, who don't like ribs, really like these. I was given permission to make these again.

The cooking technique is the key to this fabulous recipe!  I prepared only one rack and all I did was boil, add garlic salt and pepper then smothered the ribs in Sweet Baby Ray's sauce before popping them into the oven. My son couldn't stop eating them! Most delicious and definitely a keeper!

This was excellent! I added a can of crushed pineapple and cooked all in the crock pot for 4 hours (I didn't boil ribs first). There were no left overs!  Thanks for the recipe.

Love this recipe. I use beef ribs because I don't eat pork. Otherwise I strictly use this recipe as far as the other ingredients are concerned. Well, the ingredients, not the amounts. When I'm making the sauce, I like to check the flavor throughout the process and adjust to my taste buds. As many people have posted here, I would not use the ketchup serving suggested. I usually cut it in half and substitute more BBQ sauce. I use famous Dave's spicy sauce. Awesome!! Love the recipe. Also, I use a turkey roaster when it's oven time. I let them cook on a lower heat for a longer time. It's just my preference. Yummy yummy!!!

Everyone LOVED them.  This is my "go to" rib recipe for now on.  The only thing I did different was boil them the day before, cut them into individual ribs and put them in freezer bags overnight with the BBQ sauce.  I only did this because I was doing so much cooking the next day.  After I cooked them in the oven for the suggested time, I put them under the broiler for a few minutes on each side.  So Dang Gone Good!  Oh yeah...don't forget to remove the membrane on the bony side and cut off any excess fat before boiling.

Really a good recipe.  I could not stand to waste all the flavor in the water, so after removing the ribs, I added the sauce ingredients to the "broth" and took the time to boil it down.  Once it had reduced by half or more, I strained the yummy goodness and proceeded with the recipe.  The result was outlandishly good BBQ sauce!

This recipe was a hit with the family and co-workers.  I look at a recipe as a guideline and always add my own flare to make it mine, especially if I try it and don't care for the taste (I loved these as is btw).  You can make the sauce as sweet or spicy as you want.  The best part is you can cut the ribs with a fork!

I have made spare ribs for years, every time trying to find the best one that I made the first time but lost the recipe.  I finally found a recipe that I will make all the time.  The recipe is calling for 8 pounds, I had only one pound but divided the sauce in 4.  Plenty of sauce, they were just amazing.  

Thank you

These ribs are easy to prepare and delicious! They stand up to the highly touted, laborious, all-day, jump through hoops recipes I've been given over the years. The sauce is really the key, it's fabulous.

I have added an extra garlic or two and instead of 3 cups of ketchup i changed it to 2 and added an extra cup of bbq sauce and a little less brown sugar. Either by this recipe or my way my husband can't get enough!

Make this recipe regularly!  I like to add more hot sauce and some jerk mix seasoning, hubby likes heat, I like sweet.  I always mince up a whole onion in sauce too.  As Sylvia says...all are to taste, I never make it exactly the same way twice.  Soo yummy

I followed the recipe but i used spared ribs instead. I also added chopped onions and bell pepper in my water to boil the ribs. I think i will add more seasoning to ribs to give them more flavor. I really like how the turned out.

Best BBQ sauce I have ever had. I used it with pulled pork. We had an open house/birthday party. I doubled the recipe and in three days we finished off the second batch. My four kids ate pulled pork for breakfast and lunch two days after the party. I follow it exactly.

Sauce is great! I used 4 lbs. of thick country pork ribs and halved the sauce. I baked them covered in foil for almost 2 hours at 350 degrees. Then poured the sauce over them and baked 45 more minutes covered and 30 minutes uncovered. Meat was fall of the bone tender. Served with a baked sweet potato and brown rice.

I have to say I'm use to baking my ribs and using dry rub, and never boiling, but these were very tasty and fell off the bone nicely.  I did adjust the recipe for 6lbs of ribs and also cut back on the ketchup and used a little extra garlic but other than that kept the same.  I still feel that boiling takes a lot of the fat out of the ribs but these still did the trick and great for those that want to cut back on the fat intake.

Just loved this recipe.  Have tried many barbeque rib recipes over the years, but I think this one was the best yet.  My husband and I just loved the results.  Would highly recommend this recipe to anyone.  I would also use this recipe with other things other than ribs - chicken breasts, chicken wings, etc.

Really delicious, got rave reviews from my adult sons.  I used about two cups of ketchup, added extra bbq sauce and "turned up the heat" a little with crushed red pepper flakes to suit our taste.  Overall, a great recipe, making again today per the boys request!

This was fantastic and so so simple.  I cut the recipe in half (there were just two of us) and we still had left overs for days.  I would also cut the sauce back a little bit next time, but overall, great recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

These ribs were delicious!  I'm gluten free so couldn't use the steak sauce but it still was awesome!  I halved the recipe and used a bit less catsup and more BBQ sauce; also added a little more brown sugar as we like a sweeter sauce and I had used a mesquite BBQ sauce...incredible!

I looked at a lot of recipes for oven baked ribs & decided to go with this one based on the reviews. Wow!!! I was NOT disappointed! If you like tender, saucy ribs that are relatively easy & quick to make, look no further! These are delicious!!!

Best homemade sauce so far. I followed the recipe to the letter and I wouldn't change a thing. I used country style ribs and can't wait to try the sauce on chicken.

Amazing. I was apprehensive of all the ketchup but followed the recipe to a t and was very happily surprised by the outcome. This has been my favorite recipe for ribs yet and I'm intending on bbqing some chicken wings with this sauce recipe I loved it so much.

My whole family absolutely loves this recipe.  It's almost a weekly standard at this point.  I thought 3 cups of ketchup was too much and lowered it to 2 cups.  I tried a few different BBQ sauces before I fell onto on that we all thought was best (bull's-Eye Old West Hickory). Great recipe!  Thanks!

By far THE best ribs I've ever made, bar none.  Simple, fall-off-the-bone tender and extremely flavorful.  I had doubled the sauce, as another reviewer suggested, but I honestly didn't need extra at all.  Just follow the recipe and you will have perfection!  Thanks Sylvia!!

Awesome way to cook ribs without a grill!  My whole family enjoyed them and the sauce is amazing (messy, especially for my 3 year old, but so worth it).  I only had a 3 pound rack, so cut the recipe for sauce to 1/3.  Otherwise I didn't change a THING!  I love giving 5 stars to the ORIGINAL recipe and not a 5 with tons of changes :)

I made this recipe for my first time ever making Pork Spare Ribs and it was an absolute hit with my family! I used powdered garlic instead of fresh and doubled the Worcestshire Sauce in replacement for steak sauce and it came out fine! Makes for the most succulent, tender, juicy, tangy meat ever!

Just made these ribs for dinner and my family loved them.  I followed recipe to the letter except I didn't have any brown sugar on hand with tomorrow being Christmas and all.  I substituted 1 cup of regular sugar and 3 tablespoons of molasses.  Amazing, this will be a regular from now on. Thank you for sharing and Merry Christmas.

My family loved it. I modified the recipe a little (hence why I deducted a star) to make pulled pork sandwiches.
I mixed 1 cup ketchup, 1.5 cups BBQ sauce (used a local brand Texas Texas BBQ and grilling sauce). I didn't add any sugar as I usually find this too sweet, used about 1.5 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 tablespoon chili garlic sauce, 2 tablespoons of minced garlic. I didn't have steak sauce but used 1 tablespoon of cider vinegar. I mixed all of these ingredients to make the sauce.   I boiled the ribs and then placed them in a slow cooker with diced onions at the bottom and alternating layers of ribs and sauce. I cooked it on low for 7 hours. Turned out great. Could use mor chili sauce for those that like a little kick.  Now I am just looking for a BBQ sauce recipe that I can make at home rather than buying from the store (although this sauce was fantastic)

Very, very, very good.  I agree that you pretty much can't go wrong with the sauce.  However, I followed the recipe to a "T" and it turned out as expected.  Delicious!  This one's a keeper.

Yummmmmy! I've never been a huge rib fan- but when we got 10lbs of rib meat I thought I'd give it a try. This recipe worked so well. I'd tried ribs once before, but they were too done- they fell apart. These stayed together, but were still very tender and so good! Enjoy!

Delicious! Guests said it's better than The Outback's ribs!! I halved the recipe with same amount of ribs and still had plenty leftover. Made for a freezer meal group. I did initial boil for 1 hr and then cut up spareribs, placed in Ziploc, poured in sauce and froze. Freezing didn't change the flavor at all and letting them thaw gave them some time to marinate in it.

This was a very good recipe for my family.  It was pretty easy to make.  It tasted delicious.  I will definetly make again.  Was expecting it to be a lil spicy because of the hot sauce.  I don't like hot and spicy.  But, it wasn't because I only put a couple of dashes.  It was perfect.

Wow! I have never tried to cook ribs before. I had bought country style pork ribs on sale & wanted to try a recipe that was not too time consuming. I had two hours & all the ingredients. My family absolutely loved these! I served with fresh corn on the cob & steamed Green Beans. Going into the rotation for whenever I find these on sale again.

I liked these so much better than cooking them in the slow cooker. I like my ribs tender but a slight crust on the sauce (if that even makes sense). Next time I make these I will put them on the grill and see if that does the trick! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a pretty good sauce.  I added a tad amount of water because I had them in my crock pot all day and did not want them to stick.  I also used this recipe for some chicken pieces I had and it turned out great too.  Definitely a keeper.

These were really good!  I used country style ribs instead of babyback.  The cooking method is spot on! 5 stars on the cook method - boiling them first helped remove a lot of the grease from the ribs.  After cooking they were perfectly cooked - very tender and juicy.  The sauce was good too - sweet and tangy.  It does make a TON of sauce.  Way more than we needed so I poured some on the ribs to cook and froze the rest. I don't know if it will be ok after freezing, but, thought I would give it a shot.  I'll update after defrosting.

This was a pretty good sauce as is but next time I will decrease the amount of ketchup to 2 cups and decrease the amount of brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  I will also add some red pepper flakes to make it more spicy.  But my husband and 2 year old loved the ribs.

Try these and you will never have to go to an expensive resturant to get your favorite ribs again!  As my hubby said "You found a winner here."  Easy recipe and I love the way I could design it to our specific taste ie: less sugar, more garlic, etc.  We will have these several times this summer I am sure.

These were totally awesome!!  1st time making ribs, and they were easy.  The only thing I did differently, is I added more brown sugar to the sauce mix, b/c my husband and I like our sauce more on the sweet side.  Definitely will make this again!! Thanks so much!!!

These are the BEST of the BEST!  I have never been quite satisfied with ribs until now...I boiled 3 pounds of boneless country-style  pork ribs with 2 Tbsp garlic salt, 1 Tbsp Lawry's seasoning, and 1 tsp ground pepper for 1 and 1/2 hours at a low simmer.  Then I baked them in about 1/3 the sauce for another hour or so and left them covered the entire time.  Tender, flavored perfectly, delicious!

This is the second time I've made them - and will always use this as my recipe!! T

WOW DELICIOUS!  I added 3/4 cup of honey, and only about half of the ketchup.  I also added 3 bay leaves, sliced onion, and chopped garlic, to my rib water while boiling.  I actually lost 2 of the bones off the ends trying to get them out of the pot, they were so tender!  I was going to serve these with baked sweet potatos, but my kids like brown sugar on those, and there is plenty of sweetness in the rib sauce, so went with baked potato, with sour cream, and steamed broccoli with cheese sauce. In my opinion, this turned out like resaurant quality ribs.  Truely delicious!  THANK YOU SYLVIA, for giving me a place to start or my own sauce.  As a fan of "sweet baby rays" sauce for a LONG time, I have to say...sorry ray..I can handle that sauce myself now. ;)

Wow. No need for a knife here, this turned out so tender... And the recipe was so easy! Next time I'll reduce the amount of sugar just a hair. I also only added two cups of ketchup. I'm pretty picky about meat, but I would give this six stars if I could.

I have made this recipe over a dozen times and haven't changed a thing! They are always a hit, and I have been told by people who "slow cook" their ribs for hours and hours that they like these better! I had never made ribs before, and I felt like a pro when I made these, they are foolproof!

Snaps for Sylvia! This sauce is OMG TDF. I followed the recipe for the sauce not the whole cooking method. I did boil the ribs and then put them on the grill at about 350 degrees for maybe 30 min. Then I began to baste them with the sauce for about 20-30 min. turning them over and adding more sauce. The ribs were melt in your mouth good and the sauce was even better!!!

I need to update my review of this recipe.  I made this a couple years ago and absolutely loved it.  When I boil my ribs I add spices and an onion in the water to add flavor in the meat.  Mainly fresh garlic, onion powder, salt and pepper, maybe a little liquid smoke.  Season the water really well.  Or most of the time what I use in place of the water is dr pepper.  It really helps tenderize your meat.  The one thing about this recipe, that makes it 5 stars is the sauce! I tell you what, this sauce is Phenomenal!  Very tangy and delicious!  It makes a big batch of sauce.  Almost double what I need for our ribs.  Which is great, because I save the extra for next time!  Great recipe Sylvia!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I didn't have steak sauce so I had to go without it. My husband and mine's only complaint, which did not diminish the taste of these ribs, was that the sauce was kind of ketchup-y. But it might have had something to do with the steak sauce. Nonetheless, I am now able to brag that I know how to make ribs and make them really good!! Thanks for this recipe.

This is a great rib recipe, however next time I will use less sugar (a bit too sweet) and will cut sauce by a third (made way too much!). Also, 2 lbs just isn't enough for 4 people-of course, maybe we're just rib piggies! Actually used 4 lbs and it was just right.

YUM-O! I used the 'dry rub for ribs by densie smith (on this site)' and put the ribs into the crock pot all day and then I followed this recipe.  YUM-O!  What a great recipe!!!!!!  BTW, I only had 1 cup of ketchup, so I 1/3'd the recipe for sauce.  Thanks, Sylvia!

I'd give this 6 stars if I could. makes a ton of sauce. I added beer to the boiling water (as someone suggested), used equal parts BBQ sauce and ketchup, and added a little curry powder. I also BBQ'd the ribs after I boiled them (instead of the oven), at about 400 for 25 min or so.

I've been trying to find an easy way to make wonderful ribs for years - this recipe does it! I made these the other day for my daughters (and friends) and they couldn't get enough of them. My biggest rib "connisuer" (she's 14 years old)
 said not to change a thing -  that these were perfect.

I just made this tonight for supper, and I'm glad I did.  These were just great.  My husband who isn't a real big ribs fan loved these. I did change the recipe just a bit though.  I decreased the amount of ketchup by about 3/4 of a cup because I was afraid the sauce would end up tasting to much like just ketchup, and I increase the garlic to 4 cloves because we love garlic.  The meat was extremely tender and juicy.  I will be making these again, even my husband asked  me to make them again while we were still having dinner. I do agree with one of the othere reviewers who said that the recipe could be halfed and still there would be enough sauce.  Thanks Sylvia  Update 2009 I am constantly making these ribs with different variations.  I have found that we like them best if we finish them on the bbq letting the sauce caramelize instead of finishing them in the oven uncovered (when we do it this way we leave the ribs intack and slice them after taking them off the bbq)

This was very good! But it made a TON more sauce than necessary. Like 4 times as much as I needed for four very meaty country-style ribs. So I will use some of the leftovers for chicken breasts this week and then freeze the rest for next time. I followed the recipe exactly and it was very tasty. I made the ribs with the Macaroni and Cheese Salad from this site and my husband said it was the best meal I had made for him in eight years of marriage!

These spareribs are absolutely delicious!
I have been using a recipe very similar to this one for years, although this one leaves more room for the imagination.  It's so good and the combination of boiling the ribs and then baking them in the oven ensures tender, fall of the bone ribs every time.  I would recommend skimming off the fat that bubbles and rises to the surface during the simmering stage.  This sauce is also perfect for stirring into a can of beans for baking in the oven alongside the ribs.  Great recipe!  Thanks Sylvia!

A very good recipe. I cooked country style and whole back ribs in the oven with a little water for an hour and then transferred them to my crockpot and added sauce. I cooked on low for 6 hours and they were very tender. I will make these again.

These were excellent. I didn't use 1 cup of brown sugar only a couple of teaspoons but otherwise I kept the recipe pretty much the same except I cut it in half because there is only 2 of us. Absolutely delicious can't wait to make them again!

So, first things first: this recipe is BOMB!!!  This was the first time I made something and the seasoning was perfect!  I did make some mistakes though; I bought and seasoned my meat before looking up a recipe and so I skipped the boiling part.  I also forgot to add garlic to my sauce.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  I think it’s going to be even better next time when I boil my meat first.  This is a keeper!  My husband finished his whole plate, which he rarely does (because I typically suck at seasoning).

I had never boiled ribs then baked them and my husband was very unsure of me doing it.  To him meat is the most important part of the meal. They turned out great! So if your worried too, just give it a try.  Sauce was perfect.   I baked them longer and a lower temperature- 275, but honestly they were so tender after the boil I dont think it mattered.  This is the recipe I'll use for future ribs for sure!

What a mistake this would have been if I had not used “the sauce” in this recipe. This got raves from my entire family, simply amazing. And this is the quickest easiest way to cook ribs that fall off the bone.

So easy and a new family favorite. We had cooked 4 lbs country style ribs on the Traeger at 350 until 120 degrees, then coated with the BBQ sauce and baked in the oven for approx 20 mins at 350, then 5 min broil. Didn't have steak sauce but used the soy as many suggested; they were delicious. Will definitely make again!

Whooo-hoo! Mighty tasty flavor! I used boneless pork shoulder ribs which came out super tender and easily breaks apart into tasty morsels for nibbling. I jimmied the sauce ingredients as suggested; substituting Mr Yoshida’s sweet and savory sauce for steak sauce.

OMG! This basic recipe turned out fantastic! I had to adjust sauce as I had 2.5 lbs of ribs, also added a few extra ingredients! I like it more tangy hot, so added crush red pepper flakes and a few other things! Ribs were falling off the bone just the way like them!

I really liked this recipe.  I didn't have the Steak sauce so I also put in a bit of soy sauce instead.  I also used more BBQ sauce than ketchup because that was all I had.  It was really delicious.

I made these as follows EXCEPT...I then stuck them on the gas grill for a bit to really sticky them up. I like a bit of over cooking to my meats. Gives them a bit more personality. Not for everyone. You can reduce cooking time a bit in the oven if you choose to do this.

This recipe is really good. I gave it 4 because it is just a bit sweet for us. {I think my BBQ sauce is a little sweet)  I boiled the ribs in stock and made the sauce while they cooked. I used a deep skillet with a metal handle and lid. I drained the juices, poured the sauce over them and baked in the same pan...was able to use only 2 pans. I reduced the sauce for the 2 of us and there were no leftovers. DH liked them and he usually smokes and grills ribs. I will reduce the brown sugar next time.  THERE WILL BE A NEXT TIME. DELISH AND TENDER!

Man, these are some tasty ribs! I consider myself a passionate foodie, but had never went total stoner on bbq sauce until you led the way..! I can see how the recipe is a feeling, not an ingredient list.. and boiling the ribs worked perfectly! Growing up, my mom would just bake short ribs and they always turned out way too greasy for my liking.. Rock on, Sylvia!

Fantastic! I'm not the barbecue or rib connoisseur that my 91 year old mother is, but she was craving ribs and couldn't remember how she cooked them. Well, bless you Sylvia! She swears these were the best she ever had. She was concerned because it wasn't her sauce, then concerned the raw ribs didn't look right. (Turns out she always bought baby back ribs and these were spare ribs, thank you Wikipedia!) But she was absolutely delighted with the results and can't wait until we have family visit and can whip out a batch for them!

I think this is my first review!  It was so good--I only left out the steak sauce because I didn't have any.  I have tried a dozen rib recipes and this is the ONE.  Thick sauce with tons of flavor, fall off the bone meat, less time in the oven and incredible texture.  KEEPER!

YUM! Adjusted a little bit  and rather than pour the sauce over the ribs, I dredged each rib and discarded the rest of the sauce, we didn't need it.

Thanks to Sylvia, I finally I made perfect pork spare ribs. I've always been told I'm a fantastic cook but trying to make really moist, fall off the bone tender spare ribs has made me feel otherwise.  I haven't tried to make them too often in my 72 years but my husbands really enjoys good pork ribs so I've tried from time to time with different recipes. I've come up with great flavor but  the ribs were always less than perfectly melt in your mouth tender. Not this time. THIS RECIPE IS FANTASTIC!!! 

Since she made a note about soy sauce and onions I added a large chopped onion and 3 cloves of chopped garlic to the water the ribs boiled in for an extra layer of flavor.  I also added 1/2 cup of soy sauce to the sauce.  I had everything on hand but steak sauce. They were out of this world anyway.  I'm positive exactly as written this is one of the best rib recipe around so do that first. Then, as Sylvia says, play around with ingredients to suit your taste. 

This will be my only go to recipe to use again but I'm also going to try making my favorite ribs... Chinese Spare Ribs. I'll use her method but  will substitute ingredients for Chinese ribs.

I made these ribs for a pot luck and it was a great hit! I followed the receipt except I didn’t add hot pepper sauce. The sauce was delicious but I think next time I will use 2 cup of ketchup and 2 cup of BBQ sauce (instead of 3:1) to make it less sweet but stronger smoky flavor. The amount of sauce in the receipt was perfect for 8 lbs of ribs (3 tacks) and was perfect for my potluck dinner for 10 people.

I made just a 2-lb. rack of pork ribs. The boiled meat seemed so firm when I removed it that I was afraid I had ruined the meat! But I pressed on, and lo and behold, they came out of the oven tender and tasty and the sauce recipe is delicious. This dish was a big hit, and I'll definitely make it again.

Wow! I didn’t change anything and this sauce was perfect as is! I did have a lot leftover so I filled a big mason jar and put it in the fridge for bbq chicken next week. Thank you Sylvia!

I made these in the slow cooker. I substituted homemade spaghetti sauce for brown sugar. They turned out fantastic.

I did add liquid smoke to the boiling rib water. Approximately two tablespoons. These turned out to be the best ribs I have ever made and the ten friends  having dinner want the recipe as well. We have two more racks of ribs waiting in the wings for Memorial day!

This recipe is too ketchupy. I added vinegar and way more hot sauce than asked for. It was delicious but still a little too ketchupy.

Excellent. Great sweet, but not too sweet, taste thus “to taste” as per the recipe. Lol. The sticky texture was the best. At first bite I tasted the catsup but then the rest of the flavors hit. It’s just as most all the reviews have described. Definite hit and will make many times over.

Wow!  This is an amazing recipe!  I made two enhancements.  First, I added an onion and 4 garlic cloves to the first boil.  Second, after the ribs were done baking, I broiled them on High for six minutes and got an amazing caramelized crust.  We couldn’t stop eating these delicious ribs and we will make them again and again!  Thanks, Sylvia!!

I followed the recipe for the sauce exactly as written...just add extra minced garlic...we love garlic!  It was wonderful, so wonderful I made extra and jarred it in a mason jar for chicken, chops or even as a dipping sauce. I boiled the ribs but added Jack Daniels Tennessee Honey Whiskey and some garlic salt to the water. These ribs came out amazingly delicious!!  Definitely a keeper and will be making for many years to come!!  Thanks for this recipe!!

Wow!  This was so quick and easy to make (for ribs), and yet probably one of the tastiest rib recipes ever!  My family devoured them in no time!  The only thing I would do differently next time is make twice as much to have some leftovers!

I followed the good advice of another reviewer and added one onion, quartered, 4 fresh cloves of garlic, mashed and peppercorns to the water I boiled the ribs in.  Husband loves this recipe.

I'm giving five stars because it's really easy and tastes pretty good. The flavor is pretty sweet and I'll probably tinker with that but I do like the stickiness of the sauce and don't want to lose that.

This is the first time I have made ribs and they turned out so good! The family loved them and my critics said yes this recipe is a keeper. The only thing i did different was add a can of beer and onions to the water with the ribs. Definitely will make these again!! Thanks for the recipe!

These were very good. I didn't really measure but came out well. And I poured the sauce over the partially cooked ribs. Left in the fridge for a day. Then baked to finish.  Family really liked them

I thought this recipe was good, but just too sweet for my preference.  For the bbq sauce I used half Sweet Baby Ray's and half Stubs (much smokier).  I can't imagine how sweet it would have been if I hadn't mixed the two!

My husband did enjoy these very much, so I guess it's just a matter of personal taste.

These are really really good! I was concerned about the ribs not having enough flavor so I boiled them with salt, oregano, rosemary, pepper, and parsley that I got from another recipe but I was really wrong. The BBQ sauce had so much flavor u didn't need to season the boil. The BBQ sauce itself was a little salty and sweet. I would probably tone down some of the ketchup with unsalted tomato sauce.

I made this recipe in the crock pot and it was  amazing. I turned the ribs over every few hours to make sure they are coated with this finger licking sauce.  The meat fell off the bone after 6 hours on low.  Can't wait to make this again.

Absolutely tasty! I make it according to the recipe it was perfect. In fact my family wanted me to make it again ! I use country ribs and sweet baby rays bar-b-que sauce for the mixture. I ran out of  ketchup so I use a half a cup of BBB sauce to replace what I didn't have in ketchup. I love this recipe it's truly a keeper.

I made this with boneless country ribs. The meat was very tender and the sauce was good but something was missing. Maybe I should have used bone-in ribs? It's definitely a good base recipe so I'll tweak it to my own liking next time.

I made them as directed, using St. Louis style ribs. I added a little liquid smoke. Sticky sweet sauce was delicious, may add a little heat next time.

Last time I was at my butcher shop,  I noticed an unusual item in the meat case. Veal ribs ! I bought some and was planning to use the same bbq rib recipe from AR, I've been using for years, "barbecued beef ribs for 2". But,  I noticed  the good rating of this recipe and decided to give it a try. I am glad I did.
I kept the sauce the same. but went ahead and flavored the boiling water with 1 quartered onion, 2 crushed garlic  cloves , 2 bay leaves, some pepper corns and 2 teaspoon salt.
The ribs were tender and  finger licking good. And FYI, You will have at least 1/3 of the sauce leftover.

THIS IS A WINNER!  I've used this recipe for more than a couple of years now. You can follow it exactly (YUM) or add whatever spices you like and it is really really good. I've recently started "country style" boneless pork ribs when I make these so I can shred the leftover meat easily for "pulled" style pork.

I made this and it was awesome!  I took others advice and the only thing I changed was I omitted the steak sauce because I'm not a fan of it and I use the soy sauce.  It came out awesome!!! This is my new bbq sauce for anything.  Thumbs up to the chef who came up with this!!!!

I hadn't prepared spare ribs for a long time.  They were on sale recently, so I bought a slab to prepare something different.  I halved the sauce recipe (which was more than ample) and only made two changes.  I don't use steak sauce (always thought it was a great way to ruin steak) so per a previous reviewer added 1 Tbsp soy sauce.  I can't eat spicy hot, so left that out.  This has to be one of the best recipes for ribs I have ever tried in my 80 years.  The leftovers (I live alone) are super!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  I will make this often.

I actually use your sauce for game day appetizers. the bbq cocktail wienies. it's a hit everyone loves it, specially in a slow cooker. only bad thing is the little dogs don't save very good. since it's usually gone by the time I go and get some. I hide a bowl for my self in the refrigerator... the little dogs got soggy. other then that love your sauce! thank  you... I'm also going to add some grape jelly this time too.

These ribs were so delicious that my mom made the same dish 2 days later but, she used boneless chicken thighs. Again it was a big success! She cut down on the cooking time, just cooked until the chicken was tender. After we gobbled up the ribs there was still some sauce left, I refrigerated it and used it the next day on my hamburger, Yum.

Great recipe! My family loves these ribs. I have made them several times and only made a couple small changes.
For one rack of ribs, I cut the recipe in half, but still use 2 cloves of garlic. I only use about 1 cup of ketchup and make up for that by adding more BBQ sauce. It's more tangy and less ketchupy tasting. I didn't have hot pepper sauce on hand, so I added some Sweet and Spicy BBQ sauce (safeway brand). The ribs always turn out amazing!

I made this recipe with pork bone in spareribs. My husband does not like ribs very much, and he said these are some of the best ribs he has ever had! The sauce is incredible! I have made these again and again and will keep making them. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Delicious! I cut the recipe in half, used honey instead of brown sugar, 3 cloves of garlic, no steak sauce. I love how versatile this recipe can be. Thanks! Can't wait to use this sauce again with other meats.

Enjoyed.  Other than time the entire process was easy to accomplish good tasting ribs.  One note, I cut the slabs of ribs in half before boiling to help them fit in the pot.

I put this in crock with salt & pepper for about 5-6 hours on low, then I baked it, but for less time. I added liquid smoke & a little chipotle pepper. IT was great.

Made it as the recipe called for except for the steak sauce.  I substituted Lite Soy Sauce.  The ribs melted in your mouth and the family loved the BBQ sauce.  Recipe made more than enough sauce and I used the left overs for BBQ chicken two nights later.  De-Lish!

OMG these were Fabulous!!  I don't usually posts reviews, but this recipe just too good not too.
I think that it is great as is, but here were my spins....didn't have enough ketchup, so I used half chili sauce & half ketchup....it was a good swap out! I boiled the ribs in salted water with half a can of beer and 2 crushed garlic cloves added to the water. Used crushed red in the sauce...didn't have tabasco worked fine....the sauce is the best one out there....my guys are still gushing...used a half recipe and it was plenty for 2 racks (6 lbs total) of St. Louis cut ribs. Make sure to cut them up before putting in the oven, like the recipe says....better sauce coverage and it thickens better.  A Keeper,,,,THANKS!!!!!!!

I added onion powder and a little soy sauce. This is without a doubt THE BEST rib sauce I have ever tasted!! I had a favorite and made it for many years but was out of two of the ingredients so I decided to look for another and lo and behold Sylvias popped up. I made it less than a week ago and already need another fix!! Will never use another recipe for ribs!! M-m-m-m-m-m!!!!

The meat wasn't as tender as I hoped but the flavor of the sauce was amazing and I will definitely use again. I will just alter the cooking method of the meat.

Pretty good ribs! I've never boiled ribs in water, so I was nervous. I added garlic and onion powder, and smoked paprika to the water so the ribs wouldn't be drained of flavor. I also used 3 cups of BBQ sauce to one cup of ketchup in the sauce. After the first 30 minutes of baking, I pulled the ribs out and placed them on a large pan for the last 30 minutes so they wouldn't be so saucy!

This recipe was excellent, I added some Frank's red hot chili sauce! I wish recipes were made for 2 people, it's a lot easier to increase then decrease. I'm making a full batch of sauce  and putting in frig, as I will definitely use this on other meats as well!

I have never felt compelled to write a review before now. This recipe is amazing!!!!  We have always tried making ribs in the oven and they always turn out so so. This sauce was great and I never knew to boil the ribs first. I did however do it in the crockpot as one other reviewer said she did because I needed to go out but if I waited until I hit back we wouldn't have eaten until real late!  The sauce had a great flavor better than any bbq sauce I've had. Changes I made - only 2 cups of ketchup. I also put some salt, pepper, garlic powder, and 2 garlic cloves in the water with the ribs. I also used what chicken stock I had left over in the fridge it was probably

Omg this was amazing! I used all ingredients listed for the sauce. But as far as measurements I tweaked everything to my taste. I added lime juice along with lemon juice. Also I used hot chilli sauce instead of hot pepper sauce because that's what I had. I like spicy food so I also added hot sauce. The sauce on my ribs were sticky, sweet, and spicy. I had pork spare ribs and cooked exactly as directed by the recipe. I added diced onion to the boiling water. Also after boiling I seasoned the ribs before adding sauce and baking them. I will never use another sauce ever again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely delicious. However, I used more BBQ sauce and only 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup packed brown sugar and eliminated the lemon juice. We'll definitely be making this again for BBQ ribs indoors for the winter. Looking forward to grilling them also.
Update 6-24-19: I've made these ribs again several times using Sylvia's sauce as written. It's better than any store bought sauce we've ever tried for pork or chicken. I now make a double batch to have some on hand in the fridge for the nights we do a quick  boneless center cut pork chop or chicken on the Griddler.

I am probably as afraid of the kitchen as the next 20-something year old bachelor. I was nervous about trying something so delicate to make as ribs, but let me tell you, these things were about the greatest thing I've ever tasted. This recipe will be used time and time again!!

Made for a party and the guests loved it.  Followed advice from reviews above and boiled in apple cider beer, water and garlic.  Excellent and will definitely make again.

Delicious!  I've made these plenty of times and everyone always loves them. I made them last night with baby back ribs. I added onion, celery and carrots while boiling my meat. I also baked just a bit longer. Perfect!

OMG.  I never heard of boiling ribs before.  I usually just throw them in the crock pot.  But these....take a little more forethought and time, but worth it.  The sauce is amazing.  Finishing them in the oven makes them taste like classic restaurant ribs, not just meat in a crockpot with sauce.

The sauce was way too sweet for my taste.  I used Sweet Baby Rays basic barbecue sauce as my base.  Maybe that was part of the problem?  Second the sauce was actually runny for me.  The taste was just ok, and I did save the left over sauce for a future base that I intend to doctor to my liking.

Delicious! We like a bit more sweet and hot, so I added some honey and a little more hot pepper sauce. This bbq recipe lends itself to add or subtract according to taste. I skipped the boiling, baked foil covered ribs in oven for an hour, then transferred for smoking on a slow charcoal grill for 20 minutes.

I made this with just a slab of ribs and I had to cute to sauce recipe, I only added 1 cup of ketchup and a bit of soy sauce instead of the hot pepper sauce it listed. I also added some honey bedsides the brown sugar. Everyone loved it and ate it all!! Will definitely be making this again as per their request!

OMGosh, these were amazing! I've tried ribs in an Instant Pot, a slow cooker, and on the grill. This recipe by far surpasses all those results. Super tender, fall off the bone, and the sauce had just the right tang and spice to it. And the oven gave them that ooey-gooey restaurant rib effect. Seriously, you could probably use mostly store bought sauce and add brown sugar, Worcestershire, etc. to taste. My fave is Sweet Baby Rays Honey, which I did add. But the recipe stands on it's own and was delicious.

Thanks Sylvia for sharing this incredible recipe. Simply put, by far the best I have ever tasted. I only used 6 lbs. of baby back ribs and did not add garlic, my preference. Prepped the ribs, cut each slab into 3 pieces and poured the sauce over them and refrigerated for the next day. I then chose to cook them in my slow cooker on low for 7 hours. So delicious and the meat fell off the bones.

These ribs were fabulous!  I used one bottle of sweet bay rays' BBQ sauce, 1 cup of ketchup, 1/2 cup brown sugar, couple splashed of hot sauce, lemon juice, and garlic!  Boiled them first for almost one hour, wrapped the rack of ribs in foil, fridge, then grilled on low for a total of one hour, 1/2 hour on each side while in the foil!!!  Perfection!!

I used only 2 cups of ketchup, half of the sugar and the juice of a whole lemon. I accompanied the ribs with the cuban dish "moros y cristianos" (rice and black beans) and an avocado, watermelon and spinach salad that I found here in allrecipes.com Great lunch!

Delicious recipe. I like that once you get the basic ingredients you can customize it every time for a guaranteed new flavor. I've made this over and over again.

Followed the recipe exactly as written. Was an excellent sauce! Has a sweet/tangy flavor. I used bone-in country ribs and had to throw in a half boneless chicken breast for my wife (does not like ribs). She thought the sauce was very good and put some on her brown rice. Would definitely make again.

As is, the recipe is too sweet for my taste. All I did to fix this was add more BBQ sauce and steak sauce. After marinating all day I put the ribs in a heavy foil pouch and left them on the grill at lowest heat for an hour (30 min one side, 30 min on the other side). I opened the foil and the result was fall off the bone flavorful meat! Delicious!!!!!

I've tried many recipes for spareribs, but this takes all the winning ribbons... Easy and delicious. I cooked the ribs and put them into a zip lock bag to refrigerate overnight... Mixed the sauce and refrigerated it overnight (uncooked) as well. The next day, I cooked the sauce and coated the chilled ribs with the sauce and then grilled the ribs.... Yummy-yummy!

I finally found my sauce for ribs!  I love that you can season to your liking.  I didn't use lemon juice, only because I did not have any on hand.  But I will definitely try it next time.

Phenomenal. Made exactly as written except for broiling the last 10 minutes or so to get it a bit more charred as if it had been grilled. Thank you so much for sharing this one!

This was my first time making ribs, and this recipe made it so easy!  The barbecue sauce was tasty & sweet (the way I like it) sticky, so it really stuck to the ribs.  The meat was tender and fell off the bone.  I'll definitely be making this one again

I am an avid bbq smoker guy. There are times due to weather and time factors I am not able to cook ribs in this manner. This recipe ROCKS and makes ribs in a different but completely delicious fashion. The only addition I make is to mist the ribs with a small cosmetic type spray bottle using liquid smoke after cooking to give the ribs the "outdoor" essence.

If you are looking for a sticky sauce this is great. I made my ribs with a dry rub and placed in the pressure cooker. cooked till tender.
removed and placed on cookie sheet brushed with sauce and placed under broiler for a few minutes.  I rated recipe based on the sauce. I usually make mine from scratch. This is excellent for hands on ingredients. The acidity is high which you can cut with sugar or honey according to your taste buds. This is a saver.  Thank you

Very Good!  (made 1/2 ribs, sauce recipe) I boiled the ribs, until tender, then refrigerated (in the pan), so I could serve them the next day.  Baked in the sauce, adding a bit of the (jelled) pan juices (bake a little longer).  While the ribs baked, I cooked potatoes and carrots in the pan juices (add water to cover, season to taste) from the ribs, and baked a pan of brownies. Add a salad, fresh bread. Good stuff!!

Love the sauce!  Boiling the rib was just the way I do my pork feet (except I use a different sauce for the pork feet). "Use more or less of anything you like."  That is what I did I added more of everything to my taste. My family loved it, it was gone in one meal.  The only thing I did not add because I have children who do not like spicy is hot pepper sauce.  I made a hot pepper sauce on the side for other family members.

The sauce was a hit and the cooking process easy.  I did mess with the ingredients based on what we had at home.  I was almost out of ketchup so just used what I had left - maybe 1/2 a cup?  Then added the entire bottle of sweet & spicy BBQ sauce.  Didn't have steak sauce or garlic.

I always love recipes that you don't have to change anything- and this is one of them!  This was great, so easy, and even my 23 month old loved it- which means I'll make it again and again...  I only used about 1/2 the sauce so I'll be able to maybe make some bbq chicken later this week.  Thanks!

WONDERFUL!! I don't think I made the same amount of ribs since I had tons of leftover sauce....aww darn! But the ribs were extremely tender and the sauce was amazing. It really stuck to the meat, unlike BBQ sauce. I poured to leftover sauce into an empty ketchup bottle to use later. ((I actually used the sauce to make chicken thighs. Baked them with sauce on one side then flipped and added more suace until done!!)) YUMMY! This is a definite sauce that will be used constantly!! THANKS!!!!

Fantastic!  I cooked 3X the amount and cooked at 325 for 2 hours after boiling for 45 minutes.  I added liquid smoke 1 TBLS. instead of A-1 brushed right onto the ribs.  These were eaten up...we kept a box of wipies on the table to keep our fingers clean!

Yummy! I've never made ribs before, but saw them on sale and gave it a try. The work wasn't all that bad. Besides adding a touch of liquid smoke, followed the recipe exactly and got great results! Will make again when they go on sale.

I had my doubts; I've boiled up ribs before and grilled them and they're tough, but basically went with this recipe because I had all the ingredients.  I did halve the sauce, and it was plenty for ribs (for family of 2 adults/2young kids).  I think I reduced par-boil time to 40 minutes, and since I didn't have steak sauce, I subbed 1/8 tsp of liquid smoke, and a couple tbl of red-wine vinegar.  I also eliminated the hot sauce since my kids haven't acquired the taste for heat.  These were just fabulous....tender, awesome bbq sauce - thick, sweet, and stick-to-your-fingers!  Ribs were tender and easily came off the bone.  HUGE thumbs up!!!!

These turned out very tender, but I really think that they would of been just as tasty using bottled sauce.

Taste-wise, my family rated this tops, thus the 5 stars. Issues with this recipe are in terms of proportions. First, 2 pounds of ribs barely fed 3 people and these are not big eaters. Second, half the sauce more than adequately covered this amount of ribs, so if you don't want a lot of leftover barbecue sauce don't make the entire batch. Make sure to line your roasting pan with foil. The dishwasher will thank you. Thanks for the recipe.

these are so good. i made a few changes because i didn't have everything it called for. I did not have steak sauce so i used soy sauce. i also did not have brown sugar so i used splenda and i added a little syrup. these were so good. the whole family loved them. This is a must try and they are so easy.

Sylvia knows ribs!  I had never made them before but decided this recipe looked like something I could handle.  They were delicious--my niece told me I should open a restaurant with them.  I didn't change a thing.  This is a keeper.

A Hit! My husband was craving ribs and I don't usually make them so he found this recipe and made them himself. They were amazing. Even my picky 7 yr. old loved them and asked for seconds. They have now become a regular meal every 2 weeks for us! Thanks for posting this! It was such a hit that my husband is now trying several new recipes from this site and I get to spend a little less time in the kitchen!

I made this recipe for tailgating yesterday.  It was awesome!  I did change the cooking process.  Boiled the ribs for 20 minutes to remove the fat. Then placed them with the sauce in a crock pot overnight.  Heated them on the grill the next day.  Everyone loved them!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

The cooking plan was great!  But, I didn't think the sauce was that spectacular.  I wish I would have saved myself the trouble and just used Cattleman's (Had some recently on ribs and tasted about the same).  Very good though, and had lots of compliments.

The best ribs ever.

I usually won't eat ribs because they taste like fat, but these don't.  They are great.

I've made a few changes to the sauce to use with bbq chicken as well [throw in some curry paste and apricot preserves].  Always a hit.

I've never made ribs before and these were awesome! I'm already making them again for a family function. I made the sauce exactly as it states but used county style pork ribs. They taste better than most restaurants! It's now a family favorite.

used 2 cups of ketchup instead of 3.
cut out the brown sugar and bought barbeque sauce with brown sugar already in it.  no lemon used or hot sauce.  used garlic powder instead of cloves. very tasty.

This is THE recipe for spareribs!!  If you are looking for tender, falling off the bone ribs, look no further.  We loved everything about these ribs.  The sauce was fantastic.  I made four pounds of spareribs and still had enough sauce left over for the next time I make them.  Sylvia, you made me a believer about boiling the ribs first.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

DELICIOUS!  I made 4 lbs. of ribs and there is one rib left!  I did cook them in a dutch oven, and added a little more garlic, and soy sauce. This was an easy favorite and will definitely make again and again!

Wow!  This was a very easy recipe!  Boiling the ribs made them so tender and I even cooked mine in my dutch oven without the foil and they were wonderful!  This is a keeper and I used granulated garlic insted of the garlic and used a little bit of mustard too.  I will try this with chicken.  Thanks!

These were the same ol, same ol ribs.  I did like the lemon and garlic in the sauce.  I'll stick to bottled sauce and add the lemon and garlic to them.  This is good, but nothing out of the ordinary.

I make these quite often!  The whole family loves them!  The only thing I change is 2 cups of Ketchup and 2 cups of BBQ sauce.  I find 3 cups of ketchup is too much!!

Fantastic recipe, Sylvia! These ribs have a great sweet/spicy flavor, and the best part is, you really don't need to use exact measurements.  Thanks for the recipe, I'm sure I will use this many more times.

what a wonderful recipe.  I double it because our family loves ribs.  I also used some crushed red pepper and added additional lemon, hot sauce, Worcestershire to suit our tastes.  It is a keeper!  Thank you! :)

My husband raved about these ribs to his friends for a week. He is begging me to make them again. I used 3 lbs of ribs and there was STILL plenty of sauce to go around.
Best rib recipe I have found yet!

Oh my goodness!  This is the BEST homemade BBQ sauce recipe I have found.  My kids and hubby, who aren't big bbq sauce fans, loved it and gobbled it up.  My sister almost didn't believe me when I told her it wasn't homemade.  I will never buy bbq sauce again except to make this recipe.  I will always have a container of it in my fridge!  Thanks Sylvia!

These turned out very good. I liked how the sauce stuck to the ribs and the taste was wonderful! I used a little more hot sauce because I like spicy foods. I didn't have any steak sauce so that was omitted, but it turned out just as yummy.

I've never cooked ribs in my life before and this was a great way to get started.  I tweaked the sauce a bit but that was only because I didn't have some of the ingredients listed!

I have to admit that this turned out to be a very good recipe.  My husband enjoyed it even though he didn't believe boiled ribs could turn out so good.  The meat fell off the bone.

I substituted chili sauce instead of ketchup.  I also used 2 cups of chili sauce & 2 cups of bbq sauce (only because I ran out of chili sauce).  I followed recipe exactly.  Came out perfect!!!!

Amazing recipe!  My husband can't get enough of them.  The leftovers are great too if your lucky enough to have any.  I like that they can just hang out in the oven for whenever your ready to serve them.

Excellent!  Instead of boiling the ribs (due to not enough time in the day!) I put them in the crock pot on low all day...  My picky husband was even impressed!  I am planning to make again tonight without changing an ingredient!  Thank you!  :o)

I would rarely make ribs because they never would come out great and I had tried many different recipes.  This recipe was wonderful.  The ribs tasted delicious and they were very tender.

Thanks, these are the only ribs I make!!  I love that you can add or change ingredients based on what you have on hand.  I use less ketchup (1 cup)and add 1 cup of tomato sauce.  I've used all honey when I don't have any brown sugar and have even used some corn syrup or maple syrup.  They always are delicious!!

These are fantastic!  I usually make ribs with straight BBQ sauce, but these were much better.  The sauce is great to dip with French bread!

Great barbecue sauce recipe! We had 2 racks of ribs to cook...I boiled the ribs and then grilled and basted 1 rack with the cooked barbecue sauce...(We like our ribs a bit on the dry side)...and then baked the second rack in the oven...They were good too, but we liked the texture of the ribs when they were grilled outdoors better...All in all, a very nice recipe that I will use again!  Thanks for posting it!! P.S. These go great with a nice cold beer :)

This recipe was great!!!!!  We used two slabs of pork ribs and the sauce was just enough to cover them.  Everyone who came over while they were cooking stayed for dinner.   Will definitely make this again.

Yum!!!!These are the best ribs I have ever tasted!  When I make ribs, I never use plain bbq sauce, I always make my own, and this was different than my own, so I tried it and the results were FANTASTIC!!  My hubby and son really enjoyed it also, not a piece of rib or sauce was left.  This replaces my old recipe!  Thanks Sylvia!

Great sauce, I usually am not a big fan of ribs, but I went back for thirds!
I made twice the amount of ribs, but still had lots of sauce left over. My family told me to keep the recipe. I will also try it on chicken.

This recipe is the best my family has had so far and we are barbeque people.  I even cook the sauce and use it on everything else.  It's fantastic!

Excellent recipe!  I also added fresh  minced onion along with the garlic and it turned out great! I will use this recipe from now on for ribs.  I also used the leftover sauce on grilled chicken, also very good!

Thanks for the recipe! I used more BBQ sauce and less ketchup. This was a fabulous recipe...my husband never used to let me in the kitchen with my cooking but after trying this recipe he told me I was a great cook!!! :)

THIS RECIPE WAS MY FIRST TRY AT MAKING RIBS-AND BOY WAS IT GOOD. AND EASY. I PLAYED AROUND WITH THE SAUCE, I SUBSTITUTED CHILI SAUCE FOR 1/2 THE KETCHUP AND ADDED MORE GARLIC. I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS. THANK YOU SYLVIA!  CRAE

These turned out pretty good tonight. I didn't have a chance to boil them ~ so, I cooked them completly in the oven. Everyone really seemed to enjoy them.

What a great tasting sauce...so easy to make and you can hardly go wrong making it. I made it one time when my parents came to visit and now my mom makes it all the time. My husband requests that I make this sauce when he BBQ's ribs.

My family loved this recipe! We have such a hard time getting our kids to eat we were astonished when not only did they eat them a week later they asked for me to make them again! Thank you so much!

Fantastic!  Not a crumb left over.  Should have made a double batch!  Super easy, too!
