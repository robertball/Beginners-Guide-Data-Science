Very easy recipe to make.  The amount of batter is more than enough for one 9" cake pan.  I had to use several custard cups to accommodate the extra.  Not a problem.  What was a problem was the texture of the cake after being chilled over night.  The cake which had a rich, cake-like texture after cooling to room temperature became fudge-like after being cooled overnight.  I tasted the cake both ways and do not feel that the flavor (which was very nice) improves with time.  I might make this again for a real chocolate diehard but I would definitely serve it same day at room temperature.

This is an excellent recipe. I made it for a potluck and everyone enjoyed it. Used a springform pan instead of cake pan as there was way to much batter for the cake pan.
Topped with fresh strawberry sauce.

although i messed up the first time and added  a cup of espresso grounds (unbrewed)  i imagine that if done right this is probably a good recipe. when looking on line for similar recipes i found that nobody really described the type if pan to use or how to seal a spring form pan .......

This is absolutely delicious desert, but it doesn't have the same texture as regular cake so don't expect that. It's 1,000 times better.  I didn't have a 9" pan, but I found it to fit perfect in two 8" pans and helped it to go further for more guest. As for the individual who mentioned that chocolate squares have soy protein; all the research I've done indicates that soy protein is gluten free and safe for individuals with celiac.

It is simple, both with regards to ingredients and making. I made it as a part of a cake menu, as the choice for true chocolate lovers and it was a true success at the party.

It was a great recipe. However if their are any ciliacs thinking of trying this recipe i recommend you check the ingredients on the chocolate squares as they often contain a soy protein.

This cake was really delicious, but pretty rich in flavor. There was also definitely no way the batter would have fit into a 9 inch cake pan. I used a bundt pan and it was the perfect size. When I took the cake out of the oven, the cake was at the very brim of the pan, but after a few minutes, it had deflated a bit.

Also, please realize that this is flourless cake. The texture is not what you'd expect from a traditional coffee cake. It has a very "eggy" texture, obviously due to the 8 eggs. This would be a great recipe for someone who is gluten free!

FANTASTIC. I made this for Mother's Day and my mom could not have been happier. We ate it same day, and next day, and it's delicious both ways. Keep in mind, the more you beat the eggs, the more dense the batter will become. I barely beat them and the cake was delicious. I decorated the top with fresh raspberry instead of the puree and it was delicious.

The flavor is good but the texture was not. No one liked it in my house or my neighbors as I gave her some to bake up.  Broken up into pieces in like an ice cream blizzard or topping it is good but I won't make it again. Not cakelike or fudgelike.

This would be better rolled into small balls or portions as a bite sized treat. It was very delicious but too rich to have a while slice. I would roll it into balls in confections sugar next time!

Took cake out after chilling it for 24 hours.  When I turned it out of the pan, it collapsed everywhere.
