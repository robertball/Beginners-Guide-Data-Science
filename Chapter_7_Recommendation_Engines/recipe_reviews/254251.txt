Simple and honestly just great beans.  Nothing fancy, nothing fake, just great beans.  
I did use oil to re-fry the beans as instructed and that was great but lard would even be more authentic and oh so, delicious.  
I had both Oaxaca and Cotija cheese available for topping. 
Note: when re frying, scoop out the beans without a lot of juice - you can add a bit more bean juice if needed but there will be a lot of extra bean juice in the pot.

This is the first time I've made refried beans and they came out great. I cooked it on high in a crock pot for 4 hours and then used a food processor instead of mashing the beans. It needed a little more salt but these are way better than beans out of a can. I will definitely make this again.

Used bacon grease in place of the oil, added fine diced onion and jalapeno to the refry. Good beans.
