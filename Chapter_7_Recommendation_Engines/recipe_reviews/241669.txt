These were delicious!  The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is that the peanut butter frosting was a little bit runny so I had to add a little more confectioners' sugar to get it to a more frosting-like consistency.  If you make this yourself just add the milk a little bit at a time instead of putting it all in the bowl right away before mixing so you can get the consistency you like.
