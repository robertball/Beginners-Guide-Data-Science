This soup is awesome.  My kids asked me to make it the very next day....So we ended up having it two days in a row.  The second day we added water chestnuts and bamboo shoots.  I added more garlic, scallions, & mushrooms than the original recipe called for because we like a chunky soup.  I omitted the carrots.  This tastes just like the soup at our favorite (upscale) restaurant.  Thanks for sharing!!

First, I doubled the recipe as I had to feed four, and my DH loves his Asian food, so I figured he'd eat more than 1 bowl.  I served it as an appetizer before a ginger-garlic stir-fry.  I did add extra ginger and garlic (as we like it) and only 1 cubed chicken breast, which was quite enough chicken.  I also added diced potato to chunk it up since I didn't have the mushrooms or snow peas.  I wish I did, it would have really added to the soup!  Will try some kale in it next time, too.  DH said it was fantastic, better than what our 3 local Japanese steakhouse and our sushi bars serve.  He said I have to make it again - often.  He also said it was his new favorite soup!

This was pretty good. It seemed a little bland, but I'm not sure what else you could add, maybe more garlic? Next time I will cook the vegetables longer, we don't like crunchy vegetables in our soup.

A very quick and easy dish. My GF and I were surprised at how good it tasted, and the calorie count allowed us to go back for seconds without feeling guilty.

This recipe was really good! I doubled the ingredients for the broth and added some whole wheat noodles to it before adding in the veggies. I didn't add the snow peas since I didn't have them. I will definitely make this again!

Super easy and tasty, and a great cure for a sore throat.  I skipped the scallions and peas because I didn't have any, and doubled the mushrooms to add a little more bulk.  I also doubled the garlic as others said it was a bit bland without.  All in all, really tasty!

Great flavor and my three year old liked it. I did double the mushrooms in place of peas, also diced the mushrooms for better flavor distribution. Made plenty for both of us and then some. I would defiantly make it again.

Everybody liked it! For that, alone, it deserves 5 stars, but next time I will use less soy sauce.

This soup is good but I found it a little bland.  I added brown rice noodles and shiitake mushrooms and they were a welcomed addition.  I will make this soup again but I will add a little more soy sauce, tofu and bamboo shoots along with the rice noodles and the mushrooms.  I will also substitute shrimp/prawns for the chicken.

I tripled the recipe to have enough for our family of 4 with some left over. It was delicious and everyone enjoyed it!  Perfect comfort soup for when you have a cold.

Great starter! Added one piece of celery, one carrot, and 1/4 of a sweet onion in large pieces that I removed before eating. Started with a teaspoon of ginger then tasted and was perfect!
