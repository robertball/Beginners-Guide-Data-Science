I don't care for crookneck squash, but had some in my farm produce delivery.  I decided to try this recipe and was definitely not disappointed.  It's very tasty, giving the squash a flavor I like. For the mustard I used stone ground dijon.  I will be making this again.

I tried this one out on a group of friends as a side to our Steak's on the grill, I added mushrooms and some zuccini we had lying around.  I think the mushrooms gave it too much liquid -- next time I think we'll just through them on the grill instead.  Thanks for the recipe.  I love trying new ways to make veggies.

This is very good.  A nice change from plain steamed squash. Make sure to use the whole amount for the squash & tomato or adjust the sauce.  The first time I made it I only used 2 of each and the sauce was over powering.

Wonderful flavor. I was desperate one night & realized this can easily be done stove top. I mixed the sauce together with the exception of the olive oil & put tomatoes into it. Then sauteed the squash seasoned with salt & pepper in the olive oil until it was almost done. Added the tomatoes & green onion until just softened. Was ready in less than 12 minutes. I do love the oven version too, but sometimes forget about my veggies or someone shows up & I need extra so I have to compromise.

Hmmm. I really like the tangy flavor that the vinegar and mustard bring to this dish...but there is something missing that will take this dish from good to great. I just can't put my finger on it right now. I added vegan "parmesan" sheese topping and that helped. Still trying to think about what's missing. Maybe toasted nuts? A fresh herb? I'm stumped.

Followed recipe exactly. Had squash and tomatoes from our garden. We like to try all kinds of different recipes, but this one didn't go over as we thought. Beautiful presentation, not crazy for the flavor.

Very tasty. I am so bored with plain squash, and this definitely cured it. I'll prepare this for the family next weekend to see how it goes over.  I have a feeling it will be a huge hit.

ok this is my lowest rating ever. the combination was a bigg hit but it took longer to cook then was mentioned. the sauce/marinade was not enough to reach all veggies. might make again but with more sauce and a little longer to suit my personal taste. thanks though.

Tangy and interesting. Be careful not to over cook as the tomatoes will get mushy. This makes for a beautiful presentation and is so easy to prepare.

I made this recipe using a garlic jalapeno mustard and it was great.  As I had leftovers, being only 3 of us, I reheated it in the microwave and topped it with a strong white cheese and broiled it for a minute. It was better yet.  Thank you.

I didn't think the receipe sounded that good but tried it anyway and really enjoyed it. However, I did alter it and thought I really improved it. I diced the squash, added more chopped green onions and put the sauce on top of it all in the casserole dish. I baked the squash until it was almost tender, took it out of oven and mixed the squash to make sure it was all coated with the sauce. I then put the sliced tomatoes on top of the squash and sprinkled a little (about 1 T total) black current balsamic vinegar on top of the tomatoes. I then added croutons on top of the whole casserole and baked about 10 minutes more until the tomatoes were slightly cooked. The black current balsamic vinegar and croutons added a lot.

We have an overabundance of squash & tomatoes thanks to my CSA & home garden.  This is a FANTASTIC way to get us out of our squash rut.  Unbelievably easy and uber tasty!  I used diced yellow onions instead of green, and it was awesome.

This was excellent.  It made a very tasty side dish that almost outshone the rest of dinner.  I cut the recipe in half since I was making for just me, and I felt like it could have used just a little more of the sauce so if you are planning on cutting, don't cut the sauce as much as the vegatables.

I made this my husband who loves squash and tomatoes mixed together.  I can't go there myself.  But he loved it.  I only used one fairly large yellow squash and one tomato cut into chunks but I used the full measure of sauce.  I had no green onions so I left them out completely.  I don't know if I cut the squash too large but it did have to cook longer than 15 minutes for the squash to be done.  I'll probably be making it again.  Thanks for the healthy squash recipe!

Fantastic! My family loves it. I used red onions instead of green and yellow mustard instead of dijon and it was just delicious.

I really like these, and there are so many ways to tweak it to make it ones own! This is a good, basic recipe, and you can add or subtract ingredients as you see fit. I have always made this recipe with zucchini, but yellow squash works just as well :-)

This was so good! I used zucchini instead of yellow squash and yellow onion instead of green and it turned out fabulous! I added 8 garlic cloves to it, yum!

My neighbor gave some crookneck squash and I wanted to find something new to do with with it. I tried this recipe because I had all of the ingredients at home and it sounded quick and easy. I can't believe how much I LOVED this recipe. The only difference is that I used apple cider vinegar and spicy brown mustard because that is what I had. I did have to let it cook 25 minutes but it was so worth it. I will make this one again and again.

Giving four only because, 1, tomatoes slices should be cut to bite size. 2, after baking, drain dish and drizzle another dose of sauce. That makes it a five!!

Easy - peasy.  I threw some oil in a frying pan, added the squash, tomatoes and onions (regular yellow ones) and cooked for about five minutes.  Mixed 2 T vinegar and 1 T. of mustard and poured it over the top, along with salt and pepper.  My husband said it was the best squash recipe yet.  Miracles never cease.  The mustard and vinegar really add a tang to this.  I left the squash a little on the firm side.

Based on some of the other reviews, I made the following changes:  added fresh thyme and Parmesan cheese.  Also baked at 375 degrees for 30 minutes, then added tomatoes and cooked 10 minutes more.  This squash is best peeled and and seeds scraped out.  Really enjoyed the other flavors used by the author.  I think the squash in the recipe is not the same as the one I used.  Mine had an orange flesh and bumps.

I made it tonight and everyone liked it except I think I used older and bigger squash. They want you to use 4 in a quart casserole dish and I could only get 1 1/2 full size ones. (I've never had crook necked squash before). So it took longer to cook and the skins were tough. Next time I'll pick them smaller and softer.

HOMEMADE PIZZA!  After baking your crust, spread thin layer of pesto, sprinkle pine nuts, then add the tomatoes, yellow squash with scallions and dressing (just as it is in the recipe), top with some fresh mozarrella.  Even my picky 15 year old gobbled it up!

I tried the recipe because I love yellow squash but dislike cooked tomatoes.  My husband (hates veggies in general) and I didn't finish our portions.  I'm sure the recipe is fine but just not to our particular tastes.

Had to cook this longer than recipe called for but over all, it was good.
