The vinegar was overpowering in this during the cooking phase and I was concerned it was going to ruin the salmon I was preparing but was surprised at how good it was on the fish. I did not have apricots and I used agave instead of sugar.

I've rated this a four but in fairness I didn't follow the recipe I used it as a guideline. I was putting this on ham and one of my family isn't a fan of apricots. I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar I didn't have fresh ginger so used ground ginger instead - next time it will be fresh. With using brown sugar the amount of rice vinegar was fine. I also added a little bit of crushed red chili pepper.

Spectacular idea, a great balance of sweet, tart, tangy. 

I admit that I improvised a lot. But that's what makes  this a great recipe. 

I had a couple of over ripe apricots and some mango. Grated in some ginger. A bit of water, some white balsamic vinegar substituted for the rice vinegar/sugar reduction. A squeeze of lime to finish. I can use it on chicken, but also shrimp or even drizzle on an english muffin, over plain yogurt, pancakes.
