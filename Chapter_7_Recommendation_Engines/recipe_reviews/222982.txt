I have a standard strawberry pie I've been making for years, but I like trying new recipes, and this was was great.  I followed the recipe to a T, and it came out perfect. If you refrigerate the pie for a few hours, the recommended amount of cornstarch is perfect. Next time I make this pie, I will pour the starwberry mixture in a vita mixer so the sauce would be smoother.  The taste was divine, esp. the painted chocolate piecrust.  This one is a keeper!

I have never liked traditional strawberry pie, I always found it way too sweet and way too fattening. I was incredibly worried about this one, especially when my strawberry goo thickened up pretty much immediately and I knew it wasn't going to survive 12-14 minutes on the burner. I took it off after 5 minutes and tasted it; my test taste must've had a pocket of lemon juice, it was terribly sour. However, this recipe turned out AMAZING! The lemon juice must've calmed down after cooling in the fridge (mine set in less than 2 hours). I never keep blueberries around because I tend to forget I have them and they go bad fairly quickly, so I used sliced kiwi instead. I can picture myself sitting on the beach drinking my frozen daiquiri and eating a slice of this beauty. The only thing I would do differently next time is use less chocolate (I used my own Wilton chocolate wafers and overdid it a bit).

This is an incredibly well thought out recipe.  I followed it to the tiniest detail, and it was beautiful and delicious!  The chocolate in the crust is a very clever touch to keep it firm,  and the filling combines for ideal texture and flavor.  The whole berries at the base in particular make for a perfect element of beautiful fresh berry flavor in the sweet and tart filling.

I baked this pie yesterday, following the directions exactly, and it got rave reviews from everyone in my family. None of them are normally "dessert people" but everyone went back for a second helping of this pie! The chocolate painted pie crust was brilliant! I used white chocolate and it added such a yummy flavor to the pie and a crunchiness to the crust. The level of sweetness was perfect, as was the consistancy of the filling. Thanks so much for sharing this amazing recipe...it has become an instant summertime favorite in my family!

I made this for a neighborhood bbq and I was asked for the recipe by everyone that had it. It was the chocolate on the crust that people mentioned the most. It just adds something different. It is one of those desserts that makes people think you're a master baker even though it is really easy to make!

The lemon juice adds a nice citrus pop to what is usually a very sugary pie. Adding ginger ale to the cornstarch is inspired as it hides the flavour. 10/10!

Made this for the second time today.  I used a regular pie pan instead of a deep dish.  I cut the  berries into halves to compensate.  Was running late so only kept it in the fridge about 6-1/2 hours or so. Consistency was perfect, and everyone swooned over it.

Every year a make pies to bring the Veterans being treated for illness around Thanksgiving, and every year I'm asked to make more Strawberry Pie. It is a huge hit and quite easy to make.
