I followed the recipe pretty well. I did marinate the legs is the sauce in the fridge for four hours. I didnâ€™t check the internal temperature for 70 minutes. By that time the chicken was falling off the bone so I suggest an earlier check of the temperature. The flavor was still very good.

Followed the recipe and unfortunately the family did not care for it. I thought it was ok.

I left out the meat tenderizer.  I don't really even know what that stuff is or what it does.  Made my own adobo.  No added salt and the recipe is dairy free!  This turned out really good!
