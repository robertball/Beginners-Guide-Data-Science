I followed the recipe exactly as written. I didn't add, omit, or substitute anything, and I used an enameled dutch oven.

Overall the stew turned out really well. The vegetables come out al dente after one hour of cooking. It was definitely very different from the types of things I have been cooking lately. We enjoyed eating it and will save the leftovers for later, but I doubt it will become something I make frequently; perhaps when in the mood for something unusual.

One reviewer said it "kind of tastes funny," and I can see why someone might say that. This stew definitely has a sharp note that might be a little too much to some people. I thought about it and narrowed it down to 3-4 things. The reviewer suspected the parsnips.  They definitely do add a unique flavor to the dish. Second, the sausage itself has various spices in it, the most noticeable being fennel which stands out in the dish. Third, the tomatoes and their juice give the dish an acidic bite that became somewhat taxing by the end of the meal. There are so many similar tomato products at the store, did I pick the right kind? I did my best and used a 28oz can of "plum tomatoes in juice" so I think I got it right. Might be interesting to drain the juice next time and substitute with more chicken stock (or water). Fourth, the wine?

One last note, and this is my fault for being a novice: I wish the recipe had said to peel the parsnips. This was my first time cooking with parsnips and I didn't know that. I do now.

This turned out excellent, on my first try making it too. Made it for company we had over and it was a big hit with everyone. I did add a few extra things like zucchini and corn. Then made some garlic noodles and ate it over the top of those. It was great and thanks for the recipe!

This is a very pleasnant recipe that, in this house, would qualify as a comfort food. The only tweak I made was to add 1/2 cup more barley. ... By substituting vegetable broth for the chicken broth, and eliminating the meat, this would be an excellent vegetarian dish.

This was fantastic. I made a couple of alterations, but nothing too insane. I did not have chicken stock, so I used beef boullion and it gave it a really nice richness. I added a lot more of the dry white wine and doubled the seasoning. I used turnip greens instead of the swiss chard and their mild bitterness added a very subtle note. And I doubled all of the veggies and added a whole bag of barley, and it came out ridiculously delicious. This is a winner!

So flavorful! I love that this is loaded with veggies! I had gotten mushrooms, parsnips, swiss chard, and onions in a produce delivery and had carrots and celery on hand so I was looking for a recipe to use as much of the produce that I could. This turned out perfect. It's definitely going into my "make again" pile.

My family loved this dish. Because I know I have a picky eater in our family I did change the parsnip to potato. I also added more seasoning than asked for, I added fresh garlic, basil and dried oregano. I will make this again and will consider making for company, it was that good!

My whole family loved this one. I made some substitutions to use what I had on hand (Yukon gold potatoes for the parsnips and fresh spinach for the swiss chard) but followed as directed otherwise. I loved the addition of barley which acts as a thickener and gives the stew a nice consistency. Comforting, hearty, and wholesome!

Great recipe.  My grocery store  didn't have any Swiss Chard, so I used Nappa Cabbage instead.  All the different flavors blended extreamly well. Quite easy to put together. We enjoyed this very much.

Hearty, tasty and relatively easy. I subbed kale for the chard, and I suspect any dark leaf would work. And I doubled the salt and Italian seasoning after a first try came out a little blander than my taste buds prefer.

Wow what a great stew.  It was fast and easy to make and it hit the spot.  I am going to use this for a base and tweak it a bit.  But is is good just as it is.

I read the reviews about the "different" flavor this stew had and since I do not like fennel or Italian sausage, I changed the meat to Kilbasa and we all loved it! Like other reviews I added a bit more barley and extra mushrooms, cause I love them. I also added an extra cup of water to balance out the extra barley. Thanks for a great stew.

This turned out great.  I did use fresh spinach in place of the swiss chard.   A versatile dish with good flavor!

Yum~~~ I mean yum~~~~ I added 2 cloves of garlic and didn't have Swiss chard so  I used the cabbage instead from my fridge. Instead of Italian sausage links, I had some left over turkey sausages and ham, so I threw both of them in there.
Oh my my my~~ Seriously? Sooo good! Will make again and again! Thank you for the recipe!!!
