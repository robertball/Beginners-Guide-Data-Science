They were ok.  I couldn't find Alessi brand breadsticks so I used the shorter ones I found in my local grocery store.  They were fine, just nothing wow.  I mixed light and dark brown sugars.

LOVE this recipe! I use it often. I use 1/2 Alessi breadstick for each, and split each bacon strip in half. the long way so it fits the smaller stick.  ADVICE: Need to plan for a few breadsticks breaking during prep - since they are so thin (but that's OK because that gives me an excuse to snack on the broken bits!) Since the sticks are shorter, i usually cook for 45 minutes, but it depends on how crispy you want the bacon too.
