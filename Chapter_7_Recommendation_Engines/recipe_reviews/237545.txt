I've been wanting to make cauliflower "rice" for a while, this recipe was perfect! The only thing I added was water chestnuts, I like that in my fried rice. Hubby and I, and  our non-picky eaters loved it.

It was okay. I made it exactly as directed except that I used pre-cooked bacon (a smart move, I think). It wasn't bad, but it just tasted so strongly of cauliflower. It's not that I dislike cauliflower, But in the end it was just a bowl full of cauliflower and bland chicken with a few (albeit yummy) toppings. And there's SO MUCH OF IT. I'll finish it but I wouldn't make it again.

Left out bacon (don't like)  and egg (allergy), but added broccoli and shrimp. Needed much more soy sauce than recommended (added and tasted to find right amount) but it turned out great.  Time to cook was even less than the amount listed because the shrimp were cooked already. Easy and pretty healthy.  Didn't notice it was missing rice at all. Tasted like something I'd order in a Chinese restaurant-  in a good way!

My low carb -eating family is crazy for this recipe.  I make it twice weekly.  I like it too and I don't like cauliflower.  Who knew?

This was good and I didn't miss the rice at all.... But in my opinion, you should cook the bacon separately. I had to pull it out because it never crisped up and I didn't want to eat chewy fat. With the bacon crisped up I added it back in. Added some onion, garlic and sesame oil.  Very good.

It was very tasty. The smell wasn’t good while cooking, but that’s cauliflower for you. I had riced the cauliflower, then frozen it. It didn’t affect the dish at all. I just drained the water off that had accumulated as it thawed. It makes quite a lot—enough for six good servings. I will likely make it again. I did add a little black pepper, real salt and garlic.

I have been wanting to try cauliflower as a substitute and this was a great meal to try. It was easy to make but the prep took  a while because I had to cut up the chicken thighs. I substituted turkey bacon for pork bacon. Also, I seasoned the chicken with lemon pepper, onion powder, Italian seasoning and oregano. I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of Vegetable Oil. I’m so excited to say my 14 year old son loved it!! I will definitely make this again and look forward to substituting cauliflower in more meals.

I cooked the bacon before the chicken to give far to cook the chicken in. Today I used broccoli rice instead. And added ginger and garlic to it.yum

I made this and the batch was huge!  I ended up cutting back the bacon and chicken a bit and I'm not sure if I made it again that would even bother with the bacon because I don't know that it added a lot to the flavor.  Beware if you make a whole recipe you may have enough to serve 10+ if you are making it as a side. 

I topped this with cabbage and broccoli that I stir fried with a teriyaki sauce, which kicked up the flavors a bit.
