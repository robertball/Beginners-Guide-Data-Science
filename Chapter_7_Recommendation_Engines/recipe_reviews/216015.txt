This is awesome.  FYI: Ghirardelli is sold at Target at a good price!  I used Almond meal (from Trader Joe's) & raw sugar and lower glycemic palm sugar and batter was a bit gritty looking, but came out fine.  I used the brown rice flour as recipe called for, and was so good (I sometime use other gluten free flours, but this was just fine) and I sometimes cut sugar, don't do it here.  I also used my metal kitchen aid mixer bowl to stack on top of a regular pan since I had no official double broiler.  I have tried a couple recipes from Ghirardelli and it's ALWAYS wonderful!

Very good flavor, although the texture was off. I made them twice, and the first time I use almond meal. The brownies were mealy and developed a thick crust on top. The second time around, I did as another reviewer mentioned and used almond butterâ€” it made a huge difference. The brownies were much smoother and didn't have the thick crust on top. Nobody could tell they were gluten free, and my GF friends were delighted. Four stars for the recipe as written, but if you use almond butter instead, this becomes a five star recipe.

Fabulous brownies! Not too sticky or sweet. They held their form. Cracked, shiny tops are also a good touch. I used semi sweet chocolate chips instead of bittersweet and Earth Butter instead of butter because my mum can't have milk fat (or gluten). I also recommend using light brown sugar instead of white sugar for brownies in general. Otherwise, I followed the directions to the word. The only issue I had with the recipe was that 25 minutes was not nearly long enough. I had to leave them in the oven for an extra 10 minutes.

Amazing and awesome crackle-top brownies!  My almonds weren't very finely minced, though, which made the texture a bit grainy.  Next time, I'll substitute in almond butter for the almond meal.  And trust me, there -will- be a next time!

This is truly a fool proof recipe. I've made them countless times with variations and they always come out perfect. The original recipe calls for 3/4 cup of sugar which was too sweet for my tastes. I use about a half cup of organic sugar and even still they are a bit sweet but no one's complaining! I also found 6T of butter is a bit much and if you reduce it to 5T it is hardly noticeable. I use smart balance too. So feel free to fool around with this recipe, it is adaptable. No one will ever miss the wheat!

I have to say that I had to cook this in a convection microwave oven, so it took me more like 45 minutes vs the 20-25 that the recipe says it will and I added a cup of white chocolate chips instead of walnuts or pecans... but I LOVED these. They are super yummy and my husband couldn't even tell they were gluten free when he ate them. Super easy to make. I did use the whole almonds vs the almond flour. May try the almond flour next time.

Quite nice.  On the fudgey side. Doesn't carry the gluten-free stigma because they are delicious.

For gluten free, this is definitely a 5 star!  I'm not used to cutting out gluten at all, and it still was a very tasty and moist brownie.

These had good flavor, but they didn't have the texture I was after.  I probably won't be making these again.  They crumbled too easily for our taste.

Here is the finished product!!! I made these twice for lactose intolerant and gluten allergy friends.  These were my substitutions: 1. 4-5 tbsp's of applesauce plus 1 tbsp of olive oil 2. Replaced the Ghirardelli chocolate chips with Enjoy Life gluten, dairy and soy free chocolate mini chips (sold at Target) 3. 4 tbsp's almond butter instead of whole almonds. 4. Sweet Rice flour instead of brown rice flour (asian supermarket) 

Since I substituted almond butter for the whole almonds, I incorporated it right after I added the eggs to the chocolate mixture since it didn't seem logical to mix it in with the flour.  The texture was no longer grainy as it was the first time I made them.  Once everything was done, I spooned 2 tbsp's of the batter into foil cupcake tins, garnished with berries and cinnamon sugar!  My friends loved it. :)

WHAAAATTTTT!!!!????  These were AMAZING!  I am fairly new to the gluten free diet (arthritis issues...not celiac).  So my point is, I don't HAVE to eat this way...it's a choice.  These brownies were so delicious, I am shocked.  Most GF stuff, while edible, has at least some weird funk (too chewy, too dense, too pasty, etc)....none of those issues here.  I didn't change a thing* with this recipe (even though I thought the parchment paper thing was odd, I complied).  I used my coffee grinder to chop up the almonds (instead of a food processor).  My husband (who doesn't care if he has gluten or not) thought these were really good.  He was quite relieved, because he has suffered through some questionable GF desserts here lately. (*I did change the type of chips....all I had on hand were semi-sweet ghirardelli chips).

I'm giving this 5 stars, even though I made a couple changes.  I usually look for recipe's with great ratings - otherwise I pass them up.  I used almond meal/flour and had good results.  Here are the changes I made:  1) Instead of 6 Tbls butter I used 2 Tbls butter and 1/4 cup canola oil; 2) used 1/2 cup honey instead of 3/4 cup sugar.  I put in 3/4 cup chopped pecans (all I had) and added another 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the batter.  I think they turned out great - love them with a cup of coffee!  My DH likes dark chocolate but thinks these are a little too bitter.  My kids love milk chocolate and think these are horrible!  The texture is dense and moist.

Thank you! So exciting to finally find an easy to make gluten free recipe that tastes amazing. 

I did not have the rice flour, so I used Bob's Red Mill all purpose gluten free flour.

Also used white chocolate chips instead of nuts. 

All 3 of the kiddos and my husband loved it.

Fantastic gluten-free brownie! Even the picky kids I babysit and my roommates enjoy this brownie recipe!  I found it works especially well with duck eggs instead of chicken eggs (substitute 1 for 1 even though duck eggs are bigger)... they provide good lift to this gluten-free alternative.

I would give 3.5 stars but unable to do so here. The flavor is good.  It is probably me, but I don't care for brownies with almond flour. This is about the 3rd gluten-free brownie recipe I have tried with almond flour/almond meal.  It makes them a little too heavy with an undesirable texture.  I wish I would have caught on to the other reviews before I made these.  Other reviewers recommended using almond butter in place of almond flour - guess I will try that someday... I have also made gluten-free brownies (different recipe) with coconut flour and the texture was much better.

This is a great gluten free brownie! (Might be my new favorite.) Rather than tasting like the various gluten free flours it tastes nutty. I substituted brown sugar for white sugar and used coconut extract instead of vanilla extract. Incredible.

I baked these for over 45 minutes and they never set. I had a to change a few things, so I don't know what caused them to not work. I didn't have an 8x8 metal pan, only glass. I also used egg substitute. I'm guessing it's the egg substitute? Does anybody know for sure? Thanks for the help. I could tell the flavor was good, but I really want a brownie my family can eat!

This recipe is fine for Gluten Free Cooking.  I'm a pretty experienced cook, but had never used almond flour before this.  I STRONGLY suggest sifting both flours.  Additionally SKIP the salt.  I called these gluten free sweet and salty brownies.  I also had to bake them closer to 35-40 minutes.  That being said those issues aside it turned out well!

Completely delicious, thank you!!  Had a gluten-free friend over for dinner so tried these.  SO GOOD.  I thought my regular brownies were good, but I might start making these instead!  Could only find rice semolina so threw that into the blender to try to make it more powdery (like flour) for the recipe.  Had to bake it a bit longer than the recipe says but no biggie, maybe 10 minutes longer total.  SO DELICIOUS esp. with high-quality vanilla ice cream.  Again, thanks so much -- this is a definite keeper!!

Delicious! Made it with 2/3c almond butter instead of the almonds and flour. I used 1/2c of sugar instead of 3/4 and it was perfect.

These brownies are fabulous!  I didn't have any almonds or almond flour so I substituted gluten free all purpose flour.  I used organic coconut sugar.  Everyone loved them.  Next time I might add shredded coconut to the batter.  A definite keeper.

These are very dense, with a deep chocolate taste. Although they are gluten free, the consistency is still moist. The ground almonds give the brownies a bit of an "al dente" bite which is pleasant and a bit addictive. My daughter and family love them! Perfect with some vanilla ice cream!

I don't use almond flour so I substituted it for coconut flour... it was sooo delicious :) These brownies are my daughter's new all time favorite desert! We are allergic to corn and gluten and these were so good without all of those things :)

Wow!  Delicious!  I made these for a house guest with celiac disease (can't eat gluten).  I personally can't stop eating them!   I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9 x 13 pan.  I didn't use parchment paper, but I used cooking spray in the pan instead.  Instead of the walnut or pecan pieces, I added 2 more cups of chocolate chips before baking.  Oh...so good!

I have tried so many gluten-free brownie recipes, and this is the absolute best!  Nobody could tell they were GF.  Gooey and delicious.  The only GF brownie recipe you'll need!

This recipe is EXCELLENT! I use Trader Joe's almond meal, instead of whole almonds. I've made them plain, with pecans & with walnuts. My fav is with the walnuts. These are not only delicious, but even better than full gluten brownies! Unfortunately, my family has caught on to that fact, because even though I'm the only GF one in the house, they devour them before they even get a chance to cool completely. I usually have good luck keeping them away from GF recipes because they're "gross". I now have to make double batches if I want a brownie! Thanks a lot Ghiradelli, for making my kids chocoholics too. It's not a quick recipe, but definitely worth the wait.

I have made these brownies several times and love them!  No one in my family is gluten free, but we still devour these brownies as quickly as I make them.  I would definitely recommend changing almond flour to almond butter.  It makes a huge difference in the texture.  I also subbed the rice flour for gluten free baking flour and found that also helped with texture.   I have also tried one cook's suggestion to only use 2 TBSP butter and 1/4 cup canola oil.  That was an amazing brownie, especially when I melted chocolate chips all over the top.  I have found the bittersweet chocolate chips a little overwhelming, so I use half bittersweet and half semi-sweet.   Thanks for sharing this incredible recipe!

These are EXCEPTIONAL! I've been trying to tweak my favorite recipe for weeks, but can't get it 
Gluten Free and sugar reduced to satisfy. Tried these and switched out the almond meal for the 
almond butter as other reviews suggested. Glad I did. These are fudgy yum in decadent chocolate
flavor. So easy to make. I used a glass 8 x 8 dish vs. metal and didn't make a difference. Also added
the walnuts.  So surprised at the results a real go to and keeper recipe.

I used the general bones of the recipe, as I am unfamiliar with baking with brown rice flour but had it from another recipe. Instead of almonds/almond flour I used half a cup all purpose flour and mixed it with the brown rice flour. I also used a cup of Nutella instead of melted chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand. All in all they came out smelling delicious and tasted pretty good, the texture was  just a little off.

Wow, this recipe is PERFECT. My partner has a gazillion allergies and can't eat practically anything, so this recipe is a lifesaver, and it's also absolutely delicious. I made some substitutions: in place of ground almonds I used a third of a cup of grated coconut. In place of butter I used the same amount of canola oil. In place of the chocolate chips I used a 4 oz bar of Ghirardelli bittersweet baking chocolate. The rice flour I used was Bob's Red Mill brand (I don't have a lot of experience yet with rice flour baking, so I'm not sure if it matters). I baked the brownies for about fifty minutes, not twenty-five like the recipe says, and my pan was 9x9 and Pyrex, and greased with canola oil, not lined with paper. 

The results are chewy at the edges and fudgey in the center, with a really good flavour. I like the coconut and am glad I thought to try it, because the slight grittiness it adds makes the texture much more interesting. Next time I make these I will try using coconut oil in place of the canola I used this time, for a stronger coconut flavour. I will also use parchment paper next time, because they are very stuck to the pan and hard to remove without destroying them. I can't wait to feed these to my partner, and I'm sure I will be returning to this recipe many times. Thanks for posting!

I didn't try this recipe "as is" for my first go-around. I read the reviews and tweaked based on my specific needs (which was kind of a lot! Haha!) BUT the base was a good starting point! As already mentioned in previous posts, I also substituted the almonds for almond butter. Since I am lactose intolerant, I had to use a substitute for the butter as well. I went with coconut oil. And I also used gluten, dairy, and soy free chocolate chips that I found on the health food aisle of Kroger instead of the brand suggested in this recipe. I had to bake them a little longer: about 35-40 mins instead of 20-25 (probably because of the substitutions...or maybe because I lined the baking dish with aluminum foil instead of parchment paper...whoops), but they were DELICIOUS. I topped the brownies with chopped pecans. The edges were very chewy just like I love and the inside was very soft and gooey. From two sisters who were DESPARATE for a good dessert that wouldn't make us violently ill and from our friends who think eating this stuff is "weird", we would all give this recipe (with the few additions I made) a double thumbs up!!

This was great.  I used Almond Meal from Trader Joe's.  I only had salted butter - so I just skipped the salt.  I used semi-sweet Chocolate Chips and only added 1/2 cup sugar.  I love the simple ingredients.

Subbed almond flour for whole almonds at the amount suggested for convenience.  We don't eat gluten free normally, but needed a GF recipe for a meal I made for a friend.  These have become our favorite, go to recipe for brownies. On their own the are excellent, but paired with some vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup - DIVINE!

This is by far the best gluten free brownie recipe I've found! I used 2/3 cup almond flour and 1/2 cup milk choc chips and 1/2 cup bittersweet choc chips. I had to bake mine at least ten min longer though. I used a glass baking dish and also melted the butter and choc in the microwave. I also reduced the salt - the first time I made them, some bites were salty. Love the cracked top!

delicious.  My friend has celiac so i tried these.  Followed reciped exactly using almond flour and seni-sweet chips.  Easy to make, baking time is longer than what the reciped says but be careful, i think i overdid mine just a bit.  Recommend if you need to bake longer doing it in ten minute incriments twice then reduce to five mins.  I'll make these again!  Melted the chocolate in a bowl in hot water in my sink... easy

This was a yummy alternative to the typical brownies I make. I ate 2 of them before they were even cooled.  A substitution I made: I used almond flour, but I didn't have rice flour, so I substituted for the coconut flour I had on hand.  From what I read about the coconut flour, I had to add extra moisture.  So I used 1/4 c. coconut flour, added one extra egg and a 1/4 c. almond/coconut milk in place of the rice flour.  It turned out perfectly.  I suggest reading a little about coconut flour before using it as a replacement in baking.  There are some goodtips out there on the internet.

Just tried this recipe and it's delicious! Yes, it has a little gritty texture but we didn't mind it.  I used Pamela's flour and the Almond Meal/Flour by Red Mill. After reading the reviews before baking, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup only. We don't like it too sweet. I also scattered walnut pieces on top, looks pretty and nutty. I baked it on a nonstick 8"x12" cookie pan for 25 min at 325 degrees in a convection oven. It came out perfect just the way we like it. Not fudgy. I will try it on an 8"x8" pan next time but baking it longer than 25 min. as some reviewers suggested. 

Someone said it was falling apart, yes it will because there is no gluten which makes cakes and cookies stick together.  This gluten free idea seems to be a fad but I think its a healthy way to live.

I made this 4 times now.  First time was to the letter and measure.  OK flavor but the texture was a total miss.  Second time, replaced the sugar with brown sugar and that afforded a "chewier" brownie and the flavor was good but too buttery.  Third time kept the brown sugar substitute, cut back the butter by 1 Tbsp, and used almond butter.  We did not care for the pronounced "nuttiness" from the almond butter and the brownies were dense, but crumbly. This fourth time, we have a winner with texture and flavor!  Kept the brown sugar and reduced butter but used sweet rice flour and coconut flour (equal parts combined well) to replace the brown rice and almond altogether and incorporated a 1/4 tsp of baking powder into the flour mix. Also beat the eggs altogether before adding.  This resulted in a rich brownie that was chewy and not dense. Version 4 was a smash hit and gone in less than 2 hours! I needed ot cook them for 35-45 minutes easily.

Great Idea. Made some changes, including substituting palm sugar and shortening for the butter and sugar. I also used half Haitian  baking chocolate and half coco camino chocolate chips because that's what we had on hand. The basic Idea was very influential though especially since it doesn't call for a fancy gluten free baking mix.

Yum, yum, yum!! I had some fresh mint in the garden so I decided to throw some of that in the food processor with the almonds and the rice flour. I used a lot of mint. One decent sized sprig (I'd say around 15-20 leaves.) I love mint, so I found it quite tasty, but to the people who like mint but don't love it might want to cut back on the mint so it isn't too overbearing. 
This is such a great recipe for us GFers! I always love finding a great, indulgent recipe that is free of wheaty things! :)

This is a fantastic recipe!  Rich, dense and chocolaty!  Instead of using a double boiler to melt the butter, chocolate and salt I put them in a microwave-safe bowl and microwaved on HIGH for 30 second intervals twice and then once for 20 seconds; stirring in between each session.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter.  Will definitely make again.

I definitely give these a 5 star. I agree with the others they were very crumbly but they tasted delicious and luxurious. Will definitely be making these again. Unfortunately i had no chocolate chips so i just used 70% dark chocolate, i added another 1/3 cup of flour because the mixture was extreme liquidy with the melted butter and chocolate together. I then saved some of the melted chocolate & drizzled over the top. Very tasty, easy to make!

Amazing, gooey, delicious. I made them twice. Sifting the flours, the second time , made them just a wee bit better, but it is not necessary. And my wheat belly friends LOVED them, too. Didn't even miss the gluten.

Great chocolatey flavor, nice consistency but what is up with the  baking time?  Mine cooked for like 45 min before set.  I was going crazy checking and checking...still not done. Dusted with powder sugar upon presentation...yummy.

I've made this 4x. I use oat flour instead of rice and slivered almonds (ground to flour in the magic bullet). These are almost like fudge and beyond delicious. I serve it warm with mini chocolate chips on top then a scoop of frozen yogurt.

These were amazing! Now I'm not a brownie person but my family is, and on a scale from "1-5" my eight-year old proclaimed that  these brownies rated "100" I would say that is definitive for yumminess!
Now, I had to use Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Flour (instead of the brown rice flour)-which I used against my better judgement, because I really do not like the bean flavor that is so predominate in the recipes I have tried with it-but-in this recipe you absolutely do not taste the beany-ness! These definitely need extra baking time; I lost track of how long because I kept adding 5 min and testing with a toothpick. They are most definitely more fudgy then cakey but I may have accidentally  gone a little light on the almond meal so perhaps they would have baked a little faster with a little more almond flour.
See? Gluten free can be delicious-and try these with vanilla ice cream too!

This is DELICIOUS! Some of my favorite brownies, gluten-free or not (I was diagnosed with Celiac's at 21, and still remember the taste of those delicious Betty Crocker brownies... mmm). I only had baking chocolate, so I had to alter the recipe a little, by adding more sugar (and more sugar --> a little almond milk to adjust consistency). Soooo, so good, though. I'll be making this time and time again...

Amazing!  Great taste and texture - my first attempt at gluten free baking and you would never think they were anything other than delicious.  Hoping Ghirardelli alos has a GF chocolate chip cookie recipe!

These are definitely a very fudgy brownie! The flavor is good and anyone would like them. With a strong blender like a vitamix it is easy to blend your own almonds. Just make sure to only blend the rice in the grain container, with this machine, or buy it already ground. It needs to be a flour consistency. Partially ground will affect the texture. I added the optional walnuts and they were good in them. These are gluten free, but not low calorie or low saturated fat. Anyone on a gluten free diet would be very pleased with them though, I believe.

Gooey delicious! I used salted butter instead of adding salt. I substituted coconut sugar for the sugar and used I did use almond flour and omitted adding the whole nuts. I'm glad as I love the creamy gooey texture. very satisfying and not too sweet.  I made them in a glass dish with parchment and had to cook them an extra few minutes. I removed them as soon as the sides started cracking. center still a bit soft. YUM!

These get requested from gluten eaters as well.  They are moist and fudge like rather than cake like.
