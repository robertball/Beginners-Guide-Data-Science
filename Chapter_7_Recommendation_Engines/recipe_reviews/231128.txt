I served this with waffle sticks, mini pancakes and sliced apples for a "dippable" breakfast. We INHALED it, it's absolutely delicious.

Be forewarned, this is addictive.  Iâ€™d be hard pressed to find a recipe that celebrates autumn flavors any better than this served with fresh apple slices.  I use pumpkin and butternut squash interchangeably in recipes.  I used butternut and it was delicious.

This was soo good. Used cheesecake flavored pudding mix instead of the vanilla called for.  Served at a potluck inside a hollowed pumpkin. Just cut off the top gave it a quick cleaning, put ice inside the pumpkin(we live in Florida) and dropped the cool whip contained with dip in it right into the ice packed pumpkin.. even my no pumpkin pie eaters raved. Served with cinnamon grahams, ginger snaps and apples.

This was a massive hit as a Thanksgiving appetizer, even among family members who claim not to like pumpkin. It was awesome served with sliced apples and graham crackers, and next time I will try it with ginger snaps and vanilla wafers. Made the recipe exactly as written, and it turned out great. Prepared it the night before and baked the day of to save time.
