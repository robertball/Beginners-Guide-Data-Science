My husband made this last night with only a couple of substitutions - I don't care for chickpeas so he used great northern beans instead, roma tomatoes from our garden instead of grape tomatoes, and we didn't have white balsamic vinegar so he used a little regular balsamic and white vinegar combined. Delicious!!! We ate as a side dish with grilled chicken and it was a perfect meal. I brought some for lunch today and cannot wait to eat it.

Very nice salad. Definitely mix the dressing ingredients separately as noted by other reviewers. I took it to a party and served it on shredded lettuce. I'm now using the leftovers in tossed salad.

Very good!  Loved the pungent flavors of the feta and kalamata olives.  Definitely only mix what you will eat with your meal and keep the rest of the salad and dressing separate until ready to eat again.  Otherwise, although the taste is fine, it looks very unappealing after sitting in the fridge overnight.

Delicious, refreshing and hearty salad for the hot days of summer -- and also an excellent gluten-free substitute for pasta salad. A larger portion is a meal in itself. I plan to make this Sunday afternoon for work lunches next week. Incidentally, I used red balsamic vinegar instead of white (because that's what I had in the house) and it was still great.

This was EPIC!!! I used regular balsamic and regular oregano because my grocery store and my cabinet are both pretty basic.  Even with those changes, this salad was a home run.

This recipe was SO GOOD it made me lose my mind.  Bonkers.  Yummy wow.

I did make it larger, & added the juice of a fresh lemon squeezed in....  Also, I added some cucumber, and used 50/50 Balsamic / Champagne vinegar in the dressing (because that's what I had on hand).  MIND BLOWN - delicious!

Tasty.  I followed the recipe the first time I made this delicious salad.  The second time I used black beans instead of chick peas.  Also, delicious.  This is tasty for lunch and a quick snack at any time of the day. Good with an assortment of olive oils and balsamic vinegars..I have mixed orange olive oil with blackberry ginger, and cider vinegar.  Tasty and healthy.

This was a hit! I did not have olives nor capers. I Julianne the zucchini and used red onions. Def a keeper! Next time I will add the omitted ingredients just for a change.

I would not make a single change. This recipe has a very surprising fresh taste from so few ingredients. I would recommend not eating it until flavors have blended so perhaps let it meld for overnight. I am most definitely making this a staple favourite in our household. The whole family "loved" it.

Delicious! I didn't have any white balsamic vinegar so substituted champagne vinegar, and it came out fine. About a half-hour before serving, I mixed in chopped avocado and let it 'marry' to the other flavors. This is a winner, for sure!

Very good salad, but make sure you use white balsamic vinegar, as using dark balsamic will ruin the color and make for a horrid presentationâ€” still delicious though.

This is a very tasty alternative to some of the more traditional methods of preparing zuccinni and yellow squash.  I modified the recipe slightly in that I used raspberry balsamic which was fantastic.

Made this as written for a 4th of July outing. Doubled it as it said it served 6. We had 12 folks  that night, 4 the next and I still have a little left. Everyone loved it.

I've made this a number of times, following the recipe exactly.  Everyone to whom we've served it loves it.  I've learned to put less dressing on the salad, as the flavors are so wonderful to begin with.  This salad hold up well for a day or two, so we generally make more than we think we'll need, just to have the leftovers.

Great salad and dressing. In fact I am making more dressing today.  Nice way to use zucchini. A bit time consuming  to chop but well worth  it for all the mix of flavors. This could be a meal when served with grilled fish or chicken. Keeper.

Flavorful salad we'll probably use most as a side with a sandwich for lunches.  Another great way to use up some of the zucchini we seem to have in abundance in later summer!

Fantastic, even with omissions and substitutions! Wound up being an impromptu light dinner with avocado and flatbread. I didn't have olives or capers, and only had dried herbs on hand, but it still had plenty of flavor. My husband normally does not like garbanzos but  loved it anyway. Glad to have a new delicious and unique way to use up zucchini and tomatoes from the garden. Will definitely make again, hopefully next time with all the ingredients! :)

This is a delicious salad.  I did not change anything and found the recipe to be amazing.  My husband, who is pretty picky about food, loved it as well.  It's a perfect recipe to take to a function or get-together with friends and family.  It is a keeper recipe for sure.

Winner!  Hubby who does not like chickpeas really liked this salad and said we need to bring this on our beach camping trips.  Made exactly as written.  Leftovers are even better the next day.

Made this without the olives, which I donâ€™t care for.  Loved it!  It keeps really well, too.  I made it for my Dad when I visited him and he liked it so much he asked for the recipe and has made it several times on his own!

I didn't have a red bell pepper and substituted red onion instead of the sweet and dried spices instead of the fresh , but this was still a huge winner. Will definitely add this to the list of go-to's for weekday lunch prep or to bring to gatherings.

This is a superb salad, it has a lot of ingredients, but it is SO worth making.  It tastes good immediately, and stays tasty even up to 5 days later.  You will love it!

How amazing the flavors came together. It is 116Â° today here in the Coachella Valley and it was so refreshing for dinner mated with a glass of Cabernet. I would probably add some prosciutto next time.

Fantastic flavors! my red pepper was getting old so i roasted it and chopped it and threw it in. i think you can probably do a lot of substitutions of veggies and it would still be great!

This is a winner, we used plum tomatoes and because I did not have fresh red bell pepper I used a nice handful of roasted red bell peppers from the jar.  No white balsamic vinegar so I used white wine vinegar which is one of my favorites. Everybody loved it

A lovely chopped salad. I made a double recipe because I wanted it for several uses. The only changes I made were for longevity: I did not halve the tomatoes; and, I snipped the basil into portions of it as served. During the week I took it to work for lunch, with a little sliced chicken breast. On the weekend I tossed what was left with lettuce, toasted almonds, toasted sesame seeds, and a little extra Italian dressing for a dinner salad. I will definitely make this again.

I made 1/4 recipe, as I always do when testing a new recipe. That amount easily will make 3 side dish servings. Wonderful discovery as the salad is  healthful, tasty, and quick to prepare.. This will be great to have in the fridge when I am out of greens for salad, It could also be a vegetarian entree. I'm so pleased I tried it. Thanks Christine M for posting.

So delicious, so simple.  Tastes great per the exact recipe.  Also tastes great substituting various vinegars, lemon juice, beans, and omitting feta (one kid is lactose intolerant.)  We eat the entire dish every time.  If I ever have any leftovers, I'll let you know how it looks on day two.

I loved this recipe because I love chickpeas and zucchini and all the other ingredients. My wife also likes chickpeas but claims not to like uncooked zucchini or sweet peppers, but she raved about this salad. 
I made a few mostly insignificant changes: I didn't have white balsamic vinegar so I used white wine vinegar and lemon juice. I also mixed the liquids and spices separately with some Dijon mustard to promote emulsification, and then added the other ingredients. It was delicious.

We wanted a good summertime salad for dinner.  We topped this salad with chicken tenderloin sauteed with the same herbs and chilled.  Served it with garlic sourdough.  Was a very easy dinner. We will definitely make it again.

I love this. It's hearty and tasty. I subbed tri-color bell peppers for the tomatoes (I don't like them) in addition to the 3/4 cup included in the recipe. It's a great lunch for meal prep. I will definitely be making this again!

This was fantastic.  I tried to make it true to the recipe, but out of necessity, I had to make 2 changes.  Green olives instead of Calamata and regular balsamic because I didn't have white.  I'll buy both and make it again.  YuM!

Will definitely make this again. I used regular balsamic vinegar. It tasted great, but wasn't as 'pretty' because of the brown coloring. I didn't add the olives or the capers as we're not fans. I, too, mixed the dressing and poured over the veggies to get a better blend. I think you could also use mozzarella pearls or chunks of mozzarella instead of the feta in case you have folks we aren't feta fans.

This was a great dish.  Had leftovers for lunch with lettuce and a little greek dressing.  Mixed dressing separately as recommended.

I didn't make any changes however did not have white balsamic so I used the regular dark one -- the only negative was that the color of the salad became darker but it was still very tasty.  Great crunch and flavor!

I made this for a cook out and got rave reviews from everyone.  I substituted 1/2 the zucchini with cauliflower and used lemon flavored white balsamic. I will make this again.

I combined the veggies and cheese and served on top a bed of lettuce as a dinner salad.  I replaced the olive oil with lemon greek yogurt and a bit of mayo added the vinegar and spices and thinned a bit to use as a dressing.  Very refreshing
