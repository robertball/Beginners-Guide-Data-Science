Looks good, but I am not into 'double cooking' foods anymore...first deep fry then bake. Too  long to cook and too many dishes to wash. I'm just being honest.

Well, I thought I made this recipe to a T but it turns out I completely overlooked one ingredient which was the maple syrup. Kinda hard to rate this recipe now because my original thought was that these were just way too spicy but clearly they wouldn't have been if I would have used a cup and a half of maple syrup. Problem is there that I think they would have been too sweet for my liking if I wouldn't have overlooked that step. I'm going with a 4 and all I can say on that note is use your judgement on the hot sauce syrup ratio. We enjoyed the rub that went on these prior to frying and I will make again.

I made these wings as close to the recipe as I could. I made a few slight substitutions that should not make much difference in the taste: could not find Sazon so I found a recipe for it on this site; used smoked paprika as that was what I had on hand.

Despite the generous use of Cayenne, the wings were not very spicy which could be a plus for some people. The predominant flavor was the chili powder. 

The reason for my 3-star rating is the baking step to finish them. I will make them again and omit this step. After frying, the wings are actually done. And they come out very crispy which is a plus for me. Since they have been covered in the Rub (overnight in my case) and then floured and deep fried, they should be quite tasty without the baking step. Dipping them in the sauce makes them soggy and the 20-minute baking step did not return their crispiness. 

If you plan to finish them by baking, I recommend you use a wire rack on the baking sheet to keep them from sitting in the sauce and whatever additional grease that cooks out of them.

One final note: the amount of sauce made with this recipe is far more than what is needed since you don't use it after the baking step. You can make 1/3 as much and save throwing so much away.

If I make these again and omit the baking step, I will update my review.

Instead of deep frying, I baked them,  on 200, for 1 hr, then broiled them. I eliminated the flour. They were  delicious!!!

Awesome recipe! It may seem like a big process for wings, but believe me, it is so worth it! I didn't have any sazon seasoning so I made a copycat recipe. I was going to post a pic but they were gone too quick. Nothing but a pile of bones. Will be our go to wing recipe.

This went over great in our house, with a couple changes.  The wife liked that they were crunchy and not too spicy.  Kids ate them up as well (without sauce).  I bumped up the spice for my half of the sauce b/c I like 'em HOT.   I omitted the syrup and didn't bake mine.  I followed the rest of the directions, but served them right after tossing in sauce.  Really good flavor and an easy recipe to follow.  Will definitely add this to our rotation.

Five stars all the way. I doubled the wings and the ingredients. Followed it to the tee. Let's just say out all of the wings I cooked, I only got two. SWEET HEAT!! I don't make my wings any other way.

Made these wings for dinner last night and let's just say, there are no more left. We made 50 wings and everybody loved them. These are officially my family's new favorite wing recipe. Followed the recipe to a T, well with the exception of the chili powder, we substituted it with chipotle chili powder because we ran out of regular chili powder, plus the chipotle gave it a little more kick, which my family loves. All in all, this is probably the best recipe out there for wings, we will definitely be making these again...
