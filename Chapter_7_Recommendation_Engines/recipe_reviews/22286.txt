Very good recipe!  Even my children liked it!  I made the beef in my crockpot and let it go all day.
I used torn flour tortillas insteed if the corn tortillas and layered them in a 13x9 inch pan with 1/2 the sour cream mixture, 1/2 the beef, another layer of torn tortillas, and then repeated all layers.  Topped off the last layer of tortillas with 2 Cups of cheese.  The casserole approach saved time, and it was easier to dish up smaller portions for the kids.

I can't count the number of times I've made just the shredded beef portion (Step 1) of this recipe -- it's wonderfully tasty!  I add the onions and green peppers to the meat while it is simmering, together with an 8-ounce can of La Costena home style Mexican hot sauce for extra zest.  I always double the quantities for the sauce, too, because the tortillas soak up so much - and the flavor is so great, it's good to have extra.  Try keeping some extra shredded beef in the sauce in the freezer for last-minute dinners.  What a time-saver!

I'm going to give this a 4 stars for the meat. I seared the roast in some bacon drippings on it's own. I also added 1 can Rotel cilantro/lime tomatoes and a couple of smoked Chipotle chilies to braising ingredients. Once tender, shredded and then chopped coarsely. I didn't bother w/separate grn chili/sour crm/cheese sauce as I don't care for s.cream in the filling. Instead, I put the prepared beef in a bowl adding the grn chilies along with some of the cooking juice. At this point I store in fridge until next day. When I was ready to assemble I veered off from this recipe and finished up in my own style. I really like the shredded beef even if I added a couple ingredients. By cooking the meat a day ahead, I find making any style enchiladas that much easier.

The best Enchiladas recipe I have ever tried! Wonderful!

To reduce effort, cook the pot roast in a crock pot for 4 hours on high with the beef broth, red wine vinegar, chili powder, and ground cumin as instructed (or cook about 2  to 2 1/2 hours on the stove top on low in a heavy covered pot until the roast is ready to fall apart). 

Skim fat from leftover broth because we want to take care of our hearts.

Prepare as instructed in the original recipe.

I really liked these enchiladas.  I didn't find them to be that time consuming, but I started with having some shredded beef and looking for a way to cook it, so I didn't spend time on that.  Next time, I'll start from the beginning because my meat was not prepared according to the recipe, and it sounds really good! I changed a fewv things.  I used non-fat flour tortillas, as that's all I had.  I didn't use oil, but I made some enchilada sauce from this site called 10 minute enchilada sauce. Instead of the oil, I poured some sauce in the pan and covered both sides of the tortilla with the sauce.  Then I followed the recipe with the cheese sauce and the meat.  I only had low fat sour cream, and it was fine.  Also, I didn't have any onions, so they were left out.  Anyway, I poured the left over sauce on top and covered it with cheese.  I'm not sure how much, and it wasn't the kind called for in the recipe.  It was a combination of grated mexican cheese, mozarella, and some irish cheese.  (Can you tell I was cleaning out the fridge?)  Anyway, it was absoultely great!!!!!  Next time, I'll shop for the recipe and do it right. Edited to add:  I made this again.  I put all the ingredients for the beef in a crockpot for 8 hours on low.  The flavor of the meat is OUT OF THIS WORLD!  I found myself eating the meat as I rolled the enchiladas and there is none left over! YUM! One more thing, I ran out of cheese sauce before I ran out of meat, so I would double the cheese sauce.

I agree with a number of other reviewers that while the meat itself is really quite good - tender, juicy and flavorful, the enchiladas themselves were disappointing.  I had higher hopes for this than was delivered. First of all, after reading through the recipe I knew this would be dry without some kind of sauce, so I poured green enchilada sauce over them before topping with the cheese and baking. It helped somewhat, but this was still a mediocre dish, tasting more of the corn tortillas than anything else. (I've now determined that flour tortillas are definitely better than corn tortillas!) One reviewer said it best when she said these were "edible and forgettable,"  and another who remarked that the meat was great...just not in these enchiladas.

Oh my....this was absoultely DELICIOUS!!!  I can't tell you Christy how much we enjoyed this meat.  I used about 2-1/2 lbs of beef stew meat.  I left out the water and mixed the beef broth, vinegar and spices in my crockpot and then added the beef.  I let that cook on HIGH for about 8 hours.  I chopped up 1 large white onion, 4 garlic cloves and a red bell pepper and sauteed it in a large pot until soft and then transfered the meat from the crockpot.  I added a 4 oz can of chopped green chilies and turned the heat on med-hi and let most of the liquid boil off and ended up with the most tender and flavorful shredded beef I've ever made.  I did have to add quite a bit of salt to achieve the right taste (we love salt).  I skipped the sour cream and rather than making enchiladas, I let everyone assemble burritos with flour tortillas.  I made my own pico de gallo to go along with this and grated some fresh pepper-jack cheese.  I will definitley use this again and plan on passing this recipe along to others.  Thanks a million!!!

I made this for a party and everyone asked for the recipe.  Delicious.  I made it exactly as written except that I poured Red Enchilada Sauce (recipe on this site) over the top before sprinkling the cheese and baked.  A bit time consuming but worth the effort.

EXCELLENT!  This did take a little extra time, but so worth it!  I added a little red enchilada sauce over the top before putting in the oven.
This recipe is worth making extra and freezing for later use.  Thanks Christy!

I cut this recipe in half, using a 1.5 pound roast that I bought on clearance. I braised the roast in hot oil on all sides, first rubbing the roast with garlic powder, onion powder, fresh ground pepper and sea salt. After braising, I put the roast in my crockpot over a layer of sliced yellow onions. I added the beef broth (I used Campbell's double-strength beef broth), the red wine vinegar, CALIFORNIA ground chili powder (you get the flavor of the chili powder with half the heat) and the cumin. I also added a tablespoon of oregano. I cooked it on low all day until it was falling apart. When I made the sauce, I browned the onion with a mess of minced garlic in a tablespoon each of butter/EVOO, then added the flour. I did add more spices to the sauce (a teaspoon each of cumin, coriander, paprika, oregano, california chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder) and I used reduced fat sour cream. I did not fry my corn tortillas, I just warmed them in a non-stick skillet and it worked just fine. I only used one half of a can of green chili peppers only because I was feeding kids and a whole can is just too hot for them. I got seven full "enchiladas" out of a half recipe. Right before baking, I sprinkled the top with fresh chopped cilantro. My boys INHALED this. They thought it was great, even my littlest! No leftovers. I think it's a good recipe as is but adding the extra spices really made it shine. NOTE: I saved the "juice" from the meat for taco soup I'll make at a later date.

Excellent!  A lot of time to make, but worth it.  I made a few changes, but doesn't everybody?  Probably biggest change was to cook the beef all day in a crock pot with a layer of sliced onions on the bottom and can of Rotel poured on top.  I then chopped those onions and added to the shredded beef mixture.  Like others, I also made the "Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce" to use with this recipe.  To cut down on the grease, I skipped frying the tortillas in oil.  Instead, I dipped them in the enchilada sauce, coating both sides, before filling and rolling.

My husband HATES enchiladas. That being said..I love them and wanted to make them again. This recipe does not disappoint. I made the beef the night before in my crockpot (I added some cayenne pepper to taste) and used all of the liquids it calls for except for the water, and added a can of Rotel that contained tomatoes and chiles. I cooked it on high for about 6 hours then pulled the beef out and shredded it in a bowl. I poured the extra liquid into a bowl for later use. The next day I made the sour cream mixture (minus one can of chiles because I had some in the beef, and minus the flour - it didn't need it). I tried one corn tortilla dipped in oil and it was pretty gross looking so instead I heated 5 tortillas at a time in the microwave with a damp paper towel on top and one on the bottom to lock in moisture. They weren't mushy at all when the dish was done. I then put the sour cream mixture down and placed the beef on top. I wrapped them tightly and placed them into a baking dish. I didn't add enchilada sauce because it did not call for it. Instead, I used the reserved liquid and added a small spoonful to the top of each one to prevent drying. I then added the shredded cheese to the top and baked. It took about 15-20 minutes so make sure you check them. These are excellent, even my picky husband loves them. I will be making these again and again. I agree that this meat would be excellent for tacos. If you really like enchilada sauce it would be great with this recipe too.

I want to compliment Christy for submitting this superb recipe. We are Hispanic and although I have make my enchiladas differently in the past, I have to admit that this recipe is superior to my own, and to all others I have tried! I plan to use this recipe from now on, it was so divine. I especially love the first part of the recipe for cooking the chuck roast. Pairing the meat with red wine vinegar, chili powder and cumin give it a delectable flavor. I plan on using this same method for other dishes, like burritos, in the future. I also used the food processor to shred the meat in finer, uniform shreds after it was cooked and cooled - it seemed to "stretch" the portion size. I used Mrs. Espy's Enchilada Sauce from this site to top the enchiladas, substituting chicken broth instead of water, and adding garlic powder, a pinch of powdered coriander, and Mexican oregano to the enchilada sauce to give it that authentic Southwest flavor. I sprinkled the remaining monterey jack cheese on top of the sauce and baked as directed. I garnished with black olives and cilantr. So colorful. Rave compliments from the whole family.

This recipe is delicious.  I made the beef in the crock-pot. (8 hrs)  I layered the ingredients rather than roll up the tortillas.  I made the beef portion again for tacos two weeks later, they were amazing.

Yum delish.  The cheese sauce inside is fabulous. I cooked the meat in the Red Enchilada sauce from this site.  Also dipped the tortillas in hot oil for 30 seconds, then in the enchilada sauce.  When the tortillas fell apart, I abandoned the idea of beautiful rolled enchiladas and made chiliquilas instead.  Hey, not a bad trade off! Perfect blend of spicy/cheese/creamy. This was FABULOUS! Better than any other enchilada recipe I've made or made up in the past 30 years.  Did add about 1/2 cup of Velveeta to the sauce and quite a bit more cheese. Made a cheese only for my vegetarian son, strewing the layers with cheese.  Great, great, great.

I gathered all of the ingredients to make this recipe exactly as listed.  I placed the meat and spices in the crock pot until it came apart easily with a fork.  I tasted the meat and it was very bland.  I did not continue preparing the enchiladas because the meat did not taste good.  It smelled really good but was flavorless.

The meat and cheese mixture is VERY good.  I read some reviews and did the crockpot for 8 hours with the broth, meat, cumin and chili powder.  It was wonderful. I only have it four starts because it REALLY needs a red sauce.  Will make it again for sure but with sauce for sure next time.

EXCELLENT!  I agree with Christy ~ "time-consuming, but worth it"  These had EXACTLY the flavor I was craving.  Flavorful but not overpowering.  The tortillas did not turn to mush like they did with another recipe I tried.  Shredded beef makes ALL the difference compared to ground beef.  I did use mild cheddar instead of Monterrey Jack cheese because that's what I had on hand.  I'm sure they would have been even better with the jack cheese.  Thanks for sharing a GREAT recipe.

Made in crockpot, because dh didn't think would fit in saucepan. Realized later it prb could have. Didn't have enough flavor for me, maybe because I left liquid in. But kids loved it and ate it up. So will try again, and specifically follow recipe.

My tip is I buy sirlion tip roast when it is a BOGO. I slow cook both roasts overnight in a simple beef broth until fall-apart tender. Freeze in freezer baggies for recipes just like this one. Just add your seasonings. Big budget and time saver. These enchiladas are wonderful!

Delicious meat for tacos, enichildadas or taco salads. Add a little brown sugar for the kids and it will be gone before you can ask for seconds!

I would give this 10 stars if I could... 5 for the beef itself, 5 for the end result. Wow, what great flavor. I've never fried my tortillas when making enchiladas at home just to try to save some calories, but seriously, I will never do it any other way after eating these. Absolutely delicious. The sour cream/cheese filling really sealed the deal. The only things I changed were to omit the onions and I had to use flour tortillas as my local store didn't have corn ones, oddly. I also topped with enchilada sauce before adding the cheese. Just perfect, I'll be making these (and the beef itself) often. Thank you!

This was a really good recipe.  I made one batch exactly as the recipe states.  On the next batch, I covered the top of the enchiladas with the remaining cheese mixture and added enchilada sauce.  Very yummy!  I think the next time we will try adding tomatillo sauce instead of the enchilada sauce.  Also, definitely cook the roast in a crock pot - the meat shreds itself!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I do know my Mexican food being from South Texas, and this recipe is definately a keeper.  I have to agree with a prior comment that it's okay to tweak a recipe, but to revamp the whole thing?  Well, just come up with your own idea make it your way I say.  I like the fact that there is no sauce on top of these.  Honestly, it doesn't need all the extra layers of flavor.  The only thing I changed was I used only a couple of tablespoons of filling (instead of 4) for 6 inch tortillas.  Otherwise, it's too much to fold.  Also, I only baked them for 20 minutes, and the tortillas came out nicely golden brown and the cheese was perfectly melted on top without being dried out.  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my gosh! The best Enchilada recipe I  have ever made! Had this for Christmas Dinner and let me tell you, this is the most Authentic Mexican Beef Enchiladas I have ever eaten. The only thing I did different was I put my roast into the crock pot overnight and cooked it until it feel apart, then drained it and shredded the beef.  By far the best Enchiladas I  have ever eaten even in a restaurant!!! Bravo Bravo Bravo!!!! My lifetime recipe here! Thanks for the submitting of it!!

We LOVE this recipe! Great flavor and well worth the additional kitchen time. We also utilized our crock pot as Tammy did and let the beef cook while at work. Just fantastic! Wish I could give you more stars!!!!

This is a great recipe. I noticed that a lot of reviewers were making or buying enchilada sauce to smother these with. It isn't really necessary when all you have to do is drain and  thicken the juices that were leftover from cooking the meat like you would for a thin gravy. I did stir in another 1/2 teaspoon chili powder and 1/2 teaspoon cumin  to the sauce as I was thickening it and it was so much better than a canned enchilada sauce.

My husband **RAVED** about these!  He thought that they were restaurant-quality and then some.   I made 2 changes: 1) I cooked the meat in a pressure cooker (20 min, 15lbs pressure) and 2) I used sharp cheddar cheese as that is what we like.  GREAT!

Very Good. The only thing I did differently was I used stew meat and browned it on all sides. After adding all spices and liquid, I finished it off in the oven for two hours. Very tender and flavorful.

Can't wait to make this again for my own family!  I made this for my son's football coaches for a between-practice-and-board meeting dinner, and they devoured it and raved how wonderful it was!  I'd give it 5 stars, but for the fact that when I tried to fry the corn tortillas in oil for 30 seconds they became crispy.  I learned quickly you have to dip and flip them very quickly.  Otherwise, excellent receipe!

Yummy,I wish I could give this recipe 5 stars,but I made changes to it as I figure these would have turned out too dry without sauce on top etc.I made 1/2 with corn and 1/2 with flour.I liked the taste of the corn ones better.The preparation was a breeze.I used chuck roast/pot roast.I followed the recipe on how to brown the meat and instead of letting the meat simmer for hours,I put it in the slow cooker in the morning.I used a cup of beef broth and half cup of canned French onion soup.I didn't have to shred it as it shred itself! it simply fell apart.I added green onions to the sour cream/cheese/onion mixture in addition to the regular onion.Then instead of using oil (yuck!)to dip the tortillas,I put green enchilada sauce on a dinner plate and passed the tortillas through it to moist them.I placed the tortillas right in the pan and filled them up one by one in there and placed them seam down. I drizzled red and green enchilada sauce over them (no too wet) just enough to cover and soften them up and then put a cup of cheese,  sliced black olives and a few more green onions on top.I left the pan on the counter until I gather the ingredients to make some some corn and cilantro rice to allow them to soften even more as I used corn tortillas.Then I just put these in the oven until hot and bubbly.I didn't leave it there for the whole 30 min. as these might have dry out.Even my picky son went back for secs.We really liked this dish!! I am getting hungry again :) Thanks for sharing!

These enchilada have been a hit at two big events. As a timesaver, I just throw the roast in a crockpot with broth and spices and I also add 1 (7oz) can of chiles. By the time I get home the roast is done and I spend about an hour putting everything together.

This is the best recipe ever for shredded beef enchiladas! I'm even going to cook and season my beef roasts this way in the future. Since I ran out of cheese, I poured the extra sauce over the enchiladas...Yummy!

These were very good, but time consuming.  I made the red enchilada sauce from this site to go with.  I dipped my tortillas in the sauce instead of softening them in oil.  Then I poured the remainder sauce all over the top of the enchiladas and sprinkled the cheese.  I used a leftover brisket I had, shredded it and combined it with some ground beef.  Will make again!

My hubby ranked this a 5 but, I overrule.  LOL!  It was good and will make again.  Put chopped lettuce on the plate, added a couple enchiladas and topped with a bit more sour cream and chopped cilantro.  He finally thought he was at a restaurant!

This was good. I followed the directions pretty much to the letter. I poured a can of red enchilada sauce over the top before I cooked it in the oven. The result was ok, I just feel like its missing something to give it that pop.

These were very tasty. I used leftover roast, so it didn't take as long to cook. We will definately make these again, but will double the sauce it's cooked it and then thicken it up, maybe add some tomato sauce to get the red sauce to go on top.

THe flavor of this meat was delicious!  I did the roast in the crock pot and added 2 cloves of garlic in addition.  I used flour tortillas instead of corn so I wouldn't have to dip in oil.  Family loved it, will definately make again!

This was soooo good!  And, yes, it's a fairly long time from start to finish, but most of the time the roast is simmering in the pot so it's not like you are busy preparing this dish for hours.  The meat was amazing!   And the sour cream/cheese mixture was delicious too.  I did change it  up a little by using flour tortillas that I did not soften in the oil.  I also added a half can of drained black beans to the cheese/ sour cream mix and I used a couple of cans of Enchilada sauce.  I poured a little sauce in the bottom of the baking dish, then added the enchiladas then poured the remaining enchilada sauce over everything before topping with cheese.  REALLY great recipe - as good or better than any enchilada/ burrito I've had in any Mexican restaurant.

SUPERB! Everyone (did you hear me? I said EVERYONE) in the house said this was a five star recipe! It was super easy and delicious... although I must admit, I had my doubts at first. My 16 year old even asked if she could make them again, by herself, the very next night. I made mine with chicken, but did it exactly the same way as the recipe calls for with beef.

Graet alternative to ground beef and tasted great...I added cilantro and olives to the mixture and used enchilada sauce to coat the pan and top put ontop.  Making these for the 2nd Oregon Duck game in a row...friends LOVED them last week.

I have to say that these are by far the BEST enchiladas that I have ever eaten... to include those I have eaten at authentic mexican restaraunts!  My whole family devours them... including my SUPER picky husband.  I have to make an extra pan just so I can have left-overs.
     I only made a couple of minor changes/additions:
  Generally I love corn tortillas and prefer them, however, with this recipe they seem to somewhat overwhelm the taste of the ingredients.  It may be because I am pregnant and my tastes are a little skewed, but I tried using flour tortillas and much prefer them in this recipe.  I also added chopped fresh tomatoes to the filling and topped the "Whole Enchilada"  :0) with a little green enchilada sauce and fresh tomatoes.  You simply must try this recipe.  It so incredibly easy to make for the superior quality product you receive in return.  I LOVE IT!

This recipe need not be overly time consuming.  I use it for left over pot roast.  Just add the water and spices to your leftover pot roast and simmer for an hour or so, then make as usual.  Also, we use the uncooked flour tortillas (cook them first of course) and it makes this restaurant quality!  My husband adores these and it's a great way to use up leftover roast.

This was really good...a definite keeper! I ended up doing it quite different than instructed but still used the same ingredients. I didnt have enough tortillas so I decided to just layer it all. I put the meat, liquids, seasonings and onion in the crockpot and cooked it all day. Then I shredded the meat once it cooled. I mixed together the meat, sour cream, shredded cheese, and chiles (omitted the flour). Sprayed the baking dish with cooking spray and did a layer of tortillas (skipped the frying process) then the meat mixture and repeated. I poured a can of enchilada sauce over it and baked for 30 minutes. My whole family loved it!

This recipe was GREAT...I bet it would be equally delicious with either chicken or pork.  My husband was thrilled, as he is quite picky!!   Thank you.

These were very good.  I loved the meat, and thought the sauce was great.  I smothered them with the Red Sauce from this site.  I am only giving this recipe 4 stars because these enchiladas were a lot of work.  Fortunately the recipe makes enough that I was able to divide it up into 3 portions, and have two pans in the freezer!

I give this recipe 5 stars just for the beef part, really good.  I didn't care for the sourcream mixture that much, but my teens(and their friends)loved it. The whole pan disapeared in record time! I will definately make it again with just the beef mixture, it really is good enough to stand on it's own as the filling.  That way each person can put sourcream on top if they want it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this recipe last night and oh my gosh! They tasted like restaurant quality ( even better than most Mexican restaurants here in Ga.)  My 23 year old son ate 5 of them and my husband had 3!  I like to try the recipes as they are written and this one is awesome. I do prefer a bit more sauce so next time I will double that, but no other changes needed to this recipe. I will be making this many more times in the future!

I'm giving a 4/5 because even though it is AMAZING it takes more like 3.5 hours.  I had help with this stuff, all the time consuming work, and it still took three and a half hours.

The beef is absolutely to die for!  I followed the suggestions to let the beef cook in a crock pot for 8 hours.  It was perfect!  I am making them again tonight! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I agree that the enchiladas need a red sauce.

This was a hit, but I had a hard time with the cook time of the meat.  The 2 hours didn't cut it.  I ended up eating something else that night, putting the whole cast iron pot with a giant chunk of meat in it in the oven on 200 all night long.  It was perfect in the morning!  Also, I didn't have enough sour cream, so I subbed a can of cream of mushroom soup for 1/2 of it.  I also poured a can of enchilada sauce over for good measure.  Everyone loved it...hubby, 5 year old, and grandma! :)

This one is hard for me to rate...as I give the meat filling a 5and the rest a 3.....so averages out to a 4. Will make the meat part again though.I did it in the crock pot so it was not dry.It does not have any enchilada sauce on it. The one I prefer from this site is Authentic Dried Chile-Pepito Enchilada Sauce

Disappointed...  I'm not usually a picky eater, but I found these to be very boring.  The meat was good but not great.  As is, the recipe needs more flavor and sauce on top.  I'll look for another recipe instead.

I'm not a beef fan, but even I couldn't resist these.  The beef was so tender and flavorful.  I used them as a base in a different enchilada recipe, but the beef alone is worth five stars.  My meat loving husband also raved about this meal.

We liked this very much.  I used a red enchilada sauce and baked them in the oven.  They came out well.  I had put all of the ingredients for the meat (chilies, meat, broth, etc) in the crock pot and just shredded the meat, refrigerated overnight and made the next day.  Easy and good!

We loved the receipe, but thought the beef needed a little more spice. We added a package of taco seasoning to the beef after we shredded it. We liked it much better. Tomitillo sauce is also really good on these enchiladas.

this was a pretty good recipe actually if you are a bit on the mild side of spices   So I added a store bought package of taco seasoning and it turned out to be just the right amount of spice for us. In stead of cooking it all day long on the stove or in the slow cooker, I threw the meat and spices in the pressure cooker and it turned out extremely tender and delicious.   I also made our own enchilada sauce and topped it with the cheese.  I really thought these were very good. this is definitely a keeper.  thanks.

This review is for the beef portion only.  I omitted the water and mixed all the other ingredients for the beef and cooked it all day in the crockpot.  It turned out really tasty and tender.  We used it for shredded beef burritos, quesadillas and nachos.

I have changed up the recipe a bit and used the canned enchilada sauce in the crockpot with the meat. I still added the sourcream and onion to the enchiladas and used cheddar cheese instead.  I also did not fry the tortillas but used the warm sauce to make them pliable saving some fat and grease. I have made this version of the recipe twice,  the first time I froze half. The second time my husband loved it so much it never made it to the freezer, he ate the whole thing.

This recipe was awesome!!! I nixed the sour cream sauce because my father-in-law is picky picky, but the recipe for the beef was worth the entire thing!!!! I left my chuck roast in the beef broth mixture in a crockpot for about 7 hours on low, and it came out perfectly tender and shreddable. My corn tortillas didn't want to roll (they actually wanted to break) so I ended up doing a casserole-style dish, that tasted wonderful. I have leftover beef, which I think would work perfectly for a homemade taco salad, or some such. This will definitely be a family favorite!!

I made these last night and even though they weren't bad I was a little disapointed.  I followed the recipe and didnt' change anything.  Next time I will definatly cook the meat in a slow cooker all day so it comes out a little softer.  They also need enchilada sauce on top of them or something they were a little plain.

SOOOO GOOD! I followed the recipe for the meat to the T and had to bat off the family while I shredded. Really yummy. We did decide against the sour cream/cheese sauce though, and just stuck to cheese inside, enchilada sauce and more cheese on top. Couldn't bring myself to dip the tortillas in the oil, so I used other reviewers tips about using the enchilada sauce instead. Worked just fine. My hubby is latino, and we grew up in Cali...so I wasn't expecting him to go nuts, but he did! Said they were better than our fave Mexican place back home! :) Yess!

Haven't made these yet but plan on it real soon.My husband prefers beef over chicken so these look like the ones to try.It looks like the "beef version" of Angelas Awesome Enchiladas (on this site).If you like chicken enchiladas, you will LOVE these. Happy Thanksgiving to all!!

This recipe is fantastic! The shredded beef adds authenticity and great texture; way better than the standard ground beef recipes I've seen. I dumped a some canned enchilada sauce on top before adding the shredded cheese. AMAZING! thanks for the great recipe.

UPDATE: With the sauce recipe on this page: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Enchilada-Sauce-2/Detail.aspx this enchilada recipe can't be beat. hands down best enchiladas you've ever had. :)

I'm only giving this recipe a 4, but it has potential to be 5+.  I halved the recipe, but followed the instructions as written.  The beef didn't turn out great.  I think there was potential for great flavor there, but it cooked way too fast on the stove and was overdone and hard to shred.  The next time I make this, I will do the beef in a crockpot on low for 6 to 8 hrs and then shred.   I also think that it's too time consuming, messy, and unnecessary to fry the corn tortillas in oil - I will make casserole style next time and layer the tortillas, cheese sauce and beef.  I also will add some jarred enchilada sauce to pour on top.   The cheese sauce is fantastic as written - creamy and flavorful, it adds a lot to this dish.   Black olives would be a nice addition too.

This really took a long time to prepare and it just wasn't that great.  We are from Texas and found it to be "blah".  Needed a "kick".  My husband thought it needed carne asada sauce on top.  I was bummed.

Let me first say that the meat in this dish is DIVINE!!!  I absolutely will use the meat portion of the recipe again and again (and not just for these enchiladas!).  As for the sour cream cheese sauce, I was pleasantly surprised!  I've kind of had "red sauce burnout" for some time.  I have been trying to appease my family with dishes that they will love without acid issues for myself.  I had failed until I found this recipe.  Everyone...my hubby, my mom, both girls (8 & 2) and myself LOVED these!  I used flour instead of corn tortillas...everything else was the same.  We will be having these again, for sure!!!  Thanks for posting!!!

Great meal!  My hubby loved it and he is from New Mexico and the son of a great mexican food cook.  I used the 10 min enchilada sauce and cooked my roast in the crock pot which worked really well.  The meat also freezes well for another meal later.

These were unbelievably good and worth the work! Used slow cooker, baked in two pans-one with just cheese, the other with red echilada sauce and cheese. Won't be dry if you use juice from meat. Only baked 20 min. Thank you so much. Will use these for company and have copies ready!

The only reason that I'm giving them two stars instead of one is because the meat portion of this recipe is very tasty.  I do not recommend this recipe as written, but the beef would be great in tacos.  I think that I will try that next time.  This recipe makes WAY TOO MUCH CHEESE SAUCE!  The taste of the chiles is overwhelming!

This was great, my wife and I made this today, she said it tastes like something you'd get in an authentic mexican restaraunt, I'd have to agree with her. It is fairly time consuming, but worth it. I think next time I might cook the meat in a crock pot to make it a little more tender and save a little prep time.

This was very good. I did my meat in the crockpot to not heat up the kitchen so much. It's not necessary to roll enchiladas,so I made them flat (like lasagna). This helps with the prep time and they taste exactly the same.

Don't you hate it when people review a recipe, only to list  the myriad ways they altered it?  IMHO, that isn't reviewing the recipe at all.  That said, the ONE change I made was to pour some red enchilada sauce (out of the can) on top of the enchiladas, then bake them.  I also covered them, and baked them a little longer than 30 mins.  For some reason, they were getting very dried-out looking (even though they were covered with sauce).  The result was fabulous.

Cooking the meat this way means you start earlier in the day - or the day before.  However, you can do all these steps at any time of the day.  I really enjoyed that, and didn't find it a liability.

A previous reviewer suggested using the food processor to shred the beef.  Great idea.

The hot oil method works well for making flexible corn tortillas.  I didn't break a single one.

A wonderful recipe I will be using hereafter.

The method of cooking meat this way made my meat tender in less than 2 hours.  Although the sauce was average; I used balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar, which I thought was good, the chili powder was overwhelming and the sauce lacked something...maybe lime/lemon juice to break up the flavor and would add complexity.  I didn't find the flavor to be authentic, but it was worth exploring because it's simple to put together.

I have made this recipe countless times since finding it over a year ago. Every time I make it for somebody new they think Im some kinda culinary genius and always ask for the recipe. Once I was out of red wine vinegar and used balsamic instead. I have never gone back to red wine vineager since. Yum!!!

Very good!  Cooked the beef with spices
overnight in the crock pot, used flour
tortillas, Sara's Red Enchilada sauce,
and Pepper Jack Cheese for some extra 'heat'.  I think they would have dried out pretty badly without the enchilada sauce.

This recipe is so good, my family just loved it!  It was a bit time-consuming.  I'll most definately make it again.  In fact, I'm making it again tomorrow.  I put my roast, beef broth, vinegar, chili powder and cumin in the slow cooker and cooked it overnight and it was so tender and assembled the enchiladas the next day.  Thanks-a-bunch for such a great recipe!!

I would like to know if anyone else had the same problem I had by following the recipe exactly. I bought a 3.10 pound chuck roast and cooked it EXACTLY the way is says in the recipe, but I ended up with a piece of shoe leather. It was anything but tender. It smelled and tasted good, but it was impossible to shred. I had to use a knife to cut it into VERY thin strips to make it edible without spending 20min each bite chewing. The taste was great, just not tender. I will try making it again, but I will use a crock pot next time.

I made the meat in the crock pot instead like some of the reviews said to do and the meat came out absolutely incredible! I was eating it before I even got around to assembling the enchiladas. I'm giving it only 3 stars because once I made the enchiladas I did not like them at all. What I couldn't get past was the sour cream mixture. I followed the recipe but it just didn't work for us. Im keeping it because of the meat recipe but wont be making the enchilada sauce.

This was VERY delicious! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because to me, an enchilada just isn't an enchilada with some sort of sauce draped over the top. So after I wrapped my tortillas up in their meat and cheese sauce goodness, and laid them all out in the casserole dish, I poured a can of red enchilada sauce all over them, and then baked them. The cheese sauce inside is incredible! I love using roasted hatch chilies, and was even short on sour cream so subbed 1 cup of plain greek yogurt. It's a time consuming recipe, but very worth it!

The enchiladas were amazing! I coated the beef with most of the seasonings and then browned it, before adding the wine and broth. (didn't add water) The meat was very flavorful, moist, and everyone loved the enchiladas.

Needed red sauce.  I put taco seasoning (recipe from this site) all around the meat and seared, then added to slow cooker along with onion, beef broth, green chili, cumin, chilli powder, and one clove garlic (sauteed).  I added canned jalapenos to some of the enchiladas, next time I will use fresh.  The meat was very good.  Made the full recipe - had enough for two full pans of enchiladas - made 1 pan and am saving the rest for tacos.

This is delicious!!!  I will say though that I can't get the proportions to reconcile between the meat and the sour cream filling (which is the crux of this recipe). I just make it anyway and find a way to use any leftover fillings later. So good, but an all day affair for sure. I make them less than I do my simple chicken enchiladas, but when I make this, it's like restaurant quality and a real treat!

Great recipe but 30 seconds per tortilla is way to long they are not pliable it is more like 10 to 15 seconds per side. In addition I added a can of salsa verde instead of the green chiles a little more complex.

I did not care for this recipe, though i used pre shredded beef from Costco.  The sauce was bland and dry.

I would call these beef flautas, rather than enchiladas, but whatever you call them, they are delicious!

Seriously yummy.  I don't like a tremendous amount of heat, so I thought the spice level was perfect for me and my family.  I can see where others have increased the spice to taste.  I took someone else's suggestion on using the reserved liquid over the top before the cheese so they would not be dry.  In fact, what I did was to take the reserved liquid and add mini can of V8 ( a small can of tomato sauce or some tomato paste would work too) and then I thickened it with some Wondra flour.  This made a tasty Red Enchilada sauce which I spooned over top of the dish before sprinkling the cheese.   My whole family raved and asked for seconds.

Very good!  A great make-ahead dinner to eat on Sunday after church.  I make it as directed but use the half flour and half corn tortillas, I forget the brand or what they are called, or just flour tortillas.

This is delicious for the entire family. It is however time consuming but I actually made the beef a day ahead & kept it with the juice in the fridge & did the rest the next day. I did put in less onion & chile peppers than it called for because of the kids. If it were just adults I would not have changed a thing. Delicious.

I rated these five stars because of the filling.  It was excellent! I do, however, think that enchiladas traditionally have a nice red sauce over them rather than the cheese sauce....although the cheese sauce DID also have a great taste.

I would give the filling 5 stars. 2 stars for the baking part enchiladas are supposed to have sauce over the top with cheese on the top like the picture. The recipe to me without sauce would be Taqutios. I did use the best red enchilada sauce as a reviewer suggested from this site and made 14 enchiladas I have enough filling to make another 14. They were 5 stars with a enchilada sauce! And made excellant taquitos too!

I've made these a few times for big family gatherings and they always get rave reviews.  The only change I've made is to pour a light amount of red encilada sauce over them prior to baking.  It makes them much moister.

Wow!  These are so good!  Made them last night and was told they were the BEST Enchiladas they'd ever eaten by my guest.  I have to say I agree.  I used The Best Enchilada Red Sauce Recipe to top them before adding the cheese and they were AMAZING!!  THank You!

I have never made the entire recipe.  I only make the meat.  It is great for everything from tacos, to enchiliadas, to adding it to rice and beans.  I use my crock pot to cook the beef.  Stir together  the broth, vinegar, chili powder and cumin (I don't use the water the recipe calls for).  Pour over beef and sliced onion and cook on high for 3-4 hours (depending on how fast your crock pot cooks) or 8-10 hours on low.  Take the meat out and let cool slightly.  Shred with forks and return to crockpot.  The shredded meat will adsorb more liquid.  The meat will freeze well.  Freeze with the extra liquid.

Very good.  Very time consuming though.  Would like to try just ground beef next time.  I did slow cook the beef all day, and it was very tender, but husband isnt keen on shredded beef.  That is why I may try it with just ground beef or even chicken.

The only part of the recipe I used was the sour cream/Monterey Jack sauce and I love it. Thanks for teaching this old dog a new trick for great enchiladas. I sauteed ground beef with onions and garlic. Then simmered that in enchilada sauce.  I used flour tortillas (I prefer corn, but husband likes flour so I did flour this time).  I topped the rolled enchiladas with more Jack cheese, some red enchilada sauce and added some cheddar.  They were great and the sour cream sauce is a wow!

We thought the sour cream/cheese sauce for this was kind of bland.  The meat was excellent!  I definatly will make the meat part of this recipe again in the future for tacos.  Next time I will add some fresh garlic and maybe some green pepper to it while its simmering.

Made this the other day, pretty good recipe for this type of enchiladas. And that says allot since I cook Tex Mex quite often. Make sure you go by the recipe and use only corn tortillas not flour. Enchiladas should never be made with flour tortillas. Now sit back and enjoy with a nice brewsky!!

I didnt fry the tortillas but they still turned out good. This recipie was missing some sort of sauce on top, so I made half of them with a verde salsa on top and half with black bean and corn salsa on top and they were yummy. We couldnt eat them all so I froze the leftovers and they reheat very well.

Instead of putting the tortillas in oil I dipped them in red enchilada sauce.  These were SO delicious. I will definately make these again!

Awesome!  I don't like sour cream so I added more cheese.  I also slow cooked the beef overnight which made it even better.  These are GREAT!!!

This was incredible!  Who cares about the time it takes to make...small price to pay for a delicious meal.  Great with either corn or flour tortillas.

I like others read all the reviews and added alot more spices.  A can of Rotel and a few spicy peppers.  I did not fry the shells and we used the low carb wheat shells.  I even made chicken the third time I made these.  We always have enough to freeze and they are great reheated.  Will continue to use this recipe.  We love Tex Mex food and by adding the extra spices it does the trick. Thanks :)

I made these in the morning and put them in the frig to cook later for dinner. I don't recommend doing it this way. This is a great recipe, but I find it is best to make them fresh and eat them right away. I loved the meat mixture, in fact I am making just that part of the recipe today to turn into burritos.

These were good. Not dry at all(maybe it was because I topped it with enchilada sauce).

Made this last night using leftover pot roast.  Obviously, I had to change up the recipe since the meat was already cooked. I don't want to take anything away from the recipe because I would definitely make this again the way it's written. Here's what I did in case you need a good use for leftovers:  Skipped the H2O, broth and vinegar since the meat was already cooked.  Shredded the roast, and placed in a skillet with spices, onion & chile peppers (don't drain).  Heated it up and added the flour.  My roast was so darn fatty that I didn't really need much liquid.  Cooked & stirred a few more minutes.  Added sour cream & cheese and stirred until melted.  Placed mixture in CORN tortillas. (They really are better - just heat them up before you try to roll them.) Baked as directed but topped with a can of enchilada sauce (can't imagine enchiladas without sauce) and more cheese.  YUM!

This recipe was just alright to me it didn't seem to have much flavor or spice to it.  I am not one that likes alot of spice but for me personally I needed just a bit more.

This recipe is wonderful. I'm a huge mexican cusine lover, however my husband is a little more picky. I've had a hard time finding a recipe that is spicy enough for my taste that he still enjoys. This was certainly it. Even my daughter ate it up! I can't thank you enough for sharing this recipe! It is so hard to find a meal all three of us enjoy.

I really tweaked this recipe. First of all, I didn't use the chuck roast at all. I just used leftover taco ground beef. I made the sour cream/cheese sauce, but used a lime sour cream. I used shallots instead of onions and just regular cheddar cheese, and I definetely didn't fry my tortillas. After rolling them, I poured a homemade taco sauce over the top and then topped with more cheese. So I kinda used the recipe as a base, but I changed alot. My way was delicious! :)

I had to triple this recipe because I was catering a birthday party that was Mexican themed. This was one of 2 enchiladas that I served and it was gone first. I could not believe how amazing this was!! Because of the cost I had to substitute brisket for the roast and I really think that it probably turned out better for it. I put the brisket in a large roaster with all of the seasoning and liquids and cooked at 175 all night long. It was so tender it fell to pieces as I took it out. It is a little bit of work, but the best recipes usually don't have shortcuts, it is well worth the time. Don't try to cut out the frying of the tortillas, it really is paramount to the overall result of the dish. AMAZING!!

The meat is fantastic!  I used that part of th e recipe and then made chimis after it was shredded (rolled in flour tortillas, brushed with butter and baked).  I threw my roast with all the ingredients in the crock pot and it was ready when I came home.  I'll definitely use this over and over.

I made this with ground beef, seasoned with Taco Seasoning I from this site. The cream cheese mixture with the beef is excellent, however, with only cheese on top, it was a bit dry. We doctored it up by pouring some taco sauce on top and reheating. It looks like there is sauce on the recipe photo, however it is not included in the recipe. It would be a 5 star recipe with sauce added.

This was really yummy and tender.  I used chile verde sauce on the bottom of the pan and dipped white corn tortillas in it as well. I then added red enchilada sauce on top.

I fixed this recipe exactly as it is for my husband's birthday and we both loved it!!  I am not a very good cook; therefore, I have to follow recipes step by step, and this one was easy to follow. This meal has become one of my husbands favorites.  Thank you so very much.

Very tasty--for healthier version substitute plain (full fat or low fat)yogurt for the sour cream--it cooks up great w/ the onions and chilis and with all that cheese you don't notice.  Great recipe, a nice change from ground beef enchiladas at my house.

A keeper!  I actually got 8 enchiladas out of this rather than 20, but they are a tasty 8 none-the-less!  I did not fry the tortillas and don't miss it.  I also topped them with Red Enchilada Sauce before the cheese.  That I cannot recommend...but I will find another enchilada sauce and do this again!

This was a good recipe-even for the kids. I did change a few things, though. I used 2 freshly roasted and peeled poblano chiles. I used Chihuahua cheese and white corn tortillas. I added water as needed and never put it in the oven. The meat stayed very moist. Maybe not authentic but my husband and very picky brother-in-law(both from Mexico)gobbled up their food! Use a freshly made tomato salsa-cold. It really brightens up the flavors

These were awesome!  I normally make my enchiladas with ground beef, so this was a nice change.  My family loved them and they were even better the next day. I put my roast in the crockpot before I left for church and let it cook for most of the day.  I poured red enchilada sauce over the top and added some more cheese.  These work great with black beans and mexican rice.  This is DEFINITELY a keeper!

This was great!  Not the healthiest dish, but I halved the sour cream and used the low-fat kind.  Also cut the cheese by 1/3.  Very tasty and not too difficult but it does take a long time.

I have become one of those people who take a wonderful recipe, change it and then come on here to rate it. It was so good though, I had to tell someone! I had a bunch of pulled pork left over and started looking around on here for an idea on how to use it. Not able to go to the store, I had to use what was available. This is where it gets funny. I sprinkled cumin over the pork, which was cooked in a vinegar, coffee and chili flake mix. I had only flour shells which I heated on a skillet. I took yellow, red and green bell peppers and red and green chilies with oil and browned. I then rummaged though the fridge and found mont jack, sharp cheddar, parmasean, sour cream and heavy cream. With a quick addition of flour, all the mish-mash of cheese and creams went in with a pinch of salt - and created the most awesome cheese sauce ever! I made 5 monster enchiladas and poured the extra sauce over the middle. Covered in foil and baked - uncovered to brown and just wanted to fall over it was soooo good. Thanks for the inspiration! I will make this with all my left over beef, chicken and pork!

Excellent. Kid and parent favorite and the leftovers are good too. One note, the dish is not what is pictured with the recipe. There is no red sauce or yellow cheese, and it doesn't need it. It is a little bland looking until you taste it!

Made these for dinner last night and I have to agree, they were a lot of work! Looks like we're going to get three meals out of them.  I guess it was worth it because my husband loved and asked me to keep the recipe!  Kids even ate them too.  I followed the receipe exactly.  Didn't change a thing.  Thanks for sharing!

This was edible and forgettable. For all the effort and time it took, it's just not worth it. I don't plan on making again as it was too involved for an okay meal.

OH! MY GOSH!!!!  These are fabulous!  The closest I've ever become to making mexican was making tacos and fajitas using a seasoning mix.  I cooked my beef in a crockpot.  This recipe is very easy but time consuming.  The next time I make these I will do it on a Sunday and make a whole lot of them to frezze for later.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

Put all beef ingredients in my slow cooker for 4 hours on high until it fell apart easily. Made awesome enchiladas without fuss.  Didn't make the rest of the sauce. Hubby loved it!!

Very good enchilada recipe. I think three pounds of beef is excessive for the portions stated. Next time I will use half that amount of meat and maybe the same amount of spice.

Best enchiladas I've ever had! Restaurant quality!  I must have used a cheaper cut of meat, because it was a little tough and didn't shred so I just threw it in the food processor and it came out great -- easier than shredding anyways!  I also followed the suggestion of making the red enchilada sauce.  The meat, cheese filling, and sauce can be made ahead of time to save time.

These are the best enchiladas I have ever had. I used leftover potroast and the Red Enchilada Sauce from this site. For the tortillas I used a tip from another site and sprayed them with cooking spray on both sides and baked them on cookie sheets at 300 degrees for about 5 minutes. I will be planning this for my potroast leftovers every time!

I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed with this "5 star" recipe. We all thought that it was kind of blah. Maybe a pkg. of taco seasoning or something would have helped give it a little zip. I used sirloin steak instead of chuck roast but that couldn't have made that much of a difference! I might give it a try with chicken as suggested by another cook.

Very good.  As per others suggestions, I did add some sauce to the sour cream mixture to make sure it didn't dry out.  Instead of dipping the tortilla's in oil and rolling them up, I layered in dish.  I also covered with foil during cooking to keep more of the moisture in.  This recipe makes a lot.  I made two large dishes which allowed me to freeze one of them for great lunches.

The beef flavor was good.  I also cooked mine in the crockpot, much easier.  I felt like the enchiladas needed sauce or something, too dry with just the cheese.  I didn't realize this was 10 servings, I had so much meat left over!  But the next night I added a package of brown gravy to the shredded beef and then added cooked egg noodles to make beef and noodles, now that turned out EXCELLENT!!!  Will make the meat again, just for the beef and noodles!!!

This is the best tasting beef enchilada I've ever had. It's a little dry but still very very good. I made it tonight and I can't stop eating it. Better than any they have in those fancy restaurants. Thank you, Christy.

This was a great recipe.  The only thing I changed is added some enchilada sauce before I baked them.  I used a can of red sauce, mixed with about a cup of the leftover sour cream mixture.  It was great!  The only other thing I would change is to add a little more spice, they were pretty mild for my taste.  The meat was amazing!  I'll use it for many different recipes.  Thank You!

I have had this recipie sitting around for some time because I thought it would take too much time to prepare, but it really didn't take that long.  I made a sauce to top the enchiladas by using the leftover sour cream onion mixture I had and mixing it with a can of red enchilada sauce.  I put that on top of the enchiladas and then topped with cheese.  I thought the meat turned out pretty good, but as I'm not a big roast fan I think I'll try chicken next time.  Very good flavor!

Oh my stars!!  This was just supreme.  My husband had three helpings and made "mmmm" noises while eating, which is very rare indeed.  I did reduce the amount of chilli in the meat by half. This was still quite firey for us, though not overly so.  I really enjoyed cooking this also and the reaction to the meal was well worth it too.

These enchiladas are still being raved about 3 weeks after I made them! I plan to make the shredded beef to keep on hand tomorrow. It is the basis for lots of future experimenting. (perhaps an enchilada/mole sauce)

Meat had a mild smokey taste from the cumin and chili powder. I used slightly under 3# of meat and it made *12*,not 10, VERY MEATY servings; which was 2-9 x 13 baking dishes full, using 10 inch tortillas and a heaping 1/4 cup of meat to each. My husband gave 4 stars;I felt it was more like a 3. But to be fair to the submitter-I am not the biggest meat lover. I topped (half only) with fresh chopped tomatoes and tiny bits of green onion. That to me, took the "kinda plain" flavor to a little higher level. Served with "Vigo" brand "mexican rice" kicked up with a can of black beans, can of corn, some tomato sauce, and some cumin and chili powder, like the meat. VERY hearty meal.

This meat is fantastic.  It would make an excellent taco.  I am not a fan, however, of the sauce or of the cooking method.  Enchiladas kind of need sauce on the bottom and top to keep the tortillas soft.  I do definitely plan to make the meat again though!

I made the meat, however I decided to change the recipe. After the meat was cooked, I placed it into a foil pan juice and all. Then I lit the BBQ pit . Threw a few chunks of wet wood on for smoke and I smoked this meat for 20 mins.  I then mixed homemade BBQ sauce with the meat.  Then I sandwiched the meat with Hawaiian rolls. 

Unfortunate never like the original enchiladas recipe,  but decided the meat would be great for roast beef sandwiches.

They turned out very dry which I suspected beforehand anyway. The filling was tasty but they definitely needed a sauce as well. Thanks Christy

One of our favorite large group meals.  I just fed 13 tonight on a double batch, and had leftovers. (These are even better as leftovers when we use flour tortillas.)

I'll often increase the cheese to 4c total, with 2c on top.  This works well with flour tortillas too, no frying needed.

When scaling up the recipe, you might not need to scale up the sauce.  I always have leftover sauce.

Great flavor easy to make too.  I turned it into a enchilada style lasagna.  The family lived it.  My corn shells even though I did like the recipe said must have been older then the store thought. Still camber out good.

I already had a brisket that had been cooked with bbq sauce in my slow cooker, so I shredded it and then used this recipe from the point of making the sour cream, onion, cheese mixture and did it as written from there. Can't remember if recipe said it, but I put some Old El Paso Enchilada sauce in the bottom of the baking pans, and then topped them lightly with more and a little shredded cheese. These were a huge hit!

I added a 1 lb can of enchilada sauce. Roasted a couple peppers (cut in half and put them under the broiler for a few minutes, then peeled off the burn) and added them to the cream sauce. Substituted greek yogurt for half the sour cream.

The meat was good but the enchiladas were too dry. It needs some type of sauce to cook in. Any time I have had them at a restaurant they have a nice sauce all over. I had some red enchilada sauce in the cupboard we tried but that wasn't quite right. Will look at other recipes to find a better solution.

This was good. I've made enchiladas many times but never with shredded beef before and I really liked the meat - I also did not dip the corn tortillas in oil, I covered them in wrap and microwaved til warm. I also didn't use any flour as I want them  GF.  I did the onions, cheese and sour cream filling but I personally wouldn't do that again, I'd just add items individually - I added black olives and jalapenos. I made the 10 Min. Enchilada Sauce on here (added some more tomato base) - and baked well so the tortillas would be crunchy as much as possible.  I served with avocado, sour cream and the recipe was very good. Thank you.

Great meat and filling, but a bit dry on the outside. Pour some enchilada sauce over enchiladas before the final jack cheese layer.

I give this 4/5 stars because it was really good, but not amazing. I've been making enchiladas for years, first with ground beef and now more so with chicken. These were more work because of the cooking time involved with a roast(do yourself a favor and start this a day ahead or in the morning, to ensure a tender roast) and making the cheese and s/c blend. I used more water than the recipe called for to begin with and because of that I didn't need any broth. I added seasoned s&p in addition to the spices in the recipe, as well as Worcestershire sauce and a can of tomato bisque(because it's a great secret ingredient to have on hand). This created a flavorful broth of it's own and I used it to moisten and add additional flavor to the beef once I shredded it. I also spooned it over the enchiladas before I added the cheese on top. It was very flavorful and the cheese and s/c filling was a nice touch. Corn tortillas work fine, so I'm not sure why people think otherwise.

SO GOOD.  Cooked beef in crock pot, left seasonings alone except added a little cumin and garlic powder.  Poured extra cooking liquid from meat over the top of enchiladas before sprinkling with cheese.  Definite keeper!

I liked the enchiladas but didn't have sour cream so I used Greek yogurt. Big mistake as when it baked, it turned into a ricotta-like texture and I did not like that. Overall a good recipe. I'm sure it wpuld have been better if I had used sour cream instead.

We will make this again. I suggest cooking the beef a little longer at 290 degrees, the red wine vinegar can then be reduced or left out. I found that it slightly flavored the beef at short cook times. Also, I found it easier to sear the beef first by rolling all sides in hot olive oil (my usual technique).

SPOILER ALERT - I did modify which is why I gave 4 stars.  My biggest take away for this recipe was using shredded beef from an inexpensive cut of beef and taking a readers suggestion to cook in slow cooker.  Did the rest all the same with the addition of refried beans, used less sour cream and added sliced black olives.  Also put some enchilada sauce in bottom of dish and poured some over the rolls before the cheese topping. Personal choice to use flour tortillas instead of corn as better taste and no additional prep required. The  basics of this recipe are a real winner - making again and again.

Love it! I roasted the chuck in a dutch oven, so I left out the beef broth and water. I stirred the shredded beef into the sour cream mixture after the cheese melted, and used 8 flour tortillas instead of corn. The meat filling is really tasty and I was worried that the flavor would be overwhelmed if I topped it with enchilada sauce as some reviewers did, so I baked the enchiladas "naked" and topped with the cheese during the last 10 minutes. Served them with salsa from the deli case at the supermarket. Yummy. Thank you Christy Campbell. Best beef enchiladas I've ever had.

I made this or my husband and he loved it. I didn't have the kind of beef called for so I used some ground beef that I already had seasoned. I can't wait to try the beef portion! 

I only had the Mexican shredded cheese and used that. I also added some garlic powder to the seasoning. I feel that just that extra touch brings all the spices together for an addictive flavor.

Thank you for adding this, it saved my day!

I made this for a family get together and it was perfect.  I made some very minor changes, for example I used 2lbs boneless beef chuck ribs so I had less meat, and needed to smallerize the recipe accordingly.  I didn't fry the tortillas in oil but coated them in red enchilada sauce as the other reviewer did and that worked well.  The meat was great as was the filling mixture.  Will definitely make this again!

I made the recipe with a few minor tweaks. I slow cooked the meat,  added green and red peppers.  Then made cheese sauce and layered it and meat in tortillas, frying the whole enchilada lightly in a very thin layer of olive oil.  Then cooked as directed.  Was perfectly crisp and delicious. Served with a question rice...which made it a little cheese heavy but darn good.

The meat by itself is amazing and we liked the enchilada recipe. The only downside is that it's a bit of work assembling them (if for the lazy chef). Oh, and we used flour tortillas. We cooked the beef in a crockpot and it was noticably better if cooked on slow on all day, vs high for a shorter time.

I have made many roasts over the years. Tonight I used this recipe for a roast dinner tonight. I followed the recipe until the onion mixture. For the very first time each of my (now over age 18) kids said it was the best roast I have ever made. One of them who generally does not like meat came back for seconds.  I will make this again, doubling it so  I will have roast  one night and the full enchiladas recipe the next night.  *as for red sauce, I intend to add a bit of tomato paste with cayenne and thicken the juices from the roast.

My family and I love these enchiladas, even my 3 yr old twins. A few adjustments I make: Instead of frying the corn tortillas, I just brush a little bit of EVOO on one side of the tortilla and warm in the pan for about 30 seconds per side, just enough to make them flexible to roll into enchiladas. I also make a quadruple batch, because they do freeze very well. I put about 10 in a package, then thaw overnight, place them in the baking dish, pour a can of enchilada sauce over them and then sprinkle the cheese and bake. Just awesome!!

If you hate tweaks, skip this review.  I only used the recipe and method for cooking a roast which I used for a different dish.   It was delicious and perfectly cooked.  Just wanted to thank Christy.  Helped  me with an dinner party.

It does take awhile to cook, but oh my goodness! The meat was delicious. It was so good that I'd eat it alone as a main course. By the time everything was put together and finished cooking it was really late, but well worth the wait.

I've made this vegan for myself and have used leftover steak, chicken and pork for others. It's a winner every time! When using leftovers I still boil the meat down in broth and spices. Additionally I pour a red enchilada sauce over the top before sprinkling cheese and baking and don't fry the tortillas (substitute with flour).
Thanks for sharing Christy.

Time consuming and certainly not worth it. The sour cream and cheese mixture was not good, to say it was nice as possible. Next time I will stick with my usual: slow cook the beef with onions and peppers, add into flour tortilla with shredded cheese, call it a day. NOTE: if you do use this recipe and top it with enchilada sauce, be sure to cover it for the majority of baking time so as not to burn the sauce.

Excellent recipe. Husband told me that these are the best enchiladas he has ever had and he is a Mexican food fanatic. I made only a few changes: I put the roast in my crock pot on high for 6 hours and I also added 4 chopped garlic cloves and half a chopped onion. I also added about 6 ounces of beer. Like other reviewers have remarked, I also added a red chile sauce before I baked the enchiladas. This recipe is definitely a keeper, thank you!!!

These were tremendous! I made only very minor adjustments to the original recipe, except that I did add enchilada sauce. I used the 10 minute red enchilada sauce on Allrecipes, which I usually love, but I actually think these enchiladas would have been better without it. The shredded beef in this recipe is just so good, but I felt that the sauce overpowered it a bit. I'll definitely make this recipe again, and next time I'll make them just as directed. Thank you for an excellent recipe!

Used this recipe for weekly church meal.
We feed about 80 people; made 200 enchilidas using 6" flour tortillas.
EVERYONE LOVED THEM!!!!
Made 100 with hamburger (not enough time to cook roast) and also 100 with shredded chicken (used food processor for shredding -- fantastic).
For chicken enchiladas, I used chicken flavoring vs beef.
Did not have time for all the simmering; sauteed onion in broth & vinegar & spices, added sourcream/green chili/cheese combination, added meat & used this mixture for filling.
Placed filled tortillas on parchment paper lined sheet cake pan, sprinkled cheese and used left over mixture on top.
Recipe is a KEEPER!!! Will put it in meal rotation.

Very tasty!  I used ground beef instead - fried the meat and once it was done added the broth mixture, simmered for about 30 minutes.  The tortillas were definitely time-consuming, so I'll make a note to make these every once in awhile.

Turned out phenomenal and I even used leftover roast!  I added all seasonings, even pepping up the cheese sauce at the last minute with red pepper flakes.  I also used pepper jack cheese and it ended with a subtle kick.  Be sure to try this recipe.  It's a keeper!

Made the meat the day before.  Put meat in crockpot without water and without seasonings, flipped it after 45 minutes, cooked another 45 mins.drained juice and fat.  Continued to cook in crockpot with seasonings and broth.  Put in fridge, heated up next day and shredded big chunks by pulsing in food processor (I was in a hurry).  Made sauce as directed (next time I will leave out the flour and add a jalapeno for extra zip).  Used flour shell (did not fry).  Spread a little leftover salsa on each and sprinkled cheese on top.  Husband said these were the best enchiladas I have ever made.  I agree! Will make again and again.  Froze leftover meat.

This is a great recipe! I do prefer flour tortillas though - just a matter of taste. You can also use turkey instead of beef if you want something leaner. We used this recipe with turkey in flour tortillas to make oven fried chimichangas for our cafeteria - the kids loved it! Just use smaller tortillas, roll them like a burrito, make sure you prick some holes in the top, spray lightly with cooking spray & bake at 425 until brown - about 20 - 25 minutes. Be sure to watch them - every oven is different!

Made this casserole-style for my young family and it was a huge hit! Layered flour tortillas, meat, sour cream mixture, repeat all, and then top with more cheese. Forgot to spray my pan so the bottom layer of tortilla stuck. I cooked my roast overnight in the crockpot and it was wonderfully tender by morning. Then I added the seasonings etc to the meat to let it flavorize. I kept the green chiles out since I'm the only one who likes them, but added them to mine and it was great. We will definately have this again!

A winner! Didn't have any sour cream, so I used a can of Cream of Mushroom soup instead. Also added a little leftover rice in with the meat mixture. Spooned Red Enchilada sauce over top, then cheese and some chopped, fresh cilantro! YUM!

This was excellent!  My whole family loved it, and we like mexican food.  Instead of chile powder, I used some dried chiles which I boiled, blended and then used the resulting paste - but that was only because I had the chiles and wanted to use them up.

This is the best.  I cooked the beef and the spices in a crock pot over night. I doubled chili powder,cumin, red wine vin., and beef broth and omitted water.  I also more green Chile peppers and extra shredded Pepper-jack cheese. I made it like a layered dish. I put sauce on bottom, then flour tortillas, beef, cheese sauce, and repeated 1 more time.  I poured some of the juice from the beef over each layer also to keep everything moist.  This was the hit of my party.

We make this for big groups and it is a huge hit.  The longer the meat cooks the better.  We actually slow cook the beef overnight (make sure to check water levels).

Thanks for the best beef enchiladas I've ever had!!  When I make them again, I am going to add just a spoonful of sauce to the top and see how that is. The sauce does soak up into the tortilla a bit if cooked too long, so I'll be real careful not to over bake.   The meat is to die for!!  I did 2 roasts at one time in my dutch oven on the stove. I usually do this in the crockpot, but enjoyed doing it differently and having it done a bit faster. The flavor was excellent. Whatever we can't use in the next few days, I will freeze already cooked for an easy meal down the road.

DELISH! I have made these numerous times (and even used just Part 1 for other stuff) and it's ALWAYS a hit. Description says it all, a little time-consuming, but well worth it. Give it a try, you won't be dissapointed! Thanks for sharing Christie!

I made this dish last night and OMG it was so good! I was a bit iffy about the sour cream cheese sauce after I saw what it looked like but it was actually pretty good and really helped make the meat taste extra moist I believe. I even posted a link on fb so all my friends might give it a shot. Meat takes forever to cook but if you have the time it's well worth it! This one will be a regular at home for me now.

Great recipe. I too used the crockpot to cook the beef and the meat and all was very flavorful. I did have nearly two cups of meat left at the end of the tortillas and filling which I promptly froze to use for tacos for next weeks Fiesta Friday!

These enchiladas were amazing! I used a beef chuck tender roast to reduce the fat. I only used 1.5 cups cheese. I only used a little bit of coconut oil to soften the tortillas and did not top with extra cheese. My kids LOVED these. The sour cream mixture totally makes the dish. I brought one for lunch today. Yum, thank you.

Great recipe! I made it in 3 8x8 foil pans and froze two pans for later. This worked out so well because you can stick it in the oven frozen for an easy dinner! The leftovers are excellent with a fried egg on top for breakfast :)

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The only change that I am going to make is trying it with ground sirloin.  My husband did not care for the shredded beef.

My family loved these enchiladas! They were sooo much better than anything I have ever had in a Mexican Restaurant!  I used leftover sirloin roast and just warmed it up on the stove with the spices and beef broth.  The best part about this recipe is the cheese and chili filling!  It really gives the enchilada's a great flavor-we may never go out for mexican food again!  Thank You

This took us 4 1/2 hours (!!!) to prepare, then baking it on top of that. The meat alone took 3 hours. When all was said and done, they tasted like, well, enchiladas. They were good, but I don't think the time spent was worth it. From reading other raving reviews on here we were expecting something out of this world. Again, they tasted good, but we expected more. But then again, we are not expert cooks either, so this was pretty advanced fot us.

Great recipe. Did cook the roast in a crockpot all day, but that was really the only change. Made a huge batch which was a great surprise. It was a hit with DH too. I might try them with chicken next time. Definitely a keeper.

I haven't tried it yet, but the recipe sounds delicious and appears to be one I could "customize" for a low carb diet.  I recently found wheat flatbread with 6 net carbs, so will use some filling in one flatbread and moisten with a little enchilada sauce.

Absolutely delicious! I had a frozen chuck roast and looked for a recipe to suit it -- this is one of the best recipes I've gotten from this site in some time. The meat is buttery and perfectly seasoned; the cheese sauce is delectable and could be used in any number of other recipes. This will become a regular treat at our house.

I cheated a bit on this recipe and used leftover shredded beef, then followed the recipe - until I got to the tortillas and used the flour tortillas since that is all I had. It had a great flavor but lacked the texture I know the corn tortillas would have given it. I can't wait to make it again and do it right! This is definitely a keeper.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Yes it took a long time to cook the beef, but well worth the wait.  Only thing I added was a bit a salt to taste. Corn tortillas are the way to to, but I ran out of meat before I got to 20..  but I filled up an 9x13" pan with them.  I like my enchiladas juicy, so I used the Enchilada Sauce from another submitter on top.  Great recipe!

I really liked this recipe.  It is easy to prepare. You can purchase any store brand enchilada sauce and it will work with this recipe.  I also used whole grain tortillas and fresh onions and tomatos.

The creamy sauce inside was AWESOME!  I overcooked my meat... although it was frozen and I followed most of the meat cooking directions.  But my roast was also smaller than 3 lbs so maybe that has something to do with it.  Next time, I will either cook the meat in the crock pot, or do chicken!  Hubbie said it's a keeper but we both think it would be better with chicken.  I also added a jalapeno for an extra kick.  DELISH!

This recipe was really good!  I will definitely make again.  The reason I gave it a 4 is because I couldn't give it a 4.5.  It is really good, but, for my family's tastes would need to be modified.  First, the sour cream sauce was too thick.  I would thin it out next time but I am not sure with what, milk???  I'll have to check the other reviews and see if anyone else thought that too.  I also thought the amounts were a little off.  I only made 12 enchiladas with this and froze the rest of the beef in the juice for next time I want to make enchiladas.  I made the same amount of cream sauce so I put some on the inside and some on top with a can of red enchilada sauce.  I only used 1 to 1.5 Tablespoons of the sauce and meat mixture per shell and they were plenty full, almost too full.  This was such a good recipe though.  You really have to try it!  It is a time consuming recipe, but most of that time is letting the beef simmer, so who cares!  My husband and I loved it!

This meat alone is awesome!! It is a little time consuming but totally worth the effort. I did not have time to make enchiladas the first time I made it so I did not make the green chili sauce and made burritos. Took them to a potluck, they were a hit! Next time I may just start the meat and then finish it in the crock pot so I don't have to watch it as closely. I will definitely try the green chili sauce next time also it sounds fabulous. Thanks for the great recipe!

My first time attempting Mexican. We've been in West Texas for a year now, so I figured I better learn! Definitely took me a very long time to make, but was worth it. Kept everything the same, just used some store bought enchilada sauce. Thanks for sharing!

luckily my wife made roast the previous night so i had the meat to make it,i also used  the juice from the roast to and added it to the meat mixture, for some reason i kept wanting to add corn to it, but i did not..  it turned out really good, my wife suggested i needed to add salt, but i didn't she is a salt freak and i am not..i used some green enchilada sauce on top ( only one can) we both believe it is a keeper

Okay so i cheated on this recipe and, even with my shortcuts, it was fantastic. I cooked ground pork (hamburger or turkey would work great too) and added some taco seasoning mix instead of using shredded beef. I know, the idea of this recipe is to use shredded beef but i was lazy!(and i don't eat beef) I also topped with a red enchilada sauce prior to baking. The sour cream sauce is sooo good!. I could have eaten it with no meat. Im sure as written this recipe is out of this world.

This recipe is wonderful! I do cook the meat in the slow cooker instead of stove top, it is much easier this way. I sometimes use half green chilies, half diced jalapenos, this adds quite a bit of heat!

My husband says these are the perfect enchiladas! He says they taste like the enchiladas in Texas! The recipe may take awhile but any good recipe takes a while! I would not change anything! Thanks for the great recipe!

In my opinion, too dry and plain!  The beef was fantastic by itself, but as a whole I'd give this recipe a pass the next time.

These were pretty good.  I cooked all the tortillas in oil as instructed and then put filling in.  By the time I added the filling the tortillas were too hard to roll.  I think i should have fried & put filling in right away. My tortilla ended up looking like a taco because it wasn't pliable.  None the less still good.

We didn't care for this recipe.  The cheese mixture was too sour/chili'y or something.  And cooking the corn tortillas in the oil for 30 seconds on each side was too long--I ended up with partially-crunchy tortillas.  I think you're just supposed to put them in the oil until they are soft, which takes far less than a minute.

Fantastic!  This made about 26 enchiladas.  I froze the ones that didn't fit in the baking pan so we can have them again!  I added the red enchilada sauce recipe from this site.

Awesome recipe, well worth the time, we even used flour tortillas (all I had on hand) and they were soooo good, just like the "wet burrito" we get at our local restaurant!

So I got a new crock pot and used it and as these enchiladas had great flavor and I will try them again my meat was tough, it did not shred! I cooked my meat on high and practically ruined it. I have NEVER cooked anything on high in a crock pot and will probably NEVER do it again unless the recipe says too... This is what I get for cutting corner. I will re rate next time!

This was the basic recipe for sauce and tortillas that I was looking for, I actually prepared the meat using "Charley's Slow Cooker Mexican Style Meat" which you can find on this site with a simple search.

I followed the recipe except for using the crock pot for the beef and I used hot salsa instead of chili's because that's what I had. Oh and I topped with enchilada sauce.  I will make these again and again.

This meat is the BEST. You can do a million different things with this recipe and they will all turn out well. I have tried chicken too and it turns out just as good as the beef. Try it, you'll like it.

Flavor was good, but it needs more moisture.  I think I will add some more sauce to the outside of the enchiladas.  All in all it's a good recipe.  I would make it again.  I may try Chicken next time.

The meat was absolutely amazing! I used Arm Roast (because thats what I had in the freezer). I used flour tortillas and the red enchilada sauce on this site...best enchiladas I have ever had.

This was a big hit. The recipe doesn't indicate a sauce that is as pictured. So I just slathered the top of the tortillas with remaining shredded beef and more cheese. YUM! :) Thanks for the great recipe.

Yummy! The sauce is key. I also cooked my roast in the crock pot. The top roast was cheaper than the chuck at the time so I used it instead. It turned out great! I also added the onion with the roast and spooned them out when it was time to make the sauce-already nice and soft! I substituted green enchilada sauce for the oil to make them a little more healthy. Definitely my new favorite enchilada recipe!

I'm trying really hard to finish the enchiladas, but the shredded beef is so good - the men can't keep out of it. Will have to try again :)
Finally shooed the men out of the house. These were awesome, and my husband/son are picky eaters. Good as given and a great keeper! Thanks for sharing.

This is my favorite recipe on the entire allrecipes.com site!! The only change we made was that we slow-cooked the shredded beef in the crockpot all day. They were so delicious, my husband and I ate the whole pan, for lunch and dinner!

I fixed this for the first time. Excellent!!!! I did not use the oil, I heated enchilada sauce and coated the corn tortillas with it before stuffing them. I got 16 large enchiladas out of this recipe. I will continue to use it. I also spiced it up with hot sauce.  Jan

These were good.  I had a little of the cheese mixture leftover, so I spread the rest of it on the corn tortillas and it made it so the tortillas werent dried out.  The picture shows it with some red sauce and a different kind of cheese.  So the picture doesnt match the recipe.  The meat was really good and it wasnt dried out even after being in the oven for 30 minutes.

They were good, but dry after the oven. Needed cream cheese, salsa or a sauce on the side to moisten the bite.

great recipe... I got sidetracked by 'helping' sons and added a enchilada sauce to the top.... don't do that, it takes away from the yummy base taste.  I cooked 3 roasts in a crock pot w/all the ingredients the day b4, had plenty of beef left over for nachos and sandwiches.

This was really good.  I followed another reviewer's advice and used the crock pot - cooked the beef for 5 hours.  I thought that there was too much sour cream in the filling.  It was still really good.  The boys and husband cleaned their plates!

This was oh soooo good! I think the cheese mixture is what makes this beyond awesome. 

I modified this recipe slightly based on other reviews. I used leftover beef I had from another recipe (Slow Cooker Italian Beef for Sandwiches by Maureen- the best ever!!!) and instead of corn tortillas I used un-fried flour ones. I also made a homemade red enchilada sauce to use.

I made the cheese/sour cream mixture as directed. Then for ease of assembly I layered it as a casserole in my oval stone dish. First I put enchilada sauce on the bottom to preven the tortillas from sticking. The I put tortillas, sour cream mixture, beef and repeated, ending with a layer of tortillas on top. I poured the rest of the enchilada sauce over the tortillas and eopped with cheese. Baked for 30 minutes and it came out all melty with a slight cheesy crust on top. My husband, my youngest and me devoured it. My oldest son complained about not liking the enchilada sauce with it, but as soon as I gave him sour cream to put on it he gobbled it up.

Hubby also had it the next day and it tasted just as good. A friend of ours stole a bite and was raving about it- wanted to know what it was. I now have to share the recipe.

These were great!  very time consuming-- crockpot recommended! I added a tsp of garlic salt to the cheese sauce, used lt. sour cream, only 1 can of green chiles (which was plenty!) and I think the salt I added to the meat helped, too. Thanks for the great *HOMEMADE* recipe!!

I made this recipe as indicated except I used a mexican cheese blend and I used my fryer to cook the tortillas.  This made 18 enchiladas.  I really wasn't sure what to expect and was quite surprised with how yummy this was.  The cheese filling/meat really melded together after cooking and the taste was just wonderful.  I'm so glad I have 12 more for the freezer.  I did make the red enchilada sauce to top it with.

Edited to add: I put these in the freezer individually wrapped and they were extremely handy, quick yummy meals.  I plan on keeping a stock of them in my freezer.  Fantastic!

Very good, but nothing to rave about. We did tear up our tortillas too, instead of rolling up individual enchiladas.

Yum!  I used leftover meat that I had cooked in the crockpot, so it didn't have the seasonings.  To make up for it, I added cumin to the sour cream mix.  It was great!

I made these exactly as the recipe said, and they were superb! I would have rated them a 5-star, but my husband said they were "missing something" and my kids didn't like the beef - I will try chicken next time, but I thought they were excellent as is!

I haven't made these with the beef. I use shredded chicken instead, which I marinate in a chili/lime mixture before baking and shredding. I follow the recipe from "chopped onions" down and it turns out great every time! I usually add more canned chili peppers and I use ground chili pepper for extra heat. My friends and family love the end result, and someone once asked if I was sure I didn't have a little Mexican in me, so I guess this tastes pretty authentic.

These enchiladas are soooo good!  Because they are time-consuming, I usually make them on a weekend when we're having guests for dinner.  They always go over BIG!  I've shared the reciped many times since it's always requested!

I made this for my husband and he loved it! Instead of shredded beef, I used a combonation of low fat ground chicken and beef. I used 1 cup. lowfat plain yogurt in place of one of the cups of sour cream. And I topped it with a can of enchilada sauce. We are very picky and this was definetly a "do-again"

To make this less time consuming I followed others advice and used the crock-pot for the meat.  We don't like corn tortillas so I used flour tortillas and instead of frying them I just brushed them with melted butter before baking.  I had quite a bit of left over sauce which I used to top the enchiladas after baking I think they would have been too dry without a sauce...the meat was very good and this was a nice change from chicken enchiladas.

Good flavor, but oh, the mess!  I tried the cut of beef suggested, and it did not fall apart for me, so that was not fun, but again, good flavor.  I also will take another reviewer's suggestion about using enchilada sauce--I did not even realize it was missing that until construction!  I will make again, but only maybe once a year or so.

Christy is right.  This is a really great recipe but very time consuming and it makes a big mess.  I nearly ruined the meat by letting it boil almost dry.  I also used enchillada sauce to soften flour tortillas (instead of oil) and dribbled some on top before baking.  Am not sure how often I will make this because of all the work, but my family really did enjoy it!

Well...this was a new way to cook  a roast..and i must say i did enjoy that. The meat tasted wonderful! The time consuming part was assembling everything else. We have always ate shredded beef tacos in my house.We make the roast in the crockpot then fry up some corn tortillas. Then put all the fixens on the table and everyone make their own. No sauce or baking required! I will definently cook my next roast this way...but will skip the rest:)

Awesome!  I cooked the meat in my crock pot rather than on the stove, and replaced the 2 cans of green chile with 2 cans of tomatillo salsa.  This is going to be a staple food in this house!

After the additional 2 hours of cooking, the meat was still tough.  Although, Since everyone else has had such wonderous results, I'll blame that one me.  Everything else turned out very nice.  I made corn tortillas but probably will use flour tortillas next time.  Stokes Green Chili Sauce and some homemade salsa put the finishing touches on this dish.  Quite good.  Next time will make the meat in the crock pot, though!

This was good... I think next time I'll kick it up a notch and add some jalepenos. In addition, I made the red enchilada sauce receipe from this site, as others suggested (however, I think it'd taste better with canned sauce).

I folowed this recipe pretty close to exact. I used the Enchilada sauce as others said they did. I also the night before I made them used a crock pot for the meat. Ilet it go all day then just picked it apart with a fork and let it simmer. Then I placed in fridge till I was making them the next afternoon. I didn't use onions because I don't care for them. I cooked for about 15 min then sprinkled with cheese and olives. They were the best !Got rave reviews with dinner quests! Recipe is a keeper in my kitchen. Thank you for sharing !

Alot of work, but tasted great, poured enchilada sauce as others recommended. Gave some to my neighbors who raved about them.

We actually used the beef for beef and noodles like another user had suggested. It was wonderful. Cooked all day in the crock pot smelled wonderful. Well worth the wait. Did not make the enchiladas but may do it soon.

Absolutely delicious!!!  I didn't change anything to the actual recipe for the beef and sour cream mixture but did take a few suggestions made in other reviews for the overall dish.  I substituted flour tortillas instead of using the corn tortillas (just our familys preference).  Also, poured enchilada sauce on top before baking.  Used an excellent recipe from this web site 'Red Enchilada Sauce' submitted by Sara.  Lastly, I added the cheese on top during the last 10 minutes of baking.  You WON'T be disappointed with this recipe!

The recipe was enjoyed by the entire family.  Per other's suggestions, I did add red enchilada sauce on top so they wouldn't be dry.  Hubby said definitely a keeper.  Yummy!

Fantastic!!!  I have made many enchiladas and this is the best.  This is my new enchilada recipe.  Thanks Christy!  Only things I did   differently were to use flour tortillas instead of corn.  I topped with enchilada sauce, cooked and then add shredded cheese during last 10 minutes of cooking.

I actually just followed the recipe to cook the beef with spices down to the large onion on the recipe list.  I used a whole can of beef broth in lieu of the broth/h20 combination.  After cooking for 3.5 hours, the beef was practically falling apart -- oh so tender!!! After cooling for 1/2 an hour, I shredded beef into a separate bowl.  In a separate pan, I sauteed some green peppers and onions and added the shredded beef with some remaining liquid from the pot - maybe about 2 ladles.  I simmered/sauteed this mixture for about 20 minutes.  I served over yellow rice (saffron and broth) with black beans.  It was yummy!!!

Wonderful, flavorful shredded beef.  I used that portion of the recipe to cook a small roast in the crockpot overnight.  Only additions were a couple of cloves of chopeed garlic, about a cup of salsa and several tablespoons of soy sauce.  A couple of hours before dinner, I removed the roast from the juices and strained them into a saucepot on the stove.  I shredded the meat and returned it to the pot and added 1 can chopped green chiles and 5 or 6 chopped potatoes.  Simmered this for an hour or so and we had the most delicious burritos ever!  My son said he'd never tasted beef so good.

Excellent.....the meat was delicious.  All though next time I might add some Rotel (diced chiles and tomatoes) instead of just the chiles.  Everything was very tasty....I will definitely make this again.

I used beef stew meat and prepared it in the crockpot too.  Also used flour tortillas.  I noticed that when I added that 2nd cup of cheese to the sauce, it thickened up too much, and would account for why some reviewers said this was too dry; so I added a can of green enchilada sauce (same flavor that diced green chiles have) and that made it a nice consistency.  I also had extra sauce so I added some red enchilada sauce to it and drizzled it over the top of the enchiladas before I put it in the oven.  Did everything else the same as recipe called for.  They were pretty good.  Thought they might taste better with chicken.  I'm still looking for the PERFECT enchilada recipe.

This recipe reminded me more of a flauta than an enchilada simply because it was dry.  I think of enchiladas as smothered.  I served it at a party and everyone loved it.  I used both corn and flour tortillas, the flour seemed to go first.  I also mixed some sour cream and store bought salsa together to put on the side that people could put on the "enchilada"  Huge success.

Worth every single gram of fat in it!  My roast turned out to be fatty and wouldn't shred, so I thought it would ruin the recipe.  But it was still just fabulous.  I can't wait to try it with a decent roast.  Everyone loved it.  I served it with fresh salsa, sour cream and guacamole and it was a real hit.

I omitted the green chilies and sour cream and added sliced black olives and minced red onion before cooking. This is the only way to have great shredded beef enchiladas.
