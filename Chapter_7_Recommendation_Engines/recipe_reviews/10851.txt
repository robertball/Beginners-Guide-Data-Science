The first time I made these, they were so-so, the second time I substituted applesauce for the oil, and added pieces of dark bittersweet chocolate, along with some semi-sweet chocolate chips to make these brownies unbelievable!! The texture was just right for me, thick and fudgy. No frosting needed.  An awesome way to cut fat and add nutrition in brownies.

These were great.  I do agree they are more cakey than fudgy, altough the middle was nice and gooey.  I even tricked my 6 year old who will not let vegetables past her lips.  I peeled the zucchini so she wouldn't see the green, but she still noticed some white flecks.  I told her the white was white chocolate chips.  I'm going to gradually start adding the peel in.

This will definitely be a regular at my house!

UPDATE-Okay, I ate one tht was baked yesterday and sat overnight. The brownie's are now fudgy and wonderful!  The moisture from the zucchini must soak in more overnight.

I loved these brownies.  I have made them twice, and while they turned out different both times, both ways were great.  I first time I made them I dried the zucchini well and it resulted in a fudgy brownie.  The second time my zucchini had more moisture in it and the result was a more cake like brownie.  I can't wait to see what I get the third time!

These brownies were super..I added twice as much zucchini since I have an abundant supply.I also added an extra one half cup of walnuts to it.You can never have enough walnuts in brownies!!! I also put buttercream icing on them and it was excellent...These were very moist. For those of you who said they turned out like cake must have used a regular cake pan....This was so easy too., and didn't take long to make....thanx for the recipe, Cassie !

I added a little brown sugar (1/2 cup) and 2 cups of chocolate chips. I also omitted the walnuts and baked it in a 9x13 pan and the kids devoured it in a few hours. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I have a massive amount of zucchini to use this summer and I found this brownies.  They are very cake-like, which I love!  

The recipe was very easy and went together in about 5 minutes (zucchini already prepared).  I didn't follow the other reviews until the brownies had baked about 10 minutes and then I decided to sprinkle some mixed chips on top.  I also iced with a chocolate icing.

They are yummy and will go over very well here!

I made these "brownies" for a potluck supper and everyone loved them - and nobody had any idea there was zucchini in there until I told them!  Even the kids ate them up!  I baked the recipe in a 9 x 13 pan (after reading other reviews) and also frosted them with canned chocolate frosting and sprinkled with walnuts rather than incorporating them into the batter.  Definitely more of a cake than a brownie - but delicious no matter what you call it!

My daughter and I enjoyed this recipe...although it really is more of a cake than a brownie.  My husband and other two daughters turned their noses up at this because it wasn't sweet enough for them.  Next time I will take other reviewers' suggestions and add chocolate chips or frosting to sweeten it up, athough I prefer it as is.

These brownies (which have the consistency of cake) were just OK.  I was happy with it's ability to hide the taste and texture of the zucchini in order to trick at least some of my kids.  However I found them to be laking in sweetness and flavor.  I even added chocolate chips (3/4 c.) after reading some of the other reviews, I imagine w/o them it would be really bland.  I was also surprised by how thin these were, the picture made them look thick but they are not.  I will make these again and try tweaking it some.

Definitely more cake like than brownie. I like the dense fudgy type brownies, but as a cake this is awesome! I sprinkled some powdered sugar on top and it's yummy.

I have always wondered what to do with Zucchini, finally I found this chocolate recipie and made it, my kids loved it and never noticed the zucchini.
I have modified it a little by adding 1/2 cup bran with 1 1/2 cup flour and that made it more fluffy and darker. every one loved it.

Neither sweet  or chocolatey enough. Rather bland with a strange, spongy texture. I didn't change anything in the recipe, but I finished up wishing I had.

I made this one by accident, because my all time favourite brownie is "Zuchini Brownies."  I wasn't paying attention to the computer screen and clicked on the wrong one.  However, I was pleasantly surprised with the results.  Whereas the other recipe is a rich, gooey brownie, this is more of a firm cake brownie.   Both are great, it just depends on what people prefer.  I notice that with some of the reviews people don't like them because their either too gooey, or too cakey.   If you prefer a cakey brownie to gooey, go with this one.  If, like myself  you don't care, either one is great!

This recipe needs only one more thing to make it perfect. Choc. chips! I added 1/3 cup of choc chips and made it in a 9X13.  It was so great I tried it again to make sure I had done it right and then to make enough to take to a potluck, I 1&1/2-ed the recipe and made it in my bar pan. Nice thick chocolately brownies and what a way to use that zucchini! Everyone raved about them. Needs to bake just a smidge longer when changing the pan recommended in the original. Thanks Cassie!

These brownies are awesome! They are light, yet still have a great chocolate flavor. I did use applesauce instead of oil, but otherwise followed the recipe. Will be making lots of these!

Every spring my kids hound me to plant zucchini plants...just so I can make Cassie's brownie recipe in August.  I substitute choc chip morsels for the nuts tho because my son doesn't do nuts.

So delicious.  Baked in a 9x13 pan for about 35 minutes.  We added about 3/4 cup cocoa powder and a handful of dark chips.  Omitted nuts.

This is a very good brownie and a great way to use up zucchini.  I used a 9x13 regular cake pan and my brownies did come out cake-like.  I also took the advice of others that the brownies could use some frosting and put 1C chocolate chips on top 5 minutes before taking out of the oven.  Then I just spread them over the top as my "frosting" when the brownies were done.  I put them in the fridge after cooling and they taste wonderful!

Too cakey and not sweet enough--more like chocolate muffins than brownies.  They were ok when we sliced them and spread butter on them...

WOW! Great recipe.  I upped the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup, and added mini chocolate chips.  I don't have a 10x15 pan, so I used a 12x16 pan.  They came out thin and moist and delicious.  Also smeared some homemade chocolate frosting on top.  YUM!

I made these with gluten free by replacing the wheat flour with my gluten free flour mix and I also added chocolate chips. They are delicious! I haven't had brownies in such a long time and they are hard to stop eating!

What a great way to sneak in a bit of veggies for picky eaters! I added about a half bag of chocolate "chunks" (not the classic chip shape) for a little more chocolate. We did not dry the zucchini so the brownies were very moist and remained tasty for days. I had a couple of people tell me that these were the best brownies they've ever had!

I thought this was a very good recipe and I made it exactly as it was written.  The brownies are moist and a little more like cake.

Added choc. chips to the dough before baking. The brownies are just OK. It tastes more like chocolate zucchini bread, than a rich brownie. Probably will not make again.

Fabulous recipe!!! Made several times. Changed the serving size to 36 and put into a 9 x 13 pan. Everyone at play group loved it. But you must either frost it or put 2 cups choclate chips in or its more like a cake. MMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!

These were definitely moist, but they didn't taste like anything! They needed more sugar or maybe the chocolate chips that everyone else recommended. I usually don't give out 1 star ratings, but I was really disappointed with these.

These were very good but to me they were more like cake.  The flavor/texture remind me of a wacky or crazy cake. Frosting or a sprinkle of confectioners would be recommended.

I think these are great and my kids are gobbling them up!  They are definitely a cakey brownie but yummy.  I'm going to try other ideas of adding choc chips for more chocolatey flavor.  Would be yummy with a thin layer of frosting too.

I made these and they came out very good. Although I modified the sugar content by half and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar and it came out mildly sweet. Next time I will use the 1 cup of sugar it called for. I like this recipe alot. I will definitely make again.

AMAZING!! I used half whole wheat flour, substituted all applesauce for the oil, and added 1/3 c. choco chips (for a half recipe) And no nuts. When I pulled them out at 20 min, I thought they looked over baked but they are very moist. I will probably add more zucchini next time, because you really don't notice it at all! I ate these about 30 seconds after they came out of the oven because I was so anxious to finally have a healthy brownie recipe! Thank you for the amazing recipe!

Great brownies!  My Husband is a diabetic, so I substituted Splenda for Baking for the sugar.  I also added 1 cup of chocolate chips, like a lot of the other reviewers did.  Great way to use up some extra zucchini! Would definitey make again and recommend to others!

I lost this recipe, I was so glad it was still on the site.
My grandkids hate vegtables, I made these last year and they devoured the whole pan. My husband and i are diabetic, so I made them this year with a splenda baking blend, they were still great!! I use a 9X13 cake pan, also add 1 cup chocolate chips. Love them!!!

A yummy recipe to make with kids!  My 9 yr. old daughter and I planned to make this recipe together until I got an unexpected phone call that took me away for over 30 mins.  To my surprise my daughter had the batter all ready to go into the pan when I finally finished the call.  She made it all by herself without any help.  We used a 9x13 pan and they still turned out great!  My daughter is an extremely picky eater and she LOVED the brownies.  She couldn't believe she couldn't taste the zucchini in it.  We also made a homemade chocolate frosting to go on top...loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were moist and tasty.  My family quickly devoured the entire pan.  I added and handful of chocolate chips and substituted splenda for half of the sugar.  It was more of a cakelike brownie, but still good.

Perfect!  The only thing I did different was omit the nuts (due to allergies).  They are moist, fudgy, tasty and without frosting you save a few calories!

Thanks for the great recipe!

Very moist and cakelike. No one can believe there is zucchini in the brownies.  I put dark chocolate chips on top while the brownies were hot and then as they melted, I spread the chocolate with a knife.

Just finished making these brownies.  The whole family loved them.  They were very moist and delicious tasting.  I didn't use the nuts but put in mini chocolate chips instead.  They are great.

I like a fudgy brownie, but thought I'd try this recipe.  It is a cake texture, but very moist, so it's a keeper.
I whisked the eggs until frothy, used melted butter instead of vegetable oil & probably an extra 1/2 cup of zucchini (peeled) so maybe that made a difference, s it wasn't dry.
Not too sweet, but I like it that way.  Add chocolate icing if you want more chocolate.

After reading other reviews, I made some adjustments as well. They turned out FABULOUS!!!! We are trying to eat healthier, so I 1/2ed the flour and substituted a mixture of coconut, oat,  and brown rice flour. Added flax seed, only used 1/2 cup brown sugar and added choc. flavored stevia instead, doubled the zucchini, and added a cup of dark choc. chips to the mix. Geat starter and idea for using zucchini...never would of thought of this on my own!!!!!!!!!!

Awesome! I added semi-sweet chocolate chips (about a cup I think) and they turned out soooo good. They were a little bit cakey, but that made them a little easier to send in school and work lunches. The best part was, nobody knew there was zucchini! My husband didn't even know until he happened to see a little piece of green in one bite.

Versatile recipe! I used summer squash in place of zucchini, added an
extra tsp of vanilla extract, and reduced the cocoa to 1/4C for a more
milk chocolate rather than dark chocolate taste. Following the
suggestions of others I added chopped pieces of a chocolate bar that a
friend gave me from Germany into to the batter. It is more cake-like, but I not complaining.  After baking I sprinkled on top about 1/2C of chocolate chips, waiting a few minutes before
spreading the melted layer throughout. Next time I'll try a different chocolate bar.

The end result was good, but I definitely wouldn't call it a brownie.  I made the recipe as it was written, but had to cook it for 35 minutes.  The end result was a moist cake.

I love these brownies. Due to living in Denver I had add extra flour (2 tbsp) and less baking soda (3/4 t), temp to 375 degrees, plus my son can't have nuts so I did a bag of chocolate chips instead. EXCELLENT

These were great.  I took the others advice and baked it in a cake pan.  I topped it with chocolate chips and walnuts 5 minutes into baking.  Very moist!!!  Next time I will try it without the nuts and chocolate chips because it really did not need them.

They were okay, I guess, but definitely cake-like and a bit bland.  It's an okay way to use up zucchini once you get tired of "regular" zucchini bread but I doubt I'll make these again.

I did a half recipe, which called for 1 cup of zucchini. I was a little short, so I added a little applesauce, and also substituted applesauce for the oil, which made it healthier. I used substitute for the egg as well. I messed up this recipe so much that it's hardly the same anymore. My friends said they liked it, but I don't know. These weren't much like brownies as they were like mushy fudge-ish stuff. They were all right.

Very tasty and easy to make - and a great way to use up the giant zucchini I got from my mom!  These were more cakelike than I like in a brownie, though - so perhaps they would more appropriately be labeled a chocolate zucchini cake?

These were pretty good...not quite Pillsbury, but for using up the tons of zucchini from my garden I would try anything!   I didn't add any chocolate chips, but will next time I make them...and I will make them again as long as my zucchini is abundant!

Very good. I'd had zucchini/chocolate desserts before, and this is one of the moistest brownie recipes I've made. It took some time to shred the zucchini but otherwise was quite easy and great! I'll definitely make this again.

Took 28 minutes in a 10inch x 10inch pan which was all i had available.  Also subbed white sugar for coconut palm sugar, and walnuts for semi-sweet choc chips.  Very stable recipe.  It looked dry at first but came out beautifully.

This was a very easy to follow recipe and tasted delicious!  I did make it in a standard 9 x 11 inch pan, so it was thicker and more cake like. I served it with caramel sauce and ice cream.  Everyone enjoyed it! I will definitely be making this again!

The only thing I did different was I used frozen zucchini. It was thawed and excess moisture removed. The batter was beyond dry. Mine stayed dry, especially around the edges. Maybe I should have put zucchini in with extra water?

Based on others feedback, I must have over cooked the brownies as the are crumbly, however very tasty.  I love the deep dark chocolate taste of the brownie.  A little goes a long way.  I can't wait to try them again and frost them too.  This is a keeper.

Awesome recipe! It is just like cake. My tip, after you bake it, put it in the refrigerator, it's 10x better!
I also took a jar of frosting and melted it in the microwave and then poured it in top before refrigerator.

My 12 year old daughter made these brownies by herself, following exact recipe-we were all pleasantly surprised.  My husband said he wouldn't eat them when he found out there was zucchini in them--then after we got him to try them, we had to tell him to quit before he ate them all! Delicious as is.

This is a great recipe! I agree with other reviewers that the texture is more cake-like, but a nice soft and moist cake.
I added about 1 cup of Semi Sweet Chocolate Mini Morsels sprinkled over the top, and that added a nice fudgieness, next time I think I'll mix them right in.
This was a huge hit, even with the doubters who were worried about the zucchini content. Everyone loved it and wants more!

I loved this recipe! I made them for my family when they came out for my wedding. I had everyone take a bite of a brownie and try to guess the "secret ingredient" but no one figured there was zucchini! For my family (less adventurous in their taste), I added semi-sweet chocolate chunks and the brownies tasted WONDERFUL! For my husband and myself, in the future, I will make these without the chunks, but add a light chocolate glaze. Mmmmm!

Good healthy alternative to boxed brownies.
Mine were almost too moist... maybe my zucchini was extra watery. I had to bake them about 20 minutes longer.

This is the first 1 star review I've ever given. Made the brownies exactly as written. The result was a bland, vegetative brownie with a crispy top, cakey around the perimeter, with a gooey, liquid-filled middle. That was after baking for over 10 minutes longer than stated in the directions! My girlfriend felt ill after trying them. The shame is that we both love zucchini!

Not at all like a brownie. Texture is very cake-like, which was okay, butnot what we were looking for. Although i sifted all my dry ingredients, there was a strong baking powder tasted. Will stick with chocolate zucchini CAKE recipe.

These brownies are fabulous.  They are super moist, and freeze well.  I added a fudge like frosting, after they were cooled, and I also added chocolate chips to the batter (about 1/2 cup for a double batch).  I usually double the batch and make them in a sheet cake pan because everyone loves them so much.  I would definitely reccomend this recipe.

WOW!  I made the other recipes like this on the site first, what a mistake!  This one is so much better.  Super rich and tasty.  I did follow other reviewers suggestions-adding chocolate chips in the mix and doubled the nuts, then melting chocolate chips on top as a frosting.  Super yummy, that did help it from feeling too cakey as others have complained.  I also doubled the zuc called for.  Absolutely sinful!  Already added to the keep forever file.  Thanks!

These were great, but definitely more cake-like. Next time I will try to get more of the moisture out of the zucchini as one person suggested. A great treat to put in the freezer for unexpected guests.

I read others reviews and decided to add some chocolate chips, along with the walnuts. They were ok, but personally for me, my preference is a regular brownie. My family said they would be allright , but the texture seemed odd to them.

This recipe is all right, but it tastes like rather bland chocolate cake to me, not like rich, fudgy brownies.  I wonder if adding chocolate chips to it and frosting it with chocolate frosting would increase its appeal.

I think these brownies are great.  I added milk chocolate chips and I do believe they are a must.  Without the chips they might be a little low on sugar.

I added chocolate frosting, and everyone loved them at the potluck picnic, except for one person who complained that they weren't sweet enough.

Giving 4 stars because I modified the original:
1. replaced half flour with oat flour
2. replaced half sugar with splenda
3. added ground flax seed (2T)
4. added 2T of chopped bittersweet chocolate

As it was, they turned out excellently and the 'new' version has 115 calories per serving, mostly due to losing the extra sugar.  Moist, rich (though next time I may use more/better cocoa), and even a bit healthy:  a perfect breakfast.  *grin*

I loved these brownies!  They were spongy, not fudgy but they were chocolatey and since I was on a low-fat diet due to gallstones, this was FABULOUS!  ;)  Thanks!

These were good- they didn't quite cook all the way on the inside but the outside burned, and that was frustrating. As a side note, I tried them with honey and soy milk as well and I thought it wasn't good (of course its not Cassie's fault!) but strangely enough my family like that one beter. Pretty good, but not great overall I'd say.

A great way to use up zucchini, very tasty. Mine came out cake like.
