These were just too soft and messy. They were great just out of the refrigerator but after a bit they became gooey enough to fall apart when I picked them up.

great beginner recipe. I used natural smooth pb and honey nut cheerios w/ great results. These are pretty melty on your fingers as you eat them so I think wrapping each serving separately in wax paper or saran wrap and storing in the fridge would be a good idea...

My BF's boys think I am the absolute BOMB in the kitchen with the recipes I get from this site! I doubled the recipe put it in a 9x13 pan used up the last of the Cheerios (which came to about 7 cups total and they were still all evenly covered with chocolate). They set up perfectly and got rave reviews. Will definitely be making this one again. Thanks for another new favorite!

These are really messy to eat but tasty. I used Lucky Charms and they turned out great.
