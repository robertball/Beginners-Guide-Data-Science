This was a delicious recipe!  Sam's Club has an excellent rotisserie chicken and I asked an employee there what seasonings they used.  He said Lawry's prepares and sends a seasoning rub that is specially made for them.  Anyway, I used the Sam's Club rotisserie chicken in this and the flavor blends were perfect and it was soo easy!  My family scarfed this up.

The fresh dill with the oranges and grapes is great.  I served this as a "fork" salad with fresh bread.  Rave reviews from my friends.

Wonderful chicken Salad Sandwiches!!  I omitted the grapes and seeds because I did not have them in the house and I cooked chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.  All of the adults at our party loved them!  I will definately make them again and add the other ingredients too!

This is one of the most delicious recipes I've ever made.  And so quick!  Last night we had grilled chicken breasts.  I grilled a few extra breasts to use for later, and decided to use them for this recipe.  Tonight I diced 3 chicken breasts, and added about a cup of mayo (love mayo), a handful of chopped walnuts, a couple handsful of seedless green grapes (quartered), the can of mandarin oranges, some dried dill weed, a sprinkling each of garlic powder and onion powder, and a pinch of salt.  Dinner was ready in 5 minutes and my whole family adored it!  (Well, the 7 and 4 year olds picked out the walnuts . . .)  The mandarin oranges gave it such a wondeful flavor, so fresh tasting.  I don't like fruit or chicken that much, but this was delicious.  I will be making this all the time.

I served this for a wedding reception and it was a great hit!  I think the secret is roasting the chicken and using both the light and dark meat of the chicken.  Will use again.

I had made up my mind this recipe was my last attempt at chicken salad as it never turns out the way I want.  I was amazed at how great this one is!  It is just perfect.  I'm sure buying a roasted chicken made a huge difference as well.  LOVE IT!!!

This was wonderful chicken salad.  I didnt have any sunflower seeds, which I regret because Im sure it would have been great.  I cut out the croissants and served these on endive leaves.  Very light and very pretty.  Rave reviews from tons of people at my party.  Thanks for posting.

Like some of the others, I bought a roasted chicken from the grocery store.  Quick, easy, and delicious!  Served it for a group of friends and they even went back for seconds.

It took me forever to get past the idea of mixing sweet and savory together but I finally have and just adored this chicken salad. I used a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, cut back on the dill a bit and added in some finely minced onion and a little garlic powder. Instead of the bread I served this on top of baby spinach leaves. So yum and thank you Tracey!

This is by far the best chicken salad I've ever had!  The combination of fruits with the dill was perfect!  I roasted chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken, and added a bit more dry-roasted sunflower seeds, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe is awesome!  The hint of dill, with the combination of roasted chicken, grapes & mandarin oranges tastes wonderful.  I did not change a thing with this recipe.  I have made it several times for group outings, and get rave reviews, thank you for sharing!

These were awesome! I used dried dill, so I only used about a heaping teaspoon full. It was perfect!

I didn't love this, BUT I didn't make it exactly according to the recipe (so I still gave it four starts).  I had boiled chicken on hand and there were no grapes at the store (!?!) so I substituted diced apples.    Overall, I just thought it was a little too busy-all of the flavors were competing too much.  The sunflower seeds seemed to win out-if I make it again I will cut those at least in half.  Overall, I was disappointed, but it may be my own fault.

I made these for my women's Bible study group and when the meet was all said and done, I was asked to be on the hospitality committee.  I took the leftovers to work the next day and I still have coworkers begging me to make them again...and they got the leftovers!
FANTASTIC RECIPE!

It was wonderful and easy.  I made 24 for a potluck and they disappeared (unlike some of the other items).  I see that others did what I did and picked up a deli roasted chicken.

I use pre cooked frozen grilled chicken breast strips and fat free mayo. Super quick and very low fat/calorie.....minus the croissant of course.

This chicken salad is Fantastic.  I served this as full sandwiches at 1 party and at another, cut the mini croissants in 1/2 a bite size appetizer.  Had many requests for the recipe both times. I also used a pre-cooked rotisserie.  Will make this one over & over!

A clever twist to chicken salad, and the dill, mandarin oranges and grapes are the main actors in making this remarkable. Did this the fast and easy way by using a prepared rotisserie chicken. Instead of croissants, some wrapped the chicken salad in flour tortillas while others preferred romaine lettuce leaves. A fantastic way to serve up a fast and very tasty lunch. Nice job, Tracey.

Excellent!!!  Were a huge hit at the bridal shower.  I used a rotissaire chicken from the grocery store to save time and it worked great.  Can also make up the salad ingredients ahead of time and then the day of the party I added the mayonnaise.

Thanks so much for the recipe.  This salad is so refreshing and easy to make (used a store-bought roasted chicken).  The sunflower seeds add just the right amount of crunch.  It's delicious on Albertson's white pan bread.

i too bought a pre-roasted whole chicken for this recipe, but the only choices were cranberry or apricot roasted chickens. this added a bit of an odd taste, so if you're making this with a store-bought roasted chicken, go for one without a fruit flavor. it wasn't bad, just conflicting tastes. otherwise, a good recipe.

I thought this tasted wonderful!  I loved it with the croissants - very yummy!  I bought an already cooked rotisserie - very convenient and it turned out great!  My picky husband wasn't crazy about the fruit in the chicken salad.  Otherwise, he thought it was great!

Loved the combination and the ease of the recipe. I used our home canned chicken, just pulled apart and dumped. Great as is for a lovely Christmas Tea.

Absolutely the BEST chicken salad I ever tasted, and I don't like mandarin oranges, but I do in this! Everytime I bring it to functions, I am always asked for the recipe.

This is wonderful chicken salad! I'm trying not to eat bread, so I served it on lettuce leaves. Delicious!

I was surprised I didn't care for this salad and neither did the rest of my family.  I personally like grapes in my chicken salad.  I think that was the hang up my husband had - he apparently does not.  My daughter is a huge mandarin orange fan, which is one reason I was drawn to this recipe, yet she didn't like it.  I think maybe it needed some more flavor.  Maybe onion, celery, salt?  I don't think I will try this one again.

This was great. I used a store bought rotisserie chicken so that I wouldn't heat up the house on a hot summer day. It was very convenient. This was easy to make and delicious. I recommend it.

Oh my goodness!  This truly is the best chicken salad recipe I have ever tried!  And I have tried many...
The only thing I changed was the amount of mayo... instead of 3/4 of a cup, I only put in a 1/2 cup.  But that was our preference on not liking mayo so much.  Try the recipe as is... you will will fall in love!
