very light and refreshing - used real crab meat and marinated artichokes instead of palm - forgot the bacon and did not miss it

Delicious!  I ate the whole thing myself (tasted fine leftover) but can't wait to make this dish for family and friends! The only changes I made, mainly out of necessity and laziness, were using chopped vine-ripened tomatoes, garlic powder, and thick cut pre-cooked bacon.  I also cut the asparagus into bite size pieces BEFORE roasting and crumbled the bacon AFTER cooking.

This is a very good recipe. Definately put the tomatos in the oven with the asparagus. I tried putting it without and the tomatos were very hard and it did not compliment the salad. My husband LOVED this dish. I cut the asparagus before putting it in the oven which was a lot easier!

Super easy to make and delicious! It makes a lot though.  I made it just for my boyfriend and I and ended up taking most of it to work.  My coworkers polished it off and raved about how good it was! I would definitely make again.

The directions were hard to follow.  DO  NOT put the tomatoes in the  oven with the asparagus, unless you want really mushy tomatoes.    I modified this and added cilantro, the juice of a whole lemen and did not put use the hearts of palm or the bacon.  Cut the maters in half so they are easier to eat.

Something different to try with asparagus which I like, but over all it just didn't work for me with the combination of ingredients. I might try leaving the bacon out next time.

Keeper alert!  I loved this salad, even with the imitation crab.  The only change I made was to cook the bacon in the microwave, so I didn't have any bacon fat to warm the "crab" meat, and honestly, I don't think it needs it.  Lovely, light, easy to assemble for a spring luncheon, the roasted veggies hit just the right note.  This is a bargain for all you calorie watchers out there.  Only 173 per serving, and worth every one.  Thank you, thank you, I will make this again!

Hubby and I both liked it a lot. I thought it needed a little more zing to the dressing, or maybe just more dressing.  We ate it as an entree for dinner and then lunch the next day.  I didn't saute the crab in bacon grease because I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I used real bacon, imitation crab, pencil thin asparagus, and extra hearts of palm.  I did put the tomatoes in the oven with the asparagus, but made sure they were cooled completely before adding them to the salad for stirring.  I'll make it again but maybe with a smidgen more lemon juice.
