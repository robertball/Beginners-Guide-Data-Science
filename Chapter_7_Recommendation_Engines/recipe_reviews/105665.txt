I love lemon-caper chicken, so I was a bit skeptical of a lower-carb recipe.  I didn't bother buying the whole-wheat flour, but rather omitted the flour all together (thus it can be used for Phase 1, 2, or 3 of South Beach) and it turned out great. You can use a bit of garlic and a few tablespoons of finely chopped white onions instead of the shallot. Also, I like to add a couple slices of lemon to the pan when the chicken is cooking to give it a more lemony flavor.  Goes well with Spinach-stuffed mushroom and a salad.

I've been trying to re-create the Chicken Piccata dish from one of my fave restaurants, and this is as close as I've come.  I used regular flour (not true to SB diet), and added a lot more capers.  It also took much longer than 1 minute to reduce the sauce to the proper consistancy. It was delicious and easy enough to make on a weeknight!  Will make this over and over!!!!

This recipe is good, definitely healthy.  The chicken turned out juicy & tender, but I do wish the sauce was a little thicker.  Will make this one again!  VERY EASY!

This recipe was VERY good.  I added some fresh garlic when I grilled the chicken, and to the sauce I added an extra cup of chicken broth, about a teaspoon of cornstarch, a teaspoon of sugar, and some garlic powder.  It took about 5 minutes to cook it down to my desired thickness.  I garnished it with green onions and served it with chicken flavored rice and some corn.  Delicious and Healthy! This one is def. a keeper.

Just okay.  We made this as a pasta dish by cubing the chicken before cooking and serving over whole wheat pasta and it was still pretty bland.  Will try again, but probably will make several alterations.

It smelled fantastic.  Chicken was very juicy, but just a nice alternative to plain ole chicken.  Good to try once, wouldn't bother again.

I really liked the fresh lemon flavor of this dish along with the crispness from browning in whole-wheat flour.  I did add some corn starch for thickening because I thought the sauce was too thin.  I am on the South beach diet, however my family is not so I love to ask how they like a dish and then tell them it was a "special diet" dish to see their reactions.

I found this recipe for a last minute dinner I had to make and it was truly easy and delicious-the chicken was really tender, and everyone loved it.  I couldn't find capers on such short notice, but used green olives instead, and it was really good-if it's better with capers then WOW!

This is the second time I made this recipe and it is delicious. My husband kept asking when I was making it again. We are both on Phase Two of the SBD and this meal is really something to look forward to. Yum Yum!

Why are the reviews so low? Are people afraid to try this because it's got the word "diet" in the header? It is absolutely fantastic! We love it and will make it several times a month. It makes us have HAPPY BELLIES!

At first the sauce didn't smell or look so good so I added a bit of cornstarch and about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and it was great! Make sure you flatten the chicken to cook it faster.

We loved this dish.  I took suggestions from some of the other reviews and added other ingredients. I added garlic, white wine, more capers and broth and some corn starch, and a little sugar.  It was very good and I will definately make this dish again.  It is good enough to serve as an elegant dinner.  I did use the wheat flour and instead of the olive oil, I used peanut oil.  Peanut oil gives a very nice flavor.

I whipped this dish up in a pinch, and the kids loved it.  It also nearly replicates a restaurant favorite.  I substituted onion and a bit of garlic for the shallot, and ap flour for the ww.  I also added some peeled and cubed potatoes to the sauce, which cooked up beautifully in 15 mins.  Thanks!

Very pale and blah in my opinion.
Not anything I would make again.
-Try the Chicken Breasts in Caper Cream Sauce for something truly worth tasting. 
Will not make this again.

Even though the chicken turned out well the sauce was not very good.  I re-read the reviews and I guess the fresh lemon juice makes a difference. I will give it another try.

This was so good it was hard to believe it was good for you!  Unless you "flatten" the chicken breast halves, it takes much longer than 3 minutes on each side.  No matter though - it just took a little longer to cook - it was still easy and still delicious!

Very tasty - My husband was recently put on a low-fat, low sodium diet due to heart disease. It has been a struggle trying to find recipes that he enjoys.  He said this had good flavor even though I had to omit most of the salt.

Very easy, taste amazing. I have made a few changes. I add 2 cloves of fine chopped garlic to the saute process. I also add lemon zest and use white onione (for added flavor) in place of Shallots. I serve with white rice and use the sauce for the rice. This is a huge hit in my family, very kid friendly.

Tried this last night.  It does cook down eventually, but it isn't enough sauce for my taste.  I ended up adding about 2TB of unsalted butter, another 1/4-1/2 cup of broth, waited for it to get nice and bubbly, then added a dusting of flour to help thicken it.  I served it with farfalle and chicken (I cut up the breasts, but prepared in the same was as recipes) all mixed together.  It's good, and a nice change of pace from the dinner rut I was in.  I'll make it again.

This recipe is amazing...my husband and I keep this as one of our 'usuals'. I think this benefits from one more shallot and half the amount of capers since it tends to get a little tart mixed with the lemon juice. Overall fantastic recipe!

I did not think the chicken had much flavor but it did not taste bad either.  We added some chicken and herb flavored rice and it was pretty good.  I will probally make it again if I remember to.

This recipe was outstanding! Everyone loved it, even my 2 and 3 year old children!  The only variation I made was to the sauce, I prefer a thicker sauce that stays on the chicken than a runny sauce, all I did was add 1/4 cup of cold water and 2 TBS. flour to sauce and brought to a boil until thick (make sure to stir constently)I served this dish with oven roasted potatoes and candied acorn squash. Definetly a keeper in my book!

This was delicious over polenta (How To Make Perfect Polenta recipe on this site)! As always, I doubled sauce ingredients but I wished I had tripled it as the sauce was gobbled up. I only had one lemon so I added the zest and juice of the one lemon then had to supplement the rest with bottled juice. I pounded the chicken flat for more uniform size. The sautéing made a bit of a mess, but the results were worthwhile!
