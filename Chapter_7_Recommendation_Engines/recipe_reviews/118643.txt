DELICIOUS !!!  I made this recipe only because I had leftover jarred creamy ranch dressing in my fridge and also happened to have the (Japanese) Panko breadcrumbs (which I've been meaning to try).  I used thin sliced chix breast and cooked for about 18 minutes.  I made the dipping sauce & it was very tasty.  Overall, I think the combination of the panko breadcrumbs and the ranch dressing is what added that extra something to this chicken finger recipe that stands out.  The breadcrumbs made it taste lighter than your usual fingers.  I'll definately make this recipe again - it would be a sure hit as an appetizer at a party - although you'd probably eat so many and not have room for a main course !  Thanks for the recipe Hidden Valley !

ok, this is basically my explanation of how i changed up this recipe, but i thought it was tasty.  instead of the ranch dressing, i dipped chicken strips into dry ranch dressing mix, then into milk/egg, and then into panko bread crumbs, with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika added to panko.  fried them on medium heat in pan with vegetable oil and butter.  yummy!  we used the dipping sauce with it too, with honey instead of brown sugar and it was delicious!

Really good.  The chicken baked up nice and crispy on the outside and super tender on the inside.  I did turn the nuggets halfway through baking time- they would have burned on the bottom otherwise.  I used two chicken breasts and it was plenty for my small family.  The dipping sauce was really good too- I didn't use any brown sugar.  A little time-consuming to cut up the chicken and then dip in the dressing and the crumbs, but that's ok.  The panko crumbs worked so well with this recipe.

So easy, delicous and cheap!! We used Hidden valley Ranch and think that's why this was so yummy. We didn't make the dip that was on the recipe, but made our own. Combined Ranch and Franks Red Hot sauce. It added a little spice. Cannot wait to make again!

I made these last night. I didn't have any panko, so I used bisquick with some season salt. I put them on a baking sheet with non sitck spray then drizzled them with some melted butter. They browned beautifully and were really good. I know this is a little far from the original, but I just thought it was good so I thought I'd share. I really like the idea of dipping them in the ranch first. This is a great recipe.

These are sooo good! I added a little parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs and I cook them in the toaster over (it was a hot summer day) for 25 mins at 350 degrees and I did not have to turn them over! I also added a touch of salt and fresh ground pepper.

It was very simple and easy to prepare and my fiance loved it! I will definately add this to our dinner rotation. Thank you for this recipe!

I was cooking this for a low cal diet and substituted fat free ranch for the reg. ranch and I think it was really good.  My husband and daughter liked it too.  The sauce is really nice, you wouldn't think that ranch and mustard go together well...but it was great!  Will def. make again!!

Tastes great, but the breading was not as crunchy as I would have liked.

I first tried this recipe a few years ago, and it is now a staple for our family.  It is one of our favorite chicken recipes.  We have varied how we prepare the chicken--sometimes we cut strips or about 1.5" chunks, sometimes we leave chicken breasts and just dip each breast half in the ranch dressing and dredge in panko.  For the sauce, we always use the Honey Mustard Dressing II recipe from this site. It is quick and easy to make and I always have the ingredients on hand.

Quick and easy to prepare, but my chicken never got as golden brown as the picture and I had to take it out of the oven before it was overcooked. The dipping sauce just tasted like regular mustard, I couldn't detect any ranch dressing. Next time I'd skip the sauce.

This recipe is a hit at my house!!! My two sons (8 & 4)gobble it up each time I fix it. The combination of the chicken strips & the homemade dip is great!  The recipe is easy & hassle free.  The second time I fixed the recipe I used chicken tenders that were already cut up into strips.  They made the perfect size for little mouths!!

Super easy and the sauce was yummy. I too found myself turning the chix half-way through the cooking process.  Will definitely make again!

I was not a fan of this recipe.  I admit that I am not the best cook, but I was not able to get the chicken to brown properly and they were soggy overall.  Also, the breading came off in the ranch sauce when I dipped the chicken fingers.  I hope others have better luck than I did with this one!

These are super easy and yummy.  Instead of coating the chicken with Ranch I used a buffalo chicken sauce before putting the breading on.  Gave them a great kick!  I struggled to get the breading to stay on the bottom of the strips, but I always seem to have that problem! Really easy and liked by all!

GREAT RECIPE AND WONDERUL FOR PARTIES QUICK AND EASY TO MAKE.  I DID HOWEVER MAKE A CHANGE OR 2.  I USED THE HERB GARLIC CRACKERS FROM RITZ AND CRUSHED THEM AND ROLLED IN THOSE AND ADDED A TBSP. OF EMERIL CAJUN SEASONING IT WAS WONDERFUL.  BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT THIS RECIPE IS A WINNER...A SURE FIRE KEEPER!!! THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!!!

These weren't bad...I read the other ratings and opted to put parchment paper on my baking sheet to avoid the sticking problem.  My husband and I liked these and I'll make them again but don't think they were quite 5-star.

These were delicious, but I had problems. Like MIASMAMA, mine stuck to my cooking-sprayed pan. And like LoveTo Bake, mine didn't get brown, so I finally had to broil them to get them golden & crispy. I didn't make the sauce.

Our entire family loved this chicken!  It was quick and easy, but very good.  I added a little garlic salt, pepper and paprika to my bread crumbs to give it a little more flavor.  This will become a staple recipe at our house!  thanks

wow I had trouble with this.  The coating stuck to the baking sheet.  The taste wasn;t too bad but I had to really amp up the spices and the methods used for this. It made me sad.

My very picky eaters loved this chicken. I left mine in whole breasts instead of making strips, so I had to cook it for loger but it came out delicious. A lot of the reading did fall off, but there was still plenty. Maybe I wont flip it next time so the breading stays on better. It had a great zesty taste and  a nice crispy texture. Tomorrow I'm using the leftovers and mixing it together with fettuccini alfredo and broccoli..it'll go good together. We'll definetly be making this again soon

This was just breaded chicken.  Nothing special...something was a little off to me.  It was easy to throw together...next time I will use chicken tenders and seasoned breadcrumbs.  Cooking time on in my over was WAY shorter than recipe called for.

These were very, very good.  My kids devoured them as did my husband and I.  Very easy, kids helped with that too!!  Easy enough that kids who know there way around a kitchen can make these easily.
