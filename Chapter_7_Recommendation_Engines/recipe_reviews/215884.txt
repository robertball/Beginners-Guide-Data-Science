ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC!!!  This is literally the best pizza I have ever had. Ever. Better than restaurants and carry out.  WOW!! Followed recipe but added these 3 things... 1. Used Jiffy Mix pizza crust (which I highly recommend.)  2. While cooking chicken I added Italian seasoning.  3.  In addition to listed toppings I added tomatoes.  THIS PIZZA ROCKS!!

Great flavor. Loved the black beans on pizza. I added a can of chopped green chilis to the pizza also for some extra kick.

Great pizza!  I used less Alfredo sauce, no chicken, added mushrooms and sliced roma tomatoes.  Easy and delicious!

I didn't use pre-packaged chicken strips, I just sliced up chicken tenders and saute'd them with the garlic. This was spicy but delicious! Will totally be a regular for our pizza nights rotation! :D

I felt this was a little bland, which I could spice up on my own. It just wasn't a "tada" dish. I tend to go for the wow factor with my family, and my hubby said it was more blah.

We weren't thrilled with this pizza.  I made it exactly according to the recipe.  I wouldn't call it bad but in my opinion it wasn't as good as a simple frozen pizza which would cost less and take less time.  It was a good alternative to a typical pizza, just not something I'll ever make again.

I liked the flavor of the pizza (we omitted the jalapenos) but it needed more. Next time we might add some tomatoes and also make our own Alfredo sauce, the canned stuff is a little bland.
