Delicious recipe! We made this twice in the past week. Followed the recipe exactly except we used pork butt instead of shoulder and added a lot more garlic because we love garlic!! Also added some water with the beer since it completely dries up and burnt a little. Nice crisp on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. Will be making this over and over again!

Amazing!!! I followed the recipe and it turned out so good. A few things I used white vinegar since the recipe didn t specify and I did have to add some water to the roasting pan during the second stage of cooking because the beer was almost gone and it started to burn. This was the only Pernil recipe I could find the didn t require overnight marinating. Since this amount of lag time isn t always possible I searched until I found a recipe that did not call for the extra time for marinating. It really turned out perfect; juicy flavorful and tender.

I did everything the directions said. I used my own season measurements and cooked it for a little longer because mine was a 12 pounder as to the 9 pounds the directions called for.

I make it frequently. Never used a lime but it's a good idea for moist pork. Also, no beer.   Slow cooking in oven with a little water at the bottom under the rack, it's perfect.
