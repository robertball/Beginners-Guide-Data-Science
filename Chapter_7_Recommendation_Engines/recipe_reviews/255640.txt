I made this Mom's creamy stew almost as the recipe says. I did improvise a bit but other wise, it was the same. It was sooooo good.   I don't like cilantro so I didn't use 
that . I did use the cream. Never did that before. What a great look and taste it gave the stew.
I will definitely make this again.

Made as written except I waited to add the peas in the last 5 minutes of cooking so that they would hold their bright  green color. This was good and I really enjoyed all of the fresh veggies but it was in need of herbs  in my opinion. Maybe some oregano, thyme, or parsley? I absolutely love cilantro and very much enjoyed it as a garnish to this soup but I'm not sure everyone would agree with me on this. If you're not a big fan of cilantro I suggest replacing it with fresh parsley instead. All in all this was a good soup but I would add some herbs or maybe even a bay leaf if I were to make it again.

Came out very good. Left out the mushrooms and didnâ€™t do cilantro either. Was slightly lacking as far as flavor, definitely needs some spices. All in all, very yummy and easy to prepare. Will make again. :)

I loved the flavor. The only thing I did differently was omit the mushrooms and I cooked the chicken in the pressure cooker instead of the skillet. I'll make again.
