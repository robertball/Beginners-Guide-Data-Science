I received a lot of compliments on this.  I used a box brownie mix for this (cuts way back on the preparation time); for the mint topping, I only used 1 cup of powdered sugar for the 1/2 cup of butter, and instead of creme de menthe used 1 1/2 tsp of mint extract.  This made it not too sweet.  After it cooled in the fridge applied the chocolate topping,then placed back into fridge overnight and brought into work next morning.  Coworkers loved it.

I've been making these brownies since I was 12.  Yummy and rich!  However, I don't melt the butter for the mint layer, I cream it with the powdered sugar which makes it fluffy.  Then I add a few drops of green food coloring so people can tell it's mint-flavored.

I used a teaspoon of mint extract instead of creme de menthe.  Quite tasty.

After reading the reviews I made a few changes and came out with an incredible brownie.  People were grabbing these and just inhaling them.  One friend, a die-hard, no-cheat, low-carber had 2!  I used my own fudgey brownie recipe, chilled it.  Topped with with the mint frosting (my Reese brand creme de menthe was not very minty even with 4 Tbsp, next time I'll use a touch of mint extract also) - be sure and chill this well, it helps the next layer spread.  I tried melting my chocolate twice (once melting the butter separately), but both times they appeared to "seize."  But, I just used it (both actually) on top and it was fine once chilled.  I would recommend spreading a small area of chocolate at a time or your chocolate will chill too fast and will be really hard to spread.

These brownies are the best!!I added 1 tsp. peppermint extract to the filling instead of liquer,and a few drops of green food coloring for looks. Also for the frosting, melted 3/4 c. choc chips with 1/2 c. whipping cream. I baked them for 45 minutes and they came out perfect.

i cannot even begin to express how excited i am to find this recipe!  my friend's hubby recently bought a batch for $24(!!!) at a fundraiser and she served them to us at a playdate at her house.  we all flipped out over them.  i've been bugging her husband to get the recipe from the person who baked these, but no success so far.  on a whim, i decided to do a search on this site and allrecipes.com came thru for me once again!  thank u, thank u, thank u!  the only thing different about the batch i tasted was that there were chocolate chips in the brownies and the middle layer frosting was tinted green. thank u soooo much, s. hynek!
love,
hina

This was fabulous!  I used our favorite boxed mix and then made the topping.  I subsituted 1-1/2 tsp of mint extract for the creme de menthe.  I also melted the chips in the micro.  I was unsure who this would work but it was so easy.  Added butter to chips - micro for 1 min. on power level 5.  Stir.  Micro for 30 secs on power level 5. Stir. And lastly, micro 30 more secs.  WOW!  No rating I described talked about the combonation of textures here - the moist brownie on the bottom with a cream filling in the center and then finished with semi-sweet chocolate crust!  Truely delectable!

These brownies are absolutely awesome! Husband tried one, and looked like he'd died and gone to heaven... I topped them off with some chopped white choc chips. Very pretty! I think these would also be good with orange flavoring instead of mint. I know Husband will be asking for these again. Thanks for posting!

I had to cook the batter for about 40 minutes and I made a double batch of both the mint layer and chocolate frosting. This recipe is excellent and I will definitely make it again for the holidays.

These were okay but before attempting, please do not expect fudgy brownies. The texture was more on the cake-y side, but the frosting is very rich. I went a little overboard with the mint extract ( I subbed mint extract- which is more concentrated- for the mint liqueur). The mint layer was borderline toothpaste-y! OOPS! Overall, great taste.

This recipe was "melt in your mouth" delicious.  I was hurried for time, so cheated and used a package brownie mix for the bottom and substituted mint flavoring and green food coloring for the middle layer.  I will absolutely make again using the brownie mix.  I could have eaten the whole pan myself!

A big hit around our house.  I did use a box of brownie mix and mint flavoring rather than creme de menthe.  The result was wonderful.

These are to die for.  Definitely the biggest hit at any party I bring them to.  For an added touch I used a drop of red food coloring in the minty topping for this valentine's day.  Green would be fitting too.  I also replaced the creme de menthe with 1.5 tsp. of mint extract (+ 2 Tbsp. + 1.5 tsp. water to make up for the loss of liquid).

This recipe is very good, however the "brownie" part really is more like cake, and it can get a little gummy (probably due to the syrup).  Also, I have to agree with many others, I had to bake the brownie layer for almost an hour.  I put it in for 25 min., then an extrat 10, then an extra 5, it still wasn't done, so I just kept an eye on it until it was.  Realistically, the baking time should be listed as 45 minutes.

These are totally incredible. I had made this recipe years ago and lost it, so happy to see it here! The only changes I made:  1) Had to bake brownies for about 40 minutes to get them done, and they were perfect. 2) Did not melt-- only softened-- butter for the mint layer. 3) used mint extract (about 1 tsp) instead of creme de menthe.  Excellent, thank you!  I'm eating one right now. :-)

My fiance and I recently made these and they turned out pretty well - not as moist as we had hoped but good nonetheless.  We added walnuts to the brownie batter for a nice addition.  That being said, we'd make them again for another get together.

These took at least 45 minutes to bake all the way through . And I used 1 tsp of mint extract in the frosting and it was too much, all you could taste was mint. Next time I will put in 1/2 tsp at most. At the very least I'm willing to give this recipe one more try.

A huge hit with my family this Christmas! I will make them again, but I will almost double the amount of creme de menthe in the icing. The brownies are so rich, you need more mint flavor for it to show up well.

These were very moist and tasty, but I had to cook them for 45 minutes.  When I opened the oven after 25 minutes, the brownies were still soupy!  I served them to guests at a party and one friend said that they were the best brownies that he had ever tasted.  I don't agree that they are the best ever, but they were very good and I will make them again.

I used the Ghiradelli Triple Chocolate mix as the base, one of the best packaged brownie mixes ever!  I didn't melt the butter, just let it come to room temp and mixed it with the powdered sugar to make it fluffy.  I added 1 1/2 tsp. peppermint extract and no food coloring.  Finally, I chilled the brownies before adding the chocolate topping.  This was a huge birthday hit for a friend who loves mint chocolate.

Really nice brownies. Super moist, even after a few days. Everyone loved them. My only tiffs were that they were quite sweet, and that there were a lot of fattening ingredients (I know, I know, it's a brownie recipe ... but still!). I replaced half of the white sugar with brown sugar.

I thought these were just ok. If I were to make them again I would probably halve the minty layer. There was just too much.

Actually, more like 3 1/2 stars.
This tasted pretty good. It was a little rubbery and cake-like, but otherwise it tasted pretty good. I probably will not make this again.
Thanks.

The two toppings are great. Would use them on my own brownie recipe though. I might try making the chocolate topping with the new mint flavored chocolate chips next time to give this even more minty flavor.

I made these for Christmas this year, and many of my relatives declared it an instant favorite. It was quite easy. They cut nicely into squares and came out of the pan easily. I added a bit of green food coloring to the mint layer to make it look the part. I'll definitely use this one again.

You might want to put a little less mint extract than the recipe calls for.  The mint taste is very strong, which turned my brothers off to them.  Another suggestion: try making the brownies in a cupcake pan, filling cups about 2/3 full and cooking about 20 minutes.

I have no clue what I did wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly, and these are the strangest brownies I've ever had.  The taste is okay, but the texture was that of a sponge.  I've never seen that before, and it was very strange eating it.  I expect my brownies to be dense, and moist.  I don't know if that is normal for this recipe or not.  I was really surprised due to all the good reviews.  Anyway, I'm giving it three stars, but only because the taste is decent.  

Oh and another thing, the cooking time was way off.  I cooked per the recipe for 25 minutes, when I took it out of the oven, I almost spilled the contents, because it was like a swimming pool of chocolate.  Nothing cooked at all!  I had to cook for another 30 minutes, and then it was fine.  

I don't think I'll try this recipe again.

Variation: "Candy cane brownies" i used 1 tsp peppermint extract and a couple of drops red food coloring to make a pink peppermint filling.  I then sprinkled crushed starlight mints (candy canes would be good too) over the very top layer.  Excellent and lovely!! Cut into small bars b/c very rich and satisfying. i also used a brownie mix due to time contraints.

After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant in making the brownie from this recipe but am glad I did.  It was excellent but did require an extra 20-25 minutes cooking time.  Next time I will add more mint extract- a teaspoon wasn't quite enough.  It received rave reviews from co-workers.  The only downfall is that this does take some time to prepare.

These were a bit of a pain with three steps.  I don't think the mint flavor was strong enough, but the chocolate flavor was HEAVY!  Not what I was looking for.

Cooked for about 40 minutes and the brownies were moist and fudgey, the way I love them!  I used 1 T. of butter with the chips for the chocolate icing, with about 1 1/2 T milk to cut fat.  Delicious!  Made for a chocolate shell like topping.  Drink with a glass of milk.  Wonderful impressive recipe!

After the suggested baking time these were still liquidy. I cooked them for 25 more minutes and they were still very squishy. 

However, they were absolutely delicious. I will certainly make them again!

Tastes like a rich "Texas sheet cake" brownie with a subtle touch of creamy mint.
These brownies are worthy as a present themselves; I baked these as a birthday gift.

An even easier mint topping is to use mini peppermint patties- top hot brownies with peppermint patties, allow to melt and spread over top of brownies, cool and cut.  (may need to return to oven for a minute or two to melt).

my family has been in love with this recipe for several years now, and my husband and his family now love them as well.  the brownies are so moist that they will last for a while - if you can keep them that long!  they lasted at least a few days with all nine of us kids, because they are so rich!

Maybe it didn't taste as great as it could be b/c I used mint extract.  I didn't really like the way the middle and top layer easily melted and got sticky.  Maybe it's b/c of the pure butter base.

I made quite a few changes.  I made the brownie as the recipe stated.  However, I didn't do the top chocolate layer with the chocolate chips.  I topped the brownie with the frosting layer using  peppermint extract and green food coloring instead of the creme de menthe.  I did have to use 1-2 Tbsp half and half to make it spread better.  It still was a nice frosted brownie with a fun flare of mint.

I followed the recipe exactly how it was and they came out great. I took these into work and the girls absolutely love them. I've made this recipe twice now and it's definitely a favorite of mine.

Ok so I made this.  Obviously I missed a step because the top layer is a crumble and not flat chocolate.  The extra chips I just threw on top because I am still looking for the extra butter.   Lol!  Couldn't be bothered at this point.  Brownie crumble it is.

These brownie's were surprisingly easy to make, they came out really moist.  I wanted to take a picture of them, but before I could my friends had devoured them. Next time, I'll make a double batch. I got one and it was yummy! Thanks for the recipe.
