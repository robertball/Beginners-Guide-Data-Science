Very tasty salad.  Sweet like a coleslaw.  I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I think I put in a bit more broccoli, used red wine vinegar, and I heeded the warning of others and went easy on the onion.  I found that just after I mixed it up, the onion was very strong.  I made it up the evening before I was going to use it, and the next day, the onion flavor was barely noticeable.  I ended up adding more onion.  I think that either the vinegar or the mayo chemically "cooked" the onion and mellowed it out.  With this salad, I would say that it's important that it sit for at least a few hours in the refrigerator before serving to let the onions settle down.

This is a great recipe and is almost identical to one I've been making for years.  I only use 1/4 of the red onion, otherwise it is too strong for our taste; also, I use sunflower seeds and apple cider vinegar instead of almonds and white wine vinegar.  For an absolutely awesome pasta salad, add (2) 9-oz. pkgs. of cheese-filled tortellini, cooked al dente, then well-drained and cooled.  It makes a terrific picnic and potluck pasta salad and always gets rave reviews.

This is an awesome salad. I do tweek it a bit. I use golden raisins or red grapes instead of raisin. I also use 1/4 cup sour cream with 3/4 cup mayo, to lighten the dressing a bit. It is an awesome salad that always gets raves and devoured very time I serve it. My dutch friends have never had a dish like this and always request I bring this to their BBQ parties.  This is a wonderful salad.

I love this salad!  I have made many adjustments at different times, but my rating is based on this recipe as written.  I just don't understand why people will rate a recipe when they have modified nearly every ingredient!

Very good recipe, however, I did make a few modifications.  I used turkey bacon, dried cranberries and sunflower seeds in place of the bacon, raisins & almonds.  I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, and used Balsamic vinegar.  My husband, who won't touch a raisin and thought he didn't like dried cranberries, asked for seconds!!  Next time I will try it with reduced fat mayonaise.

A WONDERFUL recipe!  Over these many years this has become one of my family's traditional Christmas dinner salads.  I use red-wine vinegar, hot water "plumped" golden raisins and toasted sunflower seeds.  "Wheat berries" are also a good choice to use in this salad.  You can prepare everything a day ahead, refrigerate in a plastic bag with a towel in the bottom--to keep the vegetables crisp, and assemble just before serving--my option, to save last-minute preparation time.  [This year, 2003, I used cashew nuts and my family said it was the best I had ever made!]

Very versatile and portable, used diet mayo, the raisins really add to it but soften by running under hot water in a sieve to plump them up.
Healthy and Yummy!!  Got too happy with the bulk food section and bought too many almonds and raisons and sprinkled them on top, looked REALLY good!

FABULOUS!!!!!! Next time, I will reduce the amount of the sugar or use Splenda. I thought it was a tad sweet but oh so good. I cannot wait to make this again for friends and can see this becoming a mainstay at BBQ's and potlucks. Looks so pretty too. I have to admit I just had some for breakfast and even the leftovers were great. Also, used real bacon bits instead of frying some up and ready cut up fresh broccoli from Sams Club. Saved a lot of prep time.

This salad is always a crowd pleaser...the secret is to drop the broccoli into boiling water for a few seconds and then into ice water....the broccoli's appearance and taste is much better!!!

This recipe is similar to the same delicious broccoli salad recipe I use.  My version has red wine vinegar, which is delicious. This salad is always the first to go at potlucks, and you will always be asked for the recipe!

A family favorite for many years, though I do change it up from time to time.  Sub cranraisins for the raisins, trade almonds for toasted sunflower seeds, change the red onions to green onions.  Definitely try adding red grapes sliced in half for a little something extra.  As this recipe is so very versatile, it's easy to change to your own family's preferences.  Great for bbq's and potlucks as it holds it's texture without becoming soggy ~ enjoy!

This is the recipe I was looking for!  THANKYOU!
I've made it totally according to and it was delicious! I have also made it to be "diet friendly" by replacing sugar with "Splenda" (sugar substitute) and Fat Free Miracle Whip.  It tasted the same and made some of the dieters at our family gathering very happy!

Love it, love it, love it!  Everyone at our BBQ loved it and many asked for the recipe.  I mixed the mayo/vinegar/sugar with the red onions the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight.   I then added the other ingredients the morning of.  This kept the broccoli fresh (not soggy) but helped the onions relax.  It tasted perfect!!  Just a side note - I added golden raisins and roasted sunflower seeds.

Interesting none of the reviews mentioned that if you blanch your broccoli for just a minute it will stay a beautiful bright green color that is so much more appetizing even a few days later if you are lucky enough to have around that long!

This is a really awesome salad! I made this twice in a couple days and I have to say it was much better with a little revision for my taste.  This recipe is PERFECTLY fine the way it is! I made it to the exact specifications of the recipe the first time, and then remade it with what I thought it needed. I changed the mayo for half yogurt, half low fat mayo combo because it gives it a little something extra and balances out the flavors.  I reduced the sugar the second time by just a tad over 1/4 of a cup.  I liked the original recipe but it was really sweet and the raisins were really sweet so it started to be overly sweet.  Finally, the onion is fine, let it sit in the refrigerator for at least 15 hours. I understand what the others are saying with the onion initially but after about 15 hours, it's hardly noticeable!   The vinegar mellows out the flavor and you can hardly taste it! If you want an even more delicate onion flavor I've also seen this recipe with shallots. Hope this helps! :)

I am hard to please and afraid of watery mayo based salads- BUT.  This was the most delicious salad I have ever had.  I placed my broccoli in boiling water for 30 secs and shocked it in ice water, then drained it. (This made it crunchy yet tender, and bright green)  I also used craisins and sunflower seeds...and a TBL of Splenda instead of all the sugar (which was PLENTY).  I only had raspberry wine vinegar which was fantastic. OH, and I used a splash of lemon juice to brighten it up.  I think there are a lot of different ways you can go with this salad.  I could have eaten the entire bowlful!  This would be a hit at any potluck or as a cooling side dish in the summer.  WONDERFUL

Very plain. And way too many onions. Would be better with a few modifications. Less sugar, less onion, and some salt.

I love this recipie and often make it.  Try making it the night before and let all the flavors mix... however, and this is important, DO NOT add the bacon until you are ready to serve.  The bacon sitting in the dressing for any long periods of time just becomes limp and slimmy.  The crisp bacon put on just before serving adds zing and the crunch with the broccoli is perfect!!   A little ranch dressing thrown in is also a nice touch...

Everyone loved this salad! I made it for a retirement party and ended up having to email the recipe to 30 people. I made some changes based on what I had in the house - used red grapes instead of raisins, real bacon bits from a bag instead of bacon and apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. I also added an extra tbsp each of sugar and vinegar to the dressing, along with some salt and pepper. It's such a quick salad to throw together and so nice and light, I've now started making it for lunch or dinner side dishes. It's even great without the bacon. Thanks for the recipe!!

This salad is really fresh and healthy and was a big hit at the BBQ!

I used 2 cut apples in place of raisins, which aren't my favorite; blended 1/2 mayo & 1/2 plain greek yogurt; used lime juice instead of white wine vinegar; substituted 1 small scoop stevia instead of the sugar.  I also added salt & pepper and a nice dash of Bragg's amino acids, which in my opinion adds a dash of delicious mystery to any dish.

I'll be making this again!

I haven't made this recipe yet, but it sounds delicious and I will make it when I go to the store for brocolli. Here's something that helps me.  I cut the raw bacon into small pieces with scissors before I fry it.  Doing it like that you get nice crunchy small pieces instead of crumbling it after where the pieces are different sizes and not so crunchy.

This was very yummy.  I made it for a cookout for my sons birthday party.  Everyone loved it.  I did make one mistake.........I made it the night before and the broccoli wasn't as crunchy as I would have liked it, but it was still a hit.  I will make again.

This salad is similar to one my Mother used to make.  I have been living overseas for a few months and wanted to bring something different to a BBQ than the Germans normally eat.  I ended up writing out the recipe 5 times and it was the only salad that was gone by the end of the bbq!  It's delicious with a great combo of crunchy textures and the sugar and raisins add the right amount of sweetness.  Don't change a thing, make this recipe as is!

We use sunflower seeds and cider vinegar instead of white vinegar and do not put bacon in our version.  Can use fat free mayo when dieting.

I change it by using dried cranberries and sliced almonds.  Gets raves and disappears every time I serve it!

This is one of my favorite salads.  At Christmas, I like to substitute dried cranberries for the raisins to give it a festive holiday feel.

totally delish! changes i made were to use less mayo cuz i didn't have enuf (3/4c lo-fat), sugar (2 heaping tblspns equal) & vinegar (1 tblspn).  having done that i think it would be better with the full cup as i definitely used 2 large heads of broccoli and it could have been a bit more wet.  however, everything else i did as instructed and it was sooooo good!  i totally recommend making a day ahead, without the bacon, so the flavors can really marry (and the broccoli can soften a bit).  since i like the bacon crisp i would add just before serving.  i'm eating some now that i made sunday and it so good and healthy i don't feel a bit guilty eating a ginormous bowl.  try it, you'll love it!

Very good. I modified the salad because we are not mayo, raisin, or red onion fans:  subbed chopped green onion for the red onion, cashews for the almonds (as well as added one cup), subbed Hidden Valley Ranch dressing for the mayo mixture (amount to your taste). I also sub turkey bacon once in a while and sometimes add in frozen peas. I let the salad sit for at least a couple of hours before serving. You can also sub cauliflower for the broccoli.

This is amazingly delicious!! I made it for my luncheon group & it was devoured. I had little to bring home, & my husband loved it, so I made more the next day. I use Splenda instead of sugar to keep the carbs down & added walnuts & slivered almonds. A great hit I will make again!

I love this sweet/tangy salad.  I substituted sunflower seeds for the almonds, and used golden raisins. I'm taking this to our family's Labor Day cookout.  It will be a perfect accompanyment to the ribeye's and garlic bread.

Wonderful!  Just as delicious with broccoli coleslaw.
Next time, I will also try substituting greek yogurt for the Miracle Whip ( which I used because Fam does not like Mayo). Thi is definitely a keeper.

This is a really good salad.  One suggestion, if you are pressed for time, which I always am, use the premade bacon.  Saves you time and a messy pan.

I made this recipe for company, unfortunately both of them did not like broccoli, so they never even tasted it. At the time I was disapointed, but now I'm thankful, because I have eaten the left overs for supper, breakfast and lunch since. I honestly cannot get enough of it. My husband loves it as well. I can't wait to make this for people who will taste it. I think even people who don't like broccoli would like it if they gave it a chance. I did make one substitution to the recipe by adding cauliflower, and ommitting some of the broccoli.

This recipe is very simple and is a great idea for potlucks. I've had this at potlucks and was always curious as to how it was made. Now I know! I made it with red wine vinegar as some others had suggested. My only complaint about this dish is that it has a strong after taste.

Yum, yum, yummmmmmy.  I used roasted sunflower seeds instead of almond slices, cutback on the sugar by 1/4 cup, and added a 1/4 cup more raisins than was called for.  I spend the whole day going back to the fridge to steal bites with my fork.

This recipe was delicious!  I didn't have raisins on hand so I left them out.  I thought there was too much sugar so I'll cut in half next time.  The flavor is much better after it sits for a while.

I've been making this for a few years now.  This is too much raw onion for me -- so I use about 1/4 the amount shown in this recipe.  I also plump the raisins before adding, and throw in a can of slivered water chestnuts for added texture. To save calories I use Splenda instead of sugar and light mayo (and no one knows the difference). Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

Calorie Cutter: This recipe is easy and delicious! I love that you don't blanch the broccoli, so that it retains more nutritional value. I substituted Olive oil mayo for regular mayo, Splenda for the sugar, and turkey bacon ... reducing the fat and calories extensively. And No one noticed -- they still raved! Enjoy!!

My family raved about this salad! All I did was decrease the sugar to 1/4 cup and mayo to 1/2 cup. I never saw broccoli go so fast. Needless to say next time I will double the recipe.

Definitely reduce the amount of Sugar.  I only used 1/4 cup and it was still sweet.  Also -- i would reduce the onion to only 1/2 an onion.  It was overpowering -- but a great recipe

GREAT salad!  It tastes awesome.  I made it for a potluck gathering and it got rave reviews.  The only downside is that it does not keep overnight - the tiny bit of leftover that I had the next day was soggy....

Very Yummy Broccoli Salad.  I change it up a little and substitute sunflower seeds for the nuts and dried sweetened cranberries (Craisins) for the raisins, which makes for a very colorful salad.  I decrease the sugar a little to compensate for the sweeter craisins.

I make this with peanuts or cashews (instead of almonds) with good results.  Low carb (use splenda) and tastes wonderful! Do not use an entire onion- 1/2 of a red onion or too oniony.

This recipe is perfection!  I served it for our neighbors and was told it was the best salad they had ever tasted.  No one likes raisins though, so I added some sweet red peppers instead and used cashews for the nuts.   I also added one cup of shredded cheddar cheese because I know other people who have made it that way in the past. The flavors blended wonderfully, and the salad just gets better as the hours pass.

With no bacon and onion, it is still delicious! My husband never liked broccoli, but tasked this and got hooked! :-)

Very good salad but I would recommend blanching the broccoli prior to mixing.

I saw this recipe in my allrecipes newsletter and looked at the bag of broccoli & cauliflower florets I had just purchased and realized hey, I can make it with broccoli & cauliflower!
I used rice wine vinegar, reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup added dried cherries instead of raisins and wanted to use sunflower seeds but only had sliced almonds.  DH & DD loved the salad.  
I prefer rice wine vinegar because it is not so vinegar sour and probably has more sugar. 
Next time I will try 1-2 Tbls. instead of by cup standard.
The dried cherries gave it lots of sweetness too.
THIS RECIPE IS A KEEPER!

This was WAY good.  I loved it and so did my family.  I made enough for 20 servings and reduced sugar by 2/3 cup.  The perfect amount of sweetness.

This was wonderful and delicious! I added more mayo because it seemed like not enough liquid, but after sitting overnight I wished I didn't! It makes it's own liquid. I waited to put the bacon in till right before serving so it wouldn't get soggy.

This is exactly the recipe I was looking for.  The flavors are great and measurements were spot on.  I like to use sunflower seeds instead of the almonds.  It's good with the raisins, but I actually prefer it without.

This was a big winner, even tho our Cardinals lost...Boy was I glad I TRIPPLED the recipe for the Super Bowl party yesterday.  Mine was the ONLY salad/veggie at a party with a good 25 people.  It got scarfed.  I did modify a little.  Based on a couple of other suggestions, I added extra Vinegar--DON'T!! it made the dressing turn very watery while it chilled for 3 hours.  Next time I will follow the measurements.  I used half Sour cream and half mayo and it was lighter and tastier too.  I used Cranberries, sunflower kernals, and for this triple batch I added most of a whole bunch of sliced celery for extra crunch and a bit over 3T of Sweet Hungarian Paprika from Penzeys.  Also some grinds of fresh blk pepper, and replaced half the sugar with Equal (the blue stuff) I had a really large red onion and it smelled pretty strong when I cut it, so I diced it really small, and blanched it under running water from my little boiling water tap--30 seconds max, then shocked under cold...I also used a total of only o1 lb of bacon to six big bundles of brocolli--no one complained there wasn't enough bacon.  I bought the cranberries dried at my local store in bulk and the sunflower seeds that way too.  Brocolli was on sale and I made a huge vat of salad (probably about 3 gallons) for under $20. Everyone asked for the recipe and even the men went back for seconds.  All I had was some juice and stray sunflower seeds left.  Will make again fore sure and will try All Equal instead of sugar next.

Pure heaven! This is became an instant favorite at my family's Thanksgiving dinner. I doubled everything, but only used one onion (otherwise it'll be sooo onion-y). The mayo came in 15oz or extra large, and since I have no use for mayo, the 15oz worked fine! Maybe I had small broccoli, or just because I love broccoli, I ended up using twice as much (which was 4x the original, lol, or about 9 crowns). This is fantastic; it does have 5 stars all around for a reason!! note: I made it the night before and let it set in the fridge. Then tossed it in the morning, and tossed it again before serving. The 'slaw-esque' mixture will settle on the bottom!

This is a very good recipe for the tried-and-true broccoli salad.  I substituted green onion for red, dried cranberries for raisins, and almost doubled the bacon.  It was delicious!

This salad is FANTASTIC. Served it at a beach picnic this summer and both kids and adults loved its sweetness. I used Miracle Whip instead of real mayo; worked fine. They were begging for more at dinnertime!

Wow!  This is delicious!  We cooked up the onion slightly before combining with the rest of the ingredients, added walnuts instead of almonds, and reduced mayo to 3/4 cup.  Next time we will try red grapes in place of raisins (I'm not a big fan of the raisin).

This is a great recipe.  Easy to make and a family favorite.  To cut down on the fat and also on sugar, I substituted Tastefully Simple's Bacon Bacon for the bacon, used 1/2 light mayo and 1/2 mayo and used splenda in place of the sugar.

Delicious! I have been searching for this broccoli salad for a long time and this is it! It is exactly the same recipe as a broccoli salad that is served at a restaurant in this area. I have always wondered how they made it. 

Unfortunately, I did not have sunflower seeds or bacon, but it didn't even matter. I used golden raisins and regular mayo. I also used 'gourmet salad vinegar' by Heinz and it was perfect. I chilled it for 3 hours before serving.

Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe. I will definitely make it again...and again...and again!!

So tasty!  I up the health factor by using chow mein noodles instead of bacon.  I've also served it without raisins for my picky children.  Either way, still delicious!

Time Saving Tip: A half bag of Costco's broccoli florets is equivalent to two heads of broccoli.  I made 3 batches of this recipe for a party, not because I was really interested in a broccoli salad, but because of the positive reviews.  Oh my gosh, it is amazing! Probably the bacon! And yes,every bite is gone!

Blanch the broocoli for 5 minutes and cool. Add shredded carrots. Use seasonal sweet onions instead of red onions. Walnuts and dried cranberries great substitutes also.

Delicious. I added sunflower seeds instead of almonds. Decided to go light on the onion and dressing. I got a little nervous about the dressing but once it was all combined, it was fantastic.

Really good salad, but for my personal taste the amounts of sugar and mayonnaise this recipe calls for were too high. To get a lighter dressing,  I used natural yoghurt  with 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise and 2 "flat" tablespoons of sugar (I did not change the amount of vinegar). It might also be a good option for those who count calories or have to watch their cholesterol!

This salad was great!! I followed the advice of others and made the dressing ahead of time and added the red onion to it so the onion could settle down a bit. I substituted sunflower kernels for almonds and craisins for the raisins because those are what I had on hand. Served it at a church gathering and many requested the recipe. Thanks!

Excellent side dish. It's best made ahead, but in a pinch still tastes good right before, just use very little onion. Regularly when making  ahead I only use about 1/4 cup onion.

Used chopped cashews instead of almonds and red wine vinegar instead of white, cause that's what I had.  Forgot to par boil the broccoli as I originally wanted as per a previous reviewer's suggestion, but it was still magnificent!  I will definitely make this again!  I made a little batch on the side with turkey bacon for my boyfriend that doesn't eat pork and it was good as well!  Great recipe!  Dressing is perfect!

Great recipe! Perfect standard recipe for customization. Have made this many times, using prosciutto in place of bacon, cranberries in place of raisins and creme fraiche in place of mayo as suggested by previous users. Found the sugar unnecessary, was great just the way it was. Thanks for a great add to my recipe box! ;-)

Perfect base for a delicious broccoli salad - we added mandarin orange segments and used Trader Joe's orange champagne muscat vinegar.  Used lowfat mayo and evened things out by adding an extra head of broccoli... yum!  Kept it simple with pre-cooked bacon and just diced it into the salad.  Cashews instead of almonds this time - maybe it'll be pecans next time.

When I make this salad, I cut up the broccoli, and don't add onion or bacon, as I don't miss it.  But instead , I add 1/4 C raisins, 1/4 C walnuts, and 1/4 C salted sunflower seeds.  I also cut down on the sugar to 1/4 C. By not putting the bacon in, this is a complete protein, because of the nuts, fruits and seeds.  The flavor is absolutely awesome. Great for vegans.

We cheated when we had to take this to a picnic.  We bought all the parts and put then in a big bowl and tossed.  The dressing we used was a vidalia sweet onion dressing.  It was pretty yummy and everyone loved it!

This was excellent.  I've made it with sunflower seeds in the past but have found that it is much better with slivered almonds.

I've been doing a similar recipe for years. It's great for baby or bridal showers. It helps to blanch the raisins first by soaking them in boiling water for 5-8 minutes right before you add them to the salad. It makes them soften and plump up. I also prefer the applecider vinegar and sunflower seeds instead of almonds.

I use 1/4 cup sugar in the dressing. I also use craisins in place of raising. Craisins make the salad so pretty and taste great also. This is my son's favorite salad and I make it for him when he and his family visits. YUM!!

I have been wanting to try this for some time and finally got around to making it. It is so delicious! My mother n law makes it all the time but she doesn't use recipes so I found this one. It tasted just like hers. I didn't change a thing. Can't wait to make again...

For  BBQ's our family usually make a plain salad and no one ever eats it, so I tried this and it was such a huge hit  it was gone. I have modified it for everyday use to make it healthier by using lean bacon or turkey bacon, low fat cheddar cheese, a sugar substitute and no fat mayonnaise, and for a touch of sweet dried cranberry's (I don't care for raisins). This is such a great recipe and so easy plus it gets people to eat there veggies.

I used to love this salad when my work had it on it's lunch line in the 90s and have found a recipe that is pretty darn close to what I remember, but my taste buds have obviously changed. Too sweet and too much dressing. Not enough broccoli and way too heavy of a dressing--there's a hint of freshness, but it's hard to decipher through all the dressing.

Unbelievably easy and super tasty! I have been using this recipe for over 5 years now and it's still a huge hit in our house. The only adjustment I make is to use 1/2 or 2/3 of a red onion instead of a whole, depending on the size of the onion. Last time I made it, I had run out of white wine vinegar and substituted apple cider vinegar and it was still great. This is a fairly sweet salad but it has us shoveling broccoli, so I don't have an issue with that! Those who are not big on sweet salads may want to lighten the sugar.

We made the dressing using 1 cup of Hellman's mayo but it had a funny aftertaste. So we added 1/4 cup of sour cream and another tablespoon of white wine vinegar and it's PERFECT! This is an awesome tasting recipe!

What a perfect way to eat a superfood!  Everyone loved this salad, maybe even more than the ribs we served it with.  Definitely worth the time/effort it takes to fry up a little bacon.

I had everything ready except the dressing, and that's when I realized I only had about 1/4 C of mayo left. Oops! I went with it and decreased the sugar and vinegar a bit, and it still turned out great. Very light and quite a bit healthier than the original. Next time I might use about 1/2 C mayo for a richer flavor that is still a little healthier than the original recipe. Like others, I used sunflower seeds and skipped the bacon due to personal preference. I also used plain white vinegar. I think shredded carrots would be good in here too.

My mother and grandmother make this recipe often.  We substitute unsalted sunflower seeds for the almonds and red wine vinegar for the white wine vinegar, but I had tried it this way and it is equally as good!  Be sure you let it sit in the refrigerator for a few hours to let the flavors meld together.

I love broccoli salad-- but hate to buy it at the store because they use too much mayo and the fat kind. I always use fat free or light mayo, and then I don't feel guilty. Really, it's just to keep everything sticking together and a little creamy. I don't notice the difference, except around the waistline!

WOW. This was fantastic!!!! Be sure to let the dressing sit for a few hours to allow the sugar to dissolve properly.   We make it with pine-nuts insstead of nuts.  I also slightly steam the broccoli now to brighten the color & soften it a tad.

Wonderful salad; used craisins and apple cider vinegar; a little more brocoli and a little less bacon. This salad is really user-friendly. Is very forgiving of adjustments. Best salad ever.

FABULOUS recipe.  Because of onion this is best if made the night before to sit in refrigerator.  If you do this you don't need to change the recipe.  I used a whole medium size onion and it's potenancy lessened overnight.  I served this to 12 women for Bunco night.  They loved it and everyone wanted the recipe.  Using bacon fried up and drained on a paper towel makes a huge difference.  I tried bacon bits on my 2nd use of the recipe and it just wasn't quite as good.  I have done almonds once and cashews once.  Either works great

You can save time by using pre-made slaw dressing (lite is fine). Adding dried cranberries instead of raisins give a hint of tartness that tastes great.

This is a delicious salad that I have made for family and friends many times.  I have altered it by utting down on the bacon, even eliminating it sometimes when I want to watch our fat intake, using low fat mayonnaise, and adding seedless red grapes and sunflower seeds instead of the almonds.  The longer the salad sits, the more liquid comes out of the vegetables, but it still tastes great.  My 10 year daughter will eat this without urging!

This was really good...I changed it a bit by substituting a diced apple for the raisins, left out the almonds (although I think it sounds good...I was just out), and I only used 1/4 C sugar.  Also, instead of using the red onions raw, I cooked them in the bacon grease until they were just tender; that way they werent too overwhelming.  My father in law who hates broccoli, loved this salad!

EASY, EASY, EASY. I have substituted the sugar with Splenda. Works great. Use the prepackaged broccoli florets & precooked bacon to cut the already short prep time in half!!

This salad is very popular in California.  This recipe is great--I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins and sunflower seeds for the almonds.  If you are in a hurry--it is easy to use store bought sweet poppyseed dressing instead of the mayo--it turns out great....even without any substitutions--this is a crowd pleasing salad!

Very good recipe. I used a lot of broccoli and made it with less dressing. Very good and not so mayoish! Also, I would not use a whole red onion unless you really like the onion taste. I will definately make this again. Great flavor!

Very good recipe. I stemmed the broccoli for a minute or two, omitted the onion, used 1/2 cup lite mayo + 1/2 cup yogurt and less sugar, it was perfect.

I love this salad. I don't know that I would have tried it had I known that the dressing was mayo based...glad I didn't know that and did try it...I love it! It is a great dish to take to a pot luck or office party. Gets GREAT reviews from fellow employees. They are ususally shocked that there is even mayo in it.

Fantastic!!!  I just made this for a picnic.  The only thing I changed was that I did half broccoli/half cauliflower.  Really, how can you go wrong with bacon and almonds on anything?  I have to say that I really don't like mayonnaise but this is just toooo good!!!  I can't wait to be lavished with the compliments for this salad :)

I've bought broccoli salad from the store and this recipe tastes just like the store bought one. This is surprisingly delicious! Taste great as a side item to steak or other meat. Definitely recommend. Give it a try! I think you will be pleasantly surprised!

This was very, very good. I would only suggest one adjustment: maybe only use half of a red onion, or a very small onion. The onion seemed to overpower the other flavors in the salad. Besides that, I am a huge fan of broccoli salad and this recipe is spot on! I did not have any white wine vinegar, so I used 1.5 tablespoons of malt vinegar and half a tablespoon of white cooking wine instead. It turned out just fine. Also added some sunflower seeds for extra crunch. :)

I've been making this salad for the last few years.
I have made it more attractive by using half Broccoli and half Cauliflower.  Took it to a Pot Luck today & everyone enjoyed it.

Excellent salad - even better if you can let it sit for an hour or so to blend the flavors.  I added 1/2 c. shredded cheddar because I just can't help myself and whenever I want to 'lighten' it up a bit, I use 1/4 c. light sour cream with 3/4 mayonaise to save a few calories.  Wonderful summer salad with almost a cole slaw slant to it, but MUCH better!

This is a super yummy salad and I don't even care too much for broccoli salad!  My husband loves the stuff, so after running across this recipe as a Recipe of the Day I decided to try it out.  Super yummy!  The only changes I made was to swap out the almonds and raisons for sunflower seeds and golden raisons otherwise follow everything else to a  T (unless you are like me and double the recipe).  So good!  I made it today and will eat it tomorrow as other reviewers commented that its better the next day.  Yummy!  Its a keeper.

I made this just eyeballing the ingredients.  I skipped the bacon because I got lazy, and I subbed Craisins for the raisins.  I toasted the almonds (350 degrees for 8-10 minutes or until fragrant) and added them to the salad just before serving so they stayed nice and crunchy.  For the dressing, I cut way back on the sugar and just added it to taste.  This worked out perfectly for the broccoli that I needed to use up.

Love eating my broccoli like this.  I tend to use as little mayo as possible and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup.  I usually substitute sliced cashews for the almonds use cider vinegar and  add 1/2 cup sunflower seeds.

If you want a vegetarian version substitute soy bacon bits ... or just skip the bacon totally.  It is still really good that way.

I love this salad and have been making it for a very long time. I have changed a few things in it though.  I use craisins, pecans, and for the dressing, I use Vidalia Onion Vinegarette Salad Dressing, and everyone loves it.

Wonderful!!  I cut the dressing in half, just because I don't like too much, and was glad I did - half was plenty!  I also used lowfat mayonnaise, and apple cider vinegar just to give it more flavor.  I would do that again!  Just as a personal preference, I left off the onion and raisins.  I also left off the bacon because I wanted this as a side dish to a meatloaf (which would have clashed with bacon).  I still thought it was excellent!  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! So easy and so good! I followed another reviewer's advice and use 1/2 low fat mayo and 1/2 low fat yougart. Next time I will try cutting back sugar by 1/3.

I made this with roasted sunflower seeds, and red wine vinegar, other than that everything else was the same.  It was so good!  My husband and I couldn't get enough, and my son who doesn't really care for broccoli loved it. I have bought this salad from the deli before, so glad I have the recipe now!  Thank you!

I did dried blueberries instead of raisins and (because my daughter is a veggie) I did veggie bacon bits instead. It was great!!!

Nice mesh of flavors.  Very refreshing!  Used rice wine vinegar and less sugar.  Will make again.

I use red wine vinegar, salted sun flower seeds, and craisins rather than raisins.  Also, a bit of shredded co-jack cheese.  One of our favs, always a hit!!

Great salad!  I also add green or red sweet pepper to it but only use about 1/4 to 1/2 red onion and also add a small head of cauliflower to it as well.  The fresher this can be eaten the better.  Don't give the broccoli a chance to get soggy!

Awesome recipe, but a little too much 'extras' for the amount of broccoli that is called for. Next time I will double the broccoli and keep everything else the same.

This recipe is awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly with one exception.  I only used 3/4 of the sugar the recipe calls for because we don't like overly sweet.  It was perfect!

I used craisins instead of raisins and followed the rest of the recipe exactly, except I added a little bit of salt, pepper, and garlic to the dressing. This salad has to sit overnight so the broccoli softens and all the flavors marinade. It's tasty. I don't usually like broccoli, but this was very good.

I have made this for years and it is always a hit!! I use 1 cup roasted sunflower seeds instead of almonds. If you can make it the day before and stir it around every so often it is so much better.

Love this recipe! I made a few adjustments and it was a big hit. Instead of bacon I used Turkey bacon. I also didn't have any raisins in the house so instead cut up dried apricots into small pieces. Delicious! I would also suggest using no more than 1/4 cup of sugar, otherwise it is just too sweet. Thanks for the recipe... definitely one I will make again and again!

Wow, this salad is SO delicious. All of the flavors stand out and yet mingle deliciously. Letting the salad sit in the fridge overnight really helps tone down the onion's potency. I used turkey bacon and chopped walnuts, and this is by far the best broccoli salad I've had! Thumbs way up!

Awesome!!!  The sauce, in my opinion, is what makes this salad a hit; the people @the picnic couldn't get enough of it!  Because I had no bacon or raisins I omitted them.  I used broccoli, cauliflower, green onions, red grapes and sliced almonds.  red wine vinegar worked just fine, too.  Great recipe!

Love this! Couple of changes: I used cranberries instead of raisins.  I also used light mayo and half or less of the sugar.  Next time I will use a lot less red onion, the one I used must have been too big for this recipe.

I'm not really a raisin person so I omitted them, used sunflower seeds, added a shredded carrot and used rice wine vinegar instead.  Will definitely be making this recipe again.

The family LOVES this one. I used Craisins instead of raisins and green onion instead of red, I also used cashew instead of almonds (hubby doesn't like them) and less bacon than what is called for.

I left out the bacon and raisins and used sunflower seeds in place of the almonds. This was so good! I couldn't get enough. I was surprised that the sunflower seeds were not too soft the next day.

This is a family favorite!  It's so versatile and forgiving.. MY kind of dish!  I use my small processor to chop the broccoli and Cauliflower along with a couple of apples the add the walnuts, raisins, onion and whatever else I can think of and put it in a sealable bowl then add the dressing at mealtime... travels well too! Great to take to the office for lunch... Great in wraps...  Just a great dish! I haven't had to throw away any unused heads of broccoli or cauliflower with this receipe on hand... And I'm sure the family gets their complete servings of vegetables!  Everyone loves it!  It's better than the 5 stars... It's the BEST!

I can't tell you how much I LOVE this recipe.  It tastes just like my favorite dish at a popular soup n salad bar that we frequent.  My stepdaughter could not get enough of it.  The only thing I changed was I used cashews instead of almonds to mimic the restaurant recipe. I would definitely cut down the bacon a little bit next time as well. I felt it overpowered the other flavors. Another thing is I found that it did not taste good overnight.  The broccoli became soggy and the dressing a little runny.  This is definitely a dish that shouldn't be made a day ahead of time if using for potlucks or parties.

Wow. This is by far, the best broccoli salad I Have ever tasted. I made a huge batch for a baby shower and everyone was raving about it and asking for the recipe. I did halve the amount of onion, and it was still too much, in my opinion. I also left out the bacon to make it vegetarian friendly, and didn't miss it one bit.

Overall, very good.  As others have mentioned, quanties listed in cups would help.  I used 4 broccoli crowns (about 6 cups) and 1/2 of a large red onion (about 1 cup).  I also used slivered almonds instead of sliced and upped the raisins to 1 cup.  I substituted apple cider vinegar because it is what I had and I also substituted Splenda for the sugar and used lite Mayo.  I threw in some chopped oranges.  I thought this would have to sit overnight, but this was fantastic right after mixing it up!  Way yummy and I will make it again and again!

Excellent recipe that can be customized to your individual tastes. I like a little extra bacon and sometimes substitute the dried cranberries for the raisins. Thanks!

Truly excellent recipe & a confidence booster for a new cook. 
I'd recommend soaking the red onions in fresh lime juice for about 10-15min to ease the taste. 
I also used a mixed nuts pack (came with 5-6 different kinds of nuts with raisins, cranberries)

While this recipe is tasty as is, I like to make it with craisins rather than raisins, and sunflower seeds rather than almonds.  It tastes great, and it looks kind of festive for a Christmas potluck.

Loved this salad! Tweaked a little... added craisins instead if raisins and sunflower seeds instead of almonds due to allergies.  Enjoyed very much.  Served with burgers on the grill and tossed salad.  Would be great for potluck or picnic.  Thanks, Nora!

This recipe has become a family favorite.  I use 1 cup roasted sunflower seeds instead of almonds (this works best when added just before serving so that they stay crunchy).

Absolutely wonderful! I did modify it as I'm a vegetarian, so no bacon, and added craisins instead of rasins, but this is an awesome salad! DH and my sister both loved it! Thanks.

I made this without the red onions (can't handle raw onions) and thought it was incredibly good--however, the next day, it seemed way too sweet--I had already cut the sugar by a quarter--I'll probably decrease it to 1/2 next time--Otherwise superb recipe.  I used freshly toasted slivered almonds and sunflower seeds and they added a great touch.  Thanks for the recipe, Nora!

I made this recipe for the first time for Easter dinner, not knowing it was a favorite of my brother-in-law. He said of all the times he's eaten it other places, this was the absolute best! It was his favorite thing of the entire meal. I now have to make this for all family dinners. It made me a broccoli fan!

I never made broccoli salad before but always wanted to try. This recipe looked good but I revised it because I am diabetic and also watching my fat intake and wanted a salad just a little different by using miracle whip instead of mayo, sugar & vinegar.  Red cabbage instead of red onion.  50% less sugar craisons instead of raisins.  Added Julianne cut carrots & radishes and omitted the bacon.  It turned out so good.  Yummy!

I love broccoli salad, and this is a good one.  However, I wanted one without meat or onion, so I used broccoli and cranberries for the body, and mayo, white sugar (about half called for in this recipe)and apple cider vinegar.  It was light and tasty, and oh so quick and easy!  Great for vegetarians, and your breath won't get stinky from the onion.

Excellent recipe!  I made it for the first time when we had some company for dinner this weekend and everyone raved about it.  It was completely gone.  Per other reviews, I increased the broccoli to three heads and used only 1/4 onion.  After cutting up the broccoli, I put it in a strainer with the raisins and blanched them with boiling water before mixing the salad.  It brought out the color in the broccoli and plumped up the raisins.  Will definitely make this over and over again!

Yum!  This salad was a big hit at two holiday parties I went to.  I used sunflower seeds instead of almonds.  I also only used about 1/2 of an onion.  Make sure to make this before-hand and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours or overnight so that the flavors blend together.  Another tip is to rinse the raisens in warm water so they plump up a bit.

Great recipe made as is. I've had rave reviews each time I make it. If you don't like raisins, try dried cranberries (same measurement as the raisins in this recipe). We have found that we prefer the cranberries over the raisins. 

The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because the recipe does not specify the size of the red onion that should be used (small, medium, large). Perhaps, it would be better to state how much onion, chopped, to use. I've had to eyeball the amount of onion each time I make the recipe and think I have used 1/2 a large or 1 medium red onion--no problems with a strong onion taste.

Delicious salad.  I didn't use any sugar and quickly blanched the broccoli.  I felt the raisins gave it just the right amount of sweetness, and we are trying to reduce our sugar intake nowadays.  Tip for sharpness of red onion.  A half hour before putting the salad together, slice the red onion and let it soak in the vinegar and a little salt.  The vinegar will take the bite out of the onion.

Made it for a potluck at work. Everyone liked it. Be sure to cut the broccoli in very small pieces.

Prepared as written the first time. Made the following improvements the next time around: 1) blanch the broccoli in boiling water for 1 min, then submerge in ice water. Run broccoli through salad spinner before mixing with dressing. Helps maintain color and crunch. 2) Subbed honey for the white sugar (to taste). 3) Soaked raisins in hot water for 10 minutes to plump before adding. 4) Ran out of vinegar, but balsamic or red wine vinegar subs just fine. 5) To make ahead, mix broccoli, raisins, and onions and refrigerate. Make dressing and refrigerate. Add remaining salad ingredients and combine with dressing right before serving. Onions mellow out and flavor the salad better this way and no soggy salad.

I leave out the raisins and nuts from this salad. They just doesn't seem to go with the rest of the ingredients to me. I also use 2 cups of mayo, and don't use Miracle Whip, totally changes the taste. Also, I add about 8 oz of shredded cheddar cheese.

Loved this sweet broccoli salad! For a vegetarian option, I left out the bacon and added a 1/4 tsp salt in its place. I used white raisins, because that is what I had on hand, and substituted stevia for 1/2 the sugar. Also, reduced the red onion to 1/2, which was about 2/3 cup finely chopped.  I agree with the reviewer who said the onion flavor decreases as it sits in the fridge.  Definitely assemble this a few hours in advance and let it sit in the fridge to get the best flavor.

I made this dish exactly as the recipes reads for Christmas, 2012 dinner and today I'm about to serve it again. Everyone at the table was surprised at how delicious this salad was.  I particularly love having a wonderfully crunchy textural contrast to the ham, mashed gruyere potatoes, and rolls that I usually serve for our gathering of friends.  5 stars?  I'd go 6 if I could.

i just finished making this recipe for the first time for thanksgiving and i added sunflower seeds to it. not a whole lot just spprinkled them over the top and it is amazing! i followed it exactly as is but made a bit extra of the dressing and added the sunflower seeds. i see a lot of people saying its too sweet or to use less onions but i think its just fine. Really easy to tweek to your own personal tastes too :)

Hands down amazing salad! I discovered this recipe about a year ago, with a few modifications I've made it my own:
Broccoli bite sized, if I have time to go buy a red onion i slice onion in half and only use 1/4 of it-then slice very thin to make shaving like pieces (if you don't have time to buy a red onion then a white will do,i use halved almonds and cranberries..for the bacon i cook it in the oven for about 10 mins on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.. it's less messy and i don't have to watch it or flip it. be sure to save some for left overs it's always better the next day!!!

There are many better recipes for broccoli salad on AR. This one tastes candy sweet to me. If you don't care for a really sweet salad, try one of the others of your preference (mine is about 1-2 Tbsp. each sugar & vinegar per cup of mayo) and rate the dressing you like instead of cutting the sugar in this one and then giving it 5 stars.

I had this at a BBQ and loved it!  I got verbal instructions from the host but of course I forgot and thank you all recipes because this is it!  The only thing I changed, not much of a change, is I used 4 crowns of broccoli and MORE BACON!   After chopping up 2 crowns of broccoli it seemed there was too much sauce.  Perhaps my crowns were small.  I love this stuff.  I have it chilling in fridge for thanksgiving dinner and of course I already snuck a bowl.

I don't want to be the voice of dissent, but we really did not care for this recipe. Sweet mayonnaise with bacon and broccoli? I was skeptical from the beginning, and I should've listened to my inner critic.

Tried this recipe and loved it.  Even my son liked it.  We use half the broccoli and replace the other half with cauliflower.  We used fat free mayo to make it a bit more healthy and that didn't change the taste.

Really very good. I left out the onions and bacon cause I don't like uncooked onions and had no bacon on hand. My broccoli heads were on the smaller side, so i added 3/4 of the dressing to start with, which was to much. Next time I'll add more slowly. One variation a family member does is she buys shredded broccoli to make a sort of broccoli slaw. It's much easier and doesn't require all the cutting of broccoli. This recipe would be perfect for that and I'm going to try it next time. Possibly a little less sugar next time as well, it was very sweet.

This was very good as written, but in making it again, I made a few tweaks: I used 1/2 the onion called for - it was very strong on the first go-round. I *love* Craisins, so subbed that for the raisins. I also thought the dressing was way too sweet, so used less than half the amount called for this time and used more vinegar to thin the dressing out a bit more. Next time, I may experiment with yogurt instead of mayo for a slimmer result. That said, this will no doubt be a staple, as my coworkers scarfed it up in record time!

Very good.  I needed to cut back on the onion, but that is personal taste.  Dressing is fabulous.  Have used it on coleslaw with great success.  I would even use the dressing on bagged broccoli slaw.

This really was the best broccoli salad I have ever made/had.  I was too lazy to cook the bacon so I added about 1/3 cup of bacon bits and that was perfectly fine.  I also replaced white sugar with raw cane sugar A.K.A. Sucanat.  My 7-year-old loved it so much he ate a huge bowl full which made it worthwhile for me.  I will be making this soon in the near future for sure.

Been using a variation of this salad for a long time. My version adds shredded cheddar cheese, and minces the broccoli and red onion. After a few hours in the fridg, these flavors really gel.  Love it!

This was awesome!  I added sunflower seeds along with slivered almonds and used less sugar to make it more tart.  Also used dried cranberries rather than raisins due to my family's personal taste.  Made a double batch (with lots of good quality bacon) and then shared with my co-workers.  It was a big hit!!!

Definitely not the best version of this recipe. Next time I will reduce the sugar to 1/3C or even 1/4. It was as sweet as a dessert. I think it would also be ok w/ 3/4C of mayo since I'm not the biggest mayo fan.

1/2 C sugar sounded excessive.  I've made this recipe and it doesn't really need much sugar.  I used 2T in the recipe and it still seemed sweet.  The next time I make it, I'll try just 2 tsp sugar to see if it's enough.  The raisins (or craisins - whichever you choose to use) add sweetness, too.

This is an amazing recipe! Easy and fast to prepare. I used condensed milk to replace the white sugar. It would provide a richer texture and I feel like it is healthier :-)

WONDERFUL, only ingredient change was dried cherries rather than raisins.   I did not add bacon untill it was served.   My husbands loved this.  Fast and easy, love it!!

Great side dish! I did as someone else here suggested and put the broccoli in boiling water for 30 seconds then into ice water and it turned a beautiful bright green and made a lovely dish. About half the dressing was plenty for my taste.

I added more vinegar then recipe called for, I used reduced fat mayo made from olive oil, I also added sunflower seeds, dried cranberries and turkey bacon. So my version was healthier then the one listed, make if for cook=out and everyone loves it.

Really??!!  I cannot stop eating this stuff!  I couldn't find white wine vinegar at our base commissary here in England so I used apple cider vinegar instead.  WOW!  I think I am going to eat the entire batch tonight!  Delicious!

So yummy! Out of personal preference I use dried cranberries and roasted sunflower seeds. I alternate between white wine vinegar and red wine vinegar. Delicious either way.

Cut the bacon by more than half and it still felt like too much (is such a thing even possible?!). I poured out some of the bacon fat but kept enough to sautee the broccoli/onion a bit, since dinner was in 30 minutes and I couldn't wait for the vinegar to do its thing. Was great but next time I'll throw in another head of broccoli to balance out the other ingredients.

I first had this salad years ago but couldn't get the recipe from a friend. She stated it was her sister's recipe. But now its mine, and am so glad I searched for it online. Its the perfect salad, sweet, crunchy, and a kick with the onions. I agree with one of the reviews, the onions are kinda strong, so I'll wait and see if it'll be milder after a few hours of sitting. Thanks for sharing this great recipe, it will sure it a crowd pleaser at potlucks!

Very yummy.  I didn't really measure anything except the ingredients for the dressing.  Next time I will use slightly less sugar otherwise it is VERY sweet and add more bacon (who doesn't like more bacon?).

Broccoli salad is one of my husband's favorites.  I chose this particular recipe because it uses almonds instead of sunflower seeds, which I didn't have.  The only change was to omit the red onion, as it is not one of my husband's favorites.  This is a great summer BBQ salad.

I have been making this for over 15 years. The only differences in my original recipe is that it calls for pecans instead of almonds, regular onions and regular vinegar. Since I'm a vegetarian, I use vegetarian bacon bits. It's delicious and a hit!

sooooo good.  I didn't use any raisins cause I'm not a big fan.  Used red wine vinegar instead of white, and just a few spoonfuls of raw sugar instead of 1/2cup.  DELICIOUS.

Our local supermarket has this in their deli and i love it..but sometimes it's just too dry or not real fresh.  Glad to have found this recipe so I can make it how I like it...and fresh!  Easy and delicious!  I used cashews instead of almonds...

YUMMY!! I did add/change it like some of the reviewers did.  Craisins instead of raisins, sunflower seeds instead of almonds, and some cubed cheddar cheese. I added a 1/2 cup of sour cream to the sauce and an extra Tbsp of the vinegar. It was a HUGE hit in my house!

Fresh and delicious!  I substituted craisins for raisins since I had those on hand, and I toasted the almonds first.  I did chill the dressing, but I didn't combine everything until right before I served.  Family favorite--thanks for sharing.

This is a great way to eat broccoli! My 13 y/o daughter loves this salad. The recipe is easy to customize according to personal taste. For instance, we do cranberries and whatever nut we have on hand - usually pecans. I don't add the sugar - just mayo - it is delicious w/o the added sugar!

Loved it, sweet, chewy, so yummy. I used dried cranberries instead of raisons and red wine vinegar, fat free mayonnaise. Next time I will use less sugar to keep the sweetness down. Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

this was amazing. i left out the bacon because i didn't have any and it still tasted great, which makes it even healthier. also, i added a touch of dijon mustard because i always like a little spice from the mustard in my salads! thanks for the recipe!!

Delicious crowd pleaser. Substitute turkey bacon, roasted pine nuts, (tho the cashew idea sounds good too) craisins, skinny Miracle Whip, wine or balsamic vinegar to taste, with less sugar (or Splenda) to make the dish even a happier meal in the eyes of your doctor. Make a big batch, dole out small portions and see how many ask for more!

I had something like this in Vermont at a family picnic.  Thanks for the recipe.  I did omit the onion (not a big fan) also added raw cauliflower and sliced baby carrots.  Wonder how grapes would be with sit.  Definitely a keeper.

My bf and I LOVE the broccoli salad at Sweet Tomatoes, and this pretty much is it!  I didn't really measure anything- used about 1/3 bag of fresh broccoli from Costco, about 1 handful real bacon bits, 2 handfuls dried cranberries and 1-2 handfuls of cashews (the best!)... I won't eat onions unless they are cooked, so I omitted those.  For the dressing, I used 1/2 FF mayo and 1/2 Light, and started out with only 1/4 cup sugar.  I'm glad I didn't put in the full 1/2 cup sugar, cuz this was SWEET enough!  I did add one extra Tbs of vinegar, and it turned out perfect. THANKS for an awesome recipe!!

This was a huge hit at our Memorial Day bbq. I changed the recipe slightly--I used 1 large head of broccoli and added a small bag of shredded cabbage/carrots (what you'd use for coleslaw). The salad look beautiful and tasted even better! I will definitely make this again.

This was a delicious salad, everyone at my daughter's birthday loved it- even my very picky mother!! I took other's advice and used red wine vinegar. I also used light mayo and lessened the onions by 1/3. I will be making it again for other parties!

Yummy! I used turkey bacon, chopping it with my pampered chef chopper. Also used chopper to dice up some almonds. Cooked white onions in pan after removing turkey bacon - careful, there is very little grease, mostly just stir around to pick up flavor. Also used chopper to dice cooked onions. Very flavorful and would be GREAT at a BBQ. Oh yeah, I also added 1.5 cups of cooked tricolor pasta.

I have made this recipe many times and everyone always loves it.  I usually use more mayo than recipe calls for but otherwise keep everything the same.  For Thanksgiving I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins (when I use raisins I always use golden), pecans for the sunflower seeds, and shallots for the red onion for a milder flavor and red wine vinegar for the white.  I have also substituted dried cherries and almonds.  Very versitile for your own taste.  Delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is delicious- I always get raves!  I only use 1/8 cup of sugar, and I add one can of mandarin oranges. The oranges add sweetness and a touch of contrasting color. I often leave out the bacon & it is still just as good.

This salad was a hit last night. I made adjustments based on previous reviews as follows: Doubled recipe to "18" servings. Used 5 heads of broccoli. Decreased and used lite mayo to 1-1/2 cups. Decreased sugar to 1/2 cup, used 1 medium red onion. 1/4 cup red wine vinegar. Also roasted "blanched almonds" in the oven, coated lightly with olive oil to brown. Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you Nora, I was thrilled to find this recipe that I had made many times about 7 years ago. Somehow, I lost it and have seen several similar, but this is the one I had. I made it just as printed and such old memories landed on my taste buds. I am sure at our next family gathering, by family will be so happy to see this salad back on the table.  I will say, after reading some of the reviews that for Christmas I will use dried red cranberries in place of the raisins, and maybe pine nuts for the almonds.  How festive that sounds with the little green broccoli trees. This time my recipe will be safely guarded in my All Recipes Box.

Great dish for a pot luck - take the recipe with you - everyone will want it.  Very forgiving with respect to quantities - can increase/decrease to suit individual tastes.  I stopped measuring.  Non-veggie husband requests this one - it's so good.

One of my all-time favourites.  I have discovered over time that this salad has absolutely no need for sugar added in the dressing.  I have made it repeatedly with mayo, pepper and apple cider vinegar...it gives it a great tang.  You can add Splenda or a tiny bit of sugar if you like it super sweet, but it is great without too.

This is a good salad and I will make it again but I will cut down on sugar next time: a whole 1/2 cup made it way too sweet and I had to buy more broccoli to add to the salad.

This is always a BIG hit. I use sunflower seeds instead of almonds, green onion instead of red and no cheese. Definetly needs to sit a couple of hours b4 serving. Put the bacon in just before and toss. I also use Thompson raisins, because they are Big and juicy! Yummy!

I brought this to a potluck and got rave reviews.  One lady said that she never eats vegetables but liked this so much that she had a second helping!  My only changes were that I used a small yellow onion (chopped) since I didn't have a red onion.  Used regular vinegar because I didn't have wine vinegar.  Tossed it all together and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  Everyone thought that I'd bought the salad from the grocery deli.

WOW.  A "Yummy summer salad"?  Forget that; I would happily eat this all year round.  I swear that this website has everyone fooled into thinking that I am a great cook :)  I was afraid of the veggies getting soggy so didn't add most of the dressing, which I had chilled by itself for a couple of hours, until the last minute.. but I needn't have worried.  The leftovers were even more scrumptious the next day and not the least bit soggy.  I subbed craisins for raisins for color and zing, and used balsamic vinegar instead of white wine vinegar b/c that's all I add.  Everything else was the same, and everyone asked for the recipe.  DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS!!  A million thank yous, Nora!!

This is SUPER!  I don't usually care for raw broccoli, but made this way it is awesome!  I do cut the sugar in half.  Also, I use the same dressing for coleslaw, just add a little celery seed.  Love it!

This is a very sweet version of the broccoli salad. I cut the sugar to 2T and the mayo to 1/2 cup; combined with TOASTED slivered almonds, this was a lighter version that allowed the flavors of the broccoli, bacon and almonds to shine thru.

FRESH EXPRESS USED TO SELL A BROCCOLI SALAD AT MY LOCAL GROCERY STORE AND MY FAMILY LOVED IT AND ASKED FOR IT ALL THE TIME. SOMETIME LAST YEAR THE STORE QUIT CARRYING IT. THIS RECIPE WAS EVEN BETTER. I DID OMIT THE ONIONS AS I DON'T LIKE RAW ONIONS AND I SUBSTITUTED SUNFLOWER SEEDS AND CRANRASINS. THANKS FOR THIS RECIPE I WILL DEFINATELY BE MAKING THIS AGAIN!

This is really yummy as is. For a slight change of pace, I use the prepackaged shredded broccoli (for "broccoli slaw") instead of chopping up broccoli, use sliced scallions instead of red onion, throw in some seasoned croutons, and add a pound of cooked shrimp to make it into a great main dish. As one reviewer suggested, using pre-made bottled cole slaw dressing is just as good as making your own. Anything to save time. I also prefer the dried cranberries to raisins. Another suggestion: those lightly sugared smokehouse almonds add a really good flavor, too.

This was very yummy. I followed the recipe to a "T" and next time intend to make the following variations to our taste. Double the bacon, use 1/4 of the raisins stated, and add some nice cos lettuce leaves with a bit of salt and pepper and some grated parmesan cheese. It was very nice as is and the kids ate raw broccoli for the first time!! With the substitutions I will be giving it to hubby for work lunches during Summer.

Love this recipe.  A very trendy bistro makes this and it is one of the most requested salad.  I use 1/4 cup of sugar or substitue with honey. Nothing nicer than a vegetarian meal of baked potatoes and this salad in the summer.

We really enjoyed this salad.  I have made it twice - once with almonds the other time with sunflower seeds.  Both were very good.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very tasty and a hit with everyone at the table! To lower fat/sugar content we used Splenda instead of sugar, and used low-fat mayo. Delicious salad and great with most any meal!

This recipe is delicious. Instead of almonds, I used sesame seeds, and remember to go easy on the onion. I also used regular vinegar.

I recently had this salad at a party and loved it!  I made it at home and used Just 2 Good Hellmann's mayo, Splenda, mandarin oranges instead of raisins and cashews.  It was delicious!  No leftovers!  Go easy on the onion though...

This is the same recipe that my ex-mother-in-law used to use, except she uses chopped pecans instead of sliced almonds. Unfortunately my cookbook with this recipe is packed away in storage. But I was tickled when I saw it here.
I love making this salad. It's delicious!

I took the advice of other reviewers and used low-fat mayo (Miracle Whip) and Splenda.  I also used the craisins instead of raisins and just loved the tangy flavor they added!  I cooked & crumbled the bacon the day before so it only took a few minutes to cut the onion and broccoli and assemble the salad.  I should have chosen a smaller red onion, next time I will go with approximately 1/2 cup of onion.  I brought this to a funeral luncheon where there was lots and lots of dishes to choose from.  This salad was completely gone in a short amount of time!  I will be making it for Thanksgiving, too, thanks to ease of preparation.

I have made this salad for years.  I dont use the almonds.  Its excellent if it is allowed to sit overnight before serving. The flavors meld and the raisins swell up.  I never have any leftovers.

This recipe was great.  I followed it exactly and had it in the fridge for 4 hrs and the flavours were great.  I enjoyed the crunch of the broccoli with the soft raisins.  I forgot to add the nuts but it was still good.

I'm obsessed with this salad and have made it many times.  I chop the broccoli pretty small and substitute Craisins for raisins. I prefer the taste and the color is so pretty.

Everywhere I take this salad people rave about the flavors.  I typically use cashews instead of almonds and in a pinch pinenuts work too.

i have had this before but had never made it.  It is a great salad for me because I only like broccoli raw and not cooked.  I followed the recipe to the T.  It came out very good and like ones that I had tasted before.  Next time I make it, I will probably cut down on the sugar a little because it was a little to sweet for my taste but of course my kids thought it was just right.  Thank you!

I first thought, ew, mayo for dressing? it tasted great though.  I used white vinegar and a mix of cranberries, raisins and dried blueberries that I had. yum!

Edit: Ok, I've made this a few times now. I like to double the dressing and instead of 2 cups mayo I do 1 cup mayo and 1 cup either sour cream or PLAIN yogurt. The reason being is because if there's a little water left on the broccoli from washing it, the dressing doesn't stay in the broccoli and sinks to the bottom. Towel off the broccoli and let it dry before adding the dressing. Then, put it all together in a big bowl and let the raisins/cranberries drink in the dressing by letting it chill in the fridge until you're ready to eat, at least 1/2 hr. I don't really measure the amount of red onions, I just sprinkle 2 handfuls in or enough so it's evenly distributed in the salad mix. A whole onion is too much.

This salad is a big hit!

This was surprisingly good. I made a few modifications because 1) I didn't have any bacon, 2) I only had regular almonds, not slivered so I chopped them up. I used cranberries instead of raisins because I didn't have those either and I don't particularly like raisins. I know, I know, you're thinking "it isn't even the same recipe" but the dressing is what I really had my doubts about. I mean, broccoli is broccoli, right? I also wondered about eating it raw like that, but again I was pleasantly surprised. It all fit, and the dressing was nice and sweet. I will make this again. I can see how the bacon will put a bit more crunch in it and add a salty factor so I'll add it next time, but I'm definitely sticking with the dried cranberries instead of raisins.

This recipe is great as is. I love finding recipes I don't have to modify. The only thing I did to save time was use ready made real bacon bits (not the dry ones).  It was a hit.

I had a ton of broccoli from the garden to use up & this was perfect. This became a main course. I had to make some substitutions based on what I had. I used apple cider vinegar, grapes, & green onions and it was still great. The dressing makes it taste wonderful although I cut the mayo down to 3/4 cup to reduce the fat. . Thanks for the recipe!

I make this salad a lot. Its always a hit and leaves everyone wanting more! I substitute the vinegar with Apple cider vinegar, and sometimes use rehydrated cranberries, or fresh sliced strawberries in place of the raisins. Salted sunflower seeds have also been used to substitute the almonds. For those who are diabetic, The dressing can also be made with Stevia.

Very good recipe.
I used sunflower seeds, because I had no almonds.
I used less bacon and it was still very good. (and you cut down on salt, fat and cholesterol) and I added more broccoli as suggested. 
Also added a little balsamic vinegar dressing.
Next time I will add a few dried cranberries to tweak it a little.
Thanks!

Mmmmmmm, this was delicious!  Used light mayo and halved grapes instead of the raisins.  Only other thing I changed was to cut up about 4 slices of Turkey bacon and fry it up with cooking spray since it really doesn't crumble like the real stuff.  Even so, it was delightful!  I made it early in the day and let it sit in the fridge until dinner, so the flavors really had a chance to meld. Will definitely make again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

As is it's great but I did substitute the raisins for cucumber the second time I made it and still absolutely loved it. I use all organic and non-gmo ingredients as well to make sure I am feeding my family the very best. I will also say this is even better if you let it sit in the fridge a little longer as everything really soaks up the flavor and the broccoli becomes tender.

Just finished making this and it's AMAZING even before letting it chill in the 'fridge!! I took some user's advice and used Red Wine Vinegar. I also reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup for personal preference. Thanks for what might be my new favorite side dish!

This was a hit when I made it for a dinner at my friends.  She was skeptical at first because of the raw broccoli but she loved it.  I used half of the onion and chopped it really fine and I toasted the almonds and then chopped them.  I out the bacon in last right before serving it.    Definitely making this again!!

Put all of the ingredients except the raisins in the food processor and then mixed all together. I didn't have white wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar instead. Came out delish! Thanks for sharing.

It was way too sweet. I didn't put in onions, maybe the sugar balances things out... But with no onions, I'll add WAY less (like 1/4 cup) next time. Or no sugar.

I added broccoli slaw and shredded red cabbage. I used fancy raisins,and added a pinch of pure maple syrup and a tad less sugar.
Upped the servings to 20 for a big party. It was ALL eaten !
Huge hit, and they asked for the recipe too. Tasted better after three hours of refigeration. Excellent.

Very good salad but made a few modifications.  Decreased sugar to 1/4 Cup and used Craisins and roasted sunflower kernels instead of raisins and almonds.  Family loved it!!

Oh my goodness, this was a great salad! I used a small onion since after some recommendations that a large onion would be too much, kept raisins out since we're not raisin eaters but instead put in halved grapes. I used half a cup of mayo, and half cup of sour cream since it softened it up a bit, and used apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. I made it a few hours before I intended on eating it and it was a hit! I'm making it again for some camping trips coming up!

Great recipe!  I cut down on the sugar by half and my whole family loved it.  I  also added sunflower seeds and a chopped apple instead of raisins since my daughter won't eat raisins. It's a good recipe as is or changed to meet your own family's likes.

Had to skip the almonds due to an allergy.  Replaced them with cashews and it was just as decadent.

Great use of broccoli. I made this today but I did substitute.I used Hellman's Balsamic Mayo, a small yellow onion, I crushed whole roasted almonds. My biggest change was Splenda for over half the sugar then just a bit of sugar. I didn't measure but it turned out great. Everybody loved it. We made it and ate it ,so it may even be better later when chilled.

This is a variation of a recipe my grandmother used to make.  I usually use sunflower seeds instead of almonds, and red wine vinegar instead of white.  I also tend to up the amount of vinegar.  A classic!

I loved the recipe as is.  I made this a few times and didn't change a thing!  I always use fresh broccoli and not the prepackaged.. it always has a chemical taste no matter how long I wash it.  Real bacon and real sugar is the way to go.  Only fresh and from scratch in our house.  We're going completely natural and this is the only way to go for freshness.  Thanks for the great salad recipe.

We made this recipe with fresh broccoli from our garden. Absolutely excellent.  The fresh, tender broccoli was a big part of the reason we enjoyed this so much -- great for use with your farmer's market or CSA produce!

I just made this for my Thanksgiving for tomorrow and I'm worried there will be none left... my family can't stop "tasting" it.  Several of our folks don't like raw onions, so I left those out.  Other than that, I made this per the recipe.  Will DEFINITELY be making this a lot!

I parboiled some cauliflower (3 1/2 minutes), and I eliminated the broccoli.  I followed the suggestions of cranberries and sunflower seeds rather than raisins and almonds. I substituted turkey bacon.   I used half light sour cream and half light mayo with 3 tablespoons of balsamic and no sugar.   Fantastic!

Sour cream replaced mayo, and craisins replaced raisins. A-MAZING!! I was leery about using sour cream, afraid it would be too 'sour', but this turned out amazing! I will use this as a staple to potlucks, holiday's, and parties.

I have made this broccoli salad for different occasions and always get asked for the recipe! I made a couple of changes. 
First, I decided to use sunflower seeds instead of almonds. I also bought the pre-packaged bacon bits (the real stuff) and added in shredded carrots for extra crunch! I used 1/2 the dressing and it still comes out fabulous!!!!

I made it vegan with vegan mayonnaise instead of regular mayo and I used non-meat crunchy bacon pieces, a half a red onion all ingredients were organic except no meat bacon pieces. I also chose to use cashews instead if almonds and added 1 shredded carrot. Mmmm it's awesome!

I usually love this recipe, but I decided to make some changes based on other reviews, and just want to make everyone aware of what happened.  First, I read a review of someone who blanched the broccoli.  While the color was absolutely beautiful, the broccoli held just way too much water and I couldn't get it dry enough (even after squeezing it in between my hands in paper towels over and over and over again!).  I also added the red onion to the dressing and let it sit overnight in the fridge so the onions weren't so potent.  While the taste was still good, the dressing did something to the onions and they (the onions) appeared very runny in the dressing if that makes sense (but it was not noticeable once mixed in).  My biggest disappointment was that the broccoli was no longer super crispy/crunchy...just "kinda crunchy".  I guess I just need to stick to how I like recipes, but welcome the "tweeks" others suggest.  This salad normally goes super fast at potlucks I attend; this time it just didn't work out for me...or fellow potluckers so much.

Terrific, and made some alterations for nutritional value. I added sunflower seeds, cut up tiny pieces of buffalo jerky to use rather than bacon bits, used a bit less (lite) mayo, subbed in some non fat plain yogurt, Splenda, about 1/2 the amount of vinegar, (apple cider as I had it on hand.) Turned out fabulous, lower in fat and sugar, and higher in protein! Great energy food.

Good salad, but I would use less onion, less sugar and use cranberries instead of raisins.

Used craisins instead of raisins. and as others suggested, let the onions sit in the dressing over night. perfect! i love this recipe. a couple of times i used pecans instead of almonds because it's what i had. followed to a to a "t" or making minor changes, it's a great recipe! love it.

This salad is absolutely delicious!  I only used 1/4 of the onion and cashews for the nuts.  I served it for Easter brunch and people are still talking about it days later!

I have taken this salad to pot luck luncheons several times and never bring home any left overs. Always get asked for the recipe.  Try it with dried cranberries instead of raisins and walnuts or pecans instead of almonds.

This recipe is amazing, even if you dislike broccoli. No Joke!
I use grapes instead of raisins (cut in half) and Hormels real bacon bits so it makes it super easy assembling this salad. Not plain at all, has wonderful flavor! Make for lots of BBQ's and family gatherings, there is never any left over and everyone raves about it.

Very good salad!  I kindof eyeballed all ingredients to preference and this was such a hit.  Boyfriend and daughter loved it then I made it for my mom, dad, and brothers and they kept telling me how good this salad was going back for 2nds and 3rds.

Vegetarian version for us! Used Bacos instead of bacon. And replaced sugar with Splenda as I'm a Weight Watcher. Minor tweeks in my opinion. Delicious.

I made this and got rave reviews.  I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup Greek Yogurt.  I used English Walnut chopped instead of the almonds.  I used Splendar instead of the Sugar.  Used refular Vinegar.  I also added Sesame Seeds.  The family loved it and has asked for it again.

This was fantastic! I did change a few things based on what I had on hand, but the base for this recipe was great! I didn't have bacon on hand so I just left it out and I used grapes instead of raisins and cashews instead of almonds. I also substituted red wine vinegar for white wine vinegar because that's what I had on hand.

Wow, thank you, I would never have put this together, but your picture was so appetizing. I skipped the raisins and used a few pieces of yellow onion, next i'm going to add Gorgonzola cheese and see what flavor that adds.

Delicious!  I've made this many times and have made slight modifications each time.  The basics are there so you can adjust ingredients (eg: I use Balsamic Vinegar instead, etc).  Definitely tastes better once it's melded.

This recipe was a great copy of the deli broccoli salad that I love to buy at the grocery store. I did change a few things. 1. I used turkey bacon instead of regular. 2. I didn't have any red onion so I used green instead. 3. I substituted the white wine vinegar for apple cider vinegar b/c that's what I had on hand (I'll be using that from now on!). 4. I omitted the almonds, and used golden raisins instead of regular. AWESOME combinations. In the future, I may use the red onion, but I'll definitely keep the substitutions that I used the first time around. Family loved this! Will definitely make again.

Next time I make this, I will cut the sugar, and add a bit of salt. You would think that with the bacon, it would be salty enough, but it isn't. I would put a dash of it in the dressing, and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup- if not slightly less. Easy to prepare ahead of time, colorful and a crowd pleaser.

Have used a version of this for years.  I only use 1/4 cup of sugar, or a bit less, a bit less than 1 C mayo and add about 1 C shredded cheddar cheese. Always a hit!

This is definitely one of my families favorites! I use craisens instead of raisens, and apple cider vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar.  It's a super simple salad to throw together especially if you buy the precooked, crumbled bacon. I always get many requests for the recipe!

Very tasty but I would only do 1/2 or 1/4 onion next time. Also I only added 1/4 cup of sugar and it was just fine.  I might even reduce it even more next time.  All the other combined ingredients make this recipe sweet enough so I saw no need to add more sugar than necessary.  Otherwise it was good and I will be making it again

This is fabulous. Even broccoli-haters loved it at the pot-luck picnic. I blanched my broccoli first, since that cleans it up a bit and makes it more tender. Used part LF sour cream and LF mayo along with white wine vinegar. Used a mixture of dried berries/cherries, and tossed in a can of drained chopped water chestnuts. Also, tried it with chopped cashews, but would recommend toasting them first, since they kinda disappeared into the salad. Thanks for the posting!!

Everyone loved it, had to make it a week later for another gathering!  I did only use 1/4 onion so as not to over power the salad.

Great salad.  I added lots of extra broccoli and there was still plenty of sauce.  Everyone loved it and hubby even sat down with the bowl of left overs later that night.  Will definitely be making this again and again.

I make this salad ALL THE TIME. It is the dish that family members request for get togethers. I make all kinds of substitutions too. I have used cashews, walnuts, sunflower seeds or pine nuts. I have also substituted dried cranberries for the raisins. I have also left the onions out completely. It is always good no matter what I do to it, this salad has never gone wrong.

Very good summer salad recipe. The only thing I did different was to use only half of the sugar that was called for and I still thought it was on the sweet side. Will definately make again.

I got this recipe from a cook from the middle/high school I work at, it is a  favorite of both the students and staff!     I improve it when I make it however and leave out the almonds and raisins and I add one and a half cups of shredded cheddar cheese.   It adds a nice bite to it, and I find it is more broadly liked by the "not so daring crowds"   My mom makes the exact above version. I stick to mine.   When we have gatherings there is always plenty of hers left over. I make a double of mine, and there is never any to bring back home.     I think the cheese just adds a little something extra.....and YUMMY! Try it, I think you'll agree!

Great base recipe!! I substituted dried cranberries for raisins and balsamic vinegar for white vine vinegar and reduced the sugar by half. Added a chopped apple, red pepper, snap peas, and walnuts. Turned out great! Everyone loved it!

We loved this salad!!!  I made it exactly as written except that I reduced the sugar by 2 tablespoons. The dressing was great with a little less sugar, but that's a personal preference, so I still rated this recipe 5 stars. By the way, I made this just before I had eye surgery to have something in the fridge for lunch, and it only got better tasting after a couple of days.

I have been making this salad for many years and it is always liked. My only change is to use a jar of Hormel bacon bits and after everything is mixed adding a can of mandarin oranges and blending gently.

I have been making this recipe for several years now and love it, but I use chopped green onions instead of red onion, and when I am pressed for time I buy a bag of real bacon pieces by Oscar Myer. I also toast my almonds and I prefer golden raisins for their lighter taste. Hard to beat for a summer salad.

Followed this recipe to a T [except used red wine vinegar!] and it was delicious - be sure to keep the salad cold and refigerating it overnight is an absolute requirement for the best flavor! I will try this again using fresh grapes like other reviewers mentioned.. Im sure it is delicious that way too!

I substituted cranberries for the raisins and skipped the almonds because I didn't have any. Would have loved it with the almonds too. I chopped the broccoli quite small and replaced some of the mayo with sour cream to make it taste lighter. Very good!

I find using the amount of mayo and sugar this recipe calls for yields too much dressing, especially if you leave it in the refrigerator overnight.  To compensate I use three heads of broccoli, or reduce the amount of mayo/sugar by one-third.  Otherwise the raisins will begin plumping up because they absorb the liquid.  Also, using craisins instead of raisins is very good.

I love this salad, it's usually a hit when I bring it to cook outs. I usually omit the nuts when I make this, I find the raw broccoli gives the salad enough crunch without 'em.

Great salad and easy to make.  I usually buy broccoli salad at an expensive upscale supermarket.  This was better!  Next time I will add less sugar as this was a little too sweet.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Outstanding base recipe but surprise (!) here's my modifications, that in my opinion improved the end product.  No raisins. I don't believe raisins have any place on this planet and ruin everything they come into contact with. Replace raisins with sunflower seeds or pine nuts.  I also added shredded red cabbage which combined with the broccoli adds great flavor and even more crunch.  Reduce the 1/2 cup of sugar as this overpowers and over-sweetens the overall flavor of this wonderful salad. The longer you chill this salad the better it gets. Enjoy as it truly is a crowd pleaser. Thanks for posting.

I was given this recipe years ago and had misplaced it.  So happy to have found it again!  We like it substituting a head of cauliflower for the second head of broccoli.

I used sunflower seeds instead of almonds.  I also omitted the red onion as I was trying to make it a little more child friendly.  This recipe is awesome.  I will make it again and again I am sure!

This is fanastic.  I took it to two bbqs and it was gone both times.  I did cut the mayo to 2/3 and put a 1/3 sour cream.  I used light mayo and light sour cream.  I also used turkey bacon.

I usually don't like raw broccoli (love it cooked) at all, so I wasn't sure about this, but decided to give it a try as part of our Easter brunch. I was pleasantly surprised because that "raw broccoli flavor" that I usually dislike so much was totally not there! The one substitution that I made was that instead of making the dressing I used store-bought a Sweet Vidalia Onion dressing (I believe it was Ken's). Very good overall, and a great dish to take to a potluck (everybody liked it at Easter).

The ingredients in this version of broccoli salad are spot on, except for the dressing.  As written, it is a little too sweet.  Once I added more vinegar, it worked.  No leftovers at the party, so clearly a winner!

Sometimes I use sunflower seeds or scallions or craisins or dried cherries. This is a summer staple for us. Only use mayo not salad dressing/miracle whip.

I have been making this for a few years Like others I only use 1/4 of the onion.  I like mine best with pecans.  You can also use walnuts or peanuts.  I also cheet a little and buy the precooked bacon and crisp it up in the microwave or you can use the bacon bits for salads (don't use the imitation bacon bits though).  I wate until right before I serve it and put the bacon bits on top so they won't get soggy.

It was really good... NONE of my kids liked it, but at Easter dinner it was a huge hit with the adults. I didn't add the nuts, I forgot them at the grocery store.

I've made this about five times with great success.  I have made it as is or with additional green vegetables (broccoli, green pepper, celery) but I always use the red onion for color.  Sometimes I don't add the almonds.  The bacon and raisins give it a certain specialness.  A real winner.

Delicious! I will admit to being trepidatious at first, but all of the flavors blend very nicely. I also used red wine vinegar instead of white, cut down on the sugar and onions, and used "real" bacon bits instead of frying the bacon...it was great, and we are happy to have added a new salad to our repertoire.

I made this for my family on my Grandmother's 80th birthday.  I took a chance since I have never made it before.. it was AMAZING!!  I used a dried fruit mix, which I think brought a bit more color and diversity to it.. My own Grandmother (the cook in the family) asked for the recipe!! Thank you so much for posting this.

This was pretty good, but I found there was way too much of the dressing, so I used it as a coleslaw dressing as well.  I liked it on the coleslaw even better than the broccoli.  
I also added some salt, pepper, garlic powder and in the coleslaw some mustard poweder and poppy seeds.

AWESOME!!  I used cherry flavored dried cranberries instead of raisins and I used almonds and cashew pieces (I didn't measure just threw them in).  This was the hit at my daughter's 2nd birthday party!  Will make this again and again.. thanks for the recipe!  Sooo good!

Awesome salad.  I am making this tonight for the second time in a week. I used red wine vinegar and followed the rest of the recipe and it is wonderful.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was probably the best broccoli salad I've had. I was afraid the onion would be overpowering so I only used a fraction of what the recipe called for.

Fantastic.  Made a huge bowl for the 4th of July potluck and not a bite was left.  Even my Grandma was impressed, and that is saying alot.  My brother loved it to and he doesn't eat vegetables!
I used a mixture of dried cranberries and raisins, peanuts instead of almonds and rice vinegar because it's what I had. I agree with the others about the sugar and will use less next time, especially if I'm going to use rice vinegar.

I was skeptical about this but it came out fabulous.  After reading the reviews, I cut back a little on the sugar, used red wine vinegar, and sunflower seeds instead of almonds because it sounded better. I'm sure it will be a hit at work tonight.  Thanks for a great recipe - I'm sure i'll be making this again.

This stuff is so good.
I followed the recipe for the most part except reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and I used red wine vinegar instead of white.

I made this for my family tonight to go along with a rich Beef Tenderloin dish and they LOVED it.  Worried that my picky son would not eat it, I substituted a bag of broccoli slaw for a head of broccoli and used real bacon bits.  I also blanched the broccoli head and cooled it before adding to the slaw.  He gobbled ever bit of it up and asked for seconds.  We also used sunflower seeds and my son added dried cranberry's to his instead of the raisins.

This recipe is ALWAY a hit and everyone wants to know the recipe when I make it.  My suggestions would be 1/4 of the suggested amount of red onion and substitute Apple Cider Vinegar for the White Vinegar.

This recipe is very worthy of all the high reviews..it is absolutely delicious.  The only things I will do differently next time (and there will certainly be a next time) is to use less onion and less sugar.

I use red wine vinegar as well and I also use cashews (toasted for a few minutes) instead of almonds, and I omit the onion because Im not crazy about onions and they are strong in this recipe.  This is absolutely delish, but dont eat too much, broccoli can be deadly if you know what I mean!!

Excellent! If you use two good sized heads of broccoli, you will need all the dressing!! The only changes I made were:
used 1/4 c. onion finally chopped, used sunflower seeds insead of almonds, and marinaded the onion, mayo, sugar and vinegar as per other reviewers - great advice!

Yummy....I had 3 small broccoli crowns, used 6 slices of turkey bacon, red onion, left out the raisins for hubby, and used sunflower seeds. I quarted the dressing recipe to cut fat. I used 1/4 c. mayo, 2 tsp. sugar, 1 tblspn. red wine vinegar. Mixed the dressing in with all the ingredients and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours. Loved the flavors, I know I used less broccoli, but I cant imagine using 1 full c. of mayo....I think I will try it with some plain yogurt added to the dressing next time.Thanks for a quick and tasty recipe!

I really enjoy this recipe. Only things I changed was red grapes instead of raisens and a sweet onion rather than a red. I'm taking it to a pot luck tonight and it's always the first dish gone.

This was a fantastic salad!!  I used half broccoli and half cauliflower.  I also added the juice from a fresh lemon and used cashews but I added about 1 1/2 cups of parmesan cheese and let me tell you it added just the right amount of salty to the sweet.  Yum,yum everyone loved it, my husband was still raving about it this morning will definitely make again.

This makes a very satisfying lunch, not to mention it taste better the next day.  I did make some changes by substituting 2 TBS of sunflower seeds for the almonds and used blood orange vinegar for white wine vinegar.

This is a fabulous salad! I had had this type of salad before, but had never made it myself. I found this recipe and decided to try it out for a potluck luncheon at work. Everyone loved it! What wasn't eaten up at the luncheon was packed up and taken home by my coworkers.I cut the amount of sugar in 1/2 as suggested by other reviewers, and used sunflower seeds and mixed raisins. [black, golden, and red] Great presentation and flavor! This salad rocks!

Wonderful recipe! Modifications: 1/2 c. mayo (instead of 1 c.), 1/4 c. sugar (instead of 1/2 c.). I did not have raisins and used dried cranberries which colored the salad beautifully. This recipe is a keeper!

This is pretty good as written, but I've changed it up to suit my family's taste.  I leave out the red onion...we just don't care for it in there.  U also use red grapes, halved, instead of raisins.  Also, sometimes I will replace 1 head of broccoli with 1 head of cauliflower.  Thanks for the recipe!

I do not like broccoli, but I love this salad.  The only problem is every potluck we go to everyone asks me to bring "my" (your) broccoli salad, I never get to bring anything else!

All I can say is WOW! I honestly never thought I would like this salad, but it was excellent!  I made a few modifications: 3/4 cup mayo (red. fat), 1/2 an onion, 1/4 cup sugar, and used malt vinegar because that's all I had.  My hubby and I loved it!  Thanks so much for a new favorite!

We loved this salad.  I made it lower fat/calories by substituting FF for reg mayo and Splenda for sugar.  Also, used both golden & dark raisins for a more colorful presentation.

A good alternative to the usual sunflower seed, raisin, and bacon variety of broccoli salad.

My husband rates this THE BEST.  I modified the recipe to serve two.  My recipe was not a "fresh" broccoli salad, as I used defrosted florets (2 cups, measured while frozen).  I used sweet onion, macadamia nuts, Kraft light mayo, and red wine vinegar.  I could only mix in 1/4 tsp. sugar just before serving; otherwise it would have been too sweet.  It did need a generous sprinkle of both salt and pepper.

I had eaten this type of salad once long ago, and I was amazed at the combination of ingredients.  I made the salad without the almonds and did you use low-fat miracle whip, as other have suggested.  It was very good. I kept going back for seconds...and thirds.  I had it for lunch and I dared serve it to my 2 year old daughter, who up until now hated all forms of veggies...especially brocoli!!! She loved it and had a hearty plateful of it. I think the raisins did the trick...:)

I'm here in China, so I'm always looking for recipes that have the ingredients I can get to here.  This recipe was great!  I couldn't find regular raisins, so I used the sweet and spicy ones here, and I think the peppery taste really added a nice kick.

Delicious and very easy to make.  I did switch out the raisins for dried cranberries this time but in the past I would add the raisins to the dressing and let it sit before adding it to the broccoli.

I made it once and that was it. It's my go to pot luck take along. I use the dried cranberries instead and use the precooked bacon from Hormel that is super lean.  I started printing out the recipe because where ever I take it, people want the recipe!  
Just try it once, and you make it a regular in your kitchen.

Incredible! I did use craisins, because that's what was in my cabinet. The white wine vinegar is the key, though.

People raved over this recipe. I will admit to a change or two. I realized too late that I didn’t have white wine vinegar so I subbed aged Italian balsamic vinegar and I reduced the sugar to account for the sweeter balsamic vinegar. I toasted the almonds which brought out their flavor very nicely. Used 3 medium sized heads of broccoli.  It all turned out very good! I’d make this again for sure.

Delicious! I used less onion, only about a quarter of a red onion, and I used sunflower seeds and dried dark cherries. I also subbed the regular vinegar for red wine vinegar and it is heavenly. Such a good recipe for Thanksgiving. Thank you!

This is delish just as the recipe is written. On the other hand I have made numerous variations. My favorite is using sunflower kernels, dried cranberrys and some shredded cheddar cheese. I use red onions sparingly. Divine! Pot luck at church leaves the bowl empty every time.

I've been making this salad at the holidays for years.  I make it with red wine vinegar and at Christmas I use dried cranberries instead of raisins.  It is such a beautiful salad that I put it in a beautiful clear bowl to serve.  Be prepared to be asked for the recipe often.

I have always loved this kind of broccoli salad but didn't realize it was so easy to make!  I didn't have any nuts so I served mine without.  (The nuts get soggy if this salad is made ahead and I never really like the soggy nuts in this salad anyway...if I were to add the nuts, I would put them on the side for everyone to sprinkle on top when they take their servings.)

This is a delicious salad that was a hit at my son's birthday party.  I thought the onion might be a little too much, so I cooked it in the leftover bacon grease for just a minute or two. It mellowed out the flavor, and allowed it to blend with the other ingredients. I used 4 small heads of broccoli,  and the suggested amount of all other ingredients.

I've made this before & it was great, but this time I wanted it a bit more healthy.  I substituted FF Greek Yogurt for the sour cream,  SF sweetener in place of the sugar,  Lite Mayo & added some FF Cheese.  Nobody knew the difference.  I did add sunflower seeds, but almonds would have been good too.  Love that it is such a light refreshing salad either way you make it.

I used grapes instead of raisens and I used walnuts in place of almonds, other than those two changes I followed the recipe.  This salad is delicious and refreshing.  A perfect side dish for Labor Day holiday BBQ.

I made this for myself, then for a Pot Luck.
I really liked it and had none left over at the dinner
I received many compliments and requests for the recipe.
I had eaten this at a previous potluck (at a different place)
and asked for the recipe, but the lady wouldn't  give it out.
I went searching and found this.. I did make a couple changes;
I blanched the broccoli in boiling water for about 30 seconds
then dried off in a tea towel, and I only put in 1/4 C sugar.
I have used both chopped walnut and pecans and both were great.

Fantastic! I did adjust to my tastes and used bagged broccoli florets and just cut them up smaller. Toasted the almonds and used about 50% more.  Vidalia rather than red onions. Dried cranberries rather than raisins. Also used bacon bits for salad (the real kind) instead of making my own.

I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup, used 3/4 cup mayonnaise, chopped the almonds (because whole almonds were too hard to slice) and added blueberries since they are abundant right now.  Great recipe otherwise!

Fabulous! I changed the amount of red onion to half a cup and changed the amount of sugar in the dressing to 1/4 cup. I used apple cider vinegar and omitted the almonds  (I'm reactive to them). Add the bacon and raisins (I used craisins) just before you serve to keep them from getting soggy.

I love this recipe. It is great as the recipe is written and allows for replacement of different nuts and fruits for slightly different tastes depending on what is in the pantry. I typically reduce the onion and sugar.

I’ve made this tasty salad a few times now and I really enjoy it! The dressing isn’t too sweet because of the tartness of the white wine vinegar which makes it really enjoyable. It’s a nice light salad and it’s very simple to make!

Left out the raisins and adjusted the sugar and vinegar to my liking.  I always sample after mixing it with the mayo and before putting it on the broccoli.  Came out perfect and everyone loves it.

I made it for 4 servings and left out the almonds. (I didn't have any.) I used broccoli and cauliflower leftover from a vegetable tray.  It was very good. I will make this again for sure.

Made this for a Memorial Day BBQ and it was a hit. I followed the advice of the reviewer who followed the recipe to the letter but then she used red wine vinegar, more broccoli and less onion but ended up adding more onion. I had to use dried cranberries because I was out of raisins and honestly I think that was the perfect dried fruit for this salad. I allowed it to chill for 4 hours before serving. My family and friends have said I have to bring this salad to every occasion for now on because it was so amazing.

I've made this a few times, and it's pretty tasty. Half the onion and bacon are plenty for us. Definitely add extra broccoli, and make sure to cut the florets TINY.  It works best if each floret isn't a whole bite, since there are so many other good things to include in each bite!

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I found that there was wayyy too much dressing. I ended up pouring a decent amount of it out of the bowl! I'd recommend halving the dressing ingredients. Other than that, it's a wonderful recipe with a lot of flavor to it.

Excellent all around salad or side. I use honey or real maple syrup instead of sugar with rice vinegar to blend with mayonnaise. I’m able to control the consistency this way.

Yum! I used a head of broccoli and a head of cauliflower, used apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and made a recipe and a half of the sauce (mayo, sugar and vinegar) which was perfect! I will definitely make this again!

Love the recipe! A couple modifications & hacks that work: I swapped yellow for red onion, apple cider vinegar for white wine vinegar and added a handful of shredded carrots. A couple time saving hacks for this recipe is to buy pre-shredded broccoli, instead of breaking up or cutting the heads, and pre-cooked bacon.

I went to the Honeybaked Ham co & looked for their salad which I always buy with the ham- they had none!! I decided to make some instead! -This recipe was great! I made it just as directed, using slivered almonds & golden raisins. Not a complaint in the world but in the future I will definitely blanch the broccoli for a few seconds to give it less of a raw flavor.

I love this recipe. It’s a big hit with my family. It’s crunchy, tangy, sweet, and salty - a great counterpart to a savory side. I use green onions rather than red onion which imparts a mild onion flavor. I find the red onion overpowers this salad. I substitués dried cherries for the raisins which provide a super tangy, sweet, and soft element. Add the bacon just before serving to ensure it retains its crispiness. The salad is better after it sits. A great make ahead dish to reduce your holiday stress.

Very tasty. I love the crunch of broccoli in the salad. I have made this many time and is always hit with new friends that try it.

Since I planned to take this salad to a potluck, and because I live among a rather timid social circle of eaters, I left out the lovely purple onion.  I worried that the salad might be bland without it, but most of my friends will not eat raw onion and I was already pressing my luck by substituting dried cranberries (beyond the comfort zone)for the raisins and pecans for the more familiar almonds.  I used four of the smaller broccoli head that have had the large stems removed, so I had a lot of broccoli and added a bit more bacon to compensate. By the time the salad had marinated in the dressing for a few hours, all the dressing seemed to have disappeared, which worried me so much I took a bottle of poppy seed dressing with me to the potluck.  I needn't have worried. Even with all these adjustments, the salad turned out beautiful (ruby red cranberries against all that green), crunchy, nutty, sweet, tangy and absolutely delicious! And my far from adventurous friends left three other salads almost untouched and ate over three quarts of this one.

I made a few changes to this recipe as suggested by others. 1) Blanched the broccoli and put in ice water. Had really nice color. 2) I'm not sure if I used more broccoli than the recipe calls for. A "head" of broccoli isn't specific.  But I think I did. 3) 1/4 c sour cream 3/4 c mayo 4) 1/3 c sugar. Probably would try 1/4 c next time. 5) Very few onions. I used 1/2 of a small white onion because that's what I had on hand. That was plenty. One whole red onion is a lot of onion in the first place. Red onions are strong... And huge! Turned out great for a winter picnic with friends. Everyone loved it.

Absolutely perfect recipe. Blanching the broccoli is important for texture and color. Don’t forget to refrigerate for at least an hour before adding last 2 ingredients. Only thing I might change is substitute with sunflower seeds and change to craisin.

This salad was delicious!!!  I used only 1/3 cup of sugar, which was plenty to make the dressing just sweet enough.  I also used less red onion than was listed - just enough to suit my taste - and I used golden raisins.  Served it with beef brisket sandwiches and mac 'n cheese for a family luncheon.  It was a big hit!  Just as good in the winter as it will be in the summer!

This was a huge hit with some fussy family! My husband went back for 3rds. Even my 18-year-old son ate a portion. I added some unsalted sunflower seeds and half craisins/ half raisins too. This will be a family favorite. I used 3 heads of brocolli.

I'm a vegetarian so mostly I was after the dressing recipe. I changed it so much I may repost my version instead; here's my alterations: a lot of people seemed to think the  onion ratio was too much so I doubled the broccoli. I also used a blend of raisins, dried cranberries, and dried blueberries. I let the onions "breathe" so they weren't as pungent(soak in water for 20-30 mins after peeling a cutting in half before chopping). I also used a white basalmic vinegar and half the sugar. And I added nuts/sun flower seeds right before serving so they don't a they too much moisture

Love this salad! It is one of my favorites. I omit the nuts as i find them unnecessary. I have made this several times and always have great reviews. Even those who "don't really like broccoli" have complimented me on this salad!

Love this Broccoli salad! I doubled the order so I can bring it in for work... I used red wine vinegar, I like it better personally. If you chopped everything on the finer side it’s not over bearing, but I like onion, so I used a whole one. The only suggestion I would mention is the sunflower seeds- I prefer salt less unless you like a lot of salty taste to your food. I used walnuts, just because they were on sale for the nut additive, & instead of raisins I used cranberries..... it’s to your taste!! Or use both lol.. enjoy!! It’s yummy!!

I loved this salad!!  The only change I made was due to me not having enough mayonnaise.  I had to add a little sour cream, extra vinegar and sugar.  I am certain there is nothing wrong with the recipe just as it is.  
 I took the salad to a party and it was a highly praised on!  It will definitely be a keeper forever!!  YUM YUM!!!!!

I've made this twice - both times to rave reviews.  As I tend to avoid onions, I left it out, and, since the only vinegar available was apple cider vinegar, I used that.  In spite of those changes it turned out very well.

So good! This is a keeper. I substitute sugar with Splendid. I also don't have the vinegar in hand, so I used apple cider vinegar. Turned out GREAT! Thanks for the recipe.

Love this recipe, would be great as written. I only had regular ol' vinegar and it worked just fine. I also used craisins, added salted sunflower seeds and omitted onion for fussy eaters . Ratios were perfect. Thanks

I leave out the onions and use almonds and sunflower seed kernels. Also, I use Miracle Whip instead of mayo. Absolutely delicious! I definitely recommend!

This is the best broccoli salad recipe I have found.  It's bold flavors combine to make a salad that will compete with the main dish.

I’ve made this three times now and every time it has been well received. I did make some changes though and it will all depend on each one’s taste but I’ve added a bit of wasabi into the mix to kick the flavors just a bit. Even toddlers were able to accept that additional spice!  In addition, some rotini pasta mixed into the salad makes for a nice meal too!

I added a pound of bacon and only 1/4 cup of sugar.  Plus I don't  think I had 2 heads of broccoli, more like 1 or a little more.  I also got compliments on this salad that it was the best broccoli salad they had ever had!!

Delicious!  Everyone raved about it and wanted to take some home.  The only adjustment I made was to use half the amount of sugar and I left the raisins out because I dislike raisins.  This will be a salad that I will make again and again.

I did put the broccoli in boiling water for a minute before putting it in ice water,I used apple juiced sweetened organic cranberries and reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup.  I am making it for a potluck and it is everything that I can do not to eat it all myself.

I have made this several times and everyone loves it! I cut back on the sugar and use pomegranate red wine vinegar and a dash of balsamic vinegar. I also used walnuts and craisins, in place of the raisins. With or without these minor changes, this is a great recipe!

I LOVED this recipe! I chose it hoping it was like the broccoli salads I've tried before, but it had almonds instead of sunflower seeds. I love almonds though, so I thought I'd give it a try. IT. IS. DELICIOUS!!!

Added a cup 1/2 shredded Colby jack. Used white balsamic vinegar.....And OMG THIS WAS THE HIT OF 4th of JULY side dishes.   Perfect... love the almond over the sunflower seeds that other recipes call for.  The flavors are amazing.

Very pretty salad. I used bacon bits which I think is much easier, and green onions as they are milder so don't compete with the broccoli. Also I'll use less sugar next time I make it as the craisens/raises make the salad plenty sweet, I think

This is a great base recipe, from which you can get really creative. I've made it before with rotisserie chicken instead of bacon and it was great. Other options to add: grapes, various nuts, etc. A little Frank's Red Hot sauce gives it a little extra kick.

It is a recipe I've been making for 25 years or more.  I especially like that you can substitute items if you don't have something on hand, Or have to contend with an allergy.  The recipe as listed isn't identical to mine, but very similar.  I always add water chestnuts for example.  I found myself short on raisins, but did have dried cherries on hand.  No sunflower seeds, used rice vinegar, etc.  You get the gist, able to personalize to your family and favorite flavors.  I also add some cauliflower with the broccoli, as all broccoli can sometimes be too strong.

AMAZING
I didn't have any nuts but other than that I made it exactly as the recipe called for. I could eat this for all meals all the time! DBF thought it was good, he'll eat it but not 2 days in a row. Thank you!

THis is a great starter. We are not onion fans, so didn’t add those at all. Substituted dried cranberries for the raisins. And didn’t have any fresh bacon to use, so I used 1/4 cup REAL bacon bits/pieces. This was a huge time savor. A great summer salad that I had ready to go in 15 minutes or so. Will makes many more times!

Got a little creative and added the bacon grease to the dressing mix.  Might not be the healthiest but it adds flavor and who doesn’t like bacon?  I did pop it in the microwave just to warm up and thin out the dressing. It does help distribute it more evenly.  Refrigerate before serving and Wa La.

Great ingredient mix just way too sweet for us even though I halved the sugar. Will definitely make this again and cut the sugar back to 1/4 of what it called for.

This is a hit at any picnic.  Super easy and even better when prepped the night before.  I made this without bacon and only used half the sugar and opted to go with golden rasins.  I must of had a half dozen people ask for the recipe.  Funny thing is I requested the recipe from a good friend after she made this a few times at picnics.

Simple to make, delicious. Used less sugar (2-3 T less) and it was plenty sweet. Bacon added just the right amount of salt with no additional salt needed. Added black pepper as well. Instead of raisins, used craisins and toasted my coarsely chopped raw almonds. Delicious for several days. Plan on taking for pot luck next month and making it as stated in my review adding bacon last so I can make a vegetarian version and non-vegetarian version easily.

This is awesome actually all the recipes I have done from this sight are great. I am not sure if it matters but I did use Hellmann's MAYO. I am a Miracle whip guy but I think it would be to tangy. I eat this every couple days. The bacon YUM. Its just a good mixture.

Great salad but too sweet in our opinion, so we cut the sugar by half and love it now. We also don’t add raisins and DO add some shredded cheddar. Just right. Thanks for a good base!

Very taster. I made with less sugar and more broccoli.  I also used red wine vinegar.  I used about half an onion because of the advice of others and because I was going to eat it about an hour after making so I didn’t have time to let the onion mellow. You could use othe rnuts or other dried fruit and easily make it your own.

Delicious! I used toasted pecans and waited to add the nuts and bacon until I was ready to serve (I didn't want either to get mushy). I was pressed for time and instead of using the dressing in the recipe, I used Marie's Cole Slaw dressing and it worked very well.  As suggested by others, I cut back on the red onion and when I make it again I'll use about a third of an onion. Thank you for submitting this recipe.

This was fantastic.

I used Duke's Mayo and a third tablespoon of white wine vinegar to adjust it to my taste. 

I felt the full amount of red onion was just right. I chopped it fine and mixed it with the dressing and bacon bits and let those flavors meld before adding them to the bowl of fresh broccoli florets.

I chilled the salad overnight without nuts. And I toasted the slivered almonds at 350 degrees for 8 minutes before adding them right before serving.

Always a hit! I made some tweaks to make it go farther - added chopped cauliflower, a handful of shredded cheese and chopped bacon, and I use whatever nuts I have on hand (this time it was pumpkin seeds!). There’s never a bite left!

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used Craisins & sunflower seeds instead of raisins & almonds.  I also subbed red wine vinegar for white and then doubled the dressing.  New family favorite!

This dish had people going back for seconds. My mother in law who hates broccoli raved that this salad was the only good way to eat broccoli. I used the whole pound of bacon, and since I don't keep wine vinegar in the house, I used the same amount of raw apple cider vinegar instead.

I leave out the bacon, putting it in a dish for those who don’t eat pork. It’s delicious without the bacon too!

I have made this recipe many times, but believe it or not, I only use one tablespoon of sugar, and it was plenty sweet for me..  (the original recipe I had was very similar but recommended 3 tablespoons).  I used to cook the bacon strips as per the recipe,, but now I buy the bagged cooked Costco bacon bits (you can keep it in the freezer freshness & it does not freeze into an icy block).  I pour some into a pan and cook it to brown & crisp, and drain on a paper towel.  Saves a lot of time.
As per other's suggestions, I am going try blanching the broccoli .

Easy to make. Everyone loved it. I had to use apple cider vinegar since I did not have white and I added shredded carrots for more color. I think I used more chopped broccoli than was called for (large bag of cut fresh). It still turned out great. Will be making again and it will get added to the rotation.

So, so good! I actually like broccoli now! I made this recipe EXACTLY as stated and it is PERFECT as written.  Make it a day ahead because the flavors need to blend and it is a lot better the second day. 
The recipe does not need any changes but I wanted to make it a little healthier because I plan to make it often.  The second time I made it,  I used "light" mayo, plain white vinegar because I ran out of white wine vinegar (made no difference),  white onion because I ran out of red onion (this was fine too), and turkey bacon instead of regualr bacon. It was still REALLY good considering it was so much lighter.  The biggest difference was the texture of the turkey bacon, which doesn't get as crunchy and crumbly as real bacon. I will continue to make it both ways depending on what inredients I have on hand and what is on sale.

I was asked to bring something to a family reunion attended by well over 50 people! I was staying at a cottage and only had limited counter space and utinsels.  I tripled the recipe and my husband came to tell me it was the first item gone in the buffet!  I heard everyone talking about it; even kids loved it!   Thankful for this on-line recipe holder!

I thought this was a great recipe.  It tastes like Sweet Tomatoes broccoli salad.  I didn't add raisins because I didn't have them and I used a bit less sugar than it called for.

Just made this salad and I thought it was great!
The onions didn't bother us a bit since we love red onions.
I did run out of almonds so I threw in some walnuts instead also I had a little shredded cheese that I needed to use up so I threw that in too....maybe about 3-4 ounces of colby jack fine shred. I will definitely make again.

I used a small broccoli crown because I was making it for 2 people.  I also used 1/3 cup mayonnaise, slightly less than 1/4 cup sugar (you could even use less), 3 slices thick bacon and 1/4 sweet white onion, and 2 tbsp. white wine vinegar. It was delicious.

Believe every positive review you read. this salad absolutely took me by surprise. I went into it thinking "okay, I'm seeing these ingredients and...eh." boy was I mistaken. sweet, crunchy, light, and addicting. It wasn't until I was on my third plate that I realized how truly wonderful the taste was.

I highly suggest (as others have before me.) to cut the onion by 1/4th of the recipe. it helps bring a nice homogenization to the dish.

Such a soft, subtle blending of flavors.  it's as if all of the different tastes are enjoying a nice summer night jacuzzi in your mouth. Nobody is overpowering anybody else, they're all just chill and enjoying being with each other.

Please, make this salad before you decide it's for you.  You will certainly be surprised and hopefully a fan Broccoli Rules!

What  a great and refreshing salad!!  I love cranberries so I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, YUM!! I used fewer onions and tried the sweet onion instead of red (I'll use red onions next time).  Thanks for the warning of too many onions.

Made this for our grandson's graduation open house.  Made a triple batch.   People came up to me and told me they loved it and it was the only salad that was almost all gone after everyone left!!  I followed the recipe except substituted sunflower seeds for the almonds and added cauliflower because I love it!! I made it the night before the party but did not add the bacon, seeds and golden raisins until a couple of ours before the party started.  Will definitely make it again and again!!!

Great side for chicken casserole when you want something green and cool. Nice blend of flavors. There was too much dressing, maybe my heads of broccoli were small. Next time I will cut the dressing ingredients in half or use more broccoli, also need to cut the red onion smaller and reduce the sugar.

We love this.  I will add cauliflower also.  If I do not have white wine vinegar, I use red wine vinegar.  I omit the onions and I use dried cranberries instead of raisins.  I will also add pecans if I have them .

I loves it with my changes; that's the reason for 4 stars. I used less onions. I sauteed the onions and broccoli in the bacon grease. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins.

This is a recipe that will get you raves everytime. I make it with halved red grapes and toasted almond slivers. I sometimes add cubed yellow cheese.  It's the dressing that people love just adjust the sugar to your liking.

Loved this salad. 

I replaced the mayo with plain Greek yogurt and added a little less red onion. Everything else was perfect

Perfect balanced taste!!! Tasted exactly like the salad I had at a Brazilian steakhouse. I think this will be my new go to side dish for BBQ's. Was very simple to make.

I made this salad for an Easter lunch and I was  asked to make it again for a birthday  dinner party, so everyone really liked it.  I used my food processor this time I made it and chopped the broccoli in small batches so I could control a bite size chop. Much easier. I also chopped the bacon same way. I used golden raisins. I used a bit less sugar and I used about 3/4 of an onion. The salad has a nice balance of textures and flavors.

Everyone in our extended family loves this salad and asks me to bring enough for each gathering PLUS extra so they can have some to take home as leftovers!  I use Apple Cider vinegar and make it the night before the event.  I also cook the bacon the night before and keep it in a baggie in the fridge then toss it in right before serving so it's still crisp.  We have a nut allergy child in the family so the slivered almonds are kept in a separate container for those who want to add them at the table.

This is my favorite broccoli salad.   It is the the best! My husband and I agree.  First we made it just like written.   5 star, I just used too strong an onion, so 2nd time I cut amount in two.  Also we added a pre-cooked chicken so we could eat that for supper.   I love the sauce.

I've been making this for years and I always have to look up the dressing recipe. I used apple cider vinegar this time instead of my usual white distilled, and it was too sweet for me. Otherwise, this is my usual recipe. (My ingredients are a bit different however, broccoli, bacon, red onion, and cubed swiss cheese.)

This is exactly what I was craving! Such a good and refreshing salad. I didn't use as much mayonnaise/sugar as the recipe called and half an onion for just to try and keep it a bit more healthy. Will definitely make again!

This salad is sooo good. Definitely DON'T use a whole onion, though! Just use 1/4 or less. I use  sunflower seeds instead of almonds for an easier to chew texture. And you can get some extra tangyness by using half raisins/half cranberry raisins. It tastes great fresh, or on the first day of leftovers, but after that the onion starts to taste off. This stuff is seriously addictive!

I love this salad,  and so do the people I've served it to especially using grapes instead of raisins and also using the dressing on the Bodacious Broccoli Salad instead as it tastes better to me, less sugar and more vinegar with a little lemon juice-- just don't use the amount of pepper it lists as it must be a mistake.

Spot on taste, can easily substitute to Vegetarian or Vegan versions. Only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because of the unhealthy amount of sugar added.

This salad is easy to make and a real crowd pleaser. I would always ask my sister-in-law to bring it on family get together. Thought I'd try to make it myself this time. Turned out great. The only thing I changed was the raisins. I don't care for them so I used dried cranberries instead. I think it gives it more flavor.

This is a great recipe. I made a few tweaks to suit my taste. Lightly steamed the broccoli to improve the texture, boosted the balance by adding an extra tbsp of white wine vinegar, and replaced the raisins with craisins to reduce the sweetness and to add a pop of colour. Hope you enjoy ??

Great recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly and found that my personal preference was to use half the amount of red onion. My family loves this salad.
It is sweet, but my family likes sweet. Even my granddaughter likes it!  So, she gets her veggie!  Yay!

This is  an amazing recipe. It's a delicious and refreshing change from my usual tossed green salad. It's incredibly versatile and tolerates substitutions well.  My family doesn't eat bacon, I didn't have a red onion, and didn't have white wine vinegar. No problem!  I omitted the bacon, used a regular yellow onion (chopped), and used cider vinegar. I toasted the almonds, cut the mayonnaise to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 teaspoon of celery seeds.  I made the salad about 2 hours in advance to allow the flavors to blend.  It turned out great!  There were no leftovers.  This is a keeper - I will definitely make it again.

Awesome recipe! Had something similar at Soup Plantation and I was craving this for Thanksgiving. Made it for the family and it was a hit! Several requests to make it for Christmas dinner!!

I've made this as written above and with variations. Really versatile and Always great!  I've used grapes and craisins, various vinegars,  reg onion vs red onion,  reduced fat and regular,  with and without cheese.  Never fails.

I really loved the salad, but I do have to admit that I added a few ingredients. Because it was for the holidays, I added red pepper for color. I altered the dressing only because I could- I love the assortment of vinegars and oils I have, and I cannot resist using them any chance I can get. The dressing- I added 1/2 cup sour cream, 3 Tablespoons of Chocolate Jalepeno balsamic vinegar,  1 1/2 tablespoons of Citrus Habanero olive oil (Just for flavor), shakes of smoked paprika. I used no sugar because of the balsamic vinegar.) Let this sit a couple of hours before serving to meld all the wonderful flavors together. Absolutely delicious.

My mom makes this all the time, except she is diabetic, so she sweetens it with Stevia instead of sugar... and no raisins. It is delicious!!

This was really good but I thought the sauce was a little too sweet and needed a little twang.  I added a bit of lemon juice and that made it great!  I also subbed the almonds for sunflower seeds because of a friends nut allergy and that was good too.

Made this as a Thanksgiving dinner side. I doubled the recipe (except for the sugar, which I kept at 1/2 cup) and it was still a little too sweet. Used plumped golden raisins which I think added to the sweetness. I added the chopped onion (just 1) in the dressing as other readers advised, then mixed it all together a couple hours before serving. Delicious, but next time will not use as much sugar.

This is one of my go to recipes that I return to again and again. It is delicious! I use red wine vinegar (I think I just subbed it the first time I made it and kept on using it.) Sometimes I use craisins instead of raisins which is really good. I use about a third to a half a red onion cut very fine, otherwise it is too strong.  Even my kids (2 and 4) like this salad! It does taste better after it sits in the fridge for a few hours.

A nice fresh salad! I changed the recipe around a bit- steamed the broccoli for 5 mins, added only 2 teaspoons of sugar plus a little bit of chipotle paste  and substituted in red wine vinegar (which gave it a nice color).

This recipe is easy and the end result is delicious and colorful.   It was even better the next day.  I know a lot of the comments say to cut back on the onion, but I put the whole thing in and it was great.  I used chopped up pecans instead of almonds and I thought that really added to it.

Same great broccoli salad I've tasted many times.  I followed the recipe with the following changes:
Used only 1/3 cup sugar (may still be good with 1/4 cup)
Used pecans instead of almonds

I make a somewhat similar broccoli salad, but omit the sugar, onions (I dislike them raw) and mayo: I add a small amount of oil & a larger amount of wine vinegar, plus dried golden raisins & cranberries (which provide plenty of sweetness for my taste) and slivered almonds (pecans would also be tasty, but they don't hold up as well over time if I make a large batch).  This is a really good salad, IMHO--nice sweet/sour combination and a satisfying crisp crunchiness.  However, I take exception to the slam on broccoli generally: most people have only eaten it sadly over-cooked.  Broccoli steamed or boiled in salted water just until it's crisp is delicious: to keep from over-cooking it, either cut an "X" into each end of the larger stem pieces or cut them into smaller pieces so they'll be tender-crisp when the florets are done.  (I throw the stems into the boiling water first, then add the florets.)  Also, when they've cooked enough, empty the pot into a colander & quickly run cold water over the broccoli so it doesn't continue cooking once out of the pot.  (If you find that your stems are a bit too crisp, next time fish out the florets with a slotted spoon and give the stems another minute or so to finish.)

Usually when my husband I try any new recipes, once we taste it, we add  ingredients, put less in of a particular ingredient or eliminate  it altogether.  This recipe is absolutely perfect!  No tweeking necessary!  And the flavors! Best broccoli salad I have ever had by far!

Very good, sweet, with a tang. The second time I made it, I substituted honey for the sugar and sautéed the onions in the bacon fat until just about caramelized.  Wow! Family, including picky 9 year old couldn't eat it fast enough. Had to make another batch the next night!

I've had this before. Real tasty. Love the sweet raisins with the salty bacon! In mine, I blanched the broccoli for a few minutes to soften it slightly. Still had a crunch, just not as intense as completely raw broccoli.
I've been thinking about adding honey and dijon mustard to the dressing as well!

I love this salad. I use sunflower seeds. I like the saltiness of the sunflower seeds with the sweetness of the dressing. The vinegar cuts the harshness of the red onion after it macerates for a while. If your not a big fan of onions, use sweet onions instead of red ones. Great combination of different flavors and textures.

This was really easy, and really good. I used sunflower seeds because I didn't have almonds, and I left out the bacon because I didn't have that either. I made this to take to a potluck at the last minute and luckily had everything else. It was devoured!  Thanks for sharing!

so tasty and super easy to make. I only add  1/2 red onion and instead of sliced almonds I add sunflower seeds.

Way to much sugar!  It was a bit like eating candied broccoli.  We like all of the ingredients though.  So we made it again with the following changes;   I reduced sugar to 3 tablespoons, only used 1/2 the red onion and replaced almonds (for allergy reasons) with roasted salted pumpkin seeds.

Really good. I didn't add as much sugar to make it not as sweet. I also added some of the bacon drippings to the Dressing to add just a little more baconness.

Great recipe.  I used stevia instead of sugar and used rice vinegar because I didn't have any white wine vinegar.  My husband couldn't get enough!

More please. Great textures and flavor. We substituted some Sriracha bacon jerky from trader joes which added a sweet spicy bite, and the jerky maintained its texture and didn't get soggy.  This may be one of my favorite recipes of all time.

Ordinarily I try to prepare the recipe as written the first time. However, based on many reviews, I made some adjustments. I cut back the red onion & let it marinade with the sauce overnight. It still had an overwhelming taste of onion. It's possible that particular onion was especially strong. I also cut back the sugar to about one TBSP. It was still sweet. I used 3 heads of broccoli. Head size obviously varies as it didn't make enough to serve 9 as the recipe indicated; so I added some cauliflower. I blanched the broccoli for 30 seconds & cooled it in ice water, which kept it a bright green & still very crunchy.  I plumped golden raisins with hot water. I believe the raisins give the recipe all the necessary sweet flavor. I also recommend toasting the almonds. I'll try this again reducing the onion further & eliminating the sugar.

This is a gréât recipe. If you can chop vegetables, you can make this and will enjoy the results. I agrée with many other reviewers who said it is better if it has a chance to marinate overnight. I would say, go easy on the sugar because the raisins are very sweet. I used golden raisins.  And I threw in some chopped walnuts because they are good for you. I usually use cider vinegar but today I used white wine vinegar.  Just use whatever vinegar you like.

I add pasta(rotini) to mine. You can make a lot more and it eases up on the broccoli,  As it can get expensive.

We really enjoyed this salad. It is a new go to for the dressing alone! I did allow it to sit overnight and found that I liked it better. I did add more bacon and also added cheese as my husband loves both. We will be having this many more times! I used the red wine vinegar also.

I made the following changes:
Red Wine, Craisins, 4 Mexican Cheese, No bacon, 3/4 of the Sugar, 3/4 of the Red Onion, At minimum make 24 hours ahead of time to allow the flavors to rise. I used flavored cashews but I am certain almonds will do fine.
1 head of broccoli equals 3 1/2 cups of broccoli florets. Because I needed to make enough for 10 people, I used 3 heads of broccoli. You may have to double the salad dressing and add as needed. Although I cooked the bacon, I decided not to use it because the salad was served at a cook-out and I wanted it to complement the barbecue. It worked! The onions were reduced because it looked more like an onion salad and I was afraid people would be turned off.

Made this for an office potluck. Added halved red grapes instead of raisins and no bacon and instead of 1 cup of mayo, I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 plain Greek yogurt.  It was a hit. Co-workers loved it. All gone by the end of the day. My sister was disappointed that I didn't have leftovers to bring home afterward.

This is an very good salad, one that I've made many times over the last few years. You can substitute craisins for the raisins and red wine vinegar for the white wine vinegar. Some other changes I've made to suit my family's preferences -- reduce red onion to 1/4 cup, reduce mayonnaise to 3/4 cup and reduce sugar to 5 tablespoons.

Fast 'n easy.  Made some changes by replacing Mayo with Veginase, Swerve sugar replacement, organic raisins, organic bacon, sour cream,  organic Gamelli noodles. and organic frozen broccoli.   Tastes great and you can feel good about what's going down the tummy.

Always on the lookout for a new way to prepare broccoli, I decided to give this a try.  Other than halving the recipe and using a bit less sugar, I followed the recipe as directed.  What a great combination of crunch, sweet and a tad of sour.

This is a great salad I used less onion as others have stated. I also added a teaspoon of roasted minced garlic and it is awesome.

I make this about every two or three weeks because my husband and I both LOVE it!  I do wait until serving to add the bacon and nuts though so they keep their crunch.   Have tried various types of vinegars, red wine, white wine and cider; and sunflower seeds, slivered almonds, cashews; and both regular and golden raisins.  Whatever I have on hand seems to be our favorite at the time.  Even had a friend of my sister's, who I didn't know, call me out of the blue for the recipe!  I guess word gets around about how good this is.

I  love this salad, it's a tasty way for me to eat raw broccoli! I reduce the amount of sugar to just 2-3 Tbsps. The onion does mellow out, and I love making a big batch and having this salad the day or two after. Make sure the bacon is tasty to add a kick.

This was a great easy recipe-everyone loved it. I only used 1/2 a red onion (I was too scared to use the whole thing) and subbed in cranberries just because I had them. Will definitely share the recipe and make this again and again.

The dressing on this is delicious. I use the white balsamic and always add a little extra for some extra tang. I like to add tortellini pasta to this to give it a little extra and make it into a meal instead of a side dish.

I made it with only broccoli, carrots, and purple onion.    I really like how simple the sauce was and it was yummy.  The most time consuming part was just cutting the vegetables.  If you add in raisins you might want to consider cutting back on the sugar a bit.  I

The combination of mayo, sugar and vinegar left this tasting like sugar.  I had to add a cup of milk,  another two tablespoons of vinegar and a half cup of mayo to even out the taste.  Since I basically changed the amounts of everything, I would not give this a high rating.

I'm literally just starting to learn how to cook and put meals together for myself. Mainly to plan out meal preps to maintain my workout schedule and such. This recipe is soooo daaaamn good! I used lowfat mayo and it still tastes amazing. Next time, I will play with the amounts of sugar and mayo to lower some of the cals, but overall, it's a great recipe. It's perfect for making ahead of time and storing it in little containers as a tasty snack later in the week =D

If I haven't written a review of this, it was an oversight.  I love this salad and except for the large amount of sugar and mayo, it is perfection, but I wish people would put exact measurements of vegetables when they submit recipes.  A head of broccoli varies greatly and it would make it simpler to prepare.  I always substitute craisins for the raisins because of my intense dislike of raisins.

This was really good! I substituted 1/2 cup lite mayo and 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt. I also used a little bit less sugar than it called for. Make in advance and let it chill so that the onion flavor is not too overpowering.

Another great broccoli salad!  This is different, in that it uses sliced almond rather than sunflower seeds.  I made this for the 4th of July celebration and everyone who tried it, loved it!  I mixed the dressing up in the morning and added it to the other ingredients about 45 minutes before serving.  Everything stayed nice and crisp and the flavors blended really well together.

I used about 1/2 c. of chopped pecans. 10 slices of thinly sliced bacon-fried crispy, 1/2 thinly sliced red onion OR about 5 green chopped onions, 2 pkg of Fresh market broccoli florets- much easier to cut up), 1c or 1/2 c. raisins( reg raisins are way cheaper than golden and they taste the same to most people, 1/4 c. sugar, 1 c. or 3/4 c. mayo, 2 TLB red wine vinegar. I have made this many times and used many variations, but ALL turned out just fine! It's delicious!

Love this recipe. I didn't have any wine vinegar but I had rice vinegar. I find it sweet so I only added about 2 tsp. of sugar. I plumped my raisins in warm water as "Phoebe" suggested and I also added diced apple. This was a hit at the party we went to. Thanks!

I added celery, cherry craisins, some red grapes ,  grape tomatoes,Chopped green onions,  fresh grated asiago cheese  , toasted almonds and sunflower seeds. I used honey in place of sugar , cider vinegar and cut down on mayo and used low sodium crispy bacon amount ( maybe about 3-4 strips ) to make it healthier also added more cider vinegar  this is DELICIOUS!! Will make it again for sure .. Sorry ladies I don't measure so not sure how much I use I've been cooking like this for decades

I've made this twice now and it tastes great.  To save on time I bought the pre-cooked bacon.  I don't measure just add what looks good.  I also used sweet yellow onion instead of red.  Lastly, I used cider vinegar verses white wine vinegar due to preference.  I cut back on the sugar the 2nd time too b/c it is very sweet as written.

Super tasty! My review is based on these changes. I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon, and only used half a red onion, diced. I had light miracle whip on hand so swapped that out for the mayo, and as miracle whip is already sweet I used approximately 2T of sugar. Will make again for sure!

This recipe was very good! I love the flavor of the sauce!!  I have tried numerous sauces for this type of recipe but they have always been way to vinagery. In addition, my family doesn't like onions or almonds so I substituted cheese and sunflower kernals. I also used an assortment of craisins.

As previously stated, this is a great pot luck recipe.  It holds up well when not being served right away.  I rated 4 of 5 stars as the base flavours of fresh broccoli, onion and bacon are great together, however, I changed it up quite a bit to fit our tastes.  I increased the broccoli to 3 large crowns, increased the bacon to 3/4 lb. of thick sliced bacon, chopped and then fried to crispy and drained on paper towel, reduced the red onion to approx. 1/4 cup so was not so over-powering, omitted the nuts and raisins and added 1 cup of grated, extra old Balderson's white cheddar cheese.  For the dressing, I used 1 cup mayo with 2 Tbsp. of sugar and 4 Tbsp. of white wine vinegar (not so sweet).  It was a big hit!

I only used 1/2 red onion and even found that to be  A LOT! Next time only adding 1/4 of an onion. I used my food processor to chop the onion. I am hoping the dressing will tame down the onion flavour as it sits in the fridge in the already dressed salad. Otherwise, it is a great recipe. I also took someone else's advice and substituted part of the mayo with sour cream. Added craisins and slivered almonds and bacon. Yummm! My big advice is reconsider the onion amount you are adding.

This is such a tasty salad.  Even my 3 year old (who despises broccoli) enjoys eating this.  It's a staple for our Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners.  I substitute scallions in place of the onions.  It still gives it a little kick, but is much less subtle.  I also prepare everything the night before but keep the dressing separate.  I add the dressing in the morning and let it marinate for a couple of hours.

This salad is delicious.  I usually make it without the almonds though.  Also, for the dressing, I use Marie's cole slaw dressing(in the refrigerator section of the produce department).

Made it for a potluck at Church. Everyone liked it. Be sure to cut the broccoli in very small pieces. I used Crasins and Splenda, then topped with nacho shredded three cheese.

I took the advice of many other reviews and made this a day ahead, but I liked it best when it was first made! One thing I missed was cheese! Next time I will be adding that! Also, since I don't like raisins, I added cranberry raisins instead!

Family favorite!  I use a lot less onion.  I stick with mayonnaise on this salad instead of miracle whip (my usual favorite) - that way it's not too sweet.  My hubby doesn't like onions much but LUVS when I make this salad!

This is a favorite. When I take it to pot lucks, people always ask for the recipe. I add less than 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes to the mayo mixture, to give it a little heat. I don't add the bacon, nuts, and raisins, until just before serving, so they don't get soggy.

Loved the variety of ingredients in this recipe. And you can see the ingredients , not weighted down by the dressing. Only thing I would change is just a little less onion.

This is like one my family has made for a long time but instead of almonds, we use pistachios, roasted pine nuts or walnuts. The almond flavor gets lost in the dressing next to the onions. We use dried cranberries instead of raisins to get an tangy/sweet next to the salty flavors. It also adds a splash of color that is very appealing. Also, we top it with some bacon cooked crunchy in small pieces.  We dont usually put this salad together until right before it will be served as the bacon, nuts and fruit have a tendency to get mushy overnight and lose a lot of fun and interesting texture.  Try it with cranberries, bacon and a stronger flavored nut and it is perfection.  The dressing on this recipe is spot on. If you dont have vinegar, you can use lemon juice and honey also is a wonderful sub. for sugar for smooth flavor.

Similar to other reviewers I used half the onion, half light mayonnaise with other half light sour cream ... may have used a little more sour cream.  I didn't have raisins so used dried cherries. I wasn't sure about the raw broccoli and how it would taste in a salad but the whole combination was fabulous, and perfect for our 100+ degree weather!

Made this without onion.  Used dried cranberries instead of raisins and sliced roasted almonds.  To make it even quicker and easier I used pre-packaged bacon pieces.  Yum!!  Will make often!

I decided to use three heads of broccoli, and scaled up the other ingredients to match, following another reviewer's suggestion of adding two 9oz pkgs of cheese tortellini and I could not be more pleased with the results. This is a really stellar recipe.

I'm happy to have found this recipe, as I've had it on several occasions at bbq parties. Now I can make my own. Thanks. The only thing I changed was to reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup - otherwise it would be on the dessert table.

Delicious recipe, I think the ingredients went well together however, perhaps 1 whole onion is too much. Next time I will use half an onion and less sugar as well. I added a pinch of salt which made it perfect!!

This recipe is easy to make. I cut the sugar to a fourth cup and used sunflower seeds instead of almonds.  I used more broccoli than called for so I upped the mayo by 1/2 cup. I added 8 ounces of shredded Colby cheese instead of bacon.  I added five tablespoons of red wine vinegar. I forgot the raisins. Everyone loved it.

This salad is always a hit at parties...some minor changes, I've used half the amount of sugar, which was recommended by another post and I use balsamic vinegar which works out great. I also use dried cranberries which adds a nice tartness to it. I like the idea of making it the night before to let the flavors mix and then add the bacon right before serving. I'll try that this weekend.

My husband loves this mayonnaise salads, I was looking for somthing a bit healthier.  So I added much less mayonnaise and no sugar.  I did add a couple of drops of stevia.. It is awesome. No way I could  eat it with all that sugar and don't think it is necessary. Also didn't add raisins, don't like them. Added walnuts and pine nuts.  Yum

Delicious.  Subbed dried cranberries for the raisins since I don't like raisins.  Subbed balsamic for the white wine in order to reduce the amt of sugar in the recipe.  Decreased sugar to about 1/3 of a cup and next time would probably decrease it to 1/4 cup.  Tasted great the first day but was too sweet on the second.  Will definitely be making again.

I make this with a few changes, no onion,no raisins and no almonds. Instead I put in Sharp Cheddar cheese (small cubes),  Walnuts (chopped), green seedless grapes (cut in half length wise). It is  always a hit and every bit goes where ever I bring it.

love the dressing but I prefer it with much less onion (sometimes I use green onion instead- either way it needs to be grated or extremely finely minced), craisins instead of raisins, and no nuts.

I used half plain yogurt and half mayo to save some calories. It worked like a charm! I would recommend less sugar, but otherwise, a classic, delicious dinner salad.

This recipe always reminds me of mom and summer picnics. Now that I'm a mom I make it for my kids. They do not like dried fruit or nuts of any kind so I go heavier on the bacon and eliminate the raisins and almonds and follow the rest of the recipe exactly the same.They like a little shredder cheese on top after they fill their bowls. It a great way to get them to eat raw broccoli.

Very good recipe. A hit at a BBQ last weekend. I used Craisin's instead of raisins.  The dressing had to be doubled because I used the Costco bag of broccoli.  I also used the Costco real bacon bits and it was so easy to make!

I made this with homemade mayonnaise and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and OMG it was good.  I also blanched the broccoli for about 45 seconds and rinsed in ice water, just to cut the taste of raw broccoli.  You have to let it sit in the fridge for a good 30 minutes at least, to really meld the flavors together.

Great change from the normal salad! Added a little extra bacon and went light on the onions. Added salt and pepper to balance the sweetness of the dressing. My husband doesn't like raisins, so I left them out of the bowl and added them as a side option. Delicious!

Yes..I loved it. I think less sugar would work too. But overall a good receipe. Great for summer.

Used sunflower seeds instead of almonds. Made it the day before so the broccoli could marinate in the dressing but waited to add bacon and seeds until just before serving so they would stay crispy. This made a lot!

Wow - I used fresh local brocolli,Ready to Use Real Bacon pieces,toasted sliced almonds, and a handful each of dried blueberries and craisens.  This salad acted as our only side with bar-b-qued chicken thighs when the temperatures soared this week in the Annapolis Valley to +32C.  It was great and I will certainly make it again. I did cut the onion to about 1/4 cup, but that is a personal thing and our latest red onions have been fairly strong.

Just tried this recipe this past weekend and LOVED IT!  I used golden raisins and slivered almonds (versus sliced almonds).  I also sauteed the red onion in a little bit of the bacon grease just to give the salad more "bacon flavor" (I really LOVE bacon!).  This salad is just THE BOMB!

We really enjoyed this salad! I only used half of the red onion. I also went light on the sugar. I didn't have raisins so I used pomegranate craisins because I had a bag in the pantry. It was delicious!

I made this for fathers day. My dad and mom loveddddd it and I just liked it. I think it was because I knew there was a lot of mayo in it (not the biggest fan). Alone I was very skeptical about it but after putting everything together it was good! Not the best, but pretty good. The only adjustment I made was add walnuts along with the almonds.

I use apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar & I use Turkey bacon bits in a bag instead of frying the bacon - cuts prep time down a lot. I also added cherry tomatoes

This was pretty good! I followed the recipe exactly but then added more broccoli at the end b/c it seemed like there was way too much dressing. Turned out great!

Left out the onions, substituted sunflower seeds for the almonds.  So good!  I actually love onions and put them in almost everything I make, but I do think this recipe does better without.  I'm not a big fan of broccoli, but this recipe makes it way more than tolerable!

this is a great foundation for a delicious salad. I use half the sugar and half the onion and instead of raisins I use pomegranate to give the salad a bright and delicious finish. I could eat it all summer long!

We REALLY like this!!!  After making this 3-4 times, I now substitute dried cranberries for the raisins (like the tartness of the cranberries & the red color) and I add 6-8 oz. shredded mozzarella or Pepper Jack cheese -- seems to really add something!  But this recipe is wonderful as is or with variations.  Thanks!

My family loved this recipe. I used less than a half of the onion and only used a little bit more than 1/3 cup of sugar even that was too much so I added a bit more mayo and added pepper to settle it down. Also I added 2 more slices of bacon. Otherwise it was WONDERFUL!!

Love this recipie. I made it using a lower calorie/ low fat option.  Instead of mayo I used plain yogurt and substituted the sugar with xylitol and a little bit of stevia.  I also used turkey bacon, to lower the fat.   It was wonderful! A great dish to fill up on!

Great recipe - way too much onion - half of a medium onion is more than enough. I have also taken out the bacon and substituted hickory smoked almonds to give some of that same flavor sans the bacon. Ensure you don't make it too far in advance of serving or the broccoli gets soggy as with any recipe of this kind.

I have been looking for a fresh broccoli salad recipe for a long time. This is so yummy I make it at least 2 times a month. Makes a great lunch for on the go or at your desk.  I tried it with truvia was ok but to sweet would cut back the truvia even more... Enjoy it will become one of your favorites. I would not use a whole onion was a little much, other than that delicious.

This was really good. I halved the sugar as other reviewers said, and I felt it was plenty. I would add the extra head of broccoli as I felt there was too much dressing.

This was great.  I used olive oil mayo to help with the fat content.  It is also great with crasins instead of raisins.

I doubled the dressing, used 1/2 of a red onion and used about 4-5 heads of broccoli. I used craisins instead of raisins and sunflower seeds instead of almonds. I added shredded sharp cheddar cheese right before serving. Everyone LOVED it and many asked for the recipe!

I changed the receipe to a lighter version.  Light mayo and instead of raisens, I used crannberries.  And i add less sugar.  I just love this receipe.

This was a great salad!  I have become very "picky" about my salads as I have learned to cook better, and this one passed the test.  I have made it a couple of times now, and will continue to use it before any others.  Thanks for a great, stable recipe!!

One of the best broccoli salads I have tasted! I'm not a big fan of raisins, so I cut those back to 1/2 cup. I chilled the salad for a few hours, adding the bacon just prior to serving. it was absolutely wonderful.

This is such a great salad. I made it with light mayo and 1/4 cup sugar. I also used apple cider vinegar because it was all I had. I added about a teaspoon more of the vinegar for more zing.Used golden raisins as well. Even with the light  mayo it tastes quite rich. Maybe I'll use half yogurt half light mayo next time. It is truly the best way to eat broccoli, hands down.

Served this salad to my family and everyone loved it. I used 3 heads of broccoli and the same amounts of raisins, etc. and there was plenty. I did find it a little too sweet, next time I will decrease the amount of white sugar.

Delicious! I used regular vinegar and it was still wonderful. Rave reviews from our guests. I'm making it again for a Girl Scout camp this weekend as I'm guessing this is a brilliant way to get kids to eat their broccoli!

Great Recipe.  I used Golden Raisins and sunflower seeds instead of almonds.  I did not have white wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar, great flavor and used turkey bacon.  My husband loved this salad!!!

Solid base for this recipe. I cut back on the onion (or maybe I just had a REALLY big onion) and swapped out almonds for sunflower seeds. Slightly adjusted mayo/sugar/vinegar mix to taste before adding to the salad.

Absolutely delicious.  I used crasins versus raisins and pecans for the nuts.  I made 1 1/2 times the salad dressing so I would have extra after mixing and the dressing absorbs in to the salad.

I made this without the raisins since my husband doesn't care for them. I added extra bacon (1 lb) and extra broccoli. 
It would have been good with the raisins but was still very good without them. Everyone loved this and I will be making it again.

This recipe was terrific!  I followed it exactly except substituted fake bacon bits for the bacon as my boyfriend is a vegetarian.  He is also an extremely picky eater and was skeptical the entire time I was making the salad, but he ended up loving it as well.  Make sure to let it set a couple hours before serving.  It tasted good right after I made it, but it tasted so much better after a few hours and the broccoli softened up quite a bit so it wasn't too tough to chew.

This is AMAZING. I am eating this broccoli salad as I type. I took my first bite and I just couldn't believe how perfect the taste was. So sweet.. and I love the crunch from the bacon and almonds. Not to mention I am a total onion lover. This was my very first time making broccoli salad and I will definitely stick with this recipe. Also, I'll be making this again probably as soon as I run out of the salad I made today. Thank you!

This is an absolutely delicious summer salad, and I am not a huge broccoli lover.  It has a nice balance of flavors.  I ommitted the nuts only because I didn't have them on hand.  I also used 1 lb. center cut thick cut bacon (stood up well in this recipe), apple cider vinegar, used 1/3 red onion, and added 1 cup of shredded asiago, which added a nice tang.  Great light side salad recipe.

I made this based on ratings alone, I honestly didn't think it would go over very well.  My husband wasn't overly enthusiastic when I told him what was in it, but then he took a bite, and another, and another and asked if he had to share!  Thanks you!

Loved this recipe.  There was not a bit left over after my last family gathering.  I had to pass the recipe along to several.  The only thing I changed was, I substituted sunflower seeds in place of the almonds.  I only did this because I didnt have almonds & did have the sunflower seeds.  I'm sure the nuts would be delicious though!

Really yummy. I made a couple changes based on ingredients on hand - substituted Craisins for raisins, vidalia for red onion, and walnuts for almonds.  Also, I used only 2/3 c mayo b/c of the other reviews -  and cidar vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.  ...okay, more than a couple changes - but it is delicious!!

This salad was wonderful.  Very refreshing for the summer months.  The only change we made, we did not use raisins we used red grapes.  Made it more crunchy & sweet.  Thanks for sharing this yummy broccoli salad......we plan on making it all summer long!

This recipe has been in my family for a couple of generations.  It's always a big hit w/ women, for some reason the men in the family have never taken to it.  I use 2/3 cup of raisins and I use splenda instead of sugar (no one ever knows and the calories saved are huge!).  I use light mayo and throw in toasted almonds.

VERY TASTY.   One thing to make it MUCH easier--JUST GET THE PRE-COOKED BACON AND CRUMBLE IT!  (Or microwave a little for extra crispiness)   :-)

I give the salad 5 stars, but I did not care for the dressing.  I gave the dressing the benefit of the doubt, but, my instincts were correct, sugar and mayonnaise?  It's much better with a ranch or other white dressing.

This recipe was amazing and exactly what I was looking for! However, we did not use any bacon because we wanted a vegetarian salad. We also used miracle whip instead of regular mayo. This means you don't need nearly as much sugar. We used about 1/3 cup of sugar. We also made a trip to Whole Foods and got organic broccoli, almonds, and cranberries. A HUGE HIT!!!

I took this to a baby shower and everyone wanted the recipe! It was fantastic. I used a little less sugar, I threw in some dried onion in place of the red onion, and I cut the broccoli into small pieces. I also made this a second time without the bacon and it was still very yummy. Great recipe...you can't go wrong with this one. Just make sure you have copies of the recipe if you take it somewhere!

I never thought I would gobble up so much raw broccoli and cauliflower!!! What a refreshing blend of flavors. I added cauliflower and used splenda insead of sugar. It was delicious and I will be eating alot more vegetables since I found this recipe. Bless you for sharing.

Yum!  I omitted the raisins because my husband doesn't like them and used slightly less sugar and slightly more white wine vinegar.  I also used turkey bacon crumbles and light mayo and it turned out great.  The dressing is going to be my new go-to coleslaw recipe.

I omitted the raisins, used sunflower seeds instead of almonds, used apple cider vinegar and only about 1/4 cup of diced red onion. Really great! I just emailed copies of the recipe to my guests! They all loved it!

This was a fine salad, but it didn't suit my tastes.  My main complaint is that it was too sweet.  I also thought that the onion flavor was very strong even though I only used half an onion.  It didn't bother me much when I was eating, but I had onion breath for a while afterward.  I'm glad I tried this because it was interesting, but I don't think I'll make it again.

Loved this one! I went to a family reunion over the weekend and had this same type of salad. I never got the recipe from the host so I went searching here. This one is the closest to the one I loved over the weekend. This one adds raisins, which was a nice little pop of sweetness. I halved the mayo and vinegar and sugar though. I don't like my veggies too saucy/mayonnaisey, my husband loved it! Ill be making this for aprties from now on. Thanks!

Great recipe. I was pleasantly surprised (and so was my boyfriend). A mayo-based dressing + sugar, my initial thoughts were "gross, how did this recipe get such high ratings". But my curiosity go the best of me, and I am glad it did!

We love it! I used fat free miracle whip instead of mayo (all I ever have on hand), and I prefer it on the first day, as the broccoli is more crispy.

My whole family loves this recipe. I did tweak it just a little bit -- I use sunflower seeds instead of almonds and about 1/4 of the amount of red onion in the recipe (I find raw onion to be too strong, but a little is good). I made it for the first time for my daughter's second birthday party last month and I've had 3 requests for it since then. Definitely a winner!

I though I would give this a try, I"m not a huge fan of mayo, but my bf is. I thought the dressing was ok, could have used some Dijon mustard or something, but I thought the mixture of items were pretty good. I might tweak it somehow next time. Good stuff though!

This was so very good!  I didn't realize I didn't have any white wine vinegar, so I used raspberry balsamic instead and it was amazing.  I did do a tad less sugar - maybe a smidgen over 1/3 cup, but I think it was fantastic and a little more sugar wouldn't have hurt anything.  I did, however, feel like an entire red onion was a bit much so used about 1/3 of one.  They are huge!  But wow....this was a highlight of the BBQ.

I LOVED this broccoli salad. I thought the white wine vinegar was perfect! It was a hit and I will make it again for sure. I really liked the onion as directed because the vinegar tones it down quite a bit.

I used dried cranberries and added some shredded carrot, and it was so pretty I could not bear to add mayo to this, so I used a white wine vinegar/olive oil and herb vinaigrette... I know, I know...not the same recipe, but delicious, and five starts for inspiration.  I PROMISE to try it with mayo at some point, but my mostly veggie-hating family absolutely raved about this so I had to give my kudos to the submitter - Thank you!

Boy do I love this!  I used half broccoli and half cauliflower, roasted peanuts in place of sunflower seeds (much cheaper, and I couldn't find sunflower seeds!). Used less onion. And I also used half of the dressing mix...which seemed to be more than enough.  It would have been too soupy otherwise.

This recipe was very yummi. I used an entire package of bacon, left out the raisins and took sunflower seeds instead of almonds. I found the salad too sweet though, so next time I'll cut back on the sugar or leave it out completely.

I love this salad!  I put a head of califlower and a cup of peanuts in it as well.  My other suggestion is to leave the bacon and peanut until you are ready to serve.  I like the crunch it give the salad.

Really very tasty recipe.  I halved the bacon for health purposes, but was still very flavorful - bacon goes a long way.  I also used craisins instead of raisins and used fresh lemon juice from my lemon tree. The flavors are amazing!

Delicious salad. Made this for Christmas. I made exactly with exception of a little less mayo and sugar and then added a TSP more of white wine vinegar. This tastes better after a few hours in fridge as the dressing had time to enhance its flavor

We love this salad! It's easy to make too. The only things we do different are we use craisins (dried cranberries) instead of raisins and we use salted sunflower seeds instead of almonds. Highly recommend!!

I have never had this kind of salad before, but I was making it for a potluck Christmas dinner, and it was a HIT! Everyone loved it, and even I did, when I thought I wouldn't like it at all!

This has been a family favorite for years.  It is a must have for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I use less onion, and dice it.  Also, I add the real bacon pieces at the last minute so they don't get soggy.  Tastes like I just fried it, and it's so easy.  Even non-broccoli eaters love this salad

My sister inlaw made this at a family picnic not too long ago and it was great. The only change she made was instead of the nuts, she used sunflower seeds. I had to have the recipe and she forwarded me this one off of allrecipes.com.

It's really good.  The only thing I thought was it was too oniony.  I'd cut back on the onions to make it better.  Other than that, I loved it.

Absolutely love it! I have been making it almost every week now.  Every time I serve it, people raved about it. Excellent recipe.  If I have to make any changes, I will cut the sauce in half, personally, I like it less saucy.

This was really, really tasty.  I'm not big on raw broccoli but had the ingredients laying around and gave this a chance.  It wasn't too crunchy or soggy...great texture actually.  I omitted the bacon (don't eat pork) but loved the flavor/texture of the fruit and nut component.  Will make again.

FANTASTIC!  Ingredients sounded strange when put together, but it turned out fabulous!  I used pecans and it turned out great for our pool party.
