I think roasted vegetables are the best!  Here's the variety I used:  sweet potato, white potato, red onion, carrot, zucchini.  I tossed the first four vegetables in a large bowl until coated with the olive oil and then placed in the baking pan.  Roasted them about 20 minutes and then added the zucchini chunks that were marinated in a small amount of balsamic vinegar, s&p and basil.  Roasted about 20 minutes more.

This recipe turned out very well. We made it as an accompaniment to salmon, and the combo was delicious. We especially loved the roasted yams. Everything fit on a single baking sheet, so we just used the one. Our vegetables started burning pretty early, so I reduced the temp to 400 degrees and stirred the veggies, and that worked for us. After cooking we couldn't wait to try it, so we skipped the 30 minutes of cooling time. We wanted to eat the veggies hot, so that worked for us. We'll definitely make this one again. Would live to try it on the grill like everyone else did.

Fantastic! I used the vegetables that I had on hand and I marinated them for a couple of hours and placed them on the grill instead of roasting them - wonderful! so good!

This is the first recipe that I've felt inspired enough to rate.  It was truly outstanding.  I followed the recipe almost exactly (sweet potato, carrot, parsnip, asparagus, red and yellow roasted bell pepper, fresh basil, pressed the garlic in a garlic press), except I had a few things in the oven cooking slowly on a lower temp, so I ended up sauteeing the veggies in a frying pan uncovered with a little olive oil on medium high heat--15 minutes for the root veggies and then I added the asparagus for another ten minutes or so.  The root veggies ended up browned on all sides (it was more labor intensive than the oven--I had to stand and move them around a lot) and perfectly cooked, as was the asparagus, but the dish was done in 25 minutes and in my opinion came out better than roasting typically does.  I also chopped the roasted red peppers into very small pieces--they coated the rest of the veggies nicely that way.  Everyone went back for seconds.  The fresh garlic and fresh basil tasted amazing!  Thanks for such a keeper of a recipe.

This turned out really well! I baked mine in the oven like the recipe said and, like other users found, after 30 minutes on 425 some of the veggies were starting to burn. As suggested, I reduced the temperature to 400 for only 20 minutes longer and the vegetable turned out delicious! It says to serve room temperature but we ate the veggies warm and it was still very yummy.

OMG  These were so good. I followed the recipe but add a few more vegetables like radishes, mushrooms, green peppers and some onions. Never thought I would like parsnips but everything came out so delicious and sweet even the radishes. This is a good way to get a variety of veg. and your veg. quota for the day. You can add a little more seasoning than called for if you wish. Probably just about any veg . will work as long as you start the firm ones first and add the softer veggies later. Thanks Lorelei--now I love to eat my vegetables. BTW-they are best at room tempeature .

Omigosh, this was incredible! I used yams, zukes, yellow squash, roma tomatoes, and fresh mushrooms. Baked the yams 30 mins, and while they baked I combined the squash, tomatoes and mushrooms in a bowl with EVOO and a splash of balsamic vinegar. Roasted 25 mins. Served with shredded parmesan and ate the leftovers the next day...the flavors were wonderful! Will keep in my recipe box.

I have made this with several different veggies and we all love; even my husband the meat eater!!  A couple of thing I add are just a sprinkle of bread crumbs and even less of dried cheese and then just a very, very little drizzle of honey (does add to the calories but if you are trying to get veggies in, it works!).  We have this quite often and it works for us. 5

These were amazing!  I made this dish when I had a friend over for dinner.  She kept eating and eating them even after we were finished with dinner and I had to print the recipe for her or I don't think she would have left.  Only change was I added a red onion to the mix.  Loved that it was a room temperature dish.  Didn't have to worry about keeping it warm while I cooked the rest of the dinner.

Interestingly the picture is of grilled vegetables and not roasted.  I grilled mine and they are fantastic but I am sure they will be great roasted too.

Loved this a LOT!  I don't know from parsnips but we love yams so I did it with two yams and no parsnip.  I also didn't cut up the asparagus. I trimmed off the thick stalks and then cooked the spears.  

I cooked it all on one cookie sheet. I tossed the yams/carrots with half the oil, basil and garlic and cooked them at 375 for 30 min.  Then I tossed the zucchini/asparagus in the rest of the oil, basil, garlic and put it on the same sheet and put it back in the oven for another 20 min.  

I set it on the counter for 30 min while I prepared the rest of dinner and it was perfect!!  Delicious!!  This one is hitting the list of frequently used recipes.

I landed on this recipe (out of many!)  because I was looking more for cooking times rather than seasonings. This one works, because it recognizes that some vegs (like asparagus) don't have to cook as long as others (like carrots.) To me, no roasted veg dish is complete w/o potatoes--they just grab onto all the other veg flavors. I like to use the baby redskins and cut them in half. Also (and this came as a surprise to me), roasted Brussels sprouts are a must!!  Not a big fan of rosemary, so I use a heaping tablespoon of dried herbes de provence. Make sure all are well coated with olive oil, or they will steam rather than roast. And one more thing--a few splashes of balsamic vinegar into the mix about 10 minutes before the end of the cooking time finishes it perfectly. YUM! A perfect meatless meal!!

Because I didn't use any root vegetables this took a mere 20-25 minutes to cook.  I chose zucchini, yellow summer squash, red onion, nice big mushroom caps, and red and green bell peppers. I seasoned it with a handful of chopped parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme, and fresh minced garlic.  Delicious way to eat a variety of vegetables, easy to fix, and a quick clean up too if you line your pan with foil! I preferred to serve it hot, straight out of the oven.

I used some different veggies cause its what I had on hand: onions, carrots, potatoes, yams, zucchini, yellow squash, red and green bell peppers, fresh garlic, and fresh parsley. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning. I roasted the potatoes/yams/carrots for 30 minutes on 400 and then the rest of the veggies for about 20 minutes more. When done, I tossed it all together and served it warm and OMG it was delish! I made 2 huge pans and they were completely empty at the end of dinner with guests wanting more! Thanks for the great idea!

Yummy. I made it in 2 9x13s, the 40m & the 20m pan.  Parsnips, onions, yams (unpeeled), carrots, bells, & garlic. Accidentally added spices pre-cooking and they were great.

Outstanding!  I have never written a review before and who would have thought it would be over vegetables instead of chocolate!  I followed the recipe (other than adding an onion or two), but doubled everything since roasted veggies tend to shrink so much and it was great for a party of 20 (along with another veggie choice).  I can tell you these veggies were gone in a flash compared to boring broccoli!  I will definitely keep this recipe!

All I can say is WOW WOW WOW!  I followed the recipe exactly except that the supermarket was out of asparagus so omitted that.  Came back to the oven after the first 25 minutes and the veggies looked like they were burning!  (Adjust temp down to about 180C for convection/fan assisted oven).  I thought they were ruined but I carried on with the recipe, switching to my traditional oven to avoid any more browning.  I only cooked 20 minutes more after adding the softer veggies.  Served them warm and they were so delicious.  I make them frequently now and since adjusting the temp they come out perfectly!

I made this for our annual New Year's Day Brunch and it got raves. I prepared the vegys the day before, only adding a cut up onion (to the 1/2 hr. roasting time) &  marinated everything in 2 separate bowls (for 1 hr. & 1/2 hr. cooking times). I roasted it the next morning, and the house smelled wonderful. The fresh basil made it perfect. Due to so many requests, I will be happy to make it again.

Yummy! I didn’t bother to peel the yam. They are just as good with the skin on and you can save time that way. I checked them after 20 mins and they looked like they were starting to burn (I think I cut them too small) so I turned the oven down to 400. They took 45 minutes total. I did let them cool to room temp, but I don’t think they were better that way. Next time I will just serve them right out of the oven.

I have been cooking dinner for 40 years and just recently discovered oven roasted vegetables.  I'm in love!   They are so beautiful, so tasty, so easy.  It is my new dish to take to any pitch in, to make for any dinner party.  I love making "too much" so that I have leftovers!  They are good alone, or cooked with eggs and cheese for a quick lunch.

Delicious!  But I'm only giving the recipe a 4 as I shortened the cooking time by about 15-20 minutes.  We prefer our veggies a little less mushy than this would have been had I cooked as long as stated.  Flavors all went very well together.  For color I also added yellow squash to the mix and cut some mushrooms in half and threw in as well.  Loved what the fresh basil did for this!  We'll have these again for sure.

I left out the asparagus but added radishes.  It was good and I will be making it again but I think I will leave the parsnips out and make it more of a sweet potato and zucchini dish.  I ate the leftovers cold from the fridge and they were surprisingly good that way.  My husband didn't like it all so I can't give it 5 stars.

5 stars for taste, 4 for ease of preparation.  I think that it took a while to prepare.  What was great about the recipe is that it can sit out room temperature or be served cold.  I made for Christmas Eve - had one Gluten Free and one Vegetarian eater for dinner.  Pretty Good - lots of flavors.  Wasn't just the regular old green bean casserole for a vegetable.

So delicious--and so so easy too!  A perfect combo.  I didn't have all the veggies called for.  I used globe squash and orange pepper plus the sweet potato (which I did have!).  I modified the method slightly and used a large ziploc bag to mix all the veggies with dried basil, salt, pepper, and olive oil before roasting.  Then I went ahead and followed the second part of the directions minus adding salt and pepper to the mix.  Absolutely delicious!  It's important to watch your veggies--at 425, they can burn easily if you don't.  I ended up roasting for 30 mins, flipping them, then roasting another 10-15 for a perfect texture.  I will do this again, and with whatever veggies I have on hand.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this dish many times and have modified the vegetables to our liking.  You can really use any vegetable with this recipe.  Our favorites are mushrooms, sweet potatoes, red potato, eggplant, carrots, and squash. I love the taste of these baked vegetables and they are very healthy.  I too splash the vegetables with Balsamic Vinaigrette 10 minutes before removing from the oven.  I bake the root vegetables at 400 for 20 minutes and then add the softer vegetables to the same pan (if space permits) and cook an additional 30 minutes (or until done).  Or, bake the root vegetables for 50 minutes at 400 and in a separate pan bake the softer vegetables for 30 minutes at 400.  Great way to eat healthy vegetables!  Thank you for the recipe!

I made this the other day. It was so good. I ate it all week. first day I had it as a side. Second time I had it mixed with scrambled eggs, and another time I had it as a topping on a pita pizza! If you don't like basil you won't like it. But if you do like basil you will love it. I didn't have asparagus. I used sweet pot., white pot., yellow squash, carrots, cauliflour, red peppers, and yellow peppers. Just anything I had on hand. Line the pan with foil!

In my opinion the best, tastiest and healthiest way to get your veggies.  After you do it a few times you figure out what veggies need less cooking and just toss them in for the last 10 min or so. I usually add a splash of balsalmic at the end.  Gives an extra burst of flavour...love it.

I added more vegetables:  onions, sliced, mushrooms, yellow squash.  I thought there would be way too many vegetables, as it filled a large cookie sheet-sized pan, but we ate them right up.  What a delicious way to eat vegetables.  Next time I will cut the yams into larger pieces, as they overcooked a little.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious!  I added baby portabella mushrooms, replaced the yam with potatoes, added tomatoes (in the last 10 minutes), and a dash of balsamic vinegar at the end.  This is a great recipe!

We loved it. Can really mix it up based on what vegetables you have or what is in season. I used butternut squash, zucchini, yellow squash, baby bellas, asparagus and red onion. The roasted red peppers mixed with the garlic, basil mixtures is what makes this dish. Very pretty to serve as well.

I just added some sage and used it as stuffing in my pita bread pockets. Used Joseph's Bakery because they're diabetic certified, and the meal was delish.

One of my go-to recipes of late. For leftovers, try tossing mixed greens or spinach with a light vinaigrette and toss in the roasted veggies. Perfect satisfying salad.

Delicious and easy! Hardest part is being patient enough to wait for them to come out of the oven when they smell so good. :) This is great with any sorts of veggies. The yam and parsnips give it real heartiness.

Not only would I give this recipe a 5 star, my husband, who is vegetarian absolutely LOVED it.  I was little concerned how the asparagus would turn out but it was absolutely perfect. This dish makes a perfect side to any main dish whether it is a prime rib you are serving or a grilled salmon.  Thanks for sharing an awesome recipe!  We will be making this again & again!

I have to tell you that this recipe was one I have been looking for! I have a bunch of friends that are always giving me summer vegetables and I never know what to do with them! This was perfect. I had to change it up just a little because 425 degrees for the first round of veggies for 30 minutes was  a bit long so I just scaled it back to 400 for 20 minutes and it was perfect. You may also find as others did that you can use any veggies in this as long as you go from hardest to softest.  I put it with brown rice and I added nutmeg and paprika to the spices  --  yum!!!!  good stuff!!

Soooo yummy! I cooked the yams, parsnip and carrots at 400 degrees for 30 minutes and while that was cooking I tossed the rest of the veggies in olive oil, poured them on the pan and added the garlic and spices and it is sooo good!! Thanks for posting this recipe!!

Used all the veg's listed but added a yellow potato also.  Made such a huge bowl that I thought we would be eating these for days--not so.  Every bite was eaten at dinner.  I did not use garlic at the request of one of my dinner guests and it still turned out great.

Very easy to put together and produces a nice smoky taste for the veggies. Really enjoyed this dish. I didn't have roasted peppers so i just threw in some green bell peppers to roast together with the rest of the veggies. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Terriffic! Very Mediterranean flavor and feel. I used fresh beets in stead of parsnips and roasted my own peppers. The colors and flavors were so vibrant. I will definitely make this again. And, because it's served cold, you can make it a day ahead and ease your workload before a big party.

These turned out great!  I decided to season the vegetables before baking.  I just added everything (except asparagus and zucchini) to a gallon bag and shook them together.  Then I baked them as instructed and later added the asparagus and zucchini seasoned as well.

This recipe was great. I used fennel, parsnips, carrots, and zucchini. I didn't have red peppers, so I used 5 sun-dried tomatoes minced up. If you like garlic, 5 or 6 cloves will be fine.  It was very delightful.

This was great as written--but the second time I made it, I added the minced garlic to the sheet when I added the second batch of veggies. I preferred it that way, with the flavor of the roasted garlic. I also think cook time will be variable--the first time I roasted for an hour at 400 (so I could roast some pork at the same time) and they were overdone (neither times burnt, but mushy). The second time I cooked as written and they were still overdone. Cook times are always variable as ovens differ so I don't think it's something to gripe about--just a heads up to pay close attention!

I used butternut squash, sweet potatoes, red peppers, onion,zucchini and yellow squash. Made it for a pot luck and it was the first time I saw an entire tray of veggies cleaned out!

I made this recipe to use up some leftover veggies, so my veggie mix was a little different, but it was FABULOUS. My sister and her kids all loved it, and there were NO leftovers!

I tossed the veggies that needed to cook longer in a bowl with the olive oil, garlic and spices then onto the pan and in the oven they went. Used the same bowl for the other veggies, plus the peppers, then just added them to the pan when it was time. I served this warm, out of the oven.  It was a hit. The yam puts this recipe over the top for us, we loved it.

I forgot the yams!! (Haha) But I added broccoli and cauliflower. I didn't follow the cooking time exactly; I merely took it out of the oven every 15 minutes; at about the 45 minute mark, I added a blend of garlic, basil, salt/pepper to the mix, tossed it again and cooked it longer for about 10-15 minutes. Added some grated Parmesan cheese at the end and it turned out awesome...

SO YUMMY! I made it with potatoes, roma and cherry tomatoes, zucchini, and carrots. I heated the cubed potatoes in the microwave first for 6-9 mins. and then mixed all ingredients in a big bowl to coat oil mixture over all the vegetables. Baked them for 30 minutes and it was perfect!

My first time roasting vegetables. I used this recipe as a template. I used carrots, eggplants, red bell peppers, and zucchini. Instead of coating the spices at the end, i coated the vegetables prior to baking. I did 2 batches. First batch, I baked for 30minutes and the veggies started to burn a bit. Second batch, I did 20 mins and it was fine. I definitely think that the recipe calls for too much time. It seems like the carrots in the recipe baked for a total of 60 minutes. If I had done that, my carrots would definitely be burnt. Glad I didn't.

This came out really well, although I think 60 minutes of cooking time is too long. 40 would probably be enough to caramelize the veggies.

We all loved this veggie medley...a lot of prep but totally worth it!  Even my boyfriend liked it a lot and suffice it to say he's not a veggie eater!  (I made this with lamb chops with mint jelly, and the Wild Rice Casserole 1 and it went great together...rave reviews!)

Didn't really care for it and probably won't make again. Maybe I chose the wrong veggies but I followed the recipe. Maybe just not for us.

Love love this recipe! I didn't know parsnips could taste so good. I make this at least once a week and change the vegetables all the time. Always turns out great. It is a staple in my household.

Excellent Recipe - I only used Herb De Provence, garlic, a little smoked paprika and olive oil as my seasonings. I added whatever vegetables I knew my family would eat and also added red potatoes to the mix.  I baked my cut up red and sweet potatoes at 400 degrees first with a little olive oil and added the rest of the veggies, seasonings, garlic, etc about 15-20 minutes before the potatoes were done.  The last couple of minutes I then broiled the veggies a bit to get some crispness and browning on them.  This is easier in the oven than on the grill but tastes about the same. We ate them right out of the oven and not at room temp. I didn't like them cold the next day but they were great reheated.

It took only 30 minutes in the oven.  Only took 20 minutes total for zucchini & asparagus.  I prefer turning heat down to 400 degrees so veggies don't get black on one side.  Otherwise, very tasty!

This turned out amazing! I didn't have a turnip, didn't sub, just increased my other veggies. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written, also roasted at 400 degrees as many users have. I'll be making this side dish again and again.

Made this for an Easter get-together.  The recipe was made exactly according to the recipe and came out perfectly.  It was good to be able to do this ahead and serve it room temp.  Everyone loved it, and I would do it again, using the same ingredients.

Wonderful. Our grocery store didn't have any fresh basil, so we bought the "fresh" basil in the tube and it was still delicious. Really yummy. Could really do with any veggies.

Ok, this must be a foolproof recipe, because I read it too quickly, and made several alterations without really meaning to. But-- it was delicious. Next time I will follow the instructions more closely and update my review. For now, I will write up exactly what I did in case I want to do it again :)... I used 1 large yam, 1 large white potato, 1 med parsnip, 1 c. baby carrots, 1 lg red onion, 1 small red bell pepper, 1 small orange bell pepper, 1 lg zucchini, 1 med yellow squash, with double the oil and seasonings since I had more veggies. I mixed the potatoes, parsnip, carrots, and onions in a big bowl with the amounts of oil, garlic, fresh basil, salt, and pepper called for. Baked on huge sheet pan at 425 for 30 min, stirring at about 10 min intervals. While those were baking, I cut up the squashes and bell peppers, and mixed with the amounts of oil, garlic, basil, salt, and pepper, letting them marinade while the root veggies cooked. After 30 min, I added squash/pepper mix, and stirred well. I turned the oven down to 400 and cooked 30 more min, stirring twice. We ate them hot and they were FABULOUS. What I will do differently next time, is cut the yams and parsnips into bigger chunks than the white potatoes, they were a little soft. Otherwise, I will try the recipe directions, where the seasoning is done at the end, and update my review with the comparison. I don't think you can mess up this recipe -- the flavors are wonderful, and I had never had parsnips, YUM, great.

I wasn't sure how this would turn out. I thought it might be dry but tossing the veggies together with the moist roasted bell peppers & oil @ garlic really made it taste delicious. The sweet potatoes were of course everyone's favorites so next time I might throw another one on. The color was really nice and added a bright happiness to our table. When I made this I doubled the garlic and halved the basil. It would be great either way though I bet.

We REALLY loved this recipe BUT... The temp was too high, without consistent turning of the veggies, they were scorched on one side, but I have done that a lot in the past so I knew after a while to check, and I was able to salvage most of them. The times were too long, at least for my oven. I think dropping the temp to 400 and the times down to 20 minutes each would be about right give or take a couple minutes. It really was fantastic otherwise, kids and husband loved it. I did not toss w/ sauce, had no basil, but it sounds like we really missed out by not having it so I WILL be using it tonight!!! Adding other veggies to it as well is a great idea. Thanks for sharing this recipe, great inspiration.

Ehhh..... It's really just to basic... plus the cook times were off for me.  Pan fry is still faster and easier to season.

this isn't much of a recipe as written; it's more of a technique explaining how to roast to a crisp vegetables. Changes I've made: I've lowered the temperature to 350F, as I agree with the other comment about it burning (why so hot??); cut the zucchini in half, as well as the one inch slices; after sprinkling the oil on the veggies, I tossed them in it, including the garlic. I've added herbes de provence instead of...well... nothing except for basil. You can also put in the roasted pepper for the last 10 min if you want to serve it as a warm side vegetable dish (which is basically how such a recipe is normally served, in my experience).

This was easy and really good. My veggies were overcooked though.  I used 400 instead of 425 and they were still mushy after an hour.  Next time will cut cooking time by at least 25% and should be awesome.

I really enjoyed all the favors.  I did use more olive oil than the recipe called for and it was perfect. I also had some pine nuts I threw in.  Perfect winter type veggie side dish.

Maybe I did something wrong or I just wasn't feeling the flavor of the roasted red peppers but I just didn't like the flavoring of this dish. I couldn't find parsnips at my food store so maybe that would have helped too, but the dish had an overpowering sense of roasted peppers in it, which made it feel more Mediterranean or Italian (and that was not what I was going for). We had a bunch of people over for dinner and this was the dish that was mostly left untouched. Which was fine because the other recipes I made were a hit from Allrecipes.

Really yummy way to eat your veggies!  I just used what I had on hand at the time, onion, green bell pepper, and carrots.  I am going to add some squash and potatoes and zucchini next time.

This was a great recipe and turned out perfectly. I have never made anything like this so I was a litle nervous. I didn't like adding yams, they were too sweet when mixed with the other vegetables and really threw my taste buds off (especially when sprinkled with salt and pepper), so next time I will use white potatoes instead.

Excellent - I used white potatoes, onions, carrots for the roasting - 30 min. at 400 - then stir for another 30 min- added garlic powder to the olive oil mix and used dried basil for roasting. Used jarred red pepper, more garlic and dried basil.  I don't like to change the original but this turned out great for what I had on hand.  Thanks much for the recipe

This was absolutely delicious.  Have used many roasted vegetable recipes but this is one of the best.  I used butternut squash instead of yam and had to use dried basil.  I added some fresh parsley and also used rutabaga and a turnip instead of the parsnip.  I needed to use up a bunch of vegetables and this was a great way to do it.  Excellent, looking forward to making again.

This tasted amazing!  I made it exactly as the recipe called for, except I used a normal red pepper instead of a pre-roasted one.  The parsnip (which I've never used before) was delightfully sweet and the entire mix of vegetables was well balanced between savory and sweet.  It was remarkably easy and I hope to make again and again.  My 3-year old also loved the mix.  The best part is you can MAKE THIS AHEAD OF TIME and it reheats well, making it a perfect dish for entertaining.

Conflicting info in this recipe. Cites in one place cooking time of 1 hour, in another 30 minutes. Over all, I have to agree that with the temp of 425 degrees, 30 minutes is way too long. At that, where did you have the rack in your oven positioned? High, middle, low.? This ALSO makes a difference in how well or how badly the food browns/burns.

I know that there will be variations due to different ovens having slightly different temperatures, but the times listed were way to long. I had to add the zucchini and asparagus after about 15/20 minutes rather than 30 minutes, and then it was done within another 10-15 minutes rather than 30.

I made it with 3 Yukon potatoes and 1 sweet potato instead of yams and it turned out extremely delicious. Time and temperature were the only adjustments. Bake the root vegetables (I also doubled the amount of carrots and parsnips) and potatoes at 400 for 25 minutes - turning every 10 minutes. Remove and let cool.  Next, about 20 minutes for the asparagus and zucchini. I also added more olive oil to the vegetables while cooking and turning. This was a huge hit first time.

This would have been wonderful if the heat and time were reduced. As I always try to do, I followed the recipe to the letter this (first) time. The vegetables came out black. I regret not following my instincts on the heat and time. Next time I will. This recipe error is so severe I believe it should be edited or removed

This was awesome! I think it was the first time my family had parsnips. I served it pretty warm though since it is freezing cold out.

Since the first time I made this dish, it has been a fan favorite.  It's such a great combination of sweet flavors with the perfect hint of savory and herbs.  Delicious and healthy.  Can't beat that.

I decided to roast my vegetables this way instead of throwing them in with the crockpot with my roast.  I intend to try this with the vegetables that are listed in the recipe,but I only had a  mixed variety of baby potatoes and carrots. I mixed the carrots and potatoes up with EVO, Hymlayian pink salt,fresh ground black pepper. I felt lazy so I only used 1/2 teaspoon of dried garlic powder and 1/4 teaspoon of dried rosemary,(  fresh would have taken this over the top!).Red onions would have been great to add, but I used 1 white onion with the crockpot roast. I  spread it out on a foil lined large cookie sheet. Cooked for 20 minutes on 425 then lowered it to 400 for 15 minutes turning the vegetables every 10 minutes. The vegetables came out so roasted sweet,tender and better then having mushy carrots and potatoes from a crockpot.  DH loved it and declared it went well with roast that we ate the following day for leftovers.

Roasted veggies are my favorite and the sprinkle of garlic and basil was great.  I used sweet potatoes, carrots, asparagus and zucchini.

Seriously delicious. I marinated the veggies in the olive oil, salt, pepper and added some Italian dried herbs and some red chillies flakes. Very tasty. The entire family, including young kids, loved it.

This was great and I loved the flavors and how they worked together. I did not have asparagus so I used 1 medium summer squash, which I added with the zucchini for the last 30 min. I also used 4 cloves of garlic. I will definitely make again!

I doubled the yams, zucchini, carrots, and red peppers, but used the same amount of basil, 3 cloves of garlic instead of 2, and the salt and pepper.  Delicious.  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and everybody loved it.

I made this for thanksgiving and it was delicious. This was so easy to serve because you make it ahead of time and serve it room temperature. The flavors blended together nicely. I think you could substitute any of the vegetables except the roasted red peppers which I doubled. (I used the whole jar including the liquid.)

This was delicious!  I did add a few additional veggies, but followed the rest of the recipe.  If you can fire roast your red peppers instead of jarred it really makes a difference.

I make roasted vegetables all the time.  I ask: Why use canned yams when fresh ones work just as well (or better)?  Canned veggies usually have too much salt.  I see no benefit to using canned veggies when fresh are so much better...

Great combination of veggies!  I brought this dish to a potluck and everyone gave it five stars! I did peel the zucchini because I think the skin can sometimes be bitter but otherwise I followed the recipe precisely.  Next time I might use more basil and roasted peppers because I love the way it tastes and more would only add to the great flavor of this recipe!

Turns out the yam I had here at the house wasn't any good.  Therefore. I substituted the little potatoes for the yam.  Also,  the grocery was out of parsnips.  I added a red bell pepper to the dish.  It turned out excellent.  I will definitely cook this again.

This was a great vegetable dish for Christmas dinner for a large group.  Visually, it looks great, and it tasted great.  Instead of the yam, I used a cubed butternut squash I had leftover in the freezer.  
    One added benefit this has for a holiday dinner or party is that it can be served at room temperature.  This allowed me to make this before the guests showed up, then freed up the oven and stovetop for heating appetizers and other items in the stove and oven before the dinner.  I thought it was strange to toss in raw minced garlic at the end, but it was fine, not overpowering.

I only used carrots, white potatoes, asparagus, zucchini, and roasted red pepper.  My husband doesn't do vegetables well but liked this.  I will probably change up some of the veggies in the future but it was really good.

I love this recipe because it is so versatile! A great idea and base for playing with according to what veggies you have on hand/what's in season, etc. I will definitely make this again. Great for an easy, yet healthy no fuss weekday side dish for dinner. I did the following differently according to what I already had, and loved the results: used a large glass baking dish brushed with grape seed oil (just enough to ensure it was spread over the whole dish, less than 1 Tbsp), baked chopped potatoes, onion and broccoli stems for the first 30 min; added zuccinni, broccoli florets and yellow beans drizzled with 1 Tbsp grape seed oil for the second 30 min of baking. After cooling, tossed with halved grape tomatoes, fresh basil, fresh purslane leaves, fresh garlic, cracked black pepper and 1/4 tsp sea salt. It was fresh, colourful and awesome!

I forgot to add the bell pepper, garlic and even seasonings though I still loved this blend! Ate it room temp, cold and warmed and found that room temp was better for personal taste. Also beware, I cut peeves smaller than 1 inch in thickness and suffered a bit of charing. Notice, it still commanded 5 stars!

This is the best use of mixed veggies and I agree with other reviewers that other veggies can be used with great success. The cooking time is a bit too long for me; they were softer than I would have liked. next time I'll cut down the time by a few minutes.

This was a easy recipe.I liked it a lot but I didn't care for the roasted pepper coating that much so I may change that up a bit. But my husband loved it so I'll make it again for sure.

Following experience of another reviewer I cooked in a pan on stove for 15 minutes (root veggies) and 10 minutes with everything. Roasted in over for another 15 minutes after on a pan with a bit of olive oil. Family loved it!

Very good mix of veggies. The roasted peppers are a nice touch. Mine took only about 1/2 the time to cook though and they got slightly blackened, which made them even yummier!

I didn't like the roasted peppers, although it may have been the kind I used. 
Everything else was delicious.

wow!  I didn't use parsnips and doubled the yams.   I agree that it should be 400 degrees.  I added garlic and salt to veggies before cooking. the basil is an amazing finishing touch. I made this to go along with "sage pork chops" and poured gravy over everything.  YUM!

My favorite veg was the carrots. They were so sweet and tender. Don't care for basil or garlic so I left them out - just good ole salt and pepper. They were wonderful. I wanted them all, but I graciously shared with my hubby.

We loved this recipe and we used Brussel sprouts instead of asparagus.  Turned out great as a side to roast beef

These roasted veggies are delicious. I found that they cooked much quicker than advertised (less than 15' for each round, and I think I would cook at a lower temperature next time), but maybe my chunks were smaller. Instead of drizzling olive oil, I mixed each set of veggies with the olive oil before spreading them out on the cookie sheet, which worked well. I served the veggies with simple olive oil and parmesan egg noodles, and I thought they went great together.

Be careful on the cooking time and temps. Know your oven.  Was in a rush, ate it warm, it was pretty good!  Need to try it with a fresh parsnip, the one I used didn't do anything for me!

Oven temperature too high.  Veggies start to burn.  Was really surprised to see that eating them at room temperature or cold was better than eating hot.

Overall nice taste - next time I'll do without the zucchini (too mushy) and will keep the asparagus whole, for better texture.

Pretty good. the timing was off on the vegs. They started to burn, but I caught it and also my oven runs different since it is gas, so might not be the recipe. I only used asparagus, sweet potatoes and zucchini, but was a new and different way to have them.
