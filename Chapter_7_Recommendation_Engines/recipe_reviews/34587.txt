This dressing was popular at a local lunch shoppe before it's closing. It basically used 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup honey, 1/4 cup white distilled vinegar, and 1 tablespoon poppy seeds. It is then blended in a blender to make creamy. Great over chef salad with shredded lettuce, shredded ham, turkey, finely shredded cheddar/monterey jack cheese and croutons.

For the oil, I substituted 1/4 oil and 1/4 cup sour cream (you can use mayonnaise too) for a creamy dressing. I made a salad with romaine lettuce, feta cheese and dried cranberries. Deeelicious...try it!!!!!!!

I decided at the last minute to have this dressing  on top of my fruit mixture of strawberries, melons and grapes this morning for brunch. So I had my son make the dressing while I was cooking. It turned out great (I just used 1/2 recipe for a large bowl of fruit), and was easy enough for my son to put together fast. It got several compliments (well a lot of compliments after my son kept saying "I made the dressing"). A keeper!

Absolutely delicious.  I didn't have any sesame seeds and I was serving it over my luau salad with spinach and fruit, so I added 1/2 tsp. each dried orange and lemon peel instead.  I chilled it for a couple hours so the orange and lemon would soften and blend in the flavor.

I made this with 1/4 c oil and 1/4 c sour cream...2 Tbsp of poppy seeds and no sesame seeds. The end result had harsh vinegar and sugar flavours....I added approx 1 tsp of each mustard and onion powder.(maybe more) I found that this really helped bring everything together. ( Kind of reminded me of the renees brand poppy seed dressing.)  I put it on spinach salad with hard boiled eggs, diced red onion, shredded mozarella cheese and raisins.

Update: I just thought I should write to say that my boyfriend loved this dressing..he liked it better than the kind we buy at the store.

It's okay.  A pretty generic oil & vinegar dressing.  Nothing to write home about, though.

I thought for sure it couldn't turn out like the reviewers said, but it was great!  Definitely a nice change of pace from the ordinary fruit salad.

I loved this dressing. I served it over a spinach salad with blueberries, strawberries and grapes. I bet it would be wonderful with any fruit, though.

Many of the poppy seed dressings I have made for my chicken pasta salad have been way to sweet, this one fit amazingly with the salad!! I plan on using it on more salad.  It was amazing!!

This is very easy and very good.  Kind of sweet for my taste and I'll cut the honey a little bit next time.  I put it on beef and spinach salad.

Excellent & easy.  Delicious.  I used a wand mixer & a little less than the amount of poppy seeds it called for.
