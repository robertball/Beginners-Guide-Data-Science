This was a great recipe. I made one change, i used butter instead of shortening. They turned out fine!  only "bad" thing i have to say is that the cookies only took 8.5 minutes. No where near the 10-14 they suggest! but everyone knows with cookies you have to watch the first batch to see how long it will take. Very good recipe indeed!

This is my favorite M&M cookie recipe.  The only change I make is to use butter instead of shortening.  They come out perfectly chewy and stay that way.

I used half shortening, half salted butter. I made no other changes. I actually baked mine at 350* for eleven minutes--the reason for the longer cooking time was because I really packed my small cookie scoop to make bigger sized cookies which meant they needed a touch longer bake time. They turned out soft, chewy and were loved by my husband and two kids. Next time, I will try this with Reese's pieces and maybe half peanut butter in place of some of the shortening.

As most chocolate cookies are, this is a slight variation of “Original NESTLÉ® TOLL HOUSE® Chocolate Chip Cookies.”   I like the use of shortening rather than all butter in this recipe for the sturdiness it imparts, but wanting the best of both worlds, I used half of each.  Going into this I knew this would be a moister, softer cookie, just by virtue of the fact that there is a higher ratio of brown sugar to white sugar.  Because I like my cookies crunchier, I knew this would not be MY favorite, but I know this texture appeals to most – and that’s what it delivered. These are indeed soft and tender, but chewy at the same time.   I had mini M & M’s in the pantry, so I correspondingly made the cookies smaller too.  As I do with all my cookies containing butter, I chilled the dough for about an hour before I baked them.   These cheery two-bite cuties will be well-liked at Hubs’ meeting tomorrow morning.

This is a great recipe!! It is very similar to my chocolate chip cookie recipe so, I decided to tweek it a bit.  Instead of the 1/2 cup of sugar, I used 1/4 cup of sugar and then added a 3.4 oz. box of instant vanilla pudding. This recipe is a keeper!!

These were very good.  I made them for a school Easter party and used easter colored candy.  My only problem with them was that by mixing the candy into the batter you couldn't see them as well.  Next time I would save some and put them on the top of the cookies just before baking so they look prettier.

I loved this recipe!  I am an avid cook w/four cookie cookbooks and found this one to be great!  I used chocolate chips and Reese's Pieces in it instead, since this is what I had on hand, and they came out soft, chewy and very yummy! Even my 5 year old loved them and he doesn't even like chocolate!  Thanks for sharing!

These were so easy and fun to make.  I didn't have enough shortening so I took the advice of a few below and used butter.  They look great and festive with the red and green m&m's.  One review said you couldn't see the candy so she will put on top instead of inside so my first batch didn't have enough.  I decided to to put all colors other than red and green in the mix and then place the red and green on top before baking and PERFECT!! I hope they taste as good as they look and smell.  The kids at the cookie exchange will be the judge of that.  Thanks for sharing!! M

Great cookies!!!! I used butter instead of shortening and a mix of semi-sweet and white chocolate chips. They were still moist and tasty a week after I made them! Also gave the recipe to my sister and she made them with dark chocolate chips and pecans. YUM!!!!!!!!

I don't usually change recipes, but I took some suggestions from other reviewers here:  I used half butter, half shortening in the recipe.   I used only 1 cup of the candies in the batter, and 1/2 a cup of semi-sweet chips, then sprinkled the extra candies on top before baking.  This was colorful and delicious when I used red and green candies at Christmas.  Loved these!

These were great!! The dough was perfect! I made them with 1 1/3 cups of pieces, and they had the perfect amount. If you put extra flour in them they will be really fluffy. This is a recipe I will make again.

My friend gave me this recipe and people always rave when I make them.  I have always used butter flavored Crisco.  I like to keep some of the M&Ms out of the batch to press them on top before baking for presentation.

Delicious! These cookies were great, they were crunchy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside, just how I like them!  The only thing that i changed was I used butter instead of shortening, came out wonderful! My whole family loved them and so did all my friends! Thanks for the recipe

This is a great recipe - I used mini peanut butter cups from Trader Joes (they're really mini- about the size of jumbo chocolate chips) and it worked great.  I did what others did and substituted two sticks of "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" instead of shortening and my cookies only need 8 minutes in the oven. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I had some Reeses pieces left over from Hallowe'en, so went looking for a cookie recipe to use them in. This is a great recipe -I made as directed, except I used butter-flavoured (golden) shortening, and substituted the peanut butter pieces for the chocolate pieces. The flavour of the cookies is reminiscant of one my best friend's mother made years ago - which made it even better! Thanks for the recipe Lyn.

This is a great recipe. Very easy to make. I used some leftover M & M's that I had from a Christmas party and made some great after Christmas treats for me and my son. I will definitely make these again.

I used all shortening--not necessarily bc I didn't want to use something else, but bc I inherited shortening.  Yes, really, bf brought it back from his grandmother's house, so I needed to do something with it.  I still have a lot, but it used up a good amount.  The cookies are pretty good, but they don't really spread and flatten with just shortening.  That's my only complaint.  They are very chocolatey--chocolate fans won't complain, I don't think--bc of the M&Ms.  Very easy, and bc I used my medium sized cookie scoop, these took 11 mins each.  Thanks for the recipe!

These baked up perfectly. They taste like store-bought cookies...which is what I was looking for. I used mini M&M's and they were a big hit with my family.

Not a fan ... taste was good, but they didn't cook well.  Either the center was undercooked or the whole thing was overcooked.  They flattened out completely.  I have been baking cookies for 20 years and usually don't have a problem. I couldn't get these to work, I tried chilling the dough, greased vs ungreased pans ... they just didn't cook up nice for me.

These cookie came out very well - followed some of the others advice. I let them rest in the refrigerator for 30 mins before I baked them. Also I mixed margarine and shortening, I will definitely make them again.

My ten year old son did most of the baking of these cookies. It was very easy and the cookies were delicious.

The M&M's give these cookies their distinctive taste.  I like the soda also.
