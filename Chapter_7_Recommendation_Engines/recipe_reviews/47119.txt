The cheesecake itself is wonderful -- almost the texture of banana pudding, with a thick, flavorful crust.  Maybe it's because the crust wasn't baked ahead of time, or maybe because I only used an 8x12 baking dish, but it came out very thick and with a great texture, unlike some crusts that fall apart when you serve them.  But the other reviewers are right, the caramel sauce is a flop, it's like water.  Next time I'll just use pre-made caramel topping, if anything.  BTW, don't forget to douse the banana slices in lemon juice or vitamin C before garnishing, so they don't turn brown.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a big hit! Everyone loved it!  Took the advice of different people here.  I doubled the amount of mashed bananas and I think it definitely gave the cake a better, stronger, more "banana" flavor.   I also "cheated" and just used a jar of caramel sauce from the store.  Shortly before serving, I decorated the top with the caramel sauce and sliced bananas around the rim.  This cake is so easy but tastes like you slaved over it for hours!   Will definitely be making this again!!

The cheesecake is very creamy! Not dry like some cheesecakes. Good Crust, just a hint of sweetness. Next time I'd make it 1 cup banana for more flavor.  Also, the caramels should be melted in a double broiler and add the evaporated milk slowly until it reaches the consistency desired.  Drizzle on cool cheesecake.  Cover to keep from drying out.  Family liked it and so did co-workers!  Thanks for sharing.

wow was this a great recipe, made it for my brother in laws birthday.  I did make some changes though,  I baked it in a 9 in. spring form pan and  I  increased the mashed bananas to a cup or 2 whole bananas.  I had to bake it for 45 minutes as well,  for the caramel sauce i cooked it in a double boiler and only put a little evaporated milk in it  i did not use the whole can.  I will definitely be making this again

I love this recipe! It's so easy to make. Instead of the vanilla, I added banana extract like another rater suggested. I've made it several times and took it to work and it never last. 
I use caramel sauce from the jar so I don't have a mess to clean up. It's a wonderful recipe and I'll make it again and again!

A pretty good cheesecake. Instead of adding more mashed bananas, to heighten the banana flavor add a little banana liqueur (banana schnapps, creme de bananes)or even banana extract.

My family & I loved this uniquely flavored cheesecake.  My only problem with it was that the sauce came out very milky, even after refrigeration.  I would probably try halving the amount of evaporated milk next time - it's far too much sauce anyhow.  The cheesecake was excellent without it also.

Something was amiss for me with this recipe and I can't really put my finger on it.  I think it was the overpowering banana flavor combined with the cheese.  It's just a really rich desert that I wish had more caramel flavor throughout instead of just on top.  Note to people trying this: make the caramel sauce on the side and dress each slice instead of covering the whole thing like I did.  The sauce becomes strange and watery/milky in the fridge.

Love this recipe! Its my go to. Now I must say Im a terrible cook and sometimes can't be bothered with reading directions correctly. Due to that part of my charm I added the evap milk into the cheesecake mixture on accident. The result was TWO absolutely delicious, moist cheesecakes! I now make that mistake every time!

YUMMY!.I printed this out, and gave to hubby.When I got home from work, he had made it on the campfire. BUT!. I only used 2 or 3 Tablespoons evaporated milk, then dirzzled hot fudge over that. It was wonderful, and our guests for the campfire dinner loved it. We will make this again.and again..and AGAIN!

I adjusted this just a bit by making a choc cookie crust instead which complimented the banana flavor. I added 2 cups of bananas also. Everyone loved it!

I made this cheese cake for church Sunday.  Got great reviews!  Husband even said that it was good (also could tell the way he was eating his 2 pieces and scraping the plate for crumbs) and not too sweet.  I added more bananas though, had about 2 cups of mashed banana; used banana extract instead of vanilla extract and added about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar with the white sugar.  Also used jarred caramel sauce, very sparingly by sticking a fork in the caramel jar and then drizzling it over the cake using the prong ends of a fork; and layed on top of cake 1 cup of toasted almonds for good measure.  Again got great feedback.. Definitely will be making this again, Lord's willing.

Baking for 30 min in not enough time at all! Not sure how these others did it but mine was so runny. the cooked part was good, remined me of banana bread w/ cream cheese frosting. Not as good as it sounded or looked.

This banana cheesecake is delicious as is and everyone at my work and home loves it.  But I added a few things this last time and I also made mini cheesecakes instead of a whole, big one.  I made the crust with chocolate graham crackers with a little less sugar (or you can use regular graham crackers and add cocoa power and some extra sugar).  Then, I drizzled "Mrs. Richardson's" butterscotch caramel over it after it was done cooking.  After the caramel I melted some bittersweet chocolate and drizzled it.  Then for a little tartness, I put a dollop of whipped cream on the mini cheesecakes with a fourth of strawberry on top.  Again, This recipe is delicious as is, but if you thought it was a little too sweet and looooove chocolate, the chocolate graham crackers and bittersweet drizzle are really amazing paired with the banana cheesecake.

Mine was way too runny. Every other cheesecake I have made required a lower oven setting around 325 and longer baking time. The next time I make this I will bake for at least an hour at 325. Otherwise the flavor was good, I substituted 1 tsp of banana extract for the vanilla and added another 1/2 c. of mashed bananas.

I've made this twice now. I read all the reviews and tweaked the recipe to fit what I wanted. Most reviews said not enough banana flavor so I doubled the banana to 1 cup (2 average size bananas) and added 1 tsp or so of a banana flavored liqueur I had purchased in Aruba when I was there last. As for the crust, I used 1/2 cup butter (1 stick) so it wasn't so crumbly. The first time I made it I went with the homemade caramel sauce. If you go that route then it's a 5 oz can of evaporated milk, NOT 12 oz!!! And use a double boiler so you don't overcook and burn the caramel. I will this time however use Mrs Richardsons caramel/butterscotch as I know and love that stuff. And it's WAYYY easier. I also cooked the cheesecake for 45 minutes at the same temp and in a glass pan. It's very thick and rich but everyone loves it! I asked for comments from friends and family so I could make it better the 2nd time around and they all said to keep it the same and not to change a thing. And believe me when I tell you that they WOULD tell me the truth! :) Enjoy!!!

We loved the cake!

I messed up the caramel sauce (I think I used the wrong kind of caramel candies).  But the flavor and consistency of the cake was yummy!  

PS I decided to change the graham to vanilla wafers, and I used a stick of butter instead of the recipes 1/3c.

Crust was crumbly and did not form at all.  "Sauce" was not a sauce at all, it was like caramel flavored milk.

The secret to the caramel sauce:

I have made caramel sauce like this more times than I can count, but the secret is to only use one SMALL can (5 ounces) of evaporated milk rather than a large 12 ounce can.  5 ounces of milk will make the perfect caramel sauce without having to cook the sauce forever to thicken it up.

Tasted like regular cheesecake. The sauce has a milky consistency, but was good. I used a 10" springform pan, followed the recipes baking instructions, then lowered the oven to 200 and baked for an additional 45 minutes. Overall a great base recipe.

I made this cheese cake several times and it was a real hit at all parties. One minor change I made: I used 2 medium sized bananas and added a tiny bit of banana extract (like 1ml). For the caramel sauce, an easier way to do it is just to microwave a few caramel candies with a bit of condensed mike. Microwave until all melted and stir to smooth. Then pour onto the cake. It's perfect.

I made this for a special occasion and it was a hit!  I used some suggestions from other reviewers and doubled the mashed banana and used caramel topping in the jar.  I also baked in a 9-inch springform pan, topped with whipped cream and banana slices which made a nice presentation.

It makes a lot of cheesecake, but good cheesecake. I used two premade crusts, and I also used premade caramel sauce, which really cut down on the time, but didn't sacrifice flavor.I really enjoyed this!

Wow I cooked this cheesecake for Christmas and it was GONE! Everyone loved it including me and I'm pretty picky with my desserts. I will be making this again really soon. I make it in a disposable Christmas foil baking pan and it mmm mmm good. Thank you for the recipe.

Turned out great! Nice blend of sweet banana and tangy cheesecake taste. Rich, delicious, and easy.

I mostly followed the recipe, but I used two overripe, frozen-then-thawed bananas, which gave it plenty of banana flavor, and neufchatel instead of cream cheese. Also, cause I had some ginger snaps laying around, I used 1 c of ginger snap crumbs and 1 c of vanilla wafer crumbs for the crust, with about 1 Tbsp of brown sugar. And preferring the traditional pie shape, I baked it in two 9" pie pans (for 40 minutes). The crust was good but maybe not for the cheesecake purists out there. I skipped the caramel sauce, but it was good with some Hershey's syrup drizzled on it.

I doubled the banana as others suggested and then I skipped the caramel sauce and turned it into a banana split cheesecake (using traditional banana split toppings).  It was very good!

I made this for a family gathering of 10 people. I thought the banana flavor may be compromised by the caramel so I just used Whipped cream. Tasted like HEAVEN! Next time I have a large group over I will make it again for sure! simply lovely.

This was very good. I used a different crust and a different caramel topping, so the only part I truly kept the same was the most important bit--the cheesecake part :) And it was great as written.

Fabulous!  I made it with 3/4 cup mashed banana, 1/2 tsp banana extract and a chocolate cookie crumb crust instead of graham.  I garnished with walnuts, chocolate shavings, and caramel using the caramel recipe "chewy caramel" from this site.  It's a huge hit!  Thanks!

This recipe yielded a nice light and fluffy cheesecake.  My only reservation about giving it 5 stars is the caramel sauce, we didn't really care for it and it made way too much.  It was more like caramel milk, I guess I was hoping for something thicker.  The cheesecake was fabulous though!

I am so glad that I logged on to AllRecipes and looked up cheesecakes. I didn't realize they were so easy to make. My only suggestion for this recipe is if you want a stronger banana flavor then double the banana serving.

excellent recipe!  I tried this recipe this evening and it was delightful!   I added a full cup of bananas for a definite banana taste.  It turned out great.  I skimped by using the prepared caramel instead. This recipe is A+++!

Terrific cheesecake. Everyone loved it. The only thing I would maybe do differently is decrease the sugar a bit. It was a bit too sweet for me, but had terrific banana flavour.

This recipe was very easy and the results were delicious. My husband loves bananas and this combined two of his favorite things! I was wary of the carmel sauce, but it worked out fine. I might add a little more caramel next time to thicken it, but overall an excellent easy dessert. It would be great for company.

I made it in an 8” springform pan instead of the suggested pan - cook time was changed to about 45 minutes to accommodate for the thickness of the cheesecake. It came out perfectly - moist, delicious, and a crowd pleaser!

An amazing and super easy recipe!  I made this with a graham cracker and pecan crust and then also added an extra 1/2 tsp of banana extract along with the called for vanilla extract for an added banana flavor.  The entire family loved it!  Next time I will mash the banana but that is just a personal preference.  THANK YOU for this recipe!

This was my first cheesecake and aside from the slightly browned top it tasted delicious. I made some peanut butter syrup to cover the the top with some banana puree. It complemented the dessert quite well.

This recipe is a keeper. The finished product was incredibly creamy and delicious. I did adapt the recipe. I used 2.5 bananas instead of 1 and added a 1/4 cup coconut milk. I also baked it in a water bath for 45 minutes and then let it cool in the oven. I opted for pre made caramel sauce but feel that a dark chocolate sauce would have been even better although the caramel sauce was very good. I also think that a bit of cinnamon in the crust would be great.

This recipe was amazing. I doubled the recipe and brought it to a big family dinner and everyone loved it up. I increased the amount of banana in the recipe though to get a better more strong banana taste. Spring forms pans rock with this recipe

The recipe for the cheesecake is wonderful. There is no need for 14oz of evaporated milk, it's just too much sauce. I recommend melting the caramels and adding some of the milk to get the desired toffee like drizzle. Mine ended up too runny and wouldn't set.

Excellent and very beautiful. I was not feeling well, so I really took the liberty to make two major changes. First, I used an already made graham cracker pie crust. I lowered the temperature to 325 degrees and did cook it much longer about 45 minutes...until it rose up completely and was slightly browned. Center needs to be stable.
The second thing I changed was to use the bottled Caramel Sauce. 
So basically all I did was to make the main ingredients of the cheesecake, itself.
You have to cut the first piece and it will mess up because the crust will be harder to get out but it still taste good. Once you get one piece out and it has refrigerated overnight, then the rest is easy.
Everyone loved it and I would do it that way again but most likely the original recipe is even better, although, I don't seen how it could taste much better than what I did.

As other reviewers have stated, I used a little more than 1 cup of mashed bananas for more flavor, and I used store naught caramel sauce.  It was delicious...I will definitely continue making this recipe for years to come!

Just made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday and it was amazing.  I used Nilla Wafers instead of the graham crackers for the crust and doubled the bananas.  Cook time was upped to about 45 minutes since it was still very runny.  Boyfriend isn't a big caramel fan so changed the sauce out for some whipped cream and it was wonderful.  Think next time though I'll try using less sugar in the cream cheese mixture.

I made this recipe for my husband, and we ended up taking it to a get together, it was a big hit with everyone! Very creamy and delicious. The only change in the recipe I made was that I made a different recipe for caramel sauce. It uses brown sugar, butter, evaporated milk and vanilla extract. Only because I didn't have wrapped caramels on hand. All in all a delicious recipe!

This is SUPER easy to make.  Instead of caramels, I boiled a can of sweetened condensed milk for 3 hours and spread the caramel on the cookie crust.  For the filling, I omitted the bananas since mine weren't quite ripe enough and cut the eggs down to 2, adding 2 T all purpose flour and 1 tsp baking powder for texture.  Poured it over the caramel, baked until the center was set.  Turned out PERFECTLY.

The only thing good about this cheesecake is that it was slick to cook it in a 9x13. I couldn't get over the consistency. Ugh. I increased the banana to 3/4 cup and it was too much banana for us. I added 2 tsp lemon juice to try and give more cheesecake tang. Everyone who ate it rated it a "two" and I think they were just being nice.

Best cheesecake I've ever made. This recipe is perfect as is although because I'm a freak and don't care for graham cracker crust, I had to sub that but it came out wonderfully for my first time ever making cheesecake and make I love those bananas! Thank you for sharing!

I made this for my husband to take to work and it was a hit! I used store-bought graham cracker crust and ready made caramel from a jar. I also used non-fat cream cheese and splenda and non fat evap milk and it still tasted awesome! I used pecans as toppings drizzled with caramel sauce.  I am going to make this again for a party tomorrow and my husband wants me to use macadamia  nuts instead of pecans as toppings!

this is absolutely amazing! My boyfriend LOVES bananas, and I have made this a few times for family gatherings. It's always a hit.

Very good.  Used jar caramel sauce to save time. Next time I will try chocolate graham cracker crust on the bottom! I like the fact that you don't need a spring form pan to make this.

Well,  I made this for Easter and everyone just could not stop talking about it. It was AMAZING!!!!!!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. I used Werther's caramels which was soooo good and made some extra caramel sauce for those who wanted to add some more. It was the hit of the day and for sure will become a family favourite on special occasions.

The texture was PERFECT.  I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust, and added dark chocolate pieces and walnuts and omitted the caramel sauce (but it would have been fantastic with it as well).  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a potluck at work and it was a huge hit!  The only changes I made were to increase the amount of mashed banana, and I did use a jar of caramel sauce to save time.  This is one of the quickest and easiest cheesecake recipes I have ever made.  AWESOME!

I changed this a little.  Shortbread cookies, no sugar for the crust. Vanilla wafers would probably be delicious. The cake recipe stayed the same except I baked mine in a 9 inch springform pan for abour 45-50 minutes.  Also cheated on the sauce with ice cream caramel topping.

I used double banana's and 1/4 tsp of banana extract like others suggested and the banana flavor was very strong.  Maybe use one of the suggestions but not both.  I might try this again because even though the taste was overpowering, it was still good.

This was okay. It was easy to make and looked nice.  My family said it was "good", I thought it was rather bland even with using more bananas.

got lots of compliments- great recipe... I used 1 cup banana, and warmed up some caramel sauce from the store and sprinkled chopped walnuts on the top.. tasted a lot like banana nut bread.

it was my husbands birthday and hes really not a sweets kind of guy,but he does like cheesecake.so instead of getting a fancy cake i baked him this cheesecake.i felt really good when he ate himself silly and actually got a stomach ache.but i do have to say i went the easy way and bought caramel already made like for sunday toppings,theres actually one that hardens when its cold,so after i cooled it for three hours i placed the cake in the refrigerator for 10 min and it harden so well it looked store bought. in closing when i make it again i might double up the recipe so it will be a little taller.
