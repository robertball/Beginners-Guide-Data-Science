The first time I made this chowder I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time I made it, I made some changes which I think really improved the final results.  

I eliminated the water.  I didn't see the need for it.  I also eliminated the oregano. I think that was my biggest complaint with the recipe as is - for me the taste was overpowering.  To add some flavor, I added chicken bullion, white pepper, parsley and onion powder.  Lastly, I waited until the final step to add the chicken.  Made as is – the chicken cooks too long – the end result is dried out or rubbery chicken.  

A tip for new cooks: Before transferring the flour/vegetable mix to the rice mixture stir about ¼ to ½ cup of chicken broth into the flour/veg mixture.  This helps to eliminate lumps in your final product.

I made this last night and my hubby & I loved it! I used 2 cans of broth and brown rice, left out the water, added butter to the olive oil when cooking the veggies (used portobellas and put in extra because I love them)and then deglazed the pan with a little red wine and added that to the pot.  I also used half & half and another 2/3 cup of 1% milk plus a little nutmeg at the end. I did add salt & pepper to taste as I was cooking.  I almost always add more spices to any recipe I make but I think the recipe as it stands is a great one. I will definatley make this again and again!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I've made it several times and always get rave reviews.  It's definitely great comfort food.  If I want to thicken it up, I add a can of Cream of Mushroom and it's wonderful.  I find it easiest to put a couple chicken breasts in a slow cook all day with salt, pepper, and garlic salt.  When I come home, I shred up the chicken (it's like butter by then) and use it for my soup.  If I have too much chickent left over, I use it the next for soft chicken tacos or a BBQ chicken sandwich.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I made this as is yesterday for the first time.  I loved it.  It was nice, thick, and hearty.  My wife wants me to add green vegetables the next time I make it, but she took the leftovers to work today so she must have loved it too. To anyone I suggest following the recipe for your first batch, then tweek it if you want, but the original recipe is great.

This was delicious- like a chicken stew. Seemed really thin at first but then the rice puffed up and the whole thing thickened.  Added some leftover peas- could add anything you like! Might try some different/more seasoning next time. And there will be a next time!

My husband and I thought this was too bland also.  I will try one more time with this recipe before tossing.  Would add more pepper and a bouillion cube and 3/4 cup of frozen peas with the milk.

I actually would give this 4 1/2 stars but since they don't have that option I will go with 4.  My husband loved this recipe I made mine a bit larger by adding more broth and rice and since I had a can of evaporated milk on hand that was opened I used that instead of the milk.

I made it with leftover Thanksgiving turkey instead of chicken, and I could not stop eating it.

This was certainly a good and acceptable chowder but it just didn't have that distinction that makes it outstanding, even after some tinkering which I know only made it better.  I didn't use any water and wondered why the recipe would call for it. The oregano not only seemed excessive, but I felt would make for a one-dimensional tasting soup, so I substituted a good Tuscan seasoning blend instead. To add even more flavor, color and texture I added chopped celery and chopped red bell pepper to the vegetables.  While I acknowledge this is a chowder, which implies it will be thick, it still was TOO thick and needed additional chicken broth.  I'm thinking the flour was unnecessary in the first place!  Also, since the chicken is already cooked I added it at the end rather than cook it any further. It was an okay soup/chowder, but even with additional seasoning including salt and pepper, extra garlic, no water and a wider variety of vegetables  it still seemed to lack depth and complexity.  I'm thinking that even a bit of dry white wine or sherry might make a big difference, though I also believe the chowder should stand on its own without it.

I made this recipe as written, and we thought it was delicious! My 20 month old son LOVED it, he's not a vegetable eater, but he ate this right up, veggies and all. We didn't think this was bland at all, I'm not sure why people thought that. If you add the amount of oregano and pepper to the chicken that it called for then it tasted great. Thanks for posting this recipe, Joanie!

Just made this and am having a warm bowl right now...it is delish!  Made the following changes based on previous reviews:  Cooked chicken breasts in slow cooker with 1/2c water, seasoning salt and pepper on low for 4 hours then could still cube the meat as opposed to it shredding.  Used all chicken broth, no water.  Cut oregano to 1/2tsp.  Sauteed veggies in butter and olive oil.  Threw in a handful of frozen corn at the end as I like my chowders with corn for that little sweetness.  Could still use a little salt, but that is easily added at the table.  Very easy to make, great creamy consistency and so good!  Will definitely make again.

The only thing I added to this was some salt.  Other than that, I made it exactly the way it stated.  I don't know why people found this bland.  There's nothing bland about it (unless you're into really spicey foods).  I made this for a dinner at work (I'm a shift worker).  I made it the night before for the next night's work.  I teased myself with a taste of it.  I wanted more but had to hold back! lol  The recipe is great just the way it is.

This recipe is amazing!  I took it to my sister's house for lunch, and 6 people ate a double batch.  I doubled the recipe almost exactly, and I added a can of cream of mush. soup.  To cook the chicken, I put 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts in a crock pot with 1/2 c. water,1/2 tsp. garlic salt, & 1/2 tsp. pepper.  I cooked the chicken over night (about 8 hours) on low.  The chicken was extremely moist and just fell apart.

This is a good, filling soup.  I made no changes except to add one can of cream of mushroom soup to make this a little thicker.  It was delicious.

My family loved this.  Thick and filling.  The oregano is a bit strong though.  Next time I'll omit that, add more salt and DOUBLE THE RECIPE, as we all wanted MORE.

Made this the first time exactly as directed & really liked it, but thought suggestions from some others sounded good, so I cut back on the oregano to 1/2 t. and added cream of chicken soup. It was to die for. I'm making it tomorrow & will double the recipe.

This is really delicious. It's not a very "seasoned" soup, and the chicken and mushrooms are definitely the stars of the show. I cubed the raw chicken and added it to the soup so it would cook in the broth. The texture of the soup was *perfect.* I thought there was way too much garlic and next time I'll only use one clove. I topped my bowl of soup with parmesan cheese and it was lovely lovely lovely.

Very good and fairly easy.  I didn't use the full amount of oregano.  With the "healthy" chicken broth I used, a little salt could be added.  We added peas too.  I was in a hurry, so I sauteed my chicken with the garlic, onion, and mushrooms; then added the broth, etc.  Worked fine.  Very filling.  I've put this one in my recipe box!

This was a pretty average tasting soup.  I needed about double the chicken broth even though I cooked the soup covered.  After adding 1 tsp. oregano, I tasted the soup and felt that was plenty of oregano...maybe too much.  I added a little basil, rosemary, and parsley to get a better blend of flavors, but never got it exactly right.  I altered the preparation directions: after adding the flour to the vegetables, I stirred in 2 T. Sherry and the 1 c. milk, stirred until the mixture was thick and bubbly, then added it to the broth/rice mixture.  I added the cooked chicken near the end to avoid overcooking...there is no need to add it in step 1 before the rice even cooks.

I made this w/leftover turkey, barley and added a few stalks of celery.  Omitted rice, water, and used 1/2 the amt of oregano.  Came out great!

This was really good. I didn't give it a five because it wasn't to die for, and needed some extra spice to it. I doubled the amount of rice, and used less dried oregano as suggested. Next time I will omit the carrots, and add some corn. With the remaining leftovers,  i warmed it up with a can of chicken broth and made chicken mushroom chowder soup.  Very good. Thanks for sharing.

This dish is so comforting. I omit the carrots, the oregano, and water, and I also add the chicken in at the end. First I boil water with powdered chicken broth. Then I start the veggies just as the recipe says but without carrots. After putting the flour in, I add some of the boiling broth, about 1/2 a cup to the veggie mix to make sure there are no clumps. Then I add the veggies, seasoned chicken, and rice into the boiling broth. When it starts to boil again, I add the milk and any additional seasonings. Usually when making this dish, I serve it along with baked chicken. While baking the chicken I reserve about a 1/2 cup of the chicken juices for the chowder. After adding the milk, add the juices. I makes such a difference! Also, if I'm in the mood, I take a hot pepper, poke tiny holes in it, and I put in the chowder to boil . At the end I remove it, and the final dish is so yummy! My family absolutely loves it, and its perfect for a cold winter night! Tip: if you find the chowder is thickening to much at the end and too quickly, just keep adding in small amounts of milk until the rice is fully cooked. Season with black pepper and salt if needed.

not sure what, but this recipe was missing something.  possibly could have benefitted from making a white sauce with butter as the base, definitely needs some salt also!  this one won't be going into the books!

I agree with other reviewers who think that the oregano is overpowering. If I make this again I will leave it out completley.

I made this meal tonight and followed it to the "T" as far as seasonings go.  I didn't add carrots but added corn instead.  I can see why some people thought this was a little bland because the broth/liquid didn't have much flavor.  I tasted the oregano and that was nice but I felt it just needed a little more "umph" to it.  I did have to add salt.  I would possibly make this again but with my own twist to make a little richer flavor.  I bought a pre-roasted chicken at the store and pulled the meat off that to add in, just as a time-saver.  I added it during the last 15 minutes of cooking because chicken tends to shred when cooked too long in a broth like this.  Overall, not bad.  It's worth making again with a few added touches of my own.  :)

Very good!  I had to add about an extra cup of liquid, and I still thought it was pretty thick.  Good, but I was just expecting something a little more soup-like.  I don't know why, the title clearly says "chowder"!  Anyway, it was delicious and I'll certainly make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Kind of bland. I added frozen peas with the milk for a bit of color; would have been way too boring without. Might try again with more varieties of mushrooms and more black pepper.

Both my husband and I really liked this recipe.  I did make some changes:  turkey instead of chicken, 3 1/2 cups of chicken broth instead of 3, a half bag of frozen veggies, and added a can of campbell's chedder cheese soup.  This tasted like a homemade pot pie without the crust, but could used as the filling for a pot pie.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe!  Preparation of the vegetables does take a little 
time, but a food processor helps with that.  I used prepared broth (Campbells), 
so I don't need to add any additional salt.  While I prepare the veggies, I cook 
the chicken breasts in the microwave, and cook the small amount of rice on the 
stove.  By the time they're ready, I'm finished with the veggies - all in all, it was 
ready to eat in under an hour.  I think next time I'll try it with Portabello 
mushrooms and a whole head of roasted garlic. YUMMY!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  The only thing I need to change in my own preparation is that I need to add a bit more salt... I used homemade chicken browth, and I'm sure that canned browth has plenty of salt already.  My husband can be hard to please, and this one is definitely a keeper!

Great comfort food.  I make some minor adjustments. I substitute the water with more chicken broth and only use 1 teaspoons of oregano.  I also throw in whatever I have handy: garlic powder, onion powder, poultry seasoning, parsely flakes, etc. And since the chicken is already cooked, I don't put it in until the very end.  Awesome on a cold evening.

The is a nice and easy meal, although I found it rather bland. I added a red pepper, celery, a splash of white wine, more salt and pepper and a little seasoning blend, and it still was missing something--maybe Cayenne?  My husband liked it though and he usually goes for big flavor, and it definitely looked yummy to serve, so I gave it four stars instead of three.

My family really enjoyed this meal, and I am already looking forward to making it again.  The only changes I made were reducing the mushrooms to half pound, increasing the rice to 2 cups, adding half a bag of frozen peas and substituting almond milk for regular milk.  It was creamy and delicious and reminded me of chicken pot pie without the crust!!  The only change I would make next time would be to increase the carrots to 2 or 3.  1 just didn't seem like enough.

Very good recipe. Make sure you like garlic before adding this amount. You may wish to cut down a bit. I used leftover Popeye's spicy chicken and put it over mashed potatoes and then over rice. Good both ways, but better over rice. I was given the spicy by mistake and my wife doesn't like that much spice. This was a great way to tone the spice down. I did put in some of the skin to keep some of the spice and it was very good. I also went with more mushrooms, 16 oz. Just my personal taste. Thanks Joanie!

This was just OK for me.  I cut down on the oregano because it sounded like too much and I don't love it.  It tastes like chicken pot pie middle and is pretty good.  It could use more rice to make it heartier.

Um ... this soup did not have the richness that is inherent to a true chowder.  It was also kind of bland and visually unappealing.  I found the flavors to be only so-so.  Unfortunately, I won't be making this dish again.

I think we would have given this 2.5 stars, but since it was SO bland, we rounded down.  We took the advice of some of the others and didn't add any water (why would you?) and added some butter with the oil.  Add four good-sized ribs of celery to the carrots and onions and 1.5 teaspoons each of thyme and sage.  Add more salt/pepper to taste.  Using cream of chicken (or mushroom) may be better than using milk - we'll know next time.

A great dish that can be seasoned many ways to your taste. It's great if you have left over chicken and rice which I did,much quicker to make.I also sauted celery with the onions,carrots,garlic and mushrooms.Did extra mushrooms,we love them.Did not use the water. My husband and I love curry ,it was great.Next time I think i will try cumin.Thanks for a great recipe that can be seasoned many ways.

Very good!  Pretty much followed to a "t" except left out 1/2 C water and went lighter on oregano like other reviewers.  Put in slow cooker like one reviewer did (with whole, frozen chicken breast).. Put mushrooms and milk in 1hr before serving and the mushroom had softened slightly but gave it an added texture that was nice (instead of super soft like in an overcooked soup). Husband loved it, and he's very hard to please.  He even said he'd love to have this again, which is a very rare occurrence indeed.

Very good recipe.Just changed a couple of things. For all of the liquids used all chicken broth.Used white rice instead of long grain rice.Both ways are good.Added a cup of frozen vegetables to it.And when its done we have put it over Biscuits or mash potatoes. Works for us. Thanks.

In my hazy sick state I added double the oregano, WOW way to powerful. But I fixed it by adding cream of celery soup and another cup of milk. My husband was shocked at how good my mistake turned out!!!

This was pretty awesome.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, using skim milk and maybe a little extra pepper.  Turned out great!  My honey claims to hate oregano and he loved this.  Yes, it is pretty simple, but that's what comfort food should be.  It was great, but not 5-stars - it could definitely use something extra to give it that boost, but I haven't figured out what that "extra" should be yet. Great recipe, though - thanks!

I made this recipe tonight!  I pretty much alway change things based on what I have on hand.  I skipped the carrots (didn't have any) and added more mushrooms, but chopped vs. sliced.  I added 1 c. beef broth because I already had one open.  Seemed like most found the original bland, so I added about 3 chicken and 1 beef bouillon cubs.  It really made the broth more flavorful.  I also didn't have any rice, so I added egg noodles instead.  We really love mushrooms, so thanks for sharing!

This soup tasted pretty good.  I decreased the oregano to 1 tsp. and tripled the garlic.  I increased the rice to 3/4 cup and ended up having to put more water in the soup because it was too thick.

Possible one of the best soups ever!  I used 1 cup of rice instead of 1/2, and made it in my rice cooker.  I added it just before serving, so it didn't get mushy.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Delicious!  I just got done eating and eating and eating and eating this soup.  It is sooo good.  It is delicious and healthy as the recipe is listed, but add a dollop of sour cream on top and a few shakes of tabasco and it is sinfully good.  Next time I make this I may use wild rice or barley.  I also added 1Tbls of cornstarch with a little milk at the end to thicken it up.  A very simple, super fast recipe with an all day simmer taste.

I'm not sure why but I decided to take a reviewer's suggestion and slow cook the chicken.  I didn't like the meat shredded.  Also, I would have preferred the carrots sliced rather than chopped.  The sauteed fresh mushrooms MAKE this dish.  The flavor was wonderful, and I used fat-free broth and 1% milk.  Make again?  Maybe.

Excellent recipe. First time, I made it as the
recipe said. Second time, I used button portabellas,
added lemon pepper at the end, added extra carrots
and onions to broth. It was just as good as the first time I made it. Thanks, Joanie.

Very good.  I did have to increase the chicken broth and the milk.  I didn't add the milk until the end because I tend to walk away while things are simmering.  I also adjusted the salt and pepper to our tastes.  I will make again.  Totally comfort food.

This was a good recipe, and it's great to have a chicken soup that is a little different.  We enjoyed it, but I think it could stand a good couple of tablespoons of parsley while it's cooking.  I did add some at the end, just before serving.  It also needs salt.  I had to add about another 1/2 cup of stock at the end, because it was just a little too thick, even for chowder consistency.  Also, I covered the pot while it was cooking for the 30 minutes, as I think it's best to cook any soup while it cooks so that the liquid doesn't simmer away.

This is a really good basic recipe, but I couldn't help making some changes the second time around. I sprinkled a little salt, pepper, and oregano on the chicken pieces, then sauteed in 2 tbsp of butter. I also added diced potato and celery. Wasn't bad lol.

This is truly a thick and delicious chowder. I did use the flour, as I consider this the reliable way to thicken chowders. And, as per other reviewers, be sure to stir about 1/2 cup of the stock (I always use stock, never broth) into the vegetable/flour mixture BEFORE returning it all into the stock. This will insure no lumps in your finished product. One other tip: you do not need cooked chicken to start with; simply cut up raw chicken breasts into bite-size chunks and cook them in the simmering broth for 20 minutes, prior to starting the recipe. Then you will proceed as directed.

This was so good!!  The only change I made was that I added an extra carrot.  I will probably use 3 carrots the next time I make it.  The carrots give it color and a little extra flavor.  This is great served with salad and biscuits.

My girlfriend and I made this last night and have added it to our regular menu of dishes we cook.  I agreed a little with the user that mentioned there was too much oregano... might drop it down next time to about 3/4tsp.  We also added a few extra spices to kick it up a notch (some Greek Seasoning, couple small dashes of Curry, etc.).  We also did 3/4 cup of rice instead of 1/2 to make it a little less of a soup and more of a casserole.  Glad we did.  It was perfect.  I can definitely see how Peas would work really well in this, but it is far from needed.  Enjoy!

I prepared this recipe as written and it ended up pasty and bland.  I added parsley, garlic salt, white pepper, at least double the original black pepper, frozen corn and a significant amount of extra milk (hoping to help out with the pastiness).  With all of the extra seasonings I added it was still quite bland.    As a starter I may use this again, but as a finished chowder I will not.

Because everyone suggested more spices, I added some, but added too much white pepper which overpowered the taste. Other than that mistake, I think it is a great, quick tasty chowder and plan to make it again.

It was a good recipe but as written it lacked spice...I used low sodium broth and that may have been the problem but based on what other reviewers said, I added 1 Tbsp sour cream, parsley and 1 tsp Lawry's Seasoned salt and found it still was a little bland.

I really loved this soup and it was so easy.  The only changes I made was I used canned milk instead of half n half and I added cream cheese

I made this today and changed it up a bit. Left out the carrots, added spinach. Used chicken stock and half & half and then added about a 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar at the end. The pepper and oregano were wonderful with this chowder!

Made this last night after reading all the reviews.  My husband called it "hot icecream"!  Was absolutely delicious!  Followed reviewers suggestions by replacing the oregano w/tarragon.  Also used half & half & heavy cream in place of milk.  Also used all broth instead of water, and ended up adding about one cup more.  Used more salt & pepper than recipe called for but did it all by taste - that's pretty much how I cook!  WE LOVED THIS!!

Good/not great. The only thing I changed was I used half the oregano. 1.5 tsp for a small-ish amount of soup sounded a bit potent. I liked it with that amount....probably would have found the amount called for too overpowering. This was too thick for me....just heavy, not chowderish

I'm going to try this, but I don't think I'd add the chicken until closer to the end--chicken seems to sort of disintegrate if you boil it to death with the rice.  It does not seem to be well-seasoned, though that can always be fixed.  Don't really need the water, I don't think, but maybe subbing 1/2 and 1/2 for the milk might be nice.

I didn't have mushrooms, so I omitted them.  It tasted a little bland, so at the end of the cooking time, I stirred in about 1/2 cup cheddar cheese and it gave it a good flavor.

This was very tasty, I left out the oregano and the water as others suggested. I used "Better than Bouillion" to make the broth and I used barley instead of rice because that's what I had.

Very good. I omitted the carrots because I do not like them and used celery instead. I also used wild rice instead of white and brown rice flour instead of white. I had to add about 2 more cups of water but it was very good. Will make again.

LOVED this chowder, but made a few minor changes.  I used 3 1/2 cups chicken stock, no water.  Added a bit of celery with the carrots, just because I happened to have it around.  When it was done it seemed a bit thick to me, so I added some more stock and milk.  Maybe 1/4 cup each.  Delicious, and a definite keeper!

This soup was fabulous!
I made it using leftovers from the night before:  'Honey Curried Roasted Chicken & Vegetables' (also from allrecipes) and the flavour from the chicken and veggies just made this even better.  
I'm going to do this with my leftover chicken every time now.  
Thanks so much for sharing!

This was a great recipe - quick, easy and delicious.  I realized at the last minute that my fresh mushrooms had been in the frig way too long so I used fresh broccoli instead.  I will certainly make this one again and again.

Very good chowder! Other than adding an additional cup of milk to get the soup to our preferred consistency, I didn't change a thing and we really enjoyed the results. The soup is very easy and I would make this again! Thanks Joanie.

Lots of chopping to get all the veggies right, but good filling chow food. And lots of room for your personal taste - i'm gonna try it with beef and/or pasta and/or sour cream next time.

This dish turned out really well. Made some adjustments after reading the previous reviews, such as omitting the additional water. I also used goat evaporated milk which is a substitute for cream, instead of using milk,  I used a whole can. Make sure to use enough pepper for taste. This turned out very yummy, I would definitely make again.

I followed this exactly, I only added 1/2 cup chicken broth from recipe to the sauté/flour mix for a minute before combining to prevent lumps. This was the perfect thickness as is...and delicious!

Followed suggestions and replaced water with more broth, reduced oregano to 1/2 tsp (wife not big fan of oregano, anyway), added some butter to olive oil to cook vegies.  Adjusted to vegies on hand: added green pepper instead of carrots, added cup of frozen loose leaf spinach; also added a couple dashes tabasco to combat blandness complaints. Actually might have used a bit more tabasco, but that could be added to taste.  Overall, with a loaf of Italian bread on the side, we really enjoyed it.  Would have rated 4 1/2 if that were an option.

I did not care for this at all.  The oregano was waaaay overpowering.  Instead of carrots, I used some fresh asparagus that needed to be cooked, and that was a good substitution I think.  However, probably won't try to make again, just didn't like the taste of all that oregano.  I think it would be a lot better just leaving that out altogether.

Followed the directions almost exactly, but switching the water with more chicken broth.  Found the flavor to be very bland.  The consistency is more like curry that's been mixed with rice than an actual chowder.

This is a wonderful comfort food! I made it as written except I had only canned chicken so instead of adding the water, I dumped the chicken and broth in. I used half the amount of oregano because oregano can really overpower the delicate chicken flavors. I added 1 celery stalk, chopped finely. I highly recommend!

Unless you LOVE oregano cut it way down -I thought  the oregano was overpowering!  Will give the recipe another try using less oregano and will resubmit my review.

Wonderful - this is so easy, thick and tasty.  I added one small can of drained corn and it gave it just a little touch of sweetness.  I also added the chicken around 15 minutes before serving and it turned out perfect.

This is a good base for tweaking to whatever you have on hand. Changes I made:  - Used 2 14.5 oz cans of Swanson's chicken broth and no water. - chopped bunch of fresh basil instead of oregano  - brown rice instead of long grain - asparagus instead of carrots - added celery salt to taste I am feeling sick and wanted soup, this hit the spot.

Loved it.  I made it for a luncheon and it got rave reviews.  Everyone wanted the recipe.   I made it with gluten free flour and rice milk to make it gluten free and dairy free.   Couldn't tell the difference.    I added a pinch of cayenne and some porcini salt.  Will definitely make this again.

This was ok...very bland, had to add a lot of salt and the rice did not cook all the way. May try again and add my own twist on it.

Very good.  I substituted heavy cream for the milk.  I really liked the result, it was thick and creamy.  I made it for a group of Veterans, many came back for seconds.

I made this recently and it is a keeper, I did add corn as suggested in previous reviews and the 1/2 water was changed to chicken broth also, though I think more chicken broth is needed for this to be a chowder because as left overs it is no longer a chowder and more like a casserole. Next time I will add more chicken broth and I think I will make it with wild rice.

Made this as directed and it was good.  I think I will tweek next time, maybe leave out the oregano as others have stated.  Seemed to be missing something, will have to play with and see what I like.

This was delicious!  Only thing I did different was add a can of cream of mushroom soup (read in reviews).  Family loved it and daughter copied the recipe.  It's a keeper and will fix again.  Very quick and easy.

Hubby thought it was great just as it was and we'll be having it regularly from now on! I  made a few changes to mine tho: I used 3 stock cubes, no milk, added a liberal pinch of Sage and salt also used half tsp Oregano only as other reviws suggested. Added more garlic. Used raw cubed chicken breast and tossed in flour salt n pepper, browned, removed, added all other stuff to pan, returned chicken, added flour and then added to the stock which was simmering with the rice in it already. The advise in another review about adding broth/stock to your mixture (after thoroughly mixing in the flour) and then returning it to the pan to avoid lumps was handy. Also, once everything was in the same pan it only required about another 15 minutes so in all cooking time was much shorter.

This is delicious! Followed the recipe except I added some frozen peas at the very end and then I forgot the milk, but I don't think it really needs the milk. It looks and tastes like the insides of a chicken pot pie. Used Wondra flour to add to the veggies. Yummy! My husand loves this too and I am going to take it to a group I meet with when it is my turn to take the soup!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe. It is a winner!

Very good - delicious comfort food. I doubled everything but the chicken. I only added the chicken at the point where the (soy) milk is added, any earlier would would have really dried it out. I also added 10 oz. of broccoli at that point, to make this a one pot dish. Excellent.

My husband loved this and the kids enjoyed it as well.  I added butter to my olive oil and added extra garlic.    Next time I will increase the amount of broth, rice and milk to make it more "soupier".  The fresh mushrooms really enhance the flavor.  Use a full container.

I really wanted this to be as good as I was imagining.  However, It WAS very bland and needed quite a bit of jazzing up -- and we have very mild taste.

Excellent chowder!!!  I made this a few days ago after a big snowstorm.  Perfect comfort food for the winter.  I served it with garlic bread and a mixed green salad with herb vinegrette.  My friends are already asking for the recipe. haha!!! Definately a keeper.

This is my first time to write a review!
I made this recipe in a real hurry last night..only had enough chicken for 3 and no mushrooms.  I didn't measure anything...a handful of rice, lots of oregano and a pinch of chilli flakes - for a kick! The children loved it.
It was delicious. I will make a large pot of it next time I have a crowd descend for lunch or supper.  Thankyou.

It was pretty good and it was better then next day.  I gave it a 3 mainly b/c I feel like I can get a similar taste using a campbells soup recipe.  Its on the can.  Brown and dice chicken, add mushroom soup and rice. But I did like it.
