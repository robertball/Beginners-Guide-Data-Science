Ok, so I discovered this recipe about a month ago, and it is SO absolutely delicious that I've been making it almost 4 times a week since! I have also discovered a few tips while making some better and some worse versions of this recipe. First, be SURE to skin the salmon. If you leave the skin on, the spices won't stick to the skin side of the salmon. Second, don't put the melted butter on the salmon immediately after removing the salmon from the refrigerator. This will cause the butter to harden (because the temperature of the butter will drop), and will cause the spices to cake off the salmon while it is being cooked. Third, don't butter and spice both sides of the salmon right away. After the first side is ready (brushed with butter, sprinkled with spice, and then drizzled with butter), place the fillet in the pan with the spice side down, and then butter and spice the second side. Fourth, don't let the salmon sit in one place in the pan, shake it around a little bit while it is cooking. If you don't, the spices will stick to the pan instead of the salmon. Now this is a tip for those of you who have salmon fillets that are thick (like mine always are). You are going to have to do several things in order for it to cook all the way through. After you drop the salmon onto the frying pan, reduce the heat to medium low, and COVER. After 6 to 7 minutes on that side, flip the salmon over and cover again cooking for another 6 to 7 minutes. BON APETITE!

Blackened Salmon is my favorite and this recipe is great.  I don't use butter though, I use olive oil and after blackening in the pan I transfer the salmon to a baking sheet and finish them in the oven.

This spice rub is fantastic! I didn't use any butter at all. I just drizzled the salmon with olive oil before rubbing it with the spices. It still tasted great. I also broiled it in the oven for about 3 minutes per side, then squeezed some fresh lemon over the fish before serving. Yum.

I had this type salmon dish at a local resturant on a ceasar salad. It was so good I wanted to duplicate it at home. After reading the comments I made some adjustments to the recipe and it was a HIT! (using olive oil instead of butter and I used garlic powder instead of onion powder and Cooked in the oven instead of skillet on ONE side only on broil for 5 mins then lower rack and lower temp (350) for another 8-10 mins and it was perfect.) 

Serve this on a bed of lettuce tossed with crutons, parmesan cheese and cesar dressing and it is fantastic. I got both of my boys to eat salad without complaint.
Made lots of extra spice to save for next time.

This is about the only salmon recipe that we ever really use. It's fantastic. In fact, I mix the seasoning together in a double batch and keep it in a container in my spice cabinet.  You can use it on chicken or steak too. It's just better than any prepared cajun spice from the store.  You can lay it on lightly or heavily depending on your taste or mood.  You can sprinkle it in soups and stews or chili.  But it's especially good on salmon cooked exacly as this recipe says.

Very, very good. I will certainly make this again. I only used 1 tablspoon of butter and I added about 5 tablespoons of "Smart Balance" low fat spread. 
I put it on aluminum foil under the broiler. I broiled both sides for about 5 minutes at 500 degrees each and then reduced the temp to about 350 for another 10 minutes. Hardly any smoke at all and the flavor was super.

VERY smokey, do not cook on high.  I used med-high and it set off my smoke alarm.  I would cook on low-medium.  Otherwise very good.

We loved this on Mahi Mahi.  I reduced the butter, and substituted half olive oil.  I also substituted lemon pepper for the pepper.  3 min. on each side for 1.25 " thick mahi fillets on Med-Hi was perfect.  Thanks!

Fantastic!!!  You can avoid the "smokey house" effect by using peanut oil instead of butter, although it does change the flavor just a touch.

I am not usually a fan of cajun type spices...but this is excellent.  It blackens nicely and has great flavor; not too spicy...just right!

Wonderful recipe and not too spicy with my personal modifications!  Took the advice of previous reviewers and: cut cayenne in half, added 1Tbsp garlic powder, used olive oil instead of butter.  I drizzled oil and seasoned both sides of the salmon.  Placed in my broiler @525 degrees for 13 minutes and it was done!  I did not flip it over.  No muss, no fuss!  The longest part of this recipe is mixing the spices which I plan to make a large batch of for future use.  Definite addition to the dinner rotation!

Phenomenal recipe.  The BEST tasting blackened salmon I've ever had. I won't buy it in a restaurant any more with this recipe! For reviewers that had cooking and smoking problems... TURN DOWN THE HEAT!  I cooked these on low-medium (with a covered lid), and had zero issues with smoking.  Turned out perfectly.  Extremely spicy and fabulous. For an extra special dinner and great presentation, serve blackened salmon on top of a Cajun Pasta with cream sauce with red pepper flakes. Add green pepper, jalapenos, red onions - fabulous!

Good recipe, but waaaaaayyy too much cayenne pepper for our tastes!  We like spicy food, but this left our mouths burning!  I would divide the cayenne in about half.  Also I added some garlic powder to give it extra kick.

This is an awesome recipe!!!  I love the flavor of all the spices.  I had an especially thick fillet that didn't cook through when I cooked it in the pan, so I just put it in the oven until it was cooked so it wouldn't dry out.

I made this recipe almost exactly as written with the exception of cutting the cayenne pepper in 1/2 and I didn't add the white pepper or dried basil because I didn't have any.  I also added a little bit of garlic powder and chili powder.  I brushed the butter on my fillets on one side and sprinkled the seasoning and melted a little butter in a skillet on medium high heat and placed the fillets in the skillet to cook seasoning side down for 4 minutes.  While they were cooking, I brushed them with the butter and sprinkled them with the seasoning and flipped them after the 4 minutes.  This fish was very delicious!  My daughter doesn't like fish at all and she ate a whole fillet and said she wants me to make it again!  I served it with rice pilaf and sweet potatoes with brown sugar and butter.  It was a very delicious combination of spicy, sweet and savory.  I will start using this as my go-to recipe for salmon from now on.

This seasoning is very flavorful and delicious! I even put some on a veggie sandwich and was superb!  I made these slight changes: 1/2 tablespoon of cayenne, 2 teaspoons onion powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons of garlic powder, about 1 1/2 tablespoons of fresh thyme leaves minced (I ran out of dried). And used olive oil instead of butter.

This is a great recipe because I'm not a big fan of salmon.  I marinate the salmon in lemon juice for at least 2 hours before cooking.  I never use salt in anything and I added garlic powder.  I use single servings of salmon and bake at 375 degrees for about 25 minutes.  It is an excellent recipe.

Fantastic recipe. I did do a little something extra. After removing the salmon from the skillet, I added a little honey to the pan drippings and simmered over med-low heat for several seconds for a sensational sweet-spicy glaze for the fish.

First recipe I have EVERY tried from this website and this one was DEAD ON! My girlfriend and I were worried about the timing, you know, under cooked fish, but, this one was right on target. And the taste?! As if it we ordered it from a restaurant.

I can't believe I've had all these spices in my cabinet for years and I never thought to combine them together. This is the first time I ever blackened anything. I worried that it would just taste burnt, but it did not, it was fabulous!

Delicious!!  I love spicy foods and this one is amazing!!  I used a grill pan on my stove, buttered one side added the spices, put that side down first, then buttered and spiced the tops.  After they were done, I laid them on top of a green salad with a simple dressing of balsamic vinegar and oil and it was wonderful!! This is definitely a keeper - Thank you so much for this awesome recipe - so simple and so very very good!!

I was scared to make this becuase I've never tried making seafood at home before.  This was easy and delicious.  I recommend it to other novices like myself!

Well - tonight we had the fire department over for dinner .  The minute we put the salmon in the skillet, it smoked so badly that the entire apartment was blanketed in smoke within seconds.  Unfortunately, it made us cough so badly, it burned our eyes, nose, and throats.

So word of advice - don't cook this in a small kitchen - make sure the kitchen is well ventilated.

The taste was AMAZING!!!!!

wow, great recipe!  fyi: i used marjoram instead of thyme because i didn't have any; you can lessen the salt in the recipe as you may find it too salty.  definitely use skinless fillets and make sure your salmon is room temperature.  i used a heavy iron frying pan and heated olive oil on high; buttered and seasoned one side and seared it and while it was searing i buttered and seasoned the other side.  i flipped it over and after a couple of minutes, i turned it down to low heat to cook all the way through.  excellent recipe!!

This was ok. it was a bit too buttery but the flavor is good. just didnt hit the spot or something. it might taste better on catfish. i personally prefer baked salmon or grilled- marinated with the cajun seasoning. my 4 yr old wouldnt eat it and my husband said it was "ok". it tastes better i think as cold leftovers in the fridge. it was good that way. maybe cause the butter was hard again.

This was my first time making salmon and this recipe was quick, easy and most of all delicious. I received rave reviews from the taste tasters in my house. Great recipe!

Giving this great recipe five stars even though I changed a few things. I used a fillet that was boneless but NOT skinless. I just rubbed EVOO all over the Salmon fillet instead of butter. Also, I put in the 375 oven for about 2-3 minutes to finish cooking through. Was DELICIOUS. Had with French bread (French Bread by Janet Vink on this site, also an amazing recipe) and steamed lightly seasoned asparagus. Very nice, quick, and easy meal. The rub is EXCELLENT even though I left out the thyme because I was too lazy to go out to the garden in the dark to get some. The rub ended up being too much as I thought it would be. (even though I heavily coated the salmon with it) but no worries as I will be glad to see how good it tastes on some diced potatoes for breakfast in the morning!

I used chili powder instead of cayenne since that was what I had and it was great. Just a little kick and great flavour. I spiced both sides and made it with the wild rice and orzo salad found on the site. It was excellent.

This was easy and delicious! Took very little time, and the salmon was perfect for on a Caesar salad with good, homemade dressing.

Try serving with a dollop of Tzatziki & fresh lemon wedges...you won't be disappointed if you're a salmon fan!

Blackened Salmon Fillets' Haiku: "Ooowee spicy fish! Olive oil, not butter, was my only change." I did my every best effort to recreate a blackened salmon salad with roasted chickpeas that I recently ate at a restaurant in Athens, GA (I did a chickpea recipe from AR for it as well), and while it came out tasty, it couldn't compare. As far as the actual salmon went, maybe I sprinkled mine too liberally w/ the spice mix, b/c it was fiery hot. I'm glad that it made alot of the seasoning b/c I look forward to using it again, but w/ a lighter hand. Directions were spot-on, and as I mentioned, the only difference I did was to dribble the fish in olive oil rather than butter.

It was a bi too spicy for us but just had to alter the spice mix to how we like it, it's wonderful because takes away the fishiness and brings good flavor without having to be doused in lemon (which I hate).  I will be using this recipe over and over.  It's quick, easy and so healthy.  I serve with sauteed spinach and brown rice. DELICIOUS!

I sub'ed EVOO for the butter for a healthy option but otherwise followed the recipe. I thought it was very good. I can imagine it being a bit spicey for some but i like spice and thought it was tasty. Will make again.

Simply Awesome!  This was so easy to prepare and cook.  My husband was wanting some blackened Salmon like he had tasted in a restaurant and I gave this a try.  He couldn't stop raving how great this was.  I used blackening seasoning instead of all the other spices.  It was much easier than mixing up the others in a bowl.

It was a very good seasoning and change from the norm.  I would definitely serve it to freinds, but with two changes.  I cut the butter in half and would use the outdoor grillside burner for the smoke.  Seasoning can be used on Chicken too!!

This recipe was perfection.  I really enjoyed it and it had the right amount of spice (I love heat.)  Per the other reviews I used olive oil instead of butter and did the broil/bake method.  Served over rice with the honey roasted carrots from this site.

By far my favorite Salmon recipe. The only change I make is to cut the Cayenne Pepper in half. Still has a little kick but not overpowering.

I was looking forward to making this but wasn't really impressed.  It was WAY too hot so if I make again I'd reduce the amount of cayenne.  I cooked it in the oven (broiled for 5 minutes and 8-10 minutes at 350).

awesome recipe!  i've used it on chicken as well and is awesome.  i cut the chicken into tender size strips or have also used chicken tenders.   i used olive oil instead of butter....may smoke a bit more because of the low burn temp of olive oil, but just as tasty.  i cut the cayenne pepper down to just a few shakes instead of 1 tablespoon!  it was still spicy because of the pepper.

My husband & I loved this.  We have done this recipe on Chicken & it was wonderful too.  We thought this was very spicy, but I coated the salmon & chicken until you couldn't see them anymore.  The last time we cooked it, we used our cast iron skillet & cooked the salmon out on the grill.  This was great because it didn't smoke up the house.

Great recipe. I also use dry herbs when making this but I added rosemary to and squeezed lemon on top of my filets.  

Also when cooking this, I used PAM Olive Oil Spray and broiled them for 8-10 min on one side and 5 min on the second side. Then to finish it off, for that extra "blackend" look and a bit of crispiness, I sprayed a pan with the PAM and placed them on each side for about 20-30seconds. Came out excellent!

Only change due to health issues in my house was to reduce the cayenne to about 1 teaspoon, and one teaspoon of salt. I also added a pinch of garlic powder/Seafood Magic. Really delicious recipe...best fish I've made so far, it was a big hit! Thank you for the post :)

Excellent!  Not a salmon eater, but I am now!  I bought a 2lb salmon fillet from my local grocer and cut it into 5 pieces.  The seasoning was a tad bit spicy.  I will probably decrease the cayenne pepper the next time I make this recipe...and yes there will definitely be a next time!

I used a light coat of olive oil instead of butter and ran out of paprika at 1 Tbl but turned out fantastic! I only put the seasoning on one side as the fillet I got still had the skin and I wanted to leave that on, and I'm glad I did cause I still got a nice salmon flavor as well as the spices.

The combination of spices was great: nice spicy flavour that went well with the salmon. Paired it with a spinach salad, and think it would be great with a caesar salad, too. Didn't give it 5 stars because I still prefer my own oven baked salmon, but this was a nice way to change up my salmon routine.

Delicious but SMOKY! Be sure to turn off your smoke alarms, open the windows, and turn on your fans! I omitted the cayenne and replaced the white pepper with fresh ground black pepper... this is my fave salmon/mahi mahi rub!

Everyone loved this, but I think I must have had not had the equivalent of "4 filets" because it was way too much spice!  Next time I'll just cut down the amount a bit.  Delicious!

I used garlic pepper instead of onion powder.  I used olive oil instead of butter.  I brushed olive oil on one side of the fillets and spread the spices on top.  I broiled it on hi for 5 minutes.  It was definietly black.  Then I took them out of the oven, flipped then over.  Then I brused olive oil on the other side and baked it at 350 for 8 minutes.  It was spicy.  I put a little too much spice on.  I scraped the spices off one side and it was much better.  I served it as a ceasar salad- lettuce, grated parmasaen cheese, crutons, and lite ceasar dressing.  It was great.

The spices completely overpowered the flavour of the salmon. I love spicy but this just had an unappealing flavour to it. I scraped most of the seasoning off and still couldn't finish my meal. Very disappointing.

The recipe as written is 4 stars for me...to make it a 5 star though only requires a couple  of changes....cut the salt in HALF (so just use 1 teaspoon) and then reduced the cayenne to 1tsp.  Also....does not need all this butter....I just brushed the fillets with melted butter...then as one other reviewer suggested, put the spice mixture on one side to cook, then waited till I flipped them over to put the spice mixture on the other side. 7-26-12 update...better with less salt, but 1 tsp of red pepper was still too much for me (or maybe I caked it on too thick this time)

Great recipe, made for second time this month tonight. First time we used the butter and followed the recipe exactly. We found it to be good, but a bit greasy and very spicy from the cayenne amount as written. Tonight, we cut the cayenne in half (trust me, I like spicy) and just brushed the salmon with olive oil. For us, much better. The extra butter kept it from getting that nice "crisp" blackening crust the first time. Tonight, the crust was perfectly crisp, and the salmon, perfectly moist. Easy, winning recipe.

This is my first recipe that I ever cook from this site.  The flavor was amazing...My boyfriend LOVED it! I didn't put the salmon on a skillet, I opted to put it in the oven for 40min at 350degrees. I also placed it on parchment paper before placing it on the backing dish just to make sure they wouldn't stick to the pan. The salmon came out moist and had great flavor! Despite the fact that I love spicy food, I may have to cut down on the cayenne pepper next time I make this dish because it was a bit overwhelming.

Loved this recipe.  I used a creole seasoning blend from this site, search under 'creole seasoning blend' by Joselyn H for exact recipe.  I lightly rubbed fish with olive oil and then dry rub.  Then seared them in a med-high pan that had a little butter and olive oil until blackened both sides about 2 mins. Finished in the oven.
Served on top of wilted spinach with garlic and mushrooms...perfect dinner!

This recipe is amazing!! I have made this several times, with many different types of fish and chicken, and it comes out wonderful each time! I have a few small changes that I make: I only use about 1/4 cup of butter, which works just fine and is healthier. On days where I'm not feeling so daring, I also decrease the ground cayenne to 1 T to 1/2 T. This gives it a kick, but doesn't kill you. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves blackened fish. It tastes better than in a restaurant.

My non-fish-liking husband enjoyed this dish. In fact, it's the only time I remember him eating his whole serving. Worked well blackening it on a cast-iron skillet on the grill. Thanks!

I used this recipe completely different than the recipe instructs. I mixed all dry ingredients and used as a rub on the salmon. Then I grilled it. I did not use the butter. It turned out WONDERFUL! I ate the leftover salmon cold over a salad the next day for lunch!

Absolutely wonderful.  My husband and I both loved it.  It is very spicey -- as it should be.  The only negative is that it definitely smokes up the house.

Save lots of fat and calories by using non-fat butter without melting first.  I used it with my dinner and it worked really well.

This was a good recipe. I omitted the white pepper & cayenne as I didn't have any.  Although it didn't seem to lack flavor I would add them the next time I make this recipe to see what I was missing. I would of liked to have known how many pounds to use for this recipe as it only states 4 fillets and salmon isn't something I cook with a lot. I halved the recipe and used a 1 pound fillet, which worked out well.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This recipe was simple, quick, and delicious.  Next time I'll cut back on the cayenne a bit, as it was too spicy for my children.  Other than that, it was delicious.  I used olive oil instead of butter to cut calories and make it dairy free.

Excellent recipe.  Since I am a fan of sweet & spicy salmon, I created my own sauce to drizzle over the salmon.  In a small bowl I mixed honey, teriyaki marinade and lemon juice, heated it slightly and drizzled it over the saqlmon.  I put in back in the oven for 3-5 minutes.  Now this recipe is excellent + 10!

Very good! I replaced onion powder with garlic powder, added 3/4 tspn thyme, used an organic olive oil cooking spray to make it though. Also, on the flip side I covered it for 2 min while cooking. Came out delicious

Great seasoning mix.   I did it all in the oven, following the allrecipes.com video on how to cook salmon, and it came out perfect.  I would have thought it was pan seared if I hadn't cooked it myself.  

Take the salmon out of the fridge 20-30 minutes in advance to take some of the chill off. Preheat oven to 475 and when ready, place a couple Tbsp butter in a glass baking dish and set in the over for 5 minutes while you apply the spices.  

Put the salmon into the hot butter and bake for 3-4 minutes per side, being careful not to overcook it.  Salmon will continue to cook after removed from the hot oven.  Delicious!

Worthy effort. I thought there was WAY too much butter and cayanne called for in this recipe. I will continue to make salmon my way. The key to perfect pan seared salmon is using 1 TBS EVOO with 1 TBS butter to sear the salmon in. I season mine with nothing but 6 pepper seasoning by Durkee, then sear about 3 minutes each side, cover pan with lid then turn the heat off. Leave the pan  with the lid on over the burner that you just used to sear the salmon, as the heat will create steam and continue to cook the center of the salmon without burning or overcooking it. Salmon cooks fast, so this process only takes about 10 minutes. Super easy and the family begs for it!

I liked the recipe a lot but it was a little too spicy for me so next time I'm putting maybe 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper. Whew. Also while I was cooking the salmon my house smoked up soo bad high heat was scary and the fish cooked in like 2 minutes. My throat was on fire before I ate it. No high heat! Lol I will cook this again the blend of spices is marvelous. I also had enough to make 8 filets.

Quick, easy, and easy to customize. Overall very pleased. Did need to cover pan with lid to ensure it cooked through before burning. Not one of our 'best things ever,' but did make it onto the 'will cook again' list.

Great tasting but be careful not to cook too long.  I cooked on one side for 5 minutes and one side 3 minutss.  Just a bit overcooked.  Next time wil will cook three minutes on each side.

First time reviewing any of the recipes on here and I figured I had to since my bf declared it to be the best thing he's ever eaten numerous times after the meal.

I rubbed the spices on and broiled it for 3 min per side according to a previous review.  I only had 2 fillets but thought they were large enough to add the full spice amount, however, I was wrong!  Luckily I had 4 oz of heavy cream left over in the fridge that I used to make a sauce.  I heated it up on medium-low while stirring with a whisk until the sauce thickened up some, then added the fillets and sauteed both sides for a bit to get as much of the spice to rub off into the sauce as possible.  With this addition it went from too hot to eat to very delicious (though still quite spicy).  Would recommend for anyone else that has theirs turn out a bit spicier than they like!  (Could also use yogurt for something a bit lighter)

I love the spice mixture on the salmon, it was not overpowering that I could not enjoy it.  I think I will try this on shrimp as well.  Thanks

Made exactly as written and mmm mmm good. Set your fans on high before you start if you don't want to get smoke inhalation and want to see to be able to flip it! YOW! Very good but VERY smoky! I just might try it with catfish next time. Thanks Jeff Calkins!

Yum!  I LOVE Salmon...and this was very good!  I did cut back on the Cayenne to 1/3 of the suggested amount and the butter was delic...but I will try cutting this amount in half and use Olive Oil in addition next time, to cut back on the greasiness and improve the Health factor.  The crisiness was very nice with just the right amount  of heat in the back of the throat.
 For those who commented that this was too spicy and the salmon flavor was lost......I do not agree.  Salmon in a stronger fish and I felt it held up well to the spicy Blackening.  I will indeed make this again, only I will buy more FISH!
 My Husband really is not a fish lover....but he gave this attempt a 5!  That speeks volumns!

We have been trying to eat more salmon, and have tried several recipes - this is officially the "ONE".  We cut back on the cayenne to keep it kid friendly, but other than that, cooked as written.  We will fix this every week.  I served it with rice and roasted asparagus and grape tomatoes with thyme.

I always hate to give a low rating because I wonder if it were something I did wrong or just have a different expectation.  However, I had to open my windows overnight....  My son, his girlfriend and I all started coughing and the air lingered.  We hoped this meant a real special taste.  Unfortunately the only taste was pepper.   : (

Really really good! I didn't have any onion powder so I used onion salt and omitted the additional salt. It was really hot and I must say it made of a delicious meal.  I also did not used the recommended amount of butter because I thought it was way too much. I will be making this time and time again!

Made this to top a Caesar and veggie salad today, and it was SOOOOOO GOOD!  WOW.  This was SUCH a good seasoning blend.  Best "blackened" recipe I have found.  Bravo!  UPDATE:  I love this seasoning so much I have made a huge batch that I put on tuna, chicken, shrimp... absolutely anything to be honest.  YUM.

Wow! This was so yummy. Like others, I substituted olive oil for the butter & didn't miss it. I broiled the filets for 5 minutes then baked at 350 for another 8 minutes. Delicious!

this is the perfect fish to serve on top of a caesar salad. warning: it is very spicy, adjust the amount of cayenne pepper to your tastes. i used a little bit of olive oil instead of butter and i blackened for 5 minutes under the broiler and cooked for 10 minutes at 350 as some other reviews had suggested. i only blackened one side (does anyone know how you take the skin off the fish?) i will be using this spice rub again for other types of fish.

This is a fantastic recipe!  My boyfriend and I lived in Alaska and worked in a fishing lodge, so we know salmon.  I am always looking for recipes that do not overpower the taste of fresh salmon and this was great.  I substituted some of the salt for garlic salt, and added a little chili powder and extra cayenne.  I only used half of the butter (actually used Smart Balance Light) and cooked it in an iron skillet on the grill.  I heated the empty skillet for about 20-30 minutes on the grill at high heat and only let the salmon cook for about a minute or less on each side.  I served it with a dip of sour cream, horseradish, lemon juice, cayenne, paprika, garlic salt, and minced dried onion.

Very good blackened seasoning. I used far less butter than the recipe called for and it still turned out great. I also added a little garlic powder to the mix. Hubby called it a 10! Thanks.

If I could give it more stars, I would. I blackened a little on both sides then finished in the oven at 350 for 10 min. It was perfect. The spice was delicious but a bit too hot for us. Next time I'll tone it down about 1/5th. But nevertheless it was the best salmon we've ever tasted!

I thought this salmon was ok, but my DH loved it!  I did cut the recipe in half and we took the advice of another reviewer and cooked the salmon in a cast iron skillet on the grill.  There was a lot of smoke, so I'm glad we did!  The only thing we changed was to reduce the amount of butter used.  Instead, we just used about 2 Tbsp of butter along with the same amount of vegetable oil into the skillet.  We found this worked out well.

The spice mix on this just isn't "right".  I made it exactly according to the recipe, and it was much, MUCH too much pepper.  So much so that my husband, who loves spicy foods, wouldn't even eat it.  Neither would my kids.  I was eating salmon for 3 days just to get rid of it.

My husband and I both love this recipe.  I cheated and used a pre-mixed seasoning called Cajuns Choice Blackened Seasoning the first time I made it and it was great.  I make this all the time now using the spice blend in the recipe and it is excellant!  Thank you Jeff :)

Love this recipe! I'm single and make this for myself all the time. I mix up a full batch of the seasonings and store it in an airtight container in my pantry. Served with steamed broccoli and cous cous, this one is a winner!

Was easy and quick... but too much butter and spices.  Really needed to blot with paper towels and I had only used 1/4 of the butter recommended.

Wow! Yummy!!! I made this with just two pieces of salmon.  I mixed up the spices and put it in a ziplock. I only used one tablespoons for two pieces.  Just did it shake and bake style without the butter.  I put a little butter in the pan while cooking it.  I kept moving it around and around quickly as not to burn it.  This was soooo good.  I will make it again soon as I have enough left over spice to do at least two more times.  It was spicy, but not too bad for me. My husband likes things spicy, so I ate the smaller piece of salmon.  I made this with Oven Roasted asparagus from all recipes and garlic bread.  So fast and very little clean up on a busy week day. Thanks for a great recipe.

My husband and I do not like salmon with that being said we loved this recipe!  I will most definitely make this again.  I did marinate the salmon is fresh lemon juice (1 lemon) for about an hour. If you are not a salmon fan, give this a try it might just change your mind!

Followed the ingredients exactly as written - tasted as if this fresh water salmon came directly out of the ocean. WAY TOO MUCH SALT! After a glass of wine I still have the taste of salt in my mouth.

Simple. Goof proof.  Worked perfectly on my Le Creuset square skillet grill pan (thoroughly pre-heated on medium high heat per pan recommendations). Nice grill marks. Easy cooking.  Easy clean up. To my taste just spicy enough and, most importantly, not overly salty as some bottled blackening seasonings can be.

Walking down the isle of my wonderful market, the meat counter just set out this beautiful wild caught salmon. Having a wife and daughter that don't care for fish, I put them behind me, and snagged a nice little fillet for myself!! Having the last two salmon recipes go south on me, river caught, I just couldn't help the fresh pink color of this (and I plan on complimenting the store) stock just made me try it. I dashed home and started supper and the anxiety of "how to" came over me with everything else coming up to done. SO, I looked this recipe up and of dozens, liked the look and sound of this one. Well, it did NOT disappoint!! What a wonderful delicious way to prepare this salmon. I just can't say how much I liked it and the best part is, the wife and daughter sat next trying to take bites!!!!! They liked the crispy ends! I would say follow this recipe to the nail, it's extra tasty as it is although I didn't have oregano. I'm going to try preparing the same way only nuggets to try and have the fam tricked and I'm sure they'll like it. I got an it's ok from them, but kept reaching over for a bite:) that's fine with me!!!!  Guys!! Don't miss this simple and more than great recipe!!!! Truth be known, it's good on albacore as well lol. ENJOY everybite!!! 5 stars from me, delicioso!

This recipe is a favorite for me. I add a little Worcestershire sauce on each side during cooking.  Tried olive oil, but love my land o lakes butter much better.  I did have to decrease the cayenne pepper on my first try to 1 Tablespoon.

Excellent, I only used about 1t of cayenne but otherwise followed the recipe. I will up the cayenne in the future. great flavors. Super easy. Cast iron pan, very hot 2-3 minutes per side depending on the thickness.

This is absolutely delicious! Just a note of advice from making this recipe multiple times... be careful about how thick you put the seasoning on. I couldn't figure out why it was so spicy. I personally like my fish spicy, but the hubby can't handle much. After adjusting the cayenne and peppers multiple times I finally figured out it was how thick I was putting on the seasoning. so just a note that made a HUGE outcome in my experience with the recipe.

This is a good recipe, but I definitely agree to cut the cayenne in half. I cut the salt in half too.  Blackening seasoning is VERY spicy, so it is best to cook it outside (in a cast iron skillet of course) on the side burner of your grill if you have one.  Otherwise, you and everyone else in your house will be sneezing and coughing up a storm!

We LOVE spicy so this was good to us but would probably be too spicy for the average joe.  I thought that the proportions of spices were a bit off - too much paprika and not enough other spices.  Next time I will probably try the spices from a blackened chicken recipe I found on here instead.  Overall a decent meal though. Also, I only used some olive oil instead of butter as per other reviewers suggestions because we are trying to cut calories and it wasn't smokey at all while cooking!

it was easy, only drawback, the smoke from it gave us a major coughing fit. but the taste was superb. we did it in a cast iron skillet. this was the first blackened anything I have ever had, may have to try something else soon! also, there is enough of this mix to use a second time on something else.

I used olive oil rather than butter per some of the other reviews. I, also, went lighter on the cayenne, but my 10-year-old son still said it was spicy. I'll definitely make it again as it was the first time my children seemed to enjoy salmon.

This salmon is to "die for"!!  We love spicy food so this recipe hit the spot.  I am going to try using this rub on chicken breasts also.  Hope it's as good as the fish.

This was delish!  It is VERY spicy, so if you don't like a lot of spice, scale down on the cayenne.  I'll make this one again and again.  Thanks for a great salmon recipe!

I've fixed this recipe at least a dozen times now - it's so easy and delicious, and has become one of our weekly staples. The only change I've made is to omit the melted butter, which is entirely unnecessary. The spice mixture sticks to the salmon just fine without the butter, just spray it with olive oil prior to cooking to prevent sticking. Delicious and a whole lot healthier with this small modification! It's great served over cous cous with some steamed broccoli or kale on the side.

This salmon was delicious and really easy. Careful  not to over-spice the fillets though. If you "cake on" the spice mix it will burn and start to smoke in the pan. Just a dusting gives it that blackened-not-burned exterior.

LOVEE IT!!! I tried salmon once before and didnt like it, I dont really enjoy fish, but my husband does. So i tried this and it was AMAZING! Full of flavor. I would suggest like someone else did here  - that you brush butter on one side and season and cook that side down and then while in the pan butter and season the other side as to not make such a mess and keep as much seasoning on. This is definately a must try.

Wonderful recipe!  I get the pan almost red glowing hot before putting the salmon on.  I prefer to cut the salmon into thin stips before cooking. I highly recommend.

Very good taste. Watch to not let your pan heat up too long or there will be smoke! You can also get away with using about half the amount of butter.

I've been trying to find something good to do with frozen salmon to make it taste better. There are so many things to do with fresh salmon, and if it is fresh, it turns out great with little work. 
This recipe was fantastic with frozen salmon (much cheaper) and I plan on using it again and again.

I made this for dinner tonight and there was not a scrap leftover.  I followed reviewer recommendations to half the cayenne pepper, but it was still VERY spicy.  Next time I will have to cut the pepper even more, my kids loved it but had to take a drink after every bite. This will definately be how we cook salmon from now on, very flavorfull!

Great flavor!  I accidentally put too much seasoning on so it was a little spicy, but otherwise delicious!  I followed other recommendations and broiled for 3 minutes, then baked at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes (2 fillets).  Will definitely be using this again!

I like the way this hides the fishy flavor, I cut the cayenne pepper back to 1 t, 1 Tablespoon seemed like a lot of spice :}

I drizzled some olive oil over the salmon instead of using butter. We served it with a salad and the Company Couscous recipe from this site. Delicious! My husband and I loved it! Thanks for the recipe, Jeff!

My husband loved the spices on this - said it was a well seasoned dish with layers of heat.  I took the reviews to heart and decreased the cayenne pepper by half and it was plenty hot enough! I scraped the spices off my fillet before plating it (since I like less heat than hubs) but left it on my his.  I then took a tip I found here & added some cream to deglaze the pan and created this yummy spicy cream sauce to pour over the top.  Very nice & this one went to the 'keeper' pile. If you do not enjoy heat - you will need to cut back on cayenne & paprika!

I ommitted the butter- I simply drizzled the filets with olive oil and used non-stick cooking spray in the pan.  Absolutely delicious!!

I also like to use catfish. If you have a thick filet don't overcook it by frying longer. Just finish in the oven, which is what a lot of restaurants do.

Really good.. Just a pinch too much spice for me, I would cut back just a tiny bit of the peppers next time.  I've been looking for some good salmon recipes, this one is a keeper. Quick and easy!

I haven't been very familiar with Salmon but this went very well. I loved it! I rubbed the salmon with olive oil and coated the salmon with the seasonings. I also used the olive oil in the pan while I cooked the salmon. Very yummy!

Fabulous recipe!! Easy and delicious. I used halibut, seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and cayenne pepper. I drizzled garlic infused olive oil then squeezed 1 tsp of lemon juice over each fillet, then dotted with parsley butter (yes I know I probably changed the health quota of the recipe). Great with boiled/ roasted potatoes and french beans. YUM.

For such a simple recipe it is delicious.  It helps that almost everything usually a standard staple in my kitchen, just have to go out and by the Salmon, which I prefer fresh.

Best salmon my husband and I've had in awhile. It was better than what's served at a fine restaurant. I tweaked the spices a little to increase the flavor and make it heart healthier: lowered salt to 1 teaspoon, lowered ground paprika to 1 1/2 tablespoons, and used only 1/3 cup butter.

Used frozen Alaskan wild caught fillets with skin.  Used olive oil instead of butter.  Tried to avoid excess smoke by broiling on both sides for 5 minutes.  That was too long.  May try broiling 1 side for 5 minutes and 350degC for 10min next time?

Great recipe and flexible based on what herbs you have (keep with the ones that say 1-tbs or more though). I used olive oil instead of butter and it turned out moist, delicious & healthy! You may find you need to cook a little longer (6-7 min per side).

This was very tasty we ate it over a homemade ceasar salad. Do not overbake. I added only half the cayenne. It made more than enough.

FABULOUS! Followed most of Nikki's suggestions and a few extras, added garlic powder to the rub. Mixed melted butter with a couple tbsps of EVOO. Broiled each side for 5 mins, then baked for 10 mins at 375. Drizzled with lemon once cooked. Made Indian Relish recipe from this site to go with it. Perfect, something spicey and something sweet.

made a large batch of the blackened rub, and use it on everything.  I always thought sugar was needed to "blacken" but this did just fine.

I have now made this spice several times now and me and my bf love it! I use it on both salmon and tilapia with success. My latest--I thought that the fish needed a topping or accompaniment...so I tried this recipe for  Avacado Tomato Salsa from the foodnetwork...uses 1 avocados, peeled, and cut in small dice, 3 tomatoes, cut in 1/4-inch pieces, seed part removed and cut in small dice, 1/2 medium red onion, cut in small dice, 1/4 bunch cilantro, chopped roughly, 1 jalapenos, seeded and minced, 1 ounces lime juice, and salt and pepper, to taste. It was a delicious combination! It was too much served with tarter previously but the salsa is a bit work however, so worth it! I would also cut down the cayenne a little as it does get really hot unless you like it that way.

Outstanding! After reading reviews, I was scared about the spice factor. However, I decided to be brave & made as directed plus adding a tablespoon of hot mexican style chili powder. I did replace the butter with olive oil as many suggested. Loved it! Thanks Jeff for a great recipe.

I love this blackening seasoning recipe.  I've had this recipe saved to my Recipe Box for awhile now, and finally tried it.  This surpasses restaraunts.  It is quite spicy but I love it.  I've blackned tilapia, chicken, and mahi mahi with this seasoning.  I used butter the first time but just brushed it with EVOO the others.  Still very good with less calories and the hassel of melting butter.

This seasoning mixture was real good with the salmon. I only used about 1/4 tsp of cayenne seeing I was feeding to little kids. I flavored 2lbs of salmon and only used about half of the seasoning. All of it would have been too much. Also baked in the oven for 30 minutes at 350.

I made this because my husband loves anything spicy, and boy did he like this. I halved the spices, as previously recommended, and still didn't use all of it. I pan fry for 7 minutes per side and it is perfectly done. This will be a keeper.

This was really good.  I only used half of the cayenne (based on other reviews) and skipped the butter.  I spritzed them with a little olive oil and baked them on parchment paper (baked at 350 for 40 minutes).  They turned out perfect.  I served them with asparagus, hollandaise sauce and wild rice.  Better than a restaurant!!

Whoa...way too spicy.  I only used 1/2 tsp. of cayanne pepper and my family wouln't eat it.  Maybe if you cut out the cayanne it would be better.

This was REALLY spicy...if i made it again, i would drastically cut the amount of cayenne.    I drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with spice then broiled for about 6 minutes each size.  I let it sit in the oven (with broiler off) for an additional 5 minutes (i like the salmon to be pretty well done).  Good overall flavor.

I'm not much of a fishy person, but I loved this!  My husband likes anything blackened so it was a big hit for him too.  I didn't have unsalted butter so I used salted butter and omitted the salt from the recipe.  Didn't have any cayenne pepper so I placed a bottle of texas pete on the table but neither of us grabbed it.  I also used cracked peppercorn instead of reg. black pepper.  It was really REALLY good!  I will make again very soon.

This recipe is very simple. I used fresh Atlantic salmon with the bones still in. The steaks were very thick, so I first cooked the salmon and then blackened it. Very good! will definitely do again.

This dry rub is great!  I used spray butter on the salmon instead of regular and it still was great. My husband absolutly loves it.  It is very spicy though, so go light when sprinkling on fish.

This is an insane recipe. It is so full of flavor and the salmon was so buttery soft. It is quite spicy so beware! I love spicy food so I could handle it jut fine, but my husband had to wash it down with a glass of water. LOL Nevertheless, he said it was very tasty. The only thing I did different was marinate the salmon for about 4 hours.

I don't know why, but I ended up with way more seasoning than I needed....I only used half of it, if even that.  These tasted good, but they were a little too spicy for my 5 and 2 year olds.

This was GREAT! I have never cooked salmon before so this recipe seemed easy enough and it was! My b/f wasn't planning on having any but when he saw how good it looked he decided to take a bite and loved it. It will definitely become a staple in our house!! Thanks!

After the smoke alarm went off and everyone had a chance to calm down, we found out the salmon was only OK.  I prefer only setting off the smoke alarm for recipes that are worth the noise.

I just made this, and it was fantastic!  Only my second time making salmon and I did make a few changes to taste...  I was out of oregano so nixed it, I added a touch of savory, I chopped two cloves of garlic and cooked them while I melted the butter and used that to brush the salmon... It came out perfectly!  Thanks so much!!!

I have made this 3 times now with tilapia instead of salmon.  The first two times I cooked it in the oven and it was great but the last time I tried it on stove using olive oil instead of butter and it worked even better.  I did do what a lot of others are saying, I'm just sprinkling the spices on after I mix them.  Wonderful dish!!! We will now have fish at home much more often.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

This was very good, but be careful with the spice!  Next time I'll sprinkle more lightly.  Will also use fresh minced garlic and lemon juice to add a bit more flavor.

This was a great quick recipe. We had with some wild coho salmon and my husband said he would easily pay $20 in a restaurant for it. I'm glad to hear the smoke was a normal part of the experience, we are lucky to a have a deck to eat on or we may have passed out.

WOW! This is so good! I fixed it for my boyfriend who LOVES seafood and he couldn't say enough about how good it was. I served it with rice pilaf and mango salsa. Yu-ummy! Definitely going into my regular rotation.

It was well worth the smoke. Seasonongs all worked well together and the "heat" creeps up on you rather than set your tongue on fire with the first bite. I can't wait to try it again and again.

Spice blend was very good, however, I did cut back on the cayenne to 1/2 tbsp. and it was plenty spicy for us.  I also baked and then finished off under the broiler with good results.  I have blackened fish before the traditional way in a skillet and it makes way too much smoke in the house.

This is a great recipe & very easy.  I didn't mix the spices prior, I just sprinkled each of the spices on my fillets after I brushed butter on them.  The spices are a very good blend.  I needed something with lots of spices since I had a brand of salmon I wasn't crazy about.  Be sure to have your vent fan on & a window open---lots of smoke with this recipe.  I will definitely use this recipe again, and will probably try it on chicken as well.

Very good.  Made it on a George Foreman grill, but it came out nice.  Quite spicy, I served with scalloped apples to cut the spice a bit.

Excellent dish!  The whole family loved it.  Instead of cooking it on a skillet, I grilled it on a charcoal grill, and it turned out wonderful.  I will be making this again.

Because my husband is a fisherman, we tend to be fish recipe snobs... this was by far the best way we've found to cook salmon.  We've already had it twice in the last week, and served it to the in-laws... FANTASTIC!!  Definitely must use a cast iron skillet on the grill, though.  We smoked up the house trying it on the stove.

Never fear the balckened seasoning... I used half the dry mix as a rub and then mixed the butter and the other half of the blacken seasoning and created a seasoned butter to use as a baste and a glaze.

This recipe is wonderful! We were never big salmon eaters in our family, but now we absolutely love it! And as far as the "smoke" goes... that's all part of blackening food! If there's no smoke...you didn't blacken it! Turn on the exhaust fan and ENJOY!! Delicious!

My family LOVED this recipe and we're picky about our fish. I didn't have any problem with the house "smoking up". Perhaps the ones who did cooked it too long and with fish, you really have to be careful not to overcook or fish gets mushy. I did cut the butter in half though. I would definitely make again!

The seasoning is my favorite cajun style seasoning i have tasted.  It goes well on everything that i have tried it on, esp. hot wings.  And if you're having trouble with the smoke filling up the house, try turning on the vent... it helps a WHOLE lot.

This method is FANTASTIC... Fish is usually so ''bland'', but the  Cajun spices work very well & blackens the salmon nicely... The only changes I made, for dietary purposes, was I brushed the salmon with Olive oil... and used olive oil & a small amount of margarine in the skillet... there was 'no sticking' either.... I've made this twice now & it's going into my rotation...

Sooo good! My son took one bite and said, "MMM!!... can I have this in my lunch tomorrow?"  My husband couldn't stop saying how good it was after every bite :)  Salmon is expensive so it's rewarding when it turns out so good. I used half the amount of  Cayenne but did the rest as  written. I used a big fillet with the skin on one side, cut into 3-4 large pieces.  I sprinkled most of the spice mix on the fleshy side, seared the fleshy side down in a fry pan in lots of butter then transferred it (skin side DOWN) on a homemade tin foil pan (Fold tin foil to make a cookie sheet-like pan with shallow sides). I poured the butter from the pan onto the fish and sprinkled a little more spice. Then BBQ on the tin foil for about 10-15 mins depending on the thickness of the fish.  Then, you can use a spatula and lift the fish off the skin and place onto a plate, leaving the skin attached to the tin foil. Delish!!  Healthy too! (except the butter! ... but the butter gives it that crispy, blackened texture).

Great Cajun fish. I skipped the thyme and oregano and would probably use just a pinch of Old Bay next time.  I just filet the fish thin spread butter on with a knife and season.  cook on really high heat on my Circulon grill.  Really couldn't be any easier and easy clean up too.

This has become our favorite Salmon recipe, even for my husband who won't eat any other seafood. If the heat of the spices gets too overwhelming, I recommend playing with the amount of cayenne pepper. Even just half a teaspoon can give some nice heat but allow for the more subtle flavors of basil and thyme to come out. If your salmon steaks are small (like from Target or Wal-Mart) I suggest putting the butter into the pan and letting it melt. With the salmon coated on both sides with the spices, it only takes 4 minutes on each side to cook.

Wowsa! I love "blackened" food and this was right on the money. I was only making 2 servings so halved everything except the thyme, basil and oregano. Even though I like things spicy I went easy on the cayenne.  I didn't find it necessary to do the extra butter drizzle on the fish after it had already been brushed with butter and coated with seasoning.  Used a well used and loved cast iron pan that I got sceamin'smokin' hot and didn't oil the pan at all. Put the fish in and didn't touch it until I turned it. Fish didn't stick at all. Sure, had to shut off the smoke detector lol, but a smokey house was totally worth these amazing flavors. Served with roasted sweet potatoes and a salad with lots of bell peppers and a very lemony vinaigrette, both of which went perfectly with the fish. One of the best meals I've made in a long time.

I made this for my boyfriend who loves salmon. I was worried it may be too hot so I halved everything. Looked and smelled amazing while cooking but oh my god was it SPICY. Definitely worth making again but will put even less spice next time!

Great.  It was very easy and fast to make on a week night.  A little too spicy for me but I still gave it 5 stars because I can change the spices to suit my taste.  Will make again.

I have made this once a week for the last month, I love this recipe! Not all the kids do but I do and so they can eat fish sticks instead. I pair it with rice and coleslaw. Dredging the fish in a bit of coleslaw really takes the heat down a notch and the flavors pair nicely together.

Awesome recipe! I substitute the salt with garlic salt, and added 1/2 teaspoon of tandoori seasoning for a slightly different twist. Definitely keep the skin on the salmon and careful not to over-cook when baking or broiling. Bet this rub would be great on trout, can't wait to try it on other thick fleshed fish.

This recipe is SO good! I only had to buy 1 of the 9 spices. I am not a confident cook. But I was able to make this, and my husband who's a great cook, loved it! Definitely making this salmon again :D

I have had this recipe for a few years, and have not made it in awhile so when I made it last night, I had forgotten how tasty this salmon was!  We are wimpy so cut the cayenne in half, and I use smoked paprika on everything.  I always overcook meat, fish, etc. so having a recipe with explicit cooking times is very helpful to me.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, was very flavorful, and had just the right amount of kick for wimps with the reduced cayenne.

I've made this twice now. It is spicy, so I cut back on the paprika the second time, but my fiance really likes it and has continually mentioned it until I made it again (tonight). Does make a lot of smoke, but had no real issues. Easy, healthy, dairy-free salmon dish. A keeper!

This is our go-to recipe for salmon, now that we have a cheat to make it cook up faster: instead of sauteeing each individual fillet in butter in a skillet, I lay them all out on a baking sheet, slather with butter, and pour the spice mixture on.  And for my kids, I pour on a LOT less of the spices!  I usually am able to get a lot more than 4 fillets out of one batch of spices :D  We like this served with brown rice and roasted squash.

I only changed a couple things: I used onion salt in place of onion powder and salt as I didn't have onion powder. I also used a mixture of butter and olive oil instead of just butter. Because I didn't want to smoke out my apartment, I opted to bake it in the oven at 425 degrees for 15 minutes (which I know cooks the fillets I like to use). I also used slightly less seasonings than what the recipe called for. It came out really really yummy! I'm quite happy with this and will probably make it at least a couple times a month. I'm not a huge fish person, but this made me really enjoy it.

I cooked this recipe tonight for supper and ended up throwing over half of it in the garbage. You may wonder why I still gave it 4 stars. The reason is because, although my husband and son loved the flavour of the spices, it was way too salty. The only changes I made to the recipe were to use regular butter because I had no unsalted butter and, because of that, I cut the salt in half and used one teaspoon of salt instead of the called for two. My husband said he was afraid for his blood pressure and my son said he was afraid he'd get heart palpitations so I know it was salty. I didn't try it because I can't eat that much spice. I'm keeping the recipe but changing the butter to olive oil and still keeping the added salt to one teaspoon. I'll give it one more try like that and see if they'll eat it then.

I made this tonight for company and all the wives asked for the recipe. I only made a tiny change. Instead of black pepper I used a pepper blend that is slightly spicy. and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I added webers roasted garlic herb seasoning 1/4 tsp to the sauce. Highly enjoyed it and will be making it often due to how easy it is.

Followed recipe using smoked paprika, limiting the cayenne for me, lots for my hubby. Simple, quick, and easy to cook. I did add tsp minced garlic to the butter (made this dish tastey but oily) and it turned out well. Better than I expected. Will do it again probably with these same adjustments.

OMG.....amazeballs of flavour!!! To top it off, I added a little diced cucumber, red pepper and red onion salsa (mini diced) with a dash of tobasco, 1/2 a lime juice and red wine vinegar as a topping....guaranteed to hit your palate with a succulent quest!! I hand rubbed the spices on both sides, and pan fried with grapeseed oil on med-high heat (high smoke point) flesh side first with a tad of butter to give it the browned butter flavour! YUMMMMMLY

Good flavor, but rice was definitely needed to calm my mouth.  Cooked with olive oil, not butter.  First side 2 1/2 minutes on med high, then turned down and covered and cooked on low.  Smoke filled the pan and hubby and I coughed a lot.

This recipe had way too much salt for me. Half a teaspoon per piece of fish is just way too much for my household. It says four salmon fillets but doesn't say what size. I used quarter pound fillets. Maybe that was the problem. The salt really obscured the flavor of the fish. I'd try this again but with much less salt, like 1 tsp. As they say, you can always add salt but once you've ruined your dish you can't take it away.

My husband and I LOVED it...I was looking for another way to cook salmon other than baking it. When I took a little corner of the fish I thought at first it was too spicy, but after I fixed my plate I thought it was amazing. I didnt use the butter I used pure olive oil and I cut the salt back to half of the serving (and I used sea salt). Love it and def will be adding this to my book to pass on down to the fam..lol..Thanks for sharing!

This is the first time I have attempted to cook salmon, so I did everything as the directions stated.  I can't believe how easy this is to make.  It was a little too spicy for me, but my husband loved it!  He said it was the best salmon he has ever had.  He said when he orders salmon at restaurants, it usually get boring and bland, but he ate the whole piece and said he wished there was another one waiting for him.

This recipe is better than any blackened salmon I've had in restaurants.  I originally didn't have white or ceyenne pepper, I just added more black pepper.  It was great then, it was even better when I added the other peppers.  Blue Ribbon recipe in our household!  (I taped the recipe on the inside of our cupboard for quick reference.)  Thank-you!

My husband made this in our cast iron skillet.  I don't keep white pepper on hand so he used a combined total of 3/4tsp black pepper.  The spice blend was perfect.  He paired the fish with baked sweet potatoes for a no-fuss-yet-fabulous dinner.

Seasoned and cooked 1st side. Then seasoned 2nd side when 1st half was cooking. Didn't burn/smoke...absolutely picture/restaurant perfect.

Super Easy!
So far have made this twice with Mahi Mahi (DH doesn't care for salmon).  No changes to original recipe, used black iron skillet to cook in, came out delicious!

This is so amazing. I'm not a big salmon eater, but i am eating this twice a week. I did cut the cayenne pepper in half, I LOVE very spicy food, but that was a bit much. Also didn't half white pepper. I also Put this in my oven on broil for 3 or 4 minutes(until blackened) then moved it to the lower rack on 350 for another 4 minutes. It was wonderful

This was very good.  I cut my serving size down to 2.  I used the reviewers advice and moved the heat down to medium and covered...but, it was not done at 7 mins per side....mine needed an extra 2 mins per side.  I did not have a problem with the fish sticking to the pan because I sprayed the pan with non-stick spray.   I think next time I'll try searing this then throwing it in the oven.

This was great but a little too spicy for the hubby! (lol) The hubby and the 3yr old drank lots of water with this meal. If I had known it was going to be so spicy I wouldn't have made a spicy side dish to go with it.  However, I like spicy foods so it was just fine to me.

Thought this was excellent!!  Made mine on the grill.  Instead of butter - sprayed aluminum foil with pam and sprinkled salmon with olive oil and folded in foil leaving enough room for heat to circulate.  Cooked on grill for 20 minutes - excellent.

Of all the salmon I have eaten in my life, this is the best recipe I have ever tried.  The only changes I made were to cut the cayenne pepper in half because I don't like anything too spicy. And I didn't have thyme on hand so I mixed a few drops of peppermint extract with a couple ounces of water and sprinkled it on the fillets with my fingers while cooking. Salmon has a certain fishy taste that I tolerate but have always wanted to find a way to get rid of. I was so pleased to find that this recipe accomplished that for me!  Quick, easy, wonderful recipe!

Tasted great, but accidentally set off the fire alarm, and the smoke caused me to choke (guessing it was due to the ground cayenne pepper) Will cook on medium heat next time to prevent smoking. Otherwise great!

Excellent salmon recipe - tastes just like a version I recently had at a restaurant and did not taste fishy at all like salmon can.  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, I just used paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, garlic salt & a little creole seasoning.  A little butter in the pan is all you need - 1/2 cup would have been too much.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Very good!  I only used 1 tsp. of cayenne and it had plenty of heat.  I used seasoned salt in place of plain salt and omega-3 canola oil in place of butter.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Very good spice rub.  Just the right hotness and great flavor.  I agree with the other reviews about broiling it rather than frying.  Also very important that the fish not be too cold when you put the butter on the salmon or it will harden and the spice mix will flake off.

This is fantastic!  I eat a lot of fish, and this is one of the better recipes I've tried.  I did make three small changes, though.  First, I used olive oil instead of butter.  Second, I put nearly all of the spice rub on a single fillet (I like it hot...).  Third, I only cooked it in the pan about a minute on each side.  I finished cooking it by putting it on a piece of tin foil in the oven for about about 5 minutes at 350.   This is a great recipe, though...definitely a keeper.

Did recipe for 2.  Easy, good I halved the butter and used CBN Butter Stick.  Cut the salt to a couple dashes over the fish.  Cut the white pepper down to 1/8th.  Good flavor.  I used medium heat at didn't flip or move but once.

Wow, delicious.  Definitely on my short list of dinners to make.  I put half the amount of butter and it worked out just fine.  Took about 5 minutes on one side like the recipe states and another 5 minutes once flipped over.  Fantastic.  Highly recommended.

I followed the ingredients for the spice mixture as listed, but replaced half the onion powder with garlic powder.   Rather than using butter, i brushed the fillets with olive oil, before coating with spices.   I heated a cast aluminum pan on the BBQ over high heat, sprayed it with cooking spray, and then put the salmon in for about 4 minutes per side.   Turned out delicious - just the right amount of heat in the spices!! It was fantastic topped with the "Indian Relish" from this website.   Will make again!

This recipe is AMAZING.  However, it filled my house with smoke!  Use Peanut Oil or Corn Oil instead of butter to avoid setting off your smoke alarm.  I have cooked salmon numerous ways, including the Fircracker Salmon recipe from the top 20 on this site and this recipe is the best way to cook salmon I have ever tried.

I don't eat seafood but those who did said it was great!  I did not use the cayenne because we were out.  Instead of plain salt (again- out), I used a garlic salt mix.  I used a cast iron pan and cooked the fillets over the grill, thanks to another review.  I've never done that before but it sure was great suggestion to prevent the house from heating up from using the stove.  I also used the recipe to cook myself some chicken thighs, which were very yummy.  I enjoyed the chicken over a salad of mixed greens with light ranch-- perfect for a summer night!  Thank you for sharing this one, I'll keep it for both salmon and chicken!

This was great. I just made one filet since I was just cooking for me. I sprinkled the salmon with Creole seasoning, then just sprinkled some basil, oregano, and thyme without bothering to measure. I used a well seasoned cast iron pan to cook it. The good thing about this recipe is you don't need to be precise with the spice amounts, and it still turns out great.I also think the key is to use a thinner filet so it cooks all the way through before it "overblackens". I will definately be making this one again!

So good!  I followed one reviewers advice and served the salmon on top of a caesar salad.  My husband ate his in about three bites!  No more chicken caesar salads for us.

I didn't find the butter necessary.  I rubbed the spices on the fish and let them marinate for about an hour in the fridge first and then just fried them in oive oil.  They blackened up just fine and tasted amazing. I will use less salt next time though. Also, I cut the dry ingredients measurements in half and it was just enough for 4 fillets so I'm glad I didn't follow the recipe exactly and waste spices.  All in all, great recipe!

From reviews/ I drizzled with olive oil before I rub the spices and used my George Forman grill. Served with caesar salad and twice baked potatoes. Very good!

Fantastic!  Super easy.  I used oil instead of butter (dairy allergies) and they turn out great every time. I use only 1/2 TB of cayenne or less and they are plenty spicy.  Great for guests and my kids like it too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

WARNING!  Though this recipe generates the absolute BEST blackened fish (I used salmon) the fumes almost killed my entire family and our guests!  I followed the recipe exactly and when the fish hit the pan the fumes were their own form of pepper spray.  When the fumes hit the lungs…the universal reaction was to attempt to cough up that lung. The salmon was superb last night. This morning, everyone’s lungs are almost back to normal.

Excellent recipe! Very moist and with a good kick to it. Best advice I read from reviews was to make sure salmon wasn't too cold so the butter hardened and to sear the salmon and then cover so the juices stay in. Very yummy and will make again!

What a great rub!  I made a homemade sauce for dipping (similar to Outback's) and didn't even use it.  To reduce the smoke I drizzled the fillets with olive oil before putting the rub on.  In a preheated pan I added just a bit more olive oil and a little butter.  5 minutes per side on a medium heat and presto.

Incredibly Tasty! It is not as spicy as you might believe.  My wife cannot tolerate too much heat and she ate the entire meal.  After I washed the fish I patted them dry and rubbed on the spice mix on both sides.  I did not butter them, instead I heated the butter in the pan (Grilling Pan) and placed the skin side up first for 5 mins.  Carefully flip and another 5 mins.  Serve skin side down.  Spices stuck to fish and fish did not stick to pan.  Cannot wait to make again.

Hmmm,I really didn't care for this recipe,I did it tonight and yes,I'll admit I didn't use the full paprika,cayenne pepper mixture because I was afraid using it full strength would be too hot but it wasn't but the salmon itself I didn't care for. It was good and filling but not worth making again.

Really good. Turned out great, even for a novice who doesn't cook much. The mix was a little too spicy. Next time I will not add so much pepper and use less butter.

This was surprisingly good; I only recommend using the rub sparingly.  I fully coated the filets and it proved to be a bit too spicy, yet still delicious.  Unless you love very spicy foods you may want to consider using half of the rub.

Quick and Easy.  I brushed both sides with Olive Oil and then pressed the filets into the spices.  I then fried them in butter and Wow!  My husband and I both loved it. Great kick with all the spices. Salmon will be on the rotation of weekly meals.

There isn't much of a need for my comment, but this is GREAT!!!! I actually already had my "signature" salmon dish which was a blend of chilli powder, brown sugar, salmon marinated in pinneaple juice etc. but when I tried this my bf and I both agreed that this is the new replacement!!!!! My kitchen did smoke a bit, but I cooked the salmon on med-high and it wasn't unbearable, this is a must try and will be on my bi-weekly dinner rotation for a while!!!

Great recipe!  I used my Cuisinart Griddler instead of frying on cooktop.  (this eliminated any potential smoke)  I also substituted the salt for garlic salt, and added a touch of cinnamon sugar for just a hint of sweetness.  Outstanding--will make again for sure.

Absolutely excellent!  The seasoning was spot on!  I used a lemon garlic olive oil spray to spray both sides of my salmon rather than use the butter and still it was outstanding! The perfect amount of spice!  My fillets were kinda thick so I ended up cooking for about 8 minutes each side.  Excellent!  Thanks for posting!

Tasty, spicy, and great over rice with some Sake on the side. Be sure to have plenty of ventilation for the last step or you will get smoked out!

Best done on a grill. It smoked up my house so badly, the cat left for another room because he was coughing so much. Overall the recipe was good, it just wasn't quite the flavor I was looking for.

This has taken over as our favorite salmon recipe.  The flavor is incredible...just enough kick. I did need to turn down the heat and cover to get it done in the middle.  My fillets were a little thicker in the middle and that may have been the difference.  Very good!

Awesome recipe!  Wouldn't change a thing!

I imagine that the people who have experienced the excess smoke while cooking might not have a gas-range stove but an electric, which can heat things up too quickly and cause that effect.

Happy cooking!

I had a freshly-opened packet of cayenne, so this definitely had some kick.  Definitely have some bread or rolls if you lay the seasoning on thickly.  But it was great!  We used on pre-shaped salmon Patties from TJ's and the husband and kids all loved it.  Will have to try some of the other reviews and use it on the tilapia in the freezer too.

Super easy and very delicious.  Entire family enjoyed this dish.  I used EVOO instead of butter for a healthier version.

My kids (18 & 16) got me to buy salmon so I bought a single fillet with the skin (just under 3/4 of a lb.) on.  I found this recipe and was encouraged by the reviews.  With only the single fillet I divided all the ingredients by 4.  I used Kitchen Collection Quality Cajun Seasoning instead of the paprika, cayenne pepper, onion powder and white & black pepper.  I also used a butter substitute and only halved that (it is what I had on hand).  All of us agreed this was outstanding and we are already looking forward to doing it again.

I love the reviews.  They really help someone like me who had never cooked salmon before.

One word - YUM!!  I made this for the first time last spring for my hubby's b-day and we love it so much we have it at least once a month.  I serve this along with the Avocado, Tomato and Mango salsa and jasmine rice.  Delicious!! (It does have quite a bite to it, so if you don't care for spicy seasonings, cut down on the cayenne or skip this altogether.)

I omit the butter altogether (if you use a non-stick pan, you really don't need it) and adjust the cayenne down a bit so it's not quite so hot... but overall, fabulous! It's such a great flavour with the fish.

I have tried using several over the counter cajun spices and they are all flavorful but to salty. This mixture is perfect when sprinkled moderatly over the fish.  Used this recipe to cook trout streamside on a hiking stove at high heat with skin and pin bones removed from fish.  Final word...  Delightful!!!

I usually double this blackening mixture and keep it in a jar in my spice cabinet.  I use it on all kinds of stuff.  It also works as a fabulous low-cal low-carb substitute for bbq sauce... I'll mix it in with a little olive oil and wine or water, and mop it over chicken, then sprinkle on a little more before I remove it from the grill.. it's divine.

This was a really great recipe, but as others said it REALLY smokes up the house! Just a tip -- don't drench the filets in the seasoning. I really enjoy and can handle spicy food, but when doused in the mixture I was having trouble, it was much to spicy! Be sure to "sprinkle" on.

I was making plain white fish and wanted to "be creative" with my meal as my husband puts it.  I saw this recipe and thought I'd try it and it was fantastic on cod I imagine it is the same for the Salmon. He loved it and so did I. Thanks.

Outstanding! I tried this recipe on basa fish & it was GREAT.  As fast as it was being taken out of the skillet my hubby was eating it. Love the flavor especially the spicy taste & I know the taste of spicy food (PROUD of living in New Orleans my birthplace).  The kids love it -had to cut down on the cayenne & pepper for them. Will use this as my MAIN recipe for blacken fish. THANK YOU Jeff C. for sharing this recipe.

Previous 'blackened' recipes I've tried have overwhelmed the salmon - this spice blend worked brilliantly. To decrease fats, I dipped the filets in olive oil before dusting with spices. Served atop mesclun salad accompanied by sliced okra and baby corn ( dusted with corn meal and fried for 5 minutes). Brilliant.

This was great! I cooked on top of the stove for roughly 5 minutes total (about 2.5 min each side, just enough to sear) and then broiled in the stove. I also tried this recipe with Tilapia, and it turned out just as good. 
A keeper! Thanks for the great recipe!!

I've often broiled the salmon also, using a bit of olive oil and the same seasonings, also using Smart Balance instead of the butter.

Oh, WOW. This is by far the best fish recipe I've tried from this site. It was so easy, and it blackened perfectly--nice and crispy, with just the right balance of spices. I used fresh herbs, and instead of butter, I used coconut oil (which doesn't actually taste like coconut, it just gives you the richness of butter without the unhealthy dairy fat). As other reviewers have said, definitely worth the smoke-filled kitchen!

Excellent. I think I found a new way of preparing salmon. Made extra seasoning to have on hand whenever I make this. I'm sure this could be great on chicken as well.

This was pretty good. It filled the kitchen with smoke so next time I'll try it on the grill.  It also needs a bit more of the cayenne...didn't really have enough heat for our tastes.

FANTASTIC. I omitted the cayenne pepper in the interests of kids eating it and it wasn't missed at all. I also used only 3-4T of butter instead of the whole 1/2 cup - no need to drizzle butter all over it - it's already being cooked in it! Again - WONDERFUL recipe!

OMG!!!  This was **so** good.  My mom & I really enjoyed it.  Quick & easy to make, and exactly what I wanted it to be.

I used half as much pepper, a little less salt, unsalted margarine, and 1/3 less Cayenne pepper.  I cooked it on the outside grill in a cast iron skillet.

I will ABSOLUTELY be having this again!

HEED OTHER REVIEWERS WARNING! Do not cook this inside the house, unless you want to open all windows and doors! It was so smokey we all choked through dinner...but it was delicious! I would recommend cooking less than 4 minutes on each side, because mine burnt a little...but overall the fish was nice and moist, and the flavor was terrific! Thanks:)

Great fish, loved it. Dipped the fish in the melted butter then sprinkled the seasoning on, then poured the rest of the butter in the pan and cooked the fish in all that wonderfully fattening, delicious butter, blackened it, then finished it in the oven.  Turned out great.

I used this to blacken chicken.  Wasn't too smoky or anything, just the 'hot' flavor overwhelmed everything else.  I will have to play with the spices a bit more for it to have real appeal to us.

Other reviewers weren't kidding about the amount of smoke!  The salmon was very nice, but looking at the title, I was hoping for something a bit spicier.  Next time, I will dredge the salmon in the seasonings, instead of sprinkling it on.  Overall, it was good.  I will probably make it again.

We eat salmon in my house at least once a week so I'm always looking for new recipes.  This one has been my family's favorite by far.  Even my toddler loved it!  The only substitution I made was creole seasoning instead of the cayenne and then I left out the salt and onion powder.  I cooked these on the George Foreman grill and they came out perfect! Fabulous recipe!

OUTSTANDING!  Spice mix is excellent.  I think the amount of butter called for in this recipe is needed for speedy "blackening".  Also, turning vent fan on as soon as you start cooking cuts down on smokiness.  Next time I will do this in the burner of my outdoor BBQ.  Try this recipe and you will be a hit.

Just finished this recipe as a meal.  Excellent.  One of the few recipes that comes out as it might in a restaurant.  Actually blackened properly; also looked and tasted great.  Not overly hot at all - for those who enjoy hot and blackened foods - just tasty.  Very impressed.

these tasted ok, but the smoke from cooking it filled the house so much that we set off all the smoke alarms and had to go outside along with all of our pets (including a caged bird). I wont make it again, not worth the hassle.

This is one of my favorite ways to make salmon.  Don't always use butter; sometimes substitute olive oil or canola oil or even the spray butter - all work well.  Can alter spices a bit if you prefer it with a bit more "bite".  Very good!!

First time cooking salmon at home, eat it at restaurants a lot. It was a little on the spicy side, but I loved it. I grilled it on my Forman Grill 4-5 minutes. Thermometer read 145. Skin pulled right off after cooking, but I couldn’t get it to come off before.

I rubbed top side of salmon with ghee and then added the dry rub mixture. I just left the skin side bare. Cooked in air fryer skin side down on 400 for 7 minutes. It was delicious and super quick and easy. I will be making this often.

This was just as good as any Salmon I've had at any of those expensive restaurants.  The seasoning was perfect.  The only changes I made was I used olive oil instead of butter and I baked it in the oven.  Will definitely make it again and again and again.

i was so excited when I made this recipe ,as my husband is not a favorite of any kind of fish : let alone salmon.  When I make cod  he tolerates it .  Salmon was  out of the question Pan seared,baked ,or steamed it would sit on his plate untouch. So when prepared this recipe  he was very dubious on trying it.
BAM !!! what a success he actually had 2 pieces of the salmon.
This recipe  is full of flavor and the blacken salmon heightens the taste. regretfully I did not take pictures . In the future I will . This recipe will be the go to recipe when I cook Salmon. 
Thank you so  much.

My husband went to the supermarket looking for something special to eat.  He found some great looking  fillets of salmon which had the skin on, so that is what we used.   I followed the recipe for the most part, did not have white pepper, so used only black and instead of butter used olive oil to brush the fillets before  putting the spices on it.    I also added a bit of  chili powder and garlic powder to the spices.  Sorry Allrecipes but I cannot cook anything without garlic and onions .  I did use a bit of butter mixed with olive oil when cooking the fish.  I cooked the fish on an iron skillet and according to the cooking instructions.  Our fish came out incredibly delicious and even though I am not a big fan of salmon, I liked this recipe very much ...double  thumps up. Oh, when serving, I sprinkle a bit of fresh cilantro and the green part of scallions on top of the fish!   Yummy

I used half the suggested amount of salt and it was still way too salty for my taste. The heat while nice, seems to render the flavor of the fish moot.

This was very good, but there was a little too much cayenne pepper for our taste. Just cut the pepper a little if you don't like things REALLY spicy.

Turned out wonderfully. I would recommend turning the heat to medium-low rather than medium-high. This dish generated lots of smoke in my apartment and I had trouble breathing. Also, the nutrition label states the sodium is 1200mg per serving. Other than the sodium in the salmon and the onion powder, and the salt, I don't know where the 1200mg is coming from. I didn't use salt. I cut the onion power by 1/4th. Made with roasted asparagus.

Loved it. I have never blackened salmon...the spiciness went really well with the tinder, sweet meat. I cut the recipe down to two servings and cooked in a cast iron skillet for a little less time because I wanted a more rare inside. The outside blackened nicely, but I did leave the skin on because it's just yummy! Thank you

This was a hit! My picky OH loved it.  I paired it with a combination of sweet potato and white potato seasoned and used the same salmon pan to saute zuchini in the left over flavor.  Added a little more seasoning after sauteeing zuchini  made a gravy with some left over homemade tomoato sauce, water and adjusted for taste and BAM!

No changes made to this! First off I don't like salmon. I make it for my wife and family and I'll go without if needed. 
I really thought the amount of cayenne was way out of wack but after tasting it, it was right on or could have used more without it being slightly hot. Wife is a big salmon fan has a new recipe that takes the place of all others. 
Note: When cooking (pan fried), I cooked for just a couple of minutes face down as directed with a lid on and did the same for the skin side for just a minute. Perfect! Still flakes with plenty of moisture. Skin peals off just fine.

First time I made this, I messed up with amount of cayenne pepper and it was unbearably spicey.  After that, every time it comes out absolutely delicious.  I leave the skin on the salmon and it gets super crunchy which we like.  Only adjustment was the amount of butter was reduced to 1/4 cup. 1/2 cup was too much.  We have salmon cooked this way at least 2 times/month.  I read some reviews about cooking on medium to low heat (for thicker slices) and would agree after initially putting it in the pan.  I have to remove and cover my smoke alarm or it gets set off each time from the amount of smoke this produces when cooked on high heat.

My husband and I really loved the  flavors and the heat in this recipe.  The only thing I would do differently would be to reduce the salt. We felt the salt was a bit overpowering.  I'll definitely make it again, but with less salt.

I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I left it out and it was great.  This really works well on salmon, chicken, and pork tenderloin.   I will be adding some cayenne into the mix in the future for those of us who like the heat.

It came out wonderful! The only downside was that it was too spicy for my personal taste. My suggestion would be to those who don't sit well with spicy food is to simply downsize on the amount of seasoning. In other words, stick only a little bit of the spice mix unto the salmon.

Great dish though! I accompanied it with a side of white and corn! Family loved it :-D

Great flavors. I might reduce the cayenne pepper a bit,  but everyone loved it! Will definitely make again.

I made this last week and it was a big hit.  I have saved the recipe so I can use it again and try it on other meats.

Flavorful and yummy, the air was somewhat hard to breathe with all of the spices in the skillet even with the vent on, ended up finishing in the oven but that's kind of par for the course when a dish is blackened :-)

LOVE this recipe! Delicious....I double the herbs and spices and store extra for the next time I make salmon.  Also, found that you don't need quite as much of the mixture as is called for in the recipe. And, if you use ghee instead of butter, it's Whole 30 compliant.

Yes, I’ve made this.  I put a different spin to mine.  I also put together a Mushroom Crawfish Cream Sauce (Secret to this sauce is Magic Swap Dust) and layered that onto the Salmon.  It left the family looking for more and wondering when I would be making it again.

I have made this twice, it is AWESOME!!  I do go lighter on the cayenne, and salt if I made as directed it would be too salty and way too spicy for my family.  Also one more thing, make sure your skillet is VERY hot to get the best effect.

One of my FAVORITE recipes! I was not a fish person at all until I tried this recipe. I added garlic powder to the seasoning (because I can’t help but add garlic in some way to everything) and used half of the amount of cayenne to make it less spicy (it’s just as good with the given amount). Awesome recipe!

This was an excellent recipe, I only mixed half the spices and did 6 (3.3 oz) fillets with EVOO instead of butter.  I also made a lemon juice, honey, yellow and deli mustard dressing to top a spring mix and baby spinach salad that I served the salmon on.  Everyone in my family LOVED this dish!

Awesome recipe! Totally worth it to remove the skin and get the seasoning on both sides of the Salmon. I didn't have any white pepper around but it turned out fantastic regardless.

Because the seasoning has so much flavor, I usually serve this over a bed of Quinoa. The Quinoa soaks up the delicious flavors and becomes a great and healthy accompaniment. Fantastic recipe.

This makes such an easy healthy meal.  WOW And all my "no thanks" to fish family will eat fish. Great simple easy. Who could ask for more? The spices are spot on and cooking times are excellent. I'm with the reviewer who said she's making it four times this week. I'm off to the store for more fish. Thanks Jeff Calkins for such a wonderful additional to our recipes.

This is the best thing I’ve ever put in my mouth. All the success of the meal was possible with the use of a cast iron pan. I highly suggest getting one if you don’t have one. I am certain recipe would not have tasted the same had I used a different pan.

Only used 1/2 Tbs of cayenne pepper, no white pepper and 1/2 of the black pepper and added 1 Tbs garlic powder.   Delicious.   I also used it to coat my shrimp.   Will do again and again.  Thanks.

My boyfriend loved it and was very impressed I of course tweaked it to make my own. But I love to look at recipes for a good foundation and tweak it to my preference. But this is definitely a very good one! He said it reminded him of Jamaican food lol which is one of his faves. I paired it with bow tie pasta with a Parmesan and mushroom cream sauce I make from scratch

It was a little boring and we undercooked one of the filets. That may have just been poor experience cooking fish on cast iron at high heat though.

I read other reviews and we prefer the skinless filets.  I brush the "top" side with butter and generously apply dry spice before flipping.   i also make extra spice mixture, and it lives in my spice cabinet.  This is a definite keeper!!

Wow, I made this twice in two weeks, as everyone loved it, I did not have any dry mustard, also added  some Italian seasoning, cumin, hot paper flakes, paprika, and some additional  chili  pepper. I made 5 batches of dry mix and added to an empty spice bottle. So next time I am all set with the blackened seasoning, so far I used on flounder and cooked in th e grill in a cast iron pan. It was great, fish was a little too thin, so I made it yesterday with salmon fillet portions and it was better. Everyone loved this, it’s a keeper

Absolutely fantastic! I did it in a cast iron pan and had some smoking issues. Next time I'll reduce the heat. I'd never made blackened salmon before but my daughter had it in a restaurant and wanted me to make it. She was delighted with the result.

Excellent! Used half of amount of cayene pepper based on other reviews.  Drizzled a bit of olive oil on fillets, sprinkled generous amount of spice mixture on one side, flipped after a few minutes on high, added more spice then a pat of butter on each fillet just before serving.  Delicious!

HOLY Salmon!!! Followed the recipe to a T and it was AMAZING!! My family and kids couldn’t get enough of it! I paired it with Jamie’s Cranberry Spinach Salad on allrecipes and it was the PERFECT combination of spice and sweetness!! For the salad, I always use blue cheese crumbles and cut the sugar down by ALOT and use avacado oil instead! A DEFINITE REPEAT!!!

Will definitely be making this again. Was so good.  The only changes I made was to cut the cayenne pepper to a half teaspoon and turned the heat down to medium and was still popping oil all over.

Ooo this was really good. I omitted the cayenne... I love it but my stomach just can't handle too much heat anymore sadly! The paprika was enough for a kick anyway. They cooked up perfectly. Thank you!

This recipe was spot on! Perfect blackened salmon! I've never been able to make it blackened without all of the seasoning sticking to the pan. The seasoning was just right, (for me anyway, my wife is a different story, who can't have ANY heat, but she wasn't home when I made it). I did cut back on the cayenne  by 1/4 tsp (for two servings), which was not necessary. I'm going to make up  more seasoning to keep on hand to try on different meats.

It was a bit to spicy for everyone... next time I make it I will cut the cayenne pepper, white and black pepper down significantly.  I really love smoked paprika and think with a little less of the other spices the paprika would really shine.

Used the rub in this recipe for the “Blackened Salmon Tacos” recipe (also allrecipes.com). The salmon was rubbed about 4 hours in advance (and refrigerated) then grilled on cast iron on the Weber BBQ. Cooked to 130 and let the salmon rest about 5 minutes before serving. What flavor!! Whether used for tacos, or just salmon filets, this recipe does not disappoint. Got rave reviews from the entire family.

This recipe would be great for a summer get together with guests, as most everything can be done in advance.

Just Awesome! Cooked the Salmon on a skillet on the backyard stove. I to, as mentioned from other reviews, also rubbed the salmon both sides with olive oil and sprinkled the skillet with seasoning then placed the salmon on top, then sprinkled the seasoning  on the top side. The salmon was complemented with the Spicy Baked Sweet Potato recipe also from AR. Awesome Chefs, another Great meal. Amend: Just did Catfish used the broiler like others mentioned for 13 minutes did not flip and let the crust just happen ...... Uhhmmmm Awesome!

I could only add 1/2 of the required cayenne pepper because I ran out, but it was perfect. I think it would have been too spicy for my taste if I actually was able to add the correct amount. Also, Thank you Nikki for advising to add the spices to the fillets one side at a time... very helpful! My wife, who dislikes  (cooked) salmon conceded, "You can make this again", which is a rave review from her. A big hit!

I made it last night with Pacific Rockfish instead of salmon.  I have used blackening (store bought) with Salmon and Steelhead many times before, I wanted to see if it would work well with rockfish (snapper).  It does.  I really love this spice mix and made more than called to store in a canning jar to use again in the future.   I echo the warning that the critic said, if you don't like real heat you might cut down on the cayenne.  This is proper cajun hot!

I was a little disappointed that the seasoning was so overpowering with cayenne that I couldn't taste my salmon at all. I basically wasted my money on an expensive fresh filet when a cheap filet would have served just as well. The salmon is really just a vehicle for the spice - why overspend? I appreciated Niiki's suggestion about cooking thicker cuts. She was spot on! Next time I'll definitely use less cayenne and sprinkle less seasoning on the salmon altogether (or just use my cheap frozen salmon cuts)! I made some cajun pasta alongside, and it was a fabulous complement!

Good recipe, but too salty and can cut down on the cayenne pepper by half. My husband and I felt like it really needed something so a squeeze of lemon really helped and brought out the flavours even more.

This was a quick and tasty recipe. I had all the spices in my spice cupboard except for white pepper so I doubled up on the black pepper. Because of the quick prep time I am adding this to my week night rotation!

Great recipe.  I finished it off in the oven, broiled 3min each side - per the suggestions.  It was perfect. I can't believe I made blackened salmon - at home! Its something that is very restaurant quality.  I will try this without the cayenne and pepper to have a mild version also.

Perrrrfect!  I think next time I might squeeze some fresh lemon. I followed what one memeber said and took the skin off the bottom of the salmon and seasoned and buttered one side at a time. Excellent! Will become my g to recipe.

This recipe is really terrific!  I have been searching for the perfect Blackened Seasoning thinking I could find it already made in a jar.  This self-made seasoning was so much better then all of them.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and cut back on the cayenne pepper.  Instead of 1 Tablespoon, I used 1 Teaspoon.  I thought if it wasn't hot enough, I'd add more next time.  I loved it just the way I made it.  I actually had some seasoning left-over and used it on chicken the following night.  Loved it on chicken, too!  Thank you for ending my perfect Blackened Seasoning search.  I think I've found it!!

Great recipe!. Instead of using 1 tablespoon of Cayenne pepper, we use 1 teaspoon.  We make 8X the amount and use it for several meals. We fry it in Avocado oil. Sometimes we put it in a tinfoil pan on the grill. It's always great.

Absolutely love this recipe with a alvacado-mango salsa with a little cilantro and jalapeño.   All my family loves it.  It will be eaten frequently at our house.  Am a 79 year old widower and the recipe is easy. Thank you!

This was a good recipe. My favorite for salmon at the moment. It provided a nice spice which works well for those of us who want to eat salmon because it is healthy but don't necessarily love the taste of it.

Made according to recipe. Cooked on cast iron griddle to accommodate more fillets, Buttered and seasoned second side prior to flipping (as a most helpful positive review mentioned). Stellar recipe. Will definitely mix this up with my other favorite salmon recipe.

An extreme Cajun Food and Spice an Extreme Heat yes there is not a Hot Chilie Sauce that has ever made me weep !!!

I encorage everyone to give the recipe a good try modifying the spice and fire levels  at will !

I had the pleasure of working in The Best Restaurants and the old Canadian Pacific Hotels and Resorts having opened two Five Star Canadian Resorts Whistler and Mount Tremblant  !  As well as The Very Pivate Canadian Club at Expo 1986 in Vancouver !   With Gold Winning Chefs from the Culinary Olympiques in the late 80's and early 90's til poor health ended my career.... that has lasted til now.   

Never did I loose the desire and love of entertaining and cooking for friends and my Medical Angels all as well.

We have used a variants of this recipe adjusting certain herbs and afore mentioned Heat Levels.

Bonne Cuisine tout le Monde d'All Recipies

This was an amazing base recipe for me. Everyone loved it, even the spice-picky. I reduced the red pepper for less intensity and increased some of the green herbs. I also used sage instead of oregano as I didn't have the latter. I reduced the butter as it was over-kill; I only needed a tbsp per dinner plate sized fillet. I also baked my fillets at 350F for about 20-25 min. on foil but uncovered. I can't say how the true, original recipe is but my improvised version was excellent. I served it with rice and sautéed zucchini.

Fantastic! I cut the salt to 1 tsp and the butter to 2 Tblsp. I only used about 1 Tblsp of the spice mix for 1 lb of salmon.  This is hot and spicy, not for wimpy tastebuds, but sooo tasty. It is the recipe I have been waiting for!

First, a confession...I don't eat seafood. Just don't like it. So poor DH is pretty much stuck with whatever pork, beef or chicken I'm cooking. That said I stopped at the store on the way home tonight and grabbed him a Salmon filet and was wondering what I was going to do with it and came across this recipe. 
I followed the recipe as directed with only a change in cooking method. I wrapped in aluminum foil and put in oven at 375 for 22 minutes then let rest. I'm going to guess DH LOVED it. Cause he was only going to eat half and save the other for lunch tomorrow, but ate the 2nd half then took a spoon to the foil packet and ended up licking the remaining butter and seasoning off the foil!  Last time he did something like that it must be more than 5 years ago with my pork Marsala.  I did have some left over seasoning so I will keep for next time....and there will definitely be a next time. Thanks for the recipe!
BTW - DH is a big fan of Cajun and of heat in general. He thought it was  the perfect amount of spice.

it tasted great but it was a spicy. If you don't like a lot of spice leave out the Cayanne pepper .  I made it a second time with a large pinch of   Cayanne pepper and it was still a little spicy.

When my family says "That was delicious, can we have this again?" that recipe becomes one of my go-to recipes! This is so good and so easy to make  you've got to try it for yourself. I double  the seasoning part of the recipe just to make sure I have enough, if there's any seasoning left-over you can save it with your other spices for your next recipe. I've already made this  twice in the last week, Yummiest!

Thought the spice was a bit overwhelming but I may have used too much on each piece of salmon. Loved the fact that it was okay to actually "burn" something!! Will definitely make this again!

I made this for my family and the combination of seasonings taste AWESOME!! I did not drizzle it with butter as noted on the recipe, I lightly coated the salmon with canola oil and seared it in butter while cooking... TOTALLY DELICIOUS! You and your family will be pleased and will ask for a repeat! Hubby wants to put this on the smoker next time  which will make this even better! Next time I'll try this with shrimp!

Thanks for submitting!

I have only recently started eating Salmon. This is easy to make and very tasty. I have made it several times and like to use a cast iron pan when cooking it. Looking forward to trying several side dishes with this recipe.

This was Great recipe it is a little on the spicy side but I'm ok with that, the only suggestion I'll make is that it was slightly salty for me so in the future I'll add  the salt after I prepare it.

We have been making this recipe for 15 years.  My son first discovered it when he was 10 years old in a class at school.  He learned to make it long before he learned to boil water.  I do just one side of the fish when we don't want it too spicy or blackened.  There is never a day that we don't have the spice mix in the pantry.  It's great on shrimp too.   Keep it going.  Many thanks!

Loved it, brushed the salmon with EVO instead of butter. The only change I made was cutting the cayenne pepper down to about a good teaspoon, can't imagine using 2 tblspns, that would be ridiculously hot. Great seasoning blend, will use it for more things than just salmon.

I changed up very little of the salmon recipe but I did switch out the onion powder for garlic powder and I left out the white pepper because I didn't have any.  I also used salmon steaks instead of fillets.  This was tasty and had quite the punch (like any blackened cooked item should be) to the taste buds and was enjoyed by all.  My husband said it was a tad too spicy though so next time I may cut the cayenne a little.  I also think I may have laid it on a bit much too.  I used a lot of the seasoning mix. 
Big warning though!!!  It had been years since I have blackened anything and upon cooking we all got a big shock.  I had not done it in my current kitchen that has little to no ventilation and well.... with blackening you NEED ventilation!!!  Windows open.  Fans blowing.  Whatever! You neeeeeed it and lots of it!  Myself and poor family coughed for hours after we ate because the seasonings just take over the air you breathe, hence blackening.  BUT on another note, I am a huge fan of blackening, fish especially and I cannot wait until I have a well ventilated kitchen to give this another shot.  
Served this with Caesar salad, fresh raspberries and fresh blueberries.  All of which helped calm the spicy. :)

I have now  used this combination of spices on salmon and chicken. Since we have these two entrees quite often in my home it's nice to spice it up once in a while. This recipe is now one of my favorites.

This was a hit.  I modified the recipe.  We halved the entire seasoning and seasoned only 1 side of the salmon filets and left the skin on.  We coated the fillets with olive oil instead of butter.  We seared the fillets flesh side down on a cast iron skillet for a few minutes on med-high heat, then flipped to the skin side for a 1 minute and then baked in the oven on 300 degrees for 10 mins.  They came out perfect.  Excellent flavor.  We did reduce the cayenne pepper (halved it) and it was still full of flavor.  I added butter to my filet at the end, and the wife had hers without butter.  We both found it perfect.

This recipe was amazing! My family fell in love with it. I didn't use salmon though. I used red fish instead, a much better choice. I did add more cayenne pepper. I will definitely make it again.

We loved it!  I may have used a smaller amount of salmon, but I ended up with spice mix leftover.  Stored it in a jar for an easy dinner next time.  Think I might actually mix up a jar-full of the spice mix so dinner is as easy as melting the butter and shaking on the spice!

HOLY HADES!!! This is hot. I didn't even use all the paprika or cayenne pepper that the recipe asked for. However with that being said, it was STILL delicious. I will make it again but without the white pepper and less cayenne.

Easy weeknight, family recipe.  Spouse and our 3 teens polished it off.   
Changes I made to allow 1) the high heat without burning spices and butter, and 2) the salmon and more subtle spices to come through:
used half olive oil and half butter;
cut amount of fat to 5-6 tablespoons from 8 T;
cut cayenne in half;
skipped white pepper (didn't have any on hand);  and
squeezed a wedge of lemon on each fillet.  

Also had thick fillets that needed added time, so flipped them on sides for a minute each.  Held together well.  

Next time will:
try garlic powder as sub for onion powder;
start in skillet and finish in 500 degree oven if fillets are thick; and keep skin on (easy to remove once fish is cooking).  

Thanks for the delicious, quick recipe !

Enjoyed this! I used all the listed ingredients except for the white pepper which I did not have, and I substituted olive oil for the butter. Following other reviewers suggestions, instead of frying the salmon, I broiled one side for 5 minutes, then baked it at 350 degrees for 20 minutes on the other side. I finished with a sprinkle of lemon juice over the top.

This is our favorite seasoning. The husband loves it so much he asks to keep a jar of the pre-made seasoning in the cupboard for whenever we have fish. I prefer to use it on fish that was previously frozen because it helps take away the fishy taste

I love this seasoning. I make it few times a month. I have also added brown sugar sometimes especially with sockeye salmon which tends to get dry. 
Used the seasoning with other fish and shrimp too

Excellent recipe. I don't like fish much, esp. salmon, so thought this recipe might disguise it enough that I could eat it. Yes, and family liked it too. I cut  cayenne in half also, and baked uncovered at 350 for 14 min. then 475 for another 7 min. ( 9x12 of 1" thick pieces.) served on bed of fresh spinach with pear and gorgonzola dressing sprinkled with parmesan cheese. delish...

I made it and put a maple glaze on it. Put it on top of a crab cake that was topped with pico de gallo.

Used olive oil instead of butter, 1/2 tbsp medium red chile powder instead of 1 tbsp cayenne pepper because that's what I had.  It came out just right.

This recipe is great but only if u like spicy food. I'm not particularly fond of spicy foods so I will be using less cayenne pepper next time and less salt.

I made this with fresh caught king salmon, and it was fabulous! My husband raved that it was the best salmon he's ever had - better than any restaurant even. I will definitely make this again!

Just what I wanted. Like many other reviewers I too subbed olive oil for butter which I used only a small amount. I also subbed Italian seasoning for the oregano and basil since it was what I had on hand. I thought it was just a touch salty and will only add a pinch next time but overall a really great recipe! Will make again and again!

This was really good but really hot!  I reduced the cayenne by half and it was still really spicy - I will try 1 teaspoon next time.  Definitely will make again.  I pan fried then finished in the oven.  Worked great.

My husband loved this. I only added about 1/2 of the cayenne, and he said it was perfect. I used Sockeye salmon, but I am guessing its just as good with the farm raised. My neighbor gave me a hint - if you lay the fish on a hot non-stick skillet for just a few seconds, the skin will peel right off.   :-) I made mine with the skin on and he ate it right off the skin. But I may remove it next time, just for fun.

On my second batch so I love it. Have made two more recipes for my Mom and a friend.  They also love it. Really pumps up flavor of salmon and shrimp.  Makes a great hostess gift.

This is a fantastic blackening rub mixture.  I triple it in order to have some ready anytime.  I made a few changes just for personal preference:  I added garlic powder (I add garlic to almost everything! :) and a little less cayenne. I also use either EVO or avocado oil in lieu of the butter.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe! Follow-up:  I make this often and every time my husband tells me how great the meal is.

Yum! It is too hot here in Texas to grill outside so I pulled out the George Foreman. I did use less Cayenne. Really quick, tasty meal!

I used this on salmon and tuna steaks. So delicious! I added garlic powder to this recipe (the same amount as the onion powder). As do others, I also brush with olive oil instead of butter and only spice the side I'm about to blackened. I've kept the used mix in a tupperware bowl. It's nice having it already made. This is a cut off tuna steak I just did. Must try! This recipe is nice and spicy!

Read reviews, know hubby doesn't like really spicy food so halved the cayenne. Added a good teaspoon of garlic powder. Had 2 oz fillets with skin, sprinkled half seasoning on them ( saved the other half). Put a couple of small pats of butter on each fillet and baked in foil lined pan 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Really good, served with macaroni salad and peas. Really good! 4 stars because didn't want to mess my stove top with the pan searing!

I just made it and it will be THE recipe I use when I want to cook salmon (except when I make glazed salmon). The only things I did different was omit the cayenne pepper, and replace the 1/2 tsp of white pepper with black pepper (making it a total of 1 tsp of black pepper)

EDIT: BTW even with omitting the cayenne pepper, it is still pretty hot.

I always order the blackened dish when dining out and this definitely beats any dish I have ever tried! - did I mention that I don't even eat fish?! ...

WE LOVED THIS!!  We used a minimal amount of olive oil instead of butter, added some garlic powder to the spice mixture (2 tsp.), substituted Sweet Hungarian Paprika for regular paprika, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The salmon we had was pretty thick and it was skinless.  Cooked it on medium-high heat in a hot cast iron pan lightly coated with some canola oil, until the deepest part read 125 degrees (medium-rare) about 2 and a half - 3 minutes a side. I hate overcooked salmon and that was perfect! It was so tender and silky.  It was 2 1/2 lbs. and it was devoured by 3 of us!  

Just know that if you cook this indoors especially on stove top, it will smoke up your house, be prepared!  If you are cooking the  fillets in batches, make sure you carefully wipe the pan out with a couple thick paper towels, between fillets, because although it's "blackened" salmon, you don't want the previous blackened spices etc. for the next fillet. Just add the bare minimum canola oil to barely cover the bottom of the pan in between batches (after wiping the pan out), making sure you move each side a little in the pan to keep it from sticking.  Although we lightly coated the fillets with extra virgin olive oil, we used canola oil in the pan it has a much higher smoke point, it just didn't seem right to coat the fillets with anything other than olive oil. I will most definitely be making this again! 

Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

My husband couldn't get over how great our salmon tasted with this recipe! FIVE STARS, even though I used 1 teaspoon of cayenne, which is a lot for me! I don't think that much butter is needed, and I might cut that back a little next time... However, this recipe is absolutely delicious!!

My husband was looking for something new to do with salmon and this recipe was just the thing. We cut the cayenne pepper in half and grilled it instead of pan searing. It was easy to adjust the amount of seasoning sprinkled on top to suit everyone's level of taste. Served with a wild rice pilaf.

I love everything about this recipe! I followed it exactly except used olive oil instead of butter. I also excluded the salt completely. The salmon cooked perfectly just by searing, no broiling or baking needed. I also doubled the spice mixture and saved it to use for later and other recipes.

This Salmon Was So Good. I Had Been On A Search For A Fish Recipe That My Kid Would Actually Eat. FOUND IT! My Husband and Kids Both Loved This Recipe. I Made No Changes At All. I Also Tried This Recipe With Talapia Since That Was All I Had and It Was Delicious As Well.

Great recipe. I used coconut oil in lieu of butter as a good healthy alternative. Cooked the veggies with coconut oil and pineapple, good complements to the spice.

FIVE STARS!!!! This recipe was great.  I used a little less cayenne as other users suggested and cooked this outside  on the grill about 5-7 minutes each side. My husband told me this is the best meal I have ever cooked him!! Will definitely be saving this one in the recipe box.

The rub was fantastic!  I cut back on the cayenne (about 2 teaspoons) and used canola oil (because I tend to burn olive oil) instead of butter and my picky husband who likes spicy food was pleased with it.

This was really good. I did as others said and reduced the cayenne as it was for me and my kids. I like mine pretty cooked, so I put it in the oven for about 10 minutes after blackening and it was perfect.

Way too spicy for my tastes even with a third of the cayenne that the recipe called for. I might try it again with either way less or no cayenne.

PERFECT SALMON EVERY TIME! GREAT FLAVOR AND SUPPER SIMPLE AND FAST. YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH THIS ONE. I HOWEVER DID CUT THE CAYENNE IN HALF AND DID TRY ONE FULL FLAVORED. MY MAN LOVED THE FULL FLAVORED JUST AS MUCH.

This is my new absolutely favourite way to make salmon!! As other users did, I only coated one side of the salmon with the spices before putting it in the pan and finished the top side while it was cooking. I LOVE that because the spices are dry, I can make up a big container to have ready on hand when I need it. I'm almost tempted to make it two nights in a row!

Very good and surprisingly easy.  But if you've got anyone in your group that doesn't like their food very spicy, might want to use less cayenne and more paprika. I'm going to have to play with the spice ratios in the future when I make this because I have some people in my group that like mildly spicy food and this was well out of their league.

We liked it but next time I will use alot less cayenne pepper and substitute olive oil for the butter. The recipe is easy to follow and is great for a week night dinner because it is ready in less than 20 minutes. I will definitely make this again.

The spice rub for this dish is amazing! The only thing I would change is reducing the cayenne pepper. I could handle the heat, but it may be a little much for others (my nose was running after eating). Other than that, this dish is a go! :)

This was my first time making salmon and tried out this recipe tonight.  Food turned out great, I only changed a few things after making the first two fillets.  I the heat from high medium and spread butter in the pan before I laid the salmon in.  Also sprinkled a little bit of lemon juice on top as they cooked in pan.  I used salmon that still had and ate it with chipotle ranch sauce.

I don't know many ways to cook fish but this recipe was so good and has certainly become a favorite. I like spicy foods but the cayenne in this one was a little much for me so I backed off the cayenne a little and it was perfect.

Excellent recipe. Placed cast iron skillet on the outdoor gas grill.  Set grill on high heat and grilled each side of Salmon for approx 5 mins.  Removed salmon when I saw the white milky coming out and when I pressed on edge of salmon, it started to flake.  Salmon came out perfect. I modified above recipe by eliminating the salt, and switching the butter with olive oil.   Will be using this recipe regularly.

I used olive oil instead of butter and cooked on the grill using one of those non-stick grill toppers that prevent food from falling through the grates. Wanted to make sure it would not stick and so I also sprayed non-stick cooking spray on the grill topper. This turned out absolutely delicious!!! The seasoning was so good. It's not too salty so you can pack on the seasoning. The outside was perfectly blackened and crisp, while the inside was perfectly moist and flaky. I wasn't sure about the timing so I had to check the inside a few times to make sure it was cooked all the way...it turned out perfect. My 11 year old and 13 yr old even LOVED it. This was 5-star restaurant quality for sure! Can't wait to make it again.

Great taste. I left out the cayenne pepper but added additional black pepper. Not a huge fan of HOT food. Son generally does not like fish a whole bunch but could not get enough of this and I am not generally a salmon fan but this was great. Going to try this rub on other fish.

Very Important! 
Reduce cooking temp to Medium-Low
Use 1/2 cayenne as suggested by other readers
I caused my entire family to vacate house as it was so smoky.
But I love Salmon and will definitely make again!

Love this recipe! I totally skip the frying pan part and just put it straight in the oven so no need to use butter just cover it with the seasoning and bake it ...all my company I have made this for want the recipe after so to me that's a compliment! The one thing I do change is use only 1 tsp of salt we loveour salt but would find 2 tsps just too much I have noticed in other reviews people do the same thing.

I made this for a party and it was devoured.
The only change I made was putting half the
cayenne in the recipe.  Very easy and tasty.

Didn't have onion powder so used garlic instead as another reviewer suggested.  I was worried it would be too spicy because of the amount of cayenne, but I just put less spice on my salmon and more on my husbands and we both loved it.  Will definitely make again.

Way too spicy! Also, very smokey.  Better to blacken it in an oven safe frying pan on the stove, then finish it up in the oven.

I love spicy food and in this case this recipe really gave the salmon the extra kick it needed. I struggle with salmon being too fishy sometimes but it is so good for you that I keep trying to find ways to incorporate it into dinner. This was perfect! I used leftovers in a salad - yum!

The flavor of this was great but I would never use so much cayenne pepper again. It was brutally hot.

excellent recipe...I used olive oil, added a bit of garlic powder and brolied the skin side of the salmon for a crunchy texture.  Next time i  will cut down a bit on the paprika and cayenne pepper, and add a bit more black pepper.  very nice flavor!

Fabulous!  We aren't much on salt so while it was juts fine, if you're used to cutting back on salt, you might want to.  Oh, and we used smoked salt.  So yummy.

All I have to say is WOW! I have never understood how restaurants get that crispy blackened layer on their fish and chicken, but now I know. I made this recipe for my family and they all went crazy over it. I didn't have onion powder or white pepper, but it was great without it. I will be making this at least a couple times a month. Thanks!

i tried this recipe tonight, i substituted spring onions, diced, as i didn’t have onion powder. I also was running low on paprika so my recipe really needed another couple of teaspoons. I finished with some fresh lemon. Tasted great, just needed a bit more paprika and i reckon we’re there. Great combination of spices

this came out pretty good.. uber peppery! i was worried about the salt content so i halved it but felt i could have used the whole amount.. bf said it was perfect.. didn't have white pepper so i doubled the black pepper.. didn't have onion powder so used garlic powder instead.. left out the thyme as i don't care too much for it.. didn't use the butter.. just pressed the salmon into the rub and grilled it like that.. would like to make it again with the full amount of salt.. ty for the recipe

Made this last night for the family and they loved it!  My mother said that it was the best thing that she has ever eaten at my house and even my husband had no complaints.  The only feedback that I would have is that it was a little saltier than I usually eat (I use very little salt in my cooking and diet) and my fussy 13 year old said that it was too spicy.  This dish might be accented well with some kind of chutney.

absolutely delicious. I had a large fillet of salmon and cooked it all up. My husband and I were fighting over the leftovers!! If you like it spicier, add more cayenne, because I didn't find this spicy at all, but it was perfect! Definitely added to the repitroire.

My fillets came out fabulously the first time out (if I discount the fact that I went crazy on the seasonings). I had to make more than I had originally planned because I kept eating it as I was cooking. Kind of hard to put blackened salmon on your caesar salad when you eat it straight from the skillet. All I can say is mmmmm.

it was ok. i guess i'm not a huge fan of cajun-style but i never really had any before so decided to try this since the ratinigs were so great. i broiled mine and it was nice and moist, and i sued the Spray instead of so much butter/olive oil. the spices didn't really wow me or anything, did give it a nice color though. probably won't make this again.

This was really good; my husband did it in an iron skillet on the grill. The only thing is, no one told me it would be sooooo hot!!! Maybe because he put so much rub on, I don't know, but it was barely edible for me (I'm a wimp). But we do plan to replace the cayenne and try something else next time, because the salmon was cooked to perfection, and my husband LOVED it (of course, he eats hot peppers as snacks). With changes, I think it will be a definite keeper.

Always looking for good salmon recipes... this is definitely one of them!! Didn't have any cayenne pepper on hand so used red pepper flakes instead. Instead of 2 tsp salt, used 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp seasoned salt. Didn't have thyme so left it out. Used about half the butter called for, and cooked the fillets in olive oil while rubbing just a little of the butter over them to try to make it a bit more healthy.   The spices tasted great on the salmon and the fillets were cooked fairly well exactly as the recipe stated. Might try broiling next time to see if that keeps the salmon a bit more moist as some other users suggested.   After cooking the salmon in the skillet, I poured the leftover butter/oil/spice mixture in with some cooked broccoli and served over a bed of rice. I doubled the spices mixture to flavor the rice, but the rice was WAY too spicy hot to eat! Will cut it down next time - my own fault, not the recipe's. Overall, this was a great recipe - boyfriend even said it was the best salmon I've made yet, and with a little more tweaking I know it can get even better! Thanks for sharing!

I enjoyed this salmon recipe.  I cut the salt to one teaspoon, as two would have been too much for my taste.  I brushed my one pound fillet with one tbs. of unsalted butter before coating.  Like other reviewers, I broiled it for 5 mins. and then finished it at 350 for 10 min.  It was perfect!

Very good...nice kick to the rub.  We love salmon and are always looking for variations to prepare it.  I make this recipe almost every time I cook salmon.  I do cut the salt in half for my taste.

This tasted so good, even my picky children loved it. I wasn't sure about using the whole amount of cayenne pepper, but i took a chance and followed your recipe exactly, and it turned out wonderful, not too hot at all. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for sharing.

I really enjoyed this.   Great option for salmon.   I did skip the thyme, personally.

This is very very very good. I mixed all the seasoning in a small tupperwear bowl and just used as much as I needed for 1 salmon. I didn't use butter just pam spray and it came out just great, very black and yummy. Just like Meemaw used to make back home!!

It was very spicy, and made a good crust that had a nice texture, but it wasn't a favorite at my house.

Made this exactly as stated (just scaled down for only 1 fillet).  So easy and so good!  I cooked on medium-low heat with a lid to reduce the smoke.  I was worried the salmon wouldn't taste that great no matter what I put on it because it's hard to find good fish here in Utah but the seasoning combination in this made so-so fish take fabulous!  Will definitely be making this again!

I loved this spice mix....the first time I tried it I COATED the Salmon and it was too spicy. Then I tried it again and lightly coated and it was amazing! I made extra and stored it in a spice jar with all my other spices.

Very delicious. Couldn't find the white pepper; however they still turned out great. May try garlic powder next time in place of the white pepper for just a little more flavor.

Seasoning for this is awesome. I also use it now on mahi mahi for fish tacos. It does get VERY VERY smoky, especially if you over season the fish. AWESOME Recipe!!!

Great recipe! Loved the easiness behind it, and used nothing except a bunch of spices that are fairly common to have on hand! The only change I made, and only because I was out of onion powder, was I used onion salt instead. I also only had salted butter (vs the unsalted) so by using these 2 "salts" I omitted the additional salt to the seasoning mix. EXCELLENT! Cooked about 3 minutes per side. Will make again for sure!! Thanks!

I'm an Alaskan girl and take it from me we know our salmon!  And this is, without a doubt, the best blackened recipe I've found.  It's defintely best if done on a grill outside with the cast iron skillet.  I also use garlic butter or flavored olive oil for a little more zip.  It is also perfect for halibut.  I serve mine on top of white rice w/teriyaki sauce -- the sweetness is a great contrast to the heat of blackened seasoning!

I could not believe how delicious this recipe turned out. I've never made anything blackened before, and have made mediocre salmon in the past. This recipe is out of this world. Crisp and strong but not over-powering to off-set the strength of the salmon. I was out of onion powder and substituted garlic powder instead. Served this with corn on the cob and a glass of riesling. Mm mmm. ~r.

Great recipe!  I followed the exact recipe and had plenty of seasoning for 3 salmon fillets and 3 chicken breasts, plus we had a lot leftover.  We put both the salmon and the chicken on the grill and both came out perfect.  We will use this recipe again!

I'm not a true seafood person. However, I fell in love with this recipe. It's seasoned really well and is a very quick meal. My 3 yr old even loves it. I just keep out the cayenne pepper for her portion.

This was great with salmon and a side salad with homemade lemon dill yogurt dressing. Yum! I might cut back the salt to 1 tsp next time. I followed one suggestion to rub oil on the fillets instead of the melted butter. I used 1/2 oil, 1/2 butter in the frying pan. I only did 2 fillets, so I had some seasoning mix left over. I added about 2 tsps of the seasoning mix to some cubed leftover boiled potatoes, tossed everything to coat the potatoes and fried them. Excellent spicy hashbrowns! This spice mix would probably be really good on oven fries as well. Just adjust the chili powder amount to suit your heat tolerance.

I liked the flavor of the seasoning, however I thought it was a bit salty. Perhaps if I lessened the salt, I would like it even more.

Lots of heat, but really great flavor! Used olive oil instead of butter.

This recipe is delicious!  I have made it two ways, once with the butter it calls for and once with extra virgin olive oil, and both are equally yummy.  With some fresh lemon juice at the end, this makes a great entree!

Great recipe! I use these spices for Blackened Shrimp 'n Grits too! My husband loves this. I also omit the butter and just use a non-stick pan with a small amount of Saffron oil. Simply delicious and couldn't be easier.

This is very good.  I added cajun spice just to get it a little more spicier. Good and easy to do.

This salmon is so good.  I didn't have onion powder, so I used garlic powder.  I broiled it for 5 minutes on both sides and then baked it for about another 15 minutes on 350.  It turned out so good.  I did cut back on the cayenne pepper because I didn't want it to be to spicy.  My husband loved it.  This is the only way I will make my salmon from now on.  Thanks.

I am always looking for a new salmon recipe to spice things up, and this recipe definitely fit the bill. It was good, but it wasn't amazing. Try it if you are looking for something new, but don't expect anything out of this world.

Very easy and very tasty.  A bit on the spicy side for me but my husband thought it was fabulous.  Maybe a little less cayenne pepper next time.

We liked this recipe, but it was a little too spicy and oily for our taste. I would make it again, but cut back a little on the heat and butter. It did have a good flavor.

This was pretty good.  I only used ½ of the cayenne pepper called for, but I think it would have been fine with the total amount.  I used olive oil and added a pat of butter at the end. I cooked in a pan on the stove top over medium low heat (no smoke involved) 7 minutes per side.  It looked really yummy and the salmon was cooked perfect.

I'm being generous with my rating - this was really about a 2 for me, but I hate salmon. I was hoping this recipe could change that for me, but it couldn't! It was edible, which is more than I can usually say, and I'm rating it a 4 since I think this is probably as good as salmon can get. We upped the cayenne pepper to 2 T, added chili powder and garlic powder, and brushed the fillets with olive oil instead of butter. We then used a grill pan, with melted butter. The fillets were somewhat thick, so we broke them into quarters, and they cooked fine. Served with the rice portion of the Spanish Rice & Chicken dish from this site, which made it bearable.

Wow, I really smoked up the house making this and my hubby coughing, said, "this better be some really good fish!"

It was and next time I make it I will make some changes that I think will make it even better.  1) open the windows and put a fan on (not just the stove fan) 2) use less salt, and 3) cook for a shorter time.

Im new to both eating and cooking Salmon and this was quite good!  I followed suggestions and turned the heat down to medium as soon as I put the fish on the pan, cooking one side for 5 minutes and the other for 7, next time I'll do 7 minutes for each side.  The only problem I had is that I made sure to cover the whole fish in seasonings...hella hot!!  It was still tolerable but next time I'll use much less!

I used cod fillets for this recipe and they came out pretty good. I ate them on my salad for lunch the next day. yum.  I think next time I will rinse the fish under warm water as the butter coagulated when I brushed the fish. And I would use less cayenne pepper/salt, as my 4 year old and fiance could not eat this dish. I also had plenty of season mix left, so maybe i will cut that part by a 1/3 next time.

Too spicy.  And whatever is in the spices really gets in the air when you're cooking it: my husband and I could not stop coughing anytime we went in the kitchen!  And I had the vent going full-blast!  No thanks.

Quick, simple & very tasty. The only change I made was brushing the fillets with extra virgin olive oil, although I did use a couple of teaspoons of butter on the skillet.
Under high heat two minutes per side was plenty.

Hubby and I had this last night (and today for lunch). He cooked it on the grill. The only change I made was to cut the salt as some had suggested but I think it would have been better as written. We may sub olive oil for the butter next time to make it more healthy but all in all it's very good. Hubby said it's a "have again".

This is the first time I've cooked with salmon and what a way to cook!
The spices were a nice mix and I added plenty of paprika and also garam masala.
I also used the advice that sometimes if the butter isnt applied properly that it crumbles. 
I brushed the salmon once with a light olive oil once before frying salmon on both sides in a frying pan for about 3 or so minutes.
I then used the oven for the rest of the cooking time which works out to be about 10 to 15 depending on the temp and the thickness off the fillets.
They turned out beautifully and the meat just fell away.
My partner absolutely loved it,
I cooked with rice and also a tangy mango bbq sauce.
Wonderful

Very good, had with lima beans and garlic bread. The fillets I used were on the small side so I wound up over-spicing them so they were super spicy. Next time I'd ease off a bit. Tasty though.

I think our salmon fillets were too small and the spices overwhelmed it. Even the smoke was way too spicy!! We were literally sweating by the end!! On a positive note, it certainly helped clear up my cold.

This was a big hit at my house.  I dont eat fish but my husband loved it.  Great seasoning.  Plan to try it out with boneless chicken next time for me so I can see just how great the taste is.

This is the absolute best salmon recipe that I have ever tried; it goes way beyond any restaurant I have ever tried! I use lots of the seasoning to make it extra spicy and it's perfect with a huge hunk of lemon as well. I make it at least once or twice a month!

Made this for dinner tonight.  My husband told me to make sure that I add this to the "I love that dish" recipe box we started when we got together.  He asked twice if there was more.

I don't know how it could get any better.  I have shared this recipe with others, and after fixing it they say they will never cook salmon any other way.  Absolutely Delicious!

This had really good flavor, but it was a little bit spicy for my taste. I think I will use half the amount of cayenne next time.

What a delicious way to spice up the fish!  I used Icelandic Char Fillets instead of salmon.  (Also called Artic Char).  It is in the salmon family but just a touch more oily (like trout).  It was a pleasant change from salmon.  The spices were not too spicey at all - - just enough "zing".  I pan fried in a combination of olive oil and butter to reduce the smoke.  5-6 minutes per side was perfect.  Don't be afraid to experiment with the spices - - anything goes!

This was really good, but SPRINKLE!  It's pretty spicy,  I had lots so I ROLLED it in the spice and it smoked up the kitchen so that we could hardly breathe! I was worried about how spicy it would be to eat because of that, but the flavor was great!  Delicious, it will make me eat more healthy fish :)  Thank you!

My husband thought this was the best fish recipe EVER!  He now wants to blacken all fish.  We made a sauce on the side with mayo, horseradish, lemon and diced tomato.  That part was a nice addition but the fish alone was outstanding!

The salmon in this recipe tastes just like the cajun salmon I love to order at one the local restaurants where I live!  Now I can make it at home for a whole lot less! I love it!!  The only change I made was that I broiled it on HI, instead of using a skillet!  YUM-O!!

This was just okay for me... the spices were good, the salmon was good, but together they were just kind of weird! Super easy though, and I used olive oil instead of butter and blackened them first and finished them in the oven... something was just off though.

This only took minutes to whip up and I now have a shaker full of the spice blend for regular cooking of this dish.  The first time I made it I did not add too much of the spice so I did not have the smoke problem like others did, but after making it again with more of the spice it did smoke.  It is worth the worry though- very tasty.

Mmmmm... my new favorite way to cook salmon (and we eat a LOT of salmon). I just leave the skin on the salmon when the fillets have already been prepared that way.

This was delicious.  My husband was crazy for it.  Tried it on chicken as well, but should have sprinkled it on instead of rolling it - my mouth was on fire with the chicken.  The salmon was gorgeous!

Very good recipe!  This was the first time I have ever fixed salmon or any fish for that matter and I was surprised at how good it turned out.  My husband absolutely loved it and I can't believe how fast he ate it then started working on half of mine! I cooked it on the indoor grill and it worked great!

Made this for my husband, but didn't get to taste it as was late for work.  He said it was great, and he is pretty picky about new dishes.

Excellent recipe.  I made it on the grill instead of on the stove top, but it was still excellent!

Very good...some reviewers suggested to cut the pepper and I did, but if you like it really spicy go exactly as the recipe specifies.  I enjoyed this salmon and will make again.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I am not a big fish fan but this turned out fantastic!!  To make it a little healthier I melted just 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter and brushed that on the fish to hold the spices, I then cooked it on my George Forman Grill.  I didn’t get a smoky house, but I did get a wonderful dinner!  Thanks so much!

This was a great and easy recipe.  It didn't take hardly anytime to make.  I don't care much for salmon, but with this recipe you didn't have that fish taste.  I tried the parkay fat free butter, and I didn't use that much on it.  I feel that might have made it not "smoke out the house."  I did use a little olive oil in the pan while cooking so it wouldn't burn as easily.  One review said use chilli powder and it did taste good with it also.  I recommend this recipe for people looking for a quick and great tasting salmon.

This recipe is awesome.The only change I made was to marinate the salmon in olive oil and lemon juice .( just a bit of lemon) for a few hours.I used my cast iron griddle and turned the heat up high........YUM !!Squeeze some lemon on top.

I was prepared for the smoke in the house- but I was dissappointed in how this recipe turned out. It may have been me though- the salmon burnt before it cooked fully on the inside. I had to put them in the microwave to cook the fish. My husband wasn't very impressed, but I think I may try this again just to be sure that it wasn't something that I did wrong.

Very quick, very easy! Smoked out the house, though.  I would use less of the cayenne and paprika next time. It turned out too spicy for me.  Also, tastes great with lime drizzled over it. I accompanied it with Mango Salsa on the side, and served with white rice.

Even though it was a little salty the first time, my husband and I still thought that this was an easy and excellent recipe. I've made it numerous times afterwards, but decreased the salt a little, added chilli powder, and doubled the pepper and paprika (we love it spicy).

This is the best salmon recipe I've ever tried, and really easy too. Usually, I eat serving of salmon and I'm all "salmoned out", but this time I thought I'd eat the whole fish!

Great recipe, came out really nicely.  Very smokey like everyone has said and is missing a little kick.  I might try playing around with the spices a little ... maybe a little more pepper ... but definitely a keeper!!
