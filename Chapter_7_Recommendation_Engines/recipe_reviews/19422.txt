This is a good base recipe but needs just a bit of tweeking.  1. Because I have a picky toddler I avoided the onions.  2. When making the sauce, add 1 cup of milk to your sauce pan and reserve 1/2 a cup cold milk to mix your dry ingredients in.  Mix the dry ingredients into the 1/2 cup cold milk and mix thoroughly--you will prevent lumps this way. Add the remaining 1/2 cup and stir.  I found it didn't thicken very well until I added the cheese.  I kept the cheese on the heat until the sauce thickened.  3. I recommend adding a second cheese.  I added romano but parmasean, monteray Jack or any other sharp cheese would  really enhance the flavour. 4.  I crushed up 2 crackers and put them on top, I sprayed a bit of olive oil onto them to allow for browning.  I also grated a bit of cheedar cheese onto the bread crumbs maybe 2-3 tbsp.

This is excellent, not your box mix at all.  However (isn't there always a however when you love to cook?) I agreed with the reviewer who said less or no breadcrumbs.  The second time I made it I left out the breadcrumbs and when I took it out of the oven I topped it with crumbled bacon and finely chopped green onions.  Oh wow!  My husband declared it "company fare".

This is exactly how my sister and I grew up with my mom's mac and cheese.  I added extra cheese and milk so that it was very creamy and cheesy.  Perfect!!

And yes, it is a bit grainy.  ALL homemade mac and cheese, made with REAL cheese will come out slightly grainy in the end.  If you want the smooth kind, then quit making REAL mac and cheese, go buy some velveeta and be happy with your processed version.

This is the same recipe I have been using for years, and I adore it.  I don't add the bread crumbs to it, and I prefer it that way.  The last time I made it I didn't have any dry mustard, and it definitely changed the flavor of it (made it more bland), so I really recommend that people not omit the dry mustard.

I have always used Martha Stewart's recipe for mac and cheese until I found this one.  Sorry Martha.  This is much better.  Before putting it in the oven I top with a cooked crumbled bacon.  YUM!  Other reviewers complained about the cheese sauce.  I think that it's important to use a very good quality of chedder cheese.  It makes all the difference in whether you have a creamy sauce or a lumpy sauce.

I have tried many mac and cheese recipes trying to find the right "cheesiness" and flavor. This, by far, is my favorite!!!  I added 1 cup of shredded colby cheese to the pasta (not the sauce) to make it extra cheesy.  Delicious!

My hubby and I enjoyed this version of mac and cheese.  I could have eaten it after adding the cheese sauce to the pasta and not baking. It would have been much creamier.  However, my husband liked it baked with the bread crumbs (I used less than called for) but he said that I should have mixed some fresh parmesan cheese with them as well...I will probably try that next time. I might also make more sauce for the amount of pasta...this also might help it stay creamy.  I didn't have any mustard so I used some garlic powder and smoked paprika (to taste).

Not sure what went wrong but mine came out very grainy.  It did have a nice flavor behind it but it did not get eaten because of the texture.  Any ideas?

I have made this dish many times and love it.  I like to use strong, white cheddar and top it off with finely crushed Ritz crackers and sliced tomatoes.  It makes a wonderful side dish or a main course for lunch.

This is it! This was the recipe I was looking for.  Left out the onion because I wasn't in the mood to chop one, but will try it next time; no dry mustard, used a squirt or two of dijon mustard.  Delicious! Wife went on and on about how good it is.  Will make it again for sure. Baked it in a 9X13 glass pan.

I love this recipe, so yummy! The first time I made it used Dijon mustard because I didn't have any dry mustard (mid cooking) and it was a hit! Since then I've made it with dry mustard and it's not quite the same. The dijon really adds an extra kick in taste you don't expect in mac n cheese.

I'm giving this only 3 stars, made exactly as directed, it is rather tasteless.  One mistake I made was not to add the salt.  I try to be careful when salting pasta and having cheese in the same dish.  If often comes out too salty for my taste.  For the reviewers who comment on the "grainy" texture.  This is because the roue is made only with 1 Tbsp of flour to 2 Tbsp of butter.  It is very liquidy, one shouldn't have to simmer it 10 minutes to thicken!  It does lose some of the liquid while baking.  Next time I will add the salt, 2 Tbsp butter for the roue, and just brown the top under the broiler - it is already hot enough from the pans.

Very good!  Seems that it had way more bread crumb topping than it needed, but that can always be adjusted.

I have made this exactly as directed & get many compliments.  I do like my own tweeks too; I use a high quality very sharp chedder cheese, tsp of regular spicy brown mustard or grey poupon (rather than the dried) & add a bit of regular Mrs. Dash to taste (in addition to salt & pepper).  I wisk the milk sauce rather than stir it to make it real smooth.  I lOVE the breadcrumbs on top, but my family doesn't so I put the crumbs over 1/2 of it for a delicious thick breadcrumb crust for me :-)

I try all my recipes with ricemilk & do not recommend using ricemilk for this one.  However, the ricemilk version was still SO MUCH better than storebought boxed stuff.  Also, this does seem to need a bit salt.  I tried without it, but found I  needed a little to taste as good (& I never cook with salt).

I would use another cup of milk and double the cheese.  Two cups of cheese isn't much at all.  This was very good, but a little dry, coming out of the oven.  I also just covered the whole thing with breadcrumbs- more than the recipe called for.  If you slice roma tomatoes up and put them on the outline of the pan, they are roasted and yummy with the mac and cheese when it comes out of the oven.  Great recipe!  Simple.

Very good recipe. I've made this recipe twice. The first time it came out grainy, the second time it was incredibly creamy and near perfect. I think it becomes grainy if you allow the butter to over cook/burn a little. So if you see it start to burn, START OVER!!! Only changes I made was to add a little more butter, less onion, evaporated milk and no bread crumbs. Will definately make again!!!

This is pretty good.  It seems like a lot of cheese sauce for a small amount of pasta, so I doubled the pasta.  I do have a trick for sauces that require long stirring - warm the milk to lukewarm in the microwave before adding.  Cuts down a little bit on the time to reach simmer, hence, less time spent stirring.

This was delicious and simple. I will definitely make this again. I took some of others suggestions, and I used very little breadcrumb. It was still great! My only issue with this recipe is that it dirties a lot of pans, so I tried to cut down by using a dutch oven. I boiled the pasta in that, then after I drained it, I started on making the cheese sauce in the same pan. Once that was done, I put the pasta back in the same pot, added the breadcrumbs and put that in the oven. It made this SO much easier when it came time to clean up.

Close to perfect.  Doubled recipe and used 16 oz. box of cavatappi.  Family loved it except I thought it called for too many bread crumbs, use only 1/2 at most.  Next time going to use 1/2 extra sharp/ 1/2 sharp cheddar and make 1/4 more of the cheese sauce.  Then I think it will turn out perfect.

I made this dish tonight and tweeked it just a bit.  I used 16oz of elbow pasta instead of 8oz but kept the same measurements for everything else.  I also added ground chorice, approx 1 cup.  I didnt have dry mustard so I used a couple of squrts of brown spicy mustard.  I also cut back the bread crumbs to 1/4 cup and blended a little mustard in with the butter and bread crumbs and then crumbled it over the top.  The recipe is a great base to add your own favorites to.....everyone loved it.

I doubled this recipe for a large family dinner plus added more cheese to the sauce.  It was a bit oniony at 1st but after adding a little more cheese (as much as you prefer) a splash more milk this turned out wonderful!  I also omitted the bread crumbs & topped with a small amount of freshly shredded cheese.  We LOVE it!!!  It was a huge hit & though it had a good bit of onion in it, no-one knew.  Haha!  That's good because I fed a bunch of picky, non-onion-eating folks!  I will most definitely make this again!

I left out the onion and used some onion powder instead. My husband liked it pretty well and I thought it was okay, but I did not care for the breadcrumbs. Next time I will use fewer or none at all.

Very good!  Simple and easy to modify to your liking...  I used small shells instead of macaroni.  Omitted the onion, added a little more flour for thickness and a little more mustard.  Doubled the cheese and used Fiesta Blend.  Topped with crushed Cheez-Its with butter, much less than what asked for, just a sprinkling.  It turns out thicker than creamier that way, but I love it and so did the kids!

This is a tasty dish worth adding to your repertoire of dinner menus. I prepared as stated, then added sliced, low fat turkey sausage. Voila! A one-dish meal. Next time I think I'll add some green onions also. Thank for the recipe.

This was great! After reading the other reviews, I made this adding some cream cheese and paprika to the sauce. Also added about 1/4 cup Pecorino Romano to pasta (not sauce), and green onions and bacon to bread crumb topping. This was easy & a big hit at a potluck!

I love this recipe, the only thing I changed was adding a spoonful of cream cheese to the melted cheese to make it more creamy.

it tasted ok but definitely not something i'm looking for, it doesn't have that much cheese flavor so adding a different kind of cheese might help out

I used Trader Joe's Brown Rice Penne and left off the breadcrumb topping to make it GF.  Also, held back some of the cheese to sprinkle on top during last 5 minutes of baking.  I loved the onions but my kids didn't so I think I'll leave them out next time.  I'm so glad I doubled the recipe because it's even better heated up the next day!

My husband and I enjoyed the original Mac and Cheese V recipe; however, we think there's room for improvement.  Personally, we'd like more than 2 cups of cheese next time, and we'll include Parmesan for it's saltiness.  Also, I recommend using whole milk for a thicker mac and cheese.  1/4 tsp dry mustard was not enough; we couldn't taste it at all.  So, next time I'll at least double it.  This recipe was a good starting point for homemade macaroni.

Delicious.  I used 2 1/4 cups dry macaroni and 2 cups of milk (and 2 generous tbsps flour), everything else was the same.  It was creamy, cheesy, savoury and delicious.  I served it with green and yellow beans sauteed in EVOO and garlic and it was gobbled down in silence by hubby and my 5 and 3 year old girls.  Spot on perfect mac and cheese.

Great recipe! I made mine a little more figure friendly by only adding 3/4 c of milk with 3/4 c of chicken stock. Also to make it a complete meal I added sliced smoked kielbasi.

I have made this twice and it is a hit at my house.  My husband loves it as well as my picky toddler.  I used some veggie pasta last time and it was still yummy.  I also  used a 4 blend cheese from Kraft that was really good.  It gave it a creamier taste than just the cheddar the recipe calls for.

I had such high hopes for this recipe based upon other reviews.  However, my entire family thought this mac and cheese was off.  I am not a novice cook and I followed the recipe.  We found it bland and quite dull, even using a high quality extra sharp cheese.

Loved it! I used Italian bread crumbs instead of the plain ones, which gave it a great little flavor.  Instead of dry mustard, I used plain yellow mustard.  Also, I used three different kinds of cheeses. The onions were a nice touch. I will definately be using this one in the future. :)

We had a bunch of people over for Sunday dinner today.  I made this Mac & Cheese and it was a huge hit.  The only change I made was gluten free penne and bread crumbs was substituted for the regular macaroni and bread crumbs.

Yum!  The onion and mustard gave it a great flavor (although neither of my kids would eat it).  I left the bread crumb topping off as others suggested.

Good, but does lack some flavor.. I have had it with and without the bread crumbs. I prefer it without consistency is more smooth and creamy. Great starter recipe though if you don't have a certain cheese you can add another one in its place and it still is good. I normally use pepper jack in it also and it is GREAT!

Pretty decent meal. I would recommend adding a little bit more mustard (like 1/2 tsp. instead of 1/4).  Also, we used half extra sharp and half mild cheddar, next time I'll use all extra sharp for added flavor.  Otherwise, a very good, easy, and quick meal to keep on hand.

Just put the milk, cheese, mustard, salt, pepper and flour (2 T) in a blender and blend until smooth.  Pour over macaroni and bake at 350 for 40 minutes.  1 cup of macaroni is dry (measure straight from the box - before boiling).  I leave out the onions and don't use the bread crumbs.

This recipe was pretty good.  I thought a whole onion was too much and added less than half, it was still too strong.  My little guy didn't like it much and he loves mac and cheese.  I used 1 1/2 cups colby jack cheese and another half cup of 3 cheese italian blend and parmesan that I had on hand.  I also did not have dry mustard and it didn't seem to affect the overall taste.  I will make this again but will omit the onions.

made this for father's day. it was a hit! I plan to make again this weekend for the 4th. I wasn't too sure about the onion but added it anyway and I'm soooo glad I did. what a wonderful taste and easy recipe. no grating for me though. I used about 36oz of pre-grated cheese. we are cheese lovers and it was great! thanks for a great recipe!

This is the same recipe that I have been using for a long time.  I actually add more dry mustard, about a teaspoon, and dont use any breadcrumbs.  Instead, I sprinkle mine with paprika before baking it.  I also really caramelize the onion to give it lots of flavor and I use a blend of a few cheeses.

It tastes great! Except I have always used ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. I just break up the crackers into crumbs but not totally crushing them, then put them on top and bake it. It's yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly.  The milk mixture never thickened up on the stove.  It only got thick once I added the cheese.  The cheese didn't melt into a smooth mixture and was stringy and incredibly grainy.  The bread crumbs were so overwhelming.  I  will never make it again.  At least when I make it out of the box I know I'll be happy with the results and won't have spent an hour making it.

My family loved this recipe! I didn't put any mustard in since I didn't have it on-hand, and I also skipped the breadcrumbs. Instead, I put more shredded cheese on top after baking and broiled it for about five minutes. I also put only half the amount of milk to make it very cheesy. Next time I will try it with sharp cheddar, as we like the strong flavor.

I wanted to find something like my grandmother's recipe: crispy on top, flavorful inside and more exciting than velveeta. This is it, great recipe. I've made it three times this month- by request. Extra sharp cheddar cheese makes it perfect.

my mom & grandma pride themselves on awesome baked mac & cheese, so i was really excited when my mom liked this recipe. it's gooooood.
next time i make this, i will mix up fewer breadcrumbs (i only used about a third) and use a bit more cheese.

Hey, my kids finally ate home baked Mac and Cheese! They actually had 2 helpings! I did used crushed cheese flavoured crakers for the bread crumbs though. It was really good!

Very good.  I increased to 20 servings and took to a wake.  This was the first dish to go, and received many compliments.  I added a little bit of ground red pepper for zing (just a dash or two).  
One quick observation about the 'dryness' comments - mine wasn't dry at all, but I DO wonder if the dryness resulted from mixing the breadcrumbs in with the noodles rather than layering on top.

This is my new favorite mac and cheese recipe. I noticed that another user rated it less than pleasing by saying that it was more like macaroni caserole. I would just like to say for the record that the first time I made it, it came out a little too bland, and I realized that this is because I used TOO many noodles. The second time I made it, it became my favorite. Like any good homemade recipie should be. If you don't like homemade "caserole like" mac and cheese, go buy craft. I will stick with this recipie! Thanks Melanie.

Great basic recipe. I increased the amount of milk to 2 cups, 3 tbsp of butter, 2 cups of sharp cheddar, and 1/2 cup of a 4-cheese blend. I also nixed the bread crumbs. It turned out awesome.

This is fantastic! Not at all like the unhealthy boxed macaroni and cheese. It tastes so much better and is a lot healthier. It has a wonderful flavor and takes little time to prepare.  It is a little grainy because of the breadcrumbs, but that's what makes it real mac & cheese!! Everyone in the family loves it and devours it.

I made this exactly as it said and it was edible but that was about it. My 1 yr old and 2yr old refused to eat it and my husband and i were able to eat some but not really enjoying it. would not recommend. Guess this just shows that peoples tastes can be sooo different.

We liked this well enough. For us, it needs double the cheese. Next time, I might use a sharp white cheddar but keep the amount the same as that could be where I went wrong as I only had a mild cheddar on hand.

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added some Parmesan to the breadcrumb mixture and seasoned the cheese sauce and the bread crumbs to taste.

i give this recipe three stars because it needs significant adjustments.  first and foremost, do NOT add the bread crumb topping.  i wish i had read the reviews prior to making this recipe.  i tasted the mac and cheese before i added the topping and it was amazing.  heavenly.  then i added the crumbs, and was sorely disappointed.  second, use sharp (old) cheddar.  i used medium, and it didn't have quite enough cheesy zing.  third, toss in a spoonful or two of cream cheese to make it a smoother texture.

I made this recipe exactly as described.  I loved the way the instructions were listed to execute in the most efficient way.  Very easy to follow.  As for the dish, it was way way to strong on the onion and had too much bread crumb topping.  I only used one half of a small/medium yellow onion and it still over powered the dish.  My kids did not like it at all.

This dish is so yummy! I change it a little and use 1 T. fresh mustard and instead of bread crumbs on top, i use about half a roll of ritz crackers and crush them up and add them to a half a stick of butter and then put on top! We make it all the time and all our kids LOVE it! Its the best!

This recipe is a good basic mac and cheese. I do find that it is kinna boring and calls for way too many bread crumbs on top. On the whole it was good enough to be finished.

This is a great recipe!  Just finished cooking it and eating as we speak.  I took some some of the reviewer's suggestions and sprinkled the top with bacon bits and then once it was baked, I also sprinkled thinly diced green onions over it.  Looks, smells, and taste delicious.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it...the only changes i made:  I added about 1/4 cup of sour cream to the cheese sauce  While baking, i poured in extra milk and stirred to keep it creamy   Also added 2 teaspoons of dry mustard.  I made this recipe 3 times and believe me the changes made a difference.

A super easy macaroni and cheese.  Honestly, I even skip the baking step...I just pour the hot cheese sauce over what ever kind of pasta I feel like making.  It's simple and I usually have all the ingredients on hand.

I didn't have dry mustard, so I skipped that ingredient. I also followed another reviewers recommendation to use 1/2 cup of Parmesan and 1 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar. I mis-judged the amount of salt needed, so mine needed more salt. It was a bit grainy, but tolerable. My husband liked it, but for one reason or another my picky 20 month old wouldn't try it (he's in that stage). I liked it too.

The flavor of this dish is fantastic! The best I have ever made or tasted. The only thing I changed after my first try with this mac & cheese was to eliminate the bread crumb topping. I was not big fan of that and the leftovers (I always make enough for leftovers) are much better without it. Also with the leftovers, I like to stir in a little fresh milk after I nuke it. And for those who want a little crunch, crush a few ritz crackers in your fist and sprinkle it over the hot mac & cheese.

Tastes awesome! I made it without the bread crumbs because I didn't have any. It's tasty, the right amount of gooey, and wasn't clumpy or grainy for me. :) Would make it again.

I was not too impressed with the way this turned out. Very bland and I agree with others that the bread crumbs were not a good addition to the dish and seemed to add to the blandness. I even added about 1/4 cup extra milk and an extra cup of cheese (used both sharp cheddar and mozzarella) in an effort to make the dish more moist and to make the sauce more a part of the dish as opposed to just flavoring. Alas, it didn't work. If I were to use this recipe again I think I would leave out the bread crumbs and add some tomatoes or ham.

I was looking for a mac and cheese recipe for which I had all of the ingredients...this one did the trick and turned out great without being too difficult. A good weekday recipe when you want something easy but with some real homemade goodness! Side note, the kids didn't love the breadcrumbs, you could top with more cheese to please them.

This was a good macaroni and cheese recipe.  I added about 1/2 cup of freshly grated parmesan to the cheese mixture.  And, I always add a little parmesan to the breadcrumbs for some added flavour.  Thanks!

Great recipe, but I used LOTS more cheese then the recipe called for. I like my mac and cheese CREAMY! I will never EVER buy Kraft again! Who needs it when this is such an easy recipe and it's so yummy! My hubby and son finished off the entire casserole dish in ONE SITTING!!!!

Great mac and cheese, went over well as a potluck item.  I cut back on the onions though

We really enjoy this. The first time I made it I didn't put in enough cheese, I don't think...but we still enjoyed the onion flavor. I added prepared mustard instead of powdered, and I did more of that the second time around too. My husband requested this again right after we had it! I Do about 1 1/2 times the recipe and we have some leftovers if it's a side dish. mmm.

I used a four cheese mix, and substituted half&half for the milk. It turned out really well, and even my picky husband who HATES macaroni loved it! This will definitely get made again.

This was pretty good. We didn't add the onions only because of our 5yr old. We used whole wheat pasta because that is all we use.

This was great! I left the breadcrumbs off the top, and I used 1/4 of an onion rather than a whole onion, which gave it a great flavor without being overpowering. Next time I'll try to mix some other cheeses in with the cheddar as some reviewers have suggested. I'll be adding this to my repertoire of regular dinners, thanks!

This was okay.  The only thing I changed was to use whole wheat macaroni instead of the regular.  It's a good base recipe.  I would probably use less crumbs another time and more cheese.  Edited 10/2 to upgrade to 4 stars because this is (to my surprise) now a favorite of my two elder boys (11 and 7).  I've made it again using half the crumbs (which I actually halve again and use parmesan as half) and an extra cup of cheese.

i thought this was great. i increased the cheese to approx 3 cups and i didnt shred it, just put it in the freezer to harden it up first, then cut it up in very tiny pieces, which melted nicely in the roux. i also added maybe 1/2 cup shredded (not grated) parmesan too to the roux. leftovers tasted great too!

Loved it! I used whole wheat penne and didn't have dry mustard, so I used yellow mustard from my fridge:) Otherwise, I followed the recipe. Fantastic!!!

This was very good. I used a little more cheese than was called for; I used sharp cheddar and added 1/2 cup of parmesan/romano mix. Next time I will use more butter with the bread crumbs also. But  it was very tasty and it went very fast.

I liked this recipe.  I made it without onion for personal preference and added more cheese, including parmesan to the sauce mixture.  I used evaporated milk for extra creaminess.  I'm not sure how I feel about the breadcrumbs...might try a different topping next time.

I made this recipe for my fiance last weekend and he LOVED it! I did as others suggested and topped with crushed Ritz crackers instead of the breadcrumbs. I also had a large box of macaroni and measured it out to 2 cups. Not sure if that is 8 ounces or not, but it was just enough macaroni for the cheese sauce. YUM!

I added more cheese because 2 cups just didn't look like enough.  Used ritz crackers for the topping.  Everyone liked it and had seconds.

I was looking for a simple, old fashion mac and cheese that does not use processed cheese (I just can't reason eating cheese that does not need to be refrigerated!!) and I found it.  When I made the cheese sauce it was a little thick so I simply added some extra milk a tablespoon at a time.  I also used enough bread crumbs to cover the top (about half of what was made).  Easy and delicious, definitely a keeper!

We loved it "as is" - with all the breadcrumbs.  I took the advice of a previous reviewer and mixed my flour/spices in with some of the cold milk first, before adding to the pot, to prevent lumps.  We made the amount for "6" servings, but found it was more like 4 servings for us, as our main dish.  Great recipe!

I love this recipe!! I've never had mac and cheese.. and this was easy to follow and made from absolute scratch!!! i did make a few changes though. I used cornstarch to thicken the milk instead of all-purpose flour and i added Parmesan cheese as well, and used full cream milk instead. I also spooned in some of the pasta water to the cheese and milk mixture, since I do not like the cheese to be too thick and the oven removes alot of moisture as well. I made sure the pasta was very very slightly undercooked so it would not turn into mush in the oven. Since I am a met lover, I diced some ham, tossed it in some olive oil and added it to the mac and cheese in the oven, half way through bake time.

This is a great starting point for an excellent homemade all natural mac n' cheese.  I used quinoa elbow noodles to up the protein factor, cheddar, mozzarella, parmesan and havarti cheeses, and I added some stewed tomatoes to the finished product.  I also simmered thyme, and red pepper flakes (for some kick) in with the milk mixture before adding the cheese, and I topped with Japanese panko crumbs.

Really good recipe! I read the reviews and tried the different ideas - more cheese, different varities of cheese (cheddar, mozz, and pepper jack).  I also added a 1/2 tablespoon more flour to the sauce to make it thicker, as there's lots of milk in the recipe. I also cut back on the bread crumbs to 1/2 cup. Will make again, and tried the french-fried onions as a topping.

this was a really good recipe, closest to my mom's I could find on here.  My suggestions are:  use a bunch of different kinds of cheese, my favorite (pepper jack - a must, cheddar and mozz), but my mom will put in any cheese that is laying around the house, the pepper jack gives it a kick.  I added about a 1/4 cup more cheese than they say.  I like the addition of the onion, my husband didn't even notice.  I use French's french fried onions on top instead of bread crumbs, croud pleaser.  Overall,  it's one of the best mac & cheese recipes I've seen on here, no canned cheese sauce people!

I didn't think this was very good compared to other baked macaroni recipes I have tried. The cheese sauce was very grainy. We all ate some of it but threw away the rest. Will try a different recipe next time.

I really liked this recipe - it's good old-fashioned comfort food! I used whole-wheat pasta for a healthier kick, and instead of bread crumbs, I crushed whole-wheat crackers. I served it with a salad and it was great!!

My 1st time making homemade Mac N Cheese and this was a very easy good base to start by. The onions gives it a very nice flavor. I omitted the dry mustard, per husbands request. Will work on it more to give a creamier quality. Overall good and easy and better than box. Was even better the second say.Thanks!

Loved this! I added more cheese since we are cheese lovers-used a mozzarella and cheddar blend.  Also added a bit of crumbled bacon. Cut the bread crumbs in half. DELISH!

I thought this was a great way to use up all my odds and ends of cheese. I omitted the crumbs and used a cup of milk and a half a cup of buttermilk and several extrememly sharp cheeses. (2 extra sharp cheddars and a little rock hard clump parm.) of I can only assume that people who found this recipe lacked taste did not use good, strong cheese. It was excellent.

I loved this dish.  My family thought less bread crumbs would be better, but I liked having so many of them.  My mom suggested cooking it in a less deep, wider dish so the bread crumbs would be more spread out.

I don't know if I added too many noodles or what, but this was kind of dry and not very cheesy.  It had a good flavor though, I will try it again and add more cheese.

Very good Mac & Cheese!
I made it per the recipe except I added a bit of garlic with the onion and I left off the breadcrumbs.

We love this.  I add roasted broccoli, cauliflower and garlic to the mix.  It does take a really long time for the milk and flour to thicken.

I did not include a couple of the ingredients(dry mustard,flour), that the recipe called for.Also instead of melting the cheese.I cut a block of mild cheddar and tossed it into my hot pasta (my mother does it this way).Dish turned out great.My boyfriend said it was great.And I agree.Thanks for the recipe!

I use 1/2 cup 2%milk and 1 cup heavy whipping cream... I also add a can of cream of chicken or mushroom soup depending on what I have on hand.... this is the best... I'm always  playing with this recipe.... but it is always my starter

This is so easy! I have made this three times and always get rave reviews. The brand/type of cheese will make a difference...I use twice the cheese & add a colby/monterey blend to the cheddar. Delicious!

I only gave this recipe a 3 star because parts of the directions were misleading and I am a cook who's been cooking a while now and I usually have common sence to realize when something isn't working but this particular night I was tired from work and had my toddler hanging on my legs during the cooking process...anyway when I simmered the milk for 10 mins it turned into a sludge, I still spread it on top of the pasta and added more milk and it was fine. Next time I will simmer for 3 mins, add 16 oz steamed broccoli and cut the bread crumbs in half. Otherwise I love homemade mac and cheese!

I loved this, but I did do some tweaking... I used half sharp cheddar and half velveta and added about a half cup Parmesan. Since I didn't have dry mustard I used prepared spicy brown mustard, and used A LOT more of it, probably at least 2-3 TBS. It was SO YUMMY! I did use the breadcrumbs, but next time I might try to add some Parmesan to the crumbs, too. I see lots of possibilities and potential variations for this dish!

OK - Must have done something wrong - dry?? I am thinking if I had added velveeta, it would have been creamier. Still an easy recipe thats way better than store bought.

I was very excited to make this and serve it to my in-laws.  It turned out very dry because my pasta soaked up all the cheese.  It tasted just OK, but I was embarrassed to serve it to my guests.  My mother-in-law at least helped me save the leftovers by adding ham broth (left from my main dish) to moisten it.

Since this is a “Mom's” recipe, and it is not made with processed cheese, I thought this would be a good macaroni and cheese recipe...and I was right.  I intended to make it exactly with what the recipe called for only to find that I did not have dry bread crumbs.  So, I used 2/3 c. of seasoned dressing mix with 2 T. grated Parmesan cheese added to it.  This is a fantastic recipe and I will definitely make it often.

Absolutely EXACTLY the flavor/texture/etc I was looking for! I didn't notice graininess as some users have said (maybe quality of cheese counts, or maybe the roux wasn't made properly?). The texture was smooth and creamy and YUM. :) I added bacon crumbled on top, as well as crumbled saltine crackers and butter (and extra cheese - I'm of the mindset that you can never have too much cheese).  Also, didn't add the onion because I don't like onion.  This is exactly what my mom used to make (w/out the bacon) as I was growing up, but since she's not around I couldn't replicate it... until now. Thank you!!

This is a pretty good recipe for homemade mac & cheese.  I made a few changes; added a tsp. minced garlic to cook with the onion, left out the mustard and breadcrumbs, 1/2 c. parmesan cheese, and 1 1/2 c. cheddar.  It's VERY cheesy this way, so next time I'll probably cut the cheddar down to a cup and/or add a little more milk to thin it out.  The cheese melts well if you use a whisk and stir it constantly, like you would gravy instead of a wooden spoon or such.  Good recipe and my kids (almost 3 and 14 months) ate it too, so good for even pickier eaters.  Thanks!

It was okay, but a little dry. I guess I'm just used to creamy mac and cheese, and this wasn't it. Followed directions as stated.

Very good, I added 2 tbsp butter, with 2 tbsp flour and then the milk.  Added a lot of fresh herbs from the garden before baking.  Very delicious

This was very good.  The next time I make it, I will decrease the bread crumbs to about 1/3 cup, and I will buy a block of extra sharp cheddar cheese and grate it myself (to yield a sharper taste than what you can get with pre-shredded cheese).

I searched for a good macaroni and cheese recipe that I could tweek to make my own and I chose this one.  I love this recipe!  The only thing I do to change it up is use different kinds of cheese -montery jack is one of my favs to throw in there to spice it up a little!  I also add a little garlic as well, sometimes ham or bacon.  I try to never make the macaroni and cheese the same way twice but I always follow the basics of this fabulous recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe! Easy to do. Did not have any mustard powder, and used fresh, shreaded parmigiano reggiano. My 16 year old daughter was able to do this one by herself. YUMMY!

This is "the real deal", a classic Mac-N-Cheese recipe, very similar to one from a 1946 cookbook of my grandmother's. The best thing about this recipe is that it can easily be altered to the cook's liking, as seen from the large number of reviews.  Although I am a cheddar kind of gal, my family prefers some velveeta in their mac-n-cheese. So, I used half velveeta and half sharp cheddar. I was out of dry mustard, so substituted a half teaspoon of yellow mustard, and also added some paprika to the sauce, but NO SALT, as there is already so much salt in the cheese. It is topped off with grated sharp cheddar, sans the breadcrumbs.  I made this for Easter Dinner the day ahead, and also doubled the recipe. It will stay in the fridge for 24 hours and be put in the oven after the hour drive to mom's on Easter.  I also made sure there was a little left over to make a small portion for my kid's lunch today, and they, including my husband, fought over it.  I have made mac-n-cheese many times, may ways, but consider recipes like this one, made with a basic white sauce, to be the absolute best.

Enjoyed this very much. My son said "it's not as good as KD"... but he's just not used to the real thing! He did finish off a giant portion quite happily. I think it's a texture issue. This mac & cheese was a bit dry. Another reviewer called it "cheese-flavoured macaroni" and I agree-- I'd like it a bit saucier. So next time I'd either increase the sauce or reduce the noodles. Or perhaps use 2 c. of milk instead of 1 1/2.   The sauce was delicious. I sauteed the onion (a LARGE one) for about 15 minutes so it was nice and golden. I used 1/4 tsp. each of salt, pepper, dry mustard and worcestershire sauce for seasoning. And the cheese was a really tasty extra-old cheddar. I used the tiny bow-tie noodles since I didn't have macaroni on hand.  I added a can of drained, flaked tuna, just like I do with KD. Not mixed in, but as a layer in the middle of the noodles. And as another reviewer suggested, topped with sliced tomato instead of the buttered crumbs. It was just easier to slice tomatoes that I had on hand, than prepare the crumbs. And since the noodles were on the dry side, it was good to have the juicy tomato topping.

This macaroni recipe was quite a hit!  I modified a bit using 3 1/2 cups cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup provolone cheese and used 1 1/2 cups half & half, 1/2 cup milk...turned out creamy and delicious!  Will definitely make again soon!

This is delicious mac & cheese.  I did add about a cup more cheese. I used whole wheat noodles. I only added a tiny pinch of salt to the sauce when it was in the pot and ended up needing to stir in a little more after it was cooked.  I used onion powder instead of fresh and didn't include the bread crumbs.  Thanks for the great recipe!

great tasting and easy to make. Added in some leftover ham and also shredded up whatever cheese bits I had leftover from my holiday appetizer tray, jack, Gouda and Edam, in addition to the cheddar. I had to tweak the amounts of salt and mustard based on the saltiness of the cheeses and I added crumbled up Cheezit crackers on top. This recipe is a keeper.

I had high hopes for this recipes but it just didn't go over very well with the family. Maybe we are too hung up on Kraft :) My kid's wished it was cheesier and didn't go for the bread crumbs. I know that this is a much more healthful option so I wish it had received a better reception.

This ended up being a 3 1/2 star recipe for me, but with great potential.  For the topping, I used panko breadcrumbs because I wanted to use them up, the melted butter, a heaping tbsp of grated parmesan and a couple dashes of paprika for color - the topping looked beautiful and tasted great.  I was a little disappointed with the mac n cheese part, though.  Very bland and a little too dry.  I added another cup of cheddar but probably should have increased the milk and flour mixture, as there was barely a hint of creaminess to the pasta - it was more like "cheddar flavored macaroni", as there was not creamy cheese sauce coating the pasta but instead it was rather dry.  The onion flavor was good, detectable but not overpowering, but next time I would also add more mustard - maybe some dijon instead of dried powder - and a dash of Worcestershire.

This was a delicious recipe. The only change I made was to add some chopped ham so that it would be a little more of a real meal, and my family thought it was great.

Some reviewers suggested leaving out the breadcrumbs, but I left them in, and I'm glad I did. The whole dish is great (and it's also very easy!).

I tried this recipe the other night, and it was a great success!  My 16 month old son, and my (very picky European husband) loved it.  The only thing I did not use was the bread crumbs, as I could not find any that day.  I aslo followed some other reviewers advice and added some parmsean cheese.  Turned out great!  I think everyone should try this recipe!

I made this over the weekend and loved it. I omitted the dry mustard because my husband hates it. I also used low fat cheese and low fat milk, which sure helps the calorie content. This one's a keeper.

I just prepare this on the stove rather than baking it. I like that there aren't any processed cheeses in it. To add spice, sometimes I'll use a minced jalepano or for variation I add scallions and garlic. Good base recipe to play with.

Phenomenal!! Family loved it, even my kids who have grown up on the blue box! We enjoyed it so much, especially the leftovers that my husband dubbed "even better the second time around," that I'm making it again this week, but in two separate batches, one of which I'm going to add seasoned, brown ground beef to and have it as a main dish and the other batch will be used as a side dish. Pure comfort food, and especially easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly except for using half and half instead of milk and I added a little more sharp cheddar cheese. Everything else was right on. Yum!!!

I love this recipe! Mac 'n' cheese is one of my favorite things to eat, and this is always a crowd pleaser when I make it. I do like to sprinkle small cubes of ham, or cumin-spiced ground beef to the mixture before baking. It gives it that extra kick of flavor. I also add in asiago cheese along with the cheddar.

Pretty good.  My family liked it.  The only thing is I wasn't crazy about the texture.  Other than that is was good.  It is season to taste, so I just added a little salt, pepper and garlic powder until It was close to what I liked.  I knew the cheese would finish the rest, and it did.  Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe for home made macacaroni and cheese.  I don't like onions so I leave them out, I leave off the breadcrumbs, and if I have cream I will use that instead of milk - but other than that I follow the recipe as is and it always turns out great.

This recipe was...........edible. I found it to be very bland and small on cheese taste. I read the reviews and made suggested changes but still seemed to have to had a lot of salt. My boyfriend had two helpings but my step daughter did not like it so much. Next time I will try it with a stronger style cheese.

I wanted to try a new mac and cheese recipe instead of making my usual.  Thought this one sounded good.  It turned out ok.  The onion was pretty overwhelming and I used only a portion of the breadcrumbs and it was still a little much.  My kids ate a couple bites and wouldnt eat anymore.  Probably wont make this one again.

Great recipe.  I added some cubed ham and used crushed potato chips on top instead of the bread crumbs.

The onion overwhelmed the taste for me.  Perhaps I used too much.  What IS a "small" onion, after all.  I used about 1/4 cup and it was still too much.  And, GRAINY... Hate that grainy taste.  And I did not care for the bread crumbs at all.  Sigh...

There are lots of mac & cheese recipes on this site.  I chose this one because of its lower sodium content, comparatively, because it's easy to make, and it's not "overdone" with extra ingredients (like bacon, etc).  My toddler loves this recipe!  So do we!

I don't use the breadcrumbs or mustard, because I never have any and the dish doesn't need them. I use 1 cup white cheddar and 1 cup sharp yellow cheddar. Sometimes I bake it for my husband and sometimes we just mix in the cheese and have it creamy. Delicious both ways!

Yum & Yum!  I too omitted the bread crumbs.   Instead I increased the oven temp to 400, in the last 10-15 mins.,  to make a crunchy cheese crust.  This recipe reminds me of my Mom's mac & cheese!

Yummy!  I'm picky about my mac and cheese, but this hit the spot.  I omitted the onion and reduced the bread crumbs to half a cup.  I like my mac and cheese cheesy, but not too custard-like.  The mustard adds the perfect kick, and the bread crumbs are what makes this awesome.  Would recommend highly!

My family and I are extremely lactose intolerant.  I used soy cheese and lactose free milk, and the results were delicious!  My picky three year old declared it yummy.  I did have to add an extra cup of cheese, but used the rest of the recipe with listed amounts.

I sometimes substitute stoneground mustard for the dry - it adds a wonderful flavor. Use a little extra macaroni for leftovers. For the topping I tear apart slices of fresh white bread and saute in butter - much better than the 4C type breadcrumbs.

Exactly what I think of when I want the best mac and cheese.  My spouse LOVES macaroni and cheese and he also gives this an A+.  Flavor is perfect and not too creamy like some boxed varieties are.  Good recipe for using different cheese, spicing it up more, or whatever addition suits your fancy that day.

Good. A little bland. Maybe needs sharper cheddar or a mixture of cheeses or maybe more salt. I made with reduced fat cheddar, so that could have been the reason. Still quite good.

Boring and bland. If I were to make it again, I'd user fewer noodles, more cheese, and a cup of ham. But I'll never make it again. To much work for too little payoff.

I always wanted to find a good baked mac & chesse recipe, and I have finally found one.  I jazzed it up a little by using one cup of fontina and one cup of cheddar.  It was really yummy.  But, I think next time I will use just a tad more seasonings to spice it up.  But, overall, this was a great recipe.

I liked this, but I think it would have been better with less bread crumbs, or even NO breadcrumbs.  The crumbs made it kind of thick and dry when mixed in.  I'll try it again. :P

very very good! i put a few dolups of cheeze wiz here and there to give a little surprise :-)
One comment about the dryness noted by other reviewers: The recipe says to layer the breadcrumbs on top, not mix them in. 
Edit: Also, I find that it tastes better when I grate blocks of cheese instead of using pre-shredded cheese. There's a coating that they put on the bagged stuff that I really notice when making a cheese sauce. Regarding grainy sauce... be sure to use a low heat and add the cheese slowly. If it gets overheated the sauce will get a weird grainy texture.

This was pretty good. It's a great starter recipe but definitely needs some additional spices. I love the sauce. If you add the milk slowly you shouldn't get "grains." My texture was just fine! I used half mozzarella and half cheddar. Also, definitely mix your noodles into the sauce before putting them in the greased pan. The noodles on the bottom had nothing on them :( I'll be doing that next time for sure. It was a decent recipe though!  Thanks for posting!

First, a couple of things for people having trouble: 1. If the sauce was grainy or your cheese didn't melt, you didn't make a proper roux. Don't blame the recipe for your lack of cooking skills! First, you melt the butter. Then, you sautee your onions (a very fine mince works best; you can pulse them in a processor of blender if you don't want chunks, or you can really take a shortcut and use dried, minced onions--that's what I did; it intensifies the flavor a lot. I used 2 Tbsp and heated it with the butter, until golden). Whisk in the flour. You MUST stir continually, or you'll have lumps. This is cooking 101. Don't be cheap about the time you spend here. You need a smooth base. If it's grainy, you're not finished cooking it. Then, when your flour has taken on a rich golden color, and is smooth(!), slowly add milk and keep stirring!!  It's done when the sauce thickens enough to cover the back of a metal spoon.  2. "Salt and Pepper, to taste" is somewhat intuitive. It takes experience and common sense. If your sauce is "bland," you didn't add enough seasoning. You can fix this by tasting it before removing it from the pot. You want it just a little on the side of "overpowering," because the noodles will absorb the flavor, and dilute the saltiness (also add salt to your noodles as they cook; it makes a huge difference). I used double the pasta (a 16 oz box), to make it go farther, and the flavor was still not bland. 3. KEEP STIRRING, when you add the cheese. Your cheese will

If you want this to turn out REALLY authentic and delicious beyond belief, add one or two beaten eggs to the mixture before baking. :)

It was just like my mother used to make.  Only thing I would cut back on the bread crumbs.  But my family loved it!

I think this is the best southern style mac and cheese recipe  of all....i believe you can really over cheese it by using more than one cheese...this is perfect...i will cook again and again...followed this recipe and wouldn't change a thing...

I don't care who you are - this stuff is great!  Made it exactly per the recipe and people are elbowing each other getting as much as they can before it's gone.  Hint:  Make sure your sauce isn't too hot.  As soon as it thickens, drop the heat to low and add your cheese a bit at a time making sure it's completely melted before adding more.   And, please, stop rating a tweaked recipe.  Please.

Pretty good mac n' cheese. I added some spice to the cheese sauce and french fried onions in addition to the crumbs. Tastes good fresh out of the oven. Pretty decent for leftovers.

I did add cream of mushroom soup to it one time and it was a hit!

I use this exact recipe except for one little secret of mine...I add 1 tablespoon of Worcerstershire Sauce in addition to the ground mustard. That makes a big difference! Also I omit the breadcrumbs but instead sprinkle some reserved shredded cheese to the top before baking..the cheese gets a nice crusty brown. I use half sharp cheddar and half Mexican or Colby Jack cheese. I have made this with and without the onion and it's delicious both ways. What I love about this recipe is you can make it up ahead of time and keep in frig until ready to bake. Great recipe, lots of raves on this. Everywhere I go everyone asks for this. I agree with another reviewer...add half the milk to the flour and butter and whisk until not lumpy. Then add the remaining milk. Much easier and no lumps!

I just made it, and I really liked how it came out. The only thing that I did differently was to not add that many bread crumbs. Regardless, the mac and cheese was delicious and I'd strongly recommend this recipe to anyone.

This recipe was very easy to make. It tasted better than The Other Mac and Cheese.
I didn't have ground mustard, so I've added a bit of turmeric,  just to enhance the yellow colour.
My family loved it.

The onions were way too over powering. The recipe called for 1 small onion minced. I used maybe a 1/4th of that, and I put it in a chopper so it was really minced. The mac tasted most of onion. Glad I made this a few days before thanksgiving. On thanksgiving day I'll make with no onions

Hands down our fave mac and cheese recipe! I do use less of the breadcrumbs and add a bit of parmesan to them, increase the cheese a bit (good quality sharp cheddar!) and always include the dry mustard - sometimes increase it a bit.  mmmm!

I've made this so many times that I don't need to read the recipe. So adaptable to what you have on hand. I had soymilk, but out of regular milk and it was just fine. Mixed in some diced ham leftover from the freezer and diced a jalapeno from the garden. Wonderful!

Pretty good.....a standard way to make mac and cheese with a classic roux into a cheese sauce. I quadrupled the recipe to bring to a bbq yesterday....seemed to be a hit....used extra sharp cheddar. Thanks!

Okay flavor, dry texture, and recipe lacked clarification on Pasta quantity, (8 oz. weight dry or cooked, or volume dry or cooked?) I would swap out the cheddar for Velveta or American cheese to give it the texture that it needs.  but otherwise a solid recipe.

This was a great mac and cheese recipe in itself.  I loved that it called for onions and mustard powder and I found the recipe to be quite versatile - I just used a bunch of leftover bits of cheese (cheddar, Gruyere, pepper jack, mozzarella).  Unfortunately, I think the bread crumbs really took over and ruined an otherwise delicious flavor.  Next time, I'll either skip them altogether or substitute crushed Ritz crackers or crushed corn flakes spritzed with melted butter.  Without the breadcrumbs, I think this recipe would have been a four-star.  Thanks for sharing!
Update: this time I used crushed Ritz crackers (no butter) and it was MUCH better.  It did come out a little dry though.  Next time, I'll try making 50% more cheese sauce -- it seems to really soak into the pasta as it bakes.

This was really good and very easy. Instead of just using Cheddar Cheese I did half cheddar and half Jack. I also doubled the recipe to fit it in a 13x9 inch pan. My husband loves spice so he added some Tapatio to the top for some extra flavor. I usually add Chipotle Tabasco. :)

This was very good! For the base cheese we used sharp cheddar. We added some regular cheddar shredded cheese to the top to add color. Next time we will use more onion, it was a very unexpected and tasty addition!

Came out great! It was a little dry in spots so I would suggest using a bit more milk than suggested! I also added a bit of cream, it really enhanced the cheesy flavor!

This turned out well. I used Panko bread crumbs and loved how that turned out.  I used evaporated milk and had no problem with it thickening.  Next time I will probably use additional cheese at my family's request. I will definitely make it again.

Absolutely delicious! Everyone cleared their plates.  I made a few adjustments.  Added another 1/2 c of milk and an extra cup of cheese. I used mixed colby and monterry jack cheese instead of the cheddar. I also added about 1/2 c of browned hamburger and  1/2 tsp of garlic powder into the onion mixture.  Definitely a new favorite.

I omitted the onion but otherwise followed recipe as is.  I have never added the breadcrumb topping before and I liked this dish a lot.  My son loved it, daughter didn't (but not surprising), and hubby liked it but prefers a creamier, saucier macaroni.  I will keep this in my recipe box, and maybe even make it again.

This was a fantastic recipe, very simple.  I dislike breadcrumbs on my pasta, so I left that out, used some nice fresh reggiano parmegiano in addition to sharp cheddar to add some more bite and it was super-awesome!  Also threw in some ham chunks and served it with a light salad to balance the heaviness of the dish.  Great recipe!

This was great! Didn't mind the breadcrumbs, just added a little more butter to them about a tsp or so extra. Added about a cup of Mozzarella to the bottom of the casserole dish and 1/2-3/4 cup of parmesan to the cheese sauce. YUUUMMMY!!!

Definitely too many bread crumbs. Next time I'll either skip them completely or do about 1/4 of a cup. I didn't use mustard since I didn't have any, but I think that would've helped the flavor. Next time I'll also probably put layers of plain grated cheddar in the pasta like my mama used to, then pour the sauce on top after that. Not bad though, for real cheese instead of the processed junk.

Used campanelle pasta instead of macaroni. Added saute of mushrooms and pablano peppers to the cooked pasta. In place of onions, used chopped fresh jalapeno peppers in step 3. Great comfort dish!

This is amazing!! I've made this four times so far and it is simply wonderful.  I suggest adding a bit more butter to the bread crumbs and trying different cheeses too.  Yum!!

Very good - I made this for 12 using ziti instead of elbow macaroni.  I also didn't have shredded cheddar, so I cubed what I had and left the milk mixture on the stove, heating, and mixed in the cheese.  Delish - just like my 94 year old grandmother used to make - and she LOVED today's version; she took the leftovers home to have for lunch tomorrow!

This was pretty good.  I made some minor changes.  I used 9oz of shells pasta, used 1% milk.  Recipe says salt/pepper to taste, i used about 1/4 tsp pepper and 1/2 tsp salt.  For the topping, I just sprinkled on the bread crumbs without the butter. Will be making this again.

This was the first time I made homemade mac and cheese and I thought this recipe was really good.  The only thing I did different was that I heated the milk in the microwave before adding to the butter/onion/flour mixture and ended up with a really creamy white sauce before I added the cheese. It wasn't grainy at all as I had expected it to be after reading the other reviews so I was impressed.  My 3 year old, who is used to Kraft, really loved it.

Just like mom's except mom uses crushed crackers on top instead of bread crumbs. I'm not a huge fan of either so I used french fried onions on top. Yum!

This was a great recipe, my whole family loved it and my husband, who hates leftovers was searching the fridge for it the next day.  It is a great recipe for people with toddlers or small children because they love it and it makes a great and easy lunch the next day.  I also add a little paprika for a little more flavour.  I also like to make a little more cheese sauce, so if there are leftovers it is still great(and cheesy) the next day.

The recipe I have been looking for, almost. DeMoulas/Market Basket brand has a similar recipe on the back of its elbow macaroni box but they've sinced changed the recipe. I think that recipe calls for 2 Tbsps. flour. I also add cumin, because I like it. Do as reviewer Adeline suggests and use Colby cheddar; that's what I use and it's the best for mac and cheese. Delicious.

This was the first real meal I've cooked and these directions worked perfectly.  Two cups made it cheesy enough and it tasted great using cheddar jack cheese.  Good meal.

I am really a mac & cheese fan and wanted to try something a little different.  Should have stuck to the old recipe I have.  Actually I think boxed mac/cheese (not the one's with the powdered cheese) is better than this recipe.  I made the recipe as given and my family  didn't enjoy it. Sorry

This was a fast and easy way to make home made mac and cheese. I was not especially fond that it didn't have a great flavor. I even used a sharp cheddar cheese. It tasted kind of bland. The consistency was great while in the saucepan...nice and creamy, but once I put it in the oven it broke down and got really gritty tasting. I think next time I will maybe add more of the dry mustard and not bake it. Otherwise, I thought it was quick and easy! I will attempt this dish again with a few changes.

delicious! I added a clove of minced garlic to the onions and butter while preparing and omitted the mustard. This is one of the better Mac N Cheese I have had.

very good sauce! Make sure you use a wisk when your sauce is thickening to avoid lumps. And I didn't have milk on hand, but I did have non-fat creamer...worked great! And I would imagine a bit better for you =) I also agree with the reviewer that said the dry mustard is essential, and next time I think I will add another type of cheese for a bit more zip.

This was okay but not great.I didn't notice the zip that the mustard was supposed to bring to the recipe. My husband didn't like the breadcrumbs but that was just personal taste. It is a good base recipe and a great way to learn how to make it from scratch. I'll probably try it again with different cheeses.

Sorry, I made this recipe exactly as written it was just awful, very bland and grainy. But thank you for something new, I had never made Mac and cheese this way before. Don't think I'll ever make it quite this way again, but it certainly gave me some new ideals.

This recipe was awful, although I did not make it, we had it for dinner last night and I could not eat it.  Not sure if the recipe was followed exactly, but I found the bread crumbs on the top not necessary, and it was extremely dry and bland.  Needed a stonger cheese and more milk.  I won't have this again if it's offered me for dinner.  I prefer to have it with the celery and onions and tomatoes in it with grated cheese  on the top.

Fantastic recipe! I added some thinly sliced sauteed chicken and it was extra tasty. I also added some Italian seasoning. Without that I'm not sure how well spiced it would be, but all I know is that with my additions it was delicious. Thanks for posting this!

I had my meal all planned out tonight for supper (fish sticks and macaroni & cheese) and when I went to get out the macaroni to make, I saw that we were out of boxed macaroni!  So, I got on trusty AllRecipes.com and found this recipes.  I didn't have any macaroni noodles either, so changed the recipe and used rontini noodles.  This turned out great and was delicous!!  Definatly a "do again".  So much better then the boxed stuff!  :)

Absolutely Fabulous! You can't miss if you follow the directions AS WRITTEN! Use good cheese (not store brand, which tends to have less moisture).

Very good recipe! I doubled it. Used only 1/2 of an onion sprinkle of paprika DON'T OMIT THE MUSTARD! I also toasted 2 slices of bread and just crumbled it on the top and it was good.   Yes it is a bit grainy but the taste is yummy and the grainyness is part of using real cheese. TIP:  Use the attachment on your cuisinart to shred your cheese - SUPER FAST!

I agree with others...the bread crumbs, not so hot.  Other than that, I loved it.  I'm going to try a little extra cheese on top next time instead of the crumbs.

Everyone liked this macaroni. I used tri-colored rotini. Will use elbow macaroni next time. Also mixed dry ingredients in some milk before adding to pan for heating. I used cheddar and parmesan. I think it may need more cheese.

This recipe was EXCELLENT!  I added mozzarella and used a yellow/white cheddar combo - next time will add parmesan as others have suggested.  Thought the onion would be too much but was incredible.  Used a sleeve of crushed butter crackers and 3 tbs butter for the topping - VERY very good - and I am not a big fan of mac-n-cheese!  Will definately make again.

I thought it tasted way to onion-y. Not too much like mac and cheese. Next time I'll use some onion powder and not a whole onion.

Great macaroni and cheese recipe. I made it without the bread crumbs and without the baking step. I also enjoy this recipe with white cheese (mozzarella, etc) and a dash of Cajun seasonings.

Next time I will probably omit the onions, as the flavor seemed to overwhelm the macaroni and cheese. I like another reviewer's idea of using crushed cheese-flavored crackers...sounds delicious!

I love this recipe and I use it as a base.  I saute garlic with the onions and omit the bread crumb topping.  Also use my own mixture of cheese (parmesean,mozerella, and cheddar.

Not quite creamy enough.  I'm thinking condensed milk might have worked better and maybe even some cream cheese.

My kids love pasta almost anyway it can be cooked, but this didn't do it for them either.  Not a recipe I'll repeat.

I have been using this recipe for years and it is always a favorite in our home.  I omit the bread crumbs though and top the casserole with Durkee fried onion riings. This adds a lot to an already great recipe.

I used more milk than the recipe called for, less than half of the bread crumbs on top a little more dry mustard and a mix of sharp cheddar and and some 4 cheese blend. I still thought this was missing something. I personally thought this to be bland with the onion giving a flavor that I am not used to in mac and cheese. Also with less than half the bread crumbs and extra milk used this was stil on the dry side.

I read other reviews and took their suggestions.  I added some fresh grated parm cheese, threw in the rest of those prepacked Italian cheese mix, along with cheddar and a few chunks of american cheese. I used canned milk--hoping for creaminess.  Came out alright. Wasn't cheesy creamy...but it worked well with DH and our son.  I thought it could've been creamier, maybe 2 cans of the milk instead next time.  I don't like my mac n cheese to be SWIMMING in sauce, but some sauce is nice.  Was alright for leftover, but seemed to dry out more.  Too much bread crumbs stated in the recipe, so I cut that in half.  Don't care for that part.  Overall I will attempt to make mac-cheese from scratch again sometime in my life, but not this recipe.

This was not as good as I thought it would be. It was not at all creamy. Even my kids who are Mac and Cheese addicts didn't care for it.I probably won't be making it again.

This was just OK. I guess I am just used to the boxed mac and cheese, the texture and flavor was different.  It wasn't a bad taste, just kind of blah for me, and a little grainy in texture.  My husband didn't care for it either, he said it would be better with the cheese just melted on top and not into the white sauce.  Probably won't make again, but thanks anyway!

This is a great homemade mac and cheese recipe. I used onion powder instead of an onion, and didn't do the bread crumb topping. Also used a mix of sharp chedd/med chedd/parm/mozz, and a splash of worcestershire. YUM!!! Will make again!!

I really liked this recipe as it uses real cheese and not the fake stuff.  I have a gluten allergy so I use rice macaroni noodles and no bread crumbs.  Definitely tasty!

This wasn't bad, but nothing special. I added a teaspoon of dry mustard and a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce to try to kick the flavour up a bit.

This is a good recipe!  I followed it exactly, but it just seemed like something was missing.  Maybe it didn't have enough salt and pepper.  Still yummy though!

Wasn't dry, but very oily from the butter and pretty bland. I added lots of minced onion as well as worcestershire sauce and salt and pepper. Probably could have done without the breadcrumbs. I've made this type of mac n cheese before and it didn't seem as dry as the others. The cheese seemed creamy enough, but the taste just wasn't there. Will keep trying.

It's okay. I didn't have the problem of the dryness that other reviewers discussed, which I think I overcame by adding about 3/4 cup of cottage cheese to the cheese mixture. I understand the comments about blandness -- I combatted this with the leftovers by adding more salt, and bits of artichoke hearts. Sun-dried tomatoes would also be good. Might make again, but will probably seek another recipe.

I added too many noodles so it was sort of dry, but I think if I had actually read the recipe...it would have been fantastic

Easy and delicious. Used extra sharp cheddar and a few slices of American. Didn't make the topping - put in a crock pot for a party. I quadrupled (!) the recipe and it worked fine, although it took longer to thicken. Added a little garlic. Not pretty as leftovers, but tastes even better the second day.  Definitely will make this again.

Excellent!  I added some bacon and paprika, and it came out quite savory.  Next time I want to try it with a can of tuna.

This is the best macaroni and cheese I've ever eaten!  I doubled the recipe (all ingredients except the bread crumbs, which I left as is).  My husband and kids loved it and I will certainly make it over and over again.  Thanks!

This was great - although my kids who have grown up on Mac and Cheese from a box, wouldn't even touch it!  I'll definately make it again and again.

I've made this twice thinking it would come out better the second time but it didn't.  Not really macaroni and cheese like I had expected, more of a macaroni casserole but still good.
