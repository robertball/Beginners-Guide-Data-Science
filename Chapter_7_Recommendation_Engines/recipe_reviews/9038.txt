Excellent.  I tried it this way as well as putting all the ingredients (including raw chicken)into the slow cooker on low overnite.  Tasted MUCH, MUCH better.  This recipe is always requested at any potluck I attend.

This is fantastic!  My husband and son raved about it and couldn't wait for leftovers.  Delicious flavors and wonderfully moist.  For those of you who weren't that impressed, use teriyaki baste & glaze (not just a sauce or marinade) -- it's thicker and adds much more flavor than a marinade.  No need to marinade over night or hours before if you use this.  I used Kikoman baste & glaze and Hidden Valley ranch lite, with real bacon(low salt) crumbled.  I didn't fry the chicken - I just spooned on the baste & glaze to both sides of the chicken & then spooned on the ranch, with everything else following.  Great with an angel hair pasta with sauteed garlic, tomatoes, onions, and spices.

It was very good.  I like trying new things and this recipe hit the spot.  I'll be passing it on to my mom.  One note: I would add the chese until the last 10-15 mins of baking and next time, and I also like to use real bacon (4-5 strips) which I will cook while it is in the oven and when it is done, I add the cheese and bacon during the last 10-15 mins and it tastes fabulous!!

This recipe was just OK!  The browning time plus the amount of time baked in the oven made for over cooked chicken.  My husband only took two bites and said, "Way too salty".  Guess that's it for this dish and I had such high hopes with 1,550 reviews....  Sorry, definitely didn't make it into our dinner rotation!

My husband and I really liked this dish.  The only thing I did different was that I marinated the chicken in the teriyaki sauce for several hours. Then after browning the chicken, I mixed the remaining teriyaki sauce with the ranch and spooned the mixture over the chicken.  That eliminated the "gross" color I've read others complain about.  I think next time I will cover the dish with foil before baking to keep the cheese from drying out so much.  We eat baked chicken in more than 50% of our meals, and this was a really nice change from the ordinary.

Is 9:00 a.m. too early to eat the half of piece of this wonderful chicken leftover from last night? The only change I made was to dip the chicken into egg and then seasoned flour before sauteing. I also added a bit of teriyaki to the bottom of the dish before baking. I waited until the last 15 minutes of cooking time before I added my shredded cheddar. This dish was so good!

My entire family loved it!  I always use Lawry's brand teriyaki marinade instead of any other brand...not as salty, I guess because of the pineapple juice.  I followed this recipe to the letter except that I marinaded the chicken breast in teryaki sauce for about 20 minutes while the oven preheated. I served it with homemade garlic mashed potatoes, fresh broccoli, and garlic bread.  My husband and son had 2 helpings!

This is by far the best chicken recipe I've tried on this site.  I didn't have some of the items, so I did a few substitutions and it turned out wonderful.  This is what I did:  I used real bacon and cooked it, saved the drippings and sauted the chicken in them.  I didn't have any ranch dressing, but I had ranch seasoning packet, so I combined whatever left I had of sour cream and plain yogurt with the ranch to make the dressing.  I also didn't have teriyaki sauce, but instead a marinating sauce, which isn't really "sauce", so I thickened the marinating sauce with corn starch and it was fine.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to the T and it came out perfect!  I only made two chicken breast and my sister who doesn't like cheese loved it.  Too bad I didn't make her any =/.  Oh, and I do agree that it is a bit salty (wasn't too bad for us), so you might want to use low sodium ingredients.

This is absolutely delicious!!  I never would have thought bacon bits, teriyaki sauce and ranch dressing would taste so good together, but I was wrong.  I cannot tell you enough how much I enjoyed this.  Even my picky hubby liked it.  I agree with previous reviewers that it is a bit on the salty side, but that certainly will not prevent me from making this again and again.  Thank you so much Vicki!!

I have to say this is a winner in my house!  I was skeptical like everyone w/ the flavor combo.  Made extremely minor changes.  I marinated the chicken breasts in the teriyaki sauce and poked holes in the chicken to have the marinade "seep" through for about 30 minutes.  I browned them in the skillet w/EVOO & blk pepper & red pepper flakes and then placed in the pan.  I used 1/2c ranch and 1/4c teriyaki and mixed together.  I poured liberally over the chicken.  Let bake half way through and pulled out, basted again w/sauce and added the cheese, bacon & onions.  Back into the oven.  About 5 minutes before removing, basted the tops w/sauce again and added a little more cheese & bacon.  Came out beautifully.  I should have made more sauce b/c it wasn't too salty by omiting the 1/4c of teriyaki.  Will make again and again.

This was pretty good.  I changed it a bit.  I scored the chicken and allowed it to marinate in the teriyaki for about an hour.  I used a mix for the ranch dressing, low fat chedder, turkey bacon and white onions.  My fiance did not like the ranch and I thought it tasted a bit salty.  Probably because I used the mix for the dressing.  Next time I'll leave off the ranch.  This was still very good and would make this again.

Delicious.  I didn't bother sauteing first.  I pounded the chicken for extra tenderness, and then mixed the basting sauce and ranch dressing and spread generously on both sides.  Then baked for 30 minutes on 350.  Then for the last 10 minutes, I put on the cheese, bacon bits and green onions.  Everyone loved it.  And a much easier way to get the same results.

WOW! This was absolutely awesome. My 2year old son, husband, and father-in-law loved this and that's rare in my house. I was so excited. This smelled wonderful as well. I did what others said to do...Used Kikkoman teriyaki baste & glaze (in the oriental section at the store), I mixed the ranch and teriyaki prior to brushing on the chicken. I used the jarred real bacon pieces and I put them and the cheese on 15 minutes before the chicken was done. I cut the chicken into smaller pieces and next time I will cut all of them into smaller pieces and make a little more sauce, maybe 2/3 cup of ranch and 2/3 cup of teriyaki sauce. WE ALL LOVED THIS STUFF=) THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE GREAT RECIPE=)

I wasn't going to rate this, thinking it has so many great reviews this won't make a difference, but I would hate for anyone else to try this out thinking it will be wonderful. First, the soy flavor is way too strong and does not mix with the other flavors. I consider myself a good judge of how something will turn out and I was very leary of this recipe, but assumed with all the great reviews it would be wonderful.  My husband wouldn't take a second bite (the man eats anything... but this dish) and I wasted chicken breasts. The bacon bits and soy together just do not work.

This was excellent!  All of my children loved it, and it really looks very pretty coming out of the oven.  I did add fresh sliced mushrooms to my piece, because I love mushrooms!  It was fantastic!

almost 5 stars! i had everything on hand, except the green onions and i used real bacon instead of bacon bits. it was very tasty and very easy! i really enjoyed having something different for a change. it was a tad salty, but not too much. i didn't think that all of the ingredients would go so well together. i will make this again, for sure!

This was good, and I think with a few modifications it could be GREAT.  I too had a problem with saltiness, and I didn't taste the ranch dressing as much as I'd hoped.  I think next time I will madinade the chicken in the teriyaki sauce and just add ranch on top.

I also didn't add the cheese, bacon bits, or green onions until only 10 minutes of cooking time was left.  It did not "bake off" or "look all goopy" like others had complained about when done that way.

I have made this chicken many times and it just gets better each time.   However, I do cut the chicken breasts into large bit size pieces instead of leaving the breasts whole.   It makes it easier for my kids to eat.

This chicken recieved an enthusiastic thumbs up from everyone in the family!! I made the following changes: 1. I used the Baked Teriyaki Chicken recipe from this site for delicious (and super fast and easy) sauce, 2. I used 12 bone-in thighs that I skinned and marinated for 4 hrs in a little of the teriyaki sauce, 3. I sauted real bacon and used the drippings to brown the chicken and onions, 4. I put a little teriyaki sauce in the bottom of the dish and also a little drizzled over the thighs. 5. Then I put the sauted onions overthe thighs. 6. I mixed the remaining teriyaki sauce and Ranch dressing and poured over the chicken. 7. Because I was also preparing Oven Fries (this site), I needed my oven at 450 degrees, so I covered the dish with foil and baked for 40 min, removing foil for the last 10 min.  The chicken was wonderful...there was no grease visible, color was certainly acceptable, the cheese had melted down into the chicken...the boys voted for more cheese!  Otherwise, we loved it, and I'd be proud to serve it to company, probably with rice to slurp up that delicious sauce...try the Baked Teriyaki Chicken for great teriyaki sauce...you'll never want to buy it again!!!

This chicken was so yummy!  I skipped sauteing and just put raw chicken in dish with both sauce and dressing that I had mixed well.  I waited till the last 10 minutes to add bacon and cheese and this dish was PERFECT!!  YUMMY!  A keeper for sure.

This is delicious! I followed the recipe except used precooked bacon slices and laid them on the chicken pieces, then added the cheese later so it wouldn't burn. Oh, one more thing: I used Hidden Valley Ranch dressing with garlic! The extra garlic flavor was nice.

My husband and I found this dish to be very tasty. I marinated the chicken in the teriyaki sauce before I sautéed them and I used real bacon instead of bits. The flavor was excellent!! My only criticism would be the appearance; the oil separated from the cheese and dressing and the grease just sort of floated around in the sauce. In fact, it looked so unappealing, I wasn't even sure I wanted to eat it until tasted the chicken….. Absolutely delicious!

Maybe not the healthiest dish but one of the best I've had on this site!  I put everything in slow cooker except the cheese and bacon.  When chicken was done and tender, I shredded it in the pot and added the cheese and bacon and let rest with lid on for 1/2 hour.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and fried cabbage and onion.  Rave reviews from family!  Thank you!

I really enjoy salty snacks and foods, but this was so salt-heavy that I think I may need to consult a doctor now.

Great Chicken recipe-Although I was quite skeptical about putting terryaki sauce and ranch dressing together, I tried it anyways! My boyfreind is the pickiest person on the planet, so I refused to tell him what was in it until he finished his meal(apporx. 3 min later!) He loved it & now requests it all the time. We always serve it with garlic mashed potatoes and a veggie- a great meal for company.

Another very good recipe. The only thing different that I did was use real bacon and then saute onions in the bacon grease before putting them on top of the chicken. Very tasty.

Ok, I have read all the rave reviews...I was so inspired by them that I made it right away.  Unfortunately, it was awful.  It was so salty that I drank tons of water during dinner.  There was so much fat in it that I could see the oil separating from the "sauce."  I am so glad that I didn't ruin my good cooking reputation by serving it to my friends!

Delicious. I contemplated making this recipe for the past two months because of the combination of ingredients. I'm so glad I finally prepared this for my family. My plan: double the recipe and serve at our Sunday dinner and have leftovers for Monday night. Well, it didn't work that way, my family enjoyed it so much Sunday night, I didn't have any leftovers for Monday night! I only served my kids a small portion because I didn't think they would like it but I was wrong. They kept going back for more. I knew my husband and I would like this after I brushed the basting sauce and ranch on the chicken. It smelled so good. This is what I did with this recipe: I pounded the chicken breasts thin, cut up real bacon & fried it till half cooked, added the cheese and bacon last 10 minutes of baking, made my ranch dressing - do not buy bottled dressing & I used Mr. Yoshida's original gourmet sauce. I omitted the onions becuase of my kids. The chicken breasts were great but I will prepare this recipe again using boneless, skinless chicken thighs. My husband kept giving me a thumbs up during our dinner and I know he overate. Please give this recipe a try, I'm really glad I did.

I can't disagree with the masses.  This was fantastic.  I made it twice in one week it was so good.  Thanks for the great recipe!! (Added for the ones who didn't get this one right)  The Teriyaki has to be the BASTE & GLAZE (by Kikkoman, which is thick), not teriyaki sauce which is the consistency of water.  I tried it with both and I agree that the teriyaki sauce was not good. It has to be the BASTE & GLAZE, or a corn-starch thickened teriyaki sauce.  Also, I recommend you let it sit for about 5 minutes after pulling from the oven and cut around the cheese prior to plating.  This will help the ingredients remain on the chicken and not be left behind in the pan.

I lightened this up substantially, but otherwise followed the recipe. It is delicious. But then, can  you ever go wrong with the bacon and ranch flavor combo?

I love this! It tastes so g0od and it's very easy to make. To those wh0 gave this a 1 star try making this again but make sure that you use the thick teriyaki sauce (I recommend using Kikkoman Baste&Glaze teriyaki sauce) instead of the regular teriyaki marinade.  A definite keeper! Thanks for sharing :)

I made this for the first time for company (something I don't usually do!) and we ALL loved it! Made a few changes as I thought it might be a little dry: I marinated the chicken overnight in a full bottle of teriyaki marinade (used a full bottle, because I was cooking for 12 people), then browned the chicken in some olive oil. Dumped an entire LARGE bottle of Ranch dressing on top and baked it for 25 minutes; then added 1/2 lb.shredded sharp cheddar and a full bottle of real bacon pieces (not imitation bits) and chopped scallions. Cooked it for another 15; then let it sit in warm over for about 15 minutes or so as company was not quite ready to eat. Ingredients combined completely for a great sauce (it looked nothing like the picture), and what a sauce!! WOW! The flavors combine just perfectly. Would be great over rice or just a loaf of crusty bread to mop up the sauce. Can't wait to make this one again!! A friend who was there wants me to make it for his mother's 40th anniversary party!

The mix of this recipe's ingredients are unique and delicious (although on the salty side). I found 1/2 cup teriyaki and 1/2 c ranch along with the chicken juices, made about 2 cups of "sauce". We did not use that much sauce for 6 breasts, so I will use half amounts next time or use (it)in rice or pasta. I loved the quick and easy prep and using a bake-safe frypan(instead of a frypan AND a 9X13 bake dish), I only had to clean 1 big pan. Believe me, 500 people are not wrong. This is an excellent recipe!

This was VERY GOOD! My boyfriend absolutely loved it and said it was the best chicken he has ever had.  I did agree with some of the other reviewers that it was a little salty, but I didn't think it was overbearing.  I'm making it again today and this time I'm going to pre-marinate the chicken in the teriyaki sauce and ranch with some garlic for about an hour.  I'm hoping this will make the chicken even more juicy and flavorful than the first time!  Also, make sure when you add the cheese that it's not until the last 15 minutes or so because it will get quite hard and somewhat crusty if it is in the oven the entire time.

this was VERY good but with some changes-- First, you MUST use real bacon (I used 3 slices for 4 chicken breasts). Also, I only had teriyaki marinade not sauce so I marinaded the chicken for an hour and browned it in the same pan I cooked the bacon in (so I used the bacon fat instead of oil). I used sharp cheddar cheese and this dish was amazing! And the green onions are a MUST it gives it that great "creamy bacon and chives" flavor. Give this dish a try!!

Fantastic chicken...got thumbs up from everyone in the family!  I didn't have bacon bits, so I fried up 4 pieces of bacon, then browned the chicken in the bacon fat.  YUMMY!  This one is a keeper!!

This was wonderful!!!! The only thing I did was added garlic when I was sauteing 1/2 the onions with the chicken.  Also, I used less of the teriyaki sauce just to keep the sodium lower.  I usually dont like chicken breasts but this is FABULOUS and I will surely put this into my regular rotation!  Thank you!

WOW!!! I just had to try this based on the reviews, especially because of the odd ingredient combination. My husband LOVES this recipe. I wouldn't tell him what was in it until he tried it, as he can be very picky. With every bite he sang it's praises. Now he asks for it weekly, and even had me make it for our company on New Years. This is now on the top of our list of favorite recipes! I add the cheese in the last 10-15 minutes. Using a meat thermometer is key to getting your chicken cooked to the right temperature without overcooking it and drying it out.

Awesome recipe with a yummy choice of ingredients. Mix the teryaki sauce and ranch together.I would add more ranch though, and more cheese. I wouldn't skimp on toppings, thats what makes this recipe so good! I've made this a couple times.

One word, horrible. Not only did this recipe smell bad while baking, but tasted too salty and the mixture of teriyaki sauce and ranch dressing made the mixture taste like it had gone bad (soured). I even double checked the recipe to make sure I followed it right because of the rave? reviews it had received. Definitely will not make again.

I was looking for a different way to prepare Chicken and found this.  It is awesome.  We now make it all the time.  It is quick to put together yet special enough for company.  I have made it for potlucks and also for dinners to carry into people when they are sick because it is easy to grab and go.  Thanks so much for this recipe

This wasn't very good and I followed the directions exactly. It may have been just personal preference though. This was much too BBQ-y tasting for me. The flavors all overpowered each other.

I didnt brown it. I pounded my chicken so all pieces are same thickness this way they will all be done at same time. I find most people cook chicken for way to long. 19 min and they are usually perfect. Tender enough u won't need a knife. 35+ min and they're overdone. Other then that do NOT change a thing.

I was very excited to try this recipe, and followed it to a "T." I honestly could NOT eat a second bite.  I used Kroger 30 min teriyaki marinade and Kraft Classic Ranch dressing. I am not sure if the marinade was the problem or not, but I have used this brand before and liked it. The flavors did not meld together well at all. It was beyond salty, and I am the type who usually needs to add salt to everything! I will not be making this again, I wouldn't even want to try it using a different type of marinade after this. I actually had to quickly make a new main dish. Possibly using a different teriyaki would make all the difference.

Great tasting meal! I used real bacon instead of bacon bits and I used very little ranch and instead used a ranch dressing seasoning packet, wasn't expecting it to be as sweet as it was but it was a hit for my boyfriend and I!

Very good and so easy. I placed the chicken in a crock pot with teriyaki and ranch for 4 hours. Then added cheese, cooked bacon crumbles, and chives for the last 30 minutes.

I made this in the slow cooker.  It was so tender but had a very processed flavor (obvious from the ingredients).  We are not used to processed foods and would prefer a normal teriyaki or barbeque chicken.  Although it was easy, I will be looking for other recipes.  It is clear that we all have different taste buds.

I am the Kitchen Manager for a house of 60 college guys. I tried this recipe with them and definitely one of the favorite recipes of the year. This is saved just so we can have it again and had many guys begging to serve it again later on. This recipe is fantastic!

This was amazing! The only thing I did different was waited until that last few minutes to put the cheese on. That way it didn't burn or completely melt off but melted nicely

This is seriously delicious!  You wouldn't think all the flavors would go together, but they do!  I marinated the chicken in the teriyaki sauce for several hours, then browned the chicken with the marinade.  Placed in a dish, covered in ranch and baked until almost done.  Then I covered each piece of chicken with cheese, bacon bits and green onions.  I cooked until the cheese was melted and chicken was cooked all the way through.  Delicious!

The basis for this recipe is good. I found out that I really don't like the flavor of warmed up Ranch salad dressing. That was my only gripe. I couldn't stand to even smell it when my guy was eating the leftovers the next day.

This was very good! This has been waiting to be tried in my recipe box for so long! But I was always so hesitant to make it because I just couldnt think of eating a mixute of teriyaki and ranch cheese and bacon...It just seemed a little unusual...BUT i finally did! And we all loved it! I sauteed in pan and mixed together teriyaki and ranch and poured over the top in a baking dish. I then topped with cheese, bacon and green onion....SOOOOOO good and tender. It made the bottom of the baking dish a little watery but overal it was good!

I've made this twice now and LOVE it!  I made it the first time with light ranch and the second will reg. ranch and surprisingly I liked the light ranch better!  It's thinner and spreads out like a sauce more.  I also think it tastes better if you make it with olive oil vs. canola.  Like other reviewers, I added the cheese/bacon bits the last 10 min.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had some ranch dressing I needed to get rid of and some chicken breasts ready to be cooked so I decided to try this out. Man, am I glad I did! Was perfect combination of two flavors that really don't seem like they'd go together - ranch and teriyaki marinade. I took the suggestions of others and added bacon and cheese while chicken was already baking. This dish will be a staple in our house.

This was great!  I added mushrooms, and omitted the bacon bits because I used Bacon Ranch dressing.  I didn't cook the chicken first - I layered everything over the breasts, then cooked for 35 mins at 350.  So good!

I found this recipe OK. The flavoring just didn't do it for me. I would try it again, but my family found it interesting. I would try this again but I would modify it based on some of the suggestions from past reviewers.

Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm!  This was excellent -- although a little salty, I think because I used Kikkoman teriyaki sauce (will try another next time).  Did a mix of chicken breasts and pork chops, and my husband liked the pork better -- but I loved it all!  Also used provolone & mozzarella instead of cheddar (forgot to buy cheddar) and worked just as well.  Thanks!

Absolutely loved this! Kids loved it!! Hubby loved it!! Triple win... I used all the ingredients listed. Used real bacon instead of bits. Only mod I did was, pounded the chicken. I didn't precook. I just added chicken, ranch and teriyaki. Baked at 375 for 20mins. Flipped, baked for 15 mins added cheese, bacon (cooked it while the chicken was baking) and onions. Then finished for another 5 mins. PERFECT!!! Who ever wrote this recipe I

I just made this tonight for dinner. It was delicious!! Definitely going into my meal plan rotation. The mixture of teriyaki and ranch really go well together. Intead of bacon bits, though, (yuck) I cooked up some real bacon slices and laid them on the chicken and then covered with the cheese. Mmmmm so good, and my hard working hubby was pleased, as well. Served it with rice and steamed broccoli.

I made this today and it was delicious,  I fried real bacon (about 8 oz) and then browned the chicken in two tbls. of the bacon grease. I pounded the chicken so they cooked evenly.  As suggested I used the  teriyaki glaze instead of the sauce.  I used 3/4 tbls of glaze and ranch dressing for extra sauce. I mixed the glaze and ranch dressing together before pouring it on.  I added the cheese, onions, and crumbled bacon about 15 minutes before the end.  I served with a baked potato and broccoli.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for this recipe.

This would have gotten 5 stars if I had followed the recipe exactly, but since I didn't have any teriyaki sauce I had to improvise my own and it was a little too spicy  (I used soy sauce and hot Chinese sweet chili sauce with some ginger)  It was still delicious.  Purchased some real teriyaki and look forward to making it again soon with the right ingredients.

My husband and I loved this. I think I used a little too much sauce and ranch, so next time I will use a little less. Also I covered mine with foil for half the time so the cheese wouldn't burn or be dry. Other than that I followed this to a t and it was great.

REALLY liked this one.  The only changes I made was browning the chicken in bacon grease and I used boneless skinless breasts and thighs.I dd use a little less teriyaki than ranch (about 1/3 cup) as some others suggested.  I did not think it was salty.  Will make it again SOON!!

As is only three stars because it was a little bland.  I will make again but I will marinate the chicken in teriyaki first. Season with garlic, onion powder and pepper. I will probably use ranch powder as well. All in all it was ok as written

This was wonderful! I sliced russet potatoes lengthwise and placed them under the chicken breasts. Made for a great side dish! I also used cold leftovers the next day to make wraps...added lettuce, tomato, and a bit more ranch. Yum!

Oh my goodness! We had this for dinner tonight. Easy to prepare and fit for a king! Not really 'heart healthy'...but everything in moderation...right?  It was delicious! I used Jack Cheese instead of Cheddar. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. We will definitely have this again and again....in moderation, of course..haha! This is very impressive, if you're having company! I would serve this to Barack and Michelle!! It was THAT good!

This was all right. I substituted real bacon for the bacon bits, but otherwise kept the recipe the same. We didn't care for the ranch in this recipe, so it may be worth making again and omitting that step. Thanks for sharing.

I used bone-in breast, took a little longer to cook. Put the teriyaki mix on the breasts and 20 min. later added the cheese, onion and bacon bits. Di and Dani liked it. Me too. Butch not so much.

I was a little hesitant because the ingredients did not seem to go together, but boy was I wrong. My husband,Mr. Fussy, loved this and so did I. A great way to fix chicken for something different. I did not change a thing, except I forgot to get green onions so I didn't put those in.

As recommneded by a few others, I mixed the ranch dressing and teriaki sauce.  I also bought teriaki sauce, not marinade.  However, I did marinate the chicken breasts in 1/3 cup of the teriaki sauce for three hours prior to cooking. I used real bacon, which I think only added to the great flavor. Very very moist and delicious.  I will make again!

This was great.  A treat for the taste buds.  I had to make a few changes though.  Since I didn't have any teriyaki sauce I borrowed a recipe from "Baked Teriyaki Chicken" on this website.  I made sure it was nice and thick (which meant I didn't have to marinade it) and ended up mixing it with the ranch prior to putting it on the chicken.  It's all going to end up that way anyway, right?  I did not use any green onions, to my dismay, since my DH doesn't like them.  I ended up waiting until the last 15 minutes before adding the cheese.  It's definitely going to become a regular at my house.  I served it with rice and green beans...add a little extra sauce on that rice and YUMMY!

I am so shocked that I didnt like this with these reviews. It was too salty, and the flavors did not go well together. I am not sure how this is a tried and true recipe. I am not picky, but I fed it to my dogs!

Excellent!  I've had smothered chicken many times at restaurants & loved it. I knew there had to be something more than cheese, bacon & green onions.  I thought it was BBQ sauce, but the secret is the teriyaki & ranch combination! I marinated the chicken in teriyaki sauce & chopped garlic for an hour before cooking.  Not sure if this made a huge difference, but the chicken turned out moist and super flavorful!  Definitely a keeper recipe.

Thought this recipe was very good. I used real bacon instead of bacon bits. This added a great deal more flavor but also made the dish a little greasy. I will also marinate the chicken in the teriyaki sauce for a while instead of just basting it on top. I think this will help bring out that flavor a bit more.

I've made 10 recipies from this web site and this one is my favorite and fabulous (second favorite is the apple enchilada recipe).  I marinated skinless, boneless chicken breastover nite then slow cooked it for 5 hours-it fell apart and the aujus was incredible, like a wonderful soup.  I used 1/2 the bacon bits (1.5 oz hormel real bits) because I don't like one flavor to dominate a dish.   Like others I will somehow cut back the sodium levels and probably use real bacon.

Oh my gosh this was so good!! I used 4 boneless chicken breast and wished I'd made more! I used only 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce and almost 1/2 cup peppercorn ranch dressing. Omitted onions. This is one of the best boneless chicken recipes I've tried. I wished I had mushrooms to add to this but didn't have any. I added almost 1 full cup of cheese to 4 of these. You really can improvise with this. I would serve this anytime for any occasion! Thanks Vicki,we loved it!!

This was a great change from the usual "naked" chicken we have at our house. I did change the type of cheese used as we only had provolone and a "pizza" cheese blend around. Despite the change, the recipe won rave reviews from my boyfriend. I, personally, thought it was a bit salty and will try a reduced sodium tereyaki sauce in the future. To cut the fat slightly, we used fat free ranch dressing.

Okay for me, but husband enjoyed it. I would add more ranch dressing next time, and use real bacon bits as opposed to bottled.

I'm obviously in the minority here, but I thought it was a kind of odd combination of flavours. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I don't think I'll make this again.

This is better than any chicken dish you can find in a restaurant. I scaled the recipe down to four servings and used a 9x9 dish. I didn't have any of the sauces burning on the bottom of the dish. I also baked it for just 30 minutes.  I didn't have green onions so used chives instead. It was great.  My husband is ready for more.

The chicken needs to marinate in teriyaki sauce for an hour or so before cooking.  Just brushing it on didn't absorb much of the flavor.   I used ranch dressing with the bacon already in it. This is a very good tasting, moist and easy way to fix chicken breasts.

The taste of this recipe was good. I was not prepared for how it would look. 
The sauce was a runny grey milkly substance.  It doe not look very appetizing as
a carry in dish.  I don't know if I would make it again.

One of the most magnificent chicken recipes around!  The flavors blend together into a wonderful mixture of savory, juicy sauce over succulent chicken.  I made my own teriyaki marinade, the Easiest Teriyaki Marinade Ever on this site, and I halved the cinnamon amount in that and upped the soy sauce content.  I let the chicken breasts chill in the marinade for a couple of hours before completing the rest of the recipe.  I also made my own ranch dressing, Ranch Dressing II on this site, and used it instead of store-bought.  A wonderful outcome of flavors in a perfect meal.  I served it all over angel hair pasta slightly flavored with garlic butter and herbs, and I added more cheddar cheese than what this recipe calls for.  Like other reviewers suggest, I, too, recommend adding the bacon bits (use Real Bacon Bits, not the fake nasty stuff), green onions, and cheese during the last 10 minutes of cooking time.  You will not be disappointed by this one, folks.

GREAT recipe!  I didn't have the exact ingredients called for, but it works great with parmesan cheese (instead of cheddar) and dijon ranch dressing (instead of plain ranch).  Yummy! It's now a family favorite!

I was surprised how good this was.   I used thinly sliced chicken breasts and only browned them for about one minute on each side, and baked for about 20 minutes.  They were perfectly done.

As others suggested, make sure you use a teriyaki baste/marinade, and not regular teriyaki sauce.  The baste is thicker and I think adds more flavor. 

Served with some sauteed broccolini and small roasted potatoes.

Followed the recipe as written. I think the outcome is dependent on the brand of teriyaki glaze being used.  I used a name brand one but found the dish was far too salty for my liking.  I know bacon taste good on everything but this was stretching it... Don't think I would make this again, the combination was just not that good.

AMAZING!  My husband and I loved this dish!  We put extra teriyaki sauce in the bottom to cook it in.  So good and not much prep!  I will cook this again and I can't wait to eat the left overs!

Very flavorful!  If you have thick chicken breasts, they definitely need at least 40 minutes in the oven, NOT 25.

I love salt and this was WAY too salty.  The ingredients did not taste good together at all.  This is the 1st recipe from this site that just wasn't edible.  I'm shocked this has so many positive reviews....maybe others made major alterations...but I followed exactly and had to go grab fast food instead.  Ladies, skip this one.

Just wonderful! Marinaded the chicken for about 45 min, then cooked the it. Note to self: chicken burns easily when it's been marinaded! Caught it in time, but just a note. Didn't have teriyaki, so I had to make one with soy sauce, white rice vinegar, garlic, ginger, sugar, honey, etc. Worked out well. Truly a delicious recipe to mix it up. My husband took all the goop from the bottom of the dish and poured it on his rice cause it was so good! This will be a staple!

I had my doubts as well. So did my family. But I think with a few tweaks such as others people suggested it will improve. But I would make it again.

Way too salty. But my stepson loved it. I said, "too bad we can only have this 'anniversary' chicken once a year" and he said "Why?" and I said, "Because there is too much salt in it to eat it more than once a year." So I gave the recipe to him so he can make it in college.

I was looking forward to this all day, and when I finally ate it, it was just ok. My husband and daughter we're surprised that it was bland, because I don't normally brag about a recipe before I make it. I won't be making this again.

Yummy! As many others, I did not brown the chicken prior to baking. I felt it would possibly toughen it and not allow the sauce to seep in. Because I did not brown the chicken, I baked it a few additional minutes -- about 40 mins total.

I added half the cheese, onions and bacon before baking, then the other half about 20 mins into baking. It came out perfectly, with just the right amount of browning of the cheese.

I crumbled about 8 pieces of the pre-cooked Hormel bacon that we always have on hand and made ranch dressing by combining 1/3 c. each mayo/milk + 1 TBS dry ranch mix.

As others have mentioned, be sure to use the teriyaki glaze/basting sauce, not the watery marinade. Thanks for a unique and very tasty recipe!

Not impressed...the sauce cooked off the breast and left little flavor.  It just ended up burning on the bottom of the pan.  It sounded good, but the wife and I won't be trying this one again.

SOOOO GOOD!!! I made a few adjustments based on my time and what ingredients I had. First of all, I used FROZEN Chicken Tenderloins. I guess I could have thawed them, but I didn't feel like it. I also skipped the browning of the chicken, because I didn't see it as a necessary step. I also did not use any green onion or parsley. Simply put, I placed my frozen chicken tenderloins in a glass baking dish. Basted them with KC Masterpiece Honey Teriyaki Marinade. Poured on Kens Steakhouse Ranch dressing. Put on some fully cooked pre-packaged bacon that I broke up with my fingers. Lastly, used Kraft Mexican Blend Shredded Cheese. I covered the dish with aluminum foil and "PRESTO"! 35 Minutes Later, I had the BEST chicken EVER!!! It was a huge hit and SOOOO EASY!!!

Delicious! I wasn't sure about the flavors, but it worked. I didn't have teriyaki basting sauce and I find the store bought teriyaki way too salty. I combined teriyaki, soy sauce and honey and thickened it over the stove with cornstarch and water. When it was the right combo of sweet and salty I brushed in on the chicken. I didn't have shredded cheese so I put a small piece of cheddar on the chicken. I used real bacon, and probably more than 1.5 oz. But who can go wrong with bacon! I served over thin spaghetti. I think only a thin or angel hair pasta would work with this.

I marinated the chicken in teriyaki sauce overnight then before putting it in the oven I put a teriyaki glaze over the chicken.  It turned out with a great combination of flavors.  I did not use the bacon because we did not have any, and it still came out wonderful!  I also followed others suggestions and added the chese during the last 5-10 minutes of the baking cycle.

I REALLY liked this, but my husband, who is not picky, did not care for it. He thought it was too many flavors mixed together. I would make sure to pound out chicken as our breasts were a little too thick not allowing enough of the flavor absorb. I loved the sauce it made - very flavorful (not too much for me) - even sopped some of it up with my rice. I will try it in the crockpot next time as per another reviewer.

I didn't think this dish tasted as good as it looked.  The chicken had no flavor.  Maybe it should have been marinated in the Teriyaki sauce for a few hours?  I also think I would have preferred real bacon bits instead of the imitation variety.  I will try again, but next time, I will either pound out the chicken so it's thinner (or use chicken cutlets), and I will use real bacon.

This was great. I used normal bacon, cooked and crumbled. Threw everything in the crock pot (but the cheese and bacon) and cooked it for 5 hours on low. When the chicken was done, I topped it with the cheese and bacon and let it cook 15 more minutes to melt the cheese. YUM!

This was really good! I admit I was a bit surprised... despite the great reviews, I was pretty skeptical of teriyaki + ranch but it was quite yummy! Didn't do anything differently except to cook my own bacon and crumble - I've never even seen bacon in a can!

This was just an okay recipe for me, but my husband loved it!  He offered to make me another meal so that the leftovers could be reserved for him.  I couldn't find teriyaki basting sauce, so I just used a marinade and let the chicken sit in it for an hour or so.  I may have liked it better with more teriyaki flavor, so perhaps that was a bad change on my part.  I cooked and crumbled bacon instead of using a can of bacon bits, and I left off the green onions because my husband doesn't like them.  I probably would have preferred the chicken with the green onion and more bacon.  I thought it was kind of bland.  I also skipped the sauteeing and just baked the chicken for a little while before adding the other ingredients.

Followed recipe to tee, with exception of the bacon bits.  About the last ten minutes, I cooked bacon, crumbled and added over chicken. Also, I mixed the terriaki sauce and ranch together to give it a thicker base and then spooned over chicken and let it run down the sides(Use all of it)! I left the cheese out since we were having cheesy ranch potatos. Don't forget to spray the bottom of your pan with pam. This chicken gives the meaning back to 5 stars! My husband had to stop eating so he didnt make himself sick.

Okay, so I feel awekward giving this review since all the others are so very very postivie ,but this recipe just didn't work for me or my family. I think the mix of the teriyaki sauce and ranch was just not to our liking. The color was displeasing and the taste was "INTEREstING" to say the least - salty and a bit tangy with a hint of asian sweetness. The cheese on top definitely helps make the strong taste milder..but I don't think we will be having this again.

I just saw this yesterday and thought with all the good reviews I'd try it.  We all REALLY liked it.  I don't always measure, but did with this.  Even using the exact amounts, the salt level is pretty high, so don't add a little extra of any ingredient.  The flavors blend well and taste terrific!  We had it with rice and noodles--two of us had rice and two had noodles and everyone liked it.  New addition to our keepers file.  Thanks!!

I was hesitant to try this recipe....seemed like a stange combination of flavors, but I had most of the ingredients on hand so decided to try it.  Very tasty, my husband gave it high reviews and even my picky kids liked it.  I only made a few changes-used real bacon crumbled up instead of bacon bits and I didn't have green onions so I used chives instead.  We enjoyed it, I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is fabulous.  The only thing I changed was that I used the kikkoman baste and glaze.  It is thicker and really does a great job coating the chicken.  It has a great flavor!!

This was delicious! I couldn't find any teriyaki basting sauce so I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and it turned out great! Would love to try the teriyaki though. Will definitely make again. Thanks

This was absolutely delicious!  I didn't measure the cheese-just eyeballed it-used 2 pieces of bacon and 2 green onions per breast, and measured the teriyaki and ranch (used low fat).  Since my measurements were a bit different I only gave it 4 stars.  Plus, I used REAL bacon, and not yucky bacon bits from a can.  REALLY TASTY, and I'm making it again tonight.

I have made this recipe as written twice and it was wonderful both times. Yesterday I knew I wasn't going to be home to cook it, so I tried it in the crock pot and was very happy with the results. I put about 10 frozen chicken tender pieces in the crock pot, along with the teriyaki glaze, the ranch dressing, the bacon pieces and the green onion. After 1 hour I stirred to combined. Then 30 minutes before serving I added the shredded cheese. All together it cooked for about 2 hours 45 minutes on high. I served it over rice and it was delicious! Both my 8 and 4 year olds loved it. I will be making this again!

Wow! This chicken was really great. My husband and both of my children (all of which can be hard to please) absolutely loved it!! I followed the directions exactly...using Kens teriyaki/honey marinade/sauce. I did not use the entire 1/2cup of marinade....but perhaps should have used a little more. Other than that...YUMMM

It was ok. No real flavor. Everything was too mild, so you don't really taste the teriyaki, bacon, cheese, ranch dressing, or onions. Just kind of melds together. I won't bother to make it again. There are other recipes that pack more flavor that are just as easy.

Very good and easy too! I had to make my own Teriyaki Sauce(on AR,BY JUDY) and I just marinated the chicken in it while I chopped the onions, waiting for the fry pan to heat. I was out of RANCH dressing but used Green Goddess and it still came out great. I only baked the chicken long enough to melt the cheese, maybe 15 minutes but my chix breasts were fairly thin and didn't want to overcook them. We will be having this again! Thanks for a great recipe!

I have no idea why this is good but it works! I marinated my chicken in yoshidas for about 5 hours, browned, then baked with the ranch and cheese. I didn't have bacon on hand and it was still yummy! Will definetly be making this oddly delicious dish again!

This was just not a good combo of flavors..Ranch and teriyaki basting sauce just don't seem to pair up very well.Maybe too many flavors and nothing distinct enough to say "WOW that's good.." It was just weird...

My husband is in love with this chicken. I saw the ingredients were things he liked separately so I gave it a try. Very easy to make and he wants me to make it all the time. If I make another chicken recipe, he always says it is not as good as this one. It is easy to make too.

Unusual flavor combination for sure.  I would probably rate this a 2, but daughter and Husband really liked so it gets the 3 stars.  The taste is a bit on the salty and pungent side so I think it worked that I served with a mild orzo-rice combo to mellow it out.  I guess my tastebuds just prefer a more mellow flavor.  Too bad if they liked it, I don't think I'd make again ;)

How to make this less fat: You can get away making this dish with less fat but the flavor is still great.  I use real bacon but about one slice per serving.  I use just a sprinkling of soy sauce per breast and brush with low fat ranch and just sprinkle with shredded cheddar and the green onions.  Still a little fattening but not quite so bad but still totally delish!  Also I cut the breasts in half and pound to about 1/2 inch thick which speeds cooking time and makes the breasts really tender and streches the servings.  A favorite dish that really makes anynight special.

I was so hesitant at first but OMG! SO goooood! I marinated the chicken in the teriyaki sauce first, for about 30 minutes then sauteed the marinated chicken in a little bit of olive oil. My Husband is THE pickiest eater ever and he said it was the best thing I ever made?!?!?!? Seriously...So Good and way easy to make! =D

amazing combination of flavors & was so easy to put together.  this one is a keeper b/c i typically have these ingredients on hand. plus it's a different chicken dish than i'm usually making, so it's a nice change if you are bored of the same old chicken recipes. i pounded out 4 chicken breasts & was careful not to overcook them in the frying pan.  chicken was done sooner than 25 mins so keep an eye on the oven.  i also used real bacon instead of bacon bits & i think the flavor was probably far better than store bought bacon bits.  overall, delicious flavors & the chicken was kept moist by the ingredients on top.

This was good, but I dont think I could eat a big piece of chicken with the ranch and teriyaki, it did not taste as good by the end of my small chicken breast.  I did like many other reviewers and mixed the ranch and teriyaki together, as well as used real bacon and only added the cheese, bacon, and green onions for the last 10 minutes.  I will make this again, but like an anniversary, I think this would be best served once a year!

I didn't have any ranch dressing, so I used lowfat blue cheese dressing, which I had on hand (there weren't a lot of blue cheese chunks in the dressing, so I thought it could work). I used my personal favorite teriyaki, Mr. Yoshida's. I'd never bought bacon bits before, and was happy to see there was a real bacon bits product available. I was tempted to salt and pepper the breasts for sauteeing, but I held back, due to reviews stating the recipe was too salty. This recipe was FABULOUS!  My husband was amazed (as was I)! I served with seasoned rice and a green veg on the side.

I am always looking for good recipes that will feed the masses (big extended family) and this recipe is great for any size group.  I thought the flavors blended together terrific. I used regular bacon, and pounded the chicken a little before browning.  Definitely a keeper - thanks for the great recipe!

made this for dinner tonight, thought it was great.. didnt measure out the sauces or any of that, as there was only 2 of us eating and 2 pieces of chicken breast.. just poured a tiny bit of teriyaki in the bottom of the dish like one user suggested, placed the chicken on top of that, poured a little more teriyaki on top of chicken, globbed some ranch on, threw it in the oven.. made my own bacon bits.. dont like the store bought ones.. turned out really good and saucey lol, dont know if it was supposed to have all the extra sauce in the dish but we ate it anyways... will definitely be making this one again

I mixed the teriyaki and homemade ranch together and didn't saute the chicken first-just baked a little longer.  It sounds like people are using regular teriyaki sauce instead of teriyaki basting sauce - the two are different, regular teriyaki sauce is saltier.  Definitely use Teriyaki BASTING Sauce, because it's salty even this way.  Next time I won't put any salt in the ranch dressing.  May also leave off the cheese and bacon, could barely taste them, but the scallions definitely add a lot.

I was skeptical whan I read this recipe - I wasn't sure how the combination of teriyaki and ranch would taste.  I'm glad I trusted the reviews and tried it.  My husband took one bite and said "It's a keeper!".  I didn't have thick teriyaki sauce (as other reviewers recommended), so I substituted thick Caribbean Jerk sauce.  I brushed it on the chicken, then baked it for 10 minutes before adding the ranch and bacon bits.  I bakeed it an additional 10 minutes, then covered it with a four cheese blend and baked it for 10 more minutes.  I will definitely make this again and again!

I've made this a few times now with great results. I do use real bacon - about one slice per chicken breast. But recently I tried mixing the teriyaki and ranch together and I thought it was  quite an improvement. I also make it with double the sauce so we have a little left over to drizzle on a rice side dish.

This was so easy to prepare and the results are outstanding. This dish can be served for company and it makes it look like you cooked all day to prepare this dish. I used Lawry's Teriyaki Marinade and real bacon. I made the mistake of adding salt and it doesn't need it all. My dish came out a little bit salty but it was still delicious. I also added the cheese during the last 15 minutes of cooking.

My husband and I were not impressed at all.  The kitchen smelled great, the food looked terrific, but the blending of the flavors just left us with a wierd taste in our mouths.  It's ok... we ate it... but definitely will not make again.

This was so fast, it didnt take close to the time shown.  I did pour some terriyaki in a ziploc with the chicken for about 2 hours, as well as cooking fresh bacon and crumbling.  Then proceded as the recipe stated.  Very good!!

This chicken is the best.  My family requests it often.  My daughter is the pickest eater around, and she loves it.  Usually no leftovers.  I have passed this recipe along. Thanks!

After considering the comments by other reviewers, I made the recipe as stated, but cut the chicken into strips, browned them, and then baked with the other ingredients.  That method worked well.  However, I thought the sauce tasted odd.  Not bad, but just odd.  My very sweet husband said that he liked it, but after pressing him to find out what he REALLY thought he said "it has an unusual taste that is good for the first few bites, but then doesn't do much for me after that."  I agree.  It isn't bad, but I wouldn't make it again.  Plus, it is extremely unhealthy and if I'm going to splurge on something like that, it better be really good, not just below-average!

I made this recipe for dinner and liked it.  When I needed a dinner recipe for a banquet, I turned to this chicken recipe.  Everyone loved it & raved about it, even for a few days after the banquet.  I makes a nice presentation.  I browned the chicken the day before the banquet and left the chicken in the fridge overnight.  The day of the banquet I just topped it off and baked it.  Wondeful success!!

The first thing that came to my mind and my husband's when we tasted this was, "Midwest food" - Lots of food, with lots of sauce and kind of bland.  My husband (who grew up in the midwest & is a bacon-bits lover)and I agreed that it was interesting because of the unusual mix of ingredients, but overall the meal had a lot of "goop" and was rather tasteless.  We won't make it again, but obviously from the ratings, we're in the minority! Thanks for the post anyway!

Ok, I had very high expectations for this one. I used 6 slices of bacon and made it on the George foreman grill. I then put seasoned the chicken and also put them on the grill to quickly brown on both sides. This method worked great. It followed the recipe as written and it looked great and even smelled good. When we ate it though, was not too happy with the taste of the teriyaki and ranch together. My kids liked it and it wasn't the worse thing I have made. But the combination of the sauces were not good. I would make again with a change. Next time no teriyaki sauce and just use the ranch. The chicken was moist and it was easy though. So maybe it is just a matter of taste.

This rocked!  Huge hit with the whole family!  We aren't big on teriyaki sauce, so I only used 1/8 a cup, could still sense the sweetness of it, but wasn't overwelming.  The combination of ingredients is unusual sounding (I didn;t want my hubby to see what was in it cause I knew he'd turn up his nose), but great together!  During dinner my hubby said he tried not to like it, but that he actully really enjoyed it!  Very easy, I will be making this again soon.  We had 1 breast left over (I have a family of 4), and we were all fighting over who got the leftovers for lunch the next day.

I found this to be an excellent recipe.  The flavors combined very well.  I only made a couple changes.  I wrapped the chicken breasts in Proschuitto and used a low sodium teriyaki sauce to compensate.  Recipe was wonderful.  Everyone loved it.

this recipe has become a standard in my home.  thanks so much for it.  each time i make it i seem to change it up a little...but always stick to the basics.  sometimes i use chicken thighs...sometimes i use real bacon...sometimes i eliminate the bacon...
last week i had not bacon and used sliced cherry tomatoes on top (i added it on the last 10 minutes of baking along with the cheese).  we really enjoyed it that way too.

BE CAREFUL with that Teriyaki Sauce!! Too much is too much. Just baste the chicken. If you use the entire 1/2 cup its VERY salty!! My family liked it and I will definilty use agian. I am going to try it w/ the Honey BBQ sauce next time.

Yum!  I marinated the Chicken in Low Sodium Teriyaki for about 4 hours, then put it in the pan (didn't brown) and brushed on some of the remaining marinade, spooned over ranch dressing, sprinkled with 12 a finely chopped white onion, then the cheese and about 9 strips of crispy crumbled real bacon.  My husband ate 2 pieces-- and he never does that with chicken!  I really liked it a lot too and will definitely make again.  I baked for about 40 min since was raw when I started baking.... thanks for this great recipe!

I found this recipe to be delicious.  Some people found it to be too salty, and that might be from the brand of teriyaki sauce they're using. I also lined my pan with foil for easy clean-up.  My hubby loved this, so it's a keeper!

This was excellent.  I marinated the chicken in the teriyaki sauce for a few hours.  I browned the chicken longer than stated on a med-low heat and I used olive oil, not vegetable.  I used more more ranch dressing than stated because I wanted more juice.  I didn't have green onions so I used a chopped yellow onion and I did use bacon bits because of the convenience.  We also had mashed potatoes...and the juice from the chicken mixed with the potatoes...yum!  Thanks Vicki!

"Really Good", ans Super Easy too make !!!
  I did switch Swiss Cheese for the cheddar, mainly because of the High Oil content in Cheddar?
  And the swiss I feel is more complex in flavor!
  Family loved it, and has informed me, that I need make this a couple times a month!!!

My husband and I both loved this recipe! I made only 2 chicken breast halves and just winged the recipe. I used sweet onion (on hand) in place of the green onion and put the onion on the chicken before the cheese. I used cheese on hand, which was Italian Blend. I browned the chicken in an iron skillet so I was able to finish off the recipe in the same skillet! This is a yummy recipe and will make again.

This chicken was alright. There were TONS of positive reviews for this so I've been wanting to try it.  My husband and I made it last night for dinner. I didn't think it was anything spectacular. I didn't have much ranch dressing, so maybe by adding more it could be better. I just didn't think there was a ton of flavor.

It was alright, but I have other recipes I liked a lot better. I doubt I will make it again. Sorry.

I made this recipe in the morning.  I browned the chichen, and then put the whole recipe together in the baking dish.  I refrigerated it, took it out about a half hour befor baking.  It was the BEST boneless chicken I ever made! And the easiest!  Jeanne

I was a bit disappointed when I first served this recipe - the topping was tasty but the chicken just tasted like plain chicken, although my guests said they really enjoyed it.  However, the next day the leftovers were really yummy as the flavours had blended through.  Next time I will marinate the chicken in the ranch dressing and teriyaki sauce overnight.  Otherwise, the cheese, bacon and green onion topping was excellent and the overall taste of an unusual combination of ingredients was delicious!

This turned out okay. The chicken was moist, which was its saving grace. I made my own teriyaki glaze and used regular Hidden Valley ranch dressing, topped with bacon bits and mozzarella cheese. Per some suggestions I covered the dish with foil while baking. The cheese and bacon bits slid off during cooking, which didn't leave a very nice presentation. The sauce had good flavor but the ranch dressing made for another unsavory look. Next time I will combine the teriyaki and ranch before pouring over the chicken, and then add the cheese and bacon bits (or real crumbled bacon) after they come out of the oven.

Oh my goodness is this delicious! I happened to have all the ingredients on hand except the teriyaki. I substituted soy sauce instead and what a great contrast to the creamy ranch dressing. Great combination of ingredients. My husband announced as he was taking his last bite of 2nds, " make this again!"  And I will! Thanks for a great recipe :-)

The ranch flavor was rather off-putting.  If you love ranch, you'll probably love this.  If ranch isn't your favorite thing, you may want to give this one a pass.

This had way too much going on, flavor-wise, and it was SUPER salty. Sounded great in theory, but really didn't please us in practice. Not making this one again, sorry.

Awesome!! After reading a few reviews and adding my own twist, this came out great! Here is what I did:
First, I greased the bottom and sides of a 9x13 pan with coconut oil, then placed 7 small RAW chicken breast halves (could have fit 2 more) in the pan. I thoroughly mixed together the Teriyaki sauce and Ranch Dressing in a measuring cup and poured this over the chicken. Then I sprinkled dried chopped chives over all. I didn't have time this morning to cook bacon, (plus I don't like bacon) but I buy pre-sliced pepperoni and had some in the refrigerator, so I used my small 2 cup food processor and chopped up about 1/2 cup worth to make crumbly and sprinkled it over each piece of chicken, then topped with the cheddar cheese. I covered the pan with foil and baked it at 200 degrees (equivalent to a slow cooker on low) and baked for 6 hours. Very Very moist and tasty!! :)

Terrific! Mixed 1/2 c ranch with 1/4 c teriyaki for sauce to cut down on salt, pounded chicken for tenderness, used real bacon, put cheddar on half way through baking. Definitely a keeper!

Not bad like the teriaky ranch combo even though at first glance it sounded weird. But I think it could use more veggies and I seasoned the chicken with some pink salt and cracked pepper while cooking in the pan thank u for the idea! Goes great with twice baked potatoes!

This was awesome! I didn't really change anything, the cooking directions made delicious moist chicken. I made the bacon first, then browned the chicken in the bacon grease. I used maui waui teriayaki marinade and kens steakhouse ranch dressing. I just poured the ingredients over the chicken carefully then placed uncovered for about 30 minutes and it was perfect.

This is a great recipe! My husband loved it and so did I.  Some reviewers noted that this recipe was too salty, but they had to have been using the wrong ingredients like soy sauce instead of teriyaki because we had no problem with an overly salty flavor.  Cannot really describe the flavor of the chicken other than it was really good. I followed the directions and did not make any changes except that I did cover my baking dish with foil which I feel kept the chicken from drying out and the cheese from burning/crisping and I also cooked up bacon and crumbled for the bacon bits. I also agree with another reviewer about using Lawry's teriyaki marinade it was perfect, not too runny but not too thick.  I served this with fully loaded baked potatoes and it was awesome!  Highly recommend trying this recipe, it was delicious!

After pulling out chicken breast for lunch I realized I didn't have anymore lemon pepper to make my usual. So I looked on here to find a quick and easy way to cook my chicken. The only thing I didn't have was green onions which I probably wouldn't have used anyway due to the fact I don't care for them.  This was a great easy way to make chicken quickly. I will definitely be make this again when the hubby is hm next time. The only thing I did differently was spread butter on bottom of my baking dish to prevent sticking and just because I'm a firm believer that everything is better with butter. This way I had a lil sauce to put on top of my chicken. Also I cut down the baking time to 20 mins due to the fact that I was only cooking 2 chicken breast and I didn't want it dry. I would recommend this friends and family anytime. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a great dish - I read many of the reviews and was a bit hesitant about trying it but was very happy with the results. Not sure why many find it so salty but I didn't have any issue - maybe the types of dressing or sauce really affect the end result. Used real bacon bits as suggested by many (I have never liked "fake" bacon bits anyway!)and the family loved it. Will enter into the rotation for sure.

I made this recipe and it was easy enough but the visual on this sauce is less than appealing. You eat with sight and smell before taste and the look of the teriyaki mixed with the ranch is like med. mud color. The taste is okay but nothing that I would be anxious to make again and I would not serve it due to the above . It was a one time recipe for me. Not a wow dish and visually not appealing. I'll pass

Made this the other night and the whole family LOVED it! My husband who doesn't care for teriyaki sauce or onions of any kind, loved it! My 1 yr old and 5 yr old chowed down. And we had a guest and he couldn't stop talking about how good the house smelled while it was cooking, or how good it was after we ate! I fried my own bacon and chopped it up instead of using premade bacon bits. Went well with a cup of wine ;)

Absolutely delicious! My fiance raved for days and told me to start making more chicken dishes. I like a little extra kick so I added 4 green onions instead of three. I also waited until the last 10 minutes to add the cheese and bacon. yum  yum

Absolutely love it. Didn't have green onions or parsley, but was delicious without. Served with corn on the cob and red potatoes.

I absolultey LOVE this recipe.  I don't know why it's taken me so long to review it.  I've made it several times.  I made a pared down version last night with 4 skinless, boneless thighs.  Trying to watch calories lately so I used 1 T terriyaki baste and glaze, 1 t ranch, 3/4 oz cheddar, and 1/2 T bacon bits per thigh and it was perfect and about 380 cal *smile*.

kids thought it was yummy! For the Bacon- I usually bake a pound of bacon at 375 for 20-30 minutes. Remove and blot with paper towels and then freeze and use whenever bacon bits are called for..easy and better than store bought!

Not going to make this again. Used extra ranch and teriyaki baste and it still ended up pretty bland. All I could taste was the bacon.

This was good. I used the already fully cooked bacon and it turned out great. Was a little salty to me but no one else seemed to notice. Will make again!

Soooo soooo good!
I did not fry the chicken first - I just put the breasts in a baking pan and added the ingredients.  I know some of the reviewers used real bacon, but I found that the bacon bits added a deep smokey flavor that complimented the dish extremely well.

This was good.  I marinated in teriyaki (regular, not the thick) overnight, then cooked as directed. I thought it was good, but no comments from the table.

Simple and fast, this dinner comes together with minimum fuss.  Husband loved it and we both took leftovers for lunch next day.  Make exactly as written, next time I may increase the sauce measurements to have more to spoon over the pasta.   YUM!

Given the ingredients and cooking method, this recipe was pretty much what I expected...not fabulous, but fairly decent. I had to improvise a bit...didn't have the basting sauce, so I used 1/3 c teriyaki sauce, and an eyeballed amount of honey and minced garlic. I seasoned my thin-cut chicken breasts with pepper and garlic/onion powders. I browned the chicken as directed, but because the breasts were already the thin-sliced variety, I only had to bake 10-15 min at 350. Next time, I would skip the browning altogether. Baked on a parchment paper lined baking sheet (why scrub a baking dish, given the teriyaki glaze is likely to burn?) Didn't measure the cheese, ranch dressing, or bacon bits (used the Oscar Meyer real bits), but rather I used the desired amount of each on the chicken, and finished off with a few shakes of dried parsley to dress it up. Had to omit the green onion simply because I didn't have it. Husband devoured this...I thought it could use some tweaking, but I will make again with some changes. I'm excited to use this recipe as a stepping stone to put my own spin on it!

I've kept this recipe for a few months without making it, because I was a little leery of the ingredients. I finally made it last night, and it was wonderful. I don't know why, but the ranch and teriyaki just seemed to work together. I will be making this again, although I think i'll marinate the chicken in the teriyaki first.

This is a must in our house. I am a salt lover so I have no problems with salty food. I have made it several ways and this is the best I have come up with. Mix the teriyaki sauce half and half with ketchup. Fry the bacon and then brown the chicken in the bacon grease. Transfer to oven and brush with teriyaki mixture. Let cook 5 minutes and brush again at this time add the ranch. Cook 10 more minutes add the cheese and bacon for the last 5 minutes of cooking then sprinkle with green onions. Muah Perfect!

This was delicious!  It was easy to make (my three-year-old son helped me with it), quick and full of flavor.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, 4 chicken breasts instead of 6, for the ranch I used light sour cream mixed with a ranch seasoning packet to save on fat and calories and in place of the bacon bits, I browned up some turkey bacon and put that on top.  Both kids (3.5 & 1.5) ate it and thought it was good (that's a winner in my book!).  My husband said, that it's a keeper!  It reminded me of a twice baked potato, only instead of all the carbs you're getting a lean protein.  You could make it even more diet-friendly by using less teriyaki and reduced fat cheddar cheese. I will try that next time.  This recipe is a WINNER!

Very good.   Husband loved it.    I brushed the teriyaki on before I sauted the chicken.  Seemed to lock in the flavor better than combining the sauces in the oven.   It gave the chicken a nice brown color too.   Kept everything else the same.

Very good!  I made it more diet friendly, using low sodium teriyaki sauce, yogurt ranch dressing, part skim cheddar cheese, and turkey bacon.  It was delicious and fell right into my P90X nutrition plan.  Score!

I have made this dish three times and every time it is a hit with the family!!!  I read several reviews regarding the saltiness of the chicken, my guess is using the wrong teriyaki sauce.  Although it is not an "authentic" teriyaki sauce, I always use Yoshida sauce (available at Costco in the big jug)  and nothing I have cooked with this sauce has ever been too salty.  BTW, I followed directions loosely without changing ingredients, except the bacon bits, I used fresh.  Oh, and just squirt the ranch right from the bottle onto the chicken, why wash another spoon?!

Very good! I took the advice of some other reviewers and this turned out sooo tasty for a low-carb diet! First I cooked the chicken until it was just brown on the outside, then threw it in a gallon ziplock bag with hoison sauce and soy sauce because I didn't have any teriyaki. Let it marinate for 20 minutes while the oven is preheating. I also used real bacon and didn't put the bacon or cheese on until the last 10 minutes of cooking. Very very tasty and will try it with teriyaki next time!

This is delicious!  I made a few changes.  I mixed the teriyaki sauce and ranch together, and used more dressing, and marinated the chicken in it for about an hour.  I then put the chicken in a baking dish and poured the remaining mixture over it and baked for 35 minutes, adding the cheese and bacon the last 5 minutes.  I cut out the onion completely.  This turned out so incredibly moist and delicious, I've made it time and time again!

Really good!  Chicken turned out really moist and you can never go wrong with bacon and cheese!  All we had was a thin marinade style teriyaki sauce and next time I would like to try a thicker sauce but otherwise everyone loved it!

I would only give this one star if it were up to me as I thought this was awful but my husband loved it. Not my idea of good at all, I can not understand what everyone loves about this dish. I marinated my chicken for a couple hours in laury's teriyaki sauce and I used fresh crumbled bacon and even that didn't help.

Marinated chicken in teryaki sauce for 2 hours first because we didn't have the basting sauce. Fried in olive oil (use on heat #4 or 5 with a lid so it doesn't splatter too much) for just a minute or two on each side. Baked for 35 minutes. Perfect!

Outstanding recipe!  I  have never made this chicken that someone hasn't asked me for the recipe. I did use a little butter and olive oil instead of vegetable oil and poured the teriyaki over the chicken while I was sauteing it. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

This was good...but not as delicious as I was expecting with the number of positive reviews that it has.   I will try it again, probably in the slow cooker next time.  I will use fresh bacon next time and saute the chicken in some of the grease.  Interesting flavor.

I was so excited to try this after seeing the high ratings received, but for me this was an average dish.  I had all the ingredients on hand, even the teriyaki basting sauce, and didn't feel this was anything to write home about.  I couldn't taste the ranch dressing or the green onions at all.  I browned the meat as the recipe said, but debated as to whether I should put everything on top of the meat raw and cook it that way.  I did add the cheese and bacon during the last 15 minutes as some suggested.  I don't know.  This is probably not something I will try again.

I couldn't believe the ranch and terryaki combo when I first saw it.  But, I decided to try it based on the reviews.  This chicken was so good!!  Delicious!

Put it all in the crock pot & turned out pretty good.  Husband gave it a 5 (and kids ate it all up)- I personally thought it was a 4 though.  Will make again.

This was the absolute best chicken! Tender, moist and flavorful!  Definately a keeper!  I put the cheese on during the last 10 minutes as did others.  We had company that evening and everyone thought it was amazing, including me who can be extreamly critical of my own cooking.  Thanks again! Loved it :)

Delicious!!!  The only change I made was instead of the bacon bits I used real bacon pieces.  They are sold right next to the bits.  My husband said it was something right off Top Chef.  This will for sure be made many more times in our house.

Made this last night. Didn't have bacon bits. But the family still ate it up. I can hardly wait to try it with bacon in it. Thanks.
Update: We've made this several times as written and making a few tweaks like: no bacon, regular onions vice green onions, real bacon vice canned or bagged bacon, even different cheese. Bottom line, we like it every time. This has been a great start to many nights of enjoying chicken breasts. I still give the original recipe 5 stars as written. But don't be afraid to tweak it for taste or what you have on hand. One more thing, the Teriyaki sauce is something we always use and something we've always used.
Thanks for sharing.

One of the easiest and tastiest dishes I've made from those here on All Recipes.  I followed the recipe as written but only used 4 chicken breasts instead of 6.  Apparently that was not a problem because we devoured this chicken in one sitting.....all four breasts (there were just two of us)!

Made this for supper last night just as written, except I grilled the chicken breast on a preheated gas grill for 5 minutes per side avoiding frying the chicken breast and adding fat to the recipe. Then I placed the breast in a baking dish and cooked as written. Everyone loved the chicken, it comes out moist and tender. Next time I may add some roasted garlic or even Jalapeno to some of the breast to add a little spice.

This recipe came into my email yesterday and it looked interesting and easy to make. I was a little skeptical with the combination of teriyaki sauce and ranch dressing. I made a little sample of the sauce before I started cooking to make sure it was edible and it wasn't that bad. I followed the recipe less the parsley. When it was done, the sauce was a bit soupy. Served it to my family + my nephew. They all loved it. My nephew said it awakened his taste buds. For me, I thought it was good. Maybe next time I make this, I'll marinade it for a while to get the favors to penetrate so it doesn't come out soupy.

This was fantastic!!  I marinated the chicken for a couple hours w/ my teriyaki sauce (I did not have the basting sauce)  Then I forgot to brown it.  I just dumped it into a pan, poured ranch over the top and let it bake.  After about 1/2 hour I topped w/ cheese and bacon bits and put it back in for 5-10mins.  I served with baked potatoes but I think it'd be great with rice!  My DD (whose 6) thinks I could put it all the the crockpot, even the potatoes and veggies!  She loved it!  ***UPdate**  I made it in the crockpot & it's just as good!  I marinated in the teriyaki for a couple hours.  Then put cut up potatoes then chicken then mixed calif veggies in crockpot.  (put ranch over the chix) Cooked on high for 4 hours then put on cheese and bacon bits for another 1/2 hour!

I had high hopes for this recipe given all the good reviews.  I followed the recipe exact, except for using real bacon - and my husband and I just didn't like it.  I think it was the teriyaki/ranch combo that got us.  Perhaps I would try it again and use one or the other, but not both together.

This was very delicious. My family loved it. I used the pampered chefs jamacian jerk rub instead of teryaki, and I used ranch dressing . I didn't have the cheddar cheese, and so I used taco cheese. It was awesome  I will definately make it again.

So here's the deal.  It completely depends on the ranch and teriyaki sauce that you use.  I use Uncle Dan's ranch (prepared) and Yoshida's gormet teriyaki.  It turs out great, and everyone at the table loves it.  Probably explains the mixed reviews.

This dish turned out great!  I did not have green onions or parsley, so left them out and cooked up 1 strip of bacon for each piece of chicken.  I cooked the chicken 4 minutes on each side in the pan and then 35 in the oven.  Turned out really moist, and the flavor was great.  Only problem was a large portion of the cheese and bacon slid off while cooking in the oven.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers.

My DH and I really enjoyed this dish.  As many had suggested, I put the bacon(turkey) on top of the chicken during the last 15 min. or so.  I paired the chicken with asparagus and angel hair pasta mixed with tomatoes, olive oil, seasonings, crushed garlic and green onions. YUMMY!!!  Will make again.  Also shared with co-worker; she loved it.

Tasted so yummy! Didn't cook the chicken beforehand though. Let it marinade for a few hours in the teriyaki sauce (didn't have "basting" sauce, just used regular). Mixed sauce from the bowl the chicken was marinading in with the ranch dressing and poured it directly on the chicken before placing in the oven. Put cheese on the last 10 minutes of cooking. Took around 40 minutes to cook. Family really enjoyed this dish, thanks!

WOW!!! I loved this recipe. The difference in flavors really appealed to my senses. I only had 4 breasts so there was more sauce to go around. Followed everything else. Love it, love it, love it!

This was absolutely wonderful.. I browned the chicken breast with chicken seasoning on the in bacon fat that was left over from cooking the bacon that goes on top. I added the ranch dressing to cover and baked for 10 mins then added  more ranch and cheese and baked another 20 mins. After the 30 mins total i added the crumbled up bacon pieces and spooned the stuff in the bottom of the pan on top and baked for 5 more mins. ( i used very thick chicken breast ) It was so juicy and wonderful! not salty at all.. My husband loved it and said it was one of the best recipes I have tried so far!  will definitely be making this more and often!! Thanks for sharing!

Yummy stuff.  Guess I'm not the only one who was skeptical of teriyaki and ranch LOL, but it was surprisingly good.  And fairly filling for chicken.  Made as is except I usually cook in Pam instead of oil, and used real bacon.  I suspect half the teriyaki sauce is enough, and that's even considering I spooned some of the extra liquid over the top before eating - there was still leftovers.  I suspect this recipe isn't as difficult as I made it.  I usually just use soy sauce instead of buying a jar of teriyaki sauce, and at the last minute decided to dig up a recipe on here for it.  So I had to stop and make that, & it still just tasted much like soy sauce.  I don't like ranch on salads so never have ranch dressing around, so got the bright idea to buy the HV mix and just make part of it up.  So I had to stop and make that too.  (And it has fresh milk so unlike bottled kind, I have to now get it used up!)  And then cooked up real bacon.  If all I'd done is nuked a bit of bacon in the microwave and nothing else, I'm sure this would've been easy.  Hmm... my own fault.  But was mostly worth it.  And had leftovers that were almost as good heated up.

For some unknown reason, it has taken me 6 years to try this top-rated recipe, and how sad I am for that lost time!!  My husband said this was one of the best chicken recipes I have made, and I agree!  I made this for 2, so I just eyeballed all measurements.  I marinated the chicken in the teriyaki sauce for 1 hour (vacuum sealed in a canister), then breaded the breasts with panko bread crumbs before sauteing.  I was out of ranch dressing, so made some with the seasoning packet (because of the salty comments, I subbed garlic and onion powders for some of the Ranch seasoning).  I used mild Cheddar and real bacon on top of the chicken, no green onions.  I though the final presentation was nice, I didn't get the "gross" color that others have mentioned.  Result was very moist and delicious.  Thanks so much for a new favorite chicken recipe!

This was definately a good chicken recipe. It isn't AMAZING but it's a nice rotation into the chicken dinner. Husband was very satisfied also.

Great recipe. I used a whole chicken, cut up, made a homemade teriyaki sauce, baked until the sauce thickened on the chicken pieces then put the ranch, cheese and bacon bits on. I broiled a few minutes at the end to brown the cheese. Will definately make again!

Made this the other night and it was fantastic! The only change I made was substituting the teriyaki marinade with Citrus Grill marinade because it was the only thing I had on hand. It was suprisingly tasteful even though I did not think it would mesh well with the ranch. Will absolutely make again. Thanks!

This recipe should be renamed AMAZING chicken.  I actually loaded my chicken into the crockpot and then added the rest of the ingredients.  I served over white rice.  It was a hit with my family, including my picky 5 year old.  I did find it a bit too salty, but I believe that is due to my slow simmering for 5 hours.  I will cut back on the teriyaki sauce a bit and the bacon bits.  Regardless, it was still delicious and fall-apart-excellent served over the rice.

This was okay, but we're not huge fans of it.  Reminded us of a 1950's church cookbook recipe.  Basic recipe, basic taste.

I did coat the chicken with flour before frying and used regular bacon instead of bacon bits.  I added the cheese and bacon during last 10 minutes of baking time.  Very good, will make again.

Wow! This really had awesome flavor! My hubby absolutely loved it. It's hard to find ways to really spice up chicken but this recipe does the trick! Notes-I did put the chicken breast in a container with the teriyaki marinade over night. I created a makeshift foil packet around the chicken breasts and totally enclosed them for all but 10 minutes of the cooking time. Last 10 minutes I added the cheese and let the chicken cook uncovered. It came out so incredibly moist and juicy! Great recipe!

UPDATE: MADE THIS AGAIN (WITH SAME MODS AS LAST TIME), BUT INSTEAD OF BROWNING MY CHICKEN IN OIL, I FRIED UP 3 PIECES OF BACON (I HALVED EVERYTHING) AND RESERVED THE GREASE FOR THIS STEP. NOT ONLY DID I SAVE $'S I WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE SPENT ON BACON BITS, I ADDED A LOT OF EXTRA FLAVOR BY DOING SO. MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE HEALTHIEST OPTION, BUT IT SURE IS A TASTY ONE LOL! :) Pretty good.... My bf enjoyed this (a HUGE plus!), but I'm on the fence. I thought this was a tad bland. All I could taste were the seasonings (I sprinkled each breast with a touch of salt, pepper and garlic powder) and either teriyaki OR ranch (which didn't seem to blend well together...). Tip: use a NAME brand, high quality teriyaki GLAZE, NOT marinade (there IS a difference between the two). Marinade is THIN and not intended for basting! As many others have done, I too baked my (browned) chicken for 15 minutes, then topped with the "garnishes" and baked for an additional 15 minutes. Perfect! Served with fresh grilled corn on the cob and "loaded" herb mashed potatoes (with MORE melted cheese, bacon and green onion on top - Yum!). Thanks for sharing, VICKI! This was not bad at all. :-)

I was really shocked at how good this was! The only thing I did differently was marinate the chicken in garlic teryaki for a couple of hours before cooking.

I'd get a divorce if this was my anniversary dinner!! This was very "eh" and not something I will ever make again. Only thing I did different was cook chicken without browning first (just cooked it longer) and used real bacon which I cooked on top of the chicken. I assure you these steps did not make any difference in the final taste. This was no magic combo of ingredients. A stellar chicken recipe this is NOT.

My favorite!  SUPER easy, SUPER yummy.  I have used frozen chicken breasts, but you have to almost double the cooking time to make sure it's cooked properly. I didn't put the cheese on until half way through then left the foil off for the remainder so the cheese doesn't go crispy.  I have topped with real crumbled bacon or with bacon bits, and have used onions and chives...any of them work.  I get rave reviews when I make this for company.

Only thing different I did was use skinned chicken thighs. My oldest boy was the only person who liked this recipe. The chicken was good only after I scraped the toppings off. Even then, it was a bit salty. I plan on using the remaining chicken for chicken salad. I won't be making this again.

I made this recipe last weekend and it's definitely a keeper. I marinated the chicken breasts in the teriyaki sauce, as suggested by other reviewers. The chicken was very moist and the combination of flavors was different, but very good! Highly recommended!

I followed this recipe exactly except for the parsley, (my daughter said she would just take it off)LOL. I used the real bacon bits (you have to refrigerate these after opening.)I was going to take a pic but we ate it too fast.  A neighbor was over and he said it was great.  I have to make some more tonight because my daughter didn't get any.  Oops.  I made asparagas with it.  Rice would also be good.  I cooked it longer, I think it was about 50 minutes.  Me and my well done taste buds.  The green onion and bacon together with the cheese made the kitchen smell awesome when I was cooking this, I couldn't wait for it to be done.  I will try to get a pic tonight to add, but I can't promise anything.  I made this recipe again and I didn't have the bacon or the scallions, so I added parmeson cheese, garlic salt and seasoned salt.  My daughter really liked this too.

This was the BEST chicken recipie my family has tried thus far..... I tried it in the slow cooker but it ran longer than I thought so I had to crank it up high. I did not measure the amount of ranch dressing I used, just poured it on. Also used alot of cheese, chopped green onions and LOTS of bacon bits. Used a bit less margarine than the recipie. DEFINATLY will have to make it again and again and again!

What I do on this site is make all the 5 star recipes I can, you can't go wrong making a recipe everyone else likes right?  This is the first time that backfired!  The taste of ranch and teriyaki and bacon was just awful.  I like them all independently so I can't believe I am bashing a 5 star recipe!  It was really bad~

This was great!  It was very easy to make and my husband & I really liked it.  Followed the recipe, except only had bacon-ranch dressing on hand so used that.  Husband's not a big fan of boneless chicken breasts so might try boneless thighs next time.

This was very good!! I did what other reviewers have done and marinated the chicken in teriyaki sauce overnight. I also added the cheese and bacon bits 15 minutes before I took it out of the oven, and that turned out well. :)

This was very tasty! What I liked most about it was how easy and quick it was. My 1 and 7 yr old both loved it. My 7r old woke up and wanted more for breakfast! I mixed the teriyake (I used baste and glaze) and the ranch together before pouring on chicken and had no issue with any funny color. I also lightly seasoned the chicken with red pepper tabasco Lawrey season salt for a little kick. Served with garlic mash pot and steamed broccoli and the whole meal was done in 30 from start to finish! Love that!

Very tasty and easy to make.  I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing and it was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  This is a keeper.  Thanks,

This recipe is SO good! Just marinade the chicken in teriyaki for at least an hour before hand - the longer the better. DONT skip the ranch, I don't like ranch dressing but I used it anyway (just a thin layer on each chicken breast) and it REALLY adds to the recipe in a good way. Also, put the cheese and bacon on just for the last 5 minutes if you like it gooey, 10 minutes if you want it a little crisp. GREAT RECIPE!

this is a great recipe. The ranch was a little too much, although I think if I could have found a restaurant quality ranch dressing it would have been better. so next time I will use half ranch half sourcream. or maybe the powdered ranch mixed with sourcream.

We didn't like this at all.  The ranch dressing gave it a strange tang that made my husband think the chicken had gone bad.
It was also very salty.

I expected so much more from this, all the ingredients sound so good.  It didn't have much flavor besides the cheese and bacon, mine came out dry, but I know stoves/ovens are different depending on where you live.

Loved it - easy and delicious. The sauce tasted like creamy teriyaki and I am not a fan of Ranch dressing at all. I always use lite teriyaki/soy when I cook with them. There is a lot less sodium in lite and I think the flavor is better. I added the cheese, bacon and green onions during the last 10 minutes - otherwise no changes. Thanks for a delicious recipe.

Where is the one billion stars button???? This is absolutely, hands down THE BEST chicken I have ever had. Both the bf and I LOVED it and can't have enough of it! I did marinade the chicken in Yoshida teriyaki sauce for almost 24 hours prior to baking. I also used real bacon (cooked in the microwave, super easy) and mozarella instead of cheddar cheese. Oh and try Newman's Own Ranch Dressing - everything they make is fabulous, and I do believe my choice of ranch made a difference in this recipe. Must try. Absolutely fantastic!

This is really good!  Who knew that teriyaki and ranch would be good together?  I used the Kikkoman Basting Glaze, and mixed it with the ranch before spooning on the chicken.  I also added the cheese and bacon during the last 10-15 minutes.  This is so good with garlic mashed potatoes!  Just spoon some of the sauce on top.  Delish!

4.5* wonderful dish! Minor mods - poured teriaki into casserole as well as basting. Ran breasts thru beaten egg & flour before sauteing. Used leftover Tex-Mex cheese. Will do again!

this is restaurant quality.. i don't even like ranch dressing and i loved this. i used 'real' bacon instead of bits and a jack cheese blend as it melts better. i'd give it 10 stars if i could!

Always trying to find new ways to do chicken as my husband HATES it. Changed it a little, i used BBQ sauce instead of teryaki. Used realbacon, just cut it up and cooked it untill it was crispy, and i didnt have any green onions so i used regular onions, just sauteed them first.  My chicken hateing husband LOVED it, he actually had seconds! then he was raving about it later that night! deffinetly will be makeing this on a regular basis! best recipe ever!

Very flavorful and juicy. The bacon is a necessity in this recipe. The bacon pulls all of the flavors together (otherwise I think the flavors of the teriyaki and the cheese would have clashed a bit too much). I waited and put the cheese on halfway through the heating time, which I think turned out fine. Great recipe though. I will be using this a ton in the future.

I remember having something like this at a national chain restaurant, but I'm sure it was with bbq sauce not teriyaki.  So I made mine using some bold bbq sauce and it turned out SO good!  Better then the chain restaurant.  I also used real bacon, chopped up and cooked in the skillet, then used the bacon grease instead of vegetable oil to cook the chicken.  Baked in the oven and added the cheese/bacon/green onions at the end as suggested in other reviews.  Cut breasts in half to shorten cooking time.  I served it with ranch mashed potatoes and corn.  Super tasty!!!

I have looked at this recipe numerous times, but hesitated to make it because I hate ranch. I finally decided to go for it and I'm glad.  It was awesome and sooooo easy!!! Like others recommended I used bacon and put it on along with the cheese and green onions the last 8 minutes of cooking.

One of the best chicken recipes I've come across in a while. I marinaded boneless skinless chicken thighs in the teriaki sauce for about an hour then followed the recipe. I used sweet yellow onions instead of green onions and chopped up some leftover strips of bacon and mixed it with the sharpest cheddar cheese I could find for the topping. I would suggest adding the cheese and bacon during the last 5 minutes of baking. Served it with hot buttered rice. I'll be making this chicken often.

This was SUCH a GREAT chicken dish. I served it tonight (about 30 min ago to be exact..haha!) and my husband LOVED this. His plate was clean! The only thing I did differently was brown the chicken in olive oil, white wine and a bit of pepper. I served this dish with scalloped potatoes and fresh corn. I will MOST definitely make this again. Thanks for a great dinner :-)

I made this chicken for my fiancé and my sister two nights ago. My sister is extremely picky so I didn't tell her what was in it until she took a bite. She loved it. She ate her entire plate. My fiancé ate his entire plate as well. I actually had to get up and brown more chicken on the stove, add it to the remaining sauce in the casserole, add some more cheese, and crumble some more bacon and make this again because he wanted more! It DOES heat up very well too. I just got done having it for lunch today and it still tasted wonderful. I left off the chives and parsley, though due to my picky eaters, but it still tasted absolutely delicious. I, like just about everybody else, put extra teriyaki sauce on the bottom of the dish (I used Kikkoman teriyaki baste and glaze), mixed the ranch into the teriyaki rather than just pouring it on top, used more Cheddar than the recipe called for, crumbled up real bacon, and added the cheese and bacon during the last 15 minutes of cooking only. It felt like we were eating at a restaurant!

Sooooooo easy and so good. Used Teriyaki glaze rather than sauce, and real bacon. My husband and four children gobbled it down, even my eleven year old daughter, who doesn't like ANYTHING.

This turned out tasting quite different than I expected...the combination of the teriyaki sauce and the ranch dressing tasted like gravy...not bad, just not what I thought it would be.

Well, I had almost finished making this when my hubby came home from work, but didn't come inside because he started to snow blow the driveway, when I went out to tell him dinner was going to be ready soon he said he wasn't that hungry. Well, the second he walked in the door he said-"Wow, it smells really good in here" and practically inhaled the chicken. I didn't change a thing except I didn;t have any green onions on hand, but I am sure thta they would have just added to the flavor.

This was outstanding.  I also put teriaki sauce in the pan first and then laid the chicken on top.  It came out perfectly and I despise ranch dressing.  The blend with the teriaki was great.  My family loved it and my brother said it was like eating a chicken club for dinner.  I would definitely make this again!  Thanks.

Very good! We cooked the chicken on the grill and basted it with teriyaki sauce. After it was done, we added the cheese, let it melt, and then topped it off with the ranch and bacon pieces. I was a little afraid of the teriyaki flavor with the ranch, bacon, and cheese, but I had faith in the Allrecipes reviews and they did not lead me astray! I recommend you try this, even if you think the flavor combination sounds strange. Good stuff.

This was very good! I am sure we will make it again soon! I didn't like how the teriyaki scorched in the pan, but that could be because I used too much. I will definitely try this again without as much teriyaki. I also used ready-cooked bacon and probably would prefer it with freshly fried bacon. Overall delicious! I served with steamed broccoli, mashed potatoes and yeast rolls. YUM!

This was really good.  I might not add all the teriyaki sauce next time as it made my sauce mixture a little runny. Thanks!

I made this only because of all the great reviews. The flavors seemed like they would clash and I had little hopes for this one. I was so wrong - it was really delicious. I do not think anyone would know what is in it unless you tell them. Makes for a nice unique yet "safe" meal (ie pleasing to all types of people with all types of palates). I did make my own ranch sauce of galic, mayo, sour cream and herbs including fresh chives. For a makeshift teriyaki sauce I used soy sauce, brown sugar, maraschino cherry juice and a bit of dried mustard (hey it was what I had on hand and it turned out to be a great sauce)

Like many others I was a bit skeptical mixing these different flavors but was quite pleased with the result. This was a very quick and easy dinner and I had everything on hand except the green onions, so I sauteed yellow onions in the bacon drippings as called for in the Anniversary Chicken II recipe. The ranch dressing I had was with jalapeno so ours was a little spicy but very good. My husband loved it and suggested it for a dinner party. Seems to be one of those you can make ahead, refrigerate and maybe just allow a little more baking time.

This is a great weekday dinner! Used REAL bacon instead of bits. I sauteed the chicken in 1/2 bacon grease, 1/2 butter opposed to oil. Served with marinated Balsamic tomatoes. None was left!

Very good. I served with a cucumber salad from this site and saffron rice. My whole family really enjoyed it. One tip however... I would wait and add the cheese until the last 10-15 minutes of cooking, if not I found both times I made this the cheese melted off the chicken and kind of burnt. I also waited and sprinkled the green onions before serving.

O.K. this is what I did, I browned the chicken in suated garlic and butter.  As I was thinking of a side dish, I then added sliced red potatoes, real bacon, and green pepers to the pan.  Put it all into the baking dish, then sprinkled some powered italian dressing onto dish along with teriaki sauce and cheddar. Then I added a dash of red wine to the pan I had cooked in and scrapped off the brown bits, added that on top of the dish.  Turned out soo good!

I have been making this recipe for six years and it is my husband's favorite!  I make my own teriyaki (from "Baked Teriyaki Chicken" submitted by Marian Collins) and double the teriyaki sauce recipe.  I also use generous amounts of the other ingredients to make a good amount of gravy that we use for mashed potatoes.  Light ranch dressing is just as good!  Great comfort food!

This was so excellent and simple to make. I agree with other reviewers who have said to mix the teriyaki with the ranch dressing. It gives more flavor. All the ingredients were on hand for this recipe which is always nice (esp. when the last place you want to run to is the grocery store!) and the taste was wonderful. A definate keeper here! WTG Vicki!

I made a couple of changes.  First I marinated the chicken breasts in my own teriyaki marinade with low salt soy sauce.  I browned the chicken breasts in a pan and then added about half a cup of the marinade and let the sauce cook down.  I followed the rest of the recipe as stated and it was delicious.  

Next time I am going to pound the chicken breasts thin, marinate, then grill them.  Then I will put the toppings on and make a sandwich out of this with ranch as a sauce on the sandwich.

I thought it was very good. I think I would marinate the chicken the night before and add the cheese the last 5 mintues of baking. Other than that, very good.

I was hesitant about trying this one - ranch, teriyaki and cheddar cheese? But it turned out to be delicious. I substituted crumbled bacon in place of the canned bacon bits. I'll definitely make this again.

I cubed the chicken instead of whole chicken breasts, "browned" the cubes and followed the rest of the recipe as it is.  My 4 year old daughter - queen of the fusspots - HATES chicken - LOVES this even has seconds!  AWESOME!

"I was expecting a lot of flavor from this recipe but was disappointed when the only flavor that stood out was the bacon bits." Quoted from my husband. Personally, I didn't like this dish much. I can't pinpoint what I don't like about it exactly. The appearance of this dish was interesting, not something that I'm used to. The smell while baking was wonderful though, like a fully loaded baked potato.

The recipe looked a little strange but me and the wife decided to try it.  It was awesome!  We have it all the time and everyone that we've cooked it for has raved about it.  I use regular teriyaki instead of the basting sauce cause it has more flavor.  Try this recipe, you will not be sorry!

Although this recipe seemed like a strange mix of flavors, I decided to give it a try. I did use Masterpiece Honey-Teriyaki sauce. It really wasn't that good. I really didn't like the imitation bacon bits, and my husband seemed to think it had a weird flavor. I won't be making it again.

The first time I made this recipe I followed the directions perfectly. The chicken was very moist but far too salty. The next time I made it, I cut the quantity of teriyaki sauce in half. It was still pretty salty but also very tasty. I think that I will attempt to find light, low sodium teriyaki sauce for next time. All in all, easy and delicious!

My husband could not say enough about this dish.  It has all his favorites.  When I make it again, I will try cooking the chicken thoroughly in the skillet (to 165 F), and lessen the time in the oven to maybe 5-10 minutes. I think that will help the cheese melt nicely instead of separate and become too greasy.  Overall, we loved it!

This recipe is delicious...we love it!  However, I think the secret to success is the teriyaki sauce.  Get *low sodium* or I've found this will be way too salty. My favorite teriyaki for this recipe has only 270mg sodium/2Tbsp.  Also, I just mix the teriyaki and ranch (Hidden Valley from mix)together and pour it over the chicken.

This one is tough to review fairly. I had high hopes for it and give it high marks for ease of preparation, aroma and visual appeal. But as far as taste, it was a waste of good chicken. The consistency was bizarre, too. Not dry as many have reported, but watery. Not my cup of tea.

Very good flavor! (I ommitted green onion and parsley, just to keep it simple.) I also prefer to wrap the chicken with the bacon to keep it moist and add the cheese the last 10 minutes. Yumm!

This recipe was absolutely awesome!  I actually printed this recipe several years ago and didn't try it until last night.  My husband said it's the best dish I've made yet (he's the cook in the family).  I didn't think it would be that great with the teriyaki AND ranch, but they actually complemented each other well.  The chicken was very moist.  Easy to make too.

This is a easy dish to make after a busy day...

My only suggestion is to ensure you use low sodium teriyaki sauce in the dish - I did not and found it a little salty. My own fault I guess...

Great ----  I was a little leary when looking at all the strong flavors in this dish, but you have to try it.  I did use real bacon and marinated the chicken in teriyaki sauce before cooking like several people had suggested.  We thought it was great and both kids (6 & 1 1/2) wanted seconds.  I will definately make this again and again.  Thanks Vicki

I thought this recipe was actually very good! from the other reviews I see people said it was salty, but mine turned out with a wonderful taste! I put the chicken in a 9x13 pan and poured terriyaki sauce on it and baked it for about 15 minutes in the oven. Then I brushed the ranch dressing on it and topped with the rest of the ingredients. It was great. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was great!!!!  My husband, who is a very picky eater, loved this and wanted me to make it again.  I was skeptical at first, but it was well worth the risk of trying a new recipe.  I took the advice of some other reviews, and I marinated the chicken in the teriyaki sauce for about 30 minutes and then browned.  I sauteed mushrooms in the left over grease/teriyaki sauce, and I added the mushrooms, cheese, and bacon about 10 minutes before removing from the oven.  Yummy!!!

I must admit that I was very sceptical.  I have often been disappointed by recipes that have hundreds of great reviews.  However, this chicken had a very good flavor and was certainly 'dressed up' enough to serve to guests.  I used no oil (just a little water in the pan), much less cheese and real bacon (crumbled...I just can't do those 'bit' things).  I would make this again.  It was certainly easy and could be multiplied for a crowd.

My husband loves this chicken.  It's also good for people who are on low carb diets.  It pairs well with steamed veggies and a salad.

I made this with salmon instead of chicken, and it may be the best fish I have made. The 2nd time, I modified the procedure a bit. I used double the amts of teriyaki and ranch, mixed them together, and reduced it by half on the stove. This gives a thicker sauce which adheres better. Then I mixed the sauce with the cheese, bacon bits, and shallot (instead of green onion). I applied to the salmon and baked until ready (I didn't bother to sear the salmon on the stove first).Mmmmm

The reviews are right! It is too salty, even for a salt fan like me.  And the ranch dressing does cook off.  All in all not a good combination.

This was really easy to make. It had a very good taste and the chicken was so tender and juicy. I pounded my chicken breasts thin before browning (just a personal preference). Will definitely make again sometime!

The flavor of this recipe was fantastic, but the amount of liquid really makes this kind of soupy. Maybe it was the way I prepared this but I didn't think that it was very pleasing on the eyes. Thanks for sharing Vicki!

This is really delicious! There is so little work involved for the amount of flavor you get. It's easy. I used real bacon instead of the bits and it was great. I'll make this a lot.

We really enjoyed this dish.  The only thing I did differently, was to marinate the chicken in the teriyaki for a few hours.  It was really good, and the chicken was very moist.  It didn't hurt that it was also incredibly fast and easy!

I prepared this two nights ago and it was a hit! My six-year old daughter loved it and so did my eighty-nine year old grandmother! I used chives instead of green onions beacuse that was what I has on hand, Next ime I will use green onions--I think the flavor will be fabulous. I used Kraft Three-Cheese Ranch Dressing which gave this dish an awesome flavor. I will definitely make again.

Very Good! Must admit the blend of ranch dressing and teriyaki threw me but it was delicious. I agree I would marinate the chicken the next time for a little while in the teriyaki sauce. Thanks Vicki!

I served this to guests and was very disappointed because it was so ugly and the toppings cooked off in the oven.  Adding the toppings at the end of the cook time would have saved the appearance.  The chicken was drier than I perfer.  Flavor was good, but I'll cook it differently next time.

We were pleasantly surprised by the great flavor of this chicken. Initially, the combination of ranch and teriyaki didn't sound too apealing to me, but with so many rave reviews, I decided to try it anyway. Simple to prepare. Definitely will make again.

DELICIOUS!  My husband and I loved this dish.  I used turkey bacon and cut back a little on the cheese to make it a little healthier and it still came out great.  The star of this recipe is the mix of teriyaki and ranch - so the taste wasn't diminished by cutting corners.

I have to disagree with the majority.  I used the baste and glaze teriyaki sauce but still disliked the flavor of this dish.  The chicken was moist, but I would say it's just edible.  Probably my taste buds.

If there was a way to make this where it isn't so salty it would be great.  I like it soupy but then the sauce is too salty for my taste.

Oh how yummy!!  The only thing I found wrong was that it called for WAY too much of the teriyaki, ranch, etc.  There's no way I could've used it all!  What I did was brush the teriyaki over the chicken, then top with 1 or 2 tbsp of ranch dressing per breast, then sprinkled the cheese and bacon (used real bacon bits - yum).  Don't care for the green onion.  I also had sprinkled a bit of seasoning salt over the chicken while it browned.  SOOOOOOOOOOO yummy!!

The combination of Ranch dressing and Teriyaki sauce caught my eye, and I showed the recipe to my husband, the main cook in our home, and he quickly put it away and never tried it.  Two months later, I pulled it out and whipped it up.  Very quick.  I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be just by looking at it, but after the first bite, I loved it.  So did my 4 year old.  My husband literally LICKED HIS PLATE!  And, the biggest compliment of them all, my son (who only eats things plain...no sauces or cheeses), not only ate all of  his, but he asked for seconds!!!  We will definately make this again.  Only sorry didn't get to try sooner.

I guess I had really high expectations from all the other reviews on here, but I thought this was better than average, but nothing really special.

It was terrific! Didn't have teriyaki glaze sauce so mixed teriyaki marinade in with the ranch dressing and poured over browned chicken.  Didn't have green onions so used part of a vidalia onion, chopped into small pieces.  Used crumbled, cooked bacon.  A bit salty, probably from the teriyaki marinade, but very good. Will make again.  -- Made again using basting sauce.  Though it is good, albeit salty, with teriyaki sauce, the basting sauce is important for a truly great dish.

I added garlic powder and cayenne pepper while browning chicken. Didn't measure the other ingredients...simply "eyed" it. Used low fat ranch and low fat "real" bacon pieces. His was a hit at our home

I used boneless thighs instead of breast as that is what i had on hand.  Juicy, flavors were great together.  Easy to prepare.  Husband loved it! A keeper.

I followed the recipe exactly and my family LOVED it! My husband hates teriyaki sauce, but he loved this chicken. The only change I made was that I did not put ranch or onions on my sons portion since he is so picky! My family ate every bite and wanted more. This is definitely a keeper for us

This recipe, made as directed, was just 'ok'.  There are better ways to use chicken breasts.  It was too salty and a little too greasy with the melted cheese.  I won't be making this again.

The chicken was soooo delicious.  The only thing I did different was cut the breasts open, they were really large.  It also gave more coverage for the toppings and also cooked quicker.

I cooked it in a slow-cooker and it was great! I used a teriyaki marinade for the chicken (2 hrs the discarded the marinade)I didn't have to pre-brown the chicken. Then I put the chicken and teriyaki glaze with bacon ranch dressing on top and used pre-cooked bacon and twice the amount of cheese.
I cooked it on high for 4 hours and it turned out tender, moist and everyone raved!

This chicken was a hit at our table.  I used the recipe as a guide with some of the other tips in the reviews. I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours in honey mustard (instead of regular yellow mustard) and honey...because we like sweet things.  Then I baked the chicken from the start at 400 degrees.  I also cooked my bacon before crumbling it and adding it to the chicken this kept the bacon crisp and not soggy.  Once the chicken was just about done, I added mozzarella cheese then the bacon crumbles and topped it with double cheddar cheese.  This helped the bacon stay on the chicken.  I drizzled a little bit of the leftover marinade for extra boost of flavor.  Then continued to bake...or melt the cheese.  Kids loved it...but who doesn't love bacon!?!?

It wasn't horrible, but it just tasted like teriyaki chicken with cheese on it. The kids liked it, but they'd eat anything with cheese on it!

Made exactly as the recipe called...I covered my chicken for the first 30 minutes, then uncovered the last 10 minutes. Granted my chicken breasts were very thick so wanted to make sure chicken was cooked through...very juicy and flavorful. I covered with foil and let rest for about 5 minutes longer....delicious!

I have to give this 4 stars because I thought the chicken itself was very moist and tasty, but I can't say I could taste either the terriyaki sauce or the ranch dressing in the recipe.  I used real bacon because I don't like the artificial taste of bacon bits and I think that gave it more flavor.  I'm not sure if I would make it again, but it was good for a change.

What fun!!!  Really surprised us how well the flavors actually went together.  I used Kikkoman's teriyaki baste & glaze because we always have it in the house and I had previously defrosted boneless chicken thighs for dinner before seeing the recipe so I used those instead.  Real bacon...why not?  We'll be having it again for sure.  Thank you for your recipe.

I combined a few other reviewers' suggestions and made substitutions according to what I had around the kitchen. After searing boneless thighs in butter I put them in a crockpot. I had no teriyaki glaze on hand so made my own out of duck sauce, soy sauce and minced garlic a few hours ahead and let it sit to blend. I coated the browned chicken with the glaze in a crockpot on high for a couple of hours, then added crumbled bacon and onions I browned in the bacon drippings.About an hour later I added the ranch dressing and mixed everything, then topped with white cheddar and let that melt for another hour or so. Served over a mix or wild and arborio rice, we LOVED it! Only 4/5 stars bc there was no single WOW flavor, maybe my substitutions made the difference. I'll make this again and play around with other seasonings we like.

Excellent! I made this for a birthday party for 20 people and everyone loved it. I used real bacon and I didn't add the bacon, green onions and cheese until the last 15 minutes. This was such an easy recipe to make and the chicken was so tender. Will definitely make again.

Im pretty disappointed LOL disappointed that I waited so Long to try this recipe! WOW! This chicken is GOOD! I have to admit I was a little skeptical on how teriyaki sauce and Ranch dressing was going to taste lol But it works! They go wonderfully together who would have thought lol!! I did just mix them both together and I also breaded my chicken with Panko bread crumbs and used real bacon!! DEEEEELicious! :)

When I was telling my husband the ingredients I needed for this, he said, "It sounds like the island of misfit food." None of the ingredients together sound like they would be very good, but after the first bite, he said, "OH WOW." And that's what this is. So so so so good. There are lots of flavors without tasting like too much or overwhelming and my recently picky three year old ate it too! Definitely going on the list again. For the salt, just get low sodium I think. We like salt so maybe that's why it wasn't a big deal but we used low sodium ranch and teriyaki with only whole ingredients. That usually makes a difference.

Made this for dinner tonight, great flavor! I used chicken tenders instead of chicken breast as it was what I had on hand, also took other reviewers suggestions and used the Kikkoman teriyaki baste. My kids didn't like it, or hate it....but they're picky.

This recipe was good and I made it just like the recipe. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because I covered while cooking as other people had said and I baked for less time..

I made this recipe last night and it was fabulous! I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand so I improvised; instead of teriyaki I used a sweet barbecue sauce and instead of green onions I used crispy "frizzled" onions. I also used real chopped cooked bacon instead of bacon bits. It was delicious! Even my super picky 9-year old loved it and had seconds!

My family loved this, but personally I thought the teriyaki sauce was too strong---I'd probably not use as much next time or skip it altogether.

Since it got good reviews I thought I would try it. Followed recipe exactly and was sure to use basting glaze. Nothing could help the flavor. I am baffled how this got a high rating. Don't waste your time or money on this one. Seriously.

I had decided to try this recipe as it had so many good reviews. I had read the negative reviews as well, stating the combination was a bit strange or was too salty and many did not enjoy it. Needless to say, I was nervous as to how this would taste. It came out pretty good though! I didn't find the flavor overpowering. The only issue I had was the cheese and ranch seemed to melt away. I will definitely make this recipe again! My husband and roomie enjoyed it and I did too! It isn't the best chicken recipe out there but I really enjoyed making it and eating it!

This is the recipe that got me hooked on AllRecipes.com!  I dice and saute the chicken but other that that I do not change a thing!  I make this (by popular demand) every year for our Mission trip, as well as for my nephew in the Navy whenever he is home from overseas.  Soon good!!!

Very good! The only thing I caution is that the flavor changes drastically with which type of white wine you use, so keep that in mind from dinner to dinner.

This is a favorite at my house.  The flavors blend very well together, although at glance, they seem an eclectic mix.  To the reviewer who said the cooking time made for dry chicken...with any recipe you may need to adjust the cooking time, as all ovens/stoves are different, and the temperatures might be off.  Always check as you go and adjust the cooking time based on your needs.

My husband is very picky. He loved this dish! He ate over half the pan. I browned it on a cast iron skillet first and it really helped seal in the moisture.

This was one of those let me make it, not tell them what's in it, and see what happens. LMAO. Hubby and the kids fought over the sauce, and boom, all the chicken breast was GONE. I did read other reviews. Yes, I covered the chicken in first baking it, then uncovered after adding the toppings. I did not sautee the chicken. I did mix the teriyaki and ranch dressing, adding a bit of garlic (we love garlic). I sauteed shallots (no scallions) and diced ham (no bacon). I am glad I made 1 1/2 times the basic sauce.

Overall, not bad. Had to do a few things different. I did not use the recommended Teriyaki sauce. I replaced it with Pepper Palace's Bourbon Glaze sauce. It's not in stores but you can purchase it online. I sprayed cooking spray in the pan and placed the glaze on the bottom as well as the top of the chicken and then followed the recipe from there! We like lots of flavor to our chicken so I added avocado tomatillo salsa to spice it up. I think the chicken was too thick...Maybe if it were thinner I would not have had to add any flavor.

Wow - I was surprised at how good this was! OK, I did not follow the recipe to a T. First off, I did not brown the chicken first (I'm lazy). Second, I did not layer the ingredients; I just mixed everything together (again, blame the laziness). Third, I did not have any cheddar cheese, but I did have some cottage cheese that I wanted to use up, so subbed that in. But REALLY, it's the mix of ranch and teriyaki that make this dish! I never would have put those 2 together, and it was a delightful surprise.

I tweaked a few things based on other reviews. I had two really large chicken breasts and was just cooking for two of us. Did not have to change any portions. I browned the chicken, then put the teriyaki on top and placed in oven at 350 for 15 minutes. Then, I took them out and added the cheese, green onions, ranch, then a bit more cheese. Back in oven for 15 min. That's it. Super easy, chicken was very moist, and it was delicious! Served with wild rice. Can't wait to make it again!

Not bad, I used BBQ sauce instead of teriyaki. Also i used very thin slices of chicken breasts, and it cooked too fast, and made it too dry. Other than that, i think this recipe would've been good.

This is pretty good, as my husband who doesn't like chicken said he liked it. I made my own teriyaki sauce (only half the quantity) from a recipe on the Food Network and I did marinate the chicken for a couple of hours before cooking it. Otherwise, I don't think the chicken would have tasted of much, once the cheese, bacon and green onions bits were eaten. For me, the tastier parts were when I got a bite with the dressing and all the other stuff; that was quite yummy. I will definitely make this again.

My husband and step-son both enjoyed this. I made it as written, minus the green onion as I didn't have it on hand. We will definitely put it into rotation.

"Phenomenal" is what my boyfriend said. I marinated the chicken in Kikkoman Teriyaki sauce & marinade for a few hours. Then I mixed 1/2 cup Ranch dressing & 1/4 cup Teriyaki sauce together & basted chicken with it in baking dish. Did NOT brown prior to putting in the oven, but pretty much followed remaining cook time. Ended up turning & basting again after about 10 min, then added cheese/bacon/green onions for the last 5-10 & drizzled a little more sauce on top. SOOOO GOOD! Not too salty for us. Served with red mashed potatoes & baked zucchini chips from this site... we ended up using the sauce on everything because it was too yummy. Will definitely add to regular rotation!

5 stars for being very simple to make & something different to try!  The changes I made were marinating in the teriyaki, chopping up 'ready cooked bacon' instead of bacon bits, using ranch yogurt dressing to cut fat & calories, and covering with foil for 25 minutes then without foil for an additional 6 or so minutes.  The yogurt dressing did make it a little harder for the toppings to stay on the chicken but still was workable.

I made this for dinner, as written, without extra salt and pepper to taste. Not a keeper. It was super salty and dry. The flavor combination was bizarre and did not go well together. Overall, it got 2 stars because we did finish the meal, but I will not be making this again.

excellent & something different to make with chicken. I followed others & mixed together the ranch and teri marinade together & poured over browned chicken before placing in oven. Put cheese, bacon & green onions on 10 min left of baking. Fiance enjoyed this.

Loved it! I did not have teriyaki basting sauce so I used soy sauce mixed with brown sugar. The dish tasted fantastic, the juices left in the pan were very unappetizing, so had to toss those before the kiddo's could see. Served with Zucchini Potato Bake, no left overs tonight!

I used real bacon and crumbled it, used chicken tenders instead of breasts, omitted the green onions, and skipped the pan-frying step. I also followed the ideas of others and waited to add the cheese and bacon until the last 10 minutes in the oven. worked out and would make again. Next time, I'd serve with mashed potatoes instead of pasta.

READ THIS! Fantastic recipe...but here's an IMPORTANT piece of advice: Make sure you don't over cook the chicken as it dries out when over cooked and you'll end up with a large lump of hard-to-eat dried up white meat. Use a meat thermometer and cook until 165 degrees.  Or pound the breasts with a meat mallet until thinner then bake - this requires less time to cook! (ps: When in a rush I have skipped the pre-browning). If you don't have a meat thermometer GET ONE! A good one isn't even expensive and you'll wonder what you did with out it! Electronic is my fave - mine only cost $25).

I love this recipe!  However, real bacon is a must and if you're out of teriyaki sauce, BBQ sauce works with it as well.

It was ok, but I'm afraid a three star is all I can give it.
My family also felt it was good, but just ok
I expected more definite flavors and a little less dry. The inside of the chicken was moist, but the outside was dry.  I added the cheese in the last 10min in order to prevent this.
I think this is a good starting recipe, but something is missing.

My husband and 3 kids (ages 1, 3, 6) all loved it!!  Everyone was pretty much licking the sauce off their plates, it was that good.
I used real bacon, and then browned the chicken in the bacon grease.  I stirred the teriyaki sauce (just had the kikioman marinade so I added a little cornstarch) and the ranch dressing together then poured it over the chicken.  After reading the other reviews, I added the cheese, bacon and onions for the last 5 minutes.  Only cooked for 25 minutes total.  Perfect!

Well...my boyfriend and I made this and it turned out great, but we didn't quite follow the directions...oops!!  I had part of the recipe written down and knew what else had to be done, but when he was trying to help, it got all messed up in miscommunication.  We ended up marinading the chicken in the oil/sauce/ranch mixture and then baking it...tasted great and chicken was very moist!  We then topped it with green onions, mushrooms, and cheese and finished that in the last 10 minutes in the oven.  Served it with garlic mashed potatoes and it was delicious!  We would definitely make this recipe again...following the directions or ours :)  He doesn't even care for ranch and loved it so I'd say this one is a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of marinating the chicken for an hour in the teriyaki sauce.  My husband flipped, he loved it so much and when I asked if he thought it was too salty he said no, my chicken was not dry at all - it was super moist and tender.  He said the flavors mixed perfectly.

I made this for my husband and he enjoyed it. He does not enjoy ranch as a salad dressing or many ranch flavored things. But, he said he couldn't even distinctly taste the ranch because all of the flavors combined so well.

The top of my chicken breasts were scrumptious. The bottoms...eh, pretty plain. This smelled so fantastic cooking -- I think I'll try marinating the chicken in the teriyaki sauce next time to get a flavor throughout the meat. Thanks for sharing!

This is one of my family's favorite recipes.  I got it at a church dinner and have been serving it for about 8 years now.  No one misses supper when it's on the menu.  I use the recipe exactly as written but may try a few tweaks now that I have read the reviews here.  If your family gets sick of chicken, try this.  You won't be sorry.

Very good. Family liked it as well. The only changes I made were to marinade in teriyaki sauce for about 20 minutes prior to lightly browning. Browned in canola oil. Put small amount of teriyaki sauce on bottom of dish prior to placing chicken on top. Baked, covered with foil for 15 minutes and then put cheese, bacon, onion over top. Baked 7 min. covered, uncovered for about 10 minutes.

Made this last night for dinner, loved it! I didnt have any vegetable oil, or bacon bits. So I used some olive oil and also rubbed some salt and pepper into the chicken before putting the teriyaki and ranch on. Defantialy loved it, didn't even have to marinate it. :D

This was so easy and wonderful! I even left off the bacon bits and green onions just because I didn't have them and my husband and I loved it. Def a keeper. Added sliced baguette topped with artichoke pesto, sun dried tomato and goat cheese and toasted the last ten minutes of the baking. GREAT! Def go to meal.

This first thing I heard from my family's mouth was "Amazing!" This dish was very good! I made as directed except I used real bacon (10 slices, microwaved, then chopped).

This is excellent! Hubby is a very picky eater and he raved over this. Next time I will add more teriyaki and ranch because we didn't taste much of either. Not sure why people complained of this dish having too much of a "salty" taste. ?? I used real bacon and browned the chicken in the bacon grease.Yum! I also followed other reviews and added the cheese and bacon at the last 5 minutes of baking. Chicken turned out beautiful, very juicy, and tasty. This has made it into my dinner rotation. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

Well, it just tasted like Teriyaki Chicken to me and my family.  That flavor kinda took over.  It looked good with the bacon bits and cheese.  So, maybe I will up the Ranch and reduce the Teriyaki next time and not fry it in pan ahead of time.  That made it so that the sauces would not stick and just slide off.  The kids love Teriyaki so no loss, just not anything fabulous.

I think this recipe is 5 stars as is.  I did not have any teriyaki sauce on hand, so I substituted KC Masterpiece honey bbq sauce, and it was also fantastic!  Thank you for sharing!

This did not sound appetizing to me, but I was living at my sister's and she wanted to try it. I made it and we all LOVED it. It is now a staple in both of our households. Better with real bacon crumbled on top (of course). We also marinated the chicken in the sauce beforehand.

Omg! Omg! Omg! I just got finished eating this and I am still thinking about it and wishing that I had leftovers for tomorrow! This dish was amazing! I served it baked potatoes. My husband, who doesn't like chicken for the most part, couldn't  stop saying "mmmm", and "I don't know what part is the best, but it's so darn good" As a cook it is always a good feeling to put a smile on my families faces. Thank you so much for this recipe (and for getting my husband to eat chicken!) lol I can't wait to make this again for other people...pot luck here I come! (I did not pan fry them-only baked covered @350). Thanks again! If I could have I would have given this 10 stars! YUM!!!

This recipe is good, but the ranch and teriyaki wasn't as dramatically flavorful as I thought it would be...it pretty much just tasted like the Yoshido's sauce I used.  I'll make this again but I think I will put more ranch so the ranch taste will come through more.

made tonight...really good.  My husband loved it and my three picky eating kids gobbled it up.  Served white rice with it and used the sauce from the chicken mixed into the rice.  Also used real bacon and cooked chicken in bacon grease for the 4-5 minutes per side.

This is one of my favorite go-to chicken dishes.  I have modified it a little to make it quicker and easier, and it still turns out great.  I do not fry the chicken, I just pour the ranch and teriyaki basting sauce right over the top of raw chicken tenders (better size for the kids), roll it around to cover and then put it in the pan.  I then sprinkle on the shredded cheddar cheese and Hormel Real Crumbled Bacon.  Cook for 30 minutes and yum!!!

This is great! I am always looking for a new way to prepare chicken and this will be one I will come back to again. The flavor that the ranch and teriyaki creates is great - one I would have never come up with on my own. I did follow this recipe exactly how it was written, except I used real bacon that I cooked on the stove instead of bacon bits. I would definitely recommend this!

This was a very easy recipe that tasted really good! My family loved it. I added the drippings from the pan to it made a little extra sauce. Be sure to not overcook it ! Make a big batch so you can have leftovers for the next day.

I thought is was just okay.  The basting of teriyaki and ranch ensured a moist chicken, but it was an odd blend of flavor.  Maybe it's just the Texan in me, but I thought this would be better with a salsa type basting combined with the chedar cheese and onions.

what a disappointment! This would not be a normal dish for us but based on rave reviews gave it a try. It was WAY too salty (likely due to teriyaki plus bacon). Based on other reviewers we made ours in the slow cooker (very moist!) but the flavors just did not work. Please pass on this one...

This had no flavor. I am surprised at all the good reviews it has. We were very disappointed. I made it exactly as stated and the cooking time was far too long. The chicken was overcooked and dry and lacking taste.

Made exactly as directed (except marinated the chicken in Teriyaki sauce while oven was preheating per other reviewer tip).  Moist and flavorful.  Picky husband gave it two thumbs up!

I had high hopes for this recipe because of all the favorable reviews, but my family and I did not care for this at all.  I made it exactly as written and the combination of flavors was weird (for lack of a better word).  Will not be making this one again.

This is the best chicken I've prepared.  It was incredibly flavorful and tender.  The ranch dressing and teriyaki basting sauce work very well together...Just delicious.

I was missing the teriyaki sauce and although I tried to adlib I think this made a big difference. W/O the teriyaki the dish was just so-so. I may make this again but if it doesn't scream "AWESOME" next time... it won't be a keeper. There are much better chicken recipes out there, in my opinion. Sorry!

Good flavor, although a little too "watery" in the bottom of the dish for my taste when first out of the oven.  After refrigerating, sauce thickened and was much more to my liking.

We loved this, and it is difficult to find a recipe to please our entire family.  As some reviewers suggested, I added the cheese for the last 10-15 minutes.  I also used real bacon, and browned the chicken in the bacon grease.  Tasty, and can't wait for the leftovers!  I wish I had made it with pasta, because the extra sauce (I only used 4 chicken breasts) would be great on pasta.

I think this is in-between a three and a four.  The flavors were good, but I feel like the cooking the chicken in the oven step really cooked out some of the flavor.  I would suggest cooking your chicken until almost completely done on the stove top, then just melting the cheese in the oven.  I think the flavors work very well together, it is just the flavor is too light when you cook it the way it is stated, and I use a very strong Teriyaki glaze and it still didn't stay on.

I made this recipe yesterday and my husband and I fell in love with it!  I used stir fry sauce (that was all I had on hand), sauteed onion in place of green onions.  It was awesome!!! I will make this again and again.  I did pound my chicken breasts till they were about 1/2 inch thick and I seasoned them with onion and garlic powder, Mrs. Dash salt-free table blend seasoning, and Adobe chicken seasoning.

I love this chicken! It is VERY savory and flavorful. I thought that ranch and terriyaki would be odd together, but it's delicious! I don't normally have seconds, but this chicken is so juicy and lip smackin good that I can't help but go back for more. The recipe unchanged is very good, but I've made it several more times using a few minor changes. I season the breasts with pepper and a tiny amount of salt and saute them in butter for only 2 minutes each side. I use my own terriyaki using low sodium soy (the Japanese Teriyaki Sauce recipe on this site) and made the ranch from a Hidden Valley packet. I also use 6 to 8 slices of real bacon, cooked, and I chop a medium brown onion and caramelize it (in butter and some salt) to top the chicken along with the green onion and bacon. Yum, yum, yum! I can't wait to have it again! Thank you for this recipe :)

Great easy dinner, was sent to this site for this dish and it is now my husbands favorite chicken over rice! The only changes I make is the later adding of cheese and fresh fried bacon, and also if I am out of gr. onions I substitute them for regular white/yellow onions sautéed up in the bacon drippings.

I actually didn't love it, and was surprised by all the high reviews.  To me, it tasted so heavy and unhealthy, and almost had TOO much flavor from all of the competing flavorful ingredients.  I won't be making it again.

I figured with the ranch, bacon, and cheese, that this would be a pretty good chicken recipe. However, something just didn't taste right about it. I followed the recipe exactly. It wasn't bad, but definitely not something I want to try again. Very disappointed for such a high rating from so many reviewers.

Uh, this was different. The Hungry Teen loved this and had seconds. Neither my husband nor I cared much for the flavor. The teriaki and ranch were both very strong and I thought the Ranch was too weird. My husband thought it was a bit salty because of the bacon. It wasn't bad, but not something we would care to have again. Thanks, we enjoyed trying out a new meal.

Didn't care for this.  Chicken is very tough after baking for 25-35 minutes.  There's something about the combination of Ranch dressing and teriyaki that was very strange tasting and left an after-taste that we didn't care for.  Plenty salty too.  Won't be making this again!

This is an excellent recipe!  The chicken is extremely moist and tender.  The only change I made was to brown the chicken in bacon drippings (used about 1 tsp.) as I was making bacon for another dish, so I cooked 4 extra slices of bacon and used that instead of bacon bits. Thank you for the recipe, will most certainly make this again.

Recipe is okay.  Its tender but the teriyaki sauce can be a little overwhelming.  Use the sauce sparingly and should be okay.

Just finished eating this meal.  Wow!  Delicious! Because of what we had on hand, I used a bottled honey-mustard marinade and used the real bacon. We don't like to bake chicken in the oven because even in recipes that say, "It's SO moist," it usually tastes dry to us.  So I cubed the breasts and simply kept sauteing them until they were cooked.  I had already put the sauce together and simmered it in a pan on the stove for about 15 minutes. Put noodles in serving bowl, added the chicken on top, put the sauce over that, and added the bacon and cheese last.  Wonderful.  I'm anxious to try it again with the teriyaki basting sauce.

This is a good dish. The unusual combination of ingredients works well. To save time and reduce fat, I didn't brown the chicken in oil. And I skipped the bacon on top. It was still really good, although I'm sure the more decadent version is even better. I spooned the extra sauce over rice and it was very good. Rather salty as others have noted, so I'm glad we skipped the bacon.

Very good, use real bacon though. I marinated the chicken in the teriyaki sauce overnight first, instead of brushing it on.

Very very good, unique but great. Use low sodium teriyake sauce if able, and what ever you do don't salt the chicken like I did, makes it WAYYYYY salty.

It sounds like an odd combination, but it came out tasting awesome.  I used bone-in chicken breast with thigh and legs and baked it on low, this made the meat fall off of the bone and the taste was incredible.  I will definitely be making this over and over again.

Really loved this dish.My chicken came out perfect.Better than I could ever had hoped for.Chicken is a dish that gets boring sometimes so it was nice to surprise my families taste buds with this little gem.I did make substitutions by using real crispy bacon rather than bacon bits.Then I sprinkled a little salt & pepper on the raw chicken breast halves,dipped it in some egg wash (1 raw egg mixed with 2tbsp of milk),after that I dredged it through a mixture of 1c of flour & 1/8c of corn starch,I used the same oil that came off my crispy bacon to brown my chicken breast rather than vegetable oil.When it came to toppings I didn't have any Teriyaki sauce so I followed an online recipe to make my own. This teriyaki sauce came out amazing even though I didn't have any ginger for it.I brushed on 1/2c teriyaki sauce spooned on the ranch & sprinked on the chopped green onions, baked for 25 minutes like that then pulled it out & sprinkled lots of shredded velveeta cheese over it with my broken up bacon bits.Then heated for another 10 min coverd. My picky 3yr old eat every bite & my husband raved. A+

I enjoyed this very much. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because the flavors were a bit heavy. Delicious, but HEAVY. My stomach had that weird feeling it gets when the digestive system is in overdrive. My personal preference is seasoned chicken without too much saucy stuff and this is definitely on the saucy side. Still, I will definitely make it again, but with a little less ranch and bacon.

It was alright.  My family  doesn't care if they ever eat it again.  I cooked it 20 mins. in the oven and  it was overcooked.   So, make sure not to overbake after the pan searing.  I asked if they would have liked it if it was more tender, they responded "not really."  So, this is coming out of my recipe folder.):

I am giving this recipe 4 stars, but will say it may very well deserve 5.  I made this last night and it was a hit. Only one small piece of chicken was left over.  I only made one change to the recipe. I had no bacon bits, so I took about 8 slices of bacon, diced it up and fried it to just about crisp. The rest of the recipe left as is.  I mixed the Teriyaki and Ranch together before spreading it on the chicken, and upon tasting it I was worried. It tasted as though the tastes did not blend well together. But I forged ahead and brushed it on the chicken and followed the recipe from there. My family loved it, and before I could say I was concerned about the sauce my husband said "This sauce is great!"  I will say the sauce did have a better taste after it had been cooked then it did prior, but I still want to try this recipe again without the Teriyaki and just the Ranch, Bacon and Cheddar.  So I gave it 4 stars. There are 5 of us in the family and 4 loved it, and I liked it. I do recommend using the real bacon though.  I don't think I will ever use the bacon bits.

Oh, the smells in my kitchen is drawing crowds. I also ever so slowly saute an onion on the stove top in a little butter and pepper and throw that on top of the chicken for the last ten minutes.

This is a very tasty chicken dish.  Did the recipe as is but didn't think it had enough flavor so I will add some seasoning next time.  I didn't add anything extra because so many reviews said it was salty.  I will add garlic, pepper next time for sure.  Delicious with mashed potatoes.  Next time I won't brown before because it was not needed.

So good!!! I didn't have teryaki sauce so I used sesame ginger dressing and it tasted delicious! I did coat my chicken in seasoned flour as one reviewer had said and it came out perfect!

I skip the saute as on less step makes it that much faster.  I simply marinade the chicken in the sauce, put in a shallow baking dish, pour on the Ranch and bake.  The last 5 minutes I add the cheese and bacon. This recipe is easy and yummy!

I read another review, and took their advice and tried it in the crock pot. BIG mistake. I threw all of the ingredients in the slow cooker and left it on low for 5 hours. The cheese burned around the edges, and the flavor was not good. WAY too salty. I dont think I would have had this result had I just followed the directions like I was supposed to. I will try it again, the right way.

We really like this one, too, but made a substitution out of necessity...no teriyaki sauce.  I has Sezhuan stir-fry sauce and used that (can't imagine the taste would be that much different)...marinated my chicken in it for about 30 minutes before pan-frying.  It gave the chicken a nice carmelized outside...a nice addition to the ranch/cheese/bacon.  I will make this often.

I also marinated the chicken in the teriyaki sauce for 30  minutes, browned the chicken in olive oil, and then mixed the marinade with the ranch and poured it on top of the chicken.  I added the cheese and real bacon the last ten minutes of baking.  Served with rice - it was very tasty!  Husband and I loved it, kids thought it was okay.

My boyfriend told me I get an A+ for the night.  Even hours after dinner, he was still talking about how much he liked it.  This is what I did differently from the original recipe:  I marinaded the chicken in the teriyaki sauce for about 30 minutes, skipped the browning, placed the chicken in the pan and coated them with the ranch, i added the onions and put it in the oven.  While it was in the oven, I fried up 5 slices of real bacon per other suggestions.  Since I didn't brown the chicken first, I left it in for about 45 minutes.  10 minutes before it was done I added the bacon and cheese (with a tad bit more than what the recipe called for).  It was FANTASTIC!  Will definitely be making again.

This chicken was AWESOME!!!  I browned the chicken in olive oil, rather than vegetable oil, adding some black pepper and garlic to both sides of the chicken while cooking.  I did what several other reviewers suggested and added the shredded cheese, bacon bits, and green onions half-way through baking.  I would probably use fewer bacon bits (it was a little salty).  I was out of teriyaki sauce, so I subsituted soy sauce and a couple packets of sweet and low, and it seemed to work.  I cooked this for my parents, and my very, very, very picky father REALLY liked it!!!  Will definitely be making again!

Delicious. I honestly think that you could leave off the cheese and bacon and still have a really delicious chicken. I never would have combined teryaki and ranch, but it works! I also just cooked the chicken in the oven, without browning it first, and it took about 45 minutes.

This was amazing! Only change I made was that I used real bacon instead of the bits. Aside from that, I wouldn't change a thing. Excellent!

would make again, easy to make with no prep work.  The terriyaki was a little overwhelming (I poured it over) so next time I would stick to the recipe or even use less.  The cheese and bacon slipped off so i might use more cheese next time

This was really really good.  My very picky boyfriend even complimented it.  One thing I tried different is I used creamy garlic dressing instead of ranch, and I added mushrooms and onions which gave it a nice flavor.  I would leave out the bacon next time however it just seemed like a waste with all the other flavors going on.  Great recipe!!!  Thanks!

THIS CHICKEN IS INCREDIBLE!!  I made it in the crock pot, so easy! Just covered the bottom of the crock with teriyaki sauce, added chicken breasts and cooked on low for 6 hours, turning chicken over a couple of times.  I spooned on ranch dressing, added cheese and real bacon bits and then cooked 30 minutes more.  Moist and delicious!

I followed this recipe almost exactly, except I did not put on the cheese, scallions, and bacon until 15 minutes before they were done baking.  I also baked mine for 45 min, as I had very thick breasts. I have never heard my family go so crazy for dinner before!  They went on and on about how juicy and flavorful it was.  They wanted me to make it the next day as well!   You simply MUST try this recipe!  It will NOT disappoint!

Awesome chicken recipe! It was a nice way to spice up chicken. Some pieces were a little salty depending on how much bacon was on the chicken breast. Using low-sodium anything is a plus on this recipe. This one is a keeper!

I have wanted to try this recipe for a while, but I was very hesitant because I just thought...ew...ranch and teriyaki. But I wanted something different for dinner then the normal chicken that I make. First of all...SO EASY!!! This took me very little time to prepare.  Second. HOLY COW WAS IT YUMMY!!!! The only thing that I changed was I used real bacon instead of bacon bits because my hubby loves real bacon. I served it with garlic bread and a garden salad. Phenomenal!! I recommend this to everyone. :-D

This was overrated in my opinion. I would not make it again. The ter. basting sauce and bacon bits gave it an overpowering salty taste. Maybe it would be better with real bacon?? I probably won't make this again.

I was just sure this was going to be a hit given the really fantastic reviews...unfortunately, my husband and I didn't like the taste combination at all.  Perhaps if I had went really, really light on the Ranch the flavors would have blended more nicely, but using about 2 tablespoons for each breast made the Ranch standout in stark contrast to the teriyaki.

Easy and delicious receipe. I made this twice. The second time, most of the cooking took place in the pan and the last five minutes, it was in oven with cheese and some leftover marinade. The look was excellent the second time as the chicken was brown

Tim, Swany and I liked it.  Katie did not.  Too salty for me---cut back on the teriyaki (way too much).  Used real bacon, baked 15 minutes, added toppings and baked another 15.  Shorten by a few minutes next time.

This was just okay. At one point all the cheese & bacon slid off the top of the chicken in the oven because the chicken was so slimey due to all the different dressings.  I'll probably go for something a little more fresh tasting next time.

This was very good. I used other reviewers tips and used real crumpled bacon, and put the bacon and cheese on the last 15 minutes. My boyfriend loved it!! It was a little salty for my tastes, but will definately make this again. I think next time I will use low sodium terraki to cut some of the saltiness.

Very tasty!  Don't add the cheese, bacon and onion until it is almost ready to come out of the oven, if not, everything mixes together and looks horrid.... Nothing like the picture shown!
I'm even cooking it for my mother-in-law this weekend.

when i first thought of the combination of teriyaki sauce and ranch, i thought it was wierd, then i read the reviews and decided to give it a try. as i was making it my hubby said it looked disgusting, but he tried it, and he loved it and so did i, he has requests for it now, the only thing i did differently was to add cilantro at the end for a garnish, since we don't like green onions, and had no parsley. it was delicious!! thanks for sharing

This recipe was amazingly easy and quick to make, while still tasting like it would have taken much more effort and time. Thank you! I had chicken breast (bone in) marinating in the refrigerator from the day prior, in teriyaki pineapple marinade, planning on grilling. I think that this helped with the salt issue others mentioned, because it was a thicker cut of meat. But, since the weather was not appropriate for a cook out, looked for another recipe, found this one. In addition to bacon and cheese, I sauteed some mushroom pieces in the frying pan with the remaining teriyaki sauce left behind, after browning the chicken. I put the mushrooms a top the bacon pieces before baking in the oven. As for what I served it with, I boiled spiral pasta until al dente (with two chicken boullion cubes in the water, instead o f salt). After removing the cooked chicken from the pan, I.Served the chicken atop the pasta, sprinkled sunflower seeds on it, and with a side salad w/ asian dressing...DELISH.

I made this tonight and 1 word- YUM!!! I just put everything in a slow cooker. Didn't brown the chicken had no bacon bits so I cooked the bacon in the microwave and added, along with the little bit of bacon grease. Used regular onions since that is what I had. Let it cook on low all day and it's wonderful! This is a keeper.

I followed the receipe and tips from other reviewers by using low sodium Ranch, teriyaki, cheese and real, low sodium bacon, not the fake bits.  It was way too salty for me and I'm a salt lover.  Sorry, I won't be making this again.

Absolutely marvelous!  The only thing I did different was used yellow onions because I didn't have any green onions on hand.  I served this with broccoli and cheese rice, peas, and dinner rolls. Great recipe!

I love this recipe. But, I did change the bacon to Canadian bacon (less calories)and the ranch dressing to fat free.  It is very flavorful and easy. I will use this when I need something for a large group.

Interesting combo that works. I only had two bone-in chicken breasts. I began by chopping up some bacon and sauteeing it in a pan, then seared the chicken in the bacon fat. Topped it with the sauce and popped in oven for 45 min (and putting the cheese and bacon crumbled on top the last 10 min.) I used the full sauce amounts for the two pieces of chicken and it was just the right amount.

This was tasty enough. I made it in the crockpot, so it was easy too. At first I forgot the cheese/bacon/green onions. Once I put that mixture on, it perked up somewhat. My family really liked it. I was just so-so. I'd make it again...definitely.

I CAN FIND NO COMPLAINTS. Excellent dish. Tastes great! Just cover with aluminum foil while baking and the cheese won't burn. For all the people complaining about the color...I've made this twice now and the second time I didn't smother it in the teriyaki and ranch...just brushed it on. Tastes the same and cuts back on the saltiness. Made mashed potatoes on side and used bacon bits, cheese and green onions in mashed potatoes. I've been getting weekly requests for this meal.

My family thought this was very good!  The only thing I did different is I used teriyaki flavored chicken and put Hoisin sauce on top.  Hubby loved it.  I didn't think it was salty at all; neither did hubby and he hates salty food.  I will make this one again.  Thanks!

So good. I was a little hesitant to mix ranch dressing and teriyaki sauce, but it came together to make such a great flavor. It was also very easy to make, and I cannot wait to have it again.

Great combination of flavors in this! So easy to put together! I used whatever ingredients I had on hand which was pretty much what the recipe calls for but used Sweet Baby Ray's honey teriaki marinade & covered the bottom of my baking dish with it. I brushed a little bit on the chicken too, but not much. Hubby loved it and he's not a huge fan of chicken. I'll definitely be making this one over & over.

I made this last night and at first glance the flavor combinations in this recipe sound weird. Despite that this chicken is delicous and moist.I marinated the chicken like some of the others suggested.  I am definitely going to make this again and next time I do in a greater quantity because it went to fast.

Wow, what a great new way to fix chicken!  I thought the combination of teriyaki and ranch sounded disgusting but was pleasantly surprised at how well it mixed with the cheese, bacon and onions.  I cut the chicken breasts in bite-size chunks before browning in oil and then drained them on a paper towel.  Next, I mixed the ranch and teriyaki baste together and then dunked each piece of chicken in the mixture before placing in the 9x13 pan.  I spooned the remaining mixture over the chicken and baked for 10 minutes.  I used real crumbled bacon and mixed it with the cheese and onions after the bacon had cooled.  Topped the chicken with this and baked for 10-15 minutes more.  Served over brown rice mixed with shredded carrots and broccoli florets.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is make more sauce to go over the rice and maybe grill the chicken.  Delicious!

This had a very different but absolutely delicious taste to it!  The only thing i did different was to add the teriyaki sauce to the chicken while cooking the chicken in the skillet. It added a lot of flavor to the chicken vs. just adding it to the top in the oven.  Excellent recipe, will definitely make again!

FABULOUS! This is rediculously easy to make and quick quick quick! Next time I will probably double the teriyaki and ranch on top of chicken. I added the cheese, onion, bacon 15 minutes prior to meal being done in oven. I prefer stringy cheese not brown, crusty and burnt cheese.  When I told my husband what we were having for dinner and listed the ingredients...he was not at all thrilled, but changed his tune immediately upon tasting it. I would have never come up with this recipe on my own. If you have the ingredients...make it...I think kids would like this too. Presentation is nice and colorful as well.

I LOVE this recipe! The only thing I did different was used already cook bacon slices (not bacon bits) so that they weren't reall hard and crunchy (just a personal preference). I never thought I'd like ranch, teriyaki and cheese together :-D

This was very good.  I used worcestershire sauce instead of teriyaki because that is what I had.  The whole family ate it up!

My family loved this b/c it had bacon and cheese on it-I gave it 3 stars b/c I thought it was kind of weird.  I used the Teriyaki Glaze from Kikkoman-didn't like the "tangy-ness" of the flavor combo with the ranch.  I prefer to just use bbq sauce on chix, then cheese and bacon.  Definitely edible, but probably won't make again.

Very good, the combination of ingredients may seem a little weird at first but it all works very well together.  I will definitely be making this again!

This one was a mixed bag for us: 3 stars from my husband, and 1 1/2 stars from my 9yr old and myself - split down the middle, I gave this 2 stars.
I was hesitant to try this recipe because of the peculiar ingredients, however based on the rave reviews I gave it a shot.
I made the recipe exactly as is, using real bacon bits (my preference)and Soy Vay Very Very Teriyaki.  Part of the problem may have been the type of teriyaki I used, because this recipe came out almost too sweet.  It's the only teriyaki sauce I ever use, so I was surprised it came out that way. (I've marinated chicken with it in the past, and never had a problem)
My husband had 2 helpings and said he would eat it again, but my daughter and I only got through half of it before turning our plates in.  Our initial response was that we liked it, but the flavors became too much and it kind of got to us both.
My teenager wasn't home, so he'll get the leftovers.  
I probably won't make this again.

I really enjoyed this.  Idreged the chix in flour and brown in evoo.  I love bacon, so I fried(in the micro) several slices and then crumbled.  I waited to add the grn onions, bacon and cheese until the last 10-15 of cooking.  Excellent chicken dish.

this is not something i would make but with the rave reviews i decided to give it a try.  i made a few changes...i marinated the thin-cut chicken in bbq and ranch dressing for about 6 hours then i baked them for approximatly 20 minutes at 350. i added the turkey bacon, scallions and monteray pepper jack cheese. i baked it for an additonal 10 minutes. to my surprise it was pretty good!

I felt there was too many flavors going on in this recipe. Next time Im going to skip the teriyaki and use real bacon. Besides that it was differnt and quite good:) Also Im going to try this in the crock pot maybe that way everything will come together better!

YUM!  I, too, put everything in a crockpot and left it for about 8 hours.  My husband hates Ranch dressing and he loved this recipe.  He didn't know it was there until I told him.  Definitely a keeper!  Would be great with some potatoes or rice.

With all the reviews on this dish I was left a little unimpressed. I followed the recipe to the T and found it was very salty- a bit too much for my taste. While the flavor was good, it really covers the chicken flavor to the point you would have no idea what meat your eating. All in all, it was decent but not a 5 star. Maybe next time I'll use a monteray cheese rather than the saltier cheddar.

I had this recipe in my recipe box for almost a year...I love all the ingredients (especially ranch dressing- I've been known to dunk my French fries in it), but was unsure how they would all taste when combined.  But today, I figured I'd try it, and I was unimpressed.  I followed the recipe exactly. It wasn't a bad taste, definitely edible, but wasn't memorable at all. A little on the salty side, the chicken was moist, the sauce was good for dunking potatoes in, but nothing fabulous. Probably won't make again.

This was really great. I didn't have the bacon, so I left it out. But the flavor was still wonderful. My husband raided the leftovers from the fridge before they could become another meal. I used both boneless/skinless breasts and drumsticks and both were great.

Very easy and very good! My husband thought this was the best chicken he had ever had, due to his love of Ranch dressing. I spiced it up a bit by using Litehouse Jalapeño Ranch and substituted beef bacon as I do not eat pork. This was certainly delicious and has quickly become a family favorite. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!

Our family prefers chicken over beef and it is tough finding different recipes when you serve it as much as we do.  This recipe was a HUGE hit and is now on our list of favorites that will be served over and over again.  We served it with a tossed salad and crispy toasted garlic bread...yummy!!!

I loved this and so did my family. I changed it a little, but I will try it this way eventually. I sprinkled Montreal seasoning on the chicken (saved time by not browning first, just baked for 50 min. @ 375 degrees) then spread the ranch dressing on (omitted teriyaki) and topped with bacon and red onion (didn't have green) added 3 cheese italian blend 10 mins before done. Super moist and super good! Will definitely be making again!

This recipe was great but I had to change a major ingedient.  I really like teriyake sauce but was bummed to find out I didn't have any? So I subsituted Salsa for the teriyaki and added it to the ranch dressing and spooned that on top and added the cheese, bacon (which I cooked in the oven like a previous reviewer suggested) and the green onions and it was a huge hit.  thanks for a great, easy recipe.

Mine turned out really salty. I think it was the kind of teriyaki sauce I picked. Pick one with a pineapple or honey flavor in it. I also used peppered bacon I cooked myself instead of bacon bits, which added a little kick to it. Add the bacon and cheese during the last 15 min. of cook time like someone else suggested. Works great and keeps cheese and bacon from burning. I had this with a side of pears. The sweet of the pears went well with the salty of the chicken.

This is so good. I would strongly suggest these changes. I put everything in a crock pot but the bacon. I also added some Mexican velvetta cheese. When the chicken was done I pan fried real bacon and crumbled on top of the chicken with some Cheddar cheese. Yummy I will make every week so easy.

Very tasty! My husband and I both enjoyed this one. I coated my chicken in egg then flour before browning. Used real bacon. As previous reviews suggested I waited to put the cheese on until last few minutes of cooking time. Next time I might try with a honey BBQ sauce. Either way- will definitely  be making again!!!!

My husband and daughter ate 3 servings a piece of this! The only thing I changed was I fried 8 pieces of bacon and crumbled them up instead of using bacon bits. Excellent!!! Thank You.

I loved this recipe!!!  I was shocked, since I don't really care for ranch. Try adding caramelized onions and replacing the teriyaki with a hickory barbecue sauce for a different yet just as delish dish!

This was pretty good, but, really nothing special for us. I might add it into the rotation from time to time for something different, but, won't be a regular meal for us. Next time I'll try using spicy BBQ sauce instead of teriyaki sauce. Do follow other reviewers' suggestions to add the cheese and bacon at the last 10-15 minutes.
7/28/08 We tried this again with bbq sauce - still didn't care for it.

I enjoyed this recipe but I didn't think it was anything special.  Because it's quick and easy I'm sure I'll make it again.  When I do, I'll skip the bacon and maybe even the cheese.  I didn't think they were necessary.

I rate this a 5 star recipe for flavor, ease and most important in my house "kid friendly."  Anything that the adults and kids love this much is a keeper.  Like the others I added the cheese the last 15 minutes and used real bacon bits.

This was good, but very greasy. If I make it again, I would take it out of the pan as soon as it comes out of the oven. My husband really liked the taste though.

This tasted really good but mine came out very watery. I followed the recipe exactly but I must have done something wrong because I was expecting the sauce to be a little creamier.

I used other reviewers' advice and added the cheese near the end of the cooking time. I also used real bacon, which you can fry up in the same pan you use for the chicken, after the chicken is in the oven. I was surprised at the flavor of the teriyaki and ranch together.  My husband really liked this. I thought it was good, but not fantastic. I gave it four stars for him!

I marinated the chicken first. I also used the cheese a few mintues before removal. Overall it had a good taste, but I will use less green onion and less ranch and less cheese next time. It just all seemed a little too ovewrwhelming.

Very interesting, my husband absolutley LOVED this!  I thought it was very tasty, the flavors marry much better than you think they would.  Like some of the other reviewers, I waited until the last 15 minutes to add the bacon and cheese.

This chicken was pretty good.  I used leftover bone-in thighs from the other night, just mixed the teri-ranch together poured it over the chix, topped it w/ a bunch of cheese and finished it w/ those fried onions.  I didnt have bacon bits and didnt want to fry some but it turned out great!

This was not as good as I had hoped it would be.  I love chicken but my husband is not a big fan of chicken.  I was hoping this would change his mind.  Nope. I did not care for the taste either.  It might be that I am not a fan of bacon-bits.  I will just need to find another chicken recipe to try.

Simply amazing. This is one of the finest tasting chicken dishes that has ever come out of my kitchen. My family was thrilled over this! The chicken was so tender and delicious. I told a friend of mine who runs a restaurant about this dish and how pretty the presentation could be with bacon strips wrapped around the chicken. This is a wonderful dish. Thank you Vicki!

I made this for my very picky boyfriend and he described it as an "avalanch of flavor".  Neither of us eat bacon, so I simply omitted that, otherwise followed exactly.  Thanks a lot!

I was having a very hectic day. I gave verbal instructions to my husband, hoping it would turn out edible. WOW!  It was fantastic. He had a big grin on his face through dinner. I'm not sure if it's because he was pleased with himself or because it was so delicious. Either way, he was right.

If there were 6 stars, I'd give them!  This recipe is SO easy and tasty, I'm glad I made two meals' worth! I had no teriyaki sauce, so I used Marian Collins's Baked Tariyaki Chicken recipe for her sauce. Very good!

I wasn't sure how this recipe would turn out? I thought ranch w/ teriyaki?? I took some advice from others and mix the ranch & teriyaki together. I used Kikkoman Teriyaki Baste & Glaze. Layered the bottom of the pan with the glaze. Used real bacon, added the cheese, bacon & green onion last 15 mins. WOW, it was GREAT!!! My kids are pickey and they ate every bit. My hubby and his parents told me to fix it again & again!!So,I guess this is a keeper in my home. Thanks!!

My oh my... this was delicious! My kids kept saying it was yummy. My son (who is extremely picky eater) was saying that this is the best chicken dish I've ever made and asking me to make it again soon. I used real bacon and followed the suggestion made by others and added the cheese, bacon and green onions after 15 minutes of baking. Thank you, Vicky, for putting smiles in all our faces and for sharing this great recipe!

I used thighs (because that's what I had). This was a good easy recipe to make with stuff you probably already have. I'm just sorry I only had 4 thighs. My son was the only one who got seconds..

outstanding recipe!!! changes I made: I fried up some peppered thick cut bacon and browned the chicken in the residue of the bacon grease. I added a thin layer of teriyaki sauce to the 9x13 pan  and I added my teriyaki to the ranch dressing and spooned it on. I added the bacon and cheese in the last 15 mins of baking. served with scalloped potatoes :) YUMMM!! it's a keeper!

The sauce I used tasted bad, still gave it 4 stars b/c I think it'd be good otherwise. I don't recommend Jack Daniels sauce, gross. Is a basting sauce thinner? I'll have to look into that, I'd also like to try bbq sauce instead.

I really like this recipe! It was simple and delicious! An odd combination but tasty. I made with mashed potatoes and used the sauce left in the pan for a gravy. Very good just be careful not to add too much to the potatoes because it is very strong! Great recipe..thanks! Definite keeper!

If I could give this more *'s I would.  My entire family ranted & raved about how great this was hours after dinner.  I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I did differently was I added the cheese & bacon during the last ten minutes of baking. (didn't want cheese to burn/blacken) This is a must try.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.  I think this would be good on butterfly pork chops too.

I really like this recipe. It is a very rich chicken dish with all that cheese, so make sure you have some light rice on the side not to overdo the whole dinner. All in all the taste was very good but I overcooked it a little since my chicken breasts were on a small side and even 25 minutes made them dry. As previous reviews say - add the cheese in the last 10-15 minutes and try using fresh bacon instead of bacon bits. My bacon bits were very salty.

I made this recipe for my family and everyone LOVED it! Like the others suggested, I held off on the cheese and bacon until the last 10 minutes, and it was nice and gooey. And I used real bacon istead of bacon bits. I also added a bit extra teriyaki sauce to the bottom of the pan, and then brushed the chicken with the amount the recipe calls for. The chicken stayed SUPER moist, and everyone commented on how flavorful it was. Very easy to make, and the boys were taking pieces of crusty bread and wiping the pan with them, making sure they got every last drop of the leftover sauce and cheese. This will definetly be a recipe I make over and over!

It seems like everyone is right about this recipe.  It's to DIE for.  I lightly breaded the chicken as some suggested (just dipped in egg and flour) and then continued with the recipe as written.  I think next time I will put on the cheese 10-15 minutes before taking it out of the oven because it melted a little too soon and got a bit crispy, rather than gooey.  But crispy was pretty darn good, too.  I'll no doubt be making this one again and again and again.

Awesome awesome awesome.  I had my sister over for dinner and she looked at itt b4 i put it in the oven and she said that it looked good and she asked what was on it and i told her and she scrunched up her nose and said i never thought of putting that stuff on there.  I could tell she did not think that it was going to be good.  Boy was she surprised she kept going on and on about how good it was.  I made it exactly as the recipe said and I would not change a thing.

One word- AMAZING!! I followed some of the reviews and dipped in egg and flour then lightly fried them. Then in the last 5 minutes I crumbled fried bacon  and cheddar over the chicken.  Couldn't have turned out better!!

This recipe doesn't need yet another review but I felt the need to add that although the name of this dish is silly the flavor is definitely not silly.  I like the fact that none of the ingredients stand out but together they produce an incredible taste sensation in the mouth.  I made this dish so many times I'm afraid that we'll tire of it, but it hasn't happened yet.  Thanks Vicki!!

Absolutely amazing!  This one is definitely a keeper.  I only wish that I had more time to marinate the chicken in the teriyaki sauce.  I marinated it for about 20 minutes and it still turned out amazing!  Thanks

My husband has been complaining because he says all we ever eat is chicken, chicken or chicken. I love chicken, apparently he doesn’t. I knew I would get the same reaction to what’s for dinner, but he loved this recipe! He ate 3 chicken breasts! I will defiantly be making it again. I did marinade the chicken in a 30 min teriyaki marinade 1st and also put the cheese and bacon on the last 10 minutes. Very Yummy!

This is the 2nd time we have made this recipe and my whole family loves it!! Even my young kids will eat this!! It is super easy and quick. I did everything to the letter except I use the Hormel real bacon bits and added them and the cheese in the last 15 minutes of baking. We also used A-1 teriaky sauce as this was the only thing we could find that was thick enough and tastes really good.

Just as good as I thought it would be. I used lowfat dressing and cheese and went easy on the teryaki (not a big fan). My husband loved it , and he is hard to please, so now it's in regular rotation on the dinner menu. Thanks for a great recipe!

i didn't marinade the chicken, because i didn't have time, although marinating in this recipe is a MUST. i thought this recipe was very bland. it didn't have a punch of flavors. the ranch and teriyaki was alright, but didnt't stand out enough. i think even if i had marinated the chicken it wouldn't have been savory enough. i was skeptical initially, but the ratings appealed to me. i guess i was right.

Very good! I made this for our anniversary.  My husband would give it 10 stars if he could.  Note: I basted the chicken with teriaki sauce on the BBQ, and grilled the bacon also.  We also had some 4-year old aged white cheddar on hand, which added the right zing to the dish.  will definately make again.

We had company over on Saturday and I was nervous about making this recipe since I had not tried it out first.  It was turned out really good.  It looked nice and it was different from anything else I have made in the past.  Everyone liked it.  It was an easy recipe to do.  I did mix the ranch and teriyaki together.  I also used real bacon bits which was easier then frying up bacon.  I added extra ranch and teriyaki to the chicken so there was enough sauce to put on the mashed potatoes and i served corn and rolls.  I will make it again.

This was pretty good - but the flavors didn't blend well for me.  I didn't like the bacon.  I think I might leave the cheese out next time so the flavor is focused on the teriyaki and ranch combination, which I think is interesting and good!  The cheese becomes overpowering.  Will try again with alterations. Thanks.

I made this recipe exactly as it was written and it was fabulous!  I love the smothered chicken at a local restaurant and this was exactly like it which is what I was hoping.  My extremely finicky 15 year old son even had a smile on his face and said this recipe was definately a keeper!  Thank you!!

A good throw together meal that is a change of pace in tastes.  I also would suggest adding the cheese the last few minutes, because it did burn off a bit.  I also think a past reviewer had a good idea about using real bacon strips, bacon bits just get lost on top of the chicken.

This meal was absolutely delicious! My two year old was asking for seconds! I usually turn my nose up at ranch dressing, but the combination of it and the teriyaki sauce was very tasty. I was pleasantly surprised. The only variation I made was taking the advice of others and adding the cheese, bacon, and green onions until the last ten minutes. This is a keeper!

I made the lower fat version,everything reduced.  I didn't have teriyaki like another reader and subsituted balsamic vinegar and soy, 1/4 cup ea. and 1 tblsp. of sugar as suggested.  I got a little creative and added fresh asparagus and mushrooms. Served this for the kids over rice, my husbands over noodles.  My husband and kids loved this.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Kathy

So delicious! I would never think to combine the sauces. A family favorite. I find the kind of sauce you use make sall the difference in the worls. I always use Hy's teriyaki sauce and Hidden valley ranch dressing.

What a fun and wonderful recipe!  Made this for the family last night, really enjoyed it. I used real bacon that i had cut up and cooked, then I browned the chicken in the bacon grease. Will be adding this to our favorites!

Wonderful blend of flavor, have made a couple of times and always turns out moist and delicious.  Didn't have Ranch dressing on hand and used Creamy Caesar and still turned out great.  Quick and easy.  Thanks this one is a keeper!

This was easy and delicious. To make it even easier, I didn't brown the chicken first. I just put it into the baking dish and put the other ingredients on top of the chicken.

This was a good recipe.  I really didn't taste the teriyaki or ranch much, but I'm sure it added subtle flavor.  I thought this recipe was similar to "Aussie Chicken" that's also on this website, which I like better.

Hubby gave it 3.5 stars...I gave it 3. I would definitely cut slits in the chicken and marinate it in the Terryaki sauce for a while before cooking. The topping tasted great, but the inside of the chicken was pretty bland.

Easy, quick and tasty.  What more could you ask for in a weeknight meal?  I grilled the chicken, then just approximated the amounts of toppings, using lo-fat dressing and cheese.  Will make again since this recipe uses common pantry items.  Thanks!

This was excellent and my family loved it.  I made a two minor changes (1)on half of the chicken breasts, I used honey mustard dressing instead of ranch (2) we don't like green onions, so I substituted diced tomatoes.  This will definitely be added to my "keeper" folder.

This recipe is great.....and much less greasy if you grill the chicken.  Marinade in teriyaki sauce, grill....when chicken is almost done, baste with ranch dressing, bacon, cheese, and green onions.  Our summer favorite!

I was really disapointed in the way this tasted when it was done, just seemed as if it would be wonderful, and none of us cared for it. Probably not the recipes fault, LOL, but the our take on it, never the less.

This was a little better thatn okay.  There was something that just didn't sit well with me....maybe the ranch?  I love ranch dressing, but it just didn't taste quite right.  I would make again leaving out the ranch.

I thought there were too many flavors piled on top of each other, which made for no distinct flavor.

This recipies was awesome!!! I'm only 13 and I could make it myself-- even my brothers admitted it was good! I made homemade teriyaki sauce and mixed it with the ranch before pouring it on the chicken. I also used real bacon.

This recipe was excellent! Mixed teriyaki with ranch dressing and added the cheese and real bacon bits halfway through cooking time. Husband wasn't sure at first due to color of sauce but after one taste, he loved it. Defintely a keeper.

My whole family loved this.  I marinated the chicken in the teriyaki sauce first, and added the cheese about halfway through the baking.  It turned out fabulous.  And the house smelled so good.

This was a bit too rich and salty for us. I used real bacon which I cooked before adding to the chicken. I combined the ranch & teriyaki sauces and poured them over the chicken rather than just basting (the teriyaki sauce). It did taste nice but after a couple of mouthfuls I couldn't eat any more (due to the salty/rich flavour).

Definitly has potential.  Things I will do next time....definitly marinade the chx in the teriyaki sauce or find some way for the sauce to stick to the breasts better...perhaps mixing it with the ranch as others suggested.  I made my teriyaki sauce from the site.  I would have given this a 3 but i'm pretty sure i could make it a 4.

This is my first review. I was looking at someone else's reviews and saw they reviewed this one. I came across this recipe 2 or 3 years ago. I have been making it since, only I use soy sauce instead of teriyaki (I only had soy the 1st time I made it.) My husband, son, mom, EVERYONE LOVES this recipe. I dont think it is salty at all. And I dont use bacon bits, (used to and they are great, just cant eat them anymore). I will continue to make this one for a long time. We make it about once a week. This is one of my favorite recipes ever and whoever put it on here or wherever I found it, thank you very much!

The only reason I made this recipe is because it was in the hall of fame. The mix looked akward to me and it definitely turned out to be. I also want to point out that even if some reviewers suggested to add the cheese 10 minutes before the end, this did not prevent everything from falling apart.

This dish is tasty and my family likes it, and I have made it several times but to me it is very salty  (Salty bacon bits, salty cheese, salty dressing, salty teriyaki sauce) and very greasy.  Just too much saltiness.  I found it is much better with less of everything and a buttermilk ranch and the prepackaged teriyaki marinated "Foster Farms" chicken.  Their teriyaki sauce is more sweet than salty.  The Kikoman teriyaki sauce is just kind of too much salt, better to try a sweeter brand or a low sodium version.  Otherwise this dish really is a heart attack waiting to happen.

It is good, just not really great because of the salty fatty nature of it.

I didn't think this was that great, but I am giving it 4 stars because my husband and kids really seemed to like it. I think it needed more sauce so there would be enough so serve over rice.

This was delicious!  My husband loved it, too. Very interesting combination of topping ingredients. Came out a little less tender than I'd like, but maybe I sauteed it too long, or because half of the chicken breasts I used came out of the freezer? Still excellent and will definitely make it again.

This was ok. Nothing to really rave about. Not quite four stars, but not really 3 to me either. I doubled the dressing and it still was not really enough. I might try it again. My fiancee liked it quite a bit as he ate all of it, but I don't know if he was just really hungry or he really liked it and wouldn't say. As when I asked him what he thought he said it was good, but he didn't rave about it. This might be better if the chicken was cut into smaller pieces so the dressing could get all over it better.

If possible, I would give this recipe six stars. It was so simple and the flavors were great. I would definately not skip out on the bacon, it added a lot more than I anticipated.

Following advice of other reviewers, we made the following modifications: 1. used 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce to reduce saltiness, 2. used low-fat/lite Ranch dressing, 3. used regular bacon (no bacon bits at our neighborhood grocery store).  Also, we cut the chicken into small pieces, and garnished with extra scallions.  My hubby served it over rice and with string beans.  This was a real winner!  We'll make it again...

This was great! My husband loved it, and my two-year-old was even saying "good". Served with rice and broccoli. Only changes were I cut the teriyaki sauce down to 1/4 cup, used good old regular bacon, and of course a little extra cheese.

My family loves this.  It's easy and delicious.  The only changes I made were to use regular onions (all I had on hand) and to use real bacon instead of bacon bits.  I also cut the teriyake sauce back to 1/4 cup because it was a little too salty for us using 1/2 cup.  This has become a regular at our house.

This chicken is delicious!!  My whole family loved it - even the picky kids.  I used the reduced sodium teriyaki as others suggested, but reduced the amount by about half  I also used fresh bacon, cooked and crumbled.  Save a bit of the cheese to sprinkle over the bacon and onions - it will keep them from drying out.  I served with rice and scooped some of the pan drippings over the rice.  Yum!  Can't imagine anyone giving this one less than 5 stars.

Not great, sorry. If I had to describe the problem, I would say that it was as if the flavors were fighting eachother instead of working together.

We loved this recipe!  I would never have thought of using ranch dressing and teriyaki sauce in the same dish, but the combo was great.  I didn't have teriyaki sauce on hand, so I made my own by just mixing soy sauce and some sugar.  I'm also a fan of using a breast tenders for this recipe, since they are easier to cook and the flavor gets in better.

This is very good! I cut up the chicken breasts in halves before browning them. I used real bacon instead of bacon bits; just cooked the bacon and crumbled it over when needed.

This is excellent for company or family meals. I'm a weight watcher so I used less cheese and more green onions. The green onions really gave this chicken a fameous chef's touch. Thank you for sharing. It is a crowd pleaser. Verna01

This is a GREAT recipe to make anytime...and a breeze to make after work. I do use low sodium terriyaki sauce to keep down the salt content and it doesn't change the taste. I've shared it with a number of friends and everyone raves about it.  My  16 year old son told me the other day that this is his all time favorite thing I make!!

I really like this chicken dish. The only thing that  kept it from 5 stars was the salt content. I now use low-sodium bacon and reduced sodium terriyaki sauce, and I leave out the green onions. My family LIKED it, not as much as I did, but I'm the cook so I get to make it when I have the craving! I might try it with the honey bbq suace like another reader suggested. Thank you!

I very much enjoyed this chicken dish. My husband didn't like it as much. He's not much of a fan of cheese on his chicken and the bacon bits made the dish a little salty. Overall I thought it was very good though. Thanks!

The chicken looked fantastic with the green onion and red bacon. I served it to my in-laws and they raved about it! One thing that bothered me a bit was that there was a lot of not-so-nice-looking liquid in my dish at the end of baking and most of the bacon was floating in it. I used real bacon by microwaving 5 slices on a papertowel lined plate for 4 minutes. To save time, I did this earlier in the day. Then I crumbled it and and stored it with the sliced green onions in the fridge. When it was time to make the chicken, I was able to assemble them quickly. Overall, a great dish for company. Thanks for sharing.

Wow!  This is a wonderful recipe.  I took a few suggestions from past reviewers and it turned out great.  Here is what I did,  I marinated the chicken overnight in teriyaki sauce.  Then, I browned the chicken in a pan with oil.  After removing the chicken, I sautéed mushrooms, green onions, and bacon in the pan juices.  I baked the chicken alone for about 25 minutes.  Then added the teriyaki, ranch, mushrooms, green onions, bacon, and cheese.  In 10 minutes it was ready.  This was so yummy.  We loved it!  I can't wait to make it for company.  Thanks.

This was very tasty! I wasn't sure about the teriyaki with the ranch dressing, but it was quite yummy!  Since it had an Asian flavor, I served with chicken-fried rice and eggrolls.

With so many rave reviews, I was expecting to be blown away by this dish. That was not the case. It was barely better than average. It wasn't bad but it's an overrated recipe and didn't live up to my review-hyped expectations. My boyfriend agreed with me.

surprisingly really tasty. the ingredients sound weird, but it really is full of flavor.  i used garlic flavored teriyaki and marinated the chicken in half the teriyaki before i browned it. 
i also added the cheese, bacon, and onion during the last 10 minutes of cooking.  thanks vicki!!!

This is an interesting combination of flavors and we enjoyed it quite well. I wasn't sure how all the varied flavors would work together, so I went a little easy on everything so as not to waste a bunch of ingredients in case it wasn't good! But I was pleasantly surprised and will be making this again.  I did find it a slight bit salty, so next time I will probably use minimal teriyaki sauce and more of the ranch dressing.  The bacon (I used real crumbled bacon vs. the bacon bits) and green onion really added a nice twist.  A keeper....thanks!

This recipe was great, I did make it a one-pan recipe.  After I browned the chicken I left it in the pan and added the teriyaki sauce, ranch, bacon bits & onions.  Put it in the oven and added the cheese during the last 5 minutes.  This one is a great weeknight dish.

This was delicious! I agree with other reviewers about how it looks, kinda greasy and goopy, BUT the taste was great. My kids gobbled it up and they have a problem with the way food looks sometimes. I could barely wait to try it; it smelled so good while it was cooking. I may change one thing next time and use real bacon for a little more flavor. Other than that, GREAT! Thanks Vicki!!

Delicious recipe.  Even my picky three year old loved it!  Next time, I may reduce the 
teriyaki sauce (it turned out a bit salty) and the ranch dressing.  (they were both overflowing
on the chicken)  Also, the sauce that didn't flowed off the chicken was burning, so I'll either 
use a smaller pan or cover the nonchicken areas with foil.

This recipe was a tasty and SIMPLE surprise!  Though I dislike ranch dressing I followed the recipe as written and it was delicious.  In fact my whole family liked it.  I left the green onions off of my young son's and he enjoyed it, too.  Very nice recipe.

The flavor of this was not as good as I anticipated although the leftovers made good sandwiches.  I think I let it cook a little too long and the chicken was dry.  I will try this again with some modifications.

I know this recipe has been reviewed hundreds of times but I wanted to add my praise.  My husband doesn't like to eat chicken, he gets bored with it but he ate seconds of this dish.  I make this to use up some of the cheaper brands of ranch dressing that we have on hand.  I used real bacon instead of the bacon bits and browned the chicken in the bacon grease (super healthy) and this has turned out wonderfully each time.  I think I'll make it again tonight!

I thought this recipe would be good and I made it just like the recipe stated and it was just okay.  My husband didn't like it at all.  It is not one I'd make again.  The teriyaki with the ranch dressing is not a good flavor mix.

Was excellent.  Next time I will marinate the chicken in the Teriaki sauce before hand, for more flavor.  Had not Ranch dressing, only sour cream on hand and it was great!  Will make again!

This was okay.  I didn't think it was as wonderful as some of the other reviews suggested--and for the life of me, I can't figure out what the salad dressing was for!  I couldn't taste that at all.  I probably won't make this again.

Luckily I served this to guests who thought it is good enough to make again.  Unfortunately, my husband said the taste was tolerable, but did not like the combination and I thought it was "just okay."  I only try recipes with a 5-star rating, so this time we were surprised with our rating, even though guests were pleased.

Fantastic! Everyone loves it. I like to use a thick terriyaki sauce that makes it a bit tangier.

Excellent!  Then again, just about anything smothered in cheese and bacon is good.  The rest of the ingredients are an odd combination, but they blended very well.

My family LOVED this chicken dish.  The house smelled wonderful while it was cooking, picky 2 year old daughter ate it up asking for more.
Thank you for submitting this recipe.

After all the reviews, I decided to try this. I liked it but not as much as the reviews stated I would. I thought it lacked in flavor and needs something else. It just didn't have that UMPH that I thought I was going to get. I am going to try it again and find out what it needs. Maybe it should be marinated with the teriaki instead of just being brushed. However it was okay and definetly something I want to try again.

As my husband kept saying, very flavorful.  The leftovers were also good chopped up in a salad the next afternoon.  This will become a regular dish in our home.  Thanks for sharing.

I read the rave reviews so I had to try this one.  It was easy and tasty.  It was a little "heavy" for my tastes...I prefer something lighter.  I sustituted light ingreadients and kept the teriyaki to 1/4 cup.  My husband, on the other hand, really loved it and wants me to add it to our "menu."  Definitely something for someone who has a salt tooth and doesn't mind something "heavier"

I would make this all the time in college because it was so easy and combined all my favorite foods!!! I definitely add more ranch dressing because it seems to disapear when you cook it. OUTSTANDING

This turned out quite well.  I would only suggest using a bit more ranch dressing and teriyaki sauce.  Also, I used real bacon instead of the bacon bits.  Overall a great meal!

The mixture of ingredients made me think twice about making this dish but I am so glad I did! I didn't have teriyaki sauce so I used a barbecue sauce the results were amazing, It is now top of the favourite list

Five stars all the way.  Perhaps the best thing to happen to chicken in 50 years.  Such an interesting flavor and so easy to make!  Will be making this again.  It knocked my socks off.

I was skeptical of the combination of ingredients at first, but WOW!  Everyone I've served it to loves it!  I use real bacon and a teriyaki glaze (instead of the marinade--it's a little thicker and holds the flavor better since you don't have to marinate over night).  This is a simple recipe to follow.  Quite tasty!

Add me to the ever-growing list of people who LOVE this recipe, and whose children gobbled this up!!  I also used real bacon (can't bring myself to buy never mind use bacon bits!).  I made my own Ranch dressing from the mix and light mayo and skim milk, and used 2% cheddar with the hope that I've lightened this wonderful recipe a bit.  I couldn't tell the difference.  Even if, like me, you are feeling a little squeamish at the thought of all these ingredients together, you MUST try this!!  Like those brave souls who first tried mushrooms and oysters, this discovery is delicious!!

Very easy and tasty!!  The bacon bits gave it a good smokey taste and the cheese was a kid-pleaser!  I added bacon bits, onions, and cheese the last ten minutes and it turned out ooey-gooey great!!!  A regular on our menu for sure!!

This recipe was delicious.  I would have never thought to mix ranch dressing with Teriyaki but what a combination!  I added chopped baby portabella mushrooms as well.  I really enjoy making this recipe and it was a big hit!!!

Loved it!  I thought it was a weird combination of ingredients but it did turn out good.  I added the cheese and green onions during the last 10 minutes also. Teriyaki sauces vary in their degrees of sweetness/saltiness so choose according to your taste.  I like mine on the sweet side so I used La Choy's brand teriyaki sauce.  I know the Kikkoman sauces are too salty for my taste.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a very different and fun recipe.  The taste is quite unique.  I agree that it tastes a bit too salty (not too bad though) -- next time I will use low-sodium Teriyaki sauce and perhaps add a little bit of water to the sauce.  I definately recommend this recipe.  Serve with rice and spoon the extra sauce over the rice.  Steamed broccoli is a good light vegetable to serve with this.  I also used low-fat Ranch dressing and low-fat Hormel Bacon-Bits to make an easy and low-fat meal.  Very easy to make as well.  Thank you for sharing.

I have to add my rave reviews to the many already received.  I made this for my boyfriend, a die hard bacon lover, as a surprise one night but surprise!  he'd had it before.  His mother got the recipe from her western PA family.  I'd never heard of it before and was a little wary of the soy/ ranch combo but this was quick, easy, really good, and unlike many recipes I find online, used ingredients I already had in the house.  Thanks!

Both my husband and I thought this recipe was very tasty. Since I read that many people thought it was too salty, I reduced the teriyaki sauce to 1/4 cup and that was plenty. I also increased the ranch dressing to 1/2 cup.  I also used 3 slices of cooked real bacon, crumbled.  It has a quite rich flavor, very good!  Definitely not a health conscious recipe though.

Has alot of flavor. My 12 year old thought it was too salty. I would make it again, but I would use less teriyaki and add more ranch.

Thanks for sharing this terrific chicken recipe Vicki.  My husband usually cringes when he hears that we are trying a new recipe from the internet.  Now he requests this dish as "Internet Chicken"!

After all of the rave reviews, I was a little dissapointed. I thought that it was OK but nothing to rave about! Didn't have alot of flavor. I would like to make it again but I would marinade the chicken in teriyaki overnight. I think it might have more flavor that way.

Very tasty recipe!!!  I only used 2 very large chicken breasts and there was barely enough sauce...will double the sauce next time.  I also will add a little cream or milk to the sauce to make it a little on the creamy side.  Highly recommend this recipe...YUMMY!

I think that this recipe is wonderful. To cut down the fat I used fat-free ranch dressing and no bacon bits.  It turned out wonderful.  I have used the recipe three times already.  I totally recommend it.

I used skinless only chicken breasts.  Chicken was moist even though it was baked without a cover. Family enjoyed. Will make again.

I had these chicken breasts in my refrigerator
for 2 days trying to figure out what to do with 
them.  I came across this recipe and I actually
had all the ingredients here to make it minus
the bacon as we don't eat pork.  It was a big
hit.  We absolutely loved it and it was soooo
easy to make!!  Thank you to who ever submitted
this recipe.  I love it and will make it often!!

I made this recipe because it looked really interesting.  I was impressed!  It had a good flavor and was relatively easy to make.  It was the first time I had ever had chicken and bacon together, and though I'm usually a skeptic, I liked it.  The only thing is that you have to use a good amount of dressing because the chicken can go dry while baking.

This was delicious!  My only change in the recipe was putting the chicken in the basting sauce to marinade for a few hours first.  I followed the recipe as written for the rest of the ingredients.  My family loved it!

This will now be one of my "go to" recipes for chicken - both for family meals and for entertaining.
Only two slight changes, I used brown sugar instead of white sugar, and I added a little more ginger.
DELICIOUS!

very good recipe! Easy because ingredients are what I normally have in stock.  Would have like more of a gravey (per hubby) but other than that very good.  I did use the recommendations of others to use real bacon and brown chicken in the bacon fat. I also added the cheese and bacon the last 10 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so easy and although I thought the flavor combination of teriyaki & ranch was unusual, it really was delicious. My son in law is a chef and he was surprised how good it was and now makes it himself.

We made this chicken to feed almost 100 guests at a homeless shelter and everyone loved it. It was easy to make and tasted great. I didn’t really make changes to the recipe except to increase the quantities...by a lot!

SALTY! I should have realized with packaged sauce and dressing, cheese and bacon that this dish would be salty. But it didn't occur to me until after I had eaten it and had tremendous thirst. I gave it two stars because it was tasty, but this recipe is a 'no' for anyone with salt restrictions or just isn't used to a lot of salt in their diet.

I made this several times. the only change I made was instead of using bacon bits; I took 3 strips of bacon browned it broke the bacon into bite size & sprinkled it over the cheese. My husband & I love it.

This is a definite keeper and will do well for a company dinner. I marinated the chicken in the Teriyaki basting sauce for 2 hours and added the ranch dressing to the remaining marinade prior to spreading on the chicken breasts.  I used regular bacon that I had cooked previously.  I covered the casserole dish with foil and baked 35-40 minutes due to the size of the chicken breasts.  The chicken was very flavorful and moist.  I served with mixed vegetables and mashed potatoes.  The sauce was great on the potatoes.  Thanks VICKI.

I had such hopes that this would turn out tasty, given so many  5-star ratings.  I followed the recipe to a T.   It tasted so  bland, although the guys in my household liked it.  I wonder if I had covered it with foil if it wouldn't have turned out so dry. Oh well ...

I will definitely make this dish again. I seasoned the meat before I sauteed it with garlic powder, onion powder, and poultry seasoning. I used a teriyaki  glaze instead of the marinade. Other than that, I followed the recipe. This recipe indeed is the bomb.com. LOVE IT!

Delicious recipe! I added a citrus lime rub to the chicken and some fresh lime juice at the end. Highly recommend this addition if you want a little zest!

I've made this dish several times now & my family likes it.  I don't change anything when making a recipe for the first time.  However, after reading the reviews I decided to divide the dish (1st time) when I made it. One dish was exactly as it calls, and the other with a slight "tweek".  The "tweeked" dish won my family over. I only did a few simple things different:  1) used a low sodium teriyaki, 2) mixed teriyaki with ranch & tossed chicken in it,  3) used real bacon, 4) covered with foil. when baking.

Wasn't great, wasn't terrible.  Tasted like something that would be served at a wedding in a banquet hall.  Won't be making it again.  Not worth the fat and calories of the ranch, bacon and cheese.

Good but not great.  I do like how easy it is to put together, though.  I  skipped the pan and baked it for 30 minutes.  I found this recipe to be quite salty but okay in a pinch.

I followed a couple of other comments and did not brown the chicken and used the Teriyaki baste and glaze instead of marinade. Plus used low salt bacon.  It was fabulous!!!  Wonderful flavors to spark up chicken!

It broke my heart that my husband and I did not like this recipe!  It sounded delicious and I followed all the directions, used fresh, organic chicken and the best ingredients.   It was just so-so.  I don't know if I'm allowed to say this, but lately a lot of the recipes I've tried haven't been that great.  I'm thinking about solely using Chef John's recipes.  They are AMAZING.  No one else's compare.

I was a bit hesitant to try this - because ranch and teriyaki sauce, really??  After reading the reviews I decided to give it a try and am so glad I did.  My husband and I loved this!  No changes to the recipe, but we did need a lot of extra time to cook the chicken all the way through. I think the next time I make this I am going to try it in the slow cooker.

Did an overhaul on this due to my intense dietary restrictions. Used tofu in place of chicken, made my own teriyaki basting sauce using oil, liquid aminos, and vinegar, garlic and ginger. Then, I used a zero-calorie Ranch dressing. The end result: an odd chemical reaction that turned the garlic blue-green and a scrumptious piece of tofu!

I made this on Valentine's Day for my family, and it was a huge hit.  Didn't make any changes other than I used chicken tenderloins and an entire bottle of the basting sauce in the baking dish so that we had sauce to pour over cous cous  that I served on the side.  Also, made Parmesan Asparagus from AllRecipes.  Everything was absolutely delicious and will be on the rotation.

This was delicious!! I eyeballed the ranch and shredded cheese because I'm a big fan of both. I made sure to only SLIGHTLY brown the chicken before putting it into the pan and basting it. It came out perfectly and I served it with a broccoli rice cheese casserole and some warm french bread.

Never thought of teriyaki and ranch together...Delish!!! Added cheese on last halfway through baking, and put it over brown rice!  The teriyaki and ranch made a yummy sauce I drizzled over everything.

I made it just like the recipe and video showed and my family loved it! We will definitely make it again, as all the kids said, "it's a keeper!" Just make sure that when you sear the chicken, the oil is very hot.

I didn't have any green onions, but while I was browning the chicken, I fried some onions lightly.  It was good (I really liked it), however my family ate it without the usual "THIS IS AWESOME!" comments that I usually get from dishes like this.  Definitely something I'll make again, however--very easy to make.

My 11 year old Autistic son actually ate this and he doesn't eat ANYTHING except pizza, hamburgers and hot dogs! It really was good.  Next time I'll try some of the other suggestions on cooking it and see if it works a little better.

Made as directed. In the future we decided to again make with Amy's mashed cauliflower recipe, double the juices with the chicken, and place the chicken on the cauliflower in something similar to Sheppard's Pie.

Big hit with the family!  I made it with chicken cutlets, for that reason I only heated it up for 5 min. in a 350` oven,.  The chicken cooked thoroughly on the stove top .  Other then that I followed the recipe as written ...oh yes, with one small exception...I used real crumbled bacon from a bag, not bacon bits.

Tasted great, even though there were some hiccups on my part while making in. Made my own Teriyaki sauce which got a bit messy. I can only imagine that it would've tasted even better had everything gone smoothly.

This was so easy and delicious! Definitely making this again. Instead of bacon bits, I cooked up bacon and then cut it up and garnished the top. While the chicken was cooking, I used some of the bacon grease to cook some vegetables like bell pepper, onion, garlic, and mushrooms with no seasonings because of the bacon juices. After the chicken was done cooking I served the chicken and vegetables over linguine noodles.

Fantastic!!! Made my own teriyaki sauce (don't buy it--so easy to make and there are several recipes on here you can use) and did not have bacon bits. Recipe is delicious! Will definitely make this again. Kids loved it.

I was scared to try this recipe because the combination of ingredients did not sound appealing, but finally gave it a shot because of the good reviews. We all loved this dish! The only things I did differently was use chicken tenderloins, marinated the chicken for 30 minutes in the teriyaki sauce and baked in the oven for less time since using tenderloins. This was a great easy recipe! Surprising how good it was.

I've made this several times in the last few months and it's a favorite. I can't eat onions, so I substituted frozen baby spinach. Don't skimp on t he teriyaki or ranch, it makes an AWESOME sauce! I didn't use fake bacon bits: I always cook bacon while the chicken is cooking, but in the microwave.  For the cheese topping, I use a Colby jack/Monterey jack combo, finely shredded and LOTS of it! It's easy and delicious!

I have made this twice and my family loves it. I think that cutting up and frying real bacon is a must. I also think it turned out better when I mixed up the dressing and baste sauce. Definitely a part of my monthly rotation now..

This is great!  I did do the suggestion of cooking most of the way and then adding the bacon and cheese for the last 5-10 minutes.  either way was good!  So good that my husband made me make it twice within a week!

Kids and adults liked this chicken!  I butterflied the chicken breast since I only had 3 and reduced the cook time a bit.  I had the one left over piece for breakfast and it warms up well and still tasted great!

Followed the recipe to the T. My only problem was that the only teriyaki basting sauce I could find was Kikkoman and I found it to be very salty. Next time, I would probably use 1/2 the amount called for or try a different teriyaki marinade. Everything else about this dish was great and smelled even better!

Like other reviews, thought it an odd combo but my family loved it.  I did n't find it overly salty (soy is salty inherently). i used kikkoman teriyaki baste and glaze as it has a far lower sodium content.  After I browned the Chix, i sauteed 2 green onions, 1/2 leek and portabello mushrooms.  Then followed directions, baking 20 min and then adding cheese for final time.    I served it over angel hair pasta with a caesar salad.  It would be nice over rice or mashed potatoes as well as there is plenty of sauce.  My husband said it's a keeper!

It was simple to make, just found it very bland, ended up adding some Franks red hot to give it a nice flavour.

Cooked in crockpot 5 hours on high. Didn't use bacon or oil. Used "teriyaki baste & glaze with honey & pineapple"

I would wait to add the cheese until the last 10 minutes to avoid it getting too dry.  Great flavor combo between the teriyaki and ranch.

My kids and husband have requested this every week since I originally made it a month ago! The only thing I change is, I crumble real bacon instead of using the bacon bits. It has become a favorite at my house, which is a feat with my very picky 7 and 3 year old!

Most nights I get complaints about chicken breast for dinner, but not with this delicious recipe.  It was a family pleaser and will be added to my weekly rotation.  I didn't change anything in the recipe, except reduced the time for sautéing the chicken.  It turned out moist and juicy.

This was so good. Made it for a group of ladies and it went well. Easy to prepare and very glad that it was not breaded. I was skeptical about the combo of sauce but it was wonderful and moist. I did not put much cheese on it.

This is one of the best chicken recipes I've ever made.  Really, really good.  It would be easy to adjust to however many servings you need and would be a great dish for company.  I made it exactly as the directions stated.

My husband loved it. It was easy, I didn't brown the outside because I was more conserned with over cooking it. So I just put all parts strait in the oven. Not a healthy recipe but tasty.

Really tasty and made for super juicy chicken. I used regular bacon that I crumbled (i.o. bacon bits) and 1/2 breasts 1/2 thighs. Just as a bit of an FYI-it is a touch salty; I like salty stuff, so that didn't bug me, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

Just ok... I marinated the chicken breasts in the teriyaki sauce for about three hours. Added the cheese in the last 5 minutes which worked out good except that I did not add the bacon, onion, or parsley until too late so they just slid off the chicken. Might make again. Thanks for the recipe!

Tried this out and added sliced canned mushrooms on top of the ranch. Then followed with bacon bits and the cheese. Used old cheddar for a sharper flavour.

Followed this recipe exactly other than skipped browning of the chicken before putting the breasts in the baking dish.  I did NOT like the fusion mixture of the teriyaki sauce and ranch dressing.

I was in charge of dinner for a hundred so I searched for a recipe and tried this one at home first. I was a little apprehensive when I saw the ranch dressing as an ingredient, but it was delicious and I received several compliments on it. I halved the larger chicken breast halves and brined the chicken in salt water for several hours the day before cooking. I must say I didn't measure anything but just poured (or sprinkled) it on.  I highly recommend this recipe!

when I first seen this recipe I really didn't think it would be good especially mixing teriyaki and ranch together. But after making this dish I gotta say this is one of the best recipes I've made so far the flavors go terrific together. My family really enjoyed this will be making this many more times.

This was very good, but not great.  I had all of the ingredients on hand. I used fresh bacon  to cook, drain and crumble, in place of the pre packaged bacon bits. Based on other reviews, I did not sear the chicken first, I simply blended the ranch and Teryaki basting sauce and dipped the pieces of chicken in the mixture before placing them in the baking dish. There was sauce left over, but I decided not to pour it on top, because too many reviewers said this recipe was very salty and rich. I'm glad I made that decision. Again, based on other reviews I decided to wait until the last 10 minutes to add the  cheese, bacon and scallions. Everyone enjoyed dinner, it just wasn't as wonderful as I expected.

I tried this recipe yesterday and was so surprised at the wonderful flavor!  I have a great Calphon pan that goes from the stovetop to the oven.  I made my own bacon bits(nueske's applewood smoked) and didn't have green onions but chopped an onion and sautéed it with the bacon drippings and chicken.  I had some dried chives for added color.  I always make my own Ranch dressing and teriyaki sauce so the homemade from scratch didn't hurt either.  I added long chinese noodles to the pan the last 10 minutes and covered the pan.  I will make this recipe at a next family gathering.

This was a hit with my husband, and I for my birthday. I made only a few changes to make it a little more healthier. I used Greek ranch dressing instead of regular ranch and real bacon bits instead of the imitation bacon bits,and reduced fat sharp cheddar cheese.So delicious and easy! The ingredients are always in my kitchen. ;)

I was looking for something different to do with chicken this week and made this dish. I made no changes to it and it was good stuff. I had to comment due to it being one of my emailed recipes today. No leftover recipe for sure.

Amazing!!! My whole family LOVED it!!! Only change I made was that I used Trader Joes Shoyu sauce which is a bit sweeter then teriyaki sauce so it was perfect. Not salty at all. Will make this again.

We liked it, but the only suggestion is that the cheese should be the last step. We used real bacon instead of bacon bits, so that probably added more flavor. YUM!

This wasn't bad at all, but it didn't live up to the hype from the other reviews. It's sort of like taking a loaded baked potato and subbing chicken for the potato. A good, solid recipe that's a good change of pace on occasion.

Oh so good!  I was making this for a 35th anniversary dinner serving around 15 people and because of some reviews was worried about the dish being too salty.  Instead of the teriyaki (which did strike me as a little strange) just to be safe, I substituted barbeque sauce.  For everything else, I stuck to the recipe and it turned out awesome!!  I served it with a prepackaged Asian salad kit from the produce section, and I sliced potatoes and used a heart shaped cookie cutter to punch out the potatoes for roasting.  Everything was a smashing success, thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good, but I actually thought it was bland. I thought baking the chicken in the sauce would give it great flavor, but unless if it was drowned in the sauce it just tasted like bland chicken. I must say though, the sauce is delicious! I was skeptical of the teryiaki/ranch combo but it really works. The ranch really mellows the teryiaki and makes it way more creamy. I may try to make this again by marinating for a few hours and maybe throwing it on  the grill as kabobs (minus the bacon and cheese, of course!).

This was fantastic! I was skeptical about not putting any seasoning on the chicken as well as about the combination of teriyaki and ranch, but boy was I wrong! The flavor was out of this world. I prepared exactly as the recipe stated, with the exception of the fact that I sprayed the baking dish with Pam, which made for very easy clean-up. I also started out with full boneless, skinless chicken breasts, so after cooking for a couple of minutes in the skillet, I just sliced each one in half. I don't know if we just got lucky, but our chicken was not the least bit over-cooked or dry, and I even cooked in the skillet for slightly longer than the recipe called for. This recipe will definitely be on our regular dinner rotation!!

It truly was a wonderful dish. It was the hit of the night. I did not pre-brown mine as others stated.Turned out great minus that step, half way through I poured off accumulated juice then put on cheese, bacon (I used Hormel real bacon bits 50 percent less fat) and onions.. I also believe you must use Teriyaki  baste and glaze

This recipe is AMAZING!  I made it once a week when I first found it but now we have it once or twice a month.  It costs around $22-$25 to make and has landed in my monthly rotation of 23 or so dishes my whole family loves.  Also, you can't ruin it.  I've forgotten the ranch, had it all ready and realized I only had white onions, slightly burned it and it always comes out tasting great.

This was just too much extreme tastes together.  It was over the top.  My kids ate it great, but my husband and I both thought it was just oo much.  For people who don't like the taste of chicken this would be perfect for because all the tastes really covers the taste of the chicken.

I used BBQ sauce as I didn't have Teryaki and it was delicious. The ranch, scallions, cheddar, bacon combo may be nice over pomme frites or a baked potato too. I used real bacon.

I have made this the "crockpot" way twice and like it -just throw all the ingredients in and cook in on low 6-8 hours.  BUT IT IS WAY TOO SALTY!!  I absolutely will make this again with reduced salt bacon, low salt teryaki etc.

Assembly and cooking were easy enough. Too salty for my taste. It will probably end up in the dinner rotation, with some alterations. Maybe 3/4c Ranch and 1/4c teriyaki will help with the saltiness. Overall a decent dish.

I was excited to make this after reading about it.  I followed the directions perfectly except I didn't add the cheese or onion until the last 10 minutes.  The chicken came out over-cooked and dry.  The taste overall was bland.  I don't understand how this has received so many stars or positive reviews.

This is a very simple recipe and incredibly good. I have a picky family and everyone loved this. I don't make chicken often because it always seems to come out tough but this chicken was moist and you could cut it with a fork.

Delicious!  We had company for dinner, and this was just perfect.  Everyone raved about this dish, especially the topping.  My kids wanted more of the topping without the chicken.  This came together quickly, and I usually have all of the ingredients in the house, so this will be made again!

I've had this in my recipe box for a very long time, but just got around to trying it.  Unfortunately it was not a hit with my family.  My husband and I thought it was okay, but the kids would not eat it.

I've been making this dish for years!  It is definitely my "go-to" dish every time I have guests over ... especially when grilling-out isn't an option!  It's a hit each & every time ... even with the picky younger crowd!  So happy to have it in my "favorites"!!

Very delicious!  One note my partner suggested is 5 minutes before the dish is done, add more cheese on top of the chicken.  I didn't have green onions so I used regular white onions, about a half cup chopped.  I used ham (lunch meat) instead of bacon bits.  I added salt, pepper, onion spice & garlic spice (to taste).  Also, I added baby potatoes to the dish.  I poked holes in the potatoes with a fork and poured a little teriyaki sauce over the potatoes.  VERY YUMMY!

This had a nice flavor and I will make it again but I had trouble with keeping the topping on the chicken. I think I'll try baking the chicken for half the time and then putting on all the extras for the second half.  Good recipe.

This is my boyfriends FAVORITE dish! I had to finally specify that it was for "anniversary's" only, or I would be making it every night! I've tried a few variations, including chopping the chicken and making a casserole out of it. I also usually use one cheese slice per breast instead of shredded cheese. Also use French's Fried Onions occasionally. As well, I've marinated the chicken in teriyaki and then fried it in the sauce.

I just don't get it. Maybe the Teriyaki sauce I used didn't have the right flavor, but I thought this had a wierd taste, and I love both Teriyaki and Ranch dressing. I thought this recipe couldn't fail with the ingredients, but I disliked it very much. I made it exactly as the recipe stated.

I made this recipe because of the high reviews.  It made the recipe just as recomended, only using fresh bacon instead of bacon bits.  We both thought it was very salty.  The taste (other than salt) was just ok.  This will not be made again.

This was delicious!  At first I thought the ranch dressing & teriyaki might be a strange combination, but it tastes wonderful.  Even my 2 young boys clean their plates when I serve this chicken & my husband loves it as well.

Great! Definately use teriyaki basting sauce because it is much thicker. We left out the green onion because my family doesn't like it. I used real bacon.

This was pretty good and a great starting point for some experimenting.  I didn't pay attention to the amounts of anything and just did everything to taste.  Will try again with a few changes.

I have made this 2 times now and we enjoyed it very much!  The first time, I made it exactly as written (for 60 people!)  The second time I made it, I didn't brown the chicken and I used swiss cheese because I forgot to buy the cheddar.  My 17 year old has asked me to make it once a week!  I will say that you won't need as much of the liquid ingredients as the reciped calls for.  I just brush it on with a basting brush and move on to the next step.  It is absolutely wonderful! Thanks for sharing.

Fabulous dish enjoyed by all ages!! We mixed Teriyaki Sauce with Ranch dressing, onion powder and poured over boneless breasts which I browned in the bacon grease! then we added shredded sharp cheese and real bacon bits. They were moist and tender and the unique taste of the ranch and teriyaki was sooo good!! It's now on our "Fattening Fav's" list! :-)

delicious!!! i loved this recipe, but as a warning to others it is on the salty side, but i prefer that so if you're sensitive to salty tasting foods, this might not be for you or look for low sodium ingredients. that having said, i brushed my chix with the basting sauce, then cooked about 5 strips of bacon and then cooked my chix in the drippings for about 10min. since i already put some of the basting sauce on the chix i only used about 1/8 c. more and mixed it together with about 1/4c ranch and then spooned the combined sauce over the chix and that was plenty for my 4 breasts. i added the remaining toppings and covered with foil and it was done in about 25 min. and also my sister made this recipe but in the crock pot like someone else suggested and she said next time she'll def make in the oven instead it didn't really look that great after being in the crock pot. i will definitely be making this again exactly how i did this time! the toppings make the chix! on bites where the topping had fallen off it was just okay so make sure you don't skimp on them!

This is soooo good.  I prepared half recipe, cut the chicken breasts into several thick slices and marinated them in Kinkkoman's Ponzu Sauce (teryaki with citrus) for about an hour, drained them and patted dry and proceeded with recipe as written.   I did use real bacon pieces and combined the teryaki and ranch dressing as some suggested.  Wonderful!

Like everyone else I thought ranch and teriyaki sauce together would be a bad combo but I tried it anyway because of the good reviews.  This was some of the best chicken I have made and will be making it again soon.  Thanks for sharing.

This was really yummy. I would never have thought to pair teriyaki sauce with ranch dressing, but it was very tasty. I used ranch I made at home. My husband and 21 yo son both loved it.

YUMMY!!  My only change would be the pound the chicken a bit---not quite cutlet flat but just a little flatter than a full sized breast!  Great combo!

I love this chicken. We have it often. The only thing I do differently is I cook up some bacon and crumble that on top - we like that better than bacon bits.

I admit I was scared to make this for dinner, so I made plain teriaki chicken in the oven and added the rest of the ingredients as written on just one of the chicken breast. Well, it turned out pretty darn good! I should have just done all of them, but I didn't want to waist my chicken on this weird flavor combo. I will make this again just as the recipe reads so I can use up the rest of my sauces & real bacon bits. We really liked it so much better than the plain teriaki, but it did smell funny as I was cleaning up the kitchen. Try it!

Excellent.  My husband LOVES it and has eaten the leftovers for the past 3 days.   I added fresh sliced mushrooms as well.  This added a nice touch.  This will go in my top 10 recipes!

I made this recipe the other day because it reminded me of the cheese fries at Outback Steakhouse which I love!  The only thing I did different was that I cooked 4 pieces of bacon instead of using the bacon bits and then, browned the chicken in the bacon grease before cooking in the oven.  It turned out great!

Very good.  I marinated my chicken for @ 4 hours and I think the terriaki flavor was to strong.  It seemed to over power the rest of the flavors.  But other then that, we really enjoyed this dish.  I will make it again.  Thanks.

I made this for my wife one evening and she fell in love with it!  She's shared the recipe with friends who also loved it.  Me, personally, liked it, but it wasn't a favorite.  I'm more of a spicy/peppery kind of person and this taste a *tad* bit bland for me.  But ,overall, it was easy to make and had people wanting more.

What a fantastic recipe. I made only a few adjustments...   I used 5 bacon strips cut into bits.   I used chicken theighs instead of breasts. I browned the chicken in the bacon grease.   I used an Italian blend of cheese.  I do not use orange cheese as it makes my son very hyper.  I will make this meal again but in the slowcooker as suggested by another member.  I made roasted vegetables that went beautifully with this meal.

I made this recipe for my family and my sister's and we have 5 kids between us.  It was a hit!!  Everyone was coming back for seconds!  Definitely a keeper.  I used the Kikomman soy sauce as one reviewer suggested and made the recipe just as is.  Delicious!  Best of all - easy!!

Ok but no where close to 5 star caliber.  Flavor was ok, don't think the teriyaki was worth putting on, could barely taste in finished product

We love this chicken.  I used lower fat ingredients and it still was great.  Served along with garlic mashed potatoes and green veggies.

My hubby and I loved this recipe! It was easy to make and very tasty! At first I thought the combination of teriyaki sauce and ranch sounded kind of weird, but the flavors meshed so well! I will definitely be making this again. For sides, I made mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. I'm thinking of trying it in the crock pot next time. :) I would suggest not being stingy with any of the toppings. Probably more fattening, but delicious. ;)

Throw the frozen chicken tenders, teriyaki sauce, ranch dressing, bacon bits, cheddar cheese and dried minced onion all together in a pan and pop it in the oven covered for 45 min to an hour. :)

This was a really nice meal!  I agree it was on the salty side, so any chance to use low-salt ingredients would be useful.  I was in a hurry for dinner to be ready and pounded the chicken, so I cooked it less  on the stovetop and reduced the cooking time by about five min in the stove, but it would have been better cooked about five minutes less.  Still a very yummy dinner!

I liked how easy this was to prepare, but it wasn't out of this world good.  The toppings were good together, but the parts of the chicken that didn't have sauce/topping on them were a bit bland.  I will definitely make this again, but may try marinating the chicken in the teryaki before I brown it next time.

My husband really liked this but I didn't.  Maybe it was because I marinated the chicken for 24 hrs in the Lawry's 30 min. teryaki marinade and used fat free ranch dressing.  Maybe I'll give it another try and not marinate the chicken so long.

Fantastic!  Made it tonight and it was so yummy!  I was thinking it tasted a lot like the Alice Spings Chicken from Outback sans the honey mustard sauce.  Maybe next time I make it I'll add a little honey mustard and see what happens.

This chicken is so tender and delicious!  I didn't saute the breasts first, just baked them.  I left out the bacon bits because I didn't have any.  Next time I'll probably leave out the green onions (just personal taste, I don't really like them).  This one is definitely a keeper!  I served it with mashed potatoes and broccoli and carrots.

This was such a great recipe, there was nothing left over... The only thing i had to do differnt was use soy sauce instead of teriyaki sauce, It is was still delicious...*update* a friend on mine has a baby and I made them this for dinner one night and though it doesn't look all that great they loved it and were beggin for the recipe.

This was good. I put it in the slow cooker on low as someone suggested, but the cheese and bacon burned. Next time I will follow the directions as written. But it was good!

I thought it was good and very flavorful, but I wasn't in complete awe; then again, I'm a tough critic when it comes to food.  However, my boyfriend loved it and said it was a keeper, and for that, I give it 5 stars.

This turned out really well.  I thought the teriyaki and ranch might be a strange combination, but the flavor was great!

I just made this for dinner. Like everyone else, we were iffy on whether the ingredients would taste good together, but I'm happy to report we all loved it. My picky 4 year old said "I love it!" My 1 year old inhaled it, and my husband thought it was great. I used lowfat ranch because that's what we had, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. We'll be having this one again! Oh, and it was super easy to make.

This chicken is awsome.  I cooked it for the first time for my church dinner and fed 60 people.  Everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.  I was asked to make this a monthly item on the menu.  I did not saute the chicken because of the number I was feeding.  Will try this at home and saute as directed to compare.  Baked covered in a convection oven for about 25 minutes on low fan.  Chicken was moist and the sauce was great over the wild rice.  Definately a keeper.  Thanks Vicki!

Loved this chicken recipe....it had a nice little zing with the ranch dressing and it was so juicy and tender.  My family loved it, with my mom raving loudly how delicious it tasted.  I followed the recipe almost completely except that I used yellow onion in place of the green.  I also used fresh bacon and I added the bacon and cheese half way into the baking.  It came out perfect.  Will definitely make again.

Great dish to share!  I cooked the chicken in an oven proof pan and just made it all on one.  Saved on dishes!  I also used real bacon and just x'ed it over the chicken.  Yummy.

My bf loved it!  He isn't too picky but he loved this one and made me promise to make it for him once a week.  I didn't have any teriyaki sauce so I just mixed 1/3 cup woresterhire, 1/4 cup apple cidar vinegar, and a Tablespoon of Garlic.  It was delicious and reconmend to everyone!

It was moist and easy to make, however, there were too many flavors going on.  It probably would have been much better without the teriyaki sauce.

Great!  I marinated the chicken, then used 3 pieces real bacon, then browned the chicken in bacon grease along with fresh mushrooms.  I added the bacon/cheese/green onions/mushrooms the last 15 minutes of cooking.  Perfect!

My very picky hubby loved this dish. I didn't tell him that it had ranch until after he ate it.  He was quite suprised and impressed.  I took the advice of using the bast and glaze instead of the marinade since I didn't have time to marinade.  Also was not too salty for our taste as some have mentioned.

Okay... so I finally tried this out after seeing it for years on this site!!  I too was initially worried about the terryaki and ranch dressing combo.  I am happy to report.. it works well together.  Changes were.. omitted bacon bits, marinaded the cutlets in terryaki marinade for 1/2 hour.  And finally.. sauted some sliced mushrooms in the pan and placed on top of chicken.  I made extra sauce so that we had plenty for the egg noodles that I served with it.

This was really great!  Honestly I was surprised, but my husband, daughter AND myself enjoyed it (a major feat in our household).  I did not saute the chicken first, just marinated for a short time in teriyaki marinade then brushed on the Ranch dressing.  As suggested earlier I added the cheese about 15 minutes before I thought the chicken would be finished, perfect.

When I saw the number of people who loved this recipe, I had to look at it.  When I saw the ingredients, I thought "Are they crazy?"  Well, we tried it, and we loved it.  As odd as it sounds, the teriyaki and the ranch complement each other and make the chicken absolutely delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

This chicken dish was so good. The only thing that I changed was I breaded the chicken before putting it in the pan to brown.  Everything else I kept the same. It even smelt so good cooking.  I will make this over and over again.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

My boyfriend liked it and wants me to make it again. But I don't care for ranch dressing or bacon on my chicken. I used chicken tenderloins but next time I will be using whole chicken breasts, more cheese on top, and light on the ranch.

Okay. I must say I was a little skeptical when I saw the ingredients to this.  But, I ended up cooking this for some guests - and it was a MAJOR hit.  Delicious and I wouldn't change a thing to the recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe. Positive reviews by husband and kids alike which is a rare moment in this household. I took the advice of another reviewer and marinated the chicken in the teriyaki sauce for approx 2 hours before proceeding with the other steps. Added a lot of obvious flavor to the chicken. We will definitely make this recipe again...thanks!

My husband and daughter went wild over this chicken. I did a large pan of it. added the cheese the last 15 minutes and tried Mozzerella cheese and cheddar. Liked the cheddar, but its just a matter of taste. Its easy to have these things on hand, and it will be a regular, nice enough for company or everyday. a real winner thank you!!

I love this recipe, it’s so good and easy to make.  We have friends with an ill family member and neighbors and friends have been providing dinners for them. Well, they love this recipe so much that they have asked me to make it three times so far for them.  One of them has Celiac disease and is unable to eat wheat, so instead of using the teriyaki sauce I use Hoi sin sauce.  My family loves it too.

This was OK at best. Easy to make, but definitely very salty. I didn't think it lived up to all the rave reviews.

I've been using this recipe regularly for a couple of years! Like others have said - add the cheese and other toppings during the last 10 minutes of cooking. For people not liking too much salt, find low sodium teriyaki for the marinade.

Talk about a man-pleasin' meal!  How can you go wrong with bacon, chicken, cheese, and teriyaki/ranch dressing?   I made this tonight with  Foster Farms chicken breasts, Kroger (Ralphs) teriyaki sauce and lite ranch dressing.  I also fried up some bacon strips and browned my chicken in the bacon grease and it was delicious!  I will definately be making this again!!

The best chicken I have ever had by FAR! I made a few substitutes due to the fact that I was missing a few ingredients. I used 0 Calorie Ranch, Monterey Jack cheese, and no bacon! But I followed the directions and the end result was wonderful. I was afraid the ranch and/or glaze would be over powering but it wasn't! I noticed a few bad reviews on this about it being too salty and/or creamy. I think the key to this recipe is to really know yourself and your taste-buds and make the proper adjustments. I made it a point not to over-do the glaze or ranch. It came out amazing and the whole family LOVED it! I am making this for my birthday dinner next month and am really excited to see peoples reactions!  Also, the "Beautiful Salad" by WENDYINTEXAS compliments this wonderfully!

I have to say, I hope I did something wrong. I was surprised that I didn't think this was amazing based on the ratings. My boyfriend and I ate this 4 hours ago, and I still feel a bit ill. It's way too salty and rich.  Here's what I did: I marinated the chicken for about 20 minutes in the teriyaki, browned it, put ranch on it, baked it for 20 minutes, added the cheese and bacon bits (that were real bacon crumbles), and baked it for 10 more minutes. I didn't have green onions. That would have changed the flavor. I will NOT say that this was horrible. It just wasn't a 5-star meal to me. Maybe because my boyfriend and I have been eating more lightly? I don't know...

Simple and tasty!  I have to say, it sounded a little strange, but with all the great reviews, and little more than chicken, ranch and teriyaki in the fridge, I had to give it a try.  Glad I did-  this was easy to throw together, and my husband and I enjoyed it- the kids thought it was so-so.  I did mix the teriyaki and ranch together, as another reviewer recommended.

Awesome, amazing, delicious--the BEST recipe!  I discovered Anniv. Chicken when my friend, a home ec teacher, prepared this for a school board event for 80 people.  Everyone loved it.  I have changed a few things, such as cooking the bacon strips first, removing them, then sauteeing the chicken breasts in the bacon grease.  I used Costco's Yoshida's marinade.  Enjoy!

I took someones review and decided to try it in the crock pot. I took skinless bonless breast and did eggwash and breadcrumbs and browed them for about 5 mins then put the in the slow cooker with 1c teriyaki and 1/2 c of ranch and left it on low for about 5 hrs. the i put the cheese and bacon on top and baked for about 8 mins...it was HORRIBLE...it was WAY to salty and nobody took more than one bite...if you going to make this do not put it in the slow cooker!!!

i made this tonite with minor changes...i used chicken tenders, didn't saute before i baked it and put foil on while baking, and used teriyaki glaze instead of soy as one reviewer suggested...i baked it for 30 mins and it came out great as far as doneness and tenderness..it was good, but not what i was expecting given the rave reviews from everyone...i would not make this for company...i might make it again, but only if i can't think of anything else to do with the same ingredients...

Way, way too salty!! Glad I tried before making it for company. I know I am in the minority, but even my husband who will eat just about anything thought it had too much sodium.

i have used this recipe plenty of times and its always a hit!! the only thing i changed, is, i add a few drops of teriyaki into the pan when i brown the chicken...its adds just a little more of a kick if your a fan of teriyaki...its a must try recipe

At 3:00pm I thought about dinner and then at 4:00pm I came on this site and found this recipe. I made it with frozen chicken breast and served it with asparagus and rice and at 5:10pm we are done dinner!!! This recipe is quick and excellent and I will definately make again!!!!

This was amazing! I dredged the chicken in flour first then fried. I also made my own teriyaki sauce from this site. Even before I dished it up, my husband said I could make this anytime, and I definitely will!!

My husband likes this, but I'm not such a fan.  I took the suggestions of one of the reviewer whose advice was most helpful and threw everything into a crock pot (saving cheese/bacon towards the end).  I think I'll try making this again, but the way the recipe states - pan fry and oven.  I gather that if 1500 people like this recipe as much as they do, I should give it another shot.

Very tasty. My hubby LOVED it! I used turkey bacon instead and left out the onions. I didn't have any basting sauce... not sure what that is... so I marinated the chicken in stir fry sauce first to try and "up" the flavor.

Very good, can easily be made ahead and cooked later.  I used real bacon strips taht low fat ranch dressing, and I used teriyaki dipping sauce.

Wow!  One of the best chicken recipes on this site!  This dish is a real stunner!  Who would have thought that adding Ranch dressing on top of teriyaki would taste so great on chicken?  But it did!  The combination of crumbled chicken, cheddar and green onions is great!  I served this tasty dish with curried orange chicken, red rice and a stir fry of peppers along with a nice bottle of Chardonnay!  Great combination, great chicken dish!

Good recipe next time I will use Hidden Valley Ranch instead of Kraft. I also used a Teriyaki Marinate because it is what I had but I will use a baste like the recipe asked for. I'm sure with those little changes it will be a five. If it was my boyfriend rating the recipe he would give it a five :)

Pretty darn good for just teriaki sauce and ranch with chicken. I woiuld say to double the ranch and teriaki sauce, cause my chicken was a bit dry with just the sauce that was made with the original recipe.

This was good, not great.  I expected more based on the reviews.  I followed the whole recipe except used real bacon.  Probably will not make again.  Lots of calories for little reward.

Surprisingly enough, I thought this unusual lust of ingredients blended well! My entire family enjoyed it! I did make a small change: I used real bacon, crumbled, instead of bacon bits. Went great with scalloped potatoes and veggies. We will definitely have this again!!

Super easy and enjoyed by my family. I added extra teriyaki sauce to the bottom of the baking dish (because the one I used was thin) and I put the cheese and bacon on top for the last 10 minutes. Served it with white rice. I'll be making this again for sure.

Fabulous!  I was intrigued by the ingredients because seperately they are favorites of our family.  However, I was leary about putting them together in one dish.  Everyone loved it!  Including my picky eater kids.  This will be one of our regular dishes!

I don't normally post ratings; however, this dish was so good that it was worthy of taking the time to share my feedback.  I made it last week for the first time and am going to make it again tonight.  I used only 4 pieces of chicken, but made enough sauce for the 6 servings, so mine may have turned out a bit "saucier" than others, which I actually liked because the extra sauce can be spooned over the chicken and rice (if you make that as a side).

I have made this several times over the last few weeks and it has become a favorite at my house. We try to eat low-fat so I use fat-free cheddar, light ranch dressing & turkey bacon bits. It still tastes YUMMY and makes it healthier! The most important thing is NOT over cooking the chicken or its too dry!

Was really easy to make. I did season the chicken while it cooked in the pan b/c I don't believe in cooking chicken with NO seasoning. We all enjoyed it that night but, was not so good as a left over.

My husband loved this! I was a bit surprised as the ingredients together scared me a bit! As others have mentioned, it looks a little strange too - but THE TASTE is of course the important part! We both loved it & hubby said to put it on the rotation please!

Very Very good!  My 8 year old fell in love!  I seasoned the chicken with a little garlic powder, dehydrated onion and pepper as I browned it in a little of the bacon grease...fried bacon and crumbled it instead of using jarred bacon bits.  Covered with foil and removed foil during last 5 min in oven.  When I took chicken out of oven, topped chicked with 1/3 cup reserved cheddar cheese and it melted beautifully. Served with bow tie pasta tossed in a little butter, salt & pepper and topped pasta with the sauce and served with some steamed broccli.  Extremely easy and sooooo delicious.  WIll definately make again soon!

Surprising combination is right. I also had to make my own teriyaki (the first time) by using soy sauce, sugar, and some corn starch. The next time I went to the store I was sure to grab a bottle of it. The ranch and teriyaki tasted great on this chicken dish, much to my wife's surprise after I told her what I was making for dinner. I've already made this twice, and some friends of mine fell in love with it when I shared the recipe with them. Thanks!

After adjusting amounts for the ingredients because of the fewer number of servings I followed this recipe exactly.  It turned out great.  Even the kids were telling me this is a keeper.

I'm eating the chicken right now, and it turned out really good! Mine looked like it had more sauce than some of the posted pictures, but the extra sauce is good to dip in. I used Moore's Teriyaki Wing sauce, which was thick, and Naturally Fresh ranch dressing. I'll be making this again!

This is definitely a favorite in our house.  My boyfriend loves it!  The sauce is amazing.  I like frying up some pepper bacon opposed to the bacon bits, and I agree to wait until the last 15 minutes to put the cheese on the top.  A must try!

Loved by all, however, I went to put the bottled ranch dressing on chicken and it was rotten smelling so I quickly made up ranch dressing from this site and the flavors were outrageous.  Highly recommend both recipes.

After the first bite my husband looked at me and said "This is the best thing you've ever made!" I did a couple things different...I mariniated the chicken in teriyaki for about an hour. Then I cooked the bacon and used the bacon grease to sautee the chicken. Although I may do this differently next time because the teriyaki burned a little bit. I sprinkled some garlic salt on the chicken before covering it with the ranch. I also waited until the last 10 minutes to add the cheese, bacon, and green onions.   It turned out really good and I will definitely be making this one again.

I read the ingredients in this and thought, "What..?" I was not a believer, but there were so many good reviews, I tried it anyway. And...it rocked. The second time I made it I didn't have any teriyaki and used BBQ sauce instead. It also turned out really good! Crowd pleaser and super easy to do.

AMAZING.  Entire family LOVED it. :)  I used real bacon, cooked and crumbled. I also egg and floured the chicken before pan frying it in olive oil. Lastly, use Use Kikkoman Baste & Glaze...YUM!

I wasn't that impressed. One family member said it was a seven, the kids didn't like it so much so prob won't make again. If i do i think i will use honey mustard instead of ranch.

Hard to review since I changed it!  I was in a hurry and forgot to pre-brown the chicken; instead I placed in a bowl with the ranch and 1T of worcershire instead of the teriyaki sauce, salt, pepper and a dash of cayenne .  Baked for 30 minutes on a baking pan, sprinkled with cheese and a little bacon bits then baked another 5 min... wonderful!..

This is an easy tasty recipe.  I will definitely be making this again.  Added cheese the last 10-15 min of baking.  Used regular bacon instead of bacon bits. Excellent.

My boyfriend loved this dish! I used white cheddar, marinated the chicken in teriyaki marinade for about an hour then coated it in bread crumbs before frying it. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and peas. Definitely will make again and definitely will try in the crock pot!

I am in love with this chicken.  I have made it several times and everyone I've served it too has really enjoyed it.  At first I thought the teriyaki/ranch combo was strange but it had so many good reviews I had to try it, and they were right! I do use real bacon instead of bacon bits and I probably add more cheese since that's one of my favorite things.

I hate when reviewers give 5 stars, but change the whole recipe. I followed all the directions and this came out fantastic! We had my parents over and they raved about it. It took me a while, but I found one bottle of teriyaki baste in the Asian isle of my market. I served with mashed potatoes and seasoned broccoli. Thanks!

Oh, this is goooood.  At first, I thought it was odd to use teriyaki sauce but it turned out to be a perfect accompaniment.

This has become a staple at our house.  My husband is very picky.  He likes to eat like a 6 yr old (macaroni n cheese and hot dogs).  So it's hard to find meals that he and I both enjoy so much.  It also works great for a crowd.  It works great if your helping someone out with meals as well. Best of all it is so simple I can now make it off the top of my head.

I liked this dish but thought it needed a few changes. Definitely make sure you use a thicker sauce or you wont have much flavor to your chicken. I used homemade ranch, much better then store bought. Also used a couple strips of real bacon instead of bacon bits. next time I think I will wrap the bacon around the chicken since that was my favorite part.

I was really skeptical about mixing the teriyaki sauce with the ranch sauce but once again, Allrecipes did not fail me! Based on the reviews, I just had to try this recipe and it was DELICIOUS! I didn't fry the chicken first, just threw it in the over. The chicken was moist and VERY savory! I don't recommend adding any additional salt or seasonings because the mixture of sauces along with the bacon (I used bacos real bacon bits) made it pretty salty.  I also think that mixing the ranch and the teriyaki was a good idea. All in all, a fabulous recipe. I'll be making again very soon! Perfect for company - something a little different to serve. The only thing I think I'd change is the name. :-) I think I'll dub this, "loaded baked potato chicken".

This is how I made it: Mix the teriyaki and ranch, add chicken and marinate for a few hours.  Meanwhile, cook bacon strips.  Take chicken from marinade and grill over charcoal.  When just done, top each piece with two strips of bacon and slice of cheese. We all liked this recipe, and it is fast and has a very "restaurant" feel to it.  But even with marinating there wasn't a LOT of flavor, and I imagine the grilling added to it rather than subtracted. I hope I remember to make it again. :-)

I thought this turned out really well. ((My husband and oldest daughter didn't care too much for it though.)) I marinated the chicken in the teriyaki while I fried some real bacon. Using a bit of the grease I lightly browned the chicken. Added to the dish and topped with the ranch and green onions. They baked for about 20 minutes and then I added a bunch of cheese and the crumbled bacon. I baked it another 15 minutes and they were ready. I thought the flavors were great and the chicken was very juicy. But the other two said is was just OK. Well, I am the cook and I will make it again!!

I did like this recipe, but it wasn't the ground-breaking meal that I was expecting based on reviews. That said, this was a VERY easy recipe and definitely good enough to whip up on a weeknight with ingredients I generally have on hand. I really liked that I didn't have to marinate the meat because I rarely plan that far ahead. I took someone else's suggested to season and dredge the chicken before sauteeing. But with the salty teriyaki sauce, I wish I wouldn't have salted the chicken beforehand. Next time, I think I'll be a little more generous with the ranch and cheese.

My husband often referrs to it as "loaded chicken" because the topping is similar to a loaded baked potato.  Like other reviews suggest I mix the ranch and teryaki together before putting it on the chicken and add the cheese the last 5 minutes of the cooking time.

I actually wrapped the chicken and some sliced polenta in raw baccon and put it in the 9x13 dish.  Next time I would put the chicken on a grate in the dish so the baccon grease would drip off as it baked and leave the cheese, ranch off so it didn't just run to the bottom of the pan and mix with the baccon grease.

I found this to be very salty. I'm not sure if it was the teriyaki sauce in addition to the bacon bits. Overall it was very good. We won't be having it again unless I alter the recipe. I had an allergic reaction to the teriyaki sauce.

This is excellent, but very rich.  My husband absolutely loved it.  I absolutley loved most of it - what I mean is that it is really rich and to me (not to my husband) it was just too much by the end of the chicken breast.  But, if I don't eat the whole thing, it's perfect.  Great flavor, just rich  :)

My family absolutely loves this recipe! It's requested all the time, and the only thing I do differently is cook and crumble fresh bacon on top. I have used both red and green onions, and find both to be delicious, but I try to use green when I can. Also, never really felt the need for parsley, so I just skip it....Oh, and I never bother to brown the chicken first. It comes out tender and juicy every time.. just up the cooking time to 40 minutes or so

I was really disappointed with the taste of the sauce. I wound up having to buy a store-brand teriyaki sauce with pinapple, so I wonder if that's what the problem was. I first marinated the chicken in the teriyaki sauce and after pan frying the chicken, I had mixed the teriyaki sauce and ranch dressing before spooning it on the chicken. I then put the cheddar cheese, spring onions and cheese on about 10 minutes before the meal was done. I served it with Texas toast and corn. The chicken was very moist but the Texas toast and corn was the best part. I'm rating it as a 3 for how easy it was. Sorry!  I'm updating this about 12 hours later... I must have been sick or something last night. No doubt! I just warmed up the left overs... wow!!! I like this a LOT more than I did last night. Myself, though, I would prefer something a little extra... possibly more salt or more tanginess, but again it could be because of the teriyaki sauce I had used. I'm really enjoying my dinner tonight!

My family (two toddlers included) loved this dish and ate it up.  I only had one problem with it and that was that it was a little too salty, I even cut the teriyaki almost in half.  I will add even less next time I make it.  Trust me---there WILL be a next time! :)

I added some baby portabella mushrooms to this chicken, but followed everything else exactly. It was great! It would be easy to do for a crowd.

To reduce the fat, I just baked the glazed chicken tenders (with ranch on top) in the oven for 35 minutes.  Put the shredded cheddar, green onions and bacon in at the last 10 minutes.  Turned out perfect!

I marinated the chicken in the teriyaki marinade before cooking. I omitted the onions because my family doesn't care for them. I felt the bacon bits made it a little salty but my husband LOVED it.

I feel bad only giving this 4 stars since I did not even have the correct ingredients - I didn't have teriyaki basting sauce, so I'm sure this would have been great if I would have.  I used soy mixed with pineapple juice and it didn't stick to the chicken enough.  If it would have, I think it would have made a better base flavor to help balance the strong taste of the ranch dressing.

This was very good.  I used real bacon and browned the chicken breasts in a few Tbsp of the grease.  I also added the bacon, cheese and onion about 10 mins before pulling it out of the oven.  My son loved it and my husband liked it, but he doesn't really like chicken, so I count that as a good rating.

I really like this chicken recipe because I didn't have to take a trip to the grocery store or marinate it. My chicken was thawed and I had nothing planned and my stomach was starting to growl...I'd say about 45-60 mins later I was sitting down at the dinner table enjoying this with my family...I'd give it five stars but the husband only gives it four. My 4 yr old cleaned his plate and the 2yr old ate it all but the cheesy bacon.

Delicious but I too had a problem with it being too salty - even my salt addicted husband agreed.  Luckily I tasted the sauce before baking and modified it by adding water, sugar, and more ranch.  The problem was the teriyaki sauce I bought at the store not the recipe itself.    In short, buy a THICK LOW SODIUM teriyaki sauce or make your own teriyaki sauce (what I usually do & should have done) and it will turn out perfect :)  Oh, and add the cheese and real bacon crumbles at the end so they don't burn :)

The fam loved it!  Even the grandkids ate it up!  I will look for low sodium teriyaki sauce...just a bit too salty for me (and I like salt!) I think this is the recipe I will use at the next work cook-off...maybe cut chicken into bite sizes before cooking and serve over rice.  :  )  THANKS for the recipe!

This was pretty good, but I found it a bit too salty. I might use a different Brand of Teriyaki Sauce next Time. I was wondering how this would be with BBQ Sauce instead of Teriyaki and Blue Cheese Dressing instead of the Ranch?

I thought this chicken was pretty good. I really couldn't taste the ranch or the teryaki glaze, but together they gave the chicken a good flavor.  I used precooked microwave bacon because I already had it.  It is easy to make.  When you get tired of preparing the same few chicken recipes over and over, give this a try.

When I found this recipe, I was looking for a cheesy chicken. When I first read the recipe I wasn't sure about the teriyaki and ranch mix. After reading some reviews and not finding many problems with the recipe I gave it a shot. I also used real bacon instead of bacon bits.  It was amazing. I'll be adding this recipe to my regular meal rotation. Can't wait to make it for guests.   WOW! WOW! WOW!

I tried this in the crock pot. Very tasty and tender. Did not like the bacon bits - smelled and tasted too fake. Added fresh carrots- next time would add more veggies (green peppers, string beans). Ate over rice.

This was very yummy and easy to prepare. The only thing I did differently was use Turkey bacon. Less calories and alot less fat that way! Will make again.

This was the best chicken dish I've ever eaten. My three son's even had seconds and they are 9,7 and 4. They couldn't get enough. You must try it.

Huge hit!  Everyone loved this dish - including my picky 13 year old.  I would highly recommend cooking real bacon to crumble over the top rather than using bacon bits.  I used Ken's Teriyaki and it was just the right amount.  Oddly, no one could tell there was teriyaki or ranch dressing on the chicken - which I think was a good thing!  The flavors combined to give this dish a unique and delicious taste.  One thing I might do differently next time is wait to put the cheese on since I had the same issue as other reviewers with the melting cheese sliding off the chicken.

I made this for company this weekend.  It was very good.  I used an all-purpose teriyaki marinade and cooking sauce.  I used light ranch dressing and put the cheese and bacon and green onions on about halfway through the cooking time.  It was very good.

This was a fabulous recipe.  Next time, I would just pound the chicken first to lessen the cooking time.  It was delicious and very easy!  A must-make-again dish!

This was very good.  I thought that it was a bit salty, so I think that I would use a low salt teriyaki sauce next time.  However, my boyfriend really liked it just as it is.

This one got mixed reviews in my house.  9 year old hated it; 11 year old liked it somewhat; husband liked it; me, I found it insanely salty.  I followed the recipe exactly except taking others suggestion and didn't put the cheese on until the last 15 minutes.  Sorry, I'm just not getting all the rave reviews on this on and I doubt I will make it again.

Delicious!  I pounded out the chicken a little bit, just to even out.  I marinated a few hours in the teriyaki and still poured teriyaki on top, but probably would skip that step next time because most just rolled off into the dish.  Added cheese and bacon and scallions in the last 10 min or so.  Cooked until it was 160 degrees---Husband, 3 1/2 and 1 1/2 year old all loved it!

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and made sure to use a Teriyaki glaze, which was a good call since it was thicker. I think even a barbecue sauce would work well here. I forgot to brown the chicken and just put it in a 9 X 13 pan and then poured the Teriyaki sauce on top and rubbed it in. I cooked it for 15 mins at 350, then I flipped the breasts, drained a bit of the juice, poured on some Ranch dressing and the bacon bits and cooked it another 15 mins. Then I turned the oven off and sprinkled some shredded cheddar cheese all over it and kept it in the oven til the cheese had melted. I was very good! I think I would prefer it with real bacon next time and maybe some sliced mushrooms under the cheese. Then it will taste a lot like a chicken dish that I get at Outback Steakhouse. Thanks!

I thought this was pretty easy and turned out pretty well.  I think it would taste great with a sweet BBQ sauce instead of the teriyaki as well; would cut down on the salty flavor.  Still a good recipe though.

My family ate this up so fast!! They even mentioned that this was the best recipe I've gotten off this website! I've been trying recipes from allrecipes.com for about 9 months so I think that should tell you how awesome it is!  I used a 3 thighs to finish up some frozen meat I had left and 3 breasts. Defrosted and I lightly browned the chicken using my Foreman grill. I used Yoshida original gourmet marinade drizzled on the bottom of the baking dish and then spooned over the top then hidden valley ranch and bacon bits from costco.  AWESOME!!

This was really good, however, next time I will fry some bacon and use that instead of using the real bacon bits.  This deserves the real fresh cooked stuff.  The bacon bit flavor detracted from the quality of this dish.  Just my humble opinion....

I made this dish for a family of 9 and it was a success!  I also mixed the ranch and teriyaki sauces before topping the chicken and used aluminum foil over top for the first half of the cooking process. I actually had a room of picky eaters fighting over the leftovers!

It was quite salty and I love salt. I think next time I am going to try it with Caesar dressing instead of the ranch and use a different teriyaki sauce so the salt will be cut back.

This was good. I didn't have green onions, so I chopped half of a small onion, and didn't have parsley, so I just sprinkled some sesame seeds on it. It really didn't need the sesame seeds. I also used a low fat cheese. It was tasty.

OMG.  Great recipe.  I butterflied my chicken and pan cooked them in olive oil about 85% of the way.  Then I followed the recipe and placed them in the oven.  The chicken was still very flavorful and juicy when it came out of the oven.  I cooked the chicken first because, I didn't feel confident that the chicken would cook all the way in the oven and I'd end up serving it before it was done.  Overall amazing taste.  My husband and nephew were both dissapointed there wasn't any extra!!

This was good but a little too salty for my taste-and I used less teriyaki than the recipe called for. My kids like it and they don't eat much meat.

I don't know what the big deal about this recipe is. I followed it exactly only adding a bit of fresh lemon juice and lots of garlic and let it cook on low for several hours. It turned out nice and succulent but certainly not the best chicken recipe I've ever tried which is what the reviews would have you believe. I will be trying it again but have way better recipes for special occasions. And no it is not too salty. I guess it depends on what brand of teriyaki sauce you are using.

Only difference is to marinate the chicken in the terriyaki sauce for a few hours before cooking in pan.
Top with cheese and bacon about 15 minutes before done.
Awsome!

Delicious!  My husband and daughter couldn't stop talking about how good this turned out!  After reading another review I decided to place a thin layer of terriyaki in the bottom of the baking pan as well as brushed over the chicken; this made the terriyaki taste a little overwhelming.  Next time I make this I will only brush it over the chicken.  That is the only thing I did different; will definitely be making this again!  Thanks!

This was excellent. I did not have Ranch dressing so I used blue cheese dressing instead. This will become a staple on our meal rotation.

This was a surprisingly good recipe.  I have to admit I was a little leary of the combination of teriyaki and ranch, but it cooked together great!  The only change I made was to fry in olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I added some seasonings to the chicken while frying.  This is a good one, that I'll try again!

Excellent!  We butterflied the chicken, pounded it, coated it with egg and then seasoned with Italian breadcrumbs it before browning.  This yielded quite a bit of chicken.  We then ended up with two layers in the 9x13 pan.  Each layer had the teriyaki basting sauce, the ranch dressing (used fat free) and the cheese.  We added the bacon bits and the green onion on top and then covered the pan with aluminum foil.  Since we had butterflied the chicken and then pounded it, the oven cooking time was 15 minutes.  The chicken was nice and tender.  The presentation was great!  The only drawback were the onions.  They were a bit too strong.

This was an easy recipe to make.  It was a hit with the hubby but I could have done without.  I used chopped bacon bits in a bag that I buy at Sam's club.  I will make it again if requested.  I did not have green onions so used chopped white onion and fresh cut chives.  It was ok.

This recipe was awesome. I actually ended up with 12 servings (By dividing breasts in half) and when there was only 15 minutes left added a can of sliced potatoes which cooked into the left over sauce.  It was great.

My boyfriend and I made this dish for his parents for Christmas dinner.  Very yummy!  I was surprised, as I did not think the flavors would go well together.  Alas it was lovely and met rave reviews!  The only thing we did differently is to use real bacon instead of bits, and when flash frying the chicken, instead of oil we just cooked them up in bacon grease.  YUM!

My husband loved it ! So easy to make and it was delicious. The only thing I would highly recommend is to not season it. I have a habit of seasoning meats with adobo and it was a bit salty. It still was delicious though !

This was delicious. For three portions I used 2T of low fat ranch dressing, 2T of teriyaki sauce, 3 slices of turkey bacon and 1 1/2 ounces of a soy mexican cheese blend. It was plenty of yummy topping.

This is a good, classic recipe!  My hubby loved it and so did the kids!  So when that happens it's a major plus!  I don't think I changed a thing, it was just really good!

This was REALLY good!  I made it b/c of all the good reviews, but was definitely skeptical.  I did make my own bacon bits.  Also, I used shallots instead of green onions, b/c I had them on hand.  I marinated the chicken before hand in the teriyaki, so it was very juicy.  The dish is salty, but I didn't might.  Those who don't like salty food might want to make something else, or find low sodium dressings to go in it.  ENJOY!

Fixed this last night for my husband and myself.  It was fantastic. Don't know why it seems so weird to cook chicken with ranch dressing, but it turned out great.  I put hot sauce on my husband's, instead of the teriaki sauce.

Despite the unusual combination of ingredients, I decided to try this since the reviews were generally great.  I follwed the recipe exactly as directed but honestly, this dish was just ok.  I liked the first two bites but got sick of the taste very quickly, probably because the flavors were so strong and salty?  The nice thing was that this dish was very quick to make and my family ate most of it.  I probably won't be making this again though.

This recipe was good but I thought the dressing and everything would make like more of a sauce on top of the chicken.

i didnt find my chicken to be salty at all, but made sure to always add pepper. heres what i did:

i cooked my own bacon which i added some peppercorns to, 2 cloves minced garlic in some evoo. while that was cooking, i cut slits in the chicken and added a teriyaki marinade for about 15 minutes. i then cooked the chicken in the bacon grease until done on both sides and place in my baking dish. i added some fresh ground pepper on top, and then just drizzled the chicken with ranch. i didnt follow any of the marinade measurements. i added the cheese and bacon the last 10 minutes and fresh parsley on top when it came out of the oven. i served with broccoli, garlic mashed potatoes and hawaiian sweet rolls. im not sure i would make this dish for children, i dont think they would like the tanginess of the flavors mixed.

Very good!  I left out the onions and parsley.  I also added the cheese and bacon the last 5 mins. of baking.  This chicken came out very moist and flavorful.  Hubby loved it!

Four stars....it is a little salty, but still very good.  Great meal to bring to others, just don't put the cheese and bacon on until the last 10 minutes!!!!

This was quite tasty.  Also, there is something kind of addicting about the flavor of ranch and teriyaki.  Yes, it is very salty, so to those who are salt intolerant, this is not for you.  I will probably experiment with different sauces until I find one to my liking.  I used Soy Vey teriyaki and homemade ranch(from the dry pkg).  I think barbecue and ranch would be awesome together.  I might try that next.  Two things I did that made everything easier was go ahead and mix both sauces together and pour over browned chicken and I premixed my shredded cheese, chopped green onions, and bacon pieces in a ziploc baggie and 25 minutes into the cooking time, topped chicken with it and cooked for 10 more minutes.  All in all, we all thought it was pretty tasty.

I have made this many times over the past few year, with rave reviews.  This time, I used chicken tenders instead of breasts.  My husband loved it better.

Very, Very good!  You can play with the cheese if you want (use a bit of Feta), add more bacon or more onion depending on your preferences.  We loved this.  The breasts turned out really juicy.

WOW! So good, and JUICY!!! I am not a fan of ranch so I used butter instead on my piece. I could taste it in every bite and it made it so juicy. I did put ranch on my husbands piece which was in the same dish and my piece did not get any of the ranch flavoring.

This was okay.  My boyfriend loved it, but I wasn't too thrilled with it.  I think it might have been the teriyaki sauce that I used.  I will try this again with another type of teriyaki sauce.

I don't know who in the world thought that mixing teriyaki and ranch was a good idea, but WOW!  Quite yummy!  I forgot to buy green onions but otherwise followed the recipe.  Being lazy I used the ready-cooked bacon on top (last 10 minutes w/cheese) and I think that made it a dot saltier than I'd like.  All in all the kids loved it so it's an A+ in my book!  Will definitely add to the rotation.  I'm so glad I tried it.  :-)

Good recipe, and easy.  It's perfect for small or large groups.  I served it with the "ultra creamy mashed potato" recipe from this website.

This was a great recipe.  My husband loved it.  It was a tad salty but that was probably the choice of sauce and ranch dressing I used.  I also used real bacon pieces instead of bacon bits.  I tried using the pre-cooked bacon since I hate to cook bacon and I was very pleased with its taste so I recommend that verses bacon bits.  Like others suggested I added the cheese the last 10 min. Will definitely make again.  Thanks!  Update:  I cook the chicken in the oven in the same skillet I brown it in and I also added thin sliced potatoes around the edges lightly oiled and it turned out great!  Just add a side veggie and your done.

My husband and I liked this chicken (funny how it looks just like a twiced baked potato!) but I wasn't too crazy about the teriyaki sauce.  Next time I'll substitute it for regular barbeque sauce instead.  Also, I used real bacon instead of Bacon Bits.

Wow! This was great. I was looking for something with an Asian taste....when I saw the teriyaki I thought this might be it. However, with the ranch dressing it wasn't asian tasting at all....but I didn't mind! This was delicious. I didn't have any cheddar cheese so I used mozzerella. It was still great! Thanks for the recipe!

I normally don't review the recipes, but i felt like it needed to be said. I'm not sure how this got such great reviews. IT WAS WAY TOO SALTY. My husband and I couldn't really enjoy the meal. All I could taste was pure salt.

I made this for my husband tonight. He finished off almost the entire chicken breast before I got the chance to ask him how he liked it. It was a hit and we both had seconds!

This recipe turned out really well. As mentioned by another reviewer, I gave the chicken an egg wash and flour breading before browning it in the skillet. This added a nice crispy texture to the finished dish. And instead of basting the chicken with the teriyaki, I mixed it with the ranch dressing and spooned it on.  As for the cheese mixture, I omitted the onion (picky husband) and waited until the final 10 minutes to add the topping.  It was bubbly, crispy, gooey, and perfect! I even made a little pan gravy with the drippings from the casserole dish. I will surely make this again!

This is fantastic! I've made this chicken three times and my son continues to ask for it. We love the melded flavors of teriyaki and ranch. Thanks for a quick, easy and flavorful recipe.

this was just ok.  I wanted to love it for ease of prep. but it wasn't our favorite.  And, even though I used all low sodium products it was still a little salty.

Wow was this recipe a pleasant surprise!  I was a little skeptical but I had all the ingredients and there was no marinating, no basting, nothing that took a lot of time.  Let's just say it was a huge hit.  My Boyfriend immediatly asked when we would have it again.  The only difference I made was that I used reall bacon crumbles.  It may have added a little grease, as mine didn't come out as pretty and neat as the other pictures.  Mine was quite runny but I just scooped up the goo and put it on top of each breast and it was wonderful!  I would recommend this to ANYONE!

I imagine it's even better with real bacon and actual teriyaki sauce, but it was even delicious with make-shift teriyaki and imitation bacon bits!

Very tasty!  A nice way to spice up chicken.  Like others, I fried up my own bacon and cut it into pieces instead of using store-bought bacon bits.  I liked this better (gave it a bit more flavor) because I like my bacon bits a bit larger.

5 for easy prep, 5 for presentation, but 4 for flavor.  There was nothing special about this chicken, but there was also nothing bad about it either.  I still give it a 5 because the kids loved it, hubby and I thought it was just OK.  It would be perfect for large gatherings, but not my first pick for a family dinner - unless I'm very short on time or energy.

I loved trying this recipe, my family enjoyed it very much. However, I substituted the teriyaki with worchestershire sauce and I used caesar dressing rather than ranch, it came out very yummy. Also I fried my own bacon and waited until the last 10 minutes of cooking to top with cheese.

Made this just as directed. It's pretty good. I feel kind of strange since I don't think it's as good as other reviewers think. They look really pretty though. Spooning all that ranch onto the chicken during preparation makes me a little nervous though. ^^;

I love this recipe! I am so glad to have something new for my family dinners and the only thing extra I will ever need to buy is the bacon bits and green onions because I always have all the other  ingredients at all times.  The ingredients blended together so well to make a delicious tasting sauce and I am glad I used a thick teriyaki sauce so that I could taste it.  I noticed some people said they would add more next time because they could not taste it.  Everone in my 5 person household loved it.   I think I will make this for a dinner party soon.  I can't wait to share it with everyone.

I thought this chicken was great. I didn't have any teriyaki sauce so I just brushed on some soy sauce. I also used real bacon instead of bacon bits. I will make it again.

My family loved this, even my picky eater! I did it a little bit differently and it still came out great. I put the raw chicken in the crock pot, added the ranch dressing and then used chipotle sauce instead of teriyaki. I cooked bacon and added that, too. I didn't add any cheese in the crock pot. I just let my kids add it if they wanted it. Delish! Drew rave reviews from all who ate it, and I will definitely make it again.

I thought this was good ,but not as good as what some others have said. 
May have needed to use more Teryaki, did put some on the side as a dip.
Will make it again.

The flavors of this were actually really good. I don't think I measured the teryaki and I probably should have used a little more but overall it was really good. I also made my own bacon (I like it really crispy) and used whole pieces instead of bits. My husband liked it a lot.

I skipped out on the green onions & parsley, but that's personal preference. I also used real bacon leftover from another recipe. I was a bit scared to try the ranch dressing & teriyaki sauce combination, but it turned out to be delicious!

Delicious!  Pounded chicken breast down and used a bit more basting sauce.  The flavor was a hit and the hubby/kids enjoyed it equally!  Will become a staple in our house!

I really enjoyed this recipe and my husband loved it.  i gave it a 4 not 5 because the flavors did not all come out as well as i was expecting.  I used real bacon fried until crispy and homemade "ranch style" dressing.  I will definitely make this again though it was good.

I struggled with giving this a 3 or 4.  I had high hopes for this recipe w/such a high rating by so many.. however no one was that happy w/this recipe. We eat a LOT of chicken here, and this, neither of my daughters would eat. No one even really cared for the ranch on the chicken, so, if I ever make this again, it will be with bbq sauce rather than ranch and I will use less oil to 'brown' the chicken. The toppings were great. YUM.

Delicious and easy to make.  I took the recommendations of others and mixed the ranch dressing and teriaki together.  I also put the cheese, fresh bacon bits and scallions on for only the last 10 minutes.  Will make again!

This came out VERY salty.  Before I made it, the combination of ranch and teriyaki sauce sounded a little overpowering, but I went ahead and tried it with teriyaki basting sauce (as directed) that included pineapple and honey to tone down the salt.  The result?  Super salty chicken. My husband thought it was okay, and I don't mind a little bit of salt, but this was too much.  Sorry!

Easy recipe. The only thing I did different was make my own bacon bits. I served with fried potatoes and corn. My kids loved it, I didn't get any because of my diet. Because my husband said it was just okay, I have to give it 4 stars.

Made the teriyaki sauce and ranch dressing from scratch, so I'm all proud of myself, lol. Got rave reviews. I had to use pork steaks (my mom doesn't eat chicken) but it tasted really good, surely as good as with chicken. Marinated the meat the day before (garlic, black pepper, olive oil) and didn't brown it before baking it. Didn't add the bacon bits and cheese, but tossed some mushrooms along with the ranch dressing. Thanx ;)

I life it, but bo thought the chicken was dry.  I made it in the crockpot as someone else suggesed, so not quite sure dry is what he ment.  Did not add bacon as diet restrictiona son't allow it.  Cut back on terriaki saucce as I only had 1/3 C, and matched it with Ranch dreswswing.  I thought it was good, but I like anything that reqauires little time in the kitchen.

Served this with corn and mash. My husband loved this and he is usually very picky. Was a little salty but probably my fault since I seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt. The scallions really made it yummy! Added the cheese on in the last 10 minutes so it wouldn't burn. Will use low fat Ranch and low sodium Teryaki next time.

Very good- I go a little lighter on the teriyaki than reccommended and a little heavier on the ranch.  I've served it to two different sets of houseguests and it was a big hit both times!

It seems I'm going against the grain on this one, but I followed this recipe true to form and simply was not impressed...at all. The combination of teriyaki sauce and the ranch dressing sounded very strange to me...yet enticing. Based on the reviews here I figured I couldn't go wrong, since I put a lot of trust in the rating system and haven't had a miss (yet). Unfortunately that combination just wasn't a hit when I made this for my wife and myself the other night. I wouldn't make this again nor could I recommend it...sorry!

I loved the chicken with cheese and bacon.  There was absolutely no flavor from the teryaki sauce or ranch though.  It must have slid off the chicken when cooking.

Made this for dinner. Husband says "it's not the best thing I've ever had, but it's good." Can't say that there was anything spectacular about this recipe. Maybe my chicken breasts were too thick?

I made this recipe tonight and my husband and I loved it. My kids didn't complain either which is a complement. I sent my husband out for the teriyaki basting sauce and he came home with teriyaki barbeque sauce. I went ahead and used it anyway and it was still excellent. Thanks for the great recipe.

We loved this recipe! I mixed the teriyaki and ranch(fat-free) together and marinated the chicken in this overnight. Didn't change anything and came out great!

Yummy!  5 Stars for easy to make, quick to the table (I don't think it took a whole hour like the directions say), and delicious - even for my picky kids! YUM! To make it easy: I used Oscar Meyer Real Bacon Bits - the ones like beef jerky in the condiment aisle, and I didn't have teriyaki sauce, so I simmered 1 c. soy sauce with 3/4 c. water and 3/4 c. sugar with a clove of chopped garlic & 3 green onions chopped, it tasted just like the jarred versions of teriyaki sauce. I added the cheese on the last 5 minutes. Delish!!! Thank you, Wanda, for the wonderful chicken recipe!!!

I made this for the second time tonight. Love this recipe!!! The only changes I made was I used real bacon and before placing the chicken in the oven I sliced them and put both the sauce and ranch dressing inside. The firs time we felt like all the flavor was just resting on the top. The change made all the difference.

I didn't think my husband would like this but he absolutely loved it, I did actually make it for our two year wedding anniversary. It was a big hit. I followed the directions and it came out perfect, I will definitly be making this often. It's also a great reciped to tweek and use different marinades like we've already have. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was okay. I did marinate the chicken overnight in the teriyaki sauce and didn't add the cheese and bacon bits until the last 10 minutes of baking. I think this is a recipe that can easily be tweaked to your own taste preferences. Thanks for another way to make chicken.

My honey and my kiddos (who are very picky) loved it.I cooked it in the crockpot initially and topped the chicken with the ranch and teriyaki sauce mixed together for about 5 hours on low. Then I took it out,put in  baking dish, topped it with the cheese,bacon, and onions and put it in the oven for about 10 minutes. Very Yummy!! Served with loaded mached potatoes and carrots.

Soooooo easy, good, and quick.  Used about 1/2 of the teriyaki basting sauce, but all the ranch.  Like others, also added the cheese and bacon during the last 10 minutes.

WOW!! This was really easy, and the taste was amazing.  I, too, was kind of suspicious about the ingredients, but they blended together very well.  I sauteed the chicken with the teriyaki sauce before I baked it.  I didn't even have bacon bits, and it was great.  I'll definitely make it again.

I really enjoyed this meal, a lot. I was super skeptical at first because of the combination of ingredients but I figured with that many high reviews it was worth a try. I loved it but my family found it way too salty, so if I make it again I'll have to figure out how to reduce the sodium.  I used real bacon which is so worth it. Definitely worth trying out though.

I would give this only 2 stars, but my husband liked it so it gets 3. I just did not care for it too much. Probably won't make it again...

I made this chicken recipe for DH and his father. They both loved it, and I did too!  I marinated the breasts overnight in teriyaki sauce, and substituted low fat Ranch. Those were the only changes.  I thought it was a tiny bit salty, so next time I will buy the lower sodium teriyaki sauce.  It was delicious! Thanks for the great recipe!!

My husband & I both thought this was average. I followed the recipe except I didn't have any green onions & added the cheese & bacon later as other reviewers suggested. I was disappointed after all the great reviews it got. Not bad, but not great.

Excellent! I did put pepper on the chicken before browning. I also added some teriyaki to the bottom of the baking pan, blended the teriyaki and salad dressing together before spooning onto the chicken and waited until the last 10 minutes to add the cheese, and bacon bits.

We loved this recipe! It was very easy, but when served, looked like you spent a lot of energy on it. Delicious! Served with a salad and alfredo pasta. I might make more of the sauce next time and serve over rice. Downside, some people may find this recipe too salty.

DElicious! This is REAlly great, mama! MMMmmm, very good!  These were some of the comments I received when I served this chicken. I actually cut up the breast into large chunks (for faster cooking) and I forgot to add the cheese and bacon at the end (I added it right away so there was a little crusty effect, my fault).  Still, everyone loved it! This was a very easy recipe.  I took some other reviewers' advice and added some sauce to the bottom and mixed the dressing with sauce and poured. Great recipe!

Try marinating the chicken overnight in the ranch dressing, then proceed. Tastes extra special.

WOW!!!  My whole family LOVED this recipe.  I took some of the reviewers advice and added extra Teriaki to the bottom of the dish.  And I made REAL bacon bits (which is always a must for my family). Will definitely make again soon.

This recipe is delicious and so easy to prepare. I made it last night for my parent's dinner party. It was a huge hit and I had to fight my mother for leftovers today. Everyone wanted the recipe and I was asked to make it again for a Christmas party. Thanks to the submitter.

Super easy. My husband and daughter gave it 5+ stars, my son gave it 4 stars and I  gave it 3.5 stars. I used real bacon (one piece of bacon per piece of chicken) and added the chopped bacon and cheese the last 10 minutes of the baking time. Thank you, Vicki, for posting the recipe! My family loved this dish and gobbled it up, so I will be making this again for sure...

This is pretty good right after it is cooked; however, it is not that great re-warmed. I would not make this recipe often, but it's not bad for once in a while.

I was very disappointed with the results after reading the glowing reviews.  I follow the directions exactly and found the chicken rather blah.  Maybe if I had marinated the chicken in the teriyaki sauce it would have had more flavor.  My husband liked it but he likes anything with bacon.

This was a big hit with my 3 very picky eaters.  I did not use bacon bits but fried up my own bacon and crumbled on top of the chicken.  Like a previous reviewer I also added teriyaki to the bottom of the baking dish.  We will add this to our menu list for sure.

I have to say, I wasn't sure about this when I printed out the recipe but figured I would give it a try. Glad I did! Everyone loved it! The only changes I made were that I used light ranch dressing, low fat cheese and fried up some bacon and crumbled it rather than use the bits.  Definitely worth the extra effort. As other reviews suggested, I waited until the last ten minutes to add the cheese. Thanks for a great recipe. Will make again!

I really liked this one. I wasn't sure I would, because I am not a huge fan of teriyaki, but it went really well.  Next time I think I will mix the ranch and teriyaki together before putting over the chicken breast instead of just pouring on the ranch after. As others have mentioned, we used real bacon and put the bacon and cheese on for the last 10 minutes. Thanks so much!

Our family loved this. What a great recipe. I covered the chicken when I baked it and all the cheese and bacon fell off. I had to take the lid off and reapply the cheese and bacon. I left the lid off and baked it 5 more minutes and it turned out perfect. I mashed up some potatoes and used gravy from the chicken on top, It was awesome. It was my favorite gravy ever. Thanks for a great recipe.

I give it a 5 on what it "would have been".  I used the ranch mix with adding sour cream...the dish was way too salty, but I contribute it to that.  I should have just used the dressing.  I was trying to cut some of the fat.  Next time, I will.  It was still yummy, but had to scrape off the cream sauce.

Not a fan.  My family wasn't keen on the flavor combinations.  Won't make it again.

Great recipe. Chicken can get boring, but this recipe has enough variety to keep things interesting. As a mom of preschoolers, I also have to say that this is very kid-friendly! The bacon & cheese keep the kids happy, but it still tastes sophisticated enough for adults.

this was good...i mixed the dressing and sauce together it made a gorgeous color and tasted really good...when i make it again i would skip the browning and instead marinade the chicken in the sauce for abt half an hour ...i also took the advice of others and added cheese at the end abd used real bacon

Not my gig, sorry. I was intrigued by the strange mixture of teriyaki and ranch dressing - for good reason, I now know. I mixed the two together before slathering it on the chicken and threw some chipotle cheddar cheese on during the final 5 minutes of cooking. The chicken had lots of flavor, so I could see how this would appeal to many. While I likely won't make this one again, it was nice to give it a shot. Thanks!

Tried this recipe based on rating and it turned out great! I followed the suggestion to use fresh bacon and ended up cutting it into thin pieces and it garnished the dish so nicely! no leftovers for this one!

This was so good!  I browned the chicken in margarine for flavor, flipped the chicken halfway through baking, reapplied ranch dressing and then finally topped with cheese and bacon bits the last 10 minutes. I can't wait to make it for a party or something!

I would suggest butterflying the breasts
to perhaps absorb more flavor. It was just okay. There was no "pop" to the flavor of the chicken. Might be a good dish for a beginner cook. I would not make again. Sorry

It wasnt as amazing as I expected from all the reviews. It did however seem to be even better as a left over. 

It wasnt bad, but it isn't something that I would make that often.

I've been in a 'cooking rut' though I LOVE cooking/baking.  I found this recipe a few weeks ago and made it.  My husband has asked for it several times.  I'm making it tonight again.  My kiddo's are kind of picky but they aren't arguing about dinner tonight.  YUMMY!  The different tastes mix together so well!

Made this for my boyfriend and it was delicious!  The combination of the teriyaki and ranch was suprisingly tasty.  I added the bacon and cheese in the last 15 minutes of baking time, and also used fresh bacon instead of canned bacon bits.

This was really good.  I made it for a family dinner party for 15 people.  It was easy to prepare a lot in a relatively short time--always a plus when serving larger groups.  It was a bit too salty for my taste.  Also, I used real bacon rather than bacon bits.  Everyone served this liked it and asked for the recipe.

this is great just as is. The top becomes crispy and yet there are juices from the ranch dressing and melted cheese to pour over potatoes. I never have any teriyaki so I use some cajun meat rub.

My family loved this!  My husband said it was one of the best chicken dishes I have ever made.  I thought it was good, but not great.  But it's so easy I will be making it again.  I am not a big fan of artificial bacon, but I used it as this recipe called for.  Next time I think I will try real bacon.

I made this for dinner for company the other night, and WOW!!!  The chicken was so tender and juicy, and full of flavor.  I didn't have any green onions, but it was still wonderful.  The leftovers are also awesome.  I am definitely keeping this recipe. :)

It's been a long time since I made this, but I just realized I never reviewed it.  I didn't really care for the mixture of teriyaki, ranch and cheese.  It tasted odd to me. I don't think I would make it again, and it is certainly nothing I would serve to guests.

I wish I could give this a five star rating, but I was pretty disappointed in the dish; the taste was okay, but I found the appearance to be rather unappetizing.  Oh well, it was certainly worth a try but I doubt I will be making it again.

A little salty, but decent. Don't think I would run out and make this again. No big raves from the family, just wondering what was in it. I did marinate the chicken for 2 hours before, maybe that made it too salty. Maybe next time I would find a thicker sauce.

This is the best receipe I have found on this site so far. My husband actually asks me to make this and he's usually an "I don't care" guy when I ask what he'd like for dinner. I used chicken thighs instead of breasts and they were delicious. This one is definately a keeper!

This was soooo good and easy to make!  Next time I may wait 15 minutes to put the cheese and everything on cuz it melted off and onto the pan and burned.  I will make it again!

This was really good. I couldn't taste the teriyaki sauce, but I'm not sure I used the right thing (the sauce I used was really thin). The chicken was tender and juicy, and I liked the cheese and bacon on top. Will keep this recipe. Thanks!

Great Recipe. I love to cook and am always looking for new chicken recipes.  I didn't have teriyali so I mixed sweet & sticky BBQ sauce with garlic, soy and lemon juice to taste.  My husband said he could have it every week!

This chicken was very moist and tasty! The only thing I would do different is cut down on teriyaki sauce, it was a little over powering, but overall a good dish and will make again!

This chicken has a great blend of flavours, and works well with just about any sort of side dish.  It reheats well and is easy to cook, so it makes a great dish to serve en masse.

My friend and I made this last night for our boyfriends and it couldn't have turned out better! I used homemade buttermilk ranch and it tasted GREAT on it. I also didn't put the cheese and bacon on until the last 10 minutes.I didn't use the whole jar of bacon..I used about 3/4 of it and saved some for a salad.It worked out gteat!It cooked in exactly 30 min's and was tender and juicy when I took it out.What a GREAT recipe.

Overall I thought this was very good. I will make it again for sure. 
The next time I make this, I will first make sure I find a thick yummy teriyaki sauce. I think that is a big key to this dish. 
Although the one I used was ok…I think the dish could improve if a better sauce was used. 
Thanks for the recipe!

The only way I would eat this is if I am on a low-carb diet (which I am).  It is a decent low carb recipe but I wouldn't eat this if I wasn't following the diet because it really isn't all that good.  It is a strange mix of flavors.

I really thought this would taste better than it did.  The teriyaki and ranch was a nice mix, but it needed something more in the way of taste.

Sounded better than it was, my family thought it was just okay, not bad, not good enough to even want to make it again. Sorry. We eat nothing but foods from scratch and this seemed like it would be good - it's just okay.

My husband and I loved it and the kids thought it was good too.  I marinated the chicken for 2 hours beforehand.  I also added the onion, bacon (used real), and cheese during the last 10 minutes of baking.

Very tasty. I used half mozarella for cheese because my cheddar was too sharp. I also added the cheese,onion and crumbled bacon the last 10 minutes as suggested by other cooks. Will definitely make again, next time I will marinate the chicken overnight first. Thanks Vicki!

Yummy!!! My husband loved it too and that doesn't happen often.  I used real bacon (I just cook a bit extra on weekend mornings to use), forgot the parsley and it was just awesome.

Pretty good and very easy.  I like to bread the chicken before browning.  Otherwise, no changes needed.  This is a great weekday throw it all together dish with ingredients already in the pantry.

I like everything in this.  EVERYTHING!  But it just didn't blend.  Strong flavor of bacon bits and not too much more.  I thought this would be a hit, but I won't make it again.

So quick, so easy and so delicious.  Served with corn  and crusty bread.  Dinner done.  I also did not add the cheese or bacon until the last 10 minutes.  Next time I may just bake the chicken and not brown in pan first to simplify even more.

My husband really enjoyed this and wants to make this on the grill (though I'm wondering how he'll accomplish it). Next time I think I'll marinate the chicken in the teryiaki before cooking it, and then add the ranch, cheese, and bacon in the last 15 minutes. The flavors worked well, and I thought the chicken was cooked perfectly.

I'd give more stars to this recipe if I could!  This was SO easy and really flavorful - should be in every mom's "Not sure what to make tonight" file!!  I served this with bag salad and 90 second microwave Uncle Bens and had dinner on the table in no time.

My family thought this recipe was very good. I wasn't sure how the flavors would come together, but it was very tasty. I'm sure I'll get requests for this again!

I had run out of ideas before this recipe was found, and I was quite shocked when I tasted the end result.  FANTASTIC!  I had no teriyaki so made due w/ a mixture of garlic vinegar, soy sauce, and sugar, and replaced bacon with some shredded pepperoni.  Yum!  This one' nice enough for guests and little prep time is great!

This was quite good. I mixed together the ranch and teryaki sauces and poured it over the chicken. Very yummy. The only drawback is it's really salty.

I made this for a pot luck dinner and everyone requested the recipe.  I used chicken tenders and only browned them on one side.  The dish is a little bit greasy so the second time I made it, I used low fat cheddar and a little less bacon bits (I used real bacon).  You could probably use a low fat ranch dressing too with good results.

This was really excellent. I decided I had to try it based on the reviews and how odd the flavors sounded together. It was really rich so I couldnt eat it often, but I would make it again. My boyfriend loved it and he is pretty picky. I substituted tomatoes for the green onion which I thought was fabulous. The problem I had was how VERY MESSY it was. When I tried getting the chicken out of the baking dish all the toppings fell off and I had to scoop them back on. It wasnt pretty.

This is my daughter's favorite dish!!! I use real bacon and teriyaki sauce and ranch. I don't use green onion though because I have small children. I guess what we make is sort of a mix between the anniversery chicken 1 and 2!!!

I love this recipe.  I served it to a dinner party of 10 and everyone just loved it.  I took it to a friends house when her husband died and it was a big hit then too.  This recipe is definately a keeper.

Not bad, not great. I'll go back and find others' suggestions to tweak the recipe and try again. I was looking for "WOW!" and got "its ok". Kind of a ummer. I'm willing to give it another go though.

I made this for my husband and myself.  My husband just could say it was different and didn't know if that was good or bad.  I didn't have teriyaki sauce so I used soy sauce instead but I don't think that would have changed the taste that much from what it should have tasted like.  So I don't know if I will be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe though.

I'm still undecided about whether I like this or not...the flavor combination is unique, to say the least. Having said that though, I say give it a try, you may be like the other 1000 or so people on here that absolutely loved it. It's SUPER easy to put together albeit a lot of grease so I tried to lighten it up a little by adding a side of rice and some greens with some crumbled cheese, almonds, cranberries and a spritz of dressing...it makes a filling dinner.

I did change a couple things, I had a sesame honey glaze that I used instead of the teriyaki and I used real sliced bacon. Turned out wonderful!

Ok, I know this is a Hall-of-Famer, but we did not like this chicken.  Made it exactly like the recipe and it just wasn't that great.  The combo of teriyaki and ranch was just too weird.

It was okay.  It is quite a bit of work and it is nothing x-tra good.  I will not make this again.  The recipe turned out fine, but the taste is not the best we've had.  My family did not eat the left overs.

This was just an ok recipe, to us.  I think it would have been better had I marinated the chicken with the teriyaki sauce for a few hours.  It also was not a very attractive dish.  IF I try it again, I will work harder on the presentation.

This was a flavorful, easy recipe that both my husband, and his best friend liked a lot.  I marinated the chicken in the teriyaki sauce overnight, but marinated another piece (for hubbys friend who decided to join us) for only about a half an hour.  Both were delicious, so I don't think marinating overnight is really neccesary.   I will probably make this again.

I had with white rice and asparagus for a quick dinner night.  Easy and good.  Instead of bacon bits, I tore in bigger pieces.

Everyone that I have made this recipe for loves it. At first the combination of ingredients was a bit scary sounding but it all came together in a very tasty way!!

it was really easy to make but maybe i didn't use enough sauce and dressing because it didn't have a lot of taste. Will try again though.

This was so much better that I was expecting it to be.  I was a little unsure of the mixture of ingredients but it turned out delicious and pretty easy.  I made this for my father who usually isn't crazy about chicken dishes and he raved over this one.  Very flavorful and just perfect.

Fantastic!  I used low salt teriyaki sauce, and shredded monterey jack cheese.  I also added a can of (non marinated) artichokes, quartered.  Artichokes went very well and stretched the meal a bit since I was low on chicken.  This is definitely a keeper.  Can't wait to make it again!

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly.  The leftovers tasted better the next day.  Next time I might try letting it marinate for a couple of hours before cooking it.

Great flavor even though I was very skeptical, but I wish the sauce was thicker and stayed on the chicken better.

This was OK; my husband really liked it but I ended up scraping up most of the toppings and eating the chicken by itself. I think some of the flavors just didn't go well together for me.

This was ok for us.  I liked the flavor but maybe it would have been better if I could have marinated the chicken in the teriaki sauce for a while.  Good but not the best thing I have ever made!

It is definitely easy to make. My husband did like it. I would make it again but I  wouldn't write home over it !!! It was a little rich and salty. When I make it again I might try the low fat low salt version.

This recipe is quick and easy and tastes delicious.  I didn't have any bacon bits or green onions, so I made it without and it still tasted great.  The sauce is very salty; a little goes a long way.  Thanks for the recipe Vicki!

We loved this recipe. Taste like bacon ranch chicken. I diced the cooked chicken and poured the teriyaki sauce and ranch dressing over it follwed by the cheese, bacon and onions. Excellent!!

This recipe was delicious.  I made it for our 30th wedding anniversary because the name was fitting and I thought it sounded really good.  My daughter came over to eat with us and we all loved it!  I mixed the teriyaki sauce with the dressing and let it marinade for awhile and it turned out great.  I had one left so I took it to work the next day and the guys all said it looked so good so I gave them all a bite and now we are fixing it for food day this week!

Wow! That is the first word out of my husband's mouth as he finished his first bite. Who would have thought ranch and teriyaki would be such a great combination?? This chicken was moist, new and a great idea to spice up some chicken breasts. Make enough for seconds! We finished our chicken before even touching the loaded baked potatoes... and in our house, THAT is a rare occassion! :)

My husband, who usually complains when we have chicken had seconds!  I didn't have any bacon bits, so I used real crumbled bacon.  I will make again.

this was ok, would probably make again with a couple modifications. i tried mixing the ranch and teryiaki and didn't like it.  i think maybe next time i will marinate the chicken in the teryiaki for a while and spoon on the ranch.

This recipe was very tasty.  I mixed the teriyaki with the dressing.  I used creamy caesar dressing (didn't have ranch onhand).  Worked wonderfully. Dish looked as good as it tasted.

The flavor of this dish is excellent and unique. I think I will mix the dressing and teriyaki in the future tries and perhaps look at real bacon.

Yummy! I used low-sodium soy sauce instead of teriyaki, because it was what I had on hand. My husband really liked it, it will become a regular at our house. Thanks!

I thought this dish was just "okay", however, my husband and kids seemed to really like it. I do plan on making it again , when I find something they like it's a "keeper" which is why I rate it 4 stars.

A huge hit in this family - everyone loves the flavor, and I love that I have most of the ingredients on hand.  Leftovers are great.  I usually serve this with mashed potatoes - if there's any extra sauce, it's great on them.  The only knock is that it is a bit salty, so try to cut back where you can.

Super recipe!  My whole family loved it, even the picky eater who doesn't like chicken.  Followed the recipe exactly except put the cheese on during the last 10 minutes of cooking as another reviewer had suggested.  Thanks, Vicki!!

I first reviewed this in 2005 and we loved it.  Tried it again tonight after a loooong break, and now we've found it's WAY too salty.  Flavor was very good, but we couldn't get past the overload of salt.  Guess that's a good thing as far as our diet goes?!

Like most others, I thought it was a bit salty and will use either low sodium bacon or low sodium terriyaki sauce (If I can find it). Other than that, it was great. I added fresh mushrooms as well and waiting until the last 10 min or so to add the cheese. Super good & easy! Almost tastes like chicken marsala.

Yumm! Just like potato skins, but on chicken. I thought the teriyaki sauce was an odd addition, but it gave the ranch a nice kick. Very good!!

I love this dish even though you may whince at the combination of ingredients.  I usually put in broiler right before serving to brown the top.  Tastes delicious.

This was great! I just made one peice to make sure I liked it before making a whole batch, and now I wish I had made more! It was very good. Things did seem to melt off a little bit into the pan but what was left on the chicken was just the right amount of flavor. I added extra cheese 5 minutes before it was done and it was sooo good. Definitely will make it again. Thanks!

I thought it was just OK, but the rest of my family really liked this, the flavor was good with a definite hint of chinese. Good accompanyment to rice. Quick and easy to prepare, I blended the terriyaki sauce and the ranch dressing together to spread more evenly. This ones a keeper

I loved it, used real bacon, and make sure you check chicken, because mine was perfect at 25 minutes cook time, I cut in half whole breasts. Also basting the sauce after cooking helps keep the flavor all over chicken. Yum

Tried this recipe when I had relatives in from out of town.  Everyone loved it.  I used real cooked bacon instead of bacon bits from a can.  I didn't have a problem with the chicken being too dry like others have reported.  I used fairly large chicken breasts last time.  Will probably cut breasts to smaller parts next time and reduce the amount of time browning.

Average recipe.  Easy to make, but if it took any more time, it wouldn't be worth it.  Chicken was a bit dry.  Maybe covering while it cooks would help, but I think a light suace would make it better.

This was yummy.  The chicken did turn out a bit on the chewy side.  I marinated the chicken in the teriyaki sauce overnight. I think next time I will not marinate overnight and I will brown the chicken for less time. Overall, very tasty!

Really wanted to L*O*V*E this recipe (seemed easy and different), but only liked it.  Not giving up though.  Has potential.  Next time I will marinate in teriyaki first and add a bit more ranch dressing.  Both those flavors get lost if you follow recipe- and you end up tasting just chicken breasts with melted cheddar cheese and bacon.

The flavor of this was excellent.  I used Just 2 Good low fat ranch dressing and low fat cheddar cheese.  The only complaint my husband had was that all the topping slid off and was gone before he was done with the chicken breast.  The taste was so good he wanted it in every bite.  I think next time I may cut the chicken breasts into big chunks and then put all the toppings on to get better coverage.  You would have to adjust cooking time but I am going to give it a try.

I was very hesitant about making this but I like to try new things.  It sounded weird to me but the reviews were good so I tried it.  I am really glad I did.  It was really good!  My whole family loves it.  I did cut the teriyaki sauce in half and doubled the ranch dressing.  I will definitely make again...Thanks for sharing!

This was a big hit in my family with 8 children.  I had to make it again one week after I made it the first time.  I think next time I'll try marinating the chicken in the basting sauce for awhile before cooking.

I liked this recipe and so did my husband until he saw all the dirty dishes. The rule in our house is if you cook, you don't have to clean up (LOL).  I will definitely make this again.

OMG!  This was astoundingly good!  My 6 yr. old raved!  My 12 yr. old devoured the stuff!  My husband was near estacy!  (Me, too!)  I can't wait to make it again!  I used low sodium teriyaki, and low fat Ranch, and low fat Cheddar.  Wonderful, and so easy!
NOTE - Don't use fat free ranch dressing!  I did the 2nd time I prepared this, and it just wasn't anywhere near as good.  It changed the texture, flavor and appearance.  This dish is soooo good as written!  It's worth using regular Ranch Dressing!

This was tasty ehough but not great.  I used real bacon rashers which I chopped up.  It wasn't bad for a really quick dinner preparation.

I loved this recipe. I used fat free Ranch Dressing and it did really good. I didn't have shredded lite cheese so used a slice of 2% chedder on each piece of chicken. I appredciate it b/c it's low in calories and fat.

I made this tonight after reading all of the reviews.  My picky husband and my VERY picky 6 yr old LOVED IT.  We are adding it to our rotation!  I did make a couple of changes to mine that were suggested.  I cooked real bacon, and fried the chicken in the bacon dippings instead of oil.  For the teriyaki sauce, I found the KC Masterpiece Honey Teriyaki marinade worked awesome (1/4 cup).  It has about 1/2 the sodium as the kikkoman brand.  I've passed this recipe to 2 neighbors already!!!

Easy and delicious!  This recipe was a hit with my whole family.  Even my 8-year-old, who doesn't care for ranch dressing, refers to this dish as her "favorite" chicken.  I either buy thin-sliced chicken breast or pound regular chicken breast to 1/4 inch before browning -- mainly because my family prefers thinner cuts of chicken.

Like most others, I must admit that this combination sounded strange but with all the raves I had to try it, and I'm glad I did!  Made it just as directed by the recipe and turned out wonderful.  I will pound down the breasts next time so the thickness is more even and there's more surface to cover with the delicious sauce, but no changes other than that.  I will DEFINITELY make this easy yet awesome recipe again!

My six kids ask for this often, which says a lot. Sometimes I use half-strips of bacon which makes it look prettier.

This is a really fun recipe.  I tend to make this when I we have leftover bacon (which actually isn't often).  It's a easy recipe to mix up the ingredients depending on what you have on hand.  I've made it with bbq sauce in place of teriaki suace.  With different cheeses, with or with out the green onions but I think I've always left in the Ranch dressing.  Who doesn't love Ranch?

GREAT! My husband just loved this recipe! He would like to have this again! I used the homemade teriyaki sauce (scaled in half) from this sites recipe for "Baked Teriyaki Chicken" and it was wonderful! Very simple to make, quick and easy! Absolutely Hall of Fame! Thanks for the post!

I followed a few bits of advice from other reviewers, I did use real bacon & I tried to find a lower sodium teriyaki sauce and had a hard time, I ended up just buying the one with the lowest sodium content.  I must say I thought the ingredients seemed a little strange but this turned out great.  I served it over rice but would be good over pasta too.  I will definately be making this again!

good recipe-- very different-- a little too salty but serving over rice helps remedy this-- I recommend using real bacon and cooking chix (i cut the breasts into strips) in the bacon grease- served at a dinner club and had good reviews, though not sure I can get past the combo of ingredients!!

The combination sounds different - But, WOW are they great together!  I did take the advice of another rating and fry my own bacon instead of using bacon bits - much better!

This was a good change of chicken pace.  We didn't have bacon bits so I finely chopped up some ham lunch meat and threw it in a pan to crisp it up.  The only thing I didn't like was the chicken was a little rubbery... this could have been my fault though :)

This sounds a little weird, but tastes great! I did make a few changes using real bacon and cutting the chicken into bite sized chunks and sauteeing them.

This is a family favorite. We make it for company all the time. We love the sauce so I usually 1 1/2 times the sauce or double it. This is great as leftovers too. The sauce tends to thicken up more. AND, we have made extra and frozen it and it is great when defrosted and reheated. VERY easy to make. We love it!! Thanks for the recipe.--I have tried it with swiss cheese as well and it is great that way too.

Good recipe-although my husband loves it more than I do. To cut down on the salt we halve Terriyaki and Ranch dressing. Just use the terriyaki as a baste as suggested by other reviewers and it helps alot. Plus I use real bacon and saute the chicken in the bacon grease.

I substitued honey bbq sauce for the teriyaki sauce, and it was sooo good.  I will definitely be making this many more times.  It is so easy, and it doesn't mess up every pan in the kitchen. I love it!!

I've been making this recipe on a regular basis for a while now, everyone I make it for loves it!  I too usually use real bacon bits, and sometimes double up on them.  Another thing I tried one day when I was out of teriyaki sauce was barbque sauce for an interesting and tasty variation!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

this was pretty bland.  All the flavors were on top of the chicken, and there was none inside.

I get requests for this dish at least once a week.  I grill chicken rather than fry it to make it a bit healthier and less messy.  Very easy recipe!

I can't believe I added this recipe to my "Recipe Box" in March of 2000, and I just got around to making it. 3 years lost of making this over and over again. It has all our favorites on it...ranch, bacon, cheese. I will be making this again soon!

Great recipe. Simple and all the kids loved it, even my picky six year old.  I lightly floured the chicken before browning in skillet.

I got a huge wow from my fiance when I made this last night!  We were both a bit skeptical of mixing teryiaki and ranch together, but the two together make a very wonderful flavor!  It's not too difficult to make, 30 mins and you've got dinner!  Thanks for sharing this great tasting easy recipe, Vicki!

An unusual, but easy and tasty dish.  Only thing I changed was to use real bacon.  I may tinker with the seasonings a little next time, but that's just me.  Nice to have another fast, delicious way to make chicken.

I was not crazy about this dish but my fiance loved it. I will give it four stars just for easy prep alone. The only thing I will do differently next time is use real bacon, not the bits. They tasted funny.

Yummy, different, cheap, and easy - 4 things I love in a recipe! After reading the reviews here, I added the cheese and bacon (I snipped up about 4 slices of pre-cooked bacon - I'd like to hug whoever invented that stuff!) during the last 15 minutes of cooking and it turned out great. I think next time I'll try it without the cheese to cut down on the fat, and because the flavors of the teriyaki/ranch sauce are flavorful enough without it. (And I could live on cheese so for me that's saying a lot!) A great recipe!

This was great! Even despite a couple of mistakes on my part (forgot to get green onions and bacon bits at the grocery and accidentally used basil instead of parsley), it turned out wonderfully. It was even better the next day - the sauce had thickened and was more seasoned. We even toasted a couple of bagels and ladled the leftover sauce onto them as a snack - YUM! Thanks!

GREAT!  I didn't have teryaki sauce, so I substituted Worcestershire sauce, and marinated them about 15 mins before browning. Everyone loved it. Will try next time with the teryaki sauce, and I"m sure it will be just as good!

I was excited to try this because of the rave reviews.  The flavors were intruding too much with each other that I could hardly decipher them. This is disappointing.

One of the better chicken recipes I've found.  Soaks the flavor right in!  I combine all ingredients and pour over the top.  I do not brown the chicken first.

I'll have to try this one again....I must have done something wrong. The chicken itself tasted pretty good, although it might have been a little too rich, and I felt a little queasy afterwards. Perhaps I added too much of something?

This is my husband's favorite dish I think I've ever made. We both, however, really llike the strong flavors, and we especially like teriyaki sauce. I use real pieces of bacon, and don't use the onion. I don't know if I'd serve it for company just because it's so strong and I don't know if everyone would like it. But we LOVE it!

Very good and unique recipe!  My picky husband said it was great.  I also added the bacon, cheese and onions the last part of cooking.  I think I'll add some diced tomatoes next time too.

a keeper.  served with sliced scallions as a condiment because some of the kids don't like onions, but otherwise perfect.  I did add sauce to breasts 15 minutes into baking so it did not melt off as suggested by other reviewers.  went well with jasmine rice.  thank you for this recipe!

This was pretty good.  A friend actually suggested to marinate the chicken in the terriaki for an hour and then proceed with instructions.  He said it will give the chicken more of a flavor.  I think I will try that next time.

Very good and easy to make, however it looked gross when the teriaki and ranch mixed together.

This was great- my boyfriend loved it.  I used 1/3 less fat Ranch dressing and fat free cheese and it still came out incredible.  This is a keeper!

Good recipe!  I added double the cheese to this recipe and I added a little extra teriyaki sauce.  Will probably make again with some more tweaks to it, but most likely not since thre are so many other delicious recipes on this site to try!

The chicken was very flavorable and juicy.  My husband will not eat ranch dressing but he told me the chicken was very good.  After he made that comment, I told him the ingredients.  Surprise!

I've gotta admit, I was more than a little bit skeptical when I saw the ranch dressing and terriyaki sauce together.  But I figured that those many favorable reviews couldn't be wrong.  I'm glad I took the plunge!   This recipe is aces all around!!!

This was a HIT with my family!! My husband, the original picky eater, LOVED it....said that it was possibly the best chicken dinner he'd ever had! The ingredients were kind of scary-sounding together but the resulting dish was delicious. Next time we'll have some super-duper baked potatoes to go with it. Even the kids loved it! (and we have FOUR little picky taste testers!!!)

This WAS really good, I was a bit hesitant after reading the ingredients, but it was so delicious. I'm sure it makes a difference if you use a good Ranch dressing too. I will definately make this again.

Wow!  I just looked back in my "recipe box" to see approx. how long my DH and I have loved this recipe *drum roll*...since at least 2002.  It is by far our favorite chix recipe.  In fact, despite it only being 5a.m. my taste buds are warming up!  LOL :)  At any rate, the ONLY thing I do differently is to marinate the breasts in teriyaki, or, if don't have teriyaki on hand, low sodium soy with a splash of oil and a "blop" of honey.  Heavenly!  Thanks again Vicki!!!  (Oh, and btw, I considered going back and reading my previous review - but 696 seemed too daunting!!)

Just had to try this recipe after reading the reviews.  Everyone in my family loved it, all seven!  This is a must to try, easy to prepare. (I hate to cook) Was hoping for leftovers, no such luck.  I am axnious to take this to a family reunion.

Great dish!  Skip the browning like I did, it's a waste.  I used enough lite teriyaki that the chicken was sort of swimming in it.  It was perfect so that there was enough juice to keep everything nice and moist.  Also, added more ranch and used fresh bacon.  It's still salty, so maybe low sodium bacon next time since I will definitely make again.

With so many people review and rating this recipe, I was expecting something amazing. I wasn't wowed by it! To be honest, it was best the second time it was reheated. It wasn't terrible by any means but it was just ordinary and plain. Not worth the amount of reviews that it got.

We really like the combination of flavors in this dish, although I use real bacon.  I've made it twice: once with boneless breasts, and once with boneless thighs.  The thighs are MUCH better--really tender and juicy.  The breasts were okay, but kind of dry.  Yes, thighs have more fat, but if you are making this dish, you're obviously not worried about fat content!

My husband really liked this recipe.  I found it a little salty and it called for too much teryaki sauce.  I would make it again with low sodium teryaki sauce and only half as much.

My family doesn't care for teriyaki flavoring so I substituted salsa. It was awesome! I have also tried ranch dip mix (which is thicker) instead of the ranch dressing. Everything stuck to the chicken alot better. I also found stabbing the breasts with a knife and then browning them on the grill is alot faster and cleaner than stove top browning. It is now a family favorite.

After reading all the rave reviews we were disappointed and still trying to figure out what all the hoopla was about!  
It has a strong teriyaki sauce taste.  Maybe the leftovers will taste better.

My husband loved this recipe.  I thought it was very good as well but it is probably not one of my top favorites.  I marinated the chicken overnight.  You have to be careful not to overcook the chicken because it can tend to get dry.

This was a very tasty recipe. Our guests loved it and asked for the recipe. I would recommend putting more ranch dressing then what is called for, more sauce for dipping.

This recipe combined some very different ingredients to make one great dish!  We enjoyed this chicken
thoroughly and will add it to our menu but will use less teriyaki sauce.  Just a personal preference!
I recommend you try this one! UPDATE: Made this dish again with less teriyaki and loved it.  Great dish with lots of flavor!

Absolutely one of the best chicken recipes I have made so far. Be sure and make plenty as you will want to have extra for tomorrows leftovers and maybe the day after that as well. Thanks Vicki, this one is definitely a keeper.

I make this for myself and my boyfriend all the time (omitting onions).   It is wonderful!  The topping is super flavorful.  I add extra sauces and cheese while baking.  Will probably try marinating overnight as some others have suggested.  Simply delicious!

I made this chicken recipe last night. It was great!!! My boyfriend loved it too. The only thing I would try next time is to use real bacon instead of bacon bits. We had some left over and I brought it to work to eat for lunch, even thought I wanted to eat the rest last night. It smelled delicious while it was baking.

Anyone giving this a bad review should try this alternate way;  Marinate the chicken in the teriyaki for 4 to 8 hrs.  Skip the skillet 
(step 2)entirely and go right to step 3.  Yummy in the tummy!

I don't much like bacon bits, I hate ranch dressing, and I'm not a fan of green onions, either.  The teriyaki-ranch thing freaked me out, but I just had to try it with so many positive reviews.  IT'S AWESOME, REALLY EASY and tastes little like the respective ingredients

This chicken recipe ROCKED! DELISH!  My husband woofed it down! My only suggestions are to use real bacon (the bits didn't do it justice), and to add the cheese about 10 mins. before turning off the oven.  You never would have thought these ingredients would've worked together - but they did! Thanks!

This was just okay for me.  It tasted very "processed" in that it was salty and I don't think the combination of flavors melded quite right. Not awful, but this won't be on my rotation - sorry!

What a delicious meal!  I like to marinade the chicken in the teriyaki sauce for a few hours or overnight.  This makes it taste even better!

Agree with one of the previous reviers on this page...I liked it well enough last night, but the leftovers today were much tastier!  I will try to marinade it next time and see if that makes a difference.  Overall great recipe and my husband definitely wants me to make it again!

I am like some of the others here. I am glad I just made this for my boyfriend and I- it would have been embarrassing to serve it to company. It was not much effort to make-but even so I would never make it again.

What a great recipe! I also used real bacon, it turned out terrific.  My kids (usually picky) and husband ate every bit of it.  Even the leftovers were great.  The chicken did not dry out when heated up in the microwave.

WOW....what a surprise this little number was! I had thawed boneless chicken tenders my mistake, but had everything already in the fridge and gave it a whirl....it was excellent. And since the chicken pieces were thinner than breasts, the whole thing was done in about 40 minutes. The 'sauce' was great over buttered linguine, and with pineapple chunks and peas, the meal was a snap!
Thanks !

I don't know what all the hype is about.  This was a tasty dish and fairly easy to prepare and I'd make it again for a quick dinner, but it was nothing amazing.  I wouldn't dream of serving this for company in a million years, like others suggest.  If I was serving chicken to guests -- I'd make a nice roasted whole chicken with fresh rosemary and herbs.

I was very sceptical about this recipe, but it's actually good! Sort of a creamy teriyaki sauce. I will definitely make it again.

My family loved this unique recipe. I used lite teriyaki sauce (only 1/4 cup) and fat-free ranch dressing to reduce the calories though. It turned out great! I'll make this recipe again soon! Thanks for the recipe.

I was surprised at how good this was.  Somehow it tasted like ham.  My husband even thought that is what I was making by the smell.  It was different but really good.

I made this for a potluck and it was a big hit!  I cut the chicken into cubes to make it easier for people to take a small portion.  Also used a fresh sweet white onion from our garden and fried up some fresh bacon.  It was great!

A really tasty recipe! For a less salty flavor, use Kikkoman's Lite Teriyaki. It's considerably less salty. Thanks for a winner!

My husband is a majorly fussy eater, doesn't like any veges.  This one was a winner will definatly cook it again.
I chopped up the chicken and I didn't have any Ranch dressing so I used 97%fat free Ceasar dressing - still tasted great.

Fabulous taste!! When I made it I used fat free dressing and cheddar cheese to decrease the fat. The only time consuming part of this recipe was browning the chicken. It reminded me of a loaded baked potatoe without the potatoe. Will definitely add this recipe to my list of favorites.

I would try this recipe again, but do not use 1/2 cup of teriyaki sauce.  It was too salty.   I would also recommend putting the cheese and onion in the dish the last 10 minutes of baking.

I love this recipe and have cooked it for company several times.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe to a tee - but the next few times I added extra ranch dressing and extra teriyaki - It came out even better with more sauce!  MAGNIFICENT!!!

I cannot wait to serve this to company!  The chicken was so moist and tender, and the recipe was SO easy!  I scaled it down to 1.  I also used reduced fat/calorie cheese and Ranch dressing.  The dressing I used was Kraft's Light Done Right, and it came out wonderfully!  Thanks for the great dinner!

It was REALLY good but I did find it a little too salty.  I used already cooked bacon instead of bacon bits.  In addition, we poured the sauce over rice that we had with it and it was super delicious!

mm-mm, this dish looked as good as it tasted.  i don't eat pork products, so i used bac-os instead of real bacon bits.  they're completely vegetable-based and tasted great!  the red from the bac-os, the green from the green onions, and the yellow from the cheese really made for a visually appealing combination!  i'm sharing this recipe with all my friends!

Believe all the reviews, this one is GREAT!!!! I am not a good cook, and I tried this recipe, it turned out delicious and was a big hit. Don't let the preparation fool you, it doesn't look like anything special when you prepare it, but somehow the combination of the ingredients just works!!! Incredibly flavorful, and so easy to make!

This dish was great!  The only problem I found is that the teryaki sauce over powered the ranch and made the ranch impossible to taste.

This was quick and very easy.  Has some very unique but incredible flavors!  I used Fat Free Ranch and real turkey bacon crushed.  I loved the enhanced bacon flavor by using real bacon.  Enjoy!!

What I like about this recipe is that it's so easy to cook yet very delicious. I was at first hesitant about the teriyaki sauce and ranch dressing combination but I was pleasantly surprise.

My husband and I loves this recipe!! I read the previous notes on how salty it was and modified it. Instead of using a 1/2 cup of Teriyaki sauce, I used a 1/4 cup.  I would suggest this to anyone if not for the taste , then for the lower sodium.

I loved this recipe although I serve dinner to a picky crowd and the look may deter some from trying it. However, I have to stress it is worth convincing even the pickiest eater to give it a shot.

Well, I must say, I was surprised at how good this recipe really was.  Reading the ingredient list I had visions of chicken drowning in coagulated clumps of ranch dressing, but I had to try it anyway due to its extreme popularity.  Once you spread out the ingredients between 6 chicken breasts, it's not too gloppy, and once the teriyaki and ranch blended and baked together, the resulting sauce tasted like neither one.  We used real bacon, chopped up and fried crisply, instead of the fake-un bits, and we sauteed some mushrooms in some of the bacon fat and added those too.  Good comfort food.  Mmmmm.

Can use bone-in chicken breast halves.  Use size pan according to how many breast using.  After browning (you do not have to brown if in a hurry), brush breast with teriyaki - I use the rule of -- 1 Tblsp. dressing per breast (I used a jalapeno ranch) - one green onion per breast - cheese over top of breast.  I omitted the bacon.  Last 10-15 minutes, I added quartered tomatoes and partially cooked asparagus.  Great recipe and all my family cooks are now using it.

This is unbelievably good.  I thought these ingredients absolutely did not belong together, but I'm glad I was wrong.  I always make extra sauce from the BAKED TERIYAKI CHICKEN from this website and I use that instead of processed teriyaki sauce.  When I have extra time I crumble and fry my own bacon and saute onions in with the bacon.  It is a terrific entree; I would highly recommend this recipe.

I have a 2 year old and a 9 week old... This can make it hard to cook great meals...Poor hubby goes without flavour or variety!! This was easy to cook, 2 y.o ate all of hers, and hubby and I used our tastebuds again..."DELICIOUS"! I'll definately cook this again!

This was an absolutely delicious recipe. All of my family loved it. However, the full page printout of the recipe lists 1/2 cup of T. Sauce and I wondered why. Brushed it in really good, and just added the rest to the pan. Next time I made a note to use much less. Justed noticed that the recipe lists tablespoons, not 1/2 cup. Thanks for something good and simple.

I'm a vegan who loves to cook so from time to time I have to cook for my non-veg friends and family - they are all amazed at this recipe, how I can cook, so well, something I would never eat! It's always a hit!  Already planning to serve it during the holidays next year!!

I wasn't terribly impressed with this... I was really looking forward to it after all 
the reviews I read but was disappointed.  I agree with a previous reviewer that
this was "just average."  I used considerably less teriyaki sauce (maybe 2 table-
spoons) and it was still pretty salty (and I love salt) and it just tasted kinda    
weird to me.  My daughter didn't like it, though my husband did so I might make
a small batch of it from time to time for him, but he'll be the one eating the 
leftovers from tonight.

I am a college student with little-to-no skill in cooking. This recipe was VERY fast, VERY easy, and delicious to boot! I made it for my boyfriend (a very picky eater who hates chicken altogether) and he agreed we should make it again! This recipe will definitely go to all my friends.

This took a while for me to make.  I used real bacon instead of bacon bits.  The meal was VERY rich but delicious.  I like richer foods than my husband does, but he went back for seconds.  I took the leftovers to my grandfather and he loved it also.

I stumbled onto the site and found this recipe. It was really very good and we will have it again. The most pleasant aspect for me is the recipe does not use and exotic spices etc. Thanks.

Made this for company, and while good, it was not as wonderful as expected by all the rave reviews here. So I have to agree with the few others who also found it to be average.  Hard to figure!

Very easy to make and tastes like I spent hours preparing. Chicken stays moist. Now we have something else our picky little eaters will enjoy. Not just cereal and pizza anymore! Try coating with a mild barbacue sauce and add the ranch dressing too. No need to measure ingredients. GREAT AS A LEFTOVER.

While the chicken was incredibly moist and tender.  We found we could not taste either the green onions (which looked dead) or the cheese (we used sharp).  Would most likely not make again without making major revisions. Like adding cheese and green onions for the last 10 minutes of cooking.

I was a little disappointed in this chicken recipe.  After reading the reviews, I thought that this would be amazing, not average.  Maybe I did not use the right kind of Ranch Dressing - Was I supposed to cover with foil while baking, as I left it uncovered & it seemed a little plain.

Our whole family loved this recipe, even my two teenagers.  (my 16 yr old daughter doesn't like onions, bacon or cheese - but said this recipe was good!)  It was so EASY to make and easily converted to 4 servings. I used Light Done Right Ranch Dressing and Teriyaki sauce with Garlic.  Next time, I might try making it with real bacon (or at least using the Hormel Real Bacon in the jar).

Wow - is all I can say. The ingredients are simple enough, but combine them together and - shazam! - one of the best dishes I've had in an LONG time. Our guests couldn't get enough - the husband demanded the recipe and even their 18-month-old kept pointing for more. My only regret is that I didn't make more for leftovers. Thank you so much (I'm salivating just remembering it!).

I have a fussy 20 year old who very rarely will try anything new or something he thinks he won't like but he tried this and loved it as did the rest of the family!  The best is that my husband was impressed (he does 99% of the cooking).

This is an awesome recipe.  I have 5 children ranging in ages from 20 to 8 and they all loved it.  It is quick and easy.  I did, however, use real bacon instead of bacon bits.  I am sharing this recipe with my friends.  Thanks for sharing it with us.

Was easy and pretty tasty but too salty.  I didn't add any salt so I think it was from the teriaki sauce.

This was a great recipe!  Even my "newly picky" five-year-old raved over this one!  I'll bet fresh bacon instead of bacon bits would make this even better, but it's delicious just as it is!

I thought this was a good easy recipe but a bit over-rated.  I used teriyaki glaze.  Maybe that made the difference.  Doesn't seem to be good for leftovers though.

I am not a very good cook and I love being able to read what others think about a certain recipe. I tried this recipe and it went over as a big hit. My kids are picky eaters and there wasn't a bite left on anyones plate.This chicken dish is delicious and easy to fix...I will be adding it to my recipe box

This was SO yummy! My picky three year old even liked this recipe (minus the onions on his serving).  It was so easy to make.  We'll definitely add this to our regular meals list.

I'm a busy florist and this recipe is an excellent
addition to my "holiday season" dinner schedule.

I used Tyson's frozen chicken tender strips, and because
you don't have to thaw the chic first it's really a fast,
delicious entree.

Bravo!

I loved this chicken and so did my husband.  I took the suggestion of cutting the terriyaki sauce in half and doubling the ranch dressing.  The recipe' doesn't specify how many chicken breats to use so I only used 5 and there was more than enough terriyaki to cover them. This was excellent over rice and I believe mixed chicken pieces would be just as tasty in this recipe'.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

My husband and I make this all the time.
We even made this for my In-Laws and they
loved it!!  The only thing I did was that 
I didn't put the scallons on because I don't
like onions but everyone else likes it 
with the onions.

Tasty & easy! I would recommend pounding the chicken breasts to tenderize them, I used skinless/ boneless breasts. I just brushed the breasts with low salt terriaki--plenty of flavor. I forgot to double the ranch dressing, which I regretted. Real bacon is a must. This isn't glamourous, but it is tasty and as easy as can be!

My husband loves this recipe!  He calls it baked potato chicken because of the toppings.  Since I first made this recipe a month ago, I have prepared it 3 times for him (he has requested it).  I have passed the recipe on to several people, who love it also.  I did cut back by a bit on the teriyaki sauce, and I do use real bacon.

Soy Vay Veri Teriyaki, and didn't use as much as recommended 
in the recipe. It gave the chicken a nice, sweet flavor. I'll 
definetely make it again and also serve it to guests!!

This recipe is terrific. I used 1/4 cup low sodium teriyaki sauce and doubled the ranch dressing. Next time will use even more dressing. It makes a great gravy. My husband hates salty food. Thanks to all the previous reviews it turned out perfect.  I will definitly make this again and again.

The ranch dressing and the teriaki are interesting.  I think I might try it again without the teriaki.

I really didn't care too much for this recipe.  It was too rich for my tastebuds.  I used real bacon bits for the recipe also.

This recipe had both good and bad 
points.  On the good side, the chicken 
was very moist and tender.  On the not-
so-good side, the sauce was a little 
too gloppy and greasy for my taste.  It 
was worth a try, but I probably won't 
make it again anytime soon.

I decided to try it after reading so many great reviews but, I DID NOT LIKE IT.  It's too greasy, you cannot taste the ranch dressing, ...I read that it was too salty for a lot of people so I used low-sodium teriyaki,and increased the amount of ranch dresssing but,I guess I sould have used a lot more of the ranch dressing because tit came out a bit dry.) The only two things that we could  taste were the cheddar cheese and the bacon.....Sorry! I would  NOT recommend this one

I was hesitant at first to try this recipe. It was such an odd combination of ingredients. I tried it though, and was quite impressed. Yum!! It was delicious and easy. I used low-sodium teriyaki sauce and low fat cheese. It was scrumptious.

I left out the bacon and after reading other reviews, I used only 1/4 c. teriyaki sauce and 3/4 c. ranch dressing.  I wish I'd used more teriyaki sauce, but it still tasted very good!

Very Good..I used about 3lbs. of meaty chicken pieces and it was great. I doubled the recipe, we like allot of sauce. Sauce is great on a baked potato and increased the time to 50 min. The only ingredient I didn't double was the teriyaki sauce.  For my taste 1/2 c. was more than enough.

The ranch dressing and teriaki sauce sounded like an odd combination, but this dish is fantastic! It's special enough to serve to company, but easy enough that you could make it any time.  My 8 year old picky eater loves it and so do I!

This chicken recipe was great!  After reading the other reviews that complained of it being too salty, I reduced the teriaki sauce by half and almost doubled the ranch dressing.  It smelled and tasted wonderful, I'll definitely make it again.

Definitely rates on the 'no fuss' scale. A little salty, even with low-salt teriyaki.. will adjust the ranch/teriyaki ratio next time, and also double the sauce.  Definitely worth trying again... my husband and I both liked this a lot.

After reading all the wonderful reviews I had to try this.  While making it, I thought "these ingredients are a strange combination".  But it is incredible how all the flavors blend together.  I agree that it was a little on the salty side.  Next time I will use low-sodium teriyaki sauce.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was a very simple recipe to make.  I even used real bacon broken up and it was still very simple and quick.  The family loved it!  I thought that the different flavors blended very well for a unique taste to what can be boring chicken. It was really quite good!

After looking over the reviews of this recipe, I decided to make some adjustments of my own.  I reduced the amount of teriyaki sauce and added the difference with ranch dressing.  I also grilled the chicken on the bbq to lightly brown.  What wonderful flavors.  The entire family loved it. This recipe is definitely being added to my collection.

There were so many great reviews of this recipe, I had to try it. It really is very fast and easy. And it IS tasty! A little salty, but then my husband I like it that way. My whole family liked it a lot, kids included. You do need to add some extra dressing and sauce though. We will be making it again for sure.

I didn't care for this recipe as it was too greasy.  The ingredient combination (ranch dressing, cheese, bacon) sounds great but you really don't taste the ranch dressing at all.

We usually like teriyaki sauce . . . not so in this recipe.  Came on too strong and didn't even notice the ranch dressing.  We finished the meal but probably will not try it again.

I made this for my Mom's birthday party and it was a success.  The teriyaki sauce that I used was extremely liquid, so I did more than just brush a little bit on.  There was quite a bit in the bottom of each pan.  I also used my George Foreman grill to prebrown the chicken and it worked great. I also used real bacon.  I definitely will be making this again sometime. Thanks for submitting it.

THIS WAS VERY EASY AND QUICK TO PREPARE, PERFECT FOR THOSE AFTER WORK MEALS.  MY KIDS LOVED IT AND THE FLAVORS OF THE INGREDIENTS BLENDED NICELY TOGETHER FOR AN UNUSUAL TWIST TO CHICKEN.

This was great but way too salty!  Will use less ranch dressing next time.

it zip!
