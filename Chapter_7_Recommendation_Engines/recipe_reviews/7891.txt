This cake was just what I wanted.Reading the other reviews beforehand(too dense) I simply reversed the order in which i mixed the ingredients. First I mixed the sugar and butter until fluffy,then added the eggs 1by1, then having put all the dry ingredients together beforehand I added a little at a time alternating with the milk. Lastly, I added the vanilla. It turned out very light and fluffy and tasty too!!

Excellent and easy cake! I made this for a co-worker's baby shower cake and brought sample cake made from this recipe and from a very traditional marble cake recipe to the office for them to pick their favorite.  This recipe was the unanimous favorite.  I made changes as suggested by the other reviewers:  added 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup melted shortening to the batter;  I also mixed the cocoa with 1 Tablespoon melted shortening prior to mixing into the batter.  I also was careful to not overbake the cake. It was moist and full of flavor, absolutely delicious!  No cracking of the top, either, and it rose high and light.  This is the easiest "from-scratch" cake I've ever made.

I was very disapointed in how this cake came out. My husband's favorite cake is Marble so I thought I could make one from scratch. Instead of the cake mix kind. I looked everywhere online and found that different sights had this same recipe. I figured it would come out good but instead it was very heavy and thick tasting and thats even with the 3 TBSP of Oil I added. Will constinue to look for another recipe.

This was my first EVER cake made from scratch, it turned out BEAUTIFUL! Since I was using a standard 9x13 cake pan I increased the recipe by half. For example, I used 3 cups of flour, 3 teaspoons baking powder, etc. 

 The only thing I did differently was that I took other users advice and used additional 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup oil. Plus I added 1/2 a package of instant vanilla pudding and 1/2 cup extra milk. The cake evenly filled the pan to about 3 1/2 inches high baked and is EXCEPTIONALLY moist and flavorful. This is from now on going to be our family's standard birthday cake. Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

I made this for my husband because he loves marble cake, his grandmother makes it for him all the time and she is from Germany so it is always good. My husband said that it didn't taste like marble cake. The cake just doesn't taste like marble cake and it is pretty dry, not moist at all and I even added some oil. I am very disappointed in this recipe, I will not use it again and I will have to keep looking for a good marble cake.

Great recipe, but I would mix butter with sugar,oil, eggs and vanilla first. Then add the rest.

This is an amazing cake.  I doubled it for two 9” layers, adding 25% more sugar and 50% more butter (salted), as other reviewers suggested.  With three sticks of butter and all of four eggs, it was practically torte!  Light, crumbly and heavy all at the same time.  Add to that the butter cream icing and… well, they loved it. Even so, I would say it's flavor was pretty mellow due to all the eggs and butter. I think you could fix this cake’s flavor problem, as noted by other reviewers, by doubling the salt.   My best yellow cake recipe calls for lots of eggs and butter, as well, but about double the salt.  A little extra vanilla or higher quality vanilla will round out the flavor, as well.  Next time, I will use salted butter again, just not so much of it, and double the salt, add a little extra vanilla and no extra sugar.   Oh, and one more thing—I am a purist about presoaking baking flour before cooking with it (or using sprout flour), so for this recipe, I mixed the flour, milk and salt in the evening around 7 p.m. and let it sit at room temperature overnight.  The next morning, I mixed the remaining ingredients in a separate bowl, added the flour mixture to it, and baked it in two insulated 9” round pans for about 45 minutes.   Worked out awesome.

The recipe states 1 8 inch layer cake. That is a single layer. The recipe actully made 2 8 inch layer cakes.
    It cracked TERRIBLY on top. Tasted blan. Hardly a cake taste at all.  I am SO glad that I made this cake 2 days before my son's birthday because I would've been embarrased to serve this cake at his party. NOW to go find a cake recipe for his birthday party.....

This recipe was so easy and delicious, my husband and his family enjoyed a LOT!! I didn't follow the directions though, I beat the eggs and butter first and put the flour, baking soda, salt and sugar in another bowl. When I had the egg and butter mix ready I added the flour mix and the milk little by little and added 3 teaspoons of oil, at the end put the vanilla. I follow after with the cocoa powder and mixed  with the reserved batter. I totally recommended! :D

As written I am sorry to give this a low rating and normally do not rate a cake under 4.   In this case the ingredients are fine but it is the method that produces a heavy dense cake.   Suggest that the butter (not anything else) is beaten together with sugar until very, very light and cream.   Beat in eggs, one at a time and then blend in dry ingredients alternately with milk.   Hope this works for others too.

A very good and easy cake that tastes great! I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved it! I personally think that adding more sugar would make the cake too sweet, but that really depends on the cook's taste. I will definitely make this one again.

I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out perfectly! I used a toothpick to make small marble design then I used a knife to make a bolder marble design. I finished it with chocolate icing. 
It's an easy tasty dessert.

I read the reviews before making this cake and was hesitant.  Some reviews were very positive and some were bad.  Having tried the cake I would say this is the worst cake I have ever tried.  It was completely flavorless.  You might as well eat cardboard.  I would say skip this recipe altogether and keep searching.

I really wanted to like this cake... However, it was very dense, it did not rise and the flavor just wasn't there. Needless to say, I could not serve this cake to my party guests in good conscience. I was forced to make my "go to" Black Magic cake, from this site. Everyone loves that cake...

Wonderfully moist without being wet.  The swirls make it truly beautiful.  The cake is so flavorful and attractive that it really doesn't need to be frosted.  Unfrosted it would be excellent paired with a glass of milk or cup of coffee.  I followed the method described by reviewer a.jackson and the cake turned out perfectly.

I had tried this recipe on Friday June 5, 09 and I found out that the way that it was design made the cake look flat. Even with a soft butter. So I tried a different way and I found out that if you mix all your dry (flour, baking poweder, salt, and sugar) and butter in a mixer until it look like crumbs then you can add the liquids (eggs, vanilla, and milk) it gives it a nicer texture and makes it really smooth. Plus the hight will increase if you do it this way

I was making this as a layer cake, for my daughter's birthday so I made it in two batches...the first as an experiment to see if I would like it and how it would turn out. I found it a bit too dry  for my liking (the edge was crumbly), but the taste was good, like an old fashioned wedding cake.  On the second batch (layer) I decided to add 1/4 cup vegetable oil.  That seemed to have "done the trick."  The end result was way better.

I iced the cake with buttercream icing and it was good.

I made this for my dad on Father's Day! He really liked it. We prefer light cakes and not those with 3 sticks of butter! I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup because he doesn't like things too sweet, but it was still very very good. Wait for it to cool down completely and then dig in! It'll be worth the wait. I am making another tomorrow!

This cake is amazing! I made no changes to this recipe but I did mix it properly. You just can't dump everything in and bake. I beat the butter first,then add the sugar,then eggs 1at a time. The flour,salt,and baking powder are mixed together and added alternately with the milk beginning and ending with the flour. If this process is followed you will end up with a moist flavorful cake. I have added chocolate syrup and less unsweetend coco powder to make it more milk chocolate flavor. I always double this recipe to make a 2 layer cake and it always rises beatifully! I've made this 4-5 times in the last month and everyone loves it!

This cake was so delicious. Everyone in my office loved it. It was extremely rich. The only thing I would have done differently is less flour. However, I was also trying to teach one of my friends how to make a cake, and he added the flour, so we can just blame that on him. Haha.

This recipe attracted me because it was so simple; unfortunately I found it needed quite a bit of tweaking.  The cake had a nice texture but the flavor was underwhelming and the marbling did not turn out well - the cake looked more layered than marbled.  I recommend splitting the batter evenly (rather than 1/4 yellow cake and 3/4 chocolate), then adding a bit more vanilla to the yellow batter and a little more cocoa powder to the chocolate batter.  Rather than pouring the yellow batter in the pan first, I would add alternating scoops of yellow and chocolate batter to the pan, to create a nicer marbling effect.  I definitely would not repeat this recipe as-is.

I would add a bit more cocoa, couldn't taste the chocolate cake too much, it was good though and moist.

We really liked this. I used dark cocoa and thought the chocolate flavor was subtle but delicious, kind of like a german chocolate.  I did add the extra 1/4 C of sugar as others suggested and added a bit extra oil and milk. It was a dense cake, but moist.  I should have used a deep dish pie plate because it overflowed -- but the overflow actually baked perfectly and tasted great too!

I decided to make this cake as miniature bundt cupcakes, and thought it was much improved by adding a cream cheese glaze (made like a basic cake glaze, except with cream cheese & sour cream replacing some of the milk). I also crushed some chocolate-covered malted milk balls and sprinkled them on top of the glazed cakes.

Also, I used cake flour, scaled back on it to add a little more sugar and halved the recipe.

Deeeelicious :)!

As other reviews suggested, I added an additional 1/4 C sugar (and thought it could still use a bit more), and also added the melted shortening along with the butter, however I did not add the additional shortening to the cocoa mixture like others suggested - I wish I had.  The cake was pretty dry, very heavy and mild in flavor.  It required too many additions to give it a higher rating.

The best marble cake I ever baked. I baked it few hours ago and I tell you it is moist and the sweetness is just right. I reduced the sugar of course but not much. And I did not use all purpose flour I used unbleached flour and for the chocolate part I did not use cocoa powder instead I use chocolate syrup you know the syrup you use on your ice cream.  OVer all I think the receipi is great though I have to change a little bit of the recepi but it work for me.

I baked this cake last night and it was good!I read all the reviews first and noted that a few said it was dry,not sweet enough and did not rise.However i made this and added 1/4 cup of sugar extra and it was real good.It is not real moist but it was not dry.I think if anyone is experiencing it as dry they are baking it far too long.Over all i will say i will bake this again if i am looking for marble again.real simple to make too!

Fantastic recipe. All I would change is the order you mix the ingredients. Simply I beat the sugar and butter until light and fluffy, added eggs one at a time, added  vanilla, and I gradually added the sifted dry ingredients. No kidding this recipe was just as if I used a box, but better. I highly recomend this as long as you follow the method like I did.

I normally go for easy recipes, requiring less work. This is a perfect marble cake which can be prepared fuss-free. The amount of sweetness is just nice. 
My family loves it. 
This recipe's a definate keeper!!

I doubled this recipe and the cake did not turn out well at all. It came out of the oven with bubbles on top. Once I cut the cake after cooling it, it was too dense and was tasteless as well. Very disappointing.

I made this for my b/f's birthday last weekend and he liked it better than I did. It wasn't my idea of a soft and moist cake. He said it was like cheesecake. I made a double layer and it didn't have the "marble"affect because of doubling everything so I know the next time to use the original amount for the reserve and cocoa fill for the marble affect.

I made this recipe to the "t", but it came out very dry and unflavorful.  There's definitely not enough cocoa powder for the chocolate part, and the ratio of vanilla to chocolate wasn't even.  Also, it was dry and seemed like more of a muffin/biscuit crumb than cake.

I really don't know why this cake even rates 3.5 stars, I followed the directions and even mixed wet ingredients first then followed by dry ingredients and it's very very dense. Don't waste your time or ingredients making this recipe.

I agreee with other reviewers that the cake is dense, but if you are aware of that going in, it's delicious.  If you don't want a dense marble cake, look for a different recipe and stop trying to modify this one to turn it into something it's not.  The first time I made this cake I baked it in a loaf pan (to satisfy my 6 year-old son).  I loved it, he didn't, so I shared it with some of my high school students.  They loved it, too, and asked me to make another one for them.  I just made it again to share with them for the holidays.

I followed the recipe to a t, with the exception of "substituting" cake flour for all-purpose (take out 2 T less per cup of flour and sift again). It was pretty good, but it definitely needs some modifications.  For one, the cake was very dry - if I make it again I'll add half of a pudding mix to it to make it more moist.  I also think the vanilla part of the cake could be more vanilla-y.  After taking out the 3/4 cup for the chocolate, I might add a little more vanilla, too.  I used 2 9" pans to bake so it made a thin layer cake and it took just under 20 min to bake.  Other than that, kudos for being a very easy recipe to make and easily modified.

it was a pretty good cake! i had no problems with moisture or it rising... i did, however, add 3tbsp of sugar to make it slighter sweeter and it turned out being JUST right. the 9-inch pan size is a  little too big for me. i think i'll try 7-inch for a thicker-than-1-inch cake. still a very good recipe!

Awesome Just what I was looking for.  I need a cake to go to my in-laws and I'm tired of them complaining that everything I make is too sweet so I looked at the reviews on all the cakes to find something that people said was more bland.  I made a sample cake and this is perfect.  It isn't super sweet but I don't think it tasts bad at all.  I'm making the real one later today.  We'll see what they say.

I made this cake for my in-laws.  I have always made homemade cakes with much success.  Not to brag, but people look forward to my cakes.  This one, however, looked okay (a couple of cracks in the top), smelled okay, rose okay, but tasted BLAND!  I wanted to crawl under the table.  I followed the recipe and added only 3 T. of vegetable oil to reduce any chance of dryness mentioned by the other reviewers.  I hate to read reviews that say the recipe was great, yet they go on to say that they changed half of the ingredients and technique.  I wanted to try it as close to the original as possible and then see for myself.  I was right on top of the bake time.  I checked it at 30 and it needed an extra few.  I got it right out when the tester was clean.  I never make boxed cakes and have a lot of experience in scratch cakes.  I removed from the 9" pan after sitting 10 minutes.  Everything looked fine, although I could've done without the cracks.  Made homemade chocolate frosting (thank goodness) which added some sweetness, but it was like frosting on a bisquit.  Needs more sugar for SURE!  Although I'm disappointed and embarrassed with this outcome, I will tweak it myself and try it again when I'm not having company.  For starters, I will increase the sugar to 1.5 c. and I will add 1/4 c. of oil or applesauce or maybe even sour cream.  This is a very dense, bland, heavy single layer, but I think it has potential.

This cake was marvelous!  I frosted it with a ganache, and it looked like a pretty torte!  I can only assume errors in technique, and/or perhaps being accustomed to the sweetness/rising height of cake mix cakes attributed to the perceived undesirable outcomes of other reviewers.  A couple of pointers:  use a 9-inch pan; prepare the batter in a true from-scratch method (this isn't a cake mix and shouldn't be treated like one!); start checking the cake early and remove when "just" done.

Well, I'm not a big cake maker.  I read the reviews below and was in two minds.  But I went ahead becaused it seemed so simple - and it was.  Only thing was I used real melted chocolate and a bit more sugar like the previous reviewer.  My daughter and I loved it.

I had no problems with this cake rising - it rose beautifully and is an easy cake to make but still looks impressive. And it tastes great too! I'll definitely be using this recipe a lot.

This cake is so delicious, it's scary.  We used this recipe for my brother's birthday and blew everybody away.  We've made it several times since then, and it only seems to get better.  I like to use a chocolate glaze with it, made out of powdered sugar, cocoa powder and milk.  Thanks a bunch, Carol!

Cake does not rise high at all.  Confusion over term "white sugar" in recipe (was this granulated white sugar or powdered sugar?).  I used granulated white sugar.

The ingredients were about right, but the directions were a little lacking.  

In my large mixing bowl with a stand mixer, I creamed the softened butter, added the sugar, creamed it again, and added the eggs one at a time.  I mixed the vanilla into the milk.  Then, in my mixer, I alternated the dry ingredients with the milk and vanilla, stirring it on the low setting each time.  (This is the traditional way to make a cake, BTW.)

In our family, some people love chocolate.  And some people like vanilla.  And never shall the twain meet.  So I divided the mix in half, added about a 1/3 cup of good cocoa powder (vice 2 TBS) to one bowl, and then poured it into one side of the pan.  I poured the rest in the other half.  So in our case it's not marble, it's half and half.  And my half is chocolatey, because I like it that way and I'm the one making it.  Also, I tasted the chocolate mix and added a bit more milk.  Yes, I risked salmonella.  But it's worth it.  This is a chocolate cake, after all.

This was my first time making marble cake, I knew adding coco powder would not fulfill that chocolate flavour so I melted 2 table spoons of butter and 1/4 cup of milk chocolate chips then stirred 4 tablespoons of the batter with the melted chocolate mixture. I then continued with the recipes directions but I highly recommend melting chocolate to add that extra rich flavour which better devides the 2 flavours of the cake which is kind of the whole point right?! Enjoy ;)

Really liked this recipe. Took advice and added more sugar and oil. I also sifted the flour, baking powder and salt. I alternately added the flour and milk as the final step. A very moist cake and was a hit for my husband's birthday. Will make again.

Jan  2016. Been using the recipe for a few years now.  The new adjustment is to melt 1/4 or so of chocolate chips with a tablespoon of oil to add to the chocolate part.

I was very disapointed in how this cake came out. My husband's loves Marble cake.  For his birthday I thought I could make one from scratch. I looked everywhere online and found this recipe. I figured it would come out good but instead it was very heavy and thick tasting.

Very nice. I used the other suggestions and creamed the butter and sugar first,then added vanilla and eggs,then dry ingredients. Since my family have a slightly sweeter taste I added chocolate chips and a tad more vanilla to the white batter.

11 out of 10. Better than store bought. This was the most idiot proof recipe I've every tried. I've baked before and my bf loves cake so i googled a recipe and based on the photo I chose this one. The instructions were not the best but its pretty straight forward. It was just me my ingredients and a manual whisk- started off with binding unsalted butter and less than a cup of sugar until it was smooth and soft (bout 5 minutes of constant turning), then milk, extract, salt, baking powder, eggs. I added the flour in four parts, then cadbury coca that i added some more sugar to because it was a little bitter and baked for 35 minutes in a sealed oven on the top shelf. I say sealed because based on the comments people were saying it was dry or wasn't great but let me just say now i was shocked with the results, it was moist, it was better than store bought.                             This is my second cake- the first was store bought and it was so sweet but this was just perfect, the texture and taste was sooooo amazing. This was last night and just 1/4 remain because my bf had half last night while it was still hot, and my sisters want me to bake two for my niece's birthday.

Oh and one more thing- the cake shirnk as it cools so u can actually turn it upside down five minutes after and it fell out of the pan with the butter and flour base in the pan.

I tried this spectacular recipe and it was so easy to make! It's taste, so perfect. I decided to make this out of boredom and honestly I glad I did!My dad is a baker and he said it was very well done. Instead of cocoa powder I decided to use up some nutella I had stored away. I think it does the job. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a cup of tea or coffee with some delicious cake after a long day at work. Did I mention it was my first ever cake to bake by myself? I was so surprised and so happy. Thank you ? ? I will be using this recipe again.

I give this a 2 stars because of reviewes regarding it being too dense and having to alter instructions as many suggested by creaming sugar and butter FIRST then adding eggs one at a time. I took this reccomendations and also added yogurt as someone else suggested to help make it more moist. I also added a table spoon of canola oil to ensure its moisture since I was making it for a Baby shower. It was an ok cake. NOt the best but not so bad either. Im glad I read the reviewes and made changes to recipe otherwise I think I would  have been very disapointed had it not been for alterations. I was also wondering if anyone measured the cups in this recipe. Since it says its for an 8 inch cake its supposed to be 6cups. Unless I measured wrong I only got 4 and 1/3cups? I had to make extra as I needed the exact amount. Also anyone have a better recipe they dont mine sharing?

Tasty and Easy - Follow directions recommended by others.  Mixing all ingredients together wouldn't incorporate well in my mind.  Start with the butter and sugar.  Except for the milk, add all other wet ingredients mixing well after each addition.  Mix dry ingredients in another bowl.  Alternate between adding dry and milk to batter.

This cake was very delicious and very easy. Although, it said somewhere that you used an 8 inch pan and somewhere else that you used a 9 inch pan. I used an 8 inch pan and it turned out overcooked on the outside.

I promised my friends a good marble cake and the taste came out great! However, it was a bit dry and I would suggest adding more milk.

This is an excellent recipe that my customers come back for time and time again.  The big difference for me is that I don't just throw all the ingredients in like it says.  I mix the wet and dry separately, mix the butter with the dry and slowing add the wet mix.  People go nuts for it and I think it's a very tastey cake - and I hate marble cake!

I agree with some of the other reviews with the cake being too dry but the flavor was okay.

A wonderful and easy recipe!  I baked it for my brothers B-day and every one enjoyed it.   I did add a 1/4 cup of melted shortening and sugar as suggested by the other reviews.  I also added another 2 tablespoons of cocoa to give a greater chocolate flavor.  This recipe is defiantly a keeper!

those who gave this cake recipe high marks must know something the rest of us don't. Against my better judgement I put everything in the mixing bowl as directed, instead of creaming butter/sugar, beating in eggs, adding flour--as all other cake recipes instruct.  Made this for my daughter's bday.  It was leaden and hard.  So disappointed--she even asked why didn't I use a box mix instead.

I made this recipe and it was a success. My advice is to eat it when it has cooled down. Will definitely make it again but next time will add more chocolate powder as I felt the chocolate flavor wasn't rich enough for my taste. I suggest you do the same if you want to feel the difference between the vanilla and the chocolate.

Very easy to make and came out great. I followed the recipe almost exactly. Only I used brown suger, made the chocolate part about half (made it more chocolatie) added an extra teaspoon coco. Can't wait to try it using all these other suggestions

My 10-year-old son made this and we had no problems with it rising as others had said!  Not extremely 'chocolatey', but if you like good old-fashioned dense cakes, this is a good one.  Goes nicely with a light chocolate frosting.

I made this exactly as written except for adding 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. Then I melted about 1/3 cup of Ghirardelli 60% Bittersweet Chocolate Chips and pored it into the cake after it was in the pie dish. Then baked it about 50 minutes. Soooo good! Whole family loved it.

I used this cake in a big baking project. I made it as both a gluten-free cake, by using a gluten-free equivalent to the flour, and by the recipe. In my opinion, the gluten-free version tasted better fresh, but whatever was weird with the wheat version, it tasted better after it went into the fridge. In case this affects anything, I used a buttercream frosting and topped it with almond flavored homemade sweethearts (found this recipe on YouTube)

The picture is very misleading. It shows a nice level cake. The cake actually came out double the height of the batter. It also took way way longer to cook. I had to keep it in more than 20 minutes longer than the recipe indicated. I would recommend splitting the batter into 2 pans not the 1 that the recipe indicated. It might just cook for the proper time.

After reading reviews of this cake being dense, I took extra precautions to avoid that. even after all of my efforts, this cake was dense, was more like a bread than a cake. Fairly flovorless, and you couldn't tell much of a difference between the flavors, except for the fact that the chocolate part was worse. Definitely will not be making this again.

I've been banking for over 15 years and this was by far the worse cake I've ever made it was very dry and dense, reading the reviews and doing this and that, it still came out dry, dense and very crumbly from being dry, never again, I'll stick to my own recipes.

I substituted coconut oil. I baked too long, as it didn’t turn out as moist as I hoped. It was beautiful at least. We topped it with ice cream to add some moisture.

Terrible. I added extra sugar and butter and used cake flour so the texture was acceotsvle, but this is the most bland cake I’ve ever made, and I make cakes on a near constant basis. I wouldn’t serve it to anyone.

Any baker worth their salt knows you mix your dry ingredients separately and the wet ingredients separately and then incorporate them, so for that I'll say the recipe only gets 3 stars. I read the reviews before making and did as suggested to whip the eggs and sugar really well which made it SUPER fluffy. The flavor was really yummy as well.

Very easy and delicious! I really appreciate how simple this recipe is. I’m using it to make the cake for my son’s baby shower. This is his first baby and I’m honored to make the Baby Boss cake. I made a trial cake to see if everyone would like it. I substituted about 1/2 cup of flour for 1/2 cup vanilla pudding mix and it came out very moist.

Cream the butter and the sugar first, then add room temperature eggs and mix. Add half of the flour (1 cup) than mix while adding half of the mix, add the other cup of flour and mix while adding the other half of the milk. Add the baking powder and when you mix 3/4 cup of the batter with the chocolate powder add 1-2 tablespoons of room temperature milk. Add 1 tablespoon of instant espresso powder to the chocolate mix for extra flavor. Everything else is the same.

The amount of cocoa you put in is way too much, and one of the cakes just never set. It tastes okay, but I probably will make a different recipe next time for the cake I have to make.

Very happy w the results, though instructions need amending. Mix dry ingredients (except sugar) in separate bowl. Cream butter and sugar, then add eggs, wet ingredients and then dry. Also, I made as a 9” layer cake so I used 1.5x recipe, which was easy bc most measurements go from 2 to 3. Cake was moist and handled buttercream frosting well.

This is a great recipe, not dry at all. It needs a little bit of elbow grease, which is what you need for most cakes made from scratch. I beat butter and sugar together first, and then added the eggs one by one. Then I alternated between milk and dry ingredients. I also first mixed the cocoa powder in a little bit of warm water before mixing it in. Absolutely delicious! Will make again!

Honestly this recipe was terrible. I was hesitant going in as the recipe called for reversing creaming which I’m not experienced with, but I followed the advice of a few reviews below and was optimistic. Unfortunately the cake is flavourless, flowery, dense, and honestly just plain gross. Store bought cake mix would have been a million time better.

I found this to be a very dense cake, taste was ok, but too dense.  I think this would of been avoided if I had alternated adding the liquids and the dry ingredients.  It was not a very sweet cake which was fine with me and my family.

Great recipe I doubled the amounts so I can make a  layered cake and it turned nice and spongy . It was lacking a bit in sweetness for my palette so I paired it with some chocolate ganache icing. It went down a right treat!

This is in the oven right now. I changed the servings to 15 and baked in a 9x13 pan. The updated recipe called for 1 1/2 cups of milk, but I added 1 1/4 cups of milk and 1/4 cup of oil.  We'll see!

I made the cake with the exact ingredients listed but followed the directions given by another reviewer.  The cake rose well and came out nice and light  but it was bland and tasteless.  I've seen positive reviews for this cake but most of them say some variation of "this cake is wonderful if I add this or increase that". For me to give a good review the recipe would have to be good as written and this one isn't.  I'm trying out recipes for a wedding cake later in the month and I had planned to bring this one to work today even if it wasn't exactly what I wanted.

I creamed the butter with the sugar as recommended by  other raters.  I also added a drop of rum as recommended on another recipe.  Those were the only changes.  baked it in a bundt cake pan.  It was so delicious! I will make again!!! Oh I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup for health reason...still great! Thanks for sharing!

Made 24 cupcakes instead of one cake and it took 18 minutes to cook in my oven. I agree  with other comments that it is important to cream together the butter and sugar and then add wet ingredients and then finally the dry ingredients.  My cupcakes came out moist and fluffy. Will definitely be making this again!

I just made the batter and thought it rather thick, so I added about 3 tbsp of mayonnaise. The chocolate batter was very thick after adding the cocoa so I added a tad of hot water. The batter tasted great, so we'll see how it turns out.

So this recipe was lovely, and I would definitely recommend it. It is slightly dense, but not to a point of taking away from the taste. I followed the instructions from another comment and mixed the wet ingredients first to get some air in. I made the mistake of doubling the recipe to try to fill a bundt pan, which worked well except for it did squirt out the middle a bit and the center was still a bit gooey, even after nearly doubling the suggested bake time. If you try this, I might suggest raising your oven temp a bit. Otherwise, a tasty cake!

I took the advice of many cake bakers from the reviews section and first mixed butter with sugar and I added 1/4th cup more sugar than the recipe states. I unfortunately don't have an electric beater so all the mixing was done with hands. I added eggs one at a time and then I added the dry ingredients and I poured 1/4th cup of oil and then added the milk. The cake turned out amazing. It is light and fluffy and tastes amazing. My husband loves it.

The cake itself was good, but the batter was difficult to work with when adding the chocolate batter.  Additionally I needed to add an additional 1/2 cup of milk to make the batter more pliable.

I made this cake twice. One as is and one with improvements.
Im giving three stars for the recipe as is. It was kind of bland, and a little oddly dense. I had people eat it and say it was amazing. 
Improvements I made were increasing butter to 3/4 cup, increasing sugar to 1 1/2 cups, increasing vanilla to 2 teaspoons, adding 1 teaspoon almond extract and seperating the eggs whites and folding them in at the end.
Also, I dont believe 3/4 cup is enough batter to use for the chocolate, i used around twice that amount.

This recipe was okay… I used it to make cupcakes instead of cake as an experiment. It tasted really good, but was SO DRY!!! I would suggest doubling the recipe to have a larger batch of cupcakes. The batch I made turned out to be 10 cupcakes.

This recipe is far too dense, tastes funny, not fluffy at all. I made them into cupcakes and the cupcake paper ripped off most of the bottom part.

I followed the recipe to a t and it was good. Family approved. I also liked it but it had the consistency of a muffin rather than cake. I made a double batch. 1 cake was cute by my impatient family and the other one I'll be frosting to see if that completes the taste for me. I'm thinking of adding a bit more sugar, but possibly after I fill and frost, it won't need any more sugar. It came it out nice and fluffy which is usually hard to achieve. I'll be trying this again real soon!!!

This cake was very easy to make. I added a bit more cocoa than in the recipe. It was delicious. Thanks for the recipe! I'll definitely want  to make it again.

This cake turned out terrible, like sweet bread like jiffy corn muffins from a box.  I was trying to give it 1 star but it wouldn't allow me to! It was really dense like a brownie in a not so good way. It wasn't very sweet at all either. I creamed the butter and sugar first added eggs one at a time and added flour and milk alternating and added vanilla. I have never had a cake turn or this way before. Perfect corn muffins for chili, if that's what your going for. Minus the corn meal of course.

Disclaimer - I used a milk substitute (Rice Dream) which may have affected my version.
I found the white part of the cake too heavy. When tasting the batter, I was not thrilled, so I added chocolate chunks (Scharfen-Berger semisweet) one ounce to the chocolate layer. The chocolate part tastes good. I wonder if more egg and/or more baking powder would help with the white cake.  I have just tasted it fresh out of the oven. It may change a bit as it cools.

We did not enjoy this cake. The taste was a bit flat and the texture was too dense, almost like a pound cake.

I just madee this cake last night, it was a 9in roundd pan (2 tiers). I followedd A.Jackson's version... which workedd out really good. The bottom tier of it, I followed the recipes call for 2 tbl. && I found that the mix was really thick, almost pudding like... so for the 2nd tier I cut it in half andd it made the cake less thick. All in all, I'm really pleased with the recipe && I'll be making it for my wedding :)

I should have known from tasting the batter that I wasn't going to like this cake.  I've always made my marble cakes from cake boxes and I think I'll stick with that method.  This cake was pretty bitter and tastes nothing like anything that comes out a cake box.  I like my cakes sweet and rich and this cake is neither.  I'm not going to make it again.

My family asked if I made it with whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour. It was dry and the marble effect didn't do anything for the cake's taste.

WOW this was great. I am an amateur baker and did i pretty good job at this :) If you got a denser mix it was probably because you didn't follow the recipe properly. I made this and my entire family enjoyed it. I would recommend this to anyone.

This cake turned out to be too salty. I made this marble cake for a teacher on the last day of class. I tried to split the batter in half so that my family could also have a cake. So I don't know if that had something to do with it... Otherwise, other than that, it was pretty good.

This cake was alright. Yes it wasn't as sweet as I would have wanted it to be (although I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar) and it rates slighlty low on richness. It is however very light and fluffy and with some chocolate glaze on top, it tasted awesome! I would however look at richer marble cakes and try them out.

Very good cake. Altered a bit that's why Im giving this a 4-star. The first batch I did tasted a bit eggy, so on my 2nd batch, I still used 2 eggs, but one with whites only. I also added about 3 Tbs oil and it made it really moist.

Not a bad tasting cake, but it failed to rise at all.  Flat, like a tasty pancake.

This is a great cake. I made it for my mom for her birthday with a chocolate icing. My dad had some of it and thought it was great. That is like winning and oscar. It is hard to find a cake recipe he likes. Thanks Carol!

I have to say I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I hade to make it twice because 
it cracked across the top like nothing I have ever seen.  The cake was very dry and 
not so tasty.  I will not be making it again.
I makes cakes quite often and have never encountered the problems I did with this one.

This is the first cake I have ever baked and it came out nicely the very first time around! It immediately made me want to know more about baking and, of course, baking more as well. I can only recommend it. This is an easy cake with an easy description and it's tastyyyyy!

Easy and quick but I thought it tasted a bit like a pancake. Won't make it again.

I made this cake for my neice's birtday and it was a huge hit with both the kids and the adults.  A nice light cake.  As a bonus, I topped it with some Chocolate Cheese Frosting and marbled the icing with a little plain cream cheese frosting.  It was quite pretty.
