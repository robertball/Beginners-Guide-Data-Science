I think many of the people who had unfavorable remarks are using the wrong soup.  The recipe does not call for a "cream" soup.  The chicken w/rice is more of a condensed broth.  If you don't like rice, substitute a double dose of Herb-Ox or chicken bouillon cubes in water.  I used thick chops in a double dose of Herb-Ox and added a squirt of prepared mustard.  It was delicious and not dry at all.

I added a can of Cream of Aspargus soup and 1/4 c. raw rice (1/2 c. water), paprika and onion powder. Meat was tender in less than 4 hours. Eight hours is WAY too long for any cut.

I definitely altered this recipe a bit. I preferred cream of mushroom soup to give it a thicker gravy and also added a package of dried onion soup mix. Very tender and tasty.

This was good. I used thin pork chops, and they turned out very tender.  The only thing I didn't like was the overwhelming soup taste.  It tasted like pork chops that had been sitting in chicken soup all day long -- which is exactly what it is! I like the cream of  soup flavor much better.

Absolutely beautiful!  I used Campell's cream of dijon soup, which
went really well with the dry mustard.  Throw in some carrots an
hour before serving and it's a beautiful meal.

After tweaking this basic recipe, I created pork chops that suit our tastes perfectly. First I seasoned the chops with seasoned salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Then I rolled the chops in flour and browned both sides of the meat in the oiled skillet. While the chops were browning I combined the dry mustard with a package of onion soup mix and a 14.5 ounce can of chicken broth (not soup). The chops were tender and perfectly seasoned. Just before serving I removed the pork chops and added a bit of cornstarch the thicken the sauce to create rich gravy. I served this with white rice and green beans and received a thumbs up from everyone at the dinner table. Thank you for sharing.

This a great recipe!!!  The pork chops just melted in our mouths.  My husband loved it. I used cream of chicken instead of chicken and rice soup and it turned out yummy.

Everyone in my family loved this recipe! The chops came out tender and delicious, I added a 1/2 cup of water to the chicken and rice soup and also added some baby carrots the last hour of cooking.

Very good!  I used about 1 1/2 tablespoons of dijon mustard and it turned out great!  Also, I used cream of chicken instead of what the recipe called for! The pork chops were tender and the potato's were excellent!  Thanks for the recipe I will make this again!

Very, very tender. You can cut these with a fork!The chops remind me of a slow cooked pork roast.  For those of you who enjoy a harder pork chop skip this one. I added water to dilute the chicken soup taste and cooked the chops on high for 4 hrs. The flavor was wonderful. I served ours with wild rice and green beans.

Brag worthy, succulent, amazing!  This one is a keeper.  I  made this for my husband's work, as I cater lunch to them once a week.  They were MORE than pleased.  Some said it was the best Pork Chops they had EVER had!  I changed the recipe a bit, simply due to the fact that I did not have all of the necessary ingredients.  But, for the most part followed the recipe.  I dredged the pork chops in seasoned flour (pepper, paprika, salt, garlic) then I browned them in olive oil and placed them in a greased (with pam) crock pot.  Then I added 1 can of chicken with rice soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup (mixed with pepper and garlic).  I cooked on low 8 hrs.  I served the pork chops over wild rice and carrots.  I topped the pork and rice with the "gravy" from the soup mixture in the crock pot.  My husbands co-workers LOVED the gravy and stated they MUST have this meal again soon.  Awesome recipe, and easy too!  Will def. make again SOON!  Thanks!

Brown meat at high heat before adding to the slow cooker adds much flavor and seals in the juices.   Using a cream soup with this recipe I think is better than the rice soup.   I also sliced up an onion and added some crushed garlic to the sauce.  Very good and easy to fix while I am rushing around for work.

My first thought was, chicken with rice soup with pork?  My second thought was, there are plenty of other add a can of mushroom soup recipes, so I used what this recipe called for.  I must say, it was very good.  The broth was very tasty over mushed up baked potato, and it was great to use bread to soak up every last drop.  The only thing I did different, I didn't brown first, because my stove top isnt hooked up yet, so I put my chops in straight from the freezer.

I deliberated rating this recipe since I did things differently. 4 stars due to the condensed  soup ingredient. I just wanted to put out there that I've discovered using 1 or 2 jars (not canned) Pork Gravy, (i.e. Heinz) tastes much better vs canned "whatever" soups. I did tweak the gravy with some dried herbs, crushed garlic, fresh grnd pepper, a little vermouth, etc. I seared 3 pre-seasoned (no flour) 1/2" thick boneless chops in bacon grease. Sliced up 1 sweet onion. Placed 1/2 of onion in first, then chops, then remaining onion. Poured jazzed up gravy over all. Started in crock pot at high for 1 hr & 3 on low. Longer cook time is'nt necessary. Fabulous. You could always add some instant rice (or a pouch of that precooked UncleBens rice) if you want rice incorporated. Adding sliced fresh mushrooms would be good too. I removed chops to thicken sauce/gravy a bit - but all things considered, fairly easy meal to toss together in a slow cooker. This is my rendition using gravy, which is just as convenient but tastier IMHO. Served with mashed taters, baby peas and fresh pineapple slices.

This recipe has been used by my mother in law for more than 35 years.  It was one of my husband's favorites growing up.  He is the fussiest eater alive, so that is saying something.  I will say that I like to prepare this using bone in chops versus boneless and on the stove top versus the crockpot.  Once you add the soup, simmer for an hour or so on very low heat or until falling of the bone tender.

Nothing fancy, but boy did my kids love this one. I doubled the seasoning and used to cans of soup.  The house smelled great all day.  Thanks for sharing this simple recipe.

We have been making this meal for years, except on the stove top, so I wanted to note that it could be prepared that way as well.  The Chicken With Rice soup is important to this recipe, it's not a cream soup recipe.  You cant sub a cream soup and then rate this recipe, the finished products are entirely different.  What we do is:  after browning the chops, usually 8 - 10, we spoon off any excess oil and then add the chicken and rice soup (requires a deep pan with a lid).  We also add a box of Uncle Bens original long grain and wild rice, 2 chicken bouillon cubes, a little more regular rice and only enough water for the rice to absorb that and the broth so that it ends with chops and rice, not really in a soupy base but wet.  Cover and cook until the rice becomes tender (I think it takes about an hour on the stove).  The original recipe might sound like a strange mix, but its really good and the chops come out very tender.

I prepared this yesterday and it turned out very well.  I forgot to buy dry mustard so I used honey mustard to coat the chops before dredging them in the the flour (which I seasoned with garlic and onion powder).  The chops came out tender and the sauce was great.  I actually poured it into a sauce pan and added a little cornstarch (1 tbsp mixed with 1/4 cup water) and reduced it a bit more before serving.  We used it as gravy on our mashed potatoes.  I will be preparing again soon.

This is a definite keeper! Came out of the cooker nice and moist on the inside, and tender enough to cut with a fork. To cut back a bit on the sodium I used Mrs. Dash Table Blend instead of the seasoned salt, and it tasted just fine. Served with peas and carrots and StoveTop stuffing for pork, and it was fantastic, with leftovers for later in the week. Next time I'll try modifying it by using mushroom soup instead of chicken with rice, and maybe also add a drained can of sliced mushrooms as well because my husband and I really like mushrooms.

This is a very easy and tasty meal.  Instead of dry mustard and seasoning salt I used Dijon mustard.  The taste was upscale.  Started with a tablespoon and a bit more to taste.

This was my 1st time with a Crock Pot so I used this recipe and it's reviews as a guide and made changes to suit my taste. First off I brought the recipe down to 2 servings. Then, I sauteed a box of sliced mushrooms, set aside. Carmelized 1/2 a chopped onion and 2 cloves of garlic. Browned the pork chops with a dusting of flour in olive oil. In a bowl I mixed 1 can of cream of mushroom soup with 1/4 c. sherry (NOT the cooking kind), the mushrooms and the onion/garlic, 3/4 tsp. paprika, and 1/4 tsp. thyme, couple twists of fresh pepper. Cooked on low for 5 hours,  served over brown rice with steamed broccoli slaw. Fall off the bone yummy.

Depended on a recipe similiar to this when I began cooking & used my "baby crockpot" because we lived in FL with no AC. :o) I don't fry the chops, always use any "cream of" soup & mix a can of French Onion soup with it. Put a cup of Instant rice in the crock, stir in half of the soup mixture, lay the seasoned chops on top of the rice, pour the remaining soup on top of it & cook on L for 6 to 8 hrs. Toward the end of cooking, I stir the sauce around a bit. Tender pork chops & rice all in one pot. Have done chicken thighs the same way for over 22 years. Can adjust for larger crockpots, also.

This was super easy, especially since I skipped the flouring part. It was on low for nearly 12 hours because we got home late and it was incredible! I will definitely make this again. This is a keeper! :)

Funny I should find this recipe in my e-mail this particular morning. I am   preparing it right at this moment.Yes, I have had this recipe for a long long time, except mine is called Chicken Licken' Pork Chops. This is THE BEST  pork chop recipe ever!!! At my house, it's a family favorite. I usually triple the number of chops and double the flour mixture, that way i have leftovers for the next day or two if I know I'm going to be too busy to cook.

Sorry, but this recipe just didn't do it for us. The chops were tender, but the flavor was lacking..."chops in soup." Was hoping for a little more with the mustard and seasoning, but it still tasted like chops simmered in chicken and rice soup. Thanks anyway.

After reading the reviews, I decided to use both suggestions--a can of cream of chicken and a can of chicken with rice soup. I added carrots (as suggested) and sliced mushrooms, too-- It was DELICIOUS!!! This will be our new standard pork chop recipe!

I had forgotten about this recipe till I ran across it today!  I used this recipe 30 years ago and loved it then.  I will use this again in the very near future.  Great recipe for one of those busy days!

This is one of the easiest, tastiest ways to prepare pork chops. A definite keeper. The pork chops always come out tender and savoury. Served with creamed(whipped) potatoes and a veggie, you have a perfect dinner.

This was delicious! My whole family loves this recipe. I did change a little bit after reading the reviews. I added chicken broth and cream of mushrooms instead of chicken with rice soup. I also added onion, mushrooms, and all kinds of spices. I cooked it for 6 hours. Didn't need a knife to cut it. Excellent!

My family LOVES these pork chops. They are so easy to make, yet they taste like you really fussed. I usually add extra water to dilute the saltiness of the soup, but other than that, I follow the recipe exactly. The sauce thickens up to be almost like gravy, and it tastes great over mashed potatoes. Be sure to try this great recipe!

Actually, browning the meat before slow cooking or roasting allows more of the juices to stay trapped within the meat. As long as you do it properly: at a high temperature and browning all sides (not COOKING through). That's why it has to be a high temperature, so you don't cook the juices out for a dry meat.
The sauce with this dish was a fun change from the BBQ variety every other recipe usually uses.

I actually used 2 cans of the soup to make sure everything was covered because we have a longer oval crockpot. When it was done, the meat fell right off the bones and even my mom, who isn't a very big pork fan, was raving about it. I will definitely make this again.

The pork turned out really tender and delicious.  I made the mistake of not reading the recipe ahead of time, so I didn't have time in the morning to brown the chops.  Instead, I just coated the pork chops in the flour mixture and mixed the rest in with the soup (which I used cream of mushroom since cream of chicken sounded weird to me).  I wasn't sure how it was going to come out, but the sauce came out nice and thick- like a gravy, so I served it with the pork over rice and my hubby loved it!

Served to hungry hockey players and the MMMMM sounds were very rewarding.  Will definitely make again.  I used Campbell's condensed Chicken Soup with White & Wild Rice (less sodium and great presentation!)

ok I originally reviewed this awhile ago and gave it a rating of 3 stars...I have since completely changed all my views on this..firstly I use boneless pork loin chops and I throw in a ton of the dry mustard instead of measuring..then when the chops have been seared, I take the soup and throw it in the pan that I used, getting up all the good flavor bits, then pour it over the chops..I cook them on high about 4 to 5 hours...any longer and they come out tough imo...this recipe has become the only one for me when I cook pork chops...LOVE IT!!!!

This was ok.  I've never made pork chops in the slow cooker before, but it came out too soft and didn't seem like a pork chop at all.  It was more like stewed pork.

This did not turn out.  I didn't brown them first and that might have helped.  They were dry and had very little flavor.  I fried them after I took them out and that didn't help either.  I used Cream of Celery soup and 1/2 cup stock.  Next time, I would just fry the pork chops instead of wasting time getting them right in the crockpot.

Excellent!!!!  I forgot to get this going in the slow cooker, so when I got home from work, I browned the chops, then added the soup and simmered for 1/2 hour.  It was excellent and moist!!  I've never had such luck with pork chops. Yum yum!

I used chicken with rice soup. I skipped the flour and browning part only because my chops were still frozen. I just put them in the crock pot with some s&p and poured the soup on top. It was a good recipe. This was easy and good and will be adding it to rotation.

Very yummy recipe! I changed couple of things. I didn't have any dry mustard so I seasoned pork chops with S&P and basted with regular dijon mustard. I cover them with flour and browned in the skillet for 3 min on each side. After I transfered pork chops into the slow cooker I covered them with mixture of cream of chicken soup, 2 tsp of paprika, 2 tsp of garlic powder, dash of pepper, couple dashes of Worcestershire Sauce and few dashes of A1 sauce just to add some kick to it. I cooked it in slow cooker on Low for about 3 hours. It turned out AMAZING!! My boyfriend who is pretty picky eater, licked his plate clean! Thank you for sharing this one!!

I like to make recipes according to the recipe first, then tweak as needed. I didn't have the soup recommended, so I did as others suggested and used cr. of mushroom. Added a little water, and some brown rice. My family loved it! The rice ended up a little soggy after being in so long, but not bad none-the-less.

Very tender, amazing texture pork....with not much flavor.  I followed the recipe to a "T" so I'm not sure what I did wrong?   Will definitely keep and add some more flavor to it next time!

This was okay but not great.  We thought it was very bland.  The pork chops were very tender.  But it tasted like hospital food.  Not much seasoning.

Really, really don't understand the raves this recipe has gotten - I think those who are raving have made enough modifications that what they make really isn't this recipe.  I followed this recipe exactly - only substituting garlic salt for the seasoning salt, since that's what I had on hand.  This was SO bland.  I couldn't even taste the mustard in the end.  I can see, however, how those who've substituted a cream soup or used actual prepared mustard or otherwise modified it might have gotten something tastier, but this recipes as is - bland, bland, bland!

I made this exactly as written except for the addition of a little garlic and onion powder to the dredging flour.  Cooked for the full 8 hours and they were tender enough to be falling apart.  My husband scarfed them down and thought they were wonderful.  :-)

This turned out pretty good.  They meat pretty much fell apart after cooking on low for 8 hours.  I served it over buttered egg noodles.

I showed the Wegman's butcher the recipe and he said that 4 thick chops would have been done in the slow-cooker in about 3 hours.  I needed something to cook for 8 hours since I was going to work.  He suggested a bone-in roast, got 4.87 lbs, about 5 thick chops.  I did brown the roast and put it bone-side down, using chicken with rice soup.  (I couldn't find Cream of Dijon soup like one reviewer suggested.)  The pork was perfect at 8 hours, I had to cut the chops in the cooker, the bones were falling away.  I honestly couldn't taste the mustard flavor at all.  I served over river rice.  Overall this is a decent mid-week meal for pork, nothing special, however, I would make it again since it was so easy.

I make a modified version of this all the time:  The trick is to use pork country-style ribs (I usually cook about 8, so much more than this recipe notes) and I add enough chicken broth to almost cover all the meat.  It's great over noodles or rice.  When I'm in a stew-mood, I add a few carrots and chopped onions and potatoes.  It's always a hit at our house.

I think I would give this recipe 4.5.  I will definately make it again, although I did make a few changes. I think that browning the meat first was a good idea and enhanced the flavour.  I used cream of chicken soup based on others suggestions and I also added 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp garlic powder, dash pepper and 1 tbsp dijon mustard to the soup before pouring it over the pork chops.  It was very good.

My husband said the same exact thing and I made notes on the recipe card . . .  it melted in his mouth.  I first made this last winter and also used cream of chicken soup.  Saved some of the seaonings and added it to the soup.  Served over rice.  Great busy day meal.

These chops fell apart in our mouths.  I made a couple of small variations to the recipe to make it low-fat (low fat cream of chicken soup & skipped browning in oil, served each serving over 1 cup rice) and can guarantee that it will be a family favorite!

Perfect thing to throw together on a day you know is going to be busy, or even later that night once you get home in the pan. (We didn't use a slow cooker!) Got two really thick Husker Chops and breaded them in whole wheat flour--pan fried lightly on each side until browned. Poured the soup in pan and let it simmer for almost 2-hours. Just the right amount of rice with a natural au jus (from the soup) for the pork. Served with a side of fresh brocolli.

This is good. I followed the recipe, except did mine on top of the stove, simmered about 3 hours on lowest setting. The meat was so tender it fell apart and it tasted good. Not my favorite way to fix pork chops, but it was good.

This was the BEST pork chops that I have EVER tasted. (Dont tell my mom. hehe) I had cooked this last Sunday (morning) and by the afternoon, my apartment smelled like I had cooked an entire feast. Sometimes when I cook in my crock pot (a southern term for "slow cooker"),the food may smell good but taste ok. NOT this. It smelled GREAT and the food tasted BETTER.     I think that I am going to make this tomorrow. ..My mouth is watering from the thought. :-D

I agree with ERYAN50. 8 hours is too long. I cooked them on high for about 2 hours and then on low for another hour and 1/2 and the pork chops were very tender. Another change I made: I poured all the remaining flour mixture into the pan while browning the pork chops, and after browning I poured the oil & flour mix into the crock pot with the pork chops and soup. This results in a thick gravy which was pretty tasty.

Best pork chops I've ever had!  I didn't bread them, because I thought it would be a pointless waste of time.  But, I did brown them on the stove with salt, pepper and garlic powder before putting them in the crock pot.  I did 6 chops with the bone and 10 small chops without the bone and 1 large can of chicken and rice soup and half of a can of water (I was feeding six).  They cooked all day (about 9 hrs.) and they were so perfect!

This is a wonderfully easy recipe that ends up tasting like a pork roast. I needed a Sunday dinner that could cook while we were out.  This was perfect. I didn't have chicken with rice soup so I used 14oz can of chicken buillion and 2 instant low sodium packets of chicken boullion and added 1/2 package of dry onion soup mix. I also added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder.  Added baby carrots an hour before it was finished and it turned out wonderful.

This was a good recipe.  I followed the recipe as outlined only I used boneless pork loin instead of what the recipe called for.  The flavor and aroma were wonderful.  I cooked it for 8 hours, but amazingly my meat came out a little dry.  My family loved it except for the dryness of the meat.  I made the gravy as others have suggested and it was great.  Will try again, only will try and use meat that has a bone to try and prevent the meat from being dry.

I was VERY skeptical of this recipe.  The only reason I chose it was I needed a slow cooker meal and my husband was tired of beef roast (and loves pork chops).  I made it exactly as the directions stated.  Even while it was cooking I was thinking...this is not going to be good.  BUT, it was awesome.  And I am no fan to pork chops.  I think letting it cook the entire 8 hours is what takes it from dry meat and chicken soup to falling apart tender in gravy.  It's easy, different, and a keeper for sure.

My Family is not big into Sauerkraut but they loved this recipe.
I added 1/2 bottle of beer with the brown sugar and potatoes.  The pork fell apart it was so juicy.
This one is a keeper!

Nope. Good, but not a repeat. I agree with other reviewers.  This is like ricey gravy.  I served this over extra rice becuase it was so soup like.  I did add an extra 1/2 cup water or it would have burned in the slow cooker.

These were very tender and juicy, but I have to agree with another reviewer who said that it just had a chicken soup-y flavor. The flavor was just okay. It would probably work better with a creamier, thicker soup.

This may have gotten the best reaction from my husband of any dish I have ever prepared.  I found pork cube steaks, so I used those instead of chops.  The magic is in the seasoning; mustard made it wonderful!   I did sub cream of chicken soup, since that's what I keep on hand, but it made a fantastic sauce for rice.  My husband is starting to make dangerous comments like "this is as good as Mom's" when I prepare meals like these.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

The best slow cooker recipe for pork chops EVER! I had some mushroom leftover from another recipe and I tossed those in a buttered slow cooker. On top of that I put the four large thick pork chops after preparing them as instructed. I poured the soup on top and set the cooker for 10 hours. The chops were done in four. Scrumptious!!!!

This has been our family's favorite way to prepare pork chops for over thirty years with the exception of adding 1/2 tsp garlic powder instead of the seasoning salt.  So tender and delicious!

First time I made this it was tasty but kinda dry.  I think this is because my crockpot is so large the soup didn't cover the chops.  Second time I used two cans to ensure coverage and cooked the entire time.  Delicious. Meet was falling apart.  Second time I also put chops in ziplock bag, easier to coat.

I loved this recipe.  For an even more tasty recipe, add sauteed green peppers and onions. I also added a few sprinkles of the leftover seasoned flour to the crock pot (couldn't bear wasting so much).  The result was fantastic!

This was an awesome recipe.  I did tweak it a little and made it my own, but it still turned out wonderful.  My tweak just added onion sliced and laid on the bottom of the slow cooker and then using cream of chicken instead of chicken and rice soup.  The changes worked well and the chops turned out so tender.  I will definitely be adding this to my recipe book.  =)

Great recipe! I made this for our Christmas Eve dinner and it was a hit! I used prepared mustard  and cream of mushroom soup. Also, I just simmered everything in a deep frying pan with the lid on. They turned out super moist and yum, yum yummy! I got lots of compliments!

The pork chops were great!  My husband really loved them and he is not always a fan of other pork chop recipes I've tried in the slow cooker.  I followed the recipe exactly, except to save time before going to work, I coated the pork chops the night before and kept in the refrigerator and in the morning I did the rest and they were wonderful.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I enjoyed these pork chops...very moist with a "comfort food" taste.  Next time, I might try a larger can of soup. I had to add water several times.  I am looking forward to making these again!

These were the best pork chops we've had in a long time!  My 10 yr old Son had 4 servings! They were so moist, and the meat fell right off the bone.  My crock pot gets very hot, so I added a can of water along with the soup.  We also made the rice separately instead of using Chicken with Rice soup.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was great!  I have never been able to cook pork chops well but these were so good!  I didn't have the right soup so I used 1 cup of chicken stock and one can of cream of celery soup.  The gravy it made was wonderful and I served it all over noodles.  Everyone loved it!  Will definatly make again!

Not as great as it sounds. Edible, as any pork in the slow cooker turns tender after 8h, but the mustard really did not come through - 1 tsp in 1/2 cup of flour, and most of it is left in the pan. Certainly easy enough to make, but I see no point to browning the pork with the flour coating first, might as well just throw in the pot. I am not sure the chicken rice soup worked that well either.

I had a pork tenderloin so I dredged the meat in the flour and seasoning before browning it on all sides. Next, I put it in the crockpot and even though I didn't understand the the chicken and rice soup, I used it anyway and I'm glad I did!  I added the extra broth and added some more of the seasoning that I used in the flour mixture.  I served with with rice and fresh greenbeans and my husband and 5-year-old had no complaints.

The pork chops came out of the slow cooker so tender! My family loved them. I did change out the soup only because I didn't have what the recipe called for. I used Cream of Chicken with Herbs and I cooked it on high for 4 1/2 hours because I didn't have enough time. They were still great and the gravy came out perfect for spooning over the stuffing.

very easy. I used the flour and dry mustard, and then added paprika, salt, pepper, and some garlic powder. I did not brown them in pan, just put them in the slow cooker and covered with cream of mushroom soup.  Cooked for 8 hours. I added some frozen onion to the crock pot as well.  They were very tender and tasty!

I browned the pork chops, per the recipe, but then I added two cans of chicken with rice soup (the broth based version, not the cream) plus a cup of water, and it was a complete meal in itself.  Very flavorful and tasty.

The chops were tough & the flavor was just plain bad, as if the slow cooking enhanced the taste of the artificial ingredients in the soup.  Definitely not worth even modifying.  Not all oldies are goodies.

I made the pork chops exactly as the recipe called for. The used thick, boneless chops and they were wonderfully tender and perfectly cooked - the meat practically fell apart. The dish was good, however, I couldn't taste any mustard flavoring at all. Also, the chicken and rice soup didn't really do anything for me - you could also substitute cream of chicken or just cream of mushroom. I will never cook pork chops any other way but in the slow cooker!

i rate this 5 stars with the dijon and cream of chicken.  I like when meat falls off the bone.  Awesome!   I served it over egg noodles and spooned the sauce on them.

Per other reviews, I used a can of cream of chicken soup and added a couple TBLS of dijon mustard as well as 1/3 cup water (as I used 6 chops instead of 4). They were tender and tasty but a little too salty (I did not add any salt at any time during the cooking process). Maybe use a lower sodium soup?  I liked the ease of this recipe and the taste wasn't bad but the salt was overwhelming. Still, I may try this again. Thanks Jan.

Really good. A different way to prepare pork chops. I will make this again. By the way, I think some on here who are complaining about how the chops come out tasting like soup rather than pork should know that the recipe as written calls for THICK pork chops, which can soak up the juices AND retain the flavor of pork. Substituting thin cut chops, which cannot retain any pork flavor when floating in a can of soup,isn't a reason to give the recipe a mediocre rating as if it was a bad recipe.

This recipe was delicious. Nothing fancy, just comfort food. 
I seasoned my pork chops prior to dredging in the flour mixture to give the meat some flavor.  I used a large family-sized can of soup and cooked on low for 6 hours. Meat was fall-off-the-bone tender.  We had family visiting and everyone liked the dish and got seconds.

This is the first meat dish I have ever made - I am a vegetarian but wanted to make something special for my hubby.  He gave it five stars (and trust me, he is an honest and tough critic)...I made the following changes:  used 1 can chicken broth instead of soup, added pepper to the flour mixture, did not trim the fat from the bone-in pork chops I used, used the dry mustard but also added some regular mustard to the broth, and added chopped carrots and onions the last hour of cooking.  Four hours on low and they were perfect (according to my husband and his meat-eating friends).

It was ok, but not sure I want to do it again. Maybe with a different soup? Does not need to cook for 8 hours though. Could probably take it  out at 6

The whole family loved it.  I used 8 thick cut boneless pork loin chops and three cans of soup.  I also added to garlic cloves that I just smashed and put int the slow cooker with the liquid to infuse the garlic flavor.  The whole family loved it!  My 5 year old son cleaned his plate!

This wasn't as good as I'd hoped.  I like to use cream soups in the crock pot but have never used a broth soup before.  The dish ended up tasting processed, like chicken and rice soup you could eat with a fork.  I won't be making this again.

My husband loved this recipe.  The only thing I did different was I bought consendsed chicken with wild rice soup that was reduced sodium (I couldn't find the other kind) and I added 2 cans knowing my husband likes extra juice.  It was okay for me, but I don't like slow cooker recipes very often.  I will make again though!

I had to spice it up a bit, but this is a great recipe.  It is very simple.  I added some seasoning to the flour.  After browning, I sauteed onion and garlic in the pan and put the rice in  with chicken broth and bouillon.  I thickened up some more chicken broth with the leftover flour.  Excellent!!!  Not bland at all.

great recipe - I used a can of cream of celery soup (didn't have the chicken/rice) and also added some garlic powder and 1 tbsp. dijon mustard to the soup in slow cooker after browning.  Best pork chops ever - SOOO tender!

This looked really good so i decided to give it a try. As usual i read all of the comments and suggestions to see what soups,spices i wanted to combine etc. I have to admit it didn't smell very good at all but, it was so good my husband made me make it twice this week. Four hours is plenty of time for the meat to come out tender but, you can do it either way.

I made this for my family today, my oldest granddaughter had her mind made up that because of the looks she didn't like it, but I asked her to try it, the next question was grandma will you make this again.  I too used cream soup and added a little chicken boullion because that's all I had on hand, and I didn't cook it as long because I didn't have THICK pork chops, all of my family enjoyed it. Very Very good!

Very easy, my family loved it. Found I didn't have dry mustard so used dijon mixed in the soup instead. Worked great. I like the broth of the chicken/rice soup instead of another cream based soup. It was lighter and had a nice flavor. Will definitely make again - very easy. Even browning the chops before putting them in the slow cooker was not a big deal and I think sealed in the flavor.

This recipe was well-received at my house.  After his first bite, my 5 year old requested that I make it the next night too!  I used a large can of Chicken and Rice Soup and added 1 TBSP of Grey Poupon to the soup before pouring over the pork chops.  I also added baby carrots and cooked on Low for approx 6 hours.

This was very good and so easy. I've made it twice and doubled the recipe both times and our family of five eats every last bite. The last time I cooked it I only had one can of chicken and rice soup so I added it along with a cream of chicken with herbs and that was also very tasty but needed more rice. The pork chops were so tender I'll only cook them in my slow cooker from now on. Thank you for this recipe!

I made this as written & it was perfect!  The pork chops were SO tender.  I also added a couple of chicken tenders I needed to cook up and they were great too.  I found it made quite a bit of sauce w/ just the one can of soup and I will definately make rice next time to soak up the great sauce.

These tasted good, but were not asethetically pleasing at all...I used the 1/4 rice, 1/2 cup water and cream of chicken soup, so I am guessing that my variation of the recipe is WHY it didn't look very pretty..no matter though, it was enjoyed by the whole family!

Like another rater said "a solid four out of five".  This came out very well.  Used thick boneless loin chops.  I added garlic powder and black pepper to the the flour coating and browning them was easy.  Put one can of cream of mushroom soup in the crock and then filled the can twice with chicken broth.  Put in pork chops and the remainder of the flour mixture to season and thicken sauce.  Cooked for two hours on high and two hours on low, which resulted in a firm moist chop.  A "fall apart" chop would probably need another hour or two.  This gravy was very good with the chops and a rice pilaf mix on the side (cooked with chicken broth and water).  No problems whatsoever with this method and I'll make again because my two year old really liked it as well.

I usually cook pork in the oven and you have to saw it with a knife to cut it, but this pork was fork flaky. Easy, simple, and a good flavor. I will definately keep this under one of my favorites.

For something as simple to make as this, I have to give it a solid 4 of 5 stars. I used a half cup of water in mine to prevent it from burning or overcooking and I'm glad I did... the pork was fork tender and very tasty.

It's like ricey gravy, but it is good.  And for an added kick, try chicken gumbo soup instead of plain chicken rice soup.

I changed this so much based on the other posts that it is probably not the same recipe anymore.  I doubled the soup, added spicy mustard and the left over flour to get it to thicken into a soupy gravy.  The pork was fall-apart tender and very tasty.  Next time, I don't think I'll bother with the pan frying part, as the breading falls off and it doesn't seem to need it.  Served over wild rice, but I think I'll do it with potatoes next time.

All in all, a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe Jan.

We enjoyed this very much.  I shared the leftovers with my son and some of his friends and they were fighting over who was going to eat it.  The only thing I changed was I used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of the soup.  Will make this again for sure, with enough to share.  Thanks

These turned into something that resembled a really thick stew.  The flavor was good, but I was expecting pork chops.  I couldn't even lift them out of the crock pot without them falling apart.  Not a bad recipe, just not what I expected.

I used cream of broccoli soup and Italian seasonings instead of mustard (I thought I had some but didn't). It turned out very tender and moist. We were happy with the results.

This was easy and delicious.  My family is not crazy about rice, I used chicken & stars soup and a can of chicken broth (since I was cooking more than 4 chops.)  Great recipe!

I thought this was great!  I fast forwarded through the browning process and used thin frozen pork chops.  They turned out very nicely.  I will definitely make this again!

We loved this recipe. I had 2 big boneless pork chops, I browned them first and placed them on a sliced onion in the slow cooker. I used beefy mushroom soup and added mushrooms an hour before the pork was cooked .We don't like mushy meat so I cooked them for 4 hours on slow and they were tender, juicy and able to be sliced. I will cook these again and maybe use French onion soup.

The loin was unpleasantly dry. If I ever make it again, I will definitely use low- or low-sodium condensed soup, and probably not trim off the fat.

So easy and so delicious. I used gluten free flour when coating, and an organic gluten free cream of chicken soup. Served over rice. Family favorite. I will make this often.

It smelled like chicken and rice soup the whole time it was cooking and tastes just like that..totally chicken and rice soup. My thick chops were very tender, but the soup taste took away from any spice and any pork flavor. I won't make this again :(

I make this a few times a year but I really don't follow this recipe anymore.  I season, flower and brown 6 - 8 thin chops but omit the dry mustard.  I mix (2) cans of cream of chicken soup, 1 cup milk and (3) tablespoons of Dijon mustard.  Put it all in the slow cooker on low for 6 to 8 hours and serve over Jasmine rice.  It makes a lot of extra sauce to pour over the rice.  I only rate this a (4) star meal because it's so simple.....but we love it!

This looked really awful. It was pretty lumpy. Only my boyfriend ate it. He tells me the pork turned out really tender.  I'm not sure if I'd ever make this again.  If I do I'll add water to make it a little less...chunky.

Awesome recipe! I was trying stuff that I can make in the slow cooker, and this was perfect. didnt have a can of chicken noodle soup with rice, only a package, so I used the broth of that and half the amount of water. And it still turned out good. Just made rice on the side. YUM!

Okay, let's try this again...

I liked this recipe.  I only had a dash of dry mustard so I subbed in curry powder and added mixed veggies just before the end.  The meat was tender and the gravy was great over rice.  Everybody loved it - and we'll definitely make this again.

Very easy, I too added a 2nd can of cream of chicken.  Couldn't find cream of chicken rice at the store.  Thought it was a little salty. But really made moist, tender pork chops.

Excellent.  I added one can of cream of chicken in addition to the can of chicken with rice.  I wanted to make sure I had enough sauce to spoon over rice.  Also sprinkled Emeril's essence over the pork chops.  Great meal!!

i think this would have been soooo much better if i had used thick pork chops like the recipe called for, but i used the thin cuts with bone in.  it had a great flavor, though.  i will try again with the thick cut next time.

Not bad, but I would have liked more sauce to spoon over egg noodles or rice.

Tasty and easy, but the pork chops were dry. I think a shorter cooking time would prevent them from drying out.

The pork chops tasted very good, but the chicken soup made a very thick and unappetising sauce.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it was wonderful.  We all loved it.  I would say that if there is any complaint to be found, it is that it is a little bit salty, but not too bad.  Recipes don't come much simpler than this one.  Thanks, Jan!

The pork chops were wonderfully tender, but the recipe needed some pepper and even a little onion in my opinion. With those things added, this would be much better.

This recipe was pretty good. I'd like to try it with pork chops that aren't thick. I used thick boneless chops and we aren't crazy about that kind.

This was great! A must try. At the end I removed the pork chops, stirred in some cooked rice and served. Family loved it. Thanks a bunch!
