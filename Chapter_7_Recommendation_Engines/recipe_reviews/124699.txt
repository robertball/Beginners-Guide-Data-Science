A wonderful ham loaf. I have tried many but the glaze makes it. The loaf is fairly standard (I only added chopped green pepper) and I like the combination of pork and ham. The glaze is wonderful. I made two loaves and froze one. Make sure you baste it three or four times. I used the thermometer and 170 was perfect. A little under 1 1/2 hours.

I have been making my mother's ham loaf recipe for 40 years and thought it was the best until I tried this.  It is fantastic, and the sauce makes it!  There is just my husband and I so I made two smaller loaves, reduced the cooking time by 20 min., and froze the extra one for another meal (which might be real soon!)

Never heard of a hamloaf before this. I had leftover ham to use up so I made this. The only change I made is used 1lb maple sausage. My father and husband loved it.Good thing, we've been having leftovers for three days.

This loaf is great,the only change I made was that I was out of crackers so I used Panko bread crumbs instead.
My wife was a real skeptic when I started this meal and she went back for seconds.
Thanks for submitting this easy recipe!!

I was looking for a ham loaf recipe to compare to the ham loaf we get at the Amish Farm Market and this is definately it!  I had no leftovers.  Everyone just loved it and begged me to make it again!

Best ham loaf ever.  I'd been searching for what all the rest are missing...it's the pineapple.  It makes it taste like candy, which is a good thing.  And I don't even like pineapple but it gives it that perfect flavor.  The only thing different I do is use an already mixed ham loaf mixture that my local grocery store makes instead of the two individual meats.  Try it, you'll love it!

Originial review:  I had to use the Town House Flipside crackers (half cracker, half pretzel) as that was all I had on hand at the time.  This recipe didn't specify a vinegar and all I had was balsamic.  I thought it would be too strong, so used less than the 1/3 cup.  It worked very well.  It came out perfectly delicious.  It was a HUGE hit and I will definitely be making it again!

Updated review (1/1/2015):  Have made this recipe several times since I first tried it.  I've followed the recipe verbatim, and it was delicious.  I've also had to make slight changes, based on what I've had on hand, and it's been great every time.   I've used bread crumbs, oatmeal, or crushed croutons when I didn't have crackers.  I've tweaked the glaze by making it more of a honey mustard.  I've added ginger and soy sauce to give it an asian feel.   

The fact that it's great as-is, as well as it being easily adapted, makes it a 5-star keeper in my book!!!

I made this dish last night as is.  I did not change or add a thing and it was delicious.  The sauce is the star and should not be avoided.  It is well worth the calories.

Loved this I have always frowned on Ham loaf never thought I would even think of making something like this! This was delicous, so much that I finally decided to rate it and post something about it! The whole family loved it I did make a few changes I added minced onions and a jalepeno pepper and instead of using milk I used the juice from my Thanksgiving ham and instead of pork I used venison sausage! I did double the sauce as I read some said that it needed it and I only had a 20oz can of pineapple and did not want to save it for something else. I did not need to double it and when I make this again I will not double it no need too! I will find a recipe for the rest of the pineapple!! Again this was really good Thanks for sharing it!~

This was delicious.  I am not a Ham Loaf lover.  My husband bought one and I didn't know what to do with it.  I found this recipe and he ate half of a 1 1/2 pound loaf!!!  I tried it after he devoured it.  It was very good!  Thanks Doris!

Delicious!  Does need a bit more sauce than called for in the recipe.  I used all ham because I didn't have ground pork on hand, and we were in the middle of a snow storm here in Maine!

Very good Recipe, I didn't change a thing, but I might recommend you 1 1/2 the sauce or maybe even double it as I like to baste the slices on my plate and I was running out of sauce.  I also added some pineapple rings towards the end of baking just cause I like pineapple.

Used all ham no pork. Served with bisquits, asparagus, broccoli, and a salad. Served again this time with ham and pork. Still delicious. Served with cornbread.

Have made this twice, the second time with fresh pinapple instead of canned.  With canned it's 4 stars, with fresh, the flavor increases remarkably.

This was a little trouble as I had to grind my own cooked ham for this recipe. It makes a large loaf and the glaze definetly makes it.

I've made this a few times and it has been a big hit with my family.  In fact, it is so good I made it today as the centerpiece of our Easter meal!  The guests loved it and it turned out perfectly.  I followed the recipe as stated and it was mouthwatering!  The first time I made it I was a little unsure about the ground ham aspect of it, since I didn't have a meat grinder.  My mother in law used her food processor to chop up the ham for me and it has worked like a charm.
