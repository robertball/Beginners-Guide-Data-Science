Absolutely Devine!! I did not have any sweet onions, I used a finely chopped yellow onion and it still turned out very nice :)

I made it for a party, and there were a few left over. I ate them the day after cold - nice :)

Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly and they were delicious! I made them for an all girl party to celebrate my sister finishing chemo therapy. Everyone loved them and they were gone in a flash!

I had high hopes for this but we were disappointed in the end.  They look pretty but the taste is just not quite there.  The flavor of the soup was too prevalent. I also think they need something to thicken them a bit to improve the texture.  As it was they were a bit too "soupy" all the way around for our taste.

Even though these are always the first things to disappear on the buffet these tarts are too good  and to easy to save for company. Wonderful in the extreme. Close your eyes and savor the flavor. Yummy!

I took these to a party and they were a hit.  I didn't have asparagus, so I used broccoli.  After reading reviews about this being soupy, I added 2 eggs to the mix and they were perfect.
