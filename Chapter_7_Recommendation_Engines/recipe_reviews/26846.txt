This is a very simple delicious recipe. I made it for a family bridal shower and came home without any leftover. I added a little more horseradish and onion. The flavor gets stronger the longer you leave it.

This is a phenomenal recipe. I find it hard to get canned Lobster so I revert to frozen whole or just the tail. My guests inhale this one. Be careful not to add extra horseradish as it will overpower the lobster taste. It's a lot easier to add ingredients than take them out.

I used fresh lobster rather than canned.  The ingredients are subtle, enhancing rather than covering the flavor of the lobster.  I may add a little more horseradish next time due to my preference for strong flavors, but my husband and I loved it.  This recipe is definitely a keeper for special occassions!

Be sure to make this a day ahead so the flavours can intensify.  I used 11 oz. of lobster since that's what came in the can of frozen lobster I bought from Costco.  I squeezed the water out of each piece with paper towels since it was a bit wet.  Next time I'd like to try this with fresh lobster.  Also, I'd cut the lobster pieces slightly larger (more recognizable) and add them to the cream cheese mixture after it's mixed.  Less breakage that way.  This dip was a hit and I'll make it again.

Oh, my word, was this good.  I used fresh lobster meat and left some of it a little chunkier than the rest.  I reduced the amount of onion to only about a teaspoon and added just a teeny bit of chopped chives for some contrast.  I also cut back a little on the lemon as well - I wanted to minimally enhance the lobster flavor and didn't want to take the chance of masking it in the least.  I never would have thought to combine lobster and horseradish (I tend to like mine strictly with drawn butter) but I found it not only creative, but very tasty as well.

Surprised this did not wow me since it had such high reviews.  Needs some doctoring up, as in leave out the butter, definitely either more fresh lobster instead of canned, or less cream cheese, a couple dashes of old bay seasoning, a scant squirt of ketchup, a dash of cayenne, and clove of minced garlic, for more complexity.  Otherwise, the original recipe tasted to me like seasoned creamed cheese with lobster bits.

I tend to be a purist when it comes to lobster; let's face it, it only needs a bit of butter to be perfect.  I had some leftover fresh lobster, (at $4.99 a pound we bought one too many lobsters) and decided to try this recipe to serve at a meeting.  I used only about half the amount of cream cheese and butter that was called for but left everything else pretty much as written.  I made this a day ahead and thought that the flavor was better the second day.  Very Good!

This dip was a huge hit with everyone over watching the football game, it was gone way before halftime.  We did use more horseradish,added a garic clove and served it on thin slices of french bread

I just made this and it was very good. I omitted the butter, because I didn't see the need for it, since it already has the creamed cheese. I also, increased the onions and horseradish, used 1/3 less fat cream cheese. I really enjoyed this. Had it on crackers and I'm thinking that it I left the lobster in large pieces, it would be great as a lobster roll.

This is very similar to one of our family's recipes.  Substitute 3 tablespoons of ketchup for the butter.  It tastes better and it is a lot more healthy.  I only use 1 teaspoon of horseradish as well.

Delicious!  I used (4) chicken lobsters, tails and claws, rather than the canned meat.  I served it with rounds of French bread, toasted  on a cookie sheet for a few minutes in the oven.  A big hit on Thanksgiving, and serving it cold kept the ovens free for the "real" dinner.

Used light cream cheese, cut down on butter to 2 TBSP and horseradish to 1/2 TBSP. and used 8.5 oz of lobster meat. This recipe was excellent.

Loved this recipe.  I made this for a football party and everyone loved the taste and fun presentation.  I made as written, but did add a bit more horseradish, some tabasco, and Old Bay.  Also added a few tablespoons of milk to make a smoother consistency. Served with Old Bay flavored potato chips, what a decadent snack! Thanks for your recco, Lucky Noodles, and thanks for sharing your recipe with AR chef-girl-dee!

This was greatly enjoyed by all!  My husband came home from the store with Langostino instead of lobster, but it was still great.  A substitution of hot sauce for the horseradish worked well, as did half sour cream for part of the cream cheese.  2 TBSP of butter seemed to be plenty. I heated all of the ingredients on the stove until the cheese and butter were melted, then let it cool.   I used a stick blender for just a few pulses for the final blending, and the result was a nice semi-chunky dip.  Thank you for a good standby appetizer!

I had a bad feeling about this dip but didn't listen to myself. It wasn't horrible it just was tastless. It could have been my lobster's fault but I don't think so. I used a little over 8oz of fresh lobster tail meat and even added a clove of minced garlic and some old bay. I made it the day before so the flavor would intensify but it didn't. My guests ate it but I have had other dips that got devoured. I'm just thankful I only had to throw out a small amount that was left over. Next time I will trust in my instinct!

I made this for my husband's staff party last year and it was a hit. I used rice crackers to use with it due to food concerns for other employees....went over extremely well. Not a morsel was left. Will be making it for my staff party. This is definitely a keeper.

This dip has the texture of a spread, i.e., it was a bit too thick to dip into.  It also has a subtle lobster flavor even though I used the meat of the tail and the two claws of the market sized lobster I'd steamed.  Definitely don't add more horseradish than recommended; the lobster flavor will be lost.  Overall, this "dip" wasn't as tasty as I'd hoped.

i thought this was okay, but not great. think it really needed something to jazzy it up. i tried some cheese on top and baked it, and i thought that helped. going to keep looking for a better recipe.

This was fantastic!!!  I used lobster flavoured pollock chopped really fine and added slightly less horseradish (since lots of reviewers suggested it) and it was gone super fast.  Will make again and again.

I added about 1/2 the amount of horseradish but added a small amount of hot sauce (tabasco).  Be careful not to spice it up too much, or you will overpower the lobster.  Very good and easy.

Made as directed and it was a huge hit.  Used a hand blender to mix ingredients, except lobster, first and then added the lobster. I used fresh lobster.  Would make again!

This recipe was delicious.  I made small changes after perusing the other reviews, but only adjustments in ingredient quantity (i.e. bit more lemon juice, less cream cheese, fresh lobster). Definitely a keeper! Thank you.

Sorry, I have to agree with many of the other reviews.  This lacked flavor.  I went back and added a pinch of essence of emril and some cocktail sauce to jazz it up a bit which helped somewhat

This is amazing!  Don't be worried when you first mix it up, it needs time for the flavours to mellow.  My husband brought home 2 small fresh steamed lobsters and I used the tail and claws. Yum-Yum  Expensive but worth it for special occassions!

This was excellent but I did add a little banana pepper to add a little more flavor and spice!

I made this for our family reunion. I live in Maine, so I used knuckle and claw meat from our local deli. I increased the onion to 3 Tbl or so because we like it heavy and used 8oz of lobster. Everything else was followed exactly. It was delicious. I will be making this again!

Made a small test batch for 2 people. Very tastey, nice little tangy flavor. Served it same day, it was good. But it was a bit better the next day.

Definitely need to use real lobster not canned. I added boiled shrimp and a little extra garlic and onion than the recipe called for. It was a big hit and hardly any leftover.

I made it.  I changed it up a little, which I normally do to recipes.  I did half mayonnaise and half cream cheese.  I used wasabi instead of horseradish.  I put white sticky rice in a bowl and put dip on top and heated in microwave for 2 minutes and added a little shoyu (soy) sauce.  So ono!  In Hawaiian this means really, really good.

Good with following tweaks others have recommended: leave out the butter, definitely either more fresh lobster instead of canned, or less cream cheese, a couple dashes of old bay seasoning, a scant squirt of ketchup, a dash of cayenne, and clove of minced garlic, for more complexity.

Awesome recipe-so quick and easy to make. Used a little more(fresh)lobster than what it called for because some suggested that flavor was a little bland. Also used more onion and a little garlic. Printed recipe and shared with everyone cuz they all loved it!

Used 2 steamed lobster tails and added green onions, but would cut down on butter and cream cheese next time.

Very Yummy!  I don't think I used enough lobster, though, I couldn't find canned lobster, so I used chunks of frozen lobster tails.  Next time, I will add more.  Very easy and very yummy!  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!
