These were actually pretty good. Quick and easy to make.  I subbed sour cream for the yogurt because that's what I had. The batter was rather thick and I was worried they would not bake but they did. Baking time was about 19 minutes and I only got 6 cupcakes instead of 8.

The title is a little misleading. It is not like the texture of a pumpkin pie, it is a cake- a cupcake. That being said, it turned out good and was tasty.  I did add more cinnamon and spices like ginger and cloves to give it more pumpkin spice flavor. I also doubled the recipe and got around 11 cupcakes. Bake time was more like 18 minutes. I omitted the frosting.
