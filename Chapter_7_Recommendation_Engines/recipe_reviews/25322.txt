Note from the recipe author -- A few people mentioned that it was missing something. If you noticed in the description, I said that it is a basic recipe, meaning that it is a starting point.  Add your favorite spices and vegetables.

This was really good!  Like someone else, said, it's really the sauce you use that makes or breaks it.  I made my own tomato sauce.  I also quadrupled the recipe, and used penne instead of shells.  I didn't use any of the cheese, but the tofu sure fooled everyone as ricotta!  Also, I sauteed zucchini slices and a portabello mushroom.  I decided to layer it like lasagna, with sauce on the bottom, a layer of noodles, some mushroom and zucchini chunks, then the tofu (used more), and then started over with the sauce.  I ended it with sauce on top and sprinkled chopped black olives all over the top.  Yum, yum, and quite healthy!!!  Next time I'll try it with lasagna noodles!

This was SO GOOD! I have been been searching for ways to make healthful vegetarian dishes, and this one was amazing! I especially liked how there was tofu incorporated into the sauce, and how there wasn't much cheese at all. This dish was also very filling on not a whole lot of calories, which was very nice. I will definately be making his again.
Thank You!

Really great base recipe. Substituting whole wheat penne for the pasta worked well.  I also sauteed the mushrooms with some garlic before baking and added some diced zucchini.  It's still excellent with 1/2 the cheese if you want to reduce the fat.

Great base recipe.  I like the idea of using tofu here.  It's bland as is, but as the submitter stated, ït's a good start.  I'm a garlic lover, so I throw in about 4 cloves of garlic (yes...I know), as well as green pepper, lots of mushrooms, lots of onions, some scallions, and huge amounts of pepper.  My mouth was burning... but I loved every minute!  =)

I just made this and it was one of those recipes that turned out right without me spending the whole meal "apologizing" to the family.  Of course, it's pretty hard to screw this one up and I owe alot of the credit to the makers of the particular spaghetti sauce I used-- the sauce is what determines the flavor of this dish, so unless you use your own sauce recipe, it's not really your success.  I trippled the recipe to serve six and I used an entire 12.3 oz package of tofu-- 3/4 cup just wasn't enough.  I used chopped portabellos since that's what we had for mushrooms and they tasted just fine.  The dish holds together very nicely, but it tasted a little funny when I microwaved the leftovers-- I don't recommend doing this if you use jarred sauce.  Overall very good and I will probably make it again.

It's only an okay recipe--I added a few vegetables, but I actually like the idea of just putting the tofu in with the sauce; it really was barely noticeable for those who arenèt big fans of tofu...still I don't think I'd follow the recipe again.

Only after some changes & additions would I rate this 5* because I think it would be bland as written. I used the "calculate" button for 5 servings. What I changed, using some others suggestions & my own ways: Increased the  amt. of pasta even a bit more. Used penne instead of shells which gave the dish more substance & chewines. Cooked al dente a must! Used good spaghetti sauce instead of tomato. Used portabello mushrooms since that's what I had. Increased amt. of tofu even a bit more. Sauted mushrooms & tofu in a little olive oil. Added drained artichokes, sliced & some roasted red pepper (from a jar), diced. Topped w/ more cheese - freshly grated Parmesan. Still was an easy, quick main dish & very yummy!

I followed the advice of other viewers and added chopped onion, garlic, more tofu and used almost 22 oz. of a tomato and basil sauce.  The casserole was delicious!

This was VERY good. I added mushrooms and a lot of garlic and some artichokes all chopped up. I also added some Italian seasonings to the sauce as I like it with a lot of flavour. I would make this again and again esp when I am in a hurry. Tastes even better the second day. My 5 yr old loved it too. Thanks.

Fast, easy and delicious.  I substituted spinach for the mushrooms and it was great.  My toddler helped me cook it and he loved it.  Great for making with and for kids!

Very good, a nice way to use silken tofu.  Definitely all about the sauce.  I added garlic and green pepper.  I wish I would have Pam-ed the dish before baking for easier cleanup.

This was very good.  I used it as recommended as just a base and adapted for my desires.  Also, I used ready-made pasta sauce, not plain tomato sauce as I was certain I would find it bland.  I didn't have mushrooms but added carrots, zucchini and onions as well as some extra Italian seasonings and garlic.  If I make this in the future, I will saute the vegetables to soften them before mixing.  I also didn't measure anything at all, just used the recipe as a guide.  It turned out very good, and was incredibly easy.  I'm not a fan of ricotta, so I think I'll be using tofu in my pastas in the future.

Made this last night with "Zippy Zucchini" on the side.  Quadrupled the recipe and it came out really tasty!  I wasn't sure how to "crumble" fresh tofu, so I just bought the MorningStar crumbles and sautéed them with Onion, Garlic, and Mushroom (with a little butter) before adding it to the shells.  I used "Prego 3 Cheese" and "Prego Tomato, Onion, and Garlic" flavored sauces.  We had a lot of extra Parmesan cheese, so that went on top about half-way through baking, which gave it a really flavorful, crispy top-layer.  I don't cook often and it was really easy - especially after reading reviews and learning some tricks.

I scaled it to 6 servings but I did 2 cups of the medium shell pasta and I added italian seasoning and garlic powder to 1 jar of Prego 3 cheese sauce.  I also cooked the mushrooms with garlic and a tad of butter before adding it to the sauce mixture.  I added about 1/2 cup baby portabella mushrooms since we love mushrooms and added about 2 tablespoons of real bacon bits to it.  I also did 1 box of the tofu as a few people recommended.  I baked it all until cheese on top browned well.  We loved it!

Easy, delicious way to eat tofu!  I used DeCecco penne pasta and Prego Spaghetti Sauce with Mushrooms.  Only problem was the top got too browned, so next time I'll either take it out at 20 minutes or else lower the heat.  I used more chese than recipe said.  Will definitely make many more times!  Thank you Krista for recipe.

This was the first tofu meal I've eaten let alone made! It was quick and easy and very yummy. Even my husband enjoyed it and "could handle" having it a couple times. His and my only complaint was that I customized it to 2 servings and there wasn't enough it was so good!

Wonderfull recipe. You can do anything you want here.  I added dried basil & oregano to the tomato sauce, I also added chopped fresh mushrooms and zucchini. My daughter is 9 and she loved it.  I told her the tofu chunks were white cheese.  Even better the next day.

This tasted like tomato sauce, pasta, and cheese usually taste (yummy, but not in a particularly surprising way).  I do like that it incorporates tofu.  As other reviewers pointed out, the better the sauce, the better the dish.

I modified somewhat based on what I had on hand.

Made with 1 cup pasta, 1/2 of an 8oz. container of sliced baby bella mushrooms (did not dice), 4 small cloves garlic (minced), 1 cup tomato sauce, heaping 1/2 cup tofu, heaping 1/2 cup mozzarella, 1/2 cup Parmesan, and some finely chopped basil, sage, and rosemary from my garden.

Sauteed mushrooms with garlic (as suggested by many).  Baked in a pammed 8x8 pan. Made 2 (very thin) layers each of the pasta mixture and the cheese mixture.

Overall, good, easy option for a weeknight dinner.

I thought this was excellent!  The tofu was a really cool idea that I would have never thought of adding to a dish like this.  I added sauteed onions and garlic and some fresh zucchini and squash.  I wanted more than 2 servings and ended up using 1 jar of sauce and half a package of pasta, and this turned out to be a good ratio.  I would recommend cooking the pasta VERY al dente, because it continues to cook in the oven, and then if you reheat any leftovers, the pasta becomes kind of mushy.  All in all, a great recipe that I will definitely make again!

I really didn't think this would be so good.  I added zuchini, lots of chopped onion, garlic, green pepper.  I also added a lot of cheese and dotted with butter.  Nobody could tell the difference between the tofu and cheese.  Like others stated, use a good quality sauce.  The more veggies...the better.  Thanks for the recipe.

this was really yummy. I sauteed the tofu with olive oil, garlic, green peppers, and artichoke hearts. I also added bread crumbs on top as suggested in one of the other reviews. I covered it with foil after about 20 minutes because it was starting to brown too much and cooked covered for another 10 minutes. I will definitely make again! My husband would not have known there was tofu in it if he hadn't seen the package on the counter.

I used this recipe as a basis/basic idea, and made my own variation on it with what I actually had in my kitchen. I used rotini pasta, with tofu, tomato sauce, herbs/spices, onion, and peppers. I mixed in the cheese, and layered a bit of cheese and italian bread crumbs over the top when I baked it. It made a great meal, and good leftovers!

I've made this recipe a few times--it's one of our favorites. I use the entire block of tofu and adjust the other ingredients accordingly. I also add a lot of onion, garlic, and much more mushrooms. Hunt's tomato sauce with basil, garlic, and oregano is perfect (at least for us). This recipe freezes well, and, unlike another reviewer, I found that it heated just fine in the microwave.

Fabulous!   I tried this last night and it was fantastic.   I used a jarred Arabiatta sauce and of course add spices such as garlic and italian seasoning.   What a great way to add tofu into a diet.  We're vegetarians and are always looking for new things to do with tofu.   I like that the cheese is not overdone in this, just enough to give it some texture.   I suggest taking this recipe and playing with it - it so versatile.   Two thumbs up.

We loved this basic recipe.  I used spaghetti sauce (more than called for) and added some browned Italian sausage and a few red pepper flakes.   The browned mozarella cheese on top made the dish!  Thanks!

I used seasoned (Italian) veggie crumbles - added my own spices, we loved this dish.  I would definitely make it again.

This was fantastic! I made it for my friend who was scared to try tofu and he loved it! I also used spaghetti sauce.

Excellent.  My kids don't know it was made with Tofu and a lot of mushrooms and they absolutely loved it!  I'll serve it to them again, wait for their smiles and then enlighten them!

I'm new to the vegetarian thing, so I've been trying out recipes that use alternatives to meat. I particularly don't like the texture/taste of tofu, but in the recipe you don't even notice it's there! I'll be making this one again!

This recipe was really simple. I didn't use the crumbled Parmesan cheese, instead I found a 4 cheese mix that had Parmesan in it and used it instead. My family loved it. I will make this again.

As is, I give this a three star, because it is very bland. I would give it a five star as a base recipe. Made with my homemade Italian sauce, more mushrooms, and more tofu, it is a great recipe. This recipe can easily be added to. Green Peppers would also be a nice addition. So experiment and I am sure you can make this into a recipe that you will enjoy.

Great basic recipe where you can add what you want! I made 4x's the amount to be able to use a whole block of tofu and used a whole jar of spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and added fake bacon and some sliced olives. I added garlic powder and italian seasoning since the spaghetti sauce is a tad bland. Great starter recipe! Oh and i used soy cheese instead of real cheese to make it a vegan dish :)

Quite good!!!! Just wish the measurements were given by weight, at least for the pasta... Didn't have shells, and the other kinds of pasta don't measure the same by the cup, so I think that's why I ended up with an overly saucy casserole.  But the flavors are great!

This was very good.  I don't eat dairy, so I used soy mozarella, which turned out well.  The second time I made it I added peas, which I liked, too.

I used spaghetti sauce instead of plain tomato sauce and added some sliced black olives I had left over.... Still needed something, not bad, but lacked interest.

For anyone who is wanting to try tofu for the first time this is a great place to start.  I had never tried tofu before, and this was not only quick and easy, it was tasty, just add a few spices of your own.

This was an awesome dish! I had to adjust to what I had available but it was essentially the same and excellent! Instead of mozzarella, I used cheddar and I just spread it over the top (didnt mix it in). I also added a touch of garlic before I mixed in the noodles for some extra flavor. 
  My husband is more of the carnivorous type, yet he LOVED this dish (said it was the best thing Ive ever made him, in fact) and didnt have the slightest incling that it was tofu in there. 
 I give this a big 5 stars!

Fantastic base recipe. I used a generic pasta marinara sauce and added garlic and spices. I did not have tofu or mushrooms, but I added some extra cheese. We will definitely use this again (and next time I'll make sure I have tofu and veggies in the fridge).

Wow! My husband, a tofu hater, didn't even suspect that the "cheese" wasn't cheese in this dish. He ate about three helpings! I dressed up jarred spaghetti sauce with onions, garlic and seasonings, and it was pretty good. He did suggest adding some italian sausage to spice it up, however, which I realize is not an option for the vegetarians cooking this recipe. :)

Thanks Krista B.....I'm giving this 5 stars because this is a great dish to sneak in tofu!  You don't even know it's there.  I make this recipe exactly as is.  My 5 year old and 3 year old don't like things with a lot of strong seasonings or spices, so this is perfect for us -- it's become a regular.

This is an excellent starter recipe! I doubled the pasta & sauce and used veggie mozz. cheese. I also had about 1/3 cup of sliced onions in the fridge, so caramelized those, then set them aside and cooked the diced mushrooms & about 1/4 cup of diced carrots in the same pan with a tablespoon of water and a tablespoon of butter. I mixed the tofu, onions, carrots and mushrooms together. I took other suggestions and layered the dish, topping it with nutritional yeast and throwing in chopped basil throughout. Absolutely delicious!

My husband thought this was a 3 star recipe, but to be fair I added black olives, which I think overpowered things a bit. My 15 month old son, on the other hand loves this and gobbled it up.

I only gave this four stars because it definitely needed more pasta sauce to keep the pasta from drying out as well as more veggies like squash, zucchini, and peppers for great flavor.  The tofu was excellent, and I would add more next time just because it was a great cheese substitute.  Overall, it was a great recipe, and I would definitely do it again!

WOW this was good! Really easy and easily modifiable. This is a great dish for people who "don't like tofu" because they'll assume it's ricotta or cottage cheese, the casually drop into the conversation that oh wait, that wasn't cheese...! I'll be making this one again very soon.

I enjoyed this recipe.  It was quick, easy and good.  I used a bit more tofu and cheese than called for.  Next time I will chop the mushrooms even smaller so my son can't see them and complain about them.  :)

It does start off pretty bland on its own. Next time I'll add more vegetables.

I actually changed this up a bit. I used the huge pasta shells and filled them individually. I would prefer regular firm tofu over the silken kind just because of the texture. I added a bit of parmesan cheese in the mix with spices and topped with mozeralla. This recipe worked well to give me ideas on pasta with tofu. Thanks!

This was pretty good- my first time using Tofu in anything - It was easy to make - I think next time I might use shredded parmesean instead of grated..

This was very delicious. I used a homemade sauce and the flavor was wonderful. There are many ingredients you could add to make this better.

This meal was excellent!  I altered it a bit...I added bacon with the tomato sauce (takes away from the veggie part of it, but I needed to use  it up), added a bunch of Italian spices and herbs, and used jumbo shells.  I also used the whole box of shells and whole brick of tofu to make a full sized casserole...turned out great!

Very easy and finally a good way to sneak Tofu into a dish so my husband will eat it.
