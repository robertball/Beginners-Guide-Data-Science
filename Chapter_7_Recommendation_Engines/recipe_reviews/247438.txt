Delicious. The marinade was easy to whip up, and the flavor was perfect. Made no changes to original recipe.

Really really like the sauce!  I followed all the directions as written and it is just great.  I prefer a sweeter sauce, so this was perfect.  The bone-in, skin on thighs however, were not so great.  I don't like to eat a sauced chicken with my fingers and it is too difficult to eat with a fork.  I will either debone next time, or buy boneless, skinless thighs.  As for the foil, well, that didn't go too well either.  Live and learn!  But I will definitely make the sauce again, and try with other cuts of chicken.  Thank you for a really nice recipe!

Not bad but not great.  I had high hopes and was super excited to serve this to my family, especially with all the great reviews.  I followed the recipe and directions exactly.  The same flavor could be easily achieved w a jar of premade BBQ sauce.  Disappointed, won't make again.

I found this a bit to ketchupy for us. I did follow the instructions, reduced the ketchup a bit, and then after they had been on the grill tinfoil for a bit, i removed the tinfoil and finished right on the grill with the reserved mix and honey BBQ sauce, i did some without the honey BBQ sauce as well. They still tasted good, but i prefer the BBQ taste to the ketchup taste.

Looked great, but chicken was so so,.  Will make again BUT it needs seasoning for chicken.  My advice, marinate in the seasoning (such as olive oil, garlic, thyme..some lime juice and more..just to penetrate the meat)...then bbq and put sauce on then, otherwise this is not worth it
