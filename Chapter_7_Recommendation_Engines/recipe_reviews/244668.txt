Really refreshing! I used lime instead of the lemon because I did not have enough lemon juice and the only other thing was that I did not have OJ so I didn't put it in but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Made and photographed as written and while the taste was great, it came out quite runny and nowhere near slushy. I recommend adding double the ice cubes to start with. I really enjoyed the tartness and this is one I'll make again on those hot summer days.
