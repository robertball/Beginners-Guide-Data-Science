I have made this simple recipe so many times (every time the Hubster calls randomly on his way home & says he feels like spaghetti & meat sauce for dinner) that I figure I should give it its due review.  It's so easy & hard to screw up, but also very easy to make even better!  I add 2 cloves minced garlic to the meat mixture during browning, sprinkle italian seasoning or dried basil depending on which sauce I am using, or add fresh herbs if I have them.  You can use any flavor sauce you like, which is a bonus.  Always a good go-to recipe!  :)

It's spaghetti out of a jar.  I guess I personally wouldn't call this a "recipe". Doesn't taste bad and it's fine for a dinner but still, it's a jar of sauce.

I've always made my sauce like this, but usually add fresh minced garlic. Great basic recipe & great for beginners!

This pasta sauce taste like it came out of a can.  The onion and beef could have been used elsewhere and tasted so much better...not a big fan of this recipe.

I always make my meat sauce this way and it's super simple and delicious! Instead of slicing my onion, I chop it small and I usually use the Ragu Mushroom Sauce. Sometimes I'll even use 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground hot or sweet sausage. This recipe is a definate family pleaser! :)

Definitely easy, can't go wrong with this one.  If you have any fresh basil on hand, it really brightens up the flavors to add about a tablespoon of chopped fresh basil.  Also good with 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper flakes.

I give this recipe 5 stars because it is what it says it is. EASY! I'm not sure why people who love doing everything from scratch keep looking at recipes marked easy, then either complaining because every ingredient isn't made from scratch or either completely changing the whole recipe into something complicated.

As a single guy living alone I'd be in the drive through every day, killing myself if it weren't for simple recipes like this that make it easy and fun for me to actually cook for myself. It also encourages me to add to and experiment with them. That's how you turn a fast food addict into someone who actually enjoys cooking. Thank you, and please don't be discouraged. :)
