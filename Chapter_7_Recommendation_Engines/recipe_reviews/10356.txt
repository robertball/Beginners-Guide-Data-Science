This recipe had more baking soda and/or baking powder per cup of flour than other similar recipes, and I was curious to see how that affected this cookie. I was so afraid it might turn out like a fluffy cookie, but found it did not.  In fact, I really noticed no difference with the extra leavening.  Other than reducing the salt to 1/2 tsp., I made the recipe as written, and found not much difference between other recipes I've tried. I chilled the dough for about an hour until semi-firm, dropped the dough with a medium size scoop, and flattened them just slightly before baking.  Good, dependable recipe.

I always use this recipe but I use milk chocolate chips, they're less bitter. I also use whole wheat flour instead of white and it gives the cookies an entirely new taste, both versions are great.

I think I finally found the chocolate chip cookie recipe I have been trying to find for years.  These turned out perfectly for me.  I did cook them less than stated because I was looking for a chewy cookie and succeeded.

These are crispy, gooey, rich and good! For crispness, don't underbake. They bake up nice and uniform. Actually, they remind me of Toll House slice and bakes! They take a little more time but not much.

Dear Becky,

We love you, errr, your cookies.  

Seriously, delicious recipe.  As written, delicious, chewy and appeals to a wide demographic (our Japanese friends raved over them!); slightly modified (aka, 1/2 of the sugar)-still delicious, slightly crispy, and our friends still rave.  

We do let the dough sit in the fridge for 10-15 minutes before we drop them on a sheet.  And out of the many times that we've made these, only once have we used the full amount of sugar.  1.5 cups is a lot of sugar.  That + chocolate is WAY too much sugar!  Very unhealthy! 

We make these cookies a bit too often . . . if you get my drift!  Thanks for the recipe!

After reading the reviews, I decided to cut the salt back to a half teaspooon and just stick with the baking soda leaving out the baking powder. This reminds me a lot of the Tollhouse cookies I've been making since I was a small child. I got soft chocolate chip cookies--quite like bakeries make. This will be excellent for school lunches. I plan on bagging them up in snack bags by two's and freezing. They'll be thawed and ready to eat by lunchtime. Very good. I was pleased that I didn't have to chill the dough and these didn't spread a lot, which I was worried about. Next time, I'll add a half cup or so of pecans. NOTE: 350* for ten minutes, letting it rest for a minute on the hot pan,  was just right for me.

I've been on the look out for a good chewy chocolate chip cookie and this one fits the bill nicely. I added 1/2 c. extra flour, used margarine instead of butter, and doubled the vanilla. I kept everything else as written and they turned out crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside. A very good cookie. Next time I will try with butter to see if it makes any difference in the flavor. Thanks for sharing!

Awesome! I didn't put as many chocolate chips as suggested and in the last dozen I added bits 'o brickle (Heath Bar Bits) to the batter. My boyfriend loved them. I've baked a lot of cookies in my day and this recipe is by far the best one I've tried. So crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. If you're using only 1 cookie sheet make sure you cool down the baking sheet under cool running water. This will make each batch cook evenly.

The cookie was good.  The batter was thick , however mine did spread out a bit thinner then I would of liked- I tried cooking one batch on parchment paper to see if that made a different and it did only slightly. I think maybe the amount of butter caused them to really expand when cooking.

Delicious! I use 1 egg instead of 2 and 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla. I like it with 1 1/2 C chocolate chips. A little more economical too! This will be my go to cookie recipe from now on.

This was a very simple recipe to use. The cookies are nice. They look like the picture. And there soft. I thikn maybe a little less baking soda would be good. Mine have a slight taste of popcorn to them. hehe.

But GREAT cookies.

I've tried many of the CCC recipes on AR w/varying results.  Thanks to fellow AR aficionado, Sanzoe, I decided to branch out from my very favorite CCC recipe, "Felix K's blah blah blah", and give these a try.  I'm glad I did!  This dough was delicious, these cookies fresh out of the oven were awesome, and the cookies completely cooled the next morning were outstanding, as well.  The cookies had a nice bit of a crisp on the edges, yet were soft and chewy throughout, even the next day.  I followed the recipe, w/the exception of subbing sea salt for salt, and a bit more than a tsp (I love some salty w/my sweet!).  This recipe yielded 30 balls of cookie dough to be frozen for my CCCdough Cupcakes, 6 large (1/4Cish) chocolate chip cookies, and 12 small cookies.  While I'm not ready to give Felix the boot, I did like these enough to want to do a side by side bake off in the near future!  THANKS, Becky!

These really were "never fail"!  I have had some trouble finding a reliable chocolate chip cookie recipe and this is it!  Some reviewers indicated 1 tsp. of salt was too much, but remember you are supposed to use unsalted butter when baking, so 1 tsp. is the right amount.  I think one key to this recipe creating "never fail" cookies is baking at 350 degrees, that way the butter in the cookie does not melt too fast.  This will be my "go to" recipe for chocolate chip cookies!

These cookies were DELICIOUS! I made them for a bake sale, although I did change a few things. Well, first of all I made 36 cookies instead of 24. I didn't have brown sugar so just used white, and I used a little less (1 3/4 cups instead of 2 and 2 tablespoons). I also used less butter (two sticks rather than three), less chocolate chips (two cups instead of three as that was all I had), and whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. They turned out amazingly. Perfect amount of chocolate, slightly crunchy on the outside while being soft on the inside, they easily made a five star cookie. I only rated it four stars because of the changes I made. Great recipe, will make again.

These cookies were GREAT!!  I live in Brazil and was worried because here they don't have ingredients such as baking soda, only baking powder (which I wasn't even sure was actual baking powder).  I learned that when you don't have baking soda, you can substitute by adding 3x the amount of suggested baking soda in baking powder. ex. 1 tsp of baking soda = 3 tsp of baking powder.  Also, we don't have an hand mixer so I used my own man power (in the form of my husband).  They also don't sell chocolate chips here so we had to chop up a plain bar of chocolate (used milk, next time will use semi sweet).  These cookies turned out AWESOME!  They were cooked evenly, mine WERE chewy, exactly the texture I was looking for, and were delicious overall.  They were a bit hit for my Brazilian In-Laws who have never tasted a soft cookie before (I know!!!).  Thank you!

Meh. My hubby and I really didn't like these cookies. I'm not sure if it was the mixture of brown sugar and white sugar or what. They looked great, but they just weren't what we were looking for. They were really annoying to roll into balls because they were so gooey I was constantly scraping large clumps off my hands. I won't make these again.

These cookies were awesome!  I used a few less chocolate chips but other than that I followed the recipe.  They were soft in the middle just like I like.  I also slightly underbaked because I like mine gooey.

These are the first chocolate chip cookies that I have made from scratch and I think they are delicious. Everyone in my family loved them. I followed the recipe exactly; they were firm enough to not fall apart but VERY chewy and tasted just as good several days later. The recipe does yield close to 4 dozen cookies, so after the first two dozen, I added walnuts which are my husband's favorite. Those were awesome too. I don't have any other recipes to compare this one to, but it will be the only one I use!

Depending on who you ask you'll get a response of 4 stars to 5 stars (in the group that ate the cookies.)  I followed the recipe to the T and personally found the 2 cups of chips to be too much making it a little too sweet.  I had no complaints from a 13 year old except, wow, they are big (I was in a hurry and made them quite big).  Others gave this recipe a 4 because they had waited hours after I baked them to try them and found them... 4 material (best way to describe it I guess.)  I had left over dough from the morning and made them again this evening and got immediate 5s from the same people who gave them 4s earlier.  This is because they were fresh from the oven, gooey, chewy, fabulous (but still slightly over sweet in my opinion).  The ONLY reason this cookie gets a 4 is because of the sweetness but if you like that in a cookie, it's a 5 all the way.  You MIGHT need to cook them longer than suggested, do a cookie check before taking them out (do they sink too much in the middle?)

Some of the pictures posted didn't look very good. So I did a few things different. I used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet, and I put the dough in the fridge for about ten minutes,  then used one of those tablespoon measuring spoons to drop onto the sheet. I baked them for 10-11 minutes. I stored the dough in the fridge while I was baking each batch. They turned out very good. They do seem a little thin compared to what I'm used to. Which is why I don't recommend baking them longer than 10 min or they may turn out too crispy.

these are the greatest cookies EVER! I made about 2 dozen and they are practically gone now! There are a whole lot out there but trust me these are absolutely "THE BEST." I left them out all day and they are still very moist and sweet and oh my goodness!!! It will be the sweetest thing you've ever tasted!

I'm pretty picky about my chocolate chip cookies, but these did not disappoint for a very basic recipe. I liked the crisp edges and mildly chewy (not cakey, which is one of my pet peeves), center. My 3 year old requested a simple chocolate chip cookie recipe, and this one did not disappoint.

Great recipe! I used this recipe for a bake sale at my mom's salon and I'm hoping that I raise enough money to go to my winter camp with our church! Dropped my cookies so that the diameter was about one inch all the way around so they would fit in little baggies and the cookies turned out great! I also used milk chocolate chips rather than semi-sweet because I took a poll at my mother's salon last year to see what was the favorite type of chip out of butterscotch, milk, semi-sweet, wight, and darck chocolate chips. Hope this helps!

I made a large batch and was glad that these really turned out. Very yummy. The degree of chewiness depends on the baking time, I preferred them chewier.

This recipe is amazing! I literally almost know it by memory I've done it so many times. I started baking these choc chip cookies when I had 3 roommates, and they'd disappear in 3 days tops (1 batch does about 40ish for me, depending on how big I make them). I also use milk chocolate chips and I read a tip to use salted butter instead of unsalted to help with the dough spreading too much while baking which has worked wonders when I have to bake in a convection oven. 

Overall: Never fail really means NEVER FAIL!!!

I did not care for these cookies.  I followed the recipe precisely and I ended up with thin, runny mounds of doughy mess.  The second pan came out of the oven the same as the first.

I just took these out of the oven. They are very good. However, I did make some changes to the original recipe in a effort to make them a little healthier for my family. I omitted the white sugar, increased the brown sugar to 1 cup, used only 1 egg, 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of white flour and decreased chocolate chips to 1 1/3 cups (250g pkg). I increased the flour based on several other reviews. I did feel that the batter was a little dry once it was mixed together so I added a splash (about 1 - 2 tbsp) of milk. They turned out really nice ... soft and moist ... not at all dry and plenty of chocolate chips.  I would make them again!

These are a very tasty, easy to make cookie! I didn't have any butter so I followed Crisco's directions for equalling the amount of butter called for here. Added in sixty percent bittersweet chocolate chips,1 cup, and one cup of semisweet chips,with a little cinnamon,and some extra vanilla to counteract the shortening taste. They were crispy on the edges and chewy inside,yum...

I had given up on making the pefect chocolate chip cookie - the title says it all......"Never Fail"!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Creamed sugars and butter for about 7 minutes, until fluffy and sugar granulars were blended.  As the others recommened to take of oven at 9 minutes.  The cookies were perfectly baked.  After they cooled, the texture was soft but not mushy.  The bottom of cookies were a golden brown.  The kids and my husband said they were the best cookies EVER!!!!!  This recipe is a keeper!

I enjoyed the cookie texture, but found the recipe to have too much salt. Next time I will reduce the salt from 1 tsp to 1/2 tsp.

I tried making these "never fail" cookies using the metric measurements. Can I just clarify...? 6g of salt?! Is this REALLY correct? The amounts of sugar and flour all seem rather appropriate. It wasn't until after making these HORRIBLE cookies and looking at the imperial measurements that I find out that it in fact requires only 1/2 tsp of salt. These cookies were TOO TOO SALTY. NEVER AGAIN.

These really are delicious! I used a bit less salt, as the first batch came out a little too salty, but apart from that, these were perfect - soft insides and slightly crunchy outside! My husband loved them, and he doesn't even like cookies!

Best recipe I have found, and they always turn out amazing! As long as you don't over cook them anyways :) I always keep an eye on them because I like a gooey cookie that's all the way done in the middle but soft all the way to the edges. Top it all off with a glass of ice cold milk and it will make your day!

I doubled the batch and added extra chocolate chips. The cookies were great, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, perfect!

As I was making the dough I was wary because it was sticky, and not as thick as my usual recipe. However, these do not dissapoint! This is now my second time making them, following the recipe exactly, and they are making the house smell amaing! I've played around with different chips (white, milk chocolate, etc), and every type tastes so good! A new staple recipe for sure!

Just tried this recipe - the taste is PERFECT - but my cookies are quite flat.  I will not give up though as I live at a mile high altitude and should have added a little more flour (will try 1/4 to 1/3 cup more next time).  But as a sign of hope, they are being eaten quickly by my sons so they might look goofy but they taste GREAT!

So my husband and I are remodeling our family room, and I am bored, waiting to get to work. So I want to make some cookies. I look, but am short a few ingredients. I made these using 1/2 cup butter/1/2 olive oil, 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white and threw in white chocolate chips. Best cookies we have ever had!

Easy to make and tastes great... and it came out looking like a chocolate chip cookie. It wasn't flat, nor was it fluffy. It's much lighter in color than I'm used to. I made the recipe to a T, and I would suggest less salt next time around. You do have to make large scoops- 2 heaping tablespoons.

Except for the addition of the baking powder, a 1/4 cup more flour and nuts (which I didn't want anyway) this recipe is identical to the Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe.  I tried it because I wanted to see if the baking powder made a difference, which it did.   Thanks.

Buttery, chewy and delicious. We added 1 and 1/2 cups Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup sweetened, dried cranberries, and baked them exactly 10 minutes. They're very good.

I just got done baking these cookies and they were amazing.  My husband loved them.  I softened the butter and the brown sugar in the microwave before adding the rest of the ingrediants.  I also used a little more vanilla then it called for.  Excellent.  Will definatly make these cookies again.  Thanks for the recipe! yum yum

I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL CHOCOLATE CHIP RECIPES AND IF YOUR COOKIES ARE LIKE MINE THEY NEVER COME THE SAME FOR SOME REASON. IF YOU FOLLOW THIS RECIPE AS DIRECTED YOU SHOULD HAVE THE PERFECT CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE. I WAS ACTUALLY SURPRISE HOW GOOD IT WAS. I SAW SOME REVIEW IT AS NOT SWEET ENOUGH, HOWEVER I THOUGHT IT EXACTLY HOW IT SHOULD BE AND IT WAS PLENTY SWEET. THIS IS A MUST TRY RECIPE FOR SURE

They failed me!! :(:(  I really don't understand why.  I did half the recipe, but that shouldn't be the reason... My cookies became burned (really badly) at the bottom.  Also, they wouldn't spread out like cookies should - they pretty much stayed in their ball shapes!

I've made these so many times, I can't count.  Always perfect and I follow the recipe as stated.  My only change is I usually undercook the cookies by a few minutes, just for my families texture preference.  I highly recommend this recipe and will make many more times!  Thank you for sharing

I have mastered this recipe and can whip out an awesome batch of chocolate chip cookies any time I want now!  This is a very versatile base that can weather changes easily. White chips, milk chocolate chips, pecans, walnuts, dried fruit are all different things that I've used.  The cookies are soft, chewy, crispy on the edge, and keep well in the fridge.

Perfect recipe.  Nearly the same as the tollhouse cookie recipe, but adds a bit of baking powder.  These came out the perfect consistency.  Not too flat, not too cakey - just perfect.  I made some without putting the dough in the freezer, and I made some where I'd put the dough in the freezer for 20-30 minutes.  I couldn't tell a difference.  Anyway, this recipe is the keeper for me.

These were great! Followed the recipe exactly as written, except to use some brewed coffee in place of the vanilla extract. Everyone enjoyed these. Lived up to their name for me!

Yummy!! My guest loved these!!   Big hit!  I doubled the Vanila, used 1/2 cup butterscotch chips, and 1 cup of crushed up Almond Rocca instead of regular chocolate chips.  Baked 10 minutes!  Slight crisp on the outside and chewy and done on the inside!

I found this to be a very good recipe, I made a few of my own changes to it though.. I only used 1 cup of semisweet chips, and used 1 cup of white chocolate chips instead. I also added some sprinkles into the dough, and on top, just cause I like pretty colours ha! But overall a very good recipe!

These were great! I made some changes, though:  (1) Reduce sugar to 1 cup; (2) reduce salt to 1/2 teaspoon; (3) Add 1 tablespoon almond extract; (4) I used chopped baker's semi sweet chocolate in lieu of chips. Excellent flavor!!

Best homemade chocolate chip cookie I've made thus far.  However, I would like a bit more salt or something to make the flavor more rich and binding.  Therefore I give it 4stars.

I used 1/2 cup brown sugar-instead of 3/4 cup, 1/4 cup white sugar-instead of 3/4 cup, 1/2  cup butter(1 stick)- instead of 1 cup(2 sticks), 2 cups of white wheat flour and 1/4 cup wheat germ-instead of 2 1/2 cup AP flour, 1 cup milk chocolate chips(could use 1 1/2 cups). They were pretty good and easy to whip up. I really like to use white wheat flour in baked goods. For a soft cookie bake at 300F for 12 minutes and for a crisper cookie bake at 325F for 12 min.

Love this recipe.  I added almost all of my ingredients  before I realized I only had self-rising flour.  I went ahead and used it and it turned out awesome, even using all of the same measurements of the other ingredients.  I'll use it again.  And I'll probably use the self-rising flour again!

These came out great!  I followed the recipe exactly and baked the cookies, depending on the batch in the oven, 11-13 minutes, like the recipe calls for.  The cookies were nice and chewy!  I'll use this one from now on.

1st time I bake it I had accidentally used 3 cups of flour. It turned out chewy but nice to eat. 2nd time I baked it, it turn out flat, but crispy and chewy in the middle. Just how I like it. It is a delicious cookie.

These are wonderful!  I don't make chocolate chip cookies often as they are not my favorite.  My fiance, however, loves them, so once a month...  I cut the recipe in half because we definitely don't need 4 dozen.  Ooops!  I am now making a second, full batch for a picnic tomorrow.  These are great!!  I kept the recipe as is, except I only used 3/4 of the called for chocolate chips.  It was plenty! Though I've used allrecipes for a while, this is the first recipe that I was inspired to review.  Simple to follow for new bakers, and yummy enough that more experienced bakers will be proud to serve them.

This recipe has never failed me (unlike a few others I've tried on this site.) I did change the baking to 375 for 8-9 minutes so they would come out nice and soft. I've dropped all other chocolate chip recipes for this one, and I'm even using this to try other recipes (like replacing the vanilla with almond and using white chocolate chips).

The best chocolate chip cookie I've ever baked or eaten.  They are soft and chewing on the inside, with a crispness outside.  The only change I made was to add walnuts I recommend this as the last word in Chocolate Chip Cookies!

These cookies were perfect! They were crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. I baked them for the minimum time. The only change I made was to use 1-1/2 cups whole wheat flour instead of all white flour.

I use 1 C packed brown sugar and 1/2 C white sugar, but other than that, this recipe is amazing. I have gotten compliments on it from everyone I have given them to- and one batch lasts my boyfriend about two days. Thanks so much!

made exactly as written... only 4 stars because it didnt have the taste of a chocolate chip cookie, will try again with brown sugar, and see if that fixes the problem :)

These are delicious.  If you like nice moist gooey cookies, you've found the best ones on the planet!  I use whole wheat flour and they are just amazing, really this is such a great time to use whole wheat flour (even if you dont like it).  It just makes the cookies amazing, no body can stop eating them.  I only make half a batch each time I make them and still sadly my bf and I eat almost all of them that same day -_-. When I share them with others they go withing five minutes. : )  The only other thing I do is bake for only 10 minutes, I find that exactly 10min is always perfect if I split the batch evenly into 12 cookies, but then again ovens vary so that's that ^_^

Ok so I rated this once already and gave it a 4 star. BUT I had to change it to a 5 star for many reasons.#1 they were so chewy and so good the 2nd day! And my two year old son LOVED them! Well everyone loved them but he is extremely picky with cookies but he devoured these ones!!! I think I finally found the cookie recipe I have always been looking for!!

For years I gave up making choc. chip cookies because using the Toll House recipe they turned out as a gloppy mess.  This is the recipe I was waiting for and I think I can blame it for a 2 pound weight gain over the holidays! They are addictive.  Thank you for bringing homemade choc. chip cookies back to my house.  I mixed semi-sweet and milk choc. chips (ratio 3:1) and it was a perfect blend.

Fantastic, I ran out of brown sugar...I only had 1/2 c. so I used 1c. white sugar and I wanted them to be for something for Christmas so I added some holiday mint M&M's in with the choc. chips.  They turned out great! Thanks for the recipe.

I have only tried a few cookie recipes but I love to eat chocolate chip cookies and I thought these were perfect. Not too hard or too soft, not too sweet and mine were not cakey at all as some people reported. I only had one because the family and kids friends finished them before I could have more.

These cookies were very good, but nothing really amazing about them.  I was just looking for an easy recipe and it worked out just fine.  I was making these for my college guy friends, and they gobbled them down. They'll eat anything though...

These are delicious! I used 1/2 butter flavored crisco instead of all butter. The results are delicious! Crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle. I also used a hazelnut extract since I ran out of vanilla. I used my pampered chef medium cookie scoop and got about 3 1/2 dozen.

After years of making the Nestle Tollhouse recipe (with a bit more flour) - I officially am switching to this recipe! Even though it is such a minor addition (the baking powder) - it adds the right amount of "puffiness". I have tried many other recipes, and this one is great! NOTE: If you are using SALTED butter, cut the salt amount back to 3/4 tsp.

I have made cookies with this recipe several times and they have been a huge success with my extended family and all my schoolfriends. I even made a giant cookie and iced it as a birthday present! I don't always use the two different kinds of sugars reccomended (purely because I don't always have them!) but it works just as well with 1 1/2 cups of white sugar. To make them even softer and stay chewy for longer, add about 3 tbsp more butter and soften it in the microwave before mixing. A fab recipe, a definite keeper!!

Very basic and great flavor and really you can't fail. Use unsalted butter. Good base for different chips too - I like white chocolate and 1/2 tsp. almond extract.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!! My 11 yr old daughter came home from school with cookies on her mind.  She found the recipe and started baking.  The were soooo good.  Well, the next day she took a few to school and shared with her friends.  She now has orders, so I guess WE ARE in business (I need my cut for picking up the ingredients!)  She has a secret ingredient not included with the recipe...she added a tablespoon of peanut butter. MMMMMMM

Two words: D-licious.  This is an awesome Choc chip cookie recipe.  They rise up beautifully and stay that way even after removing them from the oven.  Instead of butter(because I didn't have any on hand) I used no salt margarine.

Very very good tasting cookie. Soft, kinda fluffy not flat, not too heavy or dense, Nice texture. These were very rich, hubby and I could only eat two. He can usually eat half a batch fresh from the oven. I didn't have margarine so I had to use real butter, which may be why they are so very rich and filling. I used candy coated choc chips (mini kisses in the silver bag). 2 cups was more than plenty. A really good cookie, worth making. They won't go to waste here, that's for sure.

Wonderful!  I use 2 1/4 cups flour instead of 2 1/2 cups, which I believe is the same amount called for in the original tollhouse cookie recipe.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I used all brown sugar and 50/50 white/wheat flour.  My 7 year old didn't care for the dough but my 5 year old did.  The cookies taste very good.  Not too "wheaty".  Thanks for a good recipe.

Kinda basic- but as the title suggests, it's a recpie that at the least will never fail. Stoners enjoyed them, but discussed better options while consuming... never a good sign.

Awesome! Thanks so much. This is now my #1 chocolate chip cookie recipe. I can't imagine any recipe topping this for great buttery-chocolatey taste and tender-crispy texture.

These cookies were quite "Cakey" and most definitely *NOT* "Chewy" or "Like toll-house cookies" (As another review here claimed.)  While the flavor (for a cakey cookie) was average, I prefer a more chewy cookie, and therefore was disappointed with this recipe and the other reviews that toted the cookies as both "Chewy" and "Not Dry or Cakey"

No changes made. Just a good old fashioned, crispy chocolate chip cookie. Don't forget to "flatten" the top a bit.( I use a damp spoon.)

Sorry, but I changed it a bit. One cup of dark brown sugar and one half of white because I love the molasses flavor in the background. I also lowered the butter to 3/4 cup and took out two tablespoons of flour and an egg white (whites dry out cookies, while yolks add moisture-as does the extra brown sugar, which also helps with chewiness). I used a trick I learned to make cookies super chewy: melt the butter and mix well with the sugars- I swear it works! I added two teaspoons vanilla, again for more flavor in the dough. Didn't use that much leavening-only 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and 1/4 teaspoon of powder (baking powder is the trick to get that "craggy" bakery looking top). Lowered salt to 1/2 teaspoon also. Used Ghiradelli bittersweet chips. With these changes it was the best tasting chocolate chip cookie my guests have ever tried! Super chewy, full of flavor-5 stars for sure!

Never fail cookies alright. These came out  very good; finally found a recipe that is on point. (NOTE: I did not use brown sugar because I did not have any at the moment. I only had cane sugar. Which still came out very good, which now I call "Mature Cookies" because of less sugar) I let the cookies for about 15 mins, for a crisp.

These cookies were perfect!! They were extremely easy to make. I loved the fact that they were not overly sweet like some chocolate chip cookies that I have made in the past. They were also the perfect texture; not too soft or crunchy-just perfect. I did not have any unsalted butter on hand (which is what I always use for baking), so I simply omitted the salt. Other than omitting the salt, I followed the recipe 100%.

Every time I have made these cookies they've been a huge hit.  I get begged to make more. This is the first cookie recipe I tried making all on my own (I can't cook to save my life) and now everyone thinks I'm an expert. I will never use another cookie recipe.

So the five stars are from my husband, who gave these cookies his highest praise: "They taste just like my mom's!" I tried freezing half the dough by cookie-scooping onto a tray then putting 'em in a freezer bag for baking later. I put the dough balls on a cookie sheet while I preheated the oven to 350 then baked as usual. That "freezer batch" was the one that earned the coveted "good as mom's" endorsement! These cookies are nicely crunchy and hold up to dunking.

After losing half the batter to my husband's boyish stomach, these cookies came out great. I used white chocolate chips as I had them left over from another recipe. I still can't figure out though how to portion out the dough to not make a huge cookie....

Favorite of my entire family, literally NEVER FAIL. I like to refrigerate my dough for at least and hour and sometimes over night. I have frozen the dough and then baked it so if I feel like having a few cookies I just scoop out that many. Love it

I live in Ecuador at 9400 feet, and the high altitude wreaks havoc with most chocolate chip cookie recipes.  This one, however, worked like a charm!  The only change I made was to add an extra half cup of flour since the local butter seems to be much softer than US butter.
UPDATE:  I've now made these about a dozen times, and each time I do at least one person asks for the recipe.  They're now known locally as "crack cookies" because they're so addictive!

Terrific NO FAIL recipe; added extra 1/2 cup flour so they won´t flatten so much because I didn´t chill the dough first, due to time restraint. The recipe made 44 cookies, each about 3 inches diameter after baking.

I have been using this recipe for years. My husband and kids LOVE these cookies. I use 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup applesauce to cut the fat (mix the butter with the sugars first, then add the applesauce) and they are yummy. Excellent recipe!!!!

This is the first time ever that I've made a cookie from scratch and it actually taste good. The directions were easy to follow and the prep time really didn't take long at all. My husband and kids loved them.

This is a basic chocolate chip cookie recipe and it tastes great.  I didn't change any of the measurements of ingredients and left it as is.  I used a teaspoon scoop and mine were baked at 8 minutes in my convection oven.  I let them sit on the baking sheet for one minute after taking them out of the oven.  These cookies are very sturdy and very forgiving and they didn't fall apart on the spatula when I was transferring to cooling racks and I loved that.  They were crispy on the edges and chewy in the center which is what a chocolate chip cookie should be.  Mine did not turn out flat either and stayed puffy in the middle.  Thank you for a great recipe that uses all butter and doesn't turn out flat or greasy.  This will be my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe from now on!

This is one of the best chocolate chip cookies recipes that I have ever tried.  It gets so many compliments.  I've changed the type of chip on occasion, but I find I still like semisweet the best.  Usually, I bake half of the dough and freeze the remainder for later. Delicious!

I liked the  recipe, needs to be a little sweeter, probably try regular chocolate chips next time rather than semi sweet. The cookies were perfect otherwise! I only baked mine for about 9 minutes which made them softer just like I like em!

The texture of these cookies is absolutely perfect! There is something just slightly off in the taste though, and I can't quite pinpoint it. Next time I'll try a touch more salt and vanilla extract. They got rave reviews as is, but I am picky about my cookies. :)

These are great! The only complaint I have is that I think they are a little too sweet. I might cut the sugar a smidgen the next time I bake these. It took about 20 minutes for large cookies (number 20 scoop) and 13 minutes for small cookies to bake. They are nice and chewy inside and fabulously crunchy outside. These will be replacing the tollhouse recipe from my very old betty crocker cookbook.

Were these EVER a hit at my house!! They were SO good!!! I didn't have regular size chocolate chips, so I used mini, so there were what looked like a thousand chocolate chips in it!  They were the best I have had in a long time.  Thank you SO SO SO much for sharing.

They were PERFECTLY moist, but not goey, not crusty either. I have failed MISERABLY in the past with chocolate chip cookies. THIS WORKS!  threw in some cinnamon with 1/3 of the remaining batter and they were GREAT!

These chocolate chip cookies turned out great!  I followed the recipe as listed except as suggested by another reviewer I only used 1/2 of the salt, and actually ended up running out of chocolate chips so I added Skort bits instead.  I got so many compliments.  Great recipe - these really are "never fail" cookies!

Used 1 stick room temp margarine & 1/2c shortening. All else was exact to recipe. I use one cookie sheet and rotate between my silicone baking mats, so while one mat of cookies cools, the other's in the oven. Cooling for 5 min "deflates" the cookies, but they're as soft as ever and not undercooked. Delicious!

Good.  I should have flattened them, they were very thick.  Also, found them a little floury, so next time I would reduce the flour.

I made these cookies and they turned out good except they were kinda hard but that was my fault because i left them in there too long. But what helped is storing them with a slice of white bread and they were more softer the next time i ate it. THANK YOU!!

I used all ingrients as directed.  I scooped the dough on the cookie sheet by the teaspoon, so you can get 30-35 cookies on one sheetand baked for 15 min.    This was my first time making bite sized cookies and they turned out fantastic!  Definitely on my list of favorites.  Thanks for the recipe ^_^

This is DEFINITELY my go-to recipe whenever I make cookies now!!   Whenever I want a little variation, I have absolutely no problem leaving out the chips to make snickerdoodles, or using other ingredients to make it my own... They come out perfect EVERY time and I always receive SO many compliments on it!  THANK YOU for posting this recipe!!

These are th best chocolate cookies ever! To make them a little healthier I and still taste great, I use whole wheat pastry flour. It make a big difference and they don't taste like cardboard! Thank so much for the recipe.

I scaled down the recipe to make 12 cookies instead of 24 (just cooking for my husband and myself) and omitted the baking soda, but I followed the recipe otherwise.  They turned out well! It was my second time making homemade cookies, but it wasn't too difficult.  I did make a huge mess in the kitchen, but the end result was worth it.  :) I'll keep this cookie recipe on hand for sure.  Thanks!

Great cookie, chewy and moist. I added 1 C brown sugar 1/2 C white.  Added more vanilla and less salt.  I baked for 9 minutes.

Finally a recipe that didn't call for shortening! These turned out fantastic, I'm not a huge fan of chocolate chip cookies but even I couldn't say no to them.  I tried them with the semi sweet chocolate chips and some white chocolate chips, both were gobbled up.

This recipe was not real good at all. I like fluffy cookies, but this had more of a cake texture. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips, and I wish I hadn't. The cookie was not sweet at all; and I have a real sweet-tooth. I will not be making this again. I would advise changing the recipe to your own taste, but don't follow it exactly!

Baked these last night (my first time baking cookies from scratch) and they turned out pretty good. A little too cakey for my taste, so next time I'll definitely use less flour. I'd also recommend letting the dough sit in the fridge for a bit (10-15 minutes).

Delicious! I didn't have any vanilla extract so I had to omit it but they came out great anyway. Also, I had salted butter so I only put a pinch of table salt into the mix. Next time I add nuts. I did this for my daughter's end of preschool party at a classmates house and they were a huge hit!

These cookies turned out to be amazing! I was looking for a quick and easy recipe to make my boyfriend for Valetines Day considering he LOVES cookies and I was 100% satisfied with this recipe, as was he! Between him and his 2 nieces, the entire batch of cookies which was about 30 total, was gone in 4 days! He keeps reminding me how much he loved them...so tonight Im going to surprise him with another batch! :) Thanks for the recipe!

I made these using the exact recipe, and they were really good the first day, nice little crunch on the outside, but the next morning they were very mushy. I'm still looking for a crunchy chocolate chip cookie that stays crunchy!

I really thought from the reviews these would be the type of cookie I was craving, a warm slightly flat chewy soft on the inside chocolate chips melted all gooey cookie but they really weren't.  They were way too cake like (though soft) and poofy and definitely not the chewy chocolate cookie recipes I am searching for.  maybe take out the baking powder??

This was the best recipe for chocolate chip cookies I've ever baked. I had used the recipe off the chocolate chip pagage but I didn't like the way the would spread out on the cookie sheet. I figured out most recipe don't call for baking powder just baking soda. This recipe is a keeper!! Thanks

Mine came out cakey and not chewy for some reason... They taste ok, not great. Maybe I will try more brown sugar to get the chewiness.

Great cookie dough!! I would make it just for that instead of baking it! My 1st batch came out alright (my pan isn't big enough to put all on there) I accidentally cooked it at 375 so its alittle hard. I've got my 2nd batch cooking now at 350 and I'm sure they'll be good.

This recipe has exactly the same ingredients as Bennigan's chocolate chip cookies that they use for their Cookie Mountain Sundae!

I haven't made it yet, but I'm sure it will be great.

I found these cookies bland and not particularly sweet.  They weren't crispy or gooey - just cakey and soft and pain.  I think next time I'd up the brown sugar 1/4 cup.  Or just find another recipe.

These came out well. I have a hard time rating cookies, because here we only have convection ovens (ie, overgrown toasters) so I always have to modify the recipe a little or risk getting "sheet of cookie" instead of cookies. I chill the dough before cooking to help the cookies keep their shape. That's all I did to this recipe. As a result, the cookies stayed together pretty well...I'd be happier if they spread a little more, but I suspect that's more my complications and less the recipe. They taste great!

It was pretty good. I just wish it was a just a little bit sweeter. Next time, I'm going to try it with 1 cup each of the brown and white sugars.

All I have to say is OH MY GOD.  Awesome recipe!  Mine were a little crumbly but I think it's because I only had enough butter for one cup.  I substituted with just a little water and they still came out amazing!

I had to substitute (or try to) a lot of ingredients. Applesauce for butter, maple syrup and white sugar to make brown sugar, then I ran out of White sugar and had to use some powdered sugar. They turned out surprisingly edible! Instead of chocolate chips I used cut up Kinder chocolate bars (from Germany) and the kids put a smartie on the top of each cookie. They are not as sweet as a chocolate chip cookie would normally be, they are more cake like, but equally delicious!

These are great. I can't say the 1/2 tsp. baking powder made them any better than without it (which is my usual chocolate chip cookie recipe).

I was excited to try this recipe simply based on the other reviews, and I have to say I was disappointed. The cookies were flat, flat, flat...so I'm not sure if my baking powder is dead. The taste was mediocre and unimpressive. I've had better tasting chocolate chip cookies with the TollHouse recipe. I think I'll just stick to that.

I made these and I seems that they were gone before I knew it. I did however add 1/4 cup extra flour as the dough did seem real sticky. But they were the best!

My mistake (I'm a "beginner"): I think I overbeat the egg and sugar mixture....recipe said to beat until "fluffy".  I kept waiting for the fluffiness to happen, never did even after all my beating, instead I got a somewhat hard cookie, almost like a shortbread chocolate chip cookie, and one with an almost hard meringue type "coating". HOWEVER.  These were still  decent cookies which I would make again.  Only change I made was adding semi-sweet chocolate morsels which balanced out the overall sweetness of the cookie very nicely.

Good stuff.  My major improvisation was to add a quarter cup of coconut cream powder. (Look for Kara brand at Asian food stores. It is 80% coconut extract with starch, milk protein, and an emulsifier called E341.)  I also ran out of brown sugar (a common post-Thanksgiving problem for me), so I used mostly vanilla bean-infused white sugar.  Outstanding cookies resulted.  I made this recipe with a 9 year old, who was in charge of reading.  His big question was, "When do we add the chocolate chips??!!"  Oops, it seems that bit of information is missing from the instructions.  We did manage, however. Cheers!!

You're not wrong Becky.  I'd say these are definitely "Never Fail". I followed this recipe exactly and the result was a fluffy crispy cookie possibly because of the baking powder.

My 12 year-old daughter just made these (in fact, there's still a batch in the oven), and they turned out great!!! I wish we had more chocolate chips (not the recipes fault, we only had a small bag), but otherwise these are perfect. Very cake-like and golden.

This was WONDERFUL. i was asked to make some homemade chocolate chip cookies for a picnic.  i used this recipe without making any changes and friends didn't believe that they were homemade. they were good ednough to be marketed. Even days later they still taste as good as the day they were made.  but i did have to lightly grease the cookie sheet because they didn't come off so easily without it.
