I really love these and have made them for just about every get-together and people always ask me for the recipe.  HOWEVER, with that said, my recipe has been a little bit “tweaked” if you will.  First off, omit the sesame seeds and dried parsley.  Instead of 1-8 oz pkg of cream cheese, put in half a container (small tub) of cream cheese w/ chives and chop ¼ of an onion finely.  Season the chicken (you only need 2 breasts, not 6) with salt, pepper and garlic powder and cook it with the onions in a little of extra virgin olive oil.  When it’s done (and cooled slightly), chop chicken into little pieces, or shred and add the chicken and onion mixture to the cream cheese and mix well.  Then proceed with regular directions as far as stuffing and baking.  One thing though, if you want bite sized appetizers, simply put a small amount in each triangle vs. combing two to make a square.  Trust me, you and your guests will love it!

I used a 10oz can of chicken to make these really quickly, and that was a good amount of chicken.  I also seasoned to taste, adding cilantro, garlic pepper, and Mrs Dash.  I  softened the cream cheese in the microwave to make it really creamy and easy to mix.  I thought about adding some fresh chopped broccoli for crunch next time, but my husband said not to- he liked them just the way they were.  Overall, this recipe was quick, easy, and very rich-- it's not one for someone who doesn't like cream cheese!  HINT: leftovers heated in the microwave get a little soggy, so next time I'll reheat leftovers (if there are any!) in the oven.

Absolutely delicious!  My husband and children gobbled it right up.  (not to mention, the kids loved the name lol...)  I think next time I will add a bit of garlic salt.  It was a very easy, quick delicious lunch for us today.  Will definately make it again.  Thanks Cheryl!!  :)

These were pretty good.  I used fat free cream chees which I DO NOT recommend.  Next time I will use reduced fat or regular for a better flavor.  Also, I grilled the chicken with garlic seasoning for a little kick before adding it to the mixture.

Great idea, modified it works wonderful. I used quite a bit less chicken (2 breast worked fine) and shredded it. Also I added green onions (3).

My husband really liked these, but I found them too "heavy"  If I make these again I will cut the recipe in half and use smaller cream cheese balls in the crossant, making them more like an appetizer.

Fantastic recipe! My four year old daughter LOVED them and asked for them again! I made a few modifications based on what I had on hand: I used reduced fat cream cheese- worked great. I also reduced the amount of chicken and used refrigerated biscuits instead of the crescent rolls, but it worked great. I would love to serve these at a family brunch or dinner. I didn't read all the reviews, but has anyone tried making the filling and freezing it as a made-ahead meal? I think it would probably freeze well and be an inexpensive/easy go-to meal when time is an issue. 
I will be sharing this one with all my mom-friends! A great family friendly recipe!

First I need to say that 6 chicken breasts must be a mistake in the recipe, there is no way you could use six breasts.  I used three very small breasts with the rest of the ingredients and it was really over filling for four popovers.  I didn't have minced onion, but did put in about 1/2 tablespoon of minced garlic.  These were pretty good, but I will tweak it a bit before I make it again, however, we did like them so I will be making them again.  I think I will try adding some spinach and mushrooms next time.

This was very easy and very tasty.  I made them for a small dinner but they could make a great lunch item too.  The changes I made were:  I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and onion powder and cooked it in olive oil until it was done.  I shredded it and added a touch of salt to the whole mixture.  I only used 2 chicken breasts and had plenty of meat.  If you don't like cream cheese you probably won't like this but I don't think it had an overpowering taste of cream cheese.  Will definitely make again. Thank you!

I like this recipe so much. My kids loved it.
I used reduced fat cresent rolls. Used red onion
and added garlic. No sesame seeds, just didn't have any.  Very good and easy too. We had a spinach salad with the popovers for dinner.
Thanks Cheryl

I have made a similar recipe before.  We are not fans of sesame seeds, so I omit them.  I do add 1/4 cup crumbled bacon bits, 1/4 cup cheddar cheese, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and I add Tastefully Simples Bacon Bacon.

So good for a weeknight meal!  I like to use a little less chicken and add in about 1/2 cup frozen peas instead.  Comforting and good.

These are a regular in our craving rotation.  The sweet crescent rolls ans savory chicken are a great blend. With endless possibilities for adding your own spicy flair.

Easy and tasty! Doubled the recipe, left out the onion, sesame seeds, and parsley, and used the 8 ounce soft cream cheese in a tub, but only used half each of a tub of onion and chive and regular. Also used two 12 ounce cans of chunk chicken. Threw in a little garlic and herb Mrs Dash. Baked for 20 minutes. Household says it can go into rotation. :)

I made this recipe last night with some ingredients I had on hand.  I used a small package of frozen spinach thawed and squeezed the excess water off.  Used skim ricotta cheese, chives and onion cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese, a package of Lipton’s dried onion mix and 8 oz of fully cooked chopped ham.  I didn’t measure anything.  I just kind of put it all together and knew what kind of consistency I wanted.  I used half of a package of crescent rolls.  This made four little popovers to serve two people.  I used a round scoop to put the filling in the dough and that worked out well.  I enjoyed this because it took less than 15 minutes to put it all together and get it in the oven.  I served it with some microwave steam fresh vegetables and it was a nice healthy dinner.  Adding spinach to the filling was a great way to get my family to eat more vegetables.  We are working on projects in the house this week so we needed something quick and this was perfect.  I saved the filling to use another night this week.  I believe I had enough filling left over to make about eight more popovers.

My family loves this!  Very versatile recipe - after making it the first time I got creative.  I've added vegies, mushrooms, varied spices, etc. 
I only use the equivalent of 2-3 chicken breasts, and 1/2 the cream cheese.  I have used the canned chicken but prefer to cook and chop the chicken into pieces.  Cooking is either boiling or grilling the chicken.  Must remember to spread the crescent rolls out into a square or larger rectangle before filling and then stretch the opposite angles over the top.  Yes, these are large - they can make the entire meal with vegies in the filling or a side salad.

I made these day for a small luncheon and they were a hit.  I didn't follow this recipe exactly but followed CYNSIN2003's review and changes.  Easy to make and filling.  Perfect with a salad and a glass of sweet tea!

I seemed to have too much filling and my popovers were huge. I even had to use two canisters of the cresent rolls. I think next time I'll figure out a way to make these little chicken packages with only one triangle of the crescent rolls. Other than that, I shredded boneless chicken thighs and it came out very good!

This was delicious! I made extra, kept the chicken mixture refrigerated, and had fresh popovers for lunch the next day. Mmmm.

I modified it just a bit.  I added little pieces of cooked bacon to the filling and green onion.  I skipped the minced onion.  It was absolutely delicious.  Bacon seems to make everything taste so much richer and better.

I chopped the chicken into bite-size pieces, cooked it with a little sesame oil and minced onion.  I also added green chilies to the mixture.  The first batch I made w/2 triangles but popovers came out huge, more like a hot pocket. I made the rest of the the batch with 1 triangle and they were plenty big.  My husband really liked them, I will make this again.  It is a little time consuming.

These were okay. I really thought they were going to be better.  I definitely agree with whoever said 6 chicken breasts is too much.  I used 2 cans of chicken I had on hand and thought even that was way too much.  I actually had to use 2 packs of crescent rolls in order for all the mixture to be used up.  I added some garlic salt to the mixture and the taste was okay.  I think the 1 tbs. of minced onion was a little overpowering though.  I think I'd definitely make these again for something quick, but I'd do a lot of tweaking.  I think it would also taste pretty good with maybe chopped ham or some other kind of meat and other spices.  Good base recipe though.

This is wonderful and the recipe is so flexible.  How wrong can you go when cream cheese is involved? After reading other's comments, I realized that I could really play with what I had on hand. After taking the chicken out to cook, I realized that I only had one breast, but I had a package of pre sliced mushrooms that I wanted to use, so I sauteed them with the onion, a little dried basil and garlic powder.  I mixed in the cream cheese after so that it would melt, and then after boiling and cubing up the chicken I stirred that in.  I put each of the 2 triangles = square into one of each of the four corner muffin tin spots.  Baking time was 12 minutes, just like the crescent roll directions stated.  I could have added sherry to the saute; next time I'll consider using some seafood-very adabtable and filling. A keeper!  Thanks.

I put this on a Boboli and it worked well, but was somewhat dry - oh, and I added three cloves of garlic and some freshly diced roma tomatoes on top.  Yum!

This is a really good recipe. They are pretty rich, but good. Next time I will make these bite-sized so you get the flavor without being over-powering (I liked them enough to eat an entire puff, but my husband thought they were too strong, so only ate a bite or two). Thanks for the idea!

I made appetizers out of this by pressing cresent dough into mini-muffin tins and filling it with the chicken mixture. My guests loved it. I mixed some canned chopped tomatoes with green chilies into half the batch and they loved that too.

I did not like these at all!  There is way too much filling for the crescent rolls, and it's far too rich.  My sister and husband also thought they tasted weird.

Ok first - you do not need six chicken breasts. I used one 6 ounce breast at it was plenty. For those of you who would rather have a more meaty filling, two chicken breats would be more than enough. I really didn't seen the need for piecing two crescents together, so I kept them in triangles and just put a smaller amount of filling in each and rolled them up as you normally would crescents. The filling is way too much for one cane of crescents. I suggest cutting the recipe in half, or using two cans to use up all the filling. These were not particularly flavorful. They pretty much just tasted like a crescent with cream cheese filling. I would suggest if you try making these, add more of whatever seasoning suits you.

I thought this recipe was good. I will definitely make it again. I also tweaked it by simmering the chicken chunks in a garlic teriaki sauce and I added some canned mushroom slices. I didn't have the sesame seeds but I will get some for next time. I like that you can change this up alot.

I made these because my teenage son LOVES anything in a crescent roll.  The recipe has alot of potential, however, I thought they were bland.
Too much filling for the amount of crescent rolls called for.  I liked the sesame seeds..nice texture, and I added fresh chives from my garden.  With some *twicking* this could be a very inventive appetizer.  Just needed more zing for me....the kid finished them off!

It was okay - a quick and easy soccer-mom meal.  I made a few changes, though.  I boiled the chicken and then pulled it apart.  I halved the recipe,  and this made the perfect proportions for one package of crescent rolls.  Doubling the amount of filling for only one package of crescent rolls would have made it so there was not much filling.  When I was mixing the filling together, I thought that 3 chicken breasts would make it too dry, so I only added 2.  I also substituted one whole shallot for the minced onion, and this made it very flavorful.

I really enjoyed this recipe, although I made a few modifications so I could use it as an appetizer!  I used 10 oz of chicken and 5 oz of cream cheese, I also separated the rolls into triangles to make for smaller portions.  Everyone loved it though and asked for the recipe, thanks so much!
