I wanted to try this, but did not want it to be like "dip" -- after reviewing comments and suggestions, I made the following changes and WoW! was it good! It was more like the casserole I was hoping it would be.  First, I used corn tortillas instead of flour (I read too many comments about flour tortillas turning to paste) I used cream of celery soup (a favorite)instead of chicken. I cooked the chicken using taco seasoning for chicken and added about 1c corn and 3/4c black beans once the chicken was fully cooked.  I also eliminated 1/2 of the sour cream and used a lite version.  It came out delicious and can't wait to experiment further.  Thanks for all the suggestions, they were very helpful!

Would definitely DEFINITELY make again.  Guests loved it.  I did make 2 changes: one, I spread a little layer of refried beans on the chicken and left out the kidney beans; two, when I was stir frying the sliced chicken, I added a little water and a package of taco seasoning to the chicken for xtra flavor.  Wow, was it absolutely fantastic!

Oh my goodness!  This was SO delicious that I don't even have words to do it justice.  My husband loved it, I loved it, and I will definitely be adding this to my "will make again" list.  The only change I made (if you can call it a change) was using chipotle salsa instead of your standard run-of-the-mill salsa.  Turned out FANTASTIC!  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.  It's a great find for all who stumble upon it.

This dish quickly became a family favorite. My Italian Father-In-Law doesn't like mexican food of any kind, but he LOVES this. I have served this dish for many, many dinner guests in my home, but I have also prepared it for friends that have just had surgery or were ill. Now, it is the most requested meal from my friends and family. Very easy to prepare and sure to become your family's favorite as well.

I used light sour cream to cut back a little on the calories, I don't really think it affected the taste of this casserole too much, though I think 16 oz. of sour cream was WAY too much, and also 4 cups of cheese was excessive. I think 8 oz. of sour cream and 2-3 cups of cheese would have made it a lot better and wouldn't have masked the taste of the beans and the salsa. This wasn't very spicy, so if you like that-you may want to add some diced tomatos and chilies. I probably will alter it like this when I make it again.

This a good recipe. I did change it a little. I used half the sour cream, cream of celery soup, 3 cups of cheese and I omited the chili beans. I also added black beans and corn and replaced the flour tortillas with corn. Ok I guess I changed it more than a little, but overall this is a great recipe and was a big hit. Thanks

This casserole has become a staple in our family.  I never use the whole can of cream of chicken though because it has a tendency to overwhelm the mixture.  Other than that - perfect!

This is a great recipe and my husband loves it!  It's easy to prepare and very hearty.  I switched to corn tortillas instead of flour because I thought the flour ones turned out with a slimy texture.  I also use "hot" chili beans and top with a few sliced jalepenos because we like spicy food!

I love this stuff and didnt change a thing! Soo super good, oh my goodness, the leftovers are in some ways better. It kind of "melds" the flavors together. I look forward to making this and having it for lunch the next day! If your a beef eater, my mom and dad love this with ground beef in place of chicken. Keep that in mind, for a different taste also.

I have been fixing this dish since 2006 and realized I had never written a review on it...so here goes!  This IS my family's all time fave.  We have exchange students from all over the world and this is also the dinner they request time & time again.  After making it so many times, I have come up with some worthwhile shortcuts & tips.  1) I use chicken tenders that I cook in the microwave ahead of time and cool completely (I got tired of burning my fingers while shredding hot chicken, but don't over cook it!) 2) add the chicken to the entire soup mixture and mix...I didn't see any benefit in not doing this and it skips a step while assembling the layers  3) add a can of chopped green chilies (yum) and/or chopped jalapenos if you like a little heat 4) try using black beans instead of chili beans 5) I always have to cook this about 15 minutes more than the recipe calls for  6) let it stand before serving, although in my house that never happens.  It is runny if you don't let it rest, but my family doesn't care...they can't wait to eat it!  This is simply thee best!

As written, this is rather soupy.  I made this using homemade pinto beans instead of canned, about 3/4 cup each of the sour cream and salsa, and the one can of soup.  Still it was a little on the soupy side.  I used corn tortillas as they provide an excellent authentic Mexican flavor over the flour tortillas.  I layered the tortillas on the bottom of the pan, added the shredded chicken, spooned the mixture of the rest of the ingredients over the top of the chicken and spread evenly with the back of the spoon, topped with the shredded cheese (I used less than the recipe called for), then I repeated the layers and baked as directed.  This is very mild as written and kids will like it if they enjoy this type of flavor.  I served a spicy queso on the side for those of us that wanted to kick up the flavor.  If I make this again, I'll cut back on the ingredients even more so it's not runny and I'll add some diced green chilies or use a hot salsa for more of a kick.

I hope people read the reviews on this one before making it.  It's a good list of ingredients but the measurements need to be modified.  I reduced the amount of salsa and sour cream to about 3/4 cup of each.  An 8 oz. can of chili beans would not be enough - definitely use the regular 15 oz. size.  I used corn tortillas and did not cut them into strips.  I covered the bottom of my pan with 4 tortillas and layered with the filling ingredients and then another layer of tortillas, etc.  I used up all the filling ingredients in 2 layers so stopped there.  I added a can of chopped green chiles and some frozen corn to the filling. Cut the amount of cheese WAY down!  I only used about 1 1/2 cups all together and it was plenty cheesy.  I liked the mix of flavors but even with the decreased amount of sour cream it was still a bit goopy.  I think I'll try again and add in a couple cups of cooked rice and some black beans to thicken it up a bit.  Still it was very tasty with the mods.

This recipe is ok, but I had to reinvent it to my liking. Instead of salsa, I used a can of Diced Tomatoes w/Chiles & instead of flour tortillas I used Corn Tortilla Chips.  The chips cooked really well & made it easy to slice & serve.  The chicken needed a bit of seasoning & I reduced the sour cream to 8oz, ommited the beans & topped with enchilada sauce.

Delicious!  Added some black beans and plucked meat off a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store (good project for the boyfriend to speed dinner along).  Spice it up to your tastes.  We served w/ some chipotle taco sauce and it was awesome!

I made this for about 7 of my friends for a ladies only dinner. I have to say it was a hit and it was so easy! I made the chicken in the crock pot with salsa on low for about 6 hours. Than I shredded it. I also did not use a chunky salsa I used a normal one. I also used smaller tortillas and just did exactly what the recipe said. I don't think the size on the tortilla shells matter. I will for sure be making this again.

This was really good.  I used enchilada sauce instead of the jar of salsa, and that gave it a nice kick.  I would recommend cooking the chicken in the taco seasoning, as commented in another review first.  Can't wait to have it for lunch today!!!!!

This was a little bland for my taste. I thought substituting peperjack for half of the cheese and a layer of refried beans would make this dish a little bit more satisfiying. Also you could easily cut down the chicken breast to 4 instead of 6.

Love this recipe! I have made it several times according to the recipe. This time I didn't have salsa or chili beans, so I added a can of Mexican style stewed tomatoes and a can of chili with beans to the soup mixture. Left the sour cream out of the sauce. Then served from the oven garnished with a dollop of sour cream, sliced olives and minced green onion. Yummy!

Wonderful recipe.  I seasoned my chicken with the Taco Season I recipe from this site (way better than the store bought).  I poured 1/2 a cup of salsa in the bottom of my crock pot for moisture and then placed 3 frozen seasoned chicken breasts in it.  I cooked this on low for 5 hours.  I halved the recipe to begin with and I had to make changes but only b/c of what I had on hand.  I used lite sour cream and less than called for since it was all I had.  I also used low fat soup and I had very little onion,so I used what I had and then added a tsp onion powder.  To this I added black beans(no chili beans in the cabinet) and a can of drained mexi-corn.  Because so many reviews said the tortillas turned out soggy, I used a couple extra to make sure the strips were layered thick enough.  I also mixed 1 cup of cheese and 1 cup 2% cheese together for a few less calories.  Baked as directed in an 8x8 pan and it turned out a fantastic meal.  Served simply with a side salad.  Delisious, filling and no soggy tortillas.

Like some of the other reviewers, I added my own touch to this recipe and it turned out BEAUTIFULLY and was INHALED!  I used black beans instead of chili beans.  I added corn.  I also made a batch of spanish rice and input it in the layers as well.  I did not add the sour cream to the salsa mixture, but put it on the side for addition later with guacamole.  I also added one small can of mild diced green chilis to the salsa mixture.  

This was wonderful!  Thanks Anya!

I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 b/c it had to be modified.  Based on recommendations from the other reviewers, I think this recipe turned out great!  I used 8oz sour cream instead of 16oz (which would have been way too much), 3 cups cheese instead of 4, and 3 frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I also cooked the chicken in my slow cooker on high for 2 hrs before shredding it.  I poured the salsa into the bottom of the slow cooker, then sprinkled half a packet of taco seasoning on both sides of the chicken breasts (1/4 packet on each side).  Then I removed the chicken to shred it and added the salsa into the sour cream mixture as described in the recipe.  I think the taco seasoning gave it some good flavor.  I would recommend 2 cans of chili beans for those who really like beans, but 1 can was just right for us.  Will definitely be making this again :)

My grandmother-in-law gave me this recipe years ago and we've always loved it.  Everyone we've ever served it to has asked for the recipe.  The leftovers are great, if you're even lucky enough to have anything left over to save!

this was very good. I used black beans instead of chilli beans, and corn tortillas.  the next day when we had it as leftovers, and it was even better.  it's one of those meals that tastes better after it solidifies overnight.

I made this for my husband and his father and they seemed to like it.  They didn't jump for joy but did say that it was a keeper.  I added taco seasoning to my shredded chicken and it really helped the flavor.  I personally loved it! EASY TOO!

Very good recipe.  I will make this again for sure.  The only thing I would change is I would mix the chicken with sour cream mixture.

Overall I felt that the recipe had potential for my picky family, I took under consideration some of the other reviews and made some changes that turned out to be a wonderful recipe that I will make for years to come. I mixed together 8oz of sour cream, 1 can of cream of chicken soup 1 14.5 can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, 1 can of enchilada sauce, a pinch of cayenne pepper for the sauce layered it alternating between diced chicken, tortilla chips, and mexican cheese. Absolutely wonderful. I made it for my picky college freshman son. By the time I returned home an hour later  my son related to me that the casserole was practically gone.

This was very good.  My husband told me three times how much he liked it before he finished his dinner.  I sprinkled tortilla chip pieces on top.

I really enjoyed this recipe A LOT!  However, my husband said he didn't think the flavor was what he expected, and that although it tasted all right, it also made him sick to his stomach for some reason.  If I make this again, it will be just for me, because I really did like it.

Used crushed dorritos to layer the bottom and used corn tortillas for the rest. For extra flavor I simmer chicken in some beer, chicken broth, juice of one lime, garlic, red pepper and a dash of chilli powder. The beer lends a wonderful taste (drain) and is a terrific tenderizer. The other seasonings make it pop when baked with casserole. Of course  I use beer in most Tex Mex food thats calls for chicken. Thanks for sharing

Excellent - used 4 frozen chicken breasts cooked in the Crockpot for 5 hours. Then shredded the chicken and added a little cumin and a lot of onion powder. Then I combined 8 ounces of light sour cream, 16 oz medium picante sauce, 1 8 oz bag low fat cheese and 2/3 of an 8 oz bag of regular cheddar cheese, 1 can of healthy Campbell’s cream of celery soup, 1 can of Bush's canned chili beans drained.  Instead of the flour tortillas I used 12 6" corn tortillas cut in strips and made 3 layers.  Cooked covered 40 minutes at 350 degrees. Then cooled 15 min before cutting.  Topped with sour cream and jarred chopped jalapenos.  This tasted just like chicken enchiladas without all the work.  Will definitely make again.

I used corn tortillas instead of flour and added a can of corn to the mix as well. It was soooooo delicious! It reheats really well and would be a great casserole to freeze.

This turned out fantastic.  Everyone loved it.  I did follow a couple of the suggestions from other reviews.  I used only 8 oz. of sour cream and I used corn tortillas instead of flour.  Also, instead of the jar of salsa, I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chili as well as added 2 Tbsp. each of cumin and chili powder.  And instead of chili beans, I used black beans.  One suggestion, don't be afraid to kind of double up on the tortilla layer.  It soaked up the juices and made a very nice texture.

We have now made this at least 15 times and have traded off the types of beans. My preference is 1 can of chili beans and 1 can of black. My hubby prefers refried beans in this recipe. Any bean you have will work - we've tried them all. We use 1/2 flour and 1/2 corn tortilla strips and alternate them. We tried all corn but missed the texture the flour gives. I always make two as they don't mind eating it the next day for lunch since they love it so much. Serve with tortilla chips and a green salad (Mexican style is best). We cut up avocado cubes for people to put on top.

I've never made Enchilada's before.  I found this recipe quite easy to prepare.  All our guests went for more than one helping and raved about it.  They said it was the best they have ever eaten.  I agree. I followed the recipe completely except I only used half a jar of salsa because I used a hot salsa, which made the Enchilada a little spicy but too much.  I'll be making this dish quite often.

I thought this was ok, my husband and 7 yr. old loved it and has seconds.  for me there was too much salsa taste, next time I will not use as much, I used a organic smoked chipolte flavored one and did not add the beans for my child who will not eat a bean but did add some green chiles which was a good addition.  used the mexican 4 cheese blend too.

This one wasn't so good.  I thought there was too much cheese (4 cups!), too much chicken, and it was really saucy, so my tortillas got soggy and even kind of starchy by the next day.  It sounded good when I read the recipe, but somehow the proportions just don't seem right.  Even the flavor didn't really grab me so I'd call this one edible, but less than mediocre.

It's SOOOO easy to make and I have made this many times and everyone loves this.  We too think that it tastes better "the next day" after everything sits together...so I've taken to mixing all the ingredients the night before and letting it sit and marinate before I cook the casserole the next day.  Always turns out great and mine has never been runny.  I do use corn tortillas and sometimes an assortment of cheeses (cheddar, monteray jack, colby, etc.)  Instead of shredding which takes me forever, I cube into small pieces and it works just fine too.  What a great tasting recipie though!  Easy to make spicy or leave mild...I also use reduced fat sour cream and cream of chicken soup...always turns out great!  A+ recipie!

Just made this for supper and it got rave reviews! I had to make a few substitutions based on what I had but still turned out great and slightly healthier.  I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream and black beans instead of chili beans.  (By the way, the cream mixture would make a great chip dip!) I also seasoned the chicken breasts with taco seasoning while they were cooking.  All my guys in the house went back for seconds.

This was very good and easy to make.   Because I was cooking this for just my husband and me, I knew there would be leftovers (and actually I think I preferred this meal when reheating it!). Because I read some reviews about the flour tortilla getting soggy (especially with left over portions), I omitted the tortillas while baking, and then we took the end result and wrapped them in tortillas for dinner.  This is also very good with corn tortilla chips instead of the flour tortillas. My husband preferred the flour tortillas while I preferred the corn chips. By omitting the flour tortillas in the casserole itself, he can eat his portion with what he likes and I can eat mine with the corn chips! :)

This was very good!  I never seem to follow a recipe exactly.  I take what I like and tweek it, make it my own.  But I review only on the original recipe.  If I don't like my end result, it wouldn't be fair to blame the recipe.  That being said, I did make changes to this one.  First of all, I fried the cut strips of CORN tortillas in canola oil because I hate the gumminess of a baked flour one.  I cut the sour cream back to 8 oz. and used 3 chicken breasts since this was only serving 4.  I also baked my chicken in water, seasoned with garlic powder, seasoned salt, pepper and taco seasoning.  I mixed the sour cream, salsa, cream of chicken soup, onion and shredded chicken together.  Placed the crispy tortillas in a sprayed 9x13 pan.  Topped with the chili beans, and spread the chicken mixture on top.  I topped it off with 2 cups of shredded cheddar, covered with foil and baked for 25 minutes at 350F.  My husband and sons loved it as did I.  Because I think those little changes made it a 5 star recipe, I only gave this one a 4.  I just know that we wouldn't have liked the flour tortillas as much, and frying them made them even crispier, which was the only big change to the recipe.

A new favorite that everyone loved!  I read the reviews and used only half the sour cream and half the salsa.  Agree on the sour cream but it needed the salsa or more tomatoes which I served on the side (as suggested) and everyone used some.  After reading about the unattractive pink sauce, I combined only the soup and sour cream; and added the salsa to the cooked chicken (seasoned with 1/2 packet of Lawry's Chicken Taco seasoning.)  I used nice thick layers of flour tortillas, layered the chicken/salsa mixture, sprinkled some corn, dotted the soup/sour cream mixture, then spread it around evenly, then the shredded cheese.   It worked perfectly!  My daughter doesn't like onions or beans so I left them out.  I tried the suggested plain crushed Doritoes on mine and loved it.  This is the MOST VERSATILE recipe I have ever found!  Definitely a keeper!

This is a really good and simple recipe. I only made minor changes. I used a rotissere chicken from the supermarket and shredded it for the sake of time. I also took the advise from other reviews and added taco seasoning to the chicken and substituted corn tortillas for the flour. Will definitely make again!

This just came out of the oven and the aroma was so heavenly we could not wait!  After reading some of the reviews, some changes were made.  I used 8 ounces sour cream, corn tortillas and added black beans and shoe peg corn in place of the chili beans.  I did not have boneless chicken, but stewed chicken breasts in chicken broth with green chiles and ground red pepper.  Shredded the chicken and mixed with a packet of taco seasoning.  Mexican cheese blend was substituted for the cheddar cheese.  I also omitted the onions.  This one is a keeper!

This casserole was pretty good & I like the fact that there aren't too many ingredients. Definitly use fresh salsa instead of jarred for a better taste. I used less than 1/2 of the cream of chicken soup because that flavor seems to take over if you use too much in my opinion.  I used fat free tortillas, fat free sour cream,& mozzerella cheese to make the recipe low fat.  I will make again. : )

Great recipe and makes alot! To cut down on fat, I used lowfat cream soup, lite sour cream and only used 3 c. cheese. I did add more onion because 1/4 c. does not seem like enough for such a large dish. Even with my lowfat version, this came out delicious. Next time I will cook the chicken in taco seasoning like another reviewer mentioned and add a little garnish like green onion and/or sliced black olive on top.

I wanted to say that this came out delicious.  I substituted black beans for the chili beans, and it was outstanding.  Also, I used green chile enchilada sauce instead of adding salsa to the filling mixture and it was very good.  When I served it we topped it with sour cream and salsa then and it couldn't have been better.

This one is great! I've made it over 5 times now and its a big hit with my boyfriend. When he says, "Make this one anytime you feel like it" I know its good. I have varied the types of beans and used different salsas. It's always outstanding.

Like others I added hot salsa, olives, and chopped jalapenos. I also omitted the beans. 
Very good. Although the texture was a little strange.

In the last 3 weeks I've made 8 different casseroles for a sick friend; all the recipes were from your website. This was by far the best-tasting. I also added only half the cheese (2 cups instead of 4) and used lowfat sour cream and low sodium soup. Also, a 15-oz. can of beans instead of 8 oz. Awesome!! This one's a keeper for us.

Excellent recipe.  I made a few changes to make it a bit more authentic. I used corn tortillas, added 2 fresh chopped jalapenos, and black beans instead of chili beans.  I also have experimented with different types of salsa.  Don't be afraid to change it up!

I read all the reviews for this recipe and actually opted to impliment some on my first try...I too used 1/2 the sour cream (8oz). I used a rottisserie chicken that I cooked in taco seasoning and water. I used cup up corn tortillas, 1 can of black beans, 1 can of Bush's Chili Beans, sm can of sliced black olives, cr of chic soup, 2 cups of shredded Cabot Cheddar cheese and a 16 oz jar of Frontera Medium Salsa. All in all a good recipe. It was a little more calorie laden than I usually like but a good "comfort food!"

Loved this meal.  Changed it according to what I had.  Didn't have any condensed soup but combined 2 chix breasts (cooked and shredded) with 2 cups black beans, 1/2 med onion, 2 garlic cloves and 1/2 jalapeno pepper diced and sauteed with 1/2 Tbsp chili powder, 3/4 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp each oregano and paprika and 1/2 tsp salt and pepper. Used this as the chicken layer, than combined 1.25 cups tomatillo salsa with 1/2 cup sour cream and used as sour cream layer.  For cheese, used tex mex shredded blend - 2 cups total was fine for whole recipe.  Corn tortillas instead of flour worked well.  Made only 2 layers of each ingredient and the above amounts filled an 11x7 pan.  Next time will make a 9x13 so there are lefovers!

Following several peoples' suggestions, made alterations to the recipe...used lowfat sour cream and soup, cutting the cream and salsa amounts in half.   Used black beans, a dozen corn tortillas and the equivalent of 4 chicken breasts.  I ended up crumpling up tortilla chips on the top along with the last cup of cheese during the last 10 minutes of baking.  It was delicious and not too soupy!

Really good, I used a 14oz can of kidney beans to make it a little thicker and cooked the chicken with taco seasoning. Next time I wil crumble some tortilla chip on top before baking for a little crunch.

This had good flavor but boy is it fattening.  And while I like a good stick to your ribs meal, this was a bit much.  I prefer my enchiladas with more red or green enchilada sauce and less sour cream.

This ended up very good. I took up of the suggested changes by another user and it turned out pretty good. The only thing I would change next time is that I will use tortilla chips or doritos instead of tortillas to add a little chunch to the dish.

Awesome recipe. I did change it a bit...but my version came out 5 stars. First, I did half salsa and half cream of chkn, and added a half can of enchilada sauce. I did 3/4 of the 16 oz. sour cream,did black beans instead of chili beans, corn tortillas instead of flour. I added taco seasoning to the chkn like everyone said and added some black olives and chile's to the sour cream mix. It turned out soooo yummy! My dad and husband said multiple times how good it was!!! Will make again..and again...

We left the tortillas out of the dish and served the casserole wrapped up in them instead, as a filling. Incredible! Sooo cheezy and delicious, and great reheated with chips!

Very delicious! I made a few modifications to the recipe.  I used corn tortillas and didn’t cut them into strips, and black beans.  Instead of salsa, I used 2 cans of Mexican style Rotel. I drained one can, of the rotel before adding to the mixture Also I used FF Cream of chicken soup and 2% cheese so it would be a little lighter. Paired with Uncle Ben’s Mexican rice and refried beans. Nice quick filling meal with leftovers that taste even better the next day!

I was doubtful, but this was surprisingly yummy.  I was looking for a way to use leftover roast chicken and this was a winner.  Used medium salsa and the spice kick was just about right.  The casserole fed a family of 6 (2 teenage boys included!  ha ha) and not a bite was left.  Definitely a keeper and easy, easy, easy...threw the whole thing together in about 10 minutes.

I traded the salsa for green enchalada sauce, omitted the onions, and put in about half of the sour cream. It was fabulous!! My husband can't wait for me to make it again.

This was excellent.  I added a can of chopped green chiles (might do jalapenos next time for more kick), half a can of "mexicorn," and used fat free refried beans.  I also used fat free sour cream and cheese and healthy request soup (only used half a can of that).  Cooked chicken in the crock pot with taco seasoning all day, then was able to throw this all together in minutes.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

Very good and easy to make.  While mixing up the salsa & soup, etc., it didn't look too appetizing so I wondered how it would go over with the husband.  I covered the top layer with salsa so he couldn't see everything and it passed the test!  
Couldn't find chili beans at the local grocery store so subbed black beans as others had done.
Leftovers are good too!

It was good but it was more like a dip than anything else. If we were to make it again we would include tortilla chips and maybe less sour cream and more beans.

I used two chicken breasts I had cooked in crockpot the day before and leftovers from a previous Mexican meal to make this dish.  My husband loved it! I reduced the ingredient measurements to 1/3 the recommended and made a dish that fed us very well for two days.  Easy.  Plus, you may already have many of these ingredients at home!  I can't wait to share it with everybody I know!  YUM!

YUM YUM YUM.. I love this recipe as my children do as well.  I do leave out the beans and onions and use picante sauce for the salsa and Colby/Monterrey cheese in place of the cheddar.  My kids always ask for seconds and ask to eat the leftovers the following night.  Therefore, I don't have to cook one night a week.  Definitely recommend!

Very good!  The beans make the whole recipe taste great!  We would recommend less sour cream, corn tortillas and HOT salsa.  If you like it extra spicy, add diced jalapenos!  Great flavor!

This recipe is great.  Family and friends love it.  I add green chilies to the mixture as well as top it off with sliced olives.  Seasoning the chicken with a taco seasoning is also a great idea.

This recipe is very easy to make. I've made it twice and the second time I made it with medium salsa and used taco seasoning on the chicken to give it some kick. Either way, it's now a favorite!

This is a really, really, good recipe.  Not too hard to make, my teenagers and husband loved it.  Plus, it makes enough for company and then some.  The only change I made was I used a 16 oz. can of beans and put more onion in it.  It was great!  Thanks!

This recipe just gets raves out the wazoo.  Pretty straightforward and it is a big favorite with family and friends.  This would be a great potluck dish!  I use homemade salsa to give it a little special touch and a splash of sriracha for kick!

Thank you for this; it's at the top of my recipe box for easy access!

All three of my children ages 7-11 LOVED this for dinner and that in itself is worth five stars in my book. PLUS my husband and I ate it for two days after. Served with tortilla chips, salsa and sour cream on the side. I will say I put in the oven without the cheese on top and ended up having to cook for  40 minutes than another 4 with cheese. My only slight complaint was it took more than double the time to prepare and cook but we'll worth it. I added 3/4 the cream of chicken and sour cream the recipe called for and added green chilies and corn tortillas. Can't write enough good things about this casserole. EXCELLENT!!

It is in the oven but I can already tell I will love it.  I did not have the right amount of sour cream so I softened some cream cheese and added a little bit of the chili sauce left over from draining the chili beans.  I added way less cheese to the casserole.

My mom started making this recipe several years ago.  It's been a trusty stand-by for the harvest workers, for new parents, and for "birthday" meals...we all love it!  I pretty much make the recipe "as is", but I don't understand how it could be done in 20-30 minutes!  It's a FULL 9X13 pan.  I cover it and bake for 1.25 hours, and then I uncover for 15 minutes.  Total bake time=1.5 hours.  We serve it with lettuce, salsa, and more sour cream.  It freezes well.

Next time, I'll add corn and try black beans... a great recipe that can be adjusted in so many ways!

I used what I Had in the house! Very flexible recipe!! That includes a 22oz can of smokehouse baked beans (added a delicious smokey flavor) 3/4 container sour cream and frozen chicken. The 2 large pieces of chicken were frozen in salsa so I let it cook in the crockpot all day and added that salsa to the recipe. I probably only had about 2 cups of cheese so I just added it on top. I Layered the tortilla like lasagna and threw away the smaller side pieces. Will make again

I made this for family dinner last night and everyone loved it. As recommended, I used corn tortillas instead of flour and added a can of green chilies. I poached the chicken and seasoned with taco seasoning to add a little more flavor. My mom and husband ate the leftovers for lunch today and said it tasted even better than last night. I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing.

I just served this casserole for dinner with a friend I hadn't seen in awhile.  I wanted to have something special to eat, so I decided to experiment with this recipe.  I'm soooo glad I took the risk.  It was really delicious!!!  I just made a few changes.  I didn't have any chicken on hand, so I used ground beef instead.  After I drained the ground beef I stirred in taco seasoning and 1 can of enchilada sauce.  I used corn tortillas instead of flour and I left them whole instead of cutting them into strips.  After I put a layer of ground beef down, I spread refried beans, then I put a layer of the sour cream mixture.  I only used half the container of sour cream, and I used onion powder instead of diced onions, because I was on a time crunch.  Other than that I left the sour cream mixture the same as the recipe.  I was a little nervous as I put it together, but it had a delicious flavor!!  Will definitely make again!

This recipe has been a huge hit and I have made it many times now. It is delicious and creamy. The only change I have made is that we usually add green chili into the mix. The pan usually makes a bit more then our small household will eat so we have it for dinner then put some in the fridge and freeze a chunk too for a later date and even then it taste great.

This was a very cozy meal for a cold weeknight!  I used about 4 cups of chicken leftover from a roasted chicken 2 nights before which added a lot of rich flavor.  I'm always looking for ways to make my recipes healthier since my husband has high cholesterol, so I cut out the cheese entirely  in the layers, adding only a sprinkle on top for aesthetics.  General consensus was that it did not detract from the meal ONE BIT.  I also used half-fat sour cream to bring down the saturated fat a notch.  Next time I make this recipe (it has already been requested that I do!!) I'm going to use fat-free Greek yogurt, and a reduced fat/sodium soup.  It can still be delicious while being more kind to your heart!!

This is definately a winner. I also cut down the amount of sour cream. I added black beans drained instead of chili beans and also whole kernel corn drained.

This was ok. My husband and I liked it, but the kids did not care for it. Probably more or less because of the unappealing appearance of the dish..lol

It was so easy and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have cream of chicken soup, so I just used cream of mushroom.  Will make again!  :)

Easy & tasty recipe.  I used a can of Rotel instead of the salsa as that is what I had on hand.  Definately a keeper: )

The best thing about this recipe is that it tastes GREAT THE WAY IT IS, but you can easily add/substitute ingredients to your own tastes.  Here's what I did:  I followed some of the suggestiongs and used half the sour cream, black beans instead of chili beans and corn instead of flour tortillas. I used a can of green chili peppers and monteray jack cheese instead of cheddar. After the chicken was shredded I added a splash of water and a packet of taco seasoning... I think it really enhanced the flavor of the chicken but it added a lot more salt than I'm comfortable with, so maybe I can find a healthier way to season the chicken.  This is my new go-to enchilada recipe. It takes 1/3 of the time it took me to make the traditional rolled-up dish and it tasted way better! My family loves it and asked if I can make it every week. (It's so easy, I could!)

The taste was OK, but the texture/presentation of this was just too unappealing.  I used corn tortillas, but otherwise didn't change anything.  My family ate it, but commented that they liked the Cottage Cheese Enchiladas (from this site) I made a couple of weeks ago MUCH better.

I was a little skeptical of such high ratings but this dish rocks! I also cooked the chicken in chicken taco seasoning and used corn tortillas. I tweaked it just a touch more by warming the tortillas on an open stove flame before slicing. Flip them back and forth a few seconds at a time until hot with a few blackened spots and they're perfect for a taco or your casserole.

This dish was ok.  I added chicken taco seasoning mix to the chicken while cooking for some extra flavor.  I felt like the consistancy of the sour cream mixture was a little funny but all in all it was a good dish.  Thank you for sharing!  :)

This wasn't fantastic but good and worth making again. I didn't have time to cook the onions ahead of time so I just left them out. I think some shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes on top after cooking would be really good. I'll try that next time.

There was WAY too much sour cream i this recipe.  My husband and I like enchiladas, but this  recipe overdid it.  I was very disappointed and didn't know enough to doctor it myself.

Sorry, I didn't like this as is. Wish I had read everyone's reviews first.   The Sauce and the Sour cream should be cut in half and corn tortillas would have worked way better.

GREAT RECIPE! My mom doesn't even really like mexican and she even went for seconds and thirds! Like many other reviewers, I made the following changes: 1. Only used 1/2 of the sour cream the original recipe calls for and used light sour cream. No taste difference there. 2. I added a a can of corn. 3. I used corn tortilla's instead of flour tortilla's. 4. After boiling and shreading the taco seasoning, I cooked it for about 3-4 minutes in a little bit of water and a package of taco seasoning. 5. I topped 1/2 of the dish with chopped pickled jalepenos because my husband and step father love spicey but my mom doesn't. The men absolutely loved the extra kick. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. A very easy recipe.. will definitely be making it again.

The taste is very good, but what would make this a 5 star recipe is to layer the salsa separately from the sour cream and soup mixture in the casserole. The weird pink color from mixing them together is not very appetizing. I ended up throwing some of it away which is a shame because it tasted fine.

Well, this was a big, sloppy mess of a casserole. A big, sloppy DELICIOUS mess. This really had great flavor and was a major comfort food kind of dish. The only things I changed were to toss the shredded chicken in a little bit of taco seasoning to add a little extra flavor and I used a mixture of shredded cheddar and sweet pepper cheeses. Thanks :)

LOVED THIS!!!!
Made it for a luncheon and didn't bring any home.
I did use some of the suggestions like adding corn and black beans and cutting back on the sour cream.
It couldn't have been easier or tasted better.  I like enchiladas but hate the hassle of "wrapping".  This you just throw together and still get the great flavor.
This recipe is a keeper!

Very good and easy to make.  I used only 2 C of cheese, cooked and cut up chicken, no onion and a whole can of beans and it still came out fantastic!  Will definitely make again.  This would be great to split and freeze 1/2 for a later date as it makes a lot and tends to be rich.

Excellent! I served it for my Bunco group and they loved it!! I have one friend that doesn't like onions, so I sauteed them before mixing them. I did use corn tortillas and they worked great. I agree with the other reviews it is very tasty the next day too.

Absolutely the BEST!!!!  I used corn tortilla's instead of flour and 2 cans black beans instead of chile.  These were the only alterations.  I think it would be good to add some rice as well. It was so good!!!

OMG!! This is going to be requested from my family ALL THE TIME! They loved it! Some even snuck back to steal the left overs :) By far one of my favorite recipes. Little soupy so it kinda flops on the plate but no one complained! I used Rotisserie chicken and it was so tender and yummy! Try it, it's worth it! Omited onion and it was wonderful! I'll make it every couple weeks...

Loved it!  The kids thought it looked gross, but once they tasted it, they all wanted seconds! I used Rotel instead of salsa, left out the onions (just because I don't like them), whole wheat tortillas, and canned chicken. Even with the canned chicken, it was great! By the way, this a great recipe for the kids to help with. They loved layering the items. Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband and I really enjoy this meal.  As a college student, it makes it very helpful to prepare a meal that can be doubled and then frozen for a later meal (we think it taste even better reheated!).  I did a few things different, though.  I actually made enchiladas out of this recipe.  Many people said that the tortillas became soggy after baking.  If you make the casserole version: quick fry your tortillas in oil and let them get just a little bit crispy.  You can also do this for regular enchiladas.  I cut the sour cream in half, added some chicken enchilada seasoning, medium spiced salsa, a can of Rotel (along with the other listed ingredients) and left out the onions.  I then poured some mild enchilada sauce on the bottom of a pan, rolled up my enchiladas (with the filling & cheese), placed them in the pan and then topped them with a medium enchilada sauce and the rest of the mild sauce and then garnished with cheese.  I baked it at 350F for about 30 minutes.  If you make enchiladas instead of the casserole, it makes about 20 medium sized enchiladas.  This is an easy recipe to make, which ever way you end up making it.  And it's a great way to be a little creative and adjust it to your taste.

Outstanding.  Thank goodness for reviews.  This would have been really good as written, however, hubby can't eat onions, so the rotel was perfect and I don't like chili beans so the black beans were perfect and adding taco seasoning to the chicken added just the right touch.  Thanks for a great recipe and thanks to the reviewers for great tips.

This is a good recipe, although I only gave it 4 stars because of changes I made.  To keep the tortillas from becoming soggy, I used corn tortillas and heated my skillet over medium high heat.  Then I sprayed PAM on there and crisped the torillas before cutting them into half moons.  This prevents them from becoming soggy. Also I used less salsa and sauteed the onions with the chicken.  Otherwise this is a great recipe!

THIS WAS A WINNER WITH MY FAMILY. EASY TO MAKE AND NOT TOO TIME CONSUMING. THE ONLY THING I SUGGEST WITH THIS RECIPE IS TO DECREASE THE ONION TO YOUR LIKING. THE SALSA YOU BUY ALREADY HAS ONIONS IN IT. THE TWO COMBINED MAKES FOR TOO MANY OINOINS IF YOUR NOT A BIG ONION FAN.

I made this for my bonco group & doubled the recipe thinking I would have leftovers.. Well, they loved it so much that I had to put some aside for one of the girls that was running a little late.. Otherwise,she would have never gotten any. It's a huge hit and I stuck to the recipe word for word, excpet for the chilli beans.I used black beans instead.

This is awesome.  Since most of the reviews stated that the tortilla's got kind of soggy I just left them out, baked the casserole and put it in the tortilla's when it was done.  This is the first new recipe I have tried that my husband actually loooved.  Usually he says it's o.k. (he's very picky).  My kids were so so with it but they did eat it.  They are also hard to please, which is why I visit this site.  So thanks for giving me something the whole family agrees on.  OH, yeah, my husband heated it up two days later and ate it with nacho's! Yummy.

This was pretty good.  I used corn tortillas and didn't cut them into strips.  I also used half of the suggested sour cream... there is no way you need more than that.  I added sliced olives which were delicious, and put some chives on top.  I also only used 2 cups of shredded cheese... I have no idea how you could even fit in 4 cups!  I also added black beans.  I think adding some green chilies would have been good.  I used medium salsa and it was just right.  This also is a bit saucy so I think it's best served with corn tortilla chips... you can sort of "dip" into it.

This was very good.  My husband and I really liked it.  I added a tablespoon of cumin and a small can of drained green chilies to the sour cream mixture.  I liked it better after you first cook it.  The leftovers next day were soggy and I am not a big fan of that.  I will make this again but only when we have company that way I know it will not go to waste.

We just had this tonight, and I'm stuffed! This is a very creamy, rich casserole, and I followed the instructions exactly, except I didn't cut the flour tortilla into strips, just placed them in whole. I also sprinkled fresh cilantro on top the servings. Lots of leftovers, so we'll be eating this tomorrow night too! Easy and tasty.

Thank you for this recipe.  We tried it out tonight and thought it was great.  We are health-conscious and used light sour cream, healthy request cream of chicken soup, and this was great.  It's like we didn't use healthy substitutes as it was scrumptious.  We used flour tortillas and regular shredded cheddar cheese which we will substitute with fat-free next time (I don't think it's ever the same if you use fat-free cheese!).  I would also cook the onions a few minutes before we put it in the mix.  Husband would omit beans (and he's a bean lover).  I asked why and he said he didn't think the texture fit in it.  He also added a can of green chiles.  Okay, thanks again!  We're keeping it.  Asianmama

This was okay.  Definetely lacks something and the onion was a little too overpowering. Probably won't be making this again.

Pretty good. I mixed the chicken with all the sour cream mixture which worked well. A little too much sour cream, but it tastes great cold!

This was extremely good but a little time consuming to make. My husband and I like food spicy so I added extra red peper flakes and used spicy chunky salsa. It really made the dish HOT and we were both piling on the sourcream. I also made quacamolie for a topper. Very very good and will make again.

This dish came out excellent. I used some of the suggestions like using corn tortillas, black beans, using less sour cream and cheese and adding chilies to spice it up. It turned out to be the best enchilada recipe I've made. Great!

I actually liked this dish better as leftovers.  It was a little too soupy for the first round, but after being refrigerated, it firmed up.  The taste was a lot better after a few days, also.  I did cook the chicken in the taco seasoning first, as other reviewers has suggested.  I also added half a 4 oz. can of chopped green chiles in the sour cream mixture -- just enough to give it a little something extra.  My husband liked it -- he said it wasn't phenomenal, but a good casserole overall.  He even made those "Mmmmmm...." noises for me!  I will probably make it again, since it was so easy, but I will make it a day or so ahead of time for the best results.

This was okay but I don't think I will make it again.  It was pretty rich.  I didn't add the beans.  Maybe that would have made it better.  I had leftovers of it the next day and they were better than when I had it for dinner the night before.  I am a huge Mexican food person...this one just didn't do it for me.

This was great!  I only had the 6 inch tortillas so I used 8, used a 15oz can of beans and right around half the cheese.  Also used reduced fat sour cream and soup.  Tasted great, picky husband loved it!!!  Next time I'm going to try it with hamburger.  Thanks!

Tasted great.  To save time, I'll use the food processor to shred the chicken 
instead of doing it manually.  Will definitely make again!

I used a 'salsa verde' instead of the regular salsa, so mine wasn't pink! Very good though.

Let me start by saying that I am a 23 year old bachelor who usually sticks to cooking frozen pizzas.  But I really wanted to impress this girl at work, so I made this for a mexican potluck.  Everybody absolutely loved it, and I got myself a date for the weekend.  This is very easy and so very tasty.  If you like it a little spicier, I added so Jalapeno to half of it and the sweetness of the pepper came out great.  I suggest that everyone give this a try.  Oh, and don't forget to drain the beans.  I forgot and it still turned out great, but it would have been a little less gooey.  I loved the color of the sauce..pink.  Bon Appetit!

This recipe is VERY rich and creamy.  My boyfriend couldn't get enough of it and we're having the leftovers tonight.  I substituted some low-fat products (sour cream & half of the cheese) and it tasted fabulous.  Will definately be making this again.

Delicious. I learned from MY mistake and next time, I will not add soup instead of sour cream (which I didn't have). Mine came out way too loose  - too soupy - as I used two cans - but that 's MY error. I used corn tortillas (what I had) and I have made a casserole similar to this one, but using flour tortillas. The corn is superior, I think. This is an outstanding recipe and deserves a five-star rating.( Next time, I'll be patient to make it and be sure to have the proper ingredients.)

Amazing! I made a couple minor changes: I used rotisserie chicken breast (because I'm too lazy to cook chicken breast myself) and threw it in the skillet with a pack of taco seasoning. I also used black beans instead of chili beans because that's what I had in the pantry. Other than that, I left everything as is and it was incredible. Very easy-to-make, yummy meal. The husband LOVES it. :)

Great recipe, but I did not follow it exactly.  First I didn't cut the tortillas into strips, now I know why it suggests to do so.  The problem I had was cutting through to cut actual pieces.  So next time I will definitely cut up the tortillas.  I also omitted the chili beans because my daughter would not have eaten it.  I also used 1 small can of red enchilada sauce and put half of it in the mixture with the cream of chicken soup, salsa and sour cream.  I did however cut back the sour cream because I used the enchilada sauce.  Then I used the rest of the enchilada sauce on the top with cheese.  It was delicious!  Big hit in my house.  Will make it again!

I didn't have enough salsa so I replaced what I didn't have with enchilada sauce, and I used black beans instead of chili beans (couldn't find them) ....worked very well! Hubby really enjoyed this and took the leftovers to work the next day for lunch!

Excellent base recipe for my group's feed the homeless night, where spicy is the preferred food. Great as is, and accepts many mods. This time, I used chopped boneless chix thighs, and sauted onionss, garlic and green peppers.   Blended cream cheese into the sour cream/soup layer to be sure it was thick enough (throw it in food processor with the sour cream).  Added a layer of canned diced tomatoes and some leftover cooked rice to be sure it was stick-to-your-ribs food.  Stirred some of the shredded cheese into each layer to "bind" it all together (that's my theory and I'm sticking to it!). Due to added bulk, I baked 40 min covered to be sure it was cooked through, and then 10 uncovered to brown the cheese on top.  if you happen to have black olives around, they'd be a nice addition.   I think the tortillas were fine because it was pretty dry.  If wet, they'd probably be soggy, but they're probably not necessary with the rice.

Made this many times. Have finally gotten smart and make double and freeze a casserole to eat later. It took me awhile to find a cream of chicken soup that didnt have artificial flavors or preservatives (for my sensitive kids) but the effort was worth it as this is a favorite recipe around our house.

Per the recommendations of other reviewers, I cooked the chicken in diced tomatoes with green chilies and taco seasoning.  I also used corn tortillas based on some reviews.  I used fat free sour cream and 2% cheese as well.  This was a big hit with adults and kids alike.

This was so yummy and very easy to prepare.  My guests loved it!  I used corn tortilla instead of flour and cut the quantity of cheese and sour cream down.  I also substituted enchilada sauce and tomatoes for the salsa.  The onions were still a little cruchy so I will saute them for a few minutes before adding them next time.  Serve with a dollop of sour cream and a generous spoon-full of enchilada sauce.  Refried beans and rice make this perfect.

Very easy and tasty! I changed the bean mixture and instead of whole chili beans I spread a mixture of diced green chilies and refried beans over the layer of tortillas. I only used 1/2 can of cream of chicken and I used corn tortillas. It was so good! Added some olives as well! Very good and worth making!

I love to make this and freeze half for later for myself or to take to someone. I've used corn tortillas, black beans, added taco seasoning to the chicken when cooking, corn niblets... all the suggested changes/substitutions. You can't go wrong with this one.

This recipe is very good!  My husband doesn't like chili beans, so I omitted them but added a can of chopped green chilies.  We prefer corn tortillas in place of flour ones, it added more flavor!  I make this casserole all of the time!  We love it!

Yum, this was fantastic.  I also used black beans and scaled the recipe down a bit, but it was wonderful.  I did use flour tortillas and they seemed to melt into the mixture.  I may just skip them next time and serve it wrapped in warmed tortillas.

I gave the recipe 4 stars because I agree that the recipe was a little too soupy.  However, the leftovers did stiffen up a bit and stayed that way once re-heated. I also used black beans, and added a can of corn. I like a kick of spice so I added some hot sauce on top of my serving. The flavor was very good, so I will probably make this recipe again and just cut back on the sour cream.

I mix all the ingreients together except for the tortillas and cheese. Then I add half the cheese to the mix. Oh, I then I add fat free refried beans to the mixture too. Then I make 3 layers. tortilla strips, chcken mixture, cheese, tortilla strips, chicken mixture and the rest of the cheese. EXCELLENT. But too sloppy to serve company. That's okay. More for me!

Great recipe. I did use corn tortillas and I used almost double the amount, torn into pieces instead of strips. Also refrigerated salsa vs jarred. When I made my shopping list I wrote down chili beans, and to me chili beans are the ones with chili sauce added, so that's what I got. When putting dish together found my mistake since it states the beans are to be drained. However, I did not drain the suace off. Recipe should specify plain red or kidney beans. I did add some taco seasoning to chicken as previous reviewers noted. It makes a very soft textured casserole, so if a you prefer a bit of a crunch sprinkle the top with crushed tortilla chips before serving.

Tasted sooo good! Followed other suggestions re: 1/2 the sour cream, added black beans instead of kidney beans, added diced tomatoes and chilies, and cooked the chicken in taco seasoning.  Husband thought it was great.  Will make again.

I made this last night, and my husband said it was the best thing he's ever eaten, including food from fancy restaurants. He said he's never been more satisfied with a meal (and he is a picky eater). He told me that if I kept up this quality of cooking he wouldn't have to fire me. XD  I did make some changes, but I am reviewing this recipe because I owe all of the credit to the base recipe: I nixed the sour cream, used black beans instead of chili beans, used white corn chips instead of flour tortillas, and cooked the chicken in a jalapeno taco seasoning. I used a Mexican cheese mix in half the quantity the recipe called for, and I added some fresh spinach in the middle for color. I served it with Goya refried red beans and fresh, homemade lime soda (1 bottle club soda, juice of 1.5 limes, 1/2 cup sugar). 'Twas nommy and healthy, minus the sodium content which was definitely through the roof.   I am heavy-handed and was only able to divide the ingredients into two layers, but it didn't change the taste at all, I'm sure. (=

Good to go recipe..I have made this a few times.  I use the corn tortillas/chips.  Keeps things from getting too soggy.  I also added green chiles to the sour cream mix (cut back a bit on the sour cream) because I love them!  Make sure to spice your chicken with something to your taste. I have used chili power or garlic or taco seasoning.  I topped it with diced tomato & green onion when just before serving.  Very good.

This is so yummy! I made a couple of changes. Roasted a while chicken and shredded it, adding a little sea salt, cumin and garlic powder to the chicken. Changed the sauce - 1 cup sour cream, cream of celery soup, 1 cup salsa, 1 10z can Rotel tomatoes, drained, onion and green chiles (undrained). I agree with another review - this recipe rocks! Thanks for sharing. It will become one of the "stars" of my recipe box.

If I make this I would make the following changes: corn tortillas and NO cream of chicken soup. Or any cream soup for that matter. None of the mexican restaurants I've ever been to used cream soup. Yuck.

My whole family loved it, even the picky 7 year old.  I did omit the beans because I am not a fan of them.  Mine was more casserole then dip, but my husband and daughter did use tortilla chips to eat it.  Next time I will make a smaller pan, for 3 people a 9x13 was too much.

Fantastic.  My husband raved about this, and so did his friends who raided my leftovers!  I used flour tortilla shells, and got great results, no mush.  I did make two small changes, one was using half a block of cream cheese because I needed to use it up (I decreased the amount of sour cream), and I added some jalapenos.  I will make this again for sure!

Made this without any changes and it was a big hit.  One of the best things about this recipe is that you CAN make your own adjustments to taste and it comes out great!  Throw on some shredded lettuce, tomatoes, and onions and you've got even more to enjoy.  Didn't have any problems with the flour tortillas, good meal for your own family or for those times when you bring a meal to a celebration or family in need.  Thanks!

This was pretty good.  I know better but didn't think about it - unless you like crunchy onions - pre cook them because 20 to 30 min. is not enough time to completely soften them up.  Didn't really think this was anything spectacular but was a good meal.  Thanks Anya.

Very easy & tasted great! I followed other reviewers' advice and sub'd cream of celery in place of the cream of chicken. I also halved the sour cream, and cooked my chicken in taco seasoning, later adding in corn & black beans; I think I will nix the corn next time though. This was a delicious & hearty meal that I will definitely make in the future!

This is a super easy yet super delicious recipe. I did make a few changes after reading the reviews. First, I cooked the chicken breasts the day before in the crock pot with chicken stock, water, a package of taco seasoning, garlic powder, and with a few diced chiles in an adobo sauce (I added a bit of the sauce as well). It shredded so easily! Then, I replaced the onion with a can of diced green chiles in the sour cream mix, used corn tortillas, and also added a bit of cream cheese. SO YUMMY!!!!! I served it with salsa, sour cream and sliced avocado on the side.

Great casserole & even better left overs. I reheated & served in a burito.  Next time I am not going to add the tortilla strips in the casserole & serve as a burrito filling Yummy Thanks for the recipe.

Made this twice.  The first time I followed the amounts given in the recipe but added in corn and black beans (instead of chili beans)to the chicken layer.  My hubbie loved it and made me make it for a group dinner.  When I did, I doubled the recipe but increased the chicken to the sour cream/salsa so it was not as soup like (and didn't look as gross when you scooped it out).  I rec. making it that way... but just eyeball everything, don't worry too much about measuring (makes it much easier!).  EVERYONE asked for the recipe... they loved it.

This is very good as is but for one exception. I give this 4 stars because of the tortillas. They have a gross consistency after baking. The casserole would be perfect if you left out the toritillas. I know it is supposed to be a casserole but it would be great to use as a filling to make actual enchiladas.

AWESOME!  I halved the sour cream, used cream of mushroom soup, and fake chicken sauteed with taco seasoning to make it vegetarian.  I also halved the cheese, used black beans instead of chili, and added a can of corn.  Ok, that's a lot of changes, but it was terrific!  *UPDATE* I was out of black beans so I used refried beans and it was pretty good.  I liked the black beans better, but my husband liked the refried beans.

The family loved this very simple dish. Today (4-12-09) was the first day making the dish and it will be made many, many, more times. The only modification that was made was substituting black beans instead of the recipes original chili beans. The next time we may add more cheese. Excellent dish :)

A MUST TRY!  Kids loved it too (w/o beans). Skillet cooked & seasoned chicken breast in little olive oil then shredded it...much more flavorful than boiling...makes it bland. Also, I used 1/2 the soup to keep it from being too runny as suggested in other reviews. Added more cheese on top esp. Recommend more chicken than less.

The color of this was a real turn-off for us. It is pretty bland. It was way too soupy and I even increased the tortillas to 8. I used corn tortillas, and was at least thankful for that. I can't imagine how the texture would be with flour. As per other suggestions, I decreased the sour cream by half and used a mexican cheese blend. We liked Chicken Tortilla Casserole so much better.

I have made this recipe before, following it exactly and it was too moist.  This time, as other cooks did, I adjusted the amounts as follows:  only used 8 oz sour cream, NO salsa, 1/2 c diced onion, used 12 6" CORN tortillas, 5 lg thighs (smothered in chipotle sauce once diced), 3 cups cheddar, and 4oz can diced chilies. Letting it stand is a must.  Rave reviews on this dish!  Thank you.

This is a really good dish. My boyfriend loved it and I took leftovers to work the next day for my staff and we scarfed it down for lunch. Agreably it would make a good dip as it looks great when it comes out of the oven but as soon as I started to dish it out it was pretty sloppy. We didn't really care, it tasted good. However, WHEN I make this again, I will decrease the sour cream and possibly the chicken soup amount to help make it less "soupy" of a mixture. I also used black beans and corn tortillas instead of the recipe directions, and a little corn I had left over in the freezer. I seasoned up the chicken with things I had in my cabinet (chili powder, cumin, emeril's southwest, red pepper, etc) until I had the taste I wanted. I'll defintely make this again...it was easy and tasty!

I'll give this a 4.5 as I think there was a little too much cheddar.  I would use half cheddar, half adifferent cheese next time.  Defintitely decadent!

Very good!!! I used corn tortillas and black beans in place of chili beans and 1/2 can corn. I also used 1 can green chilies and 1 block of softened cream cheese and 8 oz sour cream in the filling and only 2 cups of shredded cheddar/monteray and it was delicious. I'm sure I really upped the fat factor but the taste was well worth it!

Excellent!  Did as others suggested and used corn tortillas and added a packet of taco seasoning.  The left overs were even better.

I love this recipe!  I got mixed reviews from other members of my family, but they were more personal preferences.  My husband wasn't crazy about it as a "casserole" because he didn't care for the tortillas being "soggy" and my daughter isn't crazy about mexican food.  My husband said he loved the filling as a tortilla dip, so there's an idea.  It was especially good on days 2-3.  The next time I make it, it will be for the next day.  I recommend that you purchase extra sour cream and salsa to serve with this one.  You will use all that the recipe calls for in the casserole and it would be awesome topped off with some more.

This was really good!!  I stuck the chicken breasts in the crock pot with 1 cup water and boullion cubes and let cook on high for about 4 hours, then I just shredded the chicken and proceeded with the recipe, my only suggestion would be to watch the size of your chicken breasts I thought 6 were too many and it over powered the dish a bit, however I am sure it depends on size. Great flavor and I will for sure make again many times!!

Wonderful dish! 
I loved that this meal was very filling... and we had left overs. Which is great because my husband eats a lot!!! I ended up using corn tortillas, black beans and corn. It was awesome!

This was good! I subbed a 10 oz can of rotel tomatoes for the salsa and added a 4 oz can of diced chilies to the soup mixture. I also topped the casserole with a can of red enchilada sauce before the last layer of cheese. Served with tortilla chips. It's was great! Thanks!

I thought this was good.  My husband thought it was just okay - but he doesn't like cassarole.  The kids ate it!  I toasted my tortillas to keep them from getting soggy and it helped.  I would have gone with corn, but can't because of allergies.  No other changes - if you like these kinds of cassaroles, you'll love this one!

Made some changes as suggested by other reviewers: corn tortillas, half the sour cream, black beans and served this topped with crumbled tortilla chips.  Oh so yummy.

I found this only ok.  The onions did not cook through so they were crunchy and a bit over-whelming.  If I was to make it again, I would cook the onions with the chicken in order to keep the flavor but change the texture to something everyone in my family will eat.

very good I used crushed tortilla chips instead of the flour tortilla so it was not mushy and the chips soften as it baked so it was just a little crunchy not too much.  I will definitely make it again.

This was great with very few changes. I added some taco seasoning, used 2/3 of the sour cream it called for and added some fresh diced tomatoes and a small can of tomatoe sauce.  I also layered it like a lasagna. My VERY picky children ate it up and asked to have it again.

I thought it was great. I didn't read the reviews before, but still swapped black beans for chili beans (it is what I had on hand). Next time I would definitely cut back on the sour cream because it was a little too creamy for me, but otherwise it was great and the kids (who hardly eat anything) ate it and liked it.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe.  I used this recipe for a Mexican themed Christmas party I had.  This dish was goobled up in no time, and I got many compliments on it.  Only made one change- I used black beans in place of the chili beans.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing.  Pair it with Mexican rice and it is the perfect meal.

This was very tasty, but not at all what I expected. I didn't expect it to be "soupy". I will probably make this again but I'll make a few changes like everyone else has done.

My husband loved this and it was so simple. I added enchilada sauce and green chilies and used rotisserie chicken. I thought it good but needed something else that I just couldn't put my finger on. I will definately make again though, this is a great base recipie worthy of kitchen experimentation!

The look and plating of the casserole is somewhat loose.  But, the taste is great!.  I cooked boneless chicken breasts in 16oz of Pace medium picante for a couple of hours on low heat, then shredded the meat.  As previously mentioned, I only put in 8oz of sour cream.  It didn't need any more than that.  We will be making this on a regular basis.

wonderful taste! My husband doesn't like sour cream so I used cream cheese instead. It turned out great.

I set the serving amount to 4 and used a 9" square pan.  I followed the recipe except for the following changes:  I used the whole can of chili beans and cream of chicken soup. I used 6 corn tortillas instead of flour. I added taco seasoning to the sour cream mix. I also used canned chicken.  Very delicious!

Per previous posts suggestions: 
USED: 8 OZ SOUR CREAM, creamm of celery sp, cooked chicken with taco seasing, used much less cheese and topped with jalepenos.

We LOVED this and will definately make again.  It was very easy and fast to make.  Hubby was super impressed with it as well.

Yuck. Ranks right up there with a certain brand of canned noodles in tomato sauce, with added crumbled ritz crackers. Tasted as bad as it looked. My husband and kids refused to eat it once tasted.

Everyone liked this tatsy casserole. Mine came out almost dip-like like another reviewer mentioned. I would add a little more chicken and beans and/or leave out 1/4 salsa, sour cream and cream of chicken soup next time. Will make again - a good crowd pleaser.

Took it to my office yesterday and it was devoured.  Everyone loved it.  I did what others suggested and cooked the chicken in taco seasoning on top of the salsa in my slow-cooker.  Also used lite sour cream (1 cup) and cream of celery soup.  Many requests for the recipe.

Great tasting recipe. Family doesn't care for beans too much so left them out, but didn't miss them.  Very tasty.  The 7 year old up to the 16 yr old child liked it so a keeper in my box!  Thanks!

This was really yummy!  The only thing I changed was I bought a rotisserie chicken to shred to save time.  This was super easy; made lots; and was so good!  Next time I might leave out the chopped onion as I'm not a big fan of onion and the casserole had plenty of flavor.  Thanks!

This is an awesome recipe.  Instead of chicken, I substituted ground beef cooked with taco seasoning.  My family truly enjoyed it and I took the left overs to work and the girls couldn't believe how good it was.

I must have done something wrong!! Mine was very dry!! I followed the recipe exactly. It never got "bubbly". Was it supposed to be in the oven COVERED?? Some of the other reviews said theirs was soggy, but mine was on the other end of the spectrum!  Help. . .

Loved this recipe - the flour tortillas don't get so mushy if you roll the mixture inside the tortillas and then top with cheese to bake.

This recipe was wonderful.  I added guacomole to the sauce and it made it real creamy and delicious.  I also used homemade salsa that my husband and I made with fresh vegetables from our garden.  This was a real treat for my whole family.

This was just delicious. My entire family loved this. It was so creamy and the flavor was fantastic but not over-bearing. Even my picky eater--who always has something to say about everything I cook--absolutely loved this. Will definitely make this again!

This is the second time I've made this.  It was better this time around because I GRILLED the chicken, used SCALLIONS insted of regular onions, and used KIDNEY beans instead of chile beans.  Scrumptious!

We modified this quite a bit - the beans were voted out - majority rules - but it turned out nice and was yummy. Second day didn't hold up quite as well for us - but we liked it enough on day one to make it again.

This needs more seasonings, used cream of celery soup and added green chili peppers.  Will try again with additional adjustments to suit our taste better.

I used mango salsa and cream of tomato soup because that's what I had around. I also used black beans and corn, with only half the cheese like some other people had suggested. I also liked it better the second day. I think next time I'll use 3 cups of cheese.

I have made this recipe several times with no deviations (okay, maybe I use a little more than 4 cups of cheese).  It is always a univeral hit!  The only bad part is that there are never any left-overs.  A can't miss hit for any potluck.

I love this recipe. I've made it several times and everyone always gobbles it up. It makes such a huge amount, so sometimes I cut the recipie in half. I also always take a few slices of the flour tortillas and make a design on top and sprinkle a little paprika on top of them. It makes it look so much nicer when baked.

I thought this was tasty.  I used black beans as suggested by others and liked that addition.  Mine wasn't too runny, probably because I scaled the ingredients to my desired consistency.  I also added hot sauce to make it spicy.  It is definitely a flexible recipe.  Try it- it's fast and tasty.

Overall this recipe was OK. I think that it lacked a little flavor. It was very rich considering all of the sour cream and salsa. I did use left over turkey from Thanksgiving. I just don't think this recipe was all that great. Required a lot of ingredients. I cut the cheese down to 2 cups instead of 4.

My family gave it a 7.9 on a scale of 1-10. Anything over a 7 I am allowed to cook again! :-)

Delicious! This was a great recipe! I added canned diced tomatoes with green chilies and I used cheese with peppers! Very tasty! Will probably make on a weekly basis! Thanks!

I made this with beef once, and with chicken once.  Both were good, but seemed more like a dip.  Next time, it will be a dip with chips - omitting the tortilla strips.

We love Mexican food and this was much easier than the traditional way I make enchilades. And it's very tasty too. I used a larger size can of beans (couldn't find just 8 oz.) and only 2 cups of chhese and it came out perfect!

This was wonderful!!!  It was a little time consuming.  But I cooked and shredded the chicken the night before.  I also mixed the sour cream, chili beans, salsa, soup and onions together the night before.  It made for quick assembly.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was such a simple, yet great recipe.  For greatest ease, I boiled the chicken.  Basically the meat will fall off of the bone and is quite easy to shred.  The chicken broth makes a great soup too.

I thought is recipe was way too runny even after reducing some liquid.  I also didn't like the texture of the tortillas after they baked.  The Velveeta was really overpowering.  My husband really liked it though-so maybe it's just my tastebuds thazt are off!

I think that this recipe would be great as a dip, but as a casserole it just did not have enough flavor. I might try it again, but cut way back on the sour cream and add enchilada mix and corn tortillas instead of the flour.

My husband & I loved this dish!  The kids, however, didn't want to try it.  It does come out a strange pinkish color, but it is really very good.  I will definitely make this dish again, soon!

This is GREAT! I substituted pinto beans for the chili beans.  My husband loves it and prefers it leftover.  Says the flavor melds together better. This is now a favorite in my house.

This was AMAZINGLY delicious.  I think if i were to do any critiquing, it would be more specific about how long to boil the chicken breasts and what to put on the top layer, i.e. cheese, sauce, tortillas.  Kudos to the author, this one gets passed down to ALL members of my family and friends.

I used black beans because that is a personal favorite. I also added a small can of white corn. It was so good. I also added taco seasoning to the chicken for the extra boost of flavor. Great recipe. We both went back for seconds..I would definitely make it again

I did make some changes to this recipe. I used Pinto Beans instead of Chili beans. I also doubled the recipe, because I wanted lots of leftovers to freeze. I used Enchilada sauce over the top and then topped it with cheese. I also lightly seasoned my chicken with Taco seasoning, garlic, and onion powder and cooked it in the slow cooker, which made it  very tender and easier to shred. Once I shredded the chicken, I put it back in the juice in the slow cooker to make it  juicy and give it more flavor. It was delicious!

Like most people on here I made some changes and it came out delicious! No salsa or chili beans. I added diced avocado, sweet corn, and black beans. I also boiled, then shredded, and then cooked the chicken in 1c water, taco seasoning, and diced onions. I wrapped my mixture into actual enchiladas, but they came out soft and creamy, like a casserole! I also put taco sauce over the top and then cheese for a spicier taste. Thank you for the base recipe!

Delicious!  This made a ton of food.  I kind of wish I used another can of beans.  It took longer than 30 minutes in the oven.

I followed the suggestions of another user so that it would not be dip like. I boiled the chicken breasts then finished it on the stove with taco seasoning. I added about 1.5 C of corn and 1 C of drained & rinsed black beans to the cooked chicken. I used corn tortillas instead of flour. I layered in the baking pan, I did not cut them into strips. I only used !8oz of sour cream. 6 chicken breasts was way to much for this recipe (maybe the ones I used were too big). Just eyeball the amount of chicken it would take to nicely layer a 9x13 pan 3 times, maybe 4. I only layered my baking pan twice since I was eyeballing 1/3 of the ingredients It would have been too much so I stopped at the 2nd layer. Even If I layered again I would have a lot of chicken left over. Its ok, I'll use it for taco salad. It was good, I would make it again, but the chicken definitely needs to be seasoned before layering.

Good recipe.  Gave it 4 stars as it was a little soupier than we prefer. However the flavors are terrific.  Mine was more of the "kitchen sink" variety - leftover chicken, left over Italian and venison sausage, black beans instead of chili beans.  I did not have sour cream so used plain yogurt instead.  It got good reviews from the family. Will definitely make it again

I think the onions need to be sauteed before going into the wet mix and the casserole needs to bake longer. I baked the casserole a second time on a lower temperature and then it tasted fantastic.

I hesitate to criticize a recipe because I a always (nearly) change things, sometimes due to not having an ingredient and sometimes cause I think I am smart. And I changed this one slightly. I used tomato sauce instead of salsa and added onion and pepper.  Because of this, perhaps, it was very "watery". The family didn't like it at all. I thought it was ok.

I made a few changes to the recipe as my wife and I both love spicy food and we wanted this to be more of a lasagna than a dip.

Here is what I did differently:
Used Corn Tortillas, 2 layers at a time
Used 8oz sour cream
Added-1 medium poblano pepper
Used-Chunky habanero salsa
Used 3/4 can of cream of chicken
Used 3/4 can of medium chili beans drained 
Cooked chicken with taco seasoning, no water, and in diced green chiles
Added 1 can of enchilada sauce to the top layer under the cheese.

This was delicious and the recipe is a great recipe to build off of. I will have to say that there was enough for 8 full grown adults who like to eat. 

Follow the rest of the directions but simply add and adjust the quantity based upon the above. 


Added 1 small can of enchilada sauce on the top

I made this, but substituted a few things. Mainly, because I didn't have some of the ingredients and didn't want to make a store run. First, I didn't use any tortillas. Second, I shredded the chicken and added taco seasoning. Third, I didn't add the cream of chicken. I just used sour cream and salsa, then added green chilis and black beans. Layered all that stuff, and bam! Delicious meal. I think not adding the cream or chicken helped not make it so runny, like a lot of other people were experiencing. Also, it wasn't soggy because no tortillas were added. I'll make it this way from now on. So good!!!

Pros:  Easy instructions.   Quick assembly.  Makes several servings.  

Cons:  Bland taste.  4 cups of  cheese, 16 ounces of sour cream, and 1 can of cream of chicken soup made this a fat calorie dense casserole.  My kids (ages 11 & 13)  didn't care for this casserole and are normally very open to newer recipes.  They love Mexican food.    Expensive recipe unless everything is on sale.

Other thoughts:  Reduce fat and calories by using  lite or fat free ingredients.

Kids ate the rice and salad but now we are going to Dairy Queen as a surprise!!

It turned out okay , but that was way too much sour cream, I think a half portion or even omitted from the recipe would have been better, especially since there's enough creaminess in the cream of chicken soup. I would've preferred a different recipe which used actual enchilada sauce instead of so much sour cream and cream of chicken soup.

Very good! The ENTIRE family enjoyed it and the kids requested it in their lunches the next day! Changes: i used ground beef simply bc I didn't have chicken. I used cream of onion soup, again, bc I didn't have cream of chicken. The only change I would make for next time is to cut the tortillas into 1-2 inch squares and not strips.. the cooked strips made it hard to cut and slice pretty on a plate. YUMMY

My mom made a recipe very similar to this (she called it Mexican casserole) and we always looked forward to it when we went to visit. Sadly, I never got her recipe, but this is very close. I cut the recipe in half cause I was only feeding 4 people, and  used only about 4-5  oz. sour cream-what was left in the container. Topped with sliced ripe olives, cause mom did. :) Served with Mexican rice, and simple salad. I'm keeping the recipe, and will make it again.

I just made this and loved it!  I used whole flour tortillas and didn't have any issues with them getting pastey.  I did however use Fat Free cream cheese instead of sour cream and used half the amount of cheese.  Also added a can of corn and black beans, it was delicious and very filling!

This was excellent. A bit of background: I make my own chicken broth, using 4-5 lbs. of gizzards per batch. I HATE throwing them out when done but have you ever tried eating that many gizzards? It gets real old, real fast. 

So I purchased a meat grinder, put them through and then used about a pound in this recipe. Everybody LOVED the result, even my three children aged 5, 7 & 8. Definetly a keeper!

Pretty good. If you like spicier you'll need to add some green chiles or taco seasoning etc.

I used corn tortilla. It was so good. Too much onion, the salsa I had chose had onion in it as well. Also it was still kinda of soggy so Instead of sliced tortilla I think I will use the whole tortilla to layer, I could barley taste them. Still delicious. Added mozella cheese to the topping with the chedder. yum yum

Easy five star rating! I had made similar versions of this recipe, found this one a keeper. I did use the ingredients in the recipe, except the sour cream. I added Philadelphia Cooking Creme Santa Fe Blend and 3/4 container of (16 oz size) sour cream, instead of the all (16 oz) container of sour cream. Good choice my family loved the new version. Yummmm!

My family didn't like this at all. I added taco seasoning as others suggested and still found it very bland. Substituted black beans for the chili beans. Will NOT be making again.

Made this casserole just like the recipe with the exception of the beans.  I substituted the chili beans with black beans and I used corn tortillas instead of flour ones - like other reviewers suggested.  We dished it out onto tortilla chips and added more sour cream and salsa to the top.   It was delicious!  Everyone loved it and I will definetly make this again.

This is one messy dish but after tasting it- you won't mind a bit! I added some enchilada sauce to the layers, sure added a nice little flavor.  I was able to find thicker flour tortillas and they never got soggy, even when reheated. Very-very yummy!!

Good basic easy casserole. Noone in the family diliked it. It was a little on the bland side.  But a good starting point.  I used low fat soup, cheese, and sour cream.

This was spectacular! And I agree, even tastier the next day. I also cut the sour cream in half. I used flour tortillas and thought they were fine, although they were a bit pasty the next day. I'm not complaining, though- still freaking fantastic. Also, I used Newman's Own tequila lime salsa, which added a great, subtle lime flavor. I'm definitely going to make this again soon!

After reading the comments, I made the mixture (minus half the sour cream) and wrapped it in the tortilla like typical enchiladas.  I used half of the cheese and sprinkled it on top.  I baked it for almost an hour.  It wasn't runny!  Great flavor!

Great Recipe....my mistake I added super hot salsa which kinda made my family's tummy upset...next time I will be sure to add a mild salsa. Everyone loved it. Super easy to make. Did use corn tortillas instead.

This was excellent but I did lighten it up a bit.  I used 1/2 the sour cream and a light version, as well as a light version of soup and cheese.  I added chopped green pepper and yellow pepper and used 2 lbs of ground turkey with taco seasoning.  We loved it and are keeping it in our rotation!

This recipe was sooo delicious!! I'll admit, I was a little leery at first when mixing the salsa, sour cream, soup and beans together...it was an unappetizing pink color, but once out of the oven, it was totally fine and smelled heavenly! I used cream of celery soup and black beans on the advice of other reviews. I also nixed the chopped onion because I was too lazy to cut it up. My husband loved this dish, and so do I! We will be making this often! Thanks! :)

Great recipe!  And a good addition to throw into the rotation. Made it just as written and it was very tasty.  Think it would be 5-star worthy with just a few changes as mentioned in previous reviews, but I'm not reviewing reviews here.  Loved it!  Will spice up the chicken next time with some cumin, garlic powder and s&p, use a little less sour cream, definitely black beans and maybe some more tortillas to give a little more balance to the heavy load of chicken and cheese.

I submitted some ingredients that I had on hand and this recipe came up.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it and I didn't change anything except for the number of servings.  I will definitely be making this again and next time I think I'll add a small can of green chilies.  Yum!!

Easy and simple.  Very good.  I pretty much followed the recipe except for the corn tortillas I used instead of the flour ones.  The recipe says it serves 12(?) but my family of 4 adults and 2 kids nearly finished it off!

Very tasty!  I added a layer of rice mixed with some taco seasoning but it probably would have been better without it...also cut my 10" tortillas in half and made sure each layer had tortillas covering the entire pan, so it was more like a mexi lasagna.  We all enjoyed this.

I doubled this recipe and cooked it for 24 highschoolers - It was gone! Very easy, and very quick. I'll probably make it again for myself!

This recipe makes ALOT of sauce.  I cut it in half and it was still alot for me.  Next time I would probably cut the sauce part of even further.  The sauce was  good but it does taste like there's alot of sour cream.  I love sour cream so I didn't mind it but my bf wasn't a fan.  Also, the onions definitely don't cook in 30 mins.  I like raw onions anyways so I didn't mind but other people might not want onion breath after eating this!  I followed the recipe but used corn tortillas. instead after reading all the reviews.  I should have served with rice and maybe some jalepenos!

A family hit!  Make sure the onions are diced very small so they are not raw when it's done.  I used corn tortillas and like it even better, and I use black beans instead.  You really can't go wrong!

I thought this recipe was very good.  The only changes I made was adding refried beans and only making half the recipe.  Like some other reviewers, I think next time I will cut the sour cream, but otherwise I really liked the taste and it's very filling.  Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked the chicken in the slow cooker with taco seasoning and some salsa...and started the layers with a bit of sauce at the bottom of the pan.  Turned out great, we ate it with tortilla chips...kinda like a dip.  Will try it next time with corn tortillas.  Thank you for the recipe.

Our family of 6 loved this recipe.  I used lite sour cream and low-fat cream of chicken soup.  It worked wonderfully.  I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and some of my homemade taco seasoning while they were cooking.  Loved it!

This meal has become a weekly staple in my home. I used this recipe a couple months ago, and have made a couple slight changes from other reviewers advice. I do cook the chicken in taco seasoning, after boiling and shredding it. It adds a great punch of flavor. I also use black beans instead of chili beans, and I have used both cream of mushroom or chicken. Both are fine. I actually prefer cream of mushroom soup in the recipe. All in all, this is a fantastic quick dinner, and one we can enjoy over and over. Tex-Mex at it's finest!

Very good casserole recipe. I followed a couple of other reviewers suggestions and cooked the chicken with taco seasoning, used black beans and added jalepenos to the top, which really added some good flavor. My boyfriend and his roomate loved it! I have to agree that it was a little soupy. I will definitely make this recipe again, but may follow suggestions to play around a little with the amount of sour cream/cream of chicken soup.

I followed advise and used corn tortillas, rotel tomatoes and black beans, and cooked the chicken in southwest seasoning, this was Awesome!  Giving 5 stars to EKERR19 for the improvements, and 4 to the original submitter.  Definately in the dinner rotation for Mexican night!

I love this recipe!! It's definitely something that I will make for years to come. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used corn tortillas, instead of flour ones. I also use a can of rotel in addittion to the salsa. I only use a 8 oz. container of sour cream, but I stick with the chilli beans because I like the spicy flavor they add. Made this way, it's spicy but not hot. Also, I made it with cream of chicken the first time, but I didn't have any today so I used cream of celery. In about 15 minutes, I'll know if it makes a difference which one you use! And I agree with another revewier who said that this is soooo much better the next day!!

I would definitely make this again! I used canned chicken instead of chicken breasts and black beans instead of chili beans and the results were wonderful. The bottom layer of tortillas was a little gummy, but all together fine. I used multi-grain tortillas.

Super easy to make, taste pretty good actually, but low points on presentation. It just doesn't look too appetizing. I just don't like the idea of mixing all the canned food together to come up a dish, not healthy at all. Flour tortilla works fine for me, there is no need to substitute corn tortilla. I might make it again for a large crowd.

Great recipes, family LOVES this!!!
However a few changes were made based on experience and other reviews.

with the cooked chicken I add:
CORN TORTILLA (not flour!)
1 can of corn
1 can of diced flavored tomoatoes
1 can of chili beans
Sour cream
Salsa

After heating all of the above in a skillet, I layer the torilla's, chicken mix, cheese.  3-4 layers, bake 10-15 minutes is all it takes in the oven.

Won't be making this again.  Turned out extremely soggy and gloppy! I even baked it two more times to try to make the leftovers more appealing, to no avail.  Good in theory.

Pretty good.  I prepared this for a carry-in luncheon and I think people enjoyed it, but it did not taste as good once it got cold.  I will make this again in the future, but not for a potluck.

I had some leftover chicken from a rotisserie chicken we'd bought at the grocery store and believe it or not we had made cornish game hens that had some leftover meat as well so I was looking for a recipe that I could use that up in.  This worked out great and even better was that I had all the other ingredients on hand!  Only thing I didn't have was the chili beans..so used about 1/2 cup drained canned pinto beans. Just wonderful. Really recommend using crushed tortilla chips on top, we all the loved the crunch (left out two of the tortillas)! This was easy, quick, filling and tasty too!

This recipe was good! I used a whole can of beans, but other than that I followed the recipe. Nothing exciting, and I might decrease the amount of the sour cream next time, add olives, and follow others suggestions to cook the chicken in taco seasoning to give it some spice. Yummy!

good,  but to much sour cream. I used 3 cups of cheese and i also added taco  seasoning to the sour cream. I also fry my tortillas first in a little olive oil. I fried some onions and garlic and added as well.

This is good, I have made it twice now, but both times I didn't have enough left over chicken for the whole thing so used beef on one half and chicken on the other.  I prefer the beef.  It is quite mushy, but my kids like that.  It definately needs something with a little texture on the side.  I will keep this recipe around for a quick meal that uses up left over taco meat or chicken.

I used this recipe as a basic and just did my own thing with it. I mixed taco seasoning and taco sauce in with the shredded chicken. I also rolled the meat filling and a little cheese up in a tortilla. As for the sauce I mixed sour cream, salsa, cream of chicken soup. I also drained a can of Rotel and added to the sauce.  As for the beans I put a can of refried beans on the bottom of the casserole dish then put my filled tortillas on top and  poured the sauce on top. I cooked for 20 minutes then added the cheese and cooked til melted. It was really good and my family loved it. There was leftovers and I loved that. Gives me tomorrow night off.

This is good. There are hundreds of recipes similar to this one and I like them all!  It makes for a quick and easy dinner with little prep work. I did leave out the onions for personal preference. I do think you could cut down on the sour cream or if you use all the sour cream, leave out the soup.

This was a pleasant surprise. My husband is extremely picky about casserole-type dishes because of their tendency towards "mushiness", and he even made a negative comment when he saw what I had made, but he ended up loving it. I used both flour and corn tortillas, putting mainly corn on the bottom and the middle, and flour on the top, and it was a perfect texture. The top was especially delicious. Thanks for a great, easy recipe that my husband likes!

I made this for the first time last night. I took the advice of others and used one can of rotel type tomatoes and added about 1/4 cup of salsa to that.  I did not use full can of soup (cream of celery) and I used about 3/4 cup of sour cream. Everything turned out well except it seemed a little dry - I think due to cutting back on the soup and sour cream. I also substituted corn for the beans as we do not like beans. It was good but next time I will add the full amount of soup and sour cream and perhaps a little more salsa. It was good though and the tortilla strips did not turn to goo as some reported.

Not really a fan of this. It was really runny after cooking. Maybe if more tortillas were added? Or maybe I didn't add enough chicken? Not sure but it just didn't move right if you know what I mean.

Quick easy and tasty. This is one that I have committed to memory. You can vary the level of spice by the type of salsa used and by how much of the sauce from the kidney beans you use. A winner everytime. Thanks for a great dish!

Loved this dish.  I used less chicken and used fat free cheddar cheese (only 2 cups instead of 4) and fat free sour cream.  This dish was great - even my husband thought so!

Good quick casserole, lots of good flavor. I did revise it a little, though. Instead of the salsa I used a can of Rotel Tomatoes and Green Chilis, I used corn tortillas and added chopped cilantro, garlic and chili powder to the shredded chicken for an extra kick. Tastes great!

This recipe was excellent!  My husband has about eaten the entire pan in 2 days!!  And it's a FULL pan!!  Mine was a little runny and next time will use Thick and Chunky Salsa, more onion, and add some peppers to spice it up.  Wish I had some tortilla chips to go w/ it b/c it would be an excellent dip.  Thanks!

Flavor excellent.  Served it to people who had never eaten anything like it, and they loved it.  My reservation is about the soupy, goopy sour cream portion.  There's just too much.  Can't figure out how to reserve the taste and still reduce the excess creaminess.

I think the base of this recipe is ok but I need to make some changes next time. I didn't like the creaminess of it. I think next time I will reduce the soup and sour cream, increase the chicken and put tomatoes in it.

Pretty easy and pretty good! I agree with fellow posters who said the tortillas can get a little soggy. I, instead of cutting them, left them whole. This also cut down on the feeling of 'dip' versus main meal.

This is a delicious recipe.  I personally make it without the chili beans.  I dont feel like it's lacking anything because of it.  Good dish for the whole family.  It is very easily modified to everyone taste.

This was a good easy dish.  I used grilled chicken fajita meat for the chicken.  I did use salsa but next time I think I will try using Rotel instead.

Amazing! I used corn tortillas as suggested (and less chicken + more black beans) and it was superb. I will most definitely make this again. Yum!

I really like this!  I'm not a good cook but was proud when my hubby told me he really liked it (tough critic). I did add quite a bit of hot sauce which gave it the perfect kick.  I liked it better the next day; although I did nuke it in the microwave.  Yum!

This is a great and easy recipe.  Our only complaint is that we did not like the texture of the tortillas after being baked.  They were gooey and reminded us of wet bread.  We made it a second time for a potluck and left out the tortillas.  Instead we used small tortillas (5 inch rounds) and let everyone fill their own with the casserole and also provided toppings such as diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce.

I guess I need to stop going by the star rating....  
my kids liked(not loved) it, husband (who isn't usually picky) said it was 'OK'....and it looked so gross I didn't want to eat it.

My family and I liked this recipe quite a bit -- I'd give it 4 and a half stars if I could have.  It was exceptionally easy to prepare -- the most time consuming part was cutting up the tortillas.  I also boiled and shredded my chicken, since I love the texture and flavor of it that way.  I substituted Pace's enchilada sauce for half of the salsa called for.  The only reason I didn't give this five stars is that while it was very good, it just wasn't exceptional.  I do think I'll make it again, but probably not more than once a month or so.  The exceptional recipes make it into the rotation twice a month.

I loved this dish and so did my husband!  I think next time I may use hotter salsa or jalapenos(I used medium salsa this time) to give it more of a spicy kick.

This was great!  My 2 yr old, 8 yr old, and 9 yr old gobbled it up.  Tastes just like the real thing.  I like mine a little saucy, so just used 4 chicken breasts and it was wonderful.  It does make a BUNCH, so expect leftovers or feed a crowd.  Great for potlucks.

Realized after I started making this, that I have been making proper enchiladas for years with almost the same ingredients. This was much easier!! Liked it, my only issue was the black beans... think I'll leave them out next time. But other that that Great!!

I thought it was pretty good, I would make it next though with 1/2 sour creme and also make it more enchilada style rather than as written.

The night I tried this recipe out we had an unexpected guest, and it was a good thing this turned out!  I'm not that great of a cook and I made this without a problem.  I just cooked the chicken breasts in the microwave with a little salsa for like 15 minutes and then shredded it, and they turned out fine.  Will make again, easy and tasty!!!

This recipe is very good. I used less sour cream and omitted the chicken all together the second time I made it. You do need to let it sit before serving so it can be cut. Also, it is very good the next day even when eaten cold.

Excellent recipe. I added cayenne pepper to the salsa, bean, sour cream mixture and used fat free sour cream to give it an extra kick the second time I made it. Adding taco seasoning to the chicken adds delicious flavor. Absolutely delicious recipe!

This recipe is always a huge hit at my dinner parties! People love it! And it's also great the next day. I highly recommend that you let it sit for 30 minutes after you take it out of the oven. It makes a huge difference in the taste and texture.

First, this dish looks unappetizing, but I can usually get past that as long as the flavor is good.  But, I didn't think that it even tasted very good.  I ended up throwing the leftovers away.

Very creamy and delicious.  I topped the cheese with green chiles, omitted the onions and salsa and used green enchilada sauce instead. I also chose to use fat free refried beans instead of chili beans. This is a keeper!

Great tasting recipe. I only used 8 oz. of sour cream instead of 16 oz. as some suggested and I used a 15 oz. can of beans. I baked it for 35 minutes and the beans were not very warm, so the next time I make it I will bake longer. Otherwise a keeper.

Absolutely delicious. Will make again and use for upcoming potluck. Used hot chili beans and cilantro salsa which gave it a little more kick.

This wasn't bad it just seemed to be missing something. It needed an extra kick. If I make it again I'll definitely add something to make it spicier.

Try adding diced jalepenos for a great extra kick.  I also add chopped red and green peppers & use a Mexican blend of shredded cheese instead of cheddar.  This recipe is alwasys a HUGE hit and is gone way faster than such a large dish should be! You'll find the appetites around you suddenly growing when this dish is in the fridge!

This lasted me almost 3 dinners!  Next time I'll substitute with fresh medium temp salsa and less sour cream.  Otherwise, this was a great entree that I'll fix again!

I had a lunch meeting at my house with all my coworkers and this was a huge hit. I had to email the recipe as soon as I got back to work. It's so simple and quick that you can't go wrong. One addition...try smoking the chicken in a smoker to add that extra great flavor.

I loved this recipe!  It was so easy to make and my family loved it.  I did use light sour cream and reduced fat cheese instead of regular.  The only other thing I would different next time is use less cheese maybe 2 cups in place of 4.

Good taste, but if you eat with chips I do not see the need in the flour tortillas when you can eat it as a dip without these.  However as a casserole to eat alone it needs more flavor.  Easy to prepare.

I'm all for simple, quick meals.  If I had kids, this might be a staple.  But to be honest, I thought that the flavor and texture of this dish left a lot to be desired.  I felt like all I was eating was "gloop."  For me, this dish was a disappointment.
