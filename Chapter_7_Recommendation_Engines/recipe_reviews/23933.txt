I really enjoyed this recipe. I just noticed now that you are supposed to put the cocktail sauce on top of the spread. Well, I mixed it right in with everything else and it turned out great. I suggest mixing all the ingredients except the crab (which I fold in at the end) with an electric hand mixer, it gives a nice whipped texture.

Since I love crab meat, I doubled the amount of meat and skipped the cocktail sauce.  I would recommend using lump crab meat or the fake crab meat.  I mixed everything in the food processor, and it was too creamy.  It was still good, but it needed some texture.

    *  2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
    * 1 tablespoon lemon juice
    * 1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
    * 2 green onions, finely chopped
    * 1 (6 ounce) can crabmeat, drained and flaked
    * 1 (8 ounce) jar cocktail sauce

I served this at a family gathering and everyone loved it. Even my "tell me what's in it first" husband loved it and is eating the few bites left over today. I added extra lemon juice, and next time I'll add more hot sauce. I used Rachel's Wasabi Cocktail Sauce, from this website. I think this would be equally good with shrimp.

I halved the recipe and used a little less lemon juice.  I thought it was very good and we used it with crackers and sourdough bread.  I thought it needed just a little something extra so next time I'll experiment with either some garlic salt or a hotter hot sauce.

Oh my Gawd!  This is absolutely wonderful.  I'll admit I was skeptic with the hot sauce but it's wonderful.  You just want to keep eating it.  Great aftertaste.  I would advise you not to make this too far in advance of it's serving because you'll eat it!

Not exactly what I was looking for. I added some shredded cheddar to increase the cheese flavor, but it just didn't do it for me. Not a big hit at the party I took it to, though some people did like it.

Great combination - I did plus up the tabasco sauce though to 1 Tablespoon and used the green tabasco sauce instead.

Way too much cocktail sause, it completely over powers the flavor of anything else. Not enough crab. Will not make again.

Well, I admit that I messed up and just put some of the cocktail sauce IN the recipe - but overall it's a good, easy, basic crab dip. :)

This is one of our family's favorite hors d'oerves for gatherings. Then they stand around an skarf the stuff on to crackers or celery, making pigs of themselves. I used to make this in layers, but mixing the cream cheese with the lemon and onions, then adding in the drained and rinsed crab (doesn't have to be the best lump crab, but real crab is important) makes the best combo. I finely chop a little sweet vidalia onion and/or chives as it really needs that little something.  I put it in a midsize souffle dish and mound it in a half ball and pour just enough cocktail sauce to cover, but not drown it, not quite a small bottle. Add a little parsley or chives on top or around it and you have a Christmas Dip! You will never have leftovers.
