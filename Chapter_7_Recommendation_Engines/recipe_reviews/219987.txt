These are really good. I was lazy and didn't put the strawberries on top and instead sprinkled them with red and white sugar crystal sprinkles. Everyone was surprised at how good strawberries taste in a muffin.

These were very good. I gave it a lower score, only because of the changes I made to the recipe. Nice flavour and moist! I changed a few things because of what I had on hand. I used 2 cups of pureed strawberries (which I had had frozen since last summer) instead of the 1.5 cups of chopped. Also, I used 1/2 whole wheat flour. I didn't have lemon extract so I used pulp form fresh lemons (just a little less). Instead of chocolate chips, I used 1 cup fine unsweetened coconut. Finally I added a spoonful of coconut merengie to the top (2 egg whites, 1/2 cup icing sugar, and 3/4 cup coconut). It added a nice variety of texture to the top.

I made these for the family for Valentine's Day. I followed the recipe exactly, including the chocolate chips. I thought they were ok. They were a bit bland- the sugar flavor predominates, not the strawberry or even lemon flavor, and the texture was a little weird (almost rubbery?). My kids were not big fans, which surprised me because I thought they would like them best of all. I know that strawberries are difficult to bake with, so maybe that was part of it. Anyway, it is clear that other people liked this recipe very much so perhaps it is just that my preference is different, but I will look elsewhere next time. Thanks anyway!

These looked and smelled delightful, alas I cannot partake - due to celiacs, but everyone else just loves them!

I cut this recipe in half for 12 muffins. I followed the recipe closely, only increasing both the baking powder and baking soda. I did not sprinkle the additional sugar over each muffin. Baked at 350*, my muffins were done at 22 minutes. Very "wet" muffin--like overly moist. Even after they were done, the edges stuck to the pan terribly(even when I sprayed the pan well with non-stick spray) and after they sat, they sank. I'm sure more flour would help but as is, these didn't work out for us.

These turned out great! I left out the chocolate chips and they were still really yummy. I used a silicone heart-shaped muffin pan that I had and they came out with a cute heart-shape. I'll definitely make this recipe again.

I cut the recipe in half and made 24 mini muffins. I used raspberries instead of strawberries in the batter and cut strawberry halves into heart shapes to put on top. I used lemon juice in place of extract and had no zest. I replaced a third of the white sugar with brown sugar. Oh, and no chocolate chips. Tasty.

Second batch: Made the same way but will all strawberries, and I was out of milk so I subbed a 1:1 cream:water mix. They came out mushy and falling apart, I think because I used the full amount of strawberries and didn't cut them very small. But this is a good recipe for using up strawberries that will otherwise go bad in the fridge or that are too ripe for my sensitive stomach.

Wow, these are delicious!  Just the right amount of sweet and sour, the lemon offsets the strawberries very very well!  Usually I'm worried that the sugar is too much but I didn't change a thing (well, I used brown sugar) and it worked perfectly.  I made regular and mini muffins and as I used a convection oven baked them at 165C (20 minutes for the mini muffins).  These are so moist and tangy and sweet, just so good!
