This was really different! Definitely for those who are fans of horseradish. I love the stuff so I thought I'd try this for breakfast. Very good with a side of whole grain toast.

Never in a million years would I have thought of putting horseradish in an omelet. If you love horseradish like I do, give this one a try. YUM and thanks!

I loved this savory dish.  It has complex flavors but is still people-friendly.  I will definetly make this again.  THe Irish Cheese was hard to find but worth the search.

I honestly would have never thought to put horseradish in an omelette--what have I been missing? Boy, was it good. I made the omelette a little fuller by adding onion, chopped fresh mushrooms, spinach and a little fresh minced garlic. Very good breakfast.

I really enjoyed this omelet!! I didn't read the directions and mixed the horsey sauce and seasonings in with the eggs. So I just topped the omelet with the cheeses and some chopped green onion. Very good!!

I would never have thought of adding horseradish sauce to eggs! This was really good. I made one omelet with Italian seasoning and one without. I much preferred the one without (just s&p). This would be good with some bacon. Thanks, Jamie!

The horseradish gave a surprising lift to the omelet.  You have to exercise good judgement in deciding how much to add, depending on how much you like horseradish and how strong your horseradish is.  I used a slightly different blend of herbs, but I think there's plenty of room to be creative with it.  It was a nice change, and we had them for dinner with pita crisps.

I was craving horseradish and searched for recipes with eggs for breakfast. This one sounded fast and flavorful. It was disappointing. The horseradish didn't really enhance the eggs, and the recipe calls for way too much cheese for my taste. The herb seasoning added flavor, but it made the cooked eggs look gray and unappetizing.

I liked this, but I think I would have liked it better with more cheddar. I would leave out the parmesan next time. I added extra horseradish! Thanks for an interesting new omelet.

I'm a huge horseradish fan and I loved this! Used green onions because that is what I had on hand.

i wanted something simple for tonight so i decided to try this recipe.. i love horseradish sauce and love cheese.. but i halved the cheeses and still found it to be a bit much.. used Mrs. Dash for the seasoning blend and used Heinz Horseradish Sauce for the horseradish.. i agree with Mallinda with having to exercise good judgement with the type of horseradish sauce you use.. if i had used my Inglehoffer Cream Style Horseradish it would have been way too strong.. in the end i did enjoy this dish and next time will cut back on the cheese a little more and i'm sure i'll absolutely love it.. ty for the recipe
