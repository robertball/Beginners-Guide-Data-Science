Im sorry for the extremely poor review but I have to be honest. This was one of the worst cakes. It was really dry and not that flavorful. Im trying to figure out if it was something that I did but I thought I followed the directions pretty throughly. If you or anyone could give me more advice on making the cake better that would be great because i'm pretty sure that this is a great cake but just made wrong
