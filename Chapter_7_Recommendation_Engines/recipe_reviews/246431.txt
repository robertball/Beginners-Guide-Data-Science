Darn good crackers. It took me a while to find rice bran, and found that using almond pulp (leftover from making almond milk) instead, works just as well. It seems that my flours have a different absorption rate, so I suggest that you mix your dry ingredients and maybe the oil, then add the water. I added the whole amount of water and had to nearly triple the flours to get a workable dough. The outcome was a crunchy, flavorful cracker that served quite nicely with hummus. I kept the remaining crackers in a Ziploc baggie and the next day they were as good as the day before. Thank you for the recipe.
