Made this dressing for a "ladies nite out" dinner get together,  loved it  and  some requested the recipe.  I did change it a bit.  I can't tolerate onions anymore, so I used onion powder instead. Also had 1/2 of an avocado leftover from the salad  so diced & tossed into dressing.   Thanks for a very easy, tasty dressing.

It's such a shame that this recipe ended its run on AR, along with its sponsor, Chileanavocados.org. It's awesome good.  Perfect just as written - luxuriously thick and creamy, subtley flavored with the green onion and basil with a just right tanginess (although I did reduce the vinegar just a smidge).  Best salad dressing, other than vinaigrettes, I've tried in a long time.

A very thick and creamy tasty dressing! a nice change from other types of salad dressings. I did however make small adjustments to the dressing. I added a tiny smidgen of minced garlic, from a jar, and 1/8 tsp salt instead of the 1/4 teaspoon called for in the recipe. I added fresh ground black pepper as well. Blended everything, tasted, blended some more. To me it was just right. I love the taste and flavor that the fresh basil adds in to the avocado. I chilled the dressing in the refrigerator until ready to serve. This dressing is a nice compliment to a bed of fresh Manoa Lettuce!

This was great! I did add a clove of garlic and some salt and cracked pepper after tasting and deciding that it needed just a little something extra. I loved the flavor of the basil in this. I could totally use this for a chip dip. I would definately make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
