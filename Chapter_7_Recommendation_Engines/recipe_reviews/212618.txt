I made this last night and it was pretty tasty. Only change I made was to leave out the onions, since I didn't have one, and I used regular cream of mushroom soup, not the roasted garlic variety. The sauce was delicious and I could not stop sneaking bites while I was finishing up cooking. Really easy, too. I think next time I might try to make it healthier by using reduced fat soup, fat free sour cream, and ground turkey instead of beef, and we'll see how it goes. The sauce as written is delicious, but pretty rich.

Ok, this is pretty darn good. But of course I never leave a recipe the same. I used cream of onion soup because thats what I had. I also fried the hamburger, added the rest of the ingredients and then mixed it with the noodles instead of serving it on top. I also added some spicy V8 because without it it seemed really thick and I knew I wanted to mix it with the noodles. My whole family loved it and I will be making this again. Just another tip use the low sodium taco seasoning because I didnt and it seemed way to salty or maybe only use half a packet.

It was only okay. It tasted like something was missing.

Making this recipe for dinner tonight. Have made it exactly as written many times and there's never any leftovers. The whole family loves it! Very simple to put together for an easy meal everyone will love. The roasted garlic mushroom soup makes a big difference, pick up a few cans and keep them in the pantry.

Very good spin off your regular stroganoff. Would be especially good with green onions and tomatoes as well.

This was soooo good and easy. I added a can of drained diced tomatoes and 3/4 of a container of mushrooms. I cooked them first with the onion and garlic. It was amazing. My family loved it. My husband loves spicy food so I added a little red and black pepper too. SOOOOO good.
