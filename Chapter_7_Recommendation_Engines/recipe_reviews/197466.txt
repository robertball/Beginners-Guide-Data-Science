This is definitely an interesting combination of flavors and textures. The sunflower seeds add a nice crunch. The combination of salt and sweet flavors works well in this dish.

These 3 ingredients work very well together!  Loved the sweetness of the watermelon paired with the saltiness of the feta and crunch of the sunflower seeds.  Super easy to throw together, but I would recommend not mixing till right before serving.

Simple 3 ingredient salad.  I made in individual bowls rather than tossing and mashing the feta cheese.  Thanks Jannet for providing a quick and easy summer salad.

I agree with the comment about tossing it at the last minute, or the watermelon dissolves and goes mushy. We added some chopped mint to the mix which gave it a nice bright twist. It's very simple to make and doesn't last long in the bowl.

I didn't have sunflower seeds so I used corn instead. Nice variation!

Just ok. After I tried it as written I added some mint and balsamic which made it better, I guess this may be an acquired type of dish

I made this but added some basil and some fresh lime.  The additional items made this so much better.
