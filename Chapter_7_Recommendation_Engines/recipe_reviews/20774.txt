This has been one of my favorite drinks for a few years.  One way to make this even better and cut back on ingredients is to buy pineapple orange juice. Do 1 part coconut rum to 2 parts pineapple orange with a dash of grenadine.

Good pool-side fruity drink.  Could also add club soda and/or a squeeze of lime to cut the sweetness a bit.

I didn't follow the proportions (didn't have the ability to actually measure it) but you can't really go wrong with this combination!

Very nice drink.  We've always got alcohol lying around never getting used, so I thought I'd try this today.  I don't like ice in drinks, but I wanted this to be cold so I decided I'd just go for it.  I don't have a way of crushing ice, though, other than going at it with a meat mallet, so I decided to pass and just use ice cubes.  I'm not feeling that energetic or destructive today.  I'm not sure if it's the oj or what, but something tastes almost (but not quite!) bitter in this.  So, I like it but maybe a bit less oj and a bit more pineapple  . . . not sure.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good. I opted to make a larger cocktail and used two shots of Parrot Bay and 6 oz. of pineapple juice.  Be careful, it's so smooth you may catch yourself overindulging.

This was a refreshing drink alongside the barbecue. It was a nice blend of delicious flavors, but my guests and I ended up chatting about and craving other drinks with those flavors - I didn't think the mix was memorable enough. It looks very pretty in the glass when the grenadine sinks to the bottom. Thanks for sharing.

Not bad, pretty easy to make. Also little to no alcohol taste, so if that's what you're going for, try this.

These were tasty and went down smooth.  Everyone who had one of these liked it, and they went fast.

Seeing that I love fruity drinks, it's no surprise how much I enjoyed this one. Thanks so much.
