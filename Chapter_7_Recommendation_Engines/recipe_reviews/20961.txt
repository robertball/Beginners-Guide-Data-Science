The ingredients are just right. For inexperienced cooks, a few suggestions: while the water in the double boiler is heating, don't place the top pan over the water yet. Mix the sugar, salt and cornstarch together in a bowl, add milk and eggs. Beat all together, pour into the room-temperature top part of double boiler. When water is boiling, lower to a simmer, and place top pan over water. This method prevents lumps, and keeps pudding from sticking to pan. We also like to top the pudding with a bit of whipped cream. Thanks for a great recipe, Sue.

I have now made this recipe around 10 times and have found this is the closest to "what grandma used to make".  I have found that this recipe can be doubled for taking to a dinner party.  Also everyone who has tried it raves about how good it is and how it is the best tasting 'nana puddin' they have had in a while.  

One thing that I have found improves the flavor greatly is to use more vanilla and also to use butter instead of margarine.  
Thanks again for the great recipe!

TERRIFIC!!  I wanted a recipe that had that old fashioned, made-from-scratch taste - THIS IS IT!!  My family loves it!!  I also added meringue and baked until it was a light brown.

Delicious, but a little too sweet.  Next time I'll use slightly less sugar and slightly less vanilla.

I have made this recipe 3 times now. The very first time I really wasnt sure about it, I am a beginner so I didnt see how those ingredients made pudding. Since banana pudding is my husbands favorite dessert I was really nervous especially since he is so in love with "granny's cooking" also it didnt smell that great while it was cooking. I finished it and he tried it, and he will never eat it any other way again! Granny makes it out of the box... This recipe has given me the confidence to make more things from scratch. Thank you soo much. Oh, and my compliments to Aunt Mamie, your tip helped me out! :)

This recipe is awesome! I don't like the boxed stuff...so I thought I would give this one a try. I don't have a double boiler so I just cooked it in a pot. The cornstarch is a bit off..so I added more and it thickened just right. I added a little bit more vanilla (we like the flavor). Also I mashed up my bananas and put them in the custard after it was cooked (personal preference). But it came out perfect! It's in the fridge chilling and we can't wait to dig in! I will definately use this recipe again! Thank you!!

yum! I like cooked homemade custard in my banana puddings instead of pudding mixes! I also like a meringue topping so I'm going to do like my mil does and use miniature marshmallows lightly browned in the oven. Don't want to waste extra yolks just to make meringue.  I think marshmallow is similar to meringue ..

The cornstarch ratio is off, I agree with another reviewer.  Once I had made it, I expected it to set, and When I took it to the cook out it was a sloopy mess, however ... the taste was ok, but it didn't look pretty.

I think there might be a wrong measurement with this one. I followed the recipe exactly and the cornstartch should probably be about 1/4 a cup not 2 tablespoons. The flavor was just OK but not as rich as I like. I would recommend if you make it to at least use whole milk, add another egg and maybe about 3 tablespoons butter.

I was making this recipe for a church potluck and was very disappointed. It turned out very runny (even when put in the fridge overnight).  I did get some good ideas on layering it though.  Here's a tip for you novices.  After you cut your bananas dip them quick into lemon juice.  I know it sounds crazy but it will prevent them from turning brown and make a prettier presentation.

I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and 2 tablespoons of butter instead of what the recipe called for.  This recipe is as close to the one I remember my mother making.  Very Good...

I try to watch my sugar intake so I made this with Splenda (3/4 cup instead the 1/2 cup of white sugar) and it was pretty good. I also topped it with more vanilla wafers.

I used the advice from another reviewer to mix ingredients prior to the double broiler...definitely easier.  Also, I added fresh ground cinnamon on top mixed with a dash of nutmeg.  It looked pretty and added a little extra favor.

My southern husband LOVES this banana pudding. It's definitely worth making it "real" - and no harder than using the instant stuff. Thank you!! (5/13 - I tried this using Splenda, skim milk, Egg Beaters & sugar free wafers. It was excellent - couldn't tell the difference!)

Great recipe, simple an old fashioned how it should be! Didn't care much for the double broiler part as it took forever but I just used a pot instead, I use those rubber spatulas an that keeps it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Very tasty!! Loved it!

This was a great recipe! I have eaten the cooked version before but this was my first time making it myself. This is obviously a little more time consuming than the simple "use the pudding mix" version, but if given the choice I would rather have this any day! I didn't use a double boiler but just kept the heat low enough and watched the pudding mixture very closely. I also made the meringue topping for mine. It was heavenly! And even better cold!! This will be a regular on my dessert list!

just likes my grandmother's famous recipe. I only modified it by separating the eggs, adding two more to the pudding itself and using the original eggs for the meringue my grandmother always used

Very good old fashioned pudding, I made as directed with the exception of the double boiler,I have a old pressure cooker pan that is thick & heavy. It works great for pudding & I stir constantly with a spatular & the pudding comes out perfect.

I just made this recipe for the first time. My husband and I both agree that it is great!  Next time  I may add meringue to the top and bake it until it's brown like another reviewer suggested.

This is very good and I do not care for banana stuff! My husband on the other hand loves banana pudding. So I thought I would give it a try. This is a very delicious recipe and one I'll use for a good time to come!  I do not own a boiler however so I just used two pans; one with water and the other to cook the pudding. Took me a little longer to cook it that way but it worked out well. At the end I added 2 tsp vanilla flavor though. Extra vanilla will never hurt anything. Next time I make this I will be doubling the pudding recipe though as I like it in a 13x9 inch dish and this recipe isn't big enough for that. My husband says to say thank you because now I can make this for him! Nothing better then homemade and not the instant pudding!

Love this recipe. It is exactly like the banana pudding I had as a child in my grandmother's kitchen. Thank you so much for posting this. I will be using it from now on.

This is really good.  I didn't use a double boiler.  I just used a normal pot with a thick, even heat distribution bottom and whisked continuously until thickened (5-10 minutes).  I did not use butter or vanilla (forgot) and it was still really wonderful.  I only used 2 bananas.  Loved it warm with the vanilla wafer cookies.  Will definitely make again.  Super easy.

THIS PUDDING WAS THE STAR OF THE SHOW! We invited my husbands friends over for dinner for the first time and I must say, they were thoroughly impressed.  Especially since they thought I slaved over a hot stove for hours making this delicious treat. It was surprisingly easy even though I didn't even have a double boiler.  I made it work with my own makeshift double boiler.  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!

I used nonfat milk and skipped the vanilla wafers and it was still super delicious. I am never making instant pudding again with such an easy recipe to use for homemade pudding! (Even better chilled in the fridge with the sliced bananas)

We've made this recipe about 7 times in all now and it is just like my husband remembers making with his mother. Hubby is diabetic now and sugar-free vanilla wafers and sugar substitute taste no different. We don't use a double boiler either.

Delicious.  I made this in an 8X8" pan, but found there wasn't enough pudding to completely cover 2 layers of vanilla wafers.  I recommend using a smaller dish than that, or using only one layer of wafers, but that's just my personal preference.

Excellent!  I made my in the microwave... Took less than 10 minutes (but I may have a fast microwave).   I read someone else had done it that way, too, but there were no instructions.  I looked at a recipe for rice pudding and some of the ingredients were very similar, so I just followed that.  Beat eggs, add milk, sugar, cornstarch and salt.  Mix well.  Microwave on high (in a microwavable dish - I use an 8 cup pyrex measuring dish because this does bubble up) for 2 minutes, stir and then nuke at 50% stirring every 2 minutes until it thickens.  Mine only took about 6 minutes... It will take almost double the time if you double it.    Thank you Vette!

Loved it. The only thing I changed was adding half a mashed banana to the mixture, and nixing about a 1/3 or 1/4 of the sugar. Not too sweet, great texture.

Excellent recipe.  I added an extra Tbsp of cornstarch and couple of Tbsp of sugar but otherwise followed the recipe closely.  Took longer than the 15 minutes to thicken in the double boiler (about 25) but turned out great.

This is the recipe I've been looking for!  It's just like my Grandma used to make.  Taking the advice of another reviewer, I mixed everything together in the top of the double boiler and then put it over the simmering water.  To make it prettier, I topped it with crushed vanilla wafers.  This was perfect! Thanks!

This recipe is great! My husband and I love it, and it is very easy to make. I add some whip topping on top when I serve it and it kind of tastes like banana cream pie. Absolutely delicious and better than any boxed pudding!!

Great recipe and the only true banana pudding, in my opinion. The cooked custard adds a dimension that instant pudding cannot.  The only thing I have always done is to separate the eggs and save the whites for a meringue.  But as an alternative, we use refrigerated whipped topping also.  Thanks for sharing the old-fashioned banana pudding that I have eaten since the 1940s--just like my grandmother prepared and probably her mother before her.

I love this recipe. I only like original homemade banana pudding. That instant stuff will never do. The smell of this simmering over the stove was wonderful. I didn't have a double boiler so a regular sauce pan works fine. I agree with another review and I mixed my eggs, sugar, cornstarch and milk before placing it over heat. Add wafers and bananas to taste. I like more wafers and less bananas. I took this to work and they LOVED IT. The absolutely cleaned the bowl.

A good base recipe; you can customize as needed. I didn't find it necessary to use a double boiler for the custard - just do it in a saucepan on low heat whisking constantly until it thickens (and registers to 170 on a thermometer).

Great pudding recipe!  I make it for 6 serving, put first 6 ingredients in 8 cup Pyrex, mocrowave 3 minutes on high then put in saucepan and over simmering water. Cooks much faster with no lumps. Use it for banana pudding, fruit trifles and plain

I thought I would give this a try even after reading comments saying it never thickened up, because I've made all sorts of custards and puddings before, and never had a problem. Problem! This never thickened up! Even after 35 minutes of cooking and after the addition of 2 more tablespoons of cornstarch. It did not even taste good. Don't know what went wrong, but I'll stick to my trusted pudding recipe next time. I wanted to try something different for Easter dessert, After using up the last of the milk, the last 2 eggs, and the last drop of vanilla(I only added the vanilla after cooking, to see if this recipe could be salvaged as a sauce or something) and with all the stores closed on Easter, I had to think on the fly and come up with something to make with the bananas and vanilla wafers. I spread peanut butter on the bottom of the wafers, put a sliced banana on top of the peanut butter, and made sandwiches. I froze them, then dipped in melted chocolate chips, topped with Easter sprinkles, then refroze. They were fantastic and everyone raved! Anyways, kudos to whoever is able to make this recipe, and good luck to whomever tries!

I LOVE this recipe! It's easy and delicious.  For some strange reason, my double boiler has gone missing and the last two times I have made it, I prepared it without a double boiler, cooking it slowly and watching it/stirring it constantly.  Both times, it came out fine. You just cannot take your eyes off it it!

Great Recipe! thank you to Vette 66 :) 
My boys have texture issues so I pureed the bananna and only put in a half cup of milk. It was 95 today so I microwaved it, stirring every 2 min....it eneded up being about 6-8 mins. total, then I used the stick blender to smooth it out. Turned out great. So easy and quick.. will never buy boxed pudding again :)

This recipe is to die for, fantastic! All I did was add extra vanila since all I had was imitation and doubled it. Hubby just couldn't resist in helping out, adding the wafers and the banana's. We like a lot of wafers and used the whole box. Ten star rating from us. Thank you VETTE66

Alright, I think the corn starch amount is off by a lot... my pudding took MUCH longer, and I mean much, to thicken. I was expecting it to start right away but it didn't. A good recipe, but I changed a few things. Also, this was my first try at any kind of pudding.

This recipe is very close to my mother's, but if you really want a treat try using Pepperidge Farm's Chessmen instead of the vanilla waffers.  I also think that 2 or 3 egg whites were wipped with a little sugar to get that beautiful topping in the picture which the recipe's author left out.

I have never had banana pudding this way before so I'm not sure what it was suppose to taste like.  It was pretty good but next time i'll cut back on the sugar.  I will make this again but I might blend in some softened cream cheese.  I also made it with homemade vanilla wafers from this site and it was the perfect texture....with NO corn syrup or hydrogenated oils which most of the boxed wafers have. Very pleased.

This recipe was very tasty!  You have to be careful while cooking the pudding,or it will stick.  I made it in 3 layers and made a meringue broiled on top.  I was pleased with the results.

Horrible. Did not set up at all. I had to add more cornstarch. The taste was very bland. I added more bananas and some cinnamon and nutmeg. I guess it turned out ok after I fixed it, but it's not worth making again. I'll find a different recipe.

Don't expect anything fancy, this is pretty much vanilla pudding over bananas and vanilla wafers. The homemade pudding is what makes it special. This is such comfort food!

This tasted really good.  The cookies tended to take on a mushy form after drenching them with the pudding.  The bananas were great.  I'm glad the pudding wasn't banana flavored too, that would have been overkill.  As it was the bananas were pungent yet subtle enough to bring a smile.

This was easy and delicious.  I used a mix of half and half and 2% milk and a bit more vanilla.   It's a lighter texture and taste than the pudding made using condensed milk.  You don't really have to use a double boiler.  But blend the ingredients together before heating and be very careful to stir constantly while cooking so it doesn't burn.

It was a little too sweet for me, so I used a little less sugar and less vanilla. 
I also mixed in old ripe thawed bananas from the freezer, and chopped the fresher bananas and mixed them in for texture. 

I was having problems getting it to thicken in my makeshift bowl double boiler too, so I put it in a saucepan on med. heat and used a spatula to make sure it got stirred well, and got a thermometer. It *HAS* to reach at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit to start thickening - once mine reached that temp it immediately started to thicken, and I let it do its thing for a few more minutes before taking it off heat and mixing in vanilla and butter and my ripe old bananas.

I took the advice of Aunt Mamie and this is the old-fashioned  way for banana pudding, the pudding is not too sweet (compared to boxed or instant).  Used organic milk and pure cane sugar, organic milk tends to be a tad thicker.  The serving size, in my opinion, is closer to six.  For those trying to avoid  the boxed stuff, this is it.  Now I have to  find a recipe for homemade Nilla Wafers :-).  This will be my 'go to'.

This pudding turned out really good. The recipe was easy to follow and and quick. It may have been smoother if I had used just egg yolks but I went ahead and used whole eggs.  I added double the vanilla as I like a good vanilla favor.  Also, turned out the box of vanilla wafers I evidently had for far too long, was rancid.  Ugh.  So, I used ginger snaps instead which added a nice flavor. Think it would help to know that this pudding fits nicely into a 1.5 quart bowl and it really makes more like 6-8 generous servings.

I just made this recipe - I did not use a double boiler I used a no stick pot, I tried to get the pudding to ribbon, but it just wouldn't do it for me. No problem.
After I added the butter and vanilla I also stired in 1 cup of milk chocolate chips.  It is in the fridge cooling off.  But it tastes great hot. Next time I will try adding 2 mashed banana's instead of chocolate chips. (the experiments just never stop with me)

I haven't made this recipe yet but it looks like what I was looking for.  I have one question.  Any time I have made pudding before, I always separate the eggs and use the yolks only.  I am hesitant to include the whites to the pudding, thinking it will not be as smooth.  Any comments will be appreciated.

The taste was great, but the consistency wasn't right (mealy or almost curddled). The reviews were either 4* or 1*, so I figured that It was me! I pulled out my trusty Joy of cooking and studied up on cornstarch. For those of us that had issues, the pudding was either overcooked or cooked at too high of a temperature. Hope this is helpful!

I tried to get this pudding set up without luck. Substituted the vanilla extract with banana flavored extract for better flavor. On the plus side, I like that this makes smaller servings.

Wow.  I grew up in Virginia and had my grandma's banana pudding at least twice a month. Didn't actually realize that it was a "Southern Recipe" until I started craving it and looking around online for an easy fix.  And it WAS easy.  Just as the recipe calls for, I just mixed everything together and started cooking. I don't own a double broiler, so I just threw it in a pot, brought it to boil, and then simmered.  The only change I made was adding about a tsp of cinnamon (which I always do to my vanilla pudding).  Great texture and flavor. Tastes like my childhood!

Awesome.  I haven't had this in a long time and almost forgot about it.  I made it twice so far, once for me and my husband and once for a picnic.  It is so good and the pudding is easier than I thought. Just be sure to stir dry ingredients and then add them to the wet and keep stirring the pudding until thick.  It took me a little longer than suggested.

I did not care for this. Followed the recipe exactly.  After 25 minutes over the double boiler I still had vanilla soup. DEFINITELY will not make again.

Delish!  

We have a food dye allergy in our family so pudding had been a no no for many months.  I had an abundance of bananas and found this recipe that didn't use any instant pudding.  

I followed the recipe and had no problems, but I do have experience with eggs and double boilers.  It was pretty easy and tastes great!  It very much reminds me of going to Grandma's house for dinner.

This will be a staple recipe that I plan on experimenting with.

People do not try to attempt making this. I should have read the reviews before making. I wasted my time and my ingredients.

Eh--not what I was hoping for. Was kinda yummy when it was warm, but after it cooled, the texture just wasn't what I was expecting. Too....mealy, or something. Will have to keep looking for a banana pudding recipe. Sorry!

This was more like banana custard. I really didn't care too much for this recipe. I guess I am one of the few who prefers to make banana pudding with the "fake" stuff because of the smoother texture. Also, I found this tasted better cold than warm, just my personal preference.
