Wanted something with a little pizzaz for my bagels this morning instead of the usual plain cream cheese so decided to give this a try. I was not disappointed :-) One thing about turmeric is that the amount used in prepared mustards barely affects the mustard flavor but rather is used for its yellow color; it's the color of the seed used that affects the flavor so just use your favorite prepared mustard. My favorite is Grey Poupon Dijon so that is what I used. If you want more 'heat' then my all means use English mustard called for in this recipe or mix Colman's powder with equal amounts of water but add it to taste because Colman's is 'very' hot ;-)

I used whipped cream cheese, turkey ham and dijon mustard. I did add a good amount garlic powder and some fresh ground pepper. The kids and I had this spread on toasted bagels the next morning with a sliced tomato on top--very good.

This was good, although I didn't have the English mustard with tumeric.   I would use a lot more green onions next time - they add a really nice flavor, also I used more ham than was called for.  Next time I will try to have the right mustard on hand.  Thanks!
