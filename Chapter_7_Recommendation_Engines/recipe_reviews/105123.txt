Only problem was it is a little bit dry, but the flavor is so great it makes up for it.

Great recipe! Simple, fresh, and a no-brainer for a basil lover! I added some crushed red peppers to the oil for a little zing.

It was quick and easy, and tasty. I added a clove of garlic with the olive oil.

Terrific, quick & easy !  My whole family enjoyed this as a fast weeknight meal.  Didn't have any basil on hand but had fresh parsley, chopped that up and sauteed with garlic and a little hot pepper flakes then tossed in the shrimp.  After cooking and draining linguini, I tossed that right into the pan with the other ingredients to combine well.  It was DELICIOUS- will definitely make again!
