I have made this recipe twice now...once for just my family, the second time for a large crowd.  Both times received raved reviews.  Here are the changes I made:

The first time for just the family I cut the recipe in half, replaced all the meats with boneless, skinless chicken breasts, did not saute the onions or celery, used one can of Rotel and one smaller can of diced tomatoes and put it all in the crock pot and cooked on low for 8 hours.  About an hour before dinner I took out the chicken, shredded it, returned it to the pot and added 1 cup frozen corn, one can cream style corn and 1 cup each frozen okra slices and baby limas.  My 14 year old said, "Mom, this is the best stew we've ever had!"

When I made it for a large group (60 people) I tripled the recipe and replaced the meats with a pre-cooked sliced brisket that I chopped up, again used a mixture of Rotel and canned diced tomatoes  and added more of the extra vegetables at the end as before.  It was an all-out hit.  Everyone loved the slight sweetness that the barbeque sauce gave it. (I used Kraft Hickory Smoked.)

Thanks for a great recipe!

I too am in VA, where brunswick stew becomes a household staple during hunting season.  Scratch the ground meats, use pulled pork, roast or steak.  Add a pkg. of frozen lima beans.  Also switch to niblet corn (1 can) 2 cans cream corn.  A little old bay definitely helps as well.  This is a lot less expensive and much better tasting than the $10 pint we get from the Ruritan Clubs.  Freezes beautifully.

Compared recipes and took best of each - used crock pot, served with cornbread.  Changes: 2lbs. boneless chicken thighs, 1lb. leftover pork roast, 1/2 cup diced smoked ham, plus 2 slices crumbled turkey bacon in place of all meats. Added 1/2 cup sliced okra, 2 cups lima beans, 1 clove minced garlic, 1 can chicken broth, dash of worcestershire.  Replaced ketchup with tomato puree and creamed corn with 2 cups frozen.  Increased BBQ sauce to 1 cup. Wonderful aroma!

Absolutely the BEST stew I've ever had!  I was a little sceptical when reading the ingredients and noticed there were no potatos, but WOW! The only change I made was that I left out the chicken and added stew meat that I floured and browned before adding to the mixture.  Hubby loved it too.  Thanks for sharing this one!

As a girl who grew up in Georgia and has lately been living in Colorado, it's so great to have a recipe for this, as you won't find it anywhere outside the South and the only way I can get it is to make it myself!  This recipe turned out great, just like it should have tasted!  The only modification I made was to use only one can of the creamed corn (not being a huge fan of canned cream corn) and added additional frozen corn kernals.  Also, a couple notes-Hot Sauce (like Tobasco) is essential, not so much to make it spicy but to really give it the flavor that makes it brunswick stew.  Also, many southerners would never add vegetables (potatoes, green beans, oh the sacrilige!!).  So, if you want a true brunswick stew, stick to the basics (onion, etc.) in the recipe.  Also, instead of the ground pork it is also good with shredded pork roast.  This is especially great when eaten with BBQ on a fall Saturday afternoon watching a football game!  Thanks so much for a great recipe!!

Aw, shucks!  It didn't get me a husband!  I really prefer using beef, pork and chicken cubes, rather than the ground, and shredded meat. I often adapt this to my slow cooker.

I made this stew when having a large group over to eat outdoors. Cooked this in my cast iron dutch oven using charcole under the oven and on top of the lid. Every drop of this stew was eaten and I used a 12" oven! 
I did use 2 cans cream style corn and one can of whole kernel corn.  So very good with cornbread!.

I don't know if this will get anyone a husband, but the one I have loved it.  I am somewhat embarrassed to say that we had leftovers for breakfast this morning! The barbeque flavor in this stew is just right.

This was great! The barbecue sauce gave it a unique flavor (at least for this northern girl). I used shredded beef and pork instead of the ground meat, and added about 1/4 cup of Jack Daniels. Delicious.

This was excellent. I will make it again.
I only added too cans of the creamed corn, though, because I tasted it after that amount and thought it might taste a little too "canned" if I added more. I also added one package of baby lima beans.

This recipe is delicious the way it is written.  I like to try a recipe as close to the way the author writes it the first time.  If I don't it's not fair for me to bash the recipe because I am not even reviewing the actual posted recipe.  The only thing I was forced to change was the ground pork because the store didn't have any.  I substituted andouille sausage.  This was the best Brunswick Stew I have ever made (so I am sticking with the andouille substitution).  Next time I may try adding a can of lima beans & some cubed potatoes but I dunno, it's pretty dang perfect the way it is.  Thanks for sharing : )  added 2/1/09:  I made it again using a grocery store prepackaged tub of shredded BBQ pork instead of ground pork & added 2 cans of lima beans (juice included)/  It's still delicious!!

Excellent!  This is definately one that I will pass along to friends and family.  Instead of the meats listed, I used 2 pounds of hamburger and about 2 cups of shredded pork loin.

My family absolutely loved this!  I made quite a few changes, because I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand.  I also used a crock pot and cooked it all day.  Mid-morning I put into the crock pot a 2.5 lb frozen pork roast, about 1.5 lbs frozen boneless/skinless chicken thighs, and 1 lb frozen ground beef.  I added three cans of diced tomatoes, some dried minced onions, and salt & pepper.  Late-afternoon I shredded the pork (the chicken & beef had already fallen apart) and added about 1.5 cups of frozen corn, another tsp salt, some Old Bay, and some celery salt.  I didn't add the hot sauce to the crock pot because my kids wouldn't like it.  I sprinkled 3-4 drops of Tobasco into my bowl of stew, and that was perfect for me.  I might have another bowl right now!

None of my family members liked it. I really disliked the sweet taste of the soup. Second of all, besides having a bad taste, it was very bland ingredients wise.   I definitely wouldn't make this again as a soup - however, I think it has potential as a dip. If I decreased the liquid, added more salt, and changed a few things here and there, I think this would be a decent dip.

They say 5 stars means "the best" and this IS the best Brunswick stew I've eaten or made. The different meats give it a really good flavor so definitely use the ground pork if you can. I used leftover turkey rather than chicken (can't wait to use leftover smoked turkey). You don't have to shred it as it shreds while it cooks. I only used half a pound of each ground meat as prior reviews said it was too meaty. I used diced tomatoes so I wouldn't have to chop the whole tomatoes. I added some liquid smoke because most Brunswick stews used smoked meats. I used only 2 cans of creamed corn. I added half a bag of frozen lima beans. Do not overdo the bbq sauce, use just the 1/2 cup stated. I did the green pepper as stated but I wonder why you can't just chop it and sautee with the onion & celery?? I think small cubes of potato would be good in this but wanted to try it without first. We ate this with cornbread and it was a great meal!

There aren't enough stars to rate this!  THIS IS WONDERFUL!!!  MY GOODNESS!!  It looks intimating, but if i can make it, you can!  We ate this up until we were stuffed there were still plenty of left overs.  Even my picky 7 year old loves it and wants me to make it again... SOON!!
   Using others comments this is how i made mine.  I cut the original recipe in half and did this (much like the original):
3 chicken breast, 1 lb mild Italian Sausage, 1 lb ground meat, (I let the meet cook chunky instead of making it fine. and while that was cooking boiled the chicken and then cubed it instead of shredding it) when the meats were almost done cooking, added 2 stalks of celery, 1/2 cup onion, to cook for a couple minutes. Then combined the meats and 2 cans of diced tomatoes, 1/2 cup Ketchup, 1/2 cup BBQ sauce,  and half a green pepper, dash of hot sauce, salt & pepper. 
Let that cook covered for 2 hrs on low/med. then added 1 can of creamed corn and 1 can of corn nibbles(drained). let it cook (uncovered) for 45 min. served with cornbread.  AWESOME!!!!  I WILL DEFIANTLY MAKE THIS AGAIN!!! SOON!!

I love Brunswick Stew when it is made right.  I have never made it though, until I tried this last week.  It make a large amount for my family of 4 so I thought I would be able to freeze some.  This stew received rave reviews and was gone the next day.  Now my husband is begging me to make more this week.  Thanks for an awesome recipe.

Subbed leftover pork loin for the ground pork, omitted the ground beef and used a container of bbq shredded chicken instead of deboning one.  Dreamland bbq sauce and a bag of frozen lima beans.

I love this recipe expect for one thing. The first time I made this I just added the 3 cans of cream corn at the end. It went from brunswick stew to cream corn stew. 3 cans is too much. I now add 1 can of cream corn and a bag of frozen sweet corn.

My husband actually quipped that this is "Lose a Husband Brunswick Stew".   Three hours is a long time to wait for a bowl of hickory flavored meat water.  I can't justify the price for all of the ingredients since this amounted to one meal for my family - they didn't want the leftovers.

We've never had anything like it.  We enjoyed it, but I don't know if it will get on the "when will you make it again list" but rather the I'll make it again from time to time and we all thought it was good but not great.  It was a little on the sweet side so I think I would add spice.

This was very good and quite easy to make. I added frozen lima beans since most recipes for Brunswick Stew include this. I also added 4 potatoes and 6 would have been better, they add some substance.

I am from VA about 30 miles from Brunswick.  The stew to me,  tasted more like vegetable soup.  The soup tasted good but didn't resemble a true Brunswick stew.

I was surprised at how good this is!  I made the recipe exactly as printed except I bought some pulled pork from a local BBQ guy and used that instead of ground.  I also used a broiled chicken from the grocery store to speed prep.  Since some of the reviews said it was dry, I covered the pot for most of the cooking time and it wasn't dry at all.  I also think using a BBQ sauce that isn't too sweet helps a lot.

This is a wonderful recipe...and yes, my husband LOVES it.  I have made it twice now.  The first time, I used Bullseye BBQ sauce and found it a bit too sweet for my liking.  This time, I used one by Kraft and it was perfect.  We add a good deal of hot sauce because we like the added kick, but it certainly very tasty without.

This stew was awesome!  I don't have to drive all the way to Georgia next time I want some Brunswick stew!  I used all shredded chicken, a little extra Kraft Honey Hickory BBQ sauce, 2 cans of creamed corn, 1 can of Niblet corn, 1 cup each frozen okra and lima beans.  It was terrrific!  I had to freeze a whole gallon freezer bag of this stuff AFTER my husband and I had it for dinner and I sent some in our lunch boxes for today (with an extra serving for my coworker who always tastes my experiments!).  I served mine with some sweet cornbread.  Delicious!

This was ok at best. I followed other's suggestions and used pulled meats instead. I also followed other's suggestions and bought the pulled meats in BBQ sauce and did NOT add anymore BBQ sauce. Well, I think this made the whole stew taste like BBQ sauce and was not very good. It tasted like it belonged on a sandwich not like a "stew" at all. It was overwhelming with BBQ flavor despite not adding anymore. Waste of ingredients as far as I'm concerned.

My grocery store was selling pork butts for 75 cents a lb.  So, I was able to get an 8 lb pork butt for cheep! I cut the butt in half and put it in my crockpot with some white wine and chicken stock and let it cook till I could pull it apart about 7-8 hours on low.  I let it cool and shredded it by hand that way I could get all of the fat out.  There was enough meat to replace the ground meat and chicken.  I would recommend a spice or hickory flavored bbq sauce mine was too sweet and that was with one can of cream corn.   I cater some at the church I work at and this is a great cheap meal to serve to a crowd.  If you are catering I added a few more cans of tomatoes to stretch it out and it worked great.

This was wonderful even on a summer day!!  I used 2 cans of cream corn and one of regular corn (that's what I had on hand).  I tasted it as is and loved it but wanted to add some wor sauce and it was wonderful!

After reading all the rave reviews about this recipe, I decided that I had to try it.  My husband took one bite and said, "This is the best thing I've ever eaten in my life"! (Doesn't say much for the rest of my cooking.)

Well, it got me a husband!  And now, he asks for this stew every month or so.  I leave out the ground pork and use a few pieces of crumbled bacon instead.  I also add a can of lima beans because that's how my dad made it.

This is delicious, and easy to fix!  

I rate it 4 stars, but with some minor adjustments it gets five.

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, spicy pork sausage in lieu of ground pork, and ground buffalo in lieu of ground beef.  I added lima beans and okra to get some extra nutrition into it, and replaced the ketchup with an extra can of diced tomatoes (I felt that much ketchup would make the end result too sweet).  

End result was wonderful -- hearty and satisfying and great for cold weather.  My first thought on tasting it was "This tastes like autumn."  The barbeque sauce brings a rich deep flavor that went wonderfully with the meats, with hints of sweetness balanced by spicy notes.  Using chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken and buffalo instead of beef cut some calories, and the extra veggies added nutrition, so it became a healthful and delicious one pot meal.

A few tips ... this makes a LOT!  My ground meats came in 1lb packages, so I had less meats than called for, but even so, this filled my 20 qt stock pot about 2/3 full.

Also -- it's thick.  Very thick.  It took a lot of stirring to keep it from burning on the bottom (though that's partly due to my stock pot being not the greatest pot in the world).

This was quite good.  I've only made Brunswick stew a few times before and only used chicken but the pork and beef add great flavor and texture.  I followed the recipe exactly except for one thing:  instead of 3 cans of creamed corn I used 2 and added a can of lima beans.  I have to have lima beans in my Brunswick stew.  I also used a store-bought rotisserie chicken to save time.  Delish!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Pretty good.  My daughter and husband thought it was wonderful, my son said it was okay (but he is a very picky eater).  I thought it tasted like bbq pork or something.  I had some ground lamb so I added that as well.  I may make this again, but it is not a MUST do again.

I wasn't initially as crazy about the sweetness but hubby absolutely loved it. I made it with only chicken and cubed pork (leftover Kalua Pig recipe from this site) and subbed diced tomatoes and niblets. Maybe a personal preference, but I agree with another reviewer that there wasn't enough liquid. Mine came out like a thick, chunky sauce, so I added more liquid.

A Virginia staple. I absolutely love this stew. I remember having it growing up but of course back then they used whatever meat the hunted. I much prefer the chicken and beef now (I've been away from the country too long). I make this almost exactly as it is written. The only difference is I use 2 cans of cream style and 1 can of niblets. My family and friends always rave when I make this. Make sure you cook this for at least an hour. Of course the longer you let it simmer, the more flavor you'll have. I usually make it in the morning and let it simmer all day. DELICIOUS!

This was so good! I used Carolina style BBQ sauce by KC Masterpiece instead of the hickory style. I added a can of lima beans. My family (husband and parents) really enjoyed it. We served it with a French Bread recipe from this website.

I made this stew with shredded chicken, pork, and beef instead of ground meats b/c that's how we used to make it growing up in VA.  It was very good, and a hit with my family.  But, I still feel like something is missing.  I'll play around with it a little more next time.

Being a Brunswick Co. VA native - this is not 'technically' Brunswick Stew.  This does sound like a good soup. But honestly I don't feel it should be called Brunswick Stew.

I've never made Brunswick Stew and this came out delicious! My boy friend loved :) Substitutions I made: instead of ground pork I used precooked pulled pork. (1-1/2 containers), only 1 can creamed corn & 2 cans whole kernel corn, diced tomatoes, add almost half the bottle of hot sauce since we love spicey food, 3 lbs chicken breasts instead of whole chicken. Luckily you can play around with the recipe some and still turns out great. I also made Mexican Cornbread with this & that was a great combo!

Followed this recipe and was not happy with this one.  Tasted like warm BBQ sauce with a hint of tomato and a bag of sugar on top!  Very disappointed.

If you've never had Brunswick Stew, this is a good stew, but not as good as the Brunswick stew I grew up with in the south.  I only used 2 cans of creamed corn and still found it be way too sweet.  If I make this again I'll use a spicy BBQ sauce vs. a sweet hickory smoked.  Update: Froze the leftovers and nobody touched them for months; had to throw it all out. What a waste.

Good Recipe.  I omitted the ground pork, and ground beef and substituted sliced smoked sausage and beef stew cubes. Did not do the hickory BBQ sauce, just a regular BBQ sauce. These were the only changes I made , My family does'nt like ground meat in stews, and none of us like the hickory, but with these adaptations , it was great for us.  Being in Brunswick Ga., the home of Brunswick Stew, this was a pretty good Recipe.

This is absolutely perfect!!  Here in VA, falling leaves and pumpkins bring clubs cooking huge kettles of Brunswick Stew.  It usually sells for around $5 a quart.  My 15 yr. old son can easily eat a qt. by himself. Needless, to say, it is cheaper to make on my own.  This was my first shot at Brunswick Stew...Yes, even though I have lived in Brunswick Stew Land for 15 years. This is definitely a recipe to pass down to my children. Being from Colorado, where Brunswick Stew is unheard of..."Get a Husband Brunswick Stew" will be on my menu list when my family comes to visit!!   I did add baby lima beans and okra, as this is what they do here in Virginia.  My kids don't care for lima beans, but no one complained with this recipe!  We have eight children and not one of them was satisfied with one bowl of this!!  Thanks so much!

I was unable to find any ground pork at our small local grocery store so I ended up using pork sausage instead. I'm sure it changed the flavor but the soup was still a huge hit. Now I'm not sure if I will continue to use the sausage or try it next with the plain ground pork (why change a successful experiment). I served the soup along with a spinach salad and home made corn muffins. The guests we had over for dinner said it was the "homiest" meal they have had in a long time and raved about it the rest of the evening! The men in the group felt it was a perfect meal to warm you up on a cool fall night and asked the wives to make some for their deer hunting camps. I have to say that's one of the best compliments a cook can recieve around this area. I will definately save this recipe and pass it on to my own grandchildren some day.

I decided to make this dish for my girlfriend since she's from Georgia. OH MY GOD, this is one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten. I picked it because of the high reviews. Once I cooked it for her, her and her entire family loved it so much! There was even leftovers for the next 2 days because there was so much!!!

Because they kept talking about how great it was, I've had friends come up to me and kept saying they want me to make it for them to try. I definitely will keep using this recipe for the rest of my life.

The ingredients might freak you out with how much ketchup and/or barbeque sauce is asks for, but trust me! It does not over power it at all! It's all the perfect amount of ingredients.

A bit too sweet for our tastes but very good.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs as the only meat in the recipe and chopped the bell pepper before use.

A great stew concept....made quite a few changes to make it great. Added one 32 ounce box of chicken stock, one chopped ham steak, one bag of of large limas, one can of corn drained, one can of sliced carrots chopped, 1 tbsp garlic powder and one can of chopped whole potatoes and 2 tbsp liquid smoke. This filled a huge stock pot and was wonderful.

We used leftover smoked pork and some leftover beef brisket.  My wife also accidentally added wing sauce instead of hot sauce....still delicious!  We fed this to a large group and everyone LOVED it.  Kids loved it too.  Great for leftovers.

I'm giving this stew 4 stars because I made quite a lot of adjustments as previous reviewers had stated. I added 1# each of ground beef, pork sausage, and leftover grilled shredded chicken(white & dark meat). This still was a ton of meat, but not overwhelming. Also added 1/2 of a bag og frozen corn, and baby limas, 1 can of creamed corn, & left out the ketchup. It was still pretty sweet. Next time I would like to use roast instead of ground, and put in more limas. Still really tasty. My 2, 5, & 11 year olds gobbled it up!!

This is an exceptional recipe. I grew up with Brunswick Stew my whole life and it was the center of community fundraisers and home cooked meals. I did alter a few things by adding on 2 cans of creamed corn and 2 cans of whole kernel. I also added 2 cans of crushed tomatoes and 1 can of whole vs the 3 whole tomatoes.  I added a bag of the frozen lima beans and some cayenne pepper and hot sauce to taste. I didn't add the celery. I found that the hickory bbq sauce added a nice smokey flavor and was delish!!!

I went ahead and chopped the green pepper and put it in. I also went ahead and added the corn. That;s the way we did it growing up. Throw it all in the pot and cook it. Yummy!@

I made this a few weeks ago using some pulled pork I had in the freezer and we loved it!  This was the only meat I put in.  The husband, from Alabama, said it was the closest and best to what he's had in Alabama.  I'm making it again today :)  Definitely a keeper.

I prefer to use frozen cream style corn in my soups and stews rather than canned.  A couple of those frozen "tubes" of corn will easily substitute for 3 cans, and you won't have that tin can taste screwing up what is otherwise a fine stew.

Great! My 17 month old devoured it! I used already cooked chicken I had in the fridge. I also added kielbasa and green beans. No creamed corn, so I used frozen and a little milk. I used honey barbecue sauce as well.

I made this recipe just as it is and it is awsome!!! We are having a "Western New Year's Eve Party" and want to have Brunswick stew on the menu.
I bought stew from three different restaurants to try and didn't like any of them so I decided to look for a recipe and make it myself. 
After reading the reviews this was the obvious recipe to try. This sooo good and everyone that has tried it, loved it! 
I did use a rotisary chicken already cooked to save time and cleanup.  
Doesn't get any better than this! Thank you Rakestraw!

I used one of the revised recipes with prepared chopped bbq chicken in a pouch. GREAT! I also added about a 1/4 tsp. of cayenne. This is quick ( I don't understand why this needs 3 hours to cook, easy and delicious. I hope my FH will like this. My whole house is smelling so good. I seasoned with a bbq seasoning (which had some celery salt in it), salt, pepper in addition to the cayenne. I added lima beans based on other comments but 1 can was not enough. I had a can of kidney beans so I threw that in, too.(no nasty comments, I had it so I used it)Next time I will use a frozen bag of limas. Thanks!

This was stew, but not traditional Brunswick stew which was prettty disappointing considering the effort and expense. It's good and hearty. I should have known that since it didn't call for lima beans or bread crumbs that it wouldn't be what I was expecting. I won't make it again; I 'll keep looking for a traditionaal version.

This wasn't bad.  I read the reviews and used a pork roast, a beef roast and a rotisserie chicken.  Far too much expense for the taste.  Just okay.  Probably won't make this again.

AMAZING!!!!!! My husband had never even had brunswick stew until I made this, and now it's his new favorite meal.  I did change the recipe a little to make it more like the stew I had growing up. Instead of 3 cans of creamed corn I only did 2, and added a can of corn niblets, and also added a can of butter beans. With the meat I just did 2 1/2 lbs of chicken breast and a lb of ground pork.  REALLY great recipe! Thanks! :)

Fantastic! Loved this, my kids too. Used my slowcooker, and instead of chicken parts , cooked whole chicken breasts in with it, and later shreaded it and added again.

Pretty good, but - The traditional way to make Brunswick stew here in VA uses only chicken, potatoes (cubed), onions, tomatoes, tomato paste, white shoepeg corn, butterbeans (lima), salt, pepper, cayene pepper, hot sauce. Succculintly delicious.

I made the recipe exactly as directed and found the combination of ketchup and bbq sauce to be a bit too sweet.  I had to add quite a bit of salt and hot sauce to compensate.  While overall the recipe was great next time I will probably substitute plain tomato sauce for the ketchup and leave in the bbq sauce for a hint of sweetness.  I can say that this was all eaten!

Wow, I took a chance and won!! Sooo good. A very forgiving recipe at the same time. Add whatever meat and veggies you like! I added a can of drained chunk pineapples and some potatoes. Next time I will use sliced smoked sausage or kielbasa. Use Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce. It is far superior to any!!! I also used my homemade spiced ketchup which added extra flavor. My husband is originally from MS and he went nuts over it!!! So I didn't get a husband......he now wants to keep me forever :)

Fantastic cold-weather comfort food. I made some changes.  I boiled chicken quarters, then used approx. 2 cups of the broth as a base. I substituted a container of store-bought shredded pork in barbecue sauce instead of the ground meat, barbecue sauce and ketchup. Also added a little liquid smoke and vinegar to flavor. I added a can of lima beans and substituted one can each of whole and creamed corn for the 3 cans of creamed corn. Delish!

Everytime we go to a BBQ restaurant my boyfriend has to get Brunswick Stew. Well, I made this one and he loved it more than the BBQ places we have gone.

Look no further.  This recipe is out of this world.  My husband makes this and has to share the recipe with everyone who tries it.  It is amazingly delicious.  You don't want to miss out on this one.

I had never made Brunswick Stew, as we're from the North, but my husband goes to a local BBQ shacks and raves about theirs.  This recipe was great!  I modified it to our tasts by not adding as much creamed corn, used one can of regular, and added more green pepper and onion.  I used left over pork ribs and chicken drummies and I let them cook, then fished the bones out of the stew.  Also threw in left over chicken breast and italian sausage.

Awesome!  I omitted the ground beef and pork, and just used chicken and cooked pork chops.  Added in potatoes and regular frozen corn instead of cream style.  Turned out great!

This is a good recipe, but it needed potatoes in it(which i added) and a little bit more flavor. I added more corn, a can of crushed tomatoes, and 1.5 c bbq sauce, and also Old Bay seasoning. that gave it a great taste. But this is a great recipe. I just am so used to MY old family recipe. Todd(my hubby) ate two big bowls and my 3yr old enjoyed it. Great time in St. Thomas!!! Had fun! ANYONE WHO MAKES THIS RECIPE NEEDS A PAMPERED CHEF FOOD CHOPPER! BIG TIME SAVER!!!!!

I made this recipe a few weeks ago and we all loved it. I used the catchup and the BBQ sauce very sparingly as all of it would have been too strong and bold for us. (I added a little at a time and taste tested it until it was just right for us.)  I also put it in my crock pot and let it cook most of the day on low.  Mmmm, my house smelled good!
THanks for a great recipe!
 By the way, my husband had a bowl of Brunswick Stew at Smokey Bones the other night.  I thought this recipe was just as good, if not better. I think you really have to find the right BBQ sauce that you like to make this recipe really special.

3 stars for the version as is...I have a pot of it simmering right now and i'm a little disappointed with the texture. It's just a very  mushy thick texture and not chunky. It tastes great and I will definitely make it again but i'm already planning to cut back on the ground meat to 1lb of each pork and beef and adding a few diced potatoes. I will also replace 1 can of the creamed corn with one can of regular corn for more "chunk" and I will not shred the chicken as much as I did before I added it since it shreds more as it cooks. I think with these revisions it would be awesome as the flavor is definitely there already.

Researched the best barbecue sauce that would be less sweet more heat which was Stubby's. What I got was a mushy mess. Still too sweet, not very tasty and sort of bland.

I hate to read reviews where people make all sorts of adjustments and then leave their opinion.  I made this last weekend with an adjustment - I used beef and pork stew meat instead of ground - otherwise I followed exactly.  I cooked it in my 6 qt. crock pot and I'm glad the recipe made a large quantity with enough for leftovers because it is delicious.  I don't know if it is authentic or not but everyone here loved it.  Served initially in a bowl over a scoop of homemade mashed potatoes and then had leftovers with egg noodles.  Will definitely make again.  Perfect for a cold day.

I improvised, as always.  I used whole corn instead of creamed, & didn't have any pork.  I used celery salt instead of the celery (boiling celery for 3 hours makes it kind of gross).  I substituted Rotel, instead of the 3 cans of peeled tomatoes, & bell pepper.  I used marinara sauce instead of ketchup, Stubs original instead of the hickory sauce, & added some beef bouillon.  The BBQ sauce is an unusual ingredient, & I'd never put ketchup in a stew, not in Texas anyway.  All in all, this was a pretty good meal, if you have some ground beef & leftover chicken &/or pork.  The creamed corn would make it a bit thicker, you may also add some instant potatoes & extra salt as needed at the end, if you're running out of time & it's too watery.

Great Recipe! Always get compliments on how good it is. A few changes...sautee and brown ground meat in same large pot (less dishes.) 86 green pepper and celery. I use 2 cans creamed corn and 1 corn sweet corn.  FYI - tried to double BBQ and Ketchup last time I made it and it didn't turn out as good. Stick with portions...

Excellent! This used to be served at a restaurant I worked at. After it went out of business, my husband craved it. I could never find the recipe. Thank you so much for sharing it! My husband loves it just as much. I haven't made any changes when I make it. It's not necessary. Excellent as is.

This was great!  I made a few additions/changes: I used butter instead of oil, 3 stalks of celery, 3 cloves garlic, 1 cup BBQ sauce, 1 cup red wine, 1 can beef broth, a dash of Worcestershire sauce, and 3 (8oz) cans of Lima beans drained. Both my husband and friends raved on about how good this was. I even had a friend ask for the recipe. I served it with cornbread.

I have made this for YEARS... wanted to check some of the things needed to make it and discovered I have never reviewed it.... SOOOO have to review it.  

I am from Atlanta and let me assure you, this is EXACTLY what you find at the corner bbq stand (in Georgia, BBQ is a little different than in other areas, such as California), bbq comes dry and if you want to add sauce you do that later. ANYWAY, this is the best Brunswick stew!!

I use the chicken from Costco (I have also used that chicken in the frozen section that already has bbq sauce on it – turns out good too, just use less BBQ sauce) and leftover shredded pork  - THE SHREDDED MEATS make it… so it really needs the shredded texture. I also like some whole corn in addition to the creamed. 

EVERYTHING ELSE IS PERFECT… don’t add more veggies if you want southern style.

This is my go-to brunswick stew recipe. I have made it 5 times, for dinners at home and for pot-lucks at work. It always gets rave reviews and special requests. The recipe does make a lot, which never goes to waste. My modifications to this recipe started with my first trial of it because I wanted a crockpot-easy recipe. I start by turning on the crockpot and putting in the ketchup, bbq sauce, and tomatoes, letting it heat up on low while I saute the celery and onion. I brown the beef and sausage (Jimmy Dean 'HOT') separately and add them to the crockpot when they're finished. For the chicken (Ive used rotisserie chicken from walmart as well as ground chicken- even substituted ground turkey when no rotisserie chicken was available) there is some flexibility. I add all this to the crockpot, stirring occasionally. In time crunches, Ive gone ahead and added the cream corn and whole green pepper and cooked it until the pepper softens, then chopped and added back to the mix. I usually make this the night before I need it and refrigerate. In the morning, I'll turn it on high and its piping hot and delicious by lunchtime! This recipe makes a huge amount of stew but I have never had any leftovers. The girls at work literally scrape the bottom of the crockpot. Every kernel of corn is gone by the end of the day! I cannot praise this recipe enough! It is simple and delicious and a wonderful addition to my recipe box! I've gotten rave reviews from everyone I have ever made it for.

I tried this last night and it reminds me of the wonderful stew I get a several well known BBQ restaurants in Atlanta. The only changes I made: added 3 small potatoes cut in large dice, about 1 1/2 cup frozen lima beans, exchanged the green bell pepper for red (personal preference). Also, made this in the crock-pot (2hrs on high, then on low for 1 hr) - it was wonderful! I will definitely make this one again. Thanks so much for the recipe!!

OMG I thought I would make this and keep the rest in the freezer for future use, but no. It was way too much! I'm a tiny person, and although this says it serves 16 it really serves more like 20 (or even 25). I ended up sharing the rest of mine with a friend who has a family of 4. we all LOVED it! No changes had to be made.

My mom loved it and my Grandfather use to make the best stew.  He made it when the Carnival was in town and the Volunteer Fire department raised money by selling food.  So she has a memory of what it should be like.  Was a big hit with my club also.
Oh I am from Virginia the true home of Brunswick stew.   LOL

already have a husband, but decided to go ahead with this recipe anyway and try to please him :)  he overwhelmingly approved.  my dinner plans were cancelled midway through my saturday, so i had no time to thaw out any meat.  i halved this recipe and used only pork -also subbed b/s chicken for the whole chicken - and threw it all frozen into the crock pot on high.  i was nervous about how that would all turn out, but about 5 hours later, it was simmering nicely and everything was cooked through.  i removed the chicken and shredded it, and just used a wooden spoon to break up the ground pork.  the veggies were tender even though i didn'tsaute anything first.  hubby's only requests were that next time i decrease the onion and the bbq sauce - he felt they were a little overpowering. otherwise, he really enjoyed the taste of this stew.  thanks!!

This has become one of my go to recipes.  I like to cook the stew in the crockpot on low all day.  But that is just my preference. Leftovers freezes well.  If our adult children come home or unexpected, but always welcomed guest are around for supper,  all I do is go to the freezer and a wonderful meal is soon on the table.  Add a pone of cornbread and everyone is happy.

I made this for my family yesterday. While I enjoyed it, my wife said it had too much meat and that the creamed corn made it just a tad too sweet and that I should have added lima beans.
I do agree that it was a bit too sweet, but I enjoyed it.

Next time I plan on adding less ground beef, and maybe substitute the creamed corn with cans of yellow plain corn, and maybe adding lima beans.

Always a favorite in our house. Enough to make for dinner and freeze leftovers. I usually use 1 pound each of pork and beef, and time permitting, cook 1 raw chicken on the stove instead of slow cooker. Meat of chicken fall right off bones. I also only use 2 cans of cream of corn and will add lima beans to the mix!

Very very good stew.  Used leftover smoked turkey and boston butts from a party the night before.  I didn't use the ketchup because in previous preparations it was too sweet.  Beware,.it does make a LOT.  I used two cans creamed corn and two cans whole kernal corn.  I have a ring on my finger but no paper yet so lets see where this gets me!

I made this in the crock pot.  It was quite runny after a few hours so when I added the corn, I put the crock on high and took the lid off for the last hour.  This stew came out great but be warned, it makes a lot.  Almost overflowed my large crock.

I grew up in Mechanicsville, VA, where Brunswick stew was a staple meal, especially in fall and winter. This is a fantastic recipe, and very customize-able, as you can add and substitute different meats, spices, herbs, and vegetables, and still come out with an amazing result. I used venison meat  instead of beef, and hickory-smoked pulled pork. I added several vegetables, like carrots, green beans, and potatoes, and I never make anything in my kitchen without an array of spices in it. I added rosemary, bay leaves, onion and garlic powder, celery seed, red pepper, and paprika. I served it to my husband with Ritz crackers and finely-shredded cheeses (but ate mine plain, with a little hot sauce). It turned out fantastic! Easy to make and impossible not to love-- you should definitely add this one to the recipe box.

It was good.  I was expecting more of a beef stew but this was very different.  The cream style corn made the stew sweet.

This is really yummy brunswick stew.  I did not cook the bell pepper as directed but instead chopped it up first.  Also, I added 1 russet and 1 sweet potato chopped in small cubes in the last hour.

Five Stars For Sure!! I had Brunswick stew years ago while @ the beach. We were lucky enough to have the loan of a lovely waterfront home..Before we left the owner insisted that we try the frozen stew in freezer..It has taken me eight years to find the perfect recipe.  I did use frozen corn & lima beans (I'd put up) plus one pound of pulled pork Bar b Que!! Perfect!!

A very basic recipe.  Once I mixed the ingredients together I was quickly disappointed and had to improvise to get a more authentic stew.  I only used shredded chicken - and no other type of meat.  First the sauce: In a sauce pan, over low heat, melt 1/4 cup of butter then add: ketchup 1/4 cup French's Yellow Mustard 1/4 cup white vinegar  Blend until smooth, then add: 1/2 tablespoon chopped garlic 1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper oz. Worcestershire Sauce dashes of tabasco a few drops of lemon juice  Blend until smooth, then add: 1/4 cup dark brown sugar Stir constantly, increase heat to simmer - will add later  For the pot mix - I added potatoes, about 4-6 cups chicken broth, 1 can of regular corn (in addition to 1 can of the creamed corn) and any other vegetables I had on hand (peas and carrots)  I mixed everything together, and simmered for 5 hours before serving with french bread.

This is a really good Brunswick Stew.  I substituted a shredded pork tenderloin (I cooked it in the crockpot with liquid smoke, worstershire sauce and garlic cloves for about 5 hours on high) because there wasn't any ground pork available at the grocery store.  Other than that I stuck to the recipe and it turned out fantastic.  Will definately make this again.  Bonus: It freezes wonderfully for those quick lunches or dinners!

This is pretty good.  The yield sounded enormous to me, so I cut everything by a third, and that was plenty for me and my husband for more than two meals.  I used just the pork and left out the other meats, since that's what I had on hand.  The creamed corn seemed a little strange to me ... next time I'd use frozen.  I probably also didn't sautee the celery long enough.  It was still slightly crunchy in the finished stew, which was a little weird for Brunswick stew.  Anyway, the title of the recipe has some merit -- my husband liked this a lot more than I did.  I made some southern-style cornbread as a sidedish, and that was a nice touch.

Our whole family loves this stew. My husband requests it frequently, that's why I love that it makes such a large batch and freezes so well. One addition I made to this stew was some smoked sausage sliced. Otherwise it's great as is!!

I have always loved brunswick stew but never tried to make my own.  This recipe is just as I would have hoped it would turn out.  Perfect.  One of the things I changed was I omitted the ground beef.  I seasoned, cooked and pulled 3 boneless chicken breasts and added it to 1 pound of store bought pulled pork flavored with hickory bbq sauce.  I cooked it all on low for 4 hours in the slow cooker, then added half cream corn and half regular canned corn, and cooked on low another 2 hours.  I then removed the green pepper and discarded. Recipe turned out great!  Will make again.

I made this for my boyfriend who is a truck driver to take with him on the road. He absolutely loved this and asked if there was enough for him to eat it all week.
I made the following changes or additions based on others' reviews, since I tend to tweak every recipe to put my own spin on it. I used two tubs of bbq pulled pork instead of ground pork - the consistency was perfect and I did not need to add additional bbq sauce. I used stew meat instead of grnd beef and it gave the stew some chunkiness, whic was perfect. I used 2 cans of cream style corn and one can of whole kernel corn.
I added 6 boiled new potatoes, cut into bite-sized cubes, and 1 can of black beans - drained.
It made enough to last us two weeks and we were able to freeze some, too.
This is definitely a keeper.

Absolutely the best Brunswick I've ever had!  I made it a second time and used carolina bbq pork instead of just shredded pork to add some kick... but a little franks red hot will do the same.  I cut the recipe in half both times and still fed 8 people with two servings, no one could believe how filling it was.  All you need is cornbread for a side.

Wow!  I'd never even heard of Brunswick Stew, but have made this twice now with rave reviews.  I do use the cubed meats, as others suggested, for better texture, half creamed corn, half regular, and add the lima beans.  Several people who've had it like to add extra hot sauce, which I learned really kicks it up.  A great, different recipe that I'll be making often in the cold winter months.

Although this is good, there's just too much meat and not enough liquid.  I might try it with just the chicken next time.

This turned out super! I cooked it for a football party and it was a big hit! I incorporated a few of the suggestions: used 1 lb. each of pork and beef, used .90 lb. chicken breast (boneless & skinless), substituted one can of creamed corn with niblets, bought my tomatoes pre-diced, and added a bag of baby lima beans. I also cooked this in my crock pot and it was almost to the top! It was not as thick because of that - it was more like chili - but nobody cared. The leftovers were thick, though! I will make this again for sure! Yummy!

I'm a real Southern gal from Georgia and Brunswick stew is a staple.  My best tip for perfectly flavored B-stew is to add a bit of liquid smoke at the end. I'm so glad they finally make "clean" liquid smoke with only one or two ingredients (water, hickory smoke). Brunswick stew is so versatile.  You can use just about any meat you have on hand (ground or shredded, leftovers from roasts work perfectly.) You can sub creamed corn cans for niblets, fresh or frozen. You can throw in fresh or frozen veggies. Lima beans (or as we call them in the South, butterbeans) are a must! My husband likes his stew less sweet, so I only used 2 cans of creamed corn, cut the BBQ sauce in half, and used a less-sweet type of ketchup (Sir Kensington's brand or homemade). This is great for feeding big groups on a cold night; it's always a hit!

Good stuff! I used 2 cups of Maureen's Baked Beans (another recipe on this site) instead of the ketchup and barbecue sauce, and I have to say, it pushed this recipe over the top!

I had 3 pounds ground pork to use....  Tasty recipe.  Added chicken broth and a can of V8 because it was so thick.  Frozen lima beans a a pretty addition at the end!

GREAT way to use up that left over Thanksgiving turkey! We made this for the first time last year.  We used our left over turkey meat from Thanksgiving.  It was fabulous!  Hearty & warm, which is what is needed during the cold weather.  We also used the suggestions on the corn.  Definitely a must keep recipe!

I will eat just about anything, but did not care for this at all. This was my family's first introduction to Brunswick Stew.  Thought it would be perfect to take on our cabin hunting trip. Just too much BBQ sauce and too sweet for our taste.  =(

I really enjoyed this recipe, but altered it quite a bit, because had limited ingredients on hand.  I did not use chicken, but used more Boston Butt, added 1 can regular corn and 1 can creamed corn.  Added 2 large red potatoes. Reduce tomatoes to 2 cans and added 3 cups chicken stock. The BBQ sauce and ketchup are critical flavors.  My family loved it and will make repeatedly.

I have made this many times and it is excellent! Instead of "ground" pork, I use left over pork butt, shredded.  This is a true winner and better than any restaurant's brunswick stew!

I absolutely love this stew!  I use hot Italian sausage, cut out of the casings, for the pork; it gives it a little extra heat.  Do yourself a favor and give this a try!

This stew is really great, gave it 5 stars!  I only recently discovered I liked Brunswick Stew and thought I would try this recipe.  I used the whole chicken but substituted ground turkey for the pork/beef as I'm really not a fan of ground pork.  Stew was very hearty and flavorful, the bbq sauce really adds that spicy and smoky taste!  The recipe made a lot, and I'm hoping that some of it will freeze well for a quick meal on a tired day.  Thanks for the recipe!

WONDERFUL!  replaced the ground pork with a pound and a half of shredded country ribs, pan-seared, then baked at 350 for an hour (threw in the pan juices too).  also added about 1/4 cup of white vinegar for that georgia TWANG.  i'll make again!!!!

Good recipe. Been making brunswick stew for years and this is very similar to what I use. Easier to use a premade package of pulled pork, such as Lloyd's and omit the ground pork and BBQ sauce. Omitted the bell pepper & celery. Added a dash of liquid smoke and a can of regular corn.

This stew is really close to what we use to make in the barbeque joint I used to manage.I used 1lb. each of smoked pork,chicken and brisket all chopped pretty fine.After putting all other ingredients in a big pot, covered and cook on low until veggies were soft.This was very, very tasty.Thank you for the recipe

It was a wonderful stew. I had never heard of Brunswick stew before seeing this on line. I did add garlic to the stew and left out the pork because my husband is allergic to pork. And I also left out the onions also because of allergies. I also added more vegies to the stew. Then I read the review of a sountherner that said real Brunswick stew never has vegies added. So next time I may try it without adding the vegies. Thank you

3 cans of creamed corn made it too sweet. I had to add another 1/2 cup of bbq sauce, and some hot sauce to overcome it. would try 2 cans next time. Makes a huge batch of stew. Everyone I served it to commented how good it was. (They were southern so they should know). Will make again.

I used cubed meat (left-overs) and two cans of corn. LOVE this recipe! Enough to eat now and freeze for later. Make sure to pick a GOOD BBQ sauce. That's key, influencing the overall flavor.

I used canned diced tomatoes instead of whole because I though they would work better for the consistency of the stew. Other than that, I didn't change a thing. My friends enjoyed eating it with baked "Scoops" tortilla chips.

first time i made this i followed the recipe almost exactly. meaning i think i might have thrown in afew of my fave's like seasonings i mean, but other than that. and it was a great meal. the second time i changed the meat to beef stew meat  instead of hamburger and chunk pork meat instead of ground, per some reviews. but you know what they say "if it aint broke don't fix it". this was excellant as written. for sure a keeper. i will make this again no doubt. if your having doubts about this one i say you should try it you won't be disappointed. thanks much for this one.

First time I've ever made Brunswick stew and although it took a while to make, it was easy.  I omitted the ground beef and added lima beans.  My bbq sauce was a combo hickory and honey.  While it was good, I will probably make sure the bbq sauce isn't a sweet flavor.  This is excellent and I will definitely  make again.  (I made it for a crock pot luncheon at a senior citizen apartment complex and it all got gone!)

Out of this world. I did make a couple of changes. I used left over pork roast and left over chicken that I chopped. I also used stewed tomatoes and only 2 cans of the corn. I gave everything awhirl or two in the food processor, before cooking.

Update: made this for camp again and this time added carrots and potatoes, loved the addition.  Made this for camp and everybody (including myself) loved it.  Five of us finished a huge crock pot's worth.  I put 3 jumbo chicken breasts in with 1/2 a pork roast and 1/2 a beef roast.  Removed and shredded the chicken first, threw some sauce on it and covered with foil. Then I did the same with the pork.  Last came the beef. Right before before serving I added a bag of corn and 3/4 bag of baby lima beans.  Also added chunks of red potatoes.  Really satisfying, something a little out of the ordinary as well!

I have made this recipe several times with excellent results.  I have always made it for a crowd -- It doubles or triples well.  I have substituted leftover bbq (pulled or chopped pork) for the ground pork, and I have used ground venison instead of ground beef, both of which turn out great.  After Step 1, you can use a slow cooker instead of a stock pot.

I've been preparing this recipe for several years now and It's one of our wintertime favorites.  I have made a few alterations: -I swap the format of the chicken and pork, so: I use shredded pork instead of ground pork, and ground chicken instead of shredded chicken. -I use something like Lloyds shredded pork already in BBQ sauce and omit the BBQ sauce called for in the recipe. -I find 3 cans of creamed corn overwhelms both texture and flavor, so I use only 1 can creamed corn and 1 or 2 cans of whole kernel corn.  Enjoy

Not looking for a husband (I am one...lol).  I figured if this is what the ladies are cooking I should try it.  

Awesome!  Made it the second time today.  I also substitute rotel for the skinless tomatoes for more spice.

A keeper for sure.

Being a "yankee" living in the south, people were skeptical when I told them I was going to make Brunswick Stew. After hearing an hour long lecture on how to do it, I ignored them and printed this recipe. I made a big batch and brought it into work. They ate it right up! I skipped the ground beef and pork and just used shredded chicken and shredded beef (beef cubes, cooked then shredded). I skipped the hot sauce and added some extra corn. I was told it tasted good, like brunswick stew, so I am taking that as a compliment.

I have made this recipe each fall for the past 2 years.  Hubbie and daughter devour it and look forward to it every season.  Only changes made are using reduced sugar ketchup and sugarfree BBQ sauce.  It's beyond delicious!

Ok, now this is awesome!  I had this 3 meals a day until it was gone and it was gone all too quickly!  I am going to get another batch going right now.  My husband and I both loved this!  The changes I made were minimal.  The pork, I used pulled pork (already BBQ'd left over from a party) and I used whole kernal corn, as that is what I had on hand.  Very tasty!  I can't wait to dive into the next batch!  I made some frying pan cornbread to go with this.  Sensational!  Highly recommend to all!!

I first made this stew two years ago and I still get requests from friends and colleagues for me to make this throughout the year. I substitute ground turkey and turkey sausage instead of the beef and pork. It cuts back on the caloric and fat content. I used smoked turkey sausage and took the wrapping off of it and mashed the turkey sausage meat inside. I blended it in with the ground turkey and cooked it together. I also use mixed frozen vegetable rather than solely corn. THIS RECIPE TURNS OUT BEST IF YOU MAKE IT IN A SLOW COOKER. I allow it to simmer for 6 hours or overnight.

I made this the other day and it's wonderful! I used the slow cooker to prepare this instead of on the stovetop. I omitted the onions and oil and didn't precook the celery. Used store bought rotisserie chicken (3 lbs.) deboned. For the ground meats I used a half of a leftover pork roast, shredded. I halved the recipe and used 2 cans diced tomatoes, 1 can cream corn, and 1 can whole kernel corn. In addition to the 1/2 cup ketchup called for I increased the BBQ sauce and so used a full cup of chipotle Bulls-eye BBQ sauce, 1 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper. Cooked in the slow cooker on low for 4 hours then added the corn and cooked for 2 more hours on low, threw out the 1/2 green bell pepper I had used and Voila!!! Wonderfully delicious Brunswick stew. It had a hint of smoky spiciness b/c of the BBQ sauce I used and it was perfect. I'll be making this many times I'm sure :) Thanks for posting. BTW serve with cornbread on the side (or mixed in) and its great.

I have made this several times and my family can't get enough.  I add shredded barbecued chicken and omit extra barbecue sause.  I cook it in a crock pot all day, and serve it over mashed potatoes.  A real comfort food, large enough to feed a houseful and have leftovers.

This was great and tasted pretty darn close to what we used to get in GA!  Warning, it is extremely filling so i ended up freexing half of the recipe.  The good news is it still tasted great!  When looking for a good, hearty stew this is a keeper!

Loved it!  Used leftover pork loin from the crock pot, stew beef instead of ground, and cubed boneless chicken breast.  Added some Rotel tomatoes (instead of hot sauce) and used frozen corn and baby lima beans.  WONDERFUL STEW!

This is OUTSTANDING! Very much like the Brunswick Stew served at Smokey Bones.  I did use the prepared pulled pork in BBQ sauce, and it was even better. I also reduced the corn to one can of creamed, and it was just right for us.

Hubby and I try Brunswick stew whenever we see it in a restaurant.  This is the first time making it.  The flavor is AWESOME!!!!! I changed the recipe a tad, I used pulled pork in BBQ instead of ground pork and two can of whole kernel corn and 1 of creamed.  Next time I will do 2 creamed and 1 whole.  Plus I added a cup of water to thin it out a bit. Will make many more times.

THIS IS A WONDERFUL STEW. I DID SUBSTITUTE A FEW THINGS. I SUBSTITUTED A LARGE CARTIN OF BBQ SHREDDED PORK FOR THE BBQ SAUCE AND GROUND PORK. AND I ADDED A CAN OF LIMA BEANS. IT TURNED OUT VERY WELL. MY FAMILY LOVED IT. MY SON WHO IS 6FT AND 130 POUNDS CAN EAT THE WHOLE POT OF IT AND NEVER GAIN A POUND. WONDERFUL COMFORT FOOD ON A COLD NIGHT.

Oh my ggiiiooossshh!  YUH UH UHM!!  

We needed a winter pick-me-up and were dreaming of a brunswick stew we had at a friend's in TN.  Being too impatient to wait for our friend's recipe, I tried this one.  

Much easier than traditional recipes that want a million spices -- it's already in the BBQ sauce.  I used SMALL ROASTSof beef and pork instead of ground, though.  I've already made two batches in attempts to freeze some... they aren't frozen for more than 48 hours!

This is a keeper! My whole family loved it! I served it over rice for the kids and over cauliflower for a low carb meal. I also deleted the creamed corn and used a homemade BBQ sauce and ketchup for less sugar. I only had 2 cans of tomatoes and one of them was italian recipe so I used that and also about 2 c. tomato sauce. I will definitely make this again and again.

Wow.  This stew is awesome.  Having only had the stuff from the can, this was such a treat!  we ate it over rice, and we've got 2 freezer bags stowed away for a nice quick dinner.

They don’t call it “Find a Husband Brunswick Stew” for nothing! I have a husband already but I made a batch for his boss who told the hubs I was a keeper and it was the best he had ever had! I followed the recipe exactly- only added a frozen bag of vegetable soup veggies. It came out to perfection!

Was very good! My husband loves it! I will try a couple of changes, ketchup added too much sugar, I will try tomato sauce only, I will purée the canned tomatoes and juices to help thicken the stew. The BBQ sauce is vital to the flavor. I need to find the right one. This recipe is almost the exact same as the Brunswick Stew at our favorite BBQ restaurant in Macon, GA, Fresh Air!

I have made this recipe twice !!  1st time I made it, I only made 1/3 of the recipe (was very easy to reduce the amounts by 1/3.  turned out AWESOME !  Made it again just last week - made a double recipe - have a few containers in the freezer for quick meals - goes great with either rye bread or cheesy garlic bread.

LOL - the only thing I substituted was the ground beef.  I never buy ground beef because I live with a hunter so have a freezer full of ground moose meat  - used that instead of beef.  THANK YOU for a really great recipe !!

Excellent! I made this and carried to a church potluck.  They were fighting over the last spoonful. I get requests for it anytime we have a get together. One of the best things about Brunswick Stew is that it can be adjusted according to what you have in your pantry.  This is an excellent base recipe.

Delicious! I typically sub the ground meat for pork tenderloin and a beef chuck roast and grill & shred everything before putting it all together.

Every one I  serve this to loves it! I have made it more times than I can count and hadn't done a review.   This recipe is PERFECT as written and is very forgiving if you find you don't have  all the ingredients and just have to have Brunswick Stew.   I substitute shredded left over BBQ country ribs when making which I have saved in the freezer just for this recipe. I have substituted shredded turkey for the chicken before with great results. I have substituted V8 juice spicy ( one individual can ) for 1 can of tomatoes when I was sort which was also good.  One time I used a mild breakfast sausage browned as I had no ground beef. I chop the green pepper and cook with the stew. No need to remove it.  This is great for a large group as you can make it the day before which gives it even better flavor.  You can't go wrong with this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing.

This is the best Brunswick stew recipe I've tried.  Perfect for winter comfort food but I'll admit to eating it in spring, summer and fall, too.  My only alteration was removing the onion and celery due to personal preference.

First timer for Brunswick stew so I have no basis for comparison. Followed the recipe exactly and the results were very tasty. It was a little too sweet for our tastes due to the ketchup and bbq sauce, no doubt. Next time I’ll probably replace those with straight tomato sauce and liquid smoke respectively. The males of the household enjoyed it more than the females. The girls all felt there was too much meat

Made it with all ingredients plus Worcestershire sauce for good measure. Regular BBQ sauce works well. This is a very versatile recipe where you can add, leave out or substitute whatever you like. But do NOT leave out the ketchup which makes Brunswick stew...well...Brunswick stew! I tripled this recipe and put some away in the freezer for future YUMS!

bland.  I did some interesting things to the stew.  when I browned the ground beef, I drained it, and then poured water on it to rinse it.  When draining the pan, you loose up to  a great percentage of fat.  To rinse it means that you are down to 4 percent fat.  An easy way to get rid of unwanted calories that are hard on your heart.  BUT you have to replace the flavor that is lost through the taste of the fat.  So I used 3 cloves of garlic, sage about a teaspoon, some fresh basil leaves, garlic salt instead of plain salt and a small hot pepper chopped fine.   Sage is supposed to help a person keep their hair color according to old wives  tales.

I have been making this recipe to ball park brunswick stew for years now.  Maybe one day I will pay attention to how I've modified it and post it.  

One thing I 100% refuse to add is the green bell pepper.  It's gross and gives me flashbacks as a kid biting into a burger or navigating minefields of spaghetti that had green bell peppers in them.

There's a reason why Eddie Murphy included this emotionally scarring ingredient into his earlier stand-up specials.

All that said, if you're looking for a great and easy recipe to follow that'll bring you closer to home or remind you of your trip south, this is it.

If you like it spicy, I recommend sweet cornbread.  If you like it sweet, then I recommend dry skillet cornbread.

My wife and I made this in a crockpot for dinner tonight. This was better than The Brunswick Stew we had in Williamsburg Va   We used ground turkey instead of ground pork. We did not use the green pepper, creamed corn or hot sauce. We did add lima beans and some Old Bay seasoning. I actually overate. I had 2 large bowls. Phenomenal recipe

I made this in my crockpot using pork loin and boneless chicken thighs. I read the reviews here and edited for our tastes.

I used one can Rotel fire roasted tomatoes and one can diced tomatoes,  one can creamed corn and one can regular corn. I  omitted the ketchup and added a dash of liquid smoke.

Everyone raved and I have lots of leftovers!

Using 1 1/2 pounds of pulled pork and 2 pounds of ground beef worked for us. We used 2 cans of creamed corn and added a 28oz can of Bush's baked beans. This recipe was awesome!

I have made this about 30 times now. Exactly from the recipe  and with some tweaks. Every time it turns out AMAZING! I am continually asked by friends and relatives to make multiple batches in the fall and winter. Everyone asks for the recipe. The hickory BBQ sauce just nails it! I also use Jalepeno Heinz ketchup most of the time for a little more spice. I also found cooking it in a slow cooker with about 2 - 2 1/2 pounds of chicken breasts for about 6 hours on low, taking out the chicken and shredding it, adding the shredded chicken back to the slow cooker turns out the best! add the full green pepper right then and cook for 1 to 2 more hours on low. Thanks for the killer recipe!

I never had this before and was hesitant to try it on account of the ingredients. I didn't think they would click. My husband made it for us and reassured me that it is good. He is from the south and had made it often in the bbq restaurant he managed.  He said this recipe was the best the  he had ever made or tasted. And here it goes folks...tweaked it only slightly, he used only smoked pork butt and chicken. But it is delicious!!!! Can't wait to make it myself. If you have never had Brunswick stew and hesitant the same as I was, I urge you to give it a try. I don't think you will be disappointed at all, but very happily surprised.

I've made this very recipe countless times - It's one of my favs. Tonight, I did it all in the Instant Pot though, *including* cooking the whole yard bird first. While the cooked chicken cooled, I sautéed the celery & onions, then between browning the beef and pork I shredded the chicken. Rather than cooking on a stove top for 2 hours, I did it on high pressure for half an hour, added the corn, high pressure again for 15 minutes. Shazaam!

I followed the directions.  The only thing I did different was  used pork pieces. Because my grocery store ran out of ground pork. My family loved the stew. My only complaint  is it took forever to make.

Tasty, fun and easy to make! The ground meats were a very nice change from left over BBQ, which is what I would normally use to make this dish. Quite the crowd pleaser. I did add 1/2 a can of drained Lima Beans but other than that single addition, I followed the recipe exactly as printed. Super fast, affordable dish that we enjoyed on a chilly night. I will make this one again but next time I may use Rotel tomatoes rather than whole tomatoes and kick it up a notch... I will also replace 2 of the creamed corn with whole corn since we love the whole kernel pop over the cream.

Excellent recipe.  I made mine the way Brunswick stew was originally intended - with leftover BBQ (I made brisket last weekend and had about 1.5 lbs left.  I did add chicken and ground pork, but the brisket was the base.  My only complaint is that it turns out a little too sweet, which I can only assume is from the BBQ sauce (I used homemade, which wasn't very sweet) and ketchup in the recipe.

I didn't have much confidence in this recipe, yet had the ingredients and needed to feed a hungry family and make something for book club. My oldest son was the first try this, spooned a large portion over a square of cornbread and quickly announced I could make this again. This child rarely comments on dinner. Everyone at book club enjoyed it as well. Will definitely make again.

I do have to admit that I didn't follow the recipe exactly due using what I already had. I used chicken breasts instead of cooked chicken and leftover pulled pork for the pork. Omitted additional bbq sauce and substituted tomato sauce for ketchup and diced tomatoes for whole. Also, added potatoes and white beans.

I liked it but it wasn't Brunswick stew.  It was too sweet and the distinctive taste was missing. My family felt the same way. I'm going to keep looking for an authentic Brunswick stew recipe. Oh and good luck finding a husband with this one.

I made this receipt as-is with one exception: I used frozen whole kernel corn instead of creamed corn.  I LOVE the smokiness from the hickory bbq sauce, and the different textures from the shredded meat and ground meats.

I have served this for guests and it was a major hit. I also make up batches and freeze for lunch/dinner in the fall & winter. It's very filling so you don't need to eat a lot even if you're a big guy like me. One of the best recipes I've used from this site.

Will make it again. Instead of 3 cups of cream corn I used two and added 1 can of Lima beans after. I also used all lean meat of beef and pork. Can't even taste the difference and it's healthier.

I was made Brunswick stew when I moved to West GA. It is a GA dish and can have variations depending on how close you are to the Coast and or how far North or South you are.  This is the closest to the recipe I was introduced to.  I have found the restaurants on the Coast make it a bit too tourist friendly.  We make ours in a crock pot and use a bottle of "hot" ketchup instead of hot sauce. the cream corn makes this dish! do not add kernels, creamed! We also use shredded, pulled pork and no bell pepper.

If someone is rating this as a low score, they're not making it right. This is so dumbed down its impossible to screw up. I grilled my chicken and used leftover smoked butt from earlier.  Browned some ground beef and was done. A few hours later it was the talk of the town. I feel bad for the ones that aren't able to enjoy this recipe as designed.

I have made this stew every NFC/AFC playoff weekend for years. My whole family, especially my daughter, looks forward to it. Usually I have to cut the recipe in half at least because so much is made.

I halved this and followed the suggestions from the reviewer who used only boneless skinless chicken as the meat and added rotel. Mine cooked in about 6 hours on low. I am from the south and have been trying to recreate the VFD stew in a "normal" sized portion I could make at home. This turned out pretty good. As I was eating it, I added a generous amount of hot sauce, salt, and pepper, and some crackers to my bowl, and then it was great!

I've made this recipe at least 5 times now, and it's so versatile. If this is your first time just follow it. But after that you can substitute all kinds of stuff! For example, rather than getting the meat quantities and proportions right just start with 6-lb frozen meat of your choice. I use dark meat chicken (often the quarters with thighs are only $0.75/lb) and a pork loin, which I pre-cook in the crock pot (throw in the onions, celery and bell peppers too to cut out the cooking them), then I de-bone and de-skin and shred the meat up and dump in the rest of the stuff. Also you can sub pretty much any veggies you like for the creamed corn, I often use fresh or frozen stuff. Dump in your leftovers (anything goes... Mac'n cheese, hash browns, fried okra)!

Great as is and everyone loved it even the children!!!! I changed a couple of things in subsequent batches to make it more like what I grew up with.  I used two cans corn kernels and two cans of lima beans. You can use the diced tomatoes with celery and onions. For the pork, I use NC Lexington style BBQ pork and I use leftover BBQ chicken. It is always good to the last drop.

Very good.  We enjoyed it along with corn bread.  I'll make this again.  I did just as recipe suggested--well, 95% as suggested.
 I used 2 cans corn and 1 can of creamed corn,  and shredded pork shoulder and shredded chicken to go along with the ground beef.  
  This is a nice, solid recipe.  Next time, I'll try the suggestion of adding  lima beans and maybe a sweet potato for added nutrition.

I have made this several times, and everyone that has tried it loved it. I cheat severely so rating this recipe may not be fair, but it does cut down on the prep time. I use a 1 lb. tub of hickory smoked BBQ pulled pork, 1 lb. tub of hickory smoked BBQ beef from the precooked entrée section of the grocery and a rotisserie chicken from the deli department. From there I follow the recipe except I leave out the BBQ sauce since the meats already have sauce added. Super quick and super yummy!

This is one of my favorites! I don't use chicken, instead I use shredded pork. Sometimes I use ground beef, other times I use stew meat. No need for ground pork with the shredded pork. Always add a spoonful of sourcream on top each bowl when serving :-)

It was good and even better the next day, I had to add to this about 4 cups of chicken broth, garlic, bay leaves and Worcestershire sauce. Hot sauce is not optional!  Overall it was good but needed tweaking.

Today I found this recipe while wondering what to do with pork hamburger.
Followed most of the ingreds. with a few twists and my family loved it. As I didn't have certain ingredients I used 2 cans of diced tomatoe, 1 can of niblet corn and made my own creamed corn equal to 2 cans.  Also I added 1 drained can of white kidney bean.  Made a light roux to thicken it up and served it for dinner.  Very happy with the results.

Transferred to the crock pot for a couple of hours. Too sweet for our taste.  Maybe less creamed corn or just corn would suit our taste.

Way, way too sweet. Over powering taste of bbq sauce. Im hoping adding vinegar will tone down the sickenly sweet bbq flavor away. Next time I attemp making Brunswick stew there will not be any ketchup or bbq sauce in it. I was shocked those two ingredients were in the recipe. All the brunswick stew Ive eaten have never had that bbq sweetness.

Never had Brunswick stew, this was really good! Had to blend the tomatoes a bit, as my son won't eat anything with a hint of chunky tomato, used pork sausage instead of ground pork and hamburger, otherwise followed the recipe. Definitely will make again.

I am making this now, and it already tastes so good. The only thing I did different was I used 3/4 pounds of ground beef and 3/4 pounds of shredded beef roast (left overs from last night). My house smells so good right now. Thank you for this recipe, Brunswick stew is one of my husband's favorites.

Absolutely delicious. I actually cut the green pepper up and had it cook in the crock pot all day. Turned out perfect. Makes A LOT! And it was just my husband and I. So I froze half of it for later. I will make this again but try with pulled pork instead.

I'm a Minnesota girl and had never tried anything like this. I've made it several times this last year and everyone has loved it. Just like any soup or stew it can be a little different every time you make it. I like to add a couple cans of black-eyed peas, or whatever kind of beans I have in the cupboard. Yes, it does have a sweeter taste than stews I was used to making but I think that's what makes it different. Just like all stews, it's better the second day! Thanks for the great recipe. I've added it to my kitchen line up.

OMG this is awesome!! Only changes I made were using 3 lbs of shredded chicken breast, & 1 cup of bbq sauce. My whole family loved this. It made so much we froze the leftovers. It is better the 2nd day. Oh so good!!! Freezes very well, but won't last long!

I read the reviews and made a few changes. I used two 10 ounce cans of Rotel  Original Tomatoes with chilies, one can of whole kernel corn and two cans of creamstyle corn. I cubed the pork, beef and chicken and browned them with the celery and onion. Everything else stayed the same. This is a fantastic dish and has been saved in my personal recipe file. Thanks.

I accidentally added too much hot sauce, so I had to add more chicken broth, ketchup, and a lot more barbecue sauce to compensate.  Everyone loved it!!!!!!!!

Great stuff! I goofed a bit at the store and wound up using hot Italian sausage and ground turkey but it was still fantastic. My wife has been sick and this was the first meal that has tasted good to her so I think it's a staple now.

I love this recipe!! I have made it numerous times, and it is one of the hubs's favorites!! I use a sage sausage instead of pork, and I don't use the celery or green pepper because he doesn't like that. I pref the thickness of this stew over the watery versions, and I like the chunks of meat as opposed to it looking like its gone through a food processor.

I'm in search of an eastern Carolina Brunswick stew.  This wasn't exactly what I was going for, but it is very tasty and the wife and kids enjoyed it to.  Will def. keep in the recipe book.

I have never had Brunswick stew so I don't have anything to compare it too. I cooked as directed except scaled it down to 6 servings. I thought it was a little too sweet with the cream corn. We ate it (my husband ate two bowls!) but I don't think I will be making it again. Really glad I scaled the recipe down or I would have had too much food!

Made this yesterday for husband.  He loved it but I'm spolied on local smokehouse recipe.  Bought cooked pork loin at grocery store and cooked london broil for beef.  Time consuming chopping up meat but well worth because husband loved it.  Thank you for recipe.  We will def makes this again.

THIS RECIPE IS THE BEST!!!  I make it about once a year, except I use venison instead of beef (my husband is a hunter--we usually take a roast and chop it into bite-sized peices), turkey kielbasa instead of pork, and I switch out 1 or 2 of the cream style corn for regular canned corn.  I also don't like celery so I leave that out.  All over AWESOME!

this was very good and very easy to make, just long time wise.  My husband really liked it.  Next time though, I think I will take the green pepper out before adding the creamed corn.  My husband loved it

This was sooo deelish!  I changed it only slightly - I used 1lb grnd beef, 1 lb grnd pork, 1.5 cans SPAM (yes, oh yes), and of course the chicken.  I also used 2 cans of creamed corn and one can of reglar since that's what I had in.  It came out so delish - especially a ltitle bit on a bed of mashed potatoes - my girls and I had it like that.   My husband loved it so much, he wanted leftovers the next two nights as well!

Nice hearty stew.  I halved it and it filled up my cast iron dutch oven.  I did not use ground meat.  Cubed up some beef and boneless pork. Nor did I use pre-cooked chicken.  Instead I cubed up some chicken tenderloins and browned this along with the other meat.  I happened to have a Yukon gold potato and diced that and threw it in for the last hour.  Added a bay leaf.  I simmered about an hour longer than called for, the last hour uncovered.  Served with drop biscuits also from this site.

Does anyone know what the serving size for this recipe is?  The nutritional info says "1/16 of recipe", but I'm not going to divide it up into 16 parts -- I've already frozen about half of it!  I'm trying to calculate the Weight Watchers points for it. Thank you for any help!!!

Excellent consistency, used lima beans and added a can of whole corn as well. I cooked all my meat in a slow cooker (after braising beef) with salt, pepper, and old bay. The meat mix alone was incredible (I used no ground meat, but beef stew cubes, chicken breast, and pork tend.) I still cooked it for three house, with the whole bell pepper...didn't really understand the purpose for that. It was so good though.

I am single and made about 2 quarts for myself. I used chicken breast, pork roast and ground beef. If I have ever had better than this I don't remember it. This is so easy and super tasty! I plan to make a big pot tomorrow for a pot luck dinner. This is what I would call a man's stew. Lots of flavor and lots of meat. Thanks for posting this one!

My husband and brother raved about this.  My brother ate THREE bowls of it the first time he tasted it!  I think this is one of the VERY BEST recipes I've found on this site.      I think simmering the stew with the whole green pepper in it really added a lot of flavor.  YUM!  YUM!  YUM!    I cooked my chicken the day before in the oven at 350 degrees then stored in the refrigerator.  I used a whole cut up chicken in a covered dish then shredded it to use the next day.  Cut down on cooking time a little bit.    Thanks for this recipe!  We're definitely going to make this again.

OMG!!! What a great tasting stew! I omitted the celery and used celery seeds instead, because we are not big celery fans, but the flavor is to die for!!! It made enough for me to freeze for another meal! Great recipe!

I have made this recipe 4-5 times, once for a crowd of 30 people, and everyone always gives it rave reviews.  The only change I make is with the pork -- instead of using *ground* pork, I cooked a couple of pork tenderloins on the grill, shredded them, and added them to the stew instead of ground pork.    This is the BEST recipe for Brunswick stew that I've ever found (and I've tried a lot of them)....delicious!!!

My husband LOVES Brunswick stew, so I made this with some left over bbq pork and chicken we had. It really is a "meaty", rib-sticking stew. I could only eat a little before I felt like I swallowed a bowling ball. My husband loved it, so 5 Stars!

This was a great meal for a cold winter night, or nights...This recipe makes alot and plenty to freeze for later. Very kids friendly as well. My 4 boys loved it. I didn't use ground pork because I thought the ground beef was plenty, instead I diced some leftover Canadian Bacon and tossed in toward the end along with the cream style corn. I also added in Cannelli beans because my family likes beans. I think butter beans would of been great in this as well. I served this stew with crusty french baguette and a salad.

For my personal tastes, this was okay but the barbecue sauce was too overpowering in the stew.  If I make it again, I will either omit it altogether or will definitely not use as much as the original recipe calls for.

After first taste I was going to rate this recipe 3/3.5 stars, but then it was even better the next day(so I bumped it up to 4 stars).  I did add 1C Lima beans and 1 can regular corn.

This recipe is wonderful!  My husband LOVES it, and looks forward to it every time I make it! A couple things we tried different that also worked well was to grill some sirloin steak and cut it up instead of hamburger, and we had some left over roasted chicken quarters that we used as well.  Delicious!!!

Very good recipe! I made some changes: instead of ground pork and BBQ sauce - I used a container of already flavored BBQ pulled pork. I also used a rotisserie chicken, minus the skin instead of a regular chicken. One large can of crushed tomatoes instead of the 3 cans of whole tomatoes as I don't care for their texture in soups. The last change I made  was 2 cans of creamed corn and 1 can of regular corn. I also had to add some water (we are a large family) and just thickened it at the end with a some cornstarch diluted in cold water. My family loved it!

Wow! This is an amazing stew! I used 4 cans diced tomatoes, 1 can tomato sauce, shredded chicken and pork (no beef) and replaced the hot sauce with a small can of jalapeno salsa and the creamed corn with regular. It's 9 degrees out and when my husband gets home I have a feeling he's going to declare this one a definite keeper! By the way Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory Brown Sugar BBQ sauce is perfect for this as another reviewer had mentioned.

Hey Now.  Went to Harolds in ATL king of bbq.  Of course there is nothing similar, but this is pretty close.  Looking forward to having it during the Falcons playoff game.  We also only used 2 cans of creamed corn.

I make this several times a year, it takes a while to cook but is well worth the time. I grill a small pork roast rather than using ground pork- the crispy bits in the stew make all the difference & I love the sweetness the bbq sauce gives the stew. Yum, yum, YUM!! Wonderful recipe.

I've made this recipe three times already. It is so hearty and delicious. 
I only use chicken breast in my recipe though. I also add diced tomatoes, simply because I love tomatoes.

This was awesome!  I already have a husband, and if i continue to cook like this, I will definetly keep him! :)  This was a great recipe.  I made it pretty much as the recipe stated, I just didn't have a green pepper.  Next time I will try it with the green pepper.  
This was delicious!

This recipe was EXCELLENT and although I'm already married - he will definitely stay forever! My husband could not stop raving over this stew.  It was thick n  hearty, great tasting - just plain good.
I made a few modifications - I didn't use the pork, I used same type of beef you would use in beef stew (which I shredded after it was done) and whole kernel corn instead of creamed style corn.  What a hit - this recipe is definitely a keeper!

I've made this 3-4 times now and have come up with....add large cubed potatoes, use frozen chicken breast that is cut up into bite size pieces, can also use meatballs!, use any veggies you want. Just keep the sauce the same. It's the sauce that makes this stew so yummy. Love it.

This is more of a question than anything. I love this recipe and I was wondering if anyone has tried adding diced fresh potatoes(not canned), to the recipe and if so how it came out, and whether or not it changed the cook time? I think it would be a great addition to this stew. Please let me know :).

Awesome recipe! When I looked at the ingredients I thought...I'm not sure about this, but something made me try it. I made it for a group and it was devoured in no time! Everyone is asking for the recipe. I did add two things at the end: 1/4 tsp of garlic powder (next time I will add to the onions and celery) and a few dashes of liquid smoke. Deee--lish!

I have been using this recipe for a few years now, but I am just now getting around to reviewing it.  It is wonderful and easy.  My family and friends love it, and have even made it for a stew at church.  Everyone loved it and there was nothing left.  The only changes I have made is that I using Lexington Style (Eastern NC Style) BBQ instead of plain ground pork.  I also use Sonny's Sweet BBQ sauce.  Other than that, I follow it to the letter.  Great recipe!

Very good.  My husband loved this recipe and both my daughters ate it, even my picky young one.  I scaled the recipe down to 11 servings and made it exactly as written except I used half cream corn and half regular.  Also, I chopped the green pepper up and added with the tomatoes and other ingredients.

This is a great recipe for stew. Wonderful flavor!!!! I did add too much BBQ sauce so next time I will follow the recipe amount. Didnt add hot sauce seeing not a hot fan. Definately better when it sits overnight!! I served with cornbread.

Took it to a tailgate party. There wasn't a drop left. We put a few extras in but essentially kept the core recipe the same. Yum!

We love this recipe!  I add extra veggies to it, like peas, carrots, and small-diced potatoes.  Also, this is great in the crock pot too!

This was easy enough to make but tasted just average. I think I should've used the barbecue sauce which I'd omitted based off several reviews I read. Good with fresh, hot buttered cornbread and a glass of cold milk. This makes alot, I froze almost a half gallon of it.

I have a husband who hates stew but he LOVES this!  I added canned potatoes I had on hand and it added bulk.  I had a lot left (forgot to scale) and it freezes well!

This recipe is a keeper!  It's also definitely a "husband keeper"!     Hubby loved it!  (As well as my seven year old son.)  We're "Yankees" and have never heard of Brunswick stew.  I'm glad we tried this one. The only change I made was to the meat.  I used leftover roast and chicken in place of the ground beef and pork and cooked it in the crockpot. I also used one can each of creamed corn and whole kernel corn as other reviewers suggested.  Added frozen lima beans, too.  Great recipe to be creative with and still have it turn out great!

I gave this a four because there is really nothing wrong with it. Ithad a good flavor. I am just not much of a meat eater and this was PACKED with meat so I felt like I just couldn't eat more than a few bites. I would rather have a nice thick vegetable stew with 6 or 7 oz of meat. Sorry I won't make this again but Im sure meat eaters will love it.

Wow, this is absolutely different and so very good! I followed the ingredients with only a slight variation from the original recipe. I used half a cup of tomato catsup and added a half cup of banana catsup because I didn't have enough of the tomato. I also followed the others and used whole kernels in place of cream style for the third can of corn, which made for added texture. What can I say, the sweet and tangy flavours all melded together to turn out a delightful, hearty stew which had everyone going for seconds! Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Fantastic. As others mentioned, I used some shredded pork in BBQ sauce instead of ground pork or a separate bottle of sauce.  This soup is amazing.

Okay. So I already have a husband, but the name and the ingredients were intriguing.  My brother lived and worked for Brunswick Country in Virginia, so I have the "orginal" recipe, however I thought I would give this a whirl.  Well, my husband loved it!  It should be called "keep a husband" Brunswick Stew! The sweet flavor had to grow on me, but the amount of meat in the dish was tremendous.  It is a definite keeper.  Thanks!

Good stuff! I brought it to a New Year's day party and it was a hit. Keep in mind that I live in the south, so it must be good. Only thing I did differently was I added a package of frozen lima beans with the creamed corn.

Well, I already have a hubby, but made this anyway and my hubby LOVED it! He's trying to convince me to make it again so he can take it to his buddies at work (I know a recipe is a "keeper" if he wants to do that!). I didn't use the cream corn as I'm on a low carb diet, but we had plenty leftover for dinner the next night, so I added the cream corn to it to make a little more, and it's delicious both ways! Yum!

I'm giving this a 4 because my husband rated it a 5 and I rated it a 3.  I just found it too sweet with the BBQ sauce, and I didn't really like the texture.  It wasn't horrible, but I found that after a few bites, it started getting on my nerves.  I don't think I'll make it again, but don't tell my husband that!

I loved it, my family loved it, and it was just as good when we heated it up for leftovers.  However, it hasn't gotten me a husband yet!

AMAZING!  My husband loved it so much that he said he would marry me all over again if I made this for him again!
