A simple and flavorful way to make fish, which I eat a lot of. I used tilapia instead of swai.  Make sure you season the fish well - garlic powder would be a nice addition here. And I'd also suggest seasoning the tomatoes. The fish was even tasty as leftovers for lunch! I baked the fish for 15 mins, then let it rest for 3-4 mins. This makes plenty of tomato topping, so you could even get away with using 3 or 4 pieces of fish. Thank you happycook for the tasty recipe!

My New Fave!
I seasoned the swai with pepper corns (from pepper mill) and used quality celery salt. Also used Acme brand minced tomatoes with celery, onion and bell pepper (14.5 oz) and added some manzanilla olives as well.  Followed the suggestion to bake for 15 minutes and let stand for a few and it came out great! Really made what can be a bland fish tasty!

This was really good. I laid a bed of fresh spinach on the bottom of my dish then put the fish and such. I also  topped with shredded parmesean cheese the last 5 minutes of cooking. The family loved it!!  Thank you for sharing.

As another reviewer suggested, I also  put a layer of fresh spinach down before adding the swai, a real great meal. I'll try this with tilapia next.

Loved it. It was delicious. The only change I made was that I cooked the swai fish first in the oven on a perforated roasting pan to drain all the liquid from the fish (from frozen). Cooked 30 minutes, drain, and then added the tomato mix and cooked anther 10.  Top with fresh chopped mint or basil. I will be making this again!

This was a good recipe.  I wish it had a little kick somehow though.  I did use the petite diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano.  I also tried adding Parmesan for the last 5 minutes in the oven.  I will make this again, I’m thinking about slicing some peperoncinis really thin to add to the top and see if that adds the little kick I’m craving.

Surprisingly delicious...with such simple ingredients, I didn't know what to expect, but it was so good - I used orange roughy but followed the recipe.

I have been looking for years for a fish dish that doesn't taste or smell like fish. I found it with this recipe! No one in the house believed that I was cooking fish. It's quick and easy to make. I omitted the salt and pepper, the canned tomatoes provide enough of that. I used scallions because we like them best and chopped garlic. 
Yummy!

My filets were 6 - 7 oz and were still nearly raw after 25 minutes at 400.  (They were frozen when they went in.)

Dumped it all into the electric skillet and dinner was done in no time.  Delish.

Veggies:  used up the last of the cherry tomatoes, onion, calabasa squash,  and sliced baby bella mushrooms.  Yum.  Will do this often.  Thanks for the great idea.

This is an easy and fast recipe. I added kale, Kalamata olives and capers to the tomato and onion mixture and it was great.
