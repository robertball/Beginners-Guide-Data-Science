Delicious.  I used the spice mixture as a dry rub and let the pork sit overnight to more fully enhance the flavor.  Grilled the pork on the barbeque using indirect heat until the desired temperature and then glazed it with the pepper jelly until it coated the meat.  As another reviewer noted, this can be quite spicy, so cut back on the seasonings if you need to.  Served with mashed cauliflower and candied carrots for a quick easy weeknight meal.  Thank you Walshmartin for a nice change of pace.

Made this last night for dinner. Changed up the seasonings and used a Bourbon Bacon Jam that I had previously made. I added potatoes and carrots to pan and everything was delicious!  I'm rating this more for the cooking technique. Was skeptical about the high temp but the roast turned out perfectly!!!

I was looking for a last-minute, easy, pork tenderloin recipe that clearly had some spice to it -- and this definitely fit the bill.  I made this for a family holiday gathering, and it was quick, simple and well-received. The rub was great and the red pepper jelly was really what drew me to the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!  Will definitely make it again.

I'm not much of a cook but I made this and it turned out great!  Someone gave me a jar of pepper jelly so I searched for what I could do with it.  Found this recipe and made it.  I rubbed the spices into it (I didn't have cumin so I used ground ginger) and cooked it according to the recipe.  Added the jelly and cooked it another 10 minutes.  Everyone was super impressed and I've added it to my short list of things I know I can cook well.

I was out of chili powder so I subbed in smoked paprika and also cut back on the black pepper as one member of our family doesn't like it. The rub was delicious and I'd use it again even without the sauce. The sauce itself was sooooooo tasty although I wish I'd gotten a thicker coating on the pork. Really pleased with this recipe.

Should have used a tenderloin instead of the pork roast that I had.  Good flavor but a little dry.  Will try again with the right meat.

Loved this - I have lots of pepper jelly (my hot pepper plants were prolific this year) and this recipe was perfect!  Doubled the recipe - used the leftovers for pork tacos.  Thanks for the recipe!

Didn't really taste the jelly - thought it would add a crust or some sweetness but it didn't. Pork was tender and well flavored though.

Fantastic!  Didn't take the whole 30 minutes.  Be sure to use a meat thermometer to be sure your pork is moist.  Very good with Roasted Vegetables.

Very flavorful, tender, cooked them by the recipe. Next time I may try changing something but don't  really see a reason to. Everyone enjoyed them.

I halved this using one tenderloin. It was a nice blend of a little spicy and a little sweet. Good and easy recipe with spot-on cooking times.

This an excellent recipe. The flavor is outstanding. The chili powder we use is a mild heat. We have never used a tenderloin, instead we use loin chops with and without a bone.  We also grilled it outside. We set the grill to high heat and waited to get up to temp. We seared the meat for about 5 minutes on each side and then lowered the temp to med and cooked it until it reached almost 145. We put 1/3 of the jelly on at the beginning , 1/3 after searing both sides and 1/3 later. It does cook quickly. Keep an eye on the temp. Very important.

This is a great recipe!   I often change up the spices, the jellies, and/or will use different chopped peppers.   One of my son's favorites.   It's great with a mango or orange chutney.   Thanks for a wonderful basic stand by recipe.

I made this recipe last night and modified the rub based on our preference for extra spicy with a hint of sweet: 4 tablespoons of chili powder, 2-3 tablespoons of brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of dry mustard (all other ingredients remained the same).  In addition to the hot pepper jelly glaze, I scraped the pan drippings and added that to the final "presentation glaze". I served it with spinach soufflé and steamed cauliflower (tossed with grated locatelli cheese and hot sauce). Will definitely make again - easy enough to make for a large gathering.

I used this recipe without modification on two pork tenderloins and it was way too spicy. I would cut the spice rub recipe in half next time.

Made this exactly as the recipe stated except modified quantities on ingredients for a 1.5 lb tenderloin (used same cooking time, though!)  This was excellent, tender and the sweet, slightly  spicy taste was GREAT!

Very yummy!  I also used my mom's homemade pepper jelly.  It liquified just fine.  Next time, I might try to grill it, then broil with the sauce on top!

I used homemade jalapeño jelly. It was spivey but delicious. I took out at about 140 degrees, coated with sauce, covered and let sit. My husband loved it
