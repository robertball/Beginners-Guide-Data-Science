Great recipe.  I sauted 1 green pepper (instead of the celery) and 1 bag fresh white mushrooms.  Aslo added some red pepper flakes for a little extra kick.  Served over spaghetti. Very good!

I added a little more minced garlic and a cup or so of chopped baby bella mushrooms and a teaspoon each of basil and oregano. FAH-REAKING AMAZING. One of the best things I've eaten in a long time. I wonder if I could use a cheap cut of meat (like a combo of sausage and stew meat?) and have it come out tender and awesome, even though I cheaped out. I bet I could. NOTE: I apparently did not read the recipe all the way through and I made this on the stovetop. I browned my meat, then the vegetables, combined them and added the rest of the ingredients excluding the cream. I cooked this, covered and vented, for about an hour and a half, then added the cream. Even though I did not follow the recipe exact (I was far too distracted and busy for that today, to be honest), this still turned out spectacularly. Even my kids slurped it up! I'm SO making this again. And again. ;)

This was so yummy and i made it for a friend who apologized in advanced for her 5 year old son who doesn't eat anything.  He ended up having seconds and she was so surprised!!

My first attempt with the slow cooker and it was so delicious and easy! I did half the sausage and added more veggies like carrots and mushrooms and served it over spaghetti. So yummy!

This recipe is very good.  I made it on the stove since I did not have enough time to cook it all day in a crock pot.  It was still very tasty and my kids really like it too.  I did add garlic salt.  I might add a few red pepper flakes next time.  We really liked this one.

My husband and I love this recipe!  I do agree that I add oregano and basil to it, but that's just personal choice.  I also chop my tomatoes fresh.  I do cook it on the stove and not a crock pot, but it still comes out amazing every time!

This recipe is simply brilliant on a number of levels.  I made it exactly as written...questioned why it needed to slow cook since everything WAS cooked before it went into the slow cooker for 5 hours...the taste difference from the start to the finish was incredible...mellowed out considerably.  But when you add the cream at the end...oh my.  I could really get hooked on this recipe...going to double the batch next time so we have plenty to freeze!

This is so delicious.  Both my kids ate it up!  I didn't add all the cream, maybe a little over half to save calories.  I also used mild and sweet sausage.

If I had three thumbs, this one would get a three thumbs up.  Best pasta sauce I've ever had - EVER!!! Definitely not low-cal, but, hey, live it up.  Second time I made it, I added a 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes to give it a bit more oomph.

Oh man.  This recipe is awesome.  I did my best to make it EXACTLY as stated, but we don't have red wine, so I used a bit of water for that part.  I let this sit in the crock pot all day and it was AMAZING.  I only made it last week and I want to have it again.  I'm not sure what about it was so special - I'm guessing the sausage as I've never used it in a pasta sauce.  Just mouth watering.
Edit:  Just realized I lied on accident, I used 2% milk rather than heavy cream and it was still amazing.

Turned out great! Only thing I changed was adding a small can of tomato paste halfway through because I thought it was a bit thin but not sure if that was even necessary.

I substituted two pounds of Italian-style ground turkey for the sausage and fat-free half-and-half for the cream.  It was so good and full of flavor that we didn't miss the full-fat ingredients at all.  It was a hit all around.  Can't wait for leftovers tonight!

Absolutely awesome. I did leave out the celery. I just didn't think it went with the recipe. Served it with penne pasta and garlic bread and everyone ate happily.

I found this recipe flavorful and delicious; however, I substituted green bell peppers instead of the celery.  It was fantastic!  Good slow cooker recipe!

Brilliant! I didn't change a thing and it was so good. Even my 10 month old son loved eating it. Although I added extra veggies for him after the fact. This is a keeper, for sure!

This is the perfect recipe. Easy enough to put together, few pots and pans, not too many ingredients, and just tastes fantastic. Within a few days of making it I can't wait to make it again. 

To finish it off I add cooked rigatoni and some of the sauce to a saute pan and heat for a few minutes. Some of the sauce is incorporated into the pasta that way, and it thickens the sauce too.

I halved the recipe and made it on the stovetop, letting it simmer for an hour.  I think we would have liked it better without the cream, but it is a great alternative to regular red sauce.

Loved this recipe!  Added red pepper, mushrooms and carrots.  Simmered a few hours on the stove instead of using a crock pot.  Served over Mascarpone polenta.  Didn't need to add any salt or other seasonings.  Will definitely make again!

This is now our go-to recipe when we want a red pasta sauce. Make it with the celery! I too would normally add a green bell pepper to a pasta sauce, but I think it's the celery that makes this work so well. The cream really puts this one over the top, but it's delicious even without it.

It’s hard to rate a recipe when you’ve changed it but I found it to be a good base to build your own sauce from. Like the other reviewers I eliminated the celery and added other vegetables like Carrots, Peppers and Zucchini. It’s a delicious way to make it your own.

Lovely recipe! Five stars is rare for me. Usually a really good recipe gets four stars. But this recipe is great. I made it as submitted and we all loved it. I served it over fried polenta and topped it with freshly grated parmesan cheese. Top notch!

I did not make any changes to this recipe, except for one, I don't cook it in a slow cooker.  I cook this one top of my stove for a couple of hours.   This is one of my go to recipes when calling for Italian Sauce.  If I do not need a cream based sauce, I just leave out the cream.  It is great both ways.

Thank you Terry Wilson!!!

I made this recipe as written. Other than the sauce being runny it was thoroughly enjoyed. Thanks for sharing.
