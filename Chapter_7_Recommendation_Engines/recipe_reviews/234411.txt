I thought this was good. I followed the directions exactly, just using 1/2 package of turkey kielbasa, I had leftover, and half the amount of carrots as it was what I had. It is filling and has a pretty descent flavor, especially considering how quick it is to make. ty

A perfect soup for the fall. Sauteing the kielbasa to a deep brown adds a great depth of flavor.

This is a great recipe! I sauted the kielbasa to a deep brown, then added the onion and garlic and deglazed the dutch oven. Once the pan had deglazed I added the carrots, tomatoes and spices as the recipe is written. I will make this again and add other veggies; whatever I have on hand. Great solid recipe!
