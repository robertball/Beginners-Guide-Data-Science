Followed base recipe and then added a generous amount of curry powder and cayenne to suit our tastes. Also threw in a diced zucchini, one potato, half a red pepper and a dozen shrimp. Finished with a handful of cilantro. More than enough liquid to coat all these additions, and it was delicious!

Such a good recipe for Swai. I've been searching for a fish recipe that is unique, I finally found it. I did make some changes. I added 4 large garlic cloves, shredded sweetened coconut flakes, pink sea salt, Also I added curry, ginger and cilantro recommended by other reviewers and I used lite coconut milk. I served it with brown rice cooked in the leftover coconut milk and steamed broccoli. My fiancé who doesn't even like fish loved it! I highly recommend it.

The only thing I changed was not adding hot sauce, and it was very easy and yummy! I'd never had swai before, and I was pleased! This dish didn't taste sweet like I expected it to, but it was delicious. I think next time I'd leave out the salt, because the soy sauce does the job. I served it with asparagus and coconut rice, and it made a delicious meal!

I love this recipe! I took the lead of some of the our fellow chefs and I added curry. I made a much bigger Batch so I adjusted the measurements a little. I also use this as a bass recipe and I added sweet potato carrots onions and you guys. I did add a little chicken brothas well. I seasoned the sway in curry in adobo and so Frito the night before. This came out great! My family loved it!

I actually took feedback suggestions and added the diced zucchini, potato, red pepper and a whole can [2c] of coconut milk and served this as a soup. I did adjust the spices accordingly.  I omitted the salt. sprinkled fresh cilantro on top and it was outstanding! Served with crusty bread to get every morsel.

Made it for the first time. Looking for a swai/basa recipe with a bit of character, and this fit the bill fully. It was/is delicious. Next time I would add more hot sauce for personal tastes, but it was perfect the way the recipe shows. Prepared it for folks who are not "fish" people, and they loved it. Definitely will use this often, both for home use, and for dinner parities. Excellent and easy!

While I did make changes, the basic recipe is great! I needed the entree to be mild for health reasons so no hot sauce .  I sautéed garlic with a tarragon, shallot spice blend in coconut oil, butter and olive oil (equal parts). After adding coconut milk I added 1/3 cup of Pinot Grigio , then added diced (cooked) yams, diced cilantro, salt/pepper. Added zested  
Meyer lemon peel before juicing . Added both juice and zest to coconut sauce. I added a pinch of curry, then added the nearly defrosted  Swai to poach. When poaching was complete (3-4 min). While poaching I made a chiffonade of fresh spinach but I think shredded asparagus would also compliment beautifully. Removed fish to a warmer while spinach was blanching so I didn't over cook the fish. After plating the fish I distributed thinly sliced lemon, paprika and finely chopped parsley.   Served it  with Thai Fried Rice.

Delicious and quick! I followed the directions exactly except I didn't think it needed any thickening at the end, so I omitted the cornstarch. It also seems like a superb take-off point for so many flavors, and for any mild white fish - curry, smoked or hot paprika, hot peppers, lemon juice and zest ... I'll be coming back to this for sure.

it doesn't look like it would be very apprtizing but there is so much flavor. I added a small tab of red curry to it as well. Definitely will make again.

Excellent base recipe, very simple.  I jazzed it up both times I made it with some sauteed veggies (mushrooms, carrots, onions, sweet potatoes, spinach - use what you have or like)  Also added ginger,turmeric, garlic and curry powder.  Made the rice ahead of time, as I generally use brown rice.  sauteed the veggies, then made the recipe and added the veggies.  Delish, easy and healthy!

Super easy and I liked the flavor. I definitely wanted to serve it with something that had a crunch to it, so I took the suggestion of green beans (barely sauteed) and also made coconut rice. With some mango and cilantro it was a big hit.

It was so easy to make yet finished product was so surprisingly tasty.  The whole family enjoyed this dish!  Followed recipe exactly but had extra minced fresh ginger on hand already so that was added with the garlic but I'd think it would have been just as good without it.  Had 3.7 lbs of swai/basa fillets actually so recipe was adjusted accordingly, however, we only used 1 can of coconut milk.  Since it's a saucy dish, ended up serving this atop mashed potatoes along with green salad and dinner rolls.  Will definitely be making this again!

I'm impressed! For something with few ingredients this was tasty! I didn't add salt because the tamari (soy sauce) has more than enough saltiness. I served this with green beans and Belizean rice.
