This is the only recipe for beef stew and/or pot roast that we use since my original review in 2003!  I've used it since the first day I found it here on allrecipes and my entire family just LOVES the gravy that it makes!!!  After making stew with it, I decided to make the same gravy mix & put it over pot roast with equally delicious results.  Can't say enough good about it...whenever I make it for company, they go crazy over it & say it's the BEST they've ever had!

This certainly was easy, and did indeed make a nice brown gravy!  We enjoyed it, but I would say it's more like a beef-stroganoff, as there are no vegetables included in the stew.  I substitued low-fat cream of mushroom soup for the regular; I would have also done the same for the cheddar cheese soup but I couldn't locate the low-fat version. I also couldn't find the beef-onion dry soup mix, so I had to use the basic onion soup instead.  I used only 2 lbs. of stew meat, as I was only cooking for the two of us.  I served it over garlic mashed potatoes, with a side of steamed asparagus.  I'll make it again!

This was easy and now one of our favorites.  I made the recipe exactly as the directions said but used low sodium mushroom soup and it was great.  I gave this recipe out at work and they came up with 3 other versions.  1. Use the spicy cheddar cheese soup version without the beefy onion soup.  2. Add 1/2 a cup of wine to the original recipe.  3 Marinate the beef overnight in wine and season salt.  Each person loved it and will make it again.

This is a great slow cooker recipe. I add carrots, celery and potatoes during the last part of cooking to take care of the saltyness. We fight over the leftovers(if there are any) Also use low soduim and low fat soups where possible

Terrific recipe! The only change I made was to brown the meat before putting it in the crock-pot. Next time I will make a point of using low-sodium soups, as this was a litte bit salty for my taste. But a definite keeper!! Served it with mixed frozen vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes. Even better the next day.

My husband loved this stew.  I used cream of celery soup because Ilike the flavor better.  I also added potatoes and carrots.  Very delicious and couldn't be easier to make!

Followed recipe to the letter but added 1/2 chopped white onion, 2 crushed gloves of garlic and a small red pepper finely chopped.  Served with mashed potatoes.  We really enjoyed the dish and definitely will prepare it regularly, expecially on cold evenings.

This was very simple and tasted pretty good.  I'm sure it would be great over mashed potatoes, but I didn't want to take the time so I served over egg noodles.  The beef chunks of stew meat were too big, so for the leftovers I shredded the beef in my food processor and I liked that much better.  This recipe made so much, that I not only fed my family but took it to my neighbors to have as well.

This is a fantastic base recipe! Like others I added some potatoes and carrots. I also replaced the can of cheddar cheese soup with a 2nd can of cream of mushroom. I then added 2 pinches of crushed red pepper flakes and set my slow cooker on high for the recommended time. I did add a little bit of water, maybe 1/4 cup to thin it out just a little to what I consider stew consistency. In the last hour I added a can each of green beans, corn and sliced mushrooms (all drained) and half a bag of frozen peas. My fiancee kept commenting on how good it smelled while it was cooking. And it tasted fantastic! The red pepper flakes added a wonderful, light spice to the whole thing. With my additions this reminded me of a stew my mom would make when I was a kid called Cowboy Stew. Will be using this recipe again!

Sooooo good, easy, nice thick gravy and melt in your mouth meat. YUM! My 21 yr old son LOVE's this stew. I have to say I was a little reluctant to try this but it had such good reviews and now I see why. The only minor change I made was I didn't have beef with onion soup mix (so I used what I had) one pkg Lipton (2.0 oz) dry soup mix and one cube Knorr's beef bouillon. I also added one large onion sliced (I love onion's) the rest I followed to a T. I served it over egg noodles which we really liked, this time I'm going to try it over white rice. Thank you for such a good and easy recipe this is going into my top 10 favorites.

I think this is definitely a keeper for our family although I added potatoes, carrots and peas half way through.  It is a little salty so next time I will look for sodium reduced/free soups.  I was looking for a brown gravy stew and this is it!  All other slow cooker beef stew recipes had tomatoes added and my step-daughter can't eat highly acidic veggies.  This is a very hearty stew for the winter!  A great comfort food!

I must admit, I was very surprised by how yummy this was.  I was really worried about combining cheddar cheese soup with mushroom soup to make a beef stew.  But this was absolutley fantastic.  I didn't have onion soup mix, so left that out, Added a can of chicken broth, some salt, pepper, celery seed, onion powder, and thyme (I don't measure, sorry), carrots, and potatoes and it was really tasty and the gravy was perfect.  Quick, easy, and ingredients that I have on hand.

Very good and takes no to prepare, we followed the recipe as written, I think next time we will add some veggies like carrots and/or potatoes to make it more traditional.

Very easy and tastes great.  I used venison meat just because we had on hand, and served over spirial noodles, which held the gravy well.  My personal opinion is that the onion soup mix has a tendency to make recipes taste the same when used.  Other than that, it's a great dish.

This was pretty good.  I did saute some green peppers and onions in about 1/4 cup butter first.  Used leftover roast beef, so I just cooked it on the stovetop in my dutch oven.  Cooked up some egg noodles and added them to the pot.  I added 1 cup water and 1 tsp beef bullion to compensate for the lack of liquids raw meat would have produced.  I also added a little garlic powder.  Will make again.

My husband liked this "stew" a lot! I thought it was okay. The idea of using the whole envelope of beef onion soup made me cringe because of all the saltiness so I used half. I also used carrots and added mushrooms at the last hour and served over egg noodles. I agree this is more a stroganoff!

As a recipe on its own I'd give this a 2 star rating but as a base this is ok. I added half a bag of frozen mixed veggies, 2 cans of corn,2 cans of mushrooms,1 can of diced potatoes(all canned veggies as low or no sodium as I could get and well drained)I skipped the onion soup mix(don't like onion)I didn't have any cheese soup but I did have a can of chedder broccoli potato chicken soup so I threw that in instead. I only had beef round which worked nice but I think next time I'll use chuck roast. I also added a couple of tablespoons of Italian seasoning to the pot for flavor. When it was done I served it over mashed potatoes. The husband and I loved it, the kids poked it so more leftovers for me and the husband. I used as low sodium soups and veggies as I could after reading the reviews and with the lower sodium items it didn't taste too salty. I had to add veggies because a stew to me is not a stew without some vegetable in it! It turned out very thick and filling. I will be making this again especially during the winter!

I didn't know how the soups were going to mix well, but they did!  I wish I would have doubled them so we had more sauce as I added celery, carrots and potatoes.  This was SUPER easy and quick.  My entire family really liked this.  Some of the other slow cooker stews on this site are good too, but not as fast and easy as this one.

Very good but keep in mind it will be a bit salty as both cans of soup and powdered onion/beef has tons of sodium.  But the flavor is very good.
I added thinly sliced carrots, celery at the beginning and peas at the end to make it a complete meal.  Worked great.

Very tasty and so easy and versatile. I added potatoes which were wonderful, but next time I will add carrots and celery and serve over egg noodles. You can't go wrong with this recipe. Yum! Thank you so very much for sharing this.

Pretty good.  I added carrots and served it over rice.  I think when I make it again I will add more flavors - perhaps garlic or bayleaf.  I used 3 lbs of black angus beef stew meat and it was very tender.  Good slow cooker supper.  Thank you for the recipe.

Super easy and VERY tasty! Great gravy. :) I think next time I'd add a can of mushrooms to it. We served this over egg noodles, I think it would be even better over creamy mashed potatoes (next time)! :) My son gobbled it up and wanted seconds. :) I only used about 3/4 a packet of onion soup mix to help cut down on the saltiness and didn't find this salty at all. The meat is really tender and I'm looking forward to leftovers! :) (I did find this to be very much like stroganoff, but could see adding the potatoes, carrots, etc. making it easier to "see" as a stew)!

This was a very good base recipe. I was looking for something different to put in the slow cooker and tried this one because I had everything on hand. After reading reviews we eat low/ no salt diet and I was afraid that the dry soup mix would make it too salty but IT DID NOT. I added a splash of red wine a little green pepper, potatoes, carrots & mushrooms. Served on top of rice and DH could not stop raving about it. Next time I will not add potatoes and will serve it on mashed potatoes.  There will be a next time as this will go on our meal rotation!

Pretty good actually and most definately quick and easy, followed the tips others gave and added some red wine, cut amount of beef to 2 lbs but added lost of veggies, used low sodium soup, was afraid the 2 cans would not cover the stew well with the extra veggies so added some water but did make lots of gravy so that was not neccessary.  would make again.

This was not a favorite of ours.  After tasting it, as other reviewers stated, it was too salty for me, so I added a can of cream of celery soup.  That really helped the too salty.

This was OK, but too meaty for me. I thought it would taste somewhat cheesy, but it didn't, really. It was good over mashed potatoes, but I don't think I'll be making this one again.

This recipe was so simple, and my family loved the gravy.  The meat lacked flavor though, so next time I make it, I'll season the meat with garlic salt and brown it in a little oil before putting it in the slow cooker.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  However, I did add potatoes, carrots & peas.  Also, I put it over noodles.
I've taken it to a friends home and to work and they all love it.

This was a quick to make dinner, and I was surprised it made as much gravy as it did with no added liquid. I added carrot and about a 1/4 of an onion I had so it wouldn't be wasted, otherwise I followed the recipe as posted above. I thought it was really pretty good, it wasn't 5 stars but with some added veggies and herbs. That could give it a nice boost and bring it to the next level. Another poster also mentioned adding mushroom and sour cream, I thought that sounded right on target for this dish too.

This was fantastic for supper tonight----it's -25 with the windchill. This recipe is probably really good as is, but I never follow a recipe exactly. For one thing, I used venison---hey, deer season is practically a holiday in Wisconsin. Also, I used cream of celery. It was either that or cream of chicken; I was NOT about to go out in subzero weather for one lousy can of soup. I added a can of corn, potatoes, celery, carrots, some thyme, garlic (of course) a couple dashes of crushed red pepper, worcestershire, and some liquid smoke. Served with fresh baked bread it was enough for me, hubby and our 3 kids---we even had some left over. Yay!

WOW! Didnt know about this with the cheese soup...but this was AMAZING! I did add carrots, onions and celery to the gravy. My husband LOVED this and he usually isnt to keen on stews with just meat and veggies! Alot of flavor! Paired with mashed potatoes!

So easy and extremely tasty!  This will now be on my meal rotation.  The crock pot was on for 8 hours total on low.  A little less then 2 hours before it was done I added diced potatoes and carrots.

I thought this was ok but nothing spectacular.  It does turn out into a good stew but needs potatoes, carrots, maybe tomatoes and thyme to be great.  Served on egg noodles, it's reminiscent of beef stroganoff, but seems to be missing the 'umpf'.

This was okay. Just very salty! Maybe by adding potatos/ carrots /mushroom it would cut down on the salt factor.

My family really liked this recipe.  I added a bit of water because I thought it would be too thick, but I don't know that I needed too.  We served it over mashed potatoes.  Since we aren't big leftovers fan, I put the rest in a pot pie for the next day.

Pretty good stew!  I used the low sodium mushroom soup and only 2 lbs of stew meat.  Then added 2 lbs of chopped potatoes, chopped carrots and celery, 1/2 cup of red wine, and 1/3 a cup of beef broth.  It definitely made it soupy and not thick/creamy like other people said.  I was impressed!

Not bad at all. My family liked it. I cooked it on low and it was done in 4 hours so I would be careful with the cooking time. The meat was so tender that you could cut it with just a fork. I do think that next time I will omit the cheddar cheese soup and use two cans of cream of mushroom instead.

honestly, the best stew I have ever tasted - I used two cans of mushroom soup instead of one and used a pack of regular onion soup mix as Superstore had run out of beef onion.  I added a can of drained mushrooms and some peas and served it over garlic mashed potatoes with dinner rolls on the side.  The perfect meal for a rainy night at home.

My family loved it.  I used cream of celery rather than the cream of mushroom (my son hates mushrooms), and I added 5-celery stalks, three potatoes, and one and a half cups of carrots.  I also added a half of a can of beef broth.

This was good and easy.  But it's more like beef stroganoff than beef stew.  To enhance the stroganoff flavor, I added 1/3 cup sour cream and mushrooms towards the end.  Next time I'll go for the stew effect and add potatoes and carrots at the beginning and some green beans and mushrooms towards the end.

Good but I didn't find it much different from other stews I have tried and tasted before and it is on the salty side.  HOWEVER, my family liked this alot and requested its repeat! I'll make again on nights I anticipate being too busy to cook.

Great recipe,  I read the reviews and cut back on the beef onion soup (only used 1 tbl) ,  Chopped up 1/2 an onion, diced 4 potatoes and added about 4 carrots,  My wife is still raving about how good it was, had some neighbors over for dinner and sent what was left to other neighbors who had just got home from the hospital   They all raved about it and asked for the recipe.  Definitely adding it to my favorites.

Everyone loved it! I used French onion mix instead of beefy onion and added black pepper to cook.  I served it over egg noodles with a little turmeric sprinkled on top.

This was good. Made as-is with no extras or substitutions. Slow-cooked on low for 7 hours and the meat was tender. Very heavy, tho... trust me, a small serving will do you well. It needs a little something, however. A vegetable, probably. Will make again but will add carrots to see if that makes it a five-star for me. Thank you for the recipe!

I liked how easy this was and the fact that when it was done, you had a gravy without having to thicken it, but it was a little bland to me.  The only thing that I added was carrots so that I would have a whole meal when served with mashed potatoes.

Best beef stew ever.
I made this last week and it was perfect.
The flavor was right on and creates a really nice gravy after a few hours. I added some baby carrots, potatoes and baby snow peas and it was a complete meal and get this My girlfriend who usually won't even try my cooking loved it and she is begging me to make this again this week
Thanks for the great Recipe

We make this monthly now.  It is my husbands favorite.  The stew meat gives this a roast like feel, and the four simple ingredients make this quick and easy to toss in the slow cooker before work.  
Planning to try this with boneless pork loin.

Wonderful! My dinner guests loved it and there was plenty to go around.  I rarely eat beef, but this was very good. I substitued cream of poblano soup for the cheddar cheese soup to add some kick.

I made this just as printed only used cream of celery soup that I had on hand.  For sure a 5 star recipe.  Easy, delish.  Ok, a little salty and I'll look for low sodium soups maybe next time. Thanks for a very good meal

I was skeptical because there are so few ingredients but this was VERY good.  I sort of followed the recipe but did add some vegetables (carrots, celery, potatoes, canned mushrooms) and used a chuck roast cut into cubes.  I find that the stew meat you buy in the store is either old or poor quality.  I didn't think there would be enough liquid but it was perfect.  I don't even typically like beef stew and I loved this.  It was even better warmed up the next day.

I cooked this for my husband who is a very picky eater and he loved it as much as I did...The only thing was I used two cans of cheddar cheese soup instead of one and I used ground meat instead of beef tips as I just gotten dentures so was easier for me to eat over mashed potatoes! And is very budget friendly!

I am going to go ahead and give this a 5 despite it being a bit salty. I will use low sodium soups next time to fix that. This is a delicious and extremely versatile recipe. Add vegis as you like or leave it plain, serve over noodles or potatoes or polenta. It is soooooooo delicious!!

This is one of the first recipes from this web site and Its A Home Run - I add baby carrots, a small chunky cut onion and potatoes for a real stew and serve over rice - Love stew over rice. Then divide the leftovers and freeze for comfort food in a rush.  This is the best stew recipe***** fast and easy

I took this to a friend's to feed a crowd (about 25 folks). Everyone LOVED it. I was a little nervous as it was the first time I had tried the recipies. I was pleasantly surprised as was my family. Nothing came home with me.

Excellent and simple.  The only deviations I made was adding fresh mushrooms and used the slow cooker.  We served over hot noodles.

For those of you skeptical of trying this recipe...don't be.  I made it this evening for my husband and 2 year old.  We all loved it.  in facet, my husband commented that he could not believe this started as cream of mushroom soup and cheddar cheese soup.  It tasted like a good homemade stew.  We did add 2 diced potatoes, some chopped carrots and frozen peas.  Again, we loved it!!!!

This was really good and super easy. I added 2 potatoes, 3 small carrots, an onion, a few stalks of celery, a few splashes of red wine (1/4-1/2 cup I didn't measure), and 2 1/2 tbsp of tapioca to thicken it up a bit. I think I'll add a bit more next time as it was still a little runny due to adding the wine.   Made the house smell wonderful.

I loved this recipe. It was amazing. I took the advice from a previous post and added half a red pepper and half a green pepper. Then I cut up some mushrooms, added peas/carrots, and minced garlic. The flavor was completely out of this world.

My family absolutely loved this.  We ate it over both rice and noodles.  It had a great flavor and the meat was extremely tender.

Excellent recipe. I went with the healthy versions of all the soups to lower the soduim content and it came out great. Very easy and very tasty, I'll make this again.

This recipe was good but it could have used a little something.  I followed it to the letter except I used low salt cream of mushroom soup and I added a little black pepper for snap.  I worried that there would not be enough liquid in this mixture but it made its own broth very nicely without adding anything extra.  I will make it again but in the future I will add carrots and in the last hour some frozen peas.  Also this recipe could use some seasonings to make it more interesting.  I'm still an absolute beginner so I couldn't give you any advice there.  If you know what you're doing though don't be afraid to add your own flair to it.  Just DON'T add salt.  If you do you'll be sorry, it was plenty salty the way it was.

I used only 2 lbs of stew meat, reduced-sodium cream of mushroom soup and added a couple of splashes of red cooking wine. I seasoned the meat with garlic powder and flour, seared it in oil, and then cooked on high for about 4 1/2 hours, adding sliced carrots, mushrooms, and frozen peas with pearl onions during the last hour of cooking. The meat came out fairly tender, but I think it's always best to cook on low heat in a crockpot if time permits. This made plenty of gravy and had a nice flavor - with the vegetables, it reminded me of pot roast. Easy and tasty - my husband ate it open-faced on a thick slice of bread with mashed potatoes, and he loved it.

Great flavor and simple to make!  I added carrots and potatoes and served it over some egg noodles (yeah yeah, that makes 2 starches, but it was good!!).  It will make a great meal for a cold, winter night!

My family thought this was very good.  It was a little saltier than I am used to, but no overwhelmingly so.  My picky husband said he didn't think it was too salty at all.  I did put some potatoes in with it which I think I read somewhere can absorb some of the salt.  I also dredged the meat in flour and garlic powder and browned first.  I think I may go low sodium next time, but will definitely make again.  Great on a cold snowy day!

This was good.  I served it over garlic mashed potatoes.  My only complaint is that the stew meat was tough.  Next time, I'll probably try this with a roast, instead, and shred it at the end.

This was very hearty and good over mashed potatoes.  Simple and easy.  I added a drained can of mushrooms to this because we love mushrooms.  I would put this in the category of comfort food.

I had some meatballs to use up so I decided to use this sauce. I cooked the meatballs separately and the. Put everything into the slowcooker for 4 hours. I found the sauce to be too thick so 1/2 way through cooking time I stirred in about 1/4 cup milk. The sauce was good over pasta. This was very easy to put together and will likely use it again.

I thought recipe was a bit too bland.  After it had cooked, I added some garlic and onion powder, parsley and basil.  I also added some herb sea salt as well.  Then I let it cook a while longer.  We had it over mashed potatoes and EVERYONE absolutely loved it!!!!

I'm just chiming in, I first made this back in the 80s when I had just gotten married.  I don't remember where I found it, maybe in the newspaper, but I've been making it exactly as given for that many years and everyone loves it.  Easy, tastes good, feeds a hungry crew with left overs.  Like a perfect go to recipe.  I'm making it tonight's dinner as a matter of fact.

I love this recipe.  I cooked mine in the oven on 325 for about 2 1/2 hours. Will be making it often. I first learned about this in a church cook book back in the 80s.  It's still so, so good.  I served it over side noodles.  Thanks for bringing this back to me.

I've made this a number of times and my family loves it.  I've made it As Is, no changes from the recipe here.  I have also thrown cut up potatoes and onions in it.  I've served it alone and I've served it on rice  or noodles.  I've served it a bumch of ways and it always goes over well.  Super super easy.

This is a good meat and gravy type recipe. It was very easy.  I mixed in Reames frozen noodles (prepared before I added them) before serving.  Perfect comfort food and made a lot.  Can't wait to have the left overs.

I did make some changes after reading some of the reviews. I added a 1/2 pound of baby carrots and 2 cups of baby portabella mushrooms. During the last 15 minutes I added 2 tablespoons of corn starch dissolved in 1/3 cup of cold water to thicken up the gravy. I served it over buttered parsley egg noodles, with sweet peas and fried apples as sides. My family enjoyed it and said that they would like to have it again. I think that this is a great recipe for good comfort food.

Any slow cooker recipe is a pleasure to make--but Debbie's recipe is basic and adds to the pleasure factor.  If you go with 3 pounds of stew meat, you might want to consider doubling the other 3 ingredients; otherwise, 1 1/2 pounds meat should be within normal range.  By itself per directions, the flavor is more beefy than cheese flavored; a touch of Worchestire of Liquid Smoke ( small amount ) could add more beefy body to the taste.  I'm inspired by the other suggestions--but grateful credit to Debbie for offering us all this recipe!!

Tasty meal!  I did opt out of the cheese soup and used another can of cream of mushroom.  My husband, being the meat and potatoes guy wanted me to make it a real stew so of course red potatoes quartered, baby carrots, onions, and fresh mushrooms went in too during the last few hours of cooking.  Wonderful gravy, cooked just right veggies, and this tender meat went over some egg noodles!  This one goes into the rotation!  Delicious on the day it was cooked and tasted even better the next day!

This stew was easy and delicious. I used two cans of low sodium cream of mushroom soup because I couldn't find the cheese soup. I also added baby carrots and small red potatoes (cut in half) the last two hours of cooking. To round out the flavor I added some Marsala wine. I would recommend cutting up the stew meat into smaller pieces before adding to the slow cooker as well.

I used Lipton's onion dip mix because I couldn't find the beef one the recipe calls for. Super easy and super delicious. All 3 of my kids - 4, 6, and 8 years old devoured it. And that's saying something! The hubs loved it too. I am so glad I found a stew recipe that doesn't involve a bunch of chopping and measuring! However, if I am ever wanting carrots and celery, it would go well in this gravy. Thank you!!

Ok, I know, I know - you aren't supposed to rate something five stars if you make changes, but I didn't change the concept, only made it healthier.  I'm not big on canned cream of "stuff."  I found a recipe for a substitute using powdered milk, cornstarch and I can't remember what else.  Way healthier.  If its cream of chicken use chicken base, cream of mushroom use fresh mushroom, etc.  Anyway.  to start  I browned the beef in vegetable oil seasoned with a seasoning salt and cayenne pepper, removed the beef from the pan then softened some onion in the oil,  I poured in a bottle of india pale ale beer and simmered down, added the cream of soup sub I use with a beef soup boullion (2 cans worth), then put the beef back in,  a bag of shredded cheese and let it simmer for two hours (started too late for the crockpot).  Holy cow was this yummy!!  And so easy.  We buy sides of beef and always have tons of extra stew meat.  Not anymore!  Oh - I added some cubed potatoes too to make it a full meal.

This is definitely a keeper!  It was a little salty for my taste, but I didn't have enough meat so I'm sure that made a difference.  We served it over whole grain rice with roasted potatoes and carrots on the side!

Used cream of mushroom w/roasted garlic instead of the regular stuff.  Otherwise stuck to recipe as written.  Very easy and very good. My picky husband even liked it.  He suggested I use sirloin tips next time.

This was good.  I would make it again but I may add a bit more seasoning.  It actually tasted better the following day warmed up.  I did add potatoes and carrots and the meet was melt in your mouth.

This is the only beef stew I'll make.  Throw in some beef cubes (sometimes I'll brown them first if I'm feeling really ambitious), mix in the 2 soups and dried onion soup mix, set on Low in crock-pot for 8 hours and we're good to go.  I usually throw in some pre-cooked potatoes and carrots around the 6hr mark.  Whip up some biscuits and dinner is done!  My only suggestion is not to add any salt because the onion soup mix is salty enough.

I used cream of celery soup instead of mushroom. A bit salty, next time I will try adding some veggies to help with that. Very good over mashed potatoes! (Though we joked that it looked like Alpo!)

The flavor was okay but this is not "Manly" by any means.  I had to add cooked carrots, mashed potatoes, egg noodles, and garlic bread and my husband cleaned his plate without feeling full at all!  It's more like a stroganoff, as another reviewer said.  A wonderful stroganoff recipe is at  allrecipes.com Slow Cooker Beef Stroganoff by Jessica... highly recommend if that's what you're looking for.  This just wasn't enough for us.  Sorry!  It was very easy and really wanted to like it.  Just not at all what we expected.

I have tried beef stew recipe after recipe to find "the one", and my search is finally over.  I added some potatoes, celery, and baby carrots and it was amazing!  Couldn't be easier, and it's the best stew I've ever made.

This was so easy to throw together!  We loved the gravy...the best part!  Served with mashed potatoes and a veggie.  Thanks!

This is one of those things that just doesn't sound like it will work - but works so well!  Fantastic gravy once it all cooks down with the meat juices!  Rich and deep brown and flavorful!  I had no idea!  It's in my meal planning now- I will double the meat next time though - there was a lot of 'extra' gravy that was eaten with bread.

This was good, but a bit thick.  I think I cooked it too long, as it was in a large crockpot.  Will try again.

Fantastic!!  Quote from child, "Mom, of ALL the new recipes you have tried, this is the BEST!"  "You can make this again and again!" I will make with mash potatoes next time...there is so much wonderful gravy for the potatoes to soak up.

DELICIOUS stew.  Made this Sunday night while craving a good cold weather meal (had to take advantage of the fact it was actually chilly here) and it definitely did not disappoint.  As others suggested I threw in some potaotes, carrots, and a little bit of chopped garlic.  It was super filling, but so delicious I made my way back into the kitchen for seconds!

Good stew.  This is the first I have ever done.  I just added some beef broth because I was worried it would not be liquidie(?) enough, it came out good.  I just find there needs to be more spices.  Next time I think I will take the potatoes and shake them in a ziploc bag with spices.  Overall... will make this again!

I followed the directions, but only sprinkled the beefy/onion soup over the top of the beef.  I found "fajita" meat which was chopped small to be a better value at the grocery store.  This cooked up quick, prep time was only 5 min.  Before heading out the door for church.  We served it over Basmati Rice with steamed veggies on the side.

This was a wonderful meal.  I did make a couple of changes though.  First I coated my stew meat with some flour, salt, and pepper then browned it in a skillet with a little vegetable oil.  Then when I combined everything into the slow cooker I added two bags of frozen stew vegetables at the beginning.  This did get really thick so I used a little beef broth to thin it.  My family loved it!  Will definitely make this again.

This is not really a stew, at least not stews that I am used to. But if you like lots of meat and gravy then this is for you.

I used a little less than the 3 full pounds of beef as my husband loves things with lots of gravy/sauce.  Other than that, followed recipe and it was a big hit! 
Definitely a keeper.

not what we would call a stew in iowa, more of a stroganoff. served over noodles with a dollop of sour cream in that spirit. my daughter colleen won't eat stew made out of men, though.

This was very good. I substituted the cheddar soup with southwest cheese soup, and it turned out great.

Yuk! This made a really rich and nice smelling brown gravy which I served over biscuits, but it was too salty for me and didn't taste as good as it smelled. My kids didn't like it at all!

Extremely easy; very tender and it makes a wonderful gravy! My very picky 13yo LOVED it!  I added some frozen peas at the very end. A definite keeper.
