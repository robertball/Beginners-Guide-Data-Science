So easy, and really good!  I won't cook it so long next time though.

1-13-2017 This is just ok for me. Nothing really special, although it is better than just covering the chicken in soup and baking. My chicken breasts were very thick and large, so they needed the entire cooking time (unlike CooperCook). I served this with egg noodles which were good with extra sauce on them.
