I tried this recipe last night.  I did add 1/4c of butter to help the mix stay together- because it did seem a little crumbly.  The cookies turned out amazing.  I only made a dozen and rolled the rest into loaves so I could make them quick for a get together later this week.  I will definetly be making these as gifts for friends and family this year.  Thanks for another wonderful recipe!  I also like Cookie Mix in a Jar VI & VIII.

I made this recipe to see if I wanted to use it for gift giving.  It was very dry, hard to mix and did not turn out very well.  I double checked the ingredients I put in, so I know that wasn't the problem.  If I were you, I would try a different recipe.

This is a clever idea for a gift, however, (and I'm not sure this is why the dough was so dry) I used chunky peanut butter and the result was dry, crmbly dough that made dry, crumbly cookies.  For the second batch, I used enough milk to make a typical cookie dough consistency.  These turned out much better.  Definitely make them before you give them away to see if they work out better for you than they did for me.

I gave this as a gift to my sister. After she baked them she told me her 1 1/2 year old daughter kept saying "More cookie more cookie!"

Excellent cookies!  I was searching for a good chocolate peanut butter cookie and found this.  I didn't even make the mix; I just made cookies!

It would have tasted much better without the cocoa.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because i had to make a few changes.  Because of the super dry consistency of the original mix, I added about half a cup of milk to give it a nicer cookie consistency. I cooked them a few minutes longer, but they made for a super yummy chocolate peanut butter cookie.

This was really sugary! The dough was like powder. The cookie was as hard as a rock. I don't know if I made it wrong or what.

We made this recipe for ourselves, so it didn't get packed in a jar. It is a great recipe for little kids to help with and mix the dough with their hands. Like others, I found the dough to be too dry following the recipe instructions. I added some milk until the dough held together to shape into balls, and the cookies turned out fine. A great alternative to traditional straight-up peanutbutter cookies.
