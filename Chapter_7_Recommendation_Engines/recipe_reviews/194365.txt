Easy and delicious, cool and refreshing!  It took longer to unwrap the ingredients than it did to make the pie.  I will definitely make this again.  Cut the pie while still frozen, and put onto plates, but let it stand for 30 minutes before serving for the best flavor.

Used lowfat cream cheese, SF whipped topping, less-sugar pie filling and Splenda. I also made my own graham cracker crust with cinnamon graham crackers unsalted butter and Splenda. Light and fluffy and very nice on a hot day. I'm thankful I used low calorie products because then I don't feel AS guilty if I have another small piece. Everyone seemed to like this, husband had two large pieces.

This was a nice easy pie that was so good on a very hot day! I used FF cream cheese, the cherry pie filling sweetened with splenda, and SF whipped topping.  I made my own crust, which is something I seldom do lol.  My husband really enjoyed this pie and has already requested it again.  I think next time I will do like other reviewers have done and make it in muffin pans and experiment with different crusts and pie fillings.  I absolutely love a recipe like this that you can experiment with in all kinds of ways :)

This was Delicious!! It was easy and refreshing. I would like to play around with this and use different pie fillings. I used muffin tins to make this and put cinnamon cookies in the bottom as the crust. Thank you for a yummy!

Oh the menagerie of desserts you can create with cream cheese and cool whip! It never fails to amaze me the different dishes you can get out of the same basic ingredients. This creation was very good and incredibly easy to make. Next time, I will use the full can of cherry pie filling for a stronger cherry taste; I felt it was lacking a bit with just one cup. Other than that it was straightforward perfectionâ€¦

This came out delightful! Like another reviewer I made this dessert in a muffin pan for individual servings. I made my own graham cracker crust and used cupcake liners for easy removal of the pies. It worked out beautifully and I was pleasantly surprised by this. It is definitely different from the freezer pies I usually make and I am happy I tried it. Thanks for sharing!

This was great! So easy to make - I wasn't sure how to get the 'marble effect' it describes... mine turned out more mixed together and pink, but tasted great just the same. Will definitely be trying this with other fruits!

I loved this pie, so did my family! I brought it to my sister's for Christmas dinner (along with a pumpkin pie) and this was the favorite of all the 3 different desserts at her dinner. The only thing I will do different next time is 1~ buy more cool-whip- it didn't quite cover the top of the pie if you follow the directions, and I feel it could use a bit more mixed in as well (in my opinion) =) and 2~ take it out of the freezer at least an hour before serving, it was still frozen in places after leaving it out for 1/2 an hour (they said to take it out at least 10 mins before serving) so it will be all thawed. Other than that it's perfect!  This is a pie I will make quite frequently! I must add that I am pregnant, as is my sister, me near the end of my first trimester, her almost to the 3rd, so we're both in a phase where things don't taste as good and it's hard to eat since you feel 'full' all the time, and this pie we had NO problems with~ it was just the right pregnancy dessert! =) thanks to the creator!

Yummy and soooo easy! I changed the recipe slightly by accident, and it still came out awesome. I mixed all the whip topping in instead of reserving some for the top of the pie, and used the left over cherries on top of the pie. I froze and defrosted the next day. PERFECT!

I'm 26 weeks pregnant, saw this pie and knew I had to make it.I added a little extra cherry pie filling to the mix and still had enough to spoon over the top. The flavor is delicious I thought it could be a little sweeter but still enjoyed it. Make sure you let it sit for 10 minutes before eating so you can really taste all the flavors. Yum!

4.5 Fast, easy, and good summertime dessert!  I may up the pie filling to 1.5c. next time though as I thought it could use just a bit more cherries.

This was such a simple and refreshing pie! I had trouble with swirling the cherry filling into the cream cheese mixture...DON'T ASK, lol, so I just combined them together and it worked out fine. I will definately make this one again and may even try blueberry pie filling next time! Thanks for posting. :)

A light, simple, and very easy to make dessert.  Made as written and it turned out perfectly.  Cut while frozen and allow to defrost for about 10 minutes or so before serving.  Will definitely be making this one again trying different pie fillings.

Nice pie.  I substituted apples for the cherries.  It was a bit on the sweet side.  Next time I will stick to the cherries.

I loved this recipe. The main reason was because it was simple. I had to use raspberries instead of cherries, but I think that makes this recipe even better you can change it up. Because there was leftover fruit filling, I added it to the top of the pie like another layer and then put the whipped topping over it to finish. Wonderful. I agree this doesn't need to be frozen. I didn't ever freeze it all the way and the texture was like a creamy cheesecake. Easy and delicious.

This is pretty straight forward & tasted great, especially since it took all of 5 minutes to throw together.  The only thing I did differently was to just add in all of the whipped topping to the mixture.  I garnished the top of the pie with cherries & it came out looking very cute.  It doesn't have a ton of complex flavors, but for my outdoor deck party tonight it hit the spot.  :)
