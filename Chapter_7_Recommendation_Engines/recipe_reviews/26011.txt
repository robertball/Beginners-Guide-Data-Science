Flavor this gets a 5 star, recipe it's a three star, so I will give it a four. There were two major recipe problems - one is that the ingredient list calls for chopped chocoloate, then the recipe calls for melted chocolate with no step for melting. The second problem was with the sifting instructions. It calls for 2.5 C of sifted cake flour, but then the directions tell you to sift the flour with the baking soda and salt. For recipe semantics this was hard - do I sift once, measure and then sift again with other ingredients or did it really intend for 2.5 C flour, sifted. For the wet ingredients I decided that 2.5 C flour was appropropriate, so I sifted after measuring, but after eating I decided that I should have done a double sift, which would have resulted in a lighter cake with more rise to it. The comma was truly important here and I wonder if many of the complaints about the denseness could have alleviated with some clearer sifting direction. Anyway - the tast was wonderful - I ended up with little slivers of the white chocolate (since I didn't pre-melt). I will make again.

This is well worth the effort.  I got lots of compliments, and loved how light it was.  It's a great alternative to a heavier dark chocolate version.  I used cream cheese frosting in the middle, and frosted the rest with a traditional german chocolate frosting.

I was a little intimidated when I read the recipe but I was up for the challenge.  It was really not that difficult and it came out so good in the end.  My family said it belonged in a gourmet bakery, it was so pretty and the cake was really light and fluffy.  I save this one for special occassions or when I want to impress.

I have made this cake several times and always find it to be excellent.  Cakes are desserts and suppose to be sweet, just cut a smaller piece.  Wonderful recipe!

This is the second time I made this cake. I found the cake to be a bit on the sweet side, so the second time I cut the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and added 3 oz white chocolate.  That helped.  Also, I made the cream cheese frosting, but cut down on the quanity of cream cheese.  It is a delightfully light cake.

I made this for my husband's birthday since I don't have a homemade white cake recipe.  It was very easy to make but we all found it rather on the sweet side and I didn't even add the coconut or nuts since my husband doesn't like nuts.  I'm going to see if others try this and make some suggestions on cutting out the sweetness.  Only thing I can think of is cutting amount of white chocolate squares or cutting them out all together.  I'll try this one more time and see how it goes.

I love this recipe. It is now the only one I use for birthday cakes. I also use dark chocolate as well when chocolate cake is the flavor of the day:)
I found the cake super moist, slightly dense(like I wanted) with a soft crumb. Beautiful. Thank you

I thought this was a great recipe.  I found the batter to be super thick and the cake a little dry though.

This is a must have cake.  One of the best cakes around.  A lot of eggs and a lot of work but well worth it.

Excellent consistency and texture. This is the most delicious "from scratch" cake that I have ever tasted! 
My husband and 2 eight year olds gave it an A+ rating!

I made this cake for my daughter's 20th birthday and we all loved it. I don't think there is anything I would change about the recipe. I would agree with another reviewer, that the directions don't tell you how to melt the white chocolate, but other than that it was perfect. I just melted the white chocolate in a heat proof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. It was delicious. Thanks Sallie

Excellent!!!  I used this as the base cake for the "Tiramisu Layer Cake" recipe instead of using a box cake.  Will definitely do again!

Altho the cake was ok this recipe is not German chocolate. German chocolate is actually the chocolate used to make German chocolate cake. This is white chocolate cake with coconut pecan filling/frosting.

This cake was delicious! It has a great flavor wasn't too sweet. Changes I made: I used one cup of sugar instead of two and 6 - 7 ounces of white chocolate. I skipped the nuts and coconut. I used two 9 nine inch cake pans. I topped each with a homemade rasberry glaze. It came out wonderful!

I made these into cupcakes with these changes: 6.5 ounces white chocolate buttons, 2 cups all-purpose flour + 2T corn starch (no cake flour), 1/2 cup margarine (already using sour cream and doubled the chocolate), 1.5 cups white sugar, 1 cup sour cream (no buttermilk), and left out the coconut and pecans. Baked them in a convection toaster oven at 325F for 10 minutes (mini cupcakes) or 15 minutes (for regular cupcakes). They were a little sweet for me, but my officemates say they are great! I got a request to make some 3 dozens for our christmas party! Next time I'll use better quality chocolate. Thanks for the recipe!
