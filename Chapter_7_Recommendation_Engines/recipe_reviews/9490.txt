The recipe I've been searching for. I put in an equal weight of different fruits and nuts...I love candied pineapple and cherries. I thought there wouldn't be enough batter when I was mixing, but it turned out to be just right to hold the fruit together. Slice thin with a sharp, wet knife.

excellent! we chopped the nuts to make it easier to cut later.  i made it twice and varied the fruits and nuts keeping the pound amounts the same....  we loved that the cake only held the nuts and fruit in place....  will make again and again. thanks.

This is the recipe my husband asks for every  Christmas.  I often change the fruit and nuts, making sure there are always 4 pounds of fruit and 3 pounds of nuts.  This recipe makes 3 very large, heavy fruitcakes, so it's good for sharing. Our favorite combination is 1.5 pounds glace fruit (cherries & pineapple), 2.5 pounds mixed dried fruit (berries, golden raisins, apricots, mango, prunes, dates, papaya), 3 pounds nuts equal proportions brazil nuts, almonds, walnuts, and cashews. We follow the cake ingredients and instructions exactly as written.

I'm so glad I re-discovered this recipe. I used to make it some 30 years ago, but I had lost the recipe.
This is quick and delicious. Great for people who say that they don't like fruitcake. The recipe I had called for a mock hard sauce to serve over it, if desired. Thanks for sharing. Now I can make this next Christmas!

I make this delicious fruitcake just as written. I've made it for 10 years now. Everyone loves it, even people who don't like fruitcake. Just enough batter to hold the fruit and nuts together. I don't chop the nuts and the cake slices just fine. The slices are beautiful showing the colorful fruit and nut halves. Irresistible!!

One of my aunts made this many years ago, and mom lost the recipe.. so  found it a couple of years ago, and made it 4 times the recipe.. which I got here, and I spent hours cracking those nuts... but I baked them in small aluminum loaf pans, and gave them as christmas gifts.  I love this cake, and so I am going to do it again this year, but keep them all for me, lol.  No one likes 'fruit' cake, and if they don't try it how will they know.  I hate 'fruit' cake, myself, but this is awesome.
