This is a very versatile dough.  I make it in my bread machine (dough setting) and use it for dinner rolls, sweet rolls for breakfast,hamburger rolls, fried scones, and have even frozen it for a week and made absolutely delicious dinner rolls.  ednaa

This is the first time I have ever made dinner rolls. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out super soft and yummy! It was easy enough for a beginner to succeed!

I love this recipe. Made 1/2 of recipe in  bread machine using the dough mode.  Then I hand formed the rolls.  They were very light, soft and buttery.  They are good made in a cupcake pan.  I also made 1/2 the recipe in my bread machine. Makes a very light and tasty loaf of bread.

These were great.  Very tender.  I did not find them any more time consuming then most from scratch yeast dough recipes.  It did make alot though.  Might be nice to roll some in cinnamon and sugar after the butter then save for coffee while use the other half for the meal.

I made the full recipe--very tasty, light, and fluffy.  Easier than most home made rolls.  I am trying to freeze 1/2 the rolls for later.  Definetely will make these again.

These were just so so.  They didn't have the rich buttery taste I expected, nor were they very tender.

This recipe is a keeper! Absolutely buttery goodness! The family enjoyed them for Easter lunch but the smell drove my husband crazy as they baked, so he had to have two last night! Thanks for a great roll recipe. I will be making them again soon!

Highly recommend these rolls.  I recommend tasting the cook time.  Every oven is different and my first batch were a little dry.  I ended up cooking them for only 9 mins and they were delicious.

I used this easy recipe to make cinnamon rolls. I followed the directions exactly and ended up with a very light fluffy bread. I rolled it out and placed cinnamon, butter, and a brown sugar mixture over it. Then rolled it up and cut into 1" cinnamon rolls, baked and then topped with a cinnabon type icing. They were so good!! It is a must try.

these are great.  I actually substituted in 2 cups of robin hood multigrain flour, and I didn't use any vital wheat gluten, and they were still light and fluffy!  I got 18 nice sized rolls out of the 5 1/2 cups of flour (and unlike other recipes, this one was dead on with the flour measurement, 5 1/2 cups gave me a nice dough that pulled away from the sides of my KA bowl).  I put half in the fridge, and the other half in the freezer, and I might add, they freeze extremely well.  Overall, one of the best roll recipes I've tried to date.

I am a chicken:  I did proof my yeast, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it is PERFECT!  Any roll you make from scratch is bound to not be as quick as pulling something pre-made out of a package, but that's the cost of showing your family extra love.  Lovely dough to work with!  Thanks Charlotte!

Wow these rolls where a big hit! Everyone loved them. I did cut in half and still got 24 rolls. I also egg washed them. I have been trying different recipes for rolls and these are by far the best I have found. Great Recipe! I will make these for years to come!

Delicious recipe! I followed the instructions nearly as written - I just used less melted butter to roll the dough in. I cooked them slightly longer than the recipe suggested, and I will definitely not make this mistake next time. Will be making again!

Probably THE BEST roll recipe I have ever tried! They came out fluffy and were delicious straight out of the oven!! I found they we're a bit doughy, but only because I made them bigger (yeilded approx. 20) and still only cooked them for 15-20mins...oops! lol Other than my own mistake they were amazing! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I only made half the recipe and these came out great. I never made a bread or roll recipe where you don't proof the yeast first, so I was a bit hesitant to try this. But it turned out great in the end. Nice and soft inside, good tasting...but a bit time consuming. Used them to make Mini Meatball Subs (recipe also on this site) and it was great! I will definitely make this recipe again. Thanks for sharing!

This is an extremely versatile dough recipe.  And it's very easy to work with.  So far I've made it in my bread maker twice, on the dough setting.  The second time I goofed and added all the butter to the dough.  It didn't hurt anything.  However, this recipe is far too big for my breadmaker - the flour was all the way to the top, and when the breadmaker started to mix it, the flour spilled out onto the heating element and smelled TERRIBLE.  It was only a few minutes after starting, so I was able to clean it up and start it over at the beginning with no problems.  I have used this dough for dinner rolls and cinnamon rolls, it's fabulous!  I would recommend cutting in half though, especially if using a breadmaker!

These rolls tasted pretty good, though not sweet enough, in my opinion.  I would add a whole cup of sugar instead of just 1/2 cup. Overall, the rolls were easy to make & the dough was easy to roll when coating your hands with vegetable oil. I would make these again, using more sugar.

These rolls were delicious! 
Followed the directions to the T, but let the Kitchen Aide do all the work :)
Family gobbled them up, as did the neighbor I passed some too.
Will make these over and over again.

after several recipes for dinner rolls, this is the best of the best for me.  I am not good at baking or making any bread.  It made me a bit worried while making a dough because it was very, very, very soft, wet and sticky.  But it come out really nice! My husband said "look like pro!" and "taste as good as it looks!"  I guess that making super sticky dough is the key for very fluffy soft dinner rolls.  Thank you.

These rolls have become a regular for our holiday meals. I follow the recipe closely, with little to no changes.

I have made these on numerous occasions (30 or more) and they are amazing each and every time!  I get requests for them at every family gathering.  My grandsons won't eat anyone else's!  They are buttery, soft and delicious!  And I have around 40 people that would attest to that.

These were so soft, buttery and just plain yummy.  I ended up with 15 good-sized rolls, but will probably make them a bit smaller next time.  Reminded me a lot of the dinner rolls at Bob Evans restaurants.  Fantastic plain or with strawberry freezer jam!

Currently attempting to rise the dough - and finding that not preparing the yeast before hand is a HUGE mistake. Let the yeast dissolve into the water (warm it) before you mix in the milk and butter - or whichever works. But make sure you PREPARE THE YEAST.

Did a half batch for Thanksgiving, they were good, but, seems like a lot of hassle for a day like Thanksgiving when so much was going on in the kitchen.  I would try them again though on a normal day without all of the ruckus in the kitchen.

I made these for dinner last night, and the vanished!  They are so good!  I only made half the batch, as I didn't think a whole batch would fit in my bread machine, and they were absolutely perfect.  I will definately be making them again.

I have no idea what my problem is but I jsut can't get the dough to be soft and pliable - they were soft inside but tasted "floury" I doubt I will try these again

they were ok, but a bit dense-not sweet rolls, but then again this was my first attempt at yeast rolls alone
