Used fresh shrimp rather than canned and cut back a bit on the carrots, otherwise, followed the recipe.  Used a specialty tomato called a Kumato which has brownish skin instead of red, but very sweet.  The shrimp salad was runny, so I would try less lemon juice in the future.  This is VERY mild, a little light on flavor for us so I would try adding additional seasoning next time, maybe Old Bay or a shot of hot sauce (could be personal taste preference).  Enjoyed for lunch today.
