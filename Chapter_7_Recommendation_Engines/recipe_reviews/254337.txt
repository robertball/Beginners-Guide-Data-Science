This is a bit dry and crumbly. Next time, I will add a bit of the chickpea water. I ised buckwheat oats. I did add Sriracha. I served it with vegan sour cream mixed with Sriracha and a salad. Thank you for the recipe.

Super easy? Yes. Delicious? No. Using the same ingredients, just make yourself a peanut butter sandwich and a bowl of oatmeal.

This was my first home made veggie burger versus a long history of store bought / restaurant versions.  
I made a few modifications to the original recipe; more as a matter of what was available to me as opposed to taste preferences; those being, the use of almond butter and a home made pepper sauce.
It was a little disorienting in that it  tasted a bit too much like warmed hummus as opposed to an actual burger.  That being said; I really enjoy hummus, so I also enjoyed the burger.  It ended up being a bit too dry, and I needed to add a little bit of water to keep the patty whole.  The oat flavor was a little too strong for me  Not sure if it would be better to add less of it, or mask the oat flavor with another spice.  I think the almond butter was a good choice over peanut butter, as I think that the peanut butter may have been a bit too strong, and the addition of hot sauce was a great idea.   For me, it's somewhere between 3 and 4 stars;  with a bit more tweaking, I'm pretty sure I can make it even better.

I've made this recipe twice now. It forms a decent patty but there really isn't much flavor and it comes out fairly dry. The second time I used less oats, added some dried herbs and spices as well as a little vegetable broth. This gave it a little more moisture and flavor.
