This cake is SO SO YUMMY!! This was super easy and worth the in and out of the fridge. I didn't out coconut on half because of the non coconut lovers. I'll make it again. It makes a ton of servings because you can't eat a huge piece.

I made it exactly as written except for adding raspberries on top for decoration.  

Everyone loved it!  I will be making this again and again trying with all different kinds of fruit.

It turned out great. I made some changes though. I used Duncan Hines cake mix that called for egg whites.

Took this to a party and it was a hit! So good- I love coconut but since not everyone does I will leave it off half the cake next time. I used Smuckers seedless raspberry jam which seems less sweet than preserves. It'pretty sweet so may use less condensed milk or use real unsweetened whip cream.

Really sweet, but really good!  I used the Betty Crocker silver white cake recipe and used coconut extract instead of vanilla.
