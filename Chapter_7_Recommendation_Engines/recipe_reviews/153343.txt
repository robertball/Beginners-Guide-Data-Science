I made this cake for my mom's birthday and everyone loved it! I made a special lemon glaze to put between the cakes, and garnished it with chocolate-covered strawberries--yum!

Great cake. I made two of these, one for me and one for a BBQ. On the second one I used yellow cake mix and it was just as good as the original recipe. A perfect summer cake.

This is one of my all time fave cakes!  I always get rave reviews when I make it too.  I do use a lemon cake instead of white and bake it in a 9x13 just frosting the top instead of doing layers.

This has become my families favorite dessert and it has been requested by many our our friends and family members!  I also like to do this same cake concept except use other jello and pudding flavors.
