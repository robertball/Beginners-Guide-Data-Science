I had asked a "friend" for her fruitcake recipe.  She wouldn't give it to me because it was an "old family" recipe.  I decided to try this recipe because I have a chocolate pie recipe that begins with milk & marshmallows.  This is a truly easy recipe, just chop-chop.  I roasted my own pecans used the lemon juice instead of sherry.  It has a wonderful subtle orange flavor & we love it!  In fact, I like it better than the "old family" recipe.  Even people who don't particularly care for fruit cake, love this one.  GREAT RECIPE!
