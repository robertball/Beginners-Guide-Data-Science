Very tasty cupcakes.  For those worried, you can not taste the zucchini at all.  I did have to cook mine a little longer, but believe it is my oven.  Very good.  I will make again.

Pretty good.  I love raspberries and zucchini so it couldn't go wrong for me.  The raspberries didn't have to be fresh, frozen worked fine.  My frosting didn't turn out though so next time it may be 5 star for us.

These were great. They aren't quite chocolate-y enough for us, though. Next time I'll add about 50% more cocoa and chips. I made mini bread loaves with this too. They took about 40 min. to bake. A great recipe to use up the raspberries and zucchini in our freezer from last summer.

These are very good and a great way to get some healthy fruits & veggies in kids. I used 1 cup freshly ground white whole wheat, somewhere between 1/3 cup and 1/2 cup of cocoa,about 1.5 - 1.75 C frozen raspberries, and slightly lesss sugar & chocolate chips than called for. They don't need frosting, we're eating them as chocolate muffins. They'll be great tossed in lunchboxes. If frosted, I would go with maybe a sweetened whipped cream piped inside of them. The only downside is the raspberry seeds stuck in my teeth. Oh well! I will definitely make these again. Update: Made again, increasing the ww flour to 1/2, and replacing 1/2 C of the butter with plain greek yogurt. Also threw in a handful of old fashioned oats. They're great! I made mini muffins, cooking them 12 minutes. These will be regulars at our house.

I really liked these. And with zucchini season coming up, I'm always looking for recipes that incorporate it! (And I couldn't taste the zucchini at all, btw.) I didn't have any buttermilk, so I added a 1/2 T of vinegar to the milk, and let it stand a few minutes. It's a good substitution.

Sturdy but moist, not too sweet brownie-like cupcake studded with a delicious  combination of fresh raspberries and gooey chocolate chips in every bite. I completely forgot there was zucchini in them!  Taken to nirvana frosted with "Buttercream Icing" (flavored with almond extract) also from this site.  I tasted one "for rating and review purposes" and then I had to get me out of the kitchen...

Just made a batch of these to serve to hungry kids after swimming lessons tomorrow and they are SOOOOO good!  I increased the amount of cocoa to almost 1/2 a cup and the amount of raspberries to almost 2 cups (so there would be berries in each one).  I think there could have been less chocolate chips...3/4 a cup would have been plenty with everything else going on.  You can not taste the zuchinni at all but they are super moist.  I'm sure they would be great with some frosting or whipped cream but they are really more like a muffin than a cupcake and are excellent with no topping at all!

These cupcakes are wonderful. My kids loved them, moist and lots of flavor. I made a cream cheese frosting and a chocolate fudge frosting. The raspberries give this cupcake a great flavor along with the chocolate. quick tip for frosting... I used my electric cookie press and the decorating was done in no time! :D

Delicious cupcakes.  I know other reviewers have made this point as well, but you can't even tell there is zucchini in these cupcakes.  The chocolate raspberry combination is amazing.  I topped these with cream cheese frosting, which was the perfect compliment.  Perfectly moist, great flavor, wonderful cupcakes!

excellent recipe! absolutely delicious! not overwhelmingly chocolatey, just the right balance.  I substituted fat-free half-and-half for the buttermilk, and it was phenomenal! :)

Awesome! Everybody loved these. I used a medium size shred so the zucchini pieces wouldn't be too big and you definitely couldn't tell they were in there.  I increased both the raspberries (sliced in half) and chocolate chips.

Sorry but my family was not a fan. There was something that didn't work in the cupcake. I think it was a personal taste thing and not the recipe itself.  I thought my boys would woof them down but the cupcakes just sat on the counter.

I am the belle of the ball at work!  Moist, chocolatey, the raspberry twist.  I frosted with a small amount of cream cheese frosting but they are fine without.  A keeper, thank you for this.

Delicious!  I used whole wheat flour and doubled the cocoa powder.  Added a little extra milk since the resulting mixture was a bit dry. Oh and I used frozen raspberries.

Thank you for the recipe, the cupcakes turned out great.  I changed the recipe a little bit, I used brown sugar instead of white sugar, I used blueberries instead of raspberries. Really good.

These are PHEMINOMAL!!!  You can't taste the zucchini at all - even my very skeptical husband loved them.  A little dollop of whipped cream on top - and perfecto!  I WILL be making these again!

Very great flavor. Zucchini was undetectable. I used cream cheese frosting on top and boy was that a great thing to add! I like the idea of a healthier cupcake. I gave these to my Mom and Mom-in-law for Mother's Day.

Not bad. I added more cocoa because I wanted them to be really chocolatey. These were more like muffins than cupcakes. I just dusted them with icing sugar instead of frosting them.

I really wish I liked this recipe, but the truth is you can REALLY taste the zucchini. This cupcake is not very good.  It might taste good without the shredded zucchini.

Got some fresh garden raspberries. So I had to make something. This was one of two recipes I brought to work.
I wouldn't tell people about the zucchini ingredient until they tried them. They never knew, yet still said they like them.
The best part is the gooey from the chocolate chips.

I made half the recipe, not knowing if I would like it. I used silicone cupcake holders. They worked great. Once they cooled down a little, and the next day, they fell out of the holder and did not fall apart.

Excellent cake recipe! I didn't have muffin tins, so used a pie pan instead and baked at the same temperature for about 30 minutes. I also halved the recipe, but followed exactly except for one substitution of muscovado sugar for white caster (also, I'm fairly sure a higher amount of courgette made it into the batter and there were no complaints).

Dusted the top with icing sugar and decorated with my remaining fresh raspberries. Even the non-veg-eater went back for seconds!

Have made these twice in one week.  The fam loved them!  Made as directed and don't see any reason to change anything.  Chocolate and raspberries are a winning combination with the zucchini.  Really different and a nice change from the usual zucchini bread.  Use both a butter cream and cream cheese frosting and liked them both.  Any topping would work well.  They are good unfrosted, too!

Ths is a very moist cupcake recipe, however I did find it rather bland, so I drizzled chocolate over top and sprinkled toasted hazelnuts on top of the chocolate.  I will make this recipe again but I will increase the cocoa and add 1/2 tsp of salt.  Makes lots and a good way to use up your zucchini

Made these cupcakes for a bake sale for the Legion where my parents belong.  They sold as soon as I set the 4 packages down.  I have a bunch of frozen zucchini to use up and this is a wonderful recipe to do so.  They were very moist and the chocolate-raspberry combination was a great blend.  These will be made again in this house.  Thanks mkr for posting your recipe.

Delicious! After reading reviews, I made a few alterations. I substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour and used white flour for the rest; increased cocoa to a heaping 1/3 cup, and used 1 and 3/4 cups for both berries and chocolate chips. Also I used defrosted frozen berries. This made 3 trays. Taste great as is, without icing.

Amazing! By far the best cupcake I've had. Enjoyed by all! I did as others suggested by adding a bit more cocoa and chocolate chips.

The batter was pretty dry and as soon as I folded in the raspberries they smooshed and broke up :(  Still, they were good, and with some whipped cream on top, the kids unknowingly had zucchini for dessert!

Great even without icing. Reduced sugar a bit so not too sweet. Doubled the cocoa and subbed 1 c of whole wheat flour and used frozen raspberries so it took an extra 5 min. to bake.

I changed the Cocoa powder to 1/2 a cup as some other reviews suggested.  I also substituted 1/2  a cup of the all purpose flour with Oat flour. And I made them gluten free by substituting All purpose flour with Bob's Red Mill Gluten free Baking Flour cup by cup. They were awesome!!

These are SO YUMMY!  I made them just as the recipe says, except that I used frozen raspberries.  It was very hard to share, but I gave some to my inlaws because I got the zucchini from them, and my FIL requested more.  Cannot taste the zucchini at all.  This will be my first go-to zucchini recipe every year!

You will probably need about 2-3 medium-large zucchini to make two cups grated zucchini.

I absolutely love these cupcakes . I always use less sugar than any recipe calls for so reduced by 1/2 cup and learnt that the zucchini needs to be finely grated. My grater is too coarse. Taste is just fabulous! Decadent without being too sweet. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

We found these to be really good!  I baked them just as recipe was written, except I cut the recipe in half and used a 6 cakes muffin pan.  The only slight change I made, was preparing the zucchini.  I was afraid I wouldn't like the graded zucchini in the cake.  So, after grading it, I did 10-12 pulses in the processor, to make sure it was really fine. They turned out very soft, light and cake-like.  I will make these again, but, next time put in more raspberries and more chocolate chips in- so they really are more muffin-like.

Great cupcakes - added 1/4 teaspoon salt, just because all my other cake recipes call for it.  These are moist, tender and go great with buttercream frosting.  Thanks for sharing this.  I grow both zucchini and raspberries so this one is a keeper.

Other than the fact that they turned out kinda dry,  these tasted amazing! The chocolate flavoring in it was just about perfect, although adding a little extra cocoa or chocolate chips wouldn't hurt. I would definitely make these again.

I brought these to a family gathering because I had some fresh raspberries that needed to be used up. They were tasty, but a bit heavy and not quite a good balance between sugar, cocoa, and raspberries.

How serendipitous...my raspberries and zucchini were ready at the same time. I felt the batter was too thick for the tender raspberries so scooped half into cupcake pan and added raspberries in middle then finished off the top. A cream cheese frosting accented with sieved raspberries completed this wonderful dessert.

I made this recipe as stated, only I had to use frozen raspberries. I made it with thin icing layer of almond buttercream. The recipe is "ok" for me, nothing really wrong with it or anything that I think would improve it, but not really that great either. Probably personal preference. It took about twice as long to bake as the instructions indicated.

I liked this, but opted for double the raspberries and cocoa powder.  We added cream cheese frosting. My husband thought the first bite was a little tart going on sour, but my daughter and I loved them.

These got mixed reviews. Two people REALLY liked them, four people thought they were 'fine' - but mostly because the cream cheese frosting was sweet enough to make up for the sweetness that was lacking in the cupcakes themselves, and two people thought they were pretty awful.
They were more muffin-y rather than cupcake-y, which isn't a bad thing, they had the texture of carrot cake, which is to be expected, but I wasn't thrilled with the overall flavor. I thought they could have been sweeter and more chocolaty, they were a little bland and without the super sweet cream cheese frosting they would have been awful.
I probably won't make them again because both my husband and son disliked them and I don't know that I'm interested in tweaking the recipe to make it more to my liking.

They are delicious! I added extra fruit, and a little extra zucchini. The raspberries on top made it complete.

This muffin has unique ingredients but a delicious hit in taste!  My coworkers were all asking for the recipe - gonna make this one a classic in my recipe box.

Made these for my daughter-in-laws birthday and she loved them. I did substitute with whole wheat flour and added salt.

These are good, but not amazing.  Not all that chocolaty, and where's the frosting recipe?  I made mini cupcakes so I put one raspberry in the middle and melted the chocolate chips on top, which would be a wise decision if you want them like cupcakes and not muffins...  The raspberry center is a nice surprise when you bite into one, but the batter itself is not rich enough.  Definitely gonna try these again!

Yum!!!  Loved these!  Only changes I made was to use whole wheat flour instead of white and replaced the white sugar with raw cane sugar.  Will definitely be making these again!

The taste of these cupcakes was okay at best.  The appearance was disgusting.  Adding the raspberries was a mistake.  The chocolate chips made the taste more chocolatey, but it would have been better to add more cocoa than add the chocolate chips and change the texture of the cupcake.  I definitely would not make this again.

it was a very moist and chewy cupcake but I felt that it lacked chocolatey goodness and the raspberries were sort of lost in the batter (although I did use frozen ones instead).

I make these into mini cupcakes (4-5 dozen) for a crowd.  These are light, tasty, and pretty little treats.  Very easy to make too!

Made these this morning and they turned out FABULOUS!  A great way to use up an overage of zucchini from my garden as well as some fresh raspberries that I'd frozen.  I followed the recipe to a "T."  The only change I made was using white chocolate chips, as I had some from another recipe that were left over and I wanted to use them.  My kids LOVE these.  I'm sure I'll be making them again!  Thanks for a great recipe!
