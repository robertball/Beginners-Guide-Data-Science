I've been using this recipe for years but I always add a chopped green or red pepper and substitute the hot Rotel tomatoes since we like things a little spicier.  Sometimes I use chopped jalapenos instead of the green chilis for some added heat.  You can also use flour tortillas instead of corn and it's just as good, maybe even better since the corn tortillas can be a bit tough sometimes.  You can also substitute cream of celery soup which I often do when I don't have cream of chicken.  It's a very flexible recipe.  My family has enjoyed this recipe for years.

Easy, delicious, made a couple small changes due to lack of ingredients in pantry -- but came out great.  Served with Frito Scoops on the side.

This was VERY good... in fact before I could get a chance to plate everyone's dinner, my hungry husband grabbed a plate and I got a thumbs up. Now... the only critique I have is that  it should probably be cooked a little longer, or the onions should be cooked with the chicken because they weren't quite fully cooked when we ate them. The only variant I did from this recipe was sprinkle a small layer of cheese in between my layers (think lasagna) But a GREAT recipe that had my husband stuffing himself until he couldn't eat anymore, and I had 2 plates, myself!

I don't know what I expected, but, this was really good.  I didn't expect it to be that good.  Thanks.  I might cook the onions and mixture a little bit next time...but, there will definitely be a next time.

great for a go too King Ranch Chicken.  Easiest one I have made but taste as good as the Southern Living one I have been making for years that is a lot more involved!

This was amazing. We actually fought over the leftovers. I made exactly as stated above except I used some leftover thighs and legs that needed to be used. I also baked maybe ten minutes longer just because when I checked it wasn't yet bubbly and the cheese wasn't completely melted. I will be making again. The peppers in the tomatoes and also the can of them didn't add that much spice. It was just a mold heat.

I love this casserole but I felt like the amounts were off.  I use half that amount of chicken and more tortillas.  Kind of make it your own using these yummy ingredients.  I dont add the extra chilis

My mom made this occasionally and used tortilla chips instead for a crunchy effect which was great. Always have loved this dish!

I have made this several times and the only thing I do differently is I put my chicken breast in the crockpot and put it on high for 4 hours. I then shred it with a fork and then mix it with everything. Saves me time.

An old time favorite I have not cooked in years.  Little too spicy for my sensitive stomach so will cut back on the chiles and Rotel next time. One of the best things about this recipe is how easy it is to change ingredients around to suit your taste.

Yumm!  Made exactly as directed and was very good.  Next time I might leave out the corn tortillas and serve it with rice just to change it up.  Also, I think it will be awesome filling for a burrito tomorrow.

I make this but I do some modifications.  I use 4-5 chicken breasts, all cream of chicken soup, milk instead of broth, 3 cans of Rotel (I like it spicy) and I just layer 6 corn tortillas per layer without cutting into strips.   I usually use mild cheddar but sometimes mixtures of cheese too.

Followed the recipe and it was delicious.  I think time I would add a cup of chicken stock instead of the 1/2 cup recommended. All the liquid was absorbed and I found it to be a bit on the dry side. It had great flavor though.

Very disappointed with bland taste.  I would have thrown it out if I hadn't thought to use it to fill corn tortillas, add salsa, and eat it like chicken enchiladas.

Made this recipe tonight for the family and it was super easy. I used everything in the recipe minus the chopped onions and chopped peppers. We don't like food too spicy and my kids don't like chopped onions. But I did add onion powder to the mixture. Also, instead of using boneless chicken breasts, I used deboned rotisserie chicken. This recipe is good but I believe it you're going to make for more than 4 people, its best to use 2 rotisserie chickens. I was only able to do 2 layers in the pan with 1 rotisserie chicken. Otherwise, easy recipe! Will be making it again!

Can't go wrong with this recipe.  I did add a tsp of chili powder , otherwise followed it as written.   A rotisserie chicken made it simple.

The first time I made this I left out the extra can of chiles and it was spicy enough for us. The 2nd time I made it I used a cooked chicken I bought and changed the cheese to a Fiesta Blend. Both my mother and husband LOVED IT.

Delicious and straightforward. I seasoned the chicken with taco blend and added some of that to the onions, which I briefly cooked in the chicken fond along with some red bell pepper and corn. I subbed jarred jalapeños for the green chiles which worked fine. Don't like mushrooms so I used two cans of cream of chicken instead.
Serving with a dollop of sour cream and guacamole really elevated it. The chips stayed pretty crunchy so there's a nice texture.

Love this recipe! We will buy a rotisserie chicken from the store if we're on a time crunch then we always add fresh jalapeños for some spice! I also tend to only use 3/4 of the cream of mushroom and cream of chicken, so we can taste more of the fresh onion and jalapeño and it not be so soupy!

If you want a little extra spice, stir in about 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning

If you substitute flour tortillas for the corn, double the amount of tortillas you use. I made it last night and the tortillas had almost dissolved; however, the casserole has great flavor and I will be trying to make it again.

Looking for something different so I made this for dinner and family loved it.  It was easy to make, and leftovers are good.

It really was just so-so for us. I was expecting something pretty mind blowing based on the reviews, but I followed to a T. It held together well enough but it just wasn't all that flavorful for us.

Really good and very easy.  I sauted the onions/peppers/tomatoes in butter til brown and added leftover onions/peppers from last night's fajitas.  Also added a big dollop of cream cheese and a splash of beer (1/4 cup???).  Rather than tortillas I used pasta dumplings.  Soooooo good!  Making for a friend after her surgery but making enough for us, too!

I made this to recipe except that I used flour tortillas as that was what I had on hand. It was good but pretty runny. I think next time I'll drain the tomatoes and cut back on the chicken broth. I think I would like the taste better with corn tortillas, but my family prefers flour tortillas, so I suggest just using whatever tortillas you prefer. Good recipe though.
