This is very good with all the flavor of the high fat variations but much healthier.

I have been making this broccoli salad for years with Splenda and fat free mayo, I'm not a big raisin fan, instead I crumble turkey bacon in it! Fabulous...

This is so good! I add 5 strips of crumbled bacon for a little smoky flavor and a little added crunch.

This is one of my favorites to make for large family gatherings.  I like it because you can make it ahead.  It even taste better after it's had time to meld. My version adds bacon (2-3 slices) crumbled in it.  And I use balsamic vinegar.  Yum! (I know the bacon sounds weird...trust me, it's always fully eaten at every gathering I take this!!)

Excellent salad.  However, I find the amount of splenda is often too much for my taste.  Cut the Splenda down to 1 tbs and was great!  UMH! UMH!

This recipe turned out really great!!  I made it for a party I had over the weekend and it was the first bowl to be emptied!  I didn't have Splenda or cider vinegar, I used sugar and left out the vinegar.  I was worried at first that it wouldn't turn out very well, but it was great!!  I will make this again!!

This is awesome. I used Ranch Dressing in place of mayo for extra zip and added walnuts for more fiber. Next time I will omit raisins and replace with chopped apples. And I will definately double the recipe.

I had a store made version just like this and they had finely shredded cheddar cheese mixed in.  I will be making this recipe due to the lower calories.
