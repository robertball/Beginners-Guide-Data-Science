I made this recipe real close to how it's written, but I just did a turkey breast instead of the whole bird and I didn't have onion salt, so I used onion powder.   I had issues with the bird not getting up to temperature, which I'm almost positive was due to the tenting.   I seriously had this thing in the oven for 5 hours, the last 2 at 375.   3 1/2 hours in, I'm still at 125, so I raised to 375.   Took another hour to get to 140.   Finally at 4 1/2 hours, I pulled the tenting and it came up very quickly.   My oven temperature is right.   I have a couple thermometers inside (always) just to make sure my oven isn't lying to me.  Now normally, I would pull stars for a recipe so off on timing, but the taste and juiciness of the bird was so fantastic that I can't pull anything off.   I actually consider myself a bit of a turkey expert and I've never had one so nice before.   The flavor was unique and it was so juicy.   One more change I made was I didn't add 1/2 cup of butter every hour hour.   I did the initial 1/2 cup, another one about 1 1/2 hours in and then I basted a couple of times with the liquid in the pan.   If I was to make it again, I would stick with the onion powder vs. salt.   I would sub garlic powder for the salt, and perhaps use unsalted butter.   There is plenty of salt in the seasoning salt and the bacon to go around.   I will definitely be making again using slightly different baking techniques.

Wonderful recipe.  It was easy to follow and the turkey turned out perfect!  Plus, the gravy had a nice smokey flavor due to the bacon.  We will definitely be making it again.

This was my second time making this recipe for Thanksgiving. It was such a hit last year that family asked me to make it again.

22 pound turkey with 48 ounces of bacon basket-weaved and wrapped over the exterior. Basted every 30min with Kerry Gold butter for the first 3.5hrs and then with the drippings every 30-45min thereafter.

So moist and flavorful. The fresh herbs in the main cavity, mixing with the juices and basted over the turkey were delicious and smelled amazing. Can't recommend this enough. I'll be using this for years to come.

Very good. Not sure 320 is right. Took longer than expected.

Crowd pleaser! It was really impressive. The drippings are way greaser than turkey alone would be, so make sure to cut it with a lot of liquid when making gravy. I used an herb mix with lavender. It was like a giant French style turkey dinner. A meal to remember!
