I have been making this recipe for awhile, and have just gotten around to reviewing it.  Both my husband and I think it's fabulous!!  I use four large boneless chops, 2 cloves of garlic, and half chicken broth/ half white wine for the 3/4 cup broth.  I also usually substitute 2 tsp. cajun seasoning for the 2 tsp. paprika.  The sauce can be a bit tricky!  Make sure you definitely reduce the juices by half, when you remove the chops, or the sauce won't be thick enough.  Also, once stirring in the sour cream, do not allow the mixture to boil, or it will separate, and ruin the sauce.  Once done, I serve chops and sauce over hot, buttered noodles.  Scrumptious!!  Thanks for a great favorite in our house!

We loved this dish! I didn't seperate the onions/garlic from the chops - just sauted and simmered w/ them the whole time. Also - I too added a splash of white wine and used 3 bay leaves and added some crushed, dried rosemary.  These three additions alone added great flavor to the chops. Finally, I did need to add some cornstarch to the gravy so that it would thicken like we prefer - but no big deal. I was worried that my family would not be happy with a side dish of mashed potatoes two nights in a row BUT since I had this great gravy to pour over them: my family was very pleased. This is a great recipe Clyde - thanks for posting it!

Definitely an easy and yummy recipe!!  However, SOMETHING was missing (for me at least).  Instead of the two tsps. of paprika recommended, I added ONE tsp. of SMOKED paprikia.  Also, I used fat free sour cream although at the end of cooking the sauce, I added one heaping tspn. of cornstarch mixed with one tbsp. of water and added that mix to the sauce.  We absolutely LOVED the flavor.  Also, we DID simmer the porkchops for an hour because we like them fork tender.  WOW!!  Great recipe.  Thanks so much.

Preparing for the reveiw, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  While this was good, I expected more and the flavor of the paprkia through it off for me.  Perhaps more garlic, and less paprika next time I give it a try would enhance this dish.  However, this will be a "change of pace" recipe, but not one I will keep in my "go to" list of family favorites.

I have made this at least 50 times and it's a hit always, thanks - update - I have to add that IT IS IMPERATIVE that you reduce the juices in the pan to at least 1/2. Yummy as always - I've made it with chicken several times too!

This is a great recipe.  The sauce is perfect for both the meat and on noodles.  I didn't change anything and thought it was perfect.

i usually read reviews before i make a recipe but i didn't this time.  this recipe was exactly what i was looking for.  it was great. i literally licked the plate.  altered slightly, i used 5 garlic cloves and added fresh sliced mushrooms.  i also added a splash of white wine with 1 cup of chicken broth.  i simmered them for 1 hour. the chops were moist and the sauce was excellent.  i seasoned the chops with reese steak salt and freshly ground black pepper.  i'll make this again.

This recipe is great! The sauce was a hit and the pork chops came out so tender. The only changes I made were to sauté some mushrooms with the onion, garlic, and I only sautéed the pork chops for 45 minutes rather than an hour. I also used a whole can of chicken broth. Thanks for the post.

Our family of 5 loved this recipe.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and added more garlic and some fresh rosemary.  I also combined a little white wine with chicken and vege stock for the liquid.  As suggested if you let this sauce reduce it will dfinately be thick enough.  And the pork was so succulent and tender after simmering for an hour.  I served this with mashed potatoe and a fresh mixed salad.  (Typical Aussie hey).  Everyone loved this and I will definately make it again.  Thanks.

The sauce on these chops was awesome! I halved the recipe and used three thick boneless chops. The cooking time was also halved. I also used reduced fat sour cream! Very very good!

I seek out this recipe from time to time.  I struggle with the cut of chops, whether I should go thinner and bone-in.  I have used 1 inch boneless chops but the meat was tough.  I think bone-in would add some additional fat for the pork to simmer in.

Update: I had my estranged husband buy the ingredients -- and what did he buy?  Thick boneless chops!  I started the recipe and let him finish the sauce.  I doubled the ingredients for the sauce except for the sour cream.  I had the chops simmering on a bare simmer for 1 1/4 hours.

His comment when I asked how it turned out?

"Oh yeah, the pork shops were good, the sauce was thin however and the chops were a bit dry, actually just ate the last chop last night".

He could have added more sour cream perhaps or with a tablespoon of flour.

A recipe that is AWESOME! I have made this countless times for my family since receiving it in an email . I make Pleasant Pork Chops "as is" - no changes - and they are fantastic. If cooks are finding that their chops are too dry, try lowering the heat! I have cooked my pork chops  this way for years and as long as you have a tight fitting lid that does not allow for much evaporation, a little liquid, and use the lowest heat your stovetop has to offer, your chops will be moist and juicy every time!

I started making this for my family about six months ago.  My husband declared a "short-lister", meaning it's in his faves.  I've even changed it up by using chicken breasts instead of pork chops and we love it just the same.  On top of rice is our favorite, but we've also made it with mashed potatoes and on top of egg noodles.  Delicious each way!  UPDATE:  When using thicker, boneless chops, use a meat tenderizer, a mallet to pound them down just a bit, and simmer just a bit longer (maybe 10 minutes?) and they will be just as tender and juicy as the bone-in chops.

This was delicious! Thank you so much for sharing the recipe, Clyde! It is definitely going to be in my rotation. I made a few minor changes; sauteed the onions and 1 tbsp minced garlic in margarine then browned the pork chops (seasoned with garlic powder and pepper) on each side before adding 1 cup chicken stock and covering. I let everything simmer in the chicken stock for an hour before removing the chops to add the fat-free sour cream, paprika, pepper, a touch of garlic powder, a bit of crushed rosemary, and Old Bay as I didn't have Bay leaves. After mixing the sauce well, I put the chops back in the skillet and let simmer in the sauce while I mashed my cauliflower and prepared the veggies. My boyfriend came home and said that it smelled great, and upon taking one bite said, "you can definitely make this again! I'm impressed with this dish." Trust me, I can't wait to make it again, because it's healthy and delicious!

Pretty Dang good recipe. I would recommend making the changes that i made though. They were slight but i think they would make the difference. The first thing i thought when i read the recipe was "dry" pork. I went to go read the reviews and in fact a lot of people said the chops were dry. How do you fix? Easy just cook them less. I cooked mine for 35 minutes instead of an hour.

The next thing is the sauce is truely the star of this recipe. I can see using the sauce for other meats such as chicken. Anyways, this is defintely not one of those recipes were you want to use cheap paprika. Go for the gusto here and use some of the more pricey stuff. I used smoke variety but real hungarian paprika would probably also work out nicely. The paprika is one of the bases of the sauce that makes this dish taste so wonderful

Ok so this recipe was so delicious. I literally sat on here for 3 hours reading reviews because pork tends to turn out so dry or so tough. I was concerned because the author didn't mention how big the chops were that he used. I read through over 100 reviews and still felt unsure so after googling pork options I figured out what I would do. I buy my pork chops from costco and they are huge! So I took each one and pounded them down to about 3/4"-1". Then I seasoned them on both sides with Montreal Steak Seasoning. I had sauteed portobello mushrooms beforehand with minced garlic and onion powder (the bf can't stand onion texture). Set stove to almost high, dropped some butter in and seared on each side about 4-5 minutes. I added 1 1/2 cups broth and 1/2 cup white zin (out of white cooking wine). 3 bay leaves as other suggested and some crushed rosemary. If you put the stove on its lowest setting and have a tight fitting lid it's supposed to keep the pork super moist and tender....45 minutes later i checked them and they were done! Boiled the liquid & mushroom mixture down to half and turned off stove. Added 16 oz of light sour cream and 4 tsp paprika. My boyfriend and his fraternity brothers ate every bite. I served them with mashed potatoes and sugar snap peas. I had left overs today and they were even better than last night. The steak seasoning had really absorbed into the meat, making it taste just like a juicy steak! I made 6 pork chops and double the sauce which was perfect

Good, but not great. I had to thicken sauce with milk&flour, was very runny. Flavor was OK but not impressive. Pork was not as tender as I like. Overall, not highly impressed.

AFTER BROWNING THE CHOPS, I MADE THE SAUCE AND BAKED IN 9X13 PAN (POURING SAUCE OVER CHOPS) for 1hr covered with foil (@350)  and spinkled more paprika over chops for color and baked an additional 15min uncovered.

Very Tasty, BUT, I think this recipe could be made much faster by grilling or frying the chops until cooked, in the meantime making the sauce separately.  This would also save on time and electricity.  Thanks Clyde for a yummy sauce.

Tried this recipe and it came out fantastic.  We love beef stroganoff so the sauce was delicious.  The meat was moist.  I think to prevent it from drying out you need to always make sure you have plenty in the pan while simmering, to almost the top of the porkchops, almost poaching the chops.  That way they won't dry out.  I didn't have any chicken broth so I used chicken boullion and it came out a bit salty but that was my fault.  Not sure how the other reviews sauce came out like salsa.  When you saute the onions they have to be cut in rings, not chopped perhaps.  All around it was a bit hit with the family and I will definately be making it again and will make it with chicken as well.

I added extra garlic and used light sour cream.  Although this recipe is a tad time-consuming, the results were quite tasty and would be good on chicken as well as pork.

this was just ok. For such a long cook time I've found other recipes that are equally as good, if not better. My sauce didn't thicken but I think that was my fault (not enough time). Flavor combination was good though.

I am giving this 5 stars just for the sauce! It was so good! I did add rosemary and a splash of white wine. The pork chops were a little dry so next time (because there will definitely be a next time) I am going to cook the pork chops for a shorter period of time.  This is easy but tastes like you slaved for hours! My kinda recipe!

This was the best pork chops I have ever had! I just made it tonight. I wasn't expecting the wonderful flavor in the sauce, those caramelized onions and garlic really do the trick. The only change I made was no bay leaf (none on hand) and it was still great. I also let the broth simmer down quite a bit, so i think that intensified the flavor.  Will definitely add this to our family favorites.

I had never cooked anything w/ paprika before, wow, this was really, really good. I only had thin chops, so I combined the bay leaf and 1 cup chicken stock in a pot and boiled covered for 30 min. Then I poured it over the chops and cooked for 30 min. After reading the reviews that the sauce was runny, I made sure I boiled the stock to a 1/4 cup. It came out perfect, very tender. I am going to try this with chicken using white wine for the stock.  Thanks for the recipe.

I don't know what type of chops the OP intended (thin, thick, bone-in or not) but I used center cut rib chops, about 3/4 inch. I can't imagine cooking chops for an hour and even after 30 minutes or so they were tough and overcooked. The sauce was good although not something we raved about.

I struggled between giving this 3 and 4 stars, so I would truly rate it 3.5.  Three of those stars come from the chops - I always have a hard time with pork chops being too tough, and even with me using thin cut boneless chops I could cut them with a fork they were so tender.  I also really enjoyed the seasonning.  The sauce I did not like.  I followed the directions to a T, but had to make some major variations as the end result was, in my opinion, like slurping watery sour cream.  I added much more paprika than the recipe called for, a generous helping of black pepper, and about a teaspoon of tobasco to give it a bit of a kick which was perfect.  My husband said it was even better today, and he would certainly eat it again if I made it, but I'm not sure that I will.  The tenderness of the pork, A+, the sauce, D.

I was looking for a recipe for pork chops that didn't involve baking. This recipe was very easy to follow, and very tasty! I didn't remove the onion and garlic, I let them simmer with the chicken broth for an hour. They were so soft, my roommate couldn't even tell what was in the sauce. Also, I only made 2 pork chops but kept the same amount of liquid. I poured the sauce over pasta, and it was still only enough for the two of us. Also, I used smoked paprika and added mushrooms to the sauce about 25 minutes before it was done. My roommate and I ate every last drop.

This was very simple and delicious. I added a tablespoon or so of flour into my sour cream to thicken it. I also used smoked paprika for a little different taste. I will make this again. Thanks Clyde for the recipe.

My husband thinks the only way to prepare pork chops is to fry.  I showed him this recipe and ask him if I made it would he eat it and he finally said yes, but I could tell he thought it would not be good.  I made Pleasant Port Chops tonight and after he had several bites, he said several times during the meal, "everything is so good".  I did not add wine but I did take someone's advice and crushed some Rosemary into the onion/garlic mixture.  Next time, and I think I can safely say there will be a next time, I will not chop but slice the onions.  I think the presentation will be better and you will not have some overly browned bits of onion that can be so bitter.  Otherwise, I would not change this recipe.  It is quick, very yummy.  I used bone in Loin chops about 1 inch thick and they were so tender after 1 hour of simmering. For the person who thought it salty, check your broth and other ingredients before adding salt yourself. The Nutritional numbers are very good.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is my families favorite way to make pork chops.  I have made it twice now and I have not really altered the recipe.  I served it with brown rice instead of noodles this time.  My one comment is that I did not end up with alot of liquid to reduce..in fact I had to add liquid in it to make it not be so strong.

Probably the most tender pork chops I have ever had! I used 1.5-2 inch thick chops, and 1 hour was the perfect simmer time. I made 4 times the amount of sauce, a little too much... I think 2 times the amount would have been perfect.

My only change was more garlic and a dash of cayenne pepper while the chops were simmering.

Make sure you cook your broth down by at least half after you remove the chops. My sauce was a little thin, but cornstarch fixed it.

All in all a very tasty recipe that I will surely make again!

YUCK! YUCK! YUCK! This recipe took a long time to make and it wasn't worth the time and energy. The chops were like hockey pucks, the sourcream curdled, and the appearance of the sauce was gross! I won't make this again.

Family loved it!  I only had a 1/2 cup of sour cream so I used vanilla yogurt for the other 1/2 and it turned out a little sweet but still wonderful!  I also used corn starch to thicken the sauce.

This came out so so good! I pretty much followed the recipe exactly except for adding 1 teaspon of roasted garlic when I was sauteeing the onion and I used lowfat sourcream instead of regular. After I browned the porkchops I put the onions and garlic back in the pan and simmered it all together. The sauce is fantastic! Next time I am going to try grilling the porchops and doing the sauce by itself and pour over the top. This is definitely a new staple in my kitchen!

This has been an all time favorite in our home for years. It is easy to make and flavorful.  The suor cream make a nice sauce, but be srue to scrape up all the pan drippings and mix in well with the sour cream, this really enhanced the flavor. I often add mushrooms for a littel variety.

My kids are hard to get to eat anything new, and they loved it.  The sauce flavour is similar to The Keg's sauce on the Steak Oscar.  Can't wait to make it again!

This was wonderful!  However, my 8 yo said it was too spicy, I used the Montreal Steak seasoning on the pork chops, I think that may be the reason for the spicyness!

This was good; the pork chops were really tender, but the sauce was too salty.  Next time, I will use reduced sodium chicken broth!

This was delicious!  My family isn't crazy about onions, so I used a shallot instead and 2 large cloves of garlic.  I also reduced the butter a bit.  The sauce was excellent, and not salty at all.  I added a pinch of savory too.  I served it over noddles.  Everyone enjoyed this, so I will be making it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is perfect as it is but because I like to experiment when cooking I did the following: I added the paprika at the same time as salt & pepper. Along w/ the onions I also sautee red & green onions, orange bell peppers and spinach. After removing the excess fat from the browner pork chops I added back the onion mixture, light sour cream and half & half. Simmered it for a few minutes and Bon Appetite!!

The sauce is rich and delicious. I followed the recipe except that I was out of chicken broth so I substituted 1 tbsp of "Better that Bouillon" chicken base (the stuff is great to have on hand) and 1 1/2 cups of water. I also added 1 tsp of white pepper with the paprika. It takes awhile to prepare but it is well worth the wait.

Very good - used chicken, browned and kept warm, sauted onions and garlic, deglazed with broth, reduced and added sour cream. Great over noodles.

Loved it. Only change was I used meat seasoning that contained paprika rather than just plain. Also doubled the sauce and used over mashed potatoes too.

We enjoyed this, and the flavor was nice, but it didn't make enough sauce to pour oven noodles, which was a little dissappointing.  Husband said he'd eat it again.

Clyde, thank you for this recipe.  Yum, yum!  My hubby doesn't like sour cream so I used a little bit of brown food coloring to fool him.   I forgot to reduce juices to half, but in the end it turned out well as I sprinkled about a tablespoon of flour and wisked the sauce.  This recipe goes in my fav recipes book!

Pleasant is the perfect word for this recipe.  The pork chops are tender.  The gravy is tasty, but not bland or overpowering.  Served it over rice.  Perfect dinner and definitely a keeper!

Years ago I had a friend who made a dish very similar to this one and she refused to give me the recipe.  I have been looking for this ever since.  I only made one change because when I started making this I realized I was out of bay leaves.  So I added a little savory and thyme to replace the bay leaves.  Everyone loved the dish and this will be made often at our house.  Thanks for the recipe!

I am giving this a five, even though I did make some changes, and when I make it again, I will make some different changes - the concept was great!  My only problem was that the chops were a little tough, but I only had chops that were at least 1 inch thick - next time I will try thinner chops.  Otherwise the only changes I made were to use thinly sliced onions instead of chopped, and seasoned the chops with Creole seasoning (from this site), and then used about 1/2 tsp. smoked paprika at the end.  The flavor was absolutely wonderful - and easy enough to do for a weeknight meal.  I served this with garlic mashed potatoes (lovely with the sauce poured over), steamed sugar snap peas, and a salad of butter lettuce with the Maple-Balsamic Viniagrette from this site.  A memorable meal!

I was skeptical about making this after reading the first page of reviews, being a very finicky eater, however i did make them and was not sorry.  These chops are delicious.  For those of you who said they were bland and had no taste, you must not have taste buds!!.. The only different thing I did was add another clove of garlic otherwise I followed the recipe to the T.  Thanks for sharing this one !!!

I am sorry to say that we did not enjoy this at all ... pork was over cooked, and I only cooked it for 30 minutes as opposed to the hour indicated ... could not for the life of me get the sauce to thicken, and took previous reviewers advice to "liven" up the sauce with dismal results.  I might try it again, just as there were so many great reviews, but an overwhelming thumbs down tonight.

This made awesome chops!  I did use butterfly porkchops and didn't need to trim the fat but I did leave the onions in the pan for the entire hour that the meat cooked.  They were so tender that we didn't need a knife.  A big hit with my kids who are only 5 & 6.  Definitly a do again and again.

Excellent!  This is definitely one of the best tasting pork recipes I've prepared so far.  Instead of pork chops, I used pork tenderloin sliced one inch in thickness.  To make sure the pork was well cooked, I put it in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes rather than browning it in a skillet.  Following this cooking procedure took far less time than browning the pork in a skillet and reducing the 'sauciness' of the onion-garlic mixture in an hour as indicated in the instructions.  After the pork tenderloin was properly cooked in the oven, I poured the garlic-onion-sour cream mixture on top of the cooked pork tenderloin.  The garlic-onion-sour cream mixture turned out very tasty!  Next time , I may add finely chopped mushrooms to the garlic-onion mixture.  I will definitely make this delicious pork recipe again.  One final note: I was trying to prepare this meal for some time but wasn't able to.  The old motto 'good things come to those who wait' fits this recipe!  It's a definite winner, which, as mentioned, will definitely be prepared again by yours truly.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. I just simmered them for about 35 minutes and they turned out super-moist. Next time I will add mushrooms and more garlic to the sauce and cut back on the paprika.  The paprika was overpowering.  Definitely recommended, but do use a thick cut pork chop.

These were absolutely amazing. This sauce was so good that I wished I had something to eat more of it with, after my pork chop was all gone. Cooking so long and low assured the chops came out tender. The flavor of this sauce is amazing. Thanks for a great recipe. This one is a keeper, and will be laminated and put into my recipe box. :)

This was really great for some pork chops I had that were a little thicker than I normally get.  They came out so tender!  Everyone loved them.  Thanks!

I have to say that this is my absolute new favorite pork chop recipe.  I've tried so many new recipes and have been disappointed.  This is the keeper though!  The only thing I changed was adding some garlic and onion powder while browning, just for extra flavor.  My chops were about 1 1/2" thick and the hour cooking time was perfect.  Everyone, including the kids, ate as much as they could.  An absolute keeper for us!

Nice recipe. Remember to drain porkchops of all excess fat too reduce curdling sour cream. Very tasty!

This recipe is definitely easy!  I made it pretty much exactly as written.  The sauce is really nice - we had plenty, so we ended up putting it on top of the mashed potatoes we had with the dish.  I will definitely be making this again.

My hubby really liked these, but I had to modify the recipe a little. I didn't have enough sour cream so I supplemented with cream cheese.  I didn't have an onion so I used shallots.   A welcomed surprise.

I love this recipe. Although I made mine with sourcream and onion dip mix. I would recommed reducing the amount of salt you use because if not it can come out quite salty. Served with mashpotates this dish is sure to please

These were easy to make which is a plus.  I enjoyed the sauce as the paprika added a slightly smoky flavor.  I will try these again using chipolte instead.

These pork chops are FANTASTIC! We made them as directed with only a few small modifications. We left the onions in to allow them cook down into the sauce and we upped the chicken broth to a whole (regular sized) can. We ate them with baked potatoes, pouring the extra gravy on top (yum!). Next time we make them (and there WILL be a next time, very, very soon) we'll try them on top of egg noodles :P

Delicious. I made exactly according to recipes, except my skillet only held 5 pork chops. Served over pasta, but would be equally good on rice or mashed potatoes.

I followed the recipe quite closely but did make some minor changes. The pork chops turned out tender and juicy. I cooked the pork chops in the butter and garlic but not using onions. In addition I added salt, pepper, oregano, extra bay leaves and extra paprika to the gravy and made it to taste. Overall the dish was good but the gravy was not very thick.

This looks and sounds so good. And the sauce was quite good but the pork dried out. :( I even used bone-in chops...so it just didn't work out. Sorry. I would try this sauce again though with bone-in chicken which usually can stand up to such a long braising time.

I don't really care for pork chops but my husband does.  So I buy them.  I keep looking for ways to make them (aside from breaded and fried) that I can tolerate.  

I made these last night and I was pleasantly surprised.  I found them to be very tasty - even my daughter (she doesn't like pork chops either) said they were good.

Try to be patient enough to actually let the juices reduce by half before you put the onions back in for the sauce.  I didn't wait and the sauce turned out too thin - but still wonderfully tasty.

The sauce thickened upon cooling and I am using it today as a sandwhich spread instead of mayonnaise because the pork chops were gone and the sauce was too delicious to throw away!

This recipe is a keeper, thanks!

Pork chops is never my 'go to' meat for a meal, but feel obligated to make it once in awhile...when i do i'm always in search of something interesting to do with it...hence stumbled upon this recipe.  I read the reviews, modified the recipe for 2 chops, added 1/2 chicken broth 1/2 white wine (doubled for more sauce) and found the only paprika i had was smoked...still good and added to my will make again list.  Wish there was an option for 1/2 star - I would rate this about a 3.5.

You really have to like the flavor of paprika to like these pork chops.  I should have known better since I don't care for paprika but everything else sounded so good I thought I'd try it anyway.  The pork chops were so tender you didn't even need a knife I just wasn't crazy about the sauce.  My husband, son and son's friend liked them though.  I may try this recipe again only reduce the paprika.

This was a nice change to the usual chops - nothing out of this world but a good, solid, comfort food meal. Followed the suggestions of others and used wine and broth. Cooked for about 30 minutes and will probably increase it next time. Served with hot, buttered linguini.

My whole family LOVED this dish. And that is saying alot. The kids never really like any kind of sauce poured over anything, so this time I gave them all a little on the the side. All 3 went back to the skillet for more. Definate keeper!

AMAZING!!!!!! I had a really good recipe for pork chops that my family loved, But this one beat it by FAR!!!!! This is a new favorite! everyone loved it. I took one piece and cooked it in olive oil instead of butter, and left the sour cream out and put a little soy milk, and corn starch for my sister who can't have dairy, She liked it too! Everyone else liked the original!

This had good flavor complexity and I could really smell and taste the bay leaf.  My chops were a little thick so I simmered them for about an hour and a half, but they were dry.  If I make this again, I will either use thinner pork, or give myself more time, so that the meat can break down.  Served with egg noodles and peas.

We LOVED this recipe! Definitely a keeper! Followed pretty much as written.. although a used a whole can of chicken broth and didn't measure the sour cream. Also sprinkled a little flour in while whisking to help thicken it. Served with white rice. Very, very good!

This 5 star recipe had my family drooling!  Even my fussy husband who does not like to try new foods quickly responded with enthusiasim!  There are a few other ways that this recipe could be modified to suit your taste, such as the addition of rosemary or even more garlic.  I personally would not change this!  The sauce is beautiful and goes great with mini boiled potatoes and a veggie side dish.

This is an awesome recipe! I make ours with spiced up, extra thick pork chops. I cover the chops with pepper, Grill Mates spicy chicken and Grill Mates garlic and onion seasonings, then brown them. I scrape up all of the browned bits from the pork, make twice the sauce, and add white wine, a bay leaf, a dash of poultry seasoning, and a touch of lemon pepper seasoning. My husband loves this, as have the guests I've served it to. Good eats!

OK, first of all, I have to admit I did not follow it to the "T".  I went by other users suggestions and tips.  BUT, for the most part, I followed it pretty closely, but the chops turned out dry, probably because my stove top is weird.  BUT, I have to say, my daughter ate the sh** out of it and was LICKING the plate, and told me it was AWESOME.  She is 7, by the way.  She LOVED the sauce.  It was an overall hit and I just need to learn to cook the chops so they won't be dry.  It's an awesome recipe!!!

This is a great recipe, but I added my own twist to it.  I used 4 cloves of garlic instead of 1.  I added an additional onion also.  I added about 12 ounces of sliced mushrooms when I sauted the garlic and onions, because we like onions, garlic and mushrooms.  I used 1 can of chicken broth and about 3/4 cup of Marsala wine.  I simmered the pork chops with the onions mixture but did not cover it. After cooking for about an hour there is very little juice left, so I added sour cream and thined it out with about 1/4 cup or more of Marsala wine...It was absolutely delicious!  I served mine over garlic mashed potatoes that I added Italian seasoning to.  It was a great hit at home and work!

This was my first attempt at cooking pork chops. Ever!  I'm not much of a meat eater so I made these for my hubby. He LOVED them, but since he's overly concerned with the aesthetics of his food, he just couldn't get over the look of the sauce. He LOVED the pork chops, but next time I'll probably either leave out the sauce or try another recipe for sauce. Also, I didn't use a bay leaf but instead mixed some rosemary in with the paprika (as suggested in an earlier review). It gave the sauce a great flavor!

Great Basic Recipe. I used six boneless pork chops but didn't trim the fat since most pork now is rather lean. I took another cook's advise and added 1/2 cup of white wine (it will tenderize the pork). The sauce was a little bland so I added maybe a cup of chopped mushrooms and thickened it with tbs of cornstarch mixed with a bit of water. Nope. That's not it. So, then I added two tbs of Dijon mustard and a tsp or two of tarragon. Bingo! Tasted great. Just a note: I think it's great how we all take a recipe and tweek it here and there. It's how we learn from each other. So all those whiners out there...shut up.

This is a good recipe. I made a few changes really only do to cooking equiptment and the fact I didn't want the extra steps. First thing I changed was that I sliced the onions because of others complained of a salsa texture. I didn't remove the onions from the pan when I browned the chops, or drain the fat. I thought that would loose to much flavor. I added 1/4c cream, and 1/2c water to the broth b/c my pan was so big i was afraid I would not have enough liquid. Then I added the chops back in and "basted" every 10 minutes. I did have to add cornstarch but only because the extra liquid I added I am sure. The best part was b/c I did not remove the onions they got so soft and just melted into the sauce. MMMMM so good every one loved it. Besides the minor adjustments I made I will not make any more! I had to take another pic b/c the others did not do it justice...hope it gets accepted!

I had high hopes for this reciped but it didn't go over very well. Nobody really liked it much (husband, 5 & 2 year old).  I only cooked the pork for 30 minutes and it was tough.  I don't think it would have become more tender if I cooked it more, but I may be wrong.

This was excellent! This one's going on regular rotation! I made very slight changes: I went with a 75%/25% mixture of chicken broth and white wine. I warmed the mixture in the microzapper and let the bay leaf float in it. I used half butter and half bacon drippings to prevent burning. Quickly sweated the garlic and onion, spooned out from pan, leaving the flavored oils. I cooked the pork chops until an internal temp of 140 degrees (about 10 minutes), plated, and covered with foil and a towel while I finished the sauce. Then deglazed the pan with the broth mixture. Put the garlic mix back in and added the spices. I did reduce the amount of paprika to about 1/2 tsp, added the salt & pepper to taste at this point, added a big pinch of cayenne. Let it reduce, cooled, added the sour cream and served over mashed potatoes. Oh yeah, mashed potatoes are required! You don't want to lose all that sauce! Thanks for offering it to us!

I made these tonight and everyone loved them.  My husband ate a ton of it and it was the first time my 2 year old has eaten pork.  We had them with mashed potatoes and the extra "gravy" worked well on them.

This was pretty good... loved the chops, but I thought the sauce was missing something. I left the garlic and butter mixture in the pan and browned the chops in it to allow them to really absorb the flavor. The pork chops tasted great. I thought the sauce would have more flavor than it did... I think the sour cream really dulled all the spices down. Served over white rice. Thanks :)

Wow, I had no idea that these would be so tasty!  I didn't change anything in the recipe and it turned out great.  My picky boys and husband loved it and keep asking me to make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not big on pork chops, but I & my family LOVE this recipe! Even the picky 6 yro. Really good & easy. Only change I made was using onion beef soup instead of onions & chicken broth, and more garlic, we love garlic. I always make sure I grab the ingredients when I'm at the store, that's how often we eat it, LOL Thanks for sharing =O)

This was so darn good!  I doubled it for my family of 6 and only had two chops left!  Yummy, this recipe is going into my weekly rotation.  I can't wait to try it out on company.  I'm making myself hungry just thinking about it.  Thank you so much for sharing!

This was delicious! I used thick-cut boneless chops and rubbed them with powdered sage along with the salt & pepper. The sage definitely gives it wonderful depth of flavor. Hubby and picky dad absolutely loved it. Very tender and tasty. THANKS for the 'keeper' recipe!!!

Great Sauce - I intend to try this recipe for chicken, and I think the basic idea would be awesome with salmon.  Definitely making it to my recipe collection.

This was very simple to make and the whole family loved - both my nine year old and six year old asked for more. I made a delicious rice and peas with it and used the sauce as gravy - I must say, it was DELICIOUS.

Awesome!!  What a great sauce.  I am not the biggest fan of pork chops but my husband loves them, so I have been trying to find a good sauce to serve them with to make them edible for myself.  Well this was a great sauce.  I did change a couple things though.  Along with the garlic and onions I added mushrooms, which was a great accompaniment.  Highly recommend some cremini's.  Also I did not find it needed the full hour to simmer.  I cooked them for about an hour including the browning time and found that to be perfect.  Great flavor and lots of yummy sauce.  My kids loved it as well.  Way better than opening a can of cream of mushroom soup.

I really liked this recipe.  I did't have any chicken broth so I used beef broth.  I also used 1/2 onion (I am not a big fan of onion), added 1 finely chopped celery stalk, and increased the garlic to 2 cloves .  I gave 4 stars because my husband thought it was bitter (this may be due to the changes I made).  I will make this again

Truthfully, I found this receipe to be "pleasant," indeed, but a little on the bland side.  That being said, it gets 4 stars because hubby and kids loved it.  I will try it again and perhaps figure out how to spice it up a bit.

i have made this recipe several times, always to great reviews.  it even seems like when i use the cheapest cut of chops it is better.  the meat falls off the bone.  the sauce is excellent.  i add sliced mushrooms and chopped fresh parsley and extra sour cream and broth.  sometimes i use a little white wine.  i use very little sea salt on chops or the sauce is a little too salty.  no matter how i've made it, it is always great.  best pork chops ever.

I used thick chops, about 1 inch to 1 1/4 thick.  Cooked 50 minutes + and they turned out very tender.  I used the suggestion of other reviewers and added 1/2 cup of red wine to the stock as I did not have white.  Worked very nicely and I would not hesitate to use white wine next time.  The taste was very nice over rice with green salad.  If I want more of a kick next time I might add horseradish or red pepper flakes.  But this is an excellent base recipe that I will definitely use again.  Thanks for sharing Clyde.

This dish was good but I just don't think that i will add this to the regular rotation.  Perhaps it's just my tastebuds but the sour cream with the onion sauce just didn't really do it for me.

We thought these were really good. Simmered chops for only 40 minutes though, must depend on the thickness of your chop and also how much you brown them beforehand.
In reply to Patience98's inquiry about what it means to reduce sauce by half it means to let the sauce simmer until the amount of sauce in the pan is about half of what it was when you started simmering it. This tends to not only thicken the juices but also intensifies the flavor.  I hope this helps.  Ty for the great recipe Clyde!

This was AWESOME.  I left the onions in the whole time.  Used thick boneless chops and they only took 35 minutes, so watch the cook time or they could dry out. Delicious!

This was a nice change from the same ol' pork chops. Plus it was great not having to use the oven. I did have to add more chicken broth as it cooked down, but that was the only change. It's a good choice for a low-carb diet, and if you wanted to, you could reduce the carbs even further by using onion powder instead of onions.

I am so glad I found this recipe.  It is fantastic.    I followed the advice of others and cooked the onions and garlic with the pork chops.  I also added 1/2 tsp of Rosemary for even better flavor.  Watch the time on these.  I used bonesless chops and 1 hour was too long.  I highly recommend.  This will be a regular with us.

I doubled water, sour cream and paprika and served the additional
sauce over rice.   My kids could not get enough!  No knives are necessary,
the pork chops cut with a fork and are moist and delicious.  A little long on
cooking time... but worth the wait.  We will definitely be preparing this again!

I have been making this recipe incorrectly for years. I've never had the time for the 1 hour simmer, I never have bay leaves, and I also always mess up the sauce.  I don't think I've ever NOT separated it!  LOL - Regardless of my blatant disregard for following directions, my family LOVES this recipe.  I've used it for pork chops and chicken and the flavor is just right for my picky eaters.  One day I will make it according to the directions and I'm positive it will be even awesomer!  LOL

Mine turned out "pleasant" but not great. I left my pork chops in for 40 minutes and they were dry. I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce either.

I've used this recipe for years. One of my husbands favs. Though I've never been able to reduce the chicken broth enough to not make it soupy when mixed w sour cream and such. I've had to use not as much broth as required or recommended but that's me :-D This recipe overall ROCKS

I did omit the bay leaf, add mushrooms, and only cooked 3 chops. It was a hit! My step-daughter- who does not like pork chops- ate all of hers and was picking at any other bits she could get her hands on.

As written this provided moist but flavorless pork and a bland sauce.  Some changes bumped it up to a solid 3+ but it could definitely have benefited for a marinade on the pork and a more flavorful simmering liquid.  I added 3 Tbsp sriracha, 1 Tbsp onion powder, 2 tsp black pepper, and 1/2 tsp salt to the sauce.  Next time would add another half of an onion and 8 oz of sliced mushrooms to the onion and garlic mixture.

This recipe works really well. I had to modify because I was out of onion and paprika. I basically just left it out. They turned out really tasty and the whole family thought they were great. I will definitely use his recipe again

Maybe I was expecting more based on the reviews. Doubled the sauce and added 5 oz of white wine to chicken stock. Also added about 1T fresh rosemary. Served with baked potato and salad. My wife and I thught it was OK, but not likely to make again.

I followed suggestions to include mushrooms & half white wine/half chicken broth.  Everyone absolutely loved it.  This would be perfect when there's company for dinner - Elegant & delicious with a minimum of time spent "fussing" in the kitchen!

Lucky college room mates!  This is my first review!  I rubbed the boneless pork chops with a salt/pepper mixture before browning.  Also doubled the amount of chicken broth to get more sauce which necessitated thickening it.  Instead of regular paprika just used one teaspoon Hot Hungarian Paprika.  Served with mashed potatoes.  This family of 4 loved it!

This is an awesome recipe. I also added wine, but had no chicken stock, thus using a vegetable stock with great results.  I also added 1 tsp (approx) of fresh chopped rosemary and 3 bay leaves. I prefer bone in chops as th bones add lots of flavor. Just like when making other sauces that add sour cream at the last, simmer the sauce down to a thick reduction and then when you add your sour cream your sauce will be of perfect consistancy!! A brown rice mix with this sauce is amazing! Will be making this again!

This was so easy and tasted great....Used recipe as written. No bay leaf in house so I omitted. Also after reading reviews reduced cooking time on chops from 1 hr to 40 minutes.

This is a truly great dish. I just made this for sunday dinner and got many compliments. Mine came out very tender and juicy. You really don't have to let it cook for an hour, maybe about 30-35 min so it wont dry out.

This was very good. The pork chops were moist and sauce had a good flavor. I ended up sauteing the onions and garlic, then just leaving it in the pan while the pork chops cooked. Will make again.

Very good recipe!!  Chops came out extremely tender and tasty (and my chops were thin).  I'm always afraid to try pork chop recipes for fear that they will be hard and dry but this recipe is a keeper for sure!  Even my husband loved it and he knows I'm not the best cook :)  Thanks for posting!

I LOVE this recipe. I have made it a number of times but never messed with original recipe because I didn't think it was possible for it to be any more perfect. However, last night I thought I'd try the recommendation of 1/2 broth and 1/2 white wine just to see. Wow!!! Soooooo good!

I thought I thawed pork chops but it turned out to be a small pork roast.  I went ahead with the recipe, using smoked paprika and a few shakes of Tony Cachera's seasoning.  Heavenly!

Quick after work meal at the end of a stressful week.   I followed the advice of whoever said you can cook the meat and onions at the same time. I put my two chops in one side of the big skillet and the onions in the other side. Worked perfectly.  It was over 100F degrees in L.A. so I didn't have the patience to let the meat brown properly, but it didn't matter.  I cooked on low for an hour as instructed which gave me time to make my smashed potatoes and brussel sprouts.  At the end of the hour I removed the meat, added 1/4c sherry and then boiled it for 5-7 minutes to reduce the liquid.   Turn off the heat and wait til it stops boiling and then stir in the sourcream for best results.  I was worried because I forgot to drain the grease after cooking the meat & onions but it still turned out great and not greasy. Whew!  I will definitely make this again with pork or chicken. Delicious! I'm glad there is leftovers for lunch.   Oh! And even though I only had 2 chops I made the full recipe for the sauce since I had those smashed potatoes.

This was a hit with the entire family.  I cut down on the butter by 1 Tbl, and left out the paprika because I was out of it.  WOW!  Everyone really loved these.  They were fork tender and the sauce was great.  This has been added to our favorites recipe binder.

Very good!  I seasoned the chops with Ms. Dash Table Blend.  Also, made it one pot meal by adding potatoes cut in half to cook along with the chops.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly as it is however used 2 chops instead of 6.  I added the cooked chops to the sauce and cooked them for a further 2/3 minutes.  Served these with a simple salad (lettuce, cherry tomatoes and sweet corn) and garlic mashed potatoes. Tasted great and will make again

The only change I made was to add red curry paste to the sauce instead of paprika. WOW!

These pork chops always come out so incredibly moist and delicious! The only thing I change is upping the garlic to two cloves and adding Cajun seasoning in stead of paprika if I have it on hand. Also I usually use only four chops, without reducing the amount of sauce - there's never a drop left!

I was so disapointed after all the great reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly and even added a little more garlic, but it was extremely bland. Maybe my paprika was old and lacking flavor, but I dont' think so.  Presentation was nice, and it might be good for families with small children who turn their noses up at any strong flavor, but I won't fix this again for my family. Sorry

This was very good.  I used reduced fat sour cream and fat free chicken broth, and it still turned out tasty.  I had to add some corn starch to thicken the sauce some.  I used bone-in chops, and did simmer it for the hour, and they were very tender...not at all dry.

Family favorite! My kids jump up and down when they see me making it. I don't really change anything. I use olive oil instead of butter and fat free sour cream. I put it on wide egg noodles and broccoli. Doesn't get any better.

This was a pretty good recipe. My pork never turned out to be that tender. The chops really shrunk when cooked. The sauce was good. I added mushrooms to the onions in the beginning and also added white wine to the chicken broth. The sauce was tasty, but the pork chops themselves was not great. I served with wheat pasta and corn on the cob. Great dinner thanks!

I was so excited to try this recipe with the awesome reviews, but was very disappointed with the sauce.  It was bland and my whole family complained about it.  I even went over the directions again to see if I made a mistake.  I will not make again.

This could be just me, but I wasn't sure what kind/cut of pork chops the recipe calls for. I personally used boneless center cut chops and there's no way I needed to cook those for a whole hour. In fact, I cooked them to 160 degrees which took about 10 minutes! So I suggest you carefully watch the temperature so you don't overcook. I agree with another reviewer who brines their chops. It works! I do this EVERY time I make pork chops.  This recipe is really great! The only thing I had to change was the bay leaf, as I didn't have any. So I threw in a pinch of sage and rosemary. Thanks for sharing!

I made these for my husband and I for dinner the other night and they were just ok.  The flavor of sour cream was very strong (I would recommend cutting down on this ingredient).  I found that porkchops cooked in golden mushroom soup have more flavor and are less of a pain (not that these are a pain to make, but what's easier than dumping a can of soup on some chops?)

Not good.  The paprika was overwhelming.  If I were to make this again, I would leave it out completely.  I didn't use any of the "fancier" paprika's that are out there, but I suspect if this recipe was originally developed by a bachelor a while back, I am thinking he used the run of the mill type paprika as well. I was pleased as I was making it because the sauce was rich and yummy and was looking forward to a tasty meal.  As soon as I added the paprika though, it was, well.....really bad (to keep it polite).

Very nice!  To keep the pork from drying (I used inch-thick tenderloins), I cooked them until inside temp reached 160 degrees, then removed them to a plate.   Also, I used half butter, half x-virgin olive oil to up the heart health factor.  Don't omit the butter, though.  Adds a nice flavour and keeps the oil from smoking at high temps.

We have made these twice. I thought that they were a little salty, but my hubby loved them. We are not a big fan of pork chops usually, but these have a unique flavor and they kept their moisture. I guess that I would make them again if requested...

This was excellent. I followed the directions up to the point of simmering the pork chops in the chicken broth for an hour. At that point all of the broth was gone even though I covered the pan. I almost decided not to make the sauce at this point because I was afraid I would mess up the recipe for it. But I decided to measure out 1/4 cup of broth and added the paprika, onion/garlic, and sour cream. It was awesome. The sauce leaves a very pleasant after-taste in your mouth.

This was very good.  I discovered after I started the chops that I was out of sour cream, so I faked it with some evaporated milk, corn starch, and some extra seasoning.  Will definitely try again with the sour cream, though, as it was still a touch bland.  My pork chops didn't come out as tender as some folks are reporting; only thing I can think of is that might were still almost frozen when I started.  The family finished it off with no complaints though, so we'll use again!

Great recipe, loved the flavor but the color was very white. Next time I will make sure to brown the chops so that the sauce will have more appealing golden color

I always have high hopes for creamy meat recipies like this one. This was okay for a change. It was nice to not use a condensed soup. I didn't hear any complaints and someone who hates sour cream said "This is not half bad". I doubt I will make this again but thank you Clyde.

This was sooo good! I used med thickness bone-in chops so I only cooked them about 30 minutes. I also followed tips from other reviewers and used some white wine in the simmering liquid. I didn't have any paprika so I used some rosemary and thyme and it was fabulous. I will definately make this again!

I am not a fan of pork chops so in desperation I went searching for a recipe that would help them go down a bit easier. I chose this one mainly because it looked easy and I had the ingredients. It was REALLY good! Very nice gravy and even my 4 year old ate it. I'd definately cook it again.

I was happy to find a creamy pork chop recipe without condensed soup in it.

I used half white cooking wine, and kept the onions in to cook with the chops, but other than that did exactly as recipe instructed.
Delicious.  The sauce is TO DIE for.

my first thought was just another boring pork chop recipe - not so - this was very...Pleasant - as described. I doubled the sauce as others stated and used sea salt for the the salt and it was very good - I really enjoyed it - my husband said it was good and my boys said no way - they are 3 and 4 though - they dont like alot right now - give it a try - I think alot of you will enjoy it.

Yummy.  Best chops ever.  I did make a small change.  To utilize the time that I had in the early afternoon, I prepared the food up to the point of cooking on low.  I then transfered the whole thing to the crock pot on low for 4 hours.  I left the meat in the pot on warm while preparing the sauce.  Turned out great with very little work at dinner time.

Absolutely Fabulous!!  My Hubby's only complaint was I cut the recipe down and there were no leftovers.  Next time I'll make the full 6 servings.  I too used Smoked Paprika and it really put this one over the top. I served some of the sauce over homemade mashed red potatoes. Delish... Clyde, Thanks so much for sharing!!

This was terrific, I thought I was eating in a restaurant! I did follow the advice of some other reviewers, 3 bay leaves, put back in the onion and garlic to cook with the pork chops.  Also, I thickend with cornstarch and chicken broth before adding sour cream! It was the best, we loved it!  Thanks for sharing, and my son is going to take the recipe back to his roommates at school to make it for them also. ;)

I was never a big fan of pork chops-until I found this recipe. Yum! I did use thin cut chops-so they were ready in 15 minutes and substituted Cajun Seasoning for the paprika. I just tweeked with the sauce until it reached our desired consistancy. Thanks for sharing such a tasty recipe. My husband is already asking when we will have it again.

very good recipe.  We did make a couple of changes.  We didn't have Paprika, so we used Marjoriam and Rosemary.  It turned out great.  We used the gravy for our mashed potatoes too.  Will make again for sure

The concept of this recipe is great. However, it needs major surgery to make this work.  The onion was overpowering; it was the only flavor that we tasted.  I would suggest cutting the onion in half, increasing the garlic, and adding some extra spices.  As is, I would never make this recipe again, but with some modifications, it would be quite tasty.

This took too long and while the chops were very tender the gravy didn't taste right- too sour or something. My family liked it but I won't make it again unless they request. Sorry..

Wow- this recipe was really so good. I used thin pork chops, so only left them in simmering for about 1/2 hour. I followed the advice of others to double the sauce and leave the onions cooking with the pork chops. We had lots of sauce but it was delicious. I also added 1/2 tsp. of cayenne and some fresh parsley to the sauce and it was great. Thanks!

I substituted some chicken broth with white wine and added a squeeze of dijon mustard.  I cooked the onion & garlic with the chops. The flavor was very tasty but the meat was TOUGH.  I should have followed a previous reviewer's advice and checked them sooner.  Maybe the sirloin chops I bought were too lean.  Either way, they were quite dry.

EXCELLENT LOW CARB RECIPE!!!!  And I usually don't like pork chops. I followed directions exactly - except used only 4 chops - we like a lot of sauce. We served with side of shredded brussel sprouts fried in a little butter. Would be good with noodles and/or brown rice too.

I found this recipe on this site years ago, and have been making it ever since!  I use extra thick chops and it's fantastic!  The only changes I make are to add 1/2 white wine, 1/2 chicken broth instead of the whole 3/4 cup broth for extra flavor.  Also I usually use a cajun seasoning blend instead of paprika.  Be sure not to boil the sauce after adding the sour cream-once it separates, it's ruined.  I serve over cooked noodles.  Very yummy!

These smelled so good while cooking. I did season the chops with seasoning salt instead of salt and pepper and they turned out very nice. The sauce went well with mashed potatoes.

This was a great recipe. 

I took the advice of others, in that when I simmered the pork I kept the onion mixture in it. I also added more garlic since there were some reviews that the sauce was bland. It came out perfectly. 

I also only had to cook 5 one inch chops for 15 minutes. The longer time would of made them tough. I too added TBSP flour to thicken the sauce, it was just right consistency.

I would suggest to anyone who makes this to check your pork after 15 minutes. Then every 5 to 10 after that, that way you wont have dried out pork.

Very simple recipe. It was quick and I had all the ingredients on hand.

I will be making this again!

Tasty and something different to do with pork chops.  The sauce is quite good with creamed potatoes.  Found the quantities to be right on. We added sauteed mushrooms and liked the outcome. Will try again and test variations to make this recipe really delicious.

We loved this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It is a bit time consuming to make, but the flavour is worth it. The only thing I would do differently is buy thicker pork chops next time.  They weren't as tender as some other reviewers have mentioned.  I served this with egg noodles on the side, covered in the sauce.  Excellent!  I will make this again.

Loved it! Did add rosemary to the chops and 2 bay leaves- but other than that- no changes. Very good- well reveived by my husband and 2 young boys.

I would have to say that I loved this recipe! I made it to take over to my grandparent in-law's house for dinner and my grandma kept saying how good it was because she, in her old age, doesn't like to taste plain old meat. The only issue I had was in thickening up the sauce, but no big deal. I will definatly be making this again.

I was disappointed after reading all the rave reviews.  The cook time is much too long, I had to cook them a lot less.  The sauce wasn't really that great and was definitely missing something.  Had to encourage kids to even eat this stuff because I didn't want it to go to waste.  Will not make again, or perhaps will alter it to make it more flavorful and delicious.

These were OK.  I tried to save time and cook these faster than the time suggested, which may have contributed to my results.  I think I will try this recipe again only using pork tenderloin and cooking it in the crockpot.  Overall I thought the sauce was a little too rich for me though.

My family really like this recipe :) I added a little Worcheshire sauce (3-4 splashes) and sprinkled a little flour to thicken the sauce. Worked out great. The chops were a little dry though. But all in all the flavor was excellent.

I made this just as the recipe said and it was very good.  A nice change from plain old pork chops.  The chops were tasty even without the sauce and very tender.  I thought the sauce added just the right touch.  I'll definitely make this again.

Not crazy about this recipe. I used thick center cut boneless pork chops which dried out. I added onion salt instead of regular salt and added mushrooms but the sauce is kind of bland.

My husband and I love this recipe!  It is so good just the way it is!!  Even so, for a little change, sometimes, for a little added flavor, I use beef buillon powder with a little water instead of chicken broth, and I add a little flour to thicken it up!  This is an awesome recipe that's really simple! I had a problem with the chops coming out a little tough, so I just cooked them for about 15-30 minutes less than and hour, depending on the thickness!  A++

This was a pretty good recipe.  My finance liked it a lot.  I modified the recipe by adding mushrooms to the sauteed onion and garlic and stretching the sauce out with some milk.  The sour cream by itself was to creamy.  I also would recommend you add more chicken broth to simmer the chops in because mine almost all evaporated in less than half the simmering time!

This was very good, I sauteed some fresh sliced mushrooms along with the onions and garlic. Instead of pouring the sauce over the chops I slid them back into it while it was warming. I will definately make them again...thanks.

My pork chops did not turn out as tender as usual so I will have to adjust cooking times or something.  Minor stuff --the FLAVOR in this recipe is to die for!  I used 1 t. chicken soup base nuked with the 3/4 c. water for the chicken broth.  Hub thought that I should either dice or chunk the onions next time for a smoother texture.  I agree with dicing them.  This sauce was so good that it wasn't nearly enough!  Will make much more (4 times?) next time for putting over noodles.  Can't say enough about the flavor of this recipe.  I even had cravings for it and had to get up in the middle of the night for it plus breakfast.  Thanks for this keeper!  P.S.  I did not cook down to reduce the sauce, either (no surprise there!)

My husband and I make this often.  We might add a little more garlic or a little more onion, but either way, it's great.  We do double the sauce as we like sauce (any sauce) over everything! :)

this was a very fast and easy recipe. The only problem was the cooking time was MUCH too long. I had converted the recipe for 2 pork chops instead of 6, but the cooking time was still much too long, and the chops were very much over cooked. 
The sauce on the other hand was phenominal! I made rice with this dish, and the sauce went very well over the rice and on top of the asparagus... It's a very versatile sauce, with a very sweet, creamy, neutral taste. I would definitely make the sauce again, but maybe not the chops.

These pork chops were pleasant enough, but I would definitely cut back on the paprika next time.  I used very thick boneless chops and they were very tender.  I would also use more broth next time because there wasn't enough sauce.

This recipe is excellent! My husband loved it, so did our kids! Next time I will use less salt on the chops when browning, my sauce ended up just a little too salty. I read other reviews that said thier chops were dry, they must have fully cooked them when all they had to do was brown them. Mine were juicy and falling off of the bone! I also omitted the bay leaf since I dont have any and substituted ground sage instead with my 1 whole cup of chicken stock. I will certainly make this recipe again and again!

I absolutly loves this recipe. I love garlic & the garlic with the onion,chicken broth & other seasonings were aewsome together. It smelled wonderful,but if you use boneless mini porkchops I would only cook them for about 15 to 20 minutes on each side over low heat or they may dry out. Thanks for such an amaxing recipe.

This was pretty good....as others have stated the sauce turned out a little bit thin, but was tasty.   Might try this as a pork stroganoff recipe by browning some ground pork, putting in the sauce and serving over noodles.   I wonder if I baked the pork chops in the sauce instead of simmering them in the chicken broth would the sauce wind up a bit thicker.    We enjoyed the meal at any rate.   Thanks a bunch.

My pork chops were very dry after cooking only 40 minutes and they were almost 2" thick.  I will try this recipe again because I did like the sauce a lot.  I served with steamed green beans and red potatoes.

This was really good.  I only used a tsp of paprika because I had a 2 year old eating it but it still had plenty of flavor.  I put the chops back in with the sour cream mixture and let them simmer for about 10 minutes.  My pork chops were moist and not at all dry.  Made a good gravy to go with mashed potatoes.

The aroma of this recipe made our mouths water however it tasted horrible. I followed this recipe to the T and even added some of the suggested spices posted by others. I gave it a two star rating for the aroma. Im so sorry!

Amazing!  This recipe has restored my faith in pork.  I was blown away at how easy it was to make.  The sauce wasn't as thick as I would have liked, but I adored the creamy flavor.  Just make sure you allow enough time for the sour cream to fully melt in the pan, or else you'll end up with white lumps.  I bet this same sauce would also taste great on fish and potatoes.

I agree with other reviews that the meat got dry. However, I also agree that the sauce more then makes up for it. I only cooked the chops about 30 minutes and just added the liquid still left in skillet to the sourcream sauce. I also added about 2 TBS of flour to thicken sauce. Very good. My whole family enjoyed it. If someone could come up with a way so that the chops weren't so dry I'd change my review to a 5 for sure.

These pork chops were good, but the sauce is what really made them. Make sure (as the others say) to but the thick pork chops...also make sure to follow the directions perfectly..I completely messed up - didn't follow anything and they STILL came out good.
You will want to add extra broth while they cook...I noticed that mine were dry.With that in mind, I smothered them in the sauce. I would add extra paparika...and if you like spicy food - add extra pepper or some red flakes to give it a kick. Otherwise you might find it a little dull.

I am not a big pork chop fan, but had picked some thin p. chops up at the store because they were on sale. This recipe worked fine for us, not an all time favorite meal, but I will be using this recipe for pork chops from here on out. I added mushrooms and green pepper along with the onions though. And I didn't have a full hour to let it simmer, but it tasted good. I also didn't have a bay leaf, so I used sweet basil. So good job Clyde!

These were okay.  My pork chops were a little dry but were also pretty thin so that probably was the reason.  I don't usually make pork chops, but these were very easy so will probably make again.  Will likely use more chicen broth because there was not much left after cooking with the chops for an hour.  I ended up adding more plus cornstarch to make the gravy thicker.  I served with sauted spinach and linguine.  Good combo.

I rely on these recipes because i'm a vegetarian. I just cook them - don't taste them!  My husband really raved about this dish. The only thing I changed was to use red wine instead of beef broth. Served them with baked, buttered acorn squash.

These were ok butnothing to brag about. My husband loveeees pork and will eat it any day of the week. HE is not generally fussy, but admitted that these were kind of tough and bland.  Was definately missing something. I wont be making these again especially when i have so many other great chop recipes.

This is the absolute BEST pork chop recipe!  I tried cooking pork chops the old way (breaded) once and I couldn't even finish eating it!  I am convinced there is no better way to prepare pork chops.  I stuck to the recipe and it comes out perfect every time, although it's important to reduce the liquid or it will turn out too thin and depending on your chops adjust the cooking time accordingly.  I serve it with parmesan mashed red potatos and steamed veggies; the sauce can go over everything!  My family requests this one all the time; it's our all time favorite.

This was a great easy recipe, though I did modify it a bit.  I used boneless loin chops, which I floured before browning (this helped the sauce thicken later).  I followed some of the previous suggestions and simmered the onion/garlic mixture together with the chops for about 20 minutes.  I loved this, although hubby wasn't very fond of it (pork is not one of his favorites).  The sauce, though, was fabulous (I doubled it as suggested) and he said several times he'd like to try it with chicken, so that's probably how I'll make this recipe from now on.  I served this with jasmine rice and it was YUMMY!  Too bad hubby doesn't like pork, but that way there was more for me :o).

This just didn't work for me. The sauce came out ok, not bad, but no one was too crazy about it. The big problem was the chops themselves. They came out way too dry, even after simmering for only 30 minutes. I forced mine down, but my girls and my hubby wouldn't take more than one bite.

My husband rated 4 star. I gave 3 and a half. The chops were VERY TENDER AND MOIST cooked 45 minute (not the hour stated) on MED - LOW heat (recipe states only low heat. The sauce was very thick, mild and creamy with a hint of paprika flavor. I felt the sauce could of used a little more spice. Next time I will add onion powder, more garlic and more paprika. Great creation Clyde Patterson!

Thought it was very good except it needed more flavor for me.  I did add garlic and onion powder to the pork chops but that still wasn't enough.  Definately needs more garlic.  We did enjoy it though and the gravy was excellent over mashed potatoes.

I scaled this for two servings. The flavour was good but it was quite rich so I probably wouldn't make it all the time. The pork chops were very moist and tender. The only thing I changed was use 1 packet of OXO chicken boullion to the water to make "chicken broth".

This was a very tasty way to cook pork. I used pork cutlets that were about 1 inch thick and they turned out very tender and juicy. We didn't need to use a knife to cut them. I made noodles to go with the sauce but there wasn't quite enough sauce to go on the meat and the noodles.

This was a good meal.  The pork was tender and I will make it again.  It tasted as if it was missing one thing.  I don't know what it was or I would have added it.  Thyme maybe.  It was very good though.

This was delicious!  I cut the meat in half because it was just for my husband and myself, but after trying it we wished that I had made the full batch!  The pork is perfectly tender and it was great served with fresh string beans.

The sauce was absolutely delicious! I would make this sauce on its own and just pour it over grilled chops, or over chicken! The chops were a little overcooked for me, cooked this way. But that sauce...yum!!!

Even after reducing the broth the sauce seemed thin. I added another half cup of sour cream and another 1/2 tsp paprika. Still would have liked a thicker sauce. But the chops were tender and it tasted good with the smoked paprika.

Sauce gets 5 stars. It was super flavorful no doubt due to reducing the braising liquid down to half. However, there was a problem that I'm surprised nobody else encountered: When you braise a lean meat like trimed pork chops (or fillet mignon for that matter) the meat actually toughens. Seems counter intuitive, but its true. Consequently, after an hour of braising this beautiful 1-1/2" thick pork chop, it became dried out. Seriously dried out. To cure this, I would suggest braising for no more than 15 minutes. That would be enough to cook it thoroughly, particularly after having seared it in the hot pan for a minute each side.

I followed this recipe as it is written and it was just O.K. It lacked flavor, though the sour cream added at the end gives it a little bit of a twang. This recipe isn't bad but not something I would add to my dinner rotation on a regular basis.

No changes except used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. A bit  oniony for our liking, but very tender. Smoky paprika helped make a great sauce.

My husband and I really enjoyed this!  Daughter took one bite and reminded us that she doesn't like pork chops.  ~~ I did make some minor adjustments.  These notes are so I know what to do next time . . . season chops with black pepper & Vegeta (lightly!).  Use garlic & onion powder for texture.  Increase chicken broth to 2 cups, add a little rosemary with bay.  When reducing, taste & add a little more Vegeta & Maggi. Add only 1 tsp paprika.   ~~  I made brown/wild rice to go with this.  Used leftover chicken broth & a little Vegeta when cooking.  It was *really* good with the sauce drizzled over it.  ~~~ Thanks so much for the recipe.  My husband and I will enjoy this again.  Daughter can have some green beans.  :-)

Delicious, my whole family loved it!  Followed the recipe pretty much as written, just added a little more garlic and a splash of white wine. The sauce was amazing, long after my pork chop was gone I kept dipping noodles in  it.  So glad there's one left over to take to work tomorrow!

This  recipe was delicious and I will definetly make it again. The only thing I had to change was the sour cream. Opened up the container from the fridge and there was barely a quarter cup left. I improvised last minute and used a small can of Campbell's cream of mushroom soup. It was perfect. I also added 1/4  cup of white wine when adding the chicken broth. This recipe is a keeper. Served with roasted Cauliflower and a side salad.

Awesomely delicious!  The pork chops are moist and good.  Gravy is fantastic and you could probably thicken it a bit if you want.  I made it with mashed potatoes, and we loved it.  Pretty easy too.

Oh my goodness!  

I couldn't stand the thought of having shake and bake one more time, so I found these pork chops and decided to try something different.  I'm so glad I did.  I used boneless chops and they turned out so moist and delicious.  And don't get me started on the sauce!  Delish!  My fiancé and I prefer less onion (just personal preference), so I will decrease that the next time, but otherwise, it was fantastic!  I served the pork chops with mashed potatoes and there was plenty of gravy to go around.  Just make sure you make enough for left overs!

"Pleasant" sums this up very nicely.  Prepared exactly as written, except I only had 4 chops so I doubt it makes any difference.  Extremely flavorful and very good.

Wow. Made this tonight and I thought I ruined it when the paprika bottle opened up and spilled in the sauce. I scooped out as much as possible and hoped for the best. It was wonderful. Hubby loved in and poured some of the sauce on his veggies which was great.

It was DELICIOUS! However I cooked mine for much less. When you brown a pork chop its almost cooked as it is... If yours are very thick maybe this would make sense, but for an average pork chop I'd say 30-40 minutes is fine. Just check the doneness as you're cooking. The sauce was amazing!!

Deee-lish!  I made the recipe as stated, just upped the seasonings a bit.  The taste was awesome, and I had everything on hand already, so it was convenient as well.

Very good! This is a family favorite in my house! I do however suggest using SMOKED PAPRIKA, it just makes it even better!

First of all, this reminded me a lot of a paprikash sauce. The sauce didn't turn out like I was expecting, in fact it was slightly gritty. I gave this recipe 4 stars, because the meat was amazing!!! Absolutely tender & moist.

This was great - followed the instructions, only i cut the recipe to fit 2 pork chops instead of 6 and used some white cooking wine with the chicken broth.  Wasn't too sure about the sauce, it took longer to reduce than i expected (10ish minutes), but it really was great when it was done - more than thick enough, and very tasty.   It's not a 5* because the chops were a little dry at the end, but i will definitely try again, it was more than likely my fault. Thanks for the recipe!

EXCELLLENT!!! I do not remove the garlic and onions I just let them simmer with my chops. I do however recomment THICK chops if not they become tough. I serve this with mash potatoes and my kids just eat it up..

I made it with the onions and garlic cooking with the chops, in the electric skillet.  Browned the chops but they were thin, so I didn't cook them very long - about 10min in the broth (and sherry).  I've done a similar recipe where you add a bit of tomato paste and some dijon mustard to the pan sauce while reducing which I think has better flavor.  I've also done a version with apples and dijon mustard.    I added very little lowfat sour cream and served the chops with mashed potatoes and a veggie.  It was good - but nothing extraordinary.  Next time I will cook the chops longer so they are more tender.  Good basic recipe.

I thought this was a very tasty dish and went well over rice since there was lots of lovely gravy to wet the rice. Definitely going to be using it again!

EDIT: I have made this numerous times now and have a couple of tips. One, definitely customize the cook time based on how thick your chops are. Tonight I made two bone in chops that were about an inch thick and they only needed to simmer for 25 minutes. Also, try it with beef broth sometime - DELISH!

Great recipe. It was nice to have pork chops without cream of mushroom soup on them! Like another reviewer, kept onion & garlic in pan the whole time with the chops, and cooked only for 40 mins since my chops were boneless & a bit thin. The whole family enjoyed.

Turned out ok, but seemed to be missing something.  I stuck to the original recipe except I also added mushrooms.  If I make this again I'll experiment with different spices in the sauce.

I love this recipe but love it more with a few tweaks:saute one onion until soft in olive oil, not butter, and a little saltbrown pork loin medallions or pork chops on both sides with s & premove pork to plateadd a few cloves of minced garlic for a minute or twosplash of white wine, cajun seasoning instead of paprika, and rosemary. cook wine down. Add sourcream, bay leaves, chicken broth and bring to a boil. turn down to low and add pork. Simmer until pork is cooked. I poor it over rice and its super good!

Fabulous! As some others suggested, I added mushrooms with the onions and used 1/2 white wine and 1/3 chicken broth. There are just 2 of us so I only made 2 chops but kept the sauce amount as written and served the extra over mashed potatoes.

This was really good!! I added some mushrooms to the onions because my husband and I really like mushrooms. I didn't have to cook the pork chops as long. I served them over noodles and it was great. I just ate the leftovers for lunch and it was even better the next day!! Thanks!

Ok 3.5. The pork chops were tough. The sauce was great.  I added a bit of fresh rosemary and a little bit of white wine. Probably will try again.

Yum!  I combined everything in one pan (didn't separate out the onions and garlic) and I did 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 wine to equal 3/4 cup per other reviewers.  I also chopped up my pork chops into cubes so I didn't have to worry about eating around the bone later.  This shortened the cooking time (with the broth in the pan) by about 25 minutes.  While I was putting away the leftovers, I was having trouble stopping from eating them - they were so good!

Really great!!! Followed these suggestions: cooked pork chops with garlic and onions, and added cornstarch at the end to thicken as desired. I only cooked 3 porkchops for the 6 porkchop recipe and saved the remainder sauce for tomorrow's mashed potatoes!

The sauce really rocks! I took the suggestion of others using white wine and chicken broth (a cup total), simmered chops @45 min., and used cajun seasoning instead of paprika. The flavor was outstanding. Husband thought it would go well with chicken also.

Good pork chops - very similiar to a sauce for a Chicken Paprikash dish I also did this week. I did just a few modifications that others suggested, doubled my garlic, left my onions and garlic in while browning and simmering, sub'd half the chicken broth with white wine, added just a little extra chicken broth and wine to cover chops about half way, and then did add a little cornstarch to thicken to our liking.  Served over white rice. I'm not a pork chop person but I would make these again no problem! Thanks!

This is a good concept, but I didn't like how the pork chop tasted, like it was boiled in water.  Did I do something wrong? Maybe so. However, my husband loved the meal.  I also added mushrooms, smoked paprika and used light SC, and the sauce came out tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

This deserves a better name!  This was really good, will probably make again.  We didn't need to cook the chops in the broth for an hour though- just about 45 minutes was plenty of time.  Yum.

Not a bad dinner here. We used chicken, which turned out fine. I'll probably use this recipe again, but maybe with less onion. I used a small onion, but it was still a lot of flavor that overpowered almost everything else. The paprika flavor is a nice addition.

The sauce was delish! I added some sherry and used homemade stock and increased it to 1 1/4 cups. Also I sauteed mushrooms with onions and garlic.  The problem was the pork chops were tough and overcooked.  Didn't sounds like anyone else had the problem. Might try the recipe with sliced pork tenderloin and decrease cooking time by at least half

I should begin this review by stating that I always increase garlic and/or other spices to most recipes.  I resized this recipe from 6 to 3 so it is possible the translation hurt.  I found the sauce to be very bland -- it added nothing to the meal.

We were looking forward to this dish since the reviews were so good. This was not a hit with our family. The sauce was not flavorful and the meat was not seasoned enough.

The taste of those was soo good.  I don't know why, though, but I can't produce tender chops!  Maybe it's the cut I buy but they were still tough after an hour.  However the gravy was sooo good.  I'll keep trying with different cuts of pork.  Thanks!

This has become a regular meal in our house, everyone loves it and I have shared the recipe with friends who love it. I didn't seperate the onions/garlic from the chops, sauted and simmered with them the whole time.  I used, garlic salt and pepper, 3 bay leaves and substituted cajun seasoning for the paprika, delicious.  I added some cornstarch to the gravy so that it would thicken to our personal preference. Served with mashed potatoes and cauliflower and the sauce is amazing over the cauliflower. Thankyou for sharing this recipe.

I really liked this recipe-- and so glad to get away from the "cream of.. soups."  I took the advice from some of the reviews and BROWNED (not cooked) the pork chops-- maybe 2 minutes a side and then started the cooking for an hour process.  They turned out super tender.  Also I added about 1/4 cup more chix broth.  The sauce was thin but preferred it this way-- would have been too rich had it been thick.  The ONLY thing I didn't do was use paprika-- not a fan.  Loved it!  Thanks.

This recipe was very good.  I used boneless chops (not the thin cut), and they turned out quite tender.  The sauce was delicious, and I will be making this recipe using chicken as well.  My husband and I both enjoyed it!

the recipe sounded really yummi, but after I put in the sour cream it was way to sour creamy tasting. I then had to add some cream and I didn't care for it much. My husband and Father in law liked it. The meat was definitely good. Maybe it is just personal preference. The kids ate the sauce over mashed potatoes. So maybe I'll tinker a bit with it.

I was begged to make this again!! I actually only cooked this for two people so because I reduced the recipe it was a little harder. Since the onions browned (I have an awful oven), I added the chicken stock but instead of white wine like others suggested I used a splash of brandy. I also didn't have paprika so I used a small pinch of Curry. It came out fantastic!! I will definitely cook this again. Thanks.

Well this was pretty darn good. It was worth the quick trip to the store for sour cream. I will make it again. For me, it did seem like there was something missing. I can't quite put my finger on it...maybe it just needed a bit more kick but overall it was good. Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, which is probably where I went wrong.  WAY too much onion and WAY too much paprika.  Could have used more garlic.  I wouldn't attempt again when there are tons of great pork chops recipes out there.

This is a great recipe.  My family loved it and I will make it again.  I like my sauce thicker and more of it so I used more chicken broth and sour cream, and then thickened with cornstarch.  This is a great recipe for those that need gluten free.  Just be sure to use gluten free chicken broth.  This tastes like a recipe I used to use with cream of chicken soup, but can't use anymore due to Celic Disease.  Thanks so much.

I used a couple of shallots instead of onions, and ended up taking them off the stovetop after 30 minutes (they were still a little tough for my taste).  Next time I make this receipe I'll have a side of egg noodles.

i am still eating and can't wait to review.  this was delish!  I took others suggestions and put a large portion of cajun spices and a splash of white wine.  it was a great gravy, no corn starch needed.  i mashed some potatoes with chedder cheese and poured the gravy and chops right on top.  YUM YUM.

Great taste, easy recipe!  I didn't have onion so I substituted celery.  I did not have time to cook the chops the full hour so they were a bit tough but that is not the recipe's fault. I added about 1 tsp of corn starch in about 3 tbsp of cold water to thicken a little.

This was very good.  I used 3/4 chicken broth and 1/4 white wine.  I did have to add more broth as the chops cooked and it appeared there wasn't enough liquid.  The sauce could have been a little thicker so next time I will thicken it with corn starch.  Had thinner, boneless chops so I cooked until they reached 160 on the thermometer but they were just a little tough.  Served with egg noodles and glazed carrots.  Definitely would make again.  Thanks

This was excellent!  I've never made pork chops before in my 12 years of marriage.  I made this earlier in the day while the kids were napping, heated up on stove later in the evening and it was delicious.  A great recipe to make in advance!

Good stuff.  Left the onion/garlic in with the pork chops.  I did 4x the chicken broth and 3x the sour cream/paprika.  I thickened the broth up a bit with some flour before adding the sour cream.  Will make again and will experiment some more ;)

I'm happy I stumbled across this recipe, this is a great break from the normal baked pork chops. My husband is a die-hard "Shake n Bake" fan...so this was a wonderful escape from it. I used 4 pork loin chops (bone in) that were about 1 inch thick. After cooking my onions and garlic- I just left them in the pan to cook with my chops (after browning, I let them simmer for about 30 minutes). Also, since I was a tad low on sour cream, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the gravy. Granted, I tend to love anything labeled or containing cream, but I really enjoyed this. I will add this to my rotation of recipes.

My fiance usually hates onions, but after eating this dish, suggested using more! I also recommend 1 tbsp. of honey to sweeten it up a bit. I also boiled potatoes for an hour with garlic and butter while the broth was simmering for a simple side dish.

This was just OK.  I didn't like all the paprika taste, but I will try again and use other spices.  The gravy it makes is very good but I feel I ruined it by adding the paprika.  I used chicken broth and white wine for the liquid.  These were very moist chops!

This was just ok. I browned Pork Chops with the onions and garlic, and that was the best part. The chops were ok in flavor, but very dry, and the sauce tasted like only sour cream.

I will not be making this again.

This recipe is fabulous. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a few sliced mushrooms to the onion and garlic stage. The smell while cooking was wonderful and the sauce is great on mashed potatoes or noodles. Absolutely loved it!

This is a decent base recipe. I changed a few things though. I didn't feel like waiting an hour for them to cook, so I simmered them at medium-low for about 25 min. I also added an extra clove of garlic, a pinch of garlic powder and onion powder, and a little cayenne pepper. My fiance loved it.

Added mushrooms to chops while they were cooking.  Added additional seasoning to sauce (garlic & onion powder and more salt and ground pepper)

This is the best pork chop recipe that we have ever had.  I used thin chops, (5) in this case, browned first, doubled the sauce ingrediants, (broth was 2 cups prepared chicken flavor base with no msg, no papricka and added mushrooms.  My chops usually turn out dry, however not these. I will be trying it on chicken next.  Thanks for submitting it!

5 stars from the entire family!  Everyone loved it~ even the little ones stuck around and asked for seconds.  I made two changes: shortened the simmering time (after browning) to 20 minutes, (they were 1/2" cut) and I used onion powder instead of the real deal to pacify the kids.  Excellent~thank you!

Pork was very tender; nice body to sauce. It was a tad salty for me though;
maybe because I used cube to make broth. It wasn't like that when I initially tasted it, but became so after cooking for 1 hr. Will probably make again. Thanks!

my fiance LOVED this recipe.  the only things i changed were using more garlic (2-3 cloves), more broth (2.5c),more sour cream (1.5c) and just a TB or 2 of flour to thicken the sauce. changes were just a matter of his taste

This was a good recipe.  Everyone liked it.  Make sure you season the pork chops well while you are frying them and, I think I will put the chops back in the pan to simmer in the sauce as it was hard to keep them hot.  Very nice.  Thanks.

My family loves these - even my picky kid! I only simmered chops for about 40 minutes (thinner chops even less time) but they were still fork-tender. I've used boneless and bone-in chops. Kitchen smells great when cooking! My husband of 18 years doesn't want me to make chops any other way. I serve with baby parsley potatoes and fresh steamed green beans. Makes an impressive meal!

Used thin pork chops and cut cooking time to about 20 minutes.  Quick, easy, and tasty.

Turned out great! Just had to add some flour to thicken the gravy and cooked it for 20 minutes instead of 1 hour.

These were very good. I followed the recipe exactly, and the pork chops came out beautifully - juicy and flavorful.  My husband really liked them too, so I'll be adding them to our list of favorites.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

Excellent!  Like a Pork Stroganoff.  Watch your fluid level during the long cooking period.  First time I made it, I was disolving boullion as quickly as I could, and poured in some cooking sherry.  Second time, I had extra broth at hand, and needed it.  Added the sherry the second time because the dish was so good the first.

I was looking for a new way to cook pork chops and this recipe had ingredients that we already had at home.  I was tied up so I gave the recipe to my husband to make.  It turned out wonderful!  Took the sugguestion of another reviewer and added small can of cooked/sliced mushrooms.  We had 4 boneless chops so we decreased the simmering time from 1 hr to about 35 minutes.  Served with garlic and herb mashed potatoes and green beans - it looked and tasted like a restaurant!  Tahnks for the recipe!  All recipes should be this easy and tasty!

Overall, fairly bland. One hour is far too long on the stovetop. The chops become very dry and tough.

This was really good. I never make chops because I always make them so dry but them came out nice and tender. I did make extra sauce like others suggested and I used only 1/2 the paprika and I also added mushrooms and extra garlic. I will definitely make this again.

We liked this, and found it to be very tasty.  It took a really long time to make, due to the hour of cooking time.  I'm curious how this would come out if done in the crock pot.
Thanks for the recipe!

I'm giving this recipe five stars because my boyfriend and I both loved it and it was easy to make.  I used chicken broth for the broth and thickened it at the end with a little cornstarch mixed with the extra chicken broth, added a little extra garlic and only 1 tsp paprika.  The pork chops were tender and the sauce was very good. It was excellent, inexpensive and was great with some roasted potatoes and a veggie.  Will defiinitely make this one again.

We enjoyed this recipe, I only used 1 1/2 teaspoons of paprika, more garlic and sprinkled in some Cavender's Greek seasoning as it was a little on the bland side for us.  Very nice recipe!

My family loved these pork chops!  I doubled the sauce and served over rice.  I also increased cooking time to 1 hr. 15 min. I'm not a big fan of bay leaves, so I omitted it.  I will be making this again!

Made this last night for the family, it was great! We served plain rice along side with the extra sauce. I used a whole can of chicken stock & the sauce was thinner than I liked, so next time I need to adjust for that. I also didn't cook it as long. Great flavor!

This recipe was pretty good although I felt there was too much paprika in the recipe.  My husband liked it and my 3yr old didn't complain either.  I liked the flavor of the pork chops alone--without the sour cream/paprika topping.

EXCELLENT! For the longest time my husband and I would not eat pork chops- mainly becuase we did not have a good recipe for cooking them. That has now changed! This recipe will leave your stomach craving for more! You've gotta try it!

This was okay, I felt like it was missing something I'm not sure what though. It wasn't very appetizing looking. Probably won't make again.

Because there were two parts to this recipe I gave it four stars for ease.  For taste it gets 5 stars. Next time I would add more chicken broth because I didn't have much sauce to work with.

I thought this was very good.  I cooked it for about 40 minutes and it turned out great.  My chops were pretty thin, and I only did three of them, and halved the recipe.  There were no left overs and my boys wanted more!

I found my porkchops to be very dry.  The recommended cooking time of 1 hour was way too long.  The sauce was to  watery.  But you never know until you try!

Good recipe.  I think my chops were a little on the thin side and ended up a little tough.  But the flavor was wonderful and I will try this again with some thick chops.

This recipe was very good...however, for added flavor, I used only a 1/2 cup of chicken broth and 1/4 cup of white wine.  I also added 1 cup of sauteed mushrooms to the recipe. I omitted the bay leaf, as I am not a particular fan of them. Overall, this recipe is a keeper!

The whole family really enjoyed the taste. I didn't like the amount of chopped onion. The next time I will try slicing them instead like suggested. I also should have cooked with more broth. Served like stroganoff over buttered noodles andwith peas. I will make this again with modifications.

I agree with other reviewers that the pork chops came out a little dry and tough.  Next time I will sear the chops in the pan and then transfer them to the oven to bake.  The sauce was really good.  The recipe is worth trying just for that reason.

Well I thought this sounded good. I love sour cream and had some pork chops so I gave it a try today. The sauce was delicious, though I added mushrooms and extra sour cream. The pork chops, however were like tire rubber. I followed the instructions exactly. I don't know what went wrong, but I won't be making these again because of that reason. The sauce was delicious, but it was basicly nothing more than a simple beef stroganoff sauce. Next time I'm in the mood for sour cream, I'll just make that.
I only gave it a 3 because of the sauce.

Oh, my gosh!!  I don't think I have ever had a pork chop so tender.  The meat was falling off the bone we didn't even have to use a knife (seriously).  And the sauce was phenomenal!  Very much like Chicken Paprikosh which we love but with pork.  I served with rice but next time I am going to make some spaetzle and smother those in the sauce - I can't wait. Just excellent!  Thanks for the recipe.

The sauce was delicious, but the pork chops were so dry.  I am not blaming the recipe, it could have been my chops, but I can still only give it three stars.

An extremely easy recipe with simple ingredients, and very tasty results.  My hubby and I both enjoyed them.  Note: I took the advice of another reviewer and floured the chops before browning.  I found this made my sauce a wierd consistency, perhaps I overfloured them, but I will not do that in the future.  

Thanks for the 'pleasant' pork chops Clyde ;)

I, like some of the others, didn't agree w/this recipe. I used decent sized chops but my problem came in the mixture of the chicken broth and garlic. The sauce came out okay (though i did use a little flour to help brown the chops), but the flavor I found might be somewhat of an acquired taste that I'm not used to. The sour cream did add a different taste that I think I will transfer over to a chicken and rice dish, just not pork.

My family liked these pork chops. Mine were super thin, so I only sauteed for about 10 min. on low heat.  Also I didn't have a bay leaf, forgot the paprika and added three extra cloves of garlic.  They turned out pretty good, I really like the flavor that the sour cream adds and we'll use this recipe again.

These were very tender (cooked for 40 minutes on a low-medium heat) but nobody was that excited about them.  Would probably not make again.  Sorry

Yummy!
Mine came out great.  I reduced the sauce to almost nothing before I put the sour cream in, and I only put in about 1/2 - 3/4 cup sour cream (I didn't have a full cup left)

I also used olive oil instead of butter and low fat sour cream

Next time I'll add some cooking sherry to give it a little more flavor, but it was still really good.

The pork itself wasn't bad.  The flavor was average to above average.  I was surprised at how dry it turned out.  I used thick chops, so that may have something to do with it.

The sauce was the drawback in my eyes.  It was very thin, looked horrible, and the taste was average.

I'm giving it 3 stars because this wasn't a horrible meal.  Just not for me.

This was soooo much better than I thought it was going to be!!  I added an extra onion and it was perfect because we all love onions.  The sauce was delicious -- my husband was pouring it on everything on his plate!! I will add this to my favorite recipes and make this again! It did only take about 40 minutes to cook the pork chops.
Thanks for sharing!

These are so delicious. I was gettin scared toward the end, not sure how they were gonna turn out. I got stuck on the part that says heat juices in skillet and reduce to half. I wasnt sure what to reduce to half, so i used my own judgement and turned the heat down to half and i guess that was right cause they turned out pretty darn good. I served it over rice and it was wonderful. Will definately make again and try with chicken too!! Thanks for the recipe!!!

This recipe was a godsend! My husband rarely gets excited about the meals I cook, but this one had him in a tizzy! After reading the other reviews, I too cut down the simmer time to about 35 minutes instead of an hour and they were beautiful. My husband says the name should be changed to A*W*E*S*O*M*E Pork chops! Thank you Clyde!

My husband and I both love this recipe...it gives you a very moist and tender porkchop and the sauce has an excellent flavor.  I made it one night for a large family dinner and now the recipe is a regular in my entire family's dinner plans!!!

My husband really liked this; I thought it was OK...but definitely one of the better pork chop recipes I've come across.  I was ready to give up on them except for grilling!  The meat ended up a bit dry, despite the fact that I only let them simmer for 35 minutes, so I will adjust that next time.  I'll also probably add a pepperoncini to the sauce to give it some kick.  Thanks!

I have been looking for so many ways to cook and came across this one! It turned out lovely and smelt nice. Being a vegetarian, I can only pass on what my partner thought. The sauce was nice and very tasty. As my partner likes his meat "crispy", I will pop the pork chops under the gril to crips while making the sauce. It was easy to make and the paprika bought great colour to the sauce.

This was GREAT. My whole family loved it. I basically followed the recipe. The only thing I changed in it was I left the onions and garlic in with the meat the whole time and I added some white wine. It turned out great. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious and flavorful!  I didn't have the bay leaf, so I seasoned with marjoram & thyme. I think it would work well with really thick pork chops - mine got a bit thin after simmering for so long, but were still tender and delicious!

This recipe has the potential to be perfect!  The flavor is awesome, it was so good with egg noodles.  My only complaint was that the sauce was thin and didn't adhere to the egg noodles.  Next time, I'll add something to thicken it up, and it should be 5 stars for sure!  Thanks for the recipe, my family loved it.

Sounds simple, but very good.   Nice combination of basic flavors...garlic, paprika, onion.  I used reduced fat sour cream and Hungarian paprika (I have a friend from Hungary and she cooks something very similar to this with chicken...she turned me on to Hungarian paprikas as they are better than the traditional grocery store paprikas...look for them in a square tin in the spice section...they have foreign sounding names)

We served these with rice...you may want to double your sauce (we did, we like a lot of gravy).  Watch your temperature when cooking carefully, I didn't turn mine low enough the second time and the sauce reduced too much and got glunky and wasn't as good as the first time I made it.

Yummy, becoming a staple in my home...may be a good way to cook chicken too.

Next time I might keep the onion in there simmering...this is kind of how my hungarian friend does her chicken paprikash (sp?)

I made this with egg noodles on the side.  The gravy was definitely better over the chops vs. the noodles.  I still think it was missing something.  I will keep working with this one!

So easy and so good.....my family and my guests loved them.  It almost seemed to simple to be true, but I'll tell you.....they are tender and so yummy!  Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.

This is absolutely delicious! My husband loved it and I will probably have to make it once a week from now on.
