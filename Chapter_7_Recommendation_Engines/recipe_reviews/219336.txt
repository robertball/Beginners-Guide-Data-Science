I was looking for a smoothie that would hide the carrots for my 3 young kids.  This was perfect, and I didn't even have all the ingredients on hand. I made this smoothie without the flax, dates, lemon or salt, but it was so delicious!

I liked this smoothie a lot.  Let's face it...there are a gazillion smoothie recipes out there and they all start looking a whole lot alike after awhile.  Not too many of them are orange and/or have carrots so this one is a nice addition to the repertoire. I omitted the salt because I didn't feel the need to add any more sodium to my diet than I'm already getting.  I didn't use dates since I don't keep them around.  I did add ice, as I always do, because I like the texture with it.

Wow, this was different! This is definitely not something for the new smoothie drinker. I cut the recipe in half and the only two things I did different was subbed dried prunes for the dates and I didn't have the flax seed powder to add. I also did peel the apple, as it didn't say. The thing I did not care for was the ingredients didn't seem to come together at all. It tasted quite tart from the lemon, a little like a banana and orange smoothie, yet kind of like thick carrot juice. I also thought the dark specks from the dried fruit looked a little Halloweenish mixed in the thousand island dressing orange colored drink. The ice saved it some. I drank part of one drink, no one else would touch it. I think it would have been much better like the first reviewer made it. I would leave out the lemon juice, salt, and dates.

This one surprised the heck out of me, I wasn't quite sure what I'd end up with.  Well, it was EXCELLENT!  I drink a lot of smoothies, and I'd rank this one in my Top 5.  I scaled this down to one serving, used Greek yogurt, and cored but didn't peel my red MacIntosh apple which enhanced its eye appeal.  Followed the recipe to the letter (except no salt), loved its creaminess and bright flavor, and  wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks, michimama, for a new and healthy breakfast smoothie.

Yum! This is soooooo tasty! I didn't have flax seeds so I ground a tbsp of chia seeds instead. Seriously tasty and satisfying. A great change from my usual Green breakfast! Highly recommended
