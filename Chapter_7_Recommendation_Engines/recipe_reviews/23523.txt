I think it's a decent recipe and something different for sure. That said, I used half the amount of chipotle pepper and had people who felt it was too spicy. I served the warm pineapple with vanilla bean ice cream and put raw sugar on the pineapple as it grilled. I personally liked it.

I use half the powdered chipotle pepper. It will be hot enough, and still very enjoyable.

I think it actually tasted better when I had to use dried cilantro.

I made this as written and it was pretty good. I thought it held the spice more than it did the rest of the marinade.  It was so simple and interesting that I want to make the sauce next time and try using that and the pineapple as the base for a main dish. Edit 2/6/13: I ran out of chipotle and had to sub for half with ancho chile powder. I think I preferred it like this. Regardless, we really enjoy this recipe.

We love spicy foods, and found this far too hot to enjoy with that much chipotle.

I love grilled fruit and I love tequila, but this combination of sweet and spicy just didn't work for me...sorry. I was better off just grilling the pineapple by itself and drinking the tequila!

I doubled the amount of pineapple, tequila and juice.  Used only 1 c of cilantro and 3/4 T chipotle powder.  The spicy lovers thought it was perfect, but I will only use 1/2 T of chipotle next time.  A great bbq dessert.

I love grilled pineapples and this was a nice change in marinade.  (Usually use soy and/or ginger based marinades).  Enjoyed it.

Made exactly as recipe - EXCEPT - did not grill but put in a med-high dry frying pan and just turned them until slightly browned. When I first tried the marinade, it was so spicy I wondered if my guests would be able to take the heat. However, once cooked, the flavour was AMAZING and not nearly as spicy as when first tried. My guests and hubby  LOVED this recipe. I served as a side dish with chicken enchiladas, rajas, mexican rice, refried beans and salad with green goddess dressing.  This recipe would be really good with ice cream!
