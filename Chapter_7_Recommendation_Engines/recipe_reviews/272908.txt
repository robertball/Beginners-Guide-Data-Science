I made this recipe exactly as described and it is wonderful. I used all of the simple syrup and my wife and I think it's just right. I'm also trying this recipe with orange peel. Give it a try, you won't be dissappointed.

5/4/19: Just started this today, and so far so good! I was only able to find a 750 ml bottle of Everclear, so I adjusted the recipe down to about 30 servings, and used the zest of 9 lemons. I put it in a large glass jar, and will let it sit in the cellar for a month--and I'll update my review then! EDIT 9/2/19: Finally got around to editing my review! Since I scaled this down to 30 servings, the recipe called for 3 cups water and 3 cups sugar for the simple syrup--and we used all of it to suit our tastes. This was really pretty easy to make, and it tastes fantastic (particularly when added to a some iced tea)! It's very lemony, and perfectly sweet without being overwhelming. Will definitely be making this again!

Did this for Christmas gifts.  Made exactly as given. 
Did mix Ever Clear equally with Simple Syrup, to give a 90 proof drink.  
Took the bottles of Limoncello & placed then into a freezer safe container, & filled the container with water.  After the water froze., the Limoncello was delivered in its own block of ice. The bottle slide out of the ice for pouring.
