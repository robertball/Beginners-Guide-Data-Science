OK, I had to just laugh at some of the reviews I read.....  All those complaints about heaviness and density!  Helloooooo???  These are not your Krispy Kreme yeast-raised doughnuts!  They are traditional CAKE doughnuts.  They are MEANT to be a dense and heavy type of doughnut!  I read up on the reviews, heeded some advice and began with a little extra flour in my dough.  The time listed from start to end for this recipe was 25 minutes, and it was RIGHT ON!  I whipped these up, rolled them out, cut and fried.  My daughter rolled in sugar/cinnamon...and my family of five wolfed them down!  No problems here!  Nice recipe.  Simple and easy dough product.  Fun and delicious!

I used to work at a bakery and made all of the doughnuts there. These are pretty good, but need more cinnamon and nutmeg. I also needed to add more flour to successfully roll these out, but don't add any more than what you need to be able to roll them out without making a huge mess. The oil temperature is super important for cooking these just right.

These doughnuts are SO EASY to make.  I have never made doughnuts before, but they turned out wonderful ~ Crispy outside, soft moist inside!  They were great just plain without the cinnamon-sugar on them, but were excellent when that was added!  A new breakfast treat for my boys!

Well, after reading some of the reviews, I can't seem to figure this out.  I added a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg, and instead of making rolled donuts, a used a 1oz scoop and made "donut holes".  They were light and flavorfull, and were enjoyed by all!

This was a great easy recipe.  I had everything on hand and mixed up the batter the night before and shaped them so they were ready to be cooked right away in the morning!!

This recipe was exactly what I wanted. The dough is sticky and very soft . If you aren't experienced with pastry dough it would be hard to work with. There needs to be more of en explanation in the recipe, so I have to subtract a star from an otherwise perfect recipe, if I could subtract only one half of a star I would.  Let me tell you how to make this into perfect doughnuts.   Once the dough is mixed, chill it for just 15 minuets more or less. using a rubber spatula scrape it out & off the bowl onto a HEAVILY flour dusted counter top, and then also heavily dust the top of the dough with the flour. Now roll it flat & about 3/4 of an inch thick and cut as  directed now it will be easy to remove perfect doughnut shapes from the counter to the pan.

I always wanted to make doughnuts, and this was my first attempt.  I used this recipe because it required only basic ingredients.  In fact, I ommitted the nutmeg and cinammon, so the ingredients were few and basic, but the cooking process was not.  

I scaled the recipe for four servings, and instead of adding 1/3 of an egg, I added a whole egg, thinking it would make the doughnuts richer.  The dough came out extremely sticky and goooey, and it was impossible to roll out.  Half the dough was wasted on my hands, the board, and the roller.  I tried to fry whatever chunks of dough I could, only to have the dough become burnt black in a matter of seconds, causing smoke to fill my apartment.  I boldly bit into one, only to find that the inside was still soft and raw.  I threw away everything: the remaining dough, and the black, grossly shaped chunks.  I went to sleep, vowing to get the recipe right the next morning.

This morning I remade the doughnuts, but took several precautions:

1)I followed the recipe EXACTLY, so that the dough would not become too sticky.

2)I used flour liberally on the board where I placed the dough, and put flowers on my hands, and on the roller, to prevent the dough from sticking everywhere.

3)I flattened the dough to exactly 1/4 of an inch, using a ruler to measure the thickness.  This was to make sure that the doughnut would be cooked completely before the outside burned.

4)I put in a small piece of dough as I heated the oil.  When numer

This was my first attempt at making donuts and they turned out perfectly! My first "experimental" batch turned black because I had heated the oil on high, but after lowering the temperature, they were golden brown and perfectly crispy with a creamy moist interior. I took a tip from Giada Delaurentis from the food channel and put some cinammon and sugar in a small brown bag and the tossed in the freshly cooked donuts. I simply shook the bag to coat and they turned out fabulous!!!

OH MY! These were amazing.  I added a few more shakes of cinnamon and nutmeg to spice it up a bit.   Eat these hot from the pan with a swig of apple cider in between each bite.  Nothing says "Harvest" better than cider and doughnuts!  I will definitely be making this again.  IF you should happen to have any leftovers, they are not so great cold. You will want to heat them up again in your toaster oven.  Thanks Jennifer; I've been looking for an easy, TASTY doughnut recipe.

Really easy and quick! I bumped up the cinammon and nutmeg, but could have added even more for my family's tastes.  Used a juice glass to cut doughnuts and a milk jug lid for the "hole".  Worked perfect!  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Used exact ingredients and measurements; chilled the dough while prepping the counter and heating oil (level 4 out of 6; med-high heat); used 2 1/2 inch diameter doughnut cutter and got 15 doughnuts with their corresponding doughnut holes. I keep a pair of bamboo chopsticks just for frying things; perfect tool for frying up the doughnuts as well as useful to lower them into the hot oil without splashing.

This is a simple, basic, cake doughnut recipe that would be great for any beginning cook. The directions are clearly written and the finished product is delicious. These are not, as stated by another reviewer, yeast doughnuts.  They are heavier, but not overly heavy. You may need to knead a little extra flour into the dough to make it workable - remember that humidity can play a factor in how dry or sticky any dough is. I rolled some in sugar and some in cinnamon and sugar. I'll definitely make these again. Thanks for a great recipe!

I think I made these the laziest way possible. I made a half a batch. I went ahead and used a whole egg, but scaled back the other ingredients. Then I simply spooned small amounts of the batter into the hot oil. Super easy and exactly the kind of indulgent snack I was looking for. Also, I used buttermilk. I will be making these again when the evil cravings haunt me.

This recipe takes less time to make than getting dressed to go to the store to buy doughnuts in the morning! They are fresh, easy and made with simple ingredients-no extra junk. Tastes like a traditional old fashioned cake doughnut-my hubby's favorite! :)

I am always amazed, and frequently shake my head at some peoples' reviews. One lady said she "scaled the recipe" and "instead of adding 1/3 of an egg, I added a whole egg." Then she went on to rant about how sticky the dough was!!! Of course, she also tore up the recipe when she critiqued it. But she wasn't really reviewing the original recipe, she was tearing up her own creation. Some people! 

This recipe, as written, is pretty good. I subtracted a star because I did add extra nutmeg & cinnamon to get a nicer flavor. It's a keeper.

My only complaint about this recipe is that I didn't have any cider to go with the finished product!! ***I followed the directions to the letter, and I had no problems.  The dough was a bit sticky to handle, but coating my hands and the surface with flour did the trick.  (To keep the floury mess contained, I lightly greased a glass cutting board, the floured it.  The grease helps the flour spread out evenly, so you don't get sticky spots where there was to little flour, or big floury spots on your dough where there was too much.  Then the cutting board just went in the dishwasher-voila!! No nasty flour mess to clean off the counter!)***I used the scraps and the doughnut holes to test my oil, since I was doing it on the stove, and without a thermometer.  At first the oil was too cool, and I wound up with some very greasy doughnuts, then it was a bit too hot, and they turned dark and crispy.  But I eventually figured it out, and I was glad to have tested on the scraps, instead of having a whole mess of screwed up doughnuts on my hands!***Overall, I don't know that the time and effort was necessarily worth it, since I can get cinnamon sugar cake doughnuts at the bakery down the street, but it was a fun experiment, and a great recipe. They came out wonderfully.

This recipe was simple and delicous. I made it without the nutmeg (didn't have any) and it came out very tasty. Best part is the texture, it's got a great old fashioned bakery feel to it. Really melts in your mouth.

Good basic cake doughnut.  Easy and fast.  I like that you can be done from start to finish in about 30 minutes. I didn't need to add extra flour other than the flour I put on the table and rolling pin.  I dipped some of them in the vanilla glaze (from this site) and topped with sprinkles.  For the others, we shook them in a bag with cinnamon and sugar.

Pretty good; my children throughly enjoyed making and eating them, my husband loves cake doughnuts and enjoyed these.  I added a significant amount more spices (ginger, cloves, and increased nutmeg and cinnamon slightly) and used evaporated milk.  It was definitely fun to start a new tradition on New Year's Day.

Good recipe, but definitely use a thermometer to ensure oil temperature remains constant at 375F, otherwise you'll end up with overcooked outsides and doughy insides.

These are absolutely fantastic and super easy to make. If your oil is hot enough they come out a little crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I added a little more flour plus about 1/4 tsp of freshly grated nutmeg (I love nutmeg!). They are perfect!

Really fast and easy to follow recipe. The dough was sticky, but the flour on the work surface made it manageable.  Just be sure you make the donuts quite flat, otherwise you'll get raw dough in the middle. I started with the oil too hot and got burnt outside and raw insides. After lowering the oil temp(by adding room temp. oil) and flattening the dough I got perfect donuts, and even tried some different shapes with my large cookie cutters- Stars and sunflowers. Next time I'll cut holes in the middle of those as well. A fun recipe all around. Mine made about twenty, some large, some medium.

A great doughnut with good flavor (I'm liberal with the spices).  375º is a little too hot, some ended up doughy in the center/over done.  350º is a little too cool, they start absorbing oil into the cakes, so be very mindful of your temperature!    The temperature also affects your texture, if you want them cracked on the top, like they come from the store, you definitely need it a little cooler than 375º.  The suggested cook time of 3 minutes is way over board!  Raw fish (for making fish 'n' chips) cooks completely in 3 minutes.  When making yeast doughnuts, I've got it timed down a minute and 30 seconds (60 on the first side, 30 on the second).  I'd say under 2 minutes is probably the ideal to shoot for in your oil heat/fry time combination, any longer and you start absorbing oil, which isn't desirable.

Wow...this is my first try at doughnuts ever, and these came out perfect! The only thing this doesn't say is to refridgerate the dough first. I did for about 20 min. Makes it so much easier to roll out!

Recipe was okay. I formed a log 1/2" thick and about 3" wide then cut 'fingers' to fry. I got about 30 of them...and a few 'bits' to test the grease temperature with. I added a tsp of dried orange peel and a half tsp total of cinnamon. Next time I'll add a full tsp of cinnamon, I think. My one reservation for this recipe is the frying in oil. I'd never done this before (so followed the temp guidelines in the recipe) It seems to absorb more fat then when fried in shortening (my 'usual' method). A quick and easy recipe that I'll use, with the above changes, again. Thanks.

I just finished making these.  They are good, but 375 is way too hot for these.  when they are rolled out to 1/4 inch thick, the outside cooks too quickly and the inside is still gooey.  I'll try these again on a lower oil temperature.  I also substituted a dash of ginger and a dash of ground cloves for the ground nutmeg.

You know what I changed in this recipe?  Nothing.  Zero.  Zilch.  It is a perfect cake doughnut recipe, the kind you can sip an apple cider to.  I've been searching for a good cake doughnut for quite some time.  End of search.  This is our new autumn tradition.

Finally!! This is the recipe I've been looking for.  I've tried two other doughnut recipes but they didn't turn out well.  This dough was so easy to handle and no problems with stickiness as with the others.  Tastes just like the ones my mom used to make.  Thank You so much for submitting this recipe.  I added frosting and sprinkles to a few and they were delish!! They are wonderful plain also.

I followed the directions, and the dough was still very sticky and didn't really form a ball (or at least, it was a very saggy ball).  I didn't roll it out because of it's inconsistency, and instead dropped 1-2" chunks (vaugely donut-hole shaped) into a deep fryer for 3 minutes.  They came out looking like space mutants, but they taste AMAZING!  I made a glaze of 1/2 box powdered sugar, a little butter, and a t. of vanilla and poured that on top.  Out of this world!  Wish they looked more like store-bought holes, though.

This was my first attempt at making donuts and came out terrific! The dough did come out rather sticky, so I would add a bit more flour next time around. Aside from that, they fried up great and tasted terrific rolled in sugar. Definitely know will make again.

Pretty good. I think that 1/4 inch is too thin. They were more like wafers. Next time, I will add more cinnamon and nutmeg.

Fantastic recipe! This was my first time making doughnuts and they turned out great! I admit to using half white sugar and half light brown sugar, for some reason I love to use brown sugar in sweet treats. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Fantastic! My kids are inhaling them as I type. I use buttermilk instead of milk because I had some that was expiring tomorrow. I also added a dash of vanilla extract. They were much easier than I anticipated.

Very easy to do  - 3 minutes was too much, burnt ours, start with shorter time. And they need a topping desperately - I used butter, powdered sugar, and milk. Or for chocolate ones, melted milk chocolate with milk.

This is a great recipe for cake doughnuts! Great plain and great with added ingredients. I added a bit of allspice to the batter and divided it. I added chopped apples to some and shopped bananas to the other. So yummy! I topped all of them with a powdered sugar glaze and chopped walnuts. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made cake doughnuts for years but my old reliable recipe is still in storage after a recent move. I decided to try this recipe but was extremely disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly, except I had to add considerably more milk because of the dryness (the dough wouldn't even stick together). Even then, after they were cooked, they were entirely too hard to eat. As I said, I followed the reciped exactly and made sure I cooked it at the temperature listed. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

I did not use a candy thermometer, but cooked some on medium and some on medium high.  The ones on the lower temp. had a lighter color and were softer as leftovers. After the first 2 donuts,I re-rolled the dough to about 1/2" thick, and cut them out with the mouth of a fruit jar and an oil bottle. These were the size of store bought cake donuts. They stayed warm for at least 1 hr in a thick container w/a towel covering; and were enjoyed by many ladies at my meeting.

I rate this recipe 3 stars because it did not turn out.  I laughed and laughed at these other reviews and thought, man these people really can't cook!  Then, I began to notice something was wrong with MY doughnuts.  I couldn't decide if I was making dough or epoxy! I gave up when my dog tried to eat it and glued her mouth shut!  (hey, there's something this could be good for!)

I chose this recipe because there was no waiting for yeast to rise or chilling in the refrigerator.  It was very quick and easy - 45 minutes start to finish.  The donuts were delicious with powdered sugar or glaze.  I would make them again.

These were wonderful.  Converted to Gluten Free and replaced the flour with 1 1/2 cups of brown rice flour and 1/2 cup of potato starch plus 1 teaspoon of xgum.   I will be making these again!

This is a fast and easy recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out just fine.  Next time I think that I will use 1/2 tsp of salt and I will roll the dough thicker then the 1/4 in recommended.  Those are just my personal preferences though.  Thanks for a great Saturday morning recipe!

Dough came out so sticky that I ended up adding another 1/2 c. of flour to the mix in order to be able to roll anything out. Final product was very dense, and ended up in the trash. I did like the cinnamon/nutmeg flavor combo., but not enough to make this recipe again.

Very dense and heavy. I followed the recipe exactly except I made donut balls instead of the traditional donut-shaped donuts. Need some tweaking.

This is a great doughnut recipe.  First one I have ever tried... Had no idea how easy it was to make them at home.  My husband usually orders them special from the bakery but they didn't have time today to make any so I went on the search to try myself!   I did double the cinnamon and nutmeg as other reviews had recommended to add more. Even used a jar to cut and a water bottle top to make the hole as another reviewer had suggested.  The bottle top made good little doughnut holes too....  Topped with chocolate icing..... yummmy yum yum~~they will melt in your mouth..... No more bakery doughnuts....FAST and EASY! 

Be sure to check your oil temp and cooking time.  My stove heated differently...They did not take near 3 mins to cook....maybe a minute on the first side and 30-45 seconds on the other. 

Thanks Jennifer for sharing.

I added alittle bit of vanilla to my dough.  I also let them cool before putting cinnamon sugar on some of them.  They were very yummy!  We will definitely be doing this more often!  I may try wheat flour next time to give them alittle bit of a healthy twist.

Awesome!  After they are cooled off, I dipped them in a mixture of heated cider/maple syrup, then coated with sugar.  Extra yummy!

These were addictive! I made donuts and donut holes. I followed the recipe almost to a tee...I did double it and added 1/4 tsp of vanilla just to make them that much better. I glazed and used cinnamon sugar...yumm-o

So good!  I didn't add the cinnamon and nutmeg to the dough because we wanted to add different toppings.  We coated some in cinnamon sugar, topped others with a chocolate glaze and left a few plain.  They were all delicious and extremely quick to make.  We will be making these again soon!

We quadrupled the batch because we have a large family of 9. We got some nice sized doughnuts and the batch made 3dz doughnuts with 3dzn doughnut holes to to with them.  I glazed half and powdered the other half with a powdered sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg mix.  They turned out wonderfully and this will be a nice new family recipe for us.  Cooking time for this though took longer due the quantity, but we had an assembly line going. ;)

Awsome, I have never made donuts before and these where great. I made them for my father in law and added about a 1/4 cup of finely choped walnuts like they did when he was a little boy. He loved them so much that he took the rest home with him. Thank you soooo much for the really easy recipe. Memenpratt

These were great it was my first time making donuts and they turned out perfect.  everyone loved them. I didnt change anything other than i increased the cinnamon to 1 full teaspoon.  I dont know how to check my oil temp so i just had the burner stay on medium heat and that worked really well.

this is a funnel cake disguised as a donut!  they are really good when cooked but i found the dough impossible to work with...it was too sticky and made a huge mess of me and my counter...i even used gloves to try to prevent that...didn't help!  i followed the recipe exactly and ended up adding alot more flour and refrigerating the dough overnight!  it helped a little...i made donut holes and used powered sugar...just like a funnel cake!

This recipe is wonderful!! Yes, it does start as a gooey sticky mess. Scoop it onto a pile of flour to knead a few times then flour well to roll out. They're tender and delicious. I got about 14 and the kids devoured them. I used a maple-flavored glaze. They did cook very quickly but I'm not sure of the temp since I just used the stove. Definately a new favorite recipe. I love how fast and easy these are.

This recipe is so good and very easy.  I followed the directions exactly and the doughnuts turned out great.  I made them with regulat flour for my kids and with gluten free flour for myself.  I froze the left overs and when reheated in the microwave taste just like they were freshly cooked.  I have made this recipe twice now.  The first time I made the dough 1/4 inch thick and to me it seemed too thin.  The next time I made the dough about 1/2 inch thick and it made thicker doughnuts.  They cooked in the 3 mins. called for in the recipe.  The flavor of the doughnuts is really good too.  Thanks for posting such an easy and good tasting recipe.  Will definitely make these again and again and again!!!

I'm not sure what went wrong, but when I made this the dough came out really sticky. I followed all the directions exactly, so I thought that it was supposed to be a bit sticky, and so tried to work with it that way. I wasn't able to make doughnut shapes due to that, so instead just dropped spoonfuls of the dough directly into the oil. The flavor was good, and it turned out lightly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The next day they were really soft, but still tasty. I think next time I might try adding more flour to make it work better.

Tasty, though not a doughnut. These were very flat and flaky. I still ate them because they tasted okay, like a crispy funnel cake.

simply wonderful.  I didn't have anything to cut the doughnut shapes, so I made the round doughnut holes by pinching off dough and rolling in the palms of my hands.  Came out GREAT!  From beginning to end (ncluding cunsumption)only took forty minutes. This method made 32 small round doughnut...purfect size for little hands. Thanks a bunch...we have a new favorite snack.

This is a great recipe has been around for many years. It gets easier the more you make them...practice makes perfect. I think I have made these a hundred times with my mother and sisters, then with my children and now with my grandchildren. Its a recipe you can add more or less spices, change the toppings and eat hot or cooled. They are great around Halloween with apple cider. You don't need a deep fryer, just use the largest pot you have and adjust how much oil you use and how many donuts you cook at a time. Yes... lots of fat and calories but that's what makes it a treat!

It was awful.
1. It was bland tasting
2. After I fried them the outside was just perfect, golden and delicious looking, however, when I cut it in half, surprise surprise it didn't cook at all. Just dough inside.
Waste of all those ingredients
I expected cake doughnuts, but they were unlike doughnuts at all

I grew up visiting a doughnut shop that made the most fabulous cake doughnuts. This is a good recipe, but didn't stack up to the standard I was comparing it too. Overall, an okay doughnut. Nothing bad to say, just not as good as I was hoping it would be.

Not bad.  Added extra cinnamon and used fresh ground nutmeg.  Also subbed about 1/3 c rapadura for the white sugar and used half freshly ground whole wheat flour.  Fried in lard.

I love this recipe, I am going to attempt a slight alter to make Chocolate doughnuts.  I am having trouble finding a good Chocolate cake doughnut.  Best doughnut recipe I have cooked yet though.

It was so sticky I couldn't even shape the donuts because the dough would get stuck to my hands... I really didn't like it, and the donuts came out looking like crud because of it.

I just made these doughnuts over the weekend! I used half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat flour, kicked up the spices a bit, had to add a bit more milk due to the whole wheat flour but they turned out wonderful! I rolled the doughnuts out too thin at first and they didn't turn out great, but the second time I rolled the dough out I made them thicker and they were perfect!
My husband and son ate them ALL up! YUP, thats right 2 people ate them all! Well, I have a few myself. :)

These doughnuts are pretty good did not realize ho much people like cake doughnuts. Idid add a little more nutmeg and cinnamon. I used the creamy glaze. Next time will make them just a little bigger. This one stays in my recipe book, thanks for sharing.

They where very chewy and didn't taste anything like donuts they taste more like Bagels which where very good.  I toasted them and they where delicious the only reason I gave a low rating is bc it states that it's plain cake doughnuts and they aren't they are bagels all they are missing is the raisins.

I made these as donut holes, flavor was ok, but I had my oil too hot and ended up burning them....kinda plain flavor on the ones that weren't burnt.....not anything fancy...but perhaps if recipe were tinkered with could be better...

I am giving this a 4 star review but almost gave it 3 stars. The golden doughnuts tasted pretty good. I must have done something wrong. I guess i let the grease too hot, but also the dough was hard to work with. It was too sticky and kept sticking to my fingers. tried to use a doughnut maker, but dough wouldn"t go thru it. I made a big mess, but the ones that didn't completely burn tasted pretty good. i used confectioners sugar on the outside. I'll try again, maybe!

Great recipe. Easy peasy. Completed the task from start to finish in the alloted 25 mins. I had a bowl with sugar and cinnamon mixture in it to receive the donuts as they came out of the oil; next time I might let them cool a bit and dip them in a glaze....with Bundy rum in the glaze! My husband will think he has died and gone to heaven! BTW, everyone said these were better than store bought.

I really didn't care for these. The addition of cinnamon gave these  a weird taste. If I would try these again, which I doubt I would do, I would cut out the cinnamon. I even shook them in a bag of powdered sugar while they were still hot. Didn't help.

OMG...this donut was so GOOD. It didnt take ling to fry keep you eye on them when making these in a pot of oil. thats what I used because I dont have a fryer. Its cakey if you like that texture which I love. You can go to town to decorate them how ever you like. I like mine simple with powder sugar but I will make these with different ingrediance. You can also fill them to which I alsco plan on doing one day. Its very enjoyable.

These need to be rolled a little thicker and I also found them to be slightly salty.  But  they do taste very good, even 2 days old.. unlike yeast donuts that tend to taste very dry.

I have never made donuts before but thought this recipe was super easy and very good.  Like some other reviewers, we added flour when rolling out and punched up the spices a little bit. They were light (for cake doughnuts) and crispy and not a bit greasy.  We added a simple glaze with powdered sugar and milk, but they were equally good without it.

This was my first time making doughnuts by myself, and they came out wonderfully! My roommates loved them, and have requested I make them for our next party. I made a few recipe changes that made the doughnuts a little healthier (despite the fact that they're deep-fried): I substituted 1/3 of a cup of applesauce for the egg, used almond milk instead of milk, and used whole wheat flour. They were vegan and delicious! And - for the record - my roommates are not generally healthy eaters, and are far from vegan. So their praise is significant!

The actual donut come out good once I got the frying temperture correct. At least first they were cooking too fast.
I decided to use powdered sugar instead of cinnamon & sugar. They were fine while fresh but later the oil started comiing through the sugar and they became a soggy mess.If you stick to the recipe you probaly will be fine.

I will definitely use a little more butter or milk in these to make them a little moister.  The flavor was excellent, and the cooking time was right-on. (I, however, overcooked a few and they still turned out great)  After draining them well on paper towels, I shook them in a baggy of cinnamon and sugar.  Next time I will try making some with powdered sugar, and also will try substituting half of the white flour for wheat.

Loved this-so easy. Just needed to add a little more flour cuz it was kind of gooey. I dipped in cinnamon and sugar mix once they cooled. My kids went nuts. We can have cider mill donuts year round with this recipe!!! A fun ida that I did with the kids was used a cookie cutter and cut out shapes. Was fun and different than plain old round donuts.

My mother and I made this recipe one night while craving doughnuts and found it very easy to make.  We followed the directions and only added vanilla flavoring.  We left some of the doughnuts plain and added powdered sugar to the rest.  I would definitely make these again!!

This was my first attempt at making doughnuts and they were delicious.  Like others, I also found dough sticky so I kept adding flour to surface and my hands (probably another cup worth of flour).  I made doughnuts and holes. After removing from pan, I sifted confectioners sugar on some and brown sugar and cinnamon on others.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks Jennifer!

My husband has been wanting me to make homemade doughnuts for a long time, so I chose this recipe because of the previous reviews and it looked really easy. The doughnuts were very good, and got rave reviews from my husband! I sprinkled plain sugar on them for him, and cinnamon/sugar for the kids. Very tasty :) Also, when I made the recipe, it occured to me that you really don't need a doughnut or biscuit cutter at all. Just take a bit of the dough and roll it into a rope about 6-8". Make it into a doughnut shape and then use a dab of water to stick the ends together. I cooked a few like that and they turned out just as good as rolling the dough and cutting with a doughnut cutter.

This was my first attempt at making donuts, and I chose this recipe for its simplicity. My son and I made them together; it was easy, fun and they turned out wonderfully. They browned to a pretty color, and were very good with a cinnamon sugar coating.

This was my first attempt at doughnuts- they were pretty good, a little more greasy that I like.  It was a long process but I made quite a few - I am sure that if I keep trying they will get better

I am new to baking I think its cool to take these separate ingredients and turn them into something good.  I tried these donuts and found they were easy to make and they came out very good. I covered them with powdered sugar.  I am not sure if I should have let them cool before I covered them or cover them while they are hot.  I tried both and they both had problems. but both tasted good.

I searched forever trying to find a simple donut recipe and this was perfect. I ended up adding an extra shake or two of nutmeg and cinnamon to the dough and did not add any extra flour like other reviews suggested. I placed it in the fridge to chill a bit so it didn't stick so much to my hands and it rolled out perfectly. Great recipe! :)

I followed instructions to the tee. Fairly easy to make. If you are not putting on a glaze, add just a little more sugar.

I made these as written, with just a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg, and rolled them in cinnamon sugar (also with a bit of nutmeg). Delicious!! Not nearly as heavy as cake donuts you would buy at the grocery store or even the donut shop. Light and fluffy! I will say that 375 degrees may be WAY too hot ... the "test strips" I fried turned black within seconds. However ... there is always the possibility that my new (and first) deep fryer is defective. The oil at 375 was smoking. When the oil cooled a bit, I continued frying and they were perfect. What a treat! I highly recommend testing the oil temperature with the scraps of dough that remain after rolling and cutting. And ... I had NO issues with sticky dough as some have experienced. It was very easy to work with.

I made this recipe only slightly altering the spices for personal preference. The cakes had good flavor, however, I found them too dense. They aren't as light as other cake donuts I have eaten before and prefer. Yes, cake donuts are denser than yeast donuts but shouldn't, in my opinion, be as dense as these are.  Ease of making/cooking wasn't bad. Easy enough to do even for youngsters with guidance, especially when using hot oil.

Great donut!   This was the 1st time I have ever made let alone fried a donut - easy to make and using suggestions made by other reviews - I increased the cinnamon to a 1/2 tsp and the nutmeg to a 1/4 tsp - I used the donut holes to make sure oil was at the correct temp for frying and I found 360 degrees was perfect.  The dough was extremely sticky so I made sure my counter was well floured and then I turned the dough over and made sure my rolling pin was well floured too.  Spot on donut - will make these again!

Very fast for donuts!!

I just finished up a batch of these donuts and they are VERY good.  I did NOT have a problem with too much flour.  I monitored the oil temp before each batch and they cooked to a golden brown perfection!   I’m going to post a photo of “naked donuts”. 

The only modification I made was doubling the cinnamon (it is still just a light cinnamon taste, which is what I wanted) and I substituted mace for the nutmeg, which is a traditional donut spice.  If you don't eat the donuts right away, the cinnamon taste will get stronger as they "age".

I rolled the dough out to just over ¼ inch and I used a 3 inch cookie cutter ring and a 1½ inch cutter for the center hole.

 To help with the mess of rolling out the donuts (or pie crusts, etc.) I dampen the kitchen island counter (2 foot wide) with a wet paper towel, then I stick plastic wrap to the counter.  I don’t know how this would work on a long flat counter surface, but you can try it, just make sure the counter is lightly damp before applying the plastic wrap.

I think they were absolutely amazing!I used buttermilk instead of regular. I also added a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg. I got worried at first because the batter wouldn't get smooth when mixing, but when they cooked they worked out fine. I used the bottom of a small cup to cut them as I don't have doughnut or buscuit cutters, and I used a soda cap for the centers, which I dipped in flour before cutting. As other reviewers had mentioned, I had to add more flour to get the right dough consistancy. I ran out of all-purpose flour so I mixed it with some Gold Medal "Better For Bread" flour. The doughnuts came out lightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Sooooo good!! I made the recipe for "Texas Frosting" on this site to frost them and topped with sprinkles. My son and I also made a vanilla glaze. Yummm!

I followed the recipe exactly as written with one exception, several other raters said to flour liberally so you could work with the dough as it was sticky. I was going to try to do it without flour but i couldnt even get it out of the bowl it was sticky. I floured my surface & best I could rolled it out. Then came the task of trying to get it off the board & into the pan of oil. I had to use a spatula as it stuck to my hands. I cooked them & they fell apart in the pan, they had ZERO resemblance of a donut at ALL. The finished product looked like a fish fry not donuts. I was hoping after all the hassle work ingredients & oil I used up that they would at least taste good. I usually buy a can of buiscuts & cut holes in them to make homeade like donuts for the family but I thought I would step out of my comfort zone & do homeade but never again.

These were so good and so easy, my four year old helped make them. We served them dusted with powdered sugar, and some rolled in cinn sugar, we prefer the cinn/sugar. My husband and i agree that this would make a great treat in the fall when we go to either the pumpkin patch or the Christmas tree farm, served with hot apple cider as someone else suggested. I will make these again. The only negative thing that i can say is i think they needed a little bit more cinnamon and or nutmeg, and the dough was super sticky both easily fixed though.

I had SUCH a disappointment with these.  Very wet batter, added more flour.  At 190º, they started to disintigrate before they started to cook, so I upped the heat, but all these babies did was suck up the oil.  The outsides were crunchy, and the insides were honestly oil-drenched.  Gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because Idon't like spoiling peoples' ratings.  Sorry!

Great Recipe. These doughnuts remind of the ones my mom used to make. After reading the previous reviews, I decided to up the amounts of cinnamon and nutmeg and I cut back on the frying time. Besides that, I made exactly as the recipe dictated.

Very good! I too had to use extra flour to make the dough manageable. I also used Allspice instead of nutmeg because I was out, and they were still very yummy. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Oh. My. GOODNESS! This took 2 minutes to mix up and less time to fry! I wanted donut holes, and boy did I get them!

I found the dough the perfect consistency for rolling, needing even less dusting flour than I'd thought. And knowing it would require re-rolling of the scraps anyway, I didn't roll the entire batch out but rather did about 1/3 at a time (which also allows for a good kneading each time to keep the dough together better). So this was really no fuss.

I used a 1-1/4" cutter and this yielded about 30 holes when I halved the batch (I admit, I sampled the raw dough so it might make a bit more).

I will use this recipe CONSTANTLY and try variations. When I figure out the red velvet version and the appropriate cream cheese ganache (I intend to make cake pops) I will share :)

I just made these for the kids and loved them! Yes, as the reviews said...a little more cinnamon, a little flour to knead to right consistency for rolling but all in all just a great recipe. We tossed ours in cinnamon/sugar mixture and glazed some. This will be my go to donut recipe!

These were great to make.  Easy and tasty.  I used only nutmeg because my family does not like cinnamon.  PAY ATTENTION TO THE COOKING TIME.  My first 6 donuts were a little too dark and crunchy, but still ok to eat.  They fry very quick!!  Once I got the frying time down, they were perfect.   I powdered them with powdered sugar; YUMMY!

This is a very good very easy cake doughnut recipe. I replaced the milk with soy milk, and the white sugar with organic semi brown sugar, then cooked them in a non stick doughnut press (sans oil) and they came out great.

Doubled the spices, which helped flavor, but there is too much salt in the original recipe.  Also, rolling the dough to 1/4" made the donuts too thin for my taste.

Just went apple picking and the hubby wanted donuts.  I knew I'd find one here at all recipes.  to make mine 'cider' donuts. i used a packet of instant apple cider powder (single serve size). I put the contents of that packet in the '1/2 cup' measuring cup and topped it off with the regular sugar. No other changes.  A hit with him and my daughter also.  she had to leave the room so she wouldn't eat the whole batch.

Great receipe, like other viewers, I added extra cinnimon and nutmeg. You have to use plenty of flour when forming into donuts! Next time I might fill them with jelly! yum!!!!!

The Donuts were great, I had to add a little more milk to the dough was on the dry side. If the dough is doughy add flour and need the dough then roll the dough out. I agree use more of the spice. Make sure the temp is right 375 to fry doughnuts, so they are not under done or burt doughnuts I put cinnamon & Sugar, Vanilla frosting and some with Sprinks 0n the Frosted Donut. It gave a nice plate preseantation.  Thanks for Sharing the recipe.

Heated the oil in a pot. Mixed flour, sugar, salt, bpowder, pumpkin spice (instead of just plain nutmeg), and cinnamon in a medium mixing bowl. I added the egg with melted butter, mixed again by hand. Then I put a bit of milk in and mixed it, noticed the recipe calls for a lot more milk than needed. Don't just pour the milk in, really mix it and add more as needed. I pulled out a "hole" to test heat and taste, noticed it needed more milk to make it consistent all the way through. So I ended up having to sprinkle more flour on top in oder to pinch out about 1/2 inch diameter balls (instead of rolling it out). It was delicious!

Additionally, I needed to roll to 1/2 inch not 1/4 thickness in order to make a doughnut with decent height.

really good recipe, I excluded the nutmeg and cinnamon and used 1/4 t of vanilla instead still really great!  though I needed to add more flour to my recipe to get the right consistency.  I would recommend this to others!

A yummy quick and simple treat. I like cake donuts rather than the gooey and yeasty types. These turned out light and puffy.  The key is fresh baking powder and really hot oil. I ended up adding a bit more flour into mine (about 1/4 cup) because the dough was a bit sticky. I also used a little apple pie spice mix that I had on hand instead of the listed spices. I rolled them in cinnamon sugar after they cooled a bit.

I wont be making this recipe again. Not sure what the difference is, but this recipe was very crumbly and even after experimenting with different cooking times and temperatures, they always came out saturated with oil.I'll still with my old recipe.

Good donuts.  Maybe a little better without so much cinnamon.  I'd probably just put a dash of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg in them.  The spices became a little too overpowering (I liked them, but my kids didn't as much).  The rest of it turned out great.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose flour.

This is second time of making these and they keep getting better.  In my deep fryer it only two two minutes to ccok these through. While still warm I coated them in cinn/sugar mixture(1/2 C sugar, 2 1/2 T cinnamon) and it really made them amazing.

Omg these were delicious! I too was not successful with these at first, alas! i did not give up. I also tried substituting instead of 1/2 cup milk i did 1/4 cup milk 1/4 cup vanilla yogurt also instead of 1/4 tsp nutmeg i used 1/4 tsp vanilla extract.

Just made these doughnuts and they were great!!  It was quick, easy and made about a dozen and half doughnuts and holes.  Even tried my hand at filling some.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Next time we'll try glazed.  Probably won't by store doughnuts again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These were easy and really hit the spot for what I was craving!  One thing I did add, so that they would remind me more of my Mom's cake doughnuts, was add 1/4 tsp. of mace.  It gave her doughnuts that 'special something.'  I omitted the nutmeg, since mace is quite close in flavor (from the same 'nut').

I give this recipe a 5 for the ease. This was my first time to make donuts and I think they turned out great! I really wasnt able to make donut b/c they dough was sticky and not firm enough; I just make some holes. After putting them on a paper towel for a minute, I rolled them in some cinn/sugar. Delicious!!

I made the dough the night before and used a 1oz cookie scoop to make doughnut holes per someone else's review.  Well 1oz was WAY to big & in order to not end up w/ raw dough in the middle I had to burn the outside.  I ended up make 1/2oz balls and even still the outside ended up very crunchy by the time the middle was cooked. I rolled them in cinnamon/sugar mix however they were sweet enough plain.  If they weren't so done on the outside they would have been perfect.  I will be trying other recipes before I come back to this one.

I've made doughnuts before and while there were good, they were not as good as other cake doughnuts.  I get that this is a basic recipe, but even still there was something missing.

I made doughnut holes instead of regular donuts...they are a bit greasy. I added a tsp. of vanilla, and am glad I did but these aren't that great...even my toddler doesn't like them much. I ended up throwing away 2 dozen of the uncooked holes because I just don't think they're worth the effort.

I thought this recipe was fine as is.  They remninded me very much of the dougnuts that my mom made when I was a kid. I'd never made doughnuts before and these were easy and took no time at all. I did the same in rolling mine in cinnamon and sugar when they cooled off. If you are looking for a PLAIN recipe, then this is a good one to start with.

These were a lot of work. They were good but.... I think I would rather just buy them. It would be so much easier for me. The bakery donuts taste better than these too.Sorry:(

Not bad. I only gave it 4 stars because I have a recipe that I like better but that has to be chilled for 2 hours, so I gave this a try. It is a quick and easy recipe but I measured everything out exactly and I found the dough too sticky so I had to add extra flour but after that they molded fine and tasted pretty good, I dusted them with powdered sugar and the kids devoured them.

These were much easier than I thought doughnuts would be. I made these as Timbit sized (doughnut holes to those of you not from Canada) and rolled them in cinnamon sugar. The entire batch was devoured within the day. And I have been asked if I would make them again...a lot!

I wanted doughnuts but sweet things don't agree with me in the morning so... I used splenda in place of the sugar. I dusted them with splenda and cinnamon. My husband and kids had them about gone before I finished making coffee :) Will be making again!

These were excellent, especially when coated with cinnamon-sugar!  We even fried up the doughnut holes!  They tasted just like the fresh doughnuts we get at the cider mill in the fall.  With fresh coffee, this was the perfect Saturday breakfast - even our curmudgeonly next-door neighbor wanted some!

I followed this recipe to a T but the dough turned into one gooey wet mess.  I had to add at least another 1/3 cup flour and that is not including the flour it soaked up while I was trying to knead it.  I used a tsp amount of dough to make doughnut holes and dropped them into the fryer to cook for 4 minutes.  These tasted ok, my daughter thought it was fun to roll them up and roll them up in powdered sugar but they were kind of a pain to make (maybe all doughnut dough is a pain) but I could really taste the cinnamon and a hint of nutmeg.  I will look elsewhere for a doughnut recipe next time.

These were DELICIOUS!  They were SO easy to make, it didn't even take me 25 minutes as the recipe said.  I didn't have any nutmeg but I made an eggnog glaze to put over them and it was amazing.  They stayed crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  I will make these again for SURE!

Very good recipe! Simple, and the donuts turn out wonderful. I actually just ate most of them plain, but powder sugar and honey does make it all the better. Family loved them.

The donuts were delicious. The cooked up nice and fast so I could surprise my children with hot donuts when they woke up during summer vacation.  I even made a chocolate glaze for some, for my chocoholic daughter. Yummy!

The flavor was good, but did anyone else have problems with the dough being way too moist?  We had to add a ton more flour and it was still moist and sticky.  Way too sticky to knead or roll out.  Once we did get a decent consistency, the taste was great!

I made these in a deep fryer.  I ended up making 6 really fat doughnuts instead of 12.  Way too thick for my taste, but that was my fault, not the recipe.  The taste was a little bland.  Maybe next time I would add cocoa to make chocolate doughnuts, or a little vanilla.

I normally make the yeast risen type doughnuts, but not having the time or extra flour, I decided to try this recipe. Let me just say I am glad I ventured  to try this one. I love it!  I should have known when the first step in the recipe states to heat the oil, that it would go much faster than my normal 60-90 minute wait time..This is the best recipe for ingredients,time and taste. and speaking of taste..I was a bit skeptical of how they would taste, but I had nothing to worry about, these are great! Thank you Jennifer for sharing this great recipe! I made doughnuts, donut holes and benets and they barely were cooled enough to eat when the last one was going, going, GONE! :)

First time ever attempting donuts. Very easy, very tasty...we did double the cinnamon to a 1/2 tsp. They were great without frosting or extra sugar!

Very good base recipe. I’ve made these as written and I’ve modified them. I can’t have dairy anymore, so I just made them with margarine and oat milk and the texture was still perfect. I also add more cinnamon and a LOT more nutmeg (1/2 teaspoon of each) and roll them in granulated sugar after they come out of the fryer. Yum!

This worked very nicely. Dough easy to roll, lovely crisp outside when done. Could maybe use just a little more sweetness. I might add an extra bit of sugar the next time I make it.

Worked great and easy to make by hand without a mixer like some other recipes seem to require. I don’t have a deep fryer so I did them one at a time in a small pot to conserve oil and did my best to regulate temperature. Would add a little less sugar next time as I prefer them very “plain.” Made my family very happy this morning!

This is my first time making Dough and Doughnuts. It was really Easy and they were good. Yes they aren’t the fluffy Yest kind but amazing all the same. I realized after I started making it I didn’t have Nutmeg and so I added another Teaspoon of Cinnamon. Because it was my first time I decided made all the doughnuts dark in color to be sure they cooked all the way. My brothers cut the Doughnut shape from Mason Jar Lids and the Doughnut holes we made from Baby-food container.

These turned out fantastic! I just LOVE  making these doughnuts! A tip: don't use lactose free milk. I tried to make these the second time around without the lactose so my sister could enjoy them; but, they turned out tasting horrible!

This was my first time making doughnuts and I was somewhat apprehensive going in.  I was not disappointed!  I followed the instructions to the letter and had no problems.  I used a deep fryer and only cooked two at a time.   I did put some store-bought frosting on them after they were done, but  with the cinnamon and nutmeg they taste good without any extras.

Definitely best with just a simple cinnamon sugar coating.  Don’t need full 3 minutes on oil. 2 or less.

My husband loved these!!  We do  not roll in sugar, glaze  etc. as we like them plain.I follow the recipe exactly.  I have made these several times and my only problem is getting the oil temperature just right. I use a cast iron skillet and check the temp.of my oil before each batch I'm  frying.  If making more than one recipe I have found I need to change my oil  after one recipe as it is too dirty.  I probably should invest in a deep fryer to solve my problem.  Eventually I will get this down to an art. LOL, Thank you for sharing this recipe .

Made these for the first time Christmas morning, there wasn’t a crumb left! Everyone loved them. I had to make them again for my 8 year old son the next morning! Just made them a 3rd time for my nephews who slept over last night. They requested glazed, cinnamon sugar and plain, and I’m happy to oblige. These are super easy and delicious. Enjoy!

This was my first time making donuts and these were delicious. I don't have any cutters so I just dropped small spoonful of dough into deep fryer and it worked perfect. Thanks for the easy recipe. My husband also loves these yummy little bites.

**2nd time making. Perfect. I used 3/4 c. sugar, 1 t. vanilla and 1/2 t. cinnamon.  Needed no sugar dusted on top. ***

Orig: The recipe I've been looking for - yay.  We used to get plain donuts from this local market years ago and it's been long gone and we still think of the donuts...  these are as close as I'm going to get according to husband.  Did add a little more cinnamon and nutmeg, and also about .5-1 t. vanilla.  I might add more sugar to the mix, as I like them plain, and I did have to dust a tad powdered sugar on them so will try with more sugar in the mix next time.  Thanks for this recipe!

I've made raised donuts for years but never cake donuts. However, that will change because these were delicious and easy. Plus they don't require raising. I made them for an annual neighborhood donut party where there were hundreds of raised donuts, and mine were the only cake donuts. The cake donuts were a bit hit! I like that they have some spice and some sweetness; I also like the cake texture.

A few notes. As others suggested, I increased the cinnamon and nutmeg, and I also added some vanilla. And I rolled them out a bit thicker than just 1/4 inch. Other than that, I followed the recipe as is and had no problems. I will say that I was surprised to not get more donuts from the recipe. I made a double batch and ended up with only about 3 dozen donuts plus holes. Next time I will know what the yield is.

We served a variety of glazes with all of the donuts--vanilla, orange, chocolate, maple, and mixed berry. All worked well with these donuts.

Nice simple cake donuts recipe, very filling. My family enjoyed it and I will make again. People need process what they read. It is an old fashion cake donuts recipe, not a yeast one. I knew it.

They were ok but nothing like I expected. I watched the temp closely and they still browned a lot quicker than 3 minutes as the recipe stated. Flip after 30 seconds and they’re done in about a minute.

I followed the recipe as instructed.  Only change I made was the flour which I added 1/4 cup more.  I beat the egg, added the melted butter and used milk with 2 tsp. of lemon juice.  The dough came out slightly sticky, but floured the parchment paper and just pressed out the dough.  Using doughnut cutter, I got fifteen doughnut and 15 doughnut holes.  Made icing using 2 tablespoon of melted butter, 1 cup powdered sugar, and milk as needed.  I added 1/2 tsp. of citrus flavoring.  Dipped the fried doughnuts and got the glaze needed to put them over the top!  Awesome!!  Family loved them! By the way, they were not heavy or dense. They are just right on.

I increased the cinnamon a bit and rolled them in cinnamon sugar.  Good!  I think my oil was a bit too hot for 3 minutes so the first ones came out a little hard.   Probably will go a minute and a half each side next time.

As another reviewer suggested, I added flour to help these roll out, and used more cinnamon and nutmeg. They were absolutely delicious.

Really easy. They puff right up from the 1/4 inch you rolled. Very good. I put in extra nutmeg but couldnt really taste it. I was wishing my fryer went higher that 375   thinking they may not come out so greasy if they cooked faster.

Thanks for this simple recipe. I never made my own donuts before, but was looking for a good, easy dessert for which I could use ingredients already in my poorly stocked kitchen. Other than needing to substitute half&half for the milk, I had all I needed to make these (well, no deep fryer, either, but a large, deep skillet and lots of oil...). I am still letting most of them cool down, but what I've tasted so far is so good! I was like a little kid when they plumped up, I was so proud that I actually made them right! I'm glad they aren't too sweet, not too anything, just right for cake donuts.

I have made these twice now and both times they were excellent. But the second time around I did add more cinnamon and nutmeg which really enhanced the flavor. Either way they were quick and easy and delicious!

I followed another reviewer's advice to use a cookie scoop and make "drop doughnut holes" rather than true doughnuts.  They were predictably not so pretty,  with a heavy crust that absorbed a lot of oil. Still yummy, though! Since that method saved me the trouble and mess of rolling them out and adding floor, I was very happy with the change. It was fairly easy and quick, for a weekday breakfast treat! 

I heated the oil on medium, with a thermometer in at all times to keep an eye on it.  I would set each batch (4-5 "holes" at a time in my medium-sized pot) on paper towels briefly to drain,  then tossed half the "holes" with cinnamon sugar in a brown paper bag, and sifted powdered sugar over the other half. Everyone enjoyed them! Thanks for the recipe. :-)

I added more nutmeg definitely more than a dash and it's just the taste I was looking for.

These were amazing! It was my first time making doughnuts, and it went extremely well. We dipped them in cinnamon and sugar instead of putting the cinnamon in the doughnuts, and they were heavenly. Would definitely make again!  The only annoying part was that the dough was SO sticky, and was extremely hard to get off my hands. Would definitely use a lot more flour.

I have made this twice now! First time I used too much flour and I over worked the batter. The donuts were still yummy but didn't rise very much due to the over working of the dough.

Well.....Ginny the lady reviewer....i would like to say we all have our own opinions on recipe's, now i am a fab cook so many people say lol never ever made donuts...well....STODGEY!!! wasnt near it...omg added flour..more flour...was worried they would be too cakey all the flour but it does need it! anyways couldnt cut them out impossible and they stuck to the floured parchment paper (cant make them in advance!!) i rolled them in to a long thin sausage and than joined the ends together and not too thick i shallow fried them and   tossed em in a bag of sugar and nutmeg and the kids said  they was ok but def not donuts more like churro's, wont make again sadly but look for  a better recipe! If your going to put donut in the title expect some negative feedback!!

I just made these -- first try at doughnuts -- and they are fabulous.  I halved the recipe because we are only 2 eaters.  The dough came out a bit wet but I kneaded in a little more flour.  I made them  with nutmeg, vanilla and lemon zest in the dough, and a thick lemon glaze on top.  I also made a vanilla glaze and put chocolate sprinkles on those. I think you could do whatever flavors you like!

Great, easy, and good. One thing...after you pull them from the fryer put them on a cooling rack with a paper towel below. Putting them directly on the paper towel tends to make the bottoms a bit gooey.

First time donut maker, wanted to try a basic recipe.  This one looked good.  I made this exactly as listed.  Dough was not even close to being workable so I added extra flour until it was firmer, maybe 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup extra.  Donuts turned out good, texture wise.  Flavor I thought wasn't quite sweet enough, certainly not bad, but next time I am going to bump it up to 3/4 cup sugar.  Coating in cinnamon and sugar after frying helped bring the sweetness factor up.  Overall, I was happy how they turned out for a first time donut maker, definitely worth trying again, with those minor changes.

Wonderful recipe I did have to add about 1/2 extra flour maybe because I had extra large eggs.  My family loved them!

The donuts taste great. I would strongly recommend adding flour to the recipe in the beginning. I kept adding flour as I kneaded the dough but it took several additional tablespoons to make it workable. I had not read the comments before I made it, but it seems like others are in agreement. These are exactly how cake donuts are supposed to be. The only thing I would wish for in this recipe is an updated "right" amount of flour to keep the batter from sticking to everything.

These are amazing cake donuts! Followed the recipe exactly, and I'm eating them as fast as they're coming off the stove. Super easy and so far they're great plain, and dipped in both regular and powered sugar!

Omg!!!! I have tried SO many donut recipes and each one left me disappointed. And my husband sad because of the wasted money. This recipe is not only the best one I have found online but also the best cake donuts I've ever had period. I've been craving them all week. I added extra cinnamon and nutmeg as others suggested and omg just flavor explosion. If you are on the fence about trying this recipe out don't be. I promise these are the best.

So easy to make.  This was my first time to attempt to make donuts. Followed the recipe to the T. I used my kitchen aide mixer to mix.  I noticed the dough was very sticky.  I debated adding a little more flour, but resisted.  I took a plate (for easy clean up) lightly floured it. Patted the sticky dough on the plate, turned and flattened out with my fingers. This seemed to take away the stickiness to the outer surface.   Used a pill bottle lid to cut the hole.  Laid in hot grease and cooked away.  Turned out great.  And it didn't matter that I didn't roll but pressed with gathered fingers.  Looked round enough.  Tastes great!  I only cooked what we would eat and threw the extra dough out. So I don't know how the next day's taste.

I had to use applesauce instead of butter because I was out of butter.  It was okay but not great.  I will try it again with butter because that will probably make a big difference.

This was great! I split the batter and put coco powder in one.  The cinnamon bunch was a bit sticky, and I put some more flour in the mix. That was my fault though. I'm about to bake them. I'll also put glaze on them.

Quick and easy. Not too sweet. They browned very quickly in the oil so you have to watch them closely. Taste and texture a bit like funnel cake. My kid tried it plain, dipped in powdered sugar, with Hershey syrup on top, or with melted chocolate on top. His favorites were the ones with Hersheys syrup and with melted chocolate on top. For the melted chocolate, I used Vermont Nut Free milk chocolate candy melts. You just melt them in the microwave and spoon them over the top of the donut.

This is exactly what I was looking for. It's easy and turns out perfectly. I did doughnut holes since I don't have a cutter, so they took less time in the oil. Crunchy, but still soft and fluffy on the inside. This will be my go to recipe!

Easy, quick. My family loved them. The only thing I did differently was to add the milk slowly at the end until the dough was the right consistency. Solved the problem of the dough bring too sticky.

Originally i made these for my two boys as a reward and they loved them as much I did. I made them into little doughnut balls because it was easier for them to eat and my husband had some left over the next day and said they are great as a quick breakfast with some syrup like a pancake. I'm definitely using this recipe again.

I read and tried many types and flavors of doughnuts as I am new to baking and doughnuts are my favorite empty carb decadent treat. I have made all types of breads,cinnamon rolls,cakes,fudge and I have taken from one recipe and added to a part of another recipe and just using common sense and some of the info that I have read about and watched videos about.I am pretty confident at this point in my abilities in making just about everything that I have worked on over the past few years,but then came doughnuts and I have made more failures by far than successes. I made this after reading many reviews and added a bit more cinnamon,nutmeg,sugar etc. I used to make the mistake of adding too much flour as many new bakers do but I did not do it this time but I did let the dough sit covered in the bowl after just combining the ingredients and then put the dough in the fridge for 20 min. or so and they came out great. I dusted a few with powdered sugar and some basic vanilla glaze for a few.Thank you for posting.

These donuts came out great. They are light and fluffy and just the right sweetness. I did find the dough difficult to deal with. My first couple donuts weren't very pretty. I finally decided to put everything on hold and refrigerate the dough for ten minutes. Then I only used a quarter of the dough at a time and left the rest in the refrigerator. I  heavily floured my countertop, the dough and my cutter before gently patting the dough to a thickness of half an inch.  I gently removed the cutout dough and blew the excess flour off of it.  The dough is extremely moist,  which it needs to be for moist donuts. I suspect this recipe was originally made to go in a donut dispenser. I would recommend trying one if you have it. I paired the cooled donuts with Alton Brown's chocolate donut glaze.

I love cake doughnuts and this recipe is so simple! This was the first time I made doughnuts and this was so easy. I increased the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon and the nutmeg to 1/4 teaspoon as many had said they needed more this was just right. I rolled them in cinnamon and sugar and my family loved them! A definite must try.

It reminded me of the cake donuts I would get from the mom and pop shops in New England.  I could tell from reading the recipe that it didn't have enough spice,  I increased the spice to 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ground cloves.  You need to fry them until really brown to get them to cook all the way through and to get that nice crunch.  If you don't have a donut cutter, a margarita glass and a shot glass makes a great substitute for a really big donut.  Makes six large donuts cutting them this way.

Great recipe. I made these as a birthday treat for my son's Grade 1 class and as one child is allergic to dairy (except eggs)I swapped almond milk for the milk and used margarine instead of butter - worked perfectly. :)

This receipe is 100% right.  These are very similar to the sourdough doughnuts from Tim Horton's in Canada.  I did not change a thing except I did put a little more butter than called for.  Sprinkle with a little sugar and way to go.  Awesome!

I needed a bit more flour as per the warnings in other reviews and also used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and nutmeg. I also baked mine. And they were fantastic!

Admittedly this was my first attempt at donuts. I followed the recipe exactly except that I made donut holes instead of donuts. Out of the fryer it took me a few attempts to get them cooked all the way through, I think someone else said that it just depends on if the oil stays hot enough. I made them a little too thick at first and once I corrected that, it was fine. I rolled them in cinnamon and sugar when done. I would say the taste was pretty good straight out of the fryer, but they tasted not so great the next day. Not something you can wait to eat. I made these in the evening and they were dry and crumbly the next morning even after being in ziplock bags. Love how simple the recipe is though.

Excellent! Crispy on the outside and actually fairly light on the inside (for a cake donut). Couldn't really taste the spice- maybe sprinkle with cinnamon sugar? Quick and easy. I did flour the surface heavily and chilled for a bit (15 min or so) while I cleaned up and got the fryer and papers ready.

Delicious and addictive! Made two times so far, the first time I halved the recipe but forgot to halve the milk and dough was very sticky. I heavily floured board, hands an roller and kept adding more tablespoon at a time until the consistency was knead able. Still came out wonderful, second time followed measurements exactly and dough was perfect from the start only had to lightly flour board and roller. Again came out delicious, I used the vanilla glaze from this site to top. Absolutely addictive!

This was my first time making donuts at home. It was a pretty good recipe- except for the fact that I had to use a lot more flour than the recipe called for. Other than that- the donuts came out tasty and were a delightful treat for my siblings and I.

These were delish! I used plain Greek yoghurt instead of milk and added a little more spice. Rolled them in cinnamon sugar and cannot stop eating them.

I made these with my kids (ages 3 and 4) this morning. The recipe was simple enough that they were able to do some of the measuring and mixing as well as roll out the dough and cut out the donuts. We absolutely loved the flavor. We did run into some problems. I had to add extra flour because the dough came out a little sticky (but then again... a 3 and 4 year old were doing the flour part to begin with! Although I was watching, I turned my back on the second cup of flour, which may not have been full, and I only ended up adding about a 1/4 cup extra). The second problem came with the oil. I used a thermometer to heat the oil to the correct temperature and still ended up getting black, uncooked donuts. So I took the oil off the heat, rolled the donuts even thinner and tried again. They cooked perfectly. We rolled them in powder sugar and cinnamon-sugar. The kids loved them. I will make these again. I will just be more careful with the oil.

They are ok, but I wanted to recreate richer cake doughnuts. Like the blueberry cake doughnut, the only choice that I ever wish to make from a selection of these.  These were pretty plain, not very sweet.  I would not use this recipe again.  I decided that I was looking for something that used buttermilk, sour cream or yogurt in the dough.  I would also use more sugar.

My husband asked me 3 evening in a row to make him donuts.  I searched and searched for a recipe that didn't require yeast because I don't keep it on hand.  I did have to add more flour because it was quite sticky.  I have never made donuts before and didn't have the proper cuters to make traditional donuts so I gave up and rolled small balls.  I was a bit worried that they would taste funny because the only oil I had was olive oil.  After a few test balls to check my oil temp I got it to the perfect temp.  They puffed up great!  Crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy inside.  Shook them in a paper bag with cinnamon sugar.  My husband said they tasted like elephant ears and that they were so good I should sell them.  I never get this sort of compliment!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

These were ok, but not as great as I had hoped reading the reviews. I was concerned the dough would be too wet after many commented on needing to add more flour, so I substituted 1/4 c. Sour cream for half of the milk. The consistency was fine, even a little dry until kneading. The biggest challenge was cooking. If I heated the oil to 375 like the recipe stated, the outside burned immediately while the inside was raw. I finally got the temperature down enough to let them cook longer for the inside, but then they seemed like they'd soaked up a lot of oil as well. Overall, not what I'd hoped for.

This was my first time to make doughnuts.  I followed the directions as stated but also added a bit of vanilla.  These were not the prettiest doughnuts but that was mostly due to my inexperience, not the recipe.  The flavor and texture were spot on.  They were fantastic with a cup of coffee. All told, a winner.  I'm sure with practice, these will be picture perfect.

This was the best recipe for cake doughnuts I have ever found. I made a couple of changes because I wanted to not because it was needed. I added buttermilk in the place of the milk, left out the cinnamon and used 2 tsp. nutmeg. They were the best. Thank you so much for sharing. I will never buy doughnuts again. So easy also!

Took another reviewer's advice and doubled the cinnamon. Otherwise, I made as directed and they came out perfectly. I measured the oil temp between each batch to be sure the oil stayed at 375. These were great as-is. We did not need any coating, just coffee and a plate.

delicious! super easy and my 2 boys loved them! After reading the reviews I added extra cinnamon and nutmeg along with some almond extract just for some additional flavor. I also needed a touch more flour to make a it a workable dough. we made donut holes instead of traditional shapd donuts and it worked perfectly. we will be making these again!

I love cake doughnuts.  This recipe was not was I was looking for.  They were good.  But it tasted more like a fritter to me than a cake doughnut.  Next time I'll just add a cup of chopped apples and have a fantastic apple fritter!

Fun recipe to make, not too messy at all and came together quick.  I did all donut holes.  Made close to 30, I would say.  In ziploc bags I shook on powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar.  We all preferred the cinnamon sugar.

Super-easy, super-delicious, and delightfully fun.  My boyfriend and I made these last night on a whim, and were thrilled with how simple and tasty they turned out.  They're extra yummy with a quick chocolate topping and chopped peanuts!

Awesome! My lil brother and I made them when he spent the weekend and it was so much fun. Very easy recipe with simple ingredients. I will use this when I have a donut craving. I added pumpkin spice and vanilla and I did have to constantly flour my board and I placed dough in the fridge for a few minutes before rolling the dough. They plumped up really nice when frying and were not greasy at all. Thanks!

Good donuts and easy to make. They were light and fluffy, too. I'd add a little more nutmeg. Also, I'm planning to try experimenting with buttermilk for a slightly more tangy and less bread-y flavor. Overall, though, I was happy with this recipe.

Doughnuts to me have always seemed like a difficult thing to make. I decided this morning that I wanted to climb that mountain, I was prepared for it to be cumbersome, long and complicated. This was the first recipe I stumbled across and I have to admit I was shocked at the simplicity of it. I was convinced that something this easy could not turn out well. But I went along with it anyway, thinking all the while that even if it didn't turn out perfectly, its a first attempt and there can always be more. I am more than pleased to say that these turned out wonderfully!!! Though they were not as fluffy as I would have liked they were mighty tasty. I do think that was mainly due to the thickness of the dough. So once my first batch was rolled out and cut out, I re-rolled the remaining dough to about 1/3 of an inch, and I must say that this definately made them a little fluffier. Though keep in mind if you choose to leave them thicker, that they will take slightly more time to cook, though it really isn't much longer. I also made a slight modification. I added to this recipe about 1/2 tsp of vanilla, as they are cakey doughnuts. The vanilla was present, and complimented the cinnamon rather well, without being a main element. I'd say you can go up to a full tsp of vanilla, but no more than that. As well I simplified the coating using only confectioner's sugar on one side once the oil was drained. All in all a great recipe for a first time run. You get my vote, 5/5 stars for this.

These were very simple and easy!  We made them substituting the vanilla for nutmeg, and 1/4 cup vanilla yogurt and 1/4 cup of milk instead of 1/2 cup of milk.  Make sure your oil is not too hot, or they will burn fast.  We found they needed to be a bit thicker to look more like donuts.  Overall, yummy!

I thought these were better as they sat.  I made a powdered sugar glaze and put on them, and the cinnamon flavor came out more after they sat over night.

I thought these were a little dry... maybe more butter would help. The dough isn't too sticky, so long as you flour your board, hands, and utensils really well. The end result was crunchy crust with a slightly dry and chewy interior. It wasn't horrible, but not what I'm looking for. I tried one that was more browned, and one that wasn't as browned, and they were both the same. They weren't greasy at all though, and I made mine into mini donuts. (it makes twice as many!)

While I can see how this would be a good/tasty recipe, I can not rate it the best because the dough was very sticky and hard to work with.  Perhaps I should knead with more flour before adding more to the surface for flattening and cutting. The directions/ingredients should coincide better with regard to adding more flour.  Perhaps I will try  again.
