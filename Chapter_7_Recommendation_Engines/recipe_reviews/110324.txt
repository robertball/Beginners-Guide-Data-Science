This recipe was taught to me by my German/Russian Grandmother. The recipe is fairly accurate but for those who are having difficulty with balls falling apart...you need to add another egg to the batch. Always do a test by droping one or two balls into boiling water before finishing the batch. If the ball floats and does not break apart...take it out and break it with a fork. If it tastes too gummy...add more crumbs to the mixture. If it breaks...add another egg. That's what Grandma taught us!! Also, use very thin spaghetti or fermacelli noodles for best results in replicating original egg noodles for the soup. Chicken stock works great! And season with a dash of Allspice when serving. Enjoy!!!

Complaints here about the butterballs falling apart, I use the following recipe and it works perfect every time. Make sure the bread crumbs are very dry and finely ground.   12 Cups of dried bread crumbs. 2 Cups of melted butter 2 Cups of sweet cream 8 Eggs - (Add more if the mix is too dry after fully mixed) 2 Tsp Salt 4 Tsp Allspice

I was in search of a good "Butter Glac√©" recipe, this one is close but the amount of butter will cause the balls to fall apart.  (I halved it) and I used half-and half cream instead of milk and added pepper too.

This recipes is different from the one I use it calls for 6 1/2 cups of bread crumbs (dry) not toasted do not use the brown ends it makes the balls bitter, and make sure the crumbs are very fine it   makes them better,  and the butter should be sweet cream  butter (real butter) and mine calls for heavy  sweet cream not milk and is heated just to scalding and then pour over crumbs with butter I put the dry ingredients in first then the wet and mine calls for at least 6 eggs and remember that the eggs today are smaller than when this recipes was first made so I started using extra large and I freeze mine on a sheet pan then take out what I need it makes about 70 balls and you can but them in the soup frozen it doesn't hurt them at all and the noodles should be fine not thick think of campbell noodles I use a mexican noodle  and it turn out perfect  I like my recipes better I don't have trouble with them make them every Christmas
