All the ingredients blended well together to have a nice flavor, but it was WAY to citrusy. I would cut it down to 1/4 cup lemon juice and maybe half the zest. It was just way too much. My tongue is still a bit raw. I would make this again but I would definately tweek it a bit.

Like others have said, it has a very strong lemon taste - this may be due to me using bottled lemon juice which is usually *concentrated* in flavor.  I left out the lemon zest.  After simmering for 45 min, I tasted the sauce and thought it was very tangy, so I added grated parmesan and romano cheese to the sauce and chicken and continued to simmer for 15 more min - this did the trick!  It mellowed the lemon in the sauce and helps to thicken it!  This reminded me of some kind of Olive Garden dish.  Other changes that I made was that I lightly floured my chicken breasts before browning - this helped to lightly thicken the sauce to a nice consistency while simmering.  I will definately make this again with 1/2 the lemon juice next time. I would recommend that you give this a try - the dish has a good flavor and smells lovely while simmering!

Great taste if you follow the recommendations and only use one lemon.  Otherwise, it's far too tangy.

This recipe is good but needs an adjustment to the lemon and sour cream amounts.  The recipe calls for 1/2 a cup of lemon juice - as others have recommended I cut that to 1/4 cup and increased the sour cream to 1/2 cup.  If you like a nice lemon taste while not overpowering please do this.  If you prefer just a hint of lemon in the taste though you're going to want to cut the lemon juice down even further - a good juicy lemon gives you a 1/4 cup so if you prefer just a hint of lemon flavor I'd put in half a lemon's worth of juice which should give you the hint of lemon.  I personally liked it with 1/4 cup but I don't think everyone will want the lemon to be that strong in the dish.  You won't have to increase the sour cream again if you don't want because the sauce isn't really thick to start with unless you thicken it with cornstarch or flour.  I served this with potatoes which was good.  If you want to serve with pasta, you'll want to thicken the sauce as it is much too thin even when on the stove for an hour without adding the flour or cornstarch for pasta.

My family really enjoyed this.  I followed other reviewer's suggestions and reduced the lemon juice to the juice of 1 fresh lemon, so about 1/4 cup.  I also added 1 cup of sour cream instead of the 1/4 cup.  It was perfect, not too lemony, but with a definite lemon taste and very creamy.  We enjoyed it over penne.

Like some people recommended, I cut the lemon (even though I LOVE lemon), and it turned out wonderful. Still very lemony, but not overpowering. I couldn't get the sauce to thicken on its own, so I added a little cornstarch, and that worked well. I then tossed the sauce with some penne, and served the chicken on top. Very good, everyone loved it!

decent recipe. I used parsley, oregano, and basil as I am not fond of rosmary or thyme. I also only added 1/4 cup lemon and ommited the lemon zest. I added mushrooms which I sauted in the olive oil and removed before adding onions and added them back in to simmer. I added corn starch to thicken.

Thanks for sharing, this was delicious! Even better the next day. I did take another reviewer's suggestion and added parm cheese and reduced the lemon. I did not use lemon zest or sour cream, but plain FF yogurt instead.

Way too lemony.  Cut way back on that and it might be okay.  Not too impressed.

I thought the lemon flavor was good (but we like a strong lemon flavor), however, the sauce never thickened and I wondered how it was ever going to because there was no thickening agent in the recipe. Also, I found the chicken to be a bit dry - I'm thinking this did not have to cook for an hour (especially at this thickness) - 20 minutes would have probably been enough to cook the chicken and thicken the sauce with added corn starch or flour. When you sear chicken at this thickness for 2 minutes on each side, it would not require to be slow cooked for an hour.

I think it’s delicious but I did something wrong because I thought the sauce was going to be a bit thicker and it seems a bit watery and I added 1 cup of sour cream. Guess over mashed potatoes it’s okay.

As it is, this is a perfectly acceptable recipe for lemon chicken.  It just didn't work for me.  The lemon flavor was too mild for us, and while there was plenty of sauce to pour over noodles, I had to add some extra flavor to improve the sauce.  I added some Parmesan cheese and parsley  flakes, and it was better.  Next time, and there WILL be a next time, I will add more zest, more lemon juice and marinade the meat before I cook it.

Tasted delicious, did't look delicious, though.  I love lemon, so I used the full amount despite what other reviewers said.  Did not have fresh lemon, so I couldn't use the zest.  The picture here with the recipe looks nothing like what I ended up with - the milk and sour cream made it look slightly unappetizing.  I was worried about it curdling with the lemon juice and cooking it for so long, possibly coming to a boil.  But it was fine.  Recipe made a LOT of sauce, and I definitely had to thicken it.  Next time will make pasta as a side to use up the extra.

Like others, I halved the amount of lemon juice and omitted the zest.  I still found it to be ever so slightly too lemon flavored, so I would recommend starting small and working up if you like more tang!  
I made this for two, so I used only two chicken breasts but made the full amount of sauce.  We spooned the extra sauce over rice and it was very good.

The sauce was flavorful, but the chicken turned out quite dry tasting.  I wasn't really too happy with it.

My roomates and I loved this recipie though I halfed the recipie. I made a couple of changes as others suggested. Nixed the lemon zest and used fresh lemon juice not store bought,and doubled the sour cream it turned out great. I will cut the amount of lemon next time though because it was still a little too much lemon.

Like many others I only used 1/4 cup lemon juice, but we thought the chicken had an odd chewy texture after such a long simmer.  I used a light moscoto for a very flavorful sauce.
