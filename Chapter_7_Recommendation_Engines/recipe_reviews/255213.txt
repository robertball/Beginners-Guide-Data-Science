Very good! The addition of the  dill really added a nice freshness to the usual deviled egg, and, of course, you can never go wrong w/ bacon...Thanks for sharing. :)

What a great recipe! The weather today put me in the mood for devilled eggs (and it's only February).  
I loved the original recipe but I did add a touch of granulated garlic and a teaspoon of granulated onion powder.  They are delicious, especially topped with bacon, it's a great accompaniment.
