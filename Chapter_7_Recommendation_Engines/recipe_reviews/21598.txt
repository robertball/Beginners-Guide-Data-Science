Excellent flavor! I really like this combination but I couldn't get it to blend without milk (or liquid of some sort).  I added 1/4 cup milk PER serving and it was SOOOOOO good! Now if someone can tell me how to get the seeds out it would be a hit with my kids!  Maybe next time I will try blending the raspberries first with the milk and then putting them through a strainer.  This one is a keeper - I found cantaloupe out of season; just chop into smaller pieces and blend longer.

This was a good smoothie with a unique taste! Cantaloupe was on sale, so I gave it a try... I used strawberries instead of raspberries and vanilla yogurt vs. plain. Like others, I had to add a bit of half and half to get it to blend.

Absolutely delicious!  I doubled the recipe, but I didn't have any raspberries (or any other berries) so I just used the cantaloupe, yogurt, and sugar, and then added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract.  My daughter and I both loved it.

Really good!  The kids all loved it, and asked for more.  Had frozen raspberries, so it made it thick and creamy.

I think this is only as good as your cantaloupe is juicy and sweet - mine wasn't all that great.  To compensate I tossed in more raspberries (frozen) than called for and used peach rather than plain yogurt.  Left out the sugar at Hubs' request and he was happy with the result.  On the positive side of using not so juicy and sweet cantaloupe, however, I didn't experience the smoothie being watery as others reported.  In fact, I had to add a little half-and-half to get the blender going.  I'm not a big smoothie fan; I make these particularly for Hubs, but I found this lighter, more refreshing than others, most likely due to the mildness of the cantaloupe. Given my cantaloupe's rather bland condition, this was a great way to use it to its best advantage.

I loved this! I ended up using frozen raspberries and vanilla yogurt because that's what I had, so I didn't add the sugar. Plenty sweet without it. I also had to add a shot of orange juice to get things going in the blender - it was very thick, and added an orange umbrella to make myself feel special. Excellent. Thanks for the recipe!

I was worried about the cantaloupe being a little too sweet so I made the recipe without the sugar, then taste-tasted it. The cantaloupe I used was sweet enough so I didn't need the additional sugar. This doubled well for four servings but it wasn't near enough for four people. The combination of the cantaloupe and raspberries was wonderful. I agree with Scotdog that it could use a little vanilla flavoring or vanilla yogurt, like she used. Next time, I'd like to try to make these into frozen yogurt pops--I think that would be heaven.

I love cantaloupe in smoothies, but I always use frozen fruit. I subbed strawberries for the raspberries and vanilla yogurt for the plain. I left out the sugar. Since my fruit was frozen, I had to add some skim milk to get it mixed. I like my smoothies the consistency of thick milkshakes. The cantaloupe adds a lightness that I love, especially starting with a good sweet cantaloupe.

Very yummy!  I used frozen raspberries and also a handful of ice cubes because my husband and I like thick smoothies.  We will make this one again.

Wonderful flavor.  I did have to add a little bit of milk to blend and I substituted agave for the sugar.

Nice flavor.  I'd make it again for sure.  I subbed Van. yogurt for the plain yogurt and left out the sugar.  It was good.  I also used blackberries and raspberries together and liked the result.

This was okay - terribly sweet.  I used blueberries in leu of raspberries or strawberries - maybe that made the difference.  May try again, but would make without the sugar first, and then add only if needed.

Sorry but this smoothie didn't work for me. I didn't like the texture, it was too watery for my taste and I prefer thick smoothies.

I tinkered with the recipe quite a bit...didn't have plain yougurt, so I used lemon yogurt, switched to bluberries and skipped the sugar. Still turned out great!

Made this one with blueberries and vanila jogurt and milk. It was refreshing, not to sweet. Must say when it is very cold it is much better.

This is my favorite smoothie of all that I have made so far.  Loved the combination of cantaloupe and red raspberries.  I have some of these froze ahead for a quick breakfast.  Thanks Penny for a great recipe!

Just what I was looking for! The best smoothie ever, but I added to it. First, I was shy on raspberries, and used about 1/2 c. of them, about 1+ c. of cubed canteloupe. To that I added Greek Yogurt, approx. 1/2 c., 2 T. honey instead of sugar, and about 1/3 c. Silk Almond Milk original flavor. After I served it, I realized that salt would be a great addition. So, I sprinkled a pinch of Fleur de Sel over the top before serving. Next time I may run a lime wedge around the rim and dip the glass in salt before pouring. Think Margaritas! Thanks for the inspirational recipe!!! 

PS. Super sweet canteloupe helps. Mine was perfect.

Super versatile, any close facsimile of the listed ingredients is going to make this work! I was not keen on the idea of white sugar in my smoothie, had some prickly pear cactus syrup on hand and substituted with it. The point is a little sweetness to bump up the flavors, delicious! Who knew? Cantaloupe in a smoothie!

Amazing!  The fruit we used was cantelope, blueberries and frozen raspberries and we also added some ground up oatmeal.  Definitely double the recipe if you're serving to more than one person, as it doesn't make very much.  So good though (even though we didn't make exactly as directed).  Will definitely make again :)

Very tasty!  I only had flavored soy yogurt, used a bit of agave nectar instead of white sugar, added a couple teaspoons of wheat grass powder, and a banana to make it a little thicker. The result - not too runny, not too thick.  Perfect breakfast smoothie!

Surprised how much I actually liked this recipe. My cantaloupe was very ripe, I used 3/4 c cantaloupe bc I was trying to get rid of it, 1/2 frozen strawberrries (all i had), and 1/2 c sugar free vanilla ice cream = 80 cal (also all i had). The smoothie definately had a cantaloupe taste but was not over powering, nice combo with the strawberries. Definately will be making again- I recommend this to anyone who likes cantaoupe but does not like to eat thier cantaloupe very ripe like me.
