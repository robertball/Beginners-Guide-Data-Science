Pretty good.  The flavors are really good, and I love the crunch.  If you don't like crunch in your egg salad, don't bother with this one.  If you do, though, give this one a try.  Very easy, too.  I don't have pickle relish so I just used chopped bread and butter pickles, and I added some celery bc I like it in egg salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow. I am not an egg salad fan, but what else does one do with 5 dozen Easter eggs?  This is worthy of a try.  I didn't have the water chesnuts, but really wish I did.  Instead, I substituted celery & red onion.  I also used 1/2 mayo & 1/2 miracle whip.  I only used 1/2 the mixture, as I prefer the eggs moist.  Delicious on the 1st bite!  I saved the leftover dressing in case I need to add more to the leftovers.  Perfect way to use up some of that paprika my Dad brought me (the non-cooker) back from Hungary.  Thanks Deb!

Well, I went to make deviled eggs for a potluck at work and this time the shells didn't peel off easily; so I had a dozen really ugly hardboiled eggs.  What to do??  Make egg salad!

I never would have thought to put water chestnuts in egg salad but I loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly, and then added chopped celery (because I like it) and ground tumeric (health reasons--the curcumin in it).  I used free pasture eggs, so the yolks were bright orange to start with.  So the addition of  dried mustard, paprika,  and tumeric made for a very interesting dark gold/copper is color!  I think I could have used less mayo--it wasn't runny, but I like my egg salad a little firmer, if that makes sense.  I also should have squeezed the juice out of the relish, or used just chopped picked instead.

I liked the taste!  I put this on gluten-free toast and I loved it.  Good recipe, thank you.  I will make this again.

I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise and increased it to 1/2 c, which wasn't necessary.  I used yellow mustard instead of dry mustard and 1/3 c green olives instead of relish.

I have made a recipe similar to this in the past and loved it. why does the picture have celery in it, but the recipe does not? I know you can substitute, but I'm in the mood to be nit-picky today!!!   :)

I've made it twice as written, except dill, instead of sweet pickle relish.  Loved the flavor.  Loved the crunch.  Will definitely make it again. Also,  I divided it into 3 instead of 2 servings because of the calories.
