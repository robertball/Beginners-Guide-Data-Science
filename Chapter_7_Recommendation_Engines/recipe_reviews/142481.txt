Please don't rate the recipe poorly because you didn't like the changes you made to the recipe. 

I made this soup as a healthy recipe to enjoy for lunch.  Some butter, carrots & some freshly grated parmesan cheese would make this taste even better.  

* I do want to caution others that I used a large head of cauliflower.  I would strongly encourage others to reduce the amount of garlic if they are not garlic lovers and the salt should probably be reduced to 1 teaspoon.  You can always add more later.  I like less broth & more veggies so others may also chose to add more milk & flour if a soupier consistency is desired.  

A medium sized roasting pan or 13"x9" pan is a better fit than the small roasting pan I noted in the recipe as it allows more room to toss.

Jo's Rosemary Bread compliments this meal.  (I add garlic powder & grated parmesan cheese to it.) 

Enjoy!

            ~Jennie

OUTSTANDING! Deserves way more than 5 stars! This is one of the best soups I've tried. If you love garlic and you love cauliflower then you MUST try this recipe. The only suggestion I have is to use a potato masher on the cauliflower after it comes out of the oven,(before you add it to your soup pot.) I used a  dry, white wine in place of the sherry and I think the head of cauliflower I had was exceptionally large, so I had to use an extra splash or two of both the milk and the chicken broth. Just use your best judgement to get the desired consistency you prefer. A very BIG thanks to Jennie for submitting this one; it's a definite keeper!!!

My husband and I found this recipe extremely good.  I did what someone else suggested and cut the salt in half.  I wouldn't make any other changes to it.   It's perfect the way it is!

We LOVE this recipe. I tweaked it a bit. I roasted the cauliflower on 425. I roasted 4 whole garlic cloves with the cauliflower. I only used 1 heaping Tbsp. of flour.  I used skim milk.  I added 2 Tbsp. white wine instead of sherry. I  blended half the soup in a blender, and then once it is all done, at this point, I add a second can of chicken broth. Delicious!

This was a pleasant surprise in that it turned out better than what I had expected, both in taste and in looks! It's nutty flavor is reflected in the slightly brown color.  Mildly sweet, but tempered by the garlic. Roasting the cauliflower gives this incredible flavor. I'm not a fan of nutmeg, so I left it out and didn't notice a loss. I omitted the flour as well, not seeing the need for it. Since I pureed half of the cauliflower and mashed the other half, this was plenty thick without it. The sherry adds a definite flavor dimension that makes this especially good. This cries out, however, for garnish - I reserved some of the roasted cauliflower florets and used them to top each serving along with roasted red pepper and a small sprig of parsley. Beautiful, delicious, and a nice alternative for getting your veggies!

This was fantastic!!!  I used 3 medium heads of cauliflower, 1 cup Almond Breeze (we had no milk), and no butter.  I roasted the cauliflower with cooking spray instead of olive oil and used fresh garlic.  Instead of sherry, I used white wine (about 1/2 cup), and 3 cans of vegetable broth.  I also used 2 onions.  I blended all of the soup--it was fantastic!!  Thanks for the delicious recipe--this is a wonderful way to use cauliflower and is so healthy!!!

I couldn't believe how good this was!  The only change I made was using white cooking wine in place of sherry.  The cauliflower was definitely done in 30 minutes.  It didnt make as much as I'd hoped - three regular (not that big) servings (it must be 6 small cups the recipe refers to). But it was perfectly seasoned and creamy (even though I used 1% milk) - I did blend half after adding the cauliflower. Oh and I did salt to taste, not the full amount. This was my first time having Cauliflower Soup - gotta love health food that doesnt feel like it!

I considered all of the recommendations in the reviews and adjusted to my preferences with outstanding results!  The changes were: 1) Used regular ev olive oil 2) Omitted garlic powder and roasted 6 whole cloves garlic along with the cauliflower 3) Reduced salt to 1 teaspoon since I was using regular chicken broth as opposed to low sodium 4) Used 1 tablespoon flour  It was thick so 1 more can of broth was required along with a tad more milk.  Instead of a regular blender I used a stick-type and pureed all right in the soup pot for less clean-up chores.  Excellente! This is definitely a keeper.

My husband had requested a potato leek soup and I made this one instead but didn't tell him.  He said it tasted slightly different than my usual potato leek soup but that it was delicious and then I told him what it was.  We loved it.  My son is trying to cut down on carbs so this was a good option and a very good use of cauliflower.  I use vegetable broth for all of my soups as I cook vegetarian.  This is a keeper.

This is a great recipe, although I didn't add the Sherry or the nutmeg. It was excellent and is a perfect lunch with a peice of fresh bread!!  I will definitely be making this again.

A couple of minor changes, roasted a head of garlic with the cauliflower. Sauteed the onion in canola oil rather than butter. I didn't have any sherry so I added a bit of white wine (Riesling) instead.  Delicious, the whole family enjoyed it.
***********************************************************************

I made this again last night. This time I roasted half of a large red pepper (cut in strips) with the cauliflower and 3 heads of garlic. I thought adding the red pepper would give a little bit of flavor but more importantly a little more color so the finished soup did not look like oatmeal as other readers complained.  It was also delicious!

This soup is amazing. I pureed the cauliflower that I had roasted with 4 whole loves of garlic. It's rich and creamy, even using skim milk. Simple and lovely.

Delicious!! I substituted the chicken stock, milk and butter for veggie stock, almond milk and olive oil to make vegan. Used white wine instead of sherry simply to avoid a trip to the grocery. Garnished with green onion tops and a little cayenne pepper. Blended about 3/4 as suggested.  Wonderful healthy soup that tastes creamy and indulgent. Thanks Jennie!

I didnt have any milk in the house, but did have a little heavy cream ~1/4 c. So used that and a little extra chicken broth.  Also cut back on the flour...in fact I think that it might not even need any flour if you blend most of the cauliflower in the blender with the broth. Kept a few little pieces whole for texture. Nice first course soup. .UPDATE...I froze some of it and for some reason, it did not freeze well- had funny texture when I reheated nit.

Really good! I had a lot of cauliflower to use up and made 2 different recipes. This one was delicious. The soup is very thick but creamy and has lots of flavor. The roasting helps bring out other flavors other than the cauliflower.

I don't know what went wrong.  I listened to others comments & also added a 1/4 tsp of curry as some recommended.  That small quantity overpowered the cauliflower.  I prefer it it creamy where my husband likes more chunks.  Will try it again as everyone said it so good.  Any suggestions?

This was awesome! I roasted four garlic cloves with the cauliflower florets instead of using the powder, and reduced the salt. So glad I tried this recipe. Trying to get over a virus and I think this'll do it! Served with garlic parmesan pita chips.

This soup is from a taste perspective fantastic.  From an aesthetic perspective, it looks like oatmeal so it might not be so appealing to some people.  Fortunately for me, taste is more important that looks.

I've had cauliflower soup in restaurants and always wanted to make at home.  Watching calories, I was pleased to find this recipe that used milk and not heavy cream or half n half.  I didn't have the garlic infused olive oil, but roasted some garlic cloves with the cauliflower. I did puree the entire soup batch and it was creamy and very flavorful!  Thanks Jennie for sharing!

The flavour of this soup is just fantastic. 

I did find it a little thick so I added a little more water once I finished cooking - however the taste and flavour of this simple soup is a big winner in my books and my 3 year old devours it bowl after bowl. 


I did add some dried thyme to the soup and added 4 cloves of garlic to the cauliflower to roast together as I didn't have garlic flavoured olive oil.

Great recipe.  Cauliflower and nutmeg sure are a perfect marriage.  I pureed some of the cauliflower with milk to make the soup thicker.  My two year old even liked this.  Thanks!

This was really good but I did change it up. I got the idea from another cauliflower soup recipe on this site.  I sauteed the onion in butter, a teaspoon of tarragon, and 3/4 teaspoon of thyme. I then followed the recipe to make the broth.  I tossed the cauliflower with oil, salt, and pepper, and added 4 garlic cloves in their skins.  When the cauliflower was done, I smashed the garlic cloves out of their skins and added them to the soup.  I used some 2% milk instead of cream.  Definitely add the sherry.  A perfect finish.  I topped each bowl with freshly grated parmesan cheese.  Really good!

This is excellent soup.  I picked this one because it's much healthier than most of the others.  This does not make much soup and I had more cauliflower than liquid.  I did have a big head so I ended up adding quite a bit of extra broth and milk. I blended this with the immersion blender. I did use part non-fat half n half just to cut some calories. I hate to see anyone not add the sherry as it really compliments this soup.  I think next time I will use real garlic and saute with the onions. Good job Jennie - Thanks!

This was fantastic and easy! I sauteed some garlic in with the onion since I didn't have garlic salt to use in the roasting of the cauliflower.  Also, I used white wine instead of sherry...a couple of glugs actually.  Finally, I added a squeeze of lemon juice at the end.  Very tasty and perfect for lunch or dinner with a nice baguette on the side!  Thanks for sharing.

this was good! I wound up using 2 heads of cauliflower...I think the amount varies on the size of your cauliflower and how much you like the taste of it :) ..I found that 450 was way too hot in my oven...400 worked better...I roasted several cloves of garlic to add in as well. I  took the garlic and half the cauliflower, pureed them, and added them back into the soup. I wound up adding a little more chicken broth.. worked out very well and was flavorful! I did substitute coconut oil for butter and almond milk due to dietary restrictions. I think this recipe could be varied in a lot of delicious ways!

Delicious!  I substituted the chicken broth with vegetable broth and left out the sherry (didn't have any). I also used real garlic and roasted it with the cauliflower.  I'll be adding this to my favorites

Love it!!!!!! Had my foodie-picky in laws over for lunch and I dread cooking for them. Made this soup exactly as stated and they were raving over it and asking for the recipe. I did serve it with grated cheddar and parsley.  Definitely a keeper.

This was amazing (and healthy)! It tasts like other cauliflower soups made with cream and lots of butter. Roasting the cauliflower makes the difference.

This was VERY easy to make and made the house smell delicious.  As others have suggested I used white wine instead of the Sherry.  I also pureed it completely.  I think if I do it again I will use less flour (I really had to thin it out a lot after).

It's great. I've made it 5 times and we have all enjoyed it every time. I found it while looking for an alternative to the usual cheese covered cauliflower; it exceeded my expectations without changing the recipe. Thank you very much.

Made this soup today with 2 small heads of yellow cauliflower from the local farm stand.  Like other reviewers, I subbed roasted garlic for the garlic infused olive oil.  And I used 2 shallots for the onion.  My husband does not care for nutmeg, so I seasoned the cauliflower the same way I always do when I roast cauliflower as a side dish: salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder & cumin.  Whenever a recipe calls for blending, I use my immersion blender as it provides easier cleanup and more control.  I pureed half the cauliflower at most and left the other half chunky.  These were only minor tweaks to account for personal taste on a terrific recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I can't see where to edit my previous review but I would like to add that I only added a dash of sea salt to the recipe as opposed to the 1.5 teaspoons it called for.

OMG Jennie!  This is fantastic!  I cannot wait to share the recipe with friends!  I did make some substitutions:  instead of 1 c. milk, I added an extra cup of chicken broth (the soup was still deliciously creamy); I also substituted white wine for the sherry just because I didn't have any on hand; and I roasted 6 cloves of garlic with the cauliflower instead of using garlic oil.  The soup is delicious, creamy, and flavorful.  I recommend either using an immersion blender to blend until very smooth, then adding back some of the cauliflower for texture.  Of course you could also you a regular blender too.  Fantastic recipe!

Fantastic (and I hate cauliflower!) My 1 year old gobbled up two babysized bowls. I subbed 4 lg garlic heads for the powdered garlic - will use double that next time. I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk because I needed to use it up. Blended it all with an immersion blender. Will definitely make again

USE LESS SALT!! I should have used only 1/2 t of salt instead of 11/2. Having said that, the soup was still awesome, even though it was a bit too salty for my taste. I didn't use sherry as I don't have any, and used olive oil instead of the garlic oil. This recipe is a definite keeper. I will be making again and again. My husband didn't like it at all, which is just as well, more for me!

This soup is wonderful and full of flavor.  I did add 3 small (extra) cloves of garlic (we're garlic lovers) to the onion and sauteed them both together.  Cold winter night here: this was true comfort food! Served with hot crusty rolls.  YUMMMM!!!

I didn't have garlic olive oil so I just sauteed some fresh minced garlic in olive oil, then drizzled the cauliflower with it before roasting. I only used a pinch or two of sea salt. Because I don't have sherry on hand, I used a tablespoon of a good white wine. I used organic chicken broth and only about a half cup or so of fat free half-n-half to give it a touch of creaminess. This was very good and quite easy for me to make in the morning while I'm doing breakfast for the kids. The flavor of this soup is just wonderful. NOTE: I did only need about a tablespoon or so of flour. Just enough to make a roux with the butter.

I used fancy chicken broth that had wine already in it, reduced fat milk,roasted garlic cloves with the cauliflower and added some ground ginger towards the end of cooking. Otherwise, used recipe as stated.  Surprisingly complex soup, with a smokey flavor due to the roasted garlic. BF thought it was great, even called it gourmet. ;)

This was a great tasting soup. Roasting the cauliflower gives it lots of flavor. It did come out quite thick with the 3T of flour. I ended up adding another 8 oz. chicken broth. I will definitely make again.

This recipe is a keeper!! It is wonderful just as it is. Since I had a few items in the frig that I needed to use (absolutely hate to throw away food), I added shredded carrots, leftover chicken bits and mushrooms. The mushrooms and chicken gave it a bit of texture that we enjoyed. When others compliment the soup - you know it is good.

This soup is definitely a keeper, but I skipped the garlic salt and only used 1 tsp salt. Blend 1/2 cauliflower in blender.

Great simple recipe.  I always review ingredients prior to cooking and it was very clear to me that if you use broth it almost always has plenty of salt and therefore no need to add ANY more!

I used this recipe as the starting place. I added carrots and celery but I think this is a very good basic recipe..actually more than that due to roasting the cauliflower.

Very good recipe.  I made a few adjustments.  I added 2 diced carrots, 2 diced celery stalks and the one small diced onion to the roasting pan with the cauliflower.  I also used about 2 tsp. of minced garlic instead of the powdererd garlic in the roasting pan.  Kept the salt, pepper and nutmeg the same.  For the base, I made a roux with equal parts clarified butter and flour, 3 tbls each.  I added 2 cups low sodium chicken stock and a cup of skim milk to the roux to make a base.  After the veggies were roasted, I whisked them into the base and added the sherry.  Turned out perfectly.  I like the nutmeg enhancement!

Amazing recipe.  I found that BROWNING the cauliflower and onions are super important.  I didn't really brown it the first time and it was really good. I truly browned it the second time and it was beyond great.  What a difference.  I follow the recipe exactly and the whole family loves it.  I have made this about once a week since happening upon it and it is now a winter favorite in my home.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten!!! My #1 suggestion is that you double this recipe because I literally could not stop eating it that it was gone way too soon. 
I do suggest to add more liquid and/or reduce the flour...for some reason it was way too thick with the amounts suggested, especially after being refrigerated, it was more like a delicious cauliflower mash at that point BUT it was nothing a bit more chicken broth couldn't fix. SO amazing though, I suggest everyone go make it NOW.

This would have been so awesome! Except...Don't swap out garlic salt for garlic powder (like me). And don't swap out kosher salt for sea salt (like me) unless you reduce how much you put in. This would have been so great had I just followed the instructions! I am still eating it, but it's so salty. So I give this a 5 star because I know it would have been perfect if not for my own changes.

Oh my gosh, I LOVED this soup!!  The only think I wish I had done differently is cut the cauliflower into smaller pieces.  But it tasted heavenly!  I am definitely making this soup again!

In a word: FABULOUS! Since I had to double the recipe,  I roasted a head of garlic with 2 heads of cauliflower in olive oil. I reserved some of the roasted cauliflower to add back into the soup puree at the end and  I did use 1% milk 1 1/2 C only and found it to be plenty thick enough and rich enough without the added calories of milk or cream. I loved the addition of the sherry. I tend to gravitate toward that flavor so this was definitely what got my attention with this recipe. I can't wait to make it again. Huge hit!

This is a great way to use cauliflower.  I didn't have sherry but had seasoned with other spices.  I will try it with sherry when I have in my pantry.

Very healthy and quite good!  My only small change was to use a potato masher to partially mash up my cauliflower once roasted.  I was in the mood for something a bit chunky, but not quite full bites of cauliflower.  Once I did that, I also ended up pureeing about half of the soup in my blender to get the consistency I wanted.  Perfect for a nice, and warm, lunch!

This got a thumbs up from both my kids, which I wasn't expecting!  I didn't have the flavored oil, but I think that was okay.  Make sure you have enough cauliflower...my head was pretty small and I think it would have been much better with more cauliflower.  We did add a small amount of shredded cheddar on top before serving.

This is a fantastic recipe! I did make some changes to it, including roasting the cauliflower with the oil and minced garlic...smelled great! Instead of milk, I used cream and added more than was required to make a fair bit more to go around! Everyone enjoyed it, including my 8 and 5 year olds.  I will be making this for Thanksgiving dinner appetizer!

I listened to others and cut back on the salt.  I also didn't use garlic oil or garlic powder, but instead roasted a couple of cloves of unpeeled garlic with the cauliflower.  Use 5 or 6 for a more pronounced flavour.

I added peas to the recipe because my 3 year old wanted a green soup, and to make it just more visually appealing.  If I hadn't done that, I would have added some tumeric, just for a boost of colour.  I also added carrots and celery to the onions in the pot.

It's a pretty good soup.  I may sprinkle it with bacon and scallions before serviing it, and maybe a dollop of sour cream.  We're having it in about half an hour with some crusty bread.

This was just ok.  The olive oil and garlic powder completely over-powered any other flavor.  Adding the sherry helped cut that taste just a bit.  Unfortunately not a soup you would want to serve for company as it does not look appetizing at all (like another reviewer mentioned it has the color and texture of oatmeal).  I did appreciate the simplicity of this soup- it can easily be made on a week night.  I might give this another try, but cut back on the garlic powder and olive oil.

I loved this recipe. I didn't have garlic powder so I used a blended garlic spice and omitted the salt. Roasting the cauliflower gave wonderful flavour and including the sherry is a must. Next time I will roast fresh garlic with the cauliflower because I love garlic! I would also double the recipe because I found I only got around 3-4 servings from the recipe.

Absolutely love this recipe, and every time I cook it for guests, they request it as well. The roasted cauliflower on its own is good enough to enjoy as a side, but in the soup, it's truly delicious.

I thought this was a very good soup.  The flavor of the roasted cauliflower really came through.  I kept to the recipe except that I doubled the Sherry. After using the hand mixer the soup was very thick, so I had to add some more broth and milk. Next time I think I will roast some garlic also.  Don't leave out the Sherry, it really is nice.
***I know this might sound weird but the next day when I took it out of the fridge, it had really become thick.  I ate it w/o heating it up or adding liquid and it tasted almost like eating cream of wheat.  I ate it for breakfast.  Sounds weird, but tasted good.

I wish I had discovered this recipe sooner!!  I had lots of cauliflower piling up in the kitchen from our CSA, so I gave this a shot.  Roasting the cauliflower gave this soup delicious flavor and made for pretty golden brown hunks of cauliflower in the finished soup (I only blended about half of the soup).  This was so good I had it five times in six days.  I cut back on the garlic a bit because I was cooking for a group that is garlic-phobic.  

I have another batch in the works to bring to a pot luck this weekend.  Thank you so much for sharing.

Soooooo yummy! I've made this twice and the only thing I changed was I eliminated the salt because the broth I use is quite salty. Thank you for the great recipe! My husband just walked in the house and said "mmmm, that smells good!" ??

this is so delicious!! I've made it several times and it always turns out great. I use vermouth instead of sherry because it's what I have on hand and it still tastes amazing. I keep forgetting to add more liquid though, I find it a bit thick but it could be I'm just not blending it enough.

This is a good recipe.  I agree with others, you can cut down on the salt.  I believe it is better to let the flour cook on the onions for 2 - 3 minutes before adding the liquid.  But, I will make again.  Thanks.

I made it as written. Just a bit less flour and the lesser amount of salt noted. Came out perfectly!  Great way to use cauliflower in a healthy recipe!

I actually made changes to the recipe -- no milk (just more water/broth, added garlic cloves to cauliflower to roast with it, used apple cider vinegar instead of sherry (a lot of it).  For some reason, this soup was more sweet than I like my cauliflower soup to be, so I ended up adding a lot more acid (the apple cider vinegar) to balance out the overwhelming sweetness.

Tasty but next time I will make some more changes. No flour, as I prefer to blend almost all of the cauliflower with my immersion blender to make a thick creamy soup and renders the flour unnecessary.  Blending the soup with the flour results in a very thick soup (had to add extra liquid to thin it out somewhat but there's only so much you can do if you use the flour to thicken the soup!).  Instead of butter, I will try olive oil as I think the soup tends to be oversweet with the nutmeg and cauliflower,  and the butter probably adds even more sweetness.

Fixed as the recipe says, except used only 1 tablespoon of EVOO.  Really good! Served with Heidi rolls, salad, and Shelton Merlot.  Must have a big red wine, which the Shelton is. Double the recipe if you want enough for another meal. 710 calories for the entire pot.

If I could give this recipe 6 stars, I would.  Everyone loved it!  I also had to lower the temp just a little so it didn't burn.  Also, because we don't cook with dairy, I substituted the milk for soy milk and the butter for olive oil.  My kids even loved it.  We decided it is holiday and guest-worthy.  THANK YOU!

I picked up a huge head of cauliflower at a roadside produce stand. I can't stop eating this soup. It is a THICK, rich soup with lots of flavor depth. Changes I made...used real garlic and substituted apple cider vinegar for the sherry. I blended the whole thing in my Ninja to make it creamy. I can't stop eating it. Did I mention that? Thanks Jennie.

excellent as is!  Out of necessity I have made it using creamer instead of milk. I've skipped making the gravy and just blended the vegetables and added broth until the right consistency to lower carb.

I just finished making and eating this soup.  One word - WOW!  I made it per the instructions, except for roasting two large cloves of garlic with the cauliflower since my olive oil was plain.  I liked that the ingredients were very simple and what I'd ordinarily have on hand.  I can't wait to see how leftovers taste!

I love this recipe! Definitely agree with the reviews that it needs more liquids added to it - I added more broth and a little water.  Also added more flour to thicken it up, and I love spicy things do I added some chili powder to give it some kick. i eat mostly vegan, so I used unsweetened almond milk and added Quinoa - which I LOVED!! Quinoa gives it more of a texture, takes on the flavor and is filling.  Great soup!!

This is a great recipe. I did change a few things given that I am on a low carb diet. I roasted the cauliflower and onions together with the butter and spices. I also did not make a rue out of flour but used cream instead of milk. It is very tasty and I will definitely make again...the roasting process adds a really different flavor than your typical cauliflower soup and its a nice change.

Very tasty!  I used 3 cans of chicken broth because I was trying to stretch the soup farther as I was feeding several people.  I roasted some carrots with the cauliflower and cut them up, then added them right before the soup was ready to be served.  I also sauteed some celery along with the onions.  This was a yummy soup.  I served it with broccoli cheese cornbread from this site.  It was a very satisfying dinner!

Pretty solid soup.  I like my soups a bit stronger in flavor, so I added in some cumin and used coconut milk to "pump up" the flavor a bit.  Also, it could just be my oven, but the cauliflower only needed about 20 minutes in the oven.

Following the recipe almost to the letter (which is rare for me), this turned out well, however, I will definitely make changes for next time. In the future, I'll double the recipe, using 2 roasted heads of cauliflower and double the liquids for sure! I used all the seasonings in the recipe, but seasoned to taste rather than using the suggested measurements. The finished texture was reminiscient of cream of wheat, which I like, but I simply would've preferred more liquid to begin with so when I used my immersion blender, it would've been a smoother consistency. Easy adjustments for next time though, because this is strictly a personal preference. DH and DD weren't too impressed, but I was, simply because I've never been a big fan of cauliflower, and this recipe changed my mind. I absolutely LOVED the roasting part....will DEFINITELY roast my cauliflower anytime I need a tasty side dish (couldn't stop nibbling on it off the roasting pan, which I lined with parchment paper for easy cleanup). I'll tweak the recipe next time and see if I can't get it more to my liking, otherwise, it was a good stepping stone for me. Served with the Parmesan Knots from this site, it was a very filling dinner this evening.

Delicious, hearty soup with a nice garlic flavor. I found that 30 min. was plenty of time for roasting the cauliflower. I used skim milk, and I like that this recipe is low-fat. I've been eating for lunch this week and it is very filling!

This is a delicious recipe!!  10 stars!!  I had never had cauliflower soup until I made this and now I am hooked! I've made it 4 times in the past couple months!
 I do omit the nutmeg because I don't like the flavor.  I toss the cauliflower with whatever seasoning I am in the mood for and also add fresh garlic.
I also omitted the sherry just because I didn't have it.  
I like to mash my cauliflower before adding it to the liquid part and then use my submersion blender to further puree.  Perhaps I chose an extra large head of cauliflower this time because I ended up doubling the chicken stock.
I just LOVE this soup!  I serve mine with a little shredded cheese and a dollop of Greek Yogurt (if I'm really cutting loose I put in some bacon pieces!).  
The only cauliflower soup recipe I will ever look for!!!!

This was a fantastic recipe!  I didn't have 'roasted garlic-flavor' olive oil, but I did have some truffle olive oil and it was wonderful.  I used a half cup of milk and added a half cup of cream (because I like the cream based soups), and I just  stuck the immersion blender in the whole pot to blend some of the largest cauliflower pieces.  The result was more of a 'chunky' soup, but we loved it.  I'll definitely keep this recipe around for times in the future when I have leftover cauliflower!

Very yummy!  I wish I hadn't pureed a portion of the soup because it was better chunky. It was very difficult not to gobble up the freshly roasted and somewhat caramelized cauliflower. So good! I'll definitely be making that part again and again as a side dish.

This was really easy and tasty! I garnished it with some shredded cheddar cheese and ate it with toast - a perfect lunch on a windy winter day :)

Very tasty!  The only change i made was to roast four cloves of garlic alongside the cauliflower.  I thought the nutmeg and dry sherry added wonderful yet subtle complexity.  I ended up pureeing the cauliflower, but it might have been nice with bobbing florets too.

I roasted some garlic cloves in with the cauliflower. When the cauliflower and garlic were done roasting I blended half the cauliflower and all of the garlic in a food processor with some broth. I then poured the mixture back into the soup. This recipe was outta control delicious.

I am eating a bowl of this as I type.  It's quite enjoyable.  I made a few changes, some based on necessity and some on preference.  I added a chopped carrot to the pan for roasting with the carrot, and I used regular olive (no garlic olive oil).  We have just a bit of milk left, and my husband will not be happy if I use it and he has none to drink with dinner (no time to go to store today), so I used 2 cups chicken broth and half cup of heavy cream.  I added garlic powder to onions (just ran out of fresh garlic!) and a little smoked paprika.  I dont' care of nutmeg in savory dishes (love it but only in sweet applications) so I omitted that.  And I used a dry vermouth, because my sherry is a medium, and I didn't want to add sweetness.  I also added a bit of fresly grated parmesan.  I used an immersion blender and partially blended the mixture (left some chunks for texture).  I will definitely make again, but next time I'll add a bit of fresh herb (thyme would probably be really good with it).  It's very easy to put together, and it's good...that's a nice combination to make it a keeper for me!

Very good and flavorful. I substituted leeks for the onion (it is the season here) and added one carrot to the cauliflowers. It ended up a bit thick for my taste even if I used only 1 1/2 tablespoon of flour, so I would suggest to have at hand some extra chicken broth and milk to adjust the consistency if needed.

Great Soup!  I went by this recipe to the letter except I substituted white wine for the sherry. I lightened it up a little by using skim milk. Definitely worth more than 5 stars!!

This recipe tasts decadent. You cannot believe that you are only eating 135 calories. I could eat this every day and never grow tired of it. I used white wine instead of sherry (last minute outage discovery) and blended in it's entirety. For my husband (the meat eater) I threw some of the left over flank steak from the night before and he LOVED IT!!

The nutty taste of this hearty soup from the roasting and the touch of nutmeg takes this over the top...well-worth five stars; and it is so simple to make! One of the few times I followed a recipe directions exactly and this recipe did not disappoint! This ones a keeper.

Wow, I never knew cauliflower could taste so good!  I made it as written, only mashing the cauliflower after cooking and adding some parmesan when serving as some suggested.  I love this soup!

Very good. I used a whole head of cauliflower but tripled the soup itself. I added a bit of cheese. when I served this, I topped it off with parmesan. My husband announced this as his new favorite soup.

awesome.  Turned it into a vegan special, so stock instead of soup and milk.  Used more nutmeg, a whole bulb of roasted garlic instead of garlic powder with the cauliflower and no sherry/alcohol.  Also blended the whole pot load.  Served with garlic bread.  Thanks.

Delicious! Mine came out super thick, but that may have been due to the tweaks I did. I used regular extra-virgin olive oil, but roasted several garlic cloves with the cauliflower. I also used shallots rather than onion because I like their flavor better. Lastly, I used some Salvadoran cream and evaporated milk to make up the 1 cup milk (so many recipes are improved by using Salvadoran cream!). I'll definitely make it again.

I ended up making this with romanesco, just because that's what I had on hand.  So delicious!  Even our friend who "doesn't like vegetables" went back for seconds.  The only other thing I added was 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper for a little kick.  Will definitely be making this one again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

this soup is so yummy. I made a few changes to preparation but I don't think it affected the recipe. First I placed cauliflower, chopped carrots and chopped celery and chopped onion on a cookie sheet, added fresh garlic cloves drizzled with olive oil salt and pepper. cooked in oven for 30 min. then I pureed the veggies and followed the rest of the recipe but omitting the onion with the butter. also used skim milk. Love Love love this soup!

I thought this was pretty good. A little salty I suggest not adding the salt, or using low sodium broth and then adding salt to taste. I blended half the soup in the blender and added a little extra broth and it still looked like oatmeal.

Loved this soup - I preferred it blended some, but my hubby likes it chunky - absolutely perfect for using all the excess cauliflower out of the vege garden this summer & have frozen it for the winter.

I followed recipe only used fresh garlic mixed with olive oil.  It didn't have enough flavor for me until I added 2 T freshly grated parmesan and 1 c + freshly shredded extra sharp cheddar.  Excellent!

i thought this recipe was delicious. I used a little garlic and red pepper flakes with it when cooking the onions. Other than that did it just like the recipe and loved it! Especially the next day or two when all the flavors really blended.

Must be great.  It is the first time my 46 year old son has asked for a recipe!  I substituted garlic cloves for the garlic powder and vegetable broth for the chicken.  I let the seasoned, raw cauliflower marinate overnight in the refrigerator.

[Update] I froze half of it and I actually liked it better after thawing and reheating.  [Original] This is just okay.  It just tastes like mashed up cauliflower to me.  I added some hot sauce and that helped.  To me it needs something else to distract from the 'mashed up cauliflower' taste.  Some ham or sausage would be good.  Maybe some kale or other greens?

This is delicious!  I made the following changes (mostly cause I didn't have a few of the ingredients) used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and two cans soy milk instead of reg. milk and chkn broth.  Added fresh mushrooms and browned them with the onions.  Added a few garlic cloves to the cauliflower in the oven.  Used white wine instead of sherry.  Mixed it all together and let it simmer for about 30 mins to soften a bit more, then blended it to make a smooth soup.  Then I seasoned with salt, pepper, basil, garlic powder, thyme, and italian seasoning to taste.  So good!  Never thought nutmeg and cauliflower would go together so well.  The white wine makes ALL the difference.

Tasted great as a vegan and gluten-free meal! Due to dietary restrictions we used olive oil in place of butter, rice milk, vegetable stock and Bob's Red Mill gluten-free flour. The soup turned out utterly delicious despite the changes!

This was so good!  I have to admit that I modified the recipe because I wanted to clean out the fridge.  I added half a can of pureed pumpkin, along with some frozen corn.  I think the pumpkin added a lot due to sweetness of it, which went along with the nutmeg.

I pretty much followed the directions as is however, I added a TBSP of port instead of sherry, added garlic to the onion and I also used an immersion blender at the end so the soup was nice and smooth.  Very delicious!

I saw this recipe yesterday and went home and made it last night. A-FREAKIN-MAZING!!!!! The only thing I didn't add was sherry (didn't have any) but tossed in a handful of frozen shrimp before finishing. The cauliflower would be great on its own as a side dish as well. It doesn't make an enormous pot of soup (as I'm used to making) but that's OK. DELICIOUS,  DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS!!!!! :-D

This recipe was YUM. My husband is allergic to onions so I substituted celery. Also substituted a little less port wine instead of sherry. Even so, it was still very delicious and I enjoyed it. If I made the recipe verbatim, it might get the 5 stars as I really love onion. I used lowfat milk but it still thickened up just fine.

Excellent. Superb. It even won over my husband, whom I like to call the "soup skeptic." It's a wonderful way to eat one of my favorite veggies, but I think even non-cauliflower enthusiasts would like it.

Excellent!  The only difference I made was putting 4 cloves of garlic with the cauliflower in the roasting pan.  Once all roasted, I mashed them all together before putting it in the soup.  It was wonderful!

You have to try this soup! It seems like a lot of steps, but it's very simple. I didn't have any sherry, but it still turned out wonderful! I added cheese, and my husband said this was his new favorite soup! It's creamy enough that it doesn't need to be blended, and I didn't feel like there was too much garlic at all. However, the amount of onion seemed to equal the cauliflower, so if you love onions then it's great, but if you have kids, you might want to put it in a food processor or use a smaller onion. This soup is very filling, but you may want to double this recipe if you're feeding more than two hungry people...it's that good!

Really tasty, my husband loved it & he has never really enjoyed cauliflower!  He did add a "secret ingredient" which he declared to make this soup "the best!"  (The secret ingredient was fresh ground black pepper)

Not sure what to give this recipe...half of the people I served it to loved it and half didn't like it at all. Those that liked it really loved the spices... Mine turned out a bit thick, so I had to add extra milk.

A really delicious way to use cauliflower.  Nice and hot and filling on a winter's evening.  I agree with the contributor, though - lighten up on the salt.  I halved it, and I still find it salty.

Very tasty and filling. It is hard for me to get my husband to eat vegetables, but he ate two helpings and even licked the spoons. The caramelized onions and sherry are the magic ingredients.

I used florets and roasted them on cookie sheet for 30 minutes spiced as per the recipe.. I also roasted about 10 garlic cloves with the cauliflower. I used an immersion blender on half of the cauliflower and then threw in the rest of the cauliflower.  Other than those minor changes I followed the recipe and this soup is absolutely delicious. It tastes like a rich creamy soup yet It is healthy and basically  low calorie.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

Loved this soup. I love garlic, so added the powder and roasted some whole cloves along with the cauliflower. I didn't have any sherry, so I used a bit of beer instead. I also needed to add more broth to thin it out a bit. Added a few drops of truffle oil just be serving. So delicious.

I always follow the recipe the first time I make it. This was good but next time would definitely make some changes. I would cut down on the thyme, it seemed like that’s all I tasted. My family did like though and it was pretty easy to make.

Excellent flavor!  I used regular olive oil,  and 5 medium cloves of garlic that I microplaned. otherwise,  I made it exactly as written.   Mine turned out very thick and made only about 2.5 servings.

I loved this soup. Very flavorful and not high in calories. I tried a modified version with less flower so that it was not so thick. I like both versions, thick and thin!

flavors are good, mild, but tasty.  1 head of cauliflower is just not enough for six meal sized servings.  I did roast 2 carrots sliced about 1/3inch with the cauliflower.   reserved about a 1/4 of the roasted vegetables to add back after puree with stick blender.  cut flour to 1 Tb...a roux is generally equal parts flour to fat.  I like this recipe and will make it again, but will make it my own next go round.  thank you for sharing this recipe with us!

We love this soup! I use whatever broth I have on hand (chicken or vegetable) and regular olive oil with minced garlic, since I don’t typically have garlic oil on hand. We make this a couple times a month. Wish I could rate it more than 5 stars

I made this almost as written - I used homemade low-sodium vegetable broth, almond milk, unsalted butter, and only 1 Tbsp flour. I did blend half at the end. Very tasty and unique and healthy. I need low sodium options for members of my family and this ended up being only about 500 mg per serving.

Not only does this make exceptionally delicious soup-- I mean, really, really, really good soup--, but the roasted cauliflower part of the recipe is the best recipe for roasted cauliflower in the world!  We use it every time we want an incredible veggie side dish. Try it!

Love this recipe as a base. I enjoy roasting the cauliflower with course ground cumin, coriander, and fennel seeds. 
I enjoy a course chop of the vegetables and blending everything after a 10 minute boil to simmer to let all the flavors meld. Easy to prep and delicious to eat!

Love this soup..  I had added diced white mushrooms to the onions and took another reviewer advice and mashed the cauliflower before adding to the soup.  I also added a bit of smoked paprika.  Wonderful comfort soup.  I will make again.

I’ve made this multiple times now and LOVE it! I usually use two heads of cauliflower but keep the rest of the recipe the same. I do purée it at the end for a smoother consistency. Sooooooo tasty! The roasting really makes the difference.

I used this recipe as a starting point.  I wanted to up the veggie power.  Here is what I added.......roasted 4 garlic cloves and a yellow pepper along with the cauliflower, added a jar of white beans that I had on hand, used homemade pork broth that I had in the freezer, added some celery leaves just because I was making a salad at the same time and just added them to the pot.  Will omit the milk and blend everything to make it nice and smooth.

Excellent recipe, and was thoroughly enjoyed by me, my son, and wife..  I added some fresh dill as I was letting it simmer.  This adds a nice taste. Go easy on the salt.

I didnt make any changes but I didn't like this soup at all. It sounded amazing and I love roasting my vegies before I put them in a soup, I love garlic, i used a large head of cauliflour. I'm not sure why it didn't taste nice but unfort I won't be making this again.

had to adjust the amounts of some of the ingredients. I used roast garlic, forgot the pepper and dry sherry and only used a quarter of the salt. add 2 tablespoons of heavy cream at the end. and used oil instead of butter to saute onions.  it turned out delicious.

My whole family loved this soup. I followed the recipe exactly. We preferred the soup not be pureed at all but that the cauliflower be kept in the larger pieces.

Excellent recipe! For the liquids, I substituted 1cup of broth and 1 can of coconut milk. But I should have made a double batch to leave enough for “tasting.”

This was company level soup. I like garlic so I doubled it. Added 2 carrots and 2 potatoes.  When it was finished I pureed half of the soup so it was creamy, but still chunky.

Can't comment on this soup because my kids devoured the roasted cauliflower right out of the oven as an after school snack.  It was out of this world delicious.  A little too salty, but I think if it had eventually made its'way into a soup, it would have been perfect.  Will attempt again soon.

followed the recipe but used half white wine and half sherry, pureed the cauliflower, and added some butter at the end to give it some sheen. Hubby loved it!

Siguiendo la receta al pie de la letra logras un potaje , por eso agregue otra taza de leche  para lograr una consistencia menos espesa. Es una receta sencilla que arroja un maravilloso resultado. Es lo que conocemos como comfort food

I would have rated 3.5 stars if I could. My major issue was that my garlic powder burned in the oven, making it look like burnt toast soup. Next time I will cut the temp to 425 as at least one person suggested. Not as creamy as I prefer--next time i'll add a little "reduced fat" half and half. Makes lots of dirty dishes...

This is a great base recipe. I tweaked for my own taste (reduced the salt and garlic) and to use up some other veggies (added carrots and sweet potato). Also I didn't have sherry or white wine, so used whiskey! It made a nice creamy soup with a nutty flavor and color, roasting the cauliflower is worth the time!

Very bland...but didn't have sherry so that may have helped.  I made it as shown and DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL.  I flavored the cauliflower with olive oil, kosher salt & ground Chipotle Chili seasoning.  I did put about 1/2 of the roasted cauliflower in the food processor and about 1/2 with the chicken stock (I make my own) in the blender.    I  cooked a couple of slices of bacon and broke those in to help it along with the little bacon grease the 2 bacon strips made. I didn't add any milk.  I also added shredded cheese in the bowl as I served it along with a few fresh little pieces of cauliflower.  Not a keeper even with all that help!

Quite good. The nutmeg and roasting of the cauliflower was a nice change from other cauliflower soups.  Yes this was thick but easily remedied with more stock. I pureed the soup entirely and tossed in some fresh parsley for  bit of freshness.

I made this with modifications according to what I had on hand, but also what we like. I roasted the cauliflower with regular olive oil and 3 cloves garlic (kept in casing, drizzled with oil and wrapped in foil). Did not use garlic powder. I chopped up 1 leek in addition to ½ sweet onion. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and half and half in place of milk. My husband likes Indian food, so for spices, I added 1 tsp. turmeric, 1½ tsp. garam masala, ½ tsp. cumin, and ½ tsp. cayenne pepper. Very good and looking forward to leftovers!

My husband and I loved this soup! I left out the sherry and the nutmeg. We are real garlic lovers so I added garlic flavoured hot sauce to each individual serving. Can't wait to make it again. Will double the recipe next time.

Superb. I roasted about 8 cloves of garlic along with the cauliflower florets, then pureed all the cauliflower, reserving a few tiny florets for a garnish. I made mini meatballs with 1 pound of ground pork, minced onion, garlic, sage, 1 egg, and oatmeal and baked them for about 15 minutes at 400 degrees, then added them to the soup, which is simmering on low now. The flavor is earthy and satisfying. I might chop some green onion as another garnish.  Some fried and chopped bacon instead of meatballs would also be yummy. Thank you for a great recipe!

This soup was "ok". I made it exactly as written.  I felt before I made it that it would be better without flour and I think that would have improved it a lot. I wasn't crazy about the consistency and felt like it would be better without flour.  Everyone liked it no one was crazy about it.  I guess my quest for perfect cauliflower soup continues

Loved the recipe, I did as one suggested and used plain unsweetened almond milk and omitted Sherry and nutmeg(not a fan of nutmeg). I also just used regular olive oil. It is a wonderful recipe. My picky child loved it as well. Well done.

Very unique flavor. I liked the sherry, and I grated fresh nutmeg today......so I used that. I riced the roasted cauliflower in the food processor before the liquid was added. Next time I will do it like the recipe says and blend after the broth and milk are in it. My soup was darker in color than the picture above, possibly because the browned and sautéed  onions. This recipe is a keeper.

This soup has so much going for it, made as written delicious, made with a change here and there still delicious. I pureed the soup and will leave it chunky the next time I make it, I tasted it that way before pureeing and I like it better with the thinner ( not to thin ) broth and chunks of cauliflower. we are not nutmeg fans so I used curry, a perfect match. I had Coconut milk on hand so I used that; again a perfect fit. This went right in my soups for winter file.

This was so very easy to make. I DID use vegetable stock(low sodium) I also pureed it to make a "creamy" soup.
I would use white pepper next time.

Great way to get veggies! I used white wine instead of sherry and it was wonderful.

This was really good and easy. I made it nearly according to directions, just used olive oil because I had no garlic oil and roasted 4 cloves of minced garlic along with the cauliflower in the oven. Wonderful flavor. Will make again! Thanks for sharing.

This is good, but I would not call it a soup, rather a chowder. My husband loves thick chunky soup, so he loved it, but said we should save it for cold weather. I think it was good, but recipe will definitely be used as a base in the future, with changes to accommodate a different texture and appearance.

A friend was headed out of town for a couple weeks and had gifted me her cauliflower and milk, so I found this recipe on this drizzly, spring day. 

 I tweaked the recipe just a tad, as I didn't have any onion on hand and had a celery stick and a little zucchini begging to be included (so I shredded the zucchini and diced the celery and used them in the step that would have been the onion). 

I used 3 cloves fresh garlic, turmeric and black pepper with avocado oil (items I had on hand) to coat the cauliflower in for roasting. Didn't have any nutmeg, onions or sherry on hand, and was too lazy to go out in the rain to get them...

All I can say about this is wow! Delicious!!!  Will definitely make it again!

Wow !  I LOVE this recipe.  It has so much flavor.  I did take the additional advice and doubled the chicken broth & milk. I also added 2 extra Tbl of butter to the roux. And added chunky carrots to the roasted cauliflower mix.  Also slightly mashed the cooked veggies with a potato masher.  Oh, I also tossed in about a cup of shredded cheddar.  This is definitely my new comfort soup.  Emailed it to my vegetarian granddaughter.

My husband and I LOVE this soup. I love that it is easy, healthy, and tastes awesome. I follow the recipe almost exactly, except that I don't measure the spices anymore- I liberally season the cauliflower before roasting.  Also, I like to puree the whole pot with my immersion blender so it's the consistency of loose (but not runny) grits.  I always make a double batch so we have leftovers for the week, and I have made this for friends, and they all love it!  Thanks Jennie!

Not my favorite cauliflower soup recipe, but not bad. Flavor is good, I just prefer a more silken texture, and a pristine white.

We love roasted cauliflower but I was looking for a different way to serve it.  This was just right!  I used my immersion blender at the end and pureed all of it.  GREAT texture!  Add a little cayenne for a little kick!

Not a cauliflower fan but trying hard to be because it is so packed with vegetarian protein!  And I am pretty seriously a garlic fan, so all together this worked as a suitable use of cauliflower.  We didn't have infused oil so I roasted a few garlic cloves with the cauliflower, worked well.  Also my vegetarian chicken-style stock made it too salty, but that was my fault.  Next time I might add a few red pepper flakes. Would be easily adjusted for a keto diet recipe (omit milk, sub cream).

This was a lovely soup to make during our February blizzard. It was surprisingly filling, and even my husband (who hates cauliflower) was able to tolerate it. The roasting really brings out the nuttiness in the cauliflower. It was delightful.

This is a delicious and forgiving recipe -- any number of substitutions will do with the end result being the same creamy and cozy soup.  I would say what makes it extra special is to roast the garlic with the cauliflower.

No changes & I thought it was delicious!  I'll definitely make it again.  I made cauliflower into "rice" like texture with processor before roasting and that was the perfect texture for inserting into soup.

This is a very good soup, and will be going in my cookbook. I didn't have roasted garlic olive oil or cream. Instead I tossed 4 thinly sliced garlic cloves with the cauliflower and regular EVOO oil, and used half-and-half in place of the cream. I did add an extra cup of chicken broth to thin it out a bit. I think in the future, I'll modify the recipe to use more chicken broth or cut back on the flour. Thanks for sharing, Jennie!

Good soup, but too salty and garlicky for my tastes. I did cut back on both as suggested, and kept adding more milk and water. My likely problem was I added garlic cloves in roasting the cauliflower, and my chicken broth was salted, not unsalted.  Next time will pay more attention to this. Still really liked it though....

Great recipe. Only changes  I made were I  used dry onion  flakes instead of an onion  and added Swiss cheese.  My son-in-law wanted to know how much cream does it take to make cauliflower taste like food from the Gods.

I always roast my vegs in olive oil and minced or crushed fresh garlic.  So I took my leftover roasted cauliflower and broccoli, chopped them fine in the ninja and added them to the recipe.  I also added mushrooms because I needed to cook them along with the onion.  All finely chopped.  Delish!  Will make again.  Didn't use the spices since I spiced in the initial roast or sherry.  Didn't need to.  A great second meal when you have leftover roasted vegs.

Loved it. I doubled the recipe. Added whipped cream along with the milk. It was a bit oniony, so that definitely helped wash out the onion flavor a bit. I added cilantro, great scent. Will make it again for sure!

Really good.  I roasted 5 cloves of garlic with the cauliflower instead of using garlic powder and I don't add milk ... I find if you use an emersion blender the soup is thick and creamy without the milk ... I seem to make this every time cauliflower goes on sale a good soup for all of us ... yummmm

Used skim milk and just 1 tablespoon each of olive oil (not garlic infused) and flour and it turned out great! Definitely cut the salt in half though. Was finally able to convert my cauliflower-hating boyfriend into a cauliflower fan :)

My soup was brown, maybe overcooked onions.  Roasted carrots with cauliflower.  Good tasting though.  Would use half and half maybe creamier.  More butter.

After reading input from other reviews, I decided to take their advice, and with some of my own changes it's a 5*.  I followed roasting instructions, but roasted 1/2 the onions with the cauliflower (but I reduced the nutmeg to 1/8t) and sautéed the remaining 1/2 onion in 2T (not 1T), stirred in the flour, cooked 5 minutes before adding 3C Fat Free milk, and 3C water.  After I added the cauliflower, I creamed 2 C Cottage Cheese in a food processor (sorry! I needed the extra protein), and stirred in 1 C shredded sharp cheese...  I know, I know, I too wonder why people don't just follow the recipe, and I did change this quite a bit, but I don't use chicken broth or Sherry, so please forgive me.  I'm thrilled with a new way to add cauliflower to my diet.  Thank you for the recipe and all the tips.

This is quite good.  I read the reviews before making this and made a couple of adjustments that I knew would be good choices for us.  I used cloves of minced garlic instead of the garlic powder.  I also reduced the flour to only a scant Tablespoon.  I do like a soupier soup and since I knew I was going to blend it I added more liquid.  I used about 3/4 cup of dry white wine (no sherry in the house)and 2 full cups of the chicken stock.  Even so, it still sets up to be very thick - too thick for us - once you have blended it.  For the leftovers, I added stock until I got the consistency I wanted.  I also added some carmelized onion that I had in the fridge and served it with crumbled bacon on top.  Those changes made this recipe a repeat for us.

WAY too much salt. I think if only I had listened to the other commenters, it would have been delicious.  Next time I'll add whatever other veggies I have lying around in the fridge and leave out most of the salt.  I think the underlying taste is good, and I'll try this recipe again.

I found the soup a little blah, but the cauliflower seasoned and roasted that way had everyone eating it like candy

This was a great starting point & I have to admit I hate it when people do this to recipes. I used curry powder and cayenne pepper instead of ginger and garlic. I roasted an onion cut in wedges and a couple of stalks of celery with the cauli. And happily, everything else was the same. So I had a curried cauli soup with some zip to it to please my "older" kid (i.e. 23 years old!)

Omitted the flour, used leeks instead of onions and white wine in place of sherry (wbout 1/2 cup).  Very good.

This soup was too thick for my liking, I thinned it out but still would not make this again. Next time I'll just prepare and eat the roasted califlower and won't bother making soup.

I added 1 cup thinly sliced carrots and 1 diced potato to onion sautee.  I deleted all salt and sherry but added 1 cup leftover baked ham chunks. Then topped off with a shaving of asiago. Left chunky it made a great casserole.  If I remember, it's going to my next potluck!

delicious. I roasted a whole head of garlic while I roasted the cauliflower and then added that to the soup instead of the garlic powder. I also added more stock since the soup came out quite thick.

Had to seriously revise because of lack of ingredients! You'll laugh when you read this I'm sure...  substitute nutmeg for cinnamon, garlic powder for onion salt, add a little ground ginger, substitute milk for plain yogurt mixed with water until just a little runny.  It was AWESOME!

LOVE the roasted flavor!  I did add some carrots, and brocciflower, tripled the milk with a little cornstarch and used white wine instead of dry sherry.  So good!  I added extra garlic salt, but I wouldn't suggest that!  Made it a little too salty!  Next time I will roast garlic with the cauliflower and other veggies!

Excellent soup! Even my picky girl like it....trust me no easy feat. Next time I will double recipe. Made enough for 5 of us for lunch, 1 bowl each. I used whole head of cauliflower, minus the core, my labs get that:)  Used 1 whole carton of fat free chicken broth, 1 1/2 cups of milk. I added 4 chopped garlic cloves to cauliflower. Roasted in 9 x 13 glass bake dish, sprayed no stick spray Tossed cauliflower with spices and oili ncluding 1/4 tea cayenne pepper. Need to stir every 10 min. as veggies bake in cover. Sauted onion in olive oil till golden brown in my soup pot. Added butter at end. Then continued with rest of recipe. The only complaint was there wasen't enough. Served with grated 4 year old cheddar on top. I would like to try this recipe by adding chopped red, yellow or orange pepper to the cauliflower. The roasted flavour would be yummy.

Amazing and surprisingly very easy to make.  Yes there are a few extra steps but once you take the cauliflower out of the oven the soup is complete in minutes.

This was better than I expected and I found myself liking it more the more I ate it.  It has a comfort food quality to it, which healthy dishes rarely have.  We topped ours with feta cheese and that really made it wonderful.  Without the feta it was just okay.  I think next time I will add more garlic, definitely not skimp on the feta and I also think toasted pine nuts would be an excellent topping for this soup.

Excellent and so healthy too! I added 4-5 cloves of garlic to the roasting pan instead of garlic powder.  Also added about a cup of grated sharp cheddar fo a cheesey soup.  We really enjoyed this!

This was alright.  It didn't have much broth, so I had to keep adding extra water and milk.  It was missing something for me, but wasn't horrible.

Although this soup tasted okay, nobody was thrilled to eat it due to its oatmeal like appearance.  Hubby said he'd prefer next time to just eat the roasted cauliflower. Personally, I found the recipe to be a bit time-consuming to make after a long work day.

My husband and daughter both liked this soup, but I didn't care for it too much. Part of it was probably because of its appearance. It really isn't very attractive, particularly if you roast the cauliflower until it starts to brown and brown the onions. The other part was the taste, though. It seemed too sweet, even though I didn't add any sugar to it. It was better when I sprinkled some shredded cheddar and lots of salt on top, but that kind of defeats the purpose of a healthy soup.

This is absolutely the best cauliflower soup I have ever tasted!  I used chicken soup base as I had no chicken broth and also used one large head and one small head of cauliflower.  Wonderful taste!

Really Yummy! I had to add a little more water (how much is a can anyway? I use bouillons!) and didn't have Sherry. I also tried to lighten it up a bit - cut down on the flour like others and substituted half the butter for half light "i cant believe it's not butter" type stuff and it worked fine. delicious and healthy

Very good flavor - what I liked most about this recipe is that it is healthy and low fat; just goes to show you don't need the heavy cream, etc.  I only used 1 1/2 T of flour and next time, I will omit it altogether as it's not needed.  I used a basting/roasting oil that was infused with garlic and herbs - that really enhanced the roasted cauliflower.  I also used vegetarian chicken broth and wound up adding more to thin it out a bit.  Thank you for posting this recipe, it's great!

this soup is excellent. it took me longer than anticipated to prepare, but that is usually the case for me. the end result was excellent...I added a couple carrots and then a bit more pepper at the last minute, the result was great but next time I think I'll leave the pepper as is. the soup got rave reviews and was great as a leftover.

Great recipe - will make again. I did not use the sherry as I did not have any. I must have used too much flour because it was too thick at first. I ended up adding another 2 cups of milk and 1 cup of water just to make it the right consistancy.

My husband made this soup and it tasted great. He combined another cauliflower soup recipe so I'm not sure what all he modified.

Delicious!!!  The nutmeg really adds a nice touch to it.  I blended mine and if you don't add enough broth, it can even turn into a substitute "mashed potatoes".  Yummy.

Love, love, love this soup!  It's easy to make, but it can be a bit of a hassle to roast the cauliflower first.  The first time, my husband and I ate the roasted cauliflower beforeI could make the soup.  The second time, I actually made the soup and it was delicious!  I might cut back a little on the salt next time.  Even my cauliflower-hating kids ate this soup, and that's a big deal at my house!

good...we liked the flavor of the roasted cauliflower.  However, it was WWAAYYYY too salty, so be careful!
