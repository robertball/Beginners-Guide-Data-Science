the cookies turned out, except the recipe does not give any info for the glaze.  They are like the chinese almond cakes in that they are cake like in texture (puffy, not flat like the photo) - I guess because of the cake flour.  I would recommend roasting the whole almonds to make them crunchy on the cookies...they are kind of soft otherwise.

My mother made these cookies at Christmas time when I was growing up.  YUM!
May want to use unsalted butter and/or reduce the amount of salt in recipe, depending on taste preferences.

The recipe was simple, easy and turned out really awesome. Again like the previous person has stated there is no recipe for the glaze, but they still turned out great, will definitely choose this recipe to make again!

If you need a good glaze recipe to go along with this cookie this website is good! I made this cookie and used the glaze from this website and they turned out well!
