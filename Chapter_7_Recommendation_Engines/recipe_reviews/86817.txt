In my family we call this "Texas Hominy" and use one can rol-tel tomatoes (mild) and one can of drained hominy, add a little cheddar cheese, and bake at 350 for 15 mins.  You can also add various cooked meats to the mixture to make a main dish - I have added left-over pork, cheicken, steak or roast beef.

I wanted to try this recipe because I'd never had hominy before, and it was an "ok" food on the Weight Watchers Core plan.  I made it for lunch since it looked so simple.  It was fantastic.  Just enough spice, very flavorful, and filling.  My husband loved it,and I will definitely make it again.  I used 1/4 tsp. of both salt and pepper and about a teaspoon or so of chopped cilantro. We did add cheese, but agreed (as we ate our cheeseless second helping) that it wasn't required.  Next time I might try adding sour cream too, just for fun.  Great recipe, thanks so much!

For my first taste of hominy, I was very pleased. This dish smells so good while it's cooking, and the taste is unique but flavorful. I topped mine with Sargento brand shredded Chipotle Cheddar cheese. Can you say yum? I'll definately make this again, thank you!

Good recipe.  I only had one can of hominy, so I used that and a can of corn.  I used about half a can of green chiles since we don't like super spicy food.  Added a little extra garlic, and omitted the cilantro since I didn't have any.  A nice change from our usual sides.

We rolled up this dish in a tortilla with lots of cheese and a little refried beans.  It was topped with a green chili sauce....quite good!

Really tasty. I used a can of Rotel instead of the separate cans of tomatoes and chilis. I added a squeeze of fresh lime just before serving, which added a nice flavor. Thanks :)

So delicious! I served this with black beans and corn tortillas, and it was marvelous. The cilantro and cumin were lovely together.

Great dish!  I made this for a side dish last night.  I skipped the cilantro (hubby doesn't like) and the cheese.  I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.  Easy and delicious!  I'll be making it again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Since I was only cooking for two, I adjusted the recipe and used a can of Mild Rotel. This is pretty spicy with the Rotel, I'd imagine the heat isn't as bad if you do the recipe as written. The serving sizes on this recipe are pretty generous.

I had no tomatoes and so used basil spaghetti sauce, and melted the cheese into it.  VERY good.

Not bad, but I doctored it a bit.  Used a can of seasoned tomatoes.  Added shallots, diced ham, celery, can of mushrooms, some diced black olives, parsley, diced onion, some frozen peas.  Definitely a poor man's or woman's meal.  Very quick too.

I'm a shortcut cook, so I added a large can rotel tomatoes and browned brats to the hominy and cheese and it was awesome!  I would never have thought to put these ingredients together had I not seen this recipe.  Thanks!

The flavor in this was great! This was my first experience with hominy, and the texture of it kinda threw me off, but that's a personal taster thing, and this recipe motivates me to give hominy a few more tries to see if it grows on me!

This is very good.  I grew up eating hominy plain from the can and I am really enjoying discovering new ways to serve it.  Tonight, we're having this with chicken burritos and it is working very well.

Surprisingly delicious. Used one fresh jalapeño instead of canned chilies, used chopped grape tomatoes instead of canned, ate on warmed soft corn tortillas with shredded Jack. Could try adding black beans maybe.

My ratio was a little off, as I only had one can of hominy.  I also used three small heirloom tomatoes rather than a can, in addition to garlic powder.  Still the recipe turned out well.  I would have liked some heat, though
