This was a big hit with my family. I followed recommendations of using less tomato products so I cut it down to 26 1/2 oz. can of tomato sauce and 14.5 oz. of crushed tomatoes. That worked for me. I don't like cooked peas so I added frozen peas when the meat mixture was almost cooked. I didn't have green pepper so I substituted red pepper. I added 1 T. of chili pdr. to spice it up, next time I will increase it to 2 T. chili pdr. Thank you for submitting this recipe, I will definately prepare it again.

My whole family loved this dish, and it was easy to make too.  I've found that if you make too much, it's easy to freeze and serve as a quick meal later on.

This was good, quick, and not too expensive to make. I kind of halved the recipe. I used 8 ounces of macaroni, 1 lb of ground beef, only one can of tomato paste and sauce, and I didn't add the water. Everything else I pretty much left the same. I did use frozen peas though, since we're not too big on canned peas. I also threw in whatever seasoning I thought would be good, so I used some ground mustard, Italian seasoning, basil, and some crushed red pepper. I topped it with a little shredded cheddar and served it with some crusty bread.

This was a good recipe! I also thought the tomato base was a little too over powering but to change that all I had to do was cut out the tomato paste, and I used diced tomatoes w/ Basil instead of stewed. I also wanted mine to be a little less "watery" so I omitted the water and just used the juices from the canned tomotoes. My son is allergic to peas and corn so I made him a bowl excluding those ingredients and adding diced carrots & Broccoli. This is a very versatile recipe where you can add spice, take away, use different meats such as sausage, hamburger, stew meat, etc. The same with vegetables according to your likes and dislikes! Have fun with it, and find the right niche for your family!

This made way more than I wanted it to plus is tasted like only tomato. There was no point to measuring the seasonings accurately since the only way to get past the tomato taste was to keep seasoning, then I ended up putting to much garlic in and had to throw it all out, what a waste...

2nd time I've made this so this time, I made a couple changes I thought I'd pass on: I replaced the corn and peas with a couple cans of southwestern style corn (corn, onion, black beans, red bell pepper).  I also used rosemary/oregano diced (with liquid) for the tomatoes and let everything (minus the sauce, paste and water) simmer down to a nice thick sauce.  I replaced the tomato sauce, paste and water and with good old tomato juice until it was the consistency I prefer.  I did keep all the other ingredients the same, and it came out great!

I thought I would give this recipe a try and unfortunately I found it to be too tomato based and I love tomatoes. I think the paste was a bit much.  I tried to put more spices in it to lessen the tomato flavor, but it did not work.  This also makes a large amount, so scale down all the indegredients to about half.  Unless, you want to feed a large family. I will probably not make this meal again, sorry.

This is a very satisfying meal.  I scaled it down for 4 ppl and it still made a ton.  I altered the recipe a little:  no mushrooms or peas, I cooked the garlic with the meat and didn't have any parsley so I added a little oregano instead.

What a colorful dish. This turned out better than I had expected. I had to improvise based on what I had in my pantry. I scaled this to half and used one pound of ground beef, a can of diced tomatoes, mexican tomato sauce, a can of tomato soup and I did not have mushrooms. I didn't pre cook the pasta, I just added it in with the rest and let it simmer. Just add more water and this could have been vegetable beef soup. Thanks for a nice meal.

This goulash tasted really good, but took quite a while to prepare.  It makes a massive amount so it's a good thing it reheats well.  My husband is a big goulash fan so I will probably make it again, but will definitely half the recipe.

I thought the base recipe was great. I left out half the water, no tom paste, no crushed tom. I added my own homemade stewed tomatos, a can of diced tom, and only 1 large can of tom sauce. I added garlic directly to the meat mixture and worchshire sauce. I also used whole wheat elbow noodles (no one can even notice). then wa-lah perfect.

This recipe is really excellent. I did read over the reviews before I made it, and agreed that there was too much of a tomato base. I omitted the stewed tomatoes, and only used a small can of tomato sauce. I also used diced tomatoes. I only used a scoop of tomato paste. I added a touch more white sugar, and stayed true to the rest of the ingredients. Yum!

I omitted the stewed tomatoes and corn, increased the garlic(4 cloves), and it was a crowd pleaser! A perfect party meal served with garlic bread and arugala salad.

All I can taste is the gooey, thick tomato. I'd leave out all but the stewed tomatoes and add additional spices to give it some flavor.

We liked it okay, but way too many tomatoes.  I cut back and still had too many tomatoes.  If I make next time, I will one can of each (max)

I agree this is a bit heavy on the tomato.  I will cut back or cut out the tomato paste next time.  I halved the recipe and it still makes a huge amount.  We liked it ok.  Nothing great but easy to make and filling.

it tasted like tomatoes...
Luckily I tasted it while I was cooking - as any cook should - and augmented the recipe a little to suit my taste; I recommend 3 tablespoons of garlic, 3 tbsp of parsley (I just put it in until I could tell it was there), an 8 oz. container of shredded Parmesan, and 2-3 teaspoons of pepper.
...then it tasted like something - and it was so good!

I loved the bold, spicy flavors, mixed with rich tomato sauce. Used Johnsonville Sausage instead of beef. It added a little more flavor, and the end result was absolutely delicious! Great recipe.

Left out the mushrooms as my husband hates them. Otherwise made as written. Made a LOT of goulash so you had better like leftovers. Very good comfort food. I will probably end up freezing some for later.

I doubled up on the salt and pepper, because it was a little bland, but other than that, it is great.  I also left out the corn, because I can't eat it and it tastes fine without it.  Can substitute brown rice for the pasta if you need a gluten free option.

Made this as directed but without the mushrooms and nobody in my family liked this.  I ended up covering the whole thing in spaghetti sauce just to salvage it.  It was bland otherwise.

I increased this recipe to feed 50 people and made it for a Halloween party for the Motor City Eagles and it turned out great.  I left out the corn and peas and forgot to add the cheese, but it was a hit.  Will definitely make it again but maybe only for 30 people this time cause we had lots left over.

great hearty winter meal! I followed suggestions and omitted the tomato paste and I also used a can of mixed veggies. Love that this has so many variations and options.

Made it 2 times now. Great if you are not into the soupy style Goulash, Love the lightly sweet fresh taste. Great hardy meal that kids like too. Which I did leave out the mushrooms and peas. It was still good

This is a very versatile recipe!  Add or subtract any ingredients to your taste and you don't lose much.  My mom made something similar to this but added ketchup (which I don't care for).  I added a T. chili powder just to give a little kick but it's fine without as well.  This is a wonderful "cold winter day and I don't feel like going to the grocery store to buy special ingredients" kind of recipe!

I was looking for a great recipe that has a good variety of vegetables and I thought this was good. I made it for the first time tonight and loved it. However I couldn't taste the garlic at all I will have to add more next time. :) Also it was a lot of tomato taste but I think I just needed to add more seasonings, it wasn't overly soupy so the amount of tomato paste/sauce seemed right I think it just needs a lot more seasoning.

It was good and my family liked it too.  Very tomatoey!  Ya have to love tomatoes to like this one.  I actually used diced tomatoes instead of crushed and one less can of tomato paste.

Too much of a tomato sauce taste, and not much of a flavor.  We  usually make our family recipe, but thought we would try something new. Our recipe has tomato juice,  tomatoes, tomato soup & water for liquid. Your recipe is similar, except for the seasonings. I would not make your recipe again..

Tasty and Super easy to make but it makes a HUGE amount of goulash -- I didn't read the number of servings before making so that was my fault. 
I would change ratios a bit though.  The next time I try this recipe I am going to use half as much tomatoes that the recipe calls for and twice as much vegetables -- the tomatoes hide the other vegetables at the given ratios.  It does taste good though.

It was terrific but it makes ALOT!  It is just my husband and myself and I will need to freeze some of the leftovers.  The next time I will cut it in half.  I also added chili powder as was suggested by someone else.

I did not use any of the water.  I only used half of the tomato paste.  I also used 2 Tablespoons of Chili Powder.  I also do not like Peas so I used 2 cans of corn instead.  

Next Time I will be using more hamburger.

NOTE: This recipe makes a HUGE pot of sauce.

Very good!  I had one can of tomato sauce and one rotel, used frozen corn, onion, sliced fresh jalapeño, seasoned with pepper, garlic schriracha, and dash of chili powder.  I only had wide ribbon noodles and that worked fine.

Turned out very good, all my boys loved it!  I did omit some of the tomato sauce, corn and peas and doubled the water to satisfy my husband's tastes!  This will definitely be added to the dinner menu rotation!

This is good. I didn't boil the macaroni in a separate pot. I put it together, added the dry pasta to the saucepan and let it simmer until the macaroni was done. I used Prego sauce instead of all the cans of tomato sauce. I didn't add corn or peas only because I don't remember mom making it that way. Grab a loaf of crusty bread and this is an easy meal. Reheats nicely.

I really enjoyed tweaking this recipie based on the other reviews....It was sooo good! I omitted the paste...used tomato soup instead of the sauce, bout half cup of ketchup & no crused or stewed tomato but I did use about half can of diced tomato. After combining all the ingredients I topped off with cheddar cheese and baked for about 15/20 mins. Ummmmmmm good!

This was a good starting point for what I was looking for but I made some major modifications and everything turned out perfect.  After draining the ground beef, I seasoned it with salt and pepper as the recipe calls for, but also added about 2-3 tablespoons of Hungarian paprika.  I used half of a 24 oz bag of large macaroni, eliminated the tomato paste, stewed tomatoes, mushrooms, peas and sugar completely. I only used one 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead of the 30 oz from the original recipe.  Instead of the crushed tomatoes, I used one 15 oz can of diced tomatoes. I only used half of a bell pepper and half a 12 oz bag of frozen corn.  I used italian seasoning instead of the parsley.

I adjusted the 24 oz (3 cups) of water, increasing slightly to ensure enough liquid to keep the macaroni from sticking.

The resulting dish had the right balance of beef to macaroni to tomato, with the taste I remember from my childhood.

I added a little italian seasoning for more flavor, everything else stayed the same, it was wonderful. Ive never ate goulash before, and this will be my go to recipe for it.

Had it this evening. Cut back on the tomato paste (1 can) and use paprika and chili powder to taste. Lots of left overs!

It was easy to make but I didn't find this dish to be very flavorful. I probably won't make it again.

I really liked this dish, in fact it was hard not to have thirds. I followed some of the suggestions in the reviews, like eliminate the peas, tomato paste, 1 can of the tomato sauce, the water, and the sugar. I added a diced zucchini in with the beef/onion/peppers/mushrooms mix, and used one big can of San Marzano tomatoes instead of the stewed/diced tomato combo. It also needs more seasoning, in my opinion, so I added a heaping tablespoon of paprika, a tablespoon of oregano, and a generous amount of garlic salt. I cooked my macaroni separately but I suppose if you throw in the uncooked pasta into the goulash you can make this a one-pot dish, but you might want the extra water in that case. This recipe was quick to put together, relatively healthy with all the veggies in the mix, and downright tasty. Will definitely be working this one into the rotation at our house.

Made it for supper tonight...the only different thing I did was to substitute crushed red pepper for the cheese. It was so delicious...I like the way it stays a little bit soupy. I will be making this recipe instead of the one I've been cooking for 40 yrs. Thank-You.

LOVE IT!!!  I read the reviews before makingi this and they were very helpful.  Hubby loved it.  I used a can of dice tomatoes w/orgeano, basil and garlic and a can of regular diced tomatoes, also added cayenne pepper, worchestershire sauce, salt and black pepper.  After it was done and still hot, sitrred in some shredded cheddar cheese.  Defnitely is a keeer, and will make it again.

Good standby winter food. We like this recipe, but go even more American by using a jar of primavera pasta sauce instead of all the tomatoes and substituting green beans for the peas. I usually use a little less than a pound of macaroni. Makes enough for several meals.

Made a large pot.  However, it was rather bland for my taste.  Would cut back on the tomato paste.  I had to add more garlic, italian seasoning and oregano.
