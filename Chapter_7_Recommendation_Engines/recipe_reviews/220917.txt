This is under seasoned for our taste.  Mustard in the dressing would help a lot, and go well with the ham.   Hard boiled eggs would be a good addition as would celery.   ***Make sure the water the potatoes are cooked in is salted***   I used frozen peas that were just gently warmed as we don't care for canned peas.   Overall, this was well received and with a few tweaks is a nice recipe.   Thanks!

Baking Nana was right about hard boiled eggs as the original recipe calls for it. However, frozen or fresh peas are a no no as they have a totally different taste. Canned peas only! Instead of ham bologna can be used, but cooked chicken breast is the best! Plus no Ranch, please. Mayo is the right dressing :) This salad roots from the Soviet past, what Ranch are you talking about? :) To sum up:
- canned peas,
- hard boiled eggs,
- mayonnaise,
- cooked chicken breast.
The rest is fine.
