This was a weird combo but my family and friends love all the components so I decided to give it a shot. It's crazy how well these things go together and it was so easy to make. Definitely will be making again.

This was easy to make and had a unique taste- always a wonderful thing!  I dislike peanut butter anything but the cashew flavor, while similar, was delicious.  The ONLY thing that was off was the refrigeration time.  A minimum of two hours implies it will be fine in two hours.  I actually had to refrigerate this for 6 hours before it had set enough to be fudge- a disappointment because I had to serve it while it was still spoon-feed material.  Once it hardened though, it was great.
