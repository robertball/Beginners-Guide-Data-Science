This is a super crab salad, different from most mayo/sour cream based crab salads.  It's sweet and tangy, with just the right amount of everything!  My husband and I loved it!  It does take some prep time for the greens, but not a lot.  I'd suggest always using fresh lump crab meat instead of canned.  Next time we plan to serve it with egg rolls or soup and a crusty French baguette or artisan bread.  Sorbet completes a light summer meal.

nice and light.  I used a mix of spinach and boston lettuce.  I will make this again.

I found this salad bland.  The flavors do not blend well.  No one in my house would finish their helping.  It got soggy very quickly.  My bofriend ended up picking the crab out and eating it with a little cocktail sauce!  We didn't eat the rest. Very dissappointing.
