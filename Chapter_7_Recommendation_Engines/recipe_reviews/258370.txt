Excellent! And easy. Followed recipe as written. No issues with crystallization even after 7 days in the freezer. Easy to scoop as it is a firmer soft serve. This is my go to frozen vanilla custard recipe.

I am on a ketogenic diet so I tried this swapping out the sugar for xylitol and erythritol (1/3 cup ea). I also swapped out the milk for half and half. I split the H&H and cream, 1.5 cups each. It came out great! I can't eat too much at one sitting because of the dairy carbs but it is a nice treat. Serve in a frozen cup - keeps it nice and frozen.

Made just as recipe said but we wanted more servings so I doubled it as we were using an outside electric ice cream churn. Was awesome!  Everyone kept saying yum and quit talking to just enjoy the deliciousness!

This was excellent!  Very rich and creamy.  I added 1/8 teaspoon of xanthan gum to keep the ice cream from crystallizing.  It tasted like the best ice cream you can buy (and maybe better).

So super yummy! When I was heating the cream and milk I was stirring it consistently and watching for it to simmer, it hadn’t started simmering yet and then next thing I know it bubbles over and got all over the place. But I added 3 heaping scoops of coffee grounds to the cream while it was heating and strained them out before I mixed it with the eggs. Then when it was finishing mixing I added shaved  chocolate! It was a delicious coffee flavored ice cream!

This is my go to for an ice cream (custard) recipe.   The family loves it.  It does take several hours because you have to chill the mix then freeze afterwards, but it's well worth it.

Tastes like custard. I added Caramel to make it salted caramel flavored, tastes just like Culvers! Great recipe!

I've made this 4 times now. Every time I rediscover what a good recipe this is. IMO it outdoes commercial frozen custard like Abbott's,  and that's saying a lot!

Easy to make. I added the vanilla bean to the milk mixture while it was warming up and the caviar to the eggs. Chilled overnight in the fridge and strained as I poured it into the maker. Roommate said to keep it away from him because he would eat it all. Made 1 quart frozen. Will definitely make again as a base. Going to replace the vanilla with mint and add some guittard chocolate chips.

I made this following the recipe verbatim except I used imitation vanilla flavor instead of real vanilla. Oh well. I wasn’t sure if I had over-churned it because initially, the texture was very airy. Even after freezing overnight, the texture, to me, was like that of cheap ice cream (fluffy and light, not dense and creamy). I think the following morning, it had a marshmallowy texture but by a few days later, it somehow got more dense and better tasting. I churned it for 19 minutes but I think next time I will stop when the mixture is climbing out of the top of the ice cream maker. 

Otherwise, it’s not overly sweet, it’s creamy, but it doesn’t taste as rich or heavy as I would think given everything that goes into it. Next time, I am going to try only 4 eggs but even with 5, it’s not too “eggy” tasting. 

 Very good and I liked not having to cook the whole mixture but I think I might do that next time too. The mixture did not have a particularly thick or custard consistency compared to the previous time I attempted French vanilla ice cream with a different recipe.  I scrambled my eggs that time but immediately prior to that point, it was thick. This was very liquidy.

All can I say is I’ll never ever ever buy vanilla bean ice cream at the store again!!  For best results, cut the amount of vanilla extract in half and use a whole vanilla bean to get that intense rich vanilla flavor!

This is the best recipe for ice cream. It turns out amazing. What I do sometimes is if I want to make mint chocolate chip ice cream that is like custard, I add a teaspoon of mint extract and about a cup of chocolate bits and it so good.

I didn’t like it. It was too creamy for my taste. It had a great flavor, just too creamy.

The same recipe was in The NY Times, they suggested cooking everything at once without tempering the eggs. After whisking the eggs and sugar, put the milk and cream in the saucepan and heat it to 170• F and cool. I have done this over 30 times and it has never failed.

I used this as a base and added a fig jam to it during the processing time.  SO GOOD.  It's a great starter if you are looking for something for add in's.  It's also great plain.

I'm giving it five stars even though I haven't made it yet because it looks great and Chef John never lets me down.  I would like to know if the heated milk and cream are enough to make the eggs safe.  If anyone knows, please reply.
