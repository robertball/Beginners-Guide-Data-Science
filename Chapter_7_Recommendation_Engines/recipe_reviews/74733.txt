I used basmati rice and sour cream (and added less lemon juice as a result) instead of heavy cream and this was really tasty. I definitely recommend fresh or frozen asparagus as opposed to canned. If you can't get it then substitute another fresh veggie like green beans or zucchini/yellow squash, etc. I love pretty much anything Indian inspired but I'd never thought to add a creamy dressing to my rice before.

Very unusual and also pretty tasty. I think fresh asparagus would be better than the canned though (less mushy). I love the curry dressing.

This is a wonderful recipe!! I used it for a family dinner party and it was a hit. I ended up having to write this recipe down for four of my family members.

Delicious & easy!!! I used basmati & jasmine rice because I don't like brown rice(oh how I wish I did).  Absolutely wonderful, perfeclty proportioned flavor but next time I'll definitely switch to fresh asparagus.

Delicious! I did use fresh asparagus, however, steamed them until crisp/tender. And used jasmine rice to be a bit more authentic. After tasting it decided it needed more 'crunch', so I sprinkled some chopped walnuts on top...probably not so authentic, but fabulous none the less! Thank you for a great recipe!

So good, but I did double the dressing as the taste was too mild for us otherwise.

I made this for my husband who is Indian....I'm American & we are living in Bombay right now...he didn't find it that great...I wasn't able to find heavy cream so I had to make my own to use...I'm not too sure if this was the cause of it not tasting great...I'd like to think not...I also used basmati rice & I ended up adding some chili powder for spice...

This was pretty tasty. I used green bell pepper since I didn't have red, and I also didnt have asparagus, but it was great anyway. Thanks!

Very good overall! A couple changes: I left out the bell pepper, used fresh asparagus as others recommended, and used a mix of brown rice, black rice, and barley that I had on hand. Only downside was my fault: I served a gluten-free guest, and didn't realize the barley I added had gluten! Oops! I served it as a side to Masala Spiced Roast Chicken.

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe and neither were the other party guests.  I don't know what I did wrong, but it was pretty bland.

I served this hot.  I sauteed the veggies (fresh) with salt, pepper & curry powder, then added the cooked rice, then stired in reduced fat sour cream and a squeeze of lemon. Left out the fruit. I enjoyed this very much.  Thank you for sharing.

The apples did not work at all in this dish. I had to douse it with hoisin sauce to get it down. I did use tart apples, but even with sweet apples I don't see this working

Asparagus with raisins, curry powder, and apples...i'm normally the type that likes tons of flavor in my food but this is not an appealing combination at all. And I am not sure how this is Indian other than the curry powder. I gave points for attractive presentation and healthiness.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but this was bland and the flavors that were present did not mesh wellI used fresh asparagus in lieu of canned and also forgot raisins, but  I think I followed all the other directions. Glad to see others had better success.

I made Chicken Tikka Masala for my birthday and made this for my friends that are vegetarian.  They really loved it and asked  for the recipe.  My son even ate it saying this makes asperigous good.  I had to use canned asperigous since it is currently out of season. Looking forward to trying it with fresh asperigous.

I used jasmine rice and fresh green beans (steamed).  I love the red pepper/apple combination....surprised me that it worked well.  But it's very bland...I usually skimp on salt, but adding a little more than I normally would and little more pepper was a help but still bland.  I added some fresh pineapple and it made it a lot more flavorful...I  will probably make this again, because of the healthy ingredients, but noting to add the pineapple and try it with brown rice.
