I usually don't really care for tuna, but I LOVED this recipe! I was very pleasantly surprised given the short list of ingredients, and expected these to be dry once prepared....however, they were very flavorful and enjoyed by all my family, including my picky 1&1/2 year old toddler! I doubled the recipe to make 8 tuna burgers. I did not have tuna pouches, so used 2, 5 ounce cans of tuna. I used 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp each of salt and pepper. I was concerned after mixing all the other ingredients that adding the day-old bread would dry these patties out too much, so I omitted that ingredient. I fried the mixture by 1/4 cupful and flattened in the frying pan. They cooked up beautifully about 2-3 minutes on each side. This will become a regular menu item in this house! Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe!

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  My husband said he preferred salmon patties, but I think it's a good recipe to change things up on my menu!  I would make this recipe again.  I forgot to add the slices of bread, but I really don't think that it made much of a difference.  We also didn't eat it as a "burger", just as patties.

Quick and easy & everybody in my family liked it and asked for more. The burgers had a way better texture than the ones what require flour or heaps of bread crumbs.

Very very good and held together perfectly while frying. I doubled the recipe and added a bit of dill but otherwise left it alone. Made these for a friend for lunch that doesn't eat meat on Fridays and she loved them as well!

Great idea, came together quickly, tastes fantastic! 
I did sub 3/4 C. panko bread crumbs for the crumbs/bread cubes...for seasoning, used Everglades Fish & Chicken seasoning but omitted the salt/pepper...fried in butter, too...A funny thing, I put the lettuce & tomatoes on plate & drizzled with a drizzle of Pomegranate Vinaigrette, some got on the tuna and it really was good! 
Thanks, MareLou, for sharing your recipe...:)

This was quick, easy, cheap and delicious! The mixture appeared dry to the eye, but once I got my hands in to mould the patties, I realized they were the perfect texture. I added 2 tablespoons of a Trinidadian "green seasoning" (a sort of spicy, onion-y sauce) but otherwise, stuck to the recipe. Served on white hamburger buns with a side of sweet potato fries... yum!

I will definitely make this again. It is simple and was a wonderful change to the norm. I didn't have celery, so I used green peppers and it was still delicious!

This was so good. I just didn't have celery, but I put the patties over leftover pasta with sauteed fresh spinach and a jar of roasted red peppers.  I sprinkled fresh parmesan cheese over the patties after they finished frying.  The bread cubes really made it delicious. It was a great meal, thank you!

WOW!  I have never had a tuna burger and this was scrumptious.  Looking for something to make on Good Friday when I can't have meat and this came up as a suggestion.  I didn't have onions so I used onion salt (apparently turned out too salty for my boyfriend, so I know to use real onions next time), but I still liked it.  I added some lemon juice and a little panko crumbs to the mix for some extra crunch and flavor.  YUMMY!!  Can't wait to share with the rest of the fam!

I made this using one regular can of tuna that I crumbled up, and I think they turned out pretty good! The taste is pretty mild, so you could always add more onion (or whatever) if you want more flavor. I didn't have any day-old bread so I used the bottoms of two hamburger buns, since those are more dry than the bread I do have. One mistake I made with the first pattie, though, is that I formed it into a pattie and THEN placed it into the pan. It fell apart immediately, so then with the other 3, I rolled them into a ball, placed into the pan and then flattened with a spatula. Those held together quite well. Also, because these contain egg and I made them for my toddler, I put a lid on the pan to ensure that the egg was cooked thoroughly. I'll definitely make these again. Can't wait to see how my toddler will like them. I had to force myself to not eat his! :P

Only had canned tuna (5 oz) so I just cut the other ingredients down a bit. The only bread I had was rye so it was a bit bold, but worked. Instead of blowing up the fat/calorie content with cheese & a bun, I simply topped with lemon juice & I can say this was one of the best burgers I have ever had. This will be a regular in my kitchen.

I used canned tuna and this was not good. Other than that, I followed the instructions and it was not working for me. My husband liked it, but I think one could follow the same recipe using fresh tuna? Maybe give a good mince so it can be pattied? and this recipe needs acid

So good! I only had canned tuna (5 oz) so I just did one can plus 1/2 cup breadcrumbs (no bread). It was delicious. I served it without a bun, on top of a salad made of wild greens, dried cranberries, and raspberry vinaigrette. This is definitely going to become a regular meal around here.

I really like this recipe as a base. I do not eat bread so I just used panko bread crumbs. I used two single packs of tuna and one was jalapeno flavored. I added parsley and red pepper flakes. They were really good.

I don't usually buy Tuna in the pouch, I buy Tuna fillets in olive oil.  I used 2 cans so had a little more than 1 oz. of fish.  I made the patties according to the recipe.  It was very dry, so I added about a tbs. of Tartar Sauce and that helped.  They were a little flaky so next time I think I'll add another egg.  My wife and I loved them anyway.  I made fairly thick burger patties and sized them the the "large" hamburger buns (which are now the size the regular used to be)  I got two patties and a 3rd smaller "snack" patty  I toasted the buns, and added two slices of Swiss Cheese topped with salad mix greens.  Nice change of pace lunch.

This was great - almost as good as a crab cake.  I just used 3/4 cup of bread crumbs and didn't bother with making crumbs out of the old bread.  Seemed redundant to me.  Used one can of tuna.  I also added a couple tablespoons of Old Bay seasoning, which gave it a crab cake taste.  Will have to triple this recipe next time - it went fast.

Made it as is.  Very good.  I plan on putting it in a pita with some lettuce and tomato for lunch tomorrow.  I did end up making one large patty and quartering it.  So I'll get a couple of lunches out of it.  Maybe next time just add the shredded cheese into the batch, instead of just on top.

Simple and easy to make, but instead of frying, I chose to put them in the oven for 20 minutes or so for a healthier way of cooking. Two cans of tuna did the trick, reserving the liquid to make them more moist. Topped with lettuce, tomato, and a little bit of mayo on a roll, they were perfect for a Friday night  Lenten dinner.

Very easy to make. I made this recipe the first day of Lent for Ash Wednesday's dinner. There are limited meatless dinner choices during Lent...so it was something different to try. I liked it...I'll be making this recipe again.  :)
