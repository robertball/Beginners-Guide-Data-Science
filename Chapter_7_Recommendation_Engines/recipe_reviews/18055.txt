Please use caution when using MSG- has potential for severe reactions especially in kids and those who are prone to digestion problems. Side effects of MSG are not fun.

easy to prepare, however I didn't think it had enough cream cheese.  I added another package and more cheese.  tasted much better.  I also let it sit out an hout before serving and it was easier to spread.  I did also add crushed almonds on the outside and it gave it a nice crunch.
