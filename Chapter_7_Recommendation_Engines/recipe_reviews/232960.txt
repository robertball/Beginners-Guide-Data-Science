Super tasty.  I prebaked crust, added toppings, and finished in the oven, because my pizza was too big to safely get on and off the grill.

I saut√©ed the onions, garlic and mushroom first and then set-up the pizza with all ingredients added. The grill was set to 350-400 degrees and we placed pizza directly on grill. Six minutes later our thin crusted pizza was done! Paired with pinot noir and added this recipe to my favs!

I did not use the foil, placed the crust directly on the grill and grilled on low heat watching closely. The crust was pretty good.  Both hubby and I thought this pizza was just okay.

This is a delicious pizza and my husband loved it, even though he thought he would miss it being a sauce and pepperoni pizza. Now it is  our favorite! No problem grilling it by keeping the heat moderate...just keep it in longer. I also do this in the oven at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes.   I have frozen it after the pizza was grilled or baked and it turned out well as it thawed while baking in the oven. A real keeper!

Made this tonight and the pizza turned out really well. I will have to work to perfect the grilling part of it but the pizza tasted great even with a few charred edges.  I have to say though that the video that accompanies this recipe is right next to useless for showing how to grill this pizza so unless you want to watch an advertisement for Reynolds Wrap, you can skip the video and go right to making and trying this pizza.  Will definitely be making these pizzas again so thanks for posting.
