Fresh, spring-like way of preparing green beans. The cooking method and ice-water bath stop the cooking process and preserves the beans' vivid green color.  I'm not able to say if the measurements are "spot on" or not as I didn't measure, just sprinkled away to my liking, skipping the zest entirely as I was happy with just the juice. These are simple, tasty, perfectly cooked green beans I imagine would appeal to everyone.

You can use half the butter and olive oil AND you can re-use pan you boiled beans in (for less clean up) by pouring in ice water directly into pot with  (drained)beans and then removing beans to your serving plate and then returning beans and finishing saute'ing still in same pot.  After s & p  (a lot) these were very nice accompaniment to baked ham and scalloped potatoes.

These were delicious! I added in only half a teaspoon of butter with the evoo. Aside from that I followed the recipe as is, except at the end I squeezed some lemon juice on rather than garnishing with them. Typically these would be eaten as a side dish but I ate these on top of baby spinach and grape tomatoes as a salad, no need for dressing. The rest of my family enjoyed these as well, will make these again.

These flavors are awesome with green beans making it a light and springy side.  I was disappointed in my dish because I used oldish frozen beans that were past their prime.  Not the recipes fault, obviously.  When the recipe says the garlic should be dark brown, be careful.  Burned garlic is awful and will wreck the dish.  It can go from nice toasty to burned in a blink.  I served it with a spicy meatloaf and it was a nice fresh counterbalance to the dinner.

These are awesome!  I used in season fresh beans from my local farmers market.  I make my asparagus similar to this recipe, except I never thought to add the fresh parsley and lemon zest.  I will be using this from now on for the beans AND asparagus!  thanks:)

These beans were excellent....and fresh beans is a must. Loved the flavors of the garlic and lemon zest.....I had to use dried parsley since I had no fresh on hand. Great side for our meatloaf last night. Thanks!

I'm giving this recipe, as written, only 3 stars because of the amount of fat.  I made the this as written and we all thought it was to greasy.  After making it again with only 1 Tbls butter OR olive oil it was perfect.  The parsley and lemon is wonderful.

This is a very close version of Galloping Gourmet's recipe before he went diet mode.  Parsley adds just the right touch.

We loved these green beans! Nice, light, flavorful, but mild enough that they would go with pretty much any entree. These had a great flavor that was refreshing with the lemon and garlic. I think next time I make these I might add some more parsley because I didn't feel like that flavor really came through with the lemon. I will make these again for sure. Thanks for the recipe, Rachel C!

these are very tasty and right now the green beans are terrific.  The only thing i did different was use a bag of fresh string beans you steam in microwave.  I only microwaved for two minutes instead of recommended time on package so they didn't over cook and then I continued on with the recipe.  One less pot to use :)

Easy to prepare. Everyone enjoyed this as it was "fancier" than plain old green beans.  Presented well and tasted good. Forgot water bath but don't think it took anything away from the dish.

Delicious, fresh tasting and easy.  Blanched and refrigerated beans early in the day and saut√©ed just before serving.

This is a delicious vegetable side dish. It's very simple to prepare and also quick. My only complaint is when transferring from pan to plate it was dripping with juices from the oil and butter. Not exactly the healthy side dish I imagined. Although I hardly used much butter or oil, next time I will certainly use less. That being said, I recommend this dish.

This is a great recipe for using fresh green beans. This time of year, I also like to add some home-grown Sweet 100 Cherry Tomatoes added at the end and cooked until softened. Thanks for posting!

These were so good! I buy fresh beans a lot and mostly use them for snack or in my salads. My family loved them although I couldn't put the lemon slice on theirs. They were crisp yet cooked all through delicious side dish. I will be doing this again and again.

I find green beans to be the most boring vegetable on the planet and am always looking at ways to give them more flavor.  This recipe was delicious.  I‚Äôve tried green beans with garlic in the past, but adding lemon gives it a little extra something.  My only change to the recipe is that I omitted the parsley, because I couldn‚Äôt find it in my local grocery store.  It was still a very good recipe without that major ingredient.

The green beans were a perfect compliment to Thanksgiving dinner. Instead of boiling them on stove top, I cooked them in a small amount of vegetable broth in the microwave. Other than sprinkling an herb blend called Old World Seasoning (store-bought) to the finished dish, I followed recipe as written. Guests asked for recipe; I introduced them to Allrecipes.com.

Loved it. I don't usually have fresh parsley or lemon, so substituted dried parsley and lemon zest, and refrigerated lemon juice. Making it again I'd cut back the dried parsley but thought the lemon was fine.

Delicious and very fresh tasting! I eyeballed all of the ingredients, adding to my preferences. I also added lemon juice but skipped the zest. I had some feta cheese crumbles on hand, so I added a little to see how they'd work, and they went really well with the beans. Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe, Rachel C.! UPDATE 7/17/18: Used fresh parsley, lemon zest and half of the butter. Skipped cheese.  Nice bowl of this for lunch on a hot and humid day.

Brought these to our family Easter dinner,  and they were a hit. A nice side dish with a bright flavor but not overly spicy.We have green beans often, and I will definitely make this dish again when I have fresh parsley on hand.

I basically cook my meals from AllRecipes! I LOVED this recipe string beans,green beans whatever u want to call them. I broke the recipe servings down to 4 and bathed them in lemon juice. Next time I increase the servings and enjoy even more!

Excellent and simple.  Can be completed in less than 10 minutes.  I left out the sugar.

Delicious! Only added fresh sprigs of Rosemary to the skillet while frying the beans, then removed before serving.

This was a good accompaniment to our greek-style kabobs.  I skipped putting the beans in ice water and did not saute them quite as long as called for, as we prefer a crisper bean.  I liked the combination of fresh lemon and parsley.

We loved it.  The kids liked it too, but the lemon was a little much for them, but not for us.  My 18 yr old son's friend really liked them too.  He said they were refreshingly different. We served it with a roasted pork shoulder.  Thanks for something a little different.

This was tasty and made for a nice side dish, but it wasn't anything special. The butter and olive oil made it more bland, to me. Maybe I made it incorrectly.

We often season green veggies with olive oil and lemon, and we really enjoyed the addition of garlic and lemon zest in these!

I used canned instead of fresh. The only I would do different is slightly less Parsley next time. Would make again though!

These beans were great, but when I make them again, I will blanche them a bit less and saut√© them a bit longer. The lemon was a great addition.

I made this for my Sunday guests.  I liked the idea since it works with shrimp, but the lemon challenged the garlic and wasn't pleasing to my palate. 
I like lemon and parsley, or garlic and butter, but the lemon & garlic on the green beans just wasn't the right combination.

These were delicious and easy. No need to use that much fat; I used just the oil, no butter. The missing star is because they were a little bit bland.

These were very tasty! I didn't have fresh lemons, so I used 3 squirts of lemon juice. I also used dried parsley and threw in some dried dill.
Turned out great!

I used this recipe for asparagus and it turned out delish. skipped the first step and went starlight to the frying pan. Needs about 4 mins of additional cooking time. Great for the Easter veggie!
