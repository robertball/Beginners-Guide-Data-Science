I'm really sorry for giving such a low review but this turned out terribly. I tried every trick I know to improve it and I could barely eat it. If I were to make this in the future I'd omit all of the water; it was just way way way too watery and bland. It was better on the 2nd day at least.

This was just OK for us. I followed the recipe as written except I didn't add any of the water and only 2 cups of milk. I also added celery seed pepper and cheddar cheese to give it some flavor.

Haven't made this but but looking at it I can easily tell there's way too much liquid. I will omit the water and add if necessary. Will also season with Calendar's Greek Seasoning. I was looking for a potato soup w. frozen hash browns and this one fits the bill. Thanks

Honestly I altered it up a little bit! I cook this recipe in the crockpot! I only add one bag of hashbrowns one box of chicken broth and then enough water to make sure we have plenty of soup. I let that cook all day. 30-45 minutes before serving I add the rest of the ingredients and use some milk to mix with corn starch for thickening. I also add shredded cheese and garlic! It is amazing and so yummy!
