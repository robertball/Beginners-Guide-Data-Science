This is as comforting as meatloaf and mashed potatoes. I usually make mini meatloaves topped with ketsup and bacon. Mmm I still have to slice them to go on top. I didn't change anything in the recipe. It was so so good. Perfectly creamy, not mushy, meatloaf was still moist, and the leftovers reheated well. My husband (super picky eater) and 21mo. Old son LOVE it. Try it, you will not be disappointed! It's like the most comforting cafeteria food(in a good way, like back in the day when the food quality standards were higher) that tastes just the way you would expect. I can't say enough JUST MAKE IT!

I followed this recipe to a T, as I had leftover meatloaf and tater tots to "take care of."  It was delightfully tasty (for me, my husband and the kids), and put a new twist on those ingredients so that it didn't taste like leftovers at all.   The only thing I may alter next time is the cooking time.  I only needed to cook it for about 35 minutes total, as the cheese got too hard on top.  Note:  This is also a heavier meal, so serve it up with some light side items like salad or apple sauce, etc.   YUM!

This was excellent! We used frozen hashbrowns instead of tater tots and it worked perfectly. The only negative was that we had to cook it twice as long for it to be hot in the middle. But the taste was great!

Hey, that was surprisingly good! I halved the recipe and it was the perfect size for the 4 of us. I didnt use the cream of chicken or onion as I had niether. Cut the meatloaf 3/4 inch thick for substance, used the whole 12oz package of seasoned asian vegatables (thus eliminated most of the season salt) as their arent near enough veggies in this dish,Cooked as directed.YUM.

I made a few small changes. I eliminated the can of cream of chicken and added a half cup of milk or so to make a thinner sauce. I did not add the seasoning salt because the cream of mushroom soup was salty enough on it's own. I did cube up the leftover meatloaf and folded it into the sauce ingredients and I used Crispy Crowns instead of tater tots. I DID NOT TRY THIS MYSELF--but my three boys ate the whole thing in one sitting. My husband is STILL talking about this almost a week later. I thought it was pretty amazing because a) this used leftover meatloaf in a new way and b) this recipe called for all ingredients I had on hand. Thumbs up from our family, I will absolutely make this again.

Even my pretty picky husband liked this. The only thing different I did was put just a bit of cheese on each piece of meatloaf at the beginning so it wouldn't dry out, then 5 minutes before it was done I added the rest so it would melt right before serving. It was really good!

Yummy! What a great way to make another meal.  I did add cheese in the beginning of baking & covered with foil while it baked!

I tried this mainly because I had left over meatloaf and had no clue what to make for dinner.  Well I was very surprised; it's not bad at all.  Great use of left overs, thanks for sharing.

This was pretty good, but using my personal meatloaf recipe, with the ingredients, exactly as listed, was way too much sodium, fat & calories. I changed all ingredients to low sodium, reduced fat versions. It was ok. Worth trying it out to remake meatloaf leftovers, but the entire family, ages 5, 9, 18, 26, 35, 46 & 72 voted to continue having leftover meatloaf sandwiches, rather than have this again. I make meatloaf "cupcakes" sometimes, packing the meat into muffin tins & topping with mashed potato "frosting" & tomato "cherries." My 9 year old asked that we try the potato/soup mixture in this recipe in place of the usual toppings, do we may try that. All in all, no one complained but no one asked for it again

Followed the directions fairly closely until it came time to stir in the tater tots. Tasted the mixture and thought it was pretty bland so....I added some home made salsa, tasted again....added granulated garlic, tasted again, added more salsa. Tasted pretty good so added the tater tots, put the left over meatloaf on top....added a can of chopped green chiliâ€™s. Spread them on top of the meatloaf. cooked in convection oven at 350 for 20 minutes, added the shredded cheddar and jack cheese, cooked for another 35 minutes.

Delicious!   My husband finished his plate before I sat down with mine!  I added some garlic powder and garlic salt.  I also used a 4 cheese blend and added some milk to the condensed soup mixture.  turned out perfect, and very pleased I now have a new way to use leftover meatloaf.

I loved this recipe as did my husband. I cut it down to half the recipe as it was just the two of us and only used a can of cream of mushroom soup. I also put on more cheese because we only had medium cheddar. I am going to be making this again but will add more onion and maybe some garlic. I am also going to try this with Tuna in place of the meatloaf. This recipe could be very versatile I think with other meats or even without.

A good stick to your ribs meal and a great way to use up those bits of bags of hash browns, tator tots and frozen veggies.  I did make a couple of changes just to lighten it up. I used used 98% fat free soup, a splash of milk and topped it with fat free cheddar cheese when it came out of oven.  No difference in taste or texture.  I did cover it with foil to cook, just to keep it from drying out.
