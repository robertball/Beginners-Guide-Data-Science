Hmmm. Tastes no different from the scrambled eggs I've always made that don't have mayonnaise in them. I can't imagine what mayonnaise adds that makes them better, it's just oil and more egg. Perhaps it's the beating to get the mayonnaise incorporated or the gentle cooking the recipe advises. Adding mayo to scrambled eggs made me feel weirdly icky for some unexplainable reason and since I couldn't detect any benefit from it, I won't try it again. It wasn't bad, just not better.

Moist, glossy, and absolutely delicious. It works best to whisk the mayo and water together first, then whisk in the eggs. I use Kraft mayo and follow the recipe exactly, but increase it for larger amounts. HINT: The "salad dressing" option in this recipe is referring to Miracle Whip (or the like), NOT prepared dressings like Ranch or Italian. HINT #2: For best results, I recommend using real mayo, not Miracle Whip.

As a person who does not like eggs, I was excited to try these with such glowing reviews.  I tried not to overcook them having to put them back in the pan twice and they still came out mushy and grainy. I used Hellmans. Ketchup couldn't even save them.

Sorry to rain on the parade, but I didn't much like the mayo taste. I'll be sticking with my 2 egg/tbsp milk/s&p scrambley recipe. Delicious!

After years of experimentation, only one improvement to be noted.  Instead of "slowly melting the margarine over low heat, adding the eggs and stirring constantly until the eggs as they cook" which tends to cause cooling of the pan and sticking..I suggest you heat up the empty pan till hot an keep the heat on high... add the margarine (or butter), swirl to melt, sizzle and coat the pan.  Then add the eggs.  Don't stir for the first 30 seconds to a minute, then quickly stir and shut off the heat.  After another 30 seconds to a minute, stir again and quickly plate.  The result will be no sticking and creamy eggs that are steaming hot but not a bit overcooked.  Then add the salt and pepper.

It tastes alright, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that I was eating egg salad, not scrambled eggs. I'd attribute that to the mayo. Next time, I think I'll use sour cream or some sort of dressing.

Well, my husband could not taste any difference with the mayo. He did not say he did not like it, but he did not say it was any better...I do want to try adding sour cream though. Thanks!

Must've done something wrong. I doubled the recipe, but these never did set and no one would even try to eat them after they way they looked. Totally wrong texture. I'm puzzled...how could anyone mess up scrambled eggs?

I couldn't taste the difference between these eggs and my eggs (I don't add anything - sometimes just a splash of milk).  I think the mayo is a good addition for those who overcook their eggs - it will keep them moist.  I always take my eggs out when they are slightly underdone.  They continue cooking while they sit on the plate, so they'll be perfect by the time you eat them.  If you're a person who always makes rubbery eggs, then this recipe is for you!  The mayo should keep them moist.

I wanted to try this recipe because of all the wonderful reviews.  To be honest, I couldn't tell the difference between this scramble, and my regular milk and eggs scramble.

This is THE recipe for perfect, fluffy, yellow (not browned!) scrambled eggs.  Mayo is the key!  I often put a splash of milk instead of h20, and don't measure so I may not be exact, but it's pretty hard to screw up scrambled eggs! I've tested so many different ways of making them over the years- in the grease from the bacon, with sour cream added in, just milk, seasoned, etc. but a glob of mayo and a splash of h2o/milk, cooked in butter,  produces PERFECT scrambled eggs!  And they're right about putting the salt & pepper on at the end, I always added it into the raw eggs, but I was doing it wrong! It's better just on the finished product.  I'm a pretty darn good cook and never thought I'd need a recipe for something as simple as scrambled eggs, but I guess I've still got a few things to learn :)  TIP: Whisk/fork the mayo and liquid (h2o or milk) together FIRST, then add the eggs... This results in a smoother, creamier mixture without the chunks of mayo.

I just didnt think they were all that great. Cream works just as good for me. But it has made me branch out to try different things in my eggs.

Very good - key to fluffy scrambled eggs still applies: let the pan do the work for you (do NOT mix constantly)  only mix enough to prevent the formation of an omelette... (mix less in the beginning, and more towards the end)

My Dad was a Chef.  You can get the same fluffiness with a smidge of baking powder instead of the mayo.  Keeps the eggs fluffy longer.

I wanted to try this recipe to see what the to-do was about. There were some pretty passionate bad reviews...all over eggs! So, I can honestly tell you that these eggs did turn out perfect. I used Miracle Whip though, so maybe the real mayo is a bad idea..??. My advice...don't take an egg so seriously! Life has much bigger worries than how good a scrambled egg is! Sheesh!

Fantastic!! Who would have thought to add mayo to eggs? Used Hellmans; not salad dressing. That would have really thrown off the taste of these amazingly light and creamy scrambled eggs. Yes, the mayo doesn't entirely mix in when you're beating, however, mayo is basically eggs and oil, so the lumps will disappear when you start to cook. Great job "what's his face" and please (no pressure here) keep 'em comin'!!

This is the way scrambled eggs should be! I increased the recipe for 8 servings and used Miracle Whip. I did add the water and the s & p before cooking. I know it says not to, but I personally like salting during cooking and think it tastes better that way. Awesome recipe! Fluffy, perfectly cooked scrambled eggs. All of my 5 children (including my most picky 4 yr old) LOVED them and wanted more!

When my DH suggested breakfast for dinner, I thought really - you have to be kidding me.  Needless to say I'm not an egg fan and after cooking for all these years you would think I could get scrambled eggs down pat.  Nope - either too liquidy, too rubbery, etc.  Found this recipe by Whats His Face and thought I've got nothing to lose.  End result, delicious, moist scrambled eggs after reading reviews that suggested whisking the mayo and water first.  No strong mayo flavor at all. Thanks for the recipe.

Found this recipe a few days ago and tried it the next morning.  I've had it every morning since for breakfast.  Easy, fast and yummy.  I was on the phone with my mom and my sister and told them about it.  Now they're hooked too.  Love it!

I always cook my eggs with water, to make them fluffy, so I thought this would be a good change of pace.  It didn't taste very good.  There are better ways to add flavor.  Won't be doing this again.

Cooking eggs this way is more about fluff and texture than a taste change, and it works marvelously thanks WHF.  
if you want to switch up the flavor a bit, add a dollop of whipped cream cheese to your egg mixture.  that makes a smoother screggle and definitely adds a sort of tang to the flavor.

I tried this recipe with mayo. I couldn't taste it, but was good. I tried it with cream cheese and chedar cheese and it turn out awesome. Oh, instead of water, add a little milk. More creamier and flavorful!

I urge people to please try the recipe as written the first time.  But I am elderly (when I went to school, there was no  history class) and I must restrict my cholesterol intake so I only eat egg substitute. It's close but it's not eggs. So I tried this (I know mayo is made  w/egg yolks... but 1 teaspoonful?)  It really helped.  If you use egg substitute for scrambled I urge you to try this. Adds a new, and better, dimension. And, had this not worked out, I would not have rated it because it is not the original recipe. Many thanks WHATS HIS  FACE.

I wish I had this recipe years ago. Makes the eggs so moist, no more dried out eggs for us.
I can't imagine anyone not loving these eggs!!

I really didn't like care for this at all.  The mayo didn't want to blend into the egg mixture so I had little mayonnaisy clusters in the egg.  Maybe it would have tasted better if that didn't happen, but a strong taste of mayo is really not what I want in my eggs.  I think it's better to stick with the tried and true eggs and milk.  Sorry :(

AWESOME! I thought I was destined to forever make half burnt flat eggs.  I was even embarassed to make them when guest stayed over.  But oh this morning, I was proud to place fluffy YELLOW eggs on the table. Now I cant wait to make the perfect bacon, egg, and cheese croissant with these fluffy egs.  MMMM-MMMM-GOOD!!!  BTW- I cooked these with the perfect bacon strips this morning.  I placed the strips in a pan w/a lip covered with foil. Its best not to make them overlap.  Bake for 6-7 minutes at 425 degrees THEN turn the pan 180* for even baking for another 6-7 minutes. Restaurant balance of crispy and chewy to go with the perfect eggs.

I prefer adding skim milk like I always have, the mayo was too heavy. I don't like my eggs glossy. I'll stick with my original way.

Wow, I really had my doubts about the mayo, but no, it was delicious!  As I'm writing this, my oldest is saying, "Mommy, lets have more eggs, please!"  My youngest relunctantly eats eggs, but is goobling this up!  I can't wait for my husband to try it, as we usually only make scrambled eggs when he's here, but I'm pregnant and craving some eggs!!!  :)  Shh, just don't tell him mayo is in it!  For those who don't like the mayo taste, I didn't notice it, so I'm wondering if you're putting too much?  *Actually, I just made the second batch and doubled the mayo to see if it'd make a difference.  This batch is even better!  So I'm confused why others are tasting the mayo, because we still can't taste it.  To each their own.  :)  Thanks for the great recipe!

How can you not taste a difference using the mayo? I also use a tablespoon of milk in place of the water, I learned this trick from a friend.  These eggs are really fluffy and moist and made to be served right away.  You will love them if you love eggs.  I haven't tried the previous suggestion of ranch dressing, but I plan on it.

am glad I finally tried these.  I used egg beaters and lowfat Hellmann's but they were so fluffy and light.  Sprayed my pan with Pam spray.  Creamy, soft, and fluffy.  It is amazing how adding just a bit of mayo and water can make the difference.  I usually just spray my pan and throw in the egg beaters and even on low heat, they never turn out this fluffy.  Made a breakfast wrap with a w.w. low carb tortilla, turkey sausage link, and ff. cheddar.  A very nice light breakfast.  Tuna sends a big thanks, my friend!

You are spot on!  I've been making scram eggs this way for years - don't remember where I got the idea - maybe I read your recipe on this site back in '06 & just don't remember - if that's the case then thank you! - My crew wants these every weekend - Because I have 3 football players, 2 cheerleaders & 1 who just loves food (an aspiring chef currently in culinary school who brags about these scram eggs)I adjust the recipe from 2 to aprox 18-24 eggs (if you ever want tips on how to make Thanksgiving dinner for a small community just come to my house) -- anyhow, back to the eggs, I don't add water or milk - not sure what the benefit is - If making a full blown weekend breakfast I use the sausage or bacon grease in place of the butter to cook the eggs in - really unhealthy but really yummy - Oh yea, most important thing recommended is to not over cook - because ANY scram egg recipe is yucky if it turns out rubbery (my opinion) - Also, (for those who gave a negative review) I've added to much mayo before - just doctor it up by chilling it and adding stuff to make egg salad sandwiches- serve for lunch instead - get creative & add your fave stuff to it for breakfast burritos you're only limited by you're imagination - LOVE this site - A BIG THANK YOU to everyone who submits recipes & gives feedback (positive & negative) I know I'm a better cook for it!!  
And thank you "WHATS HIS FACE" for compelling me to write my first review.
                          THE END

I have been making scrambled eggs this way ever since my grandmother told me how, when I was a teenager, back in 1951. I have always used Best Foods mayo and water, and real butter, not margarine. Remember not to overcook, or put salt on them while cooking (makes them tough). Salt & pepper them after serving. If you don't like the taste of mayo, use less....if you do, use more. Don't use salad dressing or store brand mayo.. use Best Foods. Tastes better. Sprinkle with a little cheddar cheese, if you like, or dump catsup on them like my dad did!

Better than the last scrambled eggs I've eaten.
Not to mention very simple to make as well.

I made this because I had company coming over and I wanted restaurant quality eggs, not the laissez-faire-whats-in-my-fridge scrambled concoctions I tend to experiment with every weekend, with varying results.

I followed the instructions, using 8 eggs and added and extra 1/4 cup freshly minced onions.

It was FANTASTIC.

Agree with those that said go with sour cream.  It does make them creamy.  And margarine in the pan adds tons of taste.

Wow!  I finally made some decent (yes, delicious!) fluffy scrambled eggs. How easy. My husband's first bite and he asked 'what's in here?' UGH. I hadn't even tasted them yet. I asked what was wrong with them and he said they were delicious! He was really surprised that there was mayo in them. And they did come out fluffy. I've never been able to make fluffy scrambled eggs before. Thanks WHATS HIS FACE!

Ah, the great egg debate!  First of all, really, they're just eggs. But very good eggs.  I mixed the mayo/water first.  Texture was perfect. Maybe I tasted a hint of mayo.  Seems like an easy foolproof way to perfect eggs (maybe I just wasn't good at it before!).  And as a bonus, they didn't stick to the skillet nearly as much!

I was a little skeptical about the mayo, I normally just add milk when I'm making eggs, but this was a good recipe. This recipe isn't going to give you anything other than really good eggs, so if you're looking for something "unusual" or an alternative taste, this is only a scrambled egg recipe. It makes regular scrambled eggs really good. You can always add in anything you want. But as far as scrambled eggs, this is a great recipe.

These were delish!! I used miracle whip (which I normally hate!!) and it gave them some added volume and a great flavor (don't be scared off, its very mild). My one suggestion is to make almost double the servings for the amount of people. I put in 4 servings for 3 people and it wasn't enough! As well, maybe don't tell everyone whats in them, as they get grossed out when they hear its mayo! All the men in my house thought they were better than normal..I'll make these again.

I can't believe this simple recipe has eluded me for so long. Oh my, was it easy and delicious.  I've always loved scrambled eggs, but every time I make them, they turn out overcooked and dry. These were perfect. Soft, fluffy, and a great flavor.  I didn't use the water.  And I took them out a little early, like the recipe said.  Mmmmm.

I am not a fan of eggs, but these were excellent.  I used Hellmans mayonaise.  I will definately be making scrambled eggs this way from now on.

I couldn't really taste a difference in these eggs, but the texture was very mushy.  I won't make them this way again.

This is similar to what I do and I always really
enjoy the result, but instead of mayo I use 1 tablespoon of sour cream and half a tablespoon of garlic and mix it into the eggs when they are almost fully set (plus lots of butter cubes in the raw egg as it cooks.)

Simple and perfect! I made it exactly as the recipe indicated and the eggs were great! Best yet! Be careful at the cooking stage. Take them off the heat when they are still moist. Also, keep turning as you cook them.

I have been doing this since I learned how to cook at age 15, sans the butter and water though,  and I love it.  I was afraid to share it with people as they might think I was weird.  Thank you for affirming.  Mahalo.

While the thought of eggs mixed with mayo scared me, I have to say this was actually pretty good. I followed the directions as stated except for turning up the heat to get this going. Most of the reviews I read stated that the mayo wasnt tasted. I have to say that as I was eating this dish I came to realize in fact I did taste the mayo (Hellmans Real) and it did make me think of eggs Ive have in the past at restuarants.  I rated this a 5 based on the fact that there can be more to a scrambled egg other than just mixing some eggs together.

I tried to be open minded about trying this out. I didn't like the mayo mixed in the eggs. The only thing I did different was I used butter. Anyways thanks for the recipe but I didn't like it sorry.

Great taste and texture.  I think the mayo does a better job than the usual milk.  Definitely mix the water and mayo first.  Another bonus, the clean-up was much easier in my cast-iron skillet.

It made my eggs much fluffier thank you. Added olive oil instead of butter since I'm allergic and it came out just fine. I like my eggs a bit runny so it can win marathons ;)

Nothing special. I couldn't tell there was any mayo in there at all. They taste exactly like my regular scrambled eggs, which I scramble right in the pan with a spray of Pam and Lawry's seasoned salt.

Folks, I don't know why all the negative reviews but I have a feeling that they come from reviewers attempting to use MIRACLE WHIP for the mayo... DON'T USE MIRACLE WHIP.. USE HELMANS REAL MAYONAISE. The flavor difference is significant. I followed the recipe the first time exactly and enjoyed it; the second time, I added a touch of Kosher Salt, fresh ground black pepper and a touch of garlic and onion powders... YUM.

I made this recipe exactly as written.   It wasn't any better or worse than my usual scrambled eggs.    The mayo didn't add any benefit of taste to the recipe.   After I tasted without salt or pepper, I added my usual pepper to the eggs.   I find that eggs are salty enough on their own to not need additional salt for my palate.   I do cook my eggs on low and start them out in a cold pan, just as Julia Child's recipe advises.   I also turn off the heat when they are just set and a little too moist.   I scramble them for a couple seconds off the heat and serve.

I saw recipe by email this morning just as I was about to go scramble some eggs so I tried it.  I was a bit skeptical about the mayo thinking the eggs would be greasy and not rich without the milk or half and half.  But I was wrong!  They are great, no funny taste and the entire family loves it.  Of course I added cheese at the end and some hot sauce after I put them on my plate but that's just normal for me.

The eggs came out light and fluffy, but nothing special. Added some cheese at the end, which please the kids.

Good easy egg recipe, however not up to par with my favorite scrambled eggs (the kind you get in catered breakfasts).  I used mayo with cracker pepper because it was what I had on hand, and had to add salt in the end.  The "low heat" instruction isn't very specific.  I used 3.5 on a 9 scale and would probably do at least 4.5 next time as it took forever!  And I think the slower you cook it, the harder it is to tell when they are done.  Better than just plain old scrambled eggs for sure though.

Sorry, but I didn't like this at all.  The mayo just added unnecessary fat and calories and kind of a slimy texture even though they were thoroughly cooked. Guess I just like eggs in my eggs.

These eggs were absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect.  The secret is to cook on low and stir constantly.  This is my new way to do scrambled eggs which is a favorite in my family.  Thanks for posting.

I was hesitant about this because my family doesn't even like eggs. But I'm running out of breakfast meals so wanted to try something to see if I could get my family to eat scrambled eggs. And this was a hit. The mayo takes away that nasty 'egg' taste. I noticed that the eggs took on the taste of whatever I mixed in with them, cheese, ham, onions etc...  My family actually ate them and asked me if they were artificial eggs.LOL I guess if you love eggs, this isn't for you. But if you're not big on eggs, this is a way to change the flavor.

Instead of mayo, I added creamy ranch dressing. In my opinion, it's better than the plain mayo.

Yes I was skeptical about trying Scrambled Eggs Done Right because I always thought I cooked scrambled eggs right with eggs, milk, s&p, and cheese on top. I was amazed at the taste of these eggs. It didn't taste too much like mayo but gave the eggs a slight sweetness. Needless to say, I did not top the eggs with cheese like I usually do and did not use butter but Pam for the pan. I wanted to do a compare and contrast of my eggs vs these eggs. These eggs won the battle so I will alternate making these eggs but will continue to make my own.

I admit to being skeptical about this recipe, but I was out of milk, with a sick kid who wanted some scrambled eggs, so I gave it a shot. These were delish! They turned out smooth and fluffy, just perfectly done!

I just served this with a light supper  tonight and I have to say it was awesome.  The mayonaise gives this enough oil to keep the texture nice a nd fluffy rather then crmbley. The kids loved it too!  I will be using this recipe from  now on for scrambled aggs. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent! Since mayo is made with eggs, this is a no-brainer, full proof way to have fluffy, gorgeous, tasty eggs. I use cooking spray and never add water or salt, just a dash of pepper, and my kids and their friends claim it's the best eggs they've ever had!

I just had to make these eggs.  After reading all the reviews, I just went into the kitchen and whipped them up.  I did as others said and whisked the mayo & water first, beat the eggs separately and then added the eggs to the mayo, water mixture.  Cooked on medium low heat and did not stir constantly but instead just lightly turned them in a non-stick skillet with the melted butter.  I sprinkled with salt & pepper and topped with shredded monterey jack and cheddar cheese and covered until cheese melted.  These eggs were absolutely delicious.  If you tend to overcook your scrambled eggs like I do, then this is the recipe for you!!

3 stars because they were light and fluffy but lacked flavor for me. My 4 year old who loves eggs in any form walked away from these. Didn't finish them and wasn't interested in more.

These were fantastic! My very picky husband and children loved them. I couldn't taste the mayo at all, but it did seem to make the eggs much lighter and fluffier. I loved the texture. I will definitely continue to make my scrambled eggs this way!

Okay, I thought what's the big deal.  Eggs are eggs.  I was wrong.  There really is a right way to cook eggs and this is it!  Follow the directions to the letter.  Cook over low and do not salt until done.  My whole family loves these and my youngest won't eat eggs unless prepared this way.  Fantastic!  Cooks up well in bigger batches too.

I joined just to rate this recipe. I've had two eggs everyday since I tried this recipe! Soooo good! They are light and fluffy with an extra kick of flavor. Toast a bagle, heat up some bacon slices, and top with eggs and american cheese for a quick, filling breakfast!

I hate mayo and won't eat anything with it in it.  After seeing all the high ratings for this, I printed it out and gave it to my husband.  I let him know how they rated and told him to try them maybe even one day make them for me but not tell me.  Well he finally did this weekend.  They were the best scrambled eggs I ever had!  I'll be honest and say I will never make them myself (I really can't touch mayo) nor will I eat them if I know they were made this way, but I am sure I will have them many more times because my family loved them too.  They just have to hide the secret ingredient from Mommy!!  Thank you Bill for another wonderful recipe!!

i added miracle whipe and 2% milk... hmm who knew a simple trick would make eggs taste so good.  The mayo is not gonna melt when you whisk it into the egg.. no worries.. but it does give it a creamy flavor at the end.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

Man! These are the best homemade scrambled eggs I ever had. I even made one the regular way for my son and compared them both. You can definitely tell the difference. Oh, I even used light mayo because that's all I had. Mmm.

GREAT!  Unbelievable how such a simple recipe can produce such great results!  I have made eggs this way many times since reading the recipe, and it has turned out wonderful every time!  I will never make scrambled eggs again without a little mayo and water!

these were good but i didn't notice any difference from the scrambled eggs i usually make, the main thing is to take off the heat while still slightly undercooked,do not over stir

Awesome!  I found the mayo was hard to wisk into the eggs and became a little chunky - so i tossed it in the blender on 'beat' for a few seconds and it was perfect!! I think this made them even fluffier.  Yummm...

This was a really good recipe!  I was surprised that it was so good with the mayo in it.  The mayo didn't mix in right away, not until cooking.  I'm not sure if it was suppposed to do that but it turned out great, light and fluffy.

I never liked eggs until I tried this.  I subsituted miracle whip for the mayo, and doubled it.  So creamy and delicious.  Perfect with ketchup and grits.

Yum!  I'm not a fan of mayo, so didn't have it around. I used homemade plain yogurt instead, and it turned out fluffy and delicious as promised!  Yep, I'm a believer now.

I'm making my scrambled eggs this way from now on. Yummy. The Boy gives 'em 2 thumbs up. Who knew using mayonnaise would improve so much on the taste? I took the advice of graygourmet and tried this recipe, so thanks to him (or her?) and thanks to Whats His Face.

After trying this recipe, I like my scramble eggs better - eggs and sour cream - and, since mayonnaise is so much more expensive than sour cream, I think I'll just stick with that.

The eggs were really good, but more important were the instructions to cook them over low heat.  Many people cook eggs with heat too high, and the protein seizes up, making them tough.  I always cook my eggs with milk, so I used that instead of the water.  Adding milk, cream, or half & half  achieves a similar soft, creamy effect, even without mayo, if the eggs are cooked on low heat and with butter.  I also salted them before cooking, like I always do; this had no effect on the texture.  However, I put the usual amount of salt in, not remembering that the mayo contains salt, so they were a bit more salty than I would have liked, but still good.

These are the best scrambled eggs ever...tried this recipe a few years ago, and it's the only way I'll make them now.  Hubby loves them, and so has every person I've ever made them for.  They try to figure out what makes them so "different."  :)

I've also made omelets out of the same recipe, and they're always great!

I tried this using milk instead of water and it was fantastic.  At my daughters, she was out of mayo so as some other suggested I used sour cream.  OK but not nearly as good.  I did whip the mayo and milk first then add the eggs.  Didn't taste mayo per se but they did taste richer and were fluffier (sp) then regular eggs.

Tried this, but thought my mother's English way far better.  She'd whisk up the eggs with a little pepper and salt, add a little milk, then melt  a knob of butter to her pan.  The eggs seasoning and milk would all go in at once and would be stirred as the mixture came together.  Hers were small curd type because she stirred constantly.  I wait a little longer befor stirring, so.the eggs turn ot glossy and tender.  Suggest a non-stick pan, otherwise clean-up can be a real chore. susanc4000

Granted, scrabbling eggs should be no big deal, but with the add of just a pinch of mayo, my eggs this morning were excellent. And I like the comment about no salt or pepper before they're on the plate. Excellent thought, and then I also folded in a piece of american cheese once on the plate too! Thanks.

I made these eggs this morning and my husband & I loved them. I used Hellmann's 1/2 Fat mayonnaise. I used 4 eggs with 1 tablespoon each of water & mayonnaise. No salt & pepper. There was no mayo taste & they were light & fluffy. I liked mine with no salt but my husband, being a salt lover, used a little. I have used milk & shredded cheddar in the past, but I imagine cream cheese would be delicious.

Absolutely amazing.  I really don't like scrambled eggs, the taste of the cooked yolk puts me off.  I only eat over easy.  These came out moist and not rubbery, with an excellent texture and light, unassuming taste. The mayonaise (Miracle Whip Lite, in my case) eliminated the nasty dead bird taste of the hard yolk.  Not the same taste affect as these scrambled eggs, but imagine deviled eggs withOUT mayo.  Thank you for informing me that scrambled eggs could asctually taste good!

After seeing all the bad reviews I wasn't sure I wanted to try this or not.  I've been trying to duplicate the eggs from my favorite breakfast spot for a long time and this one came pretty close.  I used Lite Miracle Whip and mixed that with Skim Milk first then added the eggs.  I also didn't stir constantly either and they came out great.

Followed directions precisely but eggs came out very "pasty" and not at all appetizing.  Sorry to say, but this recipe will not wind up in my "recipe box".

Well, I tried them today and made them for my boyfriend.  There was really no difference in these and the regular scrambled eggs.  He didn't notice anything different about them.  I tasted them, and wasn't impressed.  I'll stick to the regular ole way of scrambling eggs.

I tried this with the mayo and didn't notice much difference between my regular every day scrambled eggs. I have made scrambled eggs with sour cream and basil or dill mixed in and had good results......

Been looking for a good scrambled egg recipe.  This one came out perfect. Great flavor and ex excellent texture.  Be sure to scramble thoroughly before cooking to ensure they come out fluffy.

I've been incorporating mayo into my scrambled eggs ever since i came across this recipe.  I Just came across again, and just realized that i do use about a tsp of mayo, but for a batch of 6 eggs and no water.  Definitely helps to break down the mayo as much as possible.

Was really scared of trying this and really hesitant to feed it to kids. I just has these guilty thoughts of feeding them eggs and mayo (mmm mommy these eggs are delicious but my heart hurts lol).  Recipe turned out okay though.

I just made these, exactly as the recipe calls for and think they were absolutely amazing! the eggs were light, fluffy... not oily and i didn't taste "the icky mayo flavor" so many other reviewers mentioned. 

from now on this is the only way i'll make my scrambled eggs. :)

Not bad. I used Marzetti's salad dressing instead. The eggs had some zing to them this way. Definitely a recipe I'll use again. Thanks for sharing, I never would have tried mayonnaise or salad dressing in eggs otherwise.

I was really unsure about trying this recipe. I would never have thought of using mayo in scrambled eggs but it works. The eggs are really fluffy. I didn't tell my husband that I did anything to them and he asked me what I did differently because they were so fluffy. I will definitely make these again! Thanks for such a good recipe.

I have never had scrambled eggs that were so moist and fluffy! I will always make them with this recipe. Thank you!

The salad dressing idea seemed a little strange so I tried the mayo version.  I think it overpowered the egg taste way too much for my liking. Not something I'd want to try again though.

Had to try these because it seems you either loved or hated them, and the verdict for me was that these were great!  They were moist and fluffy and I could barely taste the mayo.  To be fair though, I only had veganaise (ironic, huh?) so used that, mixed it with the water first until it looked like cream and then added the eggs.  I'll definitely use this for scrambled eggs in the future.

These are truly wonderful eggs and so easy.  Like Kaye Lynn I used Craft Mayo and added no salt or pepper.  I did add a very little sharp cheddar just before the eggs were finished.  I also topped with a little of Frank’s Original Hot Sauce.  The eggs were smooth and fluffy with an extremely good overall flavor.

I just made these and they were fine.
I did not use water, I used milk instead.  And didn't taste the mayo at all.  Only a 4 * because eggs can't really blow your socks off... They were just eggs, but they were still good.  Not sure what the problem was with the previous reviewers, maybe they didn't do it right??  Good job, thanks!

I LOVE breakfast and make it often for supper, and this recipe was awesome!  The secret to making sure that your eggs don't have a mayo taste is to mix the water (I used skim milk) and mayo before mixing in the eggs, and make sure there are no lumps of mayo.  I added cheddar cheese and hot sauce on top.  This was great!  Thanks for sharing.

i used a bit more mayo, not measuring, but i cooked 8 eggs and added a good size dollop, a bit of milk and a bit of water and some hot sauce.  Cooked to perfection, and very moist, not dry just perfect.  Guess this is how i'll be making my eggs in the future.

We had breakfast for dinner tonight (pancakes, eggs, bacon) and I used this recipe for our scrambled eggs! I followed the recipe exactly, just increasing the ingredients to use 4 eggs (so everything got increased proportionatly). I used store-brand (Publix) mayo and I didn't notice any "mayo flavor" in the eggs, so I don't see why some people did. To me, the eggs didn't taste any different than they have in the past, before I used this recipe and just used milk. But, it was still good - just not anything new or different.

I overcooked the eggs and I forgot to scramble them because i was looking for some ingredients, nonetheless, they turned quite good. this is an awesome recipe for your eggs if you ant an egg sausage and cheese sandwich.

the reason why it says not to over cook because it zaps the flavor out.

I was browsing allrecipes.com AND watching The Food Network late tonight...which made me very hungry!  After searching the cupboards and fridge and coming up empty, I decided to try my hand at scrambling eggs.  I'm a begining cook, so this recipe was perfect.  Super easy, hard to mess up...even I at 12:30 am could do it (WITHOUT the smoke alarms going off, as has happened before).  The eggs were fluffy and delicious and a great confidence boost and late-night snack!

AWESOME RECIPE. I reallllly don't care for eggs much and I thought I would make these for my family and I decided to have some as well, because of the great reviews. My goodness these are yummy. I am not sure if it is the mayo that took the eggy flavor out or maybe just because they didn't get dried out but I will have and make these again and again.

Yum!  The mayo added a really nice flavor.  I didn't add any butter, just used a non-stick cooking spray and the eggs were great.  I added lots of black pepper and that was all they needed.  Thanks WHATSHISFACE!

I've made these twice and the first time they didn't come out as good as I had hoped.  The second time I added salt and pepper while they cooked despite what the directions said.  I also added some Cayanne pepper and this time they were awesome!  This recipe is a keeper.

I was intrigued by using mayonnaise as an ingrdient, but quite frankly this doesn't taste any different, or look different than my usual way of preparing scrambled eggs (with a small amount of milk or water).

I used low fat mayonaise (not the salad dressing), and then topped the finished product with sauteed minced sweet onions and super-sharp white cheddar. DELICIOUS! This is the best!

These were really good.  Just before putting them on the plate I salt and pepered them.  I will definitely be making them again.  Our boys requested them again for the next day.

These eggs are truely amazing!  I thought I knew how to make scrambled eggs (using milk) but these are fabulous!  Moist, fluffy and delicious!  I used Hellman's and followed the recipe exactly.  Make sure to cook over LOW heat.  Definitely a keeper!!!

I used to cook my egg substitute until it was dry and omelette-like, but now I see how delicious creamy eggs can be!  Add a little feta cheese and spinach, and they're out of this world.

Just finished eating this. Thumbs up. I think the key you need to point out in this recipe is LOW HEAT. Used mayo this time. Could definitely taste it. Will use Miracle Whip next. Maybe some milk instead of water the next. Salad dressing, hmmm? Thousand, ranch, french? Will let you know. Thanks

Perfect way to make scrambled eggs. The mayonnaise is perfect for keeping the eggs looking and tasting moist instead of overcooked and dried out.

I was skeptical over the use of mayo but I thought, why not? They turned out SO fluffy and pretty looking I felt like a chef!  I tasted them and they were so good without salt/pepper even!  I added cheese for the boys and we were all happy. Thanks!

Not very different from the way I make mine. I add milk and this adds mayo. I think the mayo gives it a better taste. Thanks for the idea.

Mayo in scrambled eggs? I just had to try it! Made these up this morning. These are very different! I was really thrown off by how soft and moist that these were. Took a bit to acclimate but these were good. Thanks for the post!

Five stars only because it’s Scrambled Eggs!  But it’s eggs cooked in whipped eggs with oil, the flavor you’re getting is the oils from the butter.  You’d get the same flavor without it. Thanks for sharing!

I used bacon grease instead of butter.  I like my eggs made in bacon.  They were very good light and fluffly.  Will definitively make them again.

The first time I made this I substituted milk for water; they were very gooey.  So the second time I didn't add milk or water; they turned out good.  And both times I used Kraft Olive Oil Mayonnaise.  Definitely a unique approach to scrambled eggs, though according to my taste preference the texture was still too gooey.

Great simple recipe for scrambled eggs - either on its own or as a base for other recipes. I've never thought of using mayo (I usually use milk). I didn't find it changed the flavour at all, but the texture was better, and I can never use up my mayo fast enough so I'll probably be making my eggs this way from now on!

Where did the rule against putting milk into scrambled eggs come from?  I've been cooking them with mild for more than sixty years and THAT'S the way I like'em.  I might be inclined to at least try them without milk if someone would explain why they're better.

I like to put meat in my scrambled eggs but they always turn out kind of heavy.  Watching the video I learned I shouldn't do that. I heated the crumbled bacon placed it in my bowl then I cooked the eggs with no seasoning  stirring until they where done. I placed them on top of the bacon with a little cheddar cheese. They turned out really good and they where not heavy.

My go to recipe for scrambled eggs only involves eggs and putting a little oil, butter or margarine in the frypan. I thought this was crazy to add mayonnaise to scrambled eggs but I needed to buy Hellman's mayo anyway so I gave it a try.
They turned out wonderful.  There is no taste of the mayo but it just makes the eggs much moister and for me provides enough seasoning so that salt or pepper is not needed at all.
A keeper!

I did not try the mayo. However, I used buttermilk ranch dressing to add flavor to my scrambled eggs and omelette mix. I gives the eggs a great savoy flavor.  For every two eggs I add one teaspoon of buttermilk ranch dressing and mix until they are fluffy. Then process to scramble them the same way in a buttered pan.  My family loves it.  *Try mixing in  a bit more dressing for added flavor.

I used Heavy cream. Cooked the egg mixture very slowly. Also have added this egg mixture to pan sausage and finely diced potatoes just as the sausage and potatoes are done, it's a really good scramble.

ADD THE SEASONINGS IN THE EGGS AND USE HEAVY CREAM INSTEAD OF MAYO before whisking thoroughly!  Heat fryer on med. then turn down to med. low as soon as the egg mixture is added.  Stir slowly allowing curds to form and reach the desired size.  Turn off heat when the eggs are still just a little underdone (they will continue to cook as you plate them).  The difference is amazing!

I first saw this recipe as a video on the daily emails sent out by allrecipes.com    I subscribe to the adage "Nothing ventured, nothing gained."  In the video, as apposed to the written recipe, the mayo and water are whisked first, then the eggs added and whisked.  I think this must make a difference.  Also, in the video, an 8" non-stick pan and a rubber spatula are used.  Since I didn't have the written recipe at first my initial attempt came out perfect.  Unlike the video, I began cooking the eggs like an omelet, letting the eggs set in the hot pan and using the rubber spatula to raise the edges to let the uncooked eggs fill in.  Once the eggs were about half cooked I started scrambling them.  In the video it was explained that S&P added while cooking would cause the eggs to turn out tough. 
BEST scrambled eggs I've had!

A better method is to use a tablespoon of heavy cream per egg, beat with a whisk just until the egg is well broken up, add to a medium heated butter and immediately turn down the heat to low.  Be patient and slowly gather the curds as the eggs cook.  Finely sliced green onion tops and finely diced jalapeno pepper will enhance the flavor immensely.   Crawfish tails, cooked shrimp tails, diced pork or beef roast are excellent additions.  Bon appetit !

I really prefer plain old scrambled egg without water (adds fluff) or mayo (adds a sweetness that masks subtle egg flavor).
Edible, but not "done right" IMHO.

These are the best scrambled eggs ever!  The only change I made was to use 4 eggs instead of 2 with the 1 tsp. each of mayonnaise, water, and butter.

They tasted fine. Maybe they were a little creamier; I'm not really sure. Mainly, I thought they just tasted the same as when I make them with just a bit of water. I liked the eggs okay, but not enough to make them this way again.

After reading some of  the the reviews, I altered the ingredients a little bit. I added 1 tablespoon of mayo and water. They came out pretty well, but I do agree they are fairly simple scrambled eggs and nothing particularly special.

I was missing my measuring spoons today, but I figired that a chef doesn't need measuring cups to tell whats right, so I added what looked like a teaspoon (butter and mayo), and it came out really good. The scrambled eggs were perfect just needed a bit of more flavor into it. Otherwise, I would do it again.

Usually I don't add water or milk. Just as eggs are more solid I add cream cheese in small chunks. My mother started this with cottage cheese, but I like the creamier cr. cheese much better!

I used less than a tsp. of mayo, and the flavor of it was overbearing. I used Hellman's mayo. I will never use mayo in place of milk/cream again.

Slowly heated eggs in pan with melted salted butter, whisked mayo with water beforehand as suggested. They came out creamy and delicious, no additional salt needed.

I followed the recipe with the only change being number of servings. Even when I heated up my portion a couple of hours later having rushed off and left it in the fridge, it was still probably the best scrambled eggs I have made. Big thumbs up!

The only change I made was adding a very small amount of skim milk, rather than the water. It was ok but didn't really taste that different than regular scrambled eggs.

Made this according to the recipe, using the tip to whisk the water & mayo together before adding the eggs, and was very happy with how they came out! Creamy, fluffy, beautiful yellow color - my two young sons, 15 mos and 4 yrs old, both enjoyed them also! As suggested, I didn't add salt & pepper til the eggs were plated.
For the record, I have made them in a similar fashion before using sour cream, which was also good, and lately had just been making scrambled eggs with a splash of milk + salt & pepper, and this method (with the mayo) definitely made fluffier, "prettier" eggs than using just milk. I'll make them again!

I don't whisk my eggs because that breaks them down and I use Butter, not margarine. Use a rubber spatula to fold them, instead of a whisk. Taking them off the heat for a bit if they start to sizzle, but stir constantly. Last I Finnish with a dollop of Crème Fraîche  and then add salt, pepper and fresh chives.  Fluffiest scrambled eggs I have ever had.

Eggs were light and fluffy but I think it was using the cooking technique that made them that way.  I get the same results just adding a couple teaspoons of milk or water then stirring the eggs constantly while they cook.  I couldn't taste the mayonnaise.  Will just stick with my regular eggs.

I cannot believe you constantly print recipes that use margarine that is so unhealthy as is oils like Canola. Olive oil and coconut oil are the oils of choice for healthy cooking.I did not make the recipe for these scrambled eggs  because I do not believe mayo is necessary. Try a Tablespoon of fat free Half and half for each egg and I think you will find that you will have wonderful scrambled eggs   use Butter or spray the pan with coconut oil.

Meh.  I'll stick to milk or cream.  It's not the additives that make or break scrambled eggs.  It's the cooking temperature and technique.  Low heat, don't stir & scrape too much.  Develop large, moist curds and pull the pan off the heat as soon as that is achieved.  No big secret here

It was okay.  For me the trick to scramble eggs is to let the eggs cook for a bit w/out stirring them, I run the spatula around the rim of frying pan to keep the eggs loose, and then as the eggs have started to cook I gently run the spatula through the eggs to scramble them.  If you stir them too much or too frequently they become particles of egg instead of nice size pieces of  scrambled egg.

Made this recipe. I love mayo but certainly not in eggs.  Did not like the taste at all. Will stick with your basic scrambled eggs.

The theory behind this is that the fat in the mayo  improves the texture of the eggs.  But, I've found this is better achieved using sour cream, cream cheese, or even whole milk, as the fat source.  With those, it adds the wonderful creaminess, esp when cooked very slowly (a la Gordon Ramsey's infamous video), and I don't get the off putting mayo/salad dressing taste in my eggs.

Incredibly easy and delicious.  It works out to be 1/2 tsp. of mayo and water per egg incase you want to increase the yield.  Go with Kaye Lynn's review...she's right on the money!

Meh, didn't do it for me.  If you want fluffy, moist scrambled eggs or omelets, use a stick blender and and, once blended well, add 1/2 teaspoon of corn starch and 1 teaspoon of water. Best, fluffiest, tastiest eggs EVAH!

I never add anything to my eggs, and also do not premix them. I simply break 3 or 4 in a hot skillet with a little butter. Mix very gently to get most of the white infused...you will still see a little which is perfect. Be sure not to overcook. I like mine moist with just a little sea salt and coarse ground black pepper.

Just like I make 'em, but I make my own mayo (made with avocado oil) and I would never use anything but Kerrygold, or any butter from grass-fed cows.  Also, source your eggs from local farmers. This way, you not only get a better tasting  breakfast, but one more nutritionally dense.

Just did it and it was awesome. Don't usually like eggs but I used the mayonnaise lite and water. Cooked up (on a low flame) beautifully and tasted as good as any scrambled eggs I've ever tasted. Little S & P and bam!!!
THANK YOU !!

While I liked the eggs, my husband wasn't all that impressed. I used Kraft Mayonnaise in the recipe, and my hubby said to leave out the water, but I did make them with the water, and didn't tell my hubby I added it. I asked my husband what he thought of the eggs, and he said they were ok, but not great, and he'd prefer I make them the usual way, by just adding milk. I will make them again, and replace the water with milk, as I am curious to see how they will turn out. All around, this is not a bad recipe, and I don't think it deserves 3 stars or less. For those who are starting out in making scrambled eggs for the first time, I think this is the perfect recipe to try.

I loved the difference in texture of the scrambled eggs with such a small change with the mayo - I even used low cal mayo - a slight change in flavor which was very pleasant - no salt needed - I did mix the mayo with the water first then added as another person suggested.  I for sure will do it this way from now on.. Thanks much

This was just delicious! I have no idea what's up with the negative comments. I added a teaspoon of mayo to my 2 eggs, and that's all I added! then when I cooked them over low heat and sprinkled some cheese over it, it was perfect, you don't even have to add salt or pepper :)

I am amazed at this recipe! Really good for mimicking that delicious restaurant style scrambled egg! I absolutely love mayo and was ecstatic to see this recipe. Was delicious and I will make it again! I whisked the mayo and water until it was all mixed, added two portions of egg whites and whisked then added the eggs. Used pam for the pan, to cut calories and had a low cal dinner! best ever.

So the other reviews I saw are all talking about how the mayo doesn't really do much for this. I haven't tried this with mayo mainly because I don't like mayo and it says with mayo OR any other salad dressing. Since I don't like mayo, I went with thousand island dressing, and it added flavor. It was delicious, so if mayo doesn't seem to do anything for it mess around with some dressing. This is a new personal favorite

I really enjoyed this way of making eggs!  I didn't get a strong mayo flavor, but it did change the flavor of the eggs a bit, and I liked it!  I served these on biscuits with bacon and cheese, yummy!

Not bad. The key is to not over-cook them and keep scrambling while in the pan until the eggs are fluffy and still a bit moist. Over-cooking will just dry them out. The mayo offers just a hint of flavor, making this dish just a little bit different.

They were nothing special. I have made better ones with adding butter after they are cooked and a little shredded cheese.

I don't think the mayo does anything.  You're basically adding egg to eggs.  A nice ingredient for me has been a table spoon of whipped cream cheese just as they are almost finished. Just fold it right in.

I had no idea why this was going to be better than "regular" scrambled eggs, but I was game.  And the verdict - absolutely delicious!

These were delicious.  However, I still love my normal way of making scrambled eggs just as well and it does not have the added fat.  Hmm, I guess it will just depend on what kind of mood I am in as to whether or not to add or leave out the mayo.  Thanks for the recipe though!

Fantastic!!!  After reading several comments both positive and negative, I decide to make these scrambled eggs.  I followed the measurements in the recipe to the "T".  The one thing I did which I think made these perfect was I used my bullet to mix the ingredients thoroughly.  There were no bits of mayo left using this method.  They cooked up perfectly, and I do not like my eggs wet.  I could find nothing wrong with these eggs at all.  I will be making these again and again.  They were a really big hit.

I use half and half instead of milk and mayo, and a dash or two of hot sauce. I think the key is to start at a medium-low temperature so that the eggs don't get tough. I do salt before I cook, but add black pepper after- it hits a different part of the palate than the hot sauce!

Although I grant that these WERE better than my regular scrambled eggs recipe, it was not such a difference to make it so that everytime I make scrambled eggs I use this recipe. But this is a good recipe if you want to add a little extra flavour to your scrambled eggs.

This is a good recipe for those needing help scrambling eggs.  The key to great scrambled eggs is low heat and DON'T overcook them.  Once removed from the pan, they continue to cook on the plate, so take them out BEFORE you think they're done.  (Of course, this is individual preference - my mother in law LIKES her eggs cooked well-done!)

There was a slight improvement on the standard scrambled egg flavor here, hence 3 stars. I whisked and only added mayo, no water. They were cooked over low heat (which i think is probably the only way to do proper scrambled eggs but that's just me) and after I tasted a little without topping, I opted for cheese and a dash of salt over toast.

I liked these a lot!  I never thought of adding mayo to eggs, but it gave them a nice flavor.

Although I usually add a dollup of sour cream we were out so I tried the mayo. It was nice! I need something to take away that slightly sickening (to me) aftertaste eggs have, and the mayo was perfect.

I was hesitant to try this because thinking of salad dressing in my eggs made me queasy, but to my surprise, it tastes great!  I used salad dressing because I can't taste real mayo very much.  I also think I will try mixing the salad dressing and water first, like someone suggested to see if that makes it any easier to mix.  (I had troubles with the salad dressing wanting to clump up.)

Doesn't have anymore flavor than regular scrambled eggs.  My family said they were okay, but wouldn't be upset if they didn't have them again.

I have to agree with some of the others. This wasn't bad (I couldn't even taste the mayo), but it tasted to me just like normal scrambled eggs. The texture and everything was the same to me.

I added 1tbsp of Mayo into my 2-egg-mix, in a pan that had 1/2tbsp of butter melted in it. The eggs themselves turned out edible in terms of eating them alone, I would say it has a cheesy or zangy flavor, Zangy-Eggs.  It's nothing SPECTACULAR! I'd give it 4/5 because it's very simple, adds a nice light zangy flavor to something I usually dislike(I've NEVER liked eggs in my life, but grown to be okay with scrambled eggs + ketchup recent, etc) since of it's simplisity, you just can't complain, Period.

The mayo definitely fluffed up the eggs. The flavor was much less bland than regular scrambled eggs. We will definitely use this trick in the future.

i added onions, mushrooms, bacon and parsley. Cooked in a pan on medium heat with a knob of butter until brown just before adding the egg mixture. Delicious and probably the easiest 5-min meal to make!

I thought these were good as far as scrambled eggs are concerned. My boyfriend loves eggs, so I figured I'd try making them a new way. He seemed to like them and I took a bite and thought they were really moist and creamy. If you regularly overcook your eggs, try making them this way. They are really moist! They seemed to end up more dense than normal eggs - not as seperated and fluffy but super good.

I have to give 4 stars because I love scrambled eggs, and I love mayo. I did like the mayo taste with my eggs, but at the same time, trying to watch my weight/eat healthier, the taste was not so spectaclular that I would prefer the additional fat and calories of the mayo in my eggs. This was good, just don't know if it's "calorie worthy" enough with the mayo. Being skeptical, I will definately try this again to see if the taste is worth the extra calories and fat.

Fortunately, I couldn't taste the mayo. It lent itself perfectly to the texture of the scrambled eggs. If I didn't prefer fried eggs, I'd enjoy this scrambled egg recipe more often! It really was good!

This was good, but nothing extraordinary.  My kids did not know the difference from my usual scrambled eggs.  I did use milk rather than water, and added some cheese at the end like I usually do.

Very good. Made this morning, used the water and mayo to mix into the eggs. Added some chives too. Didn't butter the pan, just used a little Pam spray. The eggs were a nice consistency and looked beautiful. I would never have guessed adding mayo made that much of a difference. And I couldn't taste the mayo at all, just perfectly cooked eggs.

These were wonderful!  I could taste just a hint of the mayo in them, but it was in no way overpowering.  I ate them with some toast and it was a good, hearty breakfast.

I just tried this recipe it turned out good.  I added a little of the powdered ranch mix to the mixture. The eggs tasted great could not taste the mayo.

I have said for as long as I can remember that I don't like eggs but I loved these eggs!!!  We made them for my husband for Father's Day and they were a great addition to the Fluffy French Toast that I also found on this site.  I used Lite Ranch Dressing.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I made it with the mayo and the only addition I made was a sprinkle of cheese. I'll definitely do this again but next time maybe even try it with the Ranch dressing.

I thought these eggs were very good, as did my family. I incorrectly assumed I had mayo on hand but ended up using light ranch dressing instead, which I whisked together with the water before adding the eggs. I was very skeptical about not adding salt and pepper until they were finished but I ended up not adding any at all. The eggs seemed to have lost that 'eggy' flavor that I don't much care for (restaurant scrambled eggs never have that taste),they were light and very fluffy, and they were flavorful just by themselves. Weird! My husband was shocked about the ranch dressing but we'll add it every time from now on.

The secret is to cook them on low heat, stirring constantly.  I then add sharp cheddar cheese to the top when almost done and cover for a minute or two.

Tasty! I used Hellmann's Real Mayo and added no salt/pepper.  I agree to whisp the mayo and water first then whisp together with the eggs.  Easy to prepare, and the kids ate them up and asked for more!

Okay, I rarely cook meals "as good as his momma did it" but my husband said these scrambled eggs are the best he's ever had. My kids loved them too. I used to make them with cheese, milk, and vanilla but never again! 

I didn't have real mayo, I only had miracle whip but it was so good anyway!

Nice and fluffy. Make sure to wisk the water and mayo together first then add the eggs. Also, the more you invest in the eggs, the better they taster. DO NOT ADD SALT.

I tried it just as directed.
I must admit they were pretty good.  However, I always use an immersion blender when I make scrambled eggs. My regular eggs turn out this good without the mayo.

I made these eggs using 3 egg whites and one whole egg, with 2 tsp. canola mayo, and 2 tsp. water. They really were creamy, light and fluffy. I like my eggs a little seasoned with light garlic powder, black pepper and salt.

It was pretty yummy and moist. the eggs didnt dry out easily. Remenber this is a basic recipe, if looking for something diffrent complex or new, i would not choose this. Makes a lovley base to fiddle with though and is dead easy.

I tried this recipe this weekend, and my picky husband gave a WOW response said ‘this is an EXCELLENT scrambled eggs.’  I have never had success to make the ideal scrambled egg that my husband likes till I found this recipe.  For myself, I liked it too as it does taste like from a restaurant.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

Used Italian dressing instead of mayo since it was the only dressing left in the fridge and the ranch was already expired. They tasted fantastic. You wouldn't believe there was salad dressing in there. A sure-keep recipe.

I was really skeptical about mayo in eggs, but this was excellent. I'm going to make it for family next time we do brunch and not tell them what's in the eggs until AFTER THEY EAT! I forgot the water though. I wonder if that'll make a difference?

YUMMY! This were absolutely delicious! I just got all four of my wisdom teeth out, so I'm only able to eat soft foods. I had a mad craving for scrambled eggs, and I found this. So, I made this with 1 teaspoon of ranch dressing, and then when I was cooking it in a skillet, I added mozzerella cheese. When it was done cooking, I dumped it in a bowl, and added some salt and pepper. When I took the first bite, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. They're so creamy and fluffy, it's just amazing. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe- you've made my day! :D

The eggs turned out great, and they were like the eggs you'd get in a restaurant! This is coming from somebody who has no cooking experience whatsoever too! I'll cook all my scrambled eggs like this from now on.

Didn't taste much different than regular scrambled eggs, but since I love scrambled eggs, I'm giving it five stars.  I put mayo & mustard on my eggs sandwiches, so a little mayo in scrambled eggs sounded great to me.

A nice subtle difference in flavor.  The fluffiest scrambled eggs I've ever made, and a great side benefit:  my sweetie didn't pour on additional salt to eat them!  Thank you!

I didn't know I could make scrambled eggs any better than I was. But these are way better than anything I have ever made. My husband was nervous because of the mayo but it was great. Couldn't taste it all. The thing I really noticed was that these were the fluffiest scrambled eggs I have ever had.

I got a little scared when I saw the eggs on the skillet... I used light mayonnaise and it seemed to separate from the eggs. But, I just kept stirring and let it cook and it immediately kind of melted into the eggs. The taste is superb! I did make them like I usually do, though. Added onion, green bell peppers, tomato, ham and cheese. I know it sounds more like an omelette, but that's how we like them! The change in texture and taste was really outstanding and you could not taste the mayo at all! (which is great, because my husband doesn't really care for mayo). This is my new scrambled eggs recipe!

It was good, but I added milk (or cream if you prefer) instead of water, and cheddar curds once it was cooked and let them melt for about a minute. The cheese gives the scrambled eggs colour and alittle more flavour.

I love these eggs, Whatshisface.  This is the first time I've made scrambled eggs and they were delicious.  The only thing is, I used a flavoured mayonaisse, so my eggs were discoloured.  I was also a bit ambitious and added bacon bits to the melted butter before adding the eggs.  Never mind, I'm making the eggs again tomorrow without the bacon.

These eggs were very moist, but didn't taste much different than regular-made eggs (splash of milk). Some herbs would be good, definitely the salt and pepper.

This is terrific! I always seemed to overcook them and they were always bland.  There are great, I didn't tell him it was mayo until the 2nd time.  They come out PERFECT every time.  Thank you so much, you've changed are breakfasts forever.

I thought that they turned out really well.  Never would have thought a little mayo would make such a difference.  Husband didnt like them though, and I think that was only b.c he KNEW the mayo was in it.  Next time I wont tell!

FOR SOME REASON I COULD NEVER MAKE A DECENT SCRAMBLED EGG...TILL NOW.  THIS WAS DELICIOUS AND YOU CAN'T TASTE THE MAYO AT ALL. FOR DIETARY REASONS I USED 1 WHOLE EGG AND 3 WHITES AND IT WAS PERFECT.

Perfect! I just made it an hour ago. Mayo adds yummy flavor and really smooth texture.  I had to look up all of Whats His Face's recipes and reviews. His family must eat very well.  I envy them.

These were so good I also looked up other recipes from Whats his Name. I am not a cook by any means, but after making these, my boyfriend called me a chef. They didn't fluff up like I am use to, but milk was what I always used. These were much tastier, and no salt or pepper needed!!

The eggs tasted great but I think I over stirred them because they got very crumbly toward the end. All-in-all great tasting though!

Moist and flavorful.  These yummy eggs were a big hit with my husband and kids.  This is the only way I'll make scrambled eggs from now on.
