HELPFUL TIPS NOT MENTIONED: I've read all the reviews, have made this myself for several years now, and have learned a few things. When using ranch packages, the sooner you mix, cook, and eat ...the more you "taste" the ranch. The longer it has to blend into the rest of the ingredients, the more it'll taste like a traditional chicken jerusalem. I make mine in the morning (mix ingredients on stovetop then onto the chicken) & cook when husband comes home (only needs 45 minutes)! With that said, it is wise to only use half a package of ranch. Cutting down the white wine to 1C makes it perfect for us. While quality of the wine makes a difference, I use dirt cheap and have wonderful results.  It's great to have a recipe you can put together so quickly and make all in one casserole dish! Perfect for those days you're very busy or not wanting to make a big fuss over dinner.  The chicken comes out so super tender! Great with stuffing and salad, or sometimes we serve with diced potatoes, and there's plenty of sauce to serve it over pasta and rice!  Another recipe that is very similar and quick (and not as powerful) is: Wine Sauce Chicken from this site!  I prefer that one and my husband prefers this one! So they're both keepers!

Wow!  This is an awesome sauce.  I've been looking to recreate a chicken shells recipe from our office caterer (she won't reveal any of her recipes) and this did it.  I made the sauce subbing italian dressing mix for the ranch mix and decreased the wine by 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup chicken broth.  I added a little of the sauce mix to 1 1/2 cup shredded chicken just until moist then also stirred in about 1/2 cup mozzerella.  I used this mixture to stuff pasta shells and poured the remaining sauce over everything.  I baked at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.  It was fabulous.  I served it for a birthday party and even the pickiest eater went back for seconds.
This is definately a favorite.

OH MY GOD!!!! This dish is 2 die for! The sauce was sooooo yummy! I can't stop thinking about how deliciously rich this sauce turned out!!!! I think it would be delicious served over shrimp or lobster. I changed a few things: 1 cup of white cooking wine, a little less cream cheese (low fat), half a pack of ranch soup mix, and 2 cloves of garlic blended into the sauce. I also used golden mushroom soup, which gave it a gorgeous golden hue. So good, and so easy- and i'm only 14! My parents loved it, and i will make this so many more times! Serve with good, crusty bread to soak up the sauce. Definitely the best thing you might ever make!

We absolutely loved this dish!  I added garlic to zing it up a little, and can't wait to experiment with other seasonings with this sauce.  

I am not sure why some reviewers had trouble with a strong wine taste.  I thought it was just perfect.  My only thought on the problem is that it may have been the wine they used.  You should never use "cooking wine" or el cheapo wine in a sauce.  If it isn't good enough to drink at the table, it isn't good enough for the sauce!

We thought this recipe was okay, but it was not a hit at our house.  The ranch, wine and soup all seemed to compete for the primary flavor and did not compliment well.

Hubby hated it, his coworkers couldn't even stay in the room when he reheated it because it smelled so bad, and I just thought it was "okay"

Served over Rotini pasta with salad and rolls. We really enjoyed this, even the two-year-old. (NOTE: the alcohol in the wine cooks out, making it safe for children). Thought the wine taste was a little overpowering; we used a cheap white wine, but think it would have been better with a really good white wine. Overall, it was fantastic!

I took a chance and made this for the first time for company- it was EXCELLENT, the company talked about it all night and asked for the recipe!  So easy and so delicious.  Only changes: substituted cr. of chicken and baked for 45 min.  Definate keeper.

I marinated the chicken breasts in the wine and ranch dressing mix for 4 hours before preparing the meal. It helped a bit, but the chicken itself had little taste. I think next time I will cut the chicken into strips, then marinate them. The sauce was excelent, none the less! It couln't have been much easier.

I love the wine sauce!  Served over brown rice which was a nice combo.  Would have worked on pasta too.  AS for the wine I used a cheap Pinot Grigio.

Did true to original recipe, served with fettucini, and my family really liked it. Tasted good as leftovers too. I thought it was strangely a bit salty since I didn't add any salt but might have been the wine bringing out flavors in the ranch dressing mix? Really liked it though and will make again!

Pretty good- not really anything special. Made it as called for- would use less wine next time. (sauce too thin & wine a bit over-powering) But it's good since it's so easy! (& low carb)

Very bland taste.  No one liked it.  turned out dry - cooking time may be way too long.  The sauce tasted a bit too sour creamy and didn't complement the chicken at all. This dish had no pizzazz.  Will not make again. Yuk!

This was very tasty! I used Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup for the lower fat and sodium content and only half a package of Ranch mix, again for the lower sodium. Yummy! I'll be making this dish again and again. Thanks for sharing, Angela.

Wonderful Recipe! I didn't have the cr. of mushroom so I used Cr. of Chicken.  Wonderful sauce - especially with the new red potatoes recipe as a side dish. Next time for even faster prep I will mix the sauce the night before and throw in the oven when I get home.

I made this for our family and took some over to my ultra picky father-in-law and it got rave reviews.  Everyone loved this one and it was really quite easy.  I did use only half of the cream cheese, substituted cream of chicken instead of the mushroom, and I had to use chicken breast with the bone in and we all still loved it.

This was really delicious!  I put it together in the afternoon, and baked it for the recommended hour and the chicken came out beautifully!  I added some fresh mushrooms that I sauteed in white wine, butter and garlic, but followed the other directions exactly.  So good!

Good recipe! Definitely need to cut the onion soup mix in half...I also halved the cream cheese. Very good, but not so figure friendly. Thanks for the share!

I was pleased and a bit surprised that this came out as tasty as it did.  Heeding the advice of other reviewers, I used only 3 tbsp of the ranch dressing mix, which was plenty considering how salty I think ranch dressing mix makes things.  I also cut back the white wine to 3/4 of a cup.  The blender made the sauce smooth and easy on me.  The chicken was fork tender, which was completely unexpected and a pleasant surprise.  This will be a weeknight keeper for sure, I served mine with penne pasta, add a green salad and some garlic bread you've got a nice meal for a Wednesday night.  One hint to error prone folks like myself, spray your baking dish with cooking spray prior to baking, or else you'll be like me scraping down my casserole dish with a spatula.

this sauce was so good, but quite salty.  Maybe use less of the package of Ranch Dressing?  There are so many good chicken recipes out there, but not many as simple and tasty as this.  Try it you will like it :)

This dish was ok...I enjoyed it more than my bf...next time I will add some fresh mushrooms after pouring the sauce over the chicken and possibly add some sun dried tomatoes...bf suggested adding cayenne pepper to the sauce...I used the low fat cream cheese and no fat ranch dressing mix...I also served this over the asparagus-zucchini rice on this web site using brown rice.

This dish was excellent.  It does not need to be cooked as long as is stated in the recipe.  40-45 minutes is plenty.

My wife loves this one.  Use a nice white wine you would enjoy drinking & check early to see if the chicken is done.  I've made this twice now & it only took about 40 mins in the oven.  Thanks Angela!

Delicious recipe and so easy to make.  Sauce was a little thin, but other than that, no complaints.  I put half of the sauce in the freezed to save for another night and cooked other 1/2 with 2 chicken breasts.  Yummy with rice.  Will make again and again.

A very good and easy recipe.  Next time I would cut down on the wine it made the sauce a bit strong for our liking.  I also used lowfat soup and lowfat cream cheese and it turned out very creamy.

Outstanding.  Alterations I made: 1 cup of white wine, added a little sour cream, 4-5 cloves of garlic, and added fresh sliced mushrooms.  Adding the mushrooms really made this recipe so much more enjoyable.  The sauce is absolutely amazing.  I, too, would like to try this with some shrimp, scallops, and lobster.

Taste like "Angel Chicken", another recipe on this site which I love! I think it needs a little milk or chicken broth because it's pretty thick and it has a really strong flavor. I will definitely make it again. Served over rice.

Good rich sauce and the wine adds a nice fragrant taste. I used chardonnay wine and added mushrooms to the sauce. This was delicious and easy to make. Thanks for this easy and wonderful recipe.

This dish didn't really do much for me.  It was okay, just a bit bland, and I guess I had high expectations from the other reviews.  Thanks anyway though!

Definitely a keeper recipe.  My husband, who says he clucks due to eating so much chicken, really liked this recipe, as did my two young kids!  I didn't have the dry ranch mix, so I made my own with dry ingredients I had on hand per a suggestion of another reviewer.  Wonderful recipe.

Yery easy and quick prep. My family liked this so much it quickly became a family favorite.  We have even used this recipe for large functions. I have found that if you double the chicken for a larger group, you don't necessarily need to double the other ingredients.

Wow...  it doesn't get any easier than this one.  10 minutes of prep included a glass of wine for me!  This is simple and incredibly tasty.  I served it over some egg noodles.  Per other suggestions, I added garlic.  My husband did complain that it was a bit salty.  I can see making this one once a month.

Excellent and easy recipe. Great for guests. I halved the Ranch dressing mix, as suggested, for 6 servings. Sprinkled chicken with paprika when serving for color. This is a BIG keeper! ... Update: Served it for guests Friday night who raved about it, and the tangy under-taste.

Yummy! I scaled the recipe for 4 thinly sliced boneless chicken breasts. I used 1/2 cup of white cooking wine, about 3/4 of the package of dressing mix, one can of cream of mushroom soup, and an 8 oz. package of cream cheese. It was very good.A little salty so I'm glad I didn't use the whole package of dressing mix. Served over rice. There was a lot of sauce left over, looking forward to the leftovers.

Perhaps I messed this up somehow but the only thing I did different was add cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I made this for Valentine's and we had to trash it.

This was a very easy and tasty recipe.  I used cream of chicken soup and 1 cup of Ravenswood chardonnay, and the flavor of the wine in the sauce was perfect.  I used only half the amount of chicken called for and used the extra sauce to put over rice.  We (2 of us) must not be big eaters, because I still had chicken and sauce left over to use over angel hair the next day; I cut up the chicken, reheated it in the sauce, and added some fresh thyme before adding to the pasta -- delicious!  Thanks Angela!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!  My fiance is a very good cook and he raved about this recipe.  I also made it for a pot luck gathering and used chicken tenders .  There was not a scrap left and I had many requests for the recipe, including a person who puts on several buffets.  I add garlic to the sauce and only put one half of the sauce on initially and check it halfway through and add more sauce

I love to cook and have made thousands of recipes but this has got to be "the best" I have ever made. Everyone loved it!! I only used 3/4 cup of wine and fresh garlic in place of the ranch dressing because that's all I had and it still tasted fabulous! Highly recommended!!!!

I made this using 1 cup of wine instead of 1 1/4 and it still tasted a little too strong. I had eight "taste testers", ages 18 to 42, rate this chicken and on a scale of 1-10 they gave it a 5. It was nothing special and as one taster said," it tastes like something a caterer would make in bulk". Will not be making this again.

My fiance really enjoyed this, althought I thought it was too strong. I used fat free cream cheese and it turned into big chunks I couldn't get rid of. Tasted too strongly of the wine. I doubt I will make this again. I may try it with low fat cream cheese, but NEVER make this one with fat free stuff! Yuck!

The wine in this recipe was a little strong for our taste.  I think it will be great scaled down a little.  My family loved it and it makes a great sauce to serve over rice or pasta!  It's a keeper.

This was a great recipe.  I cheated a little I used frozen breaded chicken breasts that I got from Market day and it still came out great.  It was a little salty for us though so I think next time I may only use a 1/2 package of the dry ranch dressing mix.  My 3 yr old son loved it.

It was just ok. The sauce was a bit too tangy for my liking. I chargrilled the chicken because I noted in other reviews that the chicken was bland and I cooked the sauce in a pan for about  20 minutes. Served over rice.

I made this tonight for my family.  It was very good but the sauce was a little to runny and I reduced the wine to 3/4 c. as many people suggested.  I think I might add a little cornstarch, to the blender mixture, the next time I make it.

I used cream of chicken (low fat/low sodium) instead of cream of mushroom and added garlic.  Otherwise, made exactly as called for.  Love it.  Husband who could care less about food loves it.!  I will be making this again, next time I will try with low fat cream cheese.  I served this over egg noodles.  THANK YOU!!

My husband and I both enjoyed this very much.  I took the suggestions from most of the reviewers (less cream cheese, half ranch packet, garlic, less wine, etc.).  Delicious!!! I will make again...

I loved this recipe..but then I love ranch  dressing. My husband liked the recipe, but he isn't as fond of ranch as I am. I will definitely make again, and will use less ranch dressing and will add garlic cloves as suggested by others. I may add a little more wine or a little less cream cheese as we did not taste the wine at all. Wonderful recipe. Thank you Angela!

This was pretty good.  I have had the recipe for a while but never tried it.  Other reviewers were right...next time a little less of the ranch mix and a little less wine (more for me to drink!) but I'd definitely do this again.

I thought the taste was good, but I would probably add a bit less wine next time (sauce was pretty thin).  Also, make this in the 9x13 pan, as recommended.  I used less chicken and opted for a MUCH smaller pan.  The sauce totally covered all of the chicken (which was fine), but it also bubbled over the edge of the pan the whole time!!!  Off to clean the oven now...but eating todays leftovers will be worth all the scrubbing I'll be doing.

I followed other peoples recommendations and reduced the cream cheese, ranch and wine & added garlic.  The sauce was excellent!  HOWEVER, next time I will serve the sauce over pasta with breaded chicken and broccoli.

This is one of my families favorites, especially my four year old. The only changes I have made is to add fress mushrooms, and will sometimes use chicken thighs for a slightly moister cut of meat. Great served over rice, and makes more than enough sauce!

Well, it certainly couldn't have been easier!  I followed other comments and used less ranch, but I think I didn't use enough, because I couldn't really taste it.  Added some garlic powder, too.  My husband liked it, and since he's very picky, I'll make it again.  The recipe would lend itself nicely to lots of tinkering.

This is a pretty good dish but I found the ranch dressing is a little overpowering. I dressed it up by using mushroom brie instead of cream cheese. I also added chopped garlic a little dill and omitted the ranch dressing.

I can't believe this! My five year old actually said he liked this! Usually I have to solicit his opinion but he offered it tonight. My husband really liked this one too. I didn't have any dressing packs so I got a recipe off here for ranch dressing mix. I had everything for that except parsley but I don't think it hurt it. I went a little light on the wine per the instructions of others. I also added a pinch of cayenne as I thought the sauce needed a little punching up. Thanks for submitting. Also, the cooking time was accurate for me.

I too agree that the flavors in the recipe compete with each other.  They are all very strong but don't seem to complement well.  My boyfriend was overwhelmed by the wine taste.  I won't make this again following the recipe but may experiment with it a bit.  The chicken was very, very tender though!  I did use fat free cream cheese & the consistency was great, yes runny but a nice gravy after stirring it.

Wonderful!  We had last minute company for dinner and this was a great way to whip up a quick and elegant meal. Served over white rice. Even the kids liked it, however, we used meatballs & pasta for them.

This recipe was great but needs a little punch.  I think the next time I will add some garlic cloves to the sauce.   I would also cut the sauce in half or put half in a pan on the stove for additional sauce.  Just a few adjustments and it was great.

I served this over linguini and the presentation looked wonderful.  I was a bit disappointed though, there was something in the sauce that was a bit overpowering.  But on the other hand, my husband loved it.  I did make some changes, I didn't have cream of mushroom, so I used fat free cream of chicken and I also used light cream cheese.  This is a quick dinner to make on a weeknight.

Though my rating is not fair, I'm giving it 3 stars as I'd never fix this according to the recipe as there's enough sodium to give a horse a heart attack.  So fixing it my way was no good (using low sodium soup and half the ranch dressing).  I won't make this my way again.

I didn't have an envelope of dry ranch dressing so I, too, used a combination of minced garlic and spices and it really came out wonderful.  The hubby and kids ate it up.  Please note though if you do not like cream cheese, you probably won't like this recipe.  The cheese taste is rather strong.

This was one of the easiest, tastiest recipes I have ever tried. I didn't have a packet of ranch dip mix, so I substituted spices such as garlic and dill - it was excellent, and incredibly easy. I put it over a plate of rice and my husband absoutely loved it.

Awesome recipe!  Extremely easy and VERY tasty.  I used cream of chicken soup (instead of cream of mushroom), used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and served it over rice.  Boy, was it good. Thanks!

It had a really good taste, but my sauce didn't thicken at all.  It was as thin as water!  My husband liked the taste, but not the consistency.

This recipe is AWESOME!!  I added some extra garlic salt and a little extra chopped garlic, as well as some mushrooms and just a little finely diced red onion to the sauce.  It was not bland at all, very juicy and flavorful.  It was also SO easy!!  I halved the recipe (since there are only two of us here to eat it), but wish I hadn't!  Truely awesome!

Me and my husband absolutely loved this dish.  It was so quick and easy to make too.  I made a few minor changes - I cut up the chicken in small bite-sized pieces; instead of the regular condensed cream of mushroom soup, I used the one with "roasted garlic"; and I added two cloves of garlic (which blended easily in the blender along with the other ingredients). [can you tell we love garlic yet?]  There is a lot of sauce leftover, which my husband loved, and I made homemade biscuits which tasted great dipped in the sauce afterwards.  I definately recommend this one for family get togethers - quick, easy and very tasty.

One of the best tasting and easiest chicken dishes ever!  I substituted lowfat soup and fat free cream cheese to reduce the fat grams and it was absolutely delicious.  Also sprinkle with paprika for a little needed color.

I enojoyed this meal, but I feel that less wine should be used in the sauce. This was a nice meal, but not something that I feel I would crave.

I didn't have white wine so substituted apple juice,water and some vinegar. It was great!! I will make it next time with wine to compare but this is definitely a keeper.Tender chicken and very good sauce. Thanks for sharing.

Really good...BUT needs a little "kick".  I suggest minced fresh garlic, 1 clove, and lots of mushrooms. And perhaps a little tarragon or rosemary on top.

I made this recipe and our son, who is 16, LOVES this recipe.  I serve it over noodles.  Sometimes I cube the chicken rather than cooking the chicken breasts whole.  I have also added fresh mushrooms to it.  YUM! YUM!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I am NOT a fan of "canned soup" recipes because they all seem to taste the same.  But, this one is different.  I think it is the wine that really gives it it's unique flavor.  I make it at least twice a month!

Excellent! This was a wonderful meal. I had friends over and they raved about it. IN fact, I'm sending everyone the recipe after typing this review.  One note: I made this dish with seven pieces of chicken and added just a smidge more white wine and a little bit of soy milk. It came out of the oven a bit soupy but the top had browned and the cooking of it made the kitchen smell wonderful!

I made two different chicken recipes for a family dinner and everyone raved over this one. My 15 year old son made the sauce. It's easy to make and easy to clean up. Next time, to lower the fat grams and calories, I'll use low fat cream cheese and low fat mushroom soup.

This recipe has terrific flavor and is quick and easy to make with ingredients that you probably have on hand... what more could you ask for!
