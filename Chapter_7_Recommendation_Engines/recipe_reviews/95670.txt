I have made this dish three times now. Thanksgiving, a work potluck, and Christmas Eve. It is a hit every time. Everyone asks for the recipe! It couldn't be any easier to make either. The only change I make is that I dice up the pears and apples to be bite size.

This is so easy it needs to be a secret just between us! Served it with roasted pork yesterday. But can't wait for tonight on shortcake and whipped cream... yum! Put this on gym shoe it would taste good.

I am the creator of this recipe, and I just wanted to mention that this would also taste great baked in a double crust pie with vanilla ice cream on top. I have also successfully halved the recipe, but left the full can of apple pie filling, and it tasted great....the recipe is very forgiving! Glad you all like it as much as we do, especially since I created it on accident!
