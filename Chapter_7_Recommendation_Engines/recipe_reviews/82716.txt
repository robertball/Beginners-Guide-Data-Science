Caul fat is the fatty membrane which surrounds internal organs of some animals, such as cows, sheep, and pigs, also known as the greater omentum. It is often used as a natural sausage casing and to encase fegatelli (Italian), faggots (English), or pâté (French). Caul fat is also known as Lace Fat.

This is a really good, traditional recipe of Cyprus. In addition to the listed ingredients, I also use cumin (1  tablespoon), which makes the taste even better.

Excellent recipe! We couldn't find caul fat so we stuffed the mixture into sausage casing (same thing maybe?), the resulting Sheftalia were larger than the local Greek restaurant but delicious nonetheless.

Our Greek community of friends regularly enjoy sheftalia. This photo was from the ones we cooked while camping at the beach. They are delicious when grilled over mesquite wood!

Great recipe! Easy and fast. Makes a great side dish or, along with french fries and a salad, a light meal.
