Delicious!! I made a batch to share with my Bunco group, and it was a big hit! I added some cranberries to give it a seasonal edge, and I plan to make it again for Thanksgiving.

This sangria is so delicious! I made a few modifications that gave It a tropical flair since I live In South Florida. Instead of  apples I added chopped strawberries. Instead of plain orange  juice, I added pineapple orange juice!

This went over really well with my book club - not a drop left.  The only thing I did differently was to limit the rum to 1 cup.  Otherwise, as written and muy delicioso!
