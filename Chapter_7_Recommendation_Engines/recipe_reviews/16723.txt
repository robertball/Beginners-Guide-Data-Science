Excellent!!! I've made this countless times. I use Classico brand basil pesto (small jar, green) and a jar of Classico brand Garlic Alfredo sauce. Instead of just the 2 cups of spinach, I use the entire bag of baby spinach leaves and add a couple of button mushrooms, sliced thinly. I sear my boneless, skinless chicken breasts first (sprinkled with creole seasoning/cayenne pepper for spiciness), and once they are cooked through I set them aside, wrapped in tin foil, until everything else is done, then chop them into bite sized pieces and toss them in the sauce. The chicken stays very moist and tender this way. I also like to throw some diced tomato (lightly salted) on top before serving. So delicious.

This is one of the best pasta dishes I've found on this site - definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!!!

SO nice, with SO many variations.  Hey you 3 star raters, it's you, not the recipe...  Use any Alfredo sauce, dry or in a jar. Use any Pesto you like. I use home made "Lite Alfredo" sauce and home made Pesto. Add any vegetable you want, onion and mushrooms are excellent. Use any pasta on hand.  Always use more garlic than called for and definitely more Spinach than suggested (5 oz tub works well).  Prawns and/or chicken work great. Add Parmesan or other cheese if you like.  Everyone loves this dish, in any form!! BTW, I agree w/ calizen on the seasonings (Jerk et al) then searing as well...I actually do that too. It up seasons the chicken to my liking.

Absolutely wonderful.....my hubby who does not like alfredo, loved it.  I used sun dried tomato pesto, a whole bag of baby spinach, added onion in when I sauted the chicken, added sun dried tomatoes when I added the baby spinach and used 1 cup of four cheese alfredo sauce.  Next time, I will cut back the sauce to 3/4 cup.  But, I will make again and again! Thank you for the recipe!

This was just ok, but I think with a little tweaking it would be good. First, olive oil on medium-high heat is enough to completely blacken minced garlic-- as I found out quickly enough. Second, one should absolutely add as much spinach as one can get one's hands on-- the amount called for in the recipe, once wilted, is next to none, especially for those like me who find the spinach the most appetizing part of the recipe to begin with. And, make sure your pesto is very fresh-- mine wasn't and therefore did not add the lovely pungent flavor I was expecting. Otherwise, preparation was relatively easy and straightforward, and the number of ingredients few enough that I will try it again, hopefully with a better end result. Thanks for posting!

I don't give 5 stars unless something is incredible, and this recipe is not only incredible, but it is very easy and looks beautiful!  This tastes like something you would get at an Italian restaurant.  I put in about twice as much spinach as the recipe called for because I like spinach, but besides that, I followed the recipe as written.  I will DEFINATELY be keeping this recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I only used a 1.6 oz.Knorr Alfredo sauce mix and a whole package of spinach.  It cut down on calories and the added spinach was great.  I also used 2 chicken breast for the recipe for 4 and it was plenty of chicken.

I used a an entire 10 oz bag of spinach and it was the perfect amount.  I made a packet of garlic alfredo and also made the pesto from a mix and the dish came out wonderfully.  Microwaves well the second day.

Wow - tastes great, presents great but easy to make. As others suggested I doubled the spinach but could have easily tripled it! I used a jar of sauce and made my own pesto from the 'Easy Pesto' recipe on this site. The hard part was waiting for the noodles to cook and not dipping into the sauce. Fantastic.

I altered this a bit by using already-cooked & shelled shrimp instead of chicken,
and it was fabulous!!  Even my picky 8-year old ate some and enjoyed it.  A 
direct quote from my husband:  "So are you going to make this every night now?"
I used Knorr Alfredo sauce mix, which wasn't as large a package as the recipe 
calls for but it made plenty of sauce.  I also used a full 16 ounces of pasta and 
it was still delicious.  I'm looking forward to trying this again with chicken!

Loved the variety this recipe offers to easily customize to your individual tastes.  For the family, I add extra garlic for a little more flavor and have since started marinating my chicken in Chakka's Mmmm Mmmm sauce prior to cooking it. Have added different veggies depending on what needs to be used in the fridge, along with a pinch of cayenne from time to time.  Peppers, mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus, etc., all have found a home in this dish at one time or another.  Delightfully easy!  Thank you MinerFamily for the submission!

I gave this 4 stars because I made some changes. First, I only used 2 small breasts because there's just the 2 of us.  I followed the advice of others and used Classico pesto (wonderful) and Classico light alfredo sauce. I diced up a small onion and a few mushrooms and cooked those with the chicken. I added about 6 garlic cloves and a package of fresh spinach.  My house smelled heavenly and the dish was fantastic. This is definitely a keeper in our house and it was so easy to make.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I really liked this dish!!!  I did modify after reading the reviews.

My modifications are, used three big chicken breasts, that I seasoned, just because that was what I had defrosted.  Added diced onion & tomato and a LOT more garlic.  Also I had frozen leaf spinach in the freezer so I used that instead of fresh, (I just let it thaw and added it to my garlic/onion saute.)  Finally I used jarred alfredo, as it is just easier.  

Next time I think I will add more pesto and probably add my garlic/onion/spinach  satue at the table because of picky children.  They did like the pasta with the alfredo/pesto sauce.

One last thing, if this is 4 servings, the four people eating this must have HUGE appetites.  My husband and I have already eaten this as left overs and there is still enough left over for two more adult servings.

Over all an easy dish to prepare and very yummy to eat.

This recipe looks deliscious, although I have never made it.  I am just wondering why it is listed under healthy recipes when it contains a day's worth of sodium and almost 20 grams of fat!

Great recipe. I followed it exactly but made my own cream cheese Alfredo. Next time I think I'll add an extra cup of spinach and some sliced button mushrooms. Other than that, it's a keeper.

As usual I follow new recipes EXACTLY as written before suggesting any modifications. It was VERY good and got thumbs up from my picky wife ... but ... the next time I fix it I will make the following additions: Full packet of Alfredo sauce 3 oz home made pesto 1 tbsp red pepper flakes 8 oz pkg of fresh mushrooms, sliced. Overall it is very tasty and has a great presentation.

Delicious.  Start boiling water for pasta first; that's the most time-consuming part, and going in the order this recipe calls for wasted a ton of time. Start water, cook chicken and then sautee garlic (add more) and spinach so you don't burn them. Also I'd recommend using pre-made alfredo sauce; wastes time/dishes to use a packet!  5 stars for flavor though!

This recipe was great! If you cut the chicken into "bite-size" pieces, it cooks a bit faster. This way, you can heat the alfredo/pesto on low, and also begin cooking the pasta almost as soon as you begin cooking the kitchen, and it cuts down on prep time. I used 5 cloves of garlic and it was great (I like to be able to taste the garlic, you may want to use less if you don't like it as strong). I used a 10oz bag of baby spinach, it was the perfect amount. This recipe would probably work great with broccoli as well.

Great recipe, with some modifications.  I omitted the alfredo sauce (don't like it) and upped the pesto to approx. 3 tablespoons.  Added 3 tbsp. of diced tomatoes.  I also seasoned the chicken beforhand with garlic salt, black pepper, italian seasoning, garlic powder, and a touch of cayenne pepper.  The result was so good that there were no leftovers!

Oh my this is good!  I added half an onion, extra garlic, some sliced mushrooms and the whole bag of spinach.  I also only used 2 chicken breasts (which was more than enough for 3 hungry adults with leftovers) and I used a jar of alfredo sauce.  We sprinkled fresh parmesan on top and it turned out awesome!  My brother-in-law thought it was Bertolli.  Ha!

LOVE this!  I made my own Alfredo from a basic recipe on this site and added lots of fresh garlic to that.  I also added mushrooms at the very end of cooking the spinach down.  My family LOVED this... I dont understand the 3 stars people... the pesto in the sauce is wonderful.  If you know how to cook then you know what spices to add to your liking.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I just want to add - use Dreamfields low carb pasta for a crazy delicious low carb dinner!!

I made this but did a variation using the sauce and chicken.  I added extra garlic (jar) and 1/4 cup of a good white wine.  I wanted the sauce thinner for my purpose.  I put a tablespoon of the sauce in the bottom of a small ramikin and then put a thin lasagne noodle on top.  Layered 1/4 the sauce, chicken, another noodle, 1/4 sauce and topped with chicken, shredded parmesan and diced tomato.  I made two ramikins - plenty of ingredients for this format.  I baked it at 375° until bubbly and the top was lightly browned about 20 minutes, depending on the size of the baking dishes.  WOW, it's a keeper at our house - absolutely restaurant quality.  Next time I will try the recipe as shown with the noodles.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

Delicious!  I used jarred Alfredo sauce, since I had it on hand, and frozen (thawed and drained) spinach.  This was fantastic, and left even my picky, green-stuff-hating 13 year old asking for more.  Definitely a make-often meal!

Just finished making this not long ago for my family and I. It was great and my family loved it. I tweaked it a bit though. Per other's advice I added more spinach and garlic and used a jar of Classico light Alfredo sauce instead of the packet. I also cut up an onion and used a little Zatarain's creole seasoning on the chicken just because I love it (and being a southerner we seem to put that or Tony Chachere's on everything). ;) I'll be saving this recipe.

It's a fabulous start, but it needed a little more flavor. Second time around, I added another clove of garlic, a little bit of salt, and sun-dried tomatoes. I also marinated the chicken in Italian dressing before using it in this recipe, and it added a great flavor. Much better!

YUM!  This was really good.  I changed the recipe slightly...cooked the garlic & 12 oz. spinach in a deep pan & added pre-made alfredo sauce & 7 oz. pesto.  I also added some sun dried tomatoes--you can find them without oil, so you get the flavor without the extra fat.  I sprinkled the chicken with blackening seasoning & blackened in a hot skillet--finished in the oven.  Topped with grated parmesan cheese.  This is a definite keeper.

Excellent!  I used the entire bag of spinach as suggesterd and also added mushroom. I used minced garlic and pre-cooked chicken strips to reduce time.  Boyfriend thought there was too much pasta and not enough "stuff" but otherwise excellent!

My husband actually tried this one...it took a little while the first time we made it to get everything done, but it really made a very pretty dish.  This could probably be done using a jar alfredo sauce to make this a little easier....Lots of flavor...great meal to impress your family without all the fuss!

A 5 carder, except for kids (hey it has spinach what do you expect?) This is an easy recipe and delicious variation on the standard chicken and pasta fare.

A bit bland. Not bad, just sort of heavy and one-dimensional. I used Knorr brand alfredo. The only things I changed were: I added about 1/4 cup sliced, sun-dried tomatoes for a little brightness. And I did not follow the instructions to saute the garlic over medium-high heat for one minute. I prefer that my garlic not be reduced to bitter, burnt little pebbles. (Put the EVOO in a cold pan along with garlic, and bring up to heat.) The amount of spinach used was laughable. Double it, at least.

I made this with my own alfredo sauce from Cooking Light which I just love. We grilled the chicken and then cut it up, wilted the spinach in a skillet then mixed it together on top of linguine with some fresh tomatoes from the farmers market. It was quick, easy and delicious. Thanks!

Always loved this recipe.  The only thing i do different is substitute the alfredo mix for cream of mushroom soup since i typically have that in the pantry & occasionally add some tomatoes at the end for color.

This recipe was definitely "a keeper". Everyone in my cooking co-op loved it.  I even used light margarine and skim milk to make the alfredo sauce and it was still delicious.  I read the other reviews and also added a whole bag of spinach.  We'll be making this again!

My boyfriend and I did not like the alfredo sauce on this.  Maybe it was the brand of alfredo mix I used, but it seemed rather bland even with my homemade pesto sauce.  Maybe just use a ready-made sauce instead?

A very rich pasta dish, but delectable.  The alfredo and noodles mix is usually near the jarred pasta sauces.

This is the best recipe I've ever tried! I may be Alfredo sauce from scratch, using another recipe on the site. I also added a bit of a roux to the sauce to thicken it up a little more. Serve with some garlic bread and a glass of Chardonnay. Fantastico!

Awesome!  Homemade pesto sauce made with fresh basil, Baby Spinach, almonds, fresh grated parmesan, freshly minced garlic, extra virgin olive oil, and fresh cilantro.  Chicken Florentine made with sauteed freshly minced garlic and Baby Bella mushrooms in extra virgin olive oil, chicken breasts covered in Old Bay seasoning, wilted fresh Baby Spinach, egg noodles, and topped wth Roma tomatoes.  I agree with other reviewers to use more spinach to get that good spinach taste as it wilts down very small.  I used 10 oz. of fresh, pre-washed baby spinach.  For me, using fresh ingredients as opposed to frozen or dried ingredients really brings out the essences of the oils and flavors of the ingredients.  I found using a little water in my pan helped the spinach wilt better than the last time I tried to wilt spinach.  I loved this recipe and I'm so glad I have some leftovers to take to work tonight.

This makes a great base recipe, you can really add whatever you like without going wrong (I added sauteed red bell peppers). My only qualm is the ratios, I would add more spinach and have less chicken.

A really basic, quick, and delicious meal!  I used the 15 oz. Classico LIGHT alfredo sauce mixed with 3 TB of Classico's basil pesto.  I also used A LOT more garlic (6-8 cloves) and spinach than called for.  Had chicken tenderloins from Costco, but I still cut it into smaller cubed pieces instead of keeping it in strips.  When preparing the chicken/spinach/garlic I added a douse of chicken broth when sauteeing so that I didn't have to use too much oil.  We didn't have romano cheese so used fresh parmesan instead and it was just as delicious.  Paired the meal with some Texas Toast.

Okay, I'm not sure I made this exact recipe, but I give the recipe poster props for a great idea! I grilled my chicken seperately with lots of seasonings (garlic powder, It. seasoning, etc). I made my Alfredo from the powder mix cause I was pressed for time.  I usually make one from scratch so I was apprehensive but it turned out great! I doctored it up a bit by stirring in a little of the pesto powdered sauce mix (couldn't find pesto sauce at my tiny grocery and didn't want to make a trip to WM) and also deglazing my grilling pan and adding the reduced juices. That made the sauce really good and distinctive. I don't think it has a artifical or "mix" taste at all! I had already cooked some frozen spinach in the micro(no fresh at my store!) so I just mixed it all together--pasta, sauce, spinach, chicken, and I also added a can of mushrooms and some sundried tomatoes. PERFECT! Thanks for the recipe idea Minerfamily! Sorry for all the changes but I had to make do with what I could get my hands on!

Very tasty and easy.  Everyone loved it despite the 'green stuff' in it, which is key to success!  I also use the Classico brand pesto and alfredo sauces for a quick and easy meal.  Good stuff!

I have to admit that I didn't follow the recipe to the tee, but for the simplicity and flavor, my changes could not have made a huge difference, and I only made them to make it a little more figure friendly.  Since "Alfredo Sauce Mix" can leave it open, I went with a cream sauce from another recipe which is 1 cup of chicken stock, 1 cup of 2% milk, sea salt and fresh black pepper to taste.  It's thickened with 3 Tbs of corn starch mixed with 3 Tbs of water.  I added all of that directly to the chicken/garlic mix and when it started to thicken added about 2/3 cup parmesan cheese.  When the pasta was almost done, I added the pesto, which I mixed up from a seasoning pack (small town.....limited options).  I used all the pesto, but it could be added according to personal taste,  then an entire bag of spinach.  I had meant to add sliced mushrooms as well, but forgot that I had them in the fridge....next time!  Again, this was SO easy and quick to make, especially when feeding 3 teenagers and their friends.  And the flavor for so few steps, Thank You!

Extremely tasty recipe. Combined Classico's Roasted Garlic and 4 Cheese Alfredo Sauces. Also used their Sun Dried Tomato Pesto cause that's what I already had on hand. Did use the full bag of fresh spinach leaves and garnished with the diced tomato. Also used whole wheat rotini for a healthier option but that was strictly a personal preference. The presentation and taste of this dish were definitely restaurant quality!!!

Wondering what to do with a giant bag of spinach from Costco, I came upon this fabulous recipe. 
One particular reviewer's note stuck with me as I embarked on this cooking project: "One should absolutely add as much spinach as one can get one's hands on."  
It’s so true -- I cannot imagine using the two measly cups called for in the recipe. When I saw how the spinach reduced to practically nothing, I easily added another 4 or 5 fists of spinach (I used half the huge bag!!)
When starting out, I sautéed one large onion and a healthy bunch of sliced mushrooms for several minutes, then added the garlic and sliced chicken. While stirring, I added about 1/3-cup of dry sherry and let it all cook for about 8 minutes. Added all of the spinach for several minutes more. Meanwhile, I heated the Alfredo sauce (with a few TBS. milk) in a small sauceppan with the pesto (use double-to-triple pesto), and then added the sauce and the pasta to the chicken mixture. 
Also added a bit of salt, pepper, marjoram and fresh parsley.  Because we weren't ready to sit down for dinner right away, I let it sit on the stove (warm) for about 20 minutes.  Turned out great, and I topped it off with cotija cheese, which is a Mexican cheese but has a lovely, pungent flavor that is perfect for this dish. 
Served with sliced lemon cucumbers and tomatoes from the garden.

This was terrific; however, I tweaked it somewhat.... left out the pesto (pine nut allergy), marinated chix strips in Italian salad dressing for 30 min., sauteed a chopped onion with the garlic cloves, added fresh sliced mushrooms to the spinach... FYI... it is a wonder of physics how spinach can cook down to ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Go ahead and buy a 10 oz. bag even if you wonder how in the world everything will fit in your skillet. Trust me... IT WILL COOK DOWN. I made the Alfredo sauce mix with 1% milk to lower the fat content. The leftovers don't get  funky overnight in the fridge... still tasty the next day. This is "company worthy".

This was the first time I'd ever cooked with pesto and was surprised at how good this tasted!  Even those in the family that don't care for spinach thought this was wonderful!

This was incredible!  My entire family LOVED it (except my 5 year old).  Thank you minerfamily for posting this!  I probably tripled the garlic and used 2 pounds of chicken, diced.  Aside from cooking the chicken in the garlic, I also added garlic salt and parsley mix and ground pepper to the chicken.  Once cooked, I added about 3 times the amount of spinach (next time I think I'll include mushrooms and onions as well).  I used McCormick garlic alfredo packet and added about 1/4 cup of basil pesto sauce (I buy it at Costco and it's FABULOUS).  I ended up cooking a full pound of rigatoni and added it and it was perfect!  For my 5 year old who just doesn't really like pasta (I know....strange) I took part of the sauteed chicken out before I added the spinach and sauces and put it on a plate for him.  While the chicken, spinach and sauce were simmering, I threw some broccoli in the microwave to steam for him.  His dinner was sauteed chicken and steamed broccoli!  I think next time, I might even use Broccoli instead of spinach.  This meal is definitely getting added to our rotation!  So many variations that you can always keep it interesting!

I added onions, cayenne pepper, and some seasoning salt. I also used frozen spinach and premade Classico asiago Alfredo sauce. Turned out fantastic! One of my kids (family of 6) said they liked it better than pizza!

I doubled the recipe. Doubled everything except I did 3 TBS garlic, 3 TBS olive oil, 3 TBS pesto, and I mixed in an entire 2 cup bag of Italian blend shredded cheese (which included Romano cheese) in place of the 1 TBS Romano cheese. Tried it out on the entire family using fettuccine noodles instead.  They loved it! :-) For me the pesto was a little too overpowering.

Made this last week for dinner and have had to make it 3 more times since then. My BF works out of town and asked me to make it for him and freeze it so he can enjoy it for dinner.  He texted me a pic of him eating it and said "flipping delicious!!" That made me so happy!!! Thank you for a wonderful pasta dish that the whole family loved!!!!

Made this for dinner last evening. I was not able to find the dry Alfredo mix so I uses a jar of the Classico Alfredo. I also sprinkled some red pepper flakes on the chicken while cooking. As others suggested, I used much more spinach then recipe called for and was very satisfied. This was as good, if not better, then what we order at our favorite Itallian restaurant. We thought it was delicious and will definitely be adding this to our dinner rotation. So simple!

This was pretty good.  After browning the chicken I put it aside and kept it warm while I sauteed mushrooms in the pan with the juices and garlic.  Added a blend of spinach and other "power greens" until wilted, and then a jar of alfredo, three tablespoons of pesto and a diced tomato.  Served with whole wheat penne and steamed asparagus. Thanks!

This is a simple recipe and it is basically chicken alfredo with a few additions.  I am not a big alfredo fan, but my husband is.  I made this exactly as written except I added mushrooms.  I am knocking off a star just because the flavor wasn't very deep, not because I don't care for alfredo that much (that's not the recipe's fault).  I added salt and pepper and squeeze of fresh lemon to my own plate to perk it up.

YUM!Thank you for this recipe! The ONLY things I changed was the amount of the spinach (cause I love it) and I used a jar of Alfredo sauce {cause I had it on hand). Very tasty and easy to make. It's a great week night dinner, plus I could easily see myself playing with it on the weekend and trying different variations.

Not too shabby. I substituted garlic powder for fresh cloves and small shells for penne simply because that was what I had. I would recommend getting the noodles started first. I didn't get them going until after the chicken and sauce were done and the chicken ended up drying out. Also, I couldn't find a 4.5 oz pkg of alfredo sauce mix so I used a 1.6 oz one and there was plenty of sauce. I would make this again.

I used canned spinach instead of fresh spinach and it turned out great! I also only used two chicken breasts instead of 4. My fiance loved it and almost ate the whole batch in one setting!

I've tried a lot of new recipes here lately and this is BY FAR the best new recipe I've found.  I wouldn't change a thing!  My hubby however doesn't care for spinach too much so I plan to try this with broccoli and/or mushrooms (though the spinach is DELICIOUS in this recipe).  LOVE this recipe!!  Thanks so much for posting!!

Made it with Classico's Sun-Dried Tomato Alfredo Sauce. A husband who dislikes spinach and alfredo had two helpings.  A child who dislikes chicken and tomatos had three helpings.  Definitely a winner.

Love, love, love this! Made it last night for my husband and I and we gobbled it right down. I made my own alfredo sauce and would like to use my own pesto next time as well but I didn't have the stuff to make it this time. Very very good! 

I would suggest, as others have as well, to use more spinach than what it calls for if you like spinach. But the pesto alfredo is what did it for me! MMM!

It was great and easy.  I added some baby portabella mushrooms and used fresh grated parmesean instead of Romano.  Still very good and will make it again.

This recipe was fine, but nothing too special.  If I made this again, I would definitly add some pine nuts...it lacked something, maybe crunch?  But I don't think it impressed me enough that I would make it again.

Loved it. I added mushrooms and next time I will prob add more spinach and even some squash. I think it would be great with some more veggies. I really loved it though. I used a jar of alfedo sauce instead of the packet and it worked out great

Loved this.  I added more chopped fresh tomatoes and spinach to the skillet.  I made my own alfredo sauce (a little more than a cup whipping cream, 1/4 cup butter, 1 1/2 cups freshly grated parmesan, 1 clove garlic, freshly chopped parsley - sautee the butter and garlic, add whipping cream and simmer for 5 minutes, add cheese and parsley).  It turned out fantastic.  I'll make this again.

This is an excellent recipe without much tweaking!  I did use a jar of Alfredo sauce instead of mix and more spinach.  One thing to be mindful of is that the recipe calls for 1 package (8 oz.) of penne pasta.  I usually buy it in a 16 oz box, so the first time I made this it was pretty dry; I added some evaporated milk and that helped.  My fault for not reading more closely!  Every time I've made it since, it comes out great.  Thanks for sharing this!!

We LOVED this. I've been looking for a good florentine recipe for a long time. The only thing I will change next time is to double the amount of spinach; by the time the spinach cooked down there wasn't much left--but other than that, a really delicious, easy-to-prepare recipe.

The only reason that I am giving this 4 stars is because of the tweaks that I made to it.  It was really good even though I used whole grain pasta, reduced fat alfredo and didn't put any extra cheese on it.  I think that if I were to make the full-fat recipe, it would deserve 6 stars.

Amazing! I made this for my boyfriend last night. He loved it as well as I did. After a hard day at work he was thrilled to come home to the table sat and dinner made. He had 2 servings. It will be something I make again. I did add almost the whole bag of spinach and put some under the pasta. I also topped with tomatoes. I made greek salads to go with it.

This was great! I followed another reveiwers idea by using a Jar of Classico brand Alfredo sause, and i Also used Classico brand pesto. I decided to slice up my chicken breast and season them with creole seasoning and cayenne pepper. I then baked the chicken for 20 mins. I did everything else the same. It was delicious!

This is an excellent recipe. I was doubtful about the spinach so I stemmed and quartered the spinach leaves and I'm glad I took the time to do that. I made no other changes. The whole family love it.

It is good for a healthy-ish version of Chicken Florentine.  I only gave it four stars because the directions are not written great.  Like a previous reviewer said, you should not saute garlic on med-high heat, it will burn.  Also, the pasta should be cooked at the same time in order to save time, and I didn't like how it called for dry mix but didn't give directions on how to prepare it.  I know you can follow the back but I found this recipe in the healthy cooking section and I don't know if the calories account for the ingredients in the dry package plus milk/butter.  Anyway, good base recipe.

This was a fun recipe to make, I used bowtie pasta and grated Parmesan because that was all I had. I also added the entire package of spinach because my husband and I absolutely love cooked spinach. I was a little disappointed with the flavor of the chicken, mine was a little bland so next time I'll definitely experiment with that. I also didn't like the Alfredo mix I used, I might turn to the jar next time. My husband really enjoyed this though so I'll definitely make it again and add some twists of my own. Thanks for this!

Rather bland.  But, I made it according to the instructions with the alfredo mix rather than using the jar sauce.

So, so good.  Double the Spinach, double amount of pestcut chicken amount in half. Cut chicken into bite-size pieces, don't just slice it.  Simply delicious, and versatile like many have said.

I made this and except for cheating and using a jar of alfredo sauce I followed the recipe to a "T".  It was perfect. DH & I love this. It is better than anything  you would get in a resturant. And it was so easy to make! The next time we have company over for dinner this is what we will be making!

Wonderful, Easy recipe! Next time will use at least double the spinach. I used 2 heaping TBSP of pesto (Classico brand). I also just used the standard 12oz or 13oz box of penne since there was quiet a bit of sauce. I also use whole grain pasta and it was wonderful it the dish. Makes wonderful leftover as well. Enjoy! :)

Very good.  Next time would drain the juice from the cooked chicken/spinach leaves mixture before adding pasta and sauce mixture.  Nevertheless, tasted very yummy.  Used Classico alfredo sauce and classico basil pesto.  As suggested by other reviewers, tripled the amount of fresh spinach.

This has quickly become a staple receipe in our house. I do replace the packaged sauce with Classico Alfredo and use 3 Tablespoons of pesto and double the spinach.  Last time I made it, I added fresh sliced mushrooms and instead of chicken, I made it with shrimp, which I had sprinkled with some Essence (Emeril Lagasse recipe, but without the salt). I added the shrimp after the spinach had wilted some, cooked it a couple minutes then added the sauce and pesto.  Shrimp works great. I serve it with a french rolls and salad.  It's on our regular menu from now on.

This was good. However, season the chicken with salt and pepper prior to cooking or it will be bland.

I thought this was really great!  I used Classico basil pesto.  Next time I will use half the pesto.  I picked up Knorr alfredo mix, which was only 1.6 oz.  Next time, I think I will try a jar of roasted garlic alfredo sauce.  I also used a whole 9 oz. bag of spinach, and I honestly can't see how 2 cups could be enough.  The amount I used shrunk down so much, it was perfect. Good recipe!

This was a good recipe. If I ever make it again I will us fettucine or linguine for the pasta part. I cubed the chicken instead of strips and added about a half cup of my own homemade pesto.

Very Easy. Used chicken thighs vs. breasts and seasoned with pepper. I reduced spinach by one cup and added 1 cup asparagus. Hate anything bottled or packaged, therefore made the Quick and Easy Alfredo sauce recipe, (change to 2 servings) and replaced with 3 equal parts of cream cheese, havarti and parmesan. Made the Pesto Sauce recipe separately and also changed to 2 servings.  A lot of time is saved on all 3 recipes if you just throw everything in the food processer vs. grating. Didn't bother to rinse in between uses. When cooking the chicken/spinach together, drain the excess liquid into your hot pasta water. Serve with Alfredo sauce on the side versus mixing.
Excellent recipe!

This dish was excellent!  I wanted mine a little more saucy then what the packet ended up making so I added some alfredo sauce from a jar!  Then I added more pesto sauce too!  It was great!  I wish I would've taken the suggestion of others to add more spinach, it reduces down so much! Oh, I also added a lot of garlic, one clove would not have been enough as the chicken was pretty bland.  I recommend seasoning it just a tad!

You lost me at "prepare Alfredo sauce according to package directions."

I'm going to try this without the packaged alfredo (perhaps, a real alfredo) Though, I have to admit, in all the time I lived in Florence, I never saw anything that resembled this.  As they say in Firenze, "beh, ci proviamo" (we'll see)

I gave this a 4 star as I found the chicken itself lacking in flavour. Will season them with something next time. Using a jarred sauce would be easier but not necessarily time saving as it cooks up while the pasta & chicken are cooking. Did not have a problem with the chicken drying out, it stayed very moist. Only had frozen spinach which I buy in nuggets, so just threw them right in the pan still frozen. Worked very well. The basil pesto excellant and the cheese grating perfect. Presentation is helped with the red of some diced tomato or red peppers on top. This is company food in a hurry - just that chicken needs a little help.

Heavenly!!! I had to adapt to what I had on hand and it was outstanding! I used two packages of Knorr pesto sauce mix, prepared, and then stirred in a jar of alfredo sauce, I think this gave it a stronger flavor. I used a full 16oz. of penne but only half the amount of chicken. This made it a lot cheaper and really stretched it, we didn't miss the extra chicken at all. Everyone loved it, even my hubby who is 'dieting' had to go back for seconds!! Thanks for a wonderful and delicious mix of flavors! We will have this again!

The recipe doesn't mention tomatoes but the picture shows chopped tomatoes topping this dish. Do it, Do it, Do it!  The tomatoes took this from a 7 to a 10 (10 being fabulous).
I love spinach and so I will double it next time. Also, I used large shrimp instead of chicken - great!

This recipe is super easy to make!  The additions suggested make this dish much better.  I added 1/4 cup diced red onion while sautéing the chicken, used a full 5 ounce container baby spinach, added 4 ounce can of chunky portabella mushrooms and used Ragu garlic alfredo sauce instead of the dry mix.  I also omitted the cheese.  Alfredo sauce is rich enough on its own.  This was a nice twist on our usual chicken alfredo pasta.  Definitely a keeper.  I’m going to add shredded carrot next time for additional color and nutrition.

Quick, excellent recipe.  I bought prepackaged Olivieri Lite Alfredo sauce and No name brand pesto sauce.  Added some fresh onions and mushrooms while the chicken was sauteeing.  Will definitely be adding to my list of things to make regularly on a work night!

OMG!  You have to use the right ingredients and tweak it to suit your taste but this is GOOD!

I cut 3 chicken breasts into thin strips, seasoned them with sweet onion &  garlic and let them rest in the fridge for about 2 hours. I love garlic so used 6-7 cloves. We like our pastas saucy so I used a whole jar of Bertolli Mushroom Alfredo, half a container of Buitoni Basil Pesto (Mmmmm!), a little over 1 cup of mini penne,an 8oz bag of fresh spinach (6-7 cups), added some mushrooms and scallions and BAM! Enough sauce to dip bread into!
 
This is an excellent recipe, you just have to adjust it to fit your family.  Next time I'll use low sodium sauces so it will be more healthy.  I can't wait to try this using shrimp!

Amazingly flavorful! All I did differently is add a little Cajun seasoning to the chicken while it sautéed, and add a thinly sliced red bell pepper. My husband said it tastes "better than restaurant" food, and the kids had seconds :)

This is a really good pasta dish. I used jarred sauces instead of the mixes called for, and added a healthy amount of Parmesan cheese to it. Next time I'm going to sub sauteed sliced red peppers for the spinach, which is not my fave veggie. This is like the frozen entrees but much more affordable & tastier! (Maybe not much healthier as I used jarred sauces but the frozen entrees aren't very healthy either). 

It could get oily w/the pesto & oil from sauteing the chicken so I drained off the oil after cooking the chicken. I also added a bit of half & half.

Really, really good, thanks to MINERFAMILY for an excellent recipe, a keeper!

This recipe was really good. I made some slight adjustments but it was a very easy recipe to follow. I read others reviews and used that to my advantage. I used a whole bag of spinach but I would have loved to had more, so next time I will definitely by 2 bags and use 1.5 bags. I also sliced fresh tomatoes, yum. I want to add bacon because I had Chicken Florentine on a pizza. This recipe is definitely a favorite.

Chopped up the chicken into bite size pieces, used a whole jar of the garlic Classico Alfredo, almost a whole 16oz container of baby spinach, and added cajun seasoning to the chicken. Next time it could use some onions, fresh squeezed lemon, and diced tomato or halved cherry tomatoes to add some bite.

so easy and quick to make. 
use whole bag of spinach and throw in a cup of mushrooms. and use the freshest pesto you can. makes a difference.  season the chicken with seasoned salt and pepper.  dredge it a little. comes out moist and not dry with flavor

This came out great!  Where I shopped (Kroger) I couldn't find 4.5 ounce alfredo mix, so had to go with 3 1.6 ounce packets and just triple the amounts in the instructions.  Other than that, it was excellent, especially with garlic toast :)

This was a very quick, easy, and yummy dish for a week-night meal!  For the most part, I followed the recipe as published.  Initially I thought to use a bottled Alfredo sauce, but I'm really glad that I used Knorr's dry Alfredo mix instead.  I used skim milk for the sauce which saved on calories.  I upped the amount of spinach, using nearly a bag and a half of baby spinach; but I used less chicken, about a pound of chicken tenders that I chopped prior to cooking.  I also seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before cooking.  This recipe is definitely going into my cooking rotation; it's a keeper.

I cannot begin to tell you how much I enjoyed this recipe.  My only advice: DO NOT be shy with the spinach.  It will cook down to much less than what you put on it.  Be brave and heap it on.  Beyond that ... Enjoy!

Just made this recipe and will definitely be making it again.  Instead of using a dry Alfredo Sauce mix I used Classico Alfredo Sauce in a jar.  I also doubled the amount of garlic since I am a big garlic fan.  The only other thing I did was that I did not saute my spinach because I don't like my spinach cooked, so I added it when I mixed everything together.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!  I seasoned the chicken with 1/2 TBLS cajun seasoning.  We added the pesto to a jar of garlic alfredo sauce and a whole bag of spinach.  No leftovers for my lunch.  Hubby said keep this one!

I loved the recipe though my husband and son thought that there was too much spinach in the dish. (they don't like spinach) I followed the recipe without adding anything extra but next time, I will add thinly shredded mozzarella cheese to it and mushrooms.

So good. My 14 year old made it so it's easy. Used Alfredo sauce from a jar to save time after getting home from work and school. Just started venturing out into cooking. We will be saving this one. Thx.

This was delicious!!! I used an alfredo sauce that is on allrecipes site which made it even more delicious. Didn't put the tomatoes on like in the picture but I think that would be good to. The pesto added an amazing flavor. Made exactly as written except for using the alfredo recipe that is on this site because my husband is gluten free so I don't used many jarred things. I used a gluten free pasta. Delicious!!!

5 stars because there's so much you can do with this recipe. We loved it. instead of pasta we used diced red potatoes (baked at 300 degrees for 30 minutes). I only used 1/2 the amount of alfredo sauce (plus omitted the butter) and 3 tablespoons of pesto sauce. Also added 3 handfuls of sliced mushrooms and doubled the amount of spinach. I would drain the liquid from the spinach pan before mixing with sauce next time. Really delicious and next time I'll try adding a whole bunch of additional veggies!

Tried this recipe, not bad. I think it comes out better as the variations mentioned by previous comments are made. I recommend not following the recipe exactly. The next time I will make my own Alfredo sauce. I don't like the taste of Alfredo from the jar.

LOVE this recipe. Made it a couple of times already. I use Classico Jar Pesto and Bertolli Alfredo sauce. SO good!! Also seasoning your chicken for this dish helps. I add the tomatoes as topping for my bowl instead of cooking with it. A must try recipe!

One of our go-to meals. Made this several times, both using homemade sauce of my own and jarred Alfredo sauce. I love to add in extra pesto as well as mushrooms and other vegetables I have on hand. Works well with any pasta type!

Loved this recipe.  I used a jar of alfredo sauce instead of the alfredo packet mix, and I used a little extra pesto sauce.  I added (jarred) roasted red bell peppers for a little extra color and taste, and a little bit of dried parsley ad dried italian seasoning.  We absolutely loved it, and I will definitely make it again.  Thanks very much for such a great, easy recipe.

Delicious meal; I doubled the spinach as others did, added shredded mozzarella on top once served with diced tomatoes. Makes it even better :)

This is one of those, "I don't want to cook tonight" fall back recipes and it also happens to be a family favorite!  I use Bertolli alfredo sauce out of the jar and whatever pasta is available.

First, let me say I liked this recipe. But there is one big problem: the order of preparation is wrong. If you follow the prep steps as offered, you will have three things going at the same time with no time to do any of them well.

The next time I make this (and I will) I will make some changes.
Ingredient changes - 4 cloves garlic, 3 cups fresh spinach, salt to taste.
Prep changes - change the order of steps as follows:
1. Cook pasta as described, drain thoroughly and place in serving bowl.
2. Prepare Alfredo Sauce. Set aside covered and kept warm.
3. Cook garlic, chicken, and spinach as directed. Add salt to taste while cooking.
4. Add chicken/spinach to pasta, then stir in Alfredo/pesto sauce.

Serve and enjoy!

This is a great recipe. The only modification I made was to substitute the suggested package of dry alfredo mix with a jar of Bertolli Alfredo sauce. It came out perfect!

Very easy to make and delicious! Added mushrooms and onion to the mix, but then again just about always add those two. Furthermore, used the Costco pesto and Classico Alfredo and more then 2 c. of spinach. Bon Apetite!

This is wonderful and very easy!!  As several reviewers recommended, I used a whole bag of fresh spinach and a jar of prepared Alfredo sauce.  (Also, I put a little bit of milk in the "empty" jar and shook it to get every last bit of Alfredo out of it.).   One other change I made was to increase the pasta significantly...to almost a whole pound!  There was plenty of sauce to cover this much  pasta.   Also, your first step should be to start the water boiling for the pasta.  By the time it's boiled and the pasta is cooked, the sauce/chicken is all ready.   Finally, contrary to the written directions, never rinse your pasta!  Just cook to aldente and drain.     Definitely a keeper!!

This dish was really good. However, I found that the sauce took a long time to thicken up. Next time, I'll start cooking the sauce right in the beginning instead of waiting until my pasta was cooking.

This was great and super easy for busy nights. Knorr's also makes a creamy pesto sauce, so I used this instead of both the pesto and the alfredo packet. We watch our caloric intake as well, so I used skim milk in the preparation (still very creamy, I assure you) and whole wheat pasta. So good.

This was a great recipe!!! I did make a few changes that really worked. As many other reviewers stated I added an entire bag of spinach as my BF and I love spinach and know how good it is. I also used a jarred Paul Newman Alfredo sauce - used about 85% of the jar. And used Whole Foods Basil Pesto. We also did not have romano cheese so we used fresh parm cheese and used 4 cloves of garlic. This was am absolute hit. My BF asked to put in the weekly rotation and I completely agree as it wasn't hard to make nor did it take very long!! Also I read some reviews that said to boil the water for the pasta first, I do agree with that and I do not agree with cooking the garlic for 2-3 min as that time may burn it. I cooked it for about 1 min and added the chicken

Yup! This is as amazing as all the reviews stated!  My husband and 11yo son gobbled it right up.  I used the jarred Classico alfredo sauce and store bought pesto.  I added sun dried tomatoes at the end.  This is a keeper for sure!

Good recipe!!  Just for personal taste choices, I added some onion and mushrooms, and topped it off with some roasted pine nuts.  Because of the gluten, I also used penne pasta made out of brown rice.  Thanks for sharing

Very simple, very good.  I used Classico Alfredo sauce instead of packaged.  I thought the amount of spinach was sufficient, however, when I make it the next time I will use half a box of penne (but keep the other measurements the same); IMO the whole box of penne made way too much for the amount of sauce and for four people.

This was awesome.  I did want to mention canned spinach works too.  I drained mine and only used about 1/4 cup.  I would never have thought to use alfredo with pesto.  So yummy!  Thanks for sharing.

Yummy!  Everyone liked it, including my 20-month old and 4 1/2 year old.  I probably more than doubled it with 2 6-oz. bags of spinach (had to wilt it in batches) and instead of alfredo sauce, I used a 1.3 oz. packet of Knorr's Parma Rosa.  I also did bowtie pasta.  I will definitely make again.

I loved it; my husband said "so-so".  I used frozen spinach which I think was a no-no.  Will try with fresh spinach next time....  Don't know what they topped it with in the picture (tomatoes? Red Pepper?) but it looks yummy!

I really loved this, my family gave it 4 stars (I may have added too much garlic per MY taste...). Super easy and totally delicious. Added way more spinach as I really like spinach and it seemed too little once it cooked down. I also used already prepared Alfredo, and mixed in my own pesto. Thanks for sharing!

I made it for my wife and I didn't hear from her since then. My MIL said it was good and this is was the last thing she said. 

Not really, it was good, I just have one comment on the amount of the Alfredo sauce, I think it should be more than what's in the ingredients, but this is something you can add later so it's not a big deal, other than that it was delicious.

Delicious dish, but I would prefer more flavor.  I will make this again with some additions.  Like some of the other posts, I would TRIPLE the amount of spinach.  I would also double the amount of pesto and add salt and pepper.  We'll see how it turns out next time!

I used this as a base recipe.  I substituted the Alfredo packet with jarred speghetti sauce.  I threw in fresh basil, rosemary, chopped tomatoes and sliced mushrooms.  I also dramatically increased the amount of spinach and didn't add pesto.  Since I'm trying watch my carbs, I completely eliminated the penne pasta.  I served it with Quinoa.  Not exactly the right pairing, but it's a good substitute.

Great recipe!  Next time I will use a jar of Alfredo sauce to make it easier. I also added frozen peas for a little sweetness.

Excellent, agree w/others, use way more spinach (entire bag) and seasoned chix. Also, added chopped tomatoes on top.

This was an absolutely phenomenal dinner! I did add a little pesto to the chicken/spinach before combining it with the pasta. I also added fresh chopped tomatoes on the side (which tasted wonderful with this!) This was one of the best recipes. My 10 year old picky eater even loved it!

Kids and family LOVED it, which is hard to get everyone to agree.
I doubled the pesto, watered down the alfredo just a bit to make it thinner, and put parmesan on top instead of romano... turned out great.

I wanted something easy for entertaining guests so I modified this recipe to make it a one pot meal. First I cooked the pasta in a stockpot, drained and placed the pasta in a serving dish. Next I used the same stock pot to cook up 2 slices of bacon, I removed the bacon and put it on paper towel to drain. I sauted about a 1/4 c of onions in about 2 T of the bacon grease. I then added the chicken ( 2 breasts) cooked until almost done and added the spinach ( 10oz bag) Finally I added a jar of garlic Alfredo sauce and a whole  jar (4oz) of pesto. I served up the pasta and poured the chicken/spinach mixture on top and garnished with bacon. I served up with some garlic bread and a salad. Everyone raved about it. This is definitely a keeper!!

This recipes was amazing. I took the other reviewer's suggestions and added more spinach. I also added some mushroms and onion. These were good suggestions. This recipe is pretty much foolproof and delicious! Thank you.

I'm so floored by the reviews.  This was very bland even though I seasoned the whole time cooking.  I guess I just need bigger flavors.

This was really good.  I used homemade alfredo sauce and probably about 1/4-1/3 c. of pesto rather than the 2 T.  I also used leftover cooked chicken (Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabobs from this site) and it was really good in this.  I added diced tomatoes and was going to add mushrooms but used them up on pizza last night.  We really enjoyed this, even though we changed a few things, it was basically the same creamy pesto pasta - a big hit with the hubs and the kids. :)

Good stuff!! I added some sun dried tomato's,entire bag of baby spinach and I dont know what this package of 4.5 oz dry Alfredo mix is. All the packets were 1.5 oz sized. So I made the one pack and it turned out fine. Definitely a keeper, easy to make.

I have tried several recipes on here and this was defintely one of the best.  Use whole wheat pasta, used greek yogurt in place of the butter in the alfredo sauce and, a cup in addition to the cup of milk.  Added lots of chopped garlic in both the  sauce and spinach mixture and lots of red pepper flakes for spice.  Added some fresh grated parm and chopped tomoatoes at the end.  Very yummy!!

Made this last night and instead of the package alfredo sauce, I made some homemade with wheat flour and 2% milk.  It was pretty tastey.  I would ease up on the pesto just a little bit.

I just made this recipe this evening and it is a recipe that I will use again.  It is easy, tasty and flexible.  I used some of the suggestions from other members and doubled the spinach and garlic.  I used a canned alfredo.  I also added a few finely chopped sundried tomatos and, since I had some on hand, some sliced grape tomatos.  This made a lovely presentation with the red and green and the white alfredo (I added the pesto to the spinach mixture).  Very Italian!  With some sprinkled grated parmesian on top, it was really good!  If you want it to be more diet, just skip the alfredo!

This was pretty delicious and simple.  The only dry alfredo sauce I could find was creamy garlic so I ended up not adding in pesto because it already hada pesto type flavor to it.  I also couldn't find romano cheese alone so I used an italian blend which consisted of romano, mozzarella, and parm.  It was very good.  I also wish I had used more spinach because it shrinks so much.

I thought this was pretty good and my family liked it.  The only thing was....we like our chicken florentine with a little more alfredo flavor, and with a thicker sauce.  I used a fresh pesto and homemade noodles and it was pretty good just not what we expected.

LOVE IT! I have given this recipe to so many people to try. I always tweek it a bit. I use alfredo sauce from the car and frozen spinach which I drain and press dry. I also add red and yellow bell peppers and it reminds me of the chicken scampi at Olive Garden. Even my picky kids love it. Did I mention it takes no time to make?!

Nice recipe!  Easy to prepare, good flavor.  Just be careful not to burn the garlic. Also, I used a package of frozen spinach that I had thawed & drained.  it's an option that works great.  Thanks for the recipe.

Love this recipe!  I have also made it with tomato sauce instead of the alfredo.

This was scrumptious.  I used a cup of Alfredo sauce and much less chicken than the recipe called for but a whole lot more fresh spinach (maybe 10 ounces or so).  Wonderful.

DH and I have been trying to get more spinach in our diets (heart healthy, don'tchaknow) so I've been searching for anything using spinach.  Since the sodium level was pretty high, I put this together using the low cal Alfredo Sauce recipe found here and we really liked it.  The pesto simply ramped up the recipe to outstanding.  Oh, be sure an cover the chicken while you're cooking it.  Thanks for the recipe MINERFAMILY!

This recipe is Amazing!!!!! I made it tonight while my groomer was here grooming my dogs.  I followed the recipe to the tee.  The ONLY thing I added was some diced tomatoes for color and flavor.  This is one of the BEST dishes I have found on this site.  Serve with french bread for dipping and a nice glass of red wine.  FABULOUS! Thank you Miner Family for a great recipe!

Delicious recipe! I made some changes to it, by adding more spinich then called for, next time I think I will the whole bag its delicious! And I added sun dried tomatoes, it added great flavor to an already good meal. Next time I think I will add some more pesto, the amount just didn't seem to be quite enough! Overall VERY good and I highly recommend it!

I made some changes to this and it was amazing!  I cooked the chicken by itself in olive oil, after seasoning with garlic powder, sea salt, and italian seasoning.  Then I used a whole bag of spinach, chopped finely.  I used two jars of Classico alfredo, roasted garlic and four cheese.  I also used 3 TBS of pesto.  I mixed it all together in a bowl and threw it in a baking dish to serve at church.  I will definitely keep this recipe to make again!

I agree with a few of the earlier reviewers, it was just ok. It does seem a bit bland and needs something extra to kick it up a notch.  I would recommend seasoning your chicken breasts with salt and pepper before cooking. The chicken lacked any flavor.  Next time to save time & to create less pots to clean, I’m just going to use jarred alfredo sauce and maybe add in a few extras like sun-dried tomatoes or artichokes.

My husband made this last night and it was amazing.  We followed the recipe exact except we only used half the amount of pasta and 3 chicken breasts which fed 2 adults and 2 toddlers with a bit of leftovers.  If using the whole bag doubling the sauce would be a must.   I would also use more spinanch as it virtually disappeared once cooked.  May try adding another tsp. of pesto as well.  Would also cut chicken into cubes for ease of eating and would season chicken breast with salt, pepper and a bit of garlic salt prior to cooking.  All in all...a fabulous recipe!!!

So good! I added an extra tablespoon of pesto, as well as 3/4 cup of sun-dried tomatoes. I also used angel hair pasta and it was the perfect combination.

I have made this recipe numerous times and each time their is nothing left.  My family really likes this.  The only thing I do different is use jarred alfredo sauce and I use more parmesean/romano cheese.  I also use more spinach.  Very quick and easy.

I give this recipe an absolute 5 stars.  I LOVED IT! Who would have thought that pesto combined with alfredo makes an amazing sauce? I thought I was eating at an Italian restaurant.  I didn't have fresh spinach so i used frozen which worked perfectly fine.  I also did not have romano cheese, instead I used parmesan.  Thanks a bunch for this recipe.

Super easy, tasty dish. I used whole wheat pasta, and cooked the spinach separately, as my teenager won't touch spinach. Whoever wanted, could just mix the spinach in. Next time I'll try adding some other vegetables as suggested by other reviewers.

If I could give more than five stars, I would! We loved this recipe! So easy and absolutely delicious. I used a 16 oz jar of prepared alfredo sauce, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. So creamy and delicious, and I loved the extra flavor the pesto added to a plain alfredo sauce. Next time, I will definitely use more spinach as others have suggested. This is a great recipe when you don't have much time. Throw together a tossed salad, heat some italian bread, and you have a restaurant quality meal in no time! Yummy!

Wow.. 2 of my favorite things.  I never thought to put them together.  I omitted the spinach because I didn't have any at the time and I used jar alfredo sauce (my favorite kind).  It was fantastic! We had a couple of friends over and they inhaled it too!  Defintely a keeper.

I used a box of frozen spinach- sautéed with mushrooms- and it was great.  I'm sure fresh would have been better, but the frozen spinach was still really good.  Also, I used salmon instead of chicken.

Very good and very rich!  I followed the recipe except for the alfredo. All I had was jarred sauce and to save a trip to the store that is what I used. I also added extra spinach. I would love to try this with a home-made alfredo sauce.

I don't know why I waited so long to make this. So simple, but with a wonderful range of flavors. I took inspiration from the suggestions made from natalieshd and sprinkled the chicken with Creole seasoning and let sit for a few hours in the fridge. Using 5 cloves of garlic, I then seared the chicken breasts whole and wrapped in foil to settle. I used 1 jar of Kraft alfredo and 4 heaping spoonfuls of Classico basil pesto. A bag and a half of spinach and 3/4 lb of penne rounded out the dish. The whole operation took less than an hour and even my wife had seconds!

Seems like every dish I review I give 5 stars!  Maybe I'm just an awesome cook! lol.  Seriously this dish was very good.  Along with other reviewers, I used a whole jar of sun-dried tomato alfredo, and like 4 tbs of jarred pesto.  I didnt even read the recipe again after I saw it once.  Just made it by "ear".  I did however (that nobody else had done)  marinate the chicken all day in a little pesto, evoo, garlic, shake of red pepper flakes and basil flavored evoo.  I think it prevented the chicken from getting dry.  I also stirred in some mozz cheese and parm when I added the sauce to the chicken and spinach.  I did use 1.5 bags of baby spinach and I could have added more.  Finished it w/ mozz at serving time.  Neighbors happened to be here and had some, they loved it!  5 kids ate too, all cleaned their plates.  Nice to sneak in plenty of fresh veg when youre eating a cream sauce.  Served it with salad and Asiago cheese bread from the bakery.  YUM YUM!  Go ahead, make this pasta dish!  It's great!

I wasn't sure how this would turn out, but it ended up being really good! I used a jar of alfredo sauce, and used some homemade pesto I had frozen. I also seasoned the chicken with lots of garlic powder and italian seasoning, Then cut it into bite size pieces. I used a whole bag of baby spinach... delicious!

An excellent and very simple-to-make recipe. I had to change things a bit to use the ingredients on hand (a jar of alfredo sauce and a dry pesto mix; vegetarian chicken pieces; tons more garlic!) but the basic idea was the same. I would never have thought to combine alfredo and pesto, but it works very well. A delicious taste combination. I'll be making this again (and again and again)

Excellent! I used roasted garlic alfredo sauce from a jar and about 4 cups of spinach (two cups really isn't a lot after it cooks).

This came together very quickly.  I used fresh spinach, which cooked up to be very sweet and delicious. Everyone liked it, and it was extremely easy to make.  I will make this again and be sure to add even more spinach.  I added crushed red pepper to my plate which really complimented the dish.

This was really good.  The only complaint I have is that the chicken was bland and dry.  Next time I will try to season it more. I will also use Alfredo in the jar as it saves time. I will definitely make this again but will tweak it. If anyone knows the secret to cooking the chicken so is stays moist, I would sure appreciate it!!

FANTASTIC!  The whole family loved this one, from toddler to teenager to husband; even the dog was begging.  I cut the chicken into bite size pieces before cooking, and seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic.  Used 1 pckg Knorr Alfredo and 1 pckg Knorr Creamy Pesto sauce made with skim milk, and added frozen fresh basil.  Used 16 oz. Barilla Plus penne pasta, and 9 oz. bag spinach.  Yields 6-8 servings.  Served chopped red bell pepper, romano, parmesan, pesto and pine nuts on the side as toppings.  Family asked me to use more garlic next time.  This can be changed so many ways!!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Great. Super easy and quick. It's the kind of recipe you can easily eyeball and it will taste great every time. I used 4 cups of spinach (I'm pregnant and trying to increase my folic acid intake) and for convenience sake I used a prepared jar of Alfredo sauce. Thank you for the great recipe.

This was a fabulous, easy-to-make chicken dish. I'm always looking for something new in the way of chicken recipes because my family only eats fish and fowl. This one is a keeper. Just one note, next time I will add the whole package of fresh spinach. Two cups cooks down to so little.

I don't rave about recipes very often, but I have to rave for this, it was simple to make and my family actually liked it. New recipe night can sometimes be frustrating and costly fortunately this one was a success.

Not a big hit in my house. Too much chicken (and I used only two chicken breasts and doubled spinach). Not much flavor. Won't make again.

My husband liked it a lot and he is a very picky eater. I found it to  be very colourless and bland and wasn´t too keen on it but I wasn´t hungry so maybe that was it.I will make it again but I´m going to add red peppers, tomatoes and mushrooms to give a bit of life!!

We liked the recipe.  I used radiatore pasta and chicken fingers cut into bite sized pieces.  I had a colander FULL of spinach and I still would do more.  I also seasoned my chicken with seasoned salt.

When I made this, I forgot to add the Romano cheese, but it was still good. If you buy the bagged spinach, you have plenty leftover to make a salad.

This recipe tasted really great for how easy it is. My three old even had seconds. Instead of using the dry alfredo mix, I used Classico Sun-dried tomato alfredo sauce in a jar. I think next time I will saute some mushrooms with the chicken. We had it with a salad and french bread.

This is a great go-to recipe. People often say it tastes like it came from a restaurant! I’ve made it so many times that I’ve simplified it quite a bit. I make regular Alfredo sauce with half and half, butter and Parmesan. If I’m feeling fancy, I roast cherry tomatoes and pesto in the oven; otherwise I open a can of petit diced tomatoes and spoon a big spoonful of pesto into the Alfredo sauce. I also add a package of frozen (thawed) spinach rather than fresh just because it’s easier to keep on hand and use in a pinch. I use a rotisserie chicken for the meat and mini penne for the pasta. It’s delicious! Looks fancy but requires little effort or prep!

Added onion, removed chicken from pan and deglazed with a little broth, then added back the chicken and continued.  Made  Hollandaise from scratch instead of Alfredo and added the pesto.  Topped with pine nuts as well as cheese.  Healthy?  No.  Delish?  Absolutely!

My family loved it. Something different. And I got to use the spinach I had in my fridge. My 9 yo son said it tastes like bologna. I didn't think so until he said it. It could have been the jar at redo sauce I bought and the cast iron skillet making strange taste combinationsLOL

Great easy recipe amenable to all kinds of tweaks to fit your preference. If I don't use a homemade alfredo (which is pretty simple to do) I generally sear the chicken with half olive oil and half unsalted butter to add a buttery taste. I don't add the garlic until the chicken starts to sear because I find in order to sear the chicken, the oil is too hot and will burn your garlic. If I make my own alfredo, I'll sauté the garlic in the butter in the roux for it. I definitely use a lot more spinach! After that, I'll add whatever I'm in the mood for and/or have in the house! Fresh bacon bits, mushrooms, onions... make it yours and enjoy!

Really tasty. I would have ventured out a bit more, but you need to be courteous to the person submitting the recipe.
I did use jarred Alfredo and pesto. Cooked my chicken in advance/ covered with foil and added towards the end with the pasta.
The recipes is limitless with adding all sorts of fresh veggies.
Thank you for sharing. This is a good foundation.

I'm giving this a five for a few reasons.  1:  its really good.  2: its simple to make.  3:  my family loved it!   4:  you can tweet it a little to make it more healthy if you like with more spinach and less alfredo.

SoOo good ! I read all the reviews that said not to change the recipe so I didn't want to stray too far.... but I always tweak everything... I marinated the chicken in balsamic vinegar and a touch of  course pink sea salt. ( I read a lot of people say the recipe needed salt) i cut up an  heirloom tomato and marinated it as well. I added chopped yellow onion to the garlic sauté along with a little minced ginger. I added extra spinach, pesto ,and sun dried tomatoes,  per other reviewers. I used organic wheat penni pasta( I love how firm the noodles stay) and a jar of vegan Alfredo sauce. ( I know that doesn't make since but the taste is amazing ) this is an incredible jumping off  recipe. My household couldn't get enough ! We will make this one again for sure !

My wife and I and our two teenage boys liked it enough that I will probably make it again. My ten year old daughter on the other hand cringed as she was putting the first bite into her mouth. She hated it... but then again, she hates pretty much everything. I followed the recipe process but amended the ingredients. When cooking the chicken I used garlic olive oil in the pan and added salt and pepper. Like several hundred of other reviews I used more spinach.(6oz.bag)I used a mass produced alfredo sauce that I doctored in a sauce pan with milk and a couple of extra spices only because store bought is so bland compared to my homemade. I substituted Romano cheese for Great Value's Italian Style Cheese only because The Wife insists on shopping at Walmart (I affectionately call it the abyss of hell)and that is what she went with. I guess straight Romano is too high brow for that place as they didn't have any. As I am color blind I didn't add anything for color, those reviews telling you to add tomato for color need to stop discriminating against people like me! Add tomato if you are a tomato lover!! I give it a 2 star for good concept, after my alterations a 3 star and a 5 star because I finally found a recipe that compelled me to write my first review. Blessings

I make this dish about once a week. Great meal for busy nights.   I use Alfredo sauce from a jar and extra chicken and spinach.  My kids love it!

Amazing!!!!  This dish tasted great.  I used Alfredo sauce instead of the Alfredo dry mix because I messed it up.  Luckily I had a jar of the sauce in the cabinet.  My husband loved it and I will be making it again.  I will try the dry sauce again but I will make sure I have the sauce as back up.  I'm new to cooking and this was really simple and quick.

We found this recipe when we were looking for  a healthy meal. First attempt I hand diced 2 HEADS of garlic... oops. Then I found out what a clove is. Oh well. We make it with an 8 or 10oz package of spinach leaves, 10oz being a 3 cup serving. I have even doubled it without it being too much. I am not at all familiar with the dry alfredo sauce method, i usually use 2x 15oz jars of alfredo mix, but currently cooking a batch with just one jar of sauce. This is ABSOLUTELY our most FAVORITE chicken dish to cook, and have it frequently. Even our 3 year old daughter loves it!! Doubling the ingrediants makes for EXCELLANT leftovers also.

I use homemade Alfredo with asiago cheese instead and this is delicious!  I also add almost an entire case of spinach since it cooks down a lot and marinate the chicken in a pesto and garlic mixture so the chicken has more flavour.

I followed a few comments and cut chicken down to two. I also added mushrooms and onions. I haven't used pesto until now and I wish I had cooked with it sooner. So good.

Four stars, because on a week night it's quick and delicious. One star missing because as others have pointed out, not near enough spinach.

I did season and seared the chicken with a gumbo seasoning, salt, pepper, and poultry season.  When the chicken was almost cooked, I added in 3 cloves of garlic so it wouldnt burn.  I thought a full bag of spinach and two nice sized chicken breast was plenty for two people as well.   The recipe was quick and enjoyed in no time. YUM!

A favourite staple!!! I have made this countless of times and change it up in small ways depending on what I have available. I took a lot of pointers from user calizen's review. I use a jar of alfredo sauce instead of the package dry mix. I love adding mushrooms and use the entire bag of spinach. I'll pound a couple chicken breasts flat, season depending on my mood, cook in a frying pan with oil on high heat for one minute, flip over the chicken breasts, turn the heat to low and cover the pan for ten minutes. I'll chop the chicken and stir it into the pasta once it's done. I've eaten it various ways, including with parmesan, halved cherry tomatoes, red pepper flakes, or baked it in mozzarella. I always add much more garlic than the recipe calls for. An easy recipe to make and always satisfies my house guests.

Soooo good! I used Classico light Alfredo sauce in a jar, added mushrooms to the chicken and spinach - could have easily used 2 bags of spinach, but had only one. I would definitely make this again!

I will use twice as much spinach and a lid that allows some moisture to escape while cooking chicken next time. I used Kroger Private Selection pesto and ready-to-pour Classico alfredo sauce (others had soybean oil).

I ONLY rated this a 4 because I changed the recipe a little or it would have received a 5 star!!  The things I did different were that I sautéed a can of mushrooms with the spinach and instead of package alfredo sauce, I used Prego's alfredo sauce in the jar.  My kids and husband LOVED it.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Super delicious! Will definitely be making it again! I made a few changes though. I added cherry tomatoes and mushrooms, although I should have put more. I also used 2 jars of Prego Basil Pesto Alfredo sauce instead of the dry mix and pesto.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend the other night and he loved it!! He told me at least three times "you did good". He is kind of a picky eater so I was stoked to hear that he loved it.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe instructions was add about three times more pesto than called for. I paired it with a small caesar salad and ciabatta toast. It was one of the best recipes I've made!!! Highly recommend!!

Amazing!! I can't stop eating this! It's so good! I did follow what other people said about using more spinach and I'm happy I did because there wouldn't have been enough with the amount it calls for. I will be making this again and again sooo food!

I loved the recipe and it was easy to make. The one thing I would have changed is the sauce. Unless I over-cooked the Alfredo sauce, there wasn't enough sauce for the pasta. I added oil and cheese and a sauce but it was still kind of dry.

We liked this and the guys raved but I thought the sauce had an off taste and I think it was due to the powdered Alfredo sauce. We normally make Alfredo from scratch- that may be the issue for me. That being said it was easy and tasty. I subbed zoodles for  my penne. Guys had the noodle. :)

This is one of my family's favorites! So delicious. I use a jar of Classico Alfredo and add a dash or so of cayenne pepper and nutmeg. Top it with toasted walnuts, and you have a much requested, heavenly pasta dish.

This was a hit! I made homemade alfredo sauce with heavy cream, butter and parmesan cheese and we grilled the chicken - absolutely delicious! I also put it into a baking dish after I mixed it all together and topped it with parmesan cheese - then broiled it just for a few minutes. Highly recommend!

As is, I rate this a 3. With quality homemade alfredo sauce, I rate this 5 stars. "Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce" from this site is the sauce recipe I use and it makes THIS recipe phenomenal. Dry alfredo mix, just doesn't cut it for me. Quality sauce takes this recipe to it's fullest potential! Don't skimp and get the packet stuff! This recipe is TO DIE FOR with a quality sauce!

Amazing! So quick and easy, but tasted like I spent hours on it. I did season the chicken with salt, garlic powder, and basil. Also, I used 16 oz of noodles, instead of 8, and there was still plenty of sauce.

Added a little crushed red pepper to the chicken while cooking. Gave it a lil kick! Super good. Trying to remove preservatives from my families diet, so I made my own pesto and alfredo sauce. Family loved it, so creamy.

It's recipes like this that makes me love cooking! So easy and delicious and the ingredients aren't pricey to buy at all. 
As others, I used a whole bag of spinach, and I used jarred Alfredo and green pesto sauce. I kept it basic and it was great enough as that.

I prepared using a jar of alfredo sauce already prepared.  I mixed 2-3 tablespoons of pesto sauce and added diced tomatoes for color.  It was very good.

Lovely. I avoid processed food, so I made my own Alfredo sauce and my own pasta.  I marinated my chicken for 1 hour in a bit of olive oil, bit of lemon juice, fresh garlic, and pepper. Served on whole wheat spaghetti.  As is, I'm sure is lovely too and better for when one doesn't have time to spare.

OMG this was so good!  I basically followed the recipe other than adding onion because onion belongs in everything IMO.  I probably used more pesto than called for but the flavors!!!!!wow!  I also used frozen spinach because that's what I had on hand so I let it simmer to reduce all the extra liquid.  
This is so good you have to try it!

This was so amazing. I first sauteed mushrooms, onions and garlic. Then added sun dried tomatoes...dash of salt pepper and red wine vinegar. I used Bertoli garlic alfredo sauce...some heavy cream added the pesto and grated parmesan cheese. Oh my...deeeelish.

This is my first time reviewing a recipe! I followed the instructions almost exactly, it was great but a tiny bit bland. I will tweak the recipe and try again!
Here is what I did.. I used garden rotini instead of penne, and I used Prego three artisan cheese alfredo sauce which I heated before stirring in the pesto.  I used classico traditional basil pesto and about 3 cups of torn fresh spinach leaves. This was my first time cooking spinach! It turned out great as a whole but I am definitely trying it again!
Thanks so much!

This recipe was the BOMB! Instead of using the dry Alfredo sauce mix, I purchased the Alfredo sauce in the jar. It was soo good I made it twice back to back. The first time I used regular Alfredo sauce and the second time I used the Alfredo sauce with mushrooms. The best recipe on here I've found so far and my picky kids loved it

This was so delicious and easy to make! I used Classico brand alfredo sauce and pesto from the jar, which I "dressed up" a little extra milk, butter, and fresh Parmesan. I also added a little crushed red pepper for spice, and everyone loved the pasta at our game night. I'll definitely be making this again!

I used the recipe for alfredo sauce that I found here on all recipes. This was one of the best meals we've ever had here. It was really good. The only complaint I got from my three hard-to-please guys is that there wasn't enough of it!

Great dish and super easy. I made a healthy version with the following alterations: I used 100% whole wheat penne which is so delicious. I only used 2 chicken breasts and used light alfredo sauce and lots of fresh spinach. I added onions, green pepper and red pepper. I used a 12 oz box of penne which made enough for my fiance and I to have lunch the next day as well.

This was so great!  My husband and I loved it. I added salt, pepper, oregano, and basil. I used premade/jar alfredo sauce and it was just as good.  I do wish I would have added more spinach.  I also used 16 ounces of penne noodles.  And I am sooo glad I did!  I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

Great flavor.  My only complaint was that my chicken seemed chewy, probably not recipe, probably the chicken.  We used Bertolli Alfredo sauce in the jar (couldn't find dry)and Kroger brand basil pesto.  Added entire 10 oz bag of spinach and basil at the same time. Topped with diced tomatoes.  Will definitely make again with, hopefully, better chicken.  Thanks for the recipe:)

Delicious!  Great, easy recipe.  Definitely needs a whole bag of spinach though - it seems like a lot but they shrink so quickly.  I also added added a grape tomatoes to add some color.

My whole family loved this dish. I substituted fully cooked fajita chicken breast strips because they are so wonderfully seasoned and cut into strips. I used a jar of alfredo sauce and mixed it with the pesto. I will absolutely be making this again and again. My daughter doesn't like spaghetti sauce, so this was perfect. Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is a great addition to any collection of delicious and healthy meals. As suggested by other reviewers, I used more spinach than indicated by the recipe. It seemed that I used too much spinach but after it cooks, they become tiny and mixes well with the rest of the ingredients. I cooked this for dinner for my boyfriend and I with lots of left over for lunch the next day. Didn't quite make it for lunch lol.

Yummy! I don't think hubby was a huge fan, but I thought it was delicious. It's true -- you can pretty much use any vegetables (I used frozen spinach, mushrooms, onion, some sun-dried tomatoes), any protein (I used chicken). I used a jar of Light Alfredo and a couple of spoonfuls of jarred pesto.

This was a hit. I could not find dry Alfredo mix so I used Alfredo sauce in a jar and I also used a whole package of spinach. My husband who is not usually an Alfredo  fan said it was a keeper.The next time I make this recipe I may use a cheese that is a little stronger such as gorgonzola.Also I may try it with shrimp in the place of chicken. The possiblities are limitless.

This was an amazing meal, but I had to do some substitutions since I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used squash filled ravioli instead of using penne pasta.  I didn't have any alfredo sauce so I added more pesto and it was amazingly good.  I also chopped up some tomato and put on top once it was cooked.  My kids loved it as well.

I've made this recipe several times and will continue to do so.  You can use frozen or fresh spinach, dry or pre-mixed alfredo or pesto and it is so quick and easy.  Delicious. A new favorite in my house!

This is just ok. I think with all the good reviews, I set my expectations too high. Also, the chicken I used had been marinated in Italian dressing, maybe that threw the flavor off from what it was supposed to taste like. I added some red pepper flakes to give it some spice. Probably won't make again.

I had the time so I made my own pesto (the garden was full of basil that needed to be used). I also made a home made Alfredo sauce, recipe on this site. It was time consuming so next time I will try it the way the recipe is written.

This is so good. I added a little more garlic and used Classico sun dried tomato pesto because I had it on hand, and I used the whole 4 oz jar. I used diced tomatoes and mixed them in at the end. I also added the whole bag of spinach. So delicious. I served it to my family with ciabatta mini bread, buttered, garliced and in the broiler for about 5-7 minutes until lightly toasted. Thanks MINERFAMILY :)

As is, it was GREAT for my four young children (ages 3-10).  With suggested additions (additional spinach, onions, mushrooms & sun dried tomatoes/cooked chicken with Old Bay), it was LOVED by me, my husband and my MIL!  Quick to make and all the ingredients were found at a regular store.  Will def go into the regular dinner rotation.

I used buitoni alfredo sauce (found near refrigerated pasta in my local store) with 2 tbsps of classico basil pesto in a jar (in my local store near the spaghetti sauce and velveeta cheese). I thawed out frozen chopped spinach & used that in replace of fresh spinach. I used leftover fajita chicken from a taco cabana taco. This dish was very good!!!

This was delicious! Best recipe I have ever used from this site!
I followed others suggestions and used 4 cloves of garlic, one bag of baby spinach and added mushrooms! I used canned alfredo sauce and pesto sauce. YUM! Also, like others have stated, boil water first, the pasta is the longest thing.

I tried this recipe. I sautéed my chicken breasts in olive oil and garlic, then cut them into thin strips and set aside.  I sautéed some sliced mushrooms in a little butter and also set those aside.  In a saucepan, I combined the alfredo sauce and pesto- I bought the alfredo sauce in the refrigerated section of the grocery store.  I then sautéed the spinach and added it to the sauce.   I cooked the penne pasta until al dente, then topped with the sauce/spinach and chicken and mushrooms.  I garnished it with some grated parmesan cheese and fresh chopped parsley.  Yum!

Gluten Free. Used 3 cups GF Penne noodles and Organic Alfredo (dry) with 1 cup of Coconut Milk and Earth Balance butter, which seem to cut down on sodium and fat. Added fresh basil on top with the tomatoes.  Was good, next time will add toasted pine nuts.

Good, but it didn't make enough sauce.  I used one chicken breast and there wasn't enough sauce, I couldn't imagine using 4 with this amount of sauce.  Other than that, it was really good.

This recipe was great. I read the reviews first, so I added a small onion and a chopped red bell pepper to sauté with the garlic. When I went to add the fresh spinach, I realized I only had a 1/4 of a bag left. Fortunately, I had some frozen spinach that I cooked and added. I agree with the other reviewers, the more spinach the better! I also never measure anything, so I put 3 heaping tablespoons of the pesto in. It was delicious. I will definitely add this into my meal rotation. Also, it didn't take that long at all to cook. I think the ready in 55 minutes part is an overestimation. I say about 30min. Wonderful:)

I follow the recipe, except I use a jar of Alfredo sauce (light)and a whole bag of spinach. 
 I bake the mixture just to blend the flavors.  Try putting Parmesan on the top and bake @ 350 degrees for about 30 minutes (uncovered.)  My family loves this...and it's so easy!

This was a great and simple recipe. I will definitely make it again. The only thing i really changed was the one suggestion to add fresh tomatoes as garnish. I agree i think i would use the whole bag of spinach next time... but i guess it depends on how much you like spinach!

This was excellent and was not time consuming. I also used the whole bag of spinach, and couldn't find the 4.5 oz. of dry Alfredo sauce packet so used one jar of Paul Newmans. Also used sun dried pesto as that is what we had on hand. Excellent taste and even the kids liked it!

Add my kudos for a flexible, fast and tasty meal. I didn't have spinach, so this time used broccoli heads (which I nuked for a bit to soften).  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was quick and easy.  A couple notes...First, the picture shows tomatoes...so bought Roma's and cut up three...tossed in at the very end for a few quick seconds with meat and spinach...then mixed into the pasta and pesto.  I really liked this dish, filling, but in a light way.  Not sure the kids liked it...but it's on my to keep and make again list.  OH...Forgot the cheese...dang it...but good none the less.

My family really loved this dish!!! I did tweek the recipe a bit.  I boiled my chicken until cooked inside, rinsed, cooled and shredded it.  Placed chicken and 3 pieces of garlic with olive oil in a pan, sprinkled with garlic salt and fried it up a bit.  I used a bottle of Alfredo sauce instead of the dry mix because my grocery store didn't have it but I think it may have worked out better.  I added about 4-5 Tbsp of pesto sauce to the Alfredo sauce to my taste and set it aside.   I added fresh spinach leaves to the chicken and mixed it in until a little the leaves became a little wilted.  I added chunks of zucchini to the chicken and spinach and mixed.  I then stirred in the Alfredo/pesto sauce to the chicken mixture.  Mixed well and I added diced tomatoes and Romano cheese.  Delicious!!!

Followed the recipe, just okay.  I couldn't find a 4.5oz pkg of Alredo only Knorr's 1.6oz packet so I bought a couple, almost burned it! I found my pesto sauce but it was a little expired so I only used a little.  I should have listened to other reviewers about starting your pasta because this is a quick meal.  It came out okay although it did need salt/pepper but I think, like others, I'll use jar Alfredo sauce next time.

Such a nice meal to serve my family! It was easy to prepare - I was careful with the garlic, seasoned the chicken with a tad of cajun seasoning and used an entire bag of spinach.  Many thanks to the Miner Family. This is a definite keeper!

Ok, I'm a mother of 2 with another on the way and I work full time so I love anything I can make in 30 mins or under. This is an awesome quick dinner ad the left overs are even better. 

I didn't have fresh Spinach so I had to use frozen I just tossed it in with the chicken for the last 3 mins. I also used pre-made sauces. 

I will be making this at least once a month.

I thought this was great.  Wasn't too time consuming to make and the taste was really good.  I used a whole packet of alfredo sauce mix and it was perfect.

This was fantastic. Only changed a few small things... I used a jar of classico garlic alfredo sauce. And I cooked the chicken in the olive oil by itself so that the Garlic didn't burn or brown too much. And I also used a Knorr Homestyle Stock, during the last few minutes of cooking the chicken, along with the chopped garlic.

I love this! I'm in high school and I make this for my family when they want to make something not so great. I make the pesto fresh and that helps a lot, I usually use fresh basil in the pesto but have tryied using the squeez stuff to save sometime and you can't tell the difference. I usually add more spinach than called for because it gives it a nice taste (I hate spinach) and when your large skillet of stuff is done I place a lid on top and put it on low heat while I finish making the rest. When it calls for a large skillet it really does mean large! I can use the recipe for 3 people and it can feed 3 people with seconds but have enough left overs for 2 people to have it for another meal. Truely my favorite!

We LOVED this dish, my kids, husband and all. I gave four stars instead of five because I think you really need to take advice of others such as: double spinach; season chicken first (mrs. dash!); jarred sauce is fine (seriously, a mix? never heard of it!); more pasta so not so "saucy"...and I used parm on top instead of Romano...anyway, same recipe, but with these changes definite 5+++ stars for taste and being so easy to prepare!!

I was not super-impressed by this but maybe it's just because I was expecting something different. It was good but just wasnt delish for me. I made my alfredo sauce without the butter (trying to make it healthier), maybe that was it? Used frozen spinach and a can of petite diced tomatoes, otherwise followed the recipe. Like I said, decent, will probably make again, but not blown away.

Cut the time in half by cooking everything at once. Good dish. We had company and the company loved it. Made some Garlic bread from scratch to compliment it. Tastes really good.

Very good option! I used jarred pesto and jarred low fat alfredo sauce. Felt that the garlic was a bit to strong and would dial it back a bit in the future and up the spinach (like many have suggested). Solid keeper.

This recipe was OK. I love that it cooked the chicken in garlic and that it used spinach. I thought putting yummy pesto into the mix would really make the recipe, but unfortunately I didn't think the flavor was that good. My guess is because of the type of dry alfredo mix I used. Hmmm...

This is an easy dish to make!  I altered the recipe to make it more healthy.  I used a bag of fresh spinach, used whole wheat penne pasta and fat free Alfredo sauce.  I also added a small can of sliced mushrooms to the chicken before mixing in the spinach.  It was amazing!

LOVED it! And so easy to make too! I used just a regular jar of ready made alfredo sauce... came out great and cut down on prep time. I also used my George Forman grill to cook the chicken breasts instead while I prepare the rest of the ingredients. Makes it so much faster and easier.

Loved it and will make again!  Based on previous reviews I did modify - added extra clove of garlic and extra 1/2 tablespoon of pesto, added 1/2 sm onion.  Used jar of alfredo instead of making from mix, increased spinach - could have used even more, added cherry tomatoes.  Turned out great!

There is nothing spectacular about this dish.  It's just not bad.  I didn't have spinach, so I roasted zucchini and put it in.  I also added chopped tomatoes to give it some color, and used spaghetti noodles.  There is absolutely no reason to use packaged Alfredo.  It takes more time, an extra pan, and tastes the same as regular bottled Alfredo sauce.  I would have gotten the same result by cooking noodles and dumping in a bottle of Alfredo sauce in it.

I felt that the oil called for in the recipe and the butter called for in the alfredo sauce directions made the dish too oily. I will make this again, because it is still delicious, but with less of each next time. I also agree with another user that the heat is too high for the garlic and that it burns almost instantly.

Wonderful! I thought it was a restaurant quality dish! I followed some of the reviewers in using Knorr's alfredo mix and it was plenty of sauce.

I just finished making this vegetarian style and it turned out wonderful.  I used half a box of pasta and half a jar of alfredo sauce.  mixed alfredo with the pesto sauce.  Sauteed garlic and onions then added spinach.  Rinsed pasta in cold water and drained.  Added sauteed spinach, sauce, feta cheese and chopped tomatoes and mixed all together.  Served with pan-fry salmon.....Great simple dinner that looks like more work than it is actually.  Thanks for the recipe; it was just what i was looking for!

Good, but can be perfected. It was a bit bland. Next time I will add salt, artichoke hearts, fresh diced tomatoes, and sauteed mushrooms.

Delicious!  We used light alfredo sauce in a jar, the whole thing, and only 12 oz of whole wheat pasta.  Came out great!

Loved it!  Made with skim milk and Light Butter to reduce calories.  Doubled the amount of spinach and added extra 1/2 Tbs pesto for richer flavor. Also, served with fresh asparagus and after the meal, chopped up the leftover asparagus and threw it in too, it was delicious!  You can't go wrong with this recipe, even the kids like it.

I made this dish last night. It was very good - everyone enjoyed it. I probably used more of everything than the dish called for...but more is more. :)  I would make this again. It was simple and delicious. I used wheat pasta and canned Alfredo sauce. Very good.

Not much flavor.  Family vote is to try it again in the future but double the pesto before we veto it out of the recipe collection.

This was very good and is already becoming a staple at our house.  I used the 0.9 oz. Knorr alfredo mix because I couldn't find any others at our grocery store and it still turned out great.  I recommend using more spinach - this is a great recipe for sneaking it in for picky eaters.

Great recipe. I boiled a whole chicken and seasoned it with cajun spice and used the breast from that. I used a whole bag of fresh spinach and sauteed a small onion along with the garlic.  For the alfredo sauce I used two packets instead of one and a whole packet of dried pesto and added a half cup of parmesan cheese to the sauce.  When mixing I added tomatoes.  For a bread side I used a store bought crescent roll topped with thyme and parmesan cheese.  This will definitely be added to my recipe file!

Easy, tasty, plenty of opportunity for adding more veggies. But I cut back on the chicken and added a lot more spinach. Couldn't find a dry alfredo sauce mix, but used bottled version, which was just fine.

This was delicious! My husband and two boys (7yr & 3yr) loved it too. I tweaked it--I added more spinach and sauteed chopped onion with the garlic and added mushrooms when the chicken was almost done cooking. Yum! Next time, I'll add more garlic and even more spinach and mushrooms. I used the dry alfredo seasoning packet to make the sauce and bought a slightly more expensive pesto...well worth it. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very Good. On the pic.i could see red peppers or ?? I had  jar of Alfred sauce, pesto MIX, permessian cheese, and this worked fine:-) Since we both luv spinach, we doubled it. :-) It's easy & tasty. Maybe i'll add grape tomatoes or red peppers, cuz we luv vegetables. :-) Thanks for this recipe :-)

This recipe was a nice combination of flavors and a big hit with the kids.   I was not happy with the powder alfredo mix that I chose however and since it's a major part of the sauce flavor, I would be more selective next time.   The quantity (4.5 oz) pkg of dry alfredo cannot be right.   I bought a 1.5 oz dry package from the sauce section and it made plenty of sauce.

Made last night and husband kept saying, "Yum, yum yum!" (And he is not a pasta fan!). I halved the recipe and used a 7 oz. container of pesto with a whole jar of Alfredo sauce (what was I going to do with the half jar left over?) and 1 cup milk. Forgot to add the tomatoes and it was still great!

I thought this recipe was good. I may make again at a later date and add other veggies to it. I used jarred alfredo sauce and it was great, next time I'll use a bit more pesto and season the chicken as I found it to be a bit bland. Other than that, this is an easy quick recipe.

wow! My husband could not stop raving. I followed Natalieshd's changes, used a small jar of pesto & a jar of alfredo. Also used bowtie noodles, a whole pkg of spinach & only one large breast ( for two ppl). Awesome! Used the leftover sauce the next night,added another pkg of spinach & about 1/2 lb of shrimp., loved them both.Thanks so much for this recipe, no need to go out to olive garden! It's a 10 star recipe!

So good and easy. For anyone saying it was bland- bump up the garlic and add a little onion. I also added pine nuts and well seasoned grilled chicken. And LOTS of spinach. Everyone loved it!

Only thing I changed was adding more spinach and mushrooms. This dish was good and very simple to make.

Simple and quick to throw together.  I never thought of putting pesto and alfredo together, but it works really well!  I used jarred alfredo instead of a mix, added some canned artichokes and topped with parmesan instead of romano.   This is a very good combination of flavors.

This is wonderful.  I also used a can of prepared alfredo sauce and it was super easy.  I used a type that has mushrooms already in the sauce.  I loved it and sometimes even add mushrooms to the dish.  Great Dish!

The recipe was quite easy and quite tasty, especially good to make on a day when you're wanting something rich. Next time I'll add more spinach (it wilts down to almost nothing) and I'll add a little more alfredo sauce for extra creaminess. All in all, very good. Being someone who loves lots and lots of flavor, this should be served with garlic-parmesan bread.

This was pretty darn delicious.  I was out of pesto so I added sundried tomatoes and red bell pepper when I sauteed the chicken.  I seasoned the chicken with italian seasoning generously and fresh garlic....other than that I followed the recipe as written.  Can't wait to try it with the pesto added to the alfredo sauce.....oh and ps while yes, jarred sauce would be easier, I did make the mix and yes it used another pan, but I really don't care for the heaviness of the jarred alfredo sauces available so the mix worked out just great for me.

So delicious! Tastes like something from an Italian restaurant! I opted to use Alfredo sauce from a jar and Classico pesto sauce. I used 3 tablespoons of the pesto and it turned out perfectly. Will definitely be making this again!

Absolutely delicious!!!  Followed the recipe sort of.  I added a bag of grated 3 cheese found in the cheese isle of market. I only used one chicken breast because lets face it, it's all about the cheese and pasta.  Garnished with the diced tomatoes and fresh grated Romano Cheese like the picture.  Pretty in my serving dish and delicious.  It was so good, I made it again 2 days after the first try.

I was really hoping this would turn out better. I may try this again with jarred Alfredo because this whole dish turned out mostly flavorless. I did add the whole bag of spinach; it could have even used more. Hope this turns out more flavorful for others!

It was very good and flavorful. The pesto really adds a lot to what would otherwise be a heavier and blander meal. I used jarred alfredo sauce, frozen spinach and whole wheat penne. It worked out very well and was very easy.

this recipe is FABULOUS everyone who has tried it loves it! Just do the chicken chunks on low heat to avoid toughening of the chicken (which just sucks). I like to get creative and add whatever veggies sound good! Tossing in mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes are my favorite! I use about 1/2 a jar of the classico light alfredo sauce or make my own, and heap on tons of pesto.

So...I made this with just a few changes. I used jar low calorie sauce, I chopped fresh romas and shallot to put on top, and seared the chicken and served it on top as well. When I put this in front of my boyfriend he said "Baby that looks like its from a restaurant!" It was good. Not a huge spinach fan but loved it and wish I had put more. Really Really good and easty! Thanks!!

Very easy and delicious...made my own pesto and alfredo sauce. I also doubled the amount of spinach, added sun-dried tomatoes for added taste/color and a blend of freshly grated Romano and Parmesan. Molto Buono! 
P.S. Even my son-in-law who HATES vegetables LOVED it!!!

Yummy Yummy! I followed another reviewers advice and cooked the chicken then foiled tented it while the rest was cooked/finish. The chicken was juicy and tender. I also topped the finished dish with diced lightly salted tomatoes. The flavors worked very well together. My husband and I enjoyed the meal. I will make this again!

WOnderful! I made my own alfredo sauce simply because it is so easy to do.
Be advised that pesto can be very strong tasting and a little often goes a long way. I usually add half the amount called for (in any recipe) and then increase bit by bit until it fits our tastes.

Absolutely delicious!  I love garlic, pesto, spinach and pasta, so how could I not love it!  The members of my family enjoyed it also, so it is a keeper.  I did just use chicken breast (bone-in) that I baked and removed from the bone and cubed.  The chicken turns out so tender when baked with the bone in and skin on it.  I also added fresh sauteed mushrooms since I had some to use up.  We will definitely be having this again.

This dish is a party in my mouth.  Sure, it makes for a lot of dishes, but it's completely worth it.  Since it's just the two of us, I usually only do one breast to cut back on cost, and make with whole wheat penne to add in some fiber.  Instead of Romano, I use parmesan.
It's really difficult to not make this too often, because it's such a tasty little number.

We did not especially care for this, although I'm going to assume that perhaps the alfredo we used was what we didn't like.  I didn't have a dry alfredo packet so I used a jar of Neuman's Own alfredo sauce and it just was not appetizing.  Next time I would definitely try making my own alfredo sauce.  My husband, who typically loves everything, didn't really even care to save the leftovers...not normal around here!

This is by far my favorite recipe I've ever made so far on this website (and also the first time I've ever reviewed anything here).

The only change I've made is that I use Barilla Plus Whole Grain pasta.

Otherwise it's amazing, I make it every couple weeks since I found the recipe. :)

this makes for a really good dinner!  the only thing that i would recommend would be to maybe double the spinach since when it's cooked it shrinks quite a bit.  and also, i would get the sauce done BEFORE you start the chicken, and maybe even the pasta because i followed the recipe directions as written, and ended up with the pasta and chicken/spinach being done awhile before the sauce was done.  loved this recipe, though! =)

Although I feel like I followed the directions to a "T" I had to use what I had on hand.  I can't beleive it would be much different on the tasting scale, but because I rated it a five I wanted you to know where the rating came from. My ingredient list 1/3 c olive oil; 2 cloves garlic chopped; 6 skinless, boneless chicken breast cut into strips; 4 c fresh organic baby spinach leaves; 2 1.25oz McCormick dry "Creamy GARLIC Alfredo" Mix; 1  .05oz Knorr dry "Pesto Sauce" Mix; 12 oz (more or less) Barilla Penne Pasta; Grated Parmesan Cheese; Cooking directions. Prepare sauce mixes and set aside.Start salted pasta water.  Stir fry garlic and chicken in olive oil appx 6 min until chicken is mostly cooked.  Add pasta to water, then add baby spinach to chicken.  Cook until spinach is wilted and chicken is cooked.  Add sauces to chicken mixture.  Check pasta, drain, add desired amount to chicken mixture.  Serve with optional fresh grated parmesan cheese.    Everyone in my home loved this. That's 2 adults and 7 kids.  I think next time I'll use the the Knorr CREAMY pesto sauce just because we prefer the milk base.  I would love to tell about the leftover...but, we didn't have any!  Maybe next time I'll double the recipe!  We really like "saucy" food and we served this with a crusty bread. Thanks MINERFAMILY for posting such a quick and easy recipe!

This is an excellent recipe. I did change it around a bit though. I used 2 heaping cups of frozen spinach sauted in a little olive oil till thawed and hot. I added 8 pieces of fried bacon crumbled to the spinach midway through cooking and used about 1 Tsp. of garlic powder. I did not add the pesto and I used 12 oz. of bow Tie pasta cuz I love it. I used 2 jars of Berella Alfredo sauce. I fried the spinach with garlic powder and bacon. then poured the alfredo sauce in the pan and heated through. I also added margarine and evaporated milk to the pasta before serving. This is my secret weapon with pasta that makes people WOW! I mixed the sauce with the pasta and put servings on plates topping each serving with 1TB. of shredded parm and desired amount of grated parm.

I would have given this 5 stars if the amount of noodles it called for hadn't been so scarce... I ended up using a whole 14.5oz. box.  8oz. just WILL NOT do it!  Also, why use the powdered alfredo sauce?  It's just more trouble to go to and less healthy - You can buy a healthy, liquid alfredo sauce that'll save you time and trouble...  Other than that this portion lasted me and and another person 3 days worth of meals!  (We made a salad to go with it.)  It's absolutely delicious.

Whole family loved it & my 15 yr old son is picky! Easy to fix, did use Purdue short cuts italian precooked chick strips and bertolli jar garlic alfredo sauce. Grated fresh blocks of pecorino romano & parmesan cheese to put on top & that really made the dish!

I made this for my mother, a notoriously picky eater, who wasn't thrilled at the concept. She came in the house and admitted, 'that smells good'. Then she came over and allowed 'that looks good'. Then we sat down to the table and I looked over at her to ask 'so? How is it?'   Let's just say it will be going into the rotation in our extremely picky household.   Very simple to make, and the Knorr's alfredo sauce (1 pkg) I used was surprisingly good! Will probably triple or even quadruple the spinach next time.

I absolutley love this recipe. I did make a few changes as others have suggested. I used an entire 10oz bag of spinach, I used 4 tblsps of tomatoe pesto and mixed with the alfredo sauce   (both jars are classico brand). I also sauteed some onions and mushrooms. Not a big fan of cheese so I didnt add any but it still turned out better than I expected. Thanks for the recipe. This one is definitely a keeper.

I did alter this a bit and used the jarred alfredo sauce since I was pressed for time. It was okay up until I added the pesto. But then, I've never been a real big fan of pesto, so I'm not sure why I thought this would suddenly change. If I do this again I'd probably make homemade alfredo sauce & just skip the pesto.

This recipe is great and soooo easy to make!! I have made it a few times and everyone has loved it and asked for the recipe. The only thing that I changed was that I used Knorr's Creamy Pesto sauce instead of alfredo. Definitely recommended!

Yum, this was delicious, and really not too bad for you either. I used a 13 oz. box whole wheat penne. Increased the amount of garlic to 3-4 cloves. Seasoned the chicken with cajun seasoning and black pepper. Increased the amount of spinach to an entire bag and also added some mushrooms as well. I think there may have been a typo because the dry alfredo mix I bought said 1.25 oz. and it was more than enough. We will definately make this again!

This is a wonderful meal that the whole family can enjoy.  Best of all it takes very little time to prepare!  I used a jar of alfredo sauce which cut the work down even more. Rave reviews from everyone in my family.  I used double the amount of pesto, double the amount of spinach and double the romano cheese and loved the results.

super easy and delicious!  I used the package of Knorr alfredo prepared and added the package of Knorr pesto dry.  Also added some sundried tomato.

Even my husband liked this recipe.  He is very picky. I used more spinach, pasta and chicken than the recipe called for since my husband doesn't like very creamy pastas.  Delicious!  I'm not a cook and it was easy enough for me to cook!

Pretty delicious, and very easy! I agree with everyone that you should at least double the spinach. I also added about 5 tablespoons of pesto instead of 3 and used alfredo sauce from a jar.

I love this recipe!! We never have any leftovers! I only changed a few items I doubled the spinach and used 3 tbs of Pesto as well. Other than that I thought this recipe was a simple and delightful dish!

This has become a staple dish in our house. It's easy to whip up and guests always rave about how good it is. I use jarred Alfredo sauce instead of the packets and like to also add slices of red and/or yellow peppers to the dish. We don't always add the chicken- it's just as good without it. When we do though, we'll marinate the chicken in Italian dressing, grill it and then add it to the dish right before serving. You can do so much with this recipe. It's fantastic!

4.5 stars!  I added one extra cup of spinach, two extra cloves of garlic, and also some chopped black & kalamata olives.  It's easier to eat if you cut the chicken into tiny pieces.  You can cut the butter out of the alfredo sauce and you won't notice a difference.  Topped mine with asiago cheese and.... mmm.  delish.  Next time i'll add some asparagus, broccoli, or artichoke hearts.

Very good!  I added the whole bag of spinach and I ended up not using the pesto b/c I realized I had garlicky alfredo sauce.  I also added some bacon bits!  VERY GOOD!

Don't know what everyone is raving about, I cooked this last night it had absolutly no flavor.  I have a leftover bowl of it I have to add maybe either Sundried Tomatos or Sundried Tomato Pesto to I hope that will add some flavor.  Will never make this again.

Awesome awesome recipe!  My roommates loved it and it has given me a good name for cooking in the house :)  The chicken I bought was a little too big as I had to use two skillets to cook it properly.  This recipe had more then enough for the four of us plus we were able to take it for lunch the next day with the leftovers.

This recipe was EXCELLENT!!!! I added a bit to the recipe. Instead of sauteeing the chicken I back in the oven. I added garlic, butter, onion, red pepper,and sun ripened tomatoes. I seasoned the chicken with cayenne pepper, italian seasoning, and onion powder. I baked til chicken was done. In my sauce I added white wine, buter, and onions. This recipe was amazing. My roommate and I loved it!!! Oh yea and it was easy!!!

This is the first time that I felt compelled to rate a recipe.  This was excellent.  I used sun of Italy pesto and a jar of Classico red pepper alfredo.  I added mushrooms and spinach.  I also added a little white wine to the sauce.  This was by far one of the best recipes I have gotten from this site.  One change, next time I will probably make more sauce (i.e. a jar and a half of alfredo).

I thought that this was a standard recipe; a nice base of ideas to play with and manipulate for one's liking.  Liked the mix of pesto and Alfredo.  I used an Alfredo sauce recipe from this site.  You don't need too much of this rich sauce to get a nice flavor!

This is an excellent recipe but I gave it 4 stars because it would be much better with freshly made alfredo sauce.  Of course the powder is less expensive and is still very very good.

Delicious as is, but next time I would leave out the alfredo pesto part altogether!  The chicken was awesome and the garlic and olive oil would have been great without the alfredo sauce added to it.  I only added about a cup of the alfredo sauce to it and left the rest on the side to be added if wanted.  By the way, I used a whole package of spinach.  You definitely need LOTS of spinach!!

Top notch..with a few changes in preparation. A secret to making this recipe is to season your chicken well. Marinate it if you want. I actually used spicy seasonings, baked mine, cut it up and added it to the spinach mixture. For those who had a problem with it being watery, remember to squeeze the water out of the spinach after sauteing it. The pesto added to the alfredo lends a classy taste that will make anyone you serve this to feel special. Make subtle changes if you desire, or following the recipe exactly might suit your taste. But either way, I feel this is a winning dish. Thank you for this recipe!

We really enjoyed this pasta. It was our first time using pesto in a recipe. Just served it with toasted garlic ciabatta bread. So easy to make. Would be a great dinner for company.

This is definately 5 star rating, great recipe, I used classico five cheese alfredo and classico pesto,I used a little less pesto because of the kids, I was just not sure if they would like it.  I added  mushrooms and 1/2 bag of spinach. I used al dente tri coloured noodles. Made this for the  family they all thoroughly enjoyed it.!!

This was good! My husband liked it. I made this just last week and to tell the truth, I don't even really remember the way it tasted, so it couldn't have been anything amazing, but it's easy and versatile. A pretty good pasta recipe.

Great start to a recipe as written.  I had to add more flavors for my taste. Can be adapted for just about any taste.  I used low fat Ragu alfredo sauce.

This is great! I was really skeptical about  it because of the powdered alfredo sauce mix, since I usually make alfredo sauce from scratch. Me, my husband, and the kids (both toddlers) loved it! I'll actually make it again the same way. Alfredo usually sits heavy on our stomachs, but the powdered mix gave it a lighter flavor. It's definitely a keeper!

Very tasty!  I added a few extra cloves of garlic, chopped tomatoes (as recommended by other reviewer), and served it over a bed of fresh (uncooked) spinach to reduce the richness a bit.

This is one of the best recipes I've ever used.  It was easy and tasted amazing.  I used a jar of Classico roasted red pepper alfredo and half a jar of Classico pesto.  I cut the chicken into pieces and used rotini pasta.  I skipped the spinach altogether because I served it with salad and asiago focaccia bread.  You can't go wrong with this recipe if you use an alfredo sauce that you really like.  I didn't even think I liked alfredo until I found a good one.  Some alfredos have a really strange taste.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This is definitely now one of my favorites!  I crave this dish.  I did a few things a little differently.  I probably used about double the pesto, I used a premade jar of alfredo sauce, and I grilled a package of proscuitto with the chicken at the same time I added the spinach.  I also used tortellini for the pasta.  YUMMMMMY!

This was great! I added about 4 cups of fresh spinach, though, and it could have used even more. I used bagged spinach, and I should have used the whole bag! Plus, I got the powder alfredo mix that was "garlic alfredo," which increased how garlicky it was, since we love garlic! Overall, this was a great and easy recipe!

This was pretty good. Maybe it was just the alfredo sauce I used, but it turned out a little bland. For the amount of effort it took (and all the rave reviews), I was a little disappointed.

Five Stars, If that family o' mine wasn't so terrified of "Greens" and other things are good for you...("What are those red things?? I don't like 'em!")  Ugh. Four year olds and a far too picky husband spent more time digging stuff out than actually eating... ~ I LOVED THIS!!! ~  I did make a couple of changes:  I started by pouring an 8.5 oz jar of Sun-Dried Tomatoes (in oil) in the skillet.  (Cut the tomatoes with scissors, for distribution), added chopped onion, minced garlic and Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle (oregano, basil,  thyme and garlic) and sauteed.  Added the chicken, cut into chunks and cooked. A FULL BAG of Spinach leaves.  Used linguine noodles, as that's what I had. A full jar of Bertolli Alfredo Sauce, and enough Alessi Pesto to turn the sauce a very light green.  And, finally:  A handful of Romano cheese. Served on a bed of (More) fresh spinach leaves, I was in heaven.  Regardless they didn't like it, I WILL be making this again.

This recipe was wonderful, will definitely make it again but will use less pasta and the whole bag of spinach as others have recommended. The pesto is delicious by itself, will probably add more of this next time.

Wow!  This was good!  I used a creamy pesto sauce mix instead of alfredo sauce and pesto seasoning.  Yum!

This recipe turned out fantastic! I followed others' suggestions and added extra spinach and garlic. To make this dish healthier I used all the pesto but barely enough alfredo to coat the pasta, and it was just creamy enough. I also substituted whole wheat penne and added sliced baby carrots, broccoli, and diced tomatoes. Freshly grated Parmesan cheese was the perfect finish.

I also have a recipe like this with shrimp and if has more flavor that way and the presentation is better with the shrimp too.  Good enough to have when all the ingredients are on hand.

Wonderful! I used double the amount of spinach, and will use even more next time - it really cooks down. I think adding chopped fresh tomatoes and mushrooms would make this even better.

We loved this recipe - but tweaked it a bit.  I can tomotoes so I added a pint of tomatoes to the mixture of chicken and spinach.  I agree with some of the other reviess in that the spinich could be doubled - also chopped or torn into tinier pieces.  Instead of chicken strips, I cut ours into bite-sized pieces.  Due to the packet of alfredo sauce we bought, I also had to add a bit of corn starch to thicken it - but I think you could by prepared/jarred alfredo sauce if you wanted to.  I drained the chicken/tomato/spinach mixture then added Italian Dressing to it and cooked some of the dressing off.  Then I drained it again...and added it to the alfredo/pesto mixture.  The pesto addes a fantastic finish!

Sorry, I didn't care for this one.  I used a bottled alfredo sauce instead of the dry packet.  The alfredo overpowdered the whole dish and it was the only thing I could taste.

Very good.  I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it. I made this recipe for 2 and added 1/2 cup of pre-made alfredo sauce instead of a dry mix sauce.  I used bowtie pasta instead of penne as well.

This is was great. I did make a few alterations.  I didn't have alfredo sauce so I made the Quick & Easy Alfredo Sauce from this site.  I also didn't use Spinach.  It was fantastic.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Good as is, but you can easily change out the veggies (broccoli is good) and add lots more spinach than this calls for. My PICKY 7 year old ate this and then asked for leftovers the next night. (I make my own low-fat pesto & freeze it and used whole wheat pasta)

This is a really good recipe, but you definitely need to add more spinach.  I used an entire bag (6-8 oz).  It looks like a lot, but once you add the spinach, it wilts down a lot.  So definitely add more than you would normally.

More labor intensive than this mom with two toddlers running around can handle.  My sauce didn't turn out smooth (should have used the ready made alfredo sauce), and anything using more than one pot is too much to mind and  too much to clean.  The spinach wilts quickly.  I only had to stir it in with the chicken and it was done.  In the end, it tasted ok, but I was hoping for something better.

This turned out delicious last night for dinner. My husband doesn't usually like creamy sauces, but he loved this. I was a little skeptical at first, since it tasted overwhelmingly of pesto, but once I let the sauces sit together (I used a jar of pre-made Alfredo), it mellowed out. I cooked the chicken earlier in the day when I had a chance, and that saved a ton of time on an already easy recipe. Will definitely make again, thanks!!

Yummy dish!  Very rich, creamy & delicious.  I used alfredo sauce from a jar and freeze-dried garlic instead of fresh, and added in some other Italian seasonings (oregano, basil, thyme).  It was quite easy to put together, and made a satisfying meal with some veggies on the side.

Great recipe!  Very easy to make.  I made a few changes.  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and italian seasoning.  I also added a few Tbs. of chopped roasted red peppers and used premade alfredo sauce, available in the refrigerator section.  I will make this again.

This was a good pasta recipe!  We followed the instructions except using veggie chicken instead of reg. chicken and more spinach.  Next time I might use a jar of alfredo sauce just to make it a little easier and quicker.  Overall, no complaints!

This recipe is good but I think I needed to add some more pesto or salt for more flavor.

This was very good.  The chicken didn't get as tender as I like, so I'll cook it a little longer next time.

Very tasty recipe.  As others have experienced, my spinach loathing husband actually enjoyed this dish!  That deserves 5 stars in my book!

Changes I made: sauted onions with the garlic, added canned petite tomatoes (drained).  Used 1 1.6 oz packet of dry alfredo mix, though I think next time I will use two packets for a thicker, creamier texture.

My husband hates spinach, but loved this dish.  I cut the baby spinach into small confetti pieces and he never knew it was in there until he finished. The pesto and alfredo make a great combination, but the flavor of the leftovers were a little strong.

Loved this recipe! The only change I made was to use the Quick and Easy Alfredo sauce from this site instead of the packaged mix.  My daugher, son-in-law, and 15-month-old twin grandbabies really loved it.  I was so tickled to see the babies eating bite after bite.  Thanks so much for sharing this.

This is wonderful!  I used a 6 oz. bag of baby spinach and I will add more next time.  Also used 4 garlic cloves. I made my own pesto and used 4 Tbsp. instead of 2. Made the alfredo sauce from this website, but only used half of that recipe.  I even tried this without adding the alfredo sauce and it was delicious!  Definitely add chopped tomatoes to top the dish at the end & sprinkle extra parmesean cheese.

This was ok - I think part of my less than enthusiastic review is that I didn't love the flavor of the jarred pesto I bought.  I think this recipe would be better (and save a step) by just using Knorrs creamy pesto sauce instead of making the Alfredo then adding jarred pesto.  I also think the recipe needs more than 2 cups of fresh spinach - I used a whole bag of prewashed baby spinach.

Excellent recipe.  I don't like cooked spinach so I didn't expect to like this but it was delicious and very easy to make.  Felt like we were eating a fancy meal.  I think it would be good served on a bed of rice as well.

Tried this one tonight, and the family liked it..I added a full bag of spinach
And..I would also try it with jarred alfredo sauce to cut down on prep time.
Maybe a splash of white wine?

This was very quick and easy and tasted pretty good too.  I added mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes as well as extra spinach.  Will probably with the refrigerated alfredo sauce next time.

I used full bag spinach, next time will use more, used 2 large breasts which was plenty chicken. I used Quick and easy Alfredo Sauce, by Dawn Carter. It only got better the second day. Used Penn pasta, will try linguine pasta next time.Dawns sauce was easy to reheat and thin down with milk. Both are keeper recipes.!! In a word, Excellent.

Very rich tasting.  I used Ragu's light alfredo, an extra T of homemade pesto, and the whole 6oz bag of baby spinach.  Makes 4 HUGE servings -- could easily be stretched to 6 servings with a veggie side or a salad.

This was delicious!  I will make it again and again.  Although it is higher in fat than our normal dinner menu, I balanced it out with the remaining spinach to make a salad.

This was pretty good.  I used a whole bag of spinach, added onion to the chicken while in skillet and used more Romano than it calls for and i loved it, as did my hubby.  I think next time though, I will not use as much pasta and I will cut the chicken into smaller pieces.  I am not a huge fan of chicken though, but I will definately make this recipe again.

My daughter made this for dinner.  She added sun-dried tomatoes, because we love them, and used bow-tie pasta because that was what we had on hand.  Everyone loved it, and we will make it again.

My family and in-laws liked this!  Wish I would have read the reviews and added the whole bag of spinach...the 2 cups did wilt down to just about nothing.  I started boiling my water for the noodles about the halfway point for the chicken being done and everything was ready around the same time.  I will definitely make this again with more spinach.

This dish was fantastic and crazy easy. Great for a qickie and impressive dinner. I took everyone's advice and put as much spinach as I could (2 bundles). I cooked it in a wok so I could fit it all in. Even my 5 yr. old liked it. This is part of our monthly menu for sure!

This was so good!! I used a whole bag of spinach, a jar of Alfredo, and a whole small jar of pesto. Then I added garlic powder, basil, onion salt, and pepper to the sauce. I heated the sauce in a separate pan. Then I added the chicken mixture to the sauce. Then when everything was done I took a small portion of the pasta water, then drained the pasta, and added everything to the pasta after it was rinsed. It tastes better when you marry the sauce with the pasta by using the starchy pasta water. I added 2 bags of cheese (4 cups). 2 cups of Parmesan and 2 cups of Mozzarella. My family loved it!!

This was incredible. The sauce makes the dish. Made exactly as written, however I used Kale because it’s what I had. 4yr old, 7yr old, and husband all loved it. Adding it to my favorites!

Tasty and perfect for a quick easy week night dinner! If you like spinach, you can definitely use a 9 oz bag of fresh baby spinach. I have used a 1.6 oz Knorr Alfredo sauce dry mix prepared as per package instructions and added just a half of yellow onion. Will make again. Serving size is 1 1/2 cups , makes 4 servings.

Followed the recipe, except I added some of the shredded cheese to the alfrado and also sprinkled some on top, it wasn't bad, wasn't amazing but it was good, it got my other half to eat spinach for once if that says anything.

Meh. I picked this recipe because it required less work and ingredients than it's counterparts. I also could not find alfredo mix packets. So, I opted for a jar of Classico. Perhaps that's where I went wrong? It's not a bad recipe. But, in order for it to be really delish one would have to make additions. Even the extra mushrooms and spinach did nothing.

Unfortunately, I like the Bertolli and Zatarins frozen pasta in a bag much more. Sad face.

Very good. I used a 15 oz jar of Alfredo sauce (not sure about the size of the dry mix in recipe). I will try a few of the other options people suggested as they sounded good - mushrooms and tomatoes.

I used whole wheat noodles instead of regular and accidentally didn't buy enough alfredo mix, but it still came out delicious! Would definitely make it again.

I made this recipe for the first time and loved it!  It will make it part of our regular winter meal plan. For the chicken, I coated it in the creole seasoning recipe here (https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/38214/creole-seasoning-blend) by shaking the chicken with seasonings in a plastic zipper bag before cooking. I also added mushrooms but might also consider adding sauteed asparagus and diced tomato next time.  The best part is that BOTH KIDS enjoyed it!

very tasty and easy to make.  

Instead of cooking sliced chicken I boiled 3 chicken breasts and shredded the meat before adding to the pan of olive oil/garlic .  I also used a jar of low calorie Alfredo sauce instead of a package of dry mixture.  The noodles absorb a lot of the moisture so I added 1/4th cup of chicken stock to the mixture.

I made this in my food science class. It was so fun! And cheap. I love this recipe and definitely recommend it. I just used pre packaged dry pesto and then a glass jar of sauce it was amazing! I added a little bit more Spinach! Also keep an eye on the garlic when you put it on the skillet it browns really fast I recommend this dish 110%

It was VERY GOOD, I validated alil.  I bought chicken strips cut that into cubes and seasoned the chicken with adobo, Cheyenne pepper, black pepper, garlic powder and paprika. I popped it in the freezer for 10 min to marinate faster. While the chicken was cooking I sauted the spinach in a small Dutch oven with salt and garlic. I used the whole bag of fresh spinach. Because it wilts down to nothing. This was actually very good. And will b making it again.

This is an excellent recipe.  Some of my guests literally said OMG out loud with their first bite.  I must admit that I made my own pesto and Alfredo sauce since I try to control salt in the food I prepare.  I tried this my substituting shrimp for the chicken and it was just as yummy.  Also good with Italian sausage.  My favorite was a combination of chicken and Italian sausage.  In addition to tasting like a five star restaurant dish, it makes a beautiful presentation.

Easy recipe.
Browned the chicken seasoned with creole seasoning.  Removed the chicken and covered with foil to keep warm.  Sautéed 1/2 cup rough chopped onions and mushrooms.
Increased the garlic to 4 cloves.  Added the chicken to the onion/mushroom mixture.  I also increased the pesto  to taste.
My husband loved this dish.

Instead of using the powdered Alfredo, I used a sauce in a jar.  I also seasoned the chicken before cooking it.

This is a good and straight forward recipe for me. I didn't need to use olive oil, and I think four chicken breasts is way too much. I used three and that was still too much.

Wonderful! I didn’t have any fresh garlic on hand so I used garlic powder and also added some onion powder. I doubled the amount of spinach as well.

This is my favourite recipe off this site. It's better than any pasta at a restaurant I've ever had. I use jar Alfredo sauce and cook my chicken breast strips with Italian or Greek seasoning. delicious! oh I also use a small bag of spinach. You won't be disappointed, tastes just as good the next day

Was easy to make, easy to find ingredients for, and the whole family liked!  Next time I will buy premade alfredo instead of the packet, would make it a bit easier and faster without changing a thing.

Tasty and very easy to make. I doubled the spinach, pesto and garlic because they are yummy and added mushrooms that needed to be used.  I only had a jarred Alfred sauce , and a good quality wide noodle. I served mine with leftover Cajun shrimp and the BF had chicken and shrimp. Topped it with cherry tomato halves  and diced green onion for color. Nice mild flavor, but that is what I was looking for. Thank you for sharing!

Very tasty! With a salad and some bread, it's a hit with the entire family!  I did add extra pesto into the Alfredo sauce and used kale instead of spinach because I don't care for the texture of cooked spinach. This is wonderful!

Delicious! Following the suggestions of a few reviewers I seasoned the chicken with herb chicken seasoning before browning in Tuscan herb olive oil. After sautéing the garlic and browning the chicken I then removed the chicken from the pan and kept it hot in aluminum foil. I then added a little more EVOO, more minced garlic and 4 thinly sliced mushrooms. When the mushrooms were sautéed I added a bag of baby spinach and while that was sautéing I chopped up the chicken and added it back in. Also, I used the Buitoni 16 oz Alfredo sauce instead of making from a dry packet and Parmesan instead of Romano. My husband and I both loved it. And since it made such a large batch we will both have work lunches from it this week.

Added extra spinach and about a half a cup of fresh basil. Also fresh ground pepper. It was excellent. Good enough for company.

This recipe turned out amazing.  The only thing I will say is DO NOT rinse off the pasta.  This is a travesty if you are Italian!!  Rinsing off the pasta takes away all the starch.  The sauce will coat better if you do not rinse.  I added a 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the alfredo because it was too sticky.

I really liked this recipe and will make it again. Next time, I will season the chicken a little bit band I will add onions and mushrooms. I will also add more pesto just as I added more spinach. This recipe is a keeper.

Wonderful recipe to start from. I used chicken thighs, cut into thirds, as I prefer them to breast meat. After reading other reviews I tripled the spinach, doubled the pasta and added sliced crimini mushrooms. I also added a splash of toasted sesame oil to the pasta water which gave a lovely note to the penne. I seasoned the chicken with onion powder, salt & pepper and at the point of adding the spinach and mushrooms to the garlic & chicken, squeezed a half of a lemon into the mix. I didn't use the alfredo mix but a jar of  Classico Alfredo to which I added my own fresh pesto. It was delicious right after making and absolutely divine the next day. So many variations to create. Have fun with this recipe!

wow so good. after reading reviews I decided to add garlic and pepper flakes to oil and then heat oil on medium high heat. the chicken was cut into 1" strips I felt that bite size peices may make chicken to dry. seasoned chicken with garlic powder and Mrs. dash. used 10oz. bag of spinach 3/4 jar of ragu Alfredo and three tbs. of classico pesto. next time want to try the sun dried tomatoes added for color.

This a good & simple recipe. However it really seemed to lack seasoning. Next time I'm going to use premade Alfredo sauce instead of the dry mix. That could have have been the problem. I added salt and garlic to the meat but it still seemed to be missing something. My kids loved it. I have a rich palette so that might me why I thought it lacked seasoning. However due to the simplicity of the recipe I will definitely make it again. It's a close 4 stars.

I did 4 stars because I tweaked a few things. I took someone else's suggestion with the creole and cayenne seasoning on the chicken (delicious)! I also added more than 2 cups of spinach, I added extra romano cheese and used a jar of creamy alfredo vs dry. I also added a tiny tiny bit of sundried tomato pesto as well as extra basil pesto. This dish was a HUGE hit with the hubby!

This tasted fantastic.  So creamy and tasty.  Leftovers were also good, but not as good as when first cooked.  Used bow tie pasta instead of penne, other than that followed the recipe exactly.

This is a great dish. My husband absolutely loved it, I liked it. However I don't think my issue was with the recipe but more with the alfredo sauce I used. I'll try a different brand next time. I too also used the whole bag of spinach as well. I will definitely try this one again.

My family really enjoyed this dish.  It is a little different than traditional alfredo since it has the pesto added.  So if you like pesto, you will like this recipe.   I made it just as written.

I couldn't find powder alfredo so I made my own from scratch (easy recipe with cream cheese, milk and parmesan). This meal was so amazing with the pesto and alfredo! I will totally make it again!

One chicken breast was plenty, but this ended up skewing the ratios and it was too garlicky and too pesto-y.

Turned out great! I used bottled, pre-made alfredo sauce and it was perfectly easy.

I have made some recipes from this site that were just OK but I think this one was the worst.  It's poorly written.  I've never heard of a 4.5oz. package of  dry Alfredo sauce or did you mean 3 packages of 1.3, if so why not say so?  Also where was the liquid for the sauce? I added milk.  My husband liked it, I didn't, it tasted just like fake Alfredo sauce, which is what it was.   
It really makes me wonder just how many people who comment on this site actually did prepare the recipe?

It was delicious and not too hard to make. Did it all within 30 minutes. My wife lived it and went back for seconds. I pretty much followed the recipe but on did 3 ounces of Alfredo Sauce Mix and nearly a bag of fresh baby spinach. I used the Classico pesto. I also added some chopped mushrooms. Definitely will make this again.

This meal was delicious and easy. Changes I made were to use about 3/4 of dried penne, 2 bags of spinach, 6 cloves of grated garlic and a large jar of Alfredo sauce. Very filling, plenty for 2 nights dinner for 3 adults. The pesto gives it over the top flavor. This now in by weekly rotation! YUM!!!!

I made it and it was delicious and simple to make, I'll probably tweak it next time and add more garlic and spinach. To save time may use my favorite Alfredo sauce in a jar and add the pesto. So glad I found this recipe!

This was good.  Like others, I used an entire container of spinach and there still wasn't a ton.  I used prepaid alfredo sauce and added a can of mushrooms.  I think a little red pepper flake might be good in here to spice it up a bit.

I loved the chicken garlic and spinach. The packaged alfredo is too bland and didn't give the dish the creamy butter flavor I was looking for.

What an excellent dish.  Quick, easy and oh so delicious!  Our only critique, we felt the chicken could have had more flavor.  Will try marinade on the chicken next time.

I have made many recipes from this site and always read the reviews for modifications before I start. With this in mind, this is one of the best dishes I have made from this site! My daughter, who tries anything but is very picky, said this is her new favorite. The only modifications I made were, I seasoned my chicken and floured it before sauteing it, I used a jar of Classico light alfredo sauce with the 2 TBS of Classico pesto mixed in, and I did add extra spinach (like others had recommended). This is so easy and tastes like you spent much more time.  It will definitely be one that we make again and again.

10 stars! I halved amount of pasta, used whole wheat too, doubled the spinach. Forgot the Romano and didn't miss it. Next time I'll triple the spinach. Mushrooms would be good too. The second time I made this, I used a package of Knorr Alfredo that has the pasta inside it. It tasted good, but it came out dry. Third time I used a bag of frozen broccoli. Still great!

Quick. Tasty. Definitely a do-over. Used parmesan as couldn't find Romano today. And I made it Gluten Free.  Sooooo good.

Mmmmm, very good w/some garlic bread and a fruit salad! Went w/the recipe with some of my additives. 1st, I marinaded the chicken overnight w/garlic powder, oregano, dried minced onion, pepper, garlic salt. Sautéed chopped onion, mushroom slices, chopped garlic then added cubed chicken. Added some water. Added fresh spinach & kale, fresh broccoli, as well as frozen 'steam in bag' 'steakhouse style creamed spinach' (which I put in microwave for 1/2 the actual cook time. In a 9x13 baking dish mixed all the above and cooked penne together. Used Barilla Alfredo sauce, adding 2 heaping spoons pesto. Mixed everything, sprinkled some mozzarella & 6 cheese Italian cheeses on top. Baked covered for 1/2 hr. @ 325•, uncovered and baked until cheese was melted. Turned out fantastic!!! Thanks for a great recipe! My chicken was moist & flavorful!

Not bad. 4 chicken fillets (2.1lbs) was way too much. Would have been better with just 1lbs of chicken and twice as much spinach. I tossed a bit of Italian parsley in for extra flavor.

Good basic recipe.  I followed others' advice and added additional spinach -- an entire container of fresh.  Also sauteed sliced mushrooms and an onion in the pan after removing the chicken.  Can thin the sauce a bit with half and half if desired.  Very good recipe! And very convenient with the jarred sauce.

Added mushrooms to the recipe. Agree with calizen, the Classico brand basil pesto (it looks chunky instead of blended) is quite good in the sauce.

This was very good!   It was quick and easy, too.   I made it pretty much as written as all I did differently was to add more spinach (to use up what I had) and perhaps a bit more pesto.  I will make again and will also make using shrimp.

Only change was to increase amounts for 5 people and like other reviewers I used Jar (2) of Alfredo sauce (Newmans).  Everyone loved it so it's a keeper and will make it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was really good! I swapped in rabbit backs, used extra spinach and pesto, and just used jarred alfredo until the consistency seemed right.

I made it exactly like the recipe and it was PERFECT!! I made it two days in a row because there weren't any leftovers the first time.  Tonight I'm making it and decided to use shrimp! I can't wait.  The Pesto added to my Alfredo Sauce made the world of difference in the taste.  Thank you so much!!

I made this for my large family and everyone loved it, even the picky ones! I used linguine instead of penne, added a little less spinach than the recipe called for and almost doubled the pesto (I used reduced fat pesto).  Next time, I plan to season the chicken with black pepper and red pepper flakes, but other than that, the recipe was good! I served the pasta with glazed carrots, garlic bread and salad! Definitely a repeat meal!!

Used Classico alfredo and pesto sauce. Halved the chicken but added twice the spinach, chopping it before cooking it. I don't even think it took 55 minutes. Great dinner for a weeknight, and quite tasty.

Much better than I imagined. The pesto added to the alfredo sauce makes such a difference (I got jars of each)! I cooked the chicken breasts in the Crock Pot X 4 hours on high & shredded it then wilted the spinach with the olive oil & garlic. I added much more spinach than it called for & only 2 chicken breasts with a full package of penne. Plenty for my family of 6 & several got seconds! Easy & really good!

This was delicious and decadent. It left such a wonderful smell in our house for the rest of the night too.  We used Classico alfredo and Pesto. Both my wife and I think we'd like a little bit more spinach the next time.

While it wasn't a bad dish, it was lacking in flavor.  By tweaking some things (needs more seasonings, DEFINITELY loads more spinach, less chicken - I used 3 normal breasts (not the pumped full of hormones huge) and it was too much, and perhaps another vegetable - maybe mushrooms or zucchini/squash ), it would be rated higher.

Yum!!!  Fantastic recipe.  It was a hit with the whole family.  I made my own sauce (instead of alfredo mix) with chicken stock, coconut cream.  It freezes well too.

Very good and easy!  I made some of the suggested changes. I added onion and mushroom. I also used chicken thighs  as they are less dry when reheated and this was a big serving for 2 people. 
Added tomato diced on top and some red pepper flakes for a little zip!

Was impressed with the ratings, so I thought I'd give it a try this evening.  Pretty much followed the recipe with the exception of using Classico jarred sauce and adding sauteed fresh mushrooms.  Although my husband stated it was good, I wasn't impressed.  Don't think I would make it again as I thought it was pretty bland.

SO GOOD (and affordable for a college student)
We used a jar of Alfredo instead of a packet mix. Also used 3 chicken breasts instead of 4 and it was plenty of meat. The recipe does not call for enough of spinach, I would suggest doubling the amount of spinach.

Used what "calizen" recommended and husband loved it -- entire bag of spinach, several TBSP from small jar of Classico basil pesto, 3/4 jar of Classico garlic alfredo, and topped with diced tomato.  I also used entire box of pasta and lots more freshly grated cheese.

I Absolutely agree that it is  delicious and quick.  I will use much more spinach the next time I make it and mushrooms and onions sound like a good addition.  The tomatoes as a topper added to plating experience.  Thanks for the tips.

My wife and I really enjoyed this dish. The next time I cook this dish, I will use 1-11/2 pounds chicken. The four chicken breasts totaled greater than two pounds requiring me to increase the other ingredients. I seasoned chicken with garlic-pepper blend and salt before cooking. I, like others, increased the spinach to one bag. The next time I cook this dish, I might include pine nuts.

I used a jar Alfredo sauce and store bought pesto and it was excellent. This is a fast and easy recipe that tastes like you slaved over the stove for hours. My young kids loved it and the visiting 11 year old cousin asked for seconds! This will be a regular dish in our house.

This dish was good but I did change it quite a bit. I used what I had on hand in a crunch for time. It was quick and easy.  I started by boiling my rotini pasta, chopped up my chicken into 1 inch cubes and crushed a couple cloves of fresh garlic. I seared the chicken and garlic in olive oil on medium/low heat Seasoning with onion powder, salt and pepper. Once the chicken was done I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and three heaping tablespoons of pesto. Let that melt together. Drained the pasta and added it to the chicken mixture. My husband isn't a huge fan of cheese so he ate it like that and I added Monterey Jack (cause it's my fav!) and it was DELISH, super fast and super simple. I loved the hint of mushroom that the canned soup gave, it was perfect.

I always hate when people change recipes so, of course,  I changed this recipe a little.  First I chopped 2 chicken breasts into bite size pieces and seasoned with seasoning salt and pepper.  I added chopped sun-dried tomatoes to this recipe, so I sauteed the chicken in a little of the oil from the jar of sun-dried tomatoes until almost done.  Then I added 1 clove of chopped garlic, about a handful of finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes, and about 6 chopped green onions (because I pulled them from my garden).  I continued sautéing until the onions were tender.  Then I added chopped spinach leaves, way more than 2 cups.  When the spinach wilted I added in 1 jar of Classico Creamy Alfredo Sauce and about 3 tablespoons of pesto from a jar.  I served this over tri-colored rotini pasta (just because I love the three colors).  Wish I could find tri-colored penne pasta.   So easy and delicious and no extra pots from making alfredo from a packet.  Next time I want to add some sliced mushrooms and chopped artichoke hearts to the sauté.  I will also probably try to make my own alfredo sauce and pesto in the future, but this took only about 20 minutes to make and came out great.  Thank you for this recipe!  What a keeper!

I used shrimp instead of chicken. Next time I will drain the noodles but not rinse it with cold water as I like to serve it warm. Not too shabby.

This is great taste. I used light Romano alfredo by classico. Added finely chopped mushrooms and 1/3 c sour cream to the sauce. This feeds 4. I would double the next time for guests.

I've made this several times since I discovered this recipe.  It's by far one of the best easy pasta recipes I've found.  You can make it even easier by getting a jar of Pre-made Alfredo sauce and mixing it with the pesto.  Tastes great, super easy, and it's great for big crowds!!

Instead of making with a packet of alfredo sauce, I followed the 4/5 star allrecipes alfredo sauce recipe and omitted the parsley. Soooo good! Both my husband and our friend were drooling over it!

I used a jar of garlic alfredo and a jar of pesto. I threw in some cloves of garlic before I remembered that the alfredo had garlic flavor. Whoops!! It was a bit much to say the least. I will also dial back the cayenne pepper next time. My husband liked it but it was a little spicy for me.

I love this recipe. But, I recommend using a high quality locally sourced cream sauce if you can. Makes all the difference. Super simple and delicious.

Nice recipe. I made the Alfredo sauce from a recipe from this site. I did not have proper amount of ingredients so I quartered the recipe. I like the combination of ingredients although I had to use Swiss chard from the garden. Even if I were to make this recipe again, I will make the sauce again from scratch and not from the boxed envelope.

My mom and I make this all the time, super easy and fast. Yummy, as well. We usually cook the chicken in the microwave without using garlic. Meanwhile heating up the penne, and draining. We add the pesto, chicken, Alfredo sauce, and spinach. We let the spinach wilt. The serve with romano cheese.

My sister is one of the pickiest eaters I know, but I didn't tell her what was in this and she ate three bowls and all of the leftovers! If I made it again, I would double the sauce and spinach, and only make two chicken breasts. Very good though! Loved the added pesto.

Wonderful! Used the advice of other reviewers and doubled the spinach, used a jar of Classico Alfredo, a jar of Classico basil pesto (tiny green jar), and served with sliced fresh cherry tomatoes on top. Very good!

This recipe was just okay, kind of bland. I added extra garlic and spinach, and sliced mushrooms, so I'm not sure what it was. I think next time I'll try a different brand of Alfredo or the jarred kind and see if that makes a difference.
Edit: Tasted much better the next day when reheated for lunch.

My 12 year old daughter picked this from AllRecipe.com and I must say it was truly  wonderful! I made my own alfredo sauce and then added about 2 tbsp of already made garlic and herb pesto sauce to the mix.  We actually made this dish twice and she liked the chunked chicken in it versus the breast. Not a big spinach fan and even she loved this dish. Definitely a 5 star for the ease and time to make such an impressive dish.

Awesome dish! However I did follow some suggestions from other reviewers: I cooked the chicken in the oven ahead of time seasoned with a charbroil seasoning. I added mushrooms to the garlic, then tore the chicken into pieces and sauteed it with garlic & mushrooms. I used 10 ounces of spinach & sautéed probably 30 minutes on low heat. I used 16oz of penne pasta with a full jar of Newmans Own alfredo sauce. The pesto was a little overpowering, so not knowing what my quest would like, I toned it down enough to be safe and ended up using the whole jar of alfredo & all 16oz of pasta. I also chopped 2 fresh tomatoes salted with sea salt and served them as a side dish. I wouldn't fix this again without the tomatoes, they added the perfect acidity to the dish. This dish does not have to be piping hot when served. I served it lightly warm with garlic bread & it was a huge hit. With all the additions it safely served 4 adults(3 of us had seconds). My 2 year old loved it too & we probably had 1 adult serving leftover. Great dish can't wait to make it again, I won't change a thing!!!

Really good and simple. I added broccoli to the dish. Will definitely make this again. Also, either use the suggested pasta, 8 ounce penne, or if using 16 ounce spaghetti, use large bottle of alfredo

I made this for dinner and made only very minor adjustments (one 1.4 oz package of alfredo sauce and double the spinach). It is a good solid recipe and it tastes good. I would make it again. I overcooked my chicken and it was dry but that was my fault and not the recipe. Next time I make it, I may try a jar of alfredo sauce just to compare, or use two 1.6 oz packages. Make it for weeknight dinner and you'll have a good hearty meal and more time to relax on the couch later.

It was OK. I think I went wrong in many areas. I did not buy milk since it was not on the recipe but the Alfredo package calls for milk. So i just did without. Instead i used butter and water. NOT THE SAME AT ALL I KNOW!. Also the chicken I bought was not the best. I might try this one again later maybe add a thing or two.

I loved this recipe and so did my family, and my husband doesn't usually like chicken! I followed another reviewer and took the chicken out of the pan after it was done cooking and covered it with foil to let it rest. I had maybe 2/3 of a bag of spinach left and cooked all of that in the pan (I took my garlic out before that). Instead of the Alfredo mix, I made fresh Alfredo sauce from another AllRecipes recipe (1/4 cup butter, 1 cup heavy cream, 1 clove crushed garlic, 1 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese). Sliced the chicken up, and then dumped it over the penne and dumped the spinach on top of that, and finally poured the sauce over everything. Mixed it up and served it with sun-dried tomatoes. It was delicious!!

Wonderful recipe! I do use more spinach, add onion and also use a lite Alfredo sauce to cut some of the calories. I also marinate the chicken breasts for 24 hours in Italian dressing. Fabulous and easy pasta dish to wow dinner party guests!

This was a good base recipe which I modified to my tastes. I don't like powdered sauces, so I started out sautéing garlic in a pan, threw in cubed chicken tenderloin until lightly browned, then adding in chopped fresh spinach.  I seasoned with a pinch of paprika/garlic salt blend, then added in the pesto, heavy cream, chicken base, And about a quarter cup of water. Brought to a simmer and then thickened with a tablespoon of roux. Tossed with rigatoni noodles and everybody was happy!

I made this recipe as written, no changes except to only use 2 chicken breasts because 4 seemed too many and I used a jar of Alfredo sauce to be more convenient.  I can surely say that the jar sauce may have been a factor in my not caring for this dish, but I can also say I don't know that I care to make it again.  The family just wasn't impressed.  I think I'll pass on this one, but it was certainly worth the try and it wasn't too bad the first day.  As leftovers, not so much.

HEAVENLY!!  This is a wonderful recipe!  I did saute the chicken in white wine for a bit, and I also added scallions and button mushrooms to it.  I used bottled Alfredo sauce, I like most, doubled the spinach that was called for. This was an amazing dinner and I would recommend it to everyone!

Really good, and pretty simple. I wish I'd used a jarred Alfredo sauce just to save some steps, but otherwise, it came together quickly and satisfyingly.

Great recipe! I absolutely love the pesto in the alfredo sauce. Maybe it would have been fine just cooking the chicken in garlic, but that didn't seem like enough to me, so I added some basalmic vinegar and a little salt and pepper and I really enjoyed it that way.

The dish turned out really well.  I used a jar of Alfredo sauce instead of the dry mix and a full bag of frozen baby spinach. It made a big pot for leftovers for the week.

This dish was awesome. Its easy to make and my family loved it. I bought jarred alfredo sauce, and I added bite sized asparagus to the pasta a few minutes before it was done boiling. I had about a half of a bag of fresh baby spinach, and about 3 cloves of garlic. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe.  I cook a chopped onion along with the chicken, and add some sliced mushrooms when the chicken is almost cooked.  I use a jar of Classico pesto sauce and a jar of garlic alfredo sauce.  Everyone I have made this for has loved it.

I changed the recipe and added three chicken breasts, one bag of chopped spinach, one table spoon of garlic, sprinkled onion powder for taste, pepper, two jars of Newman's Alfredo sauce and cooked it on a high setting for one hour and then switched it to a low setting for seven hours.  I did not add the pesto and this was unbelievably delicious.....

This is amazing!!! I buy the Bertolli brand Chicken Florentine and eat it all the time.  I am not a great cook but for some reason I decided to try and make my own. This was so easy and delicious. I couldn't believe I made it. It was just as good as anything in an Italian restaurant. My husband even said it was better that Bertolli! I used the jarred alfredo just to cut time and it was great, though I can see how a homemade sauce would give it a really nice texture.

Delightful and so simple!  Fresh cooked bacon bits and/or mushrooms (fresh or canned) are great additions - doubling the spinach is really important!

Very easy and tasty! I somehow managed to forget to add the romano cheese but it still came out pretty good. I also used jar alfredo sauce instead of the dry kind. Definitely a keeper...perfect for a weeknight dinner or potluck dish.

Good.  I found this under healthy recipes but the Alfredo isn't healthy at all. I used the Alfredo packets (McCormick) as instructed. I used high protein spiral noodles and Kirkland rotisserie chicken.  Would love to find a better healthier Alfredo that isn't chock full of sodium and think I would be more in love with the recipe if I did.  If you are not watching what you eat and you know of a kick butt alfredo recipe then you will love this!

This recipe was amazing! I used a jar of light Alfredo sauce and whole wheat noodles to make it slighter more healthy. Next time I might not add as much pesto to the sauce though.

This recipe was a hit for dinner tonight. However, I recommend either making your own sauce or improving the instant Alfredo sauce by adding grated parmesan cheese, butter, and garlic. It takes the meal to a whole new level.

This recipe is great because you can tweak it with lots of different options to suit your taste. I doubled the spinach based on other reviews even though I'm not a big spinach lover, it was yummy! I also added tomatoes and onions.  I also used jar alfredo sauce instead of the dry packet. I wouldn't classify it as healthy though.  The only healthy part is the spinach.

I used jarred Alfredo and did add some mushrooms.  The two kids that ate it loved it and so did my husband.  So this recipe is definitely a keeper.

Spinach has never tasted so good. I made my own Alfredo sauce(doesn't take anymore time than mix). I sauteed half an onion, yellow pepper, a splash of white wine with the chicken and since I didn't want to waste the spinach I purchased, I used more than 2 cups and I am glad I did. Thank you for sharing recipe. This is something I will make again!

This is amazing!  I followed the recipe as written except I used a jar of light, prepared alfredo sauce and it was a huge hit.  My teen asked me to make this every week.  Next time I'm adding more garlic, but that's the only change I'm making.  It's PERFECT!

I made this recipe exactly as it states minus the chicken, and it was great! I had more than enough to feed my family of 3, and leftovers for lunch without even using chicken in the pasta. Do use an entire bag of Baby Spinach-- it reduces quickly!

Loved this one...and it was super quick. I seasoned my chicken breast with italian seasoning, garlic powder and a few shakes of steak grinder seasoning. I also didn't have the powdered alfredo, so I used a jar of alfredo and a jar of pesto. It was awesome. Add tomatoes and lots of spinach like the picture for a pop of color! :-)

My family really loved this. It was particularly good in my kids' lunch pails the next day. All their friends were trying to steal their lunch! I added a LOT more spinich than the recipe called for and also upped the garlic sauted with the chicken. I just used the jarred minced garlic for ease of use. I also used the Classico jarred alfredo sauce as someone suggested. Probably not as healthy but a lot quicker. This one is in my recipe box and I'll definitely make it again and again.

I stumbled upon this recipe and loved the spinach and chicken combination. I followed the direction and didn't change a thing. First time, I made this pasta dish my extremely kids absolutely loved it !! My three year licked her plate clean. Since last week, I have made it twice already and my kids devoured it. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe !!

I made this recipe tonight and it was amazing. I took advise from the other review and add some mushrooms with the spinach part. At the end I diced up a tomato and added it to the top like a garnish and it came out amazing. I will be making this again but next time I am going to make the Alfredo from scratch.

Amazing!  I just used the whole package of spinach as well and used shrimp instead of chicken.  Also, I've found that I prefer to use fusilli noodles (or some type of spiral noodle) because it holds the sauce better.

I have been a wife for only 3 years and came from a family that cooked more frozen foods than they should have.. Since I've been married I have tried to find yummy and easy recipies since I am also a mom of twins. This was easy to follow and delish. I am making it for the second time tonight.

I was very disappointed with this dish.. This was utterly bland and desperately needed salt. I heeded advice from other reviews, but that didn't help this poor dish's case. Will not be making again.

Very good! I made homemade alfredo sauce and homemade pesto. Very flavorful. I'd maybe add some red pepper to spice it up just a bit or it would be good with sausage too. It's a versatile recipe, just be sure to season your chicken when cooking! Thanks MinerFamily!

This was convenient, because I could give my daughter the pasta alfredo while the rest of us enjoyed everything together.  (I also added some pine nuts, which went well.)  Yummy!

Great recipe. I surprised my wife with this recipe for a nice candle lit dinner and if this recipe won't get me lucky, nothing will. I advise using quite a bit of spinach with this recipe and I used prepared alfredo sauce in the jar. The Classico sundried tomato pesto was a great mix with it. I served baked kale chips as an appy

This has become a go-to recipe for me! I tweak it a little to fit my preferences but it has become one of my family's favorite pasta dishes. I prefer a lighter noodle than penne so I use fettucini instead. I also use about 10 ounces of spinach and as many sun dried tomatoes as I'm in the mood for! I also slice up 6-8 medium-sized mushrooms and throw those into the mix. Make sure you serve it nice and hot!

My family loved this dish. I make some adjustments though. I used 2 packages of dry Alfredo sauce because I used larger pieces of chicken. I also used mini penne pasta noodles. Next time I will try it with fresh mushrooms. Great recipe!

This is a real gem.  I could not find the packaged Knorr Alfredo sauce so I substituted jar of Classico Light Alfredo.  Like others, I used more spinach (two very large handfuls of baby spinach).  Tasted wonderful and made a really quick meal the second time I made it using a Costco roasted chicken.

Absolutely wonderful!! I also used the Classico brand pesto & Alfredo sauce from a jar. When I have more time, I'd like to try with fresh pesto & homemade Alfredo sauce.

This took about 45 minutes, but I think I could get it down to 35 if I started the pasta sooner. I used jarred alfredo instead of mix, rotini instead of penne, extra pesto, and extra garlic. I also threw some Tony's Creole spices on the chicken. I couldn't get enough - I really enjoyed it. Hubby thought it was pretty good. Maybe I'd add red peppers and mushrooms next time as well.
*remember to drain the chicken/spinach pan so you don't water-down your sauce!

I followed a few of the suggested modifications and it was great! I added the lightly salted tomatoes to the top (thank you NATALIESHD) and as I love spinach, I added as much spinach as I could fit in the pan! I also added a few shakes of red chili flakes as my husband and I love everything with a little kick! Very good and I will make again!

Amazing recipe and very simple! I made a few changes...for example, I didn't want my spinach cooked all the way down, so I waited until the end and tossed it in with the pasta so I had nice big spinach leaves and didn't have to use a whole bag. I also didn't get the milk to go with the alfredo packet...so I used a bit of butter and added the left over garlic and olive oil mixture from the chicken to make the sauce. I used a can of diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning and also used some of the tomato juice in the sauce.

I stuck to the recipe and found that this dish tasted excellent.  The flavors are strong enough to be noticed, but subtle enough so that if you wanted to change something in the recipe, the dish would not be ruined.  Awesome dish!

Just made this for dinner tonight and it is so simple and delicious!  I used the chicken fajitas that come in a bag.  This makes it so quick and easy plus gives it added flavor.  I also added red peppers which added to the flavor.  I will be making this frequently!

I liked this dish for the most part, but the sauce got a little heavy for me. Next time I try a pesto pasta dish I will put a little more effort into a cream/wine sauce to avoid the heaviness of alfredo.

This is by far my Favorite Pesto Recipe! I love pesto and my husband loves spinach so this worked out great! I was a little hesitant about how easy it was but I will definitely be making this again and again. I followed recommendations of using more garlic and a lot more spinach. I used a whole 'block' of frozen spinach. It was perfect! I also didn't make the alfredo, I just used a jar of Ragu low fat alfredo sauce and it was the perfect amount. 
This was so easy, and definitely makes a lot! I will make this very often for sure.

It was only okay.It takes a lot of work just for something mediocre. I doubled the spinach amount. The males in the family didn't even finish their plate. Not a big hit.

Like everybody says....this recipe blew my taste buds away! It was really simple and pleased everyone at the table. I only changed a few things- I took some of other reviewers advice and added more spinach and also added some sauteed mushrooms to garnish the dish. Wonderful dish and I look forward to making this again. Thanks for sharing.

This was a decent recipe. It was filling and easy to cook. Personally, I didn't love the pesto/alfredo combination, but my husband did. I think that if I were to make this again, I would use less pesto. I would probably also make my own alfredo sauce, which is very easy to do, and more nutritious. I did use a bit more garlic and some fresh diced tomatoes on top, but the rest I kept the same.

This was just delicious - Unable to find the alfredo sauce packets so used jar.  My husband said this was as good as a main dish that they serve at a local Italian restaurant (and it is not cheap!).  I did add some Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning, mushrooms, and Roma tomatoes.  Thank you, Minerfamily, for a great Sunday dinner!

Tried this recipe last week and it was a big hit!  I did change it slightly cause I had scallops I wanted to try instead of the chicken.  I am sure the chicken would be just a delicious.  The only other change I made  was to use a jar of alfredo per other reviewers.  Awesome...

Made this recipe for the first time today. YUM! I deviated from the recipe ingredients a bit by using a small jar of Alfredo sauce, thawed frozen spinach and served the whole thing on Angel Hair pasta instead of penne - simply using what I had. I topped it with a bit of diced tomato, which added nice color to the dish. Also, I put the pesto in the Alfredo sauce a few hours ahead so the flavors would blend a little. It's very easy to make, always a selling point with me. My housemate said it was one of her top 2 favorite things I've made - the other being a recipe I also found here. Yep, I'll definitely make this again!

We loved this!!  I had a larger package of chicken breasts so after reading the many great reviews I thought I'd just double it. I followed another reviewer's advice to cut up the chicken because it's personal preference.  I ended up with the recipe finally in a wok since I had so much spinach. (I did end up using 2 whole 10 oz bags of spinach).  The spinach cooks down very quickly and both bags easily fit into the wok.  The bad news is that TWO of us ate most of it for dinner.  (My husband is eating the small container of leftovers now.)  LOVE this so much and will be making little tweaks for 1/2 of the family to eat low carbs and trying it with different pastas.  Thanks MINERFAMILY!

I used garlic alfredo.  I added extra garlic and salt and pepper to the chicken.  I didn't have pesto and only have a small basil plant so I just used fresh.  I used a pound of pasta so I made a little extra sauce and topped it with fresh diced tomato and basil also I used 1 cup of frozen spinach and just added it to the pasta while cooking.

This was great!  I admit to being a bit of a food snob in the past and avoiding pre-packaged, processed sauces but we just happened to have an Alfredo packet from our daughters return home from College!  Guess what?  We really liked this recipe!  It was is a nice, light version of an Alfredo pasta!   No rich heavy, cream here!  It was really, very nice.  Probably not so great if you are on a low sodium diet, but otherwise this recipe can't be beat for ease, flavour, plus it is super time efficient!  Of course you could jazz if up with a miriad of veggies, spices, cured meats etc  if you get bored with the recipe - but you really don't have to - keeping it simple worked!!   Thanks for this recipe!

This was awesome!! I slightly seasoned the chicken while sauteing it with the spinach just trying to see if it could be eaten alone (cheating trying to think of another dish) and was pleasantly surprised. I am glad that this came together as nicely as it did. Even while having to upscale the servings size it was still a simple and low pressure. This will surely be a nice go to for during the week dinner.

I followed this recipe to the letter but instead of using chopped garlic I used  minced garlic and instead of using  a dry alfredo sauce mix I used a jar of alfredo sauce. My family and I loved it. Will definitely be making this again

I would have tried this recipe "as is," but both Hubby and I cannot stomach Alfredo Sauce. So I left that out completely. I also added more garlic, and diced up some onion. Next time i make this, ill be sure to add more than 2 cups spinach. All around a great starter recipe I was able to tweak to my personal taste, and add to my Rbox. :D

My husband who doesn't really like Alfredo and hates spinach really enjoyed it. We used a dry package of Alfredo and made it with non-fat milk, and served it with vegetable pasta. It was good and we will definitely make it again!

Really liked this; quick, easy and tasty.  I used leftover rotisserie chicken, which sped up the whole process.  Hubby even liked it, and for a packet meal, that's saying something!  Served with garlic bread.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was DELICIOUS!  My husband went on and on about how good it was.  I used baby spinach leaves and put them in the food processor to chop them slightly but that's the only change I made.  For my sides I baked grape tomatoes in the oven on 325 for 20 mins while my garlic bread was also cooking.  This is something different than I've ever made and it was such a hit.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I'll be using it for years to come.

I couldn't find a packet of mix so I just used Alfredo sauce in a can. I also used rotisserie chicken that I had left over. Turned out excellent!

I have four teenagers and a vegetarian husband. This was a big hit and requested to be a weekly addition to our menu. As a working Mom, this will definitely be added to my "quick and easy" recipes box.  I used bow tie pasta instead because the sauce was not as plentiful for thick noodles...would have been too dry.

Very easy to prepare and good. I did make one change, instead of using dry Alfredo sauce mix in the packet I used the jar sauce and instead of using the pesto in the jar, I used a packet of pesto sauce mix. I also squeezed fresh lemon on top and added some black pepper. This is a keeper. Yum!

I've made this several times and I love how the spinach wilts when cooking it in the hot oil.  I try to add lots of spinach because what may look like a lot of spinach reduces when cooked.  The green color adds pizzazz.

This recipe was a hit! Made it for my boyfriend and I and we both thought it was great. The only thing that I would suggest for beginner cooks like me is that the garlic only needs to be sauteed for a few seconds before you add the chicken. I sauteed it for less than a minute on medium heat and it had already started burning. Besides that, the recipe was great. I might also use alfredo sauce from a jar next time too, it tastes the same, if not better than the mix. Plus, it's easier and cuts down on time. I love this recipe! Will definitely be making it again.

Used a jar of alfredo sauce and two tablespoons of pesto. Didn't take long to cook, and was delicious.

I made this earlier this week and I loved how it turned out. Instead of using a dry Alfredo sauce mix, I just bought a jar of pre-made Alfredo sauce. And I used parmesan cheese instead of Romano Cheese. Despite these differences, the pesto chicken florentine recipe was so good. I will definitely be making this again!!

Four stars as is, five with changes.  I used two small jars of Classico Alfredo sauce as natalieshd suggested, but there wasn't an pesto Alfredo.  Instead I did a regular Alfredo and a four cheese Alfredo, and added 2-3 tablespoons of pesto.  Also added A LOT more spinach... As much as the sauce could hold.  I was worried it would be too salty or too rich, but it turned out perfect!

Very good quick pasta dish!  I doubled the sauce by using two jars of Alfredo and about half a little jar of pesto sauce.  It was very yummy!  My family all enjoyed it!  :)

This was an AMAZING recipe!  While I prefer making my own alfredo sauce, this was a "do it again" recipe.  Even my husband, who doesn't like alfredo sauce enjoyed it!  The picture showed tomatoes, but they weren't listed in the ingredients, so I added them (after I mixed it all together in the bowl, so they were firm, but warmed.)Then I sprinkled an Italian shredded cheese blend on top of each serving for appearances.

Made this for the first time when we had friends over for dinner this week. Got great reviews from everyone! I read the reviews & grilled the chicken first then placed it in aluminum foil. I used an entire bag of spinach, which I chopped a little, along with mushrooms.  Very good & is definately a keeper.

Tripled the spinach, added onions and more garlic. Used bottled alfredo sauce and fresh pesto I had from Costco. Didn't have fresh parmesean on-hand, but it was still great. Whole family LOVED it!

made with fresh grown spinach, right out of the garden- I doubled the spinach amount- should have tripled it and also used gnocchi instead of penne- spooned the sauce over top of it all instead of mixing it- to satisfy kids who like everything plain- but even my really picky teen liked the sauce

This is so yummy. Personally I like my alfredo sauce fresh, not from a package. It's the easiest thing to make with and generally its already in your fridge and cabinet.
All you need is some heavy cream, butter, garlic, parm cheese, and parsley. Mix to your own liking, if you like it really creamy. 
This dish is really yummy, and you can change it to be a bit more healthier by using lighter cheese and for the alfredo sauce, lighter cream sauce. Personally, I use mezzetta pesto sauce, its all natural and they put napa valley wine in it, so its really authentic and very tasty.

This is the yummiest recipe I have made yet. I changed a few things, used Lingunie noodles & refridgerated alfredo sauce. I doubled alfredo and the pesto and used a whole bag of spinach. I also added red bell pepper and sundried tomatoes. Next time I will probably add even more veggies.

Delicious! Next time I will be adding artichoke hearts and olives.  My husband wasn't thrilled with my alfredo choice so next time I think we will try another brand.  All in all it was wonderful but with a few minor adjustments I think this would have been a 5.

My boyfriend & I tried this last night and fell in love with it. Very simple and incredibly delicious. I will say that instead of using dry Alfredo mix, it might be easier to use a jar. Either way, this was fantastic!

Delish! Took advice & seared whole breasts & chopped after.  Added more garlic, of course, & shallots after chicken cooked a while. Used Classico's Light Alfredo to cut fat, etc.  Mushrooms would be a good addition, and, maybe artichoke hearts. Added sun-dried tomatoes & roasted peppers from Trader Joe's. Only used 2 half breasts & made enough for dinner, two lunches & meal for in-laws. Guess we are light eaters!

I have made this many times and after the first time, when I discovered Rebecca Swift's Alfredo sauce recipe-- I now make the Alfredo sauce instead of the mix and it is much better.  Also add one or two sliced Italian summer sausage with the chicken.  Wonderful meal with the potential for many variations.

I used dry garlic alfredo sauce and added a little more pesto since there was so much left from the packet I used to make it. Everyone LOVED this recipe and I will incorporate it frequently in our meals!

SOOO GOOD!  Tried first out of the allrecipes cookbook and its now a favorite.  I use classico pesto (small jar) and a whole jar of alfredo instead of the packet mixes.  I add the whole bag of spinach also.  I season the chicken first with Mrs Dash Garlic & Herb and the Onion & Herb seasoning, tastes out of this world! Is a favorite!!!

I added some salt & used a whole 6oz bag of spinach.  I also used 3/4 of a jar of alfredo sauce instead of mixing it up from a package.  This was really good.  I don't like spinach & am trying to find more ways to get some vegetables in my body.  I couldn't really taste the spinach, which was awesome. Thanks!

My hubby & I absolutely loved this! I tweaked it a bit. Had no spinach, so I used fresh asparagus. I seasoned the chix with Bayou Blast. Seared for 5 min ea side & added some cut cherry tomatoes & red pepper to pan while cooking. Microwaved asparagus for 1.5 min & chopped. Added to pan at end. Used 1.5 cups of alfredo & 3T basil pesto to box of penne. Sprinkled top with romano & asagio.

Below is my review for the first time I made it.  I rediscovered this recipe after trying to find a dinner dish to make for company.  

This time I sauteed minced garlic in olive oil and when the garlic was brown, I added quartered crimini mushrooms.  I then added the spinach (whole bag), and when it was wilted, I added the whole jar of classico alfredo sauce, and about 1/4 cup of pesto sauce (from henry's).  

I had no time to make the chicken, so I cheated and bought chicken strips from Church's chicken, that I cut into 1 inch pieces.  

I added the penne to the sauce mixture and topped with the chicken strips.  

SO easy, and we had no leftovers.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  

This is a 5 star recipe, so easy to alter depending on how much time you have and what ingredients you have.  


***I made a batch of this dish and brought half of it to the beach, and half of it to a family dinner we had the following night.  Both times, everyone who tasted it kept asking me how I made it.    I used Alfredo sauce in a jar by Bertolli, I believe.  And I used pesto in a jar too.    So yummy!***

This recipe is simple and delicious.  The alfredo sauce and pesto combine perfectly.  The grated romano cheese on top is amazing.  The salty flavor balances out with the sauce.  Love it.

Delicious.  I used pre-made Alfredo sauce & pesto to save time.  I used an entire 10 oz packaged of frozen spinach as well.  I ended up using more pesto so the flavor would be more prominent.

I made my own alfredo and pesto.  This was really great with coconut milk (not out of a can) and coconut oil as a substitute for milk and butter in the alfredo.  Sans the cheese, of course!  A delicious meal for a time-crunch.

This was really good and very quick.  I used a 15oz jar of Alfredo, 4oz jar of pesto, & frozen chopped spinach.  We like our pasta saucy so I added 1c of the pasta water to thin out the sauce a bit.  Also, used about 1/2 of the 4oz jar of pesto.  I grilled chicken breast and served on the side and served sauce atop the pasta instead of combining beforehand.  This tasted just like spinach artichoke dip!!  Served with "Great Galic Bread" and "Grilled Romaine Salad" from this site.

Delicious dish. Can be made with any bit-size pasta (my 5 year old chose shells). As other reviewers suggested used whole bag of spinach - great! Also used Parmesan on top instead of Romano cheese. Basically, the whole idea is in  Alfredo/Pesto sauce. You can improvise with the rest.  To mention I did not fry but backed chicken before I have put into the sauce.

Great dish! I followed the recipe as noted, only substituting a jar of Classico Alfredo sauce for the dry mix.  I used Classico Pesto sauce in the jar.   I toasted some walnuts and chopped them up, sprinkling on top just prior to serving - the whole family loved it!!  I will definately make this again.  Easy and tasty!

This was really good ~ I took some of the suggestions from other reviews ~ added more spinach and used a jarred Alfredo sauce.  Had homemade pesto in the freezer and used that ~ I would make this again ~

I loved this dish!  I did alter the amounts some though.  I used a jar of premade Alfredo sauce and 4 Tbsp basil pesto.  I also doubled the penne pasta and used 2 Tbsp Parmesan cheese.  I didn't consider these major changes...  just some preferences.

Good recipe. I made it exactly as it was and I would say that you definitely need the whole 10oz bag of spinach. Other than that it was good, but nothing to make me say "wow".

Oustanding! I used 1 lb of penned pasta.  A nice sized bag of fresh spinach leaves, 1 glass jar of alfredo  sauce.  I added 1/4 c of grated parmesan cheese to the alfredo/pesto (basil) mix.   After dishing onto plate, I topped with shredded parmesan and diced tomatoes.   One of our FAVES!

This was a big hit for my "girls night" dinner party.  I changed a few things...I made my own pesto adding about 1/4 cup additional olive oil.  I subtracted half of the amount of alfredo so that it had more of a pesto over-tone. I added fresh basil leaves with the fresh spinich.  The women loved this dish!

Good, easy, quick, and something that you probably already have the ingredients for in your cabinet. Not the most amazing pasta dish ever, but a solid dish.

This was good, but too fatty.  We used lowfat alfredo, but it was still just way too rich for me.  Unfortunately my picky boyfriend didn't like it at all.

This is one of the best things I have ever made.  It is restaurant quality for sure.  This recipe will be made many more times at our house. I added some fresh mushrooms and red onion, but it would still be 5 stars without the extras.

This came out really well. I followed the advice of other posters and added an entire package of spinach. I served it with garlic bread, mmmm. I give it five stars for the night of, and 3-4 stars for leftovers. I didn't think it tasted nearly as good the next day.

Good twist on florentine chicken.  I liked the combination of alfredo and pesto sauce.  I used skim milk in my alfredo mix to make it a little less heavy.  I also did not have any penne pasta in the house, so I used a pound of orzo and mixed it with the chicken, spinach and sauce and we really liked it.

So fast, easy and yummy!! I used jarred sauce and concentrated tube pesto.  Since I didn't have fresh garlic, I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and italian seasoning when cooking.  Still came out great! Thanks for this delightful recipe! :D

GREAT RECIPE! I would suggest more spinach, and I did what everyone else did. I bought reg. alfrado sauce instead of the dried stuff. Tastes just the same!

Made this for my sisters and it was amazing!!  I baked the chicken first with some lemon and pepper and garlic salt, then added it to the spinach/garlic mixture.  They loved it!  Would also agree adding more spinach than the recipe calls for.  Will definitely make this again

Very good! Great flavor and easy to cook. Yes, add more spinach. Alfredo sauce was great. I used the dry packet with no problem on the flavor. The pesto really added some zing to it.

Very good. I took the suggestion of others and added alot more spinach.  I think it would have been a tad better using jarred Alfredo rather than a dry packet.

Just made this for dinner.  Quick and easy.  We followed others' suggestions and used garlic alfredo sauce, 4 T. pesto, and 1 lb. baby spinach leaves.  For pasta, we used brown rice pasta.  Yummy!

Just finished making this and it was a big hit with the family. The only comments were more spinach and cut the Chicken into smaller pieces. I cubed them but they wanted them even smaller. Used Montreal chicken seasoning whils cooking the chicken. Everyone agreed that this was a keeper.

My dad swore up and down he hated alfredo sauce and spinach - until this recipe! I did add more pesto sauce, spinach, and parmesan/romano. It came out amazing, and when I reheated it for leftovers, just added some more pesto sauce. Will definitely make again.

This is SO good! I made it for lunch today and my boyfriend and I both LOVED it! I took the advice of others and seared the chicken. I seasoned the chicken with cajun seasoning, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder. I also added 1 small diced onion. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was delicious! Thanks so much!

This was good, but I've had many dishes just like it.  I was disappointed that I found this in the healthy cooking section because Alfredo is anything but.  I also don't particularly like buying things I don't have around the house and are very perishable just to use a tablespoon of it in a recipe, like the pesto (small jar is about $5.)  Frankly, anything smothered in alfredo sauce is good.  But I did like the pesto/alfredo combination.

Great recipe!  I sprinkled cajun seasoning, onion powder, and garlic powder on the chicken.  Cooked it and cut it into bit sized pieces. I then cooked the penne in one pot and then drained. In the penne pot, I poured a jar of classico alfredo, added 2Tbs pesto, added a package of frozen spinach, added the chicken, and red pepper. Once heated through, I added the penne.  It turned out wonderful!

Just an average alfredo chicken pasta dish.  If I do ever make it again, I will omit the pesto (didn't add anything IMHO, and expensive $4.29 for a small container) and use frozen spinach instead of fresh. (frozen is $1.00 vs. $3.00 for fresh)

This was very very good. Follow the recipe pretty closely to how it's written with the only exception of adding quite a bit more spinach, throwing a few mushrooms in with the spinach and upping the pesto to really let it's flavor come through. Easy to make and will be repeated.

This recipe was AWESOME! My new husband loved it and raved on how great it tasted AND looked! It was a little challenging for me to juggle cooking a few different things at a time since I am a beginner but it was worth it! I used light alfredo sauce from the jar-the pesto sauce really gave it the extra kick of flavor. I agreed with everyone on doubling the spinach-and I actually used more than half of the bag and it still could've used a bit more. VERY tasty dish and tastes just as good the next day so make extra for lunch!

I made mine with whole wheat pasta, added some capers to the sauce & it was pretty good. My only thing is the alfredo sauce really needs a kicker to make it taste different & light compared to traditional alfredo sauces.  Still looking for the right one. However, if you love alfredo sauce, this was good. Don't skip on the romano cheese on top, it really added the flavor.

Oh wow, this is GREAT!!  I'd never used pesto before because I wasn't sure I'd like it; now I'm searching for more recipes using pesto. As others have said, the variations could be endless: shrimp, scallops, onions, mushrooms, etc etc.  Thanks for the post!

We loved this! Thanks for the advice on adding extra spinach; I will probably triple the called-for amount next time (doubled it this time). Could have used a little extra pesto, in my opinion, but still very delicious!

This was a delicious weeknight meal! Low in calories and pretty healthy too. Nice and easy to make, although I used a regular small packet of dry alfredo mix, (couldn't find a large size) and did put a 9oz bag of spinach which is 3 cups. Everything came together nicely! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Delicious recipe!  I used a jar of Ragu alfredo sauce and added some mushrooms to my dish.  Next time I might try adding some black olives or artichokes. Will definitely make again.

Changed it a little - used a jar of alfredo and the pesto since I didn't have the mix, used only 2 chicken breasts, added sliced mushrooms a few minutes before adding the spinach, and would have added more spinach if I had more on hand. I also used a liitle less penne pasta, as I prefer it saucier. This is a keeper!

Very good and very quick and easy as well. I used more garlic to get a bolder taste and used jarred alfredo. This dish is now one of our household faves.

I admit I was distracted when I made this sucker, but darn!!! Step 1 should really be to cook the penne!  I fouled that up royally, but it still tasted pretty darn good.  Definitely season the chicken a little before cooking and just get a jar of alfredo sauce.  I used 3/4 of a cup and it was the perfect amount. Thanks!

I agree with a few of the earlier reviewers.  It was just ok.  It does seem a bit bland and needs something.  I added red peppers and mushrooms, but it was still lacking in flavor.  Maybe I needed a more flavorful alfredo sauce?  More seasoning?

This was good but not great. I willingly admit to not following the recipe especially closely. I used a jar of Classico 4 cheese alfredo and mixed in 4 frozen cubes (small) of home-made pesto. I substituted cubed turkey for chicken, because it's what I had in the freezer. Like I said, it was good, but not great. It WAS very simple and fast to make, however....by the time the penne was cooked, the sauce was ready, so literally dinner was made in about 15 minutes. Not bad but if I try it again, I'll use chicken instead of the turkey.

This was pretty good for a quick meal.  I used a jar of Classico Alfredo sauce and next time I will cut down on the pesto - it was a bit much.  I seasoned the chicken with a bit of crushed red pepper flakes and lemon pepper along with the garlic. I also added fresh mushrooms to the spinach while it was cooking and some sun-dried tomatoes for color and flavor.

My husband, picky eater who hates trying new food, LOVED this.  My two year old loved it too.  It was great.  I listened to other reviewers and doubled the garlic and spinach.  I also added baby portabello mushrooms.  It was even better the second day.

Great recipe! I only used 2 chicken breasts, added onions, and used the jar alfredo sauce. I think I'll add mushrooms next time too. Take it easy on the Romano because it's salty.

I liked the recipe, but think the sauce is too much.  I made half of the recommended amount, with low fat milk even, as well as added chicken to my recipe, but it still seemed like there was too much sauce from a quantity and too much/many cream/calories standpoint.  
I used freshly grated parmesan cheese rather than romano and thought it was a nice touch.

OK...I know some reviewers said that it was us and not the recipe, but I just didn't love this recipe.  I'm not sure exactly what it was that didn't work for me, but just not a keeper.  Maybe with more seasoning or diced tomatoes, but something was just a little off.

This was just wonderful.
Our daughter and son in law stopped by un-expectedly for dinner, and we all gave this 5 stars.
I normally don't make things from packages, but I wanted to try the Alfredo mix to try the true recipe.  However I did make my own pesto, (basil, walnuts, olive oil.  This is a keeper!
Thanks for sharing.

Easy to make, tastes divine.  I used leftover rotisserie chicken that I had, and saved some time.  Also used 2 packets of Garlic Alfred Sauce Mix (McCormick) and the entire bag of 9 oz spinach.  Added 3 tbsp of pesto for a stronger flavor.  It came out brilliant!!

Yummy and easy to make!  I used a sundried tomato alfredo sauce that I had in my pantry and it turned out scrumtious.  It definitely needed more spinach, however.

YUM YUM YUM!!!
I didn't follow the recipe exactly but used it more as a guide. 
I cut the chicken in strips and seasoned prior to cooking. I used 1 jar of classic alfredo sauce, a whole bag of baby spinach, 3 tablespoons of pesto and stirred lots of parmesan/asiago/romano cheese mixture (found next to the Kraft grated parmesan at the grocery store) in the sauce. I think the extra cheese thickened the jarred alfredo a bit, otherwise it would have been too runny. It turned out sooooo good! I'm looking forward to making & eating this again!

This recipe is so good!  I made mine with linguine as it's what I had on hand, but really any pasta would be great.  I added about a cup of sliced fresh mushrooms and also seasoned the chicken with cajun spices as it was cooking in the pan because other reviewers said their chicken ended up bland.  Had no problem with the chicken being dry.  Cut it into bite-sized pieces instead of slices.  We just had the leftovers and they were almost as good as the first time around!  Definitely a good meal to serve to company and it is incredibly versatile.  The recipe can be changed in many ways to suit your tastes, such as adding different vegetables or omitting them altogether.  Also, add as much or as little pesto as you like.  I spread some of the pesto I had left over onto bread and broiled it to eat with the meal itself.  I also stirred some into a pot of spaghetti sauce I made the next day.  If you're not a spinach lover, add it anyway - I promise you can't taste it and it's soooo good for you!

We love this and have it quite a lot! My kids love it and that's saying something when they know there's spinach in it.  The only thing I changed is that I used a jar of Garlic Alfredo sauce rather than from a packet.

Hmm, let's see, I used a jar of alfredo and a "few" :) tablespoons of pesto w/basil.  I doubled the amount of pasta and put in 2 bags of baby spinach leaves from the produce section.  YUM!  This was incredible.  I think next time I'll try to add a bit of curry powder to give it the "florentine" flavor I'm used to eating.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good sauce. And we ate spinach!!! I think the chicken would have been better if it had been seasoned and grilled on the BBQ, then thinly sliced and laid on top of the bed of pasta/sauce. I didn’t find the chicken prepared the way suggested in the recipe to have very much flavor. Good sauce though!! and I think throwing some fresh diced tomatoes on top would add a lot to this meal (like the picture).

I really liked this dish. I basically doubled everything to make more. I also bought Classico Pesto and Classico 4 cheese Alfredo sauce in the jar and used a whole jar of the Alfredo and half jar of the pesto. (It would probably be even better if you made the sauces homemade). I used whole wheat penne. It was very tasty and would also be great with shrimp instead of chicken.

Good. I left out the Spinach and used mushrooms and sauteed Shallots. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I added a lot of my own flair. Thanks!

This principal for this recipe was awesome.  I gave it four stars because I made my own lower fat alfredo sauce and low fat pesto.  Also, I used shrimp instead of chicken and like many others added a lot more spinach than called for.  Also, I liked it better with fettucini.  This tasted better than what I'd order in a restaurant and it was much healthier!

This is just delicious!  I added mushrooms to mine, and used a whole jar of alfredo sauce and half a small jar of pesto (both the Classico type) so the sauce covered all of the noodles insead of just staying on top.  I also cut the chicken into bite sized pieces instead.  I love this recipe and will definitely be making it again!

This recipe was great! I used a garlic alfredo sauce and it turned out perfect. Next time I make it I will probably use the entire bag of baby spinach leaves. Definitely try this recipe!

Wow this was great! I used a whole bag of spinach, and I added a few sliced mushrooms as well. I spiced up the chicken with some hot sauce while cooking, which added some nice flavour to the recipe. I couldn't find any alfredo sauce here, so I made some from scratch (light butter, flour, light cream, Parmesan cheese, skim milk, salt and pepper). I used whole wheat pasta, and you could not tell with all the yummy sauce. It turned out great, and this is in our regular rotation now. Next time we may try it with shrimp for a change.

Awesome recipe! I have made it twice for company and still need to work on getting the right ratios of chicken to pasta and spinach, but we've loved the variation every time. The second time I added lots more spinach and it was so much better.

I made this for guests and received many compliments as well as a request for the recipe. For the sauce, I simply added a bit of dry pesto sauce mix to the Alfredo sauce mix. I also used Parmesan cheese instead of Romano. Will definitely make this again!

this is delicious, even my picky boyfriend liked it.  i read the reviews and chose a sun dried tomato pesto and a jarred alfredo sauce.  i also marinated the chicken.. i just used a store bought herb marinade, i feel like it would have been a relatively bland dish without doing that.  i'm not one for measuring, but i'm sure i used more than 2 cups of baby spinach leaves.  also, i had to add a TINY bit of salt and pepper to taste at the end.  i topped it with some diced tomato and parmesan (instead of romano).  this cooked up really well!  excellent.

This recipe was pretty good altough it reminded me a little of one of those frozen dinners. I added tomatoes, onions & mushrooms and also used whole wheat pasta. Next time I will probably just skip the pesto or find an alfredo sauce with pesto added. I will also add more spinach because it cooked down a lot.

My husband loved this! And I did too. I hate chopping garlic, so I used a little jar of chopped garlic instead. The spinach cooks down a lot, so  I will use more next time. Also, I like more sauce, so I will make two packs of alfredo sauce next time. I love pesto, so I layered it on thick. 

Next time, I'm going to try sundried tomatoes.

I ended up making my own alfredo sauce but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was pretty good, but seemed to be missing something.  I may have to add some type of veggie to make it more suitable to our liking.  Otherwise pretty good.

The flavor in this dish is wonderful, however I did make some adjustments. I used 3 garlic cloves, an entire 9 oz. bag of spinach, 1 cup of homemade pesto, skim milk (for the Alfredo sauce to cut down fat/calories) and 1/2 cup of grated Romano cheese. I used dry ziti pasta because I was out of penne. I think next time I may leave the pasta out to cut down on carbs and just pour the sauce over chicken tenders! I found that a Pinot Grigio Chardonnay paired nicely with this dish along with slices of a Sourdough Roasted Garlic ciabatta loaf with Garlic Lemon Butter (you can find this recipe on this site). I spread the butter on each slice and baked at 350 for 7 minutes.

This is a great recipe!! I put too many noodles and did not have enough sauce for it. I used a whole 12oz pack. Next time I will use what the recipe calls for or add more sauce. It was a hit!!

I give this recipe 4.5 stars, it was good. I followed a lot of other reviewers' suggestions. I used 4 cloves of garlic, the entire bag of baby spinach, a jar of alfredo by Classico and I added the pesto to the chicken instead of the alfredo. It was a very easy recipe and I will make it again.

This was so good!  I was cooking for 9 so I tripled this recipe and made a few changes as per previous suggestions.  I cut 6 uncooked chicken breasts into but size pieces, then cooked them in the garlic/olive oil.  I used two bags of fresh baby spinach, one jar of sliced button mushrooms, two jars of prepared alfredo sauce, a large jar of pesto packed in oil, and 3 boxes of penne pasta.  We had plenty of leftovers for the guys to take home and they were more than happy to do so.  I'll definitely make this again and again!

I liked this but as is it is too bland. Next time I would definitely put more pesto, salt and garlic cloves in. And other people are right about one whole bag of spinach instead of just two cups. I also tossed some freshly diced tomatoes on top which gave it a good flavor.

Awesome!  The two best tips I found in the comments here were to add the whole bag of spinach (really!  it cooks down to nothing) and also to have chopped salted tomatoes on top for garnish and flavor.  A great recipe and it looks wonderful on a plate.

This was wonderful.  I used a jar of Alfredo sauce vs. the packet, served with some garlic bread- yum!  This dish also warms up nicely for leftovers.

I thought this was an excellent recipe. I will be making a couple adjustments like adding more garlic and spinach as suggested by others. Overall though, easy and delicious.

This was so delicious!!!  I took the advice of others and used a jar of alfredo sauce.  I also purchased a small container of pesto in the refrigerated section.  I used a lot of garlic!!!  It was delicious and we even loved the leftovers.  I will make this again!

This recipe is great.  The first time I made it I followed other reviewers tips and cut the chicken into bite-sized cubes, peppered it, and then added some minced garlic and sliced mushrooms to it a few minutes before it was cooked through.  I also added a whole bag of spinach.  For the sauce I bought a jar of Alfredo and a jar of pesto and mixed them together.  I also really recommend adding sundried tomatoes at the end when you mix it all together- adds just a little extra and also makes the pasta look prettier.  This is a staple in my house and is great as lunch for the next day!

My husband and I loved this dish and how easy!!  I did not mix the spinach in but maybe I will next time.  I just cooked it on the side.  But I don't think I would like cooked fresh spinach in my pasta, I may just toss it in fresh at the end.  Most pasta leftovers are very dry and this one looked that way when I pulled it out but when I warmed it up all the sauce came to life and the chicken has soaked up a lot of flavor.  It was wonderful!

This was so yummy and so versitile! I didn't have garlic so I browned the chicken with onion instead. I used frozen spinach instead of fresh and I made my own alfredo sauce. I added about 1/2 cup of cream cheese to the chicken spinach mixture while I was waiting for the sauce to come together and it added a slight tanginess. I will definitely keep this one.

Pretty darn tasty! The only thing I would change, as the others have already mentioned is maybe doubling the spinach since it cooks down so much as well as adding some seasoning to the chicken. I used homemade pesto, and a jar of Bertolli Alfredo sauce. I added some canned mushrooms and it turned out great. Will make again!

This was a big hit with the family.  I made my own alfredo sauce and used prepared pesto in the container and it was delicious.  The pesto adds a nice flavor to the alfredo.  I cut my chicken into strips and seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and cooked in an olive oil/butter mixture and the chicken had good flavor...not bland.  I also threw in the garlic after the chicken was in the pan for 5 minutes or so.  I didn't want it to burn.  Also, I started cooking the chicken at the same time I started the pasta so that the chicken wasn't done too early and then dry out.  I also didn't want to wilt my spinach down to nothing.  Definitely use more spinach than called for.  I used an entire bunch of fresh spinach.  Good recipe, a little longer to make but worth it.

I expected way more from this.  But it could've been my pesto or the dry package alfred.  that was grosse.  I think you have to make your own.  By the way 4.6 oz. of dry sauce is WAY too much.  one jar of premade would be sufficient or 1/2 of the dry stuff.  Used a ton more spinach than called for.  I will make this again w/ diff. alredo and see how that works.

What a great little recipe!  So full of flavor in spite of the fact that there are so few ingredients.  I did not have garlic so I just used garlic powder, and like many other reviewers I also used more spinach (even though I'm not a huge fan of it).  The leftovers are just as good if not better!  Thanks for this recipe...cooking dinner for your family is so important and I'm thankful for this great website to help us keep meals interesting and healthier than eating out!  :)

Pretty good.  In mine for some reason the chicken overpowered the whole dish.  I think I'd add more flavors to the alfredo sauce (I used Bertolli in a jar).  Thanks.

It was a lot of work and cost for the mediocre result, there's very similar frozen-meal-in-a-bag, which costs less and takes less time with less clean up and with similar nutritional values. I thought it was ok but won’t make it again.

This has great flavor.  I didn't have any spinach, so made it with just the chicken and pasta.  Also used jar of Classico Alfredo instead of using packaged.  Super easy to make and quite yummy.  Thanks!

This recipe is great because you can make it all from scratch or all from mixes and pre-made ingredients. It didn't look anything like the picture because once you mix it, it's all green because of the pesto...Great for a weeknight meal, but maybe not for company.

We really loved this recipe!  Made a fresh pesto from this website (had lots of fresh basil) and grilled the chicken with some lemon pepper to give it a little more flavor.  I did add a whole bag of spinach  and added about a half cup more milk to make more sauce.  Delish!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was awesome!!  I did a two substitutions due to resources:  garlic alfredo instead of regular alfredo and half a pesto-sauce packet (similar to the alfredo).  My husband isn't a big fan of pasta or chicken but he loved it.  I will make it over and over again!! *****UPDATE: I've made with Alfredo in the jar and I didn't care for it half as much (although my friend raved about it). It was too thick for my taste. Just shows you that this recipe really depends on the alfredo sauce so try one that best fits you!

I made this dish when I had family visiting.  Everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe. I doubled the spinach and probably could've tripled it. I also used Sun-dried tomato alfredo sauce and doubled the sauce (The pasta absorbed a lot of the sauce).

I thought this was just ok but my boyfriend gave it 4 stars.  I didn't think I would like the dry Alfredo sauce mix, and I didn't.  It was edible but I don't think I would make it again.  It could have been better with a real cream sauce and some parmesan cheese.

Great recipe.  My family and friends loved it.  I used the whole bag of baby spinach leaves and found it to be the perfect amount for our taste.

this was a pretty good recipe, I did short cut it though by purchasing four cheese alfred in the jar, next time I will try doing it purely from scratch.  And for the chicken I'll go bite size using tenderloins w/ MORE garlic and spinach.  All in all, a good meal..thanks!

Delicious!  I used twice as much spinach, and it worked great.  I added plenty of shredded parmesan and tried it once with turkey too.  Works great for a frozen meal for dinner trains, or potlucks.

A better version of the plain old pesto/noodle chicken I usually do.  Added more pesto then recipe stated because we like pesto.  Never cooked with fresh spinach like this before either.  Worked fine.  Will use more spinach next time.

This was delicious, I had my husband make it for me as a belated Valentine's dinner, men are soo cute when they can't cook. He used the already made alfredo sauce, frozen spinach, and added mushrooms and tomatoes. He also added more than 4 oz. of alfredo. Definitely something I would make again. It certainly was like something from a restaurant and if it can be made by someone who's idea of cooking is Kraft dinner or grilled cheese, not to difficult either.

Eh...not too impressed.  Tasted like a frozen diet entree.  The salt from the store bought pesto and the dry alfredo mix was enough to keep me floating around all night and into the next day.  I like the idea, but will do it with homemade alfredo and pesto.  Thanks for the idea though.

I made this the other day, and it turned out absolutly fabulous. I decided to add mushrooms and I used a garlic alfredo recipe in place of my dry alfredo sauce packet (I like my sauces a little thicker, and tastier) and I also added fresh white mushrooms. Overall this turned out great and I will definitly make it again!

I wasn't thrilled with this.  I wish I had added some tomato as planned... I forgot.  It made WAY too much for the two of us...  it was relatively easy, and I was very pleased with how the chicken turned out (I took advice from here and seasoned it with pepper and Italian seasoning), but I thought the dish was bland overall.

I enjoyed this dish.  I added a LOT more seasoning to the chicken (including cooking it with a bit of the pesto) so that the dish tasted more congruent.  Great flavor.

This was absolutely fantastic and we plan on making it again.  The only thing I would change next time is more sauce, which got absorbed into the pasta.

Family enjoyed.  I used a 6 oz. bag of Baby Spinach which was perfect for my family and a jar of alfredo sauce made with aged Parmesan cheese.  Added some extra garlic and served with a warmed three pepper focaccia bread.  The sauce is heavenly.  Thanks

This was great! My boyfriend loved it. I made a few changes. I added about one cup more spinach and one diced tomato. I also used an alfredo sauce recipe from this site but used asiago cheese instead of parmesan because I had some left from another recipe. I will definitely be making this again!

Great recipe. I made this for dinner when my parents came to visit. My father had seconds, that is the best complement any italian food can have, being he dislikes italian. Very easy to make, tastes great reheated the second day as well.

This was very good although homemade alfredo would be better. Also, you only need 1 package of alfredo sauce mix, I made two and it would have been soup if I had used both!

Very good, but just a little too bland.  With a few adjustments, I think this would be a great dish.  I think I'll try more galic and salt next time.  Thanks!

Delicious! I don't even like spinach, and I loved this recipe. I didn't have any Alfredo packets or jarred sauce, so I found an easy recipe for it here on the site and made that instead. It all came together beautifully.

This was so tasty!  I made a quick decision to purchase the jar of alfredo instead of the mix and I'm sure that made the recipe quicker.  I was also generous in the amount of spinach (at least 3 cups) and basil pasta (very rounded tablespoonful) that I used.  This would be excellent with a Pillsbury French loaf or other fresh crusty bread.  Next time, I will try the sun-dried tomato pesto.  Thank you for the delicious recipe.

I'm not even a big pesto fan but I loved this recipe.  I wish I would have used more spinach as suggested because I think it really does need at least four cups!

This was good. I followed the suggestion to use jarred sauce, and then, to save even more time, I used pre-cooked chicken. It came out pretty tasty!

Was very good.  Used Parm cheese instead of Romano. Was my first time using pesto---used a tomato based pesto and came out great!  Also used jarred Alfredo...Will make again

This was sooo good! My husband really liked it. I think I would have liked more spinach, too, but don't know if my son would have, and he LOVED this . Because I don't like pesto well enough to keep it in the house, the one thing I did differently is that I added about 2 Tbsp of Basil Paste instead. Thank you for such a good, easy recipe!

My family loved this dish.  I doubled the pasta and had plenty of sauce to go with it.  Next time I might double the spinch.  I would suggest cutting your chicken into more bite size peices then the strips it calls for.

Excellent! I used light jarred alfredo sauce and sprinkled fresh tomatoes on top before serving. Great with a caesar salad and garlic bread. Both me and my boyfriend loved it. Will be making again... thanks!

This was awesome.  Even my picky kids loved it.  I served it for guests and they raved about it and wanted the recipe. The first time I made it I used homemade alredo sauce, the next time I used canned.  Both times were excellent.  I doubled the spinach the second time I made this, because it wilts down to nothing and there just didn't seem to be enough.  Definately will be making this often!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good.  Added fresh tomatoes on top at right before serving.  Even better the next day after all the flavors got to meld.  Made with jarred alfredo and entire bag of spinach.

Great recipe-incredibly easy and quick for the great taste you get in the end! My husband's only recommendation(and he always has one) was to possibly consider marinating the chicken before hand, which I agree would really add to the dish (possible in an italian-seasoning based marinade); otherwise, this was a great change with great ingredients!

Really good meal, serve with a salad and bread. I used whole wheat pasta and sun-dried tomato pesto. Next time I am going to try a different cheese. I was pleased with how quick and easy this was to make.

This is a great recipe.  I did not have the alfredo sauce or pesto on hand, so we just used spaghetti sauce.  My whole family loved it and it helps get spinach into my kids diet.

This was a great hit!! I didn't have a pesto receipe so add lots of basil to 3 tablespoons of olive oil, fresh parsley and 4 tablespoons of freshly grated parmesan to make the sauce, didn't have romano cheese, so used fresh parmesan on the top.

This was so-so.  I deleted the spinach because not everyone would eat it.  I had to double the recipie, and maybe that was where it went wrong.  All in all, it was a good enough recipe.  Id probably make it again but I wont double it, and maybe use it as a side dish.

There were no leftovers from this dinner, it was so good.  The only changes I made were to add half of a diced onion to the chicken and garlic mixture.  Adding fresh pesto makes the pre-packaged Alfredo sauce seem much more "homemade."

Very good. I easily doubled the spinach,used way less meat and jarred alfredo sauce, added Classico Pesto sauce to taste, as well as some bleu cheese salad dressing for kick. It smelled wonderful, was easy, and tasted just as good the next day cold. Thanks Jamie!

This was great!  I love spinach so I put in a bag and a half.  None of us thought it was too much spinach so next time I'll just use two full bags.  In fact this is the first time EVER that my 12 year old son would even look at spinach, let alone eat it, and he loved it!  This recipe will be used often at our house!

This was good enough to make again, but its not something I would crave for.  I doubled the spinach and chopped them pretty small so my 3 year old and 1 year old could eat it easier.

My family likes mushrooms, so I sauted them and added.

This recipe is very good I will definitely make this again. I made it before reading the reviews so I made real changes other than chopping the spinach rather fine. My 2 1/2 year old enjoyed it (he eats like a bird typically). Next time I will take the others advice and add more spinach.

this was pretty good...i used about half the pesto, though, and it was as salty as everyone said. next time, i think i'll omit the pesto altogether --  the alfredo sauce mix (from spice island) i used was WAY too good to mess with! :)

It was okay.  It seemed like a lot of work, and  tasted okay, nothing to write home about.  I added 2 bundles of spinach also, and that was definitely a good amount.  Any less and I don't think it would have been worth adding.  I don't think I will do this one again.  Maybe I am just a novice cook, but it was too much to get ready all at once, you make the sauce, noodles and chicken all at the same time otherwise it would have been cold.

This was very easy to make and tasted great. Definitely needs a whole bag of spinich and the heat to sautee the garlic needs to be lowered. Added some chopped onion with the chicken,  and did it all in a wok becuase of the spinich. Will definitely make again.
