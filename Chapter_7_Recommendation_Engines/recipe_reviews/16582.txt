Nice flavor.  I used cubed boneless chicken breasts and added some pineapple chunks and a splash of soy sauce.  Thanks!

Great flavor.  Not a big fan of rum, but it blended nicely. The rum was not overwhelming.  Next time I will try grilling it. My son re-named it Pirate Chicken, because Pirates love Rum!!!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  It sounds weird but I added some cubed fresh peaches to the pan about 5 minutes before it was done.  My husband thought the chicken was finger lickin' good and our 2 year-old ate it too.

I made this written to a T other then have a few extra pieces of chicken to use. I was so-so with this personally (something with the flavor) and my family totally loved the recipe. The chicken was tender and moist. I'll make it again for the family, because they liked it. Possibly would change the molasses to honey.

Yummy! Simple, I might go for boneless thighs next time, and a longer lower cooking time. But the flavor is terrific and I won't change a thing about it.

'Think it's the Canadian part - molasses - that didn't hit me just right.  Maybe it needs a spice or two to balance the sweetness.  'Not bad, but not memorable either.  I expect a good dish when having to marinate it.  Not this time.

A nice change from the every day recipes.  My family enjoyed the chicken but it wasn't a recipe that they raved about.

This dish was ok, but the marinade wasn't as strong as I was expecting. I think a more equal ratio of ketchup to rum would be more appealing, and I'm not sure chicken thighs were the best cut of meat.

This was just okay.  It was lacking flavor.  I don't think that I will be making it again.

Great flavor!  Didn't bother broiling the chicken, it was fine from from baking.
