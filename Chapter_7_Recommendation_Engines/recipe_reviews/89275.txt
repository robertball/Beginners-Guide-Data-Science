Wow! What a nice change from those sauces loaded with butter and cream. This was great with a salad and garlic bread. Be sure you let the sauce reduce at a slow boil to let the flavors mingle. I will make this again and again. Thank you for sharing!

This sauce was great/I added some basil but I dont think it needed it. You didnt say when to add the garlic so I added it with the clams and sauteed them together. I used orecchiette pasta/

Easy fast and most of all good. You need to go for it and add about a half of stick of butter.

This was awful!  The dried oregano overpowered the other ingredients. The only way I could salvage this was to add melted butter and lemon juice.  Only then was it passable. Perhaps fresh oregano would have been better.

This recipe was AWESOME but I made one mistake...I only had 2 cans of clams instead of 3 so the spices were a bit overwhelming at first.  Fortunately I had some marscapone left over from another recipe and added that.  Turned out absolutely delicious!

I cut the portions back to three servings and used 1/2 tsp dried oregano as I garnished the finished dish with fresh. Lots of flavour going on in this dish and I loved the kick form the red pepper flakes however after simmering it for 20 minutes there was very little liquid left. If I were to make this again I would simmer it for no longer than 10 minutes or add a half bottle of clam juice.  Thanks for sharing.

Awesome and super easy! I also added a little lemon for some acidity.
Will now become a regular on the dinner table.

This can be really good with a few changes. I love hot and spicy food but cut the red pepper flakes in half because the full Tsp overwhelms the dish, use one heaping TB parsley, not three, add a chopped onion, and some fresh or canned mushrooms. It needs butter, 3 TB, a little white wine if you like that flavor, and reduce 30 mins.  Sprinkle a little grated Parmesan over before serving.

This is a very good sauce recipe!! My 12 yr old son made it and did not add all the clam juice and it was still very tasty, though the 3 tblsp of oregano was a little too much without the extra liquid. It might need a little salt, too!  I will try making the recipe myself in a couple of weeks.
