A great marinade for ham.  I marinated a ham steak for about 8 hours in the frig and there was a nice orange flavor with a hint of cloves and ginger when we ate it. The only change I made was to shorten the grilling time. Easy clean up, too; you can't beat that!

This was delicious- I used pineapple juice in palce of the orange juice. Marinated the ham overnight in a big baggie. Will make again & again, thanks!

Absolutely delicious!  I forgot to get the sparkling white grape juice so I substituted with some fruit juice but it was still great!  I would make this again in a heartbeat!

This was the hit of a recent Brunch.  I couldn't find "sparkling" white grape juice; used regular white grape and added 1/4 cup of lemon/lime soda.  It was absolutely delicious and looked good too!

The only changes I made was that I used red grape juice instead of sparkling white grape juice & whole cloves instead of ground cloves. Ended up grilling on a indoor grill pan due to severe weather in the area. Served with baked potatoes and corn. This was delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was just OK for me.  Although it was very easy.  Nothing wrong with it, but I will still search for another basic ham recipe.

Caution to those looking for low sodium recipes! This, as are most cured meats, is extremely high in sodium. I have been browsing through the low sodium recipes on this site and find that many use canned products (also high). This entree alone has the full daily allowance of sodium in ONE serving.
