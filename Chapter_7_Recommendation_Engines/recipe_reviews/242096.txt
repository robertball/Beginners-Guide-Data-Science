I did tweak this a bit. I basically halved it - but went heavy on the grapes. I also used an 8 oz can of pineapple chunks in pineapple juice, and a 5.3 oz 100 calorie strawberry Greek yogurt. This made a yummy breakfast (= I think it would good with toasted almonds sprinkled on top.

Estimated ingredients since I made a huge bowl of it to serve everyone (adults included). Very tasty. Definitely want to cut grapes in half.
