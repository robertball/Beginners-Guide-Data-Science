I've made this recipe twice now.  First, as directed.  It's a very good base recipe.  I only slow-cooked it for 6 hrs.  The second time I made it, I cooked it for the full 8 hrs.  I doubled all of the spice ingredients and added a teaspoon of liquid smoke.  It was simply delicious.  Bravo to the chef who offered this wonderful recipe!

Barbecued pulled pork with the addition of other flavors makes this one stand out from the others. In step 5 hold off on discarding the cooking liquid until you read the 'Cooks Notes'. Adding the liquid in place of the bbq sauce works really well with this.

Followed the recipe as written except I used pork tenderloin and our favorite  homemade BBQ sauce.  As suggested, I did not discard the liquid and added it back to the shredded pork.  The meat soaked it all up!  I then added the BBQ sauce to the shredded pork, but also served it along side for those who wanted more.  Got RAVE reviews on New Year's Eve and will definitely make this again!

11-27-15 ~ WOW, this a a fantastic pulled pork recipe.  I had a full pork loin that I cut the two ends for pork roasts and used the middle section to make a very large batch of pulled pork.  I made as written and plugged the crockpot in Friday night when I went to bed.  We woke up to an incredible smell on Saturday morning.  I saved the broth and shredded the pork.  Since I was giving part of it away, freezing some and serving some I did add part of the drained liquid back in the pot.  The bbq sauce was added at the time of serving as not all wanted sauce.  This was fantastic and I will certainly make it again and I've already shared the recipe, twice.  I paired this with 'Citrus Jell-o Salad' and 'Twice Baked Potato Casserole from Crisco' both on AR.  We had cole slaw on the side to add to the pork,  if wanted.   My parents joined us for dinner to see our son before he left for TN. (5-stars)

This was a big hit.  I cooked on low for 6 hours....next time I will do 8 hours.  It shredded just fine, but I think it would have been easier to shred after 8 hours.  Used Stubbs barbecue sauce.  Followed recipe to letter, and was absolutely delicious!

This recipe was delicious! We made it into sliders, using Hawaiin sweet rolls with a dill pickle chip and cole slaw on each one. They were a big hit!

This was so easy and delicious. I made it exactly as written. It had a slight sweet taste with a nice kick from the cayenne pepper. I saved the liquid it cooked in to moisten the meat. It made a ton. I separated the pulled pork into two separate dishes, one I made with a sweet smoky barbecue sauce and the other I used a tangy mustard based barbecue sauce. Both were great. Served on nice fresh buttered and toasted buns with some sweet Cole slaw. Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make again when I have to feed a crowd.

This recipe is EXCELLENT!!  The rub was the best combination of spices and sweetness that I've come across yet, and I've been looking and trying recipes for a LONG time.  My search is over!!  Not overpowering or overly spicy.  I'm sure you could add additional spice or sweetness to it, but this base is your perfect starting point!!  I used a 7.5 lb fresh picnic with the bone, I heaped the measurements of the RUB INGREDIENTS ONLY,  except the salt and pepper, for this size  pork and cooked it in slow cooker on low from about 2 p.m. through the next morning. I did retain 1 1/2 cups of its own liquid and it was delicious. (Anything over this size of meat, I would definitely double the rub ingredients but not the liquid.)  I heaped it on home-made mac & cheese, lightly mixed a bit of our favorite BBQ sauce in it and stuck it under the broiler about 5 mins. to heat and crisp up the sugars! 
IT WAS HEAVEN ON EARTH!!

Easy, delicious, and versatile. Love the hint of cumin! I used pork loin because that's what we keep on hand. I did not add the barbecue sauce back to the shredded meat but used the cooking juices instead. We added barbecue sauce when serving. Made quesadillas with some of the leftovers.

My pork roast was only 3.25 lbs, but I used the seasoning amount for a 5 lb roast.  I cooked for roughly 5.5 hrs and it fell apart as I removed it from the crockpot.  I did not use the bbq sauce at the end, instead I mixed in some of the cooking liquid. No idea how much, just until it looked really moist.  Personally I thought this needed a touch of liquid smoke and more heat (so I would give it four stars), but my family devoured it, said to rate it 10 stars  and threatened to revolt if I make changes. I served it on butter toasted sliders with Cilantro Cole Slaw (from AR) and regular sweet Cole Slaw.  Those that prefer sweeter meats liked it best with the sweet Cole Slaw, but others (who like savory better), preferred the Cilantro Cole Slaw.

holy  y’all!!! That was seriously the best pulled pork I have ever made at home! It rivals my favorite restaurant! I took the tip of liquid smoke but everything else was according to this recipe. I served it on a hamburger bun with fresh homemade coleslaw. I have marked this as a favorite!!

I made this exactly as written, using a mix of a local spicy BBQ sauce called Barron's  and Sweet Baby Ray's Original. It. was.  SO. GOOD! I'm making this one again.

No Christmas party is complete without this! I’ve had folks who “know Q” stop me and ask me what the secret is. I always tell them crock pot magic and lots of love. I do carefully handpick the meat, which takes about 30 minutes to do well (yes, I’m a vet at this)! The results are amazing whatever sauce you use (although I’m a sweet baby rays or jack Daniels gal).  Thanks for the great recipe, y’all!!!!

It's a keeper.. Although I didn't get to taste it since I always let my guests eat first.. by the time I got to the pot, it was all gone hence the 5 star review! I did only use a 3 lb. pork butt, but didn't change anything else.

I used pork tenderloin as others said it was easier to shred. I kept ? of the liquid and mixed the pork back in with it. I found the spicing to not be quite adequate even though I increased it already so next time I will use even more. My very first time making pulled anything was a celebrated success thanks to this recipe!

Made this today for my wife and me, she hasn't eaten pork since she was a kid (thinks pigs are too cute).  She loved it enough that she wants me to make it again.

If you're looking for a new pulled pork flavored with some heat, this is it.  My pork butt was 3.75 lbs. but I kept the seasonings the same.  Used Adobe for the seasoned salt.   I did pour out the cooking liquid but saved it and used it to when I wanted it wetter.  I didn't use BBQ sauce just more cooking liquid at the end.  My daughter just added BBQ sauce to hers as she ate it.  We all enjoyed it!

got to say its pretty good.  I'm from eastern NC where BBQ is a way of life.  Whereas a slow cooker will never compete with coals and smoked wood chips, this comes close.  I have made it twice for a crew of 7 on a tugboat.  it was devoured both times.  This is as close to a pig picking as you can get while using normal kitchen equipment.

Have made this several times as is. I let it sit on warm temp and let everyone graze! If it starts to get dry I just add a little bit of BBQ sauce.

Instead of water I used vegetable broth for a little more flavor and tweaked spices slightly. Next time I'd add more cayenne for more kick.

This was excellent. I added the BBQ sauce to part of it, and left the rest as it was. The only change I made was tripling the seasoning (except for the cayenne pepper) because I bought an 8 lb shoulder.  And I let it cook on low in the slow cooker for about 10 hours, until it was falling off the bone with almost no effort.

Very flavorful with a little bit of heat.  I chopped up fresh garlic and onion rather than the powder.  Partway through the cooking, rotate meat so the top half doesnt dry out.  Delicious!!

I had a 10 lb. bone in pork butt, so I doubled the rub recipe.  I also cooked it on low for 10 hours.   After removing & shredding the pork, I added some of the liquid back into the pork & bagged it.  We've been using the pork for barbecue sandwiches, in tortillas like carnitas pork, and it is good either way!   Good recipe for a slow cooker, pulled pork but I prefer the Green Egg smoker, just don't like the 16-20 hours of cooking time.

10 stars! I just bought my first slow cooker ever, I had absolutely no experience using one. I didn't had the powder in onion so I double the powder garlic and I used the recommended chicken broth instead of water. Every single member of my family loved this recipe :)

First pulled pork I have ever made.  Super easy and my whole family liked it.  My wife is often picky about her food in general and she love it!

I have been trying different pulled pork recipes for slow cookers. Finally! This is the one I am Saving! I made this for a pool party and it was great! What I like about this recipe is, it is easy and the spice combo is perfect.  In the end when I put the shredded pork back in, I used only half of the bbq sauce and chilled the cooking liquid. Then skimmed the fat from that and added SOME of it back in.
What I ended up with was flavorful pork. Not bbq sauce pork. So much better! THANKS

Never made pulled pork before so I thought I would give this a try based on the positive reviews.  It came out great!  Next time I'll probably cut back the cinnamon or eliminate it but apart from that it's perfect.

Doubled the rub ingredients because I used 8 lb pork shoulder roast. Turned out delicious. Served on buns with barbecue sauce, onions and pickles. Yum and easy.

Well, I should have doubled the recipe! Both of us wanted seconds of this easy & delicious meal. 	The pork was so tender I almost regretted having to shred it. Since my husband won’t eat cabbage, I substituted broccoli slaw for cole slaw; but I’m sure it would be equally good with regular slaw for cabbage lovers.  I cut pizza dough into circles, molded them over the underside of a muffin tin to make bowls, & filled the baked bowls with the pork & slaw. Looking forward to making this again.

Excellent recipe, thanks!  Next time (very soon) when we make it again, we'll double the bbq sauce to make it a bit gooey-er.  Thanks so much for the share!  Delicious.

I made it as described and added juices back in.  It had zing but not other flavor.  After a couple days in the fridge its zing was even gone.  Next time I will add double the spices as mentioned in other reviews.

So good and very tender, really easy to make and I  didn't change a thing, except I didn't drain out all the liquid like others have suggested. The grandkids went back for 2nd's and one of them said "you're a good cook grandma"

I omitted the sugar from the rub since I eat low carb and prefer to use the BBQ sauce on the side so I did not add the sauce to the pulled pork.

I used a 4 1/2 lb cut and set the crock pot on High for the first 4 hours, then changed it to Low for the remaining 3 hours. 

This came out so good!  It was super easy to pull apart after 7 hours. 

I saved the liquid from the crock pot and added back about half of it. The meat soaked it right up.

This recipe is a keeper and so easy to make. Thank you for posting it!

So I followed the directions to a T and after 8 hours on low my pork shoulder was no where ready to be shred. I had to cut it up and put it in a pot on be stove with the cooking liquids and the bbq sauce. Disappointed.

I made this for a picnic with family and everyone wants the recipe! The only change I made was I reserve some of the cooking liquid and mix it back in with the BBQ sauce. It looks like I will be making this for most family gatherings since it was such a hit!

This was delicious.  I used less easoned salt than called for but other than that,  I used the seasonings as listed in the ingredients list.  I did make and apply the rub the night before and let it sit in a freezer bag in the refrigerator over night. I cooked the pork for about six to seven hours.   As many suggested, after shredding the pork (I used pork loin) I returned it and some of the cooking juice to the crock pot.  I added a bottle of Sweet Baby Rays original BBQ sauce and allowed it to continue to cook on low for about an hour.

This was sooo good in every sense.  I made it exactly as instructed and it was excellent.  Got 5 stars from every family member.  Second it was very easy to make.  Started it in the morning, ready by dinner.  Third, with a coleslaw topping it seems like the perfect summer supper.  Thank you..

My crockpot was not big enough so I put it in the oven on low temp. about 200º F over night.  Then pulled and put in crockpot with bbq sauce to keep warm and serve. Everyone raved about how good it was. Will definitely make this again!

I wasnt sure about this, and when I tasted the meat after it was done, I did NOT like it ....BUT after I added BQ sauce (I use Sonnys) it was amazing!!  The flavors really worked together. Dont skip the sauce!! 

Only  change  I made was to leave out the ceyenne cos I dont like it and used chili powder instead.  Added few drops of liquid smoke too. I used a smalller roast and cut the ingredients a little...it makes a lot!

This is a good basic recipe. I made a lot and saved the liquid. I added more liquid  smoke, hot pepper flakes and vinegar, a little at a time to my taste. The other half I added barbecue  sauce. My family has different  taste. I gave it 4 stars because  I had to do so much adjusting to the flavor. I will be using it  again

I made this exactly as described, except that my roast was 7 lbs and I cooked it for 10 hours. It was delicious!  I used a set of turkey lifters to lift the pork out of the slow cooker when it was done, then used them to separate the fat from the meat and to pull the pork.  They worked way better than forks or fingers!  Served this with KFC copy-cat coleslaw (http://allrecipes.com/personal-recipe/62802949/kfc-copy-cat-coleslaw).

best pulled pork we've ever had. sweet with a great spicy, smokey flavor underneath. everyone went wild for it. keeper! doubled the spice (except cinnamon-personal preferences) as suggested by another reviewer.
