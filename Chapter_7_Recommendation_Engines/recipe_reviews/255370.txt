Although I'm far from Vegan this one still piqued my interest and I had all of the ingredients on hand. This turned out surprisingly good. I would definitely make this again. A can of Ro*Tel diced tomatoes and green chilies works best with this. For those of you that are not familiar with  nutritional yeast it is quite good on it's own and has somewhat of a cheesy flavor. Shh, don't tell my carnivore friends that the last two recipes I made were vegetarian and they were quite good.

For the 1.5 cups of salsa, i did 1C trader joes jarred red salsa and .5 cups of 505 Hatch green chile salsa. I also added another 1/4c of nutritional yeast with the salsa as I am a big fan.  Pretty spicy and very delicious.  Not only a really good dip but I see this as something to dress tacos or use as an enchilada sauce.  It's even good out of the fridge, not that I've stood there with a bag of chips eating it  with the fridge door open or anything...  I didn't have any margarine so I just used 2T olive oil.  I decreased the salt to .5t anticipating that the salsa would add plenty of salt and whatever I was eating this sauce on.

Really good!  My husband and I have recently starting eating a Vegan diet.  Cheese is one thing that I really miss. I am a cheese lover.  This recipe is really good and satisfies that queso craving.  I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I may add some finely chopped jalapeno.

Quite good! If you've never tried anything like this know it's not going to be just like cheese. But this was very tasty in our vegan nachos. I added about 1/4 cup of leftover vegan cheddar cheese shreds at the end but that probably didn't make too much flavor difference. Nice and easy!
