I made this the other evening for the family and although the flavor was excellent, the potatoes weren't done cooking even after an additional 15 minutes. Re-heated/cooked an additional 40 minutes the next day and they were still not done. It may have been the potatoes that I used (reds) and the flavor was good enough to give it one more go. This time, however, I think that I'll pre-cook the potatoes to prevent another disaster like the last one.

It takes a great recipe to inspire you to make a great dinner!

I made a couple of substitutions... I had Cheddar Cheese Soup & Turkey gravy in my pantry.

I also added to the chopped onion, a few stalks of chopped celery and a minced clove of garlic.

Followed the recipe and this was delicious!

I think the gravy really adds a very appealing flavor

This is by far the best recipe for Scalloped recipes.  I made my own chicken gravy(1 1/4cups of water, 2 chicken bouilon cubes and 1/2 c Flour) and I used about 5 c of Cheese and Turkey.   My husband loved it.  It was very cheesy and gooey.  MMM good.

Excellent recipe!  I modified mine a bit, though.  I didn't have any cream of celery soup or gravy, so I used a can of cream of chicken soup, and made my own gravy.  1 1/4 c. cold water, 1/2 c. flour, and 3 chick. bouillion cubes.  I arranged half of the potatoes in the bottom of a 9x13 pan, sprinkled 1/2 of the ham, and a few of the onions, and then topped with 1 c. cheese.  I repeated with the remainder of the potatoes and other ingredients, then topped with another cup of cheese and carefully poured the milk, gravy, soup mixture over all of it.  I covered and baked at 400 degrees for 30 min, then removed the foil and baked at 375 degrees for another 30 minutes.  HUGE HIT!!!

I loved this recipe!  I didn't have any chicken gravy and I was too lazy to make it by scratch so I just used cream of chicken soup and it was perfect!  Big hit with all the visitors.

I loved this recipe and my family came back for seconds. I substituted Campbells Cheddar soup for the gravy and it turned out spectacular!

Family favorite!  I use a can of Campbell's Cheddar Cheese Soup instead of the soup listed.  Freezes well and so yummy it keeps 'em asking for more!

This was something I did not care for. I used red onion. . which I use in everything but the color from the onion cooked out and It looked like slimy worms! ha. . The taste was a little bland as well. Next time, I'll use the ones from a box. They're much better! I also had a problem with the cooking time of the potatoes. I cut them very thin too. Probably won't try again . .

Made these last night and they were fabulous. Followed directions exactly and they turned out beautifully. Only had to make 1 change and I don't know how it affected the flavor. Couldn't find any chicken gravy, Campbell or otherwise, and had (?) to use cream of chicken soup. Like I said, I don't know how this affected the flavor but they were good to me. Reminded me of the ones my mom used to make when I was a kid. I think, though, because I had to use the chicken soup, I should have added more milk, maybe 1/2 cup. Definitely worth the trouble of peeling potatoes and the other preparations. Being a widower and living alone, I have to figure out how to half this recipe so I won't have so many leftovers.

This was just ok for me.  I don't think I'd make it again, but I think most people would like it - the gravy sort of threw me off a bit.  I prefer regular scalloped potatoes.  I needed to cook it about 20 minutes more to be sure all the potatoes were cooked through. Just be sure to use uniformly thin slices of potato.

I loved this!! It was so creamy with such a great taste! We like a lot of cheese so I did layer the cheese along with the other layers instead of just on the top. I will be making this as a dish to pass for the holidays!

I thought these were really good.  I used my food processor to slice up the potatoes so they were nice and thin.  I make exactly except I used the cheddar cheese soup instead.  I did cook covered an additional 15 minutes as the potatoes needed it.

This recipe turned out really good.  The only thing I would change is I would use 1 cup shredded cheddar between layers then cook as directed.  Then use the recommended 1 cup shredded cheddar on top as recipe directs.

This is a great recipe!  It was so simple and the whole family loved it.  It is a very "forgiving" recipe if you don't have the exact ingredients or if you want to change things up a bit.  I tweaked it just a little:  I made my own gravy since I didn't have any on hand; the only cream soup in my pantry was cream of potato so that is what I used; I sauteed the onions for a few minutes prior to building the casserole AND I went a little heavier on the cheese than called for.  Still, it is a GREAT basic recipe and the combination of flavors is delicious.  I think this is our new favorite comfort food!

Very yummy!  Loved how creamy it was with the gravy and soup mixture.  I did have to bake it 35 minutes longer than the recipe called for.

This was okay as written, but a bit too runny. I used the slicing side of my grater to get uniformly thin pieces and they were thoroughly cooked, but the taste was just average. If I make it again, I will definitely cut down on the liquid and add spices, perhaps some grated white pepper, oregano and garlic. With all the sodium in the recipe, I will not add any salt.  I will also use extra sharp cheddar or some other stronger tasting cheese.

The flavor of the finished product did not reflect it's ingredients. I often make scalloped potatoes & ham with better results & a lot less work, calories & sodium. Other reviewers were also spot-on by stating that additional time was needed to get the potatoes cooked...about 40-45 min. I wouldn't make it again.

I made this dish last Christmas for a family get-together.  It was a big hit and a few cousins asked for this recipe.  I substituted the chicken gravy with a can of Campbell's Cream of Chicken Soup.  Also, I didn't put as much diced ham as the recipe calls for.  I only added an 8oz. package and it was good.

This passed the test!  Everyone loved it!  We used leftover Christmas ham and it worked well.  I did add an additional 2 potatos to the batch and am glad I did. It would have been very moist without them.  I used a mandoline to cut all of the potatos in uniform slices so my dish cooked in the exact time as listed.  The only thing I would do different is dice my onions instead of chop...some of the onions were a little crunchy.  This will go into the keeper pile!  Enjoy!

My children and I made this today for Christmas dinner. Prep time was a little longer than 15 minutes per batch.  Substituted cream of asparagus for celery because that's all the only open market had.  Also used cream of chicken soup instead of gravy ( store supplies again!).  It turned out perfect in flavor, consistency and apperance.  Made double batch for about 14 people and it all dissapeared.  We'll definitely make it again and will also try the original recipe. ( Kids enjoyed helping as well and were very proud of their accomplishment!)

After reading all the reviews I tweaked this recipe considerably.  Thanks everyone for providing all the feedback since I used a combination of your tweaks and my own.  I myself used all Campbell products for the liquid portion:  Cream of Mushroom/w Roasted Garlic, Cheddar soup, and Chicken Broth.  I substituted the chicken broth for the milk this recipe called for because milk would have washed out some the flavor in my opinion.  I used a pound of hickory smoked bacon that I cooked on the stove top after cutting it into small pieces.  I diced half a yellow onion and added two cloves of fresh minced garlic. I used the side of a basic 4 sided shredder that does slices for cutting the potatoes.  I used approximately 8-10 of what I considered to be small potatoes.  After the first layer of potatoes were in the baking dish I put on top of this half the bacon, half of the sauce, all of the diced onion and garlic that had been sauteed and some shredded extra sharp cheddar.  Once the second layer of potatoes were added, whatever I had left was placed on top of that included more shredded cheese.  I covered the dish with aluminum foil and cooked for 1 hour at 400 degrees.  I then took the dish out and uncovered it, shredded a bit more cheese on top and placed it back in the oven for 30 minutes.  After the dish sat for close to 30 minutes it was perfect.  This is absolutely the best potato dish I have ever made.

Excellent scalloped potatoes & ham recipe!  Even better as leftovers.  I had only cream of chicken soup and only turkey gravy on hand so used those; I don't think it would matter much what you used.  Great way to use up leftover ham!

The kids went bonkers for this.   Only had enough for an 8x8 pan and everyone was mad that I didn't make more.  Subbed cream of celery for cream of mushroom and subbed ham for bacon.

I made this with coconut milk and the recipe tasted fine but was far too runny for my taste. Regular milk would probably work better or perhaps less or no milk at all. I would try again but tweak the recipe.

Great use of leftover ham! Followed recipe exactly, except I omitted the onion. Tasted great but I wouldn't call them "scalloped potatoes".

I would not recommend the cream of celery for this recipe. I made this tonight for Christmas dinner and my whole family agreed that the cream of celery was a mistake. It ruined the whole dish for me.  It was not terrible but not how I hoped it would taste. I will not make it again this way. Bummer.

Made this for the family, substituting 1 large can of Campbells cream of chicken soup for the cream of celery soup and chicken gravy as that was what I had on hand. There were no leftovers! Delicious!

Fantastic recipe...this one rivals (or even beats) my Mother's...the only change I made was mixing of all the ingredients together and spreading it out evenly in 2 layers. We've made it twice and it is guaranteed to bring the kids running to dinner!

Tasty, I used cream of chicken (because I had it laying around at the time), and I didn't cook ham in in (because that was the main dish).  Just remember to slice the potatoes thin enough to allow them to cook completely.

This was awesome! I did change it though based on the other reviews. I pre-boiled the sliced potatoes for seven minutes, I used cream of chicken soup and cheddar cheese soup instead of the soup suggested and gravy I added 3/4 cup of sour cream in addition to the one cup of milk and put one cup of cheddar cheese in the sauce mix in addition to the one cup of cheddar cheese sprinkled on top. I baked it 350 for 40 minutes and the family loved it??!!!!  I would definitely make this again?

It turned out awesome!  I did make some changes when it came to the ingredients.  I added crumbled hamburger meat instead of the ham and added corn too.  I did have to cook it a little longer because the potatoes weren’t soft enough but that wasn’t a big enough deal for me to not make it again.

COOKING TIME!!!
I am rating this two stars due to huge inaccuracy of cooking time. I sliced potatoes about 1/8" - 3/16" thick (mostly 1/8"). After more than an EXTRA 45 minutes in the oven, I would say the thicker ones were still "al dente," even though I upped the temperature to 385, and stirred them a couple of times. This delayed supper...making me stand around being annoyed.

I can't understand why these take so long. You can bake a potato in much less time. Very frustrating.

Flavor good...just plan on way more time. Also the ham pieces shrunk after cooking for so long. They could probably be added later to avoid this. And while I'm piling on, I don't understand the part about the layers. I cannot fathom why everything is not just mixed in a bowl and put into the casserole dish.

I cooked for a total of 1 hour 30 min as I do not have a mandolin. Also I used turkey gravy and cream of mushroom soup. Have made it twice now and it is incredibly difficult to screw up. Both times it was wonderful!

Awesome Flavor.  I did cook longer than stated, an hour with foil and 15 minutes without.  YUMMY!  The entire family had third helpings, and it was a great way to use up the leftover Christmas ham!  Thank you for posting such an easy but delicious recipe.  :-)

The potatoes were not thoroughly cooked. The consistency was fine, but bland. It had no flavor except for the onions. Needed salt and pepper. Next time I will cook longer. The potatoes were sliced very thin. Still were not cooked all the way.

The cooking time is way off on this recipe and for that reason I only gave this 3 stars. I gave it an extra 30 minutes and couldn't wait any longer to get to an Easter celebration. Flavor was nice, but not much is worse than undercooked potatoes at a party.

My husband doesn't like ham or potatoes but he loved this recipe. I didn't have any canned gravy and just made some out of bullion and it worked just fine. Also, I baked it during the day and put the cheese on last minute with just a quick reheat to make sure the potatoes were tender. This recipe could work well in a crockpot.

Very nice for using up leftover ham.  I used cream of mushroom (didn't have cream of celery) and added 1/4 t celery salt.  Also, used unpeeled red potatoes.  I used a hand slicer with "thick" setting blade, for taters and onion.  Cooking time was perfect. 

This is comfort food and was exactly what scalloped potato and ham should taste like.  Much of the flavor will come from your ham.  A "ham and water product" ham will be much less flavorful than a smoked ham or spiral cut, etc.

I made the homemade chicken gravy: 1 1/2 c. water, 2 chicken bouillon cubes, 1/2c. flour. I put an extra layer of cheese in the middle and doubled the ham. Baked it covered at 400 for 30 min then uncovered art 375 for 45 min. The hubby loved it!!

The flavor was good but I ended up cooking another 25 minutes because my potatoes were not done.  I used my mandolin so they were all the same size which was thin.  Will make again.

The soup, milk, and cheese combine into a nice cheese sauce. Really flavorful. I added green beans to round it off.

I didn't like the flavor of the chicken gravy/cream of celery mixture.  I thought the casserole ended up being bland despite the salt level in the full fat/full salt Campbell's soup and gravy I used.  I love a Campbell's soup casserole, and usually they are delicious, but this one fell flat.

I used a large can on cream of chicken soup instead of the two smaller cans (college student - anything to save costs is great!), and it turned out really well.  I was rushed for time, so I also turned the oven up to 400 degrees and it was fine with that - wish I would have taken the time to let the cheese crisp up though.  Very successful recipe!

This was a great easy meal.  First time I ever made scalloped potatoes. I'll never by those weird boxed versions again!

I took out the ham and replaced it with some bacon bits and then used one can of Cream of Mushroom and one can of Cream of Celery. I thought using some of the vegetarian bacon strips would be a good replacement also but I was out.

VERY GOOD! I substituted cream of celery with cream of mushroom and 1 cup of water with a chicken bullion cube because i did not have gravy and it was really good.  added salt and pepper. Also added about a cup of shredded cheddar and cooked a bit longer.

This was just wonderful!  I've been making scalloped potatoes all my life and this is now my go-to recipe.  I doubled the recipe, substituted cream of chicken soup for the gravy, threw in some red bell pepper, a couple of dashes of hot sauce and the sour cream someone else suggested.  Had no cheese, so left it out.  Used buttered bread crumbs instead.  It was still delicious.  Three of us went through an 11 x 15 pan in two days. 

I use my salad shooter to slice the potatoes and grate the cheese.  I don't know how anyone gets along without one of those things.

Other comments about baking time are correct.  Scalloped potatoes should not be crunchy or even al dente.  Allow at least an hour for baking and more if you double it.

Thank you, Campbell's!

Fantastic recipe.  I was looking for a homey, comfort food to accompany the highest rated slow cooker pot roast recipe also found on this site.  Because I was using it as a side dish I left out the ham and it was still amazing.  I used my mandoline to evenly and thinly slice both the potatoes and the onions so it cooked evenly and perfectly.  As many stated, it tasted even better the second day and my 16 year old boy literally licked his plate.  This will be a regular meal in our house.

My family absolutely loved this. They ate it for breakfast the next day.  I added another cup of cheese and instead of using just cheddar, I used marble cheese (monterey and cheddar) it tasted really "ono" ("good" in hawaiian).

I added chopped celery and used turkey gravy instead of chicken also used american cheese instead of what is called for. That all went very well but recipe turned out a little too moiste for my taste. Next time I make it I'll decrease the milk, or omite it all together. Baked it for an hour before I put the cheese on which browned very nicely.

This is a very good rendition of scalloped potatoes.  I followed the recipe, but my potatoes still came out undercooked, so next time I will raise my oven temperature and cook a little longer.  Still liked the taste and texture of cooking these instead of buying a box mix.

We thought this was very good. I had 'cream of celery' soup, but not the chicken gravy. So I used 1\2 and 1\2 and a packet of 'chicken gravy mix' with the cream of celery. I used two extra potatoes. [I really don't think that made a difference.] I cooked it for the time stated and it was perfectly done and very creamy. Will make again, very easy.
