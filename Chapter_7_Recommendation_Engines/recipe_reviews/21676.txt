Exactly like the Hummingbirds in Jamaica. Hint: for the Strawberry syrup, you can use one found with the pancake syrups.

This is the real deal, a true Jamaican Hummingbird.  And believe me, I know.  I had asked every bartender down there for the recipe, and this is it.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I honeymooned in Jamaica 9 years ago.  We fell in love with these, and lost the paper one of the bartenders wrote the recipe on!  I was soooo excited to find this.  It's exactly the same!!!  thank you so much!

This drink was so yummy it tasted like a cross between a milk shake and a smoothie---but be careful the liquor will sneak up on you.

I've searched and searched for this recipe and was DELIGHTED when I found it here.  I was even happier because they taste just like the ones we had on our honeymoon in Negril.  Yum--- this is my husbands favorite sweet drink.

Rum Cream has been very hard to find in the states, but Cruzan just started making their own version of Jamacian Rum Cream.  It tastes just like the stuff we all remember from our honeymoons! WAHOOO!!

Exactly like the ones we had in the Bahamas on our honeymoon. One difference, instead of rum cream liquor they just used Bacardi rum, you can use a flavored version for extra fruity taste.  We like to add more banana to the mix.  Love them, perfect for hot summer days or pool parties.

I'm on the fence about this one. This has got to be one of the most interesting cocktails I've ever had. I made no substitutions, I had to use half of a FROZEN banana only because I had no ice. Different. Very different.

I drank a lot of these in Negril in 2005 and never thought to search for the recipe… until now.  It was blistering hot here today, so I ran out and got the ingredients (found rum cream easily and used Nesquik strawberry syrup) and on my first sip was quickly taken back to the beach, listening to reggae and always having someone nearby to remind me it was “no problem”.  My husband agrees.  I finally became a member to tell you how good this recipe is.

Very good! Had trouble locating cream liqueur, so used coconut rum. Assume when I find the cream liqueur it'll be 5 Stars! What about cream or Half & Half, or some such, instead of the milk?

For those that may not know, Tia Maria is the preferred coffee flavored liqueur used !  We always bring home a couple of bottle of Jamaican rum cream each year when we go.  Cruzan is a Puerto Rican rum and just not the same as Jamaican Rum ( cream or otherwise!! )

HAVE NOT TRIED THIS RECIPE YET, BUT IT SEEMS TO BE THE EXACT INGREDIENTS I ENJOYED IN JAMAICA EVERYDAY LAST WEEK.  :). I TOO PURCHASED THE RUM CREAM WHILE IN JAMAICA, WAS NOT A FAN OF COFFEE LIQUEUR SO I ALWAYS HAD THEM TO OMIT, BUT I AM GOING TO TRY MAKING IT WITH AMARETTO.  NEED TO PURCHASE THE SYRUP AND BANANA AND I WILL REPORT BACK MY FINDING.  ONE OTHER THING, IN JAMAICA MY BARTENDER GREGORY WHO SAID HIS GRANDFATHER WAS THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS DRINK ALSO ADDS TWO DARK RUMS AND ONE LIGHT RUM TO THE MIX(POTENT0 BUT YOU DON'T TASTE THE LIQUOR AT ALL!

This is it.. like Montego Bay!  :)  We don't like the coffee flavor as much, so we use amaretto.  Sometimes I also use 1 oz strawberry liqueur in place of the strawberry syrup for a little more kick, and a little less strawberry flavor, but that's less authentic.  BTW, to those making this with rum.. definitely not the same...  We bring lots of rum creme back from jamaica, but Cruzan now distributes a rum creme in the US now, I have a bottle, but haven't run out of Sangster's yet.. :)  I'll update when I do..

I could not find any rum cream, so used straight rum.  This did not taste at all like the Hummingbird I drank often at Breezes Runaway Bay, and I don't think its because of what I substituted (rum for rum cream).

What I did do, since I tasted the coffee liqueur, is I added another ounce of milk, and another ounce of strawberry flavored syrup.  THAT tasted more like the drink I had, though it wasn't the same color (mine was brownish instead of pink).

So this is a nice recipe, but I had to modify it a little.

HAVING BEEN TO JAMAICA 3 TIMES, THIS IS OUR FIRST DRINK REQUEST EVERY TIME. IT IS EXCELLENT!! I PUT ONLY 1/2 OUNCE OF THE COFFEE LIQUER IN, BUT STILL GREAT!!
LAST TIME THERE, I BOUGHT THE COCONUT RUM CREAM AND THERE'S HARDLY ANY DIFFERENCE. STILL TERRIFIC! FILLING BUT A GREAT DESSERT DRINK!!

I`ve already rated this recipe. I made it with white rum, but now I made it with Rum Cream liqueur. I bought it in Dominican Republic and really fell in love with its taste. The cocktail is extremely good, not strong at all, the ingredients perfectly compliment each other. Using rum, the taste will be a little different, but good.

Exactly as I remember! Although it seems to be hard to find true Rum Cream, it's well worth the search. This drink is absolutely YUMMY!
I have even substituted Banana Liqueur for the little extra kick.

I had this drink years ago when I was in Jamaica at the Grand Lido Braco. We drank these all week right up until the bus was there to take us to the airport(the bus was late so we were able to sneak in one more). For strawberry sauce I use grenadine syrup available at most grocery stores. Here's to Jamaica!

This was awesome.  Had no problem finding the rum cream liqueur.  Just ask at any larger store. Can't wait to try them again, who needs to go to Jamaica if you can make these at home. WOW!!!!   Thanks for sharing.

This was pretty good, except it's extremely difficult to find rum cream in the US.  We get ours when we travel to Canada.  (Sangster's is exported there)  I haven't seen any in the midwest yet.  This recipe did remind me of Negril though, very yummy!

I went to Negril a year ago and I asked the bartender for something sweet but different. He made me this and a Purple Rain. I couldn't find anyone here in the States who knew what a hummingbird was and all I have to say is THANK YOU!!! Now I can make this wonderful drink at home!! The recipe is exact too!

FABULOUS! I used gold rum and half & half in place of the rum cream liqueor and milk. I added a little extra syrup and kahlua. It seems like a strange combination, but ohhhh.... they were yummy.

What a fun and unexpected combinations of ingredients that came together in a way I totally did not expect.  I had some strawberry liquor I used instead of a syrup.  It's like a grownup milkshake that's great on a warm afternoon.

I followed the recipe exactly and the ladies I made it for loved it.   It's a really nice thick consistency.   Perfect for those beach chair days.

Nice flavor, a little too sweet with too little of a kick for my taste. For all of you saying that you cannot find Rum cream it's basically RumChata which is an excellent substitute.

This recipe definitely makes me want to go to Jamaica! I used Rum Chata cream rum. It was pretty easy to find. This is a must try!
