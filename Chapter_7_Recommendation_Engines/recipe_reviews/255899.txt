One of the best chicken recipes I have ever made. The cheese and onions give such an amazing complete flavor to the chicken. If I were to do anything different it would only be to make more onions for serving. Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious! I love the Gouda with the caramelized onions. My boyfriend thought it tasted like a twist on Chicken Cordon Bleu. I will definitely make this again!

Fantastic recipe, thanks so much! The caramelized onions and gouda cheese made this taste phenomenal. I used garlic seasoned panko bread crumbs and the flavors blended together perfectly.

Delicious! Mine took a bit longer to bake (more like 40 minutes). For the coating, I used what I had on hand, which was a bit of Italian bread crumbs mixed with a bit of panko, to which I added a sprinkle of garlic powder to. They turned out so good! I served this with a side of pasta with mushrooms and peas. Yum!

I followed the recipe with the exception of the coating, and for that I used panko crumbs, some of Semigourmet's chicken rub from this site, and a few handfuls of the crispy fried onions that come from Costco--but I'm sure any coating, including the recipe suggestion, would be just fine.  Next time I will liberally salt and pepper the chicken before adding the cheese and onions.   The onions can be prepared way ahead of time, making this an even easier meal to prepare on a busy evening.  Just don't leave them out!  Yum!  This will appear on our dinner plates once again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really wonderful. Definitely something different. The onions and cheese had such rich flavor! The only thing I would do differently is to make my own breading, probably with panko and some dried herbs & seasoning.

Rather than splitting the breasts, I cut them in half, marinaded them in Italian dressing for an hour, used Shake and Bake and sandwiched the carmelized onions (which I added some balsamic vinegar) with the gouda.  Amazing mix of flavors!

It is delicious, I skipped the seasoned coating and just sprinkled a little salt and pepper on top with some freshly chopped oregano. I know its not much but this makes it gluten free. I also basted it half way through. A little garlic butter rice topped with some fresh chopped basil and green beans - I definitely hurt myself last night.

These were so darned delicious. I used large chicken breasts and flattened them just a bit so that I could get more stuffing in them. Instead of plain gouda I used the smoked  which paired very well with the caramelized onions. I made extra onions because of the larger breast halves and the last 10 mins of cooking I added 2 cloves of garlic run through a rasp and 1/4 cup of white wine. I used my own seasoned bread crumb mix. Obviously we had left overs the next night. These are definitely a keeper.

Delicious!  Only change I made was to make my own bread crumbs.  Definitely a new favorite.

I made the recipe as stated, except used Panko for "seasoned coating mix for chicken" (what is that?) and smoked gouda instead of regular since I like smoked Gouda. My husband thought it was amazing. I enjoyed that it was really easy to make.
