I got great reviews on this recipe.  I made a couple substitutions though - I used Cream of Mushroom soup instead of Cream of Chicken (I'm not sure why all these recipes call for Cream of Chicken - it really doesn't make culinary sense) and since I didn't have any ham prepared, I just used 2 cups of crushed bacon.  I also pretty much doubled the cheese called for an put it all together in a larger pan (probably 11 x 15)  As for mixing the ingredients together and 'pouring' over the eggs... you more or less have to spread it over the eggs - it's not a real pourable mixture.  I think next time I might just mix the eggs in - would have about the same results.  Additionally, an entire 1/4 cup of melted butter isn't needed - this is just too much butter.  Just melt enough butter to douse the top with.

This was a hit at a breakfast we had at work! I did tweak it based on the recommendations of others. I added some salt and red pepper. I also used sausage instead of ham, cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, I added 6 eggs and mixed them in with all the other ingrediants. I also cooked the hasbrowns beforehand and I added green peppers and onions to it. I left out the butter and used shredded cheddar cheese on top instead. I used 8 oz of sour cream instead of 16. Will definitely use again.

Very good but changed it a tad. I reduced the sour cream by half, and mixed the beaten eggs with the soup and sour cream.  I chopped some red/green bell peppers and mixed them into the hashbrowns.  Then, I poured the soup/egg mixture over the hashbrowns/peppers until coated. Baked a little longer than called for and the result was great.  Served with "Orange Glorious" beverage recipe also found on this site and the combo was wonderful! I think sausage may also be a good addition for next time and call me crazy, but maybe even a DASH of cayenne pepper into the soup mix for some kick.  Thanks!

Good flavor, but the overall consistency was too runny.  Next time I will cut the sour cream in half and omit the butter.  Also, I used potatoes o'brien (w/onion & peppers) instead of regular hash browns.

Made this with 10 eggs, no butter, 8 oz. shredded sharp cheddar and only 8 oz. light sour cream. Added salt, garlic powder, and a little crushed red pepper flakes and baked for 1 hour. Makes a very thick casserole! I cut it into about 12 pieces. My daughter and I (we're the only breakfast casserole people in our house) loved it.

I thought this turned out excellent.  I wasn't sure whether to use shredded hash browns or the country style hash browns, but I went with the country style.  It made it very hearty and filling.  I cut down on the butter as recommended by others but think it could be eliminated completely -- it never crusted over for me. I'd just sprinkle some extra chesse on top. Next time I probably would also add a couple more eggs to even out the proportion of eggs to potatoes.

Here's what I did to make this into a FIVE-STAR FAMILY FAVORITE:  Substitute ham with 1# Roll Jimmy Dean Hot Pork Sausage brown with Onion and also add small Green Pepper.  Layer hashbrowns first. Increase eggs to 8, beat with a little milk, salt & pepper and pour over hashbrowns. Mix Cream of MUSHROOM soup (not chicken soup), with ONLY 8 oz of sour cream also adding a little milk (approx 1/4 cup).  Add the browned sausage mixture along with approx 1/2 cup cheese and layer this mixture over Hashbrown and Eggs.  Cook 30 minutes.  Omit butter entirely but add approx 1/4 cup cheese to top then return to oven for 15 minutes.  Let set approx 10 minutes to meld prior to serving.

This was one of the greatest casserole's i've ever made. I made it for my family on Christmas Morning, but i changed it a little. Instead of using ham, i used ground up sausage and some bacon, and it still turned out great. I used a lot more cheese as well. I recomend cookikng the eggs, bacon, and sausage a little before throwing it all together in the oven though. Also, use more eggs than the recipe calls for...otherwise it's out of proportion. casseroles sohuld be bassed on potatoes and eggs.

Well, this was a REAL hit with the whole family on Christmas morning.  I made 2 9x13 casserole's the night before and just popped them in the oven before we started with the morning. They were both gone in no time!  We had fresh fruit and juice to round out the morning.  Thank you for the great recipe!  The only change I made was to use sausage instead of ham and I used about twice the amount of cheese. Very good!!

This recipe was fabulous!  This recipe certainly impressed our out of town guests and my husband too! The only change I made was to add another cup of cheese and some garlic powder and also I broiled it at the end to make the top crunchy!  It's a winner!!!

Let me explain why I picked this recipe.  I have a Hashbrown Casserole recipe that is similar and my husband loves it.  He has a thing about casseroles...I guess, growing up, he never really had any good ones so he says he doesn't like casseroles.  Yet, just about every one I've ever made he likes or flat out loves.  So, I thought that he would like this recipe since it's similar to the hashbrown casserole, but he didn't.  Well, he said it was "alright."  He's just wierd, I guess.  I love this casserole though.  It was very tasty and very filling.  I used a 12 oz. package of Hormel diced ham (which I found at Target), cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, and more cheese than the recipe called for, probably close to 2 cups.  The top crust didn't turn out, so I probably will not use the butter next time.  I don't know why I would need it anyway.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I will use this again, but with these changes: 6 eggs...half the sour cream...no butter...Potatoes O'Brien (onions and peppers added) and PREBROWN THEM for much more taste. I was pressed for time, so I sprinkled the potatoes generously with instant minced onion, and I just may do that again. I prepared with all the above changes, except I wished I prebrowned the potatoes; they were just blah. I also mixed the eggs into the soup mixture...too nervous to put them on the bottom! A generous pinch of cayenne would brighten it up too =) Made this along with Make-Ahead Breakfast Casserole (see my Jan.18 review), and this went first with the kids.

I did not care for this recipe.  It was mostly potatoes even with adding 3 extra eggs, should have been called potato casserole.  Not one of us enjoyed it.

Great, always get compliments!
I made the following changes:
-8 oz of sour cream
-2 cups of cheddar cheese
-2 packages of brown and serve sausage
-country style hash browns
-5-6 eggs
-one sleeve of ritz crackers mixed with 1/4 cup of melted butter and sprinkled on top of casserole for a nice crust
****if you make the night b4, refrig. and add ritz/butter combo right before you put in oven****

This is a very hearty breakfast casserole and it tastes DELICIOUS! I made it with 8 eggs and I used 2 lbs. of ground turkey sausage (cooked) and added sauteed onions and green peppers. I also did what others recommended and just added some shredded cheddar on the top instead of the butter. It was soooo good. My whole family loved it. It makes more than you think it will. It made plenty enough for my husband and 3 teenagers plus me.  I had also made Aunt Anne's Coffee Cake to go with it which I found on AllRecipes as well.   This will certainly be one of my regular recipes for the weekends!   Also - this could definently be mixed up ahead of time and then just popped in the oven in the morning.

Didn't like this at all. I let it cook longer, trying to get it to set up, but it didn't. It was mushy and very heavy. Almost like an egg pudding. Lacked a bit of fresh flavor.

Yummy! Made for Christmas Day breakfast. I scaled down the sour cream to 8 oz and used dried chopped onions and onion powder. I mixed everything together the night before except for the eggs. The next morning I poured the refrigerated mixture over six beaten eggs and baked. Next time I will try chopped bacon instead of cubed ham.

This was very good.  I did tweak it a little though.  I cut the sour cream by about 1/2 cup, used cream of potato soup, added 1/3 cup cream cheese, some cilantro and finely chopped jalapeno and doubled the eggs.  I sauteed the onion and 1/4 cup yellow bell pepper in 1 tbsp. butter and mixed it all together instead of putting the eggs on the bottom. Also I sprinkled with sharp cheddar cheese instead of drizzling butter over the top.  Next time I may try pepper jack cheese.  I served it with fresh salsa for a western flair and it was fantastic.  Since the recipe made more than I needed, I placed it in two 9x9 pans, baked one and put one in the freezer.  I agree with others that you could use sausage or bacon. Good recipe.  I will be making this again.

This recipe was a hit! Since my husband is watching his weight I decided to warp this recipe too. I used an 8 ounce container of Fat Free sour cream instead of the 10 oz, used the reduced fat cream of mushroom soup instead of regular chicken, used eag beaters instead of whole eggs, fat free cheddar cheese instead of regular, I also used reduced fat suasage instead of the ham and sauteed the onion with it, I also sprinkled some garlic powder on it while I was cooking it. I mixed all of the ingredients together and sprinkled a bit more cheese on top for an extra 20 minutes to get that gloden brown look. No one knew the difference! I plan on making this for Easter brunch.
Thanks!

Add a ton more pepper if prefer more flavor. Definitely comfort food or good hangover recovery breakfast.  To give you an idea, I made these while some friends were crashed out on a sleeper sofa in the next room.  I took it out of the oven, left it on the counter to cool and went back to bed.  When I got back up, both of them were hunched over it, eating it right out of the pan with spoons, and groaning with pleasure.

This is not a 4.5 star recipe...I wish it was because I wanted it to be great...it just missed the mark.  I tried the recipe just as described and received mediocre reviews. My boyfriend barely ate one small helping and he always has seconds of everything that I cook.  It was very bland and the sour cream didn't seem to help with the unappealing flavor.  The concept of this receipe is great...but it needs considerable work.  Some spices would definitely help and less sour cream would be recommended.  I would suggest also adding an onion soup mix to the mixture for extra flavor or garlic powder.  3/4 a cup of cheese is also not nearly enough for this size casserole.  I would increase to 1 cup in the mixture as well as at least a 1/2 cup on top. Also a 30 minute cook time is not long enough...the potatoes will not be soft.  I cooked mine for 50 minutes before they were soft enough and had to cover the dish about half way through to keep from getting too brown on top.  I will try this again but with various changes...I do not recommend this recipe the way it was written.  Make your own variation

This was fantastic! A few changes...I used a package of turkey bacon instead of ham. I chopped it up and cooked it in a pan. I added the chopped onion and some chopped pepper to the bacon and cooked for a few minutes. I also didn't use a whole 2 lbs of the hash browns but probably 1 2/3 of the 2 lb bag. And I didn't have cream of mushroom so I used cream of potato. I also added 1/4 cup fat free half and half. It was so yummy! Everyone loved it...even my super picky husband! Thanks for the recipe!!!

My husband and I made this to take over to my family for our first Christmas breakfast.  We got good reviews but no one raved about it.  When we were making it, the 9x13 baking dish was too small so we used an 11x15 and added 2 extra eggs and some more ham.  We also sprinkled extra cheese on the top which made it look very pretty.  We will definately make this again b/c you can't beat the easy factor :)

Like a lot of the other reviewers, I made some mods to this one and it turned out great.  Used Potatoes O'Brien (pre browned), 8 eggs, 8 oz sour cream, doubled the cheese, added some milk and garlic powder and omitted the butter and onions.  I mixed the soup, milk, eggs, and sour cream together and seasoned with a ground peppercorn medley and garlic powder.  I layered the potatoes, cheese, then the meat in the pan.  I poured the egg and soup mixture over the other ingredients and topped with more cheese.  Very hearty and I didn't have any left over to take home with me after serving it at church for breakfast.  I prepared it the night before and just popped it in the oven for an hour Sunday morning.  Easy!
EDIT to add: I tried the same exact recipe with 9 eggs instead of 8 and it held together better when serving.

I made this for a food day at work, took a couple suggestions from prior chefs :)

I used 10 large eggs
2lb package of bacon
1 package of 6 beef sausage franks

I don't like ham so I used the bacon and sausage to replace. I mixed all the liquids together, it was easiest.

Everyone loved it, people were coming from other sections to get some since the word spread it was incredible :) Thanks, will be making for the next breakfast-themed food day!!

This recipe was perfect! Just what we were looking for. I did add 2 more eggs than it called for. The cooking time was just about 1 hour.

This was an awesome recipe, I made a few modifications, 6 eggs, added a combination of steak, bacon & ham to equal 2 cups and used pizza blend cheese and additional cheese on top after I took it out of the oven.

A very good and hearty casserole. Made this with minor changes. I used 6 eggs, about 1-1/2 lbs hash browns (that was plenty), and subbed cream of celery for the cream of chicken. I also used more cheese. I did use the 1/4 cup of butter but I don't think that was totally needed. I'll either cut it out or cut it down by 1/2, at least, next time. This would be really good, also, with chopped broccoli or broccoli florets, lightly steamed first. Will make this again.

For this one you really do need to mix the ingredients in a separate large bowl first (including the eggs) then pour it in. Also I listened to others and did more eggs, and less sour cream. The result wasn't great. I'd still do more eggs and the same amount of sour cream as suggested. Also make sure you cut the onions up small. Overall this was just okay, I didn't love it and it took a long time to make/bake.

I've served this several times to guests and always get compliments.  I use Ore Ida O'Brien hashbrowns because they already have green peppers and onions, so I eliminate the onion in the original recipe.  I also use Hormel Real Bacon Bits sometimes instead of chopped ham and it is equally good.  I also add 6 eggs instead of 3.

I really enjoyed this recipe - so did my husband and his buddy who stayed overnight with us. I, too, used (hot) sausage instead of ham, used about 10 ozs of sour cream, cream of mushroom soup, and substituted dried chopped onion for the real thing. Added Italian seasoning, a dash of cayenne pepper and garlic salt for extra taste - topped with cheese. Very tasty!

Very good breakfast for a group.  We recently served it alongside French Toast and juices, and everyone wanted the recipe (and went back for more).  Add more ham or cheese to your liking.  I use lowfat soups and sour cream with no sacrifice to the taste.  Good stuff!

This is so awesome and easy!!!  I double the eggs to 6 though and use cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken. Once I forgot to buy sour cream so I substituted 8 oz cream cheese whipped with 4 Tbsp milk. You couldn't tell the difference.  I use 3 small bags of real bacon bits for the meat.   A whole meal in one dish!!  Great with orange juice!

My husband LOVES this. I made one change and used Cream of Mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken as another reviewer recommended. Delicious!   I've used ham many times, and other times I've used Bacon, or sausage and each time it comes out good. Great easy breakfast meal when company is visiting. I've also frozen portions for my husband who leaves very early for work, and my husband says it still tastes great after he microwaves it.

Although very tasty, a lot needed to be altered to make the right consistency.  Definitely took the advice of other reviews and cut the sour cream down to half. I used cream of mushroom soup (which could also have been cut to half) and added about 1/4 cup flour to the mix to thicken.  I added in some of my own veggies to spruce the dish up and the cook time was 2 hours at 350.  Hope this helps others and thanks for the original recipe to build on.

My family loves this casserole.  I love to make it when family comes and for Christmas morning.  I did add some more eggs and poured it over the hashbrown mixture. Make sure you bake it a little longer.  I also like adding sliced red bell pepper.  It is tasty and adds some holiday cheer. Great for a crowd.

This was great, better than i expected since im not an egg person. My husband was fighting this all the way he was headed to chickfila till he realized it was too late for their breakfast! He however decided that this is the best way to have eggs and the only way they should be cooked from now on! lol.  I used about 8 eggs,(they were bantam eggs though) 1/2 cup of mozerela(msp) and a pinch of chedder(since that was what was left from spegheti and taco night) 1 ham steak diced up 1/4 of onion 1 large potato wich i pelled and then used the veggie peeler to slice up. 2TBS of sour cream(this was something i didnt know went in egg casserole and this was all that was left from taco night) I added turkey bacon wich i diced and browned up b4. i personaly wouldnt leave this out. I did use the cream of chicken and love it, the only thing i would consider using instead is mabye cream of potato, (or brocceli if i was adding some spinach and peppers). Liberal amounts of black and white peppers, garlic salt with parsely, and a smoky sesoning blend.  Over all im glad i looked up a recipe b4 trying to through 1 together and i belive the way i cooked it it came out great! I baked it for 30mins. Then added about tbs of melted butter on top then i put on the convection seting and baked it another 15 mins. Let it stand about 8 b4 cutting into it and it was perfect crunchy top just slightly loser then custard texture. Amazeing!

Good but a bit on the bland side, nothing a little hot sauce won't cure.  I pretty much followed the mods from other reviewers, less sour cream, more eggs and cheese, poured the egg mixture over the potatoes and ham.

Served this at a Bunco party to 16 ladies and they loved it!  This is one my most favorite breakfast casseroles I have had and it is well rounded for any age group.  My seven year old loved it as well!

This is a great dish just out of the oven and just as good reheated on busy mornings!  I used 1 lb. cooked sausage in place of the ham, added 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, 6 eggs and substituted cream of mushroom for the cream of chicken soup.  I spread the hashbrowns in a 9 x 13 and bake them for 15 minutes while I cooked the sausage.  I mixed all the other ingredients together and poured it over the top of the hashbrowns.  I stirred it a little to incorporate the mix into the hashbrowns.  I dotted the top with butter instead of pouring melted butter over the top.  About 10-15 minutes before it was done I sprinkled shredded mild cheddar on half for the kids and shredded pepper jack on the other half for a nice kick.  I will definitely make this again... it's a hearty morning breakfast!

This was good. I did make some alterations. I cooked the potatoes with onions and green pepper first. Then, I cooked regular hash browns and put salt, pepper, and parmesan cheese. Then I mixed fat free sour cream, fat free cream of mushroom, and substituted eggsbeaters southern for the eggs. And it turned out good. Next time, I think I will season the potatoes a little more. I hope this helped for people who wanted a less fat version of this.

Very good tasting.  I used cooked ground sausage instead as I love sausage in my casserole.  I also used an additional egg.  I also used more cheese.  I figured with all the wonderful ingredients that were already in there why skimp on the cheese.  I used the shredded hashbrowns, and I made sure they were well drained when I thawed them out.  They worked very well.  Once I put the egg in the pan I then put "plops" of the hashbrown mixture all over.  This mixture did NOT pour.  It was very thick and I wanted my eggs evenly distributed on the bottom.  It was well received Christmas morning.  I will make again.  Easy!

extremely tasty but never cooked up right--1 hour is NOT long enough. also didn't understand the eggs on the bottom...they crusted up nicely but thought that was a strange direction.

I made this last night for dinner, with all the butter.  It was very good except I thought the butter was a little much.  I made it again this morning for a work carry-in, without the butter.  So far out of all the dishes mine is getting the best reviews.  I also added a pinch of salt and some garlic powder.  The ingredients sound weird, but this is very tasty!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe for Easter brunch and have to say I was a little dissapointed. It was good but not great. I followed another reviews advice and used an 11X15 pan. I also added an extra cup of cheese. Next time I will use spicy sausage and mushroom soup in place of the cream of chicken.

I have been making this for years! My friends love it!! It's easy to make in advance and to reheat the next day. I use cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken and I add more veggies like mushrooms and squash. If I don't have ham, I use sausage. The recipe is quite versatile. It's also great as a vegetarian dish too!

Made this for Christmas morning breakfast.  Very quick to put together.
My changes:  used the "fresh" hash browns in the refrigerator section, doubled the eggs, halved the sour cream, and added 2 c. crushed corn flakes to the butter for topping.
Big hit!!  Thanks!!

Like so many others, I cut the sour cream by half and used the O'Brien Potatoes. My boyfriend and I couldn't tell there was eggs in the dish - I think you could ALMOST pass this off as a hotdish - but it was still very good. Thnx!

I served this yummy recipe Christmas morning, absolutely everyone LOVED it!  It's hard to please 10 people, but all I heard was how wonderful it tastes...this is our new tradition!  I didn't change anything in the recipe, it's perfect just the way it is!

This dish was a big hit with brunch guests.  I usually try out a new recipe before deciding to serve to friends, but my schedule was too busy for that.  After reading the reviews,I was a bit nervous.  I cut back on the sour cream by about half.  It was very good.  I will keep this one and use again and again.

I thought this was good, a little soupy. Guess it should set before serving. Husband suggested using half the amount of sour cream (he's not a big sour cream fan). Definitely worth a try.

I think that adding the melted butter to the top made the casserole too mushy, but it is possible that my soup/sour cream portions were off.

I forgot to mix the cheese in before I put it in the pan so I simply threw it on top for the last 15 minutes.  Turned out great and I loved the cheesy crust on top.

Absolutely delicious!  I stuck to the basic recipe and gave it a Southwesty flavor with 4oz chopped green chilis and 2 dashes of Louisiana Hot Sauce.  I didn't have an onion so I used 1/2 tsp onion powder.  Will definitely make again!

This casserole is very tasty. I didn't give it 5 stars, however, because it struck me as more of a "potato" casserole than a breakfast casserole. I think more egg, less potato would make it more "breakfast" like. I will make this again, but maybe tweak it a little.

My husband thought this casserole was sensational. I used 2 pkgs of Alexia thick cut parmesan potatoes, but I would cut it to one next time or use actual hash browns. That's all I had in my freezer when I decided at the last minute to make this. Seems very versatile and is impressive as noted. The chicken soup is okay. I prefer cream of mushroom, but many people prefer anything but mushroom (my husband). Doubled the eggs as noted and that was good since they may not have been seen otherwise. I also threw everything in together as noted in other reviews. Cut the sour cream in half and it was fine. We think this recipe might be tasty at any time of the day.

This did not work out for me at all. I did not tweak the recipe, and probably should have. It was very runny and the butter was way too much. The potatoes would not cook all the way through. I think the sour cream was too much also. I even put it back in the oven at 375 and cooked an additional 15 minutes.

Great recipe, made it for breakfast Christmas morning.  Some changes: I used 8 eggs instead of 3, and I used only half of the sour cream (8 ounces).  I also added some garlic powder and dry mustard to the eggs.  I mixed everything but the eggs together, spread in the baking dish, then poured the seasoned beaten eggs on top.  After 40 minutes, I sprinkled on some shredded cheese instead of butter, and put it back in for 10-15 minutes.  Yum!

My husband and company raved about this receipe, I not so much. I doubled the ham and eggs and doubled the cooking time.  Don't think I'd make this again unless I have a party with other food to add to this meal.

This was Amazing! I tagged along with everyone else on adding more eggs I did five but most likely Ill do eight next time. I also cooked it with bacon instead of sausage and everyone loved it. I would say if you are going to cook with bacon cook it first and drain the oil dont put it in the casserole because more grease will cook out in the oven. But It was AMAZING! Our church group ate it up!

I made a couple of changes to this dish as suggested by others and also to avoid permanent damage to my arteries. (Reduced the sour cream by half and used a fat-free version, increased the number off eggs to 6, subbed veggie sausage for the ham, used reduced-fat cheese.) My biggest problem with it wasn't the flavor, which was decent (added some Mrs. Dash Extra Spicy), but I was not a fan of the texture. Even with less liquid ingredients and baking for an hour, it was still too mushy. Never firmed up like I expected it to. Maybe it would have been improved by cooking the hashbrowns to a crispy consistent before baking. I may or may not try it again, as I have a really good go-to breakfast casserole recipe that I will probably stick with from now on. Not a bad recipe, but not 4.5 stars, either.

I don't usually submit the changes I've made, but this dish turned out great and if I write it down on a piece of paper, I'll never find it again. Most of the changes were because of what I had on hand: I used tater tots, 1 lb. bacon, 6 eggs, 8 oz. sour cream, and cream of mushroom soup. I did use more than 3/4 cup shredded cheese, I'd say about 1/2 a block. I didn't drizzle any butter over the top, but next time  might spray the top with Pam before it's done to see if that crisps up the top. It was great without messing with the top. I brought this to a church potluck and it was gone in a flash. I got a little and it was so good, I plan to make it just for my family soon.

The taste of this casserole reminds me so much of Cracker Barrel's hashbrown casserole. If you like that, then you will love this. It is fabulous by the original recipe alone, but next time I may try adding green pepper and fresh mushrooms.

This was a very good one. We are from New Mexico, so we put green chile in everything we eat, that was the only change I made. I will start making this at night, when the kids go back to school so they have it in the morning.

I did not change anything...except I was going to substitute turkey ham, but I forgot the ham all together. 
It was very filling, but for all the time I put into it I was not very impressed.

I just made this for Christmas morning and everyone loved it. I thought it was awesome and will definitely make it again. 
Lots of raves. 
I used Simply Potatoes Southwestern style for hashbrowns. That's the only thing I changed.

The only modifications I made to this recipe were to saute the onion prior to adding it to the other ingredients.  I also added a minced clove of garlic, also sauted.  I used an average-sized onion and it left the dish with an overtly oniony taste.  I will definitely decrease the onion quite a bit next time.  I also added more cheese, and left off the butter completely, since I'd already sauteed the onion and garlic in butter.  Finally, I baked for 50 minutes just to make sure everything was well done.  Reduce the onion and this would be a 5-star recipe.

Fantastic!  May add a little more seasoning, or maybe green pepper next time.  Thanks.

Fantastic recipe! I only added half of the sour cream, and I added an extra egg. I also dislike ham, so I fried breakfast sausage and blotted the grease well. 

Everyone loved it!!! A must for holiday and get together mornings!!!

Very good, but made the following changes: doubled the eggs, omitted the butter (used cheese on top instead), sauted the onions, mixed everything together before putting in casserole dish, and cooked for 1 hour (I doubled the original recipe).  The flavor was a bit mild, so I would recommend using sausage and/or adding more seasoning before baking.

This was a wonderful casserole! It was  east to put together. I used fewer potatoes. Also, I used half ham and half bacon because that is what I had on hand. I think the casserole is better the next day. So next time I'll make it ahead.

I have made this a few times and always get the same reaction. Everyone loves it. Office Christmas Breakfast and at home. I have used sausage and bacon in place of the ham and it good that way too.

Great, I had to bake mine for 1 hour to get the eggs cooked.  I used cream of mushroom instead of chicken.  Pretty flexible recipe, just use what you have on hand, ham, sausage, etc.

This is such a yummy breakfast casserole.  I don't usually eat big breakfasts, but it is so good for dinner or for a brunch on a cold winter day.  This is delicious!

I didn't particularly care for this recipe.  The ingredients seemed like it would be a great combination, but I think it was the soup that messed it up for me.  It also took a very long time to bake.  I don't like to leave negative feedback, but I just didn't care for this recipe.  My husband liked it though.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

I made this casserole for a breakfast at my school. It was a big hit. I didn't get to eat as much of it as I wanted. I also, like others, used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken. I will definitely make this again.

My family loved this recipe the day after Thanksgiving. They've already requested it for Christmas morning. I added an addtional egg and also a little milk to my soup so it would be easier to mix with the hashbrowns. I can't wait to try some variations like cream of mushroom soup.

You can't go wrong with potatoes, cheese, and ham! Only suggestion is to omit the melted butter on top. It didn't add any value, and you can save yourself the calories. I used the country style hash browns (small chunks) and it was great!

Family loved this, great taste! I used sausage instead of ham. Next time I will reduce the amount of sour cream to 12 oz. and increase the eggs otherwise, you can't tell it has eggs in it, and I will mix the eggs in with all of the ingredients so that the consistency is firmer. I love recipes that you can tinker with and they still turn out great, thanks for the recipe!

I have never made this dish and not been asked for a copy of the recipe.  I sometimes add browned pork sausage instead of ham, depending on what I have on hand.  It is a fabulous Christmas or Easter morning breakfast becasue I have made it the night before and refridgerated it until the next day.  Yummy!

My feelings about this recipe are conflicting...I made some changes and will make a few more next time I make it.  I too cut the sour cream in half and did not add the butter. If not, I think it would have been way too runny.

Next time I may mix the eggs w/ cheese and soup mixture...only because I couldn't tell there were any eggs in the recipe.  I think the eggs are to serve as a crust type thing, but it's a pretty thin crust if ya ask me.  Also, I needed to add to the cook time to get the "golden brown" look - about 20 minutes.  Family liked it and it is a good recipe - just needs a bit of tweeking.  Thanks!!

Great basic recipe. I followed the other reviewers advise and only used 8 ozs of sour cream. I also used sausage, which I browned and drained, instead of the ham, and added more spices. My hubby loved it. I didnt feel the need to add all the extra fat and caloried by drizzling on the butter so i just added about 1/4 cup of cheese on top and cooked a few minutes longer.
I will definitely make this one again.

What a great recipe. I made this for a bridal shower brunch and it was a big success. It was simple and delicious. I added green peppers to one and nixed the onions for another to make sure I hit all taste buds. I also prepared it the day before which allowed to work on other things instead of worrying about the entree.

It was delicious, other than not putting the butter on top at the end, by personal preference.  I just topped it with additional cheese instead.

This casserole was a nice change from the "crust + stuff" breakfast casserole recipes I have been using. I thought the 2 lb. bag of potatoes overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients, even with doubling the eggs and cheese. Overall, a good recipe; I will make it again, but will use only 1/2 or 3/4 of the potatoes.

Bland to be honest...  and that's even after adding a pinch of garlic, red pepper flaked, chopped green and red bell pepper and subbing sausage for ham.  Needs waaaay more cheese, maybe change from 3/4 cup to 2 cups and less hash browns- 1lb instead of 2lbs in my opinion  Also took way longer to cook than stated because potatoes were not cooked before hand. Next time I'll cook the hash browns in garlic and butter first to cut on oven time, and boost flavor. Also more egg, I think I'll double the egg mixture and pour half on bottom as recipe says and pour half over the top. Then 10 minutes before it's done cover with another layer of cheese and chopped tomato and green onion.

The taste was good.  I did have to add more eggs like one reviewer stated.  I'm wondering if chopped green peppers and mushrooms might be good added in?  I might try that next time.  My family did go back for seconds, so I will for sure make again.

I read the other reviews and kept that in mind as I made it and yes I made changes to the recipe.  I used half the sour cream, cream of mushroom soup and Simply Potatoes with onions.  I will be making this again.

This is a most delicious dish.  I made it for work and my coworkers loved it so much, they made it at home.  What is really great about this recipe is that it is so versatile to adjust the ingredients.  Different meats, cheeses, creamed soups, and even can be made vegetarian friendly.  I did sprinkle extra cheese on top.

Wow ! This was amazing!! Only changes were cream of potato soup instead of cream of chicken, used jimmy dean diced potatoes instead of hashed browns and I fried up the sausage/potato mixture before putting it in the casserole dish. The sour cream/soup mixture really made this extra flavorful !! A keeper for sure !!

Yum yum. Served this for a girls brunch and we all loved it. I used 6 slices of turkey bacon instead of the ham. Very heavy and filling. We really didn't need the two desserts with it. Created a food coma. Will make this again.

I didn't have any hash browns, so I boiled some cubed potatoes for 15 minutes. I mixed everything in the same bowl before transferring to baking dish, and sprinkled with cheese instead of doing the butter thing. I used only about 4 oz of sour cream, and a lot less onion because that's all I had left. I loved the flavor, I wouldn't have thought about using cream of chicken soup. We loved this.

This will be my signature breakfast casserole forever.  I added diced chicken and an extra egg.  I think I will add more eggs in the future.  Also, it takes longer that 45 minutes to cook, so give yourself enough time.  The serving sizes are huge for eight people, but nothing was left.  It is simply delicious.

This was okay. My family really liked it. I think the next time I will add a little sausage for more flavor. However, it baked perfectly and set up exactly as it should. A little cream added to it might increase the flavor but also the calories, too. :)

Really really delish!!!  We loved it!  Made with bacon instead of ham (we prefer bacon for breakfast).  We are cheese eaters and next time I make it I'll add more cheddar in the mixture and just a tiny sprinkle on top.

This recipe had good flavor. It was way to creamy and didn't have near enough eggs. I doubled the eggs and it still wasn't enough. I think it really needed about 10 eggs. If I made it again, I would cut more than half the sour cream out and add cream cheese.

This was very tastey! I added bacon and a roll of sausage to mine and used 4 eggs instead of 3 because I have some egg lovers. I also used the southern style hash browns for a chunkier texture. I added 2 cups of shredded cheese at the end instead of the butter. There was PLENTY left over and it does reheat well.  Next time I might play around with it and add different veggies or meats.  Great recipe!

Great recipe!  Made it for brunch for my three sisters and we all loved it.  I halfed the recipe since there were just four of us and we still had leftovers.  Also, based on other reviewers recommendations, I still used three eggs even though I halfed the other ingredients, and it was great.  I also added shredded cheddar to the top during the last 15 minutes of baking.  More cheese makes everything better!

This recipe has too much sour cream and butter.  The hash browns after an hour were not fully cooked.  In my opinion, the recipe is not worth the calories!

So easy to make and everone loves it. You will get asked for the recipe everytime. The only changes I made were added more cheese, more eggs and for a little extra something I put crushed frosted flakes mixed with melted butter over the top just like the dinner version calls for.

Great recipe! I found this recipe last week and have already made it twice.  I changed a few things to make it lowfat, I replaced some of the ingredients with healthy choice cream of mushroom, lowfat sour cream, egg beaters, a lb of venison sausage, low fat cheese, and no butter.  It came out terrific! The rest I kept the same.  Great recipe!

I liked this recipe but it needs some altercations for my taste, and my kids didnt seem to care for it at all. I pretty much followed all the directions. The only difference is that I used Potatoes O Brien instead of shredded hashbrowns. I think the texture is what I didnt like with the O Brien potatoes. Next time I will try shredded hashbrowns (definitely brown them first), ground pork and bacon instead of ham and layer the dish differently.

This recipe is my favorite breakfast casserole I've tried!  It went over great at work and I've been asked the recipe many times.  I use ground turkey to make it a little healthier and have even not used the hash browns and it tunred out tasty.

I had never made a breakfast casserole, mainly because I wasn't the biggest fan of them.  I made this and loved it.  I used the recipe exactly except for the sour cream, I cut it in half.  I made it the night before and just warmed it up the next morning.

I have made this for Christmas breakfast and for dinner (served with cinnamon toast and OJ and decaf).  Both times it was a hit.  Even now that I live in a country where the pre-made breakfast sausage, canned soup, and hash browns aren't available, I did it from scratch.  (See the recipe on this site for Breakfast Sausage - yum!)  The only thing is that in my opinion, you don't need that much butter on top, unless you're a real butter fan.

This was excellent----I did not drizzle the top with butter but added buttered corn flakes to the top before putting it in the oven.  I cooked it a total of 45 minutes.

Made night before Christmas and had it cooking while we opened gifts.  It was filling and had a great flavor.  A little greasy so I wouldn't make it frequently but a nice Christmas treat.

I really loved the taste of this.  I think if I did it again, I would add more eggs since it was pretty watery.  I had to cook it longer than it said.  I didn't drizzle the butter on top just to save on fat.  I also added chopped green and red pepper which may have added to the waterty texture.

I loved it, as did everyone else at my brunch.  I love that it has fewer eggs - believe it or not, some of us DON'T like eggs!!  :)  I put half the sour cream, but otherwise, it was completely delicious.

Just made this recipe.  Should have read the reviews first.  I agree next time I make it (I will make it again) I will cut the sour cream and add more eggs.  Otherwise, a good, quick recipe.

Potatoes sausage 
Nice change from the sausage & egg recipes, which sometimes taste too much like just eggs with cheese.  Great for Brunch since it contains all the basic things you want; meat, eggs and potatoes but I would make it for dinner also.

This is one of my favorite breakfast casseroles to serve houseguests and it always gets rave reviews. I do like to change it up occasionally by adding a can of diced green chilies.

i did make some changes, and it was a so good. LISTEN to the cooking times very closely! i did not think mine was done after 30mn so i placed back in over for about 15min and it was enough time to brown my bottoms, and sides, a little too much for my liking!
Otherwise, this dish was a hit! Everyone loved it, and i didn't even have full amount of sour cream, nor sharp cheddar. I improvised and it was a success.

I made this for a RV rally and it went over very well. The constructive feed-back I got was next time, saute the onion. 

It was very good and I will for sure make it again.

Def. Half the sour cream. Way too much. I added country gravy on top which was good. Dont need the butter. Just add extra cheese on top and broil at the end. I might make again substituting french onion dil for the sour cream and maybe crunching up cornflakes and melted butter to make a topping.

I had this for Christmas brunch. They enjoyed it.  
I substituted Cream of Mushroom soup. Used fewer potatoes and used shredded red skinned potatoes instead of frozen hash browns.

Love it!! I used southern style hashbrowns and did cook them first. I halved the sour cream and omitted the butter, used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken. I mixed everything in a large bowl then put in baking dish.  I cut up a ham steak and it was magnificent!! I cooked almost an hour then topped with cheese and cooked for 15 minutes more.  It turned out amazing!!!

It was pretty good! I tweaked it a little bit. Used diced potatoes instead of shredded, used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken, used turkey instead of ham (one person at the office is allergic to red meat), and i MEANT to put chives in it, but forgot to grab them from the garden.

I added a tablespoon of seasoned salt and 1 teaspoon of garlic powder to give it a brunch feel.

It’s a favorite! I also use crumble cooked sausage sometimes in place of the ham-or diced frozen potatoes instead of shredded.

Flavor was great but a bit potato-heavy in my opinion.   I did double the eggs, but still thought there was too much potato.  When I make it again (and I will) I’ll try cutting the potatoes by at least a third. I have to admit that I’m not a real potato fan but thought this recipe might be a nice change from using bread in a strata. I like the cream of chicken soup, sour cream, and onion combo which I also use as a sauce in my chicken enchilada recipe.

After reading reviews, I feel like I just wung it (winged it?). I used 5 eggs, halved the sour cream, used low sodium cream of mushroom soup, added diced red and green bell pepper, 2 scallions instead of onion, browned the hash browns prior to mixing in, probably tripled the cheese but did a mix of about 1 cup cheddar jack and 2 cups pepper jack. It still could've used a bit more heat. It was certainly edible, though browning the hash browns first seemed to reduce the volume so much that I should've used more. Nixed the butter completely as there was plenty in the browned hash browns. I mixed everything together and baked for almost an hour on 350. It tasted more of eggs than potatoes, though that could've been the home layed eggs I used. I will tweak this some more but would make it again. The family enjoyed it, with the exception of the one who only likes runny yolks.

I made exactly by the recipe. To me there wasn't enough egg in it. It seemed like more of a hash brown side dish to me instead of an egg type breakfast casserole. It was very good though but should be served as a side dish.

my go-to breakfast casserole. I've made it twice for our office Christmas breakfast and several times at home and it's always a hit. Love this recipe. I substitute the ham with regular sausage and use cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken. I also season my eggs wit thyme. Delicious!!

I halved the recipe because my husband doesn't  like casseroles and baked it in a casserole dish.    The flavor was good!  I also put cheese on top instead of butter.  I added some no salt seasoning, and white pepper instead of black.  I'll make it again!

After reading the reviews and some of the tweets that where made I used 6 eggs  one cup sour cream and the secret is to get all the moisture out of the potatoes I squeezed then in a kitchen cloth and got out all the liquid and it came out perfect not runny at all

It was OK  the 2nd time I heated it up. It was missing something and I even added some seasoning. I think I would sub sausage, reduce the amount of sour cream, add more eggs and cheese.

This was easy to make and it was very tasteful, the family loved it.  I had to cook it for an hour instead of the 30 minutes that was recommended. 
Would make again, but maybe lightly cook the hash browns to get the liquid out. I'm thinking this is what made is more soupy.

Love this recipe. I have made it dozens of times. Super easy to adjust to your own taste. Never used ham. Never drizzled butter over the top. Browns up nicely without it. Used different kinds of sausage that I precooked.  I usually go the spicy route and have spiced it up many different ways. Chorizo and tapitillo sauce is a favorite.  Hot breakfast sausage and Tobasco yummy too. Cooked bacon is also super delicious.  Have added chopped frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry. Really great versatile recipe that no matter how i change it up always gets raves.

I made this, when we had house guests last year.  We all loved it and enjoyed it two mornings in a row.  I am making it this weekend for more house guests.  It's a delicious and filling breakfast dish!

Doubled the eggs, cut the sour cream and hashbrowns in half.  Cooking took longer than indicated (about an hour).

Pretty standard taste for this type of dish.  I 
followed previous reviewers and cut the sour
cream to 10 oz, increased the eggs.  As with
some previous reviewers, I am still looking for
that great breakfast casserole.
