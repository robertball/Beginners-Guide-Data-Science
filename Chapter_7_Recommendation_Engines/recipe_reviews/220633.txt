I'm happy to be this recipe's first reviewer but I have to say this wasn’t much different from other, similar asparagus recipes from this site.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed it, tho’ I used olive oil, not margarine and, since the asparagus I used was young and tender, it only required 10 minutes of cooking time.  I particularly enjoyed the shallots and the delicate hint of lemon.  And frankly, it was nice to see no garlic for a change!  Don’t forget salt and pepper.

Omit the lemon peel - it's too bitter.  Much better without.
