I loved these cookies!  I did add lemon zest to the batter because I didn't think it could hurt to have more lemon flavor.  I must say that I think 400 degrees is too high to bake such a delicate cookie.  I baked mine at 350 for 9 minutes, and they were perfect.  They were light on the bottom and perfectly set.  I don't like the taste of glaze made with lemon juice (too tart), so I made my glaze with powdered sugar, water, and added lemon extract (and tinted it yellow), so it made a very pretty cookie (glaze had a nice lemon flavor without being so sour).  Going in my "keeper" file!

I just won "best tasting" at the Christmas cookie exchange with this recipe and these changes:  I did use the 350 degree oven and baked until edges started turning golden, about 7 minutes.  Did not have lemon extract, so used vanilla extract, and about twice as much of (real) lemon juice.  Added about a tablespoon of minced lemon zest.  Made the glaze with just lemon juice and powdered sugar, and added the glaze while cookies were warm -- this makes the glaze seep into the cookie.  Very delicate flavor and texture.  Plus, I won an awesome Santa dishtowel!!!  Thanks to the nice lady who posted this recipe!  =)

These cookies are delicious! I followed the tips that were left in the previous reviews (bake @ 350 for 9 min, add lemon zest to batter). My husband, brother-in-law and son loved them. For my glaze, I melted butter, combined with powdered sugar, milk and lemon juice. Not too tart with just enough lemon flavor. Will bake again, thank you!

I made these exactly as directed and I thought that they were just OK.
If I make these again I will definitely add in some lemon zest. I did make a lemon glaze and drizzle on top, and it was very tasty. The cookies turned out moist and had a great texture, however the bottoms got very brown, very quickly - and I baked on parchment lined cookie sheets. I even cut the time down to 8 minutes of baking but the bottoms just got really dark, almost burnt. I used a tablespoon size cookie scoop and I got exactly 30, uniform cookies. They still get four stars though because my kids really liked them.

Absolutely delicious!! Packed with lemon flavor!! I pretty much stayed true to recipe, as a personal preference, I baked at 350* for 10 min. I didn't have any lemon extract so I used 1 fresh lemon. Using the zest of a whole lemon and put that in the dough along with the juice of half the lemon in place of the extract. That made the dough too wet, so I just added a little extra flour until it looked right....about 2-3 Tbls. I also made a lemon drizzle: juice of half of lemon, 1/4 C. powdered sugar,    1/4 C. Heavy whipping cream and 1 Tsp. butter (softened) mixed with electric mixer on high speed to desired consistency. Cake like cookie, melts in your mouth!! Thanks for such a great recipe ;)

Needs more lemon (zest of 1 lemon was good), and I baked for 11 minutes at 350. I used a lemon glaze (1 c p. sugar, 1 Tbsp melted butter, a lemon juice to make it thin enough). They were barely finished when my hubby attacked the pile. Yummy! I also put some yellow and pink decorating sugar on top since they are Easter dessert. :) (I also live at 6500 ft, so I added about half a cup of flour for altitude. )

OK, now I wish I had read the reviews first.  The temp is way too high...I'd go with 350 and check after 7 min.  I too used zest in batter along with subbing real juice instead of extract.  I'd pump up the lemon flavoring next time.  I made these for a lemon fan and she'd love more flavor.  I followed the instructions and15 cookies were BURNED!

I think these cookies are wonderful! I did tweak it a bit, but the only things I changed were the baking temperature (350) and I didn't use lemon extract, I used fresh lemons and added  lemon zest. These cookies are so light, and perfect!

These were not super sweet - kind of subtle, which I like. We did not have lemon extract so I mixed the zest of one lemon with 1.5 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp lemon juice and let that sit while I prepped the rest of the dough. I used unsalted butter so I added about half a tsp of salt, too. I was out of powdered sugar so we did not do a glaze, but my church ladies loved the cookies' texture and the not overly sugary taste. Will definitely make again. We baked at 375 for about 11 min on parchment-lined sheets and they turned out perfect.

I also put the oven to 350 for 9 mins and added some lemon juice to the batter. They are really easy to make I just wish they were a little more moist. The kids and the hubby liked them a lot, so that's all that matters. I made a lemon glaze as well.

Great tasting cookies. I would suggest lowering oven temperature to 350. They are not as sweet as I like cookies so next time I'll bump up the sugar. All things considered they are darn good. My wife can't believe I did it!!!

We love lemon desserts! This was such an easy recipe, and they came out so delicious.  Soft and yummy!  I baked at 350 instead as well.  I also just tossed in fresh lemon juice and zest to the batter.  I topped with a simple icing of lemon juice and powered sugar.  That added the extra "zing" of lemon. Thanks jaibux for your "accidental" cookie recipe!

Have made these many times now over the last few years and they are delicious. Haven't changed the recipe and they turn out perfect every time [although my oven tends to run cool]. A tasty treat for those in my family that like lemon!

I followed the advice in the comments added zest and cooked them at 350 for 10minutes. They were perfect, exactly what I was looking for.

I followed the suggestion on the lower temperature, just to be safe, and these came out great! Nice lemon flavor without any glaze.

Easy, tasty, and definitely will make again. I added 3 teaspoons of good lemon extract and a nine ounce bag of Dove's Dark Chocolate Covered Blueberries. Yum, blueberries and lemon - love the combo and cake-like texture of these cookies. Gifted them to my teacher friends and they loved them. Thank you!

Delectable, delicate delights! I followed the advice of countless others and baked at 350 for about 12 minutes—perfect.  I used the zest of two lemons instead of lemon extract (I had none), and I made a glaze of fresh lemon juice and confectioners sugar.  Sprinkled them with decorative sugar.  They were even better the next day.  You must try this simple and sweet recipe—you’ll be glad you did.  ***Just made these a second time, and I still used the zest of two lemons, but I added one teaspoon of the lemon extract—MAN, OH, MAN!  Lemon Lusciousness!

These turned out wonderful! (Just as the majority of reviewers stated.) I halved the recipe just to try them first, and the only  changes I made were  that I added 1 tspn of vanilla extract, and because I didn't have lemons on hand, used 2 tspns of limoncello liqueur, and they turned out great according to my husband. Note, however, that he is not a fan of strong , lemony flavor as I am, but according to his taste, they were just right.  Thanks for the recipe! This one's definitely a keeper!

Just made these and they turned out beautifully.  I did follow other reviews and baked for 11 minutes at 350.  Also added lemon zest and a third tsp lemon extract ( we love lemon). Will definitely make again. I will be taking them as a small dinner guest gift.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Nice textured light cookie, but lemon flavor is not very strong as written. I did make a lemon glaze for cookies out of powdered sugar and lemon juice.  Reduced oven temp to 350 and baked for 10 minutes.

I added 1/2 - 1 tsp lemon zest since we love lemon flavor. Baked at 350 for 9 minutes. Glazed with a little lemon juice and powdered sugar and dusted with powdered sugar on top. Light, soft, lovely lemon flavor. Tastes like spring. I will make again for Easter.

Really nice and soft and fluffy.  I added a lemon glaze, and they were liked by my kids and guests alike.

Yummy! Easy to throw together I did add the zest of one lemon to the batter and glazed with a vanilla glaze. Going to try these with different extracts :)

I turned these into keto cookies by replacing the flour with almond flour and a few other substitute flours, and replacing the sugar with stevia and erithrytol blend. They were decentI’m guessing if I hadn’t turned these cookies in to keto style cookies they would’ve tasted a lot better, so I rated them 5 stars.

I kind of liked the cookie. Followed the directions, no adjustments made. I just wish it was a little more tart...that's how I personally like stuff that has lemon in it.

Excellent base recipe.  I've made it with orange and Grand Marnier, too.  Next I plan to use lime peel and raspberry extract.  Or maybe just lime extract.  It's really easy to fiddle with.

I read the reviews first and added zest and added an extra tablespoon of extract. I made the topping with lemon juice and a little melted butter. They  turned out great! I will be making these again!

Made these for a tea at church and they were a hit.
Drizzled a lemon frosting on made with 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 cup butter, 1 tsp fresh lemon juice, and 1 tsp lemon zest.  Used an icing bulb to swirl on the frosting. Yum.

I've made these cookies time and time again for the past few years. My friends and family (including people who don't even care for lemon) go nuts over these and I often get requests for them.

As most reviewers have suggested, I make mine with lemon zest on top of the extract and bake them at 350 (usually 8-10 minutes). While theyre still warm, I make thumb indentations and fill them with lemon glaze (1cup powdered sugar with enough lemon juice to make it into a thick glaze).

Made as is, except lowered the heat to 350 for 10 minutes, my oven seems to run quite hot
Very delicate,  delicious cookie. I  don't enjoy a real sweet cookie so this was perfect for me. I sprinkled a bit of sugar on some as i put them in the oven for the family members that prefer sweeter. 
Will Indeed make again

I loved this recipe. I didn't have lemon extract, so I used lemon oil (LorAnn brand) and it worked out just fine. They have a light lemon flavor, and I think I might try some lemon zest too next time. A glaze would be fantastic on these
