for the last reviewer.  If it is too hot then adjust the amount of hot sauce you put in.  It calls for 3 tablespoons so cut it to 1 1/2 or 2 depending on how much you want to lesson the heat.

This recipie was easy to make, but it was really really spicy hot.  maybe it was just a bit too spicy.  I would like to know a way to bring it down a notch.

So easy and very good!! I didn't use 'onion juice'...instead I used a few green onions.  Also, I used 'whipped cream cheese'.  This is one of my new favs! THANKS! :)
