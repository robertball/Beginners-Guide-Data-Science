I made the sugar free version of this with crystal light orange breakfast drink mix and Publix brand instant sweet tea with lemon sweeted with nutrasweet. And, let me tell  you, it was sooooooooo good. I looked for tons of recipes for this online so I could make the best one. The initial bad rating this recipe got kindof threw me off at first (but I couldn't find another sugar free version) so I tried it. And I also tried a decaffeinated version that wasn't sugar free from another recipe I had where I used Tang, and it paled in comparison. This recipe is the best! Now, I'm off to try the caffeine sugar version. I think it will come out marvelously.

My mom always made this around the holidays growing up, and we loved it (she called it "Tang Tea").  You HAVE to use the lemon-flavored, sweetened iced tea mix!  Or, if you use UNsweetened iced tea mix, you have to add sugar as well.  Otherwise it's very bitter.  I imagine this is the mistake that the people who gave the recipe a bad rating made.

Excellent Recipe!!! What a shame someone would give this recipe a bad review when the problem was probably in their own choice of ingredients or their lack of knowledge. I've made this tea mix for years and given it as gifts too. My family would be distraught without it.

My daughter made this for a 4-H demonstration at the county fair this summer. She served it cold/over ice--which people really seem to like! So cold or hot this is a hit!

Patsy, this is a lovely tea mix.  I've had hot spiced tea in several restaurants, and this certainly competes with them all.  It's easy to add new spices to the mix and create new "strains" of the tea, such as adding vanilla or crushed raspberry candies.  As for the low rating, it might be a good idea to practice ahead of time if giving as a gift to be sure of it's success. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is a really good tea mix.  It's too bad someone gave it a bad review because it really has a nice flavor.  Especially if you like sweet and tangy.  I agree with the previous reviewer about the orange flavor being dominant.  I even added a box of orange or peach gelatin (I don't remember which).  Will certainly be making this around the holidays.  Thanks for sharing.

Worked out great for my gift baskets! I ended up having to make so many batches that I just stopped measuring stuff and did it to taste. For my own use, I've found that making the tea in the Crockpot and then putting in a pitcher in the fridge is really easy! Just pour a mug full and microwave for about a minute and a half! Easier than measuring mix and boiling water every time you want a cup.

This is so good!  I received it as a gift and had to make some of my own.  I keep a tin at work, and it's been wonderful to have a hot cup at my desk on those cold wintery days.

This is a wonderful mix!  The only reason people are rating it bad is because there must be a typo in the serving directions.  I think she meant 1 1/2 tablespoons mix into 1 cup hot water.

We have made this tea for years and enjoy it completely.  Like any recipe of this nature, you can tweak it to your liking.  A little more tea, little more Tang..add presweetened lemonade... Or, you can do what we do..I have extra tea and extra Tang available and you can add more of what you want..or not.  One thing I like to do when I make a pot of this is to use whole cloves instead of ground cloves, and throw (well gently lay) a couple orange slices in.  Makes a great holiday drink.

I agree with Josie. It's too bad that someone else didn't like this recipe. I don't think it's too expensive, and I love how I can have a jar of this sitting on my desk at work and not have to go through all the trouble of steeping a tea bag, then adding sweetner and cream to regular tea. All you have to do is add to hot water and stir. Wonderfuly simple! And it tastes great too!

Thanks Patsy!

My mom used to make this when I was a kid and I continue to make it as a mom and grandma. I use decaf Lipton instant tea, (3 oz size) Tang (20 oz size), and Countrytime lemonade mix (19oz size). The whole jar of tea, 2 1/2 c each Tang and lemonade. Add approx 5 TBSP cinnamon, depending on how cinnamony I want it, approx 3 TBSP cloves and approx 3 tsp nutmeg. Keep it in an airtight jar and use all year long!! It's especially good for sore throats and colds!  And using the decaf tea, I can drink it up to bedtime, and kids can too without being awake all night!

I really should not rate this tea as I have never made it., but will be using this recipe as 1 of 2 beverages at a Mother's Day reception I am hosting.  The other beverage is coffee.
Based on the reviews I have read I expect people will like the tea and am considering packaging the mix and giving it as small gifts.

We made some with sugar free lime and lemon drink mix one year and gave it as gifts.  They went over VERY well.
