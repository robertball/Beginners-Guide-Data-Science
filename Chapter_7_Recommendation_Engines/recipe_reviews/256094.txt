First time making a dessert in the slow cooker, and what came out was fudgey, gooey, peanut butter goodness.  At an hour and a half it hadn't quite pulled away from the sides but the center was only barely jiggly and we like it on the gooey side so it was perfect for us.  Note-  I could have gone for a stronger PB flavor, but that's what happens when it is made into dough, maybe I will add chopped PB cups instead of the chocolate chips next time (or both ;-).

I thought this cake was fabulous! We ate it warm with a dollop of whipped cream. It was moist but not soggy as I had feared. I will definitely make this again!

Made this tonight with my 7 year old only thing we did different was added extra chocolate chips because she accidently added too many.  Ir came out So yumny.  We ate it warm with vanilla ice cream. I  loved that it was so easy we could do it together and I  had all the ingredients  on  hand. Thank you for the great recipe:)

Quite good. I might try creamy peanut butter next time (personal preference).

I used plain full fat yogurt instaed of sour cream the first time I made it. Second time I used sour cream. Both times it turned out goey and delicious!
I only buy all natural peanut butter so I added more sugar.

Forgot the chips at first so incorporated them 'on top'. 

wonderful! Definitely MANY grades above the old eggs and flour cakes from decades ago on the farm.

This was just okay. I had one serving of it, not really my kind of dessert. My husband liked it. He’ll eat anything with chocolate in it. Doubt I’ll make it again.

Meh....

Made this dessert for the family tonight. Couldn't really taste the peanut butter, burnt edges, soupy in the middle. None of us were impressed at first but then we scooped it onto a pile of vanilla ice cream, then it shined, it was delicious! I wouldn't eat it alone but it is a scrumptious ice cream topper.

Not sure what I was expecting, or whether or not this came out right.  I am only able to get out of the pan with a spoon (is that correct?) and it’s very tasty.  But it never seemed cooked...almost like a lava cake, but with the lava on the top.  Is that what I should have?

I made it according to the directions in the recipe. It was very dry and hard to get out of the slow cooker. We had to put lots of ice cream on it to make it edible.

Don't waste your time. Buy some eggs and make a real cake the old fashioned way. I can't believe this was featured in the magazine.
