This was super easy and pretty darn good, too! My oldest (12 yr old) is very picky and he ate almost all of this up. I only made minor changes. We were out of onions, so I used minced garlic while fryin the hamburger. I used garden spiral noodles (they were on sale) and I added frozen peas before baking. I will definitely make this again! Thank you!

Was just ok for me. Kids picked at it, barely ate any of it. I think because it had a very strange smell, and it looked pretty nasty. Will not make again. Sorry.

This was a simple, tasty dish that my family enjoyed.  I made a couple of changes. I used pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce, and I used rice instead of pasta.  It turned out well and tasted good.  Put a salad with it for a quick, easy meal.

This was an easy dish and good for a weeknight as it took only an hour from start to on the table. I used a little extra cheese on top as it was pretty skimpy otherwise. This was okay but we didn't like it enough to want to have it again. I thought the green pepper was too much for me and overall it was fairly bland and lacking. My husband said it was okay, but he really didn't want the leftovers. It was filling and a good way to stretch a pound of beef to feed a crowd. This paired with a mixed greens salad and dinner was complete. Thanks Lisa, I enjoyed trying out a new recipe.

Not a bad dish but not fabulous- it was sort of homemade hamburger helper. Unfortunately I couldn't even get the BF to try it.
