Taco Mix w/ Black Beans Haiku: "Gave us leftovers, by stretching one pound of meat. Thought it was quite good." I ended up adding a 3rd tablespoon of taco seasoning (Bill Echol's "Taco Seasoning I" recipe from here" after tasting this, thinking the meat was still on the ho-hum side. The directions didn't indicate draining the grease from the meat, which I did anyways as well. Took recipe submitter's suggestion and used mine in a ranch, romaine, tomato salad w/ crumbled tortilla chips and cheese on top. Seriously yummy, and I've got leftovers for lunch tomorrow, yay!

This has become a favorite staple in my house. This recipe is so easy and SO yummy just as written. I use the Taco Bell seasoning most of the time but have enjoyed it with other seasonings. I also use Ground Turkey instead of beef and any jar of salsa on sale works well. Leftovers are perfect for nachos!

I used ground chicken browned in olive oil & doubled the recipe.  Made great taco salads! This will be my new go-to recipe for quick taco salads.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

I made this, following the recipe exactly.  Super fast and easy! I found the amount of taco seasoning perfect - not too strong for my picky 2.5 y/o but flavourful enough for the adults. Hubby and kiddo ate it in a bowl with shredded cheese and I put it into a flour tortilla with cheese, Greek yogurt, and lettuce.  More than enough left for leftovers. Thanks for this!

I thought it was really good!  Not only I love black beans but it also stretched our meal.  I did not use a bottled salsa, instead, i used fresh onions, garlic, & tomatoes.  We made taquitos and taco salad out of these!

Very fast and easy, plus super tasty! Would consider adding corn with a large amount of meat for that extra kicker.

Used 1.25-1.50 lb grd chuck, Added extra salsa and taco seasoning to taste, can of creamed corn & a chopped fresh poblano pepper. Adjusted water for consistency (used more than 1/4 C) and made THE MOST amazing burritos with jarred queso, fresh avocado and sour cream, shredded cheese and chopped romaine. The family RAVED! It stretched to serve 6 although my daughter in law chose to eat it over the romaine like taco salad. Major thumbs up and economical!

My family loved this, including my picky 5 year old. I added minced garlic and onion to the meat mixture (turkey rather than beef) and served it over sliced romaine lettuce tossed in a dressing of lime juice, sour cream and sea salt (I would've added cilantro if I had any on hand). We also topped our salads with diced avocado. The tangy dressing and crunchy lettuce was a fantastic complement to the savory meat.

Was such a great recipe and so easy to make. Something new to try with ground beef. Served it over rice instead of in a taco shell. Worked out great.

So easy! I doubled this for a family of 4. Two teenagers. I also used cantina style salsa with big chunks of tomatoes cabbage onions and cilantro. I was done with dinner in 10 minutes! It’s a win win!

I used a lean turkey and the seasoning packet from a Ortega taco kit. Used two 20oz packages of turkey. Will definitely make this recipe again. My family loved it.

My brother's like very simple and predictable tacos.  I get bored of that so I tried these instead.  I did add a can of Rotel.  Turned out very awesome!

I used homemade salsa not  Pico de gallo, and in the seasoning I used red pepper flakes.  My family likes spicy.
