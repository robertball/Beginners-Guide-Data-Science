I am giving a high-five for spices and originality here. I do not eat ketchup, bbq sauce or tomato paste/sauce, and this recipe uses a great combo of spices instead of that same old tomato-based flavor. I also appreciate no onion! I made only a few small changes: I did not wrap with bacon, and instead of ground pork, I used Hot Pork Sausage in the mix. I used a large loaf pan, and at 350 it only needed about an hour. In the middle of the loaf I placed a string cheese just for fun. There was not as much grease as you would expect, I did not have to pour any off during cooking at all. The loaf did NOT crumble at all, and thick slices made great sandwiches for days! Thanks for the great recipe, it was perfect for our family.

Great meatloaf - I think the thyme and sage gave it a somewhat unique flavor that pumped up the volume a bit and really made this meatloaf stand out against more traditional varieties.  

I did sub the bread crumbs out for almond flour to make it GF and I didn't experience any issues.  

I know the OP emphasizes that this is not a low fat dish -- which is fine with me of course (I made it and enjoyed it!) -- but the meatloaf is absolutely swimming in oil/fat when it's pulled out of the oven so just be prepared for that.  I baked mine in glass loaf pans and the oil/grease/whatever was completely submerging the full lower half of the meatloaves.  When they were cooked, I removed the loaves from the pans and placed them on a cooling rack to drain off as much of the oil as possible.  There is definitely no risk that you'll have a dry meatloaf with this recipe.  

This dish is very savory and very moist and my husband about died he loved it so much, just be prepared for the oil/grease when you remove them from the oven.

I used two pounds of ground moose and one pound of pork sausage.  I increased the amount of mushrooms to 2 cups.  I used Italian breadcrumbs in lieu of plain breadcrumbs.  I used 1 envelop of Lipton Mushroom Onion Soup/Dip mix in lieu of the mushroom flavored soup base.   I checked the temperature at 70 minutes and the center temperature was 175 so that was when I pulled the loaves out of the oven.    I also used one pound of bacon to weave a lattice over the top of both loaves.  Great taste.

This is my best wild game meatloaf. I used 2 pounds of elk and 1 pound of pork sausage. I also. Used 2 cups of bread crumbs. Because the meatloaf was too moist with 1 cup of bread crumbs. I used Lipton mushroom and onion mix instead the mushroom onion broth. I didn’t add the mushrooms to the meatloaf. But sautéed the mushrooms and covered the finished meatloaf with them.

This is amazingly good.  It makes quite a bit, so we usually freeze half of it for later, but if you have a large family, will feed them well!  We make this a lot now, one of our favorite meals!!

The family just loved this recipe and gobbled up both loaves. It made a very nice moist loaf that was beautiful and held up wonderfully. I didn't have mushroom soup base so I used some beef mushroom gravy that I was going to serve over the top other than that I didn't change a thing.  With that being said I didn't care for it because of the spices and I knew I wouldn't so I wasn't disappointed. Be mindful (as I was) that if your not a sage and thyme fan your gonna have a bad time with this recipe but if you are this is totally one to try.
