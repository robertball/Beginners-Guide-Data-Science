This was absolutely wonderful.  I doubled the whole recipe and it was very well received.  I will make this again.  Thank you for posting this recipe.  If steak isn't your "cup of tea" you could sub pork, chix or even shrimp.

this was an excelent recipe. I halved it as I was only making it for myself and my girlfriend, and it turned out beautifully. I held off on the hot sauce, which I dont think Ill do again...I could tell the dish was lonely without it.

Great breakfast/brunch option for those not favoring the typical sugary sweet stereotypes.   I put the marinade together the night before, cut the steak into strips, and let them marinate overnight. The flavors were definitely there, but not overwhelming.   Will make again.

I didn't use the sauce of this recipe, just jarred salsa, so I am only rating the rest of the recipe. I cooked the steak in the skillet and the peppers, mushrooms and onions in a skillet.  I liked the hot sauce with the egg! Yummy and filling for breakfast. Next time I make these I will try the sauce in this recipe.

My family loves this recipe. We always substitute red bell peppers for the red onions. Instead of dicing the meat after cooking, I cut it into thin strips before. My kids call it breakfast fajitas, but we always have it for dinner.

Very disapointing.  I even added extra hot sauce.  Ended up putting sourcream, cheese and salsa in the wrap, so as to give it flavour. Will not be making this again.

Not bad. For a neophyte like me, it was somewhat difficult to put together, but it came out alright.

Great dinner option to use leftover beef .Made marinade and simmered the vegis instead of adding it to the meat.We should have cooked extra eggs, we ran out.This had great flavor and textures.We will definitely do this again!

We used leftover strip steak from the night before and warmed it in the sauce. Excellent.

Made it for dinner, loved the recipe but next time I think some fried potatoes would be a great addition!
