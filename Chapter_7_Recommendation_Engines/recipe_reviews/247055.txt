I made this exactly as written except for using a yellow onion instead of shallots. I probably ended up marinating the pork for closer to an hour.  I also made some without the sausage and some with.  The sausage ones were way better. I steamed them on high heat for about 40 - 45 minutes since my dough was a little too thick (I need to roll it out better next time). It turned out great anyway! My husband and I both enjoyed it.

These turned out really good! I did add some minced wood ear mushroom and also diced the Chinese sausage. I didn't have shallots so I used regular onion instead. I have to work on my dough sealing skills, but they looked fine and tasted great.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and my dough was a little on the dry side. I made a second batch with 4 cups of self rising flour, 1 cup of sugar, and 2 cups of milk. I let it rest for 30 minutes and then knead it again after resting. That seemed to work better for me.

This looks real close to how I learned it many years ago. I actually cook the filling first and to make the dough White you use rice flour available at any Asian grocery store!
