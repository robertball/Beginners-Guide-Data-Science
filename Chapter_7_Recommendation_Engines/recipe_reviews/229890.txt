5 stars with changes: used fresh-caught amberjack. Seasoned the amberjack with Lawry's dry seafood rub  then wrapped in bacon, skewered, put on grill. Squeezed fresh lemon over before serving. Amazing!!!

My store actually had amberjack:) so we tried this tonight.  I must admit I changed some things.  I hate it when people do that, but we have some that don't like BBQ sauce, so I used a mesquite seasoning and grilled it in a cast iron skillet.  Everyone loved it, we'll definitely have it again.
