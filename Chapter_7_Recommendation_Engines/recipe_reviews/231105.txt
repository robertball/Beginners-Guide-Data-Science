Made this recipe almost as is(added a little more chicken). It was great. Put a little curry powder in the leftovers, it was also great. Just a little different.

The dressing was way to sweet just using poppyseed. Needs salt and pepper as well. Use red onion for best balance. I use spiral pasta and omit nuts.

some time. If I'm out of dried cranberries cut in half grapes work well. Like another mentioned I add red onion and cracked pepper to the mix. I'm a fan of cucumber so it's not uncommon for me to add in a diced handful. Radishes are also an excellent addition. Served over a bed of lettuce, without the pasta as a sandwich ( I love this stuffed into a pita) or mounded on crackers ( Triscuit is a fantastic choice for this) this always hits the spot on a hot summer day when ease, a light fare and coolness are just whats needed.  If I'm out of almonds, walnuts work just as well.

This recipe is a great concept, but it always bothers me when any recipe calls for 1 1/2 cups of chopped chicken--it ought to say how much that weighs--that would keep the reproducing of the recipe consistent.  Also, 6 tablespoons of onions?  What am i supposed to do--chop the onions and take a tablespoon measure and measure the onions out 6 times?  And raw almonds or any nuts don't ever add much to a dish for me--toast them?  and it's all the difference in the world.
I compliment the person who put this together, because it's a really nice combination of flavors.  I added a chopped boiled egg--and used Vidalia onions for a sweeter and not overpowering onion taste.

Can't find a thing wrong with this recipe. I had some cooked chicken in the fridge and everything else in the pantry. You might want to add some salt and pepper but I don't think it needs anything.

I found this recipe very simple, very tasty! Poppy Seed Dressing has always been a fav in my home, so this salad was a hit! 
The only change I made...I used red onion.
Great to bring to the beach, or picnic on a hot day. Just keep cool :)
Thanks a lot for sharing!

This was easy to make on a hot Summer morning.I made it for a lunch with a green salad.If you like the ingredients then go for it because they blend well. I used some of a rotisserie chicken from the previous night.

Loved this salad.  I really liked the poppy seed dressing in place of the usual mayo.  The cranberries were a nice addition.

I have made this several times. As written, I agree it is too sweet. I cut the poppyseed dressing to about 3/8 cup and add 1/8 cup balsamic vinegarette dressing. I also add crumbled feta cheese.
Tonight I tried using homegrown cherry tomatoes instead of cranberries since I have a huge crop of them. That also cuts the sweetness and is still delicious!

This is one of the tastiest pasta salads I've had. I used two cups of chicken and two tablespoons of onion - didn't want the onions to over-power the salad. Other than those two changes, I followed the recipe.  I would suggest chilling for several hours before serving...it makes a big difference in the taste. I will definitely make this one of my summer staples.

Had higher expectations of this one.
It turned out kinda bland. Needs something to make it better- no UMPH.

My family loved this pasta salad! I used a rotisserie chicken and bow-tie pasta. I followed another reviewers advice and toasted the almonds, which was delicious. I also added baby spinach. This is a keeper!

Have made this many times this summer.  I love to use bow tie pasta.  I add a little more dressing if I serve leftovers to keep it moist.  Doubled the recipe just as written.  Delicious and so easy.

Added mayo to the dressing, about a 50/50 mix.  Also added red onions as other reviewers did.   Plus a little salt and pepper.  Turned out great, everybody loved it.

I will be making this again. I used a yellow onion but will try a red onion next time. Lots of flavor and I love the cranberries in it. Delicious. Oh yes I did toast my slivered almonds.

I made for church potluck.  Brought most home.  It was OK but seemed to lack something to keep together.  I added more poppy seed dressing but that didn't seem to help.

My new favorite pasta salad. You could make this without the chicken if you wanted to. I doubled the recipe and used a whole box of pasta and a whole bottle of poppy seed dressing. Added finely diced red peppers too.

After reading other reviews mentioning blandness I opted to use 2T of black Cherry balsamic vinegar instead of  the milder champagne vinegar and agave syrup in lieu of confectioners sugar.  My vinegar choice was wonderfully tart.  Great salad will be making this again.

Refreshing change for a summer salad! Cranberries give it even more moisture, and the celery satifies the need for "crunch".

We really liked this pasta salad. I added some grapes that had been halved. I left out the chopped onion as some people don't like onions. I used walnuts that I had toasted for a few minutes in a skillet since I didn't have almonds. I will make it again.

I thought this was a particularly tasty pasta salad. I love anything with slivered almonds in it, and the cranberries give it a little extra interest, as well as color.

I didn't make any changes; I just tripled the recipe to feed a larger group.  Put salt and pepper out for those that wanted it.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  Delicious.

This recipe looks absolutely delicious, but unfortunately, I am on a special diet at the moment and can't eat it. As soon as possible, I will make it. If it doesn't come out as good as I expect, I will adjust my rating. I will make Delicious Poppy Seed Dressing from this site, as it's not readily available where I live. A note for Jud - I also have a problem with measurements in cups and TBS/Tsps. If you have a kitchen that weighs in the metric system, there is a possible solution: click on the number of servings - you can adjust the servings, and also change the measurements to the metric system. For example, it tells you 210 grams for the chicken and 60 grams of onions. My scales measure in metric or ounces.

Oh my gosh so good and so easy!!  I had leftover rotisserie chicken that I used with Rotelli pasta.  I've always loved poppy seed dressing and I used a red onion and some sea salt and fresh cracked pepper.  I didn't have any cranberries and my daughter has a nut allergy so I left out the almonds but it was still outstanding. I'm serving it for a Memorial Day bbq and I know there won't be any leftovers.
