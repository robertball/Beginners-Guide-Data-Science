I made it this weekend for a family function, everyone loved it! However, I did add a couple of what I thought were essentials. I squeezed in the juice of 1 fresh lime, 1 clove of fresh garlic, crushed and about 1/2 tbsp of freshly grated ginger. Threw the ingredients in my mimi food processor and whipped it up. Wow, the flavors just popped! Used a variety of whole grain pastas, bow ties, fusilli and mini penne, delightful and healthy!

You had me at 'pasta' and 'sugar snap peas'.  Didn't change a thing and it makes a stand-alone meal for me.  Of course, it's easy to add chicken thigh meat or shrimp which I will probably do next time.  Thank you.

I really wasn't sure what "sweet" chili sauce was, so I added some Heinz chili sauce and then some Asian chili sauce (hot).  I've made a lot of Asian pasta salads, and although we enjoyed this, I think it's really lacking freshly-minced ginger.  If  I make this again, I definitely will add that to the recipe.

Wow this recipe is fabulous. What a wonderful change from the traditional summer salads of potato, macaroni, and pasta salad. I followed the recipe exactly and tasted the sauce. I agree with other reviewers that it needed a little kick so I added a clove of finely minced garlic and a pinch of dried ginger. (Too lazy to drag the real stuff out of the freezer and grate it.) The addition of those two flavors took this recipe over the top. I added the chopped red pepper and I also blanched the snow peas for one minute. The taste explosion just pops in your mouth. This recipe goes into the summer salad lineup. As others have mentioned the addition of chicken or shrimp would make this a meal in itself. Thank you CookingWGreen for this tasty recipe.

just made the salad omigod yummy!! like the other's I added garlic,ginger and splash of lime juice. It hasn't even been chilled yet and I love it . I also added to it finely shredded savoy cabbage, finely sliced carrot ,sliced celery and just before packing some up for my lunch for work will add sliced cucumber for the fresh,crunch factor. I will be making this regulary for my lunch for my working week. I didn't have on hand rice vinegar so I substituted it with white vinegar, still tastes yummy! thank you for sharing the receipe! even my husband likes it, and he a retired chef!

Wonderful recipe!  I made this as written using the red bell pepper and the sugar snap peas.  I did blanch the sugar snap peas for about 1 minute in boiling water to bring out the green color of the peas.  I used a box of cut spaghetti rather than regular spaghetti.  We wanted a different salad for packed lunches and this fit the bill, nicely. The salad held up nicely for 4 days.  My son warmed his up rather than eating it cold and he liked it better that way.  This could easily be a main dish by adding cooked chicken or pork to the other ingredients.  Great dish with lots of flavor.

Loved this salad!  It has a great flavor, and you can make it ahead of time.  I subbed soba noodles for spaghetti, and snow peas for sugar snap, because this is what I had.  It turned out great, and it was very satisfying.  WW 9+

My husband and I both loved it!  Wasn't sure I was going to like the sauce with so much soy sauce and vinegar but I made it how it was written and it was delicious!  The snap peas were a little crunchy for my taste, so I might try cooking them a little next time.  This is a super quick and easy recipe, but also tasty enough enough to serve when guests come over.

My vegetarian husband tried one bite and exclaimed, "F@%$ Yeah!"  I used whole wheat pasta, snow peas, Asian garlic chile paste, and reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 tablespoons as this was our dinner.  I added one whole seedless cucumber, about 2 cups of kale, about 1/2 cup cilantro, and 1 tablespoon of miso paste.  I boiled the pasta and when there was 1 minute left to cook I added in the snow peas and the kale.  We also mixed everything up and ate it right away as we were making it for a weeknight dinner.  There was plenty of sauce even with the added vegetables.  It made 10 cups and with all those additional veggies each cup was only worth 3 Weight Watchers points!  It would be good with toasted peanuts if you're looking to add some protein.  Next time I'll try making it with soba noodles.  This will definitely go in our weekly rotation this summer.  Loved, loved, loved it!!!!!

This is a great pasta salad; a nice change from the usual mayo based pasta salads and a good mix of tangy and sweet. To make it five star worthy I would add some grated ginger to the soy sauce mixture and some carrot sticks for more variety of color. You could use Sriracha if you can't find sweet chili sauce. Thanks for sharing!

Made this for a potluck and everyone loved it.  I doubled the recipe and was a little surprised by the amount of 'liquid' vs. pasta/veggies; however, that is just an observation - not a criticism (and my husband has a plan for the leftover sauce!)  The bottom line is that everyone commented on how tasty the dish was.  Relatively easy to make and very delicious.  A pleasant change from 'Italian style' pasta salads.  This will be a go-to dish for future potlucks.  Glad I expanded my horizons and tried a new recipe!

Very tasty!  Served with Salmon to my mother for Mother's Day - a real hit!  Used whole wheat Udon noodles and a squeeze of lime juice for brightness and she took the leftovers.  Will make many more times!  Great!

Made this for my family to accompany our BBQ chicken tonight.  I included the garlic clove and lime juice that others mentioned.  We all loved it (even my 11 and 9 year old children - the 11 year old even had seconds!)

Super quick and easy and so delicious!  I didn't have sugar snaps, which would be great in this, but did have some shredded carrot that needed to be used.  I made the dressing as written with the small exception of just a smidge more sugar and vinegar.  I had about 8 oz buccatini pasta to use up, a big, fat spaghetti noodle with a little hollow center.  It was terrific!  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us.

This was very good, I took the time to read the reviews first this time. I am glad I did since the consensus seemed to be to add ginger and garlic! I also added cilantro since I have enough in my garden to feed the entire US Army. The peas are also just coming in, in fact other then the bell pepper, and carrot all the produce came from my garden. That is only because the carrots and peppers aren't ready yet! I also added a splash of Sake (about 1 tsp. worth)a lime and it's zest and also I used Soba noodles as another member did. Oh I couldn't see the olive oil in there either, so I used peanut oil and a 1 (t.) of garlic chili paste for a little kick. Which both just seemed more Asian inspired to me. It was very good, in fact every bit as good or better then any I would go out and get, so this one is a win. This recipe will be something I will use over and over. I also agree with some of the other members that this salad with shrimp, or chicken could easily a main course! great recipe thank you "Cookingwgreen"

Yummy!  and easy to make.  I made it exactly as written, but here are my notes:
• I used Rice Wine Vinegar, which is what I had.  I don't know if it is the same thing as the rice vinegar the recipe called for.
• The recipe did not specify, but I nuked the sugar snap peas for 2 minutes.  Next time I will just blanch them in boiling water, and then plunge in ice water.  
• I toasted the sesame seeds in a small sauté pan over medium heat, shaking the pan while they turned a toasty color.  Very easy. 
• I found the sweet chili sauce in the ethnic section at Publix, and I'm glad I bought a good size bottle, because this dish will go in my regular, often prepared, recipe file.

I made this today, it is really good. Didn't have sugar peas so I just threw some regular peas in. I also added garlic and ginger, and some minced Serrano chile, and some julenned carrots.  I marinated some chicken in the sweet chile sauce and sesame oil, grilled it, sliced it and served over the top.

I was just looking for a dressing recipe for a pasta salad I was making with whole wheat penne, asparagus and peas. I had all the ingredients in the house so I gave it a shot. This one is a keeper. The sweet chili sauce I used is something I always have on hand for when I make spring rolls. It's called "Thai Kitchen Sweet Red Chili" and is available in every grocery store. Thanks for the recipe.

Loved loved this salad, I used whole wheat spaghetti and did take the advice of another reviewer and blanched my sugar snap peas. I do think I'll add in some fresh grated ginger next time, but it was just terrific as written. We served this with Sweet Spicy grilled shrimp, and very nice combination.

So, so good! Everyone loves it! I have taken this to many a BBQ or potluck and it's always gone. I like to add all kinds of complimentary veggies like mushrooms, edamame, even bamboo shoots and water chestnuts. Try it, you'll like it :)

Awesome! Even better the next day. Didn't have sweet chili sauce but used chili garlic sauce instead. Also added edamame and carrots and peanuts on top (wanted a little protien). Think I'll add even more veggies next time. And there will be a next time for sure! Loved it!

Probably won't make again.  I thought it needed more sugar and less soy sauce.  It was OK, not great.  I added garlic and ginger as others suggested.

This has wonderful flavor and is a great change from the typical picnic pasta salad! I left out the bell pepper and added the juice of one lime and a clove of garlic like another reviewed suggested. I will make it again but without the sugar snap peas next time. In my opinion, they didn't fit...literally...they were too big and too crunchy (and I blanched them first). Next time, I will probably add diced cucumber and tomato. But, honestly, you could make it without any veggies at all. Don't be afraid to try this and experiment with the veggies.

My family loved this dish. I will definitely make it again. The only change I made was adding about 1 teaspoon of sesame oil to the water just to flavor the spaghetti.

My Family ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! including my ultra picky 10-year-old son! I stir-fried shrimp, green onion, carrots, green peppers, sugar peas, and zucchini in a separate pan using a tablespoon of coconut oil and little soy sauce, ginger, one squeezed lime, one clove of garlic, then I combined with sauce recipe and pasta noodles served warm instead of chilled

This is an awesome dish. The flavors are spot on and delicious,  I, however, don’t like cold pasta in the middle of February so I make it in my wok and served it hot. Really great.  My family of five all want me to make it again.

I didn't have red pepper or snow peas so, like some others, added some celery and thin sliced carrots  plus some ginger and garlic. 
Flavor is really good but brown color isn't as appealing.

We loved this at our house.  I did add grated ginger and  little lime juice.  Also didn't have the peas, so substituted chopped cucumber for some crunch.  Will definitely make it again.

Bland. Very, very bland. Yes, I like spicy food but it doesn't have to cauterize my sinuses for me to enjoy it. I had to amp this up with more sweet chili sauce and some orange-ginger sauce. I won't make it again.

This is a great recipe! For me, it makes a good vegetarian meal. I made it exactly as written. I'll try others' suggestions and add some ginger and garlic next time and see if I can make this already yummy dish even better! Thanks for sharing :)

This was an easy salad to get together and perfect for a warm Spring day.   I added a tsp. of fresh grated ginger and used fresh broccoli that I blanched a few minutes and water chestnuts for crunch instead of snow pea pods.  I definitely think you need the ginger. Make sure you do let it sit  before eating so the sauce soaks into the noodles.

I'd either cut back on the sugar or skip it all together and use a different type of pasta. Other than that, it was an okay salad.

I am sneaking a taste as I let this sit overnight.  Its an amazing change from traditional pasta or macaroni salads.  I added some boneless pork loin sauteed in bite size pieces.  I think I'd like it with less sugar and add lime juice, grated ginger and garlic as no Italian can live without garlic!  Its a keeper as a dish to pass at a BBQ (no meat in this just add carrots and zucchini or cukes)  or as an entree with the pork.  Cannot wait to eat this tomorrow!

Very tasty salad!  I followed the recipe exactly for the dressing portion and had to use a mixture of red and yellow bell peppers (what I had).  I did add more snow peas than called for.  My sugar didn't dissolve in the vinegar and soy sauce, so I microwaved it for not quite 30 seconds.  We will definitely have again.

Didn't find this to be very good.  Edible, but just barely.
