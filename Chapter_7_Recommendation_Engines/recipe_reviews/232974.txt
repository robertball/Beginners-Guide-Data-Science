This is a good way to spice up macaroni and cheese.  I left out the ground round. I also added hot giardiniera on top before serving. Thanks for the recipe:)

I wasn't a big fan of this recipe, although a lot depends on the salsa used, how much flavor gets contributed.

Taste-wise, I felt it was too one note, and likewise texture wise, it the same problem. I even added additional seasonings but it still fell flat flavorwise. I think the Velveeta kind of masks and smothers spice. 

If I was going to make this again, I'd probably use colby jack or other cheese with more of a kick to it. And to make it more pleasing to the mouth, I'd dice in some bell pepper near the end, only lightly cooked, to give it the much needed crunch factor to break up the monotonous texture.

The real deal. I would recommend putting extra cheddar on the top with some paprika.

Easy and everyone loves it. I used Boca meatless crumbles instead of Beef, and added a little taco seasoning as the other reviewer suggested.

This was delicious! I was using leftover ingredients from taco night, so I had to adjust the recipe a little bit to fit the quantities that I had left. My ground beef had taco seasoning on it, which was a great touch! I also had to use spiral noodles instead of macaroni, because that's all I had. I think I may have added a little too much, but I just added a little bit more water and it was fine. I added about half the amount of Velveeta, because I don't really care for it that much. It was still plenty cheesy/creamy. I will definitely make this again!
