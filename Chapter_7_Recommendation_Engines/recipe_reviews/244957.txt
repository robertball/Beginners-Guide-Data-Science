I substituted honey for the sugar, applesauce for the oil, and dried cranberries for frozen cranberries. I baked them at 325 for 24 minutes and they came out perfect.

A good muffin, but I felt that the tartness of the cranberries over powered the banana flavor just a bit too much. I wonder if dried cranberries might work better?  I used AP flour instead of whole wheat and tossed in about 1/4 cups of chopped walnuts.

Great but I tweaked it. I added a dash of cinnamon and A little bit more but I love because I love the flavor. I use dried cranberries instead of frozen. I also added a little less sugar because my husband has slightly high blood sugar so we avoid using a lot of sugar in baking, And they came out awesome backed for about 23 minutes and they were great! Super soft and moist. Can't wait to make the recipe again but maybe next time I'll use another fruit instead of cranberries to experiment !

Love these!!  Substituted AP flour for the whole wheat flour, used brown sugar instead of the white sugar and added 1 extra banana and frozen blueberries to the batter instead of cranberries....will definitely make these again :)

These are amazing! I did substitute frozen cranberries for dried and they work really well. Nice cranberry tart to them. Really easy to make. I had my 9 year old daughter help out (this is her first thing she made almost all by herself) and she had no problem making it. These are for sure going on my "more often" list.

I followed the recipe with only one very slight change. 3 bananas is equal to around 1 cup of mashed banana, so I used 1 cup of mashed banana (I had only two very large bananas in the house). The muffins are tasty and have a nice texture, but are a little too sweet for me. I would probably cut the sugar slightly if I made these again.

We liked these!  I've made them twice now, once exactly as written and another time attempting a healthier version by using applesauce instead of oil and half brown sugar and half white sugar. The healthier version was still really good, so I'll attempt reducing the sugar next time.

It was pretty good I did half the cranberries as most reviews said to do that I am so glad I did I think next time I will quarter them though as it was still a little tart. I made 30 in total six GF and the rest regular only 10 were left over when I left the party there were a few people left though. Perfect balance of tart and sweet great banana flavor does take a little longer to bake in my oven 30 minutes for regular 40 minutes GF. I used white flour and olive oil instead as I did not have whole wheat and vegetable oil.  Would definitely make again! They were a hit!

I made too many changes to really give this a fair review - added an extra banana, swapped 1 cup of powdered sugar for white sugar, etc.  As a result, they were not very sweet, but when topped with maple syrup or honey, they tasted good and were moist!  If I made again, I'd probably use the suggested ingredients and might cook or soak the cranberries in simple syrup.

I appreciate the ingredients for my teen, but she didn't like the whole (or even halved) cranberries. Next time I will either dice the cranberries or will dice craisins.   Otherwise this was a hit!!

I liked this recipe.  It is easy to follow  and the muffins are tasty.  I like the nip the cranberries provide in contrast to the sweetness of the banana.  Nice, easy muffin and very tasty.
