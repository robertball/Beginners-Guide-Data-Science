Love this recipe!  I like cole slaw anyway, but this is a step up!  I am not a fan of raw onions, so I left them out.  I also was running low on mayo so the dressing turned out a bit thin, stick with the original amount if you can.  I used 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4 and it still turned out pleasantly sweet - this probably depends more on how sweet your carrots and cabbage are to begin with.  So glad to find this recipe, definitely my new go-to for slaw!
