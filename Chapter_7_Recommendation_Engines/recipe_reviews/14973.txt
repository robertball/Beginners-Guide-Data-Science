The recipe name leads you to expect a very sweet bread, which this is not...but that's OK!  It's still great.  Possible reasons for failure in other cooks' attempts at this bread could include the previously mentioned abundance of sugar in the recipe(pie filling, apple juice, additional white sugar), as well as the cinnamon.  Cinnamon (like garlic) is a natural enemy of yeast!  I've found the best way to work around this is to add the cinnamon later in the cycle - my machine has a beeper that tells you when to add ingredients such as raisins or nuts toward the end of the knead cycle, and that's when I sprinkle in the cinnamon.  As for the sugar, I didn't have a problem but perhaps you could try reduced sugar pie filling?

I'm sorry about all the people who had bad luck with this recipe.  I thought it was wonderful!  My Mom said it was like the "old-fashioned" bread her mother made.  The texture was fine, the flavor was great, and it was gone in no time.  I did have to add about a TBL more of bread flour, but that's the only problem I had.  I have another batch making as I write this, and I will make it again.

I love this recipe!  I use my home-canned apple pie filling, so it's not too sweet, and I use the dough cycle on my bread machine.  Take the dough out, punch it down and roll out cinnamon rolls.  Let rise until double then bake and top with powdered sugar frosting...YUMMY!

***Original Review 8/30/2000 ***
I don't have a bread machine, but decided to try the recipe anyway. Everything turned out as expected, the smell _was_ really wonderful. I don't think I let the bread rise quite long enough before baking -- the top split -- but I was pleased with the results. It was a little on the heavy side, but not rock-like. It would make a good breakfast/dessert bread.

*** Update 1/18/05***
I finally broke down and got a bread machine. I ended up having to adjust the flour on this a bit to get a good consistency dough.  Once it was at that nice "tacky" stage, it came out beautifully. Flavor was kind of subtle, not a hit you over the head "apple pie", but even my picky DS likes it! Loaf came out an even pale tan color since the machine churned the apples up completely. The recipe name is a little misleading, but the bread is tasty!

Tripled checked my measurements and ingredients but it never came together to form a dough.  I was looking forward to it and was very disappointed that I wasted my money and time.

I think the problems others have had is probably due to using apple pie filling with way too much sugar. I used my own apple puree (made ages aog and stored in the freezer) which has just a little sugar added. This seems to be just the right amount. Scrummy!

I tried this recipe twice because I couldn't get the ingredients to mix up right in my breadmaker. The first time produced a bread that didn't seem cooked in the middle.  I was playing with the ingredients and had to add more bread flour. This was my fault. The second time produced a much better bread with less problems, but I thought I would taste a more apple-tasting bread and didn't. I still liked the way it turned out but was a bit disappointed.  I will try it again!

This bread tasted AWESOME, but the dough was awfully sticky, I ended up adding a ton more flour, and it still ended up flat.  Ugly but good.

I have to agree the others that say this recipe is a waste of time and ingredients. It came out not done in the middle and mushy. I added bread flour until it made the ball but the recipe still did not turn out correctly.

Count me as one of those who absolutely loves this recipe.  For those of you who had problems, I used King Arthur Bread flour, a store brand (Food City) of apple pie filling, and I have a Breadman Ultimate bread maker.  I did not add any flour during the kneading process.  The dough was slightly soft, but I have a lot of recipes that are like that and turn out great.  (My Sally Lunn recipe is almost like batter, but it turns into great bread!) Don't be scared off by the bad reviews.  this is a great recipe!

This was very easy to put together but it tasted horrible. The middle was not cooked and had the consistency of glue. It was very heavy and not sweet at all. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone!!! It was awful!!

Ok...for those people who says this bread doesnt rise...lets put it this way...have you made banana bread before? I think this is the same deal is banana bread instead of banana it is apples. As the dough mixture mixes it just kinda flops but it still cooks and works out in the end.  I just made a loaf tonight and I followed the advice of putting the cinamon later in the cycle when the bread maker beaps.  It smells just like apple pie, it is a heavy loaf of bread and I am excited for tomorows breakfast! Also, I used the entire 540mL can of apple pie filling which I think is way more than 1 and 1/4cups but my machine does a great job in chopping up things!

This bread came out super soft. It had a nice flavor and I think I was looking for a little bit more apple pie flavor.  I even added 1/2 cup more apple filling.  Maybe next time I will add the whole can.  My husband and kids loved it and I will definitely make it again.

Oh, my gosh!  This was my first loaf of bread to bake in my bread machine.  The bread was not sweet...AT ALL!  The loaf was a little chewy.  My husband and I thought the recipe submitter left out an ingredient or two.  I followed the directions exactly.  It looked good until we tasted it. I will not ever try to make it again.

WOW!!!! Absolutley delisious!!! A super soft & moist bread. Perfect with coffee or for breakfast. I was really concerned when making it after reading the other posts, but now I'm glad I made it! Also instead of using apple pie filling I used peach and it came out delisious!! Mind you though, I do have a can of apple pie filling just waiting to be used!!!  :-) Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!

There is no way in the world that this recipe could work for anyone.  Rather than long explanations:  Let me just say that recipes which have alot of sugar (the sugar content in apple pie filling is HIGH!) require a different set of baking rules.  The ratio on this recipe could not begin to work.  A good explanation can be found on Kingarthurflour.com.  Highly invaluable information for all will to read.

The flavor of this recipe was very weak.  Also, had to add more flour by about 1/4 cup.  This recipe makes about a 1 1/2 pound loaf in my machine.

I tried this bread because I love the 
smell of apples, and I am glad I did.  
The smell was fantastic while cooking and
tasted even better, it has a soft fluffy
texture to it.  This is now one of my 
favorites.

The bread in itself wasn't very good. I couldn't make it stay together as a dough until I added about a cup and a half of extra bread flour. After I got it hold together, I noticed it was very sour. So I added 3 tablespoons of sugar. Listening to the advice in the other reviews, I added the cinnamon right before the second rising. After that, it rose perfectly and is a great hit. Diffidently will be making it again with these changes.

After reading all the reviews, I didn't have powdered buttermilk, so just added 2 mort tab of flour and instead of 1 1/2 tea of yeast, I put in 2 tea. I also added 1/4 tea of nutmeg. I put the ingredients in acording to manufacturers directions. I woke up to a wonderful loaf of bread. Nice and light, not dense at all. I used the 2 lb setting and the light crust setting. Since I wasn't up to watch the dough, I can not say if it was real sticky or not. But it turned out nice.

I thought this bread was good.  I tweaked it a bit, per suggestions- less baking soda, more apples, no cloves.  It was still a bit gummy but nonetheless tasted great.  Will make again if I have apples to spare.

I thought this recipe was very easy.  I did not have any problems with the dough.  In fact, when it was done, the bread raised much higher than I expected.  It was moist and very tasty!

I overall liked the recipe but found
that it needed more flour than it had
called for. In the end it did turn out
but I had to keep adding lots of flour
for the dough to form its ball.

This recipe failed to rise and was uncooked in the middle. It was completely inedible, although I followed the directions. I would not recommend this as it's a waste of ingredients.

I'm glad I wasn't the only one!  The bread came out hard and heavy, and didn't seem to be done completely (top was pale, not browned).  The taste wasn't that bad, but the texture was so unpleasant that I had to throw it out.

The house DID smell good while it was baking, but I had the same results - a door stop.  Mine wasn't cooked in the middle either.  The flavor was good, but was inedible due to the texture.  I think there was too much sugar.  Sugar in the liquid (apple juice), the pie filling and 5 more TBS in the recipe.  I liked it enough to try to fix it, but only those who LIKE to figure out how to fix broken recipes should try this one.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  It came out flat, hard, and compact, with very little rise in spite of stict adherence to the recipe -- twice!  Others of my acquaintance reported identical results, so I think the yeast amounts should be increased.

I was hesitant to make this after reading some of the bad reviews but I noticed that most people either loved it or it was a total flop. So I took the advice of those who made it successfully and it worked great. I used exactly the ingredients that were in the recipe and saw that it was pretty sticky so I added more flour. 6 extra tablespoons got the dough to the point that it was not sticking to the sides of my machine. I also saw that some people said it wasn’t sweet enough so I used a total of ¼ cup of sugar. Also I added the cinnamon right before the second rise. It worked beautifully. I just got my bread machine a week ago and this is the prettiest loaf yet. It is not very sweet even with the extra sugar but will work great as a breakfast toast with a little cream cheese spread. Also, I used a fork to cut up the apple slices in the canned apple pie filling before putting in my machine. Surprisingly there are no chunks of apple whatsoever. This is a very smooth moist textured bread but not packed or wet like a heavy banana bread. My dough rose very well. I encourage you to try this and use these tips. I will definitely make it again or else my family will be very angry with me.

This is now my new favorite bread recipe! I did make a couple of changes due to what I had on hand.  i used fresh apples and blended them till smooth(think thick applesauce) and used sour cream instead of buttermilk I did have to add extra flour but thats usual for our climate.

I REALLY wanted this to be yummy and was really looking forward to it since is smelled amazing, but when I took it out of my bread machine it had fallen in the center and had this dried glue-like crust on top, the bottom portion was dense and sort of soggy.  I even thought I would try some of the bottom part (couldn't even break off the top "crust") . I didn't eat any. I  have experimented with breads and done some research on trouble shooting problems and all I can guess is that it has too much moisture (hence the soggy parts) and too much sugar I have read can kill yeast (hence the imploded, brick hard top).

I put in a bit too much yeast but it worked wonderfully.  I used the Pampered Chef Sweet Cinnamon Sprinkle instead of straight cinnamon though.

This apple bread was alright, but I was looking for a bread that tasted really sweet with apples and cinnamon in it, but this wasn't it.  It was good and we ate it, but I am trying to find a bread similar to an apple loaf I once brought.
I won't try this one again.

I wouldn't say that this is a sweet bread but I wasn't disappointed. You will get a hint of the apple and cinnamon but nothing overwelming. The bread rose fine and it was a little moist in the middle. I cut a warm end off and spread some butter on it and I was in heaven.

Amazing!!  I overdid it a little with the apple pie filling (putting the entire can in there, adding a chopped apple and extra cinnamon in at the nuts/raisins beep and replacing water with apple juice) which made it very good but the bread ended up spilling over the edge of the dish since I had to add more flour as well.  Had to let it sit in the machine for an extra half hour to let it cook.  Also, I made a cinnamon dipping sauce for it (cinnamon, powdered sugar, melted butter, vanilla and milk).  Tasted like apple pie with everything combined.

I will definitely make again. The wife likes super fluffy bread and I've been having difficulty with various recipes turning out flat and dense. I added 1tbs of gluten to the recipe this time around and it turned out perfect.   

Now onto the perfect banana bread recipe for the bread machine.

Made it twice.  The dough never formed into a ball the first time, thus producing a thing that was super hard on the outside and undercooked inside.  The second time I put the whole can of filling in a blender before Iadded it to the mix. Also added way more flour and the bread rose perfectly.  Only, it was pretty bland.  Tried to doctor it up by toasting slices of it and spreading butter, cinnamon, and applesauce on those slices for breakfast.  Still didn't bring out the apple flavor in the bread. Won't make this a third time.

This is a tasty bread with a more dense texture. I was a bit disappointed that you really don't get any apple chunks in the bread and wonder if you could add the filling at a later time in the cycle? The only changes I made was to subsitute a 1/4 of the pie filling with spiced apple butter. Very tasty and great smelling bread!
