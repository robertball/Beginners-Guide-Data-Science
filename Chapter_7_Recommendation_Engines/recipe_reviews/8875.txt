I adapated this recipe for my crock pot--which was super easy and pretty good.
I used two pounds of skinless/boneless chicken thighs, and cut them up a bit. I put them right in the pot with the other ingredients,  and included two cloves of minced garlic. Cooked on low for six hours.  I added about 1 cup of  frozen peas just a few minutes before serving, and served it with white rice.  Very nice with a tossed salad!

The smell alone while this was in the oven should be an air freshener. 90 mins don't seem like a long time but when it smells that good it seems like eons. This was awesome chicken! We had it two days in a row and wasted nothing! Even my picky 5 year old thought it was the greatest chicken he ever had. The only chicken he liked prior to this was in nugget form. I followed the recipe exactly as stated. As I said, it smelled great, looked pretty and tasted wonderful. Never thought of using cranberries for anything but cranberry sauce. Served it with corn bread muffins and buttered asparagus. This will be the way I bake chicken from now on. I am really thinking about trying the sauce on ribs. YUMMY!

The whole family loved this one! I used 6 skinless, boneless breast halves and just salt and peppered them and put them in a 9x13. Then sauteed the onion, celery, 1/2 c. chopped green pepper and 2 cloves minced garlic until everything was softened. Added the cranberry sauce, bbq sauce (and a dash of tabasco). Baked uncovered for about an hour, basting twice. It was extremely yummy :).. I know I'll be making this one often.

This was very good.  If you cover the pan with foil, the sauce doesn't burn and you don't need to baste.

Just made this for 15 of my family members! They loved it, including 4 kids! Please, follow the directions exactly as written, using whole cranberry sauce and using the veggies. I took the advice of another user and got a spicy BBQ sauce to balance out the sweetness of the cranberry sauce. I also sauteed 4 cloves of garlic with the onion and celery. 5 star, all the way.

My kids gobbled this up!  I used a spicy bbq sauce by accident and it toned down the spice a lot!  In my opinion, do not cover this dish with foil.  If you do the sauce does not get as "sticky" and "gooey" as it needs to.  It caramelized so nicely on top of the chicken and if I would have used foil on top I know all that yumminess would have slid right off.  I didn't use the onion and celery because it didn't appeal to me.  Try this, it's great!

I add a 1/2 cup more BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's), use boneless skinless breasts, and cut the cook time to 45 minutes. Because you brown the chicken first, the 90 minute cooktime is too long and will dry the chicken out. I have made this several times and it's Mountain's fave :)

i have been making this recipe for years and it is one of my absolute favorites.  the mixture of whole berry cranberry sauce and BBQ sauce is lovely.  you can make it without the celery, but it is much lovelier with.

Delicious chicken!!
Everyone LOVES this chicken. I did alter it though. I cut out the celery and just put onion rings underneath. I also cut out the step of browning in butter. I just place it straight into the pan, spice it (I also use paprika) and then pour the sause combo. over.
Thanks for a great chicken recipe!

I knew when I saw this recipe that I would love it and I was not disappointed! This was a yummy dish; the chicken was really tender and the sauce was delicious. If you arent wild about sweet dishes this probably isnt for you, but I really enjoyed this and will definitley make it again and again. (I didnt have the veggies on hand the first time I made it; just cooked the chicken w/ the cran and bbq alone and it was still excellent).

I am not a big fan of anything that calls for jarred sauces but this recipe was a big hit, especially with my 14 year old. She rarely comments but tonight she went all out to make me understand that this was a good dinner.

The combination of flavors and textures made for a truly interesting change of pace. I poured off the excess fat after frying the chicken and found that it was done after 60 mins.  We served it with rice and a salad.

This was okay. My kids ate it without comment as did everyone else. I didn't cover the dish while cooking and there was plenty of sauce, maybe too much. It's a great way to use up that leftover whole cranberry sauce from the holidays and that is likely the only time I might make this again. If I did make it again I would add something, not sure what yet, but something.

It was lovely! My Other half and I LOVED it! 
I used cheapy bbq sauce (was in the cupboard), cranberry sauce, chicken breasts, peppers, onions, garlic puree and mix of seasonings (included dried peppers,  chillies, garlic etc) . I put foil over it for the first 30 mins and then cooked uncovered for a further 60 mins. The chicken was moist and the sauce reduced and went very sticky and yummy. Had with chips, roasted parsnips and broccoli.

You can use this sauce for almost any kind of meat... I've been using it on pork, meatballs, and pot-roasted chuck or brisket for several years. Definitely five-star - anyone who eats it loves it. If your family or guests say they "hate" cranberry sauce, use the jellied version and don't tell them - they'll never know and will love the finished dish.

This was a wonderful dish!  I didn't have the celery on hand but have to imagine it would have only made it better.  I used a spicy BBQ sauce and the cranberry toned it down just enough so it was not over powering and just enough zing.  We roasted some root veggies to go along with and everyone cleaned their plates.

We all enjoyed this recipe. Even our daughter, who doesn't really care for bbq said it was pretty good.  Will be making again and again! Extremely easy to make.  Instead of basting, I turned the pieces upside down every 15 mins. Great recipe!

This is great, especially when you're pressed for time. I make a homemade BBQ sauce that calls for dried cranberries, so this is really close to what I make. Good job.

Very good!I used only 3 chicken breasts and put them in a 8x8 dish so the sauce covered the chicken completely. I still baked it for 90 mins and it was SO TENDER and yummy. As another person mentioned, I also used spicy BBQ sauce. Delish!

The BEST and easiest chicken bake. My family almost got sick of having it, because I made it so many times after I found it. LOL It is now a lovely regular in our meal-plan.

A truly excellent recipe.  It's very simple to make--mostly just the cranberry, BBQ sauce, and onion (I hate celery, so I left that out)!  The only part that's a bit tedious is the basting every 15 minutes, but it's worth it in the end.  I've made this chicken twice so far, and have had guests and family raving over it.  I think my Dad's hooked on it...I'm hoping I can find another chicken recipe that will live up to the success of this one!  Thanks so much for a wonderful, delicious recipe--this one is a real keeper.

Very good. The cranberries adds a nice mix of tartness and sweet savory flavory to the spicy barbeque. This was good and I will definitely make it again.

This was delicious!! I made it for a few friends, and it disappeared so quickly!  The cranberries really made this BBQ chicken recipe something to remember, and it will be made over and over in my house!!  I made just as the recipe dictated, just left out the celery.

WOW!!! This is amazing! I used Jack Daniels spicy original sauce and it was great. The cranberry makes the sauce thick and it sticks to the chicken-yummy yummy. I used chicken legs instead of a cut up chicken and they worked great. I did not cover with foil as some reviewers mentioned and I did baste every 15 minutes. I am very happy I discovered this recipe and will make regularly. It was really delicious and makes your whole house smell SO good!

Yummy!  I added a little cayenne and garlic powder to spice it up as others suggested and was really glad I did.  The result was a delicious thick, sweet, and spicy barbecue sauce.

My family loves this chicken!  We like the mixture of sweet and spicey so I used extra spicey bbq sauce.  It couldn't be easier to make.  I even adapted the ingredients to make a sauce for cocktail weenies.  They were a big hit over the holidays.

My kids loved the chunky celery and onions with the cranberries.  I loved that I didn't have to buy special ingredients for this recipe.  I had everything in my pantry and freezer.  I was suprised that it retained the saucy texture even though it cooked so long.

Very good.  However, I will admit I made in my slow cooker.  I found this recipe, essentially the same in my slow cooker cookbook.  I actually cooked too long in slow cooker.  I used bone-in chicken thighs, skin removed.  Cooked on low for 7 hours.  For the sauce, I did add a hefty dash of garlic powder.  Only had jelly cranberry sauce, not whole berry kind, so I added a small palm-full of frozen cranberries.   Sauce was amazing!  I think the whole dish would have been great had I not overcooked my chicken.  Funny, cause my grandma and husband made a gravy/sauce sandwich with sauce on top of bread after dinner.  (Yup, that's how good it is!)

This was good but nothing over the top. My kids did not care for it at all. I thought it was a nice change from regular bbq sauce. I used a cut up chicken that I skinned and it was a major pain. Would be so much easier and healthier to use skinless chicken breast. And all the pieces would cook to the same doneness at the same time. There seemed to be a lot of mixed reviews as to covering the chicken with foil or not. So, I started out with it uncovered and wish that I left it that way. The sauce was nice and thick and stayed on the chicken. But, I was worried about it drying out so I covered it about half way through. The condensation of the steam made the sauce too watery and also made it slide off, which some reviewers have complained about.

This is a tasty way to jazz up regular bottled sauce, not to mention it uses up that random can of cranberry sauce lurking in the pantry.  I used olive oil instead of butter and Sweet Baby Ray's sauce for 3 large bone-in chicken breasts.  Served with Honey Roasted Potatoes and roasted asparagus... very good.  Thanks!

Yummy! I made this using boneless/skinless chicken breasts and it worked out fine - no basting necessary.  My boyfriend even liked this one and he hates cranberry sauce!  This dish is even better on the second day as leftovers, since the chicken has had time to marinate in the sauce.

This was a huge hit with my crowd!  I had several people ask for the recipe, and it was so easy.  I did take a short cut on it, and used individually frozen chicken breast tenderloins.  I just put them in the pan frozen and instead of cooking the onion and celery in the chicken drippings, I just used butter.  I poured the sauce over the frozen chicken and baked it.  It worked beautifully!

I simply LOVED this recipe! The cranberries didn't "take over" the dish, and the barbecue sauce was oh so tasty. I was very surprised at how juicy the chicken was, considering that you don't cover it to bake. Even my friend, who doesn't like cranberries, asked for the recipe so she could make it!

I used leftover cranberry orange from the refrigerated section, and the recipe was fantastic.  Even the two picky kids ate this!  Not a flavor I would want every day, but definately tasty and a great way to use up leftover cranberry sauce!

My entire family loved this recipe!!!  To cut out some calories, I substituted pam cooking spray for the butter.  I also removed the skin from the chicken, too. I eliminated the celery, as I do not like it.  I took advice from other members, and lined the dish with foil for an easy cleanup.  I also did not baste the chicken every 15 minutes.  Instead, I took the advice of another member and covered the dish with foil.  The chicken turned out yummy and tender.  Can't wait to make this again!

This recipe was a wonderful change from the regular ordinary chicken dishes. I was really surprised at how tender the chicken was considering the baking time. The sauce was a added bonus. Great recipe and I will cook it again. Thanks

My family loved it!  I used boneless chicken breasts and jellied cranberry sauce.  I skipped the second step and just sautéed the veggies in olive oil instead.  I baked it about 1 hour covered.  I will try the whole berry next time just to see if it is as good.

Made this tonight. DELICIOUS! I didn't brown the chicken, used 6 boneless breast and put them in a 13X9, sauteed everything plus garlic then poured it all over the chicken and baked uncovered for 90 minutes. I will make again, for sure!

Save yourself some money and some work....use only the chicken and the bbq sauce and you'll have the same flavor as if you chopped up the veggies and added the cranberry.  It's ok, but it's just barbecued chicken cooked in the oven.

This chicken was awesome!!  I was afraid that my DH wouldn't like it as he is not a big cran-fan, but he loved it.  I didn't bother with the sauteing bit, but just chopped an onion fairly small, pressed a couple of cloves of garlic, mixed everything up and poured it over the chicken.  I used legs and boneless breasts and I was astonished at how juicy the breasts were!  I lined my dish with non-stick foil so clean up was a snap. This is so easy to put together and it is definitely going in my "keeper" file.  Thanks, DeidreDee!

As mentioned by others, the sauce slid off the chicken and never thickened.  Bummer! Also, the flavor combination didn't WOW me like I expected.  The leftovers sat around.

Very good.  I omitted the celery and onion and used celery seed and onion powder instead due to family preference.  Served over rice.  Would recommend highly.

Yummy sauce!  The BBQ sauce, cranberry sauce, and onions are wonderful combination.  Took others’ advice and lined pan with foil.  Also, I covered pan with foil, so no basting necessary.  However, I do think this prevented sauce from sticking to chicken (if it was supposed to).  No problem, though--when chicken was ready, there was a lot sauce in the pan to put in gravy bowl and pour over chicken at the table.  I was in a hurry, so cooked chicken (boneless, skinless breasts and thighs) at 375 for one hour.  Next time will try cooking as directed in recipe.

Amazing dish. I recieve nothing but rave reviews everytime I make this dish. I have even had it requested on numerous occasions. I actually cooked it without the celery and I only baste every 20-30 minutes. Excellent.

This was a great, different dish! I wasn't sure how it would turn out given the unique ingredients, and my husband was especially skeptical. But it turned out really good, I followed the recipes, except I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cooked for a little less than 90 min. It's a repeater!

This one is a keeper for us!  Very tasty and sticks well to the chicken.  A lot of flavor and the left overs are just as good.  I cover with aluminum foil so they don't dry out.

First time making, I made with boneless chicken breasts, and baked for about 40 min in a dish where the chicken was 75% covered by the sauce.  Fantastic!  Second time (days later) I made again and baked in a smaller dish where the chicken was completely submerged.  This time, the sauce was too thin.  Flavor was still divine but I enjoyed the thicker sticky outcome of the first so from now on, I'll be sure to use a larger dish for baking.  Could be my newest favorite chicken!

This recipe was really good!  I used chicken breasts and didn't bother cutting them up.  I also added some hot sauce to it.  The breasts got to temperature in less than an hour.  It reminded my husband and me of some kind of asain food (the sweet with the salty).  It makes a lot of sauce.. will serve over rice and add some chopped carrots to it next time.

This was pretty good.  There was a lot of sauce left over that I put in the freezer to add to another dinner when I'm running low on time.  Used whole-berry cranberry sauce and I think that really added to the "personality" of this dish...

I omitted the celery since I didn't have any and deglazed the pan with a little chicken broth after sauteeing the onions to get all the goodness from the bottom of the pan. Used regular "Bullseye" bbq sauce.  Boyfriend told me THREE times how good it was!  He is "Mr. Sauce" and absolutely couldn't get enough!   I am definitely going to make this recipe with ribs next time!

I made it using wing parts, it was so delish, my hubby couldnt get enough. It was fast and so simple to make.  The cranberry sauce gave it a thicker consistency (sauce).

Five stars for ease of use and taste.  Like others, lined pan w/foil, topped with foil so no basting.  Used breasts and served to six easily in one pan.  Husband and especially kids (yeah) really liked it!

I put everything (except the celery, which I left out) into the crockpot and cooked it on low for approximately seven hours.  I used four boneless, skinless chicken breasts and added about a teaspoon of minced garlic.  I thought it was pretty good and very easy to make.

Oh my god! To die for! My roomates are licking the plate every time I make this. (They are tough critics as well.) Everyone gathers around the oven and breaths in the sauce smell and sighs in anticipation of dinner time! We have a big serving bown with the extra sauce frrom the pan we drench the rest of our food in, it's that good!

Very good and nice change.  I used boneless, skinless chicken and my own cranberry sauce (no onions or celery).  I also covered with foil so no basting.

Used boneless/skinless chicken thighs, and covered w/foil as another person did:  No basting.  Placed foil on bottom of dish to avoid the scrubbing others had commented upon.  My boyfriend doesn't like cranberries, and I'm not fond of bbq sauce--the combo was very tasty with neither ingredient overpowering the other.  However,next time I'll cut back to 3/4 cup of bbq sauce due to overall sweetness, and omit the celery (didn't notice any of that flavour).  I don't think you can overcook this dish (w/dark meat, covered).  Baked at 300 for two hours, then it sat in warm oven for 30 minutes:  Extremely tender, and not needing to dine by a certain time, due to an entree's cooking period, was great!

My husband and I give this recipe high marks! In fact, he raved about this chicken all during dinner. It has just the right blend of tangy/sweet. My only problem with it was that 90 minutes cooking time may be too long for my oven, as there was a little burned sauce. However, I caught it in time and nothing was ruined! This one is definitely a keeper! Next time I may even serve it to company!

I'm giving this 3 stars as I thought it was quite tasty but my husband thought it was way too SWEET.  If you (&/or your family) like entrees that are sweet (like recipes with pineapple or marshmellows), you'll love this.  If not, don't bother.

Soo good. I cut chicken into strips and put everything in the crockpot. I added garlic and half a bag of fresh cranberries. Boy did it look festive over rice. The berries also added an extra zing to it. 5 Stars

This was an outstanding version of BBQ Chicken.  I used skinless/boneless breast and they were very tender and juicy!!  I will never go back to plain bottle BBQ Chicken again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of the best recipes I've made from this website! Followed instructions exactly. I covered the chicken in the oven and removed the lid for the last 20 minutes, which made the top a little crunchy.

Grilled, not baked. Turned out very moist and tender. Used a sweet bbq sause and whole cranberries from the can. 

Saved a little sauce and drizzled it over the finished chicken. 

Awesome. Thanks for sharing!

I couldn’t find my old cranberry chicken recipe and I came across this. I went by other reviews, but didn’t  have any spicy BBQ sauce, so I used about 1/2c Sweet Baby Rays and spiced it up a bit with some wing sauce. Used chicken breasts that I had seared- placed them on top of some stuffing with onions, celery, & walnuts in it & spooned this over the top. Fantastic!

This is an excellent recipe. It was so delicious. I have a sweet tooth and it was a little too sweet, even for me. Next time I’d try using a reduced sugar cranberry sauce or BBQ sauce if I can find one. Otherwise it was fantastic and a great Fall dish. Loved it!!

This was really good as is. I did add a little cayenne because the husband likes some heat. Very easy to make and the flavors melded beautifully.

After reading other reviewers,  I 'spiced' up my BBQ sauce with some red pepper flakes and chili powder. Instead of whole chicken,  used thighs with  skin removed. Dish was a hit w/ hubby and in-laws. Will be making again.

My family and I enjoied this recipe. I would say that the ingredients and the directions were a tad off.  When preheat oven, I prefer to set the oven at "450 degrees F"  instead of "350 degrees F". The only why I did this was because my chicken was not completely well done after cooking it on top of the stove. And if set to "450 degrees F", chicken maybe done before the "90 minutes" is up.  Instead using  "1 cup of barbecue sauce", personally, I used at least "1/4 or 1/2 a cup of barbecue sauce". The best thing for me was to "taste as you pour". I started off with 1/4 cup to make sure that the barbecue sauce won't override the cranberry sauce. Also, I added "1 Tablespoons of ginger root (minced)" to the  recipe to give it a little sweet&tangy after-taste. The ginger root can sauted w/ the onions and celery.

I made this recipe tonight. I did change the method on how I cooked it. I normally like to read the reviews first to see how everyone overall felt on the dish then I decide from there my own twist. One of the reviews read that she made it in the crock pot so I decided to take that method on, especially since the boyfriend got a crock pot for Christmas. Instead of cranberry sauce in a can I decided to make my own homemade sauce and I did add a bit of spice to it as well and from then on out followed the recipe. The spiciness helped balance out the sweet of the cranberry and bbq and gave it a bit of a kick. The chicken came out juicy and delicious, only downside was all the leftover sauce from it. Overall great recipe.

Even my boyfriend who is not a cranberry fan loved it!  I also made my own BBQ and Cranberry sauces (super easy and saved me a trip to the store!).  YUM!!!!  This will be on the rotation....I am thinking of crock pot possibilities for this one!

The chicken got a high score with my husband. The cranberries and celery are great together. I thought the sauce was pretty good and the random bite of full cranberry was a great touch. I thought the chicken itself might have been a little under flavored so I marinated it a few hours in bbq sauce and cranberry sauce and then added the rest as the recipe said.  Hubbs requests that I cook this again some time and I will...but I'll season the meat and marinate it first before following the other directions.

Exactly what everyone says just follow instructions so good ! Even my 3 year old was asking for seconds wouldn't change a thing although I was a bit confused on getting the chicken brown so I just let it set for 12 mins then 12 mins on the other turned out so great!!!!!

Made this for Christmas and did not make any change to the recipe. Delicious! I recommend bone-in chicken breasts (not boneless) as they make the chicken even more juicy. Will make again!

This recipe is a great use of cranberry without screaming Thanksgiving at you. My kids love it and so do their friends staying for dinner (their moms called for the recipe) I've also baked cubes of tofu ( once it's puffed up) I've added the cranberry BBQ sauce over it for my vegetarian child

This was very good. I think I expected it to be an interesting flavor combination, it just tasted like bbq chicken though. I used a spicy bbq sauce. Didn't bother using a whole chicken, just a package of chicken legs. After cooking, I put the sauce back in the skillet and reduced it to a better thickness. I didn't like biting into the whole cranberries, if I made it again, I'd just use jellied.

I followed the recipe, except didn’t add celery.  It was delicious.  This is my new favourite chicken recipe.  I covered with foil the first 30 minutes, then baked another 30 minutes uncovered.  It was perfect.  Very juicy, great sauce, and very easy prep.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Used frozen cranberries that I cooked down with water and some sugar prior to adding as directed to some chicken legs (which took less time to cook in the oven).  We liked it and will try it again.

This was delicious!! I used Trader Joe's Cranberry Orange Relish instead of the cranberry sauce. The meat literally fell right off the bone. It was full of flavor all the way through. My husband loved it - the kids, not so much, but likely because of the texture of the outside. Will make again!

Tried this recipe to use up some leftover whole cranberry sauce (we only used a couple of tablespoons for another recipe the day before). I adapted the recipe to use my crock pot. Used two large chicken breasts, mixed all sauce ingredients (except the butter- which I forgot) then dumped on the chicken. Cooked for approximately 10 hours on low (because that's how long we were gone). Could have served as it was, but we ended up shredding the chicken and adding back to the sauce.  This time we served it with mashed potatoes and corn. Overall we were very pleased and we will have it again. Would also make fantastic sliders.

This is an excellent recipe.  I didn't change a thing, except, after cooking for about 1 hour with basting, my husband finished by putting it on the grill.  This was the best chicken recipe I have ever made.  It is easy and delicious.  My family doesn't like cranberry's, but I used cranberry sauce (not whole berry) and it was so good.  I will continue to make this recipe over and over again.  I made a homemade BBQ sauce that made this exceptional.  Thanks for this recipe.

Used boneless skinless chicken breasts cut in half lenght wise (very large), reduced cook time by 1/2 and covered with foil.  Good but needed to reduce the cook time by maybe 10 more minutes, chicken was slightly over cooked.  However super easy and very tasty.

Pretty good, but I wouldn't buy cranberry sauce or barbecue sauce especially for this dish.  Good if you have leftovers though - use 'em up.  :)

Delicious chicken!  I poured the sauce over frozen chicken breasts and let cook at 375 degrees for one hour.  The family loved it.  It''s a great recipe for an easy dinner.

I thought this was great.  A little bit of zip from the BBQ sauce I used was just perfect for us. I served it with bread stuffing and green beans.  Not a bad substitute when you are craving the taste of that Thanksgiving meal but it's only October.

Very good and easy. I made it with 5 chicken thighs with skin removed. Could have added one more piece as there was plenty of sauce.

I made this recipe with chicken thighs because that was all I had at the last minute. I didn't change anything else in the recipe and it turned out great! I rounded out the menu with garlic green beans and buttermilk mashed potatoes. My husband went on and on about how delicious it was. He even finished off the leftovers during lunch the next day - and this is a man who normally hates leftovers. He couldn't get enough! This is our new favorite BBQ Chicken recipe and I'll definitely be making it again. Thanks!

Goes great served with mashed potatoes.

I was all set to make this recipe when I realized that I didn't have any cranberry sauce so I substituted apricot preserves.  I have to say it was pretty good.  I can't wait to make this with the cranberry sauce.  The bonus to this recipe is my house smelled sooo good!

Outstanding!  Great flavor.  I've made the barbecue sauce from scratch, as well, and it's wonderful.  However, bottled sauce works very well in this dish. Other than the barbecue sauce, I don't deviate from the recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  I did not fry in a pan to brown, instead I browned it in the broiler, then added the sauce.  Next time I will add the breasts a little bit later so that they are more moist.

This chicken recipe was wonderful, if fell right off the bone and was juicy and flavorful.  As others suggested, I baked the chicken pieces in tin foil and left out the celery (as a personal preference).  Yum!  I will make this one again soon.

Great- whole family loved it! I made it easier by not browning the chicken first- I just put it in the pan & poured the mixture of cranberry sauce & BBQ sauce over. (omitting onion & celery) Covered with foil the first half of baking time. No need to mess with basting. Be careful choosing BBQ sauce- mine was a little spicy. Thanks for submitting!

I really liked it, I didnt tell my bf that there were cranberries in it, he doesnt tend to like them very much.  But he loved the chicken, and he finally figured out that there were cranberries in it when he saw what he thought were "grapes" in the dish.  Loved it though!

This is absolutely delicious!  I first made this for a Valentine's Dinner at my church.  We love it so much, my husband gets mad if he's not around when I bake it.  I simplified it alot... cover with aluminum foil so i dont have to baste.  And I left out all the extras.  Just chicken, BBQ sauce and cranberry sauce.  5 stars!

I made this chicken last night, and it was delicious.  My husband is a white meat man, so I made both.  The dark meat pieces were definitely tastier.  If not for him I would have used only dark meat for this recipe.  It was falling off the bone.

I am not a lover of bbq sauce but this had a much milder flavor that was great.

I was very curious about the combination of ingredients in this recipe - it wasn't like anything I had ever made before.  My husband and I were pleasantly surprised at the outcome.  The flavors blended together well during baking.  It's also easy to prepare; however, it takes some time to bake.  One note: I took it out of the oven ten minutes early, and some of the sauce was already burned onto the dish.

Delicious!  I will definitely make this one again.  The flavors are great and it is easy to get started.  I used chicken thighs and a lot of sauce.  Since the chicken were immersed in the gravy, I did not need to baste making this recipe nearly hasle free.

My 9 year old daughter helped me make this easy dish and my entire family raved!  I have 3 boys beside my daughter and I have a very hard time finding something that ALL three like...this one did the trick!

This was very easy to make and delicious.  Just the right combination of sweet and tart.  I bought a fryer chicken and cut the pieces even smaller, reducing the cooking time to 1 hour.

Easy and tasty!  Bound to become a "regular" in our house.

This was sooooo good! I didn't use celery because I didn't have any and it was still good. I am not a big fan of onions so I didn't use a whole onion, I used only two slices, chopped. Still good. I used the cranberry sauce with the berries in and service it w/ mash potatoes and Stuffing, it was the next best thing to Thanksgiving dinner.

Good, quick, sweet sauce.  I substituted bell pepper for celery and basted cheap bone in chicken while BBQing.  Excellent.
