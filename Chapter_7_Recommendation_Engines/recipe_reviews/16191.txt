I used 3 tsp. of ground cumin and 2 x-large or 3 small garlic cloves, minced. Plus I added 1 tsp garlic powder. Also, 1 Green Pablano Chile instead of 2 jalapenos makes this recipe child friendly. I love this recipe though! Thanks Mike

my whole family really enjoyed this, I cooked it in the pan like it said and then threw it all together in my crock pot and went Christmas shopping and after a long day we came home to the wonderful aroma and all we had to do was fix our plates.  How wonderful was that??? only downfall was it wasn't as spicy as I woudl have liked so next time I will add an extra jalepeno.

Yes, this was unlike any other Carne Guisada I had ever had. Much more tomatoey. But what ever you call it, it is absolutely delicious. I will cook it over and over again. I served it with flour tortillas and it was a huge hit with my family. You must like tomaotes! I omited the shortening and just used Pam cooking spray. After living in South Texas for many years this was a refreshing version of Carne Guisada.

I used this recipe as a starting point.  Used about 3lbs of wild pork instead of beef, 2 1/2 tsps cumin, 1 tsp chili powder, and a can of Rotel tomatoes & chilis instead of the fresh tomatoes.   It was awesome!  Note: If you omit the cumin, it AIN'T Carne Guisada!

One of my favorite recipes....I make this as printed and we all love it.  Delicious.......updated!  I just made this again and I used the can of rotel tomatoes instead of the fresh ones and I also added Chili powder and a tad bit extra cumin.  I also cut up the stewed tomatoes.  Thanks for posting this recipe

I've had this dish served in Texas in many places known for Carne Guisada and this recipe doesn't even resemble it.   I followed the directions to the letter, but was tough and the dish on the whole was bland and runny. I tried to thicken it up some with arrowroot and water but that just made it slimy.   I hate to say it, but look elsewhere for a passable version of this dish; I know I shall. You just cannot get slow-cooked/braised tenderness in 30-60 mins.

This is a Really good recipe! I let it simmer for about an hour and a half. But, I'm sure just an hour would be ok : ) my husband and 8 year old really like it when I make this recipe!

Awesome!  Though it is a little hot.  If you want it less so, use 1 jalapeno instead of 2.  I served this with corn tortillas and I loved it.

It was a good recipe. I think it needed a little more pazaaz. Perhaps some cilantro and bell peppers would give it that little boost.

A great recipe. i had to add 3 more cloves of garlic and a whole teaspoon of cumin. Took more like 2 hours for the meat to be really tender.

My husband and I liked this a lot. I used a little bit of tomato sauce as well as chopped tomatoes. And I also let it simmer for about 2.5 hours and the meat was very tender. It was pretty good!

Really good but a little too much tomato. I also added chicken tomato bouillon for more flavor.

Great Mexican-inspired everyday dish. I used olive oil instead of shortning and only one chili - my Mother really isn't that big fan of the hot and spicy. It has an excellent taste and texture - and a definite plus - Carne Guisada I is SO easy and quick to make.

This was like a Mexican Hungarian goulash. Mmm. I served it over rice. To get the stew meat tender, I simmered it on the stove for at least an hour, and then cooked it on low in the crockpot for 4-5 hours. I'll make this again.

Yummy. I added a little more cumin and a extra tomato cause I needed to use it before it went bad. Had a good flavor. I mead refried beans and spanish rice to go with it and we used it as burrito filling, but think it would be good just over some rice as well.

This turned out good but too tomatoey for my tastes. I thought it was bland but my husband and the guys at his work loved it. I used diced jalapeno from a jar (2 spoons full) and simmered this for about 4 hours. I doubled the comino because I wasn't paying attention, but it turned out fine. Not my favorite recipe for Carne Guisada, but it was okay. Thanks.

Sorry, but I can only give this 3 stars.  I followed the recipe with only 1 small change, using a can of diced tomatoes with chipotles instead of stewed tomatoes.  Even adding the chipotles, this was way too mild on the heat scale.  But my main complaint was the overwhelming tomato flavor.  A can of tomatoes, plus 2 chopped tomatoes (and I only used 2 med roma's) overpowered the dish.  I will keep looking for my go-to carne guisada recipe.

Very Good! Cooked on stovetop for about 2 hours on medium heat & turned out more tender than I expected. To me, the jalapenos didn't seem to add much heat.  I think the red pepper flakes sound like a good idea. The boyfriend loved it!

I made this recipe last night with some changes that were suggested.
I will make this again.
I didn't add any water, and I used two cans of tomatoes (one cilantro,and lime seasoned). I didn't use any fresh tomatoes.
I did add 1/2 pkg. of taco seasoning, which I might add the whole thing next time.
I also used olive oil instead of shortening.
We served them with shredded cheese, and flour tortillas, which was very good. I forgot to buy lettuce, which I would do next time, along with black olives and maybe some fresh tomatoes.
This would be very good with pork!

This is about the best recipe i've come across in a while!  Reminded me of the sauce from my other favorite - Saucy Beef Kabobs.  Served this over rice - can't wait to make it again!

This was a wonderfully easy and tasty recipe. Just the dish I was looking for! Since I didn't have on hand all the seasonings listed I instead used a couple of tablespoons of Mrs. Dash Extra Spicy Seasoning Blend. It turned out just great!

Very tasty. I also added some hot red pepper flakes to make it a little spicier.

This was just eh.. After all the rave reviews I expected more. I make mexican dished quite often, and am not sure what would have helped this dish. I'm sure there are better ones out there. I did have to simmer it for about 6 hours in the crockpot for the meat to be tender. Also added a habanero for some extra heat. Don't think I'll make this one again.

OK - this was delicious and easy! I didn't seem to have much gravy but that was fine because it would've been too soupy to put in our corn tortillas. I simmered for more like 3 or 4 hours though because at 1 hour the meat was still tough. I also didn't put in the fresh tomatoes - I put them over the finished product with a little sour cream. Great dish - will be making again. Maybe I'll try it in the crockpot next time!

This recipe was quick, but too many tomatoes and not enough authentic mexican flavor. I was raised on this type of food so I may be a bit spoiled.

I used canned chipotle peppers in sauce instead of the fresh jalepenos. It was spicy, but the family loved it! We ate it with rice and beans on tortillas.

My husband really enjoyed this and I think it was even better the next day as leftovers.  I too added chopped bell pepper rather than the second tomato and let it simmer for almost two hours. I will be making this again.

I was not real impressed with this dish. I was born and raised in Texas and this is not like any carne guisada I've ever had! I think the recipe calls for too many tomatoes. It was edible, but that's about all I can say about it!

This stew is average at best.  It's hearty and tastes well enough, but it's not something I'd go out of my way to make again.  To be better I think it needs more herbs and spices - though that may take the "mexicanity" out of it.  I'd add some oregano, paprika, more garlic (or garlic powder), maybe a pinch of sugar and bay leaves.  As it is, I won't make it again.

YUM!!! We omitted the fresh tomatoes, and added a bell pepper to this recipe. We served over rice and in tortillas with guacamole.

Very good! I served it with flour tortillas, sour cream, and salsa.
