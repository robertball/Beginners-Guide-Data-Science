Mozzarella cheese doesn't really have much flavor.  I don't consider this a Reuben sandwich since it doesn't have Swiss cheese and Thousand Island dressing.  It has a nice little flavor in itself, but true Reuben lovers will know something's missing.

The mozzarella does not compliment the corned beef...swiss cheese is really the best way to go.

We had these last night and we love the mozzarella vs. the swiss cheese!  I'm not a fan of swiss (hubby's not a fan of cheese period), so I would have subbed mozz. or provolone anyway.  Don't forget the thousand island & horseradish!  Thanks Roy!

Have had many "Reuben's" and this is an excellent variation on the theme. Lacking the 1000 island and horseradish, I've improvised with Deli-style mustard.

I am not a fan of the Reuben, but I loved this recipe. I have made it several times and have not changed a thing.  My husband and son, who are fans of the Reuben, also gave this 5 stars.  Thanks for sharing a recipe that I was willing to make and eat.

This recipe was very good. We don't often eat Reuben Sandwiches, but this paired with French Onion soup turned out amazing. We did add a little spicy horseradish sauce to the bread in the process. So good my hubby went back for seconds!

This was good!.. I made my own corned beef; I also liked the mellow taste of the mozzarella cheese verses the strong flavor of Swiss!.. I sliced it as thin as I could.  DH put sourkraut on his and I put coleslaw on mine!.. Grilled to perfection! Delicious!..

It really didn't taste that great too me. Seemed like it was missing something. I followed it exactly.

I loved this sandwich, I modified it by cooking 6 onz of halal corned beef( cut in 3 slices & drained the fat ), I also cooked rapidly the drained sauerkraut( aproximately 4 onz ).

Also used about 4 onz grated swiss cheese

I used mao & octoberfest mustard

The rest is unchanged

Of course serve it with a kosher pickle

A real big sandwich :)

PS I wish I had the real vinaigrette to go with it

This is how we make it. But we always use SWISS Cheese. Sometimes dark rye, sometimes light rye bread. I also put mustard out because some people like to dip them in it. I also have a Panni grill I use, if I want to be more fancy!
