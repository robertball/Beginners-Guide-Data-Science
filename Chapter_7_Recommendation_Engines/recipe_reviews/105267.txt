YUMMY!!!! Of course, I made some changes. I only need half of this recipe so I halfed it. I only used ground beef and I left out the sausage. That way, I wouldn't have half a pound of sausage and ground beef left over. I also only used 8 oz of swiss cheese and I shredded it. I used whole wheat egg noodles and no one knew. It was so good. The whole family loved it. The only thing I would change would be the cooking instructions. I would cover it and cook for 30 min. and uncover it the last 5 min of cooking. My noodles got a little crunchy and dried out during the baking.

This was so easy to make and very awesome!  My husband doesn't like spaghetti and I thought it was going to be like that - but he loved it!  Thanks for sharing!

I also only needed 1/2 of the recipe, but i used 1/2 beef and 1/2 pork sausage. The sausage is important for the flavor that you want. The other 1/2 pounds of meat make great meat balls when mixed together. I also think gratted cheese is better than sliced. You do need to cover at first, then bake uncovered for the last part.This is great and easy. We truly enjoyed it.

I've used many recipes on this site but always ones with many reviews already, so I've never added to those.  Until now!  I wanted to be sure to throw my two cents in to say that I Loved this!!  Adding swiss cheese rather than cheddar to a hamburger casserole was a whole new concept.  YUM!  I had to make myself stop eating it.  :)   Based on a couple other reviews, I did used grated swiss and that worked well.  Also covered with foil at least 3/4 of the baking time.  Uncovered for 5-10 minutes at the end because I actually like having a little crunch on some of the noodles on the top.  Onions and garlic are a must for me in a casserole, so I sauteed those and then added the ground beef and sausage.  Very yummy recipe - a keeper!!

One of my favorite recipes to cook!!!! I have used both beef and sausage and I have also used just sausage. Keep an eye on the noodles and cheese when cooking, around the edges they can become very crunchy.

We thought this was a very good simple weeknight dinner. My son thought the swiss cheese gave it a somewhat odd taste, but my husband said it was good. I halved the recipe and used shredded cheese instead of sliced.
