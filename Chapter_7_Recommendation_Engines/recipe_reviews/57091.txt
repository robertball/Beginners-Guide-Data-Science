This is the recipe I've also had and it is so easy. The results are great.  I've filled mine with nutella, honey cinnamon & walnuts, apricot preserves. That is 3 separate batches not all on one!  Get creative, but keep the filling thin or it will ooze and stick.   Glad I have an easy place to find this now, instead of digging through my index card recipes!

Enjoyed this recipe. The dough, though insanely sitcky so use flour on all surfaces, was gorgeous. It was so silky and smooth. I think the filling overpowered the dough a little, but still delicious.     Might try it again with a lighter preserve like an orange or lemon. I also wonder if the dough could be used for savory recipes since it contains no sugar? Might have to experiment with that.     Also: Would be fun to make with kids if you dont mind washing sticky fingers afterward. The construction part is like making little pizzas. Very enjoyable.
