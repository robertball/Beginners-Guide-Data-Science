I didn't expect to love this due to the cloves but I'm here to tell you this was excellent and went perfectly with my kabobs!

EXCELLENT!!!  I’ve been looking for a restaurant-style spiced basmati recipe for a while now and THIS IS IT!!!  Soooooooo delicious and satisfying!  I made it as written except I used brown basmati rice and had to use cumin powder rather than the seeds, as I didn’t have any.  Worked just fine!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!
