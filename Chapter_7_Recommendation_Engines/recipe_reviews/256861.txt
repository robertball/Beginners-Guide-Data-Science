This recipe was just not for me; I didn't like the texture of the quinoa. I looked at other recipes after trying this one, and they all simmer for a longer time with the lid on. They all also use milk in the recipe. I added about 2 tablespoons honey. I'm not sure if it was just the method of this recipe or if breakfast quinoa is just not for me.

I made this recipe to use up leftover quinoa. I chopped up some leftover peanuts and walnuts. I didn't have any dried fruit, so I used canned peaches. I also found that the recipe needed more juice, so I dumped in the whole can, juice and all. I then added honey, sugar and milk. It was good, and I liked the nutty texture for the guys. Thank you!
