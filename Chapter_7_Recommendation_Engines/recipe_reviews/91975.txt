Very good, easy, substantial and filling.
I used canned tomatoes in place of pasta sauce and found it gave a very pleasing flavor.
We will have this again.

Since my family does not like sausage(only me) I had to make this using ground meat and marinara sauceand it was great.

My husband, my 10 year old son, and I loved it.  Served with cheesy bread.  We will have again for sure.
