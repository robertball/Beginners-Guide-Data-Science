Always looking for gluten-free recipes that don't require lots of processed foods.    Love this recipe.    Even my processed-food-oriented family loves this.   The lime juice makes it bright, while currants make it a little sweet.

I just made this recipe for a road trip.  I wanted something that would be easy to keep, healthy and not a mess in the car.  (I was not driving and eating.)  I was shocked when this recipe turned out to be one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten.  I will be making this recipe a lot more often.

I'm completely addicted to this dish and am embarrassed to admit I make double the amount because I eat it myself throughout the entire week (I can easily wolf down 2 bowls in each sitting).  In either case I didn't change a thing and LOVE this dish.  My most favorite one thus far!  Thank you for sharing!

This was just okay. I found there were too many competing flavors. The cumin didn't meld well with the mint or currants.  I won't be making this again.

I didn’t have high hopes, but needed to burn through some quinoa so gave it a shot. Turned out waaaay more delicious than I ever would have expected and even our unadventurous-eating seven year-old happily ate it! I used normal raisins and cut them up a little for the currants, ran out of lime juice so swapped in lemon, and grilled some onions up when I realized I’d forgotten to grab green onions. Still worked just fine!

Yummy! Tried the exact recipe & blended the parsley etc in a magic bullet. Next time will not pulverize the fresh herbs.....FYI once cooked the quinoa ends up being 2 c.

I made it exactly as the recipe said although I tripled the batch.  I LOVE it and plan to have it on hand in my fridge every day.  I love to tangy currants, lime and parsley blend.

I  made it for company....a BIG hit!
Thanks!

Doubled recipe.  Added 2 cloves garlic and  4 fresh limes in dressing, and cherry tomatoes in quinoa mix.  I also used organic red quinoa.
