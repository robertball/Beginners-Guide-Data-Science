Great recipe - perfect marriage of sweet and salty! Like most everyone else I made my usual French Toast for these adding in some milk, a bit of sugar, some vanilla, cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg to the beaten eggs. Once the sandwiches were assembled I used REAL maple syrup on the side to dip them into - not something I'd make everyday but overall very tasty.

I thought this was a great recipe! It was really easy to make and tasted awesome. I added some vanilla and cinnamon to the beated eggs. I aslo sprinkled some powdered sugar over sandwiches when I was done.

I thought this was a great idea!  I did make my 'normal' French toast adding milk, cinnamon, sugar, and a little flour to the beaten eggs.  I broke the bacon into pieces to make it easier to cut and just to add a little more fat; I added a pat of butter to the top to melt before drizzling with syrup.  Thanks Amber, for this neat idea!

I made this for brunch yesterday....my family loved it! I did change it up a bit. For the french toast, I combined evaporated milk, pure vanilla, eggs & cinnamon. For the sandwich, I layered eggs, bacon and american cheese. We dipped our sandwiches in maple syrup. Not very healthy and a bit messy, but oh so good!!***I made this again... this time for guests. I used turkey sausage, rather than bacon and I poured the syrup on top of the sausage, before putting the sandwich together. Everyone loved it! My husband and I thought it was even better than the first.

Well I love eggs.  I love bacon.  And I love french toast.  I do suggest sweetening the batter somewhat.  Overall, I do love this recipe.

This tasted the best when you got a bite of the toast, bacon, egg and syrup all at once.  It reminds me a little of the McGriddle sandwhiches at McDonalds -- I do think it's better than those!

I made these for lunch today, and we gobbled them up.  I added an extra egg, and next time I will just make the 2, I also added cinnamon and vanilla.  I omitted the syrup because I didn't want the mess with my son, but it was missed and I am adding it next time, and there will be a next time!!  Thank you!!

I made this as written for Husband as, unlike me, he likes maple syrup on meat. I made mine with a slice of American cheese between the bacon and fried egg. Tasted great! Thanks!

I'm only giving this 4 stars because you really need to add a few things while making the french toast like milk, vanilla, and cinnamon sugar. If you add them things it's definatly a ***** recipe. I also like this because you could make the egg fried or scrambled and you can use ham or sausage instead of bacon. I didn't put the syrup on them because the kids wantd to eat them with their hands and that would have just made a huge mess that I would have had to clean up and syrup is hard to clean up off small kids.

The kids are out of school and expect me to cook breakfast.  They always ask for French Toast so I wanted to add a twist than the usual.  This was a hit.  They really enjoyed it.  I also topped with cinnamon and added vanilla to my mixture because that's the normal way I make my French Toast.  This was very good.

I preface my comments with this - I feel sorry for the women/men who have significant others that tell them "Don't make this again" or the people that say they have a significant "adult" partner that is a "picky" eater.  Cooking and serving food is all about diversity and enlightenment. Get tough guys and gals and grow a spine - indulge and try new things and explore what your taste buds are crying for.
This recipe is a treat for beginners trying new horizons for breakfast or any meal for the case.  It's easy and above all tasty.  Have at it and drink some champagne with it!!!

Oh my! this was delightful! I had a loaf of sourdough that I got at the market earlier today. I sliced 2 slices (1").  I added vanilla and cinnamon as others suggested. After I fried my maple bacon I dipped and fried the toast the fried the egg over medium. Mmm...in an attempt to save calories I used smuckers fat free syrup. It's great! Only 25 calories in 1/4 cup..... And you can't even tell.

The perfect complete little breakfast.  The only changes I made were to use English muffins and add a little milk in with the eggs to soak them in, and allowed extra time for the muffins to absorb the egg mixture. I loved the sweetness of the syrup with the saltiness of the bacon.     Yummy.

What a great and very different sandwich Amber! As others, I threw a bit of cinnamon and vanilla into my egg mixture. Didn't have any bacon in the house so I subbed with Taylor Ham (pork roll). A little drizzle of maple syrup gave just a touch of sweetness to the dish. Perfect and hearty breakfast for my hubby before venturing out to shovel the fourteen inches of snow that fell last night. We Jersey girls/guys were certainly due! Thanks Amber!!

LOVE these sandwiches! I pour the syrup onto the egg instead of on top so that I can eat it like a sandwich. I also like to add some cheese.

Oh wow! This is Soooo tasty. I love french toast and bacon with syrup, and didn't think it could get any better. I was so wrong, this is the ultimate breakfast "sandwich". Gotta use a knife and fork on this one. Thanks Amber, loved it!

My boyfriend LOVES when I make this for him :) He tells everyone how amazing it is, and insists that they try it. My little sister, and Mom, love it also--I try not to make it too often so it still has that pizaaz effect :P

We really liked these because they are made with our favorite breakfast foods.  We used leftover ham instead of bacon, and added some cheese to the scrambled eggs.  Yummy!

Delicious! And so easy too! I followed a friend’s suggestion and baked my bacon in the oven (slightly overlapping each piece so they don’t curl). Everything else I cooked on the griddle. Very very yummy! Thanks so much for sharing!

This is really tasty! It does need a little sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla in the beaten egg mixture to make the French toast. You can also use real bacon bits or cooked and crumbled sausage. The bacon bits really make it a snap since it is one less step in the recipe. It tastes just as good. This can also be an open-faced sandwich if you want to cut back on your bread intake. Just use a knife and fork to cut and eat it. We will certainly have this again! Thanks for the great recipe!

We enjoyed this breakfast sandwich.  Made this as written only we heated the maple syrup before adding it to the sandwich.  This is a nice weekend treat.

It was good, I had to use 4 eggs to make the french toast and I also added about a tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the egg mix for the french toast. I also used sugar free syrup on mine and my husband used regular, both were yummy.

This fit the bill. I wanted a quick lunch for the kids to pair with a fruit salad that I had leftover from breakfast.
To make things a little less messy, I added a little sugar and a tiny bit of vanilla extract and maple extract to the eggs before dipping in the bread. My kids flipped over these, claiming I was THE best mom. I gave them just a little homemade maple syrup on the side to dip their sandwiches in, which I had cut into quarter pieces. TIP: I used my circle biscuit cutter to help make a egg that would fit in the sandwich. For my kids, I broke the yolk while it was cooking to make it less messy for them.

I make this every fall and winter. My. Family of boys love a hearty breakfast sandwich and I made it with putting the maple syrup in the egg mixture and then when done I could slice it diagonally (this way they could pick it up like a sandwich ) and put a little extra syrup on the side for dunking.Great weekend breakfast.I also give their plates a dusting of powdered sugar.

Fantastic! I made mine with ham too, as another reviewer said. It was messy and filling and rich and sweet.
I poured the maple syrup (100% Grade B Amber ) on the bottom of a large plate first. Then built the sandwich. Cut it in half and used the big spatula to turn it over so both sides soaked up the syrup well. Yum. I meant to add a photo but i was halfway through eating it when I remembered. Oh well... try again another time. This one will be repeated.

We LOVED this! It is a great idea. The best thing about it -- I only used one pan! Cooked the bacon, then the eggs, and finally the french toast. Instead of using 2 eggs for the french toast, I used 3. And I also added cinnamon and vanilla to the eggs/milk. I also used 2 eggs per sandwich. It was very yummy!! Will definately make again. Thanks so much!

I'm adding my kudos for an excellent recipe.  Having no bacon I sliced up and fried an all-beef weiner in its place.  Maybe not quite as good but really enjoyable anyway.
As did others, I added a tiny bit of cinnamon, sugar and a dash of salt.  
However, when I get in some bacon, I'll try the recipe exactly as is - I think the bacon would make the difference.
Thanks for the recipe.

Yum, these were tasty.  I broiled the bacon for a slightly healthier version.

Good, although I used regular white Bread. I suggest Texas Toast. I left the bread in the Egg too long, came out a little soggy. Taste is fantastic.

I made this recipe as written - it was okay. That being said, I wish that I had read the reviews first on this recipe as it was definitely lacking "something?" I think my regular French Toast recipe, like so many others, would have made it better. Plus because bread slices are so much larger than the "Wonder Bread" days, I needed two eggs for each sandwich. :-) Will make it again with those changes as this makes a fast hardy breakfast (or dinner).

i love this!  It is good too  if using a Grands biscuit.  I have always loved bacon, honey biscuits.  French toast is inspired.

I didn't cook my egg in saved bacon grease, I thought it would be overkill ! I will definitely make again, but I am thinking of using coconut oil to cook French toast, and fry egg!!

I've done this often.  But, I also like to put 1 rounded tsp of sugar and a splash of vanilla in the egg mixture.     Ham or Canadian bacon works great here too.   I never use syrup, but that's just a personal like.

Not a fan of syrup, so I didn't put on mine,  otherwise, so so.  I'd rather have it all separate and with butter only on my French toast and don't muck it up with sugar or cinnamon either!  Nobody in the family went ohlala for this so doubt if we will make it again.

The recipe does not call for milk and sugar and cinnamon because it is not French Toast. It is more a Croque Monsieur or Croque Madame, which is a great breakfast sandwich. Nowhere, does the title call it French Toast. We loved it as written. But the second time I made it, I added a slice of Havarti and that was good too.

These are good but for some reason I like to taste my flavors separte on this one. Something about syrup on the eggs does'nt appeal to my taste buds. Bacon by itself...better.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a hit at our house.  I saw this come across my email today and immediately thought of the loaf of day old bread I had...stopped off at the store for the bacon and for less than $5.00 we had a wonderful dinner (I always have the other ingredients on hand.)   Got to love that!  Thank you!!

I like my food hot, not just kept warm. I start the bacon just before I start the toast, by the time the bacon is half done I start the eggs so everything gets done at the same time. Add the syrup and enjoy a nice, hot breakfast!

Mom used to make something similar to this. Sometimes I have had the urge to make a sandwich out it since Bacon, eggs and toast are a staple for me at least once a week. It's fun to invent new recipes! This one is no different except for the Cinnamon that I add to it!

I thought this was very good. I added milk & orange juice to the eggs for the french toast. Reminded me of a m*griddle, but better.
