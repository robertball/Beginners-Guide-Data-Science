I first grabbed this recipe in 2003 and have been making it ever since. I have made a few alterations/shortcuts I thought others might like to know. 1) I throw the chops in a marinade overnight of 2x apple juice to soy. The sweet and salt help make the chops even juicer. 2) I always make at least double if not 4 times the sauce or there is arguing... :) so when time is short or I just don't feel like peeling all those apples, I buy 2 cans of the higher priced pie filling and put that in the frying pan used for browning with a stick of butter.(scrape up the good bits.) It usually has the right amount of spices built right in so I just heat through. Arrange over top the chops in a baking pan. Bake covered in foil at 350 for 20-25 minutes. Remove foil - sprinkle with brown sugar and chopped pecans - bake 15 mins more for carmelize and crunch. DELICIOUS! Pairs great with butternut squash or sweet potatoes and corn or green beans. Homemade honey wheat bread is sure to disappear. I pour all pan juices over the servings for mopping. Every year when the weather turns cold here, the family starts asking "Is it time for apple pork chops??" :)

I was nervous after reading some of the reviews, whether or not to bake the chops in the oven or cook them in a pan as the recipe states. After talking to my butcher, I decided to bake them. I first tripled the sauce, and left it to simmer on the stove, covered, for about 30 minutes...I also added about 1 tbsp of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it. I then poured the sauce over the pork chops in a covered casserole dish and baked it all at 350 degrees for about 30-45 min. It came out wonderful! It was so tender; everyone loved it!

This is one of my husband's & kids' favourites.  I broil the chops in the oven instead (usually 5-6 minutes per side) and cook up the apples on the stovetop so that everything is ready at the same time. Granny Smiths seem to work best.  I don't use the oil, salt, pepper, or pecans. I just throw the sauce ingredients into the pan instead of premixing them in a bowl and slice the apples right into the pan. I don't waste time coring them.  I just take thin slices off all around the sides till I get to the core. I let it all thicken together instead of separating the apples from the sauce. Less steps& less dirty dishes with these shortcuts! We have it with steamed rice. Quick & Easy.

This was the tastiest and an easy way to make pork chops! I made some changes after reading some of the reviews.  I sauteed a sliced onion in the butter, then added the sauce ingredients (doubled) & the apple.  I added salt, pepper and garlic to the raw chops, placed them in a 9x13 pan, topped them with the sauce, and baked at 350 for an hour.  I made 2 batches of this since we were having dinner guests...they cancelled, so 8 pork chops disappeared amongst 3 of us! Hey, 1 is a teenage boy that usually won't eat pork chops. That's how good they are!  :)

Per previous reviews, I doubled the sauce but not the apples.  I also followed another recommendation and put the cooked pork chops in a 13x9 pan and then poured the sauce and apples over top and baked them for 1/2 hr.  This allowed me time to make the side dishes and have everything ready at the same time for dinner.

FABULOUS! Of course with the alterations I made I might as well submit a new recipe, but here is what I did. Forget the whole "oven thing" and use 2 skillets, one for the chops and one for the apples. For the chops, I marinated them in salt, pepper, 1 TBL minced garlic and about 1/4 c. sauterne (white) cooking wine for only about 15 minutes. I then sauteed them while making the sauce.  For the sauce, I sauteed 2 small onions in butter until carmelized. Then added the other sauce ingredients -doubled (except apples). I just cooked that till tender and thought it needed some more "juice" so I added about 1/4 c. of apple cider, then a pinch of cornstarch to thicken. Served chops over brown rice and sauce over chops, died and went to heaven. Also, picky boyfriend loved it ;-)

These were fabulous. My husband said they have usurped his old favorite for the best pork chops dish EVER! I made 6 chops but made enough sauce for 20. I sprinkled the chops w/ Paula Deen's house seasoning & sauteed them in butter & olive oil. Then I pretty much followed LadyJayPee's lead & sauteed an onion in the butter first, addng the apples ( I used 4 granny smiths) but only cooking them for a couple of minutes. I also added a couple of tbp. of apple cider vinegar to add a little more depth to the sauce. Then I poured everything over the chops, covered them & baked @ 350 degrees for about 30 minutes. Removed the foil & baked for another 10. Remembered just now, that I never added the pecans to the dish so if you don't have any...never fear, this dish is great w/out them.  Srved them, as suggested by the submitter, w/ smashed potatoes & green beans w/ Raspberry White Chocolate Mousse in chocolate cups for dessert. Thansk for a wonderful recipe Karena...will have again many times!

My husband said “This is worth 10 stars and how many times have you heard me say that?”  The answer is Never.  My picky 16 y.o. took one bite and said “This is the best thing I have ever eaten.”  Her friend said she didn’t like pork but would eat the rest of my meal.  I told her she had to have one bite.  She ended up eating a whole chop and said “My mom’s pork chops never taste like this.”  I did Brine my chops for 12 hours in 1qt apple juice, ¼ cup kosher salt, and ¼ cup brown sugar.  I *always* do this - it truly makes all the difference if you want moist chops.           Followed other reviewers - tripled the sauce and added a shot of Bourbon (YumO!!!).  I used an apple slicer (8 pieces per apple) and I used 4 apples for 4 1 1/2 thick chops.  I browned the seasoned chops on both sides, placed them in a casserole dish, poured the apple/sauce mixture on top and baked them at 425 for 20 minutes (internal temp 160).  I served these with a brown rice pilaf and roasted broccoli.

Good, but needed more kick to it.  I think it would be better if the pork was marinated before hand because it lacked flavor.  I also didn't end up with very much "sauce" at the end so perhaps you should double brown sugar mixture.

I really liked these.  My 17 month old was in a mood to not eat anything.  My husband liked the pork and sauce, but wouldn't try the apples.  I thought the apples were the best part.  The nice thing about this recipe is it looked so fancy, but was super easy to make.

I made two pork chops for two of us.  I sprinkled garlic powder & black pepper on the chops & sauteed them in olive oil, on medium-high heat, browning them for 5 minutes on each side, then placed them in a small baking dish.  In a separate skillet, I sauteed a medium chopped onion in (salted) butter.  After it was tender, I added a bit more butter to the skillet because the onion had absorbed most of it; added the brown sugar mixture (even with only 2 chops, I doubled the amount of the brown sugar mixture), and one thinly sliced Granny Smith apple; simmered that until apple was fairly tender (maybe 20 mins), adding a small smattering of kosher salt to the apple mix.  Poured ALL of this over the chops in the baking dish, covered with foil and baked at 350F for 50 minutes; then removed foil and baked for another 10 minutes. Topped with toasted pecan bits. The meat fell off the bone, the flavor combo of the onion/apple was wonderful, and the crunchy texture of the toasted pecans was great.  Would definitely make this again.

Just made this tonight.  It was wonderful!  The only change I made was to saute onions first and I doubled the apple brown sugar sauce. I also salted and peppered the pork before I cooked it. My 9 year old son gave it a 9.9 out of 10.

These were delicious!  I've been wanting to make this forever.  I did have to make a couple of changes because I put the chops in my slow cooker.  I only browned them in butter...did not fully cook, I used boneless ribeye chops 3/4 in thick.  I had a family pack (9)of them, so I scaled the sauce to 12.....I sliced about 6 apples but did not cook them in the sauce (didn't want to end up w/ apple mush).  I put the browned chops (seasoned well)in the crockpot, put the raw apple slices on top, and poured the caramel sauce over all.  Cooked on low for 4 hours, removed the apples and chops and thickened the sauce in the crockpot (High 10 min) with a cornstarch/apple juice slurry.  The sauce/gravy was wonderful!  Hubby even put it on his potatoes as well as chops and apples!  The apples reminded us of the fried apples at Cracker Barrel.  These were the most flavorful and moist pork chops I've ever fixed!!  My family was less than thrilled when I told them what was for supper, but they truly loved it and they ate so much, they didn't even leave room for cobbler for dessert :)  I served these w/ cheddar mashed potatoes and buttered green beans.  YUM!!  Will definately make again and again.  Thank you Karena!

Oh wow! Loved this. Really good comfort food – makes me think of cold winter days in front of a cozy fire. I did tweak the recipe a bit after reading the advice of some of the others. First I cut the cooking time and eliminated the oven, I just cooked it in two pans on the stove simultaneously. I marinated the pork chops over night in a 2x apple juice to 1x soy sauce mixture. Just before putting them in the pan I seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder to taste. With the apples, I doubled the sauce but found that two apples were plenty; I also doubled the cinnamon and added ground cloves and ground ginger. If you have finicky eaters, make sure and slice thick slices or pieces as the first time I made this the thin slices cooked enough to look like onions and I could NOT get some people to even taste them.

I'm not one for pork, but my husband is and he liked this one.  I read through the reviews before making it and did two very thick chops with about triple the sauce.  After browning them I put them in a baking dish, finished the sauce and baked them at 350 for about 35 minutes.  The sauce was pretty easy to thicken just by adding a little more brown sugar and some cornstarch.  I added some apple cider to the chops while they were browning and to the overall sauce.  Next time I think I will take the advice of others and marinate the pork first.  It had a nice flavor and you could cut it with a fork.

While pork and apples are a great combination; apples and caramel are even better in a sauce. I used boneless pork chops plus two large Granny Apples. I followed the recipe except I doubled the sauce and added about 1T of cornstarch to thicken it. I changed the cooking method a bit. I browned the pork chops in a skillet and then coated a baking pan with aluminum foil before putting in the pork chops. To the same pan I cooked the brown sugar mixture and apples down adding the 1T cornstarch. I layered the apples on top of the chops then I poured the remainder of sauce over the pork chops. I baked the chops covered in foil at 350 degrees for 25 minutes, then uncovered it and baked another 30 minutes. I spooned the sauce over apples and chops then sprinkled with the pecans and serve. The whole thing turned out melt-in-your-mouth goodness! The apples gave subtle sweetness without overpowering the pork chops and they were so tender and succulent. The sauce and apples are warm, lightly spiced and carmelized just right! The pecans added a nice crunch and it was the perfect touch to the dish. The meat was tender, flavorful and mouth-watering. I paired this with, “Roasted Sweet Potatoes with Onions, “ and “Green Beans with Walnuts,” also from this website.

I quickly felt full eating this. Next time, I will slice the apples thinner. I didn't get enough sauce and will double the amount next time. I cooked the apples first, then the chops.

This is the second time I made it, and this time I took the recommendations of others and baked it (instead of pan frying)....sssooooo much easier!  I added half a sliced onion and sauted it in the pan with the butter.  Then I added the brown sugar mixture (tripled the amount) and then added the apples.  I let that saute a few minutes while placing the pork chops in a baking dish.  Then I put the whole mixture on top, covered it with foil and baked for 40 minutes in a 350 degree oven.  I give it 4 1/2 stars.

Great flavor. I sauteed a chopped shallot in oil, then browned the chops in the pan. I removed them to a plate, and added the butter to melt, then stirred in the b.sugar, cinn, and nutmeg.  Added apples back to the pan, coated them well, and then put the chops back into the pan, covering them with the apple sauce. I covered the skillet, and baked @325 for 45 min.   PERFECT. The only thing I will do next time is to remove the chops just before serving, and pour the gravy into a oil-separator.  Then add back to the pan, and thicken it up a bit.  THEN...wow...hard to beat! My family loved it!

Love this recipe! First of all I always triple or quadruple the sauce.  My family loves the sauce. Secondly I usually make these in the oven. I make the sauce cover the chops with sauce and bake covered for about 30 minutes, then uncover and top with additional brown sugar and cook for about 15-20 more minutes. I also season the chops well before topping with sauce. Very tasty and easy recipe. I usually serve with rice and a veggie. Yummy!!

Delicious. I did as others suggested and marinated in salt, pepper, minced garlic, apple juice and a teensy bit of EVOO over night. To make it easier I broiled my chops for about 6 mins on each side--nothing worse than a grey chop!  I sauteed onions in butter for about 5 mins before adding the brown sugar mix/apple mix and then continued to cook them through in the sauce. I probably quadrupled the sauce because we LOVE sauce.   Finally, I cut my chops in to strips and threw in the skillet to soak up some sauce. This made it more like an apple pork stir fry and it WAS fabulous. The whole dinner took less than 30 mins to make. Yum!

This was great. Wasn't too sweet like the name implies. I did take the suggestion of another review and I sprinkled garlic powder, onion powder & black pepper on the chops & sauteed them in olive oil, on medium-high heat, browning them for 5 minutes on each side, then placed them in a small baking dish. In a separate skillet, I sauteed a medium chopped onion in (salted) butter. After it was tender, I added a bit more butter to the skillet because the onion had absorbed most of it; added the brown sugar mixture and one thinly sliced Granny Smith apple; simmered for a few minutes until the apples were barely tender. Poured ALL of this over the chops in the baking dish, covered with foil and baked at 350F for 40 minutes; then removed foil and baked for another 10 minutes. Topped with toasted pecan bits.

Absolutely delicious recipe!  My whole family LOVED it!  Since a couple people mentioned that there was not enough sauce, I made more sauce by adding about 1/4 cup applesauce, 1/2 can whole cranberry sauce, a little vanilla, and a little apple juice.  I look foward to making this dinner again.

I made a really yummy green bean side dish with this meal... I melted some butter with olive oil and fresh chopped garlic.  After about a minute I added some white wine vinegar.  Then I added the green beans, covered the pan, and steamed them until they were cooked.

This sauce was too good to be served on a common Pork Chop, so I substituted Pork Tenderloin for the chops. Very, very good. I suggest you double or triple the sauce and do not leave out the pecans. The result is a very unique and elegant meal.

Used some of the comments from other cooks.. marinated w/soy sauce & apple juice... after sauteing onions, browning pork chops, put all in baking dish, covered with apples and sauce (w/corn starch and apple juice added for thickening)..then foil.  Baked for 40 minutes at 375.  removed foli, sprinkled with chopped pecans and baked another 5min.   Came out wonderful.  Onions and apples were a nice compliment to the pork and the sauce was not too sweet.  I did double the sauce recipe.

Made this with Gala apples and left the peel on.  These were very good, a solid 4 star recipe, but I am giving it a 5 because the presentation factor.  This dish was beautiful - I wished we had company to see it.  Leaving the red skin on the apples really added to the visual appeal.  I will make this again and invite someone over to eat with us.  Super easy recipe, but looks WOW! - Edit: I have fixed this again twice now, here is my tip - toast the pecans in the skillet as it preheats then set aside.  Also, after you brush the chops with the oil, salt and pepper them.  If you don't s&p the chops, then they will be a bit bland, because you can't get enough S&P in the sauce for the whole dish without ruining the apples.  And most importantly - do not overcook the chops.  This has become a solid 5 star recipe in my house.

Fabulous recipe! I took the advice of some others and doubled the sauce (adding some chopped onion), and baked it instead of using the skillet. I placed the apples on top of browned chops and poured the sauce over, then baked for 45 minutes at 350. The chops were SO tender! I will definitely make this again.

We used very thin pork chops and then deglazed the pan with Calvados (apple brandy) before we made the sauce.  Tripled the sauce and served over rice made with a bit of pork stock.  It was excellent!  We will definitely make this again.

After taking some of the suggestions, this was amazing. 
I browned the chops while cooking the apples et. all. I doubled everything but the apples. When the sauce was caramelizing, I dumped it all over the chops in the pan, covered in foil and baked 20 minutes, then 15 without the foil (I also sprinkled more brown sugar on top after uncovering). 

A few other things, I added a dash of ground cloved as well as use equal amounts of light and brown sugar. I just like the depth of the dark brown, but the taste of the light brown. New Favorite!

Excellent! I followed others  advice and did the following:

Marinated boneless pork chops in 1c apple juice and 1/2c soy sauce overnight.
Tripled the sauce (not the apples), then poured it over the uncooked chops in a 9x13 pan.  Covered with foil and bake at 350 for 40 minutes.  Delicious!

Fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly, skipping the nuts because of weight watchers.  This was surprisingly low in points using light butter (5 points w/o nuts).  I also used fresh grated nutmeg (slightly less, it's more potent).  I will definitely make this again!

I wish I could give this 7 or 8 stars. It was SO good. I made this in the oven as suggested and also used the 2 parts apple juice, one part soy sauce marinade. It was so tender and the perfect blend of sweet and savory.

Absolutely amazing!  I took some reviewers suggestions and marinated the chops before baking.  I marinated in soy with honey, minced garlic and a bit of olive oil for about 2 hours.  I quadrupled the sauce and cooked in skillet.  I put the marinated chops in a dish and put the apples and sauce over them.  Baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  The chops came out moist, soft and delicious.  The soy garlic marinade made sure the meal wasn't too sweet. Will definitely be making again!

Very good....I marinated the chops over night in apple juice and soy sauce.  I doubled the sauce and added 2 large garlic cloves.  I placed my pork chops in a baking dish with some apple juice, sliced apples and poured the sauce on top.  I cooked it covered in foil at 375 for about 30 min.  My chops were medium in thickness.  Thought it was excellent...my kids loved the apples.

I'm not a great cook, but these were easy to make and got the ravest reviews I've ever received.  I followed reviewer Terri McDaniel's advice on the apple juice & soy sauce marinade (using twice as much juice as you do soy), but just marinaded them for a couple of hours.  The chops were as tender and moist as could be.  And I also followed her advice on quadrupling the sauce recipe (but keep the apple amount the same).  The sauce was not very time-consuming and well worth it taste-wise.  All I had were Gala apples, and they worked well. 

I made the sauce and apples in a pot on the stove first.  Then I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the chops after I pulled them out of the marinade.  After reading KJFaber's review, I decided to  bake the chops with the sauce and apples on top of them in a covered 9 by 13 dish for 35 minutes at 350, and that ended up perfect.  Didn't add the pecans because that didn't sound good to me, but will try them next time.  Was perfect to serve the chops over rice, and I'd saved a little sauce to add onto the chops after I put the meal on the plates.  The sauce drained onto the rice, making the rice so delicious!  

Thank you for the recipe, Karena!  You made me feel so victorious as my husband, father-in-law and two small kids showered and showered me with praise tonight at the dinner table.

I read a bunch of reviews and altered the recipe as follows: First I pounded the pork before it was cooked. then I threw the pork chops into a pan w/ vegtable oil and seared them although they were so thin that they were pretty much completely cooked. Put the pork chops into a casserole dish and get started on the apples. I used 2 apples but made enough sauce for 10 servings. Then I threw the apples/sauce on top of the pork and put into the oven for about 20 minutes. The pork was so tender, this is such a great dish with impressive presentation and not too much work, just a lot of dishes! I might not make as much sauce next time, it's very sweet so a little goes a long way.

I am changing my rating to 5 stars because I just made it again for the second time and it was fabulous.  I haven't seen my 4 year old clean a plate that fast in ages.  I seasoned my pork chops with black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and a little sage.  I cooked them on the indoor grill while I made the sauce on the stovetop.  A quick tip on making the sauce go further - add applesauce.  I doubled te brown sugar, butter and cinnamon.  I left the nutmeg the same as mine is strong.  I brought the mixture to a boil and let it simmer, stirring occasionaly.  I served it with a half and half mixture of brown and white rice and some mixed veggies.  What an absolutely satisfying meal!!

My original review is below.


I loved this recipe.  The only reason I am only giving it 4 stars is because I felt it was missing something the first time I tried it. It was good but I felt like there was a flavor missing. I will definately make this again!!  Thank you for the great Idea!!!

I thought this was very good, my husband enjoyed them also, except he says the next time I make pork chops, he wants a more "masculine" recipe. ;) I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion! I used boneless sirloin chops.  Instead of cooking them with oil, I seasoned them with salt, and sauteed them in apple juice to prevent dryness and try to seal in a bit of flavor (other reviewers complained of a lack of flavor in the pork chop itself).  I put the pork chops in an 8x8 pan in the oven set to warm. As for the sauce, I doubled the amount of spices and probably quadrupled the amount of butter - it just cooked too quick and kept reducing!  I used one Gala apple and one Golden Delicious for variety. After I put the cooked apples on top of the chops, I poured the sauce over the whole thing and let it cook in the oven at 250 for about 10 minutes.  The chops had a lot of flavor and weren't dry at all!  The sauce and apples are awesome. Oh, I also drizzled a bit of caramel sauce on top of the entree.  After all it is entitled "CARAMEL apple pork chops"! Yum!!  I can see this being a fall favorite!

This recipe sounded yummy but as I was pressed for time, I threw it all in a crockpot. Since the chops had 9 hours to mingle with other ingredients, the pork was fully infused with the brown sugar and apple flavors by the time we ate it! Yum! After reading the other reviews here, I used granny smith apples (the only kind I like) and doubled the other sauce ingredients. During the last 30 minutes, I fished out the apples (which, after 9 hours in a crockpot, were very hard to distinguish from the pork!) and added some egg noodles. Delicious!

Made this for dinner last night.  I added thin sliced onions as some reviewers suggested, but don't think I will add them again.  I also baked them in the oven, 350 degrees for 30ish minutes.  There definitely wasn't a lot of sauce, but that was fine with me.  My boyfriend prefers his pork chops plain, but complimented me on these.  He said he didn't know if he was eating dinner or dessert, LOL!  I served with Stove Top stuffing and green beans for an easy weeknight meal.

My pork chops were out of this world!  Everyone raved about them and couldn't get enough!  I did what someone suggested by using a can of pie filling, some butter, covered them with foil and baked them in the oven at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes, put the pecans and a little bit of  brown sugar, and Wha La!!  SO DELICIOUS!! and I'm not a fan of pork chops!! I will be making this again.

Loved this recipe. Although I have to admit I used another person's advice and used the canned apple pie filling to save time. My kids loved it!! Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is virtually fool proof. I read the recipe and decided the pork chops needed some seasoning so I used a chop house blend - it made these perfect!

It was good. The only thing I would change is to put the salt and pepper on the actual pork chop instead of into the mixture. Pork chops were tasting pretty bland, so I made sure to add quite a bit of sauce to them.

This dish was really good. The pork chops themselves were a little too plain if every bite wasn't eaten with an apple. Next time I would probably try to spice them up. I also doubled the amount of cinnamon & nutmeg used for the apples and used an extra apple.

Everyone seemed to enjoy them and next time will be even better with a few small tweaks.

I was looking for something different, boy was this good, per other reviewers, I doubled the sauce, and marinated it in apple juice and soy sauce.  It was very tender and delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this exactly as posted, and while i thought the flavor was really good, i wonder about the sauce.  The directions said to remove the apples with a slotted spoon and continue cooking the remaining sauce, but there was no sauce left.  I think it would havve been a solid 5 stars if it was a little saucier.

I did what another review suggested and marinated the chops overnite in an apple juice and soy mixture. Then pan fried for a few. Removed to a plate and put the brown sugar mixture into the same pan. Reduced a bit with the apples and then added the chops back into the pan to soak in all the goodness. Delicious!

This Recipe is AWESOME!! The BEST pork chops I have ever had! I followed the recipe exactly, except after I cooked the pork chops on a skillet, I also baked them in the sauce (I doubled the sauce to ensure it would be tender and moist) for about a half hour. My whole family LOVED them, and it made the house smell wonderful! Thanks for the amazing recipe!

This recipe is a must try.  It's so delicious and very simple to make.  I followed the recipe and the suggestions of other reviewers to marinate the chops in two parts apple juice to one part soy sauce.  The weather was nice outside so hubby decide to grill the chops instead of using the oven or stove top.  I added garlic powder just before putting the chops on the grill.  I decided to make the apples on the side instead of cooking it with the chops and serve it with garlic fried rice (fry rice in garlic and evoo).  Everything came out so delicious .  Most importantly, everyone in my family enjoyed it.

This will definitely be going in our regular rotation!  My picky kids devoured it, even my one-year-old ate it and couldn't wait for more.  This was so easy to make, too.  I added 1/2 chopped onion and doubled the sauce for four porkchops.  My only regret is that I didn't make more!

These were awesome!.. The best pork chops I've ever had!  I followed the recipe to a T except I added maybe a tablespoon of brandy to my apples as they simmered and doubled the sauce.  If you don't want sticky caramel, don't simmer the sauce as long at the end.. I will definately make these again and again!

I haven't given a recipe a 5-star rating for awhile. 
This was a totally tasty dish! Made as recipe pretty much as stated...just changed the pork cookin' process: melt 1T butter & olive oil in skillet, brown slightly. Salt and pepper the pork, then cook--do not overcook!! I thought this was easier than trying to add salt and pepper to the sauce. I would STRONGLY encourage you to just double the sauce recipe. I'd even throw in an extra apple next time because it was so tasty with the pork. Will certainly make again!!

My family & I didn't care for this. :( That's too bad cuz it sounded sooo yummy!  I tripled the sauce & doubled the apples.  I also added the pecans on the top.  The chops themselves just didn't have any flavor.  And I even marinated them overnight in apple juice & soy sauce as suggested by other reviewers.  The sauce didn't "carmelize", but it was still good.  We loved the apples...just not the chops.

I marinated these in the 2x apple juice 1x soy as recommended all day. I made them in the oven in a  9x13 baking dish with some apple juice to bake in. these were the most tender pork chops ever I didn't even know pork could be so tender. They were great! Also really enjoyed the topping- very, very good. Following others advice I doubled the sauce but not the apples and thought that was enough. Will definitly make this again!

I gave this 5 stars with the following revisions: I doubled the sauce and added 1/4 tsp ground cloves and used fresh grated nutmeg rather than from a bottle, I used 1TBSP Dark brown sugar & 1 TBSP Golden brown sugar (when doubling recipe).  I also put it in my le cruset pot & covered with foil for 25 minutes after I browned chops & saute'd the apples then removed foil, added golden brown sugar & pecans & cooked an additional 10 minutes.  It smelled like apple pie while baking.  I had to add extra salt to balance out the sweetness and then it was perfect!  Delicious!

These were so good!  After reading the reviews I seared the pork chops then put them in a baking dish, made the sauce in a skillet,(I quadroupled the recipe because doubling it didn't seem like it was very much sauce), then I poured the sauce over the chops and baked them at 350 for 30 minutes.  They were VERY moist and so delicious.  The last 10 minutes I put the crushed pecans on.  My boyfriend who travels for business and eats in great restaurants all of the time raved about them and said they were a definite do over.

Wonderful autumn dish. I used thick boneless chops -- regular bone-in chops would go better, I think. Also, the apples are fabulous, but overall, they wound up being more glazed than in a sauce. It should be at least doubled to qualify as a sauce.A great recipe for fall!

Wow, this is good!  I made it for 2, so I cut the number of pork chops in half, but doubled the amount of sauce (but not apples).  Yum!!  My husband, who can be quite picky, enjoyed it very much.  I followed the suggestion and served it with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Makes a beautiful presentation -- Looked like we were eating at a restaurant instead of at home!!

By the way, this sauce would be incredible over ice cream, too.  Just a thought.

Wow this was great!!  I doubled the sauce per suggestions, and I also fried the chops at a lower heat for a longer time.  Next time I will salt the chops themselves before cooking and add minimal salt to the sauce itself.  But this was wonderful......had that good feeling you get from having a wonderful meal all evening!!  The best part was I only had to clean one pan for this beautiful and impressive meal!!  Highly recommended.

LOVED this. I only did minor differences-- I marinated the pork chops in apple juice, soy sauce, and a caramel flavoring I have for cider. I also doubled the sauce and used one Gala apple and one Granny Smith. So tasty, though, thank you!

I got this recipe out of All Recipes Quick & Easy top 200 recipes - a cookbook I bought a LONG time ago (and which has never steered me wrong), so I cooked it without all the review changes - although I had to sub ginger for nutmeg (since we didn't have nutmeg).  It was fantastically easy as written and tasted great - the apples were like an apple pie - we seriously wanted to add whipped cream.  Served in summer time with fruit kebobs and everyone was happy.  I get a lot of helpful hints from the reviews on recipes, but this one is good as is.

Absolutely phenomenal! I followed another user's suggestion and marinated the chops for about 10 hours in 2 parts apple sauce and 1 part soy sauce, and it definitely helped keep the chops super moist and juicy! I also made sure to make 3x's the sauce, and that was the perfect amount for 4 chops. I served mine with mashed potatoes and green beans. YUM!

Sweet and savory, the flavors balance out beautifully. The only recommendation I have is if you top it with pecans, make sure they're roasted :)

There wasn't much of a sauce in the pan after you removed the apples... and my pork was kind of dry. I am sure I cooked to long or something, but I don't think I will try this one again.

Like others, I changed it a bit, but these are really uyummy and its the pecans that do it.  This is how I did it.  We are both type 2 diabetics, so I used Splenda brown sugar blend.  I floured and browned 2 boneless pork chops, put them in a pie pan, added butter and pecans and apples to the frying pan and cooked until apples were crisp tender.  Added cinnamonand ntumeg to the apples while cooking.  Then put one teaspoon of brown sugar blend on top of each pork chip and kind of patted it down.  Poured apples/nut mixture over the top and sprinkled with one more teaspoon of brown sugar.  then I put hte pie pan onto of a rimmed cookie sheet and added frozen sweet potato fries.  Baked it all together for 20 minutes at the temp on the sweet potato fry bag (425?).  Everything is done at the same time that way.  Also you can add more apples or a veggie to make it a really big meal for heartier appetites.  But great recipe!  Made it twice in the past few weeks, its a keeper!

This was a quickly prepared yet delicious meal.  It really had an unbelievable Autumnal feel, which is exactly what I wanted.  The side accompaniment suggestions were spot on too.  All the way around, this was a healthy, easy, quick and tasty meal.  Thanks!

I sauteed the pork with minced garlic and onions, and then followed the instructions. Doubled the sauce (the more the better) but this was fantastic! Served with garlic mashed potatoes. My family loved it! Thank you!

The best! I'm not a huge fan of pork chops to begin with so I was looking for a recipe that would allow the rest of my family to have pork chops and hopefully be something I could enjoy. The pork chops turned out so tender and delicious and the apples were just as good!

It is so good!! I followed everything to a tee, except I used chicken instead of pork chops. Cooking it in the skillet didn't work too well... I think chicken on the bone is too thick for that. But the sauce was wonderful and went really well with the chicken. Next time, I would bake it or broil it with the sauce on top, and even marinade it if I thought of it early enough.

I seasoned the pork chops with salt and pepper and grilled them 12 min each side on indirect medium heat.  The meat turned out fantastic.  I love the apple and the sauce, but the sauce is not very much for 3 pork chops.

Recipe sounds good but the sodium amount is not correct. One boneless 4oz pork chop has 350g of sodium, 262 calories 16 g of fat, etc. A good place to check ingredient nutrition is Livestrong.com - it has the most complete listing of foods - most have been verified by their staff.

I was totally add-mit about making this recipe. But I set out a goal with my family...they have to try something new and different from our normal standards and totally get out of a rutt. Any way. I made this to a T. The one thing I wasn't sure because the recipe directions didn't state, is that I used the same pan I cooked the pork chops in. Using the butter to deglaze the pan and cooking the brown sugar and apples in it. So I'm assuming that's what I was suppose to do. Now following that. I was surprised that the apples didn't have that huge sweetness nor the overpowering flavors over the meat. Saying that. It was decent. Totally different and the apples were tasty, the way the turned out. My girls ate up all the apples with their pork chop, my hubby loved the pork chop and said the apples were ok, my son...well he actually hated the whole recipe. But that didn't surprise me none. Very picky eater. So I won't include him into this recipe rating. I think I knew this going in to this. But he did try it and that's what is important. The only thing I would change would be increasing the sauce factor. I actually didn't have much left at all to put on all, and had a load of excess apples. I also used boneless pork chops. Thanks. This was very good, different and very easy to make.

I love this recipe! I've made it twice now. Like other reviewers, I added onion and doubled the sauce recipe. I skipped browning the chops. I started the sauce in a cast iron skillet, added the chops, covered with foil and then baked in the oven. It's delicious and easy!

This was super easy and yummy! I seasoned the pork chops with salt/pepper/garlic, seared both sides on the stove, and then baked them at 350 for 45 minutes with 2x sauce on top. My boyfriend loved them!

This was so good!  I fried the chops with an onion. I seasoned the chops with salt and pepper, and garlic powder.  I also minced two cloves of garlic.  I took the onion and the pork chops and put them in a pyrex.  I made four times the sauce for two pork chops and also used two apples. Then I put this all in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes!

This was delicious! I omitted the nutmeg (didn't have it) and also I didn't have enough butter to double the sauce like I wanted, so I added in some olive oil; simmered the sauce + apples on the stove for about 15 minutes before removing the apples, laying them on the chops, and then added a little cornstarch to the remaining sauce to thicken slightly. Poured the sauce over the chops, and baked in the oven, covered with tinfoil, at 350 for 25 minutes - then smashed some walnuts in a bag and added brown sugar. Spread walnuts and brown sugar on top of chops - baked for about 20 additional minutes, until pork reached 155 degrees. Was delicious and juicy...Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for something different.  Rarely do I do anything with apples--that will change.  I tried following the directions with ingredients but I don't care as much for nutmeg and after mixing ingredients the nutmeg smell was stronger than the others so I added a little extra brown sugar and cinnamon, hoping to scale down the nutmeg and blend the scents--and it worked for me.  I am terrible with knowing which apple is for what, I used granny smiths and they were good.  My husband, 3 yr old, and I enjoyed this meal.  I will be making this again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!! (I served it with a rosemary parmesan mashed potato--which my 3 yr old also ate, even though he doesn't like mashed potatoes usually.) next time I'll plan to serve a salad with it too.

Great the first night, and good as leftovers, too! I did as others suggested: broil the chops in the oven instead (usually 5-6 minutes per side) and cook up the apples on the stovetop so that everything is ready at the same time. Just throw the sauce ingredients into the pan instead of premixing them in a bowl and slice the apples right into the pan. Leftovers were good with Pumpkin Seed Cream Sauce (with pecans, not pumpkin seeds), also from this site.

I loved this! It made a great change to plain pork chops. It looks fancy and is easy for a novice cook, like me. I did as suggested and made twice the amount of sauce. I used red delicious apples and found it very yummy.

Needs way more sauce.  It's good as it is but should be doubled or even tripled.  It reduces quickly at the suggested heat, so I would turn it down for the next time.  All in all a good recipe, I did it as called for and that is the only change I would make.

Awesome! I did things a little differently and browned the pork chops, poured apple mix over the top and baked, covered for about 35 min. but I am sure this would be just as good as it is written. A new favorite!

I did like someone suggested and let it marinate in a soy sauce/apple juice mix (2:1 apple juice to soy.) Sauteed some onions to go with the chops/apples. I also doubled the brown sugar sauce so there would be more to dip and mop. I think next time I make this, I will thicken the sauce. Spread the apple mixture over the chops, covered with foil, and let them bake @350 for 20-25 mins. About 15-20 minutes before we were ready to eat, I added some candied pecans. We ate it with steamed rice and peas, also amazing  with mashed potatoes and it was heavenly.

Good recipe, but I didn't think there was much of a "sauce" after the apples cooked.  I took the apples out and then left the sauce to thicken, but there was only 1T left.  Next time I will cook the apples longer until the sauce thickens then place on the pork chops.  Also, I cooked the chops and apples at the same time.  No need to cook chops first and keep warm as the recipe suggests.

Yum!!  Doubled the sauce & omitted the nutmeg, pecans & salt/pepper.  Cooked the apples in water, then drained & added butter & brown sugar.  Kept cooking until almost carmelized, cooked chops so apples & chops were done at same time.  Kids didn't like this, but that's okay, my husband & I ate their leftovers!

This was excellent!  I made a little extra of the glaze, using some maple sugar rather than all brown sugar.  I also did not cook the chops quite through, and then added them in and cooked them for like 5 or 6 minutes on med-low, mostly covered, and constantly turning and spooning glaze on them.  The apples themselves were amazing.  I would put more in next time.

Review:Delightful! I little worried about this since in many cases I am not a fan of cooked fruit but this was delish. Another guest also stated that when they heard the name they doubted they would enjoy it but really liked it as well. What I did: Cooked sauce (about 2x what orginally called for) on stove then poured over raw pork. Cooked covered in the oven for about 40min, sprinkled nuts on top and cooked uncovered for additional 10-15min. What I might change: Next time I will try adding a thickening agent to the sauce (maybe after it cooks...after cooking there was a ton of tasty liquid in dish that went to waste)

This recipe is amazing! I've never really liked pork chops in their typical fried and overcooked form-- but this recipe was delicious, nutritious, and super easy! To save time on clean up I coated the pan with aluminum foil before putting in the pork chops and afterwards I just crumpled up the mess. Also, I used Fuji apples since I didn't have Granny Smiths and kept the skin on for the color. The whole thing turned out melt in your mouth good! Thank you so much! I'm going to make this again and again!

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Since the pork is seared first, it didn't absorb any flavors from the sauce.  If I were to start over, I'd try baking it as other reviewers did however with so many pork recipes to choose from, I won't be trying this one again.

I just made this and it was wonderful. The pork chops were so juicy and the sauce very flavorful. Every bit of it is gone.  Followed a lot of comments that i read- Marinated with soy sauce and apple cider 2:1 ratio and added a little oil and  apple cider vinegar to marinade. This makes the chops soooo moist. I salted the chops then pan seared them, covered them with sauce, and baked them in 13x9 pan on 350 covered 25 min. and uncovered 15min.to caramelize sauce on top. I made 4 times the sauce that the receipe called for. I sauteed an onion into the butter at the beginning of making the sauce. Then added the spices, sugar, and apples to the mixture, cooked it for 15 min beofre covering the chops with it. Everyone is still licking their fingers. I served this with mashed potatos and acorn squash. The squah really complimented this dish.

This was a great dish, but I definitely agree with most of the reviews that tweaks need to be made. I marinaded the chops, and then made a TON of sauce (three times as much) and poured it over the chops, and baked them covered at 400 degrees for 25 minutes before uncovering them, sprinkling them pecans and brown sugar on top, and baking for 10 - 15 minutes more.   So yummy, my 4 year old nephew asked for more! I will DEFINITELY make this dish again!

The best pork chops I have ever had! I used gala apples becuase I had them on hand and they held up without getting mushy.  I doubled the amounts for the sauce and simmered until the apples softened, about 5 minutes.  Then I poured that over the raw chops, covered, and baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  Absolute perfection.  Moist and tender and absolutely delicious! Perfect with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Can't wait to make again!

Great base recipe!  The biggest change I made was to soak the chops in brine for 24 hrs before cooking (Brine: 4 cups apple juice, 2/3 cup kosher salt, 1/2 tbsp black peppercorns crushed, 2 cloves of pressed garlic, and 1/2 lime thinly sliced).  The brine made the chops tender and moist and the flavors melded perfectly with the sauce.   I had to quadruple the sauce ingredients and probably could have used even more.  After searing the chops in oil I finished them in the sauce. Superb!

Yay! Another yummy pork chop recipe. My hubby and I are not fans of the Pork Chop, but have been trying to expand our horizons. Here was my game plan . . . dice a small onion and a small shallot add three tablespoons of butter to pan. Add onions/shallots to pan, a few minutes later add the pork chops. Cookon medium for 8 minutes total 4 on each side. Take chops and put in baking dish in oven at 350. Then proceed to cook apple mixture. Pour mixture over chops in the oven. Cook for 20 minutes in over, remove chops from baking dish, heat liquid in saucepan with a pinch of cornstarch wait a few minutes and it should thicken right up! SOOOO Good

Great Recipe ! I quadrupled the sauce and gave the chops a quick fry - then put them in the oven (as per other reviews).  This gives you time to make the rice or mashed potatoes. Will definitely make this again and again.

Yum Yum!  I didn't change this recipe much, except for to double up on the sauce and add half of a chopped onion to it.  I also added some apple cider vinigar.  My husband ate three portions!  He thought it was delicious and so did I!  Thanks for the recipe!  ( BY THE WAY- Fast and Easy too!)

A really nice "comfort food" recipe;my partner ate everything on the plate & she HATES pork.  Like others, I doubled sauce and added a bit (1 T.)  of apple cider vinegar, placed oven-warming chops, apples and sauce into covered Corningware dish into 350 F oven for 25 minutes. I used the baking time to make smashed Yukon Gold potatoes.   This recipe is easy to make, wonderful to eat & yields those sweet words, "This is a keeper!" Thanks for submitting it!

Great recipe - just had some trouble with the amount of sauce. I should have doubled it - there was barely any sauce at all. But still very tasty and my husband loved it too. Apples were delicious. I will use this again and again

This was so good! I had guests over and they practically licked their plates. Next time I think I will more than double the recipe because it didn't thicken up as much as I thought it would. I served this with a salad to contrast this sweet dish. Making this again for sure, with more sauce and apple!

Yummy!!  I love this recipe!  I baked my chops at 350 degrees for 30-45 minutes depending on thickness, then broiled for about 5 minutes to brown.  The apples are so delicious.  I like to make mashed sweet potatoes to go with this.  Sometimes I cook it for myself and have leftovers the next day.

So so so so good!  I made this twice in two weeks because it got such rave reviews!  I recommend doubling the number of apples you use, though, because they shrink a bit and they get fought over.

Let me start of by saying that I don't like pork chops. I've had them baked, fried, breaded you name it. I just don't like them... 
So when I tell you that I actually had about half of my chop, that's actually pretty amazing. I was looking in my freezer yesterday and dreading taking out more ground beef. I was bored of it. That's when I noticed the pork chops... I decided to look on here and see if I could find a recipe that I had never had before. Well, I think it's safe to say I had never had apple pork chops. 
After reading the reviews, I left out the nuts, tripled the sauce and I didn't have apples, so I used applesauce. I also marinaded the chops for about an hour in orange juice.
All together this recipe took me about 2 hours. It was worth it when I saw my fiancee's face. He did what I figured he would. He turned his nose up and said "APPLE SAUCE pork chops? I don't know..."
Then he took a bite. His entire face changed, I kid you not. These were the most tender chops I have ever had and the sauce was absolutely awesome. 
PLUS it made my whole kitchen smell like Christmas dinner. How do you beat that??

So, so... If you make this follow the advice of another reviewer and skip the oven. Season the chops w/ salt & pepper and brown in skillet. Double the ingredients of the apple glaze and use a saucepan. When the consistancy is right transfer the glaze to the skillet and coat the chops. Cover and simmer till meat is tender, 15-20 mins.

I made this recipe, and my fiance and I LOVED it!  It was so easy.  We did double the recipe for the sauce.  We also used granny smith apples.  Then, to top off the dish, we put cranberry raisins on top to add some color and extra flavor.  It was delicious!

This was excellent! I don't know that I would marinade the pork chops as others suggested. I brushed the chops with oil then seasoned them generously with salt and pepper before cooking them. Others suggested doubling or tripling the sauce recipe. I tripled the sauce and there was plenty left over. Goes great with mashed potatoes. The extra sauce acts as a gravy. Very yummy!! Thanks.

This recipe is AWESOME!  I'm not a big pork chop eater, but we have started eating them a little more often due to this recipe.  My oven is broken (only heats to 350F and up, not down) so I skipped the oven warming and cooked the chops in a skillet on the stove.  I made the sauce in a separate pot and voila!  We eliminated dirtying one of the dishes the recipe calls for.  It tastes just as good, too, without as much of the hassle.  Simple works for me!  I trippled the sauce.  Everyone loves the sauce and the apples.

This was absolutly wonderful.  The only thing that I will do differently, is to put the apples in at the very last minute.  It only takes a minute for the apples to cook and if you give it much more it will be applesauce, like it was for me.  That was also fantastic though.  If you ever eat applesauce with your pork chops, you will like this.  Thank YOU!

The first time I made this the kids made sure that there was planty of PB&J since they were certain they would hate it.  Needless to say, the PB&J was never touched.  Even the 2 year old loves this.  I did take the advice of another reviewer and soak the chops for 4-6 hours in apple juice.  I also made 4 times the sauce.  I will absolutely be making these again!

This was amazing! Seriously as good as you would get at a great restaurant. I did sear the chops first. Then I made the sauce (doubled) and added the chops back into the pan.  I bake it covered for 20 and uncovered for 10 at 325. The chops were moist and the combination with the  apples was so good. Served this with herb roasted potatoes and green beans with shallots. Great autumn dinner and would be a wonderful meal to serve guests.

Caramel and pork chops? A little red flag was going up when I was making this, and I should've paid more attention to it. The sauce for me ended up too runny -although I do like pork chops with apples, or applesauce-; caramel sauce should be thick.

Very good.I Sprinkled chops with garlic salt, pepper & sage before browning them in a skillet on high heat for about 1 minute per side. While making the apple sauce, I finished cooking the pork chops in the oven,uncovered at 400 degrees for 12 minutes. They were very tender.  I also tripled the sauce. Had enough left over to use as a topping for vanilla ice cream for dessert. The whole meal was a hit.

I used the Costco-sized pork chops so I had to be sure they were REALLY cooked and well seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  We loved this recipe.  I browned the chops in olive oil and then decided to let them cook a while on medium heat.  The semi-cooked chops went in a pyrex dish that I coated with PAM.  In the hot pan over med I added a half stick of butter (it was the oerfect amount), some olive oil, and about 5 T of brown sugar.  It started to crystalize pretty quick, so watch it. In went two Red Gala apples that I sliced up, and the rest of the goodies *no pecans or nutmeg here). I poured it carefully over the chops and put them in @ 350 for 20 minutes.  Made some buttery herb noodles and broccoli- this was good enough to make again. Oh- the sauce did not thicken so I added a tiny bit of Wondra and it worked beautifully.

I threw this in the slow cooker on low all day along with some sweet potatoes and Idaho potatoes, doubled the sauce, and added a little more brown sugar than called for.  Came out great!  Apples were delicious, meat had nice flavor, not too sweet.  Would make this again the same way...

This sounded wonderful, but worried hubby would dislike the sweetness.  He loved it! Didn't change a thing except doubled the sauce  (My kids said to please triple it next time.)  Definitely a keeper!

This is a great pork chop recipe.  I cooked my boneless center cut chops on the George Foreman grill, then poured the apples and sauce over.  I found no need to warm the chops in the oven, or to seperate the apples from the sauce as the recipe calls for.  I really liked the meal, but my husband was not a huge fan of the fruit and meat combo. I also doubled the sauce (brown sugar, butter, cinnamon).

I am giving this five stars because my husband really loved them.  I didn't quite like the nutmeg but I will make again.  I followed the recipe except I doubled the sauce but not the apples.  After I removed the apples from the sauce I accidently over cooked the sauce so I had to make a new batch. So do not let your sauce cook to long otherwise it will stick to your teeth like when you eat a real caramel apple.  And if you do have to make a second batch of sauce without the apples add a little liquid to compensate for the natural juice from the apples.

This was ok.  I loved the apples; I used Granny Smith, and they were delicious.  I'd like to try this with a pork roast.  As it was, the chops were good, but not spectacular.

I think I can honestly say that this is the best pork chop recipe I've ever tasted!!  I read a review by msredkitty and followed her directions exactly and it turned out fantastic!  As everyone else has already said, I would definitely at least double the sauce.  I tripled it and still could have used a little more...Fantastic stuff!

don't worry this isn't an actual "carmel" more like a brown sugar sauce.  i doubled the sauce, cut the apples big, and seasoned the chops well with salt and pepper (otherwise chops themselves are quite bland)...this recipe is EXCELLENT!

This was a big hit.  I took recommendations from the reviews.  I seasoned the pork chops with a teaspoon of seasoning salt. They came out moist and flovorful.  I doubled the sauce and it still was way too little for four chops.  Cut the apples to two apples.

This was pretty good - but I browned the pork chops and then added the other ingredients on top, covered it, and cooked it in the oven instead of the stovetop.  I wish the sauce had been thicker.  The flavor overall was very good but it needed something - maybe onions? - just something to make it taste a little less like an apple pie with pork in it.

Chops were tender and tasty.  I looked at other reviews first.  Doubled the sauce and the apples.  Next time I won't double the apples...they were way too much (threw alot away).  I'm going to make again, just doubling the sauce for the side.

I browned the pork chops then added the ingredients on top, cooked in oven together because the pork chops were too thick. (375°/40 min, covered in foil). When finished I blended the apples and some of the juice to make a purée, (I added baby carrots just because I had them).  I'd probably cook as the recipe says if they were thin chops.

This recipe is amazing!!!  I followed other reviewers suggestion to triple the sauce first, then pour over pork and bake at 350* for 25 minutes.  I will absolutely make this again any chance I get!!

My husband had a rather strange craving for something meaty, yet sweet, so we came to this recipe. I think I first underestimated how much he loves apples and caramel and pork, for after this meal was made, he began to cry out and consume it and whisk me away to our bedroom.

A word of advice, quadruple the sauce. You'll need it, it seems like it'd go really well on ice cream.

Husband is still moaning at the sauce...

Loved the flavors.  Not a recipe I'd fix all the time but oh so good in the fall!  Only change I'll make next time will be to cut up the apples more and cook them a little longer (my fault, not the recipe).  DH even said "bravo" which is a high compliment!

I followed this recipe exactly and did not change anything. It was delicious, but I still felt there was a little something missing. 

I believe that something was bacon.

Next time, I will add some chopped up bacon to the apples! yum yum!

My sister requests this every time she comes to dinner. She normally likes everything plain with no sauce, but she thinks this is the best way to cook pork chops. The only thing I changed was I cooked the entire dish in an enamel casserole pan so I could move from the stove to oven in one pan.

Wow!!  I liked the sauce the butter, brown sugar and apples made.  The spices were too mild for my taste, but it was a great starting point.  I pan-seared the chops first, and used the drippings and oil to brown the apple mixture.  I used the oven and finished the chops.  This was a great idea and I appreciate the recipe.  Thanks!

Definately a nice change of pace on pork chops... over all not bad... two things I think I will do next time... First sprinkle the chops with a little Lawry's.. and second let the apples cook a little longer so I have more of a sauce... I cooked mine just until they started to get tender and I didn't have much sauce... so I might let them cook longer... but over all not bad

This was very good. Made everything according to recipe except for omitting nutmeg. The sweetness of the brown sugar worked perfect with the tartness of apples and savory of the pork.  Served with mashed sweet potatoes and garlic green beans. Great meal! Fancy for company but also easy enough for a regular weeknight.

I was very excited about the idea of this dish but disappointed how it all turned out. The cooking time/temperature was a little difficult to figure out. Many suggestions on the best way to cook them. Mine sadly turned out bland and lacking flavor. Great concept but disappointed with the results.

Great flavor,not so great cooking method. I think I will do the chops in oven next time. The stove top made them tough.  My husband rated it 3 1/2 stars, but said he would eat it once a week. I said why did you only give it 3 1/2 stars then? He said well it's not steak! Thanks for sharing!

I chose this recipe for dinner tonight. I was not impressed with the "sauce". All I had left after I did the apples is a gooey mess that stuck to everything! Maybe I did something wrong, which is possible, but I'm sure if I make this again I will find an additional sauce to go with it.

My family really enjoyed this one, even my picky 4 year old. It was also a great break from the everyday meals I normally cook because it had a subtle sweet taste to it. The only change I made was I doubled the sauce like most the reviews mentioned and it seemed like just the right amount.

These were great. My husband was a little unsure of these because he does not like Granny Smith Appels. But he raved about how great these were and asked me to make them again real soon. They only thing I did that was different was double the sauce per some other recommendations. Was an excellent dish.

I followed the directions exactly with the exception of doubling the sauce recipe.  I thought they were really good but I think next time I will only brown the pork chops then place them in a casserole dish, pour the sauce and apples on top and bake covered for 20-25 minutes to allow the sauce to thicken around the chops.  Loved how fast and easy this recipe was.  Great change from the ordinary.

I made a mistake of following other reviews and tripling the sauce.  I felt like the meat was swimming in a pool of butter.  Even aside from that, I wasn't crazy about the overall flavors of the dish.  My kids didn't care for it either.

What a great fall recipe!  The only changes I made were 1) to double the sauce ingredients 2) to add a bit of cornstarch at the end to help thicken it and 3) I put the chops in at 350 instead of 175 and once I added the apples I just covered it with foil.  Definitely will make again!

AWESOME!  I cheated and used a high quality applie pie filling with a little soy sauce, warmed it thru and poured over browned chops in a casserole dish like another reviewer suggested.  Topped with a little brown sugar at the end, but since nobody in my family likes nuts except for me, I just added those to my own plate.  This was FABULOUS!!!  Served with rice & green beans and ALL of us LOVED it!  This will be in our menu often!  Thank you so much for sharing!  =)

My apples didn't look like the picture, but they tasted so wonderful. My family really liked this, it was an easy Fall recipe. It has been added to my "staples" list!

AMAZING. I cooked the chops on my griddle-panini  machine, which sped up the process.  I added a bit of extra brown sugar & butter for extra sauce as other reviewers suggested, and chopped the apples into bite size pieces to cook more quickly, and so my toddler could eat them.  Next time I'll throw in some toasted walnuts.  Fabulous!  Great entertaining dish.

Yummy warm filling meal, the women in our family loved it most. Probably because it's not a thick juicy steak for the men. Great recipe, pretty easy to make-we will for sure make this a lot more.

I loved this recipe! The reason for the four stars is I followed reviews and tripled the sauce and poured it over five raw pork chops seasoned with salt and pepper. Baked them in a 9x13 baking dish at 350 for 45 minutes. They smelled heavenly and tasted just as great! I will be making this many times for my delighted husband and picky children!

This was really good, I did change a few things because I like things with a lot of seasoning and am not a big fan of onions.  I used more nutmeg and cinnamon, used dried onions in with the apples.  Next time I would cook the apples and sauce after the pork chops were only 10 minutes from done.  Also I seared the chops on the stove to keep the juices in and then baked the rest of the way.  Seasoned the chops with garlic and pepper before searing.  Will make again.

These are delicious.  I doubled the sauce because I usually wish I had more of the yummy sauce anytime I make something like this, but it wasn't necessary for this recipe.  It's perfect as written!  The only thing I did differently was to season my chops with a little S&P, rather than putting S&P in the sauce.  Will definitely make again!  These chops are even great as leftovers, and we're not usually big on leftover pork.

Would bake next time instead of frying - meat turned out tough.  Apple topping was excellent.  Kind of random on top of pork chops, but served with rice pilaf, made a great meal.  Easy and quick to prepare.  Find directions on baking - shake & bake?

Pork chops are a funny thing, if not for the sauces they would just be the other white meat. Not much flavor, but this is a great recipe. I doubled the sauce and seasoned the chops and even lightly floured them, which helped in thickening the sauce, I also threw in a handful of golden raisins while doing the apples and some caramelized onions I had left. Definitely a keeper!

Excellent, with a few changes. I used thick pork chops that I baked covered with foil on 365 for about 40 mins, turning over halfway thru cooking. I seasoned them with pepper, original mrs dash, seasoned salt, garlic powder, and a few splashes of soy sauce. Sauce and apples was made by the recipe, except doubled. Boyfiend loved and paired well with the veggie and egg fried rice that he made.

If you are looking for a great apple and pork recipe, you've found it! This creates a great caramel sauce as well, which is the perfect topping. We were vacationing in the fall in Point Reyes, California, when we tried it for the first time. Our vacation rental house had an apple tree that was at its peak, and used apples from that tree and fresh pork chops from a local butcher. Yum!

Absolutely wonderful!  My mom is staying with us right now and was just put on a sodium free diet.  This recipe only has 28mg of sodium so she was able to have it and LOVED it!  She is a salt junkie so it really says a lot that she enjoyed it.....without a salt shaker.

This was wonderful!  The only thing I did differently was marinate the chops overnight in a mixture of apple juice and soy sauce.  Other reviewers mentioned that the chops themselves were bland, so I took this recommendation and it gave them a great flavor!

Delicious! I brushed the meat with a mix of oil, salt, pepper and powdered garlic, then cooked three pork chops in a cast iron skillet. I only used a single apple with thin slices and it was perfect. I can't wait to show this one off to the family.

The pork was cooked in apple juice in the skillet. This really helped the pork to stay moist. It was awesome. The apples were not peeled, two were plenty and doubled as dessert. My husband raved about how good it was and is already asking for it again. Reheated well.

I loved this, but like most of the other reviewers did, I tweaked the recipe. There definitely wasn't enough sauce so I simply tripled the sauce portion of the recipe. Also, instead of using tart apples, I used red delicious. The sweetness of a sweeter apple really goes a lot better with the saltiness of the pork and salt, or at least I think so. :)

Pleasantly surprised and impressed. I seasoned the pork chops with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. I felt that this was crucial to the 5 star outcome. Other than that, I followed the recipe and didn't mind the skillet method (quicker than baking). Left out the oil...totally unnecessary. Used slivered almonds because that is all I had. Don't underestimate the nuts. It really added a lot.

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would! I tried pan frying and baking them in the oven as others suggested. I liked the pan frying method more because the sauce thickened up beautifully. I used Macintosh apples because it was all I had, but it still turned out good.

This recipe was so yummy my husband and I love it.  I didn't follow the directions totally.  Didn't think the carmel sauce would be enough so I trippled it and then seared both sides of the pork chops in a pan with olive oil before cooking the chops with the apple slices in the oven for 35 minutes.  Then I spooned some of the carmel sauce on our placed place the chops with apple on the sauce and then drizzled some more on top.  I cooked mashed potatoes and greeen beans on the side.  Very good I'll be making this recipe more in the future.

This was a wonderful meal.  My husband loved it.  I read several of the reviews and changed what I thought best.  I added apple juice, doubled the sauce except for the apples and added starch to thicken the sauce. After cooking all as suggested, I added all together in a pan and put in the sauce over at 175 until ready to eat. WONDERFUL

This recipe is a keeper, although I agree that while two apples is plenty, the sauce portion should be at least tripled. I used 1/2 c. brown sugar to 1/2 c. butter. I think the pork chops are much better when grilled; baked pork chops come out gummy. Marinade the pork chops (for my marinade, I use 1/4 c. sweet/spicy mustard, 1/2 c. oil, dash balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper, and 1/4 c. brown sugar) for a few hours before grilling; the marinade adds a depth of flavor - otherwise it's just a pork chop with a sweet topping. Scrape up the juicy bits of pork and marinade and then add the butter and brown sugar to make the topping.

These were EXCELLENT!!!  I made the sauce as per the recipe and only used 2 pork chops, so basically the sauce should be doubled.  I marinated the pork chops in orange juice a few hours before cooking them and then followed the recipe.  Loved them...thanks for sharing.

Making this dish for the first time with my family and parents (total of 10 people).  It was a hit.  I didn't want the typical chops, so this was an experiment for me.  I followed some of the other reviews and added my own change.  I seared the chops with pepper and oil, set in baking dish.  Sauted half an onion then added a can of apple pie filling, and 2 cups apple juice and 1/4 cup soya sauce.  This wasn't enough sauce to feed my family, so I cut up 3 apples and added 1 more cup of apple juice.  Poured over chops and baked 1 hour (next time I'll slow bake at 300F for 2 hrs.)  I then took out the chops and placed on serving tray, put the roasting pan on the burner and added a package of roast gravy to a little cold water first then to the pan and thickened juice.  It was delish, my whole family loved it.  The flavour was fantastic and even 2 of my kids hate apples but ate this and even had seconds.  Served with mashed potatoes and the sauce made wonderful gravy.  ^5

Phenomenal pork chops.  I did modify it after reading the comments as follows:  instead of cooking on the stovetop, I seared for just a minute and then baked in the oven at 375 degrees for forty-five minutes. I browned the apples in butter and cinnamon and nutmeg (I also added a dash of pumpkin pie spice) before putting it in the baking dish with the pork chops and let them all cook together.  Also, I added a few tablespoons of unsweetened applesauce to thicken the mixture.  I used Granny Smith apples.  I forgot to add the pecans at the end but it tasted great without them.  These pork chops were just delicious.  As recommended, I paired them with the smothered green beans and smashed sweet potatoes.  Awesome dinner!

I too made some changes. Seared the chops quickly (seasoned with kosher salt and black pepper, both sides) then used the same pan to build the sauce. I tripled the sauce and it made enough for 4 people. Added 3 tablespoons of flour, to thicken, then 3 apples, brown sugar, and instead of just nutmeg and cinnamon I added homemade pumpking pie spice (the cloves gave it such a nice flavor!). I also added, about 3/4 C of apple juice for liquid. Cooked until apples were almost cooked and finished it all off in the oven for 30 minutes, total cooking time was 45 minutes, they were incredible. Served with pumpkin pie spiced acorn squash for a nice fall themed dinner.

Made this last night with rave reviews from my family.  The only thing I did differently was deglaze the pan slightly with a little water after cooking the chops and before adding the butter to make the sauce.  Got some great flavor off the bottom of the pan that might have otherwise been wasted.  Delicious recipe and so easy.

Really good. I tripled the sauce as other reviewers suggested, but that's not really needed, unless you know your family wants to eat a lot of apples. Please make sure the chops are almost fully cooked before removing them to the oven to warm.

Delicious!  I thought this recipe sounded different, and I happened to have everything on hand.  I omitted the salt and pepper (I figured it could be put on later - my husband put it on his but I left it off).  I used salted butter because that is what I had.  I added more brown sugar and cinnamon to taste.  I do think one apple is probably fine.  I only put 2-3 slices on top of each pork chop.  But since I cut up more apples, I used the remaining sauce (I had doubled the sauce) and threw some extra apples in there to make a yummy dessert! =]

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  It was slightly sweet without being overly so.  It was easy enough for my husband to make (he is not a cook), while I supervised (I wasn't feeling too well).  I only gave it 4 stars because, although all three of my children ate it- none of them enjoyed it.  They requested that I not make it again.  The only complaints they could verbalize was that it was a. too sweet, or b. the sauce didn't stick to the meat and flavor it enough.  That said- I added it to my recipe box and it will make more appearances at our dinner table.

I put salt, pepper, and garlic powder on the chops before pan frying them.  I double the rest of the ingredients used in the apple mixture...forgot the pecans even though I have some on hand...I did add about 2/3 cup of chopped onion before putting the apples in to cook down.  Very moist and tasty.

Excellent!  I think next time I'll follow the reviews and marinate and I do need some work on the sauce but I think that was user error.  Easy to make and delicious, will be making again.

Loved it. Doubled sauce as recommended by other reviews. Tips: Chops should be left out at room temp for 1/2 hour before frying. I put salt & pepper on chops,dredged in flour before pan frying 5 mins each side. Flour helps sauce stick to chop when poured on top.

i usually do a grub rub and grill. i decided to do this recipe since it was so high and i happened to have all the things. stupid me, i didn't read the comments where every one seems to alter the original. ugh! here's the problem: it is WAY too bland. the tast of the meat is the taste of pork. none of the sauce or seasoning adds to it. it was easy enough to make but i can't imagine it being worth the effort for no flavor. even the apple part was bland. i'm sorry, but ratinge need to be based on the actual recipe on this website, not on what it is after you change almost everything about the recipe itself.

This was a huge hit at my house, which is no small feat--I live with a group of teenage friends, all of whom are really picky eaters. It was really easy, too, which is definitely a plus as I've only just ventured out into the cooking world. I did make a few small changes: substituting pork steaks for the pork chops (they were much, much cheaper), adding garlic salt to the pork when I was pan-frying it, and only searing it for a few seconds before putting it in the oven. I baked them at 350 for about forty minutes, I think. Also, I added sauteed onions to a few of the chops while they were baking, since I'm a huge fan of onions. I more or less quadrupled the sauce (save for the apples, as I didn't know whether or not my friends would like cooked apples), and opted to serve it on the side instead of directly over the meat. It was delicious, and my friends and I devoured them within just a few minutes. Definitely a recipe I will be trying again, and certainly one I would recommend to others.

These turned out great. Although I did as others and made the sauce, browned the pork chops than put it all in the oven for about 30 mins at 350.

It smells divine... but I too find it lacking in sauce.  I also have a complaint... it took way less than 45 minutes to make!  I'm still waiting on my roast potatoes, which went in before I started!

I have made this dish three times, each time I make another adjustment to the recipe. My last attempt was the absolute BEST. I marinated the pork chops in apple juice and soy sauce (low-sodium) quadrupled the sauce. It was fantastic! served it with garlic mash potatoes and green beans. Will be making this more often.

These pork chops were really good.  I was looking for something different to do with pork when I found this recipe.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and marinated the pork for a few hours in apple juice and soy sauce (2:1).  After sauteeing the pork and making the sauce I baked the whole thing in the oven (350 degrees) for @30 minutes.  This was helpful as it gave me time to make the side dishes.  Oh and I would also strongly recommend at least doubling the sauce.  I doubled it and it was the perfect amount for 2 people.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I will be making this again!

The whole family loved the recipe - namely, the apples and sauce!  My chops were very flavorful, but tough.  Totally not the recipe's fault though!  The sauce redeemed my poor choice in cut of meat.  The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is that I had to double it to get just enough for each chop, and I only drizzled a TBSPish (used a soup spoon) on each serving. The package of meat I pulled out had 5 pork chops and that last one is lonely and sauceless,even with the doubled recipe.  Make this with confidence, but double or triple the recipe!

The apples were great!  Pork chops not so much.  I will probably try again but will bake in the oven.  Also I needed to add cornstarch to the sauce because it was pretty watery.

I liked this recipe alot. I did double the sauce but not the pecans and added an additional apple. I decided to bake them on 350 for 40 min. They were very juicy and flavorful. I will make these again soon.

We enjoyed these. I browned them and made the sauce, I had to mess with it, and I added about 1/3 of a cup of chicken stock, and some thyme, I like thyme; and the chicken stock, because I was finishing them in the oven. Didn't need the stock. It made it's own broth. I'll be making again, but without the stock.

So good!  I made the recipe exactly as written, but doubled the apple mixture after reading the advice from other reviewers.  The sweetness of the apples works wonderfully with the pork.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Delicious and easy to make!  I'm a novice cook and was worried these wouldn't turn out since it was my first cook fixing pork chops.  But my hard-to-please husband was THRILLED with these and they turned out terrific!  The apples are amazing!

Good lord, this is a good pork chop! I will add to the comments on here to say that this was absolutely delicious! My boyfriend and I totally scarfed this down.

The only modifications I made were to grill the pork with some non-stick spray (omitting the oil), and to use splenda brown sugar instead of the real thing. I used granny smith apples sliced thin with the skin still on.

SO GOOD! I served it with steamed veggies and a baked sweet potato.

Awesome! Here's what I did... I heated all the sauce ingredients in a saucepan on the stove until the brown sugar was melted.  I let it cool down and poured the mixture over the chops in a baking dish. I put it in the fridge overnight and when I came home from work, put them in the oven at 350 until they were done. They were truly good! And, very little work!  I will make this again and if I have more time, I'll make it on the stovetop like the recipe suggests. YUM!

I end up making this for my family every time they come over because they request (or demand) it each time.  They don't want to try anything else!

Last time I made it over pork tenderloin.  I cut the pork into thick slices and diced the apples so it looked like a brushetta.

I threw everything (except the nutmeg, I didn't have any) right into the crockpot. It came out amazing. Next time I would use more apples they were everyones fav!

This recipe is a real winner.  I did make a few changes.  Since there are only 2 of us, I used 2 thick pork chops.  I also added a sliced onion to the apples when I sauted them.  After browning the chops I poured the apples, onions and the sauce over them, covered them, and cooked the whole thing in a 350 oven for about 30 minutes.  During the last 10 minutes I removed to top to help thicken the sauce.  The sauce was only enough for the two of us with very little left over (we are notorious for eating lots of sauce).  I am looking forward to serving this to my mother since it is one of the few recipes I have for pork without garlic (she hates the stuff - go figure!).

Had to put in a fluff rating because it was at 666. Silly, I know ;) Going to make these tonight, will come back and edit my review then.

EDIT TO ADD: These came out SCRUMPTIOUS!! Definately take other reviewers suggestions and bake these. My taste buds were so pleased with this! I used Smart Balance margarine in place of butter and it was still fabulous. The family loved it too. Thanks!

Quick, easy, and yummy - what more could you want in a weeknight meal?  Husband and 5 year old liked it, 1 year old loved the apples.  
I browned the chops in the skillet, then removed them, added the apples and (doubled) brown sugar mixture and simmered that for a few minutes, then added the chops back to the skillet and simmered another 10 minutes or so.  Very good.  Will probably make this again.

I also cooked this in the oven after letting the pork chops marinate in the sauce which I doubled.  I added the apples before putting it in the oven and covered with foil.  Very moist and a fantastic flavor. Thanks!

This is a great recipe. The second time I made it, after cooking chops, I then sauteed chopped onions in butter with brown sugar and added a couple tbsp of balsamic vinegar for about 20 minutes. Then added chops then apples on top...it was nothing short of amazing. Also added some dried sage/savory/oregano. This was from Gourmet magazine. Devine!

Oh man! I literally went weak at the knees when I first tried this! Excellent! I did make several changes though, let's see if I can remember them all....
- Made a rub of cumin, pepper, cinnamon, garlic powder, salt, and oregano and put that on the pork before cooking.
-Caramelized chopped yellow onion in butter before adding apples, etc.
-Added 1 or 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar to the sauce (added a nice, rich, mature flavor)

You've gotta try this!

I loved it but my fiance didnt like it too much, only because hes not a sweet meat kind of guy. When he eats meat he prefers salty/garlicy tastes not sweet. But he still said it was good just not for him.

My hubby is really picky and loved this recipe. I did make some changes however. I salt and peppered the chops and also used some garlic powder. I browned them, set them aside and sauted the apples as directed but doubled the "sauce". I added the apples to the chops and placed them in the oven together to bake 350 for about 30 min. I tried to thicken the sauce after the chops were done baking but we were too hungry to wait. Either way we enjoyed them!

Very tasty--everyone liked this dish. I used Royal Gala and Grandma Smith apples. I also added a bit of cornstarch to thicken the juices a bit.

This was delicious!  I took others advice and after cooking in the skillet, I put everything together in the oven and baked it.  While baking all the flavors get into the meat and it's not as bland as others have said.  The only thing is the caramel sauce thins out while baked.  So all I did was pour the sauce in a small saucepan and boil for 2 minutes and it was thick again.  Definitely double or triple the sauce!  This was a great and different meal.  It wasn't to sweet.  My bf actually really liked it as well, which is always a plus!

Great recipe.  I did alter it based on the other comments.  I doubled the sauce, but not the apples or the chops.  I cooked the apples and sauce until tender poured over the chops and baked at 350 for 30-45 minutes.  I did not add the pecans.

Love these!  We make this often and I generally use a mix of pears and apples, instead of just apples.  Never had a bad meal with this recipe!

My family thought this recipe was just so so.  It is basically pan fried pork chops with very sweet apple pie like filling on top.  Not our cup of tea.

I highly recommend this recipe.  I buy the large pork loins from Sam's Club and slice my own very thick boneless chops.  I made this recipe exactly as written, served with brown rice pilaf to absorb some of the sauce.  It makes a great fall or winter meal.

My new favorite way to eat pork chops.  Make lots of extra 'gravy' as it's really good on potatoes.  I also add some sherry to the sauce, and loved the suggestion to first marinade the chops in 2 T soy sauce and 1 c apple juice.  For the apples I use a quart of home canned apples, which makes them nice and soft after they've cooked in the oven on the pork chops.  So very good.

This is an excellent, easy dish using ingredients I had on hand. I used red delicious apples, since they were the only kind I had. I had 6 large pork chops, so I quadrupled the sauce and it was the perfect amount.

Yummy! I took leftovers to work the next day and it was even better! I changed mine up a little bit, I only browned the chops in the skillet and then placed them in the casserole dish. When I combined the apples with the sugar mixture, I also added a little bit of apple juice. Then, once I poured the apples over the chops, I baked it in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes. SO GOOD! Even without my adjustments though, still a 5 star recipe!

My husband & I enjoyed these chops. I did put the chops back in the pan and let them simmer with the sauce for a little while. I used Granny Smith apples and they where a nice contrast with the sweet of the brown sugar. Thanks for a great idea.

This was a tasty recipe and a nice change for pork chops. I made the recipe as directed (using Honey Crisp apples - an awesome variety available here in Nova Scotia). I found there wasn't a lot of liquid for a sauce after cooking the apples, but after removing the apples from the skillet, I poured the juice that collected from the chops while they were being  kept warm, into the brown sugar-butter mixture and cooked it on low until a sauce consistency. Delicious.

This is great! I tripled the sauce as others suggested. I also browned the pork chops then baked them in the oven at 350. We had this with baked yams and used the extra sauce to drizzle over the yams. My picky four year old loved it.

This is a GREAT recipe and a family favorite. I do use a little less nutmeg to please my family, but otherwise I use the recipe as given.  Granny Smiths are the apples I normally use as well, gives a good tart-sweet contrast.

Excellent recipe! Great for kids as well as company. I used 3/4" chops and seared them in EVOO with onions and garlic, doubled the sauce and added all to the pan in the oven. Could be made all in the oven after searing the chops. DON'T SKIP THE TOASTED NUTS! They really make this recipe special.

I was somewhat disappointed by this recipe as I had high hopes for it given the previous reviews and the ingredient list just seemed to scream 'delicious'! The pork chops were nice and tender but the apple topping did not have a very substantial taste to it so withthe mildness of the pork, it was all rather bland and tasteless.  This made Wolseley's mouth drool, however and the kids loved the apple topping just as an aside.

Great Recipe!!! Like others, I sauteed pork for about 6 min, then baked with sauce and apples for 20 min at 350 with tinfoil over top...then 10 min without foil.  Turned out very good.  I made it with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  Thank you!

First off, I loved the pork.  More importantly, my seven other dinner guests loved the pork!  Few changes though...I didn't use the onion (one guest was allergic), and didn't really measure anything for the sauce.  I put a half a cup of butter, two cups of brown sugar, a tbsp of cinnamon and nutmeg, into a saute pan.  I added the pecans and thinly sliced apples (no coring, just slice off and then into strips) and sauteed until the apple slices were coated with the sauce, and the sauce itself was thick and bubbly.  I used 1 in chops, put them in a baking dish, and poured the sauce mixture over it.  Cover the dish, bake for 30 min at 350, then uncover and bake for another 10 min.  (Used many other recs and sauteed the pork for about 5 min until brown on both sides prior to placing in dish)  It came out beautifully and my kitchen smelled incredible!

Perfect pork chop recipie. I doubled the sauce, diced the apples and added diced onion. Picky husband (not a big apple fan) loved it. Asked me to make it more often. I have tried many other pork chop recipies, but, this is the winner.

I thought these were excellent.  I changed just a couple things though...I doubled the sauce, and for a little added kick, I put in some chopped onions to cook with the apples.  I also added about 2 table spoons of Vinegar to off set the sweetness of all the sugar and apples and to keep the sauce from getting too thick too fast.  I  took the pork chops as suggested in recipe, but when the apples and onions were about 1/2 done, I just put the pork chops right back into the pan with the sauce and continued to cook.  Sooooooo Good and Juicy :).  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This recipe tastes just as wonderful as it sounds!! For added flavor, season the chops before frying. With l5 minutes of cooking time, the chops were very tender. Adding the pecans to the mixture while it is still cooking will help bring out the full flavor of them. I also added l teaspoon of milk and l/2 tsp of vanilla to this mixture.  I would suggest doubling the caramel ingredients for four chops. The caramel apple mixture, minus the pepper, would make a  wonderful and quick dessert as well. I will be making this over and over again. Love it!! Thanks for sharing.

I honestly didn't think that my children liked pork chops until I made these.  They actually ate all of their dinner!  After the oven was heated, I covered the chops with a double amount of the apple/brown sugar mixture and baked for about 20 minutes.  The chops absorbed a lot of the sauce and made them more juicy.  I served with parmesan rice and fresh broccoli for a balanced meal.

I made these pork chops twice, the first time I followed the recipe exactly and last night I made a couple of modifications. I used 1/2 inch thick bone in center cut pork chops. I brined the pork chops for 7 hours in advance in a mixture of 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, 2 tablespoons worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons brownulated sugar, 3 teaspoons salt, 1 tablespoon white sugar, 4 thick sliced garlic cloves, 6 mixed green red and black peppercorns and 1 cup of apple juice. When ready to cook, I drained the pork chops and blotted it really well with paper towels and salted them lightly. I sprayed the pork chops with butter flavor Pam and seared them on med high heat 2 minutes on each side, then put them in a 300 degree oven to cook through while I made the sauce. For the sauce I used the same pan that I seared the pork chops in and doubled up on the butter and sauteed 1 small onion until lightly browned then I added 2 tablespoons of apple juice before I added the apple mixture and spices. I did double up on the sauce mixture. I also toasted the pecans and used them as garnish. When I followed the recipe to a T it was definitely a bit dry and lacking something. The brining did add a lot more flavor and tenderness. Making the sauce in the same pan that the meat was seared in and the addition of onions added a savoriness more suited to meat instead of just a sweet candied flavor. All in all a great starter recipe that leaves room for unique personal touches.

These were pretty good, although not what I expected. They were easy to make, and everyone liked them. My only problem was that the meat was a little tough. That could have been because of the cuts I used. If I make this again with better cuts and it turns out better, I'll change my rating.

There was nothing wrong with this dish - I just found it to be a little...boring.  I only used two pork chops, but I kept the amount of sauce the same, used one larger apple and this worked out well.  I also seasoned my pork chops with salt, pepper and a little Old Bay seasoning.  The only observation I made is that the cook time and prep time are way off in my opinion.  It only took me about 5 minutes to prep for this dish and in total the cook time was done in about 20 minutes.

Excellent fall recipe! My family has requested this repeatedly. I have made it two ways - exactly as the recipes states and as other reviewers have suggested by adding some liquid to the pan in the oven (apple juice) I liked it better with the juice but it was great either way. I have not added the pecans - I'm sure that would make it even better. This is going in to my permanent recipe file. Thanks Karena!

I brined the pork chops for 6 hours before cooking (water, salt, brown sugar and black peppercorns) and that made for very moist chops. The sauce I thinned it with apple juice) and apples with the  pan-fried chops was excellent. Served with cranberry-apple stuffing, mashed sweet potatoes and brussels sprouts braised in apple juice. Wonderful fall meal!

My family loved this one.  My 13-year old asks for it all the time.  I did brown the pecans in a skillet with butter first so they were like candy when I put them on top.  Wonderful!

These were delicious, and perfect for the weather :)  I made these in apple juice.  I also added some apple sauce to thicken the sauce at the end.  This made a delicously sweet pork chop - be careful not to over cook your apples!  I got to use my apple corer for the first time this year!  so the apple slices were perfect!  I did twice the amount of apples and seasonings.  I served mine with angel hair pasta and myzithra (sp?) cheese. Yummy!

Yummy!  I thought this was delicious; several of the children who usually turn up their noses at pork chops had seconds.    My hubby thought it was only ok - but he doesn't care for baked apples either.  I cooked the apple mixture in a separate pan while the pork chops were cooking, so chops and sauce were ready about the same time.  (My pork chops took well more than 6 minutes to cook)  The only other thing I'd change would be to toast the pecans before using as garnish.

This recipe was pretty good.  I am not a big fan of pork chops but I love apples.  I was a little disappointed that the pork didn't have more of an apple flavor, but the apples turned out wonderfully.  I might cook this again.

Very good!  My pork chops were super, super thick and it probably would have been better with thinner ones.  It took way too long to cook them all the way through on the stove, and they got a little tough.  After sitting on the dish in the oven, they juiced out a lot.  Not a problem usually, but when I added the thick, carmel-like sauce to them, the juices thinned out the sauce.  Next time I'd drain off the juice while the sugar sauce was still simmering, add it and let it simmer away.  Very good dish, I loved the apples, they were great!  I only made 2 pork chops but doubled the sauce mixture, throwing in some water when it started to boil down too much.  Used walnuts because I didn't have pecans.  This is something I will try making again!

I used this recipe for a pork roast I cooked in a crock pot. I incresed the recipie for the sauce (used 8x what it orginally called or, and used it to baste the 5lb. roast. The exrta sauce was used as a gravy, and it was outstanding! Everyone loved it, and I will definately use this recipe again for special occaisions!

I absolutely loved this recipe and was so impressed with how easy it was to make. I will definately make this one again! The only thing I would change is the amount of cinnamon mixture, you really need to double or even triple the recipe if you are using a large skillet as it cooks down. I doubles the mix and it turned out awesome!

This recipe is pretty good. The apples are delicious; the pork chops are a tad bland...next time will season them. I made extra sauce and served the apples & chops over white rice.

I doubled the recipe for dinner guests and kept chops warm in oven after browning.  They were moist even after being held in oven for an hour--3/4 inch thick chops is mandatory.  Very nice entree for autumn dinner guests.

This recipe was amazing! The apples really compliment the pork well. I made only two chops but kept the same amount of ingredients for the sauce as called for in the recipe, and it turned out fabulously.

This is our favorite pork chop recipe! My husband doesn't like cinnamon or nutmeg, so when he's home to eat dinner I make it without and it's still really good. I'm not too keen on cooking the pork shops and putting them in the oven to keep warm while the apples cook, so I just cook the pork chops like usual (bake, broil, or grill) and time everything so that the pork chops and apples are done at the same time. Not cooking the apples in the same pan you used to cook the pork chops as the recipe calls for does not change the flavor enough to worry about it. Also, my kids love these apples so sometimes I make them as a side dish. They're a lot like the cinnamon apples that Outback Steakhouse serves.

I made this the other night for my husband and son.  I tried to double the sauce recipe like everyone suggested and wound up using WAY too much brown sugar!  I did carmelize the onions in the butter though and added a touch of lemon to cut the sweet, and I left the skins on the apples to add a little more color.  I served them with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.  As it turned out, all turned out pretty good, considering.  My family loved them, which proves that it's kinda hard to screw this one up.   Try it - you won't be sorry!

Wonderful recipe! My boyfriend loves it so much that every time I have fresh apples, he requests it! I used the same amounts for only two chops, so I had enough sauce. If making with four chops, I would double it.

Very good recipe. I tripled the sauce and glad that I did. It took much longer for my pork chops to be cooked...about 35 minutes. It is a nice change from other pork chop recipes. I recommend it and will be making it again. Thanks!

This was a different dish than I'm use to.  Sweet and filling.  A great blend of flavors and textures.  I'm a new dad and husband so my cooking skills are still significantly over par, but this was just the right blend of exotic and easy.  I'd love to see what it tastes like when it's cooked right.

I'll try it again I'm sure.  I agree, double the sauce though.

I really enjoyed this recipe but I ran into several problems. First of all, there wasn't nearly enough butter for the mixture. Next time I'll melt butter in the pan and melt some more in a bowl and combine with the dry brown mixture so it won't burn on my saucepan. Secondly, I suggest that you watch the apples carefully. I had no idea how long I'd need to watch them, and when they would be good enough to eat. The apples I didn't burn were great and the (very little runny) sauce I could barely pour out of my pan made these tasty. I will definately make it again, I love apples, but next time more butter and more sauce.

Fantastic!!

I tweaked the recipe though and add a bit more nutmeg and cinnamon than the recipe calls for.  I usually put in a tsp. of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg.

These were alright.  My son did not like them much which was a surprise.  I added onions and some garlic salt to the mix in order to spice it up but still feel it was too sweet for a main meal.

This recipe is amazing. My husband never liked pork chops, now he begs me to make these all the time. To save prep time, I just broil the pork chops and mix the sauce and apples in a skillet while it's cooking. Then I pour the sauce and apples on when the chops are done. Delicious!!

This recipe is very good!  The pork chops are a little bland though, so I now season them first with some S&P and allspice.  I also double the sauce, and reserve some to spoon over ice cream for dessert...  Yummy!

These were delicious!  After reading all the suggestions from other posters, I changed the preparation of this recipe.  I brushed the pork chops with olive oil then sprinkled a bit of salt & pepper and placed them in a 9 x 13 pan.  I prepared the apples in a double recipe of the brown sugar & butter sauce.  I used Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of the others in the recipe just to make it a bit simpler.  I then poured the sauce & apples over the top of the chops and baked in a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes.  After baking, I prepared one more quick batch of butter, brown sugar & spices that I spooned over the top of each pork chop after it was on a plate.  They were so beautiful, moist & sweet.  My 6 and 9 year old children loved these!  Thank you Karena for the great recipe.

Different and delicious! My husband loves sweet w/ meats so he adored this. My kids loved it too. Like many of the others here, I also doubled the sauce and cooked the pork longer than the recipe indicates. I threw in some Vidalia onions with the apples and they added a bit of a kick. I also salted and peppered the meat before browning and that helped with the flavor of the pork -- otherwise it might have been bland. All in all, a winner! We'll be having these again soon.

My husband wants to rename this to Holy Cow They're Good Pork Chops!  He loved it!  The were quick, easy and so tender. I had started making this recipe, when I realized I didn't have any apples, so I substituted with plums, I sauteed them in the butter till mushy, then added the remaining ingredients.  When you brown your chops, try using a pork seasoning on them rather than salt and pepper.  The flavor was amazing.  I also added a little liquid smoke while browning, and it smelled heavenly. My husband asked for them twice in the same week, so ya know they gotta be good!

Great recipe.  I doubled the sauce mixture and it was just enough.  Word to the wise, if you do not use "unsalted" butter when making this recipe, cut out the added salt as a seasoning.  I used salted butter and then add coarse salt.  I had to add more brown sugar.  (Not a bad thing).  It came out great.  I also used granny smith apples and walnuts instead of pecans.  Everyone loved this one!

This recipe should be called "Apple Pie Pork Chops" as it tastes more like that than Caramel Apples.

While it was good (and VERY easy to make), I don't know if I'd make it again.  I agree with other reviewers - it's very sweet, and there's definitely not enough sauce - I'd at least double the sauce ingredients.

Overall - good, but not the raves that others have given it.

I made this recipe again and it came out so well I'm rewriting the review. After browning the chops, put them on a plate and put the apple sugar mixture in the pan, let that come to a boil and then return the chops to the pan, put the apples on top and cover. Simmer for about 10 min or until the chops are cooked through. Uncover and cook for a few minutes more until the sauce thickens up (something I didn't do the first time). Double the sauce recipe - this was delicious!!

This was WONDERFUL, Karena!  I don't have kids, but I'd think they would like it, too!  I'll probably double the sauce next time (my husband and I love extra sauce), but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing! Yum yum yum!

Recommend doubling or tripling the sauce, and covering the pork chops with tin foil while they’re warming.

These are delicious and were a huge hit when I made them. You just have to be sure to cut the apple slices very small. I’ve even thought about using applesauce instead.

This is now one of my FAVORITE recipes!  I had our daughter and son-in-law and their 3 kids and our son and his fiance, over for dinner and made these chops and everyone RAVED about them and is already asking when I will make them again! They were absolutely divine! Obviously, I made more than just 4 chops, and I believe I quintupled the sauce (although I only used 4 diced honey crisp apples). My chops were a pork loin I cut into chops and I cut them thick...probably 1 1/2" so I seared them for about a minute and a half on each side, before placing them to the baking dish and pouring the sauce over them. Then I took the advice of others and baked in a 350 oven (for 35 min since they were thick and that was a bit too long).  They were still very good and the spice was perfect....it was sweet and savory!  I served with stuffing and bow tie pasta with a garlic Parmesan sauce. Will DEFINITELY be making these on a regular basis!

It was a hit for my family everyone it was delicious. I did 2 medium apples and 3/4 of a smaller one because I knew everyone would want more. Also added the juices from the sitting chops in with the apples. It does need more sauce and I feel the chops themselves could have used some seasoning as well. Overall there were very few problems /complaints it was simple effort  it turned out visually appetizing  looks like much more effort went into it than what actually did. Definitely adding to the recipe box.

Followed the directions. I got my chops out an hour before i cooked them. Put Paula Deen House seasoning (just a little) on each chop. Covered them in plastic wrap and let them sit out. I think frying them on med-high temp. is the best way. You are searing the meat and it makes the chops more juicier. When finished frying i did place them in the dish in oven but i put a top on. You will get some nice juices. I do this with steak too.  Very good recipe

My Husband LOVES this recipe! I'm also not too much of a pork fan but this is delicious. I do change up the directions though as recommended by another reviewer. I brown the pork chops in a skillet with butter first & place them in a 13x9 baking dish. I then place all the other ingredients besides the apples in the same skillet with the pork juice & then add the apples after the sauce is mixed. I preheat the oven to 350. After the apples are just barely soft I then pour the apples & sauce over my chops & put them in the oven for 20-30". The sauce is a little thin which my husband has never complained about but last night I transferred the juices to the skillet again & added cornstarch to thicken then poured back over my chops on their little display plate & it was absolutely perfect! My husband requests this dish often & said I need to just put it on the weekly meal plan:)

I just made this tonight and it came out wonderfully! The sauce and apples were amazing. Unfortunately, I didn't have any brown sugar so I used a little bit of regular sugar. I added some extra cinnamon, then a pinch of apple juice and the flavor was amazing. I cooked the chops in a cast iron skillet and they came out perfectly. I did put down some apple juice in the bottom of the pan I used to keep the chops warm so they didn't dry out, it was a good choice!

This was really tasty, and perfect for a cool Fall evening.  One caution, however. we found the pork chops pretty chewy. If you want chops, I think they should be cooked tender first, but next time, I think we'll try this one with a tenderloin.

Since I am not a fan of pork chops because they are such a tuff meat I opted to marinate them in apple cider vinegar and cooking sherry (white wine) for a few hours.  I then made the above and spread it over the pork chops and marinade.  I baked it slowly  at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  It was amazing! Sweet and tart and tender.

My go-to recipe! I am always looking for things to cook other than chicken, and keep dinner healthy. This is a favorite in my house, even my 17 month old eats it! (tiny pieces of course) Use a tiny bit of cornstarch mixed with water to add to the sauce to help thicken it up better. I like to add slices of sweet onion, caramelized separately, to the pan while cooking the pork, they add a nice flavor to the pork and come out soo sweet!

My husband and I love this recipe. Biggest tip: the quality of the pork chops makes a huge difference. And caramelized is not quite the right term. We fully cook the pork chops as described (although I cut them in half so they're not as thick), and put them in the oven to keep warm, and prepare the apples as described. Red or green apples work; green gives it a nice bite. Doubling the ingredients for the apples helps. We never manage to get much sauce, but the apples are amazing. ( it's all gluten free naturally!!! Total bonus points!!!)

Made this pretty much as written.  The two main changes I made were to marinate my chops in apple juice first, and to add apple juice to the glaze (and I increased a lot, to have extra).  I also poured the glaze/apple mixture over my chops & baked for 30 minutes (I used extra thick chops).  My youngest ate it with no complaints, so it's TRULY a keeper!  Dinner is normally always a struggle with him.  Thanks much, Karena!!!

My husband and my son loved this.  I'm not a sweet meat fan but even I enjoyed this dish.  I rubbed the chops with olive oil and sprinkled tony's chacheres Cajun seasonings, pan fried about 5 minutes each side. Removed from skillet, added 1/2 stick margarine, 1/2 of a chopped onion, sauteed. Added the spices and sugars, and apple slices. Cooked about 5 or so minutes.  Put chops into a 9x13 dish topped with the onion/apples mixure.  Cooked at 350 for 30min. Easy to do.

I only needed 2 fat pork chops, but kept the rest of the ingredients and ended up liking the amount of sauce for our meals. When the chops were done browning, I moved them to a greased casserole, deglazed the frying pan with a shot of white wine and added the rest of the ingredients including a sliced onion. After the apple mixture cooked through, they were added to the casserole and baked in a 350 oven for 30 minutes covered, 15 minutes uncovered. My husband isn't a big pork fan, but even he liked these so we'll definitely do them again. Thanks for the recipe.

This was delicious!  Rather than cook on stovetop, I browned the seasoned meat, made the sauce, and cooked in the slowcooker.  Next time I will cut down the cooking time but the flavor was amazing.

I browned the chops in the butter, put them in a baking dish, then fried onions and apple together in the pan. I then added a small amout of butter, pecans, Brown sugar, cinnamon, and some golden raisons. I needed to add a bit of apple juice. Then I poured this mixture over the chops and baked for 1 hour at 350. Pretty good.

I absolutely love the idea of this recipe!  Wanted this flavor and all I did was grill the chops (we had loin chops), added thin sliced onion to the apples, and a touch of cayenne.  Other wise, the sugar ans spices were perfect!  I am so excited!  Thank you!!

I used pork steaks because that was what I had- baked at 350. Pork was smothered in applesauce with sliced apples and brown sugar topping for half an hour covered, then 15 minutes uncovered. Once the pork was nearly cooked, put everything in a pan, added rum, molasses and cornstarch and let it reduce, put the pork back under the broiler until finished cooking. Delicioso!

Omitted the pecans, but included the rest of the ingredients. Seasoned the pork chops with season salt, black pepper, garlic and a little smoked chipotle powder.  I threw everything in a casserole dish and cooked it for 45 minutes.  The pork chops were so tender and juicy.  Simply Delicious!

My whole family loves these!  Even my picky 6 year-old.  I always brown the chops in the pan, set them aside while I make the sauce (add an onion!), and then add them back in to bake with the apples and sauce.  So easy and no need for the oven at all.  Oh, and definitely double the sauce!

Excellent when prepared exactly as written. The thickness and quality of the pork chop as well as the type of apple will impact your final results. I used about 3/4 in. thick pork chop and granny smith apples and it was wonderful. Because I had other stuff in the oven I chose to bake my chops in lieu of frying and prepared the apples as directed. The amount of spice was just right for me as it let the apple flavor shine through instead of making it taste like apple pie. Served this with great northern beans and cornbread and received raves from my family!

I found the chops to be very flavorful, but the rest was lacking. This recipe needs some changes for sure. One reviewer suggested using applesauce...may try that next.

My husband ADORES these. I took the advise of a reviewer and marinated them in soy sauce and apple cider (two parts cider to one part soy). I increased the sauce by half and now have a go to, easy, IMPRESSIVE recipe for life!

I had some sirloin porkchops at hand and decided to try this recipe. I read the review about making it in oven so I decided to take that route.

For the caramel sauce, I failed horribly the first time. I had some butter I accidentally had melted the day before sitting on the counter(fat and liquid had been separated) I used that and perhaps that's where it went wrong? The sauce was burnt, tasted bitter(not to mention burning my tongue while tasting! It is VERY hot so be careful if anyone wants to taste the sauce like I did) I used a shiny metal sauce pan and used highest heat setting.

Second time, I used fresh butter from the fridge, and used medium heat, and used non-stick T-fal pan and it turned out better. I was expecting gravy like sauce so it was a bit of a surprise to get dry looking sauce with not much volume(I doubled the sauce too)
I rubbed this all over the pork chops and mixed the rest with the apples.
In a baking pan, I layered very thinly sliced onions, then the porkchops, then apples. I also added some sliced mushroom and few pecans on top. baked 50min covered at 350 degrees. 

The result: Tasted good. Not amazing but good enough. Pork wasn't as tender or flavourful as I expected.(bit dry and tough) There was so much juice everything was swimming in it! I am a beginner when it comes to cooking. Perhaps I didn't do the best job. Since I like the bled of spices used here and I like some sweetness to my food, I'll make this recipe again and see if it gets better!

If it didn't have the apples there would be no taste, If I made it again I think I would bake it in the oven along with the apple mixture over it to give it some more taste...

I made this recipe tonight with a few modifications and it came out great! I had a mess of apples on hand from fall apple picking and pork chops defrosted, so this worked out great. I browned my chops in my cast iron skillet, then transferred them into a baking dish. I deglazed the skillet with some white wine, then added the butter and some apple sauce. I mixed in the sugar/spices and cooked until the apples were a little bit soft, then I dumped them into the baking dish on top of the chops. Threw the whole thing into the oven at 400 for about 20 minutes. Served with roasted butternut squash and fresh green beans. This was a great fall meal!

I took the advice of another poster and bought a larger can of apple pie filling and added some butter to it (about 4 - 5 TBSP). I warmed it up on the stove and placed the sauce/apples on the pork. I baked at 350 for about 35 mins. Next time I will marinate the pork the night before and only cook 25 - 30 mins b/c the pork was a bit tough. However, the flavors were delicious! I paired this with butternut squash and some rolls. This is a great fall meal!

They were tasty and will probably become a regular at our dinner table. I didn't get so much of a caramel sauce as sugary butter...it looked greasy, but it didn't affect the taste. I also sauteed some onions first, then added apples and double sauce ingredients.

made this the other night, and it was delicious. made it stove top-browned the pork-made the sauce and added apples to that while waiting, and poured the sauce with apples over pork ( cut it down to one apple which was plenty for the amount of pork i made) and used apple-raspberry juice when i was getting low on sauce in the pan bcoz that is all i had..it was delicious!!we are BIG desert fans but not so much into sweet meals..but this was terrific..even my pork hater husband loved it!!

Love it. So easy to make. I had a grill pan cooking the porkchop, and a separate small saute pan cooking the apple so I didn't need to use the oven.
I served them with spring mix salad with homemade dressing (honey, olive oil, italian aged vinegar heated in microwave) and sprinkled crushed pecan. Will make it again someday.

This recipe is yummy and really easy, made even easier by using Terri's tip of using apple pie filling instead of all the work of prepping apples, and I love her addition of nuts. I find that my family likes it best with the Hormel Cinnamon Apples (found with the refrigerated sides in the meat section). Makes a quick and delicious weeknight meal!

Really solid recipe.  Because I didn't need all 4 servings, I halved the recipe.  Then only change overall, is I needed to add some water (3 TBSP) to the sauteeing apples to prevent everything from sticking.  Really delicious!

This was a great recipe!  Pork can be so boring but this was easy and delicious.  We're going to remember the sauce for just about anything and the apples were such a great surprise--I was skeptical because I don't really like warm fruit, but they were my favorite part!

My husband and I really liked this recipe. I would suggest to either double or triple the sauce recipe. Will definitely be making this recipe again!

This was like "grown up" apples n porkchops. So good! I coated my chops first in seasoned flour to get them nice and brown. Keeping this recipe!

We NEVER eat pork, but were given pork chops from Omaha Steaks as a Christmas gift.  Used this recipe to cook them and LOVED it.  It took less than 30 minutes from start to finish.   Only change we made was onions.  We caramelized an onion in the butter before cooking the apples and caramel sauce. It was awesome.  We will now be eating pork chops regularly.

There was no consensus in my house on this recipe. Half thought it was merely okay, but the rest of us totally prefer the salty fried version of pork chops and could not finish eating this dish. I guess we are creatures of habit, because a sweet pork chop didn't do it for us. It turned out really pretty, but I will not be making it again.

Great Recipe!  My family loved it.  The only change I would make is to double the carmel sauce.

I am not a big fan of pork chops but my family loved this recipe. I cooked the chops in the broiler for 15-20mins, added some onions, then added the apple mixture and cooked them in the over for another 20-30mins.

This was great! Husband LOVED the apples! The only thing I really did different was add more brown sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon (we love our sauce), and I put in 2 thinly sliced shallots. AMAZING!! Will make again for sure!

Pretty tastey, Made as directed, but doubled sauce not apples.  Chops were seasoned with Seasonal and pepper, tad bland, will work on that next time. Will make again, fast and easy!

The sauce had great flavor but the chops did nothing for me. I really wanted this recipe to be wonderful because it was so pretty and so easy to make...but it just didnt do it for us. Needs lots of seasoning before you brown!

I have been using this recipe for a few years now and it is always a big hit. My hunny says that it is heart (through his stomach that is) I always triple the sauce and go a little heavier on the spices. Also, I have never used unsalted butter, so if you don't have it, dont worry!

This was amazing! I am a very new cook and this was so so easy and SO yummy! I read the reviews and did it the easy way  - broiled the chops in the oven while mixed the sauce ingredients and apples on the stove top. I used 2 chops and found they took closer to 10 minutes on each side in the oven. I still doubled the sauce (according to everyone else's suggestions) just because the ratio of sauce to apples seemed small. I cannot wait to have company over and impress them with this dish!!

I followed other users' advice on doubling the glaze and marinating the chops overnight in apple juice & soy sauce. Served with some plain mashed potatoes, this was the perfect fall meal!

I am surprised at the rating on this one. The chops were very blande.  I wish there would have been some wetness to the apples. The flavor was great on them, but it wasnt like they poured over the chops, just laid on top and were dry.  Wont be making again.

I have made this three times and my husband always asks for seconds. I paired it with roasted zucchini and steamed broccoli. I did end up adding a nothing Tbsp. of butter and added some more brown sugar for more sauce.

amazing amazing -- perfect fall recipe. I marinaded the pork chops in a combo of Worcestershire sauce, sage, garlic, salt and pepper before cooking, just to add a savory kick to contrast the sweet sauce. Also used bone-in Berkshire pork chops from D'Artagnan...amazing

this is soooo good, I claim it as my specialty! Only thing I do different is add a couple dashes of balsamic vinegar to the apple sugar mix before poring it on, adds a little contrast to the sweetness.

Okay so I cooked this differently. I browned my thin chops in the pan with house seasoning, and then put them in a oven safe pan, lined with foil and brown sugar. I placed the chops on that, then cooked the apples in the pan as directed. Poured the apples over the chops, and then baked everything for 20 minutes at 375. I also sprinkled more brown sugar on top. I served with savory stuffing and mixed veggies. And als o made caramel corn for dessert!!! Great meal thanks so much...

The sauce made from the apples and brown sugar was really great but the chops lacked in flavor. Next time I'll marinade the chops before cooking. I will definitely be making the sauce again! Good stuff!!!

We made quite a few changes to this, but it turned out great.  Butter instead of oil.  Did not use pecans or the nutmeg in the sauce.  Cooked the chops in the butter on the stovetop in a skillet.  Removed chops when they were a little golden.  Cooked the apples and the sauce ingredients in the skillet, covering them for a few minutes.  Added the chops on top and covered it and cooked the whole thing another 5-8 minutes.  Was a HUGE HIT!!  Everyone LOVED this.  A keeper definitely!

My sister sent this recipe to me after we had to start eating gluten free at our house. SO yummy! Doesn't taste gluten free! I made the apple/brown sugar mixture and quadrupled it as suggested by others. I put our pork chops in the crockpot, poured the apple mixture over it, and set it on low for 4 hours. Wonderful, and the pork was fall-apart tender. Even my extremely picky 2-year-old loved it-and that's a HUGE deal since he won't eat any meat at all! Thanks so much!

I have made this twice now and my family LOVES it. I seasoned chops with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I quadrupled the sauce ingredients, but not the butter, and cooked the chops with Pam instead of veg oil. The 1st time I cooked in oven and sauce was too thin. Tonight I followed the recipe and cooked on stovetop. After removing the apples I cooked the sauce until thick and spooned it on the chops/apples once on our plates. That way it didn't thin out from mixing with chops and juice from the apples. I've never tried the pecans but it's delicious w/o them. This is DEFINITELY a keeper!

Didn't quite follow the recipe - made sauce in a skillet and softened the apples a bit, then drizzled it on the four raw pork chops and baked for an hour.  The sauce turned out runnier than I'd like, but then, I didn't follow the directions.  Very delicious, though!!  Will make again!!

I always make the recipe exactly as written the first time so I can review it honestly. This was very good, however, next time I will marinate the chops to tenderize them. I will also double the amount of sauce...then it will be perfect. Thank you for a very good recipe.

Loved this recipe! I was a little concerned that it might be too sweet so I salted the pork chops a little bit before I cooked it. I also sauteed onions separately, adding cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, pepper to it to serve on top of the pork chop for a more savory flavor.

I really liked this recipe and it was fairly easy to make. I left off the pecans on the top because I didn't have them on hand but will def. add the next time I try it.

I really like this but after putting the apples in the caramel sauce and straining them with a slotted spoon there wasn't much sauce left to drizzle over the pork chops and apples. So i ended up making more of the caramel sauce and used the let overs as a dipping sauce. My family loved it.

This was really yummy! I subbed white sugar with molasses for brown sugar just because I didn't have any, and doubled the sauce and the apples. A big hit with the family!

The  pork chops didn't have as much flavor as I expected. Should be slow baked in the oven for a juicier more tender chop.

Absolutely delicious! Made this recipe as is (without the pecans since we didn't have any). Very easy to make and healthy!

Update: Toasted the pecans in the pan after adding the apples and reduced sauce to the pork chops. The pecans are a wonderful accompaniment to this dish! This recipe is such a keeper. What a great way to get rid of apples before they spoil. I've used a variety of apples, all taste well with the chops!

Just chopped apples and added in pan with all other ingredients.  Broiled chops and put topping on them once they were finished- delicious and easy. Just didnt make alot of 'sauce' at all- apples sucked it all up.

Thank you so much for this recipe, I loved it!! I thought I would have leftovers for lunch since my husband doesn't even like pork chops but we ate all 4 of them and he said he would eat them again. I would recommend to at least triple the sauce and next time I am going to add something to make it a little thicker. I also baked it in the oven based on other reviews and they turned out perfect. Can't wait to make again!!

This was a hit with my husband, even said it tasted like a "dish from a restaurant".   I did a few things differently: I seasoned my chops with salt & pepper and seared them in an iron skillet with butter until both sides were brown. Then I let it sit while my apples were getting done. With the apples, I also added, ground cloves and pumpkin pie spice. Once the apples were done, I poured both the apples and the sauce over the chops and put them in the oven @ 250 for about 30-40min.  They were DELISH!!

Really good, prepared sauce exactly as given except I only used one apple and two pork chops.  I sliced the apple, but would probably suggest chopping it.  Thanks!!

I took the advice of other reviewers and marinated the pork chops overnight in 1 1/2 quarts apple juice, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1/4 cup salt.  I then make the sauce while the oven is preheating to 325 degrees.  Instead of pan frying them, I bake them for 20 minutes in the marinade and top it off with the brown sugar mixture.  IT IS AMAZING!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE!  just make sure you marinate everything and bake it afterward, it really does make a big difference.

This was only our second time cooking with pork, and it turned out great! We ended up quadrupling the sauce, while keeping the same amount of apples. Victoria thought it was absolutely spectacular! Andrew, who has never really eaten pork, found he was not too fond of the cut of meat. We both, however, love the sauce and will definitely use it with other meats.

These were delicious! I accidentally cooked the apples a little too long, so it tasted a little burned, but my family couldn't get enough. My boyfriend said they were the best pork chops he's ever eaten! Even my picky brother who generally doesn't like fruit enjoyed these.

This recipe was amazing! my guests loved it! I did marinate the chops for a few hours in soy sauce and 1/2c apple sauce, and tripled the carmel sauce. I browned the chops before putting them in the oven for 25 min. Perfect!

Very good, kids and hubby all loved it. I really enjoyed it too. Used one large red delicious apple on three thin pork chops. Seasoned chops with seasoned salt, pepper, onion pwdr, garlic pwdr, seared in hot skillet, Made sauce first- added some apple cider vinegar to brown sugar mixture and butter and apple slices, and added 1 TBSP of corn starch, turning it into a thick glaze which was perfect. Oh- also caramelized onions in separate pan and covered seared chops with onions, then glaze, then slightly tender apples. Then cooked in oven on 350 for about 12 min- juicy, tasty, perfect. Served with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies. Never given 5 stars before- Definite repeat.

This sounded tasty, but it wasn't for us. We did not care for the seasoning mix--too much nutmeg, didn't like the pepper. (Made exactly according to recipe.) I, nor my children, liked it.

These are sooooo good!!!!  I always double the sauce ingredients, but not the apples.  I also just brown on stove, then finish cooking with apples in oven at 400 degrees until done.  I pour half the sauce over them when servng, but also put the other half in little bowls on the table, we all love to dip!!!

The concept sounds perfect but I have once again made tough dry pork chops. I love this sauce combination and will use again, but have to find a different way to cook the pork so it turns out moist and tender. Something I can't seem to do with pork unless I roast it in a bag, like a pork roast.

A nice change for pork chops.  Quick and easy, but double the sauce. The cook time for the chops is a bit off. Mine were quite a bit thinner and they took at least 15 minutes to cook. I didn't transfer the cooked chops to the oven because I didn't want them to dry out. Instead I made the apples and sauce in a smaller skillet while the meat cooked. Thanks for the great recipe, Karena!

Sauce didn't work according to recipe. Apples had great flavor, but pork was bland without sauce.

Oh My God these were delish!!!! I wasn't sure about the sweet caramel sauce with meat but it was perfect. My husband was floored it was so good. I used granny smith apples and next time I will double the sauce to make more caramel goodness to drizzle over the chops. I used thick cut pork chops so I had to cook them for about 20 min. instead of the 5min. the recipe states. A new family favorite.

I made this last night and was excellent! I used honeycrisp apples since I already had those. I also used a sweet onion and caramelized it in the butter before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients which makes it a really nice savory/sweet addition. I wouldn't make this without the onions because I feel it really makes the recipe unless onions aren't your favorite. I ended up doubling the sauce once I had everything in there because I felt it needed more than the recipe called for..very easy to double and tweek the sauce to your liking. Overall VERY simple, VERY tasty.

These were great! I dredged with flour and browned both sides in a skillet before placing them in baking dish, then added the apples and sauce and cooked for 40 minutes.

LOVED IT!  My husband could not stop talking about this recipe.  I took others suggestions and added carmalized onions (we are onion lovers) and a little apple cider. The only other thing I would do next time is make more of the apple mixture and more apple cider for a little wetter topping.  I did however, forget to add the pecans, next time.

Loved this....did add onion with the apples (used 4 med/large) - and tripled the sauce.  My husband turned up his nose when I said I wanted to try this but he is eating his words tonight - not overly sweet, just right....

It has potential for 5 stars but needs a little tweaking...the recipe as is doesnt make any sauce at all so I would triple the buttery mix so that youll have some sauce to drizzle on the chops. The amount of apples could stand to be doubled as well. Instead of teh suggested 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and cinnamon, I used 1/2 tsp of both and it came out great! All of these flavors together and delicious! Ill definately make this again.

Very good but could use a bit more body.  Adding a bit of onion to the apples and a pinch of Chipotle really completes this dish!

Fabulous! A very tasty, "fall" recipe.  I used fresh apples we picked last weekend, served with baked potato and green beans.  The only thing I did different from the recipe, was save some of the brown sugar mixture to thicken my sauce. Everyone loved it!

I deglazed the pan with a shot of good bourbon, let the alcohol cook off then proceeded with making the sauce and apples.  Was a very good dish and I would make it again.

I made the recipe as written.  I doubled the sauce because I read reviews saying I should -- but it didn't need it.  When you make the recipe as written there are juices from the chops in the bottom of the baking dish you keep the chops in, if you pour the sauce on top of the chops, all the juices meld wonderfully and the sauce is stretched even more -- plenty enough for the chops.  I even dipped some red garlic mashed potatoes in it (who doesn't like pure sugar on mashed potatoes?  ;).  Overall, a great flavor.

After reading previous reviews, I decided to take the advice and make a few changes to the basic recipe. I sauteed an onion along with the apples and sauce. I also tripled the sauce amount. These were very tasty, and a nice change from the typical pork chops in a gravy sauce. I will definitely make these again.

I made this last night, and i am using this for a dinner party, however i was having a little trouble with the sauce, Can anyone help me with this?  Did anyone make this sauce without the oil or less butter?  I felt as if the sauce was too oily, did anyone else have the problem? Also, thanks for the all the tips with baking the chops and marinating it.  It just came out so full of flavory!

My DH is from New England and he said that this meal reminds him of home.  I marinated overnight as suggested by others and the flavor was great. My little one did not like the nutmeg taste though, that is why I can only give this 4 stars.

I was looking for an apple compote recipe to go with pork chops.  This one is pretty simple and good.  I did make a couple of changes.  I dredged the pork chops in egg and flour before frying.  Then I added the apples, spices along with 1 cup of apple cider and a few sprigs of thyme and let it reduce down for about 5 minutes.  Turned out great!

This was good but I think I cooked the sauce too long therefore it became solid. My husband really enjoyed it as did my 2 picky eating children. I'll make this again but will not keep the sauce on for too long.

This is a great recipe ! We had my father over for dinner a few nights ago and he turned up his nose at the idea of carmel apple pork chops. The only pork chops he ever eats are smotherd in gravy. When he tried it he ate every single bite and went back for seconds ! I went with what other users sugested and trippled the sauce amount. I just cook up the sauce, place the chops in a baking dish, pour the sauce and the sliced apples over the top and bake it coverd in the oven. Its amazing and very filling !

This recipe was AWESOME! I made some brown rice....and by the time the rice was done...so were the pork chops. I put some rice on the plate...then a pork chop on top of the rice...some apple on top of the pork chop....drizzled a tablespoon or two on top of everything ~~ served with a vegetable, it was the perfect meal! I used the weight watchers calculator for the info posted on this recipe...and it comes up as a 6 point recipe ~~ YUMMO!

We enjoyed these a lot! I cooked the sauce on the stove until it thickened up (added a little cornstarch) then poured it over the pork chops and baked at 350 degrees for 45 mins. They were perfect! Thanks!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! My husband would never eat pork chops before but these changed his mind.Plus, my daughter who eats nothing if it isn't breaded devoured them. Keep this recipe the way it is, it's perfect!

These were great!  I followed the alterations by reviewer KJABER.  The only changes I made to her review was that I marinated the pork chops for about 5 hours in apple juice and soy sauce, and pan seared them before baking.   The whole family enjoyed dinner tonight, thanks!!!

This is one of our favorite meals to make!  The flavors compliment eachother so well.  Grass fed pork from the farm, juicy organic apples fresh from the farm and you have one mouth watering meal!

I almost feel like it is doing it an injustice reviewing it here, when I made so many changes, but would like to respect the original poster. Here is what I did:   I used 6 Pork chops, seared them on both sides in a frying pan with 1TSP olive oil, then set into a casserole dish. I then used a stick of butter, melted that, and added 8 tsp brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I cut peeled and cut up 4 granny smith apples and tossed them in there too. After the sauce was bubbly, and the apples slightly cooked, I poured the whole thing over the pork chops in the casserole dish, covered it, and baked in a 350° oven for 30-45 minutes (I checked it at 30mins.. wasnt quite done so i kept it in for 45mins). It was juicy, succulent, and delicious. Will definitely put into our regular rotation.

I made this on the stove-top and it turned out pretty well.  The caramel apple flavor was a little strong, but otherwise it tasted really good.

Made this for supper when guests were over and they loved it.  I used some of the hints from others.  I made the sauce as directed using Granny Smith apples but I poured it over the pork chops and baked it at 350F for 45 minutes covered with foil.  Turned out moist and sweet.  Even my hubby who does not like pork chops loved this. I will so make this again.

Very Very good!  My husband called it "Apple Pie w/ Pork Chops" I doubled the sauce by making an extra batch after taking out the apples.  I bet you could stretch the sauce without adding more butter by using drippings from the pork chops.

This is a great recipe.  I did add some apple juice and cider vinegar for extra flavor but didn't change anything else.  I will be making this recipe often.

Awesome!! Starting out I thought it would end up bland but it makes an awesome sauce. And the apples were to die for!! Add the pecans they make it awesome. I made this with Maple Mashed Sweet Potatoes and fresh green beans and it paired nicely!

Wonderful! This was so good. I did bake it and double the sauce. Next time I will marinade it overnight. The meat was bland, but with the sauce and apples it really was great!

Sorry, but even taking the time necessary to marinate this in advance, as some reviewers had suggested, it was just an ok dish.  Nothing that stands out.  The sauce is good but not enough to make me try making this again.

Are you sure the amounts of the ingredients for the sauce were enough?  Maybe I overcooked the sauce and it boiled away, but for some reason I wound up with almost no sauce at all, just some pan drippings.  Otherwise, I'm sure this would have been a really good recipe.

This was really good.  The flavor of the sauce and apples was amazing, but my pork didn't have much flavor.  I made this exactly as stated with the exception of tripling the sauce as other suggested.

After reading the reviews and trying this one a few times, I used the oven bake method instead of pan frying the pork chops. I use double the amount of apple mixture, and bake it along with the chops. And because I don't like 'porky' pork, I marinate the chops overnight using the "Marinated Pork Chops" recipe.

Wow!!  This recipe is a definite keeper.  We all loved it.  I followed some other reviewers ideas and more then doubled the sauce and I also baked the chops once I had browned them up in the frying pan.  I will be making this over and over.

What a simple, yet delicious recipe!  I used 2 butterflied pork chops, followed the recipe exactly and it turned out to be the perfect amount for 2 people!  The pecan pieces on top really prefected it and spaghetti squash made a lovely side :)  I will definitely be making this again!

This is a good recipe,but it does need a LOT more sauce-and I salt and pepper the chops a good amount also or they're kind of bland underneath all the goodness. But it's overall a pretty tasty dish.

This was a tasty and easy recipe, though my husband and I honestly didn't care for the sweetness of the sauce.  If I make this again, I'll most likely just use butter and a small bit of lemon juice rather than the sugary sauce over the chops.

My husband didn't like it at all and I ate a little of it but it's just too much. The brown sugar mixture needed to be practically quadrupled. After only a feew mins on the plate the sauce became hard...maybe it's me...not a fan.

Chops had next to no flavour. The amount of sauce based on what the recipe called for was limited to say the least. 
Next time I would get thinner chops and double the incredients that go into making the sauce.

I tried this recipe last week, and i wasn't really sold on it. I was hoping the taste would be great, but it just didn't seem to work for me. there didn't seem to be enough sauce, and the porkchop itself didn't seem to work well with the sauce. I'll give it another go at another time.

The apples were great, the pork lacked flavor.  We will try it again and make sure to pay attention to the pork chop before cooking it.

An instant favorite!  I broiled the chops while cooking the apples on the stove.  I boiled a large sweet potato at the same time for mashed sweet potatoes.  Start to finish was 20 min for the whole meal!  I did double the sauce, but I think the totally depends on the size of your apples.  I also think broiling or grilling is always best for pork chops.  They have to cook fast or they dry out.

This is my new favorite way to cook pork chops. The flavor was fantastic - I did alter how I prepared it by using someone else's advice and just throwing all the sauce ingredients into one saucepan and cooking it up. I also put my apples in a food processor to chop them up into smaller pieces. Then I poured the sauce over the porkchops in a baking pan and baked them in the oven for an hour instead of cooking them on the stovetop. They tuned out moist and really yummy! My whole family, including my mom who joined us for dinner, really loved it.

I was going to give this four stars because I thought the recipe was poorly written and a little confusing but these were so good that I couldn't give any less than five stars. I don't think I've EVER had such good pork chops before! I pan seared the chops first, then I made the sauce in the same pan. After reading the reviews, I doubled the sauce and added about half of an onion. Then I topped the chops with the sauce and baked at 350 for an hour. They were so good that I ate two! Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic flavors. Followed some suggestions and marinated in orange juice and soy during the day plus roasted everything in the oven for about 40 minutes. Really good recipe with not too much hassle, will definitely make again.

Wow.  I didn't think I'd like caramel apples on my pork chops, but I did.  A lot.

My husband made this and the only change he made was using a small amount of red wine to deglaze the pan before adding the rest of the ingredients.

I LOVED THESE!!  Here in Georgia, especially in the fall, you can find some great apples.  There is even an Apple Festival, which is where I got the apples to make this wonderful dish.  I served with mashed sweet potatoes and sauteed green beans.  It truly captured the flavors of fall.  We will make this again for sure!

This is a quick and easy recipe. I did make a few modifications because I wanted a little more of a kick. I braised the pork chops, then put them in a covered dish in the oven to bake. I added a sliced yellow onion with the apples to the braising, along with a tablespoon of maple syrup as well as a teaspoon of coarse dijon mustard. After the onions and apples had softened, I added them to the baking dish with the pork chops and baked them for five more minutes. Next time I'll add a little more mustard and maybe a splash of apple cider vinegar.

These chops are so good.  I did season them prior to cooking them, but instead of cooking them on the stovetop, I did bake mine in the oven.  I added them to the sauce and apples to keep them warm while the mushroom medley also from this site was finishing.  The sauce does need to be at least tripled.  This is a fantasic recipe.  Great fall dinner!  Thanks for sharing.

This worked out really well for.

I made no changes to the recipe. I did double the butter/brown sugar/spices only to make enough sauce to cover the apples I used AND the pork chops.

Super easy and a real hit with the family. I served it with homemade stuffing that I added cut up apples and matchstick carrots to. It was a filling and tasty dinner.

Made a few changes, used 2 boneless pork chops which I marinated overnight in apple juice and a bit of soy sauce.  I also did the final cooking in my toaster oven rather than using my big oven since the pork chops were already cooked.  I used two granny smith apples and could have doubled the sauce....it was very good and my hubby loved them--stayed nice and moist. Served with mashed potatoes and butternut squash--great fall dish...thank you Karena for sharing.

So delicious! I used Garam Masala instead of cinnamon and it turned out absolutely amazing! Gave it a little more earthy\spicey flavor instead of just the plain ol' cinnamon sugar deal. Very very good recipe, will definitely make again!

This was alright.  My dh really liked it, but I just thought it was okay.  The kids didn't really care for it.  I used my apple peeler/corer/slicer for the apples, which was a breeze.  However, I found that while I was caramelizing the apples, there wasn't much sauce afterwards.  Next time I will make more sauce with the apples.

YUMMY!  In trying to make it lower in fat and sugar - I cut out the oil and just browned in a skillet with Pam.  I used Brown sugar Splenda in place of the brown sugar (and did double the sauce & apple ingredients).  I cooked the sauce and apples in the same skillet that I browned the pork chops and after they were tender - I added the pork chops back in, stirring to coat with sauce (and to warm).  We LOVED it!  I will certainly be making this again.

This recipe was just the thing I was looking for to begin the fall! After reading other reviews, I doubled the sauce and not a single drop went to waste! I served it with mashed sweet potatoes and green beans tossed with garlic and onion. It was the perfect salty/sweet combination for a complete meal. I did run a little short on the nutmeg, but still thoroughly enjoyed the meal! I will definately be making this again!

i cooked only 2 chops, used 1 apple, but left everything the same. if i were to make it again, i would double the ingredients in the sauce... there didn't seem to be enough to glaze over the pork chops. i would also cut the apples very fine, so they are bite-sized

I made this on a whim and it was a huge hit. We even had friends over, and one doesn't eat pork chops, and he told his wife that she could make these for him anytime. I'm not even a chops fan, but this one I can eat. Very yummy.

My husband and teen daughter did not care for this recipe at all.  My daughter took one bite and refused to eat it.  My husband ate it I think so he wouldn't hurt my feelings.  I thought it was ok, but won't make it again.

I've cooked a bunch of recipes from All Recipes, but I think this is my favorite!  I used the apple juice/ soy sauce marinade suggested by TERRI MCDANIEL and let chops soak overnight.  I cooked the meat on the grill and did the apples in a pan as described in the recipe.  Came out great!  I'll definitely be making this again.

Don't ya just hate those reviews where someone says "we loved the idea but we ended up making something entirely different but we're going to review your recipe anyway?"  Yep, that's what I did.  I was worried about how sweet the sauce sounded "apple pie on pork chops" so I carmelized some onions and stirred up the sauce using my usual eyeball and dump method and then I added some soy sauce to it as well.  The sauce is sweet, mellow and tangy all at once-the perfect compliment to chops.

WOW - this was really good.  I had taken some pork chops out of the freezer and was looking for something to do with them and found this recipe.  What a treat.  I did add the onions like others did and I added a touch of chicken broth just to give it a little more "sauce".  Delicious!!  I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that this goes great with mashed potatoes!

Great recipe, similar to one I have used before. I usually brown the chops, put them in a dish and slightly cook apples with the brown sugar and spice, put on top of chops and into the oven.  It caramelizes and is yummy. I leave the skins on the apples and I add a little ground cloves...smells so good when it is baking!

My whole family really enjoyed this recipe!  The only thing I would change for next time is use more apples and make more of the sauce.  I also made the sauce at the same time as I cooked the chops...just seemed to make more sense to do that rather than get the oven going to keep things warm.  Will surely make this again!

I liked this recipe. It was a little different though so I will probably only be making this on rare occasions. My boyfriend thought it was good but he couldnt tell if he was eating dinner or dessert and got a craving for apple pie, haha. I had a problem with the sauce. As the apples sauteed, covered the LITTLE liquid that had formed evaporated. So I was basically left with sliced apples so this is what I did (Although, it might sound a bit odd...it worked out great). I put about a cup of hot water in a measuring cup and added some flour,mixed it up really well and poured in the apples. It lacked flavor so I added more cinnamon, netmeg and brown sugar. Igot a really nice sweet sauce from this which had a very nice consistancy due to the flour. Also, I added the chops to the apple mix and coated them inthe sauce and let it cook (covered) for about 5 minutes. Pairs really nicely with steamed carrots (which also taste really good withthe sauce).

Loved it!  Using other people's suggestions, I used 2 skillets instead of the warming plate which made it quicker to prepare.  I also put an onion in with the apples and I love the combination.  I also doubled the amount of sauce.  I served it with quinoa and a side of mixed veggies.

This is an incredibly delicious pork chop recipe! Easy to prepare, too.  I agree with another review, that you will want to make extra of the caramel apple sauce - it is wonderful!

I thought these pork chops were excellent! I did make a few changes though. I didn't have any apples so I used apple sauce instead, which turned out really well. I also put everything in the slow cooker for about 5-6 hrs, and it came out perfect and tender. Delicious!

Wow - this was delicious!  I didn't think there was enough sauce, so after I put the apples over the pork chops in the oven, I added another tbsp of butter and another tbsp of brown sugar to the pan and cooked it up with the rest of the sauce.  Sooooooo good!

It was O.K. The timing was a bit wrong, it took more like 20-30 minutes. Also, make sure you don't buy thin pork chops! Mine were dry! But, other than that this turned out very well. There was no "sauce" though... that was a little disapointing. I tried adding some more water but it still was only about 1/2 cup of sauce. The apples were very good though! I served this with ravioli with white sauce and asparagus. Will make again!

Was a big hit in my house!  I used a little olive oil in the skillet instead of brushing the chops with oil.  Based on other reviews, I did double the brown sugar, butter, nutmeg and cinnamon, and used 2 Granny Smith apples.  Oh, and I wouldn't use 2 separate skillets, because you miss the chance to deglaze all the good pork flavor left in the skillet.  I think my 18 month old would have eaten all the apples if I had let her!

I took the advice of one reviewer and marinated in apple juice and soy (2 to 1) but only for an hour, it's all the time I had.  I will marinate for longer next time.  I also used red apples and doubled the sauce and added a little apple juice to the sauce.  I was really expecting these to be too sweet, but I have to say they were delicious!  I'm saving this recipe and adding it to my regulars!

This recipe is a keeper!!  The whole family loved it!  I will double the sauce next time because there just wasn't enough of it.  You have to reduce the sauce, pour it over the chops and serve immediately, otherwise the sauce will thin out as it sits.  Very yummy!

This is my very first review....It was really good and quite simple.  I used a pork roast which I seared before putting it into the oven.  I had to increase the the sauce recipe by 4 just because I probably had close to 4# or roast.  As i kept the roast cooking in the oven I made the apple "sauce" poured it onto the top of my roast, cover a cooked till the internal temperature was 160 then I added the pecans and some walnuts because that is what I had.  Cooked an add'l 10 minutes or so and served it with mashed potatoes and corn.  YUMMY.  Thanks for the recipe and all the good reviews.

A bit too sweet for my taste but nevertheless delicious. I made the mistake to get pork steaks that were too thin (about a half centimeter) and the meat became a bit dry and without flavor.

Yeah, you could basically pour this sauce over lima beans and brussel sprouts and i would probably eat it.  Sooooo good.  Definitely double it.  I breaded the pork - yummy!  I also used bummel & brown (we never have real butter) and that worked just fine.  Some of the onions from my salad got mixed in and that really added a interesting twist.  Might think about adding them next time.

Made this last night, minus the pecans.  My kids loved the dish.  They told me to make pork chops like this every time.  My hubby saw the apples and said "tell me that isn't going with the pork chops?"  Despite that comment, he also enjoyed the dish.  It was very good and a very nice change.

This was a little too sweet for me and the pork was a bit bland.  It cooked up easily and everyone else liked it okay, but I found it to be unremarkable.

I think this recipe has great potential, but I would recommend reading the reviews before you make it. I would have just braised the pork chops for a few minutes and then made the sauce, poured everything over the pork chops and bake them as others recommended. As written, my pork chops ended up very dry and as everyone else has noted too, you really need more sauce. I'll try again though since I think they could be really good.

These were pretty good! I used canned apples and added the rest of the ingredients to them. The sauce was yummy. My family did NOT like the apples on the chops, so next time I will take them out and just pour the sauce on them. I highly recommend cooking the chops pretty done before placing in the oven. I browned them in a pan, then placed them in the baking dish while I made the sauce. I poured the sauce over the chop and baked it for about 30 minutes. It as easier to do it this way. Saved a lot of steps, and time. Will make again!

This was very good.  My whole family enjoyed these.  I thought the sauce was going to take longer than it did and so my chops dried out just a bit but were still very tasty.  I toasted my pecans and put them on the chops after the apples and before the sauce.  I also seasoned my chops before I cooked them.  Probably should have put a little more seasoning on them for more flavor.

I took the advice of a previous reviewer and marinated the chops all day.  The pork chops were greatly enjoyed by everyone.  My husband said, "good pork chops" and he hates pork chops.  I think I might try using apple pie filling for those days when I want a quick dinner solution.

The chops and the apples were good, but the sauce got weird on me. The problem was that the  sauce clumped up before the apples were soft. Next time I'll slice the apples thinner. I used 3/4" chops, which got a little dry, so I'll follow the suggestion of leaving the lid on while they are in the frying pan.  
I'll definitely try again, maybe adding some of the spices others recommended. 
Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was really good and not all that difficult. We skipped the pecans, and made extra sauce for drizzling over the top.  Next time I would salt the chops as they are frying, and probably not make extra sauce.  I didn't let the 2nd batch cook long enough and it became tough and chewy as soon as it cooled off. I will definitely make this again!

turned out great. I followed others advice and dry rubbed the meat with garlic salt and pepper. I think it made a huge difference. Make sure you leave the sauce in long enough to thicken, I should have left it in longer.

I was excited to try this, but was very unsatisfied.  I thought that the presentation looked amazing, but the taste was horrible.  There was none there.  Maybe if you seasoned the pork chops before frying them...but I don't know.  I will not try again.

They were fine, but all that exciting. I used all the suggestions, but as I have often found with main dishes on allrecipes.com it was a little too simple and lacked depth.  I wont make them again.

I fixed this tonight and it was pretty good. I did, however, double the sauce because I love sauces.  I added a cut up onion with the apples and that works well with this recipe. I will use this again.

I made this last night with leftover apples from a trip to the orchard. It was fantastic! I made some changes based on other reviewers suggestions (hence the only four stars). I only cooked the chops on top of the stove for just long enough to brown them, not all the way through and finished in the oven on 350 in a covered dish with the apple mixture on top. The chops were wonderfully tender and the smell was delicious! I will definitely make again!

I have been wanting to try this recipe for such a LONG time, but was somewhat disappointed when I did.  I used 1" thick "bone-in" chops (which I think were too thick - I should have used "boneless" chops) and a Granny Smith apple.  I halved the recipe (used 2 chops), but prepared enough sauce for 4 as called for 'cause I like plenty of sauce.  Here's where I had problems.  I had to brown my chops longer than directed in order to cook them through (which dried them out).  I ended up placing my chops in a small baking dish in a 175 degree oven to keep them warm (as directed) which further (REALLY) dried them out!  The sauce was gooey & "clumpy" when spooned over the chops (should it be like this?).  If I make this again (I REALLY want to...), I'll a) season the chops with garlic salt, pepper and sage (per other's suggestions), b) brown chops in apple juice, apple brandy or spiced rum (another suggestion) and c) bake chops with the apple mixture pored over all (skip the skillet).  I think I'll also use pumpkin pie spice or allspice in place of the cinnamon & nutmeg called for in the sauce.  These chops went well with mashed sweet potatoes and buttered green beans as recommended. Thanks for a nice Fall dish!

Very good. I cooked the apples, spices and butter for about 10 minutes on top of the stove in a pot. I placed the pork chops on top of the vegetable oil in a baking pan (w/o frying them first) and put the apple mixture overtop of the chops and baked them for about 35 minutes. Everyone enjoyed. Thanks for sharing!

Very good.  I changed a few things: tripled the sauce, chopped the apples rather than slicing them, and I cooked the pork chops in a seasoning that I bought from Ralphs.  It came with a cook bag, so I cooked the chops in the oven while the apples and sauce cooked.  The combined flavors of the seasoning and the apples tasted very nice together.  I served this with mashed potatos, biscuits (the biscuits tasted wonderful dipped in the caramel sauce) and green beans.  I will definitely make this again.

These were terrible! the chops were dry. and there was NO sauce. even after doubling it. Maybe it was the appls i used. but they seemed to soak up all the "sauce" and what was left in the pan was clumps of brown sugar and butter. seperated. the flavor was ok but I think I just expected a saucey gooey dish. and this was definately not it.  sorry for the 2 stars. wont try this again.

These should be renamed, to "Oooo Can I Have Some More Pork Chops"  I tend to cook for my batchlor neighbors, and they love this meal.  I usually make the carmel apple stuff in a skillet, and grill the meat.  Once the meat is done, I'll pour the sauce and goodies over the top!  Definately a family favorite!

Thanks for previous reviews.  I took many of the suggestions to also modify the recipe.  I cooked the porkchops in apple juice only, no oil or spices on the chops.  I spread a layer of apple sauce in the warming pan so they could also warm in apple sauce.  Once finished, I poured the remaining apple juice over the chops.  I made lots more sauce than the recipe called for (but I was making for 9).  I used a stick of margarine, a tsp of cinnamon, 4 heaping tbsp of brown sugar and salt and pepper to taste.  I thought I had nutmeg, but did not, so I had to do without.  I also used 6 small apples, 2 granny smith, 2 golden delicious, and 2 gala, and I diced them rather than slice them.  Mixed the apples with the sauce before simmering it, and then spooned sauce over chops.  Many compliments from everyone eating.  Served with seasoned green beans, mashed potatoes, rolls, and cherry cobler for dessert.  Will definately repeat recipe again, but will probably go for boneless pork loin the next time.

Ok, I changed my technique on the pork only to keep them from drying out like others complained of.  I seasoned them with garlic, salt, and pepper...then quickly browned them over high heat.  Then added a bit of chicken broth to the pan, covered and simmered while I prepared the rest of dinner.  I had moist, juicy chops to eat with these superb apples.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty bad.  The pork was dry and there wasn't enough sauce.  I don't think there's any way to improve this one.

This recipe turned out great! Note, if using Sucanut sugar in the mixture with the apples, keep the heat just below medium (elec. stove); otherwise it carmelizes.

Awesome!  I made this tonight and I couldn't keep my husband away.  I had to triple the sauce but other than that I didn't change a thing.  I will definitely be making this on a regular basis.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Heavenly!!! I fried my Pork chops after egging and dredging in flour cause just wasn't sure anyone would eat them if they looked diffrent. My daughter ate an entire pork chop without complaint. Ok that was new so this I would rate much higher than a 5 just for that alone. She kept dipping her meat into the sauce. This is a kid who doesn't dip in anything. Very yummy!!! Next time will use more apples. I doubled the sauce on others recommendations and glad I did. Will be using this again and Chicken Tenders would be most excellent with this!! My chops were a boneless sirloin chop. I also skipped the oven part I fried them in my electric skillet.

Great recipe for pork.  The sauce is delicious (I doubled it) and very easy to make.  I cooked the pork in one pan while making the sauce in another and didn't have to worry about pulling plates out of the oven every few minutes.  If you are using thicker chops, I would recommend baking them in the oven instead of frying as they take forever to cook all the way through in the pan.  Thanks for the recipe.

This stuff was great! Even my pickiest children ate it (and I've got 5 of them). The caramel sauce was awesome... at first the kids turned their noses up at it, but once I told them how good it was, they tried it and finished it off.

The chops were a little dry, and I would've doubled the sauce had I read first. Otherwise, quite tasty.

We changed the technique a little. Instead of cooking the pork chops in a skillet we grilled them and cooked the apple-carmel mixture separately then combined them at the end. They came out great! It is a very nice combonation of tastes. My kids loved it too.

This is a delicious recipe!  My VERY picky husband and son loved it!  I changed just a few things.  Because some people said the pork chops came out dry, I decided not to keep them warming up in the preheated oven - instead because its summer I did them on the grill at the same time I made the sauce.  That way they would both be done at the same time, plus the grill made them taste that much better!!  I seasoned the chops with only pepper when I put them on the grill.  I used regular butter (not the unsalted), I omitted the nutmeg (only because I didnt have any)  I used a regular MacIntosh apple and I tripled the sauce ingredents.  IT WAS DELISH!!!!   So happy I found this one!   My family gets tired of the same old things!!!  Thanks Karena!!

This turned out very nicely - the seasoned apples went really well with the pork.  I didn't have any pecans, but will probably try that next time.  This is a very nice alternative to the usual shnitzel I've been doing with pork cutlets.

the chops were too dry.  the only thing that made the recipe was the sauce, but then I might as well of had an apple crisp for dinner.

I made this meal last night, I was worried because I wanted to use the Fat Free Spray Butter (I just used the exact amounts asked for in the recipe) instead of "real" butter...it worked.  This meal was so yummy and with the FF butter it was a very low fat meal.  I tripled the caramel sauce and it was fantastic..next time I may even make more sauce. I also added sliced onion.  My husband and I really enjoyed this meal.

We did not care for this recipe. My kids liked it because it was sweet, but my husband and I ordered pizza. The chops were dry, the sauce wasn't enough, I did double it and it was better. The apples were good. I may try this again and tweak the recipe a bit because the base ingred. were okay but not impressive.

This was good, but didn't seem to produce enough of the caramel sauce.  The pork chops were very tender, in spite of the lack of sauce.  The overall taste was very nice, though, and my husband liked it.  Next time I'll make sure to double the sauce.

Finally a new way to make pork chops.  This recipe was easy and really good.  I didn't use all of the apple that the recipe called for because it seemed like too much, but I wish I had.  The apples condensed down quite a bit and were delicious.

These pork chops turned out great!  I left them in the oven to warm a little longer than I should have, so they were a little bit dry, but no one in my family seemed to mind!  A great recipe if you like sweet sauces on your meat and a fabulous fall recipe!

This was excellent.  Everyone in my family loved it.  I doubled the sugar & spices and used 3 tbls. butter to have more sauce.  It was quick, easy and I had every ingredient on hand.

I created a user name just to rate this recipe.  AMAZING meal...I printed it up and gave it to my wife as a suggestion for dinner one night.  She made it this past week, and we couldn't get enough of it!  The combination of flavors was PERFECT, especially for fall, and best of all, she said that it was really easy.  We do agree with the suggestions to make more sauce...she tripled the amount, which might have been a bit too much...but too much is better than too little.

Thanks for this new favorite recipe!  Will share with friends and family and will make many more times...

Wasnt sure if my husband would like it.Come to find out when he cooked for himself he ate alot of chops and applesauce.I just put them together,and he loved it.I used 6 Tablespoons of applesauce and doubled the sauce mix.I cooked the chops set them aside and in the same pan made the sauce and then simmered it all together for about 10 minutes or until my side dish was done.I found a new way to do pork chops.Thanks for sharing!!

This is one of those dishes that is easy, but makes others think you slaved. My husband loves it and so do I! You absolutely have to double the caramel part though.

My husband and I both liked it. I took the suggestions of others and marinated the chops in some olive oil, salt, pepper and a little white wine.  I sauted some onions and trippled the sauce.  I thought it was a wonderful sweet/savory flavor. I used the extra thick boneless chops so they took longer to cook.

I thought the chops were undercooked and lacked a full flavor - everyone else loved them!  Next time I'll try marinating them and letting them cook longer on the stovetop.  I'm excited about trying this again!

Made this last night for dinner.  I have two boys who want the same thing all the time.  Surprised them with this and the first thing they did was put their noses up. After I convinced them to try it they loved it and agreed to have it again.  I made it all in one pan on the stove.  First I browned the chops then added the rest and I did double up on the sauce.  Will do again without a doubt. A great recipe.

My husband really liked this recipe.  The only thing that should be changed is that more sauce is needed.  I would actually double the amount of butter and brown sugar next time.

This was a great meal.  My fmily and I love it.  My wife actually had me to make the sauce the next night without pork chops.  I do agree with others though, the sauce ends up being to short to go on all chops.  I added enough veg oil to cover the bottom of a large pan and made my sauce in there.  Add butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon when the apples soften and it really brings out a great flavor.  I recommend MacIntosh apples.

Very good and very easy.  I added some dried apricot and cranberry bits to the sauce.  The sauce could use more liquid, perhaps the apples I used were not juicy enough. I will definetly make this again.

Very good chops!! Based on the bland reviews, I sauted the chops with chopped onions and minced garlic and seasoned them with all-seasoning.  Also, I didn't bother with the oven steps, this recipe could be all done over the stove-top, with a little manuevering of the chops. My daughter loved this and told me she "wants this recipe when she grows up." :)  We all agree this should be made again! Thanks Karena.

MMMMMMM, this was very tasty, and I too doubled the sauce and used two pork chops, next time I will triple it though because I enjoyed the flavor so much. Nothing really needs to be changed though.

I loved the combination of pork, apples, spices and pecans.  I liked it a lot.  My family, however, did not.  I won't make it again for them, but I would make it for a fall dinner party

This was wonderful.  Sadly, I doubled the sauce recipe but then double the amount of pork chops too, so I didn't have as much sauce as I would have liked.  These were very easy...we had rice and garlic green beans.  I recommend this one highly...thanks !

Thank you so much for this wonderful dish. I made this for my mother on mother's day and the whole family devoured it!  It was a hit.  I left off the pecans; the apples and brown sugar gave the sliced pork loin so much flavor, we didn't miss the pecans. I will make this again.

Although I cooked my chops a little too long (I cooked them longer than the 5 or 6 minutes each side), the taste was wonderful. Even my husband, who is a good cook himself and therefore is ALWAYS offerring suggestions for improvements on my cooking, said that the sauce was delicious.  I caught him trying to spoon some up out of the pan.  Thanks (finally) for a meal that he liked!

My husband said, "This is great!" He gave it 2 thumbs up! I used applesauce instead of apples (didn't have any). And put the pecans into the sauce (just before serving) instead of just sprinkling them on top of the chops. Would suggest doubling the sauce though, wasn't enough. Also since we love garlic, so I rubbed the chops with minced garlic and pepper. And let them set in the frig for a few hours prior to cooking. I served this with creamy noodles and fresh green beans. Nice change from boring pork chops.

My daughter took one look at what I was making and, with a disgusted look, said; "You're not going to put the apples ON the pork chops, are you?  Those chops are huge!  I can't eat a whole one."  Not only did she end up putting the apple mixuture on the pork herself, but she polished off a whole chop!  I will definitely be making this again!  Oh, we doubled the apples and the sauce....probably could have used a little more.

Outstanding recipe!  I followed everyone's advice and made extra sauce.  My family devoured this dish and wanted more!  This is definitely a family favorite and I will have to make it at least once a week!  :)  I even made it for my father (who doesn't like pork chops) when I went to visit my parents and he cleaned his plate!  Now my mom has to make this dish for him often!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great taste.  I think apples and pork go very well together.  I think a few little modifications would make this perfect.  For example, I was there was more sauce.

Great recipe! The apples and cinnamon give the pork chops a great taste. The key is to slow cook the pork chops over medium heat.

My son didn't care for this, but my husband thought it was good. It really makes a nice 'splash' when you present a plate full of chops covered in apples and sauce. I did double the sauce, and still thought I could have made more. Would make it again

Very simple, good, and liked by my 10 year old picky eater who declared the apples "better than Cracker Barrel's"!  I'll make these again, next time doubling the amount of sauce.

This is a great dish to cook for just 2.  I used 2 pork chops, but kept the recipe the same.  Make sure you take the "sauce" immediately out of the skillet.  I think I cooked it a minute too long because it came of the skillet black and hard.  I didn't really think the extra sauce mattered anyway.  My husband loved this one!

Very tasty - no leftovers. 
Make sure you get the right thickness pork chops - I accidentally got them too thick and had to butterfly them to get them to finish cooking. It increased cooking time and then there wasn't enough sauce. I suggest taking the advice from all of the other reviews - double up on the sauce! It was yummy!

We enjoyed this recipe very much.  Next time I will substitute Apple Pie Spice, which has a little more complex flavors, for the spice in the recipe.  Also I will add a tablespoon of Apple Brandy to the sauce.

This was soooo good!  The apples and sauce are like having desert with the main dish!  Definately make more sauce.  I made this for my husband, kids, mother and mother-in-law and everyone loved it.  I used sirloin chops and they were moist and tender!

This taste reminded me of how my mom used to bake pork chops--with applesauce and cinnamon on top.  I must admit that the applesauce route is quicker, but this recipe here was also delicious.  I'm excited to eat the leftovers, when the great apple flavor has really sunk in!

This was awesome. The chops were tender. I do agree with doubling the sauce part of it. This was very light not heavy at all. It will be made again and again in this house.

This has become a weekly favorite - my husband hates pork but loves this recipe.  I grill butterflied chops for 6 min and it really makes a difference.  I use one stick of butter and 1 green apple (two portions), without the nutmeg.  Very tasty!

Definately double the sauce!!!  Don't bake them in the oven-evne letting them sit in their to keep warm for too long makes the chops hard.

My hubby said this one was a keeper! I'm somewhat embarrassed to say he licked the plate clean. The recipe was very quick to make and required minimal ingredients.  Next time, I will use thinner pork chops (mine were about 1") and would also add more sauce.  By the time I got the apples cooked, most of the sauce had already thickened, so there was no sauce left to stir to thicken.

I didn't make this using pork-- i used salmon-- it was DELISH!!!!  Spray foil with PAM, place on baking sheet with salmon skin down.  Make apple mixture and put on salmon.  Bake for approx. 25 minutes.  make more apple mixture or drizzle with more brown sugar/cinnamon/butter...  WAY YUMMY!!!!

Boy is this good !! DEFINITELY double the recipe for the sauce. I used 3 med. sized Fuji apples and this was just mouth-watering. One of the reviewers baked her chops and complained...DO NOT bake them; simply keep them warm in the over (200-250 degree oven.

Overall everything had a great flavor. My wife liked eating the apples separate from the pork chops. This is a keeper. Also since this dish was done before the rest of the meal I put everything in a oven proof dish and kept it heated in the oven until everything else was cooked.

Very tasty and easy, I peeled the apples, and doubles the sauce.  After cooking pork chops in pan, I put in 9x13 glass pan, and put sauce and apples over them and baked about 1/2 hour.  I would make this again!

I have made apple chops before, but this version is so tasty! I doubled the sauce and also used some chicken bone broth and apple cider vinegar to add some more substance to the sauce. It was like eating apple pie one a savory juicy chop.

This is an excellent recipe. It made the pork taste delicious. Next time I make it I will add some bourbon to give it a deeper adult taste but it is great as is.

Definitely yummy but we enjoyed the apples and caramel more than the pork chops. Will probably make again with rice and broccoli.

Very good made per recipe but next time will do as others
suggested, double the sauce (for2) add onion and garlic
Pour sauce over browned chops and bake 350 for 1/2 hour.

I thought this recipe was fantastic. Just enough sweetness and tang from the apples.  Easy to prépare. Easy to reheat as leftovers or to use for pork fried rice.  Really enjoyed it.

I used a 4lbs whole pork tenderloin, topped with Apple butter cooked in a crockpot until temperature reached 145 degrees, removed to let rest, I made the sauce while doing so, added the Apple Butter sauce from the crockpot, omitted the nutmeg.

I have to agree with others that there is not enough sauce.  If I make this again, I will triple the sauce and bake them in the oven as some other folks did.  The apples were great, but there was just not enough sauce, which left it dry.  I think I would also use cider or apple juice in the sauce mix next time.

By the time I removed the chops with the slotted spoon, there wasn't any sauce to thicken or spoon over the chops. Still tasty.

So yummy. I baked the pork chops at 350  for 30-45 minutes covered till done rather than frying  them. Did everything else the same.  Will definitely make again!

This dish is so delicious satisfying.  The only change I made was to use 1 Tbl of  clarified butter and 1 Tbl of Splenda Brown sugar.

I did just like it said and it came out great and easy to make. I didn’t have any pecans this time but I’ll be sure to pick up some the next time I make it which will be soon.

We loved this recipe really delicious.  I did cook the pork chops a little longer, 5 minutes per side and set oven at 225 degrees to keep them warm.  Easy great fall dinner.

This recipe went over well at my house. The only change I made was I didn't add any salt. Next time I will add a third Apple and bake it. I picked this recipe because I am in a low sodium diet and I honestly didn't miss the salt on this one.

Glaze was nothing to work with, it evaporated right away.  Otherwise, it wasn't bad.  My son liked it and thought it reminded him of apple crisp.

Will definately make again. I don't know what I did wrong, everything was looking great and the sauce was getting thicker. I added the boneless pork chops to the apples and sauce and the sauce became more of a juice. I will try keeping the separate until I serve them next time. It's a keeper!

I did not make this recipe, I thought I was saving a pork chop recipe that had onion, apples, and BBQ Sauce.  I looked extensively for this recipe and could not find it.  I can never seem to find the same thing twice.  I did make the pork chops I intended to but I was just guessing at the ingrediants.  However it was delicious. And a big hit with those in the family that like pork.  Not all of the recipes appear to allow saving and it is very frustrating to not be able to go back and find what you are looking for.

I made this for dinner for my boyfriend and I, he loved it! His exact words were, "We are having this for dinner every night for forever." Lol, I thought the meal was pretty good, I served with green beans and roasted potatoes. I liked that it was a seasonal meal, but I think next time I make it the meat will be a little more seasoned. I will be making this again! Cheap, simple, and tasty.

Love this.  Have made it several times.  The only miss was when I made it with frozen pork chops, defrosted in the microwave.  They were cut thick and took a long time to cook through so became dry.

Had to double the sauce recipe and pork chops need to be season a day or two ahead of time.

Great recipe. Everyone loved it. I put the chops on the BBQ for a sear on each side and then in a casserole dish covered in tinfoil in the oven for about 45 min. I did as others suggested and tripled the sauce as well. Easy dish to make and tasty!

So easy and DELISH. I had 2"+ think pork chops and cooked them in a bit of oil with seasoning until they were about 3/4 done and transferred to a pan and topped them with the cooked apples/cinnamon/sugar mixture and put them in the oven covered for 350 for 30 minutes. Next time I will try it apple juice and soy marinade that someone mentioned. Just didn't have time to marinate this time.

This first time I tried it, I made it according to the recipe here. It was delicious!  My chops were thick and I wish I'd thought to butterfly them first as they took a while to cook thoroughly in the pan. Next time (& there will be a next time!) I will try either baking or using 2 pans as some others have done. I will definitely also make more sauce as my husband and I were both wiping up every drop of it!

Quick and easy, love that!  I just put  the chops on a plate and covered them with foil while I cooked the apples and sauce. Wasn't necessary to heat the oven. The flavors were good in this. Thanks for sharing.

Like other reviewers, I warmed double the amount of sauce with chopped apples (and BTW, I found one apple would have been enough for 3 chops) and then poured on top of chops in a casserole dish. I baked for about 20 minutes at 375. However, I needed to dish out the chops and apples and thicken the sauce  with about a tablespoon (probably could have been less) of cornstarch. Nice tender chops with a very sweet topping that looked very impressive on the plate.

Followed the recipe and the dish was delicious.  I served the pork chops with pumpkin ravioli and used the same sauce from the chops.  The sauce and the pecans were a perfect match for the pumpkin ravioli.

My pork chops were thicker.  Would do thinner ones next time, as they were  a little tough, but that's what I had.  The apples and sauce were wonderful.  My husband said that's definitely a keeper.

My family loved this dish, and so did I, which says a lot because pork chops are not my favorites!  I always feel it important to rate recipes exactly as written, but I will admit that I changed it a bit because I was making portions for a couple from church, both of whom eat sodium-free.   I left out the salt.  I pierced the chops and soaked them in apple juice over night as other reviewers suggested to try to get some extra flavor into them to make up for no salt.  I grilled them instead of baking.  The combo of soaking and grilling made them the juiciest chops I ever made!  The apple and brown sugar glaze/sauce was delicious!!!  It's definitely a keeper -- I tripled it so that we had more than enough of both the apples and sauce.  My family usually likes to have applesauce with pork chops... this was definitely an UPGRADE and will be my goto recipe for pork chops in the future!

These porkchops were delicious! I followed the recipe exact except I tripled the sauce, but not the apples. I also chopped up an onion and cooked until tender in butter. I added the other sauce ingredients once the onion was tender. After the apples were almost tender, I poured the sauce mixture over the porkchops  and baked the in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes. I added the pecans on top of the porkchops during the last 5 minutes of cooking. The sauce mixture was thin while cooking in the pan, but the sauce carmilized while baking in the oven and was perfect! Next time I may add a little apple cidar to the sauce. My fiancé and I loved this! Even though I didn't marinate the porkchops, they were very tender. Will make again!

I will definitely make it again.  I did make a number of changes based on other reviews.  I seasoned the chops with garlic and onion powder and crushed rosemary.  I marinated them in 2 parts apple juice to 1 part soy sauce.  When I was making the pan sauce I thought it needed more liquid so I added apple juice and reduced it.  I loved it and a very finicky husband pronounced it "delicious."  Dropped a star because there were so many changes that I will re-write the recipe for my files.

This is a very good recipe! I just have to made a lot more sauce.  Also suggest adding pecans at the end and uncover and broil for 2-4 min until pecans roast.

I find pork unappealing and my husband loves pork chops, so I was searching for a recipe that I would make and I would attempt to eat.   I really liked this recipe and it will go into the monthly rotation, I did make a few alterations.  1)  Tripled the sauce & left the skin on the apples.  2)  I didn't put the pork in the oven to keep warm  because I didn't want the meat to dry out.   3) I added the pecans right away so they were caramelized as well.  4) After the ingredients for the sauce were combined and cooked for a minute, I added the pork back into the pan so the sauce would 'stick' to the pork.  It was delicious!

I actually combined this with LadyJayPees suggestions.  I seared the chops for about 4-5 minutes per side and placed in a baking dish.  In a separate skillet I sauteed 1/2 yellow onion in butter.  I tripled the brown sugar, nutmeg and cinammon.  Added those with more butter and the apples, very thinly sliced.  Simmered the apples until tender, maybe 10 minutes and poured over the chops.  Covered with foil and baked for 40 minutes at 350 degrees.  Removed foil and baked for an additional 10 minutes.  Then served with galic and bacon green beans and mashed potatoes. It was a hit with the fiance.  I may try sprinkling the nuts another time.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. It is the perfect amount of sweet for pork chops. It was mildly sweet, but not desert-like so it didn't overpower the pork. I did have to cook my pork chops for about 15 minutes vs. the 5 listed in the recipe in order to bring them up to a safe temp for pork. Will definitely serve this again.

Excellent!  We loved it.  We made extra apples and mixed them in a fried rice to serve on the side.  Delicious!

I need to cook the pork chops less, but it was still tasty. Not as much sauce as I envisioned either.  I'll make it a little better next time.

I was really skeptical about this recipe but it was absolutely delicious. a mix of salty, sweet, and tart. And definitely adding the pecans is a must every time I am going to make this now.

Is it just me? or, don't 3/4 thick pork chops take more time than 5 or 6 minutes to be fully cooked?  I literally read word for word and expect the recipe is going to carry me and cover all bases.  I got hung up on the fact that all cook time ended.  I panicked and improvised.  Am I missing something?  It doesn't appear that anyone else had this experience.
Regardless of all that?  My 90 year old parents LOVED them and want me to cook them again.  So I guess I will modify the recipe by getting thinner chops or something.  Cooking can be stressful when under the gun.  Thanks!

My family loved it. Had great flavor to it and was enjoyed by all. The only thing I would do differently is triple the sauce as there was not enough to go around.

This recipe was delicious!!!  We had just gone apple picking, so I used Granny Smith apples.  I fixed two large chops so followed the recipe as it was written . It was beautiful on the plate and I will definitely make it again....not only for us , but also for guests.

I love apples and pork together, and this recipe was awesome! I added sliced onions with the apples to cook down. I didn't really have any broth to cook down, maybe my apples weren't juicy enough, but I didn't miss it. I just spooned the apple/onion mixture over the pork chop and it was delicious!

It was a nice change of pace from savory dishes.  I used a George Foreman grill and made the sauce as the chops cooked. Following others recommendations, I doubled the caramel apple sauce and served with baked sweet potatoes.

Definitely worth adding to favorites this was a huge hit with my family. After reading reviews I made small changes, I added onions just before I added the spice mixture and apples. Also after reading everyone saying there is not enough sauce I doubled on the mixture and butter and still didn't have enough for a sauce, so I tossed the pork chops back into the pan once I removed the apples and poured the apples back onto them and left them on medium for another 5mins. Came out perfect, certainly making this one again

I don't know why all the controversy regarding bake, broil, or cook in the pan.  I followed the directions exactly.  The only change I would make is to double the sauce.  I use a Calphalon 12 inch Everyday pan, and liked brushing the chops with olive oil. (I had never done that before).They browned up nicely and rested in the oven  till the apples and sauce were completed. My wife and I loved it and will have it again.

Awesome! Everyone loved this! I made the apple mixture first on the stove and tripled it for the 4 pork chops which I found perfect. I then put the pork chops on the bottom of the 9x13 and poured the apple mixture on top and baked it 350 for about 20 mins (they were thin chops). Served with mashed potatoes on the side.

Made it for the first time using another reviewers suggestion to use apple pie filling.  Also seasoned the chops lightly with garlic salt and pepper.  The finished product was a hit with the entire house, very rare when I try a new receipe.

We loved it!! I followed another reviewers advice. I baked the raw pork chops at 350 with the sauce (after cooking the sauce on the stovetop) for an hour. I had doubled the sauce. Next time, I will triple it! I also added an onion to the sauce.

My husband just love the taste of the pork chops. I made a
Little extra gravy, but didn't add more apples or nuts.
I like this recipe  because it's a new spin on pork chops.

I had thicker chops, so they needed a bit of extra cooking. Otherwise took the advice of others to double the caramel sauce. Fantastic dish! Will make again.

This recipe was so good and easy,I did use pork tenderloin cut into diagonal pieces abt 1 1/2 in wide, and it was perfect! So tender and flavorful, this is an absolute perfect recipe for  company. It will certainly be my go to recipe for guests.

I thought this really turned out great. It was very tasty right after cooking. I re-heated some for lunch the following day and while it was still good, it wasn't great like the night before.

It was just "okay".  The apples were really good, but not so sure about serving it on pork.  I am going to try it again, but this time on chicken breasts.  I'll write another review after I make it.

This was to sweet for me. I prefer the pork and apple dish with sauerkraut and caraway seed. It's was floods though. Just a matter of personal preference I think.

Very easy to make, and very tasty.
I seared the pork loin chops for 2 minutes each side and baked them for 30 minutes which was much less than indicated in the recipe.

I changed up just a little on the order of things.  I had 1 1/2 inch pork loin chops that I broiled in the oven while I cooked the apples.  I cooked the apples in 3 tbsp butter, 1/4 water, 3 tbsp brown sugar and 1/2 tsp nutmeg and sauteed till almost soft.    Served the apples over the pork chops  and they were delicious!

I did not like this at all.  The pork chops were so bland I could hardly choke them down.  The apple part was good but it seemed to clash with the blandness of the pork chops.  I should have read the reviews first and tried marinating them.  And you also need to double or triple the sauce.  Such a disappointment because it sure sounded good!

I burnt the sauce. Masked it by sprinkling more brown sugar on the chops  & sauce. Will think of serving with corn, squash, sweet potatoes, green beans, or mash, next time.

Very similar to what I make, that is why I'm giving this recipe 4 stars.

This is how I do my 'apple pork chop' dinner.  I brown the chops first in the skillet then lay them in a casserole. I melt butter in the skillet and saute some sliced yellow onion until translucent. Instead of just cinnamon, I add apple pie or pumpkin pie spice mixture along with sliced apples.  Once the mixture has thickened I cover the chops with it. Then I spoon some shredded cheddar cheese on top of the apple mix.  I then add 1/2 box of prepared stuffing mix (like stove top) to the very top. Bake uncovered in a 375 oven for 30 minutes.

After reading this recipe though, I think I will add some pecan pieces mixed in with the stuffing mix.

Alright, so I have made this multiple times and loved it. I now make most of my pork chops the way this recipie says to. The only time I have not liked something about this was the last time I made it, I accidentally burnt the sauce, but I was being stupid and suddenly tried to increase the sauce at the very end.

This recipe has been sitting my my recipe box for some time now and I regret not making this sooner! This recipe did not last long ad for the first time I was not the first one done eating! Thanks for sharing this recipe. I did add sweet onions to this in place of part of the apple, it was needing to be used and worked out perfectly.

I would have to give this recipe 4 1/2 stars. My whole family really liked the taste, but I think it needs some tweaking to really be a 5 star dish.
The biggest problem: the sauce is just too thin. I followed the advice of other reviewers and made extra sauce, but it didn't do much because it was so thin. 
Tips: I used Granny Smith apples, and those worked well. Once the pork chops were cooked through, I poured the sauce over them and covered it to make the meat more tender. And if you are able to make the sauce thicker, (cornstarch?) I would make more than the recipe calls for.
Overall, it really was a good recipe, but just wasn't quite up to 5 star standard. Perhaps my hopes were just raised too high by all the raving reviews. I do recommend this dish though, and will be making it again.

I'm not a fan of pork chops really but this stuff is amazing! I actually can eat 2 pork chops instead of  1 as usual. If you like cinnamon and a thin caramel taste then you'll love this recipe also.

Absolutely delicious, but I did feel I had to make some changes. The apples would have been dry if I hadn't added triple the amount of brown sugar, butter, and spices, and I also added some cornstarch to thicken. With those changes, the pork chops and apples are delicious, definitely one of the top porch chop recipes I've tried.

We enjoyed this recipe very much.  I did rub seasoned salt on both side of the chops before frying and will do so again.  I might try it in a slow cooker after browning to see if the chops will have a more tender texture.  Great  flavor!  I will absolutely make this again.

Followed the recipe and frying the pork made it tough, and it didn't have much flavor.  Tough and bland isn't a good combo for meat, and adding overpoweringly sweet & cinnamon flavored apples didn't help.  The apples seem suited for desert, not a main dish.  I think baking the pork with the apples & sauce would help as it would allow the flavors to combine, rather than have two  separate flavors with nothing in common.  The recipe as-is sounds good but in reality it isn't, in my opinion anyway...

I added a splash of chicken stock to help apples simmer down and double the sauce recipie. I also fried the chops with tamari for the salty flavour. I did the entire dish in one pot, except keeping the chops on a plate in oven to keep them warm. Outstanding recipie.

1) Very tasty.  I cooked the sauce then poured the sauce over the pork chops in a 9x13 pan and baked it all at 350 degrees for about 45 min.

2)  Made as directed but added some carrot coins to the apple mixture as I saw one of the other reviewers do.  Great way to slide in those vegetables.

Delicious! I didn't change a thing, besides the pork chop cooking time. Mine needed a little more than 6 minutes to cook. Don't forget to scrape the pan as your melting the butter. Great recipe, will definitely be making again very soon!

We loved it! With the name caramel in it I worried it would be too sweet but it was lovely. Adding extra pepper helped balance the sweetness and I think it was good we choose Braeburn apples which are not too sweet.

Very good recipe.  Definitely will double sauce next time.  Also, will thicken sauce more with 2 teasp. cornstarch and 2 teasp. cold water mixed together.   All in all, a great recipe.

Definitely a keeper!  I eliminated the oil and used a cast iron pan to sear on high heat with some Benson's salt free Supreme seasoning. I did not add any salt at all to this recipe. The rest I followed precisely and it was perfect. Thanks for this recipe. It's going in the low-sodium arsenal that the entire family enjoyed immensely.  :) p.s. I forgot to throw on the pecans and it was still fabulous!

I made these pork chops in the crock pot! I browned the pork chops in butter in a skillet, then added them to the bottom of the crock pot. I topped them with the apples, brown sugar, spices, and dollops of butter. I cooked them for about 4-5 hours on high and they were falling off the bone delicious!!! Served the sauce over buttered noodles. Yum!

Yummy!  There definitely wasn't enough sauce after adding the apples, so I added more butter.  You're not cooking them in the oven, you're cooking them on the stovetop but keeping them warm in a very low oven until the sauce is done.  I suppose you can bake them but then you lose the flavor of what would be left in the pan when you mix up the apples and brown sugar.  I don't believe it's any healthier baking them because all you need is a very little bit of oil in the fry pan.  Just use olive oil.  I would definitely make this again.

I didn't think the sauce for the apples was sweet enough and it did not taste like caramel, so next time i will just serve with sweetened apple sauce or buy a package of Stouffers  apples.

New to gluten free cooking, hard changes after cooking for so long.  I cook for the family and was very surprised at the response when we had dinner last night.  They all loved it.  I made it with yams and green beans and it was gone. We  used the apples from our tree and it was the icing on the cake.

These porkchops are outstanding. However, if you're handy on the grill,  they can be grilled over medium direct heat for about 9 minutes per side, and to really take it up another level, you can use apple wood chips and smoke them while you are grilling them. When they're done, drizzle them with the sauce and either serve the apples as an accompaniment or on top of the chops. Either way, they are delicious.

I've made this recipe many times.  Delicious as is, but I have modified slightly over the years:  my kids don't like nutmeg, so we just use twice as much cinnamon.  I add a sliced onion in with the apples and sautee them together.   YUM!  Actually without the onions I would probably only give it a 4.   I also chop up the pork chops into bite size pieces before cooking - a practice I started because of young kids, but it also serves to coat more surface area with the delicious sauce.  Love it with the optional pecans.

Good recipe. Very simple to make. I followed the recipe exactly, but I doubled the sauce because it didn't seem like enough. I put the salt and pepper right on the pork chops instead of in the sauce.

Great recipe. 
I  seasoned the pork with Black Pep and Salt and seared it for several mins on both sides than finished it in the oven 450F for about 20 mins.  Came out crispy with the apples and used the remaining juices for the sauce.

I followed Terri Walton's recipe sort of. I added honey to the marinade. I didn't use the oven either. I did all in the skillet.
My boyfriend loved it.

This was really easy and tasty.  I am an experienced cook but I made this with my children so I could see where a cook time estimate would have been good for the apples and the sauce. I will make this again but I will definitely add a thickener to the sauce.  I also followed the suggestions of other reviewers and double the amount of the sauce. I will make this again

Good base recipe. Great for building it into something uniquely your own. I cook the chops in olive oil and butter and salt and pepper them to give them more flavor. Then, I put a can of apple pie filling in the pan of drippings and add Worchester sauce and a little caramel sauce. I put that on top of the chops in a dish and bake it in the oven for about 30 minutes at about 350.

I tweaked the recipe just a bit. I made the apples and the sauce first in the frying pan. I took the applesauce and set it aside in a bowl and fried my pork chops in the same pan I used to make my sauce. Instead of frying it in oil I used butter. Once my pork chops were golden brown I sliced them and put them back in my pan along with the apples and sauce that I had made. I let them finish cooking in the apples and sauce. It turned out delicious.

Very delicious.  Followed some suggestions by tripling the sauce ingredients and baking at 350 for 30 minutes, after browning.  Next time I will add a T of cornstarch to the sauce as it was very thin.

This was great! I drizzled some olive oil and sprinkled some sea salt and ground pepper on both sides of the chops then broiled them for 5 mins on each side. Just dumped all the apple stuff into a sauce pan and simmered covered until syrupy. Served with potato pancakes. A hit!

This was amazing. I didn't use pecans just because I didn't have any. I just cooked two chops but still tripled the sauce based upon other reviews and baked in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes. Served with roasted sweet potatoes and sautéed green beans. Hubby raved.

Certainly not bad!  Nice crunchy exterior and juicy interior.  I seasoned the chops with salt and pepper before putting them in the pan, and I'm certainly glad I did.  It gave the pork chops a nice salty-sweet flavor that I don't think could have been obtained from just the salt in the sauce.  Which reminds me--there wasn't nearly enough sauce.  Next time, I'd probably use the Sauteed Apples recipe from this site, because it has much more sauce with it.

No caramel. Way more butter needed or a much smaller pan. Yields about a tablespoon of sauce with four chops. I used 4 tablespoons butter. Came out great. I kight alsobuse 1 apple for the 4 chops if you've got a smaller cut. Mine came in anpackage of 7 chops. This recipe taste great. I am going to try more butter next time for more sauce, and also prep the ingredients before starting the chops so they don't dry out in the oven. I didn't need to cook the sauce at all so keeping the apples warm was not needed.

This recipe is a PERFECT base to add your own spin to. Personally, I made a gravy out of the pan drippings by deglazing with some unfiltered, no-added-sugar apple juice, and white wine. Also used some of the butter for a roux to thicken it up. Granny Smith apples work nicely for this preparation, and a bit of lemon juice or vinegar helps round out the gravy. You may also want to cut down on the sugar a bit at fist; and add more later if you think the sauce isn't sweet enough. 

Finally, a 1/4 tsp of sambal or chili paste brings it home.

First time trying this recipe. Everyone loved it! Complemented by all and even the picky eater out of the group finished all of it! Next time I'm going to add dried cranberries, can't wait! Counting down the days!

My family and I really loved this recipe! We especially loved the baked and spiced apples. The pork chops were very good, but next time I will buy thinner pork chops. But this was a wonderful recipe and was very good with cooked green beans and rice. Will definitely make again!!

This (base) recipe is amazing!!!! Although, I have to be honest, we used JUST the sauce/apple part of the recipe. Instead of pork chops we made this with a spiral ham and baked it in the oven for a few hours! Wonderful! We did triple the sauce recipe, but I think that was in part because we used a small ham instead.

Delicious!!!!This was one of the best dishes I have ever made according to my family.  I listened to the reviews that said to make MUCH more sauce.  I made 10 times the recommendation on the sauce and every drop was gone. I also added chopped sauteed garlic and onions caramelized with the apples and marinated the pork chops over night in 2 parts apple cider to 1 part soy. Boy ohhhh boy was this good! Just thinking about it makes my mouth water :)

I just made this recipe and I absolutely loved it. I doubled the brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg, but kept the apples the same. I think next time I will try adding some Cayenne pepper because I like the spicy sweet combination. Oh, and I didn't have any pecans but next time I will definitely add them.

Really liked it. KIds not so much, they could pick out the spices, ha who knew! I did use pork chops that were on sale which were bone in which I usually prefer however I would probably stick with the thick boneless chops next time.  Very much a fall time food. Thanks Allrecipe for sending this to my email inbox as a suggestion!

This is SO SO good! I buy the medium cut pork chops from Whole Foods and double the sauce (but not the apples) and my whole family LOVES it! I am still learning how to cook, so I didn't doctor the ingredients in any way (aside from the extra sauce) and I follow the other instructions exactly.  My husband really loves it, although he doesn't like me to put too many of the apples on his because he feels they are too sweet. The kids (7, 3, & 13 months) all eat gobble it down with no complaints (that is a triumph in my house!)

I made this at work one night and when my boss walked by, she asked if I was also making apple pie. Told her no it was for the pork chops, knowing full well how she feels about fruit/meat combo...which is not positively. Took her plate to her and then ran to the other room. About a minute later, she came out raving about how good it was. And that's a testament right there!
I work in a bar/restaurant and this is probably going on the menu for autumn.
As per other reviews, I doubled the sauce and I marinated the chops in apple cider for 1/2 hour.

The recipe worked out wonderfully just as it was written. We decided to sprinkle some blue cheese on top for an extra pop - delicious! Doubling the sauce would probably have been even better though.

The apples were delicious, but the pork was bland. I did end up adding twice as much of the brown sugar and cinn, while keeping the apples the same. There wasn't nearly enough from the original to coat even two tiny apples.

Wonderful! I have always enjoyed apple pork chops and this is a winning recipe. I made this exactly as directed in the recipe, however, I added about 1/2 cup of chicken stock to the apple/brown sugar mixture once in the skillet. This made for a more substantial sauce. I let the chicken stock reduce for about 5 minutes and had a wonderful, flavorful sauce.

I decided to brine the pork chops before using this recipe. My brine was 1 c cider vinegar, 1/4 c salt, 2/3 c brown sugar, 2 t mustard powder and 2 c water. I let them sit in brine for about 2 hours, then rinsed super well, dried them and proceeded with this recipe.  I followed the suggestion to carmalize some onion and add double the ingredients for the sauce.  Meanwhile, I browned the pork chops in another pan, then poured the sauce on top of the chops.  Covered, baked at 350 for 40 minutes, then removed cover and baked another 15.  
My family really enjoyed these chops - they came out very tender and tasty!

This was awesome!! I caramelized an onion, then made the sauce in the same dutch oven and simmered for 30-40 minutes. (Made extra sauce and used pumpkin pie spice.) I generously seasoned the chops with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Covered the chops with the sauce and baked at 350 for 30 minutes or so until they were 155 on my instant read thermometer. The onion really made this dish. It really was amazing. Company worthy. I served with wild rice with almonds and fresh mushrooms and steamed broccoli. Who gets such a lovely dinner on a Thursday night?!

Terrific, easy, & delicious! My redneck family thought I was crazy putting apples on top of a good pork chop but this recipe proved them wrong. They loved them! I had to double the recipe for the amount of folks I was cooking for. I used fresh, granny smith apples. Great contrast with the sweet, caramel brown sugar. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Loved this recipe! :0) The only thing I did different was add applesauce and a splash of soy sauce in the pan on the stove top to help keep the meat moist before placing it in the oven. I also doubled the topping recipe to make more sauce. :0) My whole family adored this recipe!

Was awesome!! If you're going to bake it, you definitely have to triple the sauce and pour over chops once or twice. Bake at 350 for about 25-30 (chops were about 1/2-3/4 in thick) and was perfect!! thanks for the recipe, definitely a keeper!

I was a bit worried upon reading the recipe.  Only made 1x sauce.  Big Mistake.  My son and I were fighting over the last bits of sauce and apples.  Resorting to cutting the apples in half.   I saute`d 1/2 red pepper and 1/2 sweet diced onion.  As the onion began to caramelize I added butter till bubbling and then the dry spice mixture stirring the dry mixture into the butter.  I added the apples about a minute later.   All this on a med to med low heat  I grilled the chops.  We were both hesitant to try, but soon the food was being consumed at an alarming rate.  MORE SAUCE :( !!!  Oh well, next time we know about the sauce and I think I will try the oven method.

So so so good! I added a couple extra apples and brined my chops first. Just enough sweet and the carmeled apples were perfect.

We enjoyed the recipe. I jazzed up the sauce a bit, crushed a clove of garlic in it, added some turmeric, ginger, cumin powder and cayenne pepper to make it a bit HOT, then added a bit of creme fraiche. I did not regret experimenting :)

I took reviewers advice, tripling the sauce and baking in the oven.  I ended up with pork chops that looked blanched in their own sauce.  If I tried it again, I would either try the pan route per the original recipe, or searing the chops first.

This was easy and very good. I did serve it w/ mashed potatoes and green beans as suggested; it made a nice meal. I like that it can easily be kept warm until it's time to put it on the table. The only reason I didn't go 5 stars is that I try to reserve those ratings for dishes that really wow me. This was great though, and I will do it again.

Im not really a fan of pork chops, but I had a package of them in the freezer so I decided to give this recipe a try, and I'm so glad I did!! They turned out so tender and yummy I will definitely be making these again pretty soon!! I followed the other reviewers suggestions and doubled the sauce for 4 chops, and put the apples AND sauce on top of the chops, cooked them in the over at 350 for 40 mins covered, then for the last 6 mins I took off the foil to let them brown a bit.  Im glad I didn't add the sauce after they were cooked cuz I think it would've been way too sweet for my taste. But definitely pour the drippings in the pan in top of the chops before serving, its a must have!! Thank you for this excellent recipe!!

For  medical reasons I have to follow a vegan diet, but I cook for a large crew every weekend for Sunday day when my kids and their spouses come over for Sunday dinner.  My son said, "Mom, I think this is the best meal you've ever made!"  Lots of raves.  I added a little more of the sauce ingredients, and dredged the chops in seasoned flour before frying, and then put it in the over for at least a half hour.  I'm saving this one!

The whole family loved this, will definitely do again. Followed recipe, except baked in oven at 375 for 45 minutes. Doubled amount of apples and tripled the sauce, which was just about right for large chops.  Didn't have pecans, but will get for next time.

My kids loved this twist on pork chops and apple sauce! I stuck some whole cloves in the pork chops while they were cooking to give them some extra flavor. I also used cinnamon, salt and brown sugar as a seasoning before I baked them in a slow oven. I let them bake with some apple sauce and a little water in the bottom of the dish so that they turned out nice and tender!

This was a big hit at our house and we're not usually pork chop people.  My kids and husband gobbled it up and requested I make it again.  That's a bonus around our house.  I made it exactly to the recipe and it turned out great!

Ehhh.  Just alright.  I should have read the reviews first and doubled the sauce.  It was just baked apples on pork chops.  I did sear then bake the chops.  I used 5 thin chops, and I should have used 3 apples and doubled the sauce.  It was a nice take on a classic combo, but I'll keep looking for the perfect apple and pork recipe.

These were so good.  I tripled the sauce as suggested by others, and added a bit of soy sauce, some apple juice and 4 ounces of apple sauce to it as well.  Choose to bake in the oven - it came out delicious!!!!

These were very good - even my daughter (who doesn't like pork chops) ate it without being told to!  I would follow the advice of others and double the ingredients for and thicken the sauce with cornstarch before baking - mine came out too thin.

One of my absolute favorite meals in autumn.  I follow the advice of another reviewer and marinade the chops in a mixture of apple cider and soy.  Then I pour some of the glaze and apples over the chops, bake in the oven at 350 until done, and then pour the reserved glaze and apples over them before serving.  Perfection!

WOW! This recipe was really easy and delicious! I took the advice from one of the reviews and sauteed an onion and butter. I then doubled the ingredients for the sauce and placed in the pan. I seasoned the pork chops with salt, pepper and garlic salt. (The chops were actually sitting in my fridge with the seasoning for at least an hour prior to cooking) I placed the sauce on top of the raw chops and placed them in the oven for about 1 hour. IT WAS DELICIOUS! My picky fiancee even said it was by far the best dish i have prepared for him! I served it with mashed potatoes. definately a keeper!

Amazing! My bf mmmmm'd and ahhhhh'd throughout the whole meal.   Great for cold weather..  I'd recommend adding a bit more brown sugar because the sauce will be minimal without it- I did about 3 tbsp instead of 2. Also, lightly salt and pepper the chops before cooking them, that way you won't need to add too much to the sauce.

Delicious! Here's what I did...I browned the pork chops in a frying pan while I cooked 1/4 c. maple syrup (instead of the brown sugar), salt, pepper, 1/4 plus 1/8 tsp. cinnamon,  1/4 plus 1/8 tsp. nutmeg & 2 Tbsp. butter together with the apples, added a little cornstarch to thicken, poured that over the chops with about a 1/4 c. homemade chicken stock, covered the pan and simmered on low for about 45 min. They were very flavorful and falling apart tender! I skipped the pecans.

I thought these were very good....if you like very sweet pork chops. My husband said it was like an apple pie with pork in it.  So if you don't like apple pie with your pork than these aren't for you.

Husband loved them, son loved the apples.  I doubled the butter, brown sugar, spices.  I didn't use thick chops as I had thin ones already thawed.  Still very good!

Great simple meal.  I did marinade the pork chops in apple cider vinegar and soy sauce for 20 minutes before cooking and I think that added a nice flavor.  We all enjoyed it!  A keeper for sure.

Very nice! Just made it yesterday!! I followed others advise to soak in an apple juice and soya sauce mix, and added 2 teaspoon chopped ginger (I'm a ginger fan!) to add a bit of spice! I used Green Apple instead, to let the slight sour freshen up the dish. Also added onion and celery to cook with the pork together, turns out perfectly! Don't forget to DOUBLE the sauce!!!! Yummy!!

I made this recipe for my family and they loved it! I made more sauce like other suggested, which was needed. Also, I recommend using the pecans. Without the pecans it was a little too sweet, the nuts put it all together. Excellent recipe, which Ill be making for thanksgiving!

These were pretty good and quite simple to make.  I was a little concerned that the chops would be dried out, but that wasn't the case.  I would have like a little more apple flavor in the meat rather than just on top -- which may be why other reviewers have suggested baking.  Overall, good choice for a fall evening!

I rate this recipe between 4.5 - 5 stars.  Overall, however, it was awesome.  I took two pork loins and sliced them lengthwise and then in half.  This gave me 8 nice, flat, pieces of pork to pan fry.  I would, however, recommend putting oil in the pan itself, especially if you're using a stainless pan as I did.  I had a little bit of an initial sticking problem with the pork when I simply brushed the oil on.  My pan was very hot, so I don't think this should have happened.  For the second batch, I put a bit of oil in the pan and it worked like a charm.  Kudos to the submitter, who recommended placing the tray in the over an 175 degrees.  This kept everything warm until my apples were done.  I'm going to have to try this "trick" more often.  My husband and daughter loved this one!

This was good, but not saucy enough.  I took a star away for that and also because it didn't go over well with my six year old fussy eater.

This is my first review and I had to give this recipe a rating because it was awesome!! I tripled the sauce... used salted butter, marinated pork chops all day in soy/apple sauce as recommended and browned them before then baking for 30 minutes at 350. They were not dry as I feared they might be. My husband loved this and he has never really loved anything that I have actually put work into :) Thank you for this recipe!

We loved this recipe. I didnt pour the sause over the pork chops in the oven right away  as directed  because the chops were not done over the skillet. After they were done in the oven, I poured the sause on. They were fabulous!!

STELLAR recipe. In following the trend here I made a few changes as well. I too decided to bake them in the oven as opposed to pan-cooking them. My pork chops wound up being a bit tough but I think it was the cut of the meat - I'm convinced baking them in the oven kept them from becoming too hard. I also doubled the brown-sugar mixture and wish I had quadrupled it so that I could cook some separately - some of the oil from the pork chops made the apples a bit too oily for my tastes but they were still juicy and flavorful. In the future I'll definitely try a different cut of pork, something larger. After chowing down on just one pork chop I was disappointed there wasn't more on my plate! I definitely will use this recipe again in the future.

These were great. Followed the recipe closely. Did add garlic & onions, cooked them in half the butter before adding the seasoning and apples and the rest of the butter.  Also added 1/2c chicken broth to have more 'sauce'.  Forgot to add the pecans though, everyone was eager for supper it smelled so wonderful!

Yum!  I did these in a flameproof brasier, browned them and then let them cook slowly with the lid on.  Made the sauce separately, and served on a pretty tray.  They were tender and tasty.  I would probably be tempted to add some thyme or lemon thyme to them next time just to add a little more depth of flavor.    Oh.....I used regular butter instead of the unsalted.

I liked this recipe a lot. What better combination than pork chops and apples? Unfortunately my kids didn't like it. I cut my apples into bite size pieces rather than slices, and I left out the nuts. Very yummy!

YUMM-Y. I was short on time and came accross this recipe. SO glad I tried it. Big hit - even our children gobbled it up! I had to add a teensy bit of apple juice when cooking the apples because I thought it looked dry, but it could be because I used olive oil instead of butter(?). This one will be a regular in the rotation!

OMG!!  This is fabulous!  Made as directed except instead of just letting the sauce thicken at the end, I reduced it by 1/3.  Really intensified the flavor.  My husband and I were tempted to lick the pan clean.  Absolutely the best pork chop and apples recipes I've tried.

This was really good -the kids loved it.  I doubled the sauce and added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it.  I may bake it at a low heat for longer next time though b/c the chops came out a little dry cooking them on the stovetop.

Deeeeelicious. Tender and juicy, with just a little bit of sweetness. I'm lazy, though, and didn't make any sort of caramel. I just mixed the apples with the brown sugar and some pumpkin pie spice (apple would be awesome too!) and dumped it on the chops once they were nicely brown. I think the secret here is controlling the heat and not allowing things to progress too far before you're ready. A slow oven (250 degrees) for 15-20 minutes and they came out perfect. I basted what little 'juice' that was this delicious marriage between brown sugar and the butter into and man, these were good! Really easy, too.

This was fantastic! I agree with other reviews about marinating and making for sauce than this calls for.  I made this for 4 people, but made 8 thin chops instead of using 4 thicker chops. This helped with time, as they cooked faster but on a lower temperature, ensuring they didn't get tough.  I made a soy sauce and apple cider vinegar marinade like someone suggested. I used 1 cup of each, marinated them for about 3 hours, and they turned out well. I made them stovetop like the recipe suggests, but instead of cooking them in oil I used the left over marinade and covered the pan to keep the moisture in. It worked out great!  As for the sauce, I made about quadruple and it was enough for eight chops. Two apples was still plenty for the eight chops.  Overall, amazing dish, just needs a few tweaks to be perfect. :]

I made these last night and all I can say is that they brought big smiles to my family. These were so good, I did double the sauce, but made no otherchanges to the recipe.  Tha apples were wonderful, and I know I will make this over and over, I will not wait until fall or winter, I bet this world be great in the slow cooker.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good, I would use apple marmalade or apple sauce next time to get the sauce a little thicker. All in all a good recipe.   I also dipped the pork chops in flour just to coat a little.

This did not work out for my family, everyone but me is a picky eater though, so I was fair and gave it four stars. It was somewhat blander than I'm used to. The actual diner I made tonight I would only give one star, but to be fair I gave this four b/c the idea of it was great. I might have over cooked mine also and I'm not a super fan of pork chops.

DELICIOUS! I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the sauce near the end as well and it gave it a nice little spice. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. Everyone loved it!

The top review to marinate these in a combo of soy and apple juice is spot on. They were great and with this addition is a five star recipe. The apples and marinated pork compliment each other very well. Yummy!

This was so easy and delish! My granddaughter loved it and my 8 yr. old grandson went and got a bowl of cereal! But after staring at his meal for awhile , he tried it again and ate most of the meat. WHY IT IS SO WELL COOKED?!). His dad is a beef eater. He doesn't understand that pork has to be cooked well done. I loved it and my home smelled great!

super duper easy dinner. Takes me no time to make up and tastes great. Did no modifications and enjoyed twice this week because it was just that good.  I served it with garlic mashed potatos and asparagus.

Easy and pretty darn good, since apples accomodate pork with a flare. A bit sweet...but all in all it was good if you are looking for someting out of the ordinary. I would prepare this again!

OMG! My family loved this!  I followed  the recipe almost exactly except I used salted butter because I did not have any unsalted butter.  I omitted the salt because of this.  I did add 1/4 cup of raisins when I mixed in the apples!  It was delicious!  This is definitely going to be a repeat meal in this household!  Great Recipe!

This dish was GREAT.  Very easy and the family loved it.  The apple dressing on the pork chops was perfect and people went back for seconds.  I forgot to use salt and pepper but it did not matter.

I actually followed this recipe to the T. I'm pretty new at cooking and it was so easy to follow. I made this for my husband on Valentines day and he was skeptical at first but says he will no longer question my cooking cause he fell in love.

Very nice dish. The pork chops were not over flavored with the sauce. Everything complimented each other very nicely. I served it with corn and stuffing..... This will be a repeat for us.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I doubled the sauce but found it too greasy. After skimming the top it was much better. Maybe only add 3 tblsp of butter if doubling sauce. Otherwise very good apples tasted just like pie.

Okay recipe, not very special, no one in my family of 5 thought I should make it again.   I baked the pork chops for an hour at 350 so they came out very tender & tripled the sauce recipe & baked them in the apples & sauce.   Even though the pork chops were tender the sauce did not absorb into the chops so it tasted kind of bland with a sauce on top that tasted just ok.  Baked rather than saute in a pan because I think 5 - 6 minutes in a pan would not make the pork chops tender but rather tough.

Amazing. I followed the recipe exactly (except I marinated in the soy/apple juice for a few hours). I was a little nervous with the chops in the pan, but was not disappointed. So delicious and will definitely make it again soon before the season is over!

My husband is absolutely raving about these fabulous pork chops. So easy. Marinated for 4 hours in apple cider vinegar & soy sauce (about half & half).I did use apple sauce and just a little honey no brown sugar,no butter no pecans. Seared chops then covered with apple sauce mixture and baked covered at 350F for 40 minutes. Removed chops and let sauce reduce on top of the stove until gravy consistency. Fantastic served with garlic mashed potatoes and stir fry veggies (carrots,broccoli,red peppers,asparagus,greenonion) in grape seed oil.

We think these are pretty good. We used the apple pie filling and made extra sauce since everyone recommended it. The apple pie filling lady marinated the chops over night in 2x apple juice to soy,but i didn't have time to do this. I will try that next time. I fried some onions in butter like another lady suggested and it was good. This was not a huge hit but I have a strong feeling that the pie filling idea was much better than the original.

I followed (the seemingly logical) advice of other reviewers who chose to bake everything all together so that the pork chops would be able to soak in the sauce while cooking.  I thought this would be especially important for my chops, as they were pretty thick.  I put them in a pyrex dish, topped with the apples and poured the sauce over all.  Baked it covered at 360 for an hour.  I then poured off the sauce and apples into a small saucepan and boiled it down.  The pork was good - it tasted mildly of cinnamon and was moist.  The apples were also good - warm and spicy.  I did not, however, get that over the top sweet and spicy effect I was looking for.  Maybe it's my fault for not following the directions exactly, but I'm just not even excited enough to try it again.

This was a great recipe.  My family of 5 loved it, and gave it the thumbs way up for a second appearance at our table.    I love the reviews on this site, and combined several suggestions.  I melted a bit of butter and cooked a quarter of an onion until clear, then placed pork brushed with olive oil in onion/butter and browned the outside.  I placed the browned chops in a casserole dish, and made the sauce, mixing everything together in the skillet, keeping it bubbling until it began to thicken.  Then spooned caramel apple mixture over chops, covered casserole dish with foil, and baked for 25 minutes.   It was tender, juicy, and all three of my little girls loved it, as well as my husband, who is not so much a "sweet" fan when it comes to meats.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans for a great dinner!  Thanks for the recipe start and suggestions!

Some liked it some didn't.  Didn't find that it had the flavour I had expected, and in order to increase the sauce, I had to add more butter and it made it greasy.  Don't think I will make it again.

This was the first time I have attemped this recipe and found it very easy.  I put the apples on top of the chops and the sauce around them then covered with foil and baked in the over slowly for about 45mins.  The reason for this was that the chops were shoulder cut and I was worried about them being tough but they turned out fine.  I think next time I will add a bit of honey and take the foil off for the last ten minutes. Good recipe

I marinated it for 4 hours in apple cider vinegar + soy sauce...and ended up baking it instead of pan frying it.  It came out pretty tasty and everyone enjoyed it.  The sauce was good but wasn't amazing in my opinion...but it gave the pork a nice taste.

These were part of an awesome dinner w/ Green Bean Bundles and Smashed potatoes, also from this site. EXCELLENT!!!! I was told only to make more of the sauce, maybe for dipping on side or drizzling on top. Some were skeptical of the pecans, but were pleasantly surprised to find that they tasted DELICIOUS. I didn't change and wouldn't change a thing! Thanks for this one.

This recipe is one of the best I have found on allrecipes.  My husband is constantly asking me to make this again and again!  I agree with other reviewers when they say to make more sauce then what is suggested in the recipe.  I would definitly triple the ingredients for the sauce, if not more.  Absolutely delicious!

The sauce on these pork chops was very good.  I followed the recipe as written (although I did as others suggested, doubled the sauce recipe).  The pork chops were a bit tough, but this is one that I would probably try again as the tough chops were probably my fault!  Thanks for the recipe!

My family thought the name of this recipe sounded gross. It really doesn't taste like a caramel apple (thank goodness), it's much better. I doubled the sauce like the other reviewers suggested.

These porkchops came out deliciously tender. The recipe is missing a little something though...it's a little too sweet and needs some heat or tang to kick it up a notch. Next time I will  add some onions...

I have cooked this recipe over 20X and each time it is as excellent as the first. I did take the opinion of another review and marinated the chops in apple juice and soy sauce. It tasted the same. One thing that I always do is double the ingredients for the sauce.  It is difficult to go wrong with this recipe if you follow the directions

This recipe had great flavor. The only thing that I will change next time is to marinate the porkchops in cinnamon, brown sugar, nutmeg and then cook them as described in the recipe so that the taste would go all the way through the pork chops.

Ok, I cheated. . . I think this recipe is good that's why I rated it a 4-star.  That being said, here is my tweaked recipe:  I wanted spicy/sweet so I used an Apple Jerk seasoning on the pork chops and I didn't use the oven to keep them warm.  After reading the reviews of pork chops drying out in the oven I steered away from the oven.  I just put the hot (temperature) apples and sauce on top of the pork chops.  I also didn't put the salt and pepper in the sauce.  My family LOVED this dish.

These were fantastic! I implemented advise given by others and marinated 4 hours in apple juice and soy sauce  (2 to 1). Then browned chops on both sides and put in casserole dish then topped with apples and poured thickened mixture over all. Baked in a 350 oven for 30 minutes.  Amazingly moist and great flavor!

This recipie gave us fantastic pork chops, after a few modifications.  After 6 min. in the pan, my pork chops were no where near done.  I added some apple juice to the baking dish, covered it with foil and baked the pork chops for 45minutes.  It was dissaponting to have to wait the extra time for dinner, but I will know to plan that time in for the next go round.

This is an awesome recipe and what makes it even better is the suggestions made by others - thank you for your time to reply - I used a few different suggestions and it turned out to be just awesome. Next time I am going to put it all in a large cassroll dish and cook it all together so it more sauce-y.  I also added 2 tbsp of minced garlic to the onions, and chopped the apples into smaller bits - so it wasn't so thick and chunky.  I would think that you could do this in a slow cooker too, and also with a Pork Tenderloin - it would be very good on this too!  Husband liked it but wanted a saucier sauce - perhaps needs some apple juice or something.

Made this recipe with the suggestions (marinated in soysauce/apple juice mix and baked on 350 for 25 min) of others and was pleasantly surprised.    Certainly an ideal fall meal.

Really needs tweaking - read the reviews. I made as directed but tried "doubling the sauce," as recommended, but it ended up burning since it's only a few tablespoons of butter!! Something is missing... I usually don't have trouble like this. Next time I will try marinating or using a rub on the pork, because the only flavor was in the apples and the meat was just... pork-flavored.

What goes better with pork chops than apple sauce?  So why not just make them with apples?  My whole family loves this recipe.  Quick, easy, and yummy.

This is an awesome recipe that serves up beautifully! I changed a few things. I added a small jar of maraschino cherries with juice and 4 TB brown sugar, Adobo seasoning, and low salt Teriyaki sauce. I seasoned the pork chops on both sides with all of the seasonings, including the nutmeg and the cinnamon. The last two changes I made were that after I seasoned the chops on both sides I browned them in extra virgin olive oil and 2 TB butter. I deglazed the pan with white wine . Then I transferred the meat to the preheated dish in the oven and I covered it. I added the apples, cherries, and all of the caramel sauce ingredients to the skillet that I had cooked the meat in. After the apples are almost totally tender I returned the meat to the skillet and turned them a few times to coat the chops well with the sauce and to get the fruit well distributed within the pan. I served the dish right out of the pan on the table. It was really pretty and I would not think twice about entertaining with it!  My husband and 17-year-old son, and even my very picky 5-year-old daughter raved about the entire meal. I served brown rice and green beans with the pork chops. Just a side note; the caramel sauce and fruit were pretty sweet, actually they were almost too sweet unless there was a bite of pork with it. Instead of the sauce and apples making the pork, it was the other way around.

Absolutley delish!! Neither my husband or I are huge pork chop fans & after I made a maple glazed pork chop some time ago that was a complete disaster my husband stated he never wanted pork chops again! But looking to have something diffrent for dinner I found this recipe & bought some more. I had 3 boneless pork chops & the only change I made was that I seasoned them with pepper, garlic powder & some steak seasoning then fried them in the oil. Also I doubled the sauce as other reviewers mentioned but left the amount of apples the same. I'm soo glad I did cause there was a perfect amount & I don't think it would have been nearly enough for 3 chops when the recipe called for 4. So I will definatley at least double from now on. I also will double the apples as well cause I thought they were the best part!! Soo good! It was so easy & looked soo beautiful on the plate!  I served with rice & green beans. My husband was complaining that this was going to be another gross pork chop dinner! As soon as he took a bite he looked at me & said this is actually really good! And boy was it!!! He said that if I ever made pork chops again it had to be this one! Thanks for giving me a great recipe to enjoy pork chops again!!!

I marinated my pork chops in apple jack brandy with OJ overnight.  I also dredged my pork chops in flour before I fried them in olive oil.  I also trippled the sauce.  ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!!!  Tastes like it should come from a nice restaurant...  YUM!!!

We loved this recipe.  I was looking for something to make after work..I had to stop @ the store, pick up the pork chops. Got home..and had this together in exactly 45 min.  Very very good.  I usually change a few things..but not this time.  We will make this again.

This is a great dish! My boyfriend and both loved it!! and he is a fussy eater. I did tweak it just a bit. I substituted the butter for I can't believe its not butter to reduce fat, I also did not have any nutmeg so doubled the cinnamon and used a 1/2 tsp more of the light brown sugar, i also used an additional 1 1/2 tbls of olive oil rather then the oil suggested. i paired this with homemade applesauce and butternut squash..awesome fall/ winter dinner.

I was skeptical at first, but I love caramel appes and I also love pork, so I figured what would it hurt? This dish was absolutely delightful and a joy preparing. I absolutely loved the sweet and salty taste. Sooo yummy! A must have recipe in your collection!

Very good and easy to make.  We grilled the pork instead of cooking it on the stove top.  I also put onion pierogies with it which was a good pairing.

Wow.  Just wow.  I made this as written, except I didn't bake the pork chops.  I sauteed the chops, took them out of the pan and made the sauce.  After the apples reduced a bit, I returned the chops to the pan, turned the heat down and let the entire thing simmer for a bit.  (I'm a sucker for a one skillet meal.)    I served these with a veggie couscous (also a quick, one skillet dish.)  My husband asked to me put these into our menu rotation, a high compliment from him.

Very good. It definitely needed more sauce so I doubled the recipe and it turned out very good. I think I need to *perfect* it for our family's tastebuds, but I thought it was a refreshing change that was quite good.

I marinated the pork chops in applejuice/soy and wow they were really juicy and tender.  I will definitely do that again.  This recipe is really good but no one cared for the apples.  I guess we see apples as a dessert and not part of a main course.  Will definitely make this again but just without the apples or brush the apples off after they bake.  Thanks for the new way to make pork chops!

This is a great recipe to have for the fall season. I stocked up on pork tenderloins (bargain prices due to swine flu fears..), but was running out of ways to cook this meat.  I seasoned my pork medallions with onion and garlic powder and placed in an greased baking dish. I topped them with the apple mixture and baked at 350 for 30 minutes as suggested by reviewers. the apple mixture- I doubled it and used seasonal apples. I also added cayenne pepper for kick (and to cut some of the sweetness), and spinkled some ground ginger for depth. I made the mixture in one pan, without removing the apples. I added a 1/2 tsp of cornstarch to thicken.   After baking the pork and apple mixture, i saw that  there was lots of liquid released from the pork. I basted the medallions with this and served with mashed potatoes and zesty green beans. It was a hit, even to skeptics. Perhaps next time I will remove the drippings (pork drippings and apple mixture) and thicken for more of a glaze or "gravy" for the apples. A Keeper!! AAA+++

I made 3 pork chops for myself and my boyfriend, which was the perfect amount.  I made the sauce as directed, except I only used one apple.  I put them in a 9x13 casserole dish, covered them with the apples and sauce, and then drizzled maple syrup over the top.  Baked it for 30 minutes.  Delicious and juicy!  Served with green beans and baked yams.

Like others I skipped the pan-frying and instead baked these at 350 for about 40 minutes. They were AWESOME!

Loved this and I am not a pork fan. Baked it in the oven for 30 minutes. Tripled the sauce. Marinated meat overnight in soy sauce and apple juice.

This is one of my family's favorite dishes. Not only is it tasty, but I like it because it is easy and quick to prepare. I skip the baking portion completely. I also only use half of the brown sugar (1 TBSP) and double the cinnamon and it still tastes great! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Great family meal! My husband and 14 month old son loved this dish. I used a cast iron pan for the chops & sauce, and it worked very nicely. Also, I'm pretty sure I almost doubled the butter called for, and added just a touch of vanilla extract. Yum! Great fall dish that would pair well with brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes, even stuffing!

This was a very good recipe, marinating was a great idea.  I think the apple flavor was not enough of a "star" in this dish.  Marinating it in soy and apple as previously mentioned is a great idea.  Good fresh fall dish.

DELICIOUS!  The only reason it gets four stars is because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I browned my chops and then put them in an orange juice/soy/worcestershire mixture and baked uncovered on 350 while I made the sauce.  I doubled up on everything except apples, as suggested by others.  When I put the chops in the sauce I added a bit of the cooking juice.  So good, even my VERY picky child gobbled it up!

I cooked mine in the oven rather than deal with the stove top.  I made the apples as the recipe calls for. Placed chops in a greased pan and put the apples on top of the pork with a little of the sauce and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes until the chops were done.  I then finished cooking the sauce as the recipe calls for and topped the cooked chops with the sauce and pecans.  Serve with some squash and it's WONDERFUL!!

This was relatively easy and really good. The perfect balance of salty and sweet! My husband and 2 year old both ate it all up.  I used slightly thicker chops and added some powdered ginger to the sugar/cinnamon/nutmeg/salt/pepper.  Serving with roasted acorn squash made a really hearty fall meal.

This was tasty and different than anything that we had tried before. The apples were amazing and throwing the pecans on top was an extra bonus. The pork was good but the apples were the star. It smells like fall!

Very simple, good but, needed something (could tell that even before making it). Completely changed the apple part - added a some fresh orange zest, 2 tablespoons of grand mariner and a tablespoon of bourbon - here was the kicker - added about a tablespoon of crystallized ginger (the kind you get from gourmet stores) - the apples turned out amazing and much more flavor!

Great flavor in the sauce! The apples and pecans were great in it! The pork came out dry. I've never really had much luck with pork being juicy anyways. Next time I'll triple the sauce and bake chops in a casserole as other reviewers have recommended. This made a great fall time dinner!

Loved the flavors but the pork was dry, and there wasn't much sauce to speak of. I didn't double or triple the sauce ingredients as recommended by other reviewers, and I will definitely do that next time. I think with modifications this could be really good.

This is likely something I will make again, but the pork chops didn't have enough flavor.  Next time I will probably marinate them or something.  I sprinkled them rather generously with salt, garlic, and fresh ground pepper, browned them in a cast iron skillet and then baked them for about 30 minutes with the sauce.

This is really good and when you have apples on hand you have pretty much everything else needed, the recipe doesn't call for any weird ingredients.  I tripled the sauce as another reviewer had suggested, and it was perfect when I put it in the oven.  I had enough to coat the bottom of the pan and to cover the chops completely.  I don't know how I would have done that with the original amount of sauce.  One thing I will do differently next time is reduce the amount of butter in the sauce.  It doesn't add much to the taste, since the apples are the main flavour here.  I think I could omit the fat altogether next time.  I will definitely be trying this one in the slow-cooker for even more tenderness, and I'll post back once I have done it that way!  This one really wakes up pork.  I am not a pork fan in general, but I'd have this at least once a month.

Our family found these just "ok." I didn't use the pecans, but followed the recipe exactly aside from that.  It was good, but not awesome.

Awesome recipe! I would definitely recommend marinating the pork chops in apple juice/soy sauce for at least 3 hours before baking.  I also baked them in the oven covered.  They were really juicy!

Not bad. The pork got a bit dry after pan frying and not enough sauce. The flavor was great, though! I did not have pecans either. I will try again.

I loved this....it was such a change from the canned mushroom soup recipes most of the meat dish preparations require on this site.  It was subtle with a hint of caramel sweetness.  I should say that I forgot to buy the pecans on my shopping trip...and only had one apple at home so substituted a pear for the second apple.  It was delish....I liked the mix of apple and pear.  Since they look alike on top of the pork you're not quite sure what to expect with each bite.

With 10 chops, i quadrupled the ingredients for the perfect amount of sauce to pour over each chop as they were gobbled up.  Best chops ever. My husband packed the leftovers for lunch HIMSELF.  I will make these again for sure.

This was sooooo good!  I have never made pork chops so I was pretty excited to try it.  This recipe didn't disappoint me at all.  I did however tripled the sauce, toasted my pecans and baked it like others have suggested.

My pork chops were small. I doubled everything, and it worked out fine.  I also browned the chops, then placed them in the oven, topped with the apples and sauce, then baked at 350 for 30 minutes, covered, and uncovered for 10 minutes.  It gave me time to finish up the rest of the meal.

I always stayed away from sweet meat.  Tastes like an apple pie on top of delicious pork... oh, sweet Jesus.  =)

My husband LOVED this!  I made a pork roast this way instead of pork chops.  I quadrupled the ingredients and used 4 granny smith apples.  It was a hit!

This recipe is a great combination of flavors. I used salt, pepper, and garlic to season the pork chops and doubled the sauce, and it turned out great.

I'm a vegetarian but my fiancee is not. He loves porkchops and he's EXTREMELY PICKY!!!  I've been experimenting with adding fruits to porkchops and he's been reasonably tolerant. I decided to cook this recipe for him (sans pecans) and he loved it and asked if I'd make this again. Thanks so much for sharing, this recipe will be in our "frequently served" file.

Yummy! This recipe is wonderful. My 5 year old son requested this and my husban said gee I'm not hungry(meaning I think that sound gross!). I made it anyway and while it was cooking it smelled awesome. My husban said well maybe I'll try a bite. Well his bite turned into 2 chops and a request for it again! Thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe! My Fiance and I have it almost once a week! I always double the sauce and I also add apple juice to the sauce, which helps make a little bit more. Also, I took advice from other reviewers and I marinade the pork chops for about 8 hours with 2 parts apple juice to one part low-sodium soy sauce! The chops come out moist and delicious!

I'm not a big pork chops fan but I always like to mix it up a little bit and this recipe was excellent. I doubled the sauce like some people suggested and it turned out to be the perfect amount for my family of three (with just enough left over to drizzle over the extra chop and have for lunch the next day). I also decided to bake them since I thought it sounded harder to mess up and am glad I did. Very juicy and delightful :).

This recipe was delicious!  I didn't have any apples, so I used two peaches instead.  It didn't peel them, and the color of the peel added a lot to the presentation. It turned out great (I haven't made it with apples so I don't know how it would compare).  I followed other people's advice to double the sauce.

I thought this was REALLY good.  I only gave it 4 stars, because my hubby thought it was good, but not great.  My kids would not touch it.  But let me also add that I am the only apple lover of my family.  My hubby and kids do not typically like baked cinnamon apples.  If it were just me, I would give this 5 stars.  I found the recipe around 5:30 pm, when I was wondering what on earth I was going to make for dinner.  I considered ordering out, but so glad I made this instead!  I had everything on hand, and it was easy and fast!  I followed recipe exact, except I did make 4times the sauce, otherwise there would not have been enough.  Thanks!

I made this for Mother's Day for the family with a spinach salad and sweet potato fries.  This was very tasty!  I multiplied the sauce ingredients x4.  I am not usually a fan of warm apples, but I really enjoyed them in this dish.  Another yummy twist on pork chops!

Like others, I baked this in the oven, doubled the sauce recipe, and got rave reviews.  When I asked my husband what he thought, he said, "I am so tired of pork chops, but this was great.  Different and tasty!"

Very easy to make.  Don't worry about the oven deal.  Just fry off the pork chops and heat up the sauce at the same time.  Double the sauce recipe.

This is a great recipe, In reading other reviews I baked the chops in an oven for one hour on 350 and doubled the sauce recipe.  I would recommend, my kids loved these!

This was very yummy.  I did a few changes as per other reviewers.  I marinated in a soy sauce/apple juice for a few hours.  I also doubled the sauce, but only used 2 apples.  I also baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  I will make again soon.

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!  I used Empire apples and finished the recipe in the skillet as I was using my oven for two other recipes.  I thought this would be good because I always serve applesauce with pork chops; but, it was AMAZINGLY GOOD!

This was awesome!  And I don't generally like pork chops!  My modifications: canola oil for vegetable oil, and I just put all of the ingredients in a crock pot for a few hours.  Apples should be added later in the cooking process.

Eh, not real good.  It's just pan fried pork chops with cinnamon apples poured over the top.  I was expecting a bit more of a succulent creation than this.  The taste was okay, just nothing special.

This recipe was o.k.  I was looking for something new and I thought my daughter would like the apples.  Turned out she did not like the apples and ended up eating the bland meat with ketchup.  I gave it 4 stars because my husband liked it but he would've preferred an apple sauce to dip instead. Sorry, not a keeper recipe for us.

Used 4 chops. Marinated, as suggested by another reviewer, in apple juice-soy sauce mixture for a little more than 24 hours. Then browned in pam-sprayed pan.  Placed in foil-lined pan.  Used one can of apple pie filling, as also suggested by the other reviewer, and sprinkled cinnamon and nutmeg over the top of the apples, after heating with 1/2 cup butter in pan.  Covered with additional foil and cooked at 350 for 30 minutes, then uncovered and sprinkled with brown sugar and left uncovered for another 15-30 minutes.  Yummy.

These were good. I didn't get much sauce out of them, so I didn't have to reduce anything on the stovetop.

Over all this tasted great.  The pork chops were bland but once you put on the apples and sugar glaze they were oh so good.  I paired this up with the sweet potatoes that someone else suggested and it was fabulous.  next time I will marinate the pork chops first.

One of the best pork dishes I've made to date!! The family loved it & have been asking for more ever since.  I added sliced onions to the sauce mix which made it more savory than sweet. This recipe is now among a small group that I refuse to share with my fantastic cook of a mother in law. I now have a pork dish that tops any of hers, and I plan to keep it that way no matter how selfish lol.

Excellent!! I am so glad I didn't let this recipe pass me by (almost used a different one but the apples made curious)!  Husband and I really enjoyed this dish!  Will be making this again for sure!  I followed the recipe to the letter!

It was pretty good.. I made some changes though. I browned the pork chops then put them aside, i made the apples in the skillet and added a little cornstarch and apple juice to thicken it up and make more of a sauce. Then i put the sauce on top of the pork chops and stuck them in the oven for about 20 mins on 350. Came out so juicy.

This was delicious. I loved the apples!! I made a side of yellow corn grits to go with it, and it looked like a gourmet meal. It was so easy to make. I will make this for the next dinner party!

This was YUMMY.  My only complaint is that the apples and sauce need to be at least doubled - the kids went crazy for them.  My husband, who is not a pork chop fan ate it all.

Very yummy. Took the advice of others and at least doubled the sauce.  Would be great with boneless pork chops too...more convenient too with the kids.  Will make again!  Thank you!

It was a delicious meal once I made a mound of changes.  As the other reviewers stated: too little sauce!  I was prepared for this on account of all the reviews so I trippled the sauce.  Still, once I removed the apples (and I used 4 of them) there was nothing in the pan to thicken, so I dumped them back in and added about a cup of pork stock I had in the freezer. I forgot to mention that before cooking the apples, I glazed a cup or so of chopped onion.  I thickened the sauce slightly with a bit of corn starch and left out the cinnamin (it just sounded strange to use on a meat dish).  Anyway, with these changes it was excellent.

Pork chops were a bit on the dry side, but it might have been my fault cooking it. The apple sauce was a bit runny so simmer it a bit more to get it thicker rather than adding flour/starch.

I seasoned the pork chops with garlic, minced onion, white wine and salt and pepper.  Then I cooked them on the grill.  Even though I took the advice of many other reviewers and made more of the sauce, I found this wasn't necessary.  The end result was delicious though.  I will make this again.

these are sooo good, i added onion to the butter and caramalized them before starting the rest of the sauce and then just poured the sauce over the browned chops and finished it up in the oven. the only other change i made was adding some heat with some crushed red pepper flakes, otherwise they would have just been too sweet

loved this recipe.  i made it as is and the presentation and flavors were great!  the only thing that didnt work for me: after i put the apples on the pork chops, there was hardly and sauce left in the pan.  so i just made the sauce again (butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg) and let it thicken a bit then poured this over the pork chops/apples.  thanks for much for the recipe!!

I did marinate the chops overnight in a mix of soy sauce and apple juice, and I substituted light butter.  I agree with what others have written about the amount of sauce - I QUADRUPLED the sauce recipe (still just 2 apples) and it turned out just right.  Very nice flavor.

Yum! We used the suggestions of onion and apple cider vinegar which cut the sweetness. Since our year old daughter eats with us we used brown rice syrup instead of sugar, no salt and fuji apples instead of granny smith. We may omit the sugar completely next time. We followed the baking directions as well so we could make rice and sauted spinach while it cooked. We may try it in the slow cooker next time. Good eats!

I was skeptical and kept putting this recipe off, despite the reviews.  When it rolled over to the second page of my recipe box I knew I had to make it soon.  It's great!  Very simple to prepare and tasty.  Makes for a different dish to break up the dinner time blues!

I rate this 5 stars because the left overs that we reheated the next day were even better than the first night! When I make this again I will definetly marinate the meat and like others suggested I will thicken the sauce with cornstarch, because it was pretty thin.

This recipe was good and on point! I followed the recipe to letter with one or two tweaks. (I added a little banana since I had one that was rottening, and I wish I had browned the chops by broiling them first. Kids and hubby LOVED it. We ate it alongside a salad and mashed potatoes...talk about flavorful!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  It was easy to make,took very little time to prepare and looked fantastic enough to wet anyone's appetite.  My mother-in-law, who was a first class cook herself, once told me that presentation was half the battle and if that is true, this recipe deserves a 5 star rating. I will use this recipe for whatever the occasion, whenever we want pork and for whoever comes for dinner.

They came out so juicy we were fighting for more. We never really liked pork chops, now this is one of my favorite dishes!  The basics for this dish were good. I changed it some. Like the rest I made a lot more sauce. I fried the pork chops in the skillet with virgin olive oil for a light browning. Then transfered sauce, apples and chops into the oven at 350 for 40 min. I added some water to the sause and after baking for 20 min added some corn starch to thicken it up. Next time I will buy a lot more pork chops!

My husband and I LOVED this recipe! I've only cooked pork chops one other time and they had turned out dry and gross. Needless to say, I was a little hesitant to try this recipe. But, with my hand little thermometer, I was able to cook it to a perfect 150 degrees.  I added a small yellow onion and a few handfuls of spinach.  Thank you!!

I loved the recipe. After reading all the reviews, I did decided not to pan fry the chops first, I just added them in a baking dish, after forking them, and added all the sauce on top and baked for 35-40 mins. Came out great! I did have to make more sauce to drizzle on top of the chops and apples after plating. The alterations I made on the sauce was adding 1 shot or Bourbon to the sauce along with an extra spoon or brown sugar and extra pad of butter. The sauce drizzled over the chops gave it an extra kick!!

I made these last night, and they turned out pretty good. I will agree with many other posters though, and say that the original amount of sauce called for in this recipe is not enough. Double the sauce (I ended up tripling mine). I found the apples to be a bit too tart for my tastes, so next time I'll sprinkle them with a bit of cinnamon and sugar before I cook them. Followed the recipe mostly, but instead of fully cooking the chops in the skillet, I cooked a few minutes in skillet, then baked in oven with the sauce and still somewhat firm apples on top (the apples, of course softened when baking) at 375 for 20 minutes and they came out so tender and juicy. Not quite what I was hoping for (as more sauce would have made the dish better for me), in addition to the pork chops having a bit more flavoring. I suggest seasoning them mildly before cooking in the skillet, and I'm sure baking helps them from drying out (as some have complained about happening). Just a thought. I will make again and tweak it to my tastes, which should easily make this one of my favorite dishes to look forward to.

DEEEEEE-licious!!!  I made this for dinner last night.  It was a total hit!  This could easily become a family favorite.  The crunch of the pecans made this even better.  Awesome recipe!

This was pretty good but not worth the total effort. Before browning the chops I dipped them in flour seasoned with Lemon pepper and italian seasoning. This helped to keep the meat from being to dry. After browning I placed in the oven to finish coooking. I made the sauce in the same frying pan and I had to triple it. The sauce itslef is delicious and gave the meat a nice glaze. The apples didn't really take the flavour of the sauce too much and if I were to make this again I would try to find a way for the apples to retain the sauce flavour as well. My husband ate it but didn't say anything while eating it except to complain when the caramelized sauce stuck to his teeth. A nice change of pace but I don't think I will make this again. Served with broccoli, brazilian rice and baked sweet potato sticks.

These pork chops came out way too dry for me. The concept is good, but there must be a better way to keep the chops juicy. The topping was delicious, though.

My husband is a picky eater, and he says this is the best pork chops he's ever had.  I used butter instead of oil in the pan when I cooked the pork chops.  I used walnuts instead of pecans in the sauce (didn't have any pecans on hand), and I chopped up the walnuts and half of one apple into pieces (diced the apple into bits).  I also doubled the sauce as some others had done in the reviews and there was plenty.  Quick & Easy.

Easy and very tasty! I also broiled the chops and left the apples in the sauce to thicken, doing both things at once to speed the process. Left out the pecans because of allergy in the family, but the recipe was just as flavorful as could be.

This is a fantastic recipe even if you follow the directions as is. But like everyone else, I have my own version... I like extra sauce because we are dippers. I also don't bake the chops I keep them covered in the Microwave (Not cooking, just resting) while cooking the apples, then I add it all together and zap it in the Microwave for about a minute just to give the chops a brief waming then it's ready. This way the chops don't dry out. Nothing worse than dry porkchops. I serve with White rice and garlic butter steamed green beans.

This was excellent! Only thing is it tasted like a dessert at times, but I would defiantly make again. I did bake the chops after cooking them on the frying pan. I didnt thicken the sauce right away and poured it over the chops and baked for about a half hour, then thickened up the sauce. My boyfriend loved them, and I will make them again.

Pretty good. I usually make my pork chops the same old way but was looking for something different. Both hubby and 4 yr old gobbled them up. I will likely make them again.

Very good.  Next time I will add a bit of apple juice with a touch of corn starch to thicken as the apples didn't make much on their own.  I will also insure I season the pork chops to my liking before adding the apples on top.  I didn't want any salt on the apples but the chop needed some.  I found myself scraping off the apples, seasoning, and then reassembling.  :)

It turned out pretty good, it was like having dessert for dinner. All the ingredients worked together, but my husband who eats almost anything in sight, didn't like it. That says something in my book..But everyone else at the table enjoyed it. They called it very interesting..:)

I did not care for this recipe at all. My pork chops turned out tough and chewy - browning them in the pan the recommended time was not noearly enough to cook them through, so I had to finish them in the oven. The pork chops did not take on the apple flavor as I had hoped either. Perhaps ths would be better if the pork was marinated first in apple juice. I don't think I'd try this one again though.

I followed reviewers advice and decided to make the carmel sauce on the stove and bake the pork chops.  I put the apples over pork chops I had marinated the night before in apple cider, cinamon and nutmeg.  I then poured the carmel over the apples and baked 35 mins. I paired it with some stuffing and rolls.  This was one of the best meals I have made.  I will make it again and again, I am sure it will soon be a fall favorite.

My family loved this recipe. I used a can of apple pie filling as suggested by another reviewer; it's saves a lot of time.  I've made this twice, once the boneless chops and once with cheaper pork steaks. I don't recommend using the pork steaks!!

Very good.  I tripled the sauce because we like sauce.  Next time I will add an extra apple as well.  May try baking or cooking it all together to flavor the chops more.

We absolutely love this as a sweet treat dinner once in a while.  I triple the apple/caramel mixture so my 3 boys and I have enough apples and sauce to go around.  I don't put the chops in the oven, just put them on a plate on the stove with a pan lid to keep them warm.  I usually cut up the chops, since my boys are too young for knives, and make a rice and veggie mixture in my rice steamer and top that with the chops and apples.  They gobble it all up with no leftovers and I've snuck in a serving of veggies to boot!

Thanks for the recipe. It was quite good.  I just substituted the butter for shortening and followed the suggestions of doubling the apple glaze, but not the apples.  We had it with cornbread and collard greens.  It was gooooood!!!!  will put this on rotation.

yum!  This was great - even by kids liked it (although my youngest didn't like the tart apples).  Next time will try either sweet apples or maybe peaches.
I marinaded the pork for 4 hours before with a mixture of OJ and soy sauce.  Also tripled the sauce.
Yummy!!

This one is definitely a keeper. I took the advice of some other reviewers and baked my chops. I did season them and brown them first. The recipe does not make enough sauce. I tripled it and still could have used some more. The combination of sweet and salty is just perfect. Next time I may lightly flour  season and then brown the chops before baking. It will probably make a really good 'smothered' chop :)

Pretty good!  I like the way the sauce turns out on this dish.  Just make sure you don't overcook your pork chops; I've made mine too dry a few times, not so great.  Thank you!

This is going to become a regular/special feast. It was easy to make and did not need any changes. It did double the recipe for sauce as recommended since we served it to guests. Everyone loved it!

Delicious! I lightly seasoned the pork chops (I had thinly sliced on hand) with McCormick's pork rub and threw into the skillet with a little oil, browned on both sides and removed. Added butter and the rest of the ingredients (doubled the mixture to make sure there was enough to soften the apples and get a nice caramalization on the pork chops) covered until apples were slightly softened and threw in pork chops (placed under apples) covered again, flipped and made sure both sides were caramalized. Served with potatoes and french cut green beans...my 19 month old loved it!

I made this for a dinner guests who absolutely raved over it.  Apart from taking longer to cook the chops - mine were very thick - I followed the recipe as is and was very satisfied with the results.  Served with baked sweet potatoes, fresh green beans, Pinot Grigio and pumpkin pie for dessert, it was a meal to remember!

Very good flavors, a nice fall-is-coming dish.  I will admit to being lazy though.  I used a jar of apple butter instead of cooking down my own apples, and then mixed with the butter and brown sugar.  I cooked the chops in 350 oven(after a quick saute to brown) topped with the sauce for 20 minutes, then topped it with pecans and cooked for ten minutes more.  My husband and 8 y/o liked it a lot(although her portion had to be sauce-scraped-off and nut-free).  I also let the chops marinate in a mixture of apple butter and dale's sauce for about four hours.  They came out quite juicy and yummy. I know I changed a good deal, but the inspiration came from the original recipe, and it definitely get a thumbs up!

EXCELLENT! I had never tried the combination of apples and pork, and I am glad I did! For the sake of convenience, I personalized the recipe just a bit and made everything in one large skillet. I rubbed the chops with chop spice, pan fried them in a dusting of olive oil, set them aside, then used the same pan to make the caramel apple sauce. I melted an entire stick of butter and sauteed half a sweet onion, chopped. Then I added the spices, two heaping spoonfuls of applesauce, and the apples. After the apples were tender, I placed the chops in the sauce while still on the stove for just a couple minutes to heat them back up. Then I served. Boy, was this a treat! My boyfriend said this was the best meal we've had! I highly recommend trying this!!!

Very tasty. Only problem was that the pork was overcooked, but obviously that's my fault! I left out the nutmeg and pecans, and added a few good squirts of honey to the apples while they were cooking. They were very tasty and not too sweet.

Excellent recipe!  I found this recipe using the ingredient search.  My wife and I loved it.  We had never cooked pork chops in a pan before and boy were they moist and full of flavor.  Our 5 year old loved the apples!  We used candied almonds from a recent trip to a Tiger baseball game!

It was very good!  i would just make sure the pork chops are cooked all the way through.  i did add sweet onion slices.  I would also make extra sauce to put over your rice.

I can't believe there are so many reviews for this recipe because it is bland at best. The apples are awesome - no doubt. But the chops are terribly bland. I might attempt another go at this recipe but marinading the chops first & maybe getting a more flavorful result. 3 stars for the apples - yum!

I'm giving this recipe a 4 because of the meat its self is rather bland. My husband and I have been making appley pork chops for years. We simmer the chops on low in a mixture of apple cider and fresh maple syrup to keep them tender and give them a great apple flavor, then we would add apples to the simmering dish. While I do like the way the apples are done in this recipe better than my own I think I will prepare the meat the same way I have in the past. 

This is a great recipe for those wanting heart healthy meals. Very low sodium!

This was great!  We eat way too much chicken in this house, and were looking for something more interesting that was still easy to make.  This was delicious, and so simple.  Thanks!

I did not care for this dish. The pork chops were not flavorful enough and the sauce was rather sweet/bland for my tastes. I like bold flavors so really, it is just a matter of personal tastes, I'm sure.

Such a wonderful recipe!  Made this pretty much as directed. Sprinkled Tony Chachere's on the chops while cooking.  Tripled the sauce ingredients except for apples.  Loved having the pecans because they added a nice crunchiness to the dish.  Served with whipped sweet potatoes and poured some of the sauce over them.  YUMMY!!

This recipe was surprisingly excellent! I don't typically dig apples in my main dish but it didn't taste too fruity. It gets better everytime I make it. I recommend doubling the sauce.

I thought this was very good considering how easy & quick it was. I used the Cuisinart to slice the apples and they were a perfect slice size. I coldn't find our nutmeg. Wish there'd been more liquid for the sauce. 72M, 62F (particularly the calorie count), 28F and 21M enjoyed it alot, but I found out that unfortunately, my 31M, 13F, and 10F do not like baked apples. What's not to like??? Geez! Anyways, they all just ate the pork chop, which by itself is very plain. I'll still make it again; they can suffer once a month! :) Thanks.

Very good and simple. Even my boyfriend loved it and requested it again, and he does not like pork chops. As he described it, it is "pork with apple pie on top." Next time I will definately make more apple topping.

Warm spicy and sweet like the title says, it really is great for a cold night.

You definitely do need to make a double/triple batch of the sauce and apples.

I broiled my chops since it's much easier and healthier. The only thing I would suggest on this is to slow cook the sauce for at least 20 minutes.

Next time I'm going to add onions like some other people have suggested. One last note, this probably won't go over THAT well with fussy eaters or children.

My 5 year old won't touch fruit and he eats ketchup on every meat imaginable. When I made this he actually ate the meat without ketchup and asked for more apples. It's a keeper for sure! I doubled the sauce mix too and it was just right.

Wow!  This recipe was faster and easier than I thought it would be -- and delicious, too.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  The only thing I did a little differently was to use the smallest oven dish possible so that all the yummy sauce and apples would surround and soak into the chops.  My husband says it's a "keeper!"

Perfect fall dinner. I did tweak it slightly. I upped the cinnamon & nutmeg to 1/4 tsp. Diced the apples and added 1/2 cup diced onion. Apples and onions are amazing together. I also made more sauce by upping the amounts of butter and brown sugar. THIS is my favorite recipie in the whole world. I love fall, but, this just makes it for me. Usually serve with green beans and garlic mashed potatoes. MMmmmmm.....

I somewhat followed Mrs. Sweet's directions of broiling the chops for about 5 mins on each side and making the caramel apples on the stove.  Just threw the apples, butter, brown sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon in the pan and let them cook together for about 10 mins while the chops were cooking.  I sprinkled both sides of the chops with the salt and pepper and didn't use any oil (didn't need to) or pecans (didn't have any).  I spooned the apples over the chops right before serving.  This recipe is so easy and your most likely to have most of the ingredients on hand already.  I've never made pork chops with apples before, and this turned out great!  I didn't read all the reviews before I made this, pretty much made as is ingredient-wise, so next time I will double the sauce because there wasn't much.  Made with Baby Carrots with Dill Butter from this site.

These were amazing. I added a little bit of apple juice to mine to make more sauce and only used one apple, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will make sure I have enough apples on hand because this was excellent.

I made this for my wife and myself and she agrees that it deserves 5 stars.  Changes I made: 1) margarine instead of butter (I'm lactose intolerant), used about twice as much; 2) added one snack sized apple sauce to the apple/spice mix.  Fantastic recipe.

When I downsized it for only 2 chops, there didn't seem to be enough liquid for the "sauce" they mention.  The apples and pork chops turned out quite well.  Will make this again.

Not as good as I hoped. Chops would not brown well and seemed more steamed than fried. Pretty good leftover too.

This recipe had a lot of potential.  I didn't have granny smiths, so I used a different apple.  Overall it was a tad too sweet. My husband thought the cinnamon was too predominant.  I added just a touch of champagne vinager to finish the sauce and it did help to cut the sweetness a bit, but not enough.

Very tasty and you can smell the sauce throughout the house! I agree with others and need to at least double the sauce.  That is the best part.  Very easy to make and not very time consumming.  Will certainly make again! Thanks!

We are a marine corps family so when I cook I am cooking for all the boys almost every night. When I make this dish the boys love it I always make three pork chops for every one and its one of the easier recipes to cook. I love this recipe

The sauce was amazing.  My husband loved this recipe.  He is a huge apple pie fan, so that could have something to do with it.  I did marinate the chops overnight in the 2x apple juice to soy sauce mixture, so I can't say how it would've turned out without it, but the chops were nice and juicy.  Served with white rice and green beans.  Would be good with a baked sweet potato as well.

my husband and I loved this recipe.  I did however take the advice of other users and marinated the chops first.  And I cooked them about 30 minutes longer at about 300 degrees.  FABULOUS!

My boyfriend and I enjoyed these, but they're a bit sweet. We ate them with white rice to mellow out the acidic sweetness of the apples.

This recipe is fantastic and easy to make.  My husband and teenager loved it!  The apples work equally well on top of chicken.  Plan to make twice as many apples as you think you'll need or you'll get complaints that you didn't make enough.

I love these flavors, but I don't think it was anything special.  Tasted nice, but I will take the one reviews advice to marinate in apple juice/soy and to make more sauce. Will make again with modifications

YUMMY!  Not only was this recipe easy, but the sauce on top was SO good.  I didn't have any chops so I used pork tenderloin.  It turned out juicy and nice and sweet.  I will definately make again.

I tried this and though it was good, I thought it needed additional spices.  It was an effort to core apples, with little benefit in the end result.

The only thing I changed was to add a bit more cinnamon.

This was really good.  I doubled the sauce but left the amount of apples the same.  This made just enough sauce but next time I will make even more.  I salt and peppered the chops before browning them.

I used this as the basic recipe, but breaded the pork chops lightly and browned - I then mixed the other ingredients and put them over the pork and baked at 350 for 20-30 minutes - I also added squash to make it a one-dish meal.  The pork stays moist and it is wonderful!

Yum! I did the quick version- apple pie filling over the chops instead of slicing apples. Quick, easy and delish! 
Added brown sugar and nuts at the end as recipe says. Will make again- chops get nice and moist!

The sauce was so good, the flavors went so well with the pork.  The pork was a little dry, I might recommend putting a little of the sauce before it's reduced on the pork while it sits in the oven.  Despite the dry pork, it still gets 5 stars!  Wonderful and easy.

I only made the apple portion of this recipe to serve w/ my chops. It was great! I would say it is much like the candied apples you can buy at Boston Market, but, these are better!!!!!!

I made this for dinner last night and it was good, but nothing special. Then I had the leftovers for lunch today, and they were soo good! I was pleasantly surprised. I think I'll play around with this recipe..

Very good. Best Apple Pork Chop recipe we've tried. I was looking for a recipe that created a glaze. After trying 3 other recipes, this one was finally what I was after.

When my grandmother was very ill and wouldn't eat anything else, she ate this recipe!  Whole family loved it a great combination of flavors.  Watch the caramel sauce though and don't let it go too long or you'll have a stringy mess.  When it starts to thicken (about milkshake consistency), take it off as it cools it will thicken more.  Thank you for a GREAT recipe.  OH and if you like to use a slow cooker try throwing in all ingredients except sauce adding a little apple cider, about 1/2 to 1 C let them slow cook until done then make the sauce...yum!

I guess this is one of those recipes which reminds us we all have different tastes - unfortunately my family and I didn't find this dish to be anything special and I'll not be making it again - but it's great other people have found it to be a favorite - what makes the world go around.

My husband and I love this recipe and have shared it with family members!  I love pork chop and but husband is not a big fan.  So, I found this recipe as I wanted pork chops one night and he is hooked on this!  This is so easy and is a great weeknight meal.  The only thing is that we do not add the pecans and work best with granny smith apples.

These were pretty good.  I followed the recipe to a T with the exception of doubling the sauce.  I think I will probably make again.

I've never been a fan of cooking pork on the stovetop, they always turn out tough and dried out.  So, I made these as some reviewers have suggested and browned my pork chops on the stovetop and then transfered to a baking dish.  Meanwhile I prepared the apple mixture, then poured it over the top of the pork chops and baked in the oven.  The result was a delicious apple topping and very, very bland pork chops.  My kids ate up the apples, but the pork chops left much to be desired.  I may try again and try marinating the chops as some others have suggested.

This was pretty good. I did the stove top version suggested by others.  I would also suggest simmering the chops a little longer to tenderize the meat.

I changed the recipe some by using my slow cooker.  I put the pork chops and apples in and sprinkled them with cinnamon and nutmeg.  It made the house smell yummy.  I doubled the sauce and made just before serving.  This recipe is awesome...even my super picky boyfriend loved it.

The pork chops should be marinated beforehand to keep juicier. mellow sweet taste nice to pair with a salty veg; Garlic-Buttered green beans (recipe on site.)

Good dish, easy to make.  The sauce is very flavorful. I doubled the sauce recipe and will probably triple it next time. My pork chops turned out a little tough, so next time I think I'll bake them in the oven with some of the sauce and see how that turns out. I used boneless chops for this dish. Once the apples were tender, I thought the sauce was plenty thick enough and poured it over the warm chops. I also put salt and pepper on the chops before I put them in the hot pan.

This recipe was good, but I was expecting an amazing meal with all the wonderful reviews. First off, I thought my house was going to smell like smoke from the frying for days.  (Maybe that was my lack of judment).   But it turned out pretty good, my husband didn't complain- which is usually a great sign.  However, he did say it was lacking something. It was sweet but needed a kick to it.

I took the advice from reviewers who had baked their chops but other than that followed the recipe.  My fiance was extremely nervous about this recipe and wasn't sure he would like it.  But the pork chops came out so tender and juicy that he loved it.  He was also concerned about the flavor of the sauce in conjunction with the meat but it was relatively mild and we both agreed that it enhanced the flavor.  He's not usually a fan of fruit/meat together but this one was really good.  We would definitely make this again.

I did just as the recipe said except I doubled the sauce because I know my family.  I will triple next time.  Hubby said that this is a keeper!  He is a very picky pork chop eater.  Always wants it just like his Mama made them, fried, and lots of apple sauce.  So, I am so thrilled!  :) Thanks

The flavor in this dish was phenomenal!  I used Braeburn apples, Saigon cinnamon and fresh ground nutmeg.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Even my husband. Mr. Picky, thought it was "edible," which equals a 4-star review for normal people.  He's not a cooked fruit fan - but he did like the combo of the apples with the pork chops.  My only complaints is I didn't really have any "sauce" to drizzle on top - but it was so good, the dish didn't really need it!

Let covered chops simmer about 25 min before moving to the oven.  My family really liked this recipe.  Perfect fall comfort food and will be adding this into our rotation.  Thank you for sharing.

Loved this recipe with granny smith apples. I substituted mace for the nutmeg and that was nice too.  Definitely use a cast iron skillet to make this - it gives the chops a nice finish.

I'd make this again.  The flavors blended very well together & it was extremely easy to make.  My 2 & 4 year olds ate every last bite.  Always a bonus!!!  I made it with steamed broccoli and next time adding cheesey mac casserole.

This was a great change to making pork chops.  Everybody loved it, especially the apples!  The kids love the apples!  I may add extra next time. The pork chops were very tender and moist. Definitely a keeper!

Our chops were pretty thick so we had to increase the oven temperature to finish them off in the oven. Also we had to add another few table spoons of butter to have enough sauce. But overall it's a great recipe and we will definitely make it again.

My husband and I just didn't really like these! I don't know why they called for thick cut chops. They took forever to cook and by the time the center was finished cooking the outside was tough. Maybe I just don't like apples on pork chops!

This was fan-freakin-tastic!!! I doubled the sauce like the others suggested. I didn't add the nuts or the nutmeg b/c I didn't have it. I sauteed the chops with sliced onions and it was really good. The consistancy of the sauce wasen't quite right, but I think that had more to do with me being a bad cook than with the recipe! I will definatley make this again!!

Pork chops were dry... definitely cook with the cover on top.  Caramel sauce was not enough... needed to double it.  The apples were great, though!

I loved the flavors of this recipe, although I did saute onion with the pork initially.  It provides a nice contrast to all the sweetness in the sauce.  Also, like the other reviewers have stated, cook the brown sugar mixture long enough to thicken it.  Otherwise, it provides a very runny sauce.  I served with stuffing, and it was a big hit.

I've made this recipe twice now.  One time I added some apple juice after reading other reviews and it doesn't have the caramel flavor of the original recipe.   Next time I will follow the exact recipe for the sauce.  I also cook the pork chops in the oven on 325 for about 30 min. and they turn out very tender (I used 1 inch thick chops)

I never made pork chops before this. Once I overcooked the caramel for a large dinner party and it is a big joke how rock hard the caramel sauce got on the plate. You had to pick it up and lick it! One of my favorites.

Wow. What a wonderful recipe! It's a standby for us since it's so easy and the ingredients are something we already usually have on hand. For those who mentioned the dryness, try leaving the lid on the skillet when you cook them - it'll help keep the moisture in instead of letting it escape into the air. Also, when they're done I just put them on a plate and stick them in the microwave to stay warm. Then when everything is ready I can warm them for 30 seconds or so without drying them out.

I make lots of extra apples and sauce and use that as one of our side dishes. Then I pair the meal with a cheesy corn casserole and biscuits (put any leftover sauce on the biscuits for a sweet treat - yum!)

My husband and I both enjoyed this.  After reading the reviews, I seasoned the pork chops with seasoning salt and pepper and added onions to the pork as it cooked.  I didn't leave them in the oven like the recipe suggested, as I was afraid it would dry them out.  Instead, I added them back to the pan with the sauce to warm before serving.  Great sprinkled with the crushed pecans.

I don't think these pork chops were anything to get excited about. They were tough and lacking in flavor. I simmered them in apple juice, as recommended by other reviewers, and the sugar in the juice just ended up scorching my pan.  I will not be making these again.

This was wonderful!  We used 3 thicker pork chops (about 1 - 1/2 inch thick). 

Following the recipe as it is, is perfect.  We'll definitely make it again.  It's a good way to change up pork, without using condensed canned soups.

This dish is great.  I did as pps recommended and browned the chops for 5 minutes.  For the sauce I used 1/2 cup butter, 2 cups brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg.  I think I'll cut down on the brown sugar just a bit next time. I sauted the apples in the sauce for about 5 minutes and poured it over the chops and baked @ 350 covered for 30 mintues.  
My husband said its something he'd expect to get at a resturant!

Great recipe!  I doubled the sauce and it turned out perfect, and I was out of pecans so I used Crushed Walnuts.  No one in the family usually likes pork chops but this was a hit.  My husband said would definetly eat again and thought it looked like something from a fancy restaurant.

I thought the recipe would knock my socks off. I was disapointed.  The sauce was not as thick as I would of liked it. Maybe I will add a little corn starch next time. It was ok.

WOW! I loved this recipe and will absolutely make again and again. Just the smell it put through the house was worth it!I also tripled the sauce and had LOTS for pouring on the chops. I served it with baked yams and buttered green beans.

OK!  These were very good but i think that I will make some changes next time!
1st I think I will bake these in the sauce and let them cook like that it seems that they dry out oo much by trying to fry them.  I will do it agian that way.

We found this delicious.  I tripled the sauce and added ginger and just a dash of ground gloves.  Also put it in the oven like other reviewers.  I served this with greenbeans and herb stuffing with cranberries and toasted walnuts mixed in.

Not bad, but not the best pork chop recipe I've tried either.  My husband didn't like it much either.  I think grilling the chops first might add some flavor.

This was great we really enjoyed it.  I did triple the sauce at teh suggestion of some of the other reviewers.  THis also tasted wonderful the next day reheated after the loin chops sat in the fridge in the sauce all night.
It smells wonderful while cooking.  I made this with potato pancakes and a little applesauce on teh side.  Even my finicky 4 year old liked it
I did marinate my chops in a little Italian dressing just to ensure they wouldn't be dry.
Will definitely make this again.

YUM!  I served this with sweet potatoes and topped the chops and potatoes with the apples and sauce, which I tripled as some other reviewers suggested.  I used salted butter and didn't have any pecans, yet a very excellent dish.  My favorite part is that it uses very common (assuming you have your spice rack well stocked) ingredients.  Oh, I also added a little ginger and cloves to the  sauce.

A lot better than I had expected, but I ended up overcarmelized the caramel.  If you have to tend to children while making this meal, you'd better hope that it happens during another step.  I had a whole tablespoon (if I were lucky) of caramel as an end result.  Great nonetheless.

These were good.  I accidentally combined the apples, butter and sauce ingredients all at the same time into the pot instead of realizing the apples were to cook separately - but it didn't seeem to matter, and saved some time!  This was a quick tasty meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was really good...the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I couldn't get the sauce to thicken at the end.  I loved the sauce anyway, though, and I didn't even have any pecans.  I will definitely make this again.

this turned out fabulous. My only problem was the side dishes. I couldn't think of the perfect side dish so I made Garlic red mashed ppotatoes and mixed veggies. I will keep searching for a perfect accenting dish.

Best pork chip recipe ever!  My kids love this meal.  Do double or triple the sauce.  Goes great with mashed potatoes.

This is an easy way to dress up pork chops that tastes great.  I also like it because you don't need a bunch of special ingredients.

This is very good.  I used 6 thin chops and was afraid they would dry out so I added some water to the pan as I sauteed the meat - it seemed to prevent dryness.  I was a bit leery about the brown sugar but it wasn't overly sweet at all.  I used Granny Smith apples and had no problem with the sauce thickening.  Will definitely make again.

Good sauce and topping for the chops but, the chops were kind of dry thin chops will be less dry i think. Make sure you buy a good cut of chops for this recipe and also season them because they did taste kind of bland.

Really heart-warming. Didn't get five stars b/c I couldn't get the sauce to firm up. Still good though.  Added the pecans + that was nice. Fixed w/ a side of baked sweet potatoes.

This recipe is delicious, extremely easy, and fast.
I added the pecans to sauce before reducing. I also adjusted the brown sugar to suit, bacause the Granny Smith apples were very tart.

This was very good.  Per other reviewers suggestions, I doubled the sauce.  My husband said I had outdone myself.  Personnally, I think pork cutlets, lightly breaded and sauteed  would be much better.  The chops were a little bland and dry, and that was after seasoning and grilling.  I recently tried the apple mixture from this reciple as a topping for "Marinated Pork Tenderloin" and it was an excellent combination - better than the plain pork chops called for in this recipe.  Try it!

this was great, I'm not a kitchen guru by any means, but I've had to do all the cooking lately - this was so simple. I did cook the porkchops and the apples aon the stove at the same time so the oven wasn't really necessary -but could see why it would be a nice option to have

Very good sauce! We grilled the pork chops outside and I cooked the sauce as the husband manned the grill. We both got done around the same time and added everything together at once. The sauce definetly makes this meal.

I am an average cook who started liking
to cook at about age 13. I just made 
this recipe by Karena and let me tell
you, my girlfriend said "it was to die
for". She said this is on top of my
dinners to make.  This was a great meal
and thanks for sharing this recipe. I
told my girlfriend that the apples and
sauce would be great with french vanilla
ice cream. I may try that soon. I know
this will definitely be passed to my 
mother.

I didn't have nutmeg so I was forced to use pumpkin pie spice --- because of that it turned out bland - I was hoping for more UMPH. 

The pork chops were VERY TENDER ... I'm sure the poor reviews were due to thin chops - not the recipie. 

I may may try adding a bit of horseraddish next time ...

The sauce had a good sweet flavour, I trippled the sauce as people mentioned, but the chops were too dry, might try to BBQ the chops next time or using a marinade first of some kind to make the chops a little more tender.

This recipe was excellent -- I made just just two small changes. 1.) Extra sauce! The sauce is the best part. 2.) I added a  splash of balsamic vinegar to the sauce at the end to cut the sweetness just a little. Awesome!

This was pretty good. You really need to double the sauce tho. I also marinated the chops in some Worc. sauce and cooked them on the grill first.

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the tanginess of the dish. The spice combination could be played with a little for individual taste but overall, it's both easy and delicious!

This is a very nice change of pace for serving porckchops.  My whole family liked it.  I would have served it with a tart cranberry dressing on the side.

I made this last night and was very pleased. These were very good, although I did have to add a little water while cooking the apples.  For the time and effort (SUPER quick and easy) I would definately recommend!  I served these with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans, which were great with it.  Definately double the sauce as recommended by others.

Pretty good. My guy liked it, and I plan on making this dish again in the future.  I didn't shove my pork loin in the oven, rather cooked until done and let them rest while I got the sauce cooking.

We liked this recipe very much. I did double the sauce amount and added more brown sugar. I decided to use the salt and pepper on the chops themselves. Overall a recipe I will do again.

Quite good. Cooked apples (used Fuji) tasted sweet and delicious, almost like pie filling. Added 1/4 cup chicken stock to apple mixture for more liquid. Wanted to slow cook chops in the oven with moist heat, but it dried it out. Served with sugar snap peas & buckwheat/kasha, still quite tasty.

I was excited to make this dish because it was different.  My boyfriend whom dislikes applesauce enjoyed the apples/caramel sauce on top of the pork. I served this dish with sugar snap peas, chicken and brocolli rice-a-roni and dinner rolls.

This was my first time looking at this website. This recipe was AWESOME! The best part was that I had make the pork chops the night before, and wanted something different to try with them. I had the ingredients handy and just heated the pork chops slowly like the directions said. Can't wait to try more recipes frmo this site. Thanks!

This was ok.  I doubled the sauce and still could have used more.  The pork chops need to have more flavor on there own.

I doubled the sauce as suggested by numerous reviews and used Granny Smith apples.  I also thickened the sauce with 2 T. cornstarch mixed with 2 T. water and served over egg noodles.  The apple compliments the pork very well.  We enjoyed it.

These were really yummy.  Hubby, who is the ultimate food critic, licked his plate clean, so to speak.  Next time I think I'll add raisins for a twist.  I did triple the amount of sauce and it was the perfect amount.

Super flavor!  This was second time I prepared this dish for a dinner party and everyone was thrilled.  Definitely allow for additional sauce the recipe as written does not make enough.  Served over horseradish flavored mash potatoes!  Yum!

I love this recipe. The pork comes out very moist and flavorful, and the apples are sweet and tender. It's almost more like a dessert, actually.

These were delicious and they were very easy to make.  Just take extra care not to overcook the pork chops.

This is a fantastic recipe!!!  My girlfriend and I are pretty hard to please with new recipes but this one is great.  The sauce and the apples give the pork chops a very nice flavor.  It's relatively simple to make and we ingredients are basic so most people will have them in the cupboard.  We will definitely make this recipe again.

My husband loved these pork chops!!! I am a vegetarian, so he got to devour them all! Plus, he has leftovers for lunch. He says they were absolutely delicious, sweet and tender! Thanks for a great recipe. We will use it again!

I doubled the apples and quadrupled the sauce.  It was very, very good.  I had company and a total of 5 kids.  No complaints.  I will definately be making this again.

These were great! They were so simple, but my fussy fiance loved them.

If you have leftovers, just heat them up. We used them in a spaghetti sauce and that was a mistake. The pork really takes on the apple flavor.

I personally thought this was a very good tasting and easy to prepare recipe. My husband ate it but wasn't very impressed. My children were about as impressed as my husband was! If I knew they would eat it, I would definately make it again! It was great!

My husband, who usually doesn't care for pork, enjoyed this recipe. The only thing we would probably do different next time is thicken the sauce quite a bit. Otherwise, a fun and yummy meal.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful, however, I needed more sauce, which I made.  I also sauted the apple peels with pecans in the sauce until they were soft, and placed them on top of the pork chops, just before I poured the sauce on.  They were sooo pretty!  My boyfriend was quite impressed, and he hates anything "weird," which usually translates to 'new and different.'  That's why I rated it a 5 on kid-friendly, as he is as picky as a kid.  Thanks allrecipes.com for saving my supper!

This recipe was great!  It has a great fall smell from the nutmeg.  I used Granny Smith apples and cooked the pork a little longer.  I also doubled the sauce.  There were no leftovers.  My husband doesn't like sweet stuff, but loved this.

I am a "beginner" cook, but this recipe was easy to follow and got raves from my boyfriend.  I used butterfly pork chops, and I had to brown them longer than the recipe stated.  But, since I only made 2 chops, and had plenty of sauce leftover.  I will definitely try this recipe again!

Agreed with another reviewer in that I could see myself making this once a year or so for a change in the fall...but not on a regular basis.  My husband and I enjoyed it well enough the other night, but it may have been a bit too sweet for our taste.

I made this for my pastor's family, and they loved it!  The youngest child is 12, and she loved it, too, so I guess it's kid friendly, didn't know how else to rate it, since we don't have any of our own!  This goes great with the Harvest Thyme Rice on this site!

These pork chops were the best I've ever tasted!  They were juicy, and the sauce was delicious!  Anyone who gives this dish a bad rating, must have screwed up while cooking.  
I recommend dicing the apples instead of slicing them.

For some reason the sugar/butter mixture (caramel) turned hard as a rock before anyone could take a bite.  Although the pork was juicy and tender, I would not make this again.

I HATED this recipe, and so did my boyfriend. It sounded odd to begin with, but due to all the great reviews, I tried it anyway. The combination of the sauce and the pork clashed and tasted horrible.

The pork chops were so tender and tasty, and the sauce was so good we mopped it up with our bread!  Quick, easy and delicious!

I agree with everyone else - this is really a delicious meal.  My husband and kids loved it.  I also doubled the sauce recipe - which was perfect.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for this great recipe.    TIE

I went with the baking method based on other reviews but 45 minutes wasn't enough to make it fall-apart delicious which I prefer.  Also, there wasn't much flavor to the chops so I would definitely add more salt and pepper and/or other spices.  Otherwise, very good.

This recipe was not difficult but the pork chops did come out to tough.  I think in order to cook the chops throughly, you should cover them in sauce and bake them covered, so they don't dry out.

I didn't try this my self because I do not really like pork. I made it for my husband because it sounded good. It was surprisingly easy to make and was very quick! It looked very appetizing; I served it with asparagus. I served my husband and brother-in-law and they said it was pretty good. My brother-in-law said it would have been good with mashed potatoes.

This had wonderful flavor. And my kitchen smelled incredible while it was cooking. I did add twice the amount of butter and spices called for, because there wasn't enough sauce for our liking. But overall a wonderful dish that we will be making again.

These pork chops were wonderful.  I usually broil mine and they are always so dry.  These pork chops were so moist and yummy.  I have 17 yr. old twin boys and they really loved them.  My husband loved them. It is a recipe I will being using again, and again.  Thank you for the recipe Karena.

These pork chops were delicious. Apples and brown sugar go so well with pork and the flavors were wonderful and it was so easy to make. If you have any left over apples just scoop over a little vanilla ice cream!

I was disappointed w/ this dish because the pork chops were very hard.  I fried them first, and then baked them in the oven with all the other ingredients for 45 minutes covered.  The pork was as hard AS A ROCK.  The sauce was excellent and so was the apples.  I do not know what went wrong, was it the baking?  Any help is appreciated on this!!

My husband and I thought the chops were very good while my 9 yr. old son thought it was great and ate a whole chop without complaining.  I doubled the sauce (without doubling the apples) and it came out perfect.

I thought this was a good recipe, but think I'll use slightly thinner chops next time. I think mine were closer to 1" thick.  The apples and sauce were delicious served over the pork chops.  My husband loved them.

Thank goodness someone shared a recipe for pork chops that is correct for today's pork.  I'm a pork producer who has been preaching for years that browning chops until juices are clear is the correct way.  Try using Jerk seasoning for the spices or bananas also. It's a great treat.

This recipe was so delicious!  The sauce needs to be doubled, and I added the pecans to it while the sauce was thickening, which made them taste even better! I will definitely use this recipe again!!!
