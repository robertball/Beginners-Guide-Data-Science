I have to revise my review. I originally made this recipe with oatmeal intead of Grape Nuts and really liked it. I have since made it with the Grape Nuts and also like it that way. One modification I have done is cut the sugar in half and used half honey in lieu of half the corn syrup. Comes out great either with oatmeal or Grape Nuts. Oatmeal version is softer, more like a traditional Power Bar; Grape Nuts is crunchier, more like a dessert, I think. Regardless of which way they're made, they're great!

I am a tweaker, I admit it. I tweaked these because all that grape nuts sounded a little boring. I used 1 cup of grape nuts, & enough chopped walnuts, sunflower seeds & chocolate chips to make up the other 1 cup. You have to mix quickly though, the syrup mixture hardens pretty fast. These were delish!

These are so good, however I reduce the amount of karo syrup and use mostly honey in its place. I also used turbinado (raw) sugar instead, and used half oats and half grapenuts.  I sprinkled the top with chocolate chips. This is a filling and delicious snack bar, and so easy to make--better than power bars. I love this recipe. Thanks for sharing.

My family loved it. Even my toddler. Save your self some time spray your pot, and spoon with baking spray, its keeps everything from sticking and makes it easier to spread in the pan. I added some chocolate chips after putting it in the pan before it completely cooled.

Wonderful!  They tasted better than the original and cost much less. I didn't have grapenuts so I used oatmeal and fiber one cereal. Worked great.

Very good- very "peanutty"- To reduce calories, I used Splenda sugar blend (1/2 cup), reduced corn syrup by half and added 1/2 cup honey (next time I will try agave syrup since it is better for you than all of that).  Added 1/2 cup wheat germ and next time I will try to add in some protein powder and powdered milk (to increase calcium). I will also try dried cherries.  Overall my 9 and 5 year olds chowed them down as did my hubby so I like this recipe!

They are very crunchy, so watch your teeth!  I added dried cranberries, chopped peanuts, and raisins for extra boost.

Too sweet.  Serious crash after 2 hours.  Should have enough honey (NOT corn syrup) to hold together.

Nice flavor. Very "nougaty" when you add nuts and things to it. At first I thought this was "goopy" and waay to sticky, but after it cooled completely and I individually wrapped each bar in saran-wrap, I stuck it in the refrigerator... perfect. Not to hard not to soft. Make sure the bars are thin enough to bite easily! And spread that goop on wax paper sprayed with pam for easy handling and clean-up. Thanks for the recipe. And thank you reviewers for all the fun suggestions for add-ins.

YUMMMMMM These really are a good bar!! I have tried a few from this site and I like this one for it's crunchyness.. These are the changes that I made to it and they turned out FABULOUS! I used Splenda Sugar instead of Regular Sugar, 1/2 Cup Corn Syrup and 1/2 Cup Honey, The PB Stayed the same, 3 Cups Grapenuts and 3/4 Cup Chopped Dry Roasted Peanuts, and 1/4 Cup Dried Sun Maid Tropical Trio fruit! Even the hubby Loved them. Great Recipe and thanks for Sharing!

This is a very versatile recipe. I have played with the contents list including replacing the corn syrup with honey, or adding bakers chocolate to give it a chocolate flavoring, trying different combinations of cereals and such. This is a great in-between meals snack, and I use it at work since it doesn't need to be refrigerated! Great for a locker! Just put a few bars in a plastic container and you can snack on these instead of buying a cookie or other junk food snack!

I've made these bars a few times.  I followed the recipe the first time.  They were very good.  They were kind of hard, but I like that texture.  This is a very good recipe to be creative with.  The second time I made them I added some butterscotch chips.  They were very good.  I've also made them adding raisins and chocolate chips.  These were very chewy and tasted awsome!

I tried to be careful not to overcook but it was pretty hard to work with. Barely got it stirred and out of the bowl. Tastes good. Next time I might try regular peanut butter or roll it in balls.

excellent.  Best of all, they provide a noticeable, tangible energy boost--much more noticeable than the power bars bought in a store.  As can tell in submitted photo, put chocolate chips on top of a portion of the batch.  Also sprinkled entire batch lightly with ground cinnamon after taking out of oven.  Keeper, for sure.

So easy and so good! I have added some seeds (like pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, poppy seeds and hemp seeds) replacing half of dry ingredients for kids. Very versatile and yummy recipe. Thank you!

My tweaking:

didn't have corn syrup and really didn't want to use it anyway, so I substituted 1 cup of best quality honey, 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of sugar/splenda blend.  Into the cereal mix I threw some milk chocolate morsels.   

Taste results:  really, really sweet and I can taste the wildflower honey.

Texture:  they were sticky so I put them in the freezer to cut, but once frozen they didn't cut cleanly into bars but broke into pieces. 

Am wondering if my substitution of honey for corn syrup, and cutting back the white sugar by 1/4 cup, affected the texture.

This recipe is great to fill me up on my break at work. I used the oats as well. Working stock at a grocery store I have come to the conclusion that this recipe would be great for just about any cereal. Think about captain crunch or cocoa puffs or honeycomb or just about anything else you can think of. Sure it would not be as healthy, but they would make great treats.

These are so good even my kids ate them!  I give them these bars as an after school snack, and it tides them over til dinner and gives them a healthy dose of fiber, too.  Very addicting!

The cereal was just too hard.
