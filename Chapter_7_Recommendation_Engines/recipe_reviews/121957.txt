This recipe is AMAZING! Super simple and super tasty. I made it according to the recipe. I served it with taco chips, shredded cheese and sour cream. At the table we sprinkled the cheese over the soup, crumbled the chips in, and some people put a dollop of sour cream in. It was really, really great and will definitely be on our usuals list. And it only takes a few minutes to throw together!

I thought this recipe was pretty tasty. I liked the spicy kick it had. If I make this again I will add some pulled rotisserie chicken and some fresh cilantro.

This recipe is great!  I've made it many times, and each time it's a little different.  I like to substitute Rotel for one of the small cans of green chiles.  Also, instead of canned corn I use frozen corn(cheaper and better for you).  Adding a huge dollop of sour cream and some shredded sharp cheddar just before eating makes this perfect.  This was my dad's favorite on those chilly ice fishing days :)

Yummy! This soup is really great, I make it all the time. I add 1 clove of garlic instead of dried garlic, I also added 1/4 cup of onion, 1 slice of bacon, and sometimes I add carrots.

I made this recipe due to the rave reviews, and was very disappointed. I didn't change anything in the recipe, and it turned out more like I threw beans in water and added some cheap salsa. My husband wouldn't even touch it. I saved it as a filler for a future batch of chili. It seemed like it was missing something (or a lot of things), and I don't understand why it got such rave reviews. ???

Very good. The first time I made this, I only had one can of black beans and one can of kidney beans on hand. Needless to say, that's the way I make it now. It's almost like a chili. I serve it with tortilla chips, sour cream and shredded cheese and it's amazing. I use regular corn, vegetable broth, and a can of rotel instead of regular diced tomatoes. I also use the green chiles depending on my mood--in other words, they taste of the soup is not contingent on them. We also add ground beef, but both my meatloving husband and my picky, vegetarian sister concur that it's delicious without it. Easy and cheap! Love this recipe.

This soup is awesome! Easy, filling, low in fat, and delicious! What more can you ask for in a soup? I just threw everything together and cooked for about an hour, I didnt use a crockpot. It still turned out great. I served it with some cheese melted on top.

Really tasty. I messed up a little by not adding enough liquid, but I found that it resulted in a tasty side dish! So I'm using this recipe as a soup (with liquid) and as a side dish (without the liquid)!

This is a great basic recipe.  You really can't mess this up.  I used what I had, which is dried black beans, dried black-eyed peas, cherry tomatoes, vegetable broth, and fresh garlic.  I soaked my beans the night before and threw everything in the pot and it turned out wonderful.

Thought this was great and soooo easy!  I omitted the onions b/c I'm lazy and not a huge onion fan.  I also didn't have enough chili powder so I subbed half a packet of taco seasoning.  Next time I'll use 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of the stewed b/c I didn't like having huge chunks of tomato.  Put just a little shredded cheese on top and didn't think it needed any sour cream.

Honestly, I think 4 1/2 stars is more like it for us.  This was very good and so easy to make.  Actually, my 9 1/2 year old pretty much made this all on his own, that's how easy it was!  The next time we make this we want to try it served over grilled chicken.  

I also wanted to add that I ran out of time so I did this in a dutch oven on the stove top.  I brought it to a good rolling boil, and then turned it down to low and put a lid on it.  I let it simmer for about an hour.  No crock pot was needed!

Great soup!  I browned some ground turkey then added all of the ingredients to a slow cooker and let cook on low for 4 hours.  I added real minced garlic and a bit more chili powder.  Wonderful light recipe for those watching their weight.

A very pleasant surprise!  I only had 1 can of tomatoes and no chilis, so I used 2 cups of mild, chunky salsa and it turned out great!  I also used 32 oz of chicken broth, and that was perfect...  it would have been bone dry with absolutely no broth had I only used one can.  Good recipe for the family - definitely would not make for guests, as if you don't like spicyness, beans, corn or tomatoes you would definitely not like this soup!

Very tasty - impressively so for the ease of making. The only change I made was I pulsed the soup some with my immersion blender to make a creamier soup. Delicious! Next time, I'm going to use two cans of Rotel instead of one just to kick it up a notch.

This was good on a chilly fall night.  Served it with shredded cheese, sour cream and cornbread.  Could use a bit more spice, next time will add a little cayenne pepper for a little kick.

I used 2 cans of broth, for a more soup-like consistency. I opted for the low sodium because all things canned have so much sodium. I also used fresh garlic. Overall, this is healthy, easy and delicious. Good combo :-)

This recipe has amazing flavor, and also could be good will some pulled chicken as well. Mine usually turns out thick and chili-like. I love to make large batches, freeze part, and take it to work for lunch. It's fast, easy, cheap, and healthy!

Good basic recipe to add your own touches. I did half black beans and half garbanzo beans, added a small can of V-8 instead of the can of diced tomatoes, and did not add any chicken broth. I didn't use a crockpot but just simmered on the stove and ended up with a thick, delicious, and healthy soup that I served with sour cream and tortilla chips. Loved it!

I wanted to make this soup, but I had to use what was on hand- made it pretty much as stated, but started by browning minced garlic & onions in oil. Then added broth from last week's homemade chicken soup. Added the rest of the ingredients, except didn't have chili powder, so I threw in a can of chili. simmered for 20 minutes, added the celery & carrots from that leftover chicken soup, and some hot sauce- amazing! If you want it thicker, you can throw 2 cups of the soup in the blender for a second & then put back in the soup. I poured mine on a baked potato, topped with cheese, and served to my appreciative husband.

This was a really nice recipe.  I added 2 cans of Rotel in place of the chilis and the tomatoes.  I also added a cup of brown rice to the pot.  It really made it a hearty one dish meal.

This was just OK, not great. It didn't have a whole lot of flavor--it seemed to be missing something. But it was easy and healthy, and that's always a good thing.

Great recipe! Super easy to make and incredible flavor. I served it with cornbread to round out the meal. My husband loved it as well. Thanks for the recipe - I will definitely be making this one again and again!
