Very good chocolate cake!  It's definitely much better than a cake mix!  I didn't have cake flour and found that I could use  1 3/4 c. of all purpose flour and 1/4 c. of cornstarch as a substitute for the 2 cups of cake flour.  I also couldn't find Dutch process cocoa powder at the store.  It can be substituted with unsweetened cocoa.  The substitution is as follows: for every 3 TBS. of unsweetened cocoa powder, add 1/8 tsp. of baking soda.

I really loved this recipe and so did my boyfriend, his coworkers, and my clients. Yesterday, a client to whom I gave a cupcake version two weeks ago came back and raved! 

A couple of notes- the texture of this cake was interesting..very fine with concentrated flavor without being heavy. It was not the fluffy cake you'd get from a box...more refined and substantial like all the good things of an old fashioned cake combined with the moist, denseness that hinted at a flourless cake (but again, not heavy like that and not thick...like a silk texture).

I followed the recipe to a tee, except that I substituted hot, very strong coffee for the water, and used ghiradelli unsweetened cocoa with baking soda to substitute for the dutch process cocoa (the baking soda comps for the alkali in dutch process) The use of the coffee and gourmet cocoa most likely enhanced the flavor of the cake greatly.

I used the recipe to make cupcakes baked for 39-40 minutes at the prescribed temperature. They came out perfectly..nice and springy-light.

The frosting was a lovely recipe...not too sweet, but still quite decadent. I am not much for super sweet frostings, so that affects my assessment. There was frosting left over, and my bf threatened to eat it with a spoon.

This will be one of my "secret weapon" chocolate cake recipes for sure!

I usually make a chocolate cake using a box and adding pudding but decided to try to make one from scratch this year. I have dear friends that just love a good chocolate cake. I tried this recipe and and WOW! It was melt in your mouth delicious. The frosting was nice and thick and easy to spread. I have never had frosting turn out so well. I made a two layer quarter sheet cake because the single layer looked a bit small. The two layer was a giant and perfect for Christmas dinner! It was a little time consuming to make but well worth it. I made it a day ahead and it was perfect! I can not say enough good things about this cake!

BOY HOWDY! Was this ever one of the best KNOCK-YOUR-SOX-OFF chocolate cakes. Yum Yum! Light, fluffy, moist, and soooo chocolatey (I used 2/3c cocoa in cake). Many thanks to the Pellettieres for a great cake! It WOULD be a shame to lose this one!

This cake took a long time to make but was well received by a crowd.  I thought it was too dense.

Since we share the same name as the submitters of this recipe- we had to try it! Wondering if there is some relation too! The cake was great. Very dark, and very rich. Not too hard to make. We used 2 8 1/2 inch round pans. Wonderful!

After making this cake a second time and following the directions to the letter(with the slight exception of adding a 1/4 cup more dutch processed cocoa to the batter)I still have to say this is THE BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE I HAVE EVER HAD. I love it without the frosting, but with a layer of it, it's over the top chocolatey. WOW, am I glad I have this recipe. Some people have remarked about the 300 degree temperature. Trust me, if your oven is accurate it turns out perfect. ENJOY.

This cake tasted sinful.  It was very moist and rich.  I used it to make a four layer cake for my husband's college graduation party and everyone requested to take home the leftovers.

I must say, the cake IS worth the effort of making it.  It was very moist and had a good rich chocolate flavor.  I would make it again.

I didn't like the way this cake tasted at all. The frosting was too cocoa tasting and the cake was a dry texture.

Tastes Like dark chocolate. I was hoping for it to rise more than it did. I Used Hershey's Cocoa and was told it was dutch process. Still not sure about that. The frosting was really rich and also tasted like Dark Chocolate as well. I Followed the recipe to the letter but dont know if I did everything right. It still turned out pretty good. I will try to perfect it next time

This cake was awesome!  I was so tired of the weird taste that boxed cakes have, so I decided to try this one.  I highly recommend using cake flour as the recipe indicates.  This flour makes the cake so light and delicate.  I used a buttercream frosting the first time.  However, I can't wait to try the La Famiglia Chocolate Frosting that's included with the recipe.

I loved this cake, but my husband thought it was a little too rich.  I was surprised that the icing didn't harden.  Maybe not as much milk next time.

Delicious!  I made this in two 9-inch round pans instead of the 13 x 9 one, and they turned out perfectly.  They were done in less than 50 minutes, too.  I swear, this is the best chocolate cake I have ever had, and the frosting rocked, too!

delicious! Cooking time was longer then stated. I used 1 3/4 AP flour and the cake was moist like a pudding cake. Not dense or heavy at all. I followed the recipe as written except the flour and there was lots of flavor. Rich and chocolaty.The frosting is the finishing touch to this cake. My Husband says the strawberries I used to decorate the cake with just put it over the top.

Truly a lovely cake recipe!  Dense enough for cupcakes (which was my use) and sweet enough to need just a sprinkle of powdered sugar.

I used the recipe for the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting on Allrecipes instead of the included recipe here, as suggested by a reviewer on the frosting link.  What a fantastic combination!  An incredible, moist, dense cake.  A little more labor intensive than I'm used to with a cake box mix, but well worth the effort.  No too sweet, but luscious! I made this for my husband's birthday, and we're still nibbling on it 2 days later. Yum yum!

This cake is so good! I was looking for a cake with the richness and density of cakes made with butter, and the moistness of cakes made with oil. This is it, so rich, dense and moist! I wondered about the cooking time/temp, but it was spot on in my oven. I did replace the boiling water with hot brewed coffee, because I always do that with chocolate cakes that call for boiling water, it deepens the chocolate flavor, and I threw in maybe a 1/4 tsp salt, because it seemed strange to me to havea recipe without it, although I don't know if that changed much or not. I used the Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe on this site, which looks very similar to the one given here, but we love that one so much I had to use it.

The only reason I wouldn't give this a 5 star is that it is VERY chocolatey.  I loved it, but it was too rich for some.  It really is like a brownie with icing!  Chocolate lovers rejoice!

This recipe is awesome!!! I've been making it for over 5 years and everyone loves it.  My mom even loves it and she is not a big chocolate fan.  I've given the recipe to people and always tell them not to change a thing, or else...  The frosting even comes out great and I failed frosting 101.  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

This was only okay. I had to add extra butter to get it to cream properly. The cake was very moist, but not very chocolatey or flavorful.

The first time I made this cake I noticed 3 eggs sitting on the countertop as I bant to put the cake inthe oven.  OOPS!  Anyway, it was hard to scarpe out of the pan, but iced with a chocolate and cream cheese frosting, it was the best cake I've ever had.  My egg-allergic friend was very excited.  Next time I used one of the eggs to hold it together a bit better, and it has a slightly brownie-ish consistency.  Yes!  The best chocolate cake EVER.  :)  I haven't used the icing included in the recipe.

Excellent and moist.  I made it with no icing, replaced the boiling water with strong, hot coffee and made large cupcakes (baked for 40 minutes).  My husband says the tops are the best things ever.

This cake was so delicious! Tasted super chocolaty and the frosting was very good! Plus the cake itself had a very nice consistency - a bit creamy-like and fluffy. Would definitely do it some other time, too. I'm pretty sure that's my new favorite chocolate cake. Plus it was pretty easy to make.

After trying this recipe once, it became my go-to chocolate cake recipe. Very moist, almost mousse-like. Follow the directions exactly and you can't fail. Fantastic recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Surprisingly dense!  I had some concerns about how it would taste... it was amazing!  I loved the flavor and "mouth feel".  Probably the best chocolate cake I've ever had.  Used a cream cheese frosting instead of the icing listed.  So good.

Loved this.  I too added the almond flavoring to both the batter and frosting and baked them as cupcakes.  They were very moist!  Since I was making them close to Valentine's Day, I topped them each with a strawberry sliced and fanned out a bit.  They were worth the work and the extra dishes it took to make them.

Very moist, somewhat tasty cake. Didn't care much for the flavor of the Dutch process cocoa (I finally found it in my local bulk food store...labeled as "pure alkalized cocoa.") Too mild a taste for my liking, and the texture was less than great. Next time will try substituting all-purpose flour & regular cocoa (Joyofbaking.com/cocoa says to use baking soda with this kind of cocoa, and baking powder with regular so I'll probably have to substitute baking soda with the powder too).

I'm not sure what the texture is supposed to be like with this recipe, but mine turned out more like a brownie than a cake.  The guys at work thought it was great, but I wasn't impressed.  I don't think it's worth the time or the dirty dishes it takes to prepare this cake.  I will not be saving this recipe.

This took about 1hr 20min to bake but my goodness it was worth the wait.  As I was in a hurry to take it to a friends for dinner I didn't make the frosting, instead at her place I made some homemade hot chocolate sauce and served with freshly whipped cream and strawberries - yummo! The guys (who usually dont eat dessert) came back for 2nds.  Would recommend this cake to everyone, thanks for the recipe :)

This one is rich! I made this is 2 8 inch round pans. I then cut those layers in half so I had a total of 4 layers. I frosted between all those layers and the rest of the cake...I could have used just a touch more frosting doing it this way but I worked with what I had and covered the bottom with sliced strawberries and whipped cream. I also garnished it with mint leaves for presentation and I stored this in the fridge since it was accompanied with the fruit and cream which made this even better! You won't need a big piece to get your chocolate fix! This was the ending to my italian themed dinner night....everyone loved it!

A long mixing process combined with a long cooking time for so so results. Not worth it. I always forget something when there is a long drawn out mixing of the ingredients. This time I forgot the vanilla. Too many dirty dishes for me.

I just needed an icing recipe using Dutch Cocoa and I used this icing recipe.  The flavor of the icing was delish, but it was a bit runny-when dealt lemons, make lemonade!  I just drizzled it on my bundt cake and it was fine.  Good flavor.

This cake was AWFUL.  The icing was runny and the cake was hard and not tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly and to my dismay, it came out nothing like the other reviews stated.
