This was really good and just what I was looking for.  The only thing that I did differently is when I bolied my chicken I added onion powder, garlic powder and some salt.  I also added just a small pinch of Oregano to the soup when I added in the salt & pepper.

This is my all time favorite soup. It's exactly the way my yiayia taught me how to make it when I was a young girl. It's now my nephew's favorite soup and he asks for it all the time. I wouldn't change a thing. If you are short on time, use a pressure cooker to cook the chicken. I also use chicken leg quarters and skim the fat that rises to the top.

This is one of my favorites. My guests have be thrilled when I've served this refreshing soup!

A few tips - to get more juice from the lemons, microwave them whole for 10 seconds before squeezing them. 

I always garnish this soup with nutmeg.

You also can cook and shred boneless chicken breasts if that's more convenient.

My favorite soup!  But if you really want to do it right...use orzo instead of rice.  My mom used to make it both ways and the orzo way is much better IMHO.

This is exactly like my Greek friend, Maria, makes this soup. It's OK, but not quite to my liking. I need stronger flavours. So, here's what I did (for those that need that extra punch in a soup).

I used a whole chicken, put it in a large pot, added just enough water to cover the chicken (a bit of the chicken was still above the water. This makes a stronger tasting broth).

I added 3 carrots, 3 stalks of celery, a whole onion, a few garlic cloves, a parsnip, salt AND 4 packets of chicken bouillion. I simmered on low about 1 1/2 hours. Strained the broth, chopped up the chicken, saved the cooked veggies to eat later, and followed the recipe for the rest. 

It's such a refeshingly clear tasting soup. Never be afraid to alter a recipe. What's posted is one person's taste buds speaking and we're all different. Taste as you go... that's my rule.

Enjoy.

I'd suggest you cut back on the lemon to half, then taste and add more if you need it.

It's not the best Avgolemono I've ever had but it's the best I've ever made. There is a Greek restaurant in my city that has the best avgolemono soup but I wanted to try to make it because it's so easy and cheap to make. It only cost me $10.00 to make this and that included bread for dipping in the soup, plus it made a lot so I have some in my freezer. Next time I'll add more rice and more lemon. I'll also add carrot, onion and celery to the water when boiling the chicken to made more of a broth.

My mom boils chicken for 2 hours. Also, at the step of beating the eggs with lemon juice, add 1.5 heaping TBSP of cornstarch. Beat with lemon juice and eggs. Continue with the ladeling to heat up the egg and lemon mix. My mom also adds just a bit more lemon for my husband.

I love lemon with chicken and I think I make killer chicken stock from scratch that has tons of flavor..& I love trying new things!  I've never had Greek lemon soup before and I guess it's just not my thing.  Maybe it's an acquired taste? I kept wanting to, I don't know, ....add salt? (no, it was salted right) ....add cream? (no, the egg makes it creamy) The only way I could enjoy the meal was to take a bite of something else to break it up a little.  There's something about how the egg and the strong lemon taste overwhelm your mouth that made me feel like I was eating something from another culture, that I would have had to grow up with to love. (like hagus, or eskimo ice cream)  If you have a raw chicken staring at you asking "So whaddaya wanna do?"....find another recipe.  If you like greek lemon soup...it had plenty of flavor.

This soup had a very unique taste! I found it difficult to skim all the chicken fat, and for that reason I think my soup had too much of an "oily" texture. I loved the lemon taste though, and will definitely make this again! I served this at a staff meeting and those brave enough to try something new really enjoyed it!

This is the first time I've tried making it and I was worried about tempering the eggs wrong and ending up with scrambled eggs in my soup! The end result was a thickened beautiful soup. The only reason it got three stars was I juiced the lemons and put it in without tasting it...I think my lemons were not good or it was too much juice because it was way too tart. will start with one lemon then maybe add another :) was still yummy

This soup had a great flavor, but mine turned out too watery.  I'll use less water and perhaps more rice in the future.

It was okay.  Good soup, but nothing special.  I grew up eating Avgolemono soup (I'm Greek), and this definitely didn't recreate that experience.

We loved this recipe. It was as good as any I have had in a restaurant. For ease, we used 3 cans of chicken broth and 4 boneless chicken breasts cubed(sorry purists) instead of boiling the whole chicken.

Super delicious. I like a lot of lemon, but if you are not a giant lemon fan 1-1.5 might be enough. Lots of black fresh cracked pepper is a must.

The 1st time I had this soup was probably 30 years ago at a local restaurant that was run by a Greek gentleman who was known locally for the great steaks and salad dressing.  I fell in love with this soup and this recipe is right on.  Must use fresh lemons for that light citrusy taste.  This is yummy!

Really yummy. I didn't have a whole chicken so I used 4 bone-in chicken thighs, and used less water and rice. Still used 2 lemons but only 2 eggs. Very tasty and tangy - next time I'll use 3 eggs. The only thing I messed up was not adding enough broth SLOWLY to the lemon-egg mixture, before mixing it in with the rest of the soup. As a result, the egg white cooked and was left floating around in little chunks. Not pretty, but it tasted just fine!

Excellent avgolemono! My husband LOVES it! He'd never had it before I made it using this recipe, and it's spoiled him. He's tried it elsewhere and it's nowhere near as good. My only variation is the chicken. We buy a rotisserie chicken from big-box store. After having chicken the first night, we pull almost all of the chicken off the bones and save it for leftovers. I use the bones to make stock, using mirepoix & spices. Then the next day, I heat the stock, and continue with the recipe as written. I chop some of the leftover chicken and add it back into the soup at the last minute so it doesn't dry out. Fabulous!

This is the only (and best) recipe on the internet for traditional Greek chicken lemon soup - without all the extras- and it's delicious. My yaya use to make it for me when I was a small girl and then so did my mother. This soup is warming and good for the soul - perfect for a cold night or if you're not feeling well. ** If you ate this as a small Greek child it will bring back many happy memories - I'm sure! ** Thanks for sharing this recipe. Sometimes I forget about egg/ broth mixture at the end so I use this recipe to remind me to do it carefully. 
Finally I have signed up and rated! 5 stars.

This recipe is dead on as far as authenticity goes. However I have a few tips...First, only use a glass bowl to beat your eggs in so you get the frothy consistency needed for the creaminess. Also, I like to add a little cornstarch (very little) for a little extra thickness. If you feel your soup is lacking in flavor, you may want to use chicken broth or stock to boil your chicken in. P.S., if you want to get a bit creative but stay true to the original recipe, try garnishing with fresh chives ;)  kali orexi!

This recipe is so simple and it comes out so yummy.  I used three lemons though.  I will definitely make this again.

Really good.  Careful with the lemon... 2 was pretty strong.  Had to dilute with chicken broth and a couple more eggs.  Try one, then add the second if necessary.

Simply delicious! Only thing I would have changed, would be buy a better chicken. I had to use a tiny bit of boullioun because of a bland bird. Ratios and method are flawless.

Delicious, but too creamy for my liking, but very hearty and perfect for a cold day. I used a sodium free bouillion which was nice. I added in fresh chopped parsley and lemon slices to add extra flavour.

Avyolemono is my favorite soup and we love it lemony. Even my boyfriend who has no Greek in him at all, loves it extra lemony. I use usually make 2 large pans at a time (they don't last long), I actually use a whole cup of lemon per pan, and I shred the chicken breasts into the soup. I have tried both Orzo and regular rice. My sister makes both kinds every Easter, and I prefer the regular rice. My favorite rice is the Uncle Ben's Converted rice.

This ended up being less flavorful than I expected.  It wasn't bad, it just felt like it needed more spice.

This was an amazing, nourishing, completely satisfying lunch for me....loved it!  I didn't have a whole chicken, so I made the following substitutions: 1) used four cups chicken broth 2) added 1/2 tsp garlic 3) added 1/2 tsp onion powder 3) added 1/4 tsp dried Rosemary 4) subbed 1/4 cup uncooked Orzo for the rice 5) added a handful of finely diced chicken breast for additional protein 6) subbed 3 teaspoons fresh lemon juice for the two lemons. I shared the leftovers with my picky kids when they got home from school...they REALLY liked it and gobbled up the leftovers. Thx for the wonderful recipe dimitra!

Greek Soup is delicious!  Forget the chicken and buy some Turkey Necks, cook until you can pull the meat off of the bones. 
Do your eggs and lemon juice in your blender and keep it twirling slowly adding the hot broth to the blender until your blender is full then slowly pour it into the hot broth in your pot.
and stir it very good so that it does not curdle...
Just my opinion that the turkey neck meat far surpasses the cooked chicken.... and I also bake some chicken thighs anyway you like served with potatoes, vegetables anything you like..and there you have a meal after your delicious soup. It's really not difficult after you do it once....Yes it needs salt....

Excellent and very easy.  Used 10 thighs for the chicken.  2 cups of stock substituted for 2 cups of water.  Used one lemon, one and one-half might have been better.  Black, white and red pepper.  Also used short Italian rice instead of long.  Can easily make more rice and add after the soup is cooked.

Very tasty. Make sure to fully beat the egg and lemon, and follow directions to slowly ladle broth into egg mixture to avoid scrambled egg bits in your soup. Good recipe, thanks.

Excellent favors and very lemony! I added a some garlic powder when cooking the chicken, but don't know if it really needed it. I also used two leg/thigh quarters instead of an entire chicken, because I bought the wrong thing. Ha! A good mistake as it tastes so good. I will do this one again for sure!

Hi, When I make my chicken stock, I always make the day before. I do take the chicken out of pot and then when the broth cools I put in the refrig. and the next day I skim the fat off the top and then make the soup. I do like my soup more brothie, then I do the rest, but make my rice on the side so it does not get so starchy also. I never cook the rice in broth. I always add at the end when I make the egg and lemon mixture in the broth, but that's me. I just love the broth, lemon and egg mixture and a little of rice. I love the broth of the soup and I always add more lemon. Love it.

I used 5 bone-in chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken since I prefer chicken breasts.  But, this is really great!  A blond soup like this needs a good grind of black pepper.  Leftovers were a little thick, easy to thin with a bit of chicken broth.

Yummy!  I used the author's advice that this soup should be filling, salty and slightly sour and that's just how it came out.  My husband's jaw is broken and presently wired shut, and I was looking for filling and protein-rich soups.  The added eggs were just the thing.  I did use orzo instead of rice as I have found rice just doesn't go through the blender very well.

use fresh produce wisely - taste as you go along.  My lemons were extra tart and overpowering for the kids.  Otherwise a great soup.

This is just what I was looking for.  My family loved it.  I made my usual stock (which includes onion, carrot & celery) and because I had 12 cups of stock, I doubled the rice and added a third lemon.  Yummy.

this is my all time favorite soup! i remember my mom making it since when i was little and now i'm making it and friends and family love it! the only difference is that mom used to throw in there a couple of carrots, a small parsley root and a small parsnip (everything cut in small dices). and it took me years to actually learn to make it, because when i had my mom near me she would do it, but now that we're a world apart it was my turn. :-) and i absolutely love it! the lemony taste and the thickness from the eggs... for me it is the perfect soup! (and i'm not greek!)

This was good, and similar but not quite the same as the soup I've had in Greek restaurants. The broth seemed too thin even though I was careful not to use too much water. I will probably make this again, but next time I'll use just half the chicken recommended, and sprinkle some fresh parsley on top right before serving.

Absolutely delicious as written! Season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice to suit your palate, as the recipe describes, and add a little extra rice at your discretion depending on the amount of broth that is made, and this is wonderful!

I think this is a good recipe that may be too heavy on the lemon for those not accustomed to Avgolemono except that which is served at some restaurants--which in my opinion can be a little light on the lemon.  At our house, no part of the chicken is welcome except the breast, so I just used boneless, skinless chicken breast which I seasoned with salt and a lot of black pepper before cooking with the broth and I return it to the soup after shredding.  Having a Greek spouse, I don't shy away from salt, black pepper or lemon and even serve with additional on the side.  If this recipe is too lemony for you, I'd add more broth and/or more rice to tone it down.

One of my favorite soups ever! I used chicken breasts and added some bone broth to it and it still came out great! Will make again!

Simple and amazing. My best advice is to use all chicken legs for ease and add 1/2 cup more rice for a total of 1 cup.

This was really good. The end result was way too thick for a soup but I'm thinking it's an experience thing. I didn't have enough broth to start with after the chicken was removed and  that was the main issue.... I added celery, carrot, onion, garlic, and a parsnip for a heartier broth....which was fabulous! I cut back on the orzo (replaced rice per reviews), lemon and even the egg to hopefully accommodate the liquid.  With only having about 2 cups of stock left in the pot I should have used 1 egg and maybe 1/8 cup starch (or even cook separate) and prob 1  lemon... maybe a bit more....just depending. The taste was great but when I thinned it out the party was gone. I will definitely have to try this again!!!

This was so easy to make! The lemon adds so much depth to the stock! I  personally cut my white rice to 1/4 of a cup to control and not be tempted by the amount of carbs added. This is a great protein dish and will be making it again and again!!

This is my all time favorite soup! The texture the egg gives it is simple to die for. It’s so creamy and almost custardy the way it coats the spoon and the inside of your mouth. This recipe is fantastic on its own, but also great for adapting to your own personal taste (even if that takes away from its authenticity). Sometimes I’ll add carrots and celery if I have them on hand just to add a bit more substance. I also like to add just a little oregano, basil, and garlic to give it that herby kick. The lemon is definitely adjustable if you want more or less tang (I’m a lemon fiend, so sometimes I add more). Ultimately though, this recipe is delicious without any alterations. It’s a great quick weeknight recipe if you use premade chicken stock, or have some homemade in the freezer. If you’re going that route, roasting a couple of chicken breasts or thighs in the oven and shredding it in at the end is fantastic. I even once made this with leftover Thanksgiving turkey! If you love creamy, lemony soups, definitely give this soup a try!

I used this as a starter recipe. I did not want to boil the chicken, so I sauteed some chicken thighs in garlic and onion before I started. I used 2 qts of chicken broth after I removed the chicken from the stock pot. I also have used orzo instead of rice.

The trick to this recipe is the process of slowly warming the egg lemon mixture with a few scoops of hot broth so the egg whites do not curdle in the soup. After the rice or orzo is done, I killed the heat and then slowly added slightly cooled broth to the lemon egg mixture. After the bowl was warm the eggs could be dropped into the rest of the broth and no white curdling at all. I used 5 eggs instead of 3, and 3 lemons instead of 2. If the lemons are a little sharp, I suggest adding a few pats of butter to the soup toward the end of cooking.

Not sure where this went wrong. Definately didn’t taste like the one I get at the Greek restaurant near me. The chicken tasted horrible- no flavor at all. It all got thrown out. Won’t be making again.

I loved this soup!  Much milder lemon flavor than I had expected after reading the reviews indicating it was too much.  Next time, I will likely use more than 2 lemons.  I used brown rice instead of white and, other than it needing to cook a little longer, it worked fine.  My market did not have any  small chickens, so I used 3-4 pounds of breasts and legs with bones and skin.  I will be making this often!

Second time around for me with this soup and it came out delicious!  I ended up using shredded chicken breasts in place of the whole chicken but it didn’t hurt the taste.  One of my all-time favorite recipes!

I love this soup! It has just the perfect amount of lemon in it, and I do warm  the lemons  (cut in half)in the microwave for about 20 seconds to get the maximum amount of juice. I use orzo pasta instead of rice which I think is absolutely necessary for authenticity. Sometimes I use a rotisserie chicken and frozen leftover homemade  broth - even turkey works well-  which makes it super easy to make!

I decided to try a new Avgolemono recipe and it was a mistake: This recipe wasn't sufficiently sour nor creamy. I thought the recipe looked "off" when it called for only 3 eggs and 2 lemons. 

The recipe I usually make and will go back to has (9) egg yolks  and the juice of (5) lemons and it tastes just like the soup the owners of a Greek restaurant made - and they were from Greece. Customers would call to see if it was the soup of the day and hang up if we answered, "No today it's vegetable.." 

Beloved and for a reason: The egg-ier and more sour recipe is far superior to this one.

This was delicious! I used chicken broth and added a tablespoon of corn starch and a bit of garlic. Followed the rest of the recipe as is and it was perfect. I thought the lemon flavor was spot on, and actually added just a touch more to the warmed up leftovers. Thanks so much!

I picked this version because it looks like an actual Greek posted it.   I made it for my family twice and it's a hit.   Thea and Yiayia said that it may have a little too much lemon so next time  (and there will certainly be a next time) I will use 1 1/2 lemons rather than two.

This was the best Lemon Chicken soup I have made so far. It is a simple recipe that can be tweaked or not and still be good. I added Thyme,celery salt and chopped onion.  Browned the chicken in olive oil slightly before stewing with the broth(also some water to cook rice) and seasonings. After the chicken was done I added some Jasmine rice, then at the end added 2 beaten eggs and the juice of 2 large lemons. Yum Yum Yum is all I can say.

This recipe is very similar to my yiayias recipe as well, except she would add celery, carrots, onions, and a bay leaf to the chicken broth. Afterwards she would remove the vegetables. I actually add more lemon juice to my bowl.

Delicious! I used a 2.5 lb bag of frozen chicken breasts as that's all I had. Cooked the breasts in as little water as possible for about 2 hours & removed. I had to add chicken stock to get more liquid. I added rice, then shredded chicken after the rice cooked. I also mixed the eggs with juice from only one lemon. After tempering eggs, I added the juice from the second lemon to taste. Hubby & I loved it!

I used chicken thighs and when cool,  removed the skin , deboned, shredded the chicken and added back to soup pot. I used Arborio rice because I couldn't find Orzo, which is usually used in this soup.  When adding the lemon juice I added in the zest as well.  Smells delicious.

I am rating this based on the fact that it is the recipe used at "Pegasus On the Fly" in the Chicago MDW airport!  It is THE best soup and my personal favorite. Looked it up on Pegasus' menu so I could make it at home in Nashville!

This is one of my favorite soups - delicious, comforting, and so easy to make! The only differences are: 
- I add tofu, boy choy, and green onions to it 
- I don't use a whole chicken - just thighs or breast
- I do put more eggs, rice, and sometimes lemon juice - depending on how I want it to taste

Also great for cold weather and will clear your head up. Only thing I learn is that for me 3 eggs I a little much I usually do 2 with 3 lemons and a hint of more salt.

This is the best soup ever. I am Greek and my dad use to make this when he was alive.  Most Greek Restaurants dont put pieces of chicken in the soup they mostly use chicken broth, I love it with the chicken in it. It really to bad grocery stores dont sell this. I would eat this all the time.

I threw this together for lunch. I heated chicken stock ( kitchen basics is the best and gluten free) until almost boiling. Followed the egg/lemon portion of the recipe exactly the same. Added rice cooked in chicken broth from a day earlier to the broth before I add the egg/lemon mix. It turned out so amazing. I added chicken breast I'd made the day before.

Love this soup!  The lemon brightens it up without being overwhelming.  Fantastic!  Made this recipe several times and also freezes well.

I thought the soup was very good, I did add onion, celery and carrots, for flavor and color.

I was really pleased to locate this recipe. I make this soup at least once every few months and lost the original recipe. My mother really loves it when I make this for them...
