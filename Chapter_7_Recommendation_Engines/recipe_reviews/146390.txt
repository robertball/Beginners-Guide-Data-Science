Good. But leave out Fois Gras. I'm not sure why my comments keep getting edited out but others' comments are still here... all the same good recipe.

Great recipe! I did not use foie gras it is expensive. I used a regular pate and it was delicious! I would also try with the mock foie gras recipe posted here as well.

Delicious and easy recipe- don't change a thing! Foie gras is a bit pricey as are most quality ingredients. As for it being "cruel" that is a misconception easily disproved with a little research. Enjoy!

It was a lot of work but really tasted good. I used the leftovers in a chili recipe including the prosciutto and foie gras which I made a mock foie gras recipe I found on this website. The chili along with other ingredients turned out great.
