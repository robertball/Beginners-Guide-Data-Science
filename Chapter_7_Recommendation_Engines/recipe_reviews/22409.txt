These are the BEST!! I used half of a cherry as recommended by another review since I had the BIG cherries. It worked great. The frosting is perfect (not runny at all) but I was very careful to make sure it was completely cool & so were the cookies. I put the cooled frosting into my Pampered Chef Easy Accent Decorator and it really made it easy and fast. These are easy to make....Just follow the directions and you can't go wrong. These are perfect for the holidays.

I made this as a present and they loved it. Next time, I will probably add a LITTLE more cherry juice to the chocolate, however.

I am going to bring this for our Annual Christmas Cookie exchange.  They came out perfect!  Although they make 32 cookies, not 42.  I only used half a cherry so that I could cover it up with the frosting.  I am a cooking novice, and they looked store bought!  One of my new favorites!

The cookies were fairly easy to make. The frosting was runny and somewhat transparent, which didn't make the cookies look too appealing (although they tasted great). When I made them a second time I used an opaque frosting that worked much better.

These cookies are excellent!  They disppeared very quickly.  Make sure you apply the chocolate frosting after the cookie has cooled, or you will not get good chocolate coverage.  Other than that, they were very easy and quite impressive looking/tasting.

These are wonderful.  I used the suggestions from the reviews and used only 1/2 cherry per cookie and 1/2 the frosting.  I can't make these too often my husband and I would each weigh 400 pounds

As others suggested cut the cherries in half. I rinsed a patted dry. Cookies are like a soft batch.  We liked them better without the frosting. Kept the dough in fridge between baking, made easier to roll when cold.

This was the favorite cookie at Yule last year.
I substituted tart cherries, and was really pleased with the contrast in flavor.  Drain them as well as possible, to avoid soggy cookie bottoms after a couple of days [though they are so good, they might not last that long :)]

The cherry and frosting is great but the cookie part turned out dry.  I re-read the recipe many times to make sure I hadn't missed any ingredients.  Next time I'm going to add more butter!

Very tasty cookies!  I had a little trouble with frosting being too thick but a little extra margarine or butter the next time will take care of that because I will be making these again.  Great for the cookie jar or on a gift tray.
