Mmmmm...sooo good.  I've been making a quick and easy version of Smoky Mtn. Chicken for years with just a bottled BBQ sauce.  But this BBQ sauce was sooo good, and sooo worth the effort- and it was actually very little effort.  I will make extra batches of the sauce and keep them on hand for all my BBQ sauce needs.

Delish, but I must confess.  I misread the recipe and added 1 tablespoon of the adobo sauce.  It tasted great though.  I made this twice in a row and still just could not get enough of it.  The first time I made it without the cheese and bacon, the second time with it.  It's much better with cheese and bacon!!

This recipe is packed with flavor! I used cheddar instead of provolone and skipped the bourbon. It's so good.

Great blend of flavors with just the right amount of bite. I didn't bother with the topping of bacon, red onion, or provolone cheese and it was scrumptous. I did use only 1 cup of ketchup and added 1 cup of Cattleman's Smoke House Barbeque Sauce.  I think using 2 cups of ketchup would have made it too strong with tomato flavor. Thanks for the recipe, Janine!

When I made the sauce it was very spicy, I was surprised after I cooked the chicken with it that it was not as spicy any longer.  The recipe was wonderful!

Unbelievably tasty barbecue sauce. I have to admit, however, that I did things a little bit differently - I had brandy but no bourbon, so I just used the brandy, and it's too cold at the moment to grill outside, so I baked the chicken in the sauce. It was DELICIOUS. I cut up some leftover bell peppers I needed to use up and spread them around the edges of the baking dish, added chicken and topped with the barbecue sauce, put some sliced onions on top, and baked at 350 for about 40 minutes before topping with cheese and baking another couple minutes until the cheese was melted. It was amazing. Spicy, sweet, and very flavorful. Thanks, Janine!

This was great. The whole family loved it. Prefer spicier food, so I used half a can of Chipotle with adobo sauce. Otherwise, made exactly as the recipe stated. Used the other half can of chipotle in my mashed potatoes. Thanks for a great recipe. Will try this again, and try it on a pork loin!!

This was delicious, but it requires a lot of ingredients I don't keep on hand (whiskey, 2 cups of ketchup...)  I didn't feel like amount of money, time and effort that went into making the sauce was worth the end result.  Again, it tasted great; it wasn't bad in any way, it just was not as good as I would expect for something requiring that much effort.

FANTASTIC...the BBQ sauce alone was incredible...however, i did change up the recipe a bit. I pretty much followed the recipe for the sauce exactly (i don't measure when i cook and i tweaked the recipe to my personal liking) but instead of grilling the chicken, i cubed it up, seasoned it with grill seasoning and then threw it in the crockpot with about 1/2 the sauce. I let that cook on high for about 2 hrs and then low for 2 more. I then removed all the chicken chunks from the crockpot and shredded it in a bowl with 2 forks, put in on a bun, topped it with some more of the BBQ sauce, placed a slice of smoked gouda and a slice of provolone, but it under the broiler for 2 minutes to melt the cheese, topped it with chopped red onions and then the top bun....best sandwich i've had in a longggggg time!! =)

This was excellent. My family loved it with the sauce. It was a bit too spicy for my kids due to me adding a bit more Chipotle peppers. I also used crushed tomatoes instead of Ketchup to make it a bit healthier.

This was good. I didn't have some of the ingredients for the BBQ sauce, so I decide to still give it a try using a bottled sauce. I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and made the remainder of the recipe as stated. We cooked it over charcoal, which is preferred in this household, even though we have a grill that will do both charcoal and gas. Next, time I will try the homemade sauce, as I typically love homemade BBQ sauce. Even with bottle sauce it was very good! Thanks for sharing!

Restaurant quality dish!  I made this for my sister and her family on a recent visit and it was a big hit.  I used a sharp cheddar, omitted the grilling seasoning and baked the chicken instead of grilling it (middle of winter and no broiler).  Definitely will make this dish again!!!

This was pretty good.  We like extra spicy food so I used the whole small can of Chipotle peppers and the sauce.  The marinade turns out to be more like a spicy, smokey, barbeque sauce.  I think this would be even better on ribs!

I really liked this recipe, except for changing the ketchup to diced tomatoes like some of the other reviewers suggested i followed it exactly and i found that i really think ketchup would have worked better because it would have been easier to baste on as i was grilling the chicken. I will follow the recipe to the T next time!!  Thanks for the really good tastes in this marinade!!

This recipe impressed my entire family.  I used wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar.  I doubled the garlic and adobo peppers and sauce.  I left everything else the same and served with red garlic mashed potatoes.  To grill the onions it makes it a lot easier to wrap the onion slices in tin foil and grill over indirect heat.  And then after the chicken is done. i turned off the grill and layered the toppings on and shut the grill top to melt it perfectly.  This is my favorite recipe on this site so far and would recommend it to all.

This recipe is incredible!  We all loved it.  The sauce alone is so good I'm dreaming of all sorts of ways to use it.  Only thing I did differently and I'm glad I did was instead of grilling the onion slices I caramalized them in a pan.  That way I could almost smother the chicken with them, then add the bacon and cheese.  This was so so jam packed with flavor.  I thought the heat level was pretty  mild and might add an extra pepper next time.  I will make this again for sure.  Thanks so much for sharing this one Janine.

Superb recipe!!  The only change I made was to thoroughly heat the marinade sauce and then use it for basting on the grill.  Hate to waste good ingredients.

Absolutely delicious!  I like mine extra spicy so I add additional chipotle pepper and adobo sauce.  I sometimes make just the sauce from this recipe on its own as a general purpose barbecue/dipping sauce.

I made double the sauce and increased the adobo sauce to about 2.5 teaspoons and used the largest peppers in the can.  If you're looking for a super spicy sauce, this isn't for you.  But if you want an incredible combination of flavors - you need to look no farther.  I used half for chicken breasts and prepared per the recipe and the flavors melded together perfectly.  Used the rest for grilling a pork tenderloin and it was equally delicious.  A very tasty, easy sauce to throw together.  Will blend more thoroughly next time to make injecting into thicker pieces of meat easier.

Wonderful flavors.  Only thing I would change is to reserve more of the marinade to use as a dipping sauce for the chicken...it's sooo good.

It was definitely good but not great.  Maybe kick up the spice to make it different?  I did like the onion and cheese addition.

Awesome recipe. Has become a very much requested dish at family gatherings. I use apple wood in my Weber as I don't like gas grills. Try this recipe folks, it's worth it. Thanks Janine for sharing this keeper.

DH thought this was absolutely wonderful.  Packed with flavor!!  I must say the sauce really overpowers any seasoning that I had put on the chicken.  Next time will just use the sauce.  Thank you for sharing.

I made this recipe exactly as listed. It was delicious! I made this for my mother and grandmother and although it was a bit spicy at first, the heat wore off as you made your way through the meal and it was fantastic! I would recommend using a charcoal grill as that really adds to the flavor.

Awesome! We decided to serve this for some friends we had over for dinner. I made my husband actually prepare the sauce the night before. Even though he complained about all the ingredients (which is not true) he said it was well worth it in the end. I could tell he was proud of himself. On a side note, when we tasted the sauce right after it was made, it was really spicy. The next day, after the chicken had marinated overnight, it was perfect. Not too spicy at all, which was good because our friend did not like really spicy food. She thought it was excellent. Also - we did not have any bourbon and used Canadian Club Whiskey - tasted great.

This is one of the pleasant surprises on allrecipes.  I added extra chipotles for more kick.  Chicken marinated in the sauce and then grilled comes out juicy and so tasty.  The sauce is also wonderful on ribs.

Everyone really liked this recipe!  We like spicy foods so we used about half the can of chipotle in adobo sauce. Topped with a slice of bacon and a slice of provolone.

Just have to come in again and say how much we love this sauce. I recently used it for pulled pork sandwiches which is also to die for. So try the sauce, even if you don't have chicken! LOVE IT!!!

If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. I have never tried to make Smoky Mountain Chicken at home, although I have had in restaurants. It has a delicious smoky flavor, even skipping the bacon, like I did, (to lessen fat & calories). Thank you, Janine for an outstanding recipe. Now...can you tell me what to do with the "rest of the can" of Chipotle peppers!? :) j k

Huge hit with the boyfriend and friends - definitely will be making again. Followed the directions as written although I did add a pinch of chili powder to the sauce since we love our food spicy :)

I have made this recipe many times as directed and the family loves it. I have also made the sauce in a slow cooker with the chicken. After about 5 hours on low setting shred the chicken and return to the sauce. Serve on buns as you would a pulled pork sandwich, with or without coleslaw. The sauce is so delish and great for a holiday weekend instead of burgers.

Excellent! A little time consuming so make lots of the sauce, because you WILL want to use it as a marinade or grilling sauce again! I followed the recipe exactly but when time to grill, I topped w/ the sliced onion, covered w/ foil & baked @ 350 for 45 mins.Then I added the cooked bacon & sliced provolone & put back in the oven to melt. Served it w/ Spanish rice, tossed salad & fresh rolls. Exceptional!

This was delicious.  The chicken was very moist and tasty.  Didn't use the bacon topping so it could a tad healthier.

Well this was awesome! I have to admit I just kind of used this as a guideline. I found a similar recipe online at thepioneerwoman. She makes it with a honey mustard marinade.  I didn't feel like taking the time to make the sauce so I used regular bbq sauce (half that way half w/ honey mustard). I made mine on the stove top because it is way too cold to grill outside.  So here is what I did, it was super simple and super tastey. I cut up my bacon into 1 inch chunks, friend, set aside. Poured most of the grease out, but left some to make the chicken in. Cooked the marinaded chicken (which I had pounded for more even cooking) and cooked about 5 minutes total. Put on a sheet pan, sprinkled on bacon (so much better than bacon bits) and sprinkled on sharp cheddar cheese. Put in the oven at 400 for about 5 minutes so bacon was sizzling and cheese was melted.  It was fantastic! I'm sure it would be even better with the great sauce from this recipe!

I had to leave out the bacon and cheese and i didn't have teh liquid smoke.  I marinated my boned in breasts all day and while they were cooking i kept basting them with the reserved sauce.  Very tasty.  In the future i will up the amount of chipotles and the sauce because i would have liked a bit more spice.

Fixed this as written except omitted the bacon, onion and cheese toppings to lower the fat and calories. My husband and I both loved it. It was a bit time consuming, but the sauce makes the dish and I wouldn't change any part of the sauce. Will definately fix it again!

This is a great recipe, although a bit time consuming in the assembly. The sauce would be great on lots of other grilled meats too.

What NOT to do.   I only thought this dish was ok, but I have say that I also had to substitute some ingredients, the fire on our grill was too low, and I didn't use the onion or cheese on top.  I didn't have enough catchup, any brandy or any chipotle in adobe sauce. I subbed:  Tomato paste with 1 can of water; Cooking Sherry; S Bend Sauce - a flavorful Barbados brand yellow hot sauce.  It was too tomatoe-y for my taste and not sweet at all. Since my fire was too low, I didn't get the caramelizing on the meat like I thought I would.  I tried it again the next day with the cheese...still only ok. Sorry!

OMG! This was sooooo good! I followed the recipe to the T and the sauce was amazingly good. I always rave about big als bbq sauce but this one was just as good. The perfect amount of spice,tang,and sweetness. The chicken, smothered in the bbq sauce, topped with grilled red onion,bacon and cheese... OMG, i cant say enough good things about this. I will serve this the next time i have company!

Fabulous!  Made it exactly as is- except forgot the red onion at the end.  It is a recipe I will made again.  The sauce was amazing. I doubled it and then made a gravy out of it to put over top of our baked potatoes.  Thanks for sharing.

Awesome Flavor!  It is winter here and therfore our grill is put away so I cooked them most of the way in the pan and then put them in the oven for 5 minutes and then broiled for another 5 or so minutes.  My oven crank at 500 too.  Can't wait to try this on the grill, the natural smoke will add so much more as well as the true char on the edges of the chicken!

Great Recipe!  I let it marinate all night and half the next day because I didn't want to make it before church.  It turned out so good!  Next time I will use Rat-Trap Cheese from a local country store. Thanks for contribution

Very good, however this made a TON of sauce.  I would probably cut the sauce  in half next time for that amount of chicken. I like the touch of the onions on this, it gave it a nice touch.
