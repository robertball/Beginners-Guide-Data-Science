I loved this recipe. It was really easy. However, I was unable to find tomatillos in the grocery store, so I used diced tomatoes instead. The result seemed just as good. I also added jalapenos to mine to give it more of a bite. I will use this again!

Perfect for tamales! I blended several fresh jalepenos and extra garlic in with the tomatillo mixture. Tangy, nice, and slightly spicy.

I wasn't too impressed.  I found it very bland and didn't eat the leftovers.  I even added a jalepeno to the sauce.

A very good tamale recipe.  It was my first tamale recipe and I was amazed how good it tasted.

This filling was excellent.  I omitted the onion because I'm not a big fan of onions. I rolled the filling in flour tortillas and covered them with enchilada sauce and cheese and baked at 375 for about 15 minutes.  They were very tasty!

So good!  I had to stuff the enchiladas faster than my boyfriend could eat it out of the pan!

Wow! This may be the best thing I have ever made!  I wrapped the filling in flour tortillas and covered them with cheese, heating them in the oven.  Yummm!
