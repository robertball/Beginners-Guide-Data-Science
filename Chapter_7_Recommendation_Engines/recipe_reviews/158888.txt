I used two egg whites and one whole egg and 1% milk. I topped this omelette with a few halved cherry tomatoes, a tiny amount of extra sharp cheddar cheese and homemade salsa. This was a nice filling breakfast. I've always loved the combination of asparagus and eggs. Next time, I think I might add a clove of fresh minced garlic.

Great omelet! The milk is optional so I just added a little bit, about a Tbsp. I also added a bit of garlic, salt, pepper and some tomatoes for a little extra color and flavor. I used light Parmesan cheese which was a nice departure from the regular American or Cheddar cheeses. This was a really nice breakfast with whole grain toast and juice!

Very tasty recipe. A 1/4 cup of milk for 2 eggs is a little much though, it made the omlette very soft and a bit difficult to handle.

I sauteed the veggies seperately and then added to the eggs once they were set but this was only for presentation and not taste. I also left out the milk (didn't have any) and it turned out just fine! I like mine cheesy and added some cheddar on top as well. Super simple and good flavor!

Made frittata style...used a carton of eggbeaters just eggwhites...red onion instead of green, fresh asparagus, red tomatoes, and yellow cherry tomatoes, also added some fresh chopped basil, pecorino romano, and 2% shredded mozzarella. Very nice and light!

Fantastic idea for omelet.  I always use 3/4 cup of egg whites and 1 large egg whisked together.  I left out the milk and Parmesan cheese.  I used baby bella mushrooms and it had excellent flavor!!

I only added ~1T of milk.  Subbed tomatoes for mushrooms, regular yellow onion for green onion, used parmesan and sharp cheddar.

I did not have asparagus on hand but I had a lot of fresh button mushrooms (sliced), green onions, chopped, fresh basil, and fresh roasted roma tomtatoes. I sauteed the veggies in a little olive oil first to cook the mushrooms down and also warm up the rest of the vegetables. To the egg mixture ( added salt and black pepper) I added just a little skim milk. I think 1/4 cup of milk to 2 eggs is a lot. I also used 4 eggs as I was feeding two hungry people. Once I added the eggs to the skillet I added the vegetables to the center. I lifted up the edges of the omelet and tilted the pan a little to let some of the uncooked egg flow underneath the omelet. Once the omelet set, I added parmesan cheese, flipped the omelet over in half and added more cheese. I topped it off with a fresh piece of basil. This is a nice breakfast and perfect way to start off my morning!

This recipe was supposed to be for a 4H Foods meeting, but we ran out of time and didn't get to make it, so I made it with my own teenage daughters.  Was very good, but definitely need to saute' the asparagus longer.  We also added orange pepper to the sauteed veggies to add a little more color.  Very good!

I precooked my veggies at night and then cooked a fold-over omelet in the morning. I used mushroom broth with eggs instead of milk. I agree with others that 1/4c milk is too much. Overall it's a nice lighter version of an omelet. I enjoyed plump juicy pieces of asparagus.

Very tasty recipes. But i think that 1/4 milk is too much. Use about half that and the omelette will be thicker. =]

This is delicious. Had no mushrooms, used red, green, orange and yellow peppers. Other than that, just 2 tablespoons of milk was exactly right for me. Family loved it!

Yum! This was very tasty! I added cherry tomatoes cut into 4ths and some mixed cheddar/mozzarella cheese. I also added some basil and black pepper.

This was good, but I think the original recipe calls for way too much milk, but since it does say it is optional, I will just have to remember to use half as much next time I make this, because there will be a next time!

Loved the omelet.  Added cherry tomatoes and  some garlic powder like others said and that sure did add to the flavor.

This is not the recipe for the dish shown in the post! The one I wanted was for an omelet with fresh spinach and tomatoes. The recipe shown is one with mushrooms and asparagus.

The picture was deceptive - I added grape tomatoes bc they were in it and it looked good.  I also used about half as much milk, fearing that the omelet would be too thin.  Overall a good basic omelet.

I have not yet made this omelet although the pic looks delicious. I am confused because the ingredients list items don't match what's  in the picture.  Is there a mix up, because I would love the recipe for what I see in the picture

Definitely a tasty base for an omelet. I didn't have milk or mushrooms, so I omitted. Added some garlic scapes and about 1/8 cup crumbled feta for a little extra flavor. Came out really well!
