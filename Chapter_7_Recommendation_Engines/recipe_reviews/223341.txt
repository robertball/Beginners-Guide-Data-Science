I made several substitutions, but thanks for the basic idea. I used acine de Pepe pasta as I had no orzo. I used garlic chives and fresh red basil from my herb garden. I eliminated corn and cranberries, but added sliced baby carrots instead. The mustard vinaigrette was delicious. My garden arugula is growing like a weed so this was a great usage.

This was really great and easy.  Whole family liked  it.  I accidentally bought slivered almonds but I ended up really liking the crunch so would do it again.  I left the cranberries out because I didnâ€™t want the sweetness.

I made this using regular orzo and peach white balsamic vinegar, and other than cutting the recipe in half I followed the recipe as written.  I would say that this could be served as a main salad dish with chicken added, but if it's used as a side dish for just a few you should be careful about how many servings you want to make because it makes quite a bit.   I would definitely make this again!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I thought this was yummy!  I did add bacon bits, which I thought added a little extra flavor.  I did use a champagne mustard instead of dijon, and cranberry pear infused white balsamic vinegar.....only because that's what I happened to have on hand.  I will definitely make this again!
