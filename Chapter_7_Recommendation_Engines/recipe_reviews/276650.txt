Admittedly I made two changes to the recipe based on what I had in the house. I used Swiss instead of gruyere and butternut squash instead of pumpkin. Everything else was done the same. My family loved it along with roasted chicken and asparagus. I think I would have enjoyed butternut squash over pumpkin anyway. It lent it a subtle sweet and savory aspect that makes you keep eating it. I went back for heaping seconds haha.
