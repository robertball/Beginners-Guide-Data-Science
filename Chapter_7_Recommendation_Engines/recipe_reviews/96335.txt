I really liked this recipe, however I think there may have been a couple mistakes. Two tablespoons of cinnamon seemed way too much and the recipe said two pie crusts. The ingredients only made one pie although the crust was really full. I made two pies. In one I put one and a quarter tablespoons of cinnamon and the other I put a little more than half a tablespoon. I think both pies still had too much cinnamon. I did like the flavor of the brandy coming through. I will use this recipe again but I will definitely use less cinnamon.

I followed the amounts of spice for a regular pumpkin pie recipe, namely for one pie you should use:
1 teaspoon of Ground Cinnamon
1/2 tsp of Ground All spice
1/4 tsp of ground cloves
1/8 tsp of ground nutmeg

And each of these you can add more or less of depending on your preferences.  For this recipe I also used:
1 Cup of brown sugar
2/3 Cup of milk (minus a table spoon or two of milk).  Since I did not have Brandy I used some raspberry Chambord Liquor I had in the house and this recipe came out so wonderfully delicious.  I do not think I will ever make pumpkin pie without a little bit of spirits ever again!  It added a little bit of extra smooth flavor to the pie, heavenly!

However, only use 1 tsp of cinnamon!  I also added 1 tbs of flour to the mix, which seems to help the center set better.  The brandy adds a really smooth taste to the pie.  I would imagine you can experiment with other types of liquor as well.

2 TABLESPOONS of Cinnamon RUINS this recipe.  Try one TEASPOON, maybe 2 teaspoons.  The author should change the recipe because it definitely has a typo. It was so strong that I had to start over.
