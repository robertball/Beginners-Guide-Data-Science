This was easy to prepare and was very popular. Great prepared a day in advance, and left-overs were still good the day after the party. I whizzed up the garlic in the dressing to prevent anyone chewing on lumps of garlic. I think it helped blend the flavour too.

I don't have much experience with Mediterranean salads but I was a bit dissapointed with this one.  It lacked something.  I added more vinegar and oil, added oregano, salt, pepper... and still it lacked something... I added feta cheese... still lacked something.  Maybe a little lemon juice and flat leave parsley or basil.  I didn't add the pickle b/c I didn't have it and I didn't see it fitting into the mediterranean concept.  Was the pickle the secret ingredient? Over all, not bad experience, but not super either.

This was okay, nothing spectacular. I too left out the pickle since I did not have any on hand. It really must be the secret ingredient. I don't think I'll make this again, but it was fun to try something new.
