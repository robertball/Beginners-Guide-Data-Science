This is hands-down THE BEST dip I have ever tasted. Even people who said they didn't like goat cheese loved the dip when they tasted it. It is so easy to make but very impressive. I will make this over and over again.

This dip was awesome! I used 6oz. goat cheese log and 6oz. of garlic goat cheese (not in the log form, much softer version, triangle shaped container). I used this because of other reviews saying it needed more flavoring. It was great but I think you could use any type of goat cheese and it would be great as well. Also, next time I make it I will use more cream cheese and less mayo! Enjoy!!

Though we love the ingredients in this recipe, it was very bland...we all agreed it needs more artichokes, lemon juice, and garlic.

This was quite good! I made it for my Oscar party (because of the name & the fact that I love goat cheese!) and it was a success! I've already passed it on to friends because it was so good!

This is good dip, but 1 1/2 tablespoons of Italian seasoning is WAY too much in my opinion.  I agree with the previous reviewer in that maybe more garlic would make the dip better.
