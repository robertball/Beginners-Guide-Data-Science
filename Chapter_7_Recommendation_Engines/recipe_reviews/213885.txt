So refreshing for a summer cookout!  I love another reviewer's suggestion of using roasted corn... mmm!  I myself took the shortcut route, using frozen Silver Queen corn and bottled Greek vinaigrette, and it still got raves.  Do use the best-tasting tomatoes you can find, though.  A keeper!

My SIL brought this to 4th of July, and it was so yummy. I think she said she left out the Ital. seasoning. Don't leave out the fresh basil, though; I think that makes it! This one's definitely going in my recipe file.

Delicious Salad. This is very fresh and light and there is so much flavor from the balsamic and basil. Followed the recipe with the exception of using Vidalia in place of the red onion (person pref). Very happy with the results.

I have fallen in love with this recipe!  I did choose to change it up a little - less olive oil, more mayo (Hellmann's Light!), sweet rather than red onion diced, garden tomatoes along with cherry tomatoes, and doubled the non-dressing ingredients (felt there was way too much dressing).  I think my tomato to corn ratio was pretty high, too (higher than the recipe is written).  All the kids scarfed it up, but Mom ate the most.  It was still pretty good on day two, but the fresh basil didn't look as appetizing then.  The nutritionals are scary with full fat mayo and the full complement of olive oil, so definitely get the Light mayo and maybe half the olive oil.  Overall, a delightful salad that we will make again!

Served with my basil chicken burgers and grilled asparagus.

Pretty tasty - I think I'd do less vinegar next time.  Kids did not like it, but adults did.  Great way to use summer vegetables from farmers market.
