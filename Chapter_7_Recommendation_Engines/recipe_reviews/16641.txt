Very tasty. This recipe will vary in taste and heat according to your curry paste. 

Notes about lentils: I have never cooked lentils before so I thought I would share some tips for others like me. 

First off, they are very small so don't try to use a strainer with larger holes (Yes, I know this is obvious). Rinse them well until the water runs clear.
 
Wet lentils stick to everything! Try to get them in the right pot the first time. I found a spatula was good for transferring them. 

Red lentils cook fast! I boiled mine for 2 mins then simmered for about 8 mins. At that point they were mostly tender. I transferred them into the sauce, mixed well and let them finish cooking. They didn't get too mushy like many people have mentioned.

I have never sent a review for any recipe that I have tried. But, this recipe deserves one! It is excellent.  I used fresh tomatoes and then put them  into the caramelized onions. I also simmered all the spices together in a little oil, as taught to me by an Indian cook.  Then, tossed in the garlic and ginger; continued for about 1 more minute. Afterwards, I put the tomato and onions into the spice mix.  Then, added the lentils...  AWESOME!

I can't believe I never reviewed this recipe. I've been making it once a week for a long time now - it's excellent.  The ONLY thing I changed with the recipe was to replace the tomato puree with one can of Muir Glen Fire Roasted Chopped Tomatoes.  It gives it a much better texture and the fire roasted tomatoes just add another level of flavor that regular tomatoes don't.

I can't believe how many people are making this without curry paste. It's the most important ingredient in a curry.  

I serve it with jasmine rice and hot naan. Oh, and don't be alarmed if the lentils look rather mushy before you add them to the spices and tomatoes. You haven't done anything wrong, and they'll still taste just as good. :)

I rate thus at 3 1/2 stars.  The base recipe was decent, but quite bland by my Indian husbands standards.  I altered the recipe a bit to give it a more authentic flavor.
-increased all spices, herbs, garlic, ginger, onions and curry paste by 2x.  kept sugar, salt amounts same
-added ground coriander 1 tsp
-added Garam  masala 1 1/2 tsp
-added garlic powder 1tsp
-added oniion powder 1tsp
-tomato puree by 2X (entire can to make it moister, like authentic dhaal curries) then reduced it down a bit for added flavor

After the additions and alterations my hubby really loved it

All and all I think this is a good recipe for someone who wants to give curry a spin without having to go out and buy the whole Indian grocery store (spices can be expensive!) it also allows for some room to play which is great.

I'd definitely make this again

This was really good!  I changed a few things...  I didn't have any ginger root or curry paste, so I used 1tb of ginger and 1 (extra) TB of curry, also I added a bit more salt at the end.

I made this last night and my whole family, including my 18-month old grandson, loved it.  Beware.........it is very filling!  I over ate to the point of discomfort after loading up a big soup mug, and eating it with a heavy rustic bread and a big salad.    I did what was suggested by others........I doubled the garlic and sauteed the spices in a little oil, then added the ginger and garlic and sauteed for another minute before adding it all to the onions. Then I added the tomato puree and simmered it all together for awhile before adding the lentils.  My house smelled extremely pungent all afternoon and evening..........and I teach piano full time in my home........haha!!  I thought the consistency was just right after adding only about 1/2 cup of the water left in the saucepan from the cooked lentils.   I would like to add that Allrecipes has changed my cooking life dramatically.  I can find more ethnic dishes to try than ever before, and I make my final selections based on the reviews.  This is such a low-risk and wonderful way to try new dishes, and the recipes are all in a FREE "cookbook" loaded with ratings and suggestions!  I'm having a ball treating my family to the tasty results.

Quite good.  I've found that the red lentils take about 20-25 minutes to cook thoroughly (no pre-soaking, just rinsing) with the lid slightly ajar.

This is a wonderful recipe... My spin on it is to add a tablespoon of butter  to the simmer in the last step, only use fresh chopped tomatoes, and double the garlic.. I added this mixture to the red lentils and also 10 jumbo shrimp. Delicious!

I don't usually bother with reviewing, but this was fantastic.  I used 1/2 the salt and tomato paste with water.  I tossed in good quality frozen green peas to add a little more nutrition.

I cut this recipe in half, it cooked up great.  The flavors are the perfect blend of savory, spicy, and aromatic.  My 15 year old son enjoyed it and had seconds.  I served it with steamed finely shredded cabbage to which I added two carrots (grated)and salt and pepper, not much water. Two went together nicely and this was pretty easy to prepare.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I made a few alterations to this recipe to more closely resemble authentic Indian cuisine. I am an Indian food junkie. I pal with a graduate student from Hyderabad, India who will often put her own cooked food aside to eat one of my Indian dishes.I made the following substitutions. I doubled all spices and used (2) medium sized onions sliced thinly and chopped.  I then took approximately 8 fresh and ripe Roma tomatoes, pureed 1/2 of them in the blender and the other 1/2 I chopped. Both were added to the curry after the incorporation of the Red Lentils. I slowly added the tomato puree until I acheived the lose consistancy I was looking for. I served it over a bed of Basmati rice to a group of Indian friends, and got five thumbs up from all of them. Hence, the doubling of the spices to suit their tastebuds and mine. They said it was nothing short of what they would have received in their home country. Good base recipe - 5 stars with the alterations. Enjoy!

Although different from other dahls I have made, this one is good.  I added some cardamom and served it with spinach and tomatoes.

This will be much better the next time I make it.  I over cooked the lentils.  They were very mushy.  Next time I will check them after 10 minutes.  Our family is new to vegan life style, so it's trial and error going forth.  This is a great start.

This is REALLY tasty, as is, but I would LOVE to try adding a diced apple to the mix while I am caramelizing the onions and then leave out the sugar.  I sub sweet apple for suger often when I make curries.  It rounds out the flavor and I don't feel guilty for adding "sugar" unnecessarily. :)  VERY good.  Mmmm....

For those who are saying this tastes like chili, you need to be using red chili powder (made from dried red hot chilis, and found easily at Indian markets), NOT the popular chili powder you usually get at a supermarket that is a blend of chili powder, cumin and other spices.  That said, this is fabulous. I used tomato paste/water, and added frozen peas at the end. Served with jeera rice.

This recipe is delicious. However, I did make a few changes. I've made this dish about 5 times now. Initially, I found that the spices and the tomato puree were too pungent for me so I added half a can of coconut milk to tone down the spices and acidity from the tomatoes. I know coconut milk isn't traditionally used in Indian cuisine but I'm lactose-intolerant so I frequently use coconut milk as a substitute. I also added peas and garnished it with cilantro. I give it 5 STARS after my few changes.

For some Bizarre reason I have just noticed (after cooking this recipe millions of times) that I cook it in the slow cooker and the recipe dosn't call for it - OOPS I just sautee all but the lentils then wash them chuck em in and chuck everything in the slow cooker pot and cook it on low until done... its most awesome especially with Naan have even added veges for a more wholesome meal...

This is such a versatile recipe with a very good spice base. It is excellent as is, served over rice, but I now make it with lots and lots of added veggies. Depending on what kind of vegetables I'm in the mood for, I'll add about a 1/4 cup of any number of the following: broccoli, red or green peppers, potatoes, mushrooms, asparagus, peas, etc. You can really use your imagination and add whatever you like - just remember to double the spices accordingly to compensate for all the extra veggies. Also, I steam or boil the veggies first and then add them into the onion spice mixture while it's still in the pan (before adding the lentils). Sure, it's a little extra work but it's worth it! If you don't feel like chopping vegetables, you can also buy pre-chopped fresh ones at your grocery store (although I think it's still fresher and better when you chop them yourself). Also, add about a 1/4 cup of GOLDEN raisins at the end for an extra sweet kick!

YUM. You can vary the amount of spices to your taste and there's lots of room for adjustments while still remaining very tasty.

I didn't have turmeric, curry paste or red lentils but forged ahead anyway, and it worked out great. I wanted to review this recipe because it was a helpful and worthy guide on my first try at lentil curry *plus* I figured there are others like me that were missing some recipe ingredients. If you don't have curry paste I suggest doubling the curry powder and ginger. I also love cumin and included 1 tablespoon instead of a teaspoon. I used half a can of whole tomatoes (which I smashed and then mixed into the spices) -ta da...my non-authentic substitute for curry paste! All other spiced were added as per the recipe. The caramelized onions truly add to the flavors. Last suggestion: If your lentils are not mushy enough to your liking pulse a hand blender in there a couple of times and stir. It added just enough creaminess to the lentils.

This was my first ever lentil dish!  It worked out well, altho' I added mushrooms for variety.  I used a can of chopped tomatoes rather than 'tomato puree' - not sure if this is an American term for chopped tomatoes, but you can't get a 14oz can of puree...?  Forget rice - serve with chapatis dry heated in a frying pan for 30 secs on each side, and perhaps with some cucumber and yoghurt raita.

This is so easy and delicious and absolutely an excellent bargain for dinner. I don't usually have curry paste around the house so I've just been adding a couple tablespoons of curry powder instead (we have a big bag of that because we love it). We've been eating this with cottage cheese and it is wonderful!

Wonderful recipe. I left out some of the curry powder and added in some garam masala. I used more curry paste, too, and diced tomatoes rather than tomato paste. A small bit of sweet butter at the end was the perfect finishing touch.  I was really proud of this when I served it for dinner, it tasted very authentic.

Good.  I used green lentils (what I had on hand) and extra tomatoes and spices.  Easy to adjust the "heat" in this recipe.

This is really good but be warned, it makes a LOT. Its just me and my husband so as written this is crazy. But it tastes great :) I added a little extra seasoning to mine to up the flavor :) Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy to make and very yummy!  I took someone's advice and didn't fully cook the lentils prior to adding.  Probably about 25 minutes on their own.  Had to make my own curry paste, which was pretty spicy so we added coconut milk to it as we ate.

This was delicious!  I ate two large servings and served it with jasmine rice.  Amazingly delicious and vegan!  I sort of wish that it were a bit wetter to get the rice a little more wet, but maybe that would not be very authentic.

This is DELICIOUS! I followed other reviewers suggestions which made all the difference: don't substitute the curry paste, simmer the spices in the oil for 10 minutes first, then add the vegetables. After brining the lentil to a boil, only cook for 8 minutes- then when you combine them with the spices and vegetables, let it simmer 15-20 more minutes and it won't be mushy. This dish is to die for!

This a great vegetarian recipe even for people who aren't vegetarians, everyone loves it!  I saute the onions, garlic and ginger in the oil then add all the seasonings and curry paste for a couple of minutes to bring out the flavours.  I don't bother mixing them together first just throw them right into the pot.  Then I add the rinsed lentils, water, sugar and I usually use a can of tomato paste instead of tomato puree and it works great. Add more water if needed or cook it longer to reduce the liquid. Chopped fresh cilantro added just prior to serving is essential.

I cut the recipe in half and cooked 1c of red lentils for 10 minutes. I think they would have been done in 7-8 minutes. They are a little mushy, but you know what they taste awesome! I used Thai red curry paste (grocery store did not have Indian curry, but with all the other spices I don't think it makes a difference) and powdered ginger. I also stirred in some spinach at the very end just until it got wilty, which added some nice color. Served with brown basmati rice.

This was SOOOO good! I was really really sad when dinner was over :( and will definitely add to my roster of favorite recipes! I cut recipe in 1/2 to serve 2 people and have leftovers. Lentils cooked super fast (10 min?) so i added them at same time as tomatoes and it was fine - i added 2 tsp cayenne pepper to make it spicier, and used a whole can of diced tomatoes (recipe only calls for 1/2 can if you reduce serving size). I served it with tandoori chicken and basmati brown rice - yum!

This is so delicious! Great fab meatless recipe. I made a few revisions for my own tastes: added a can of rinsed chickpeas, I also used a can of fire roasted tomatoes as recommended by another reviewer, added MUCH more curry paste as I like it spicier, I added a touch of balsamic vinegar, and also some coriander spice and chopped cilantro. I also like curry to be a bit saucier so I added water while it was bubbling away (little bits at a time) until it was my desired consistency. I served this with brown basmati rice (added galic, tumeric, lemon juice and peas to it), and served with papadams. DEEELICIOUS!

Really spicy. I like spicy food a lot, but I was cooking for my whole family, and my mom can't handle spicy things, so it would have been nice to at least say in the description how spicy it is. 

Now, we have been to India, and my little sister was actually adopted from India and looooves spicy Indian food and even she acknowledged that "she could see why it would be too spicy for mom." I followed the directions exactly. Maybe it's the type of curry paste I used? 

Aside from the spice, this is a pretty easy, tasty recipe. Four stars, took a star off for the lack of spice warning. Mom just has to use lots of yogurt with her serving :)

MMM, good! I didn't have curry paste, added 1 tbsp margarine and 1 tbsp water to spice blend.  Instead of tomato puree, I added equal amount of canned fire-roasted tomatoes.  I let the curry mixture cook down uncovered on low heat for a while till it was thick.  I served it all with brown jasmine rice.

I have tried this recipe twice already and although my husband said he liked it very much and had good flavor, I have to say that I was disappointed both times. Something about those lentils! They ended up mushy and the whole dish just looked like a big plate of mush. Too much tomato flavor for a curry dish.

Just made this today and it came out great. Pretty much stuck to the recipe. Some fine details when referencing curries. For curry powder, identify mild or hot. I used a mild curry powder. For curry paste, you can use red, yellow or green. I used red and it worked out fine. Oh, yeah. I think what one person said about added chicken or tofu would be good as a variant, but otherwise good as is.

hi, one can easily leave out the curry paste & powder & the tomatoes. I boiled the lentil along with the minced garlic, turmeric, chilli powder, salt & onions, its very flavourful that way. Finally smoked some butter  & to it added cumin seeds, one chilli -sliced lengthwish and a bit of sliced ginger. Adding chopped tomatoes or any other cooked veggies-chopped carrots, cauliflower, french beans, peas, cabbage, bottle or snake gourd is an option.

I used canned lentils - just add them with the tomato puree and add 1/2 cup of water. Very filling. Goes nice with basmalti rice and naan bread.

Really delicious and very filling.  You need to really keep an eye on the red lentils to make sure they don't overcook and like a few other reviewers, I'd suggest removing with a slotted spoon instead of attempting to drain in a collander.  They're terribly small.

Fantastic!  It had a bit of a harshness from the (storebrand) tomato puree that I used, so I dumped in some coconut milk I needed to use up.  Liked it far better with the coconut milk and I'll keep using it.

This is one of my vegetarian mainstays, now!  I add a green pepper with the onion and have used green lentils instead of read--makes it less of a paste, if you like that better.  Easy, spicy, filling, delicious.

This was really tasty, and not hard to make. I had never cooked lentils before, and they ended up a little crunchy, but that was definitely my fault, not the recipe's. The lentils at the bottom of the pot were very soft, while the lentils at the top did not absorb much of the water.

Left out curry paste (not found at local stores) and the ginger root.  But OH MY!  The aroma was so dense and the recipe came together quickly!  My family who had never eaten lentils prior, were pleased!  We are a family of seven, and it is also very economical.  Thank you for sharing!  We will enjoy it over and over.

I doubled the amount of curry paste, I wanted it spicier.... it was great.  I strongly recommend to sprinkle it with cilantro when served, it makes a big difference.

I'm enjoying my Red Lentil Curry as I right this! I am new at cookingthis type of food, so I was very pleased with the taste of this dish. I bought a Mild curry paste because i wanted to make sure i could add my own heat to it. I end up adding about 1 tsp of red chili pepper flakes to it. I like the heat! Be careful not to over cook your lentils. They cook really fast, not like split peas at all. I really over cooked mine, however, they still taste amazing. i can't wait to try it again, and cook the lentils right. I want to try the same thing to potatoes and chicken. You gotta give this one a try.

Great recipe! I didn't have curry paste so I just added some extra curry powder and a little water to make the curry base a little more like a paste than a powder. Served with some brown rice.

I live in Japan and it's hard to find tomato puree so I substituted tomato paste instead (about 3/4 of the can). It made it a bit too "tomatoey" for my liking so I doubled up the tumeric, added some water and let it simmer for another 15 minutes.  I still found it rather tomatoey, but tasted great. My girlfriend loved it!  Definitely a recipe to keep in the back pocket.

This was good. I used red curry paste and yellow powdered curry. Next time I will omit the sugar as it was a tad sweet from the tomato.

This tastes fairly good, but is not really an authentic Indian dhal or curry.  It's also a bit too thick/bulky for my liking, even after adding a bit of stock.  It reheats well.  Ok with a raita and basmati for lunch.

This was pretty tasty.  I carmelized the onions over low heat for about 25 minutes, -then- started making basmati rice and cooking the lentils.  My lentils took about 15 minutes over low heat to become tender, but watch yours carefully.  I halved the recipe for myself, eliminated the chili powder and sugar, and used just 1/4 tsp of the curry paste.  This gave me a tasty but mild curry.

Amazing flavour base.  I will use this spice mixture to dress other foods.  I made a home made curry paste by combining 1 1/2 tbsp curry powder 1/2 tbsp garam masala powder and water make the paste.

If you are new to Indian cooking; have been intimidated by complicated recipes, this is a great starter curry. A fairly quick, simple, healthful, basic red lentil curry; all ingredients can be found in most larger grocery stores. Since lentils cook quickly, after bringing to a rolling boil, and simmering approximately 10 minutes, it's helpful to have your spices, etc., measured out before beginning the lentils. After rinsing in a bowl with water until clear, I substituted low-sodium chicken broth to cook the lentils, in a 1:2 ratio, and did not need to drain excess broth. From there it's only a few simple steps. Easily expanded upon, with the addition of meat, or tofu, potatoes, carrots, or peas, the layered spices can be adjusted to deliver more or less heat. Served over Jasmine Rice, I found the flavor to be comparable to a mild-medium curry from my favorite local Indian restaurant, without the heavy oils/coconut milk. All in all a delicious, nutritious, straightforward Indian red lentil curry recipe, perfect for beginners, or seasoned Indian foodies alike.

Great recipe. Easy enough to make on a regular basis. I love curries and even take part in a club that ventures out to new restaurants to try their curries. I may start having the club come over to my house!

The only things different I did were:

Coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. The subtle coconut really makes a different. I prefer the benefits of coconut oil over vegetable oil any day.

I didn't have fresh ginger so I just used a teaspoon of ground ginger. 

I also didn't have tomato puree on hand, so instead I used a 6 oz can of tomato paste mixed with 6 oz of water and added some fresh tomato chunks. I did have to add a little more water to loosen up the mix.

I also added at least a half teaspoon extra of all spices to up the flavor a bit.

Overall, great dish. I served over some basmati rice and plopped a bit of mint chutney on top. Can't wait to eat leftovers for lunch tomorrow (this definitely is enough for 6-8 meals!)!

Loved it.  Healthy, lots of flavor, easy, and cheap to boot.  Made a variety of frozen lunches and my husband and I just digging for these.  Usually we get bored of a recipe when we have it too often in a short time frame.  Not this.  Freezes really well with the basmati rice.

I tend to adjust recipes, add ingredients here, take away there, but with this, I followed almost to a tee.  I did use half green/half red lentils b/c that's what was in the pantry. And I pureed my own canned tomatoes.

As the curry base simmered, I impatiently waited for the lentils to cook, and "tested" spoonful after spoonful after heavenly spoonful of the sauce. Sooo delicious.

Final results were also outstanding.  I actually might do more spice next time (medium, w/a push!).

I made this exactly as written, except I couldn't find tomato puree (I even went to TWO stores!), so I used 1 can tomato sauce with a spoonful of tomato paste. I also added cayenne to taste, because I love super spicy food. I made my own curry paste (I Googled it and found a recipe by Emeril). I added the full tsp of salt which turned out to be too much, but that is personal opinion as I don't like salty foods. (It's fine if served with white rice to cut the salt a bit.) Makes a BIG batch!

Delicious! Since first making this, I've made it again and again. As-is, it's fantastic.  I've also added frozen chopped spinach as a variation.  The spinach tastes wonderful with all the flavors and it bumps up the veggie factor.  I've served this on white rice, and quinoa - both are very good, but I prefer rice with this dish.

So tasty and healthy for you. I didn't have tomato puree so I just used a 6oz can of tomato paste and added enough water to dilute it. Excellent! Also, I split the pot in half, one I left as is to keep it vegetarian and the other I added some ground beef I had leftover for additional protein. Both ways were very good.

Super easy and tastes authentic. I used green lentils because it's what I had. I also didn't have curry paste so I doubled the curry powder and it worked just fine. My husband was impressed (and that's hard to do)! Thanks for sharing, Emma!

Outstanding recipe. I don't say that often either. It's better than restaurant quality in my honest opinion. I had only two bites and fell in love with it. I used tomato paste, which I believe is the same or similar to puree. I will definitely recommend this recipe to others.

I've made this curry several times now with fantastic results every time. I generally have split red lentils on hand, so it cooks very quickly. I add enough water to the pot to cover the lentils with an extra inch or two of water. The lentils cook in 8-10 minutes if using split lentils. If the lentils still feel uncooked, I add about a 1/2 cup of water. This is great using whatever Indian spices you have on hand. Adding thawed peas also adds another depth of color and flavor. I love this served with rice.

This is delicious.  I like mine a little more runny, so I added more water and I also added garam marsala and cilantro.  Not sure what type of curry paste is called for, but I only had sag ghost curry paste.  I realize there is probably no one way that this curry should look, but some of these pictures don't do this dish justice.

I really loved this recipe, and hardly changed anything after preparing it as written.  I now use crushed or diced canned tomatoes instead of tomato puree because it gives a better texture, and I've adjusted the spices, but that's something that everybody has to do according to their own taste! Thanks for the great recipe! =)

I could not find red lentils at any super markets in town so I had to use normal lentils. This curry is really hearty and dense. I enjoyed the flavor quite a bit. I do believe that you would be safe only using 1 cup of lentils - maybe 1 1/2 if you prefer less sauce. I found that 2 cups was just too much and soaked up all the sauce, which was disappointing because we served this on top of rice and everything was too dry for our tastes.

So good!!  Cook lentils in plenty of water so they don't get mushy.  Start with a small amount of red curry paste and add more at the end to taste. leave out curry powder

I tried this recipe looking for an Indian style curry and was sorely disappointed. I followed the recipe and the results were something along the lines of meatless chili. It didn't taste bad, but it wasn't at all what I was aiming for.

Sooo good!! It's not easy to make a hearty yet delicious vegetarian meal and this hits the spot. For those who said it needed more spice try using a hot curry paste and getting your chili powder from an indian market.  It really does make a difference.

this is pretty good as written, but i did make some changes to up the nutrition a bit. i added a chopped red pepper, 2 cups shredded spinach, and 1 cup chopped carrot when i added the tomato. i also added a dash of cinnamon, some additional sea salt and ground pepper. i garnished with chopped almonds. lovely.

Really wonderful curry.  We only had to cook the lentils for about 7 minutes until they were soft... so watch them closely!  we also added carrots and cauliflower, which were great additions and made it more filling.  I used a combination of tomato paste and diced tomatoes.  We used about 3 tsp of Thai Red curry paste and it was plenty!

Delicious.  I'd never eaten this before and wasn't sure how long to cook the lentils but it came out just fine.  I added carrots (which really added to the taste) and used 1 tbsp of curry powder rather than adding curry paste (which I didn't have).  I also used canned tomatoes.  I would highly recommend.

Good recipe. Didn't have curry paste. It was rather bland before adding red cayenne powder, extra salt and chili powder. HIGHLY RECOMMEND removing sugar from recipe and adding 1-2 T lemon juice after turning off heat. This is more authentic and TASTY! Also, if you live in a metro area and can get to an Indian/Pakistani grocery, you will find red lentils much cheaper than at the regular grocery store.

A truoy great recipe; you can bet I'll be making this one on a regular -- like every week! -- basis. Made a couple of adaptations, though; used diced canned tomatoes rather than puree (I would imagine that diced fresh tomatoes would be good as well). I also used cumon seeds instead of cumin powder, adding the seeds to the hot oil along with the onions.

Superb!

I guess I have plain curry because I needed to add a little more spice.  But my family ate it without complaint. Next time I'll mix in some peas.

This recipe can be eaten as a side, or a main dish. I serve at potlucks with fresh veggies. Can also use naan for dipping, or serve over rice. Top it off with plain yogurt, too. One of my favorite go-to recipes for company and get-togethers.

I don't think I prepared this perfectly, but I like this a lot.  I used canned diced tomatoes instead of tomato puree (due to what I had on hand) and I think that worked well.  Other reviewers are right that red lentils are relatively quick to cook and that the flavor of the recipe depends a lot on the particulars of the curry paste.  It's quite spicy, I liked it a lot mixed with rice and Greek yogurt.

I loved this, added closer to a table spoon of sugar to the mix, which worked really well. Next time, I might consider adding some cardamom in to give that extra slight crunch/flavour. Such a satisfying dish, I had a big grin on my face as I sat down and tasted the curry of my labours!

I owe it to the world to review this recipe since have been making it approximately monthly for a few years (and I double it to freeze later). It's simple. easy. forgiving. can add spinach, extra garlic, extra curry for extra heat... honestly- it's hard to go wrong with this staple. YUM!

The two cups of lentils should refer to the cooked amount of lentils.  If you us use two cups of dried lentils you will end up with too much.

Excellent, cheap, healthy, easy to make weekday dinner. 
I added red pepper flakes, probably double the spices  (I love curry, cumin, garlic, etc.), double the ginger, two cans of roasted diced tomatoes instead of the puree.

Fantastic!!

Delicious with naan. Followed recipe exactly except used can diced tomatoes instead of purée. Lentils cooked in about 10 minutes (few minutes boiling, rest simmering at low).

I loved them.  I am a new vegetarian and will be making this recipe often.  I followed the recipe to the T, except I had just regular lentils.  Next time I will try the red.

I just made this today and it is very good. I didn't have the curry paste so had to leave that out. I hope to get that the before I make it again.

This was such a fantastic and easy dish to make.  I did use extra hot curry paste and powder as we like it hot!  I served with Masala Nann bread.  This is definitely a dish we will make over and over again.

Tasted wonderful...looked like refried beans!  I must have overcooked the lentils.  Next time I'll watch them more closely and skip the soaking, as another reviewer indicated!

Yum! I couldn't find red lentils so I just used the brownish lentils our grocery store had. Pretty tasty! Added 1 tsp of Garam Marsala just because I had it.

This was so easy and delicious.  I love caramelized onions so I let mine get good and caramelized! Just ate a bowl of this with a dollop of Greek yogurt on top and it was delicious.  Thrilled with this recipe, thanks.

This is good and easy to make but since it has such a strong flavor, I believe I would serve this as a side dish, not as a main meal over rice.

This was great. I think the tomato paste mixture needs some water though to make it a little less thick.

YUM!!! I GOOFED & was doing 2 things while making dinner & I over-cooked the lentils (they don't take very long).  Sooo, I added 2 (14 oz) cans of diced tomato's & upped the spices to adjust to increased liquid, rather than discarding what I had... (Sorry Emma, I don't chg recipes & then rate them based on my chg's, typically). However, the lentils would have been too mushy to mix into the curry base.  I then served the "sauce" over the lentils. This naturally chg'd the character of the dish from that of a Daal, which was not my intent.  But, I ended up w/ a VERY TASTY dish & less carbs cuz the rice was eliminated. A wonderful, healthy vegetarian dish even w/ my multi-tasking mistake! Thanks for sharing. I'm gonna try it the "right way" next time! This is a keeper!! :-)

This recipe was good and had a much better flavor than the other red lentil recipe I had (the other included blades mace, star anise, and cardamom which made the dish sweet). I also appreciated that all of these ingredients are fairly common and were already in my pantry.

It had a good flavor, but it came out pasty and very thick. Fortunately, a bit of unsweetened coconut milk fixed it right away. If I had to give an exact measurement, I'd say 1/4 of a cup.

Really yummy. I recently am eating more vegan and this is now a great go to recipe. With the curry I only had a small shallot so when I added the curry paste mixture it was too dry. I added a half of cup of water about and then added coconut milk slowly until I got it to the smoothness I wanted. About a half a cup. A great short cut is using Trader Joe's lentils. They come precooked in a vacuumed sealed bag. I just threw the bag into boiling water for 5 minutes and voila, lentils were done. Ate over brown rice. Soooo good and filling as a great main meal!

This was my first time making Indian food and I would definitely call it a success!  My family loved it.  (parents, brother and boyfriend all gave it two thumbs up)  It wasn't all that spicy but I put a dish of yogurt on the table just in case people wanted to cool the dish down.  A few people did end up using it so I'd suggest it as an addition to the table if you are serving people with varied tastes for spicy food.  

I accidentally bought tomato paste instead of puree.  What can I say, I wasn't thinking.  I diluted the paste (3 parts paste to 5 parts water) and it was delicious. I don't know if buying the right thing would have changed the flavor much but if you make the same mistake as me it will be ok. 

Really I think the curry base could be used for anything- veggies, meat etc.  I'll probably experiment in the future since this was so easy.

Seriously good.  I added some chicken thighs after the onions carmelized.  Topped with fresh cilantro.  Skipped the curry paste because I didn't have it and also the chili powder as I wanted my kids to eat it.  One did, the other nibbled.  Husband and I inhaled it.

Very nutritional dish.  I did not have curry paste, so I added an extra 1/2 T of curry powder, used a whole bag (16oz) of brown lentils, 1 1/2 large onions, 2 tsp of garlic, an extra 1/2 tsp of ginger and 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chiles.  It was delicious served in a whole wheat pita bread.  Will definitely make again.

This dish was really great!  I added more of the other ingredients as I didn't have curry paste and when I researched what was in it, it seemed to be more of the same.  I added a couple of tablespoons of butter right before serving which just added such richness.  I also added chopped fresh spinach, a can of chopped tomatoes and a couple Tablespoons of tomato paste.  Try it!

Very yummy! I brought the serving size down to 4 and found it to be a bit bland, so I improvised from there. I'd probably double the spices next time, but then again, I like my curry strong. Would be a 5-star recipe if I didn't have to scramble to kick up the flavor last minute.

This dish was wonderful! I used a mild curry paste and tomato sauce instead of puree as that's all I had on hand. This makes an excellent meal served with rice or can be quickly heated up and served with tortilla chips for an easy and nutritious lunch. Can't wait to make this again! Next time I'll increase the curry a bit.

This is a great base recipe! I put cubed sweet potato in with the lentils about half way through and they are a great addition!

I have to say I was REALLY impressed by this.  My inlaws were coming for supper and I made this.  It was excellent.  Made almost as directed except I used ground ginger as I didn't have any ginger root.  Used a mild curry paste and both my little kiddos loved it too.  Served with basmati rice, naan and pompadoms.  Will be making this again and again.  Yet another excellent reason to eat lentils.

Loved it.  I made it as is and it was a hearty, comforting food.  Perfect in cold weather and serve over basmati rice.

we added celery, carrots, and red peppers. We didn't have curry paste or fresh ginger (we used ground instead) but it turned out delicious!

This is fantastic!!  It is super easy to make.  I did it exactly as it was written and it was delicious!  I have to admit, no one else in my house liked it, but they tend not to like anything different from a burger and fries.  I love both lentils and curry so I had to try this.  It does make quite a bit so I froze some.  Enjoy!

I made this for a main dish for a potluck I recently hosted.  I followed the basic recipe exactly but added two chopped potatoes (boiled before adding) and about a cup of green peas.  Very good and filling.  Served over white rice and with a naan recipe i got from this site.

This was really easy and tasted great!  I used split red lentils and would say it only took about 15 min. from start to finish.  I also added a bunch of fresh cilantro at the end and it gave the dish a bright fresh flavor.  Will make this again.

Super easy and cheap to make a large meal for many. I could only find red thai curry paste and it was fine. I also used chopped or diced tomatoes instead of tomato puree, though I usually use the huge 28 oz can. It's delicious. We usually have this over rice.

This recipe got me closer to what Im seeking in a daal recipe. I added peas and diced sweet potato to this. The sweet potato was a nice addition. Make sure you buy the orange-flesh ones.

So easy to make. This so quickly met my delicious, nutritious, and of course, vegetarian requirements. I love vegetarian recipes that don't require decades of preparation. It's hard to figure that I threw some stuff in a pot and this came out.  Quite a forgiving recipe. I started with lots of lentils and lo and behold I wound up skimming this recipe. In case it's of interest, I left out the turmeric, added more 'extra hot' chili powder, used tomato sauce instead of puree, and honey instead of white sugar. Why? Because that's what I had. About the curry paste, I prefer to make and freeze my own as I learned when I lived in Thailand. I am however out of stock, and used 1/4 cup of Trader Joe's Thai red curry sauce instead.   As long as you get the lentils in, it should turn out terrificallyl!

I recently bought lentils for the first time, ever, and needed a great recipe for the family that would suit my 11 year old daughter as well.  This was it!  She was suffering from sore gums due to a loose molar, so we needed something soft.  I really appreciated Rachael's instructions for begginer lentil cookers, (see comments below somewhere).  I used a fresh spice mix my father had ground up for me that contained all of the dry ingredients listed besides chillis.  I just added them to taste, as I am not much for measuring.  It was fabulous, not too spicey for my daughter, and yet full of wonderful, savoury flavours.  I will certainly make this one again!

I had lots of lentils in my pantry and was searching for recipes to use them when I stumbled across this one. I am so glad that I did ! My family is split between vegetarians and meat eaters and it's not always easy to find dishes that everyone enjoys. This was a hit with everyone from my 7 and 9 yos to my teens , my hubby and I. Not only does it have fabulous flavor that is not too spicy and not too bland, but it is EASY to make and healthy as well. It doesn't get much better than this. This will be a regular meal in our house.

Please, don't make curry without curry. This recipe is fantastic and cheap to prepare. Perfect for people who like indian food. Saute the onions in the oil as written, however don't stir too often... you want the onions to get fairly dark brown - not burnt, but the darkening adds distinct flavor. Be sure to rinse the yellow split peas (don't use lentils!) and skim the water as they cook. I am very impressed with this easy recipe! Thank you.

Made this for dinner tonight!!! It was fantastic!!  I didn't have any curry paste, so I used Ketchup (I know, poor sub!!).... BUT it really turned out great!!! I added salt to the lentils while they were cooking, and I think that really enhanced the flavour.

In a word, delicious.  I like to stir-fry one package of extra firm tofu (drained & cubed) and carefully fold it in at the end.  It provides a nice texture contrast to the spicy lentils.

Fabulous! We used Patak's hot curry paste and served this over rice with a dollop of plain yogurt and a spoonful of coriander chutney. Yummmm! This recipe is a keeper. Note that the curry sauce reduces very quickly. My husband poured about 4 oz of the beer that he was holding into the sauce to keep it from drying up, and that seemed to do the trick. :o)

4 1/2 stars.  This tasted similar to chili and Im categorizing this recipe as great vegetarian dish alternative to chili by adding more tomato.  We ate it with crackers and cheese.  We used the leftovers to make nachos with lots of cheese and tasted great.

Easy recipe to make. It was very tasty and definitely satisfied my craving for Indian food but it seemed to lack a little something. If I hadn't been in such a hurry I would have played around with it a little bit.

I made this dish attempting to mimic a similar dish my daughter makes and it was wonderful.  I served it with grilled chicken that I mixed in as well as dried cranberries and roasted almonds.  I served a side of minted yougart with it and everyone raved!

This was really fab! I made very few changes as well. I only added a few more spices (coriander, clove, etc...) and some yogurt at the end. It was great for a quick and healthy mid week meal! =)

I just made this for the first time. The author is right--it IS an easy recipe to make, even though there are a lot of ingredients. And the taste is just heavenly. I can't believe I haven't thought to make my own curry before. If you're a vegetarian or vegan, or if you're just looking for ways to incorporate more vegetarian food into your life, you could do a lot worse than this recipe. Be ready to drop a chunk of change to buy the spices if you don't already have them in your cabinet, but again, those spices will keep, and you can use them in all sorts of different dishes. Thank you for this great recipe!

This could be a good recipe except for the excessive tomato puree. It was not bad....just not particularly curry-ish.

First time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly, and it's delicious and VERY easy.  I only gave it 4 stars because, even using half the curry paste and chili powder, it was still too spicy for most of my family.  I used red curry paste and Indian chili powder (very different from Mexican chili powder).  I love it, but it's still too spicy for my husband and all but one of my kids.  2nd time making it, I used 1/2 the curry paste and 1/8 of the chili powder.  I also added a cinnamon stick and a few green cardamom pods to the onions as they were sauteeing.  I served it with plain yogurt as another reviewer suggested to cut the heat.  Also, I served it with a dab of cilantro/mint chutney I made a few days ago, and it is out of this world.  One of my new favorites!

This calls for a lot of spice, but didn't seem to have as much flavor as I was expecting.  I think the problem is adding the spices to the cooked onions.  I suggest setting the onions aside and cooking the spices by themselves for 2 minutes, adding the tomato and then adding back in the onion.

Very good. I used a mild curry paste, I think next time, I'll use hot. The only trouble I had was cooking the lentils to the right consistency. I ended up throwing out the first batch as they had cooked too long and were complete mush. I got it right the second time. However, the dish was still a bit too thick. Next time, I'll add some vegetable stock to the onion/spice mixture before adding the lentils right at the end.

I found this to be very bitter- so I added a pinch of baking soda, to wipe that out, and then some coconut cream for a bit of richness. 
I liked it much better after that. 
Thanks for the great recipe! I will enjoy making this again!

Actually I would give it 4 1/2 stars rather than 5.  It was very good, but also very thick and pasty.  I served it on rice as suggested.  Lots of leftovers!  Next time I'll thin it a bit and maybe not cook the lentils so long.

This was great! I highly recommend adding fresh tomatoes. I also used tomato puree rather than tomato paste, and the texture was excellent.

Excellent recipe!  The only thing I did differently was use chopped tomatoes and I liked the added texture it gave the dish.  Very good spice combination...gave it a little heat.  This is a keeper for sure.

This recipe is soooo good! I make it 2-3 times per month. I make it with whatever is in the fridge: chicken, beef, red peppers, etc... and serve it with rice and naan. Yummy, cheap, perfect.

A good overall red lentil curry.  I doubled the garlic and ginger and added the flesh of one harabanaro pepper and it came out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe! Perfect combination of spices makes this lentil dish great even for those who are not big lentil lovers. I served it with brown rice for a good protein balance and some light sour cream for indulgence. Will make it again...very soon!

I have never had Indian curry before.  I liked it but even with half the amount of curry paste it was too spicy for me to eat the leftovers.  (I was sweating and my nose was running and the heat was coming off of me!)  I should have halved the recipe because the full recipe was too much for my husband and I alone, even if we both ate leftovers the next night.  Perhaps coconut milk would have helped, a dollop of plain yogurt on top cooled it off but didn't help the flavor.

Perfect blend and proportions of spices...just the right balance!  I didn't have curry paste..only had "Thai red curry paste" so only used 1 tsp. of that (heat factor) Kept all the other proportions the same.  I didn't have tomato puree or sauce so used a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  Cut the onions into slices for a little more substance to the dish, and had about 1/3 cup of leftover spinach so tossed that in.  *gave a really nice color w/the green and red*  It was nice and spicy but since we were having company that doesn't eat quite as spicy, stirred in about 1/3 cup of yogurt and it was creamy and toned down the heat but the spice was still there.  Loved this.  Served w/ "Indian style sheesh kabab" and "Indian Spiced Rice" from Allrecipes.  Very lovely meal.  Will definitely make again.

Needs more spice, but overall pretty darn tasty. We ate it with pita bread instead of rice. Even my dad hoovered it, and he's notorious for not eating outside his usual.

A great recipe. I added a can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato puree, and added extra madras chili powder - lovin' the heat! Next time, I will take other's advice and add other veggies like carrots and peas...maybe even just the veggies if I have no lentils in the pantry. Word of caution - Lentils cook very fast!

Overall, this tastes good.  I will add some more pepper or jalapeno next time to increase the spice.  Also, I will remember that lentils are tempramental and it doesn't take much to make them mushy.

Excellent! Although I had some troubles with the amount of water needed, I simmered the cooked lentils with the onion mix until the consistency was right. I substituted tomato sauce for the tomato puree. I served it with indian bread.

i didn't have any curry paste, but i tried adding korean vinegared red pepper paste instead, along with coconut milk. if you use tomato paste with no extra salt, it makes for a very sweet, mild curry.

This is a great way to use red lentils! I added one can of coconut milk and about 1 tbsp coarsely ground pepper (the pepper as more of an aesthetic thing and the coconut milk for more of a creamier curry flavor). I will likely have to add water upon reheating for lunch tomorrow!

Interestingly I also used a Thai version of (red) curry paste since this is all I had -- works great! I cut it back to 1 tsp though -- the stuff I have is pretty potent! Really good flavor, a bit on the hot side for milder palates, but I'm not afraid of the heat, so it was great for me! Despite adding much more liquid, for a runnier dahl I would cut back lentils to about 1 1/4 or 1/2 cups. Would definitely make again!

This was such an easy recipe to make and very adaptable - didn't have curry paste so I added some ground cilantro seeds, cinnamon and cayenne, which made it even better.  Also boiled some cauliflower with the lentils (mixed green and red).  Really great recipe!

I doubled the spices and added two cans of chickpeas, which I cooked in the same pot with the lintels. This was the first curry that my dad could eat without reflux! Also, this cooked so quickly and was almost a one pot dish for me!

Wow. This is excellent! I followed the recipe exactly as it is, except for I didn't have fresh ginger so I used 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger. And I also added a can of chickpeas at the very end just to give it an extra bit of texture. So good with rice and naan bread. Will make again!

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I added water to desired consistency, and it was excellent.  If your spices are fresh, I would say this is medium spicy. Since this was my first time making it, I experimented and split the recipe into two portions and added coconut milk to one bowl and it turned out a nice consistency and was excellent also.  Next time, I will substitute packaged steamed lentils and this recipe will be complete and ready in 15 minutes.

Loved it! I used the amount of lentils called for but doubled everything else, I wanted it to be a little more saucy as I was serving it over rice as a main dish. I don't eat meat and this made a lovely dinner.

I must have made this recipe at least ten times, and probably more.  I usually double the spices, add frozen chopped spinach to it to make it even more of a main dish, and add extra tomato (either diced or sauce, depending on what I have in the pantry) to make it saucier because I like wet curries (so good over basmati rice!).  I have made it for potlucks and everyone has loved it and asked for the recipe.  It is extremely healthy and makes a lot, so I like to have it for lunch the next day, too.

I don't cook the lentils first! I simply double the spices, garlic, and ginger and onions. I add diced tomatoes (canned or fresh) and then add the uncooked lentils. I keep a pot of broth and add and stir as the lentils soak up the moisture, like a risotto. The lentils end up flavorful and never mushy. I also finish with a little vinegar (red wine or white). Sometimes I like to throw in some peas and/or cauliflower and serve it a dollop of yogurt or sour cream. Love it!

Best lentil curry I've made.  Company worthy.  If you freeze some plain cooked lentils, this is easy.  The curry paste is what makes it.

This was delicious and tasted truly Indian! I did not have curry paste, and subbed it for 1TB more of the curry powder. I was too lazy to mince my ginger root and so used 1TB of ginger powder. To add to the richness, I sautéed the onions in coconut oil and vegetable oil. I didn't have enough lentils so used half green, half red lentils and I think it worked out well. I started the green lentils in the book for 10 min, then added the red lentils for 20 minutes. The red lentils cooked quickly and broke down after 20 minutes, but the green lentils kept its shape. I think 20 minutes may be too long for the red lentils.  I quite liked the red lentils because they add a texture that the green lentils would not have been able to provide.... So do make sure to use the red! For an extra kick, I added 1 Tsp of cayenne. 

This is versatile, as my husband needs meat every once in a while, I was able to put cubed chicken breasts into the stir fry after adding the spices. This worked well.

I served over brown rice and added cilantro. So delicious and healthy, too!

Incredible. The only change I made was diced tomatoes instead of pureed as it was what I had on hand and I didn't measure the oil and probably used closer to 2-3 TBSP. I will be making this often. An important plus for me is it was quick and easy to make but it taste like you slaved away in the kitchen. btw served it with rice

Wonderful! I omit the curry paste since my four young boys don't do spice well, and it's still wonderful! I took another's review into consideration and only simmer the lentils for eight minutes.  In place of the tomato paste I used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes. I also upped the tumeric and curry powder measurements, and added a can of kidney beans for added protein.

This recipe is so versatile.  I adjusted the spices to my taste by adding hot curry powder along with the red curry paste.  Also added Garam Masala and a little lime juice at the end for some brightness.  I also added a bay leaf.  This is very filling and delicious.  My husband said our house is gonna smell like a Motel 6 lobby for days and I love it!

Very flavorful, especially after sitting in the refrigerator overnight.  Lentils were way too mushy, but the dish was still good, and I'm not even a fan of lentils.

This turned out fabulous! I accidentally added Thai Kitchen's Red Curry Paste rather than an Indian-style one, but wow it turned out so good! I had to add a lot of water though and the split lentils I used turned into mush. One thing to note is that it says it serves 8, however I ended up eating 7/8 of it just for dinner. I suggest if you have a big appetite, double the recipe so you have extra!

great recipe. I've made this several times, and it's really forgiving. I prefer using chickpeas, but the original lentils work great. I have found that the spiciness of curry paste varies wildly and can really change how the end result tastes.

This was amazing!  Personally, the only thing I added was mushrooms (I had some in the fridge that needed to be used) and I added a cup of plain yogurt.
Also, I garnished the finished meal with lemon juice.  I will definitely make again!

I thought this was great! Easy to make and tasty, few dishes to wash, and plenty of leftovers. I didn't have curry paste, so I just added more curry powder and a little bit of water to the spice mix. I am not a vegetarian, so I cooked the lentils in homemade chicken stock. 
I'll add one bit of extra advice... I preserve lemons and limes and added some preserved limes to the top of the stew. Cooled the spices down just a bit and added a tang. I'll make this recipe again.

I changed the recipe to 12 servings and used red rice, instead of lentils.  I did not have curry paste, but I had everything else.  Fresh onions from the garden.  I served as a side dish with Hoisin-Ginger Beef Skewers from this site.  The person who posted this is right, you can eat this as a main dish, too.

I'm not a big curry fan but this was surprisingly good. The kidlets weren't enthused because it was pretty hot. I'll have to alter that next time, serve with white rice, and garnish with cilantro.

Delicious! I didn't add any sugar, and instead increased all the spices to a tablespoon rather than a teaspoon. I will definitely make this again.

I am in love with this recipe! I have been making Easy Masoor Daal (also on this site) for years but was looking for other ideas for red lentils.  This is so easy.  I recommend investing in a mesh strainer for rinsing lentils. I have one that I bought during my quinoa obsession and it works great for both.  Get one that is small enough to invert directly into the pot you'll be cooking your lentils so you can just bang it against the sides of the pot to release the lentils rather than dealing with spoons.  As another reviewer pointed out, wet lentils stick to everything! I served this with plain yogurt for my kids to tone it down a bit.  Next time I'll remember the cilantro and I will see if I can find Indian red curry paste. I used Thai, which was fine, but this is an Indian recipe so I want to see if it can be even better.  Thank you to the reviewer who suggested doing this in the slow cooker!

This recipe is excellent! I've never cooked Indian food (although I like to eat it) so I was a bit nervous. The only cooking change I made was to saute the spices with the oil before adding the onions. This infused the oil with the spice flavor and released the fragrances of the spices. Also, I added the lentils to the sauce and found that I did not need all the lentils prepared. I just stopped adding them when it got to the consistency I desired (like a paste). I made it with the carrot rice recipe (made with basmati rice) from this site. Delicious!

This was excellent.  I served it with naan and had it for lunch the rest of the week.  My lentils cooked very fast so next time I will wait to start them until the curry is almost ready.

I have made this several times, and it always comes out wonderfully.  I prefer more sauce and a little more substance, so I usually add a block of frozen chopped spinach to the sauce, then a can of tomato paste. The spinach thaws and adds water to the sauce as well.  After that I add water if it needs to be thinned out.  I usually add a bit more of each of the spices as well, to compensate for the increased amount of sauce and vegetables.  I then serve it over Basmati  or Jasmine rice.  I have received many compliments and requests for this recipe!

I have made this recipe many times.  I have played with it from time to time to make new creations.  Today I used the recipe to stuff cabbage leaves to make "cabbage rolls" and in the past I have used tomato sauce in lieu of paste to make lasagna rolls.  Delicious every time.

I have made this recipe several times, and it is delicious! I have made adjustments though. I find that I like it better with fresh tomato puree. I'll either use fresh tomatos and puree them in my blender, or I use a can of diced tomatos. I also like it a bit on the spicier side, so I'll add a small hot pepper in. I've also put quinoa in with it before, or garbanzo beans. I really like it with the garbanzo beans. It adds a little variety rather than just having lentils. Yummy stuff!

Very Very Good!  I just made this and my tummy is smiling.  I had everything to make it but the curry paste.  It turned out fabulous without it.  I added a few dashes of cayenne pepper and hot red pepper flakes for a spicier kick.  Instead of serving over rice, I served it wrapped in Middle Eastern Flatbread. I love Curry Wraps!! Thanks for this awesome recipe.  It made the list of my top 30 favorite recipes!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I substitute 1 cup of lentils with 1 cup diced, cooked potatoes.  I also use fresh diced tomatoes instead of tomato puree.

I loved it.  A guest really liked it.  My husband thought it was okay but would prefer we try it next time not pureed.  My daughter thought we should feed it to her baby sister.  Will make it again.  Perhaps w/ a bit more lentil if not pureed.

I was really excited to try this as I smelled it cooking.  My husband and I both like lentils and love curry and spicy dishes, but we found this to be just so so.  I doubled the spices except for the salt which I cut back a bit per others reviews, and it was still not that flavorful.  It was spicy, yes, but not in a flavorful way.  Also, although there was nothing complicated about it, and it was relatively quick, I thought that dirtying 3 pans (lentils, onions/curry, rice to serve over) just wasn't worth it.  Will not make again.

I made this the other night for guests and it turned out extremely spicy. However, this is my own fault as I got a bit over-zealous with the cayenne pepper I was adding....I love spice but I added too much to handle! I will be making this again, but I will tone down the heat next time.

Wow! A quick, easy, super tasty, and healthy vegetarian dish. I prefer to use chopped fresh tomatoes, but the canned ones work in a pinch. It's also very easy to adjust the heat level to preference. I am sure that I will be making this dish again and again.

Good.  I'd double the tomato sauce so there is more liquid.  And I cut down on the curry paste/powder (less than half) and it was still plenty hot!

This was delicious!! The good thing about using red lentils is that they cook very quickly. I had this dish together in about a half hour from start to finish. I took suggestions from other reviewers and replaced the tomato puree with a 14.5 oz can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes. I also added a cup and a half of frozen peas at the end. Otherwise I followed the directions as written. Served with hot garlic naan. I will definitely be making this again!

Raisins make a delicious addition to this recipe! I did not have tomato puree and had to substitute with a fresh tomato. Would have been better with the puree I'm sure. Tasty recipe after I increased the spice amounts to my preferred level.

Awesome! 

I'm a uni student who tries to steer clear of meat if I can, and this dish is a godsend. Absolutely yummy AND there's enough here to feed me for a long while :)

That being said, I did tweak the recipe a bit. I added twice as much garlic and I didn't have tomato puree on hand, so I used canned chopped tomatoes instead. I also added some peas to vary the texture a little more. It still came out great. The flavour is just so warm and inviting!

PS. I read a review on here that said that this curry doesn't reheat very well. Well, being a student I cook in bulk and reheat my food all the time; In my opinion this curry was just fine the next day. 

 Thank you for this amazing recipe.

Great tasting and easy to make! I've tried this recipe as is and love it, but love it even more when I add some extra veggies like red pepper, celery and sometimes spinach to the onions when I caramelize them! It adds extra nutrients and delicious flavours!

This dish was  horrible reheated. I made it the night before, and it smelled sooooooo good, but then reheated it for dinner the next day. I'm not sure what it tastes like right off the stove, but don't reheat this recipe!

Fast, easy curry. Flavor is delicious. I just added a chopped tomato to the curry mixture for some extra testure otherwise kept this exactly as written. Now, my 11yr old may find this a tad too hot for his taste buds so if your children don't like some heat, adjust your quantities. He hasn't tasted it yet so we'll see :)
Looking forward to a bowl full tonight!!
Update: This was soooo good! I look forward to it even more tomorrow night when the flavors have time to soak into each other. My 11yr old loved it, not too hot for him; he had two helpings!

This came out really good. My husband loved it too. The only thing I did not add was the Chili powder (I was out). It still came out really good. I will make this again.

Amazing flavor, but felt a little dry.  I might add a little more tomato puree next time.

Excellent in it's own right. 
I also do a standard Lentil soup ( Carrots, Potato's ) 
and use the spices defined here ( ok I dropped the paste and add 2 tbl of Curry powder.) and it rocks.

Delicious lentil dish with no modifications needed. This has become a weekly meal in our family. Our 1-year old loves it as well (although I serve it at just a little warmer than room temperature for our kids to take off the edge of the spicy heat). Also, I do like it mushy, so I am rather liberal with the amount of water. Yummy dish!

I've been meaning to try lentils for a long time.  I just went vegan, so here it goes:  I had all the ingredients except tomato puree so I used fire-roasted diced tomatoes.  I overcooked the lentils, but that didn't seem to matter.  I would like it a little spicier and with more sauce.  Next time I will cut the lentils in half (instead of doubling spices--it made a lot!), find something hotter than Patar's mild curry paste and pick up some Indian chili powder.  YUM.

Excellent Lentil dish.  So good, my hubby even ate it without his usual covering of hot chili garlic oil!  To be diabetic diet-friendly, I substituted raw coconut crystals for the white sugar-low glycemic index, no coconut flavoring, just sweet  & granular. We will have this one again!

I have never cooked lentils before. When I first took a bite of this, I thought... Yummy, but I'll probably be tired of it in a few bites. I was so wrong! This was wonderful. Served it over white rice. Can't wait to make it again.

I've made this recipe a handful of times now and it keeps getting better and better! I use yellow lentils and double the sugar and spices and it's still delicious. One time I didn't have tomato puree and used a can of regular tomato sauce instead. The sauce made the lentils thinner, which I preferred when put over rice. If eaten alone or as a side the thickness of the puree works well. SO easy!

This recipe was great! My wife and I loved the flavors and I can't wait to make it again! I had never cooked Indian food before but the laundry list of seasonings was still no trouble just as promised. the only change I made was I added some cubed chicken before the lentils.

This dish is high on flavor and nutrition,  yet still healthy. I'm a fan since it was easy to make and delicious.  As people suggested I used the fire roasted tomatoes and a small amount of  tomato sauce.  It is a bit confusing that it doesn't indicate which type of curry paste, but we used mild green curry paste and it worked very well.

The first time I made this dish it was really dry so I tried it again and the second time it was EXCELLENT. I halved the entire recipe (yield 4) and then added 1/2 cup of cooked peas right before serving (I had frozen peas that I cooked in the microwave). I also used a can of diced tomatoes (and their juice) instead of the tomato puree and used brown lentils (Chana Dal). My husband and friend loved it, and even our 10 month old daughter ate some & liked it! It's not spicy/hot it's got a sort of sweet flavor so it was perfect. This is definitely going into my regular recipe rotation. Thanks Emma!!

Very very very good! I didn't use onions (used a little extra garlic instead), and I used a mix of split mung beans and red lentils, but it turned out so tasty!

This was a wonderful last minute dish I decided to make and it turned out wonderful. I searched red beans to figure out what to do with my red beans and this recipie popped up. I used half the amount of chilli powder since my kids were eating this as well. My son loved it so much I packed him some leftovers for his lunch. My 5 year old didnt even complain (which says alot) although i picked the onions out of hers. Overall I will for sure be making this again....thanks

I couldn't find red lentils so, I used green ones instead. The taste is heavily dependent on the curry paste and curry powder you use, so use your favourite, for sure. Overall great vegetarian curry. Will be making it again, especially when I find red lentils.

Very good but wound up adding a couple things. Some crushed chilis for extra spice, extra chili powder, some paprika and a little extra tomato. I used a LITTLE extra ketchup at the time because I didn't have anything else but extra sauce/paste or some chopped tomatoes would have been nice! A  very delicious and filling meal though. Good for making and eating throughout the week. I've been eating mine on basmati, soo good!

This is a good recipe, but it turned out a bit dry, even when I used canned tomatoes and not tomato puree. I think I would add a few more tomatoes (maybe a can and a half of stewed tomatoes). It also seems like it would be an easy recipe to sneak a few more vegetables into, e.g., some spinach and a bit of cauliflower might be a good addition. 

Overall, though, when combined with basmati rice, it makes an excellent work lunch, and it freezes well, so you can cook a lot at once and then enjoy it over time.

I overcooked my lentils, so I kind of mashed it up. The texture was a little off, but the taste was 100% there. I used my own curry powder.  I also used a little less oil, and 1/2 olive oil, 1/2 veggie oil. I will definitely make this again.

This was a great recipe.  I added a can of coconut milk to the curry base.  It really made the flavor more full like adding cream to a sauce.

This was really good. We hosted an Indian themed summer cookout and this was a hit. Unfortunately for me it was a bit too spicy. But I'm not sure which one of the spices it was that made it too hot. :(

This recipe was good but boring for Indian food. I expected it to be a lot more spicy, but I think it got overpowered by the tomato puree. I also had way too many lentils, they expand when you cook them. Just one cup lentils would have been enough.

I thoroughly loved this dish served on brown Basmati rice. I followed the recipe very closely the first time I made it and will in the future, also. I did use 3 rather large cloves of garlic, and probably more than 1 tsp fresh ginger. Have to watch those lentils and not let them overcook. I had a heads-up on that from a friend who had made this recently, so mine came out pretty much just right. In the future, I'll start the (brown) rice at least 10-15 minutes prior to the rest of this recipe, then the onions, then start cooking the already-rinsed lentils.

This was absolutely fantastic!!! I didn't have curry paste so I didn't use and just doubled the curry powder (I had garam masala powder on hand) I also didn't have a can of tomato puree, but used a small can of pizza sauce instead (I was a wee bit worried about this, but it turned out just fine!) I liked it so much I have already picked up the curry paste and tomato puree so I can do the recipe exactly next time. It was pretty spicy, and as someone who likes things generally 'medium' spicy, this was just the right amount; and I served it over white rice - perfectly delicious!

Really good flavors, sauce was a bit too thick if you ask me. Would maybe do 3/4 of the tomato puree and do sause for the other 1/4. Instead of lentils I browned some beef cubes in flour and oil, made the sauce, poured it over, and let it cook in the oven at 325 for about 2 hours. Was delish.

This was pretty good.  Not the best lentil curry I've made, but I did like it and my fiance and I both ate it.  Plus, we had leftovers, which is good because we are both too busy during the week to spend a long time cooking.  I also threw in a diced red bell pepper along with the onion to give it a little more flair.

Very delicious and easy dish. I gave it 4 stars because of 2 things. I needed to increase the amount of spice to get a real good flavor and also perhaps I was just cooking to fast or plain old dumb...but the 2 cups of lentils is the total "cooked" amount NOT 2 cups of dry lentils.

Good stuff, made this recipe as directed and it turned out great.  Also in case anyone is wondering, using tomato paste instead of puree doesn't work correctly - however just add some water.  Good stuff! I hope to post a variant without curry paste.

Very good recipe. I didnt have tumeric or red lentils so I used green ones which worked fine just made for a weird color. Also I used petite dices tomatoes instead of puree and added cayane pepper to add more spice!

Great recipe! This was my first attempt at making Indian food and both my husband and I loved it! I used the full amount of curry paste and it wasn't too spicy ( I used yellow curry paste). I also added a peeled and diced apple, which was also yummy! I will make this again and may try adding some other veggies, like peas or carrots.

Have made this recipe a few times now, in it's original form and also with tinned lentils, tinned chickpeas, tinned tomatoes - every time it's been WONDERFUL!! A great recipe to try if you're starting out with curry making as it's really simple and scrummy. It's become a regular dish in our house - thanks for sharing Emma!

Delicious!! I would definitely make this again! I used tomato sauce instead of puree & 1/2 tsp of ground ginger instead of fresh (that's what I had on hand) but otherwise stuck to the recipe and it was incredibly flavourful! Served over steamed rice. One recommendation - don't cook before you go out anywhere because you will stink like curry for hours after making this. lol and the leftover curry makes a great substitution for salsa with nacho chips

Delicious!  I'm a big curry fan and like to cook curry dishes a couple times a month.  This one is by far my favorite.  I used hot curry paste, crushed tomatoes, instead of pureed, and added some spinach, then served over rice.

I have never made lentils before so at first I was a little intimidated, but this recipe made it very easy.  The spices were wonderful and I will make this again.  I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I definitely need a lesson in lentil cooking, but nevertheless this turned out flavorful. It's consistency was much like thick paste (due to my lentils dying in the pot) but it was great with pita slices. The flavor and texture do not make this an entree, so make sure you have plenty of people to nibble on it.

Very authentic Indian flavor.  Very easy and quick to make.  Makes a lot, and reheats really easily.  Will be making this regularly.

I cooked 2 C of lentils but thought it was too much-that I'd lose the great flavor-so I cut the lentil measure in 1/2.  I accidentally forgot the sugar and salt (shoot) and used diced tomatoes instead of puree, but other than that did it as written.  Next time I will try to remember to heat the spice in oil the way a reviewer mentioned (the way I saw it done in India) This dish is so aromatic and yummy.  Served mine w/ basmati rice w/ frozen mixed veggies.  Don't mix it too much into the rice though, you will lose the yummy flavor-serve it more side by side. HyVee carries the curry paste in my area.  If you Google curry paste, you can find a store in your area that carries it.  Worth getting!

This was pretty good! I overcooked the lentils and they are cemented on the bottom of the pot, but that's clearly my own fault! This wasn't too spicy at all, and even though my lentils were "mushy" or whatever, the texture was great. I ate this mixed with fresh spinach.  The only complaint I have about this recipe is that it definitely did not make EIGHT main meal servings. I got 3 out of it.

I thought this dish was going to be so good based on all the good reviews, but either I must have done something wrong or it was just plain nasty to me. The seasoning mixture was way too strong for my taste and as few mentioned, the lentils become a big mush, which doesn't even look appetizing. My kids also agreed .

Very nice curry and dead easy to prepare. I added in some frozen peas as well as some broccoli leaves to make the meal more balanced. I served it with some basmarti rice and yoghurt. A lovely and very quick dinner!

Absolutely great recipe! My lentils turned out a little bit mushy but it was still really delicious! Also, it is soo easy and can be modified in so many ways! Next time I will add more veggies and see how that turns out! Thanks for the great post!

This was very tasty.  I wanted do fit some veggies in so I added spinach.  I also like my curries with yogurt so I added a couple big spoonfuls of that.  I also think that it should have more curry paste, garlic, ginger and a touch more sugar than the recipe calls for.

Wonderfully flavorful!  I used mild curry powder and mild Patak's curry paste so my toddler could have some too and this recipe was a hit all around the table.  :)  Also, I used powdered ginger instead of fresh, doubled the amount of lentils, onions and tomato puree and we will have leftovers for a couple of days.  Great stuff.

The sauce was amazing!  I don't know if I did something wrong but it seemed like I didn't have enough sauce for the amount of lentils, it got really thick instead of saucy, but the taste was great.

Holy cow!  This recipe is AMAZING!  I did not have curry paste, so I added extra minced garlic, ginger, turmeric, onion, and curry powder ... also about a tablespoon of finely chopped jalapeno.  The way this recipe is laid out and explained leaves nothing to the imagination.  I love the way Emma organized it.  I don't have a sieve or a mesh strainer/colander, so I lost about half of my lentils when I tried draining them from the pot.  My boyfriend was on the way home so I quickly cubed 4 potatoes and sliced 2 carrots to compensate for the lentils which met their fate in the sink.  It turned out fantastic!  My boyfriend and roommate loved it!  I loved it!  Thanks so much, Emma, for sharing such a great and well-laid out recipe!  You are awesome!

This was very good!  I think mine came out a little dry though.  It needs just a little something else.  I used green lentils and added spinach, and it was still delicious!  (just didn't look as pretty LOL) I  added some water to compensate for the dryness.  Next time im going to use diced canned tomatoes and not the paste.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! We used green lentils and a can of diced tomatoes and chiles instead of just tomatoes (which we threw in the blender). Didn't have tumeric, but added coriander. Used garlic and ginger powder instead of fresh. I will definitely be making this again, perhaps with potatoes instead of lentils next time....mmmmm

Couldn't find red lentils so I used brown boring lentils. The only kind I could find! Anyway it still turned out good, although it doesn't look beautiful. It took my lentils a little more than 20 minutes to cook. And don't skimp on the water too much when you're cooking them.

Had this for lunch with my leftover homemade garlic/butter naan. It was fulfilling and will be on my favorite lentil dish list. I love curry and turmeric together. Next time, I will use fire roasted tomatoes as other reviewers suggested.

Its hard to go wrong with this if you love lentils (especially red lentils) like I do. Its the ultimate comfort food - think it will taste even better in the winter :)  I found a great wholemeal garlic & cilantro naan bread recipe (unfortunately not on this site) - the combo was awesome - god I love food! :)

Just made this recipe, substituting fire-roasted tomatoes for tomato puree. It's by far the best curry I've made. We ate it with garlic naan and raita. My husband, daughter, and parents LOVED it. Thanks for a wonderful, meatless main course!

This was excellent, I added some caviar d'aubergine (eggplant caviar) for fun and it turned out great. I've make the recipe every time I have lentils sitting around.

Very Good!! made almost exactly as directed, however I made it a couple of hours prior to serving and then reheated, mostly so that the flavors would have a bit of time. - also added 1 more tsp of salt, and used pwdr ginger as I had no fresh stuff on hand. Used Red curry paste and a 6oz can of tomato paste with 6oz of water added to it. Served it on Basmati Rice and we all enjoyed it.... even my 2 yr old! :)

This was a great and easy recipe.  I did change a bit.  I doubled both curries, thanks to other reviews.  I also added fresh tomatoes with some tomato paste and a 6oz can of coconut milk. I think that this was the BEST lentil curry dish I have ever had.  LOVED IT!

Wow!  I was a little intimidated, but this was so easy to make and SO delicious!  I used a mild curry paste and mild curry powder, but next time I think I might use the hot versions to give it a little kick.  Will DEFINITELY make again!

I've never made a curry, and this was a great success on the first try! I substituted canned diced tomatoes for the tomato paste, and I used this recipe for the curry paste. All told it was very spicy, but with some raita on the side it all worked out okay. It may take you some trial & error to get the spice level where you want it.

I love curry and thought this was very tasty. I followed the recipe minus the turmeric just because i didn't have any. I will definitely make this again. I ate this with whole grain naan bread i found at the store. Tomorrow i eat this with rice. Yum!

This recipe is FANTASTIC! Tastes just like what we get from the restaurant down the street. The only thing I did differently was to use crushed tomatoes instead of pureed because I like the texture of the tomato pieces. I served it with yogurt and jasmine rice. This recipe is a new favorite!

This recipe came together very quickly and was delicious. I wasn't sure what type of curry paste to use and didn't want it to come out too spicy, so I used 1 tablespoon Thai red curry paste, which is pretty spicy, and 1 tablespoon Thai yellow curry paste, which is pretty mild. The combination was just the right amount of heat for me.

Flavor is WONDERFUL and it contains "superfoods"! Curry paste and turmeric are supposed to be cancer and Alzheimers fighters.  Lentils are considered a superfood also.  Google "superfoods" and you'll see.  i've made this a few time and love it, but i can't seem to eat it all before it goes bad.  Too labor intensive to cut down the recipe--but i just read that lentils freeze well, so i'm jazzed now.

Amazing!  I love this.  I am actually eating it right now.  My first attempt at this sort of recipe.  I love the spicy.  Found the ginger root at a local store.  Took a while, but I found the curry paste there as well. Used red because I like spicier.  Used organic, brown whole-grain basmati rice.  Would recommend this to just about anyone.

very tasty! as suggested by other users, i doubled up on the spices (but halved the salt), used powered garlic and ginger because that's what i had on hand, used diced tomatoes, used 3 small onions and tossed in 1/2 bag of frozen peas. boiled the lentils for ~ 5minutes until i realized there was not enough room in the pot so i moved it to a slow cooker until the lentils were soft (~30 min to 1 hr). drained and added curry mix and let it sit in the slow cooker for a while.  yum! tasty by itself but a naan or some rice would have been nice

Really easy to make...next time I'll probably add some more vegetables to it and maybe adjust some of the spices. My only chili powder is pretty spicy so I think I'll cut that in half and maybe add more minced ginger. Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome! But, I recommend you let it simmer on medium/med-low for a long time. Before i did this I thought it was bland

very good. Although I think you'd need more tomato. I reduced the amt of lentils by half but kept the tomatoes the same. I also sauteed cumin seeds with the onion and toward the end added some english peas. Yummy. This will be a part of our regular rotation.

WOW!!  This recipe exceeded my expectations.  My one and only complaint(easily remedied) is that it was not spicy enough for my taste.  Instead of the traditional "curry" powder from the grocery store, I used garam masala powder and paste.  So delicious, can't wait to make again.

Terrific dish! Served with Carrot Rice recipe from this site. It could have been spicier, but that's just our taste. I'll be making this dish again, thanks!

I used yellow curry paste, and a can of diced tomatoes rather than puree.  It was delicious!  Maybe both puree and diced tomatoes would be even better...  I plan to experiment with different curry pastes (masaman, red) to see which one is best, but I'll bet they're all tasty in their own way.  Thanks for a great lentil recipe which works well as a side or a vegetarian main course.

Great recipe. I used red curry paste and omitted the chili powder, just enough spice. It's a bit more soupy than I would prefer, but next time I'll just shorten the cook time on the lentils. I also added a handful of fresh cilantro, it was a perfect additional taste!

This was delicious! This was also the first time I had ever made curry or used lentils and I am certainly going to make this again.  I used a can of Italian Tomatoes instead of the fresh tomato and it was wonderful.  My husband, who by the way is not too crazy over new and different food, loved it and had seconds!

This is the best lentil curry I've found! Even my non-lentil eating husband said to make this again. Only thing I might change next time is to add less lentils. I like it a little saucier.

I followed the recipe but doubled the garlic as other people suggested.  I also pureed the final product and served with rice and peas.  Very good and flavorful.  The whole family liked it and the house smelled wonderful!

I just finished making this and it couldn't be yummier.  I had no curry paste (I know, I suck) so used some extra powder instead, but I ran out of that too and added a bit of garam masala to compensate.  I followed the recipe for everything else except I used only half the required salt, and since I didn't have tomato puree I replaced it with leftover spaghetti sauce & some cooking cream.  Overall I'm amazed at how simple it can be to make a really delicious and nutritious meal!

Wow, delicious! I had to use the ingredients I had on hand, but it still came out really really well. I used 2 cans of tomato sauce instead of tomato paste, green lentils, and no tumeric since I didn't have any. I think that this recipe is such an amazing base that it can handle LOTS of tweaking!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe!  The only change I made was that I substituted the ginger with galangal.  The only change I will make next time is to half the recipe, since its just the two of us, and this makes a lot of curry!  We had this with raita, chapati bread and curried cauliflower; it was a great meal!

I followed the recipe exactly and used mild curry paste, and still it was a bit spicy because of the chili powder, but perfect flavor. Not too spicy for kids. My kids actually looved it! I halved the recipe, and still it was a lot, so I'm glad I did! Served with basmati rice and simple salad. Great flavors, but I felt like it lacked a bit of texture. Next time, I will add some chicken pieces into it, cuz while eating it, I kept feeling that chicken would have been perfect in it! Great base though, thanks a lot for sharing!

Yummy, one of the best lentil dishes I have ever made.  I added zucchini, orange pepper, and a couple serrano peppers for texture and spice.  I didn't have any curry paste.

I browned the onions and then threw it all in my slow cooker on low for 4 hours.

**hot *** this should have a few little hot chillis by it because it is really spicy but delicious! It is not very soupy because thelentils absorb so much liquid, I might try doubling the tomatos next time which would hopefully tame the flame.

This recipe got such good ratings from others, I'm wondering if I did something wrong. I thought it was ok, a little lacking in flavor, but ok.  My husband and daughter thought it was way too spicy.

Very good, and looking forward to making again with all the good variations I'm reading in the other reviews.  There are so many types of curry paste to use, so just changing that alone will give a different twist.  I left out the teaspoon of salt thinking I can add it later if needed, but I didn't add any (the curry paste was quite salty).

Excellent. Super spicy - and we like spicy. I used chopped tomatoes in a can for puree. I have a feeling I'll be making it a lot from now on - healthy, cheap, tasty- what's not to like?

I used this recipe as a guide, and made a few alterations due to what I had on hand. I was making a half recipe, so I used a small onion; I didn't have turmeric; and I used jarred minced ginger. I also still used the full can of tomatoes (fire-roasted) despite halving the rest of the ingredients. Cooking the lentils in chicken broth adds a little richness, but it's easily done without. Do make sure to rinse the lentils very well.  It's a really good basic red lentil dal recipe - I serve it over brown basmati rice and with a tablespoon of yogurt on top to help cut the heat a little. It makes a TON - maybe I don't eat that much, but the half-recipe I made will feed me for at least six meals, not four. It's also quite good with a hardboiled egg sliced up on top.

this is delicious. I make it at least once a month.  I couldn't find red lentils at my supermarket and I had to cook the lentils for at least an hour. The last time I made this recipe I used red lentils from an Indian market and only cooked them for 20 minutes.

This was missing some flavor. I added 1 t cinnamon and halved the turmeric because I don't like it, but there was some background flavor that was missing. Maybe cooking the lentils in broth would have helped. I used Muir Glenn fire roased chunky tomatoes for extra flavor.

This was not as awesome as I thought based on the reviews. Perhaps the problem was that I used fresh chili instead of chili powder. It was very hot, but didn't have enough flavour. When I heated the rest the next day I added some coconut cream, which made all the difference. With the coconut it was totally divine! I couldn't get enough of it, and neither could the hubby :-)

Very good with a spice that sneaks up on you.  This is very healthy, I made it all organic and take some for lunch every day along with some yogurt to cool down my taste buds.

Excellent recipe.  I loved everything about it.  My husband is normally skeptical of anything involving lentils, but even he really loved it and spontaeously raved about it.  The heat level of the spices is just right and it is really yummy with some basmati rice and naan bread.

It's a versatile base for adding other ingredients that you like too - I've added canned diced tomatoes and jumbo shrimp, as suggested by another reviewer, with great results.  I think peas, chickpeas or potatoes would work well too.  

Thanks for such a healthy, yummy and inexpensive recipe that I'll make again and again!

Yummy!  My lentils dissolved in the cooking water, but the end result was still very savoury and delicious.  I used a can of tomatoes instead of pureed tomatoes and mashed them up with a spoon.  I also didn't have curry paste so used curry powder instead.  Still turned out great.  Will make again.

So tasty! This had the right amount of spice and was a great way to prepare for work lunches -- I made this the night before my work week started and I had a few lunches ready to take in. The leftovers just get better because the spices really marinate.

The flavors on this were just right - it was delicious.  I didn't use the curry paste because the paste I had was Thai and I didn't think it would match the Indian theme of the dish.  I added 2 extra Tbsp of curry powder and some extra garlic instead.  Yum!

This recipe turned out very good and spicy. I was not sure if I had rinsed the lentils well before cooking so I just rinsed them with cold water afterwards. They didn't come out mushy at all. I didn't use tumeric but it came out great. I also followed another review's advice and substituted lemon juice for the sugar. Great with some brown rice and raita!

This is really delicious. If you make enough, you don't need to serve it with rice, it is perfect and filling on its own with some nice indian bread and a fresh salad. Even my picky younger sister likes it!

Pretty good!  I used tomato sauce instead of puree.  And I was lazy and put all of the spices directly into the onions instead of mixing them separately - one less bowl to clean. And lesson learned...watch those lentils or they become mush!

This recipe was easy to make, and just as good as anything I've ordered from the Indian restaurant down the street.  There is also a lot of flexibility - I didn't have all of the spices, and didn't measure particularly carefully, just did everything to taste, and it turned out great!  I also added some chopped carrots for extra vitamins.

This is now a family favorite. It has passed the "guests for dinner" test as well. It is SO tasty, easy and wholesome. I sent leftovers to a friend's strict veggie college-age daughter and she called long distance to say how much she loved it.

Well, I'll say up front, I have no idea how authentic this is.  As relatively new vegetarians, my family is always on the look out for satisfying food with ingredients I've heard of, that I can find in the supermarket.  
     This recipe delivers.  We used fresh tomato puree and added diced tomatoes at the end, as we had a very successful tomato garden this year.  Also, I didn't have any curry paste, but probably would have left it out anyway so that our 3 year old could eat it.   I added a bit more garlic to compensate.   It was a hit at our house over brown rice.

Wonderful! I have always been wary of trying to cook Indian recipes because they seem so complicated, but this was so easy and delicious. I made it last night and am still thinking about it today. I think the key is a good curry paste which I didn't know about until I went to my local Indian store. This is definitely added to my "make again" list. Thanks!

Yum!  Will make again.  Boiled lentils for 2 minutes then simmered with lid for another 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
As suggested by another, I used fire-roasted tomatoes in place of puree.  I doubled ginger and garlic.  I omitted chili powder by mistake, but didn't miss it and found it to have just enough spice anyway.  Added 1/2 cup chicken broth at the same time as the tomatoes for a looser consistency.  Served over rice that had been made with chicken broth and lemon zest and sprinkled with chopped cilantro.  May add steamed green peas to serve next time.

Very nice recipe!  I did add about a tablespoon of lemon juice to enhance flavors and eliminated the sugar. I also added some shredded chicken to satisfy my husband. Cooks up fast. I also used chicken broth to cook my lentils since I had it on hand.

The easiest dish I've put together recently!!  I can understand how some lentils can get cooked to "mush" and even though I've never cooked red lentils before today, I knew that looking at them and watching them cook that 15 minutes would be too long of a cook time for mine.  I barely made it to 10 minutes and they were done - but I kept watching them.  A recipie is a guide - not the gospel.  Need to pay attention to what you're working on.

Very good!  I made a double batch.  I used a half can of full fat coconut milk and I did not regret it.  Sooo yummy. Will make again and again.

Delicious, spice it up or spice it down, you can't go wrong. I did add double the amount of fire roasted tomatoes and fresh ginger. I shared this recipe with a WW friend and she loves it too.

Am I the only one who ended up with way too many lentils for the amount of sauce? I would say this recipe either needs half the lentils or at least one more can of tomato puree.

i ended up using cumin seeds because i didn’t have ground cumin and also added chickpeas, serrano pepper, extra chili powder and cayenne because we like spicy. i also used canned tomatoes instead of purée. everyone loved it.

This was sooo good! I didn't intend to make any changes but...I did not have curry paste but did have a 15oz jar of Patak's  curry simmer sauce. So I omitted the tomato puree and just used the Patak's curry sauce and it was delish. This is a keeper. Will definitely be making again.

I made half the amount by simply halving the measurements of everything. It turned out perfectly and tasted amazing! I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used powdered. The whole peeled tomatoes that I had in the cupboard was immersion blended for the puree ingredient.
The dried spices see the hardest part, and since I didn't have curry paste, I just skipped it, and it still tasted great! I'll make this again, for sure!

This is quick, easy, and yummy, plus I love that I’m using only 1 Tbsp of oil with all of these  healthy ingredients!   I’m relatively new to Indian food, so I just used the Thai Kitchen red curry paste that they had at my regular grocery store (it comes in a little jar...who knew?).  The end result was wonderfully flavorful with just a wee bit of a kick.  I also followed another reviewer’s recommendation and used petite diced tomatoes because I love them.  This might have been why my sauce  seemed a bit dry for all the lentils that I cooked (2 cups of dry made about 4 cups cooked), so I stirred in a little more water to get it to a nice consistency, then added only about 2 cups of the cooked lentils.   Yum!  I’m going to make a second batch with the leftover lentils since everyone says it freezes well.  Thank you Emma for a great recipe!

This has become a regular in our house!  It's easy to make, freezes well, and great for lunches with Jasmine rice.
My only advice is to season liberally.

I used my Instapot to cook the lentils (two minutes on high pressure). The Instapot can also be used to sauté the onions and spices before adding the lentils and cooking. I added in the tomato purée after I cooked everything. It was incredibly quick and easy, and very tasty!

This is well seasoned, but the cooking time for the lentils was really long. They ended up mushy and waterlogged so I had to drain them before adding them to the rest of the recipe. Once everything was together, it was very tasty. I added three tablespoons of coconut milk to two servings to smooth the texture and add a little more sweetness, which was delicious. Didn’t eat with rice or other starch, but did crave some hot naan to scoop it with.

I just made this and it is very delicious. However, I made a little change to it: I used half the tomato paste and added vegetable broth to cook the lentils and the onion and spices mix,  on low heat for about 15 minutes so everything became well blended together.

Just made this tonight for the first time and it was amazing. Really easy and tasty. I did add green peppers as another reviewer suggested, mostly because I had one that wasn't going to keep much longer anyway. For the British people here, instead of tomato purée I used Pasata. I think that might be what Americans call purée anyway, because when you watch the video it doesn't look like what we call purée at all. Plus there's no way I would put that much tomato purée in anything! This will definitely become a regular meal for me.

Very good.  I made it with one 6oz can of tomato paste and one 14oz can of diced tomatoes, as I felt it would be too thick otherwise.  The red lentils were hard to locate - but found them in the Indian section at Wegmans.  Dish was not very spicy with the curry paste and powder I used.  Will definitely make again!

It was good! To reiterate, I am sure your product depends on your curry paste and curry you use. I did not have curry paste so added coriander and cumin to my taste... Easy and very amenable to tweeking to your own personal tastes!

Made it exactly as written.   I too overcooked the lentils.   I'll definitely make this again without the lentils and use the sauce over basmati rice.  The flavor is amazing.

A satisfying and filling bowl of soup!   For me,  it seemed to need acid...I added about a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to the batch at the end and it balanced the flavors.   Lime and cilantro might also be good.

This was an easy and delicious recipe. I didn’t have Indian curry paste so I used Thai red curry paste but only 1/2 T.  because it’s spicy.  I also had some roma tomatoes that needed to be used so I added those chopped up. It turned out great and tastes good with cucumber raita and chapati.

This recipe THE BEST. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve made it. As written, the recipe is DELICIOUS. But over the years, I’ve played around with it a lot too. I prefer to use fresh juicy tomatoes rather than canned purée, and I usually add extra curry powder if I don’t have curry paste. One time we accidentally added a TOOON of chili powder, so we added zucchini slices to try to tone the spice down. Haha Good times!!

This was delicious.  I used hot curry paste and a large can of tomato puree to cut down the spice just a touch.  Turned out perfect.  My boyfriend was impressed at how full he felt without eating meat.

This has become a staple in our house.  Our hard-to-please pescatarian nephew loves it.  I serve it with simply broiled salmon or steelhead and spinach.  Thanks to the reviewer who clued me in to the shorter cook time (10 minutes or less) on red lentils, otherwise it would have been mush.  Took  the hint to use fire roasted tomatoes instead of the purée which adds another dimension.  This being Minnesota I use a very mild curry paste which pleases everyone.  A mild bite, just enough to make it interesting.

I enjoyed this although I did cook my red lentils for half the time. It came out very tasty but  for myself I upped the spices. They were perfect for the rest of my clan! Thank you, I enjoy keeping this in my fridge for lunches during the week.

I'm eating it right now — it's so good. I didn't have any chili powder but I also accidentally added 1 tsp ground cayenne (which I guess counts as chili powder?) so it all worked out. I ended up using tika curry paste. It's not terribly spicy but it's oh so very nice.

I think I ended up using brown lentils (bag didn’t specify), and I had to substitute dried thyme leaves for curry leaves and green onions for regular onions....but it still turned out good! I suspect I should’ve soaked the lentils before cooking, because I ended up simmering the curry for a loooong time until they were good and tender. But overall the curry still turned out well!

This is good, but a little bland for our tastes. I added a teaspoon of coriander, doubled the ginger, added 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. I also added about 1/4 cup of vegetable broth because I thought it was a bit thick. I topped with fresh cilantro. I served over brown rice, and my husband loved it for lunch.

This was my first time cooking lentils. The lentils were mush after 20 minutes however since this was my first time cooking them I don’t know if that’s normal. After 20 minutes cararmelizing the onions they were black and not edible. The curry seasoning mixture should have been separated. Adding the garlic to the caramelized onions and letting them become fragrant would have been better than biting into raw garlic. With a 4 1/2 star rating I really high hopes for this recipe.

This turned out way too thick and bland. It needs coconut milk or something to liquify it and make it a bit fattier. Also, if I made it again I would use an extra tablespoon of curry paste and chopped fresh tomatoes instead.

This was a very nice dish, everyone in my family liked it.  I added an extra TBSP of curry paste for more flavor.

I blended the onion before I sauteed it which made the sauce even smoother. I added cayenne spice instead of curry paste. I served it over rice and it was wonderful. Would make it again, thanks for posting it!

Great! I did not have the curry paste so I used an extra tablespoon of curry and 1 tbsp of Madera Hot Curry. I used 5 fresh tomatoes pureed in the blender in place of the tomato paste. Per one of the reviews, I cooked the lentils a shorter amount of time. I was perfect for my husband. I would have made it a bit warmer myself. My husband had it over bean threads while I had it over tofu. It does grow in your stomach so beware! Three hours later I am still full!

I made this for the first time, I didn't have curry paste so I increased the curry powder like one reviewer suggested. It was wonderful and I topped it with a dollop of sour cream. We are trying to do more complex carbs do to diabetic study eating more lentils lowers over all blood sugar levels.

Followed recipe as stated. Awesome flavor and will make it again. Used 2 cups unmade red lentils and made about triple the amount.  Flavor was still good. 
Made this at the fire station for the crew and they all loved it.   My favorite dish so far. Stick to the spices and don’t substitute anything.

I actually tried to eat this by adding some cilantro and sour cream but I couldnt get past the watery and mushy texture. Also, this did not taste like curry to me. The spices reminded me of the chilli my dad makes every winter.r.

First attempt and it became a favourite for my 16 yrs old.
Cook it once a month usually with crispy chicken thighs (another allrecipes' s recipe)
Spicy but not too much and healthy, also very easy and quick to make.
Love it

Too much onion in the recipe.
tomato puree was not available in my area so I tried Pizza Sauce. 
Slightly on the dry side. 
Might try again but use some diced tomatoes and hopefully can find tomato puree. There are 5 basic Curry Pastes here in Thailand I will start from spiciest which is Green Curry sweet and spicy, then Red Curry, also quite spicy, Then Yellow, varies with coconut cream or spicier Gold and very spicy Elephant, gold & elephant are yellow minus the coconut cream, then there is  Massaman, based on Indian curry then finally my favorite Panang, a milder  more subtle flavor. 
I believe a nice sharp graded cheddar cheese may be nice, but takes away from the vegan idea, but I can care less about vegan or vegetarian

I thought this had way too much moisture to it , I added some mushrooms I also cooked my spices a bit first before adding the mushrooms and onion into it , really annoying measurements (one cup) I wish that it was in ounces as in British measurements too as its much easier, also Id prefer if you had said which curry paste! I only had one and that was Tikka paste so used that overall it was okay but I dont think Id make this particular one again

I've been looking for THAT ONE lentil recipe that has a ton of flavor, a bit of a punch, and doesn't need any meat  or broth for flavor.  This is close.  I was a unsure about curry paste though.  What exactly is curry paste, and where do you buy it?  I did have a red Thai curry paste in the fridge and used it, but wasn't quite sure if it was suitable or not.  It seemed that I mixed Indian and Thai and wasn't 100% convinced.  I will make it again but I'll try and find a different curry paste.

I have been looking for a recipe for a red lentil side dish for a long time and was excited to find this.  I read all the reveiws as I always do to give myself the best "first shot" at it.  I used all the spices plus 1/4 more of them.  Next time I will double the spices as others mentioned that they did.  The spice blend was SUPER but I found the end product a bit bland for our taste.  I think the fact that I put the lentils over a bed of brown rice took away from the overall end product and made it more bland so will not do that again.  I am going to try them but with just the lentils and no rice and more spices.   I will also use chicken stock when I cook the lentils for added flavor.  YUM.. the spices are YUMMY!!  Thanks for the recipe

Pair it with Cucumber Raita (or any yogurt based salad/sauce) and you'll be in heaven.  Mix in some frozen peas and  fresh cauliflower for some extra nutrition.  Tons of pungent flavors so it might be a hit or miss with kids.  Leave out the heat and just put some sriracha on the table if those you are serving aren't fans of spice.  All in all, great dish.

I made this as written, except for halving it for my small family and adapting it for the slow cooker. I par cooked the lentils, and cooked everything else as written, then tossed it all in the slow cooker on low for about six hours. Around hour four, I had to add some water to loosen it up a little and turn it down to “keep warm”.  I served it with a quinoa/brown rice mix in pita breads, which my husband dubbed “Indian tacos”. This one will go in the rotation. Thanks for sharing!

I didn’t have tomato purée so substituted tomatoes paste, diced tomato and 1/2 can of coconut milk. Left out the sugar. It was really great. I would have added some protein but none was on hand. (We’re cruising on our sailboat and the name of the game is “make due with what you have”.  I love the sites search feature to include what I have onboard and exclude what we don’t have/want). Really great recipe- you won’t be disappointed. Oh, I also added some cauliflower, diced celery and diced carrots.  Be creative!

I was heavy on the garlic.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  We tasted it right away and will have it with dinner this evening as a side dish.  Then I will serve again with rice.  My husband says it's a must make again.

I followed the recipe, which I don't usually do, because this was my first time cooking a curry. And lentils, for that matter.  I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't as much sauce as I was hoping for (a nice way of saying almost none), and I personally found the seasonings a bit bland. So, tonight, I'm making the sauce over again, doubling the spices, and adding it to the leftovers from last night, and I think it will be a big improvement. I had this with rice, naan bread, and cucumber raita. Thanks for a good starting off point.

This recipe was an instant hit and is on heavy rotation at our dinner table. It never ceases to amaze me how much this recipe yields from two cups of lentils!

Fragrant and flavorful! I made it just like the recipe. This is in our week night rotation for sure. It’s quick, and It makes enough for my husband and me to pack It for lunch, too!

I made it as is.  We're trying out new vegetarian dishes to try and eat healthier.  Can't say we loved it but we didn't hate it either.  Neither of us has ever eating lentils before.

I used hot madras curry powder, and this was one spicy delicious dish. I will use this a lot as a go-to vegetarian dish. It’d be great with rice or potatoes or a chewy hunk of bread. Oh and I didn’t have tomato purée, so used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes. Scrumptious.

We have never had Curry before. After trying the red curry paste while in Des Moines, I was eager for another recipe to try with it. I would say that this would be a "Beginners Curry" because it's not overwhelmingly spicy. The recipe says you can serve it with basmati rice. However, we like to live dangerously and we chose to eat ours with naan. I stayed pretty true to the recipe and the only change I made was using coconut palm sugar instead of white sugar. I couldn't tell the difference. Having never tried a Curry before, I can say that I would probably just add some more vegetables. Eggplant, mini sweet peppers and carrots would be good additions to this recipe.

Super Tasty!  I followed the recipe just as written & my husband loved it.  I stuffed the finished product into a couple of steamed green peppers and it was a complete dinner.  Next time I might experiment a little with Franks to increase the heat, but this is great as written and will be added to our regular menus.  Thanks!

This turned out very well! This is one of those recipes you can hardly mess up because it's quite versatile, so don't be afraid to adjust little things to suit your individual taste. :-) 
I am currently out of curry powder and white sugar, so I substituted garam masala and honey. I also put in a bit more sweetness than recommended (and salt to balance the flavor), and a bit less ginger, since I don't like to clearly taste ginger in Indian food. I am really happy with the result.  An easy, inexpensive and delicious dish! Five stars.

Came out tasting mostly like tomato, overpoweringly sweet, with very little of the curry coming through. I had to double the spices to make a dent in the tomato puree.

I love this recipe!  I recently started eating vegan and have been looking for a variety of recipes to use with lentils.  This one is at the top of my list.  I'm rating this following the recipe exactly.  I have made substitutions for certain things (ground ginger in place of fresh, etc.) at times and it is always still good.  I have found that I like my lentils a little more al dente so I usually only cook them for 8 min or so rather than 15.

Doubled this recipe for plenty of leftovers.  Glad I did because it is delicious!  Could not find the tomato puree, so I substituted 2 small cans of Tomato paste. Next time, I would use 1 small can tomato paste and a med/lg finely chopped tomato (or can of). Also added a 1/4  tsp to bring up the heat a bit. Will definitely be making this again!

Very good curry, not to spicy. Like one of the other reviewers said, the red lentils cook very quickly so once the water is boiling they are ready after about 8-10 minutes. Be careful not to overcook them or you will have a mushy curry.

This is definitely a winner. Made if for friends on two occassions and was a hit both times. Such good flavors that I'm sure you could put in whatever you want and it would be good. 
Served over favorite rice. I chose to top it with onion half rings sauteed with mustard seeds in olive oil, fresh cilatro, and a bit of fresh lemon juice.

I did everything as directed, but I had to make a few omissions/substitutions. I didn't have curry paste, so I left it out. I used spicy curry powder and only used half the amount so that it would only be a mildly spicy dish. Any more curry and my daughter would not be able to eat this. (It wouldn't be a good family dish I mean).

I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, turned out fine. I also cooked the lentils slightly less than recommended. I think the cooking time is too long in this recipe. You should check them at 10 min.

I didn't have tomato puree in the can, but I had 2 fresh tomatoes, I blended them for a few seconds and that essentially made a tomato puree. 

I went ahead and caramelized the onions, but they didn't turn out right. Either I cut them too big, or over fried them, they were sweet tasting, but some turned out a little crunchy. Next time, I'll not try to carmelize them, I'd prefer to just sauté them until tender. I would say 20 min is too ling, I'd cook for 10 minutes next time.

I did not have curry paste, but I had everything else.  When I drained the lentils, I drained most of the water out over the sink and then put the strainer with the lentils over the cooking pot.  What little collected in there, I added at the end to help thin it out as it was a bit too thick.  I put a lid on afterward to keep warm while the rest of the meal cooked.  I was very happy.  :)

Wonderful recipe, great for those cooler fall/winter days with some rice and naan. Helps to have some experience cooking lentils, would rate it as a medium skill level recipe, not necessarily for beginners.

Made this for the first time tonight and it was delicious! My only changes were fresh tomatoes instead of canned and I didn't have any curry powder so I didn't use any and lacked chili powder so used taco seasoning instead. Thanks so much for the great recipe - will definitely be making this again!

I enjoyed this.  I was looking for a way to make lentils taste good and this worked.  Having been to India, it's not as good as the food I tasted there but for a home American cook, it's not bad.  My husband liked it.  I will make it again.

This was quite tasty and filling. I followed another reviewers suggestion and used a can of diced, fire-roasted tomatoes in place of the tomato purée. Otherwise I followed the recipe,  adjusting the heat to suit our tastes. I served over cous cous. I will be making this again.

Rating 4 stars because I had to modify it, but with the changes it was absolutely delicious!

I went ahead and took the advice of other reviewers and doubled all spices (except salt & sugar). Then I added:

1 tsp ground coriander
1.5 tsp onion powder
1.5 tsp garam masala

I used tomato paste as I wasn't sure where to find tomato puree and it worked great. Be sure you rinse your lentils well and in a sieve rather than a strainer, so that you don't lose any down the sink.

Served on top of basmati rice, it was delicious. Very rich dish so don't need much of the curry with lots of rice. Fills for days.

What a lovely recipe. Yes much easier than the ingredients list would suggest. Great hit with my family, even my picky 6 year old! Only changes we made was to pre-soak the lentils, not necessary but decreased cooking time and as they increase in size we found we only actually wanted half the quantity ... The rest went in a soup ??

Couldn't find tomato purée so used crushed tomato. Otherwise didn't change a thing. So good!

Was good, but didn't have a  strong taste that I associate with curries. I'm not sure how, considering the ingredients.

I'm not much of a cook. I had never even eaten lentils before, but I've always been curious so I gave this recipe a shot.

The first time I made it, it was great! 

I've made it a few times since, and now it's one of my limited number of go-to recipes. Every time I make it I change something, depending on what I have onhand,and it always turns out delicious.

I use stock instead of water, and added coconut milk too. I didn't have any tomato paste, so I used a big can of tomatoes. I included some berbere powder from the Ethiopian store (a little goes a long way).

I eat it with jasmine rice, also cooked in chicken stock, and with a touch of my special rice seasoning. I make enough to last for a few days, and it just seems to get better.

My favourite recipe on this site :)

Delicious curry! Also a very nice basic recipe as you can change ingredients to what you like. I used a can of lentils and used only 2/3 of the amount of tomato purree. I also added 300 g cauliflower which I first Stir fryed first in olive oil, set them aside and added them in the last step.

I have made this before to the T of the recipe but it was not flavorful or salty enough for my liking. Here are the edits I would suggest: 1) add more salt; 2-3x the salt 2) if you want additional veggies, add some finely diced carrots to the simmering onions 3) if you want some more heat, add 1-2 tsp of garam masala 4) add some more curry powder. These are the edits I do and it comes out very tasty.

Very tasty.  Took the advice of another review and "toasted" my spices.  Other than that made exactly as written.

Yum! I used Thai red curry paste and powder and - as advised in a handful of other reviews - cut up some fresh tomatoes and caramelized them along with the onions. Served it with basmati rice and had no leftovers. It was a delicious, filling and easy to make.

Followed recipe with exception of the ginger. Came out great, may have been even better with the ginger. Just make sure that you have a side of basmati rice or naan bread to break up the density.

Very, very good.
I had to make some changes since I did not have all the exact ingredients.
I used green lentils- they took about 45 minutes to cook.
I used coconut oil.  I did not have curry paste, so I upped the curry powder and some of the other spices.  I also used candied ginger (chopped very finely), so I did not add any extra sugar.  I used canned diced tomato, which I added to the onions after they were about carmelized.   I added the lentils before they were totally done cooking (in a separate pot) so all the flavors would meld.  Then I threw in some fresh spinach leaves and some chopped mushrooms.  I served this with basmati rice and naan bread.  Topped with some chopped cilantro. SO good.

I added some frozen veggies (got the idea from the main picture). I beleive that with a little bit less tomato puree would taste even better!

made with tomato paste rather than puree, needed water. Throw in a spicy pepper too, for zip in addition to flavor.

Double the spices but only use 1/2 the amount of lentil beans then it would be perfect.

Fantastic taste!!!! I've made it several times, my kids love it. On occasion, for the sake of time I use powdered garlic and ginger instead of fresh. I also add 2 cans of chick peas and one brick of frozen chopped spinach for added nutritional value. I'll be making this again!

I've always felt that the lentil dishes I've had before were lacking in flavor; always a little on the bland side. I made this mostly to the recipe but using a garam masala curry paste that says 'hot' on the bottle. I have to tell you, I was pleasantly pleased when sampling the dish. This dish was the first one ready and I found myself sampling a number of times out of the pan, while I waited for the other 2 dished to be ready to serve. Will definitely make this one again.

Was easy to prepare, and quick. 
Found the spice to be very sharp, more heat than taste.....so threw in a cup of coconut milk which helped a great deal. Next time going to try without the turmeric which has a bitter taste,  also add more sugar as many onions here in North America do not give off a really nice sweet taste when carmelized.

No curry paste so used chilli paste, halved the lentils and spices, as was only making for 4 but still heaps, no cumin so used Moroccan spice mix also. No white onion (the cupboard was pretty bare today) but had a red onion and added extra garlic,

Pretty bland as is. Since my husband and I are quite experienced in authentic Indian food, I took some advice from another reviewer and doubled pretty much all spices, ginger & garlic and even with that it was just ok.

Seeing that this dish had an average rating of 4.5 stars I thought it would be amazing. I had trouble finding red lentils at my supermarket and perhaps that was why it didn't turn out that well. I bought the most red colored lentils I could find. The flavor was delicious, but it just felt like it was missing something. I can see using this as a side dish, but for me personally I won't make it as a stand alone meal again.

This recipe is unbelievably good! It is also PERFECT for meal prepping, because it freezes incredibly well.  Most recently I made a double batch and was able to fill 8 jars with curry to freeze for later if I ever need lunch in a pinch.

I've made this recipe 4 times now, twice exactly by the book and twice making mistakes that changed the outcome a bit.

One mistake was trying to use fresh tomatoes that I pureed at home.  It turned out watery and pretty unremarkable, so I don't recommend doing that at all.  The other mistake was buying tomato paste instead of tomato puree.  That one was pretty easy to fix--I just added water and it turned out fine.

In terms of positive changes, I have added frozen peas a couple of times (letting the hot curry defrost them) and I really like that addition.  In the future I might try replacing the lentils with chicken or cauliflower, or adding a bunch more vegetables.

Been making this curry for a while, pretty much became my go to meal now, began changing around the amounts for the paste mostly just increasing the chili powder to get it hotter. I've also put cauliflour in it too at the same point at putting in the lentals for a bit of a nutrional boost.

Didn't change a thing, but could only find Thai green curry paste so used that.  Loved it, and will most certainly make it again.

This was a delicious, easy dish that works great as a main course for vegans. I wasn't sure what they meant by "curry paste" as I had never seen that in an Indian recipe, only Thai. So I looked it up and ended up using Jamie Oliver's Jalfrezi curry paste recipe (he has 5 different curry pastes so if another one looks good or you happen to have the ingredients for it, I'm sure any would be good).

Do be very careful not to overcook the lentils. Red lentils cook very quickly, so taste even before 15 minutes. Also, if you haven't used red lentils before, they start out bright orange but turn yellow-brown when cooked. Don't worry, when you add all the other ingredients it turns the dish back to brightly colored.

Finally, instead of canned tomatoes, I used fresh tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped. If your garden is overflowing with tomatoes, definitely do this. Use about 5 big tomatoes and cook the sauce down a bit (5-8 minutes) before adding the lentils.

Even though I overcooked the lentils, the result was still very tasty!  I increased the amount of tomatoes and spices I used based on one of the other reviews and it was very tasty and made a HUGE batch. Next time I will try to get a spicier curry past.

I found it a bit too spicy using the proportions of powdered chili and curry paste suggested. if I was making it again I would use only about a quarter teaspoon or less of chili powder. Apart from that the taste and texture were good.

I can't believe I haven't found this recipe before. I'm obsessed with red lentils so this is perfect. 
It came out delicious but I can never follow a recipe exactly so I added some spinach and peas & carrots. I wanted to adjust the taste so I added 2TB sweet mango chutney for added sweetness and spice. It came out absolutely delicious. It cooked fast and was really easy to make. I wonder if I could cook the whole dish  in one pot and not have to cook the lentils separately. I'll try it next time. I am also going to freeze some of it to see how it keeps in the freezer. Bon appetit!

I left out the curry paste (didn't have any) and the chili powder (husband can't eat too much spice) and added an extra tablespoon of curry powder and another teaspoon of cumin. I also added about a cup of finely chopped carrots to the lentils about 5 minutes before they were ready. Served it up with a side of quinoa and cheesy red pepper bread. Was delicious!

Used this recipe as a guide, I added chicken, red and green peppers, celery, and coconut milk. Also I pureed the lentils once they were cooked and mixed it in with the tomato puree. Had to adjust the spices to compensate for the coconut milk. Turned out pretty good and will make a good addition to my weekly meal prep.

Delicious lentil curry! I wanted to make it as is written so I could give a proper review. The only change I did was add canned tomatoes and about 1/4 c cooking cream at the end. It did need more salt to bring out the curry flavours as well. Oh and I added spinach too because I love it curried and with lentils. Green lentils are fine with this dish. I served it with couscous. Great recipe! Thanks!

This dish was easy to make and so delicious!  I love to make my own curries so the only thing I did differently was mixing my own spices instead of using curry powder (I used turmeric, coriander, black pepper, garlic salt, onion powder, cumin, and chili powder).  Served with basmati Jasmine rice and topped with fresh cilantro.  Will definitely make again!

Made a few changes. Used fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of puree as one reviewer suggested. Also added frozen peas after adding the diced tomatoes. I used a red curry paste that was very spicy so I ended up adding a whole can of light coconut milk at the end. Also, I love any of these kinds of dishes with coconut milk. Really great flavor! Would consider adding some broccoli and or/spinach next time too. Served with brown basmati rice.

I didn't have curry paste and chilli powder so I substituted Korean Red Pepper Paste and Korean red pepper powder. ( I reduced the amounts by 1/4 since Red Pepper is hotter than chilli and curry.)

My husband and I loved it.  I did add an extra (small) can of coconut milk as we found it a tad spicy during cooking.  It was delicious and will be added to regular rotation.

I omitted the curry paste and used Arvinda's yellow curry powder for a rich, powerful taste.  It was delicious.  I added baby green peas and served it with white rice and whole wheat roti.  Spectacular.  Leftovers scheduled for Monday night!

Delicious and easy to make. I made no changes to the recipe, but would've added frozen peas, if I had any, just to make it a one-pot meal.

It was a great side dish, but it's not enough if it's not served with rice. Also, I didn't use curry paste, so I changed the recipe a bit using soy milk heated up in a pan and then added all the spices to it, so when it reduced it was a creamy sauce. I will probably try it again!

This turned out bland. We wound up adding salt and a ton of extra spices at the table to wake it up. After that, it was pretty good.

Very versatile recipe that I use as a base. I made some changes because done as the recipe states it is heavy on the lentil side and a little bland for my taste. I doubled the spices, sugar and salt, and used a 32 oz can of tomatoes plus a can of tomato paste to make this curry a little more saucy. Once the onions were caramelized I added the curry paste, ginger and garlic. Next  I toasted the spices to release their flavor and stirred that into the onions. Last I added the 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, the can of tomato paste and some frozen peas & carrots for more color. I simmered this for ten minutes or so and then added it to the lentils. Turned out fantastic! Will make it again.

There was more heat than flavor it seemed and I wasn't pleased with the marriage of these ingredients. I scrambled to fix it somehow.... Somebody said double spices. (Silly me)One of the reviews suggested garlic powder,onion powder, ground coriander and garam masala bout a tsp each I believe. (Not helping) Poured a can of coconut milk. (Better)Added a lil bit of brown sugar to bring the heat down more, added fresh tomatoesand a can of tomato paste. Now it's okay! I may not throw the entire pot away but hey guys how come no one mentioned that Thais also have a red curry paste?  Because that's the one that I accidentally bought and I can't say if that's why this recipe was so darn awful. Make sure you buy Indian spices and curry paste people!
And I know this would cause a drastic name change but if it doesnt matter to you, the green or brown lentils hold their shape much better than the red so try those for less mushy texture.

I used green lentils instead of red out of convenience, but it didn't make a significant difference.  came together really easily. I'd make it again.  wife was a fan.  quick setup if you don't have a lot of prep time for dinner.

Pretty good.  I used two onions, four fresh tomatoes, and then added a small can of coconut milk to smooth it out.  Ended up with lots left over (cooked this recipe for only two people), so hopefully it freezes well.

This is not only delicious, but extraordinarily filling (which is great for a glutton like me).   I added 1 tbs red pepper flakes for spiciness and 1/2 cup of dried split peas to add some more variety to the flavor.  I also used curry powder instead of paste due to lack of ingredients.

I'm big on my coconut milk-based curries, so I supplemented the tomato puree for 1 can of coconut milk.

This curry is so simple and so excellent. I had tomato paste instead of puree, so I added two tbs water and 2 tbs almond milk to get it to thin out into a good consistency without becoming flavorless. I did not have curry powder so I substituted the 1 tsb powder for an additional tsb of paste. Served with basmati rice and it was great. Will be making again!

I was interested in making this dish because it appeared in the Dec/Jan issue of AllRecipes magazine as low calorie.  I did end up making a couple of changes based on what I had.  I didn't have any "Indian" curry paste, only Thai red curry paste.  So, I only used a bit of the paste and added additional cumin and a teaspoon of coriander to more reflect the Indian seasonings.  I also reduced the chili powder because Thai red curry tends to be spicy.  When finishing the dish, I had chick peas on hand, so I added these.  I thought this was an important addition because it gave the dish more texture.  Several reviewers commented on the mushiness of it as written.  The chick peas definitely gave the dish that added texture without changing the flavor.

I love Indian food and all the pungent, complex, intense flavor and so was happy to find this recipe. After reading the reviews I went all in and doubled the spices and onion, and added carrots. Recipe freezes well. I like it with lots of cilantro and basil, and a large dollop of sour cream to cool down the dish some. Happy cooking!

Excellent dish.  We served it on top of basmati rice, with some fresh chopped cilantro.  A very filling and delicious meal !  We used Patak's Tandoori curry paste, but you could use a hotter paste to your liking.

Very good!  I made it according to the directions the first time and it was a little dry for my personal taste.  Here are the changes I now make:  Add extra water or tomatoes to get it more 'saucy' like I prefer, use more garlic/ginger, use real tomatoes/canned tomatoes or the puree depending on what I have, sauté all the spices in oil before adding them to onions, and garnish with cilantro.  Great with basmati rice and naan!

Delicious!  Made this last night for dinner, and it was fabulous.  Full of flavor but so simple to make, this is the best lentil curry I've ever made.  I only used a 10oz can of tomato puree (what I had in the cupboard), so I added in a little bit of tomato paste to make up the difference.  I also used green lentils instead of red and was still pleased with the results.  This was great over basmati rice, but it's also delicious by itself.  Made a large quantity, which is perfect for leftovers!

It's delicious. I didn't have curry paste in the house so I used a biryani seasoning paste and cilantro paste as a substitute and It came out so well.

This is good and I will make it again, implementing the following tips from various reviewers.  Replace the tomato puree with one can of Fire Roasted Chopped Tomatoes or fresh chopped tomato for improved texture and another level of flavor.  Double the garlic.  Boil lentils for 2 mins then simmer for about 8 mins. Saute the spices in a little oil, then add the ginger and garlic and saute for another minute before adding it all to the onions. Then add the tomato and simmer it all together to finish cooking the lentils. Add frozen peas and warm them in the curry.

It's delicious! I wish I had cut the recipe in half because it makes a lot, but I'll just take it somewhere to share with others tomorrow! I added extra ginger and garlic, which is typical of me, and to counteract any added bitterness, a little extra sugar too. I will definitely make it again!

This recipe is the first that I used in making dal/lentil of any kind since I enjoy Indian food.  My tolerance for spicy/heat is low so I had to cut the chili paste and chili powder amount in 1/2.  It was suggested by an Indian friend to add enough salt to taste.  It amounted to more than what the recipe calls for.  While shopping at an Indian supermarket the owner suggested that I add fresh Indian curry leaves which I did.  Unfortunately I can't tell the difference with or without it but if it made a difference then I'll say that the dish came out tasty.  I wouldn't be able to have it with rice because it's so filling but with naan or chapati instead.

I guess I can't fully give this a fair review since I made a few modifications per other users. It's not bad, but maybe needs to simmer longer to incorporate all of the spices.

We didn't make any changes to the original recipe, besides not including garlic because we didn't have any on hand. My fiance added ground beef and he said it was delicious (I'm a vegetarian.) We served it over basmati rice and had a side of broccoli.

This is very easy to make.  I used green lentils (because really, you could put the sauce on anything) and it was great.  I also subbed ground ginger for fresh, and blended a can of stewed tomatoes to use in place of the tomato puree.  Both substitutions worked well.   I look forward to making it again, maybe with fish next time.  A tip for those sensitive to spice-  the curry is pretty strong, but can easily be toned down by mixing in plain yoghurt.

This recipe was pretty easy to make and would have taken less time if I cooked the lentils properly. The vegetable/spice mix was delicious, but the lentils turned to mush. They looked more like mashed potatoes and had no resemblance to the picture. I also found that if you add cardamom it gives it a sweet kick. Also, I wouldn't add as much ginger as the recipe calls for because it was a bit overpowering. I would however make it again with my experimental stage over.

Pretty good, lots of flavour. I was craving veggies with this though, I might try to substitute some of the lentils with roasted veggies next time - eggplant or cauliflower would be a great addition to this.

I will be honest I did not use curry paste but otherwise I followed the recipe and the result was not good. I will not make it again.

I made it with no added oil.  Added a diced potato, 3 carrots & stalk celery - nice, spicy flavor.

LOVED THIS!!  A go-to dish in my house, I make it monthly, if not more often.  I've even served it at an Indian-themed birthday party and the birthday girl who is married to an Indian man LOVED it, and she cooks Indian food all. the. time!  
The only pain is rinsing the lentils.  I guess I need to invest in a China cap!  (sorry if that's not the PC term, it's what my cook husband calls it)

These were honestly the best lentils I've ever eaten.  Very authentic Indian flavor.  We did leave them on low for a while with the lid off to thicken them up while we finished the other dishes.  Absolutely delicious.  I wouldn't change a thing.

My girlfriend says these were the best lentils she's ever eaten.  The recipe was straightforward and easy to follow--the only difference we did was to use red palm oil instead of vegetable oil, and crushed tomatoes instead of pureed.

We made it in advance, and left it on low heat, uncovered, stirring occasionally, while we made the rest of the meal.

Most definitely a keeper.

One of my favorites! I've made it twice so far and been delighted both times. Second time I added 1 cubed sweet potato and a cup cubed butternut squash and topped with a table spoon of cream cheese.  Healthy, yummy and very filling.

Ehhh...it was edible, but I found it bland. Was expecting it to have more flavor. Tried to spice it up a bit and it helped a little. Won't make again.

Great!! Might add more curry paste, and vegetables such as celery, potatoes, peas and spinach. Not too spicy, not too sweet, perfect for introducing spicy food.

I love this recipe!  I overcooked my lentils (seems like I always do that), and I still loved this!  My husband had 3 bowls of it, too.  This one is a winner for us, but my son ate something else.  (It's too spicy for the kiddo.)

I added a bit more tomato and diced up some pepper to saute with the onions. The scents while it was finishing cooking was incredible. Look forward to making this again.

I've made this about once a week for close to a year now and just forgot to rate it.  It is very good as is.  If you really want to add another filling ingredients, cube a potato or two and throw it in with it.  It's a vegan meal all on its own.

The combination of spices is good but I cut them in half and I am glad I did.  It would have been overpowering with the amounts dictated.  I also increased the amount of lentils to 2-1/2 cups and left out the tomato puree and the sugar.  I served it as a main dish with steamed broccoli.

Just made this for the first time. I think it has great potential but needs a little altering. Next time I want to double most of the spices because it was still a little bland.

I'm not crazy about lentils, which are still a prominent flavor in this dish, but the spices nicely offset the lentil flavor. I also noted that the left overs tasted better the second day.

Very flavorful and easy to make. I did find that my lentils overlooked and became mush but that's easy to correct for next time. Also be aware that this makes a LOT!! I'll halve it the next time. A great recipe for a healthy veggie dinner especially when you're craving Indian.

I love making Indian cuisine. This recipe is now one of my favorites. Very versatile. Thanks.I added a couple of other vegetables to the dish to make it a main vegetarian dish and I have also made it as is for a side dish. Great both ways!!

This was absolutely delicious and filling. I cut the amount of curry paste and powder by one fourth because the stuff I bought was strong. It was just amazing.

Wow! I'm always on the hunt for easy tasty curry lunches to take to work.  This fits the bill!  I pre cooked my lentils last night and kept them in the fridge.  Today I did TWO onions (they were kind of small) and used green curry paste (that is all I had) and the rest of the recipe I followed to a T.  Well, I did not have canned puree tomatoes, just regular diced tomatoes.  I prepared this all in a 3" deep electric skillet.  Then added the cold lentils to reheat at the end.  I was going to add cilantro too, but forgot it while shopping.  Excellent dish - I will try butter at the end as someone suggested.  So good!!!

Liked it very  much.  Definitely felt it needed some salt support, but apart from that, it was deliciously flavorful, and not terribly tough to make.  I went prep to table in less than an hour (and that includes the 20 minutes at the end that I scrambled to make some jasmine rice).

I am always on a look-out for a good vegetarian recipe - this one is wonderful, flavourful and tasty. I tend to add pieces of pumpkin and blend the whole thing once ready to make it edible for my son with braces, and serve it with freshly cut coriander over rice - bon appetit! Thank you for sharing, Emma.

We make this 2-3 times a year when we are looking for something "warm" and vegetarian.  My wife and 12 year old daughter love the recipe!
We serve it with rice and a naan bread recipe we found on Allrecipes.

This recipe is excellent as-is with a mild curry paste for those with more sensitive palates.  However, it is also very easy to customize with spicier curry paste and more of the spices.  I make this almost weekly and it is never the same twice!  I usually start with the base recipe +1 tbs of curry powder,  and I add the other spices as my taste buds see fit that night!  I find it easier to make the recipe to-taste if you mix the spices with the tomato puree instead of with the onions at first.  I let my sauce simmer for at least 10-15 minutes for the best flavors.  I also like my curries a little "sloppy" so I don't drain much water off of the lentils.  I serve over jasmine rice and with naan.  Thank you for providing a great, easy, go-to recipe for me!

Came out perfect! Robust flavor. Only thing I would change is the amount of lentils called for in the ingredients list. 2 cups dry yielded way too much for the recipe. I would cut it down to 3/4- 1 cup dry, unless you triple all other ingredients. Other than that... Wonderful dish!

This was my first attempt at any type of curry dish.  I found a recipe for curry powder and started by making my own curry powder first. With my curry powder in hand, I followed the published recipe almost exactly. I took another readers advice and cut the salt in 1/2 and used tomato paste. I cooked the lentils till they were "al dente" and avoided the "mush" other complained of.  I was also gentle when folding the lentils into the curry base so as not to damage the lentils. I did not find the recipe too hot.  I got more of a sweet taste initially followed by a little heat.  I think this might be an unusual side to bring to  barbecue in place of baked beans. I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious! My partner loved it! I doubled the recipe as I like having extra curry to dip naan in - added a couple of extra tsp of garlic and ginger. Also, added a bit of extra sugar to balance out the flavours (just a dash). Used a 15 oz can of rinsed chick peas instead of lentils and roasted some cauliflower in the oven with a bit of olive oil for 25 mins at 400. Served with a sprinkle of fresh coriander. Amazing!

This is one of the most healthy, tasteful and satisfying one-dish meals my family has enjoyed. I have made it at least 3-4 times in the last 6 months and like the introduction indicates, this meal is really not that difficult to make but so worth the effort.

Lesson learned: Caramelize the onion and only use 1/2-3/4c. of onion. I only had one large red onion and it was too much. I didn't cook the onions long enough for them to caramelize although they were done when i mixed in the spices...still not cooking them long enough probably affected the outcome. I couldn't get rid of a slighty bitter, strong taste which I attribute to the excess onion. I will try this recipe again and re-rate. Thanks everyone for sharing what worked or didn't work for you. Next time I'll read more of the rev iews before I start cooking.

Not bad, I too had to cook the lentils longer than 15 minutes. Good taste, too bland for my curry taste. I added tofu and spinach for more nutrition and vegetables. I would give 3 1/2 if able.

This was my first spin at Indian food.  It gets high marks for adaptability.  My kids loved it a version I made with less spices.  If you don't have naan, serve it with a crusty french bread and really, really good butter at room temperature.

I really enjoy this recipe! I have made it multiple times. It has an excellent curry flavor and I love the red lentils in it. I plan to make it for a family gathering for soy free, gluten free, dairy free, vegetarian family members.

The tomato puree made it pretty acidic and bitter. Added half a can of coconut milk and a bit more salt and sugar. I didn't have chili powder so I used a tiny bit of cayenne and some red pepper flakes. All that helped balance it out a bit but it was still a bit too tart. Perhaps maybe half a can of puree next time? 

And yes lentils do cook very quickly - I had to scrub the first batch and start again (and pay closer attention this time)

Half the salt and curry powder and it's perfect.  Keep everything else as recipe calls for.  Very delicious!

Very tasty. Nailed that flavor combination of the sweet, spicy, savory. Pretty quick and easy. I used thai red curry paste (only 1 T. instead of 2) because it was all I had on hand and came out fantastic.

absolutely delicious! I have a hard time winning my children over with vegetarian dishes, but they thoroughly enjoyed this dish and actually asked for seconds! The only changes I made, was that I used ground ginger instead of minced, doubled the garlic, and used olive oil in place of the veggie oil. I served it over basmati rice and sprinkled with a little rock Himalayan sea salt. Wonderful!

excellent with the right amount of spices!  I had to use up a leek so I threw that in with the onions and added a bit of coconut milk, omitted the salt (cause we get too much anyhow, and used homemade tomato puree

Thank you for sharing this.  I have now made it many times and it never fails to please.  Last time, I used the basic curry sauce to make a curried chicken - excellent as well.

I was a little apprehensive at first, but this recipe delivered! I had to substitute the following and it still turned out super delicious: 
Masaman curry paste
Tomato sauce instead of tomato puree (small jar)
Ginger powder instead of fresh ginger 

The recipe also made way more than I thought. Great with rice and "faux na'an" bread (aka tortillas with garlic butter in a fry pan for us lazy folk).

This was so delicious. I served it with basmati rice, which was great. I think next time I will add some vegetables like squash and zucchini, just to add some more nutrients, but really, this dish is full of flavor and incredibly tasty. I especially love the taste of the ginger. The lentils took about 25 minutes for me and I had to drain a good bit of water out.

This was one of the best lentil dal recipies I've tried. And I've tried many. Try adding a squeeze of fresh lemon and a bit of chopped cilantro before serving for an extra punch of flavor. So so tasty!

Followed the recipe as written and I was disappointed.  The culprit may have been the curry paste that I used.  A brand new jar of red curry paste made by Thai Kitchen.  The flavor was bland and the texture was awful.

Loved it even though I didn't have some of the ingredients (didn't have curry paste, chili powder or tumeric). I added a bit of cayenne pepper instead and followed the directions otherwise. I thought it was great and will try it again with all the ingredients after my next grocery store run!

This was good but pretty thick in texture.   The lentils were a good addition but the richness of the dish stopped me from going back for seconds.  I'm sure there are better lentil curry recipes out there, but it's cheap and worth a meal if you want to try this one

I didn't have curry paste but had all the seasonings needed to more or less replicate the taste. Without the paste, though, I ended up needing much more seasoning than called for, likely double everything (don't double the turmeric, though). To get heat, I added some red pepper garlic paste I had and a few squirts of sriracha. Instead of tomato puree, I used tomato paste and then some cream to give it more body. I also added steamed cauliflower.

This came out very well. Red lentils were not special enough to make me buy them again to make this -- I'll just use regular green (brown) lentils. I tripled the cumin by accident and found that to be a tasty choice. Served with brown rice and naan. Thanks for sharing!

I like this but it's not my favourite red lentil curry.  It is not specific enough on the ingredients.  I used green curry paste (all I had) and I am sure it would have been better with red.  The recipe also states Tomato puree - for me that meant tomato paste but when i looked at the amount needed - 14.25oz - I realized they must mean tomato sauce.  I had to add some water to the curry mixture.  It still turned out ok.

Yum!  I'd never made lentils before, but I am experimenting with different grains and legumes.  This was delicious!  But a question for those of you who have made this...what kind of curry paste did you use?  I had some Penang Curry Paste, so I used that along with the more traditional Indian curry powder.  But is there something else I should have used instead?  I thought the Penang Curry Paste added some nice heat and flavor, but am curious if there is something that would have been even better.  Any suggestions?

I absolutely LOVE this curry. It helps that I use a stellar, potent real Indian curry paste, but this recipe is amazing. I always add lots of veggies -- carrots, potatoes, peppers, and/or beans -- and not so many spices (my pastes is loaded). If it needs thickening I'll add a spoonful or two of cream cheese. YUMMMM.

Delish!! Added some potatoes and red diced bell peppers! Made this an hour ago with eston lentils and it issuper good. Didn't have any tomate paste but had some V8 laying around so I used this instead! Very flavorful and a perfect vegetarian meal. Topped it off with some sriracha sauce and served it on a bed of basmati jasmin rice.

This is a delicious recipe that I have used over and over!  I don't always use the red lentils, either.  This is a delicious base for any curry:  i often use a combo of cauliflower, sweet potatoes and carrots.  Sometimes I throw in a chicken breast and let it simmer in all that goodness!  Chickpeas are something you can add as well.  Another addition I make to add to the richness is coconut milk or coconut cream.  Even if you don't have the curry paste, give this a try!

This was fantastic! I too did most everything the same but doubled the spices and cooked them desperate for a minute in oil first then added to rice with the garlic and ginger. I didn't have tomato puree on hand so I pureed two roma tomatoes and added 4 diced as well for more body. I am eating it again leftover for lunch and yes, it still rocks!

this was a wonderful, quick meal. Popped the rice in the rice cooker and by the time it was done the curry was too. I would say it needs a lot more salt, maybe 2 tsp to a tablespoon total. It is stupendous with cilantro on top and a hearty teaspoon of Ghee. Will be making this again soon.

Would be better with chick peas and losing the sugar. I added jalepanos and a green bell pepeper, and a lot more curry, tumeric, garlic, chili powder and cumin (and even some cumin seed) to try and get this recipe tasting like real indian food. Fresh tomatoes would help this dish too, but that takes time... 
Still a great place to start for Amerifats who want to branch out with their cultural dishes.

Great recipe!  I cooked the lentils in coconut water and used hot curry and the result is a delicious sweet and spicy meal!

Delicious and super easy. I love makeing masoor dal and this was a great change up with the red curry paste. I too adjusted a few thing according to my taste preferance...extra ginger and garlic and like another reviewer I used diced tomatoes and some frozen peas. Served with homemade whole wheat naan bread and wild rice. YUM YUM!!

This was a really good lentil curry. The curry paste I used was quite hot, so I will probably tone it down just a little next time. I also added some mushrooms, courgettes, and chickpeas for fun, and some fresh cilantro on top. Delicious.

This was a very easy and tasty way to use up the red lentils I had! I didn't have curry paste, so I looked up substitutes and found out that curry pastes aren't actually used in Indian cooking (which was the taste I was going for). So, I made a few substitutions: instead of the curry paste, garlic and ginger, I added some vegetable curry powder (in addition to the curry powder already called for) and a double dose of ginger-garlic paste (which I had in the fridge). I also did not add as much tomato paste because I use the tube stuff that you can keep in the fridge. My curry came out very thick, but I could have just added some water to make it more sauce-like. Mine was also spicy even with just a pinch of the Indian chili powder I had, so I will probably omit that next time to make it more kid-friendly (although for others it will depend on the potency of your spices...mine were straight from India and very spicy). It was very quick, easy, and my family loved it!

Incredible, I didn't use curry paste though but tomato paste with water and a little more curry powder.  I even made it again with rice instead of lentils - equally as good.  Thanks for sharing.

An extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt made the flavors stand out better, and it was tastier the next day. I really like that it doesn't require any obscure ingredients or difficult cooking methods, because that means it's easy to toss together even if you don't plan ahead.

Delicious!  We loved it.  I used only one small can of tomato paste instead of a large can of tomato puree. We served it over Jasmine rice.  For some reason our lentils cooked CRAZY fast and were tender and getting mushy in like 10 minutes.  Next time we may add a can of coconut milk to thin and smooth it out a bit.  It is quite thick and pasty, but I would still give it 5 stars even without any changes.

Yummy!  I made this at my mom's house and she didn't have curry paste or cumin so I added some extra curry powder.  Also added a diced, peeled apple.  Didn't have any tomato paste so used diced tomatoes with green chilis and it gave the dish a little zing.

This is a wondeful recipe!  I used pre-steamed lentils from Trader Joe's which was a great time saver, and I used fire roasted crushed tomatoes in place of the tomato puree as a reviewer had recommended.

DELICIOUS!  The sauce is so bright and flavorful even though it doesn't seem like a lot of sauce.  I used french lentils which I think stay hard and never get that mushiness of other lentils.  I also think 2 cups of lentils may be a little much.  I used about 1 3/4 cup instead which just allowed more sauce.  My husband and 7 year old son raved about this.  I served it with sour cream and lots of fresh cilantro.  I also served it with a side of indian spiced roasted cauliflower which was the perfect compliment.  LOVED IT!

I tried doubling the lentils and spice mix, quadrupling the onions, then using a whole 29 oz can of tomato puree and it turned out great (mild, for spicy add even more chili). Definitely a large batch, but it stores well.

I just made this soup and it was pretty good.  I didn't have the curry paste, nor fresh or canned tomatos, so I used canned paste, about 4oz.  
Based on someones review, I doubled the spices and toasted briefly to heighten the flavors.  Boiled the lentils for about 10 minutes and then added curry mix and simmered for another 10.  I did not drain the water because I wanted it to be more soupy and it's perfect as a soup and over rice.

This is a fantastic lentil curry. Yummy!
I did not have "curry paste" on hand so I looked up some curry paste recipes online to see what I could come up with. Jamie Oliver's Jalfrezi curry paste worked fantastic for me with this recipe. I also added more cilantro into the dish to give it that bright pop of flavour. This one is definitely a keeper.

I used as the recipe said but used a jar of red lentils, this made it a lot easier, would cut down on the chilli as used hot chilli powder and added a little water to the tomato puree, will cook again and try with chopped tin tomatoes. had rice and naan bread.

I love this! Make it probably once a week and have leftovers when I need a satisfying snack.  Recently, I put this exact recipe on some whole wheat bread with a little mustard and it reminded me of sloppy joes.  Don't be turned off by the word "curry" if you're not a fan (although, I am, so...).

My husband has two rating scales since I have been cooking more vegan meals. This is 4 stars on a vegan scale, and a three on a "meat" scale. He said he loved the spices. I loved it all, but these ratings are for my husband. I didn't have curry paste, so I omitted that, and I had some left over home Made tomato like sauce. It had zuchinni, and fennel seed in it, and I also sautéed mushrooms with the onions. :)
Thanks for a yummy healthy recipe!

This was really good. We added some chicken but it didn't necessarily need it if you had a side dish. My red lentils also cooked in about 5 minutes as opposed to the 20-30 minutes indicated on the package. Did you know that lentils are the protein with the lowest carbon footprint?

This dish is amazing! I used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil, left out the ginger and chili powder (because I didn't have any), added a little Fajita spice, and added some coconut milk. I ate it with basmati rice and some naan bread. It was just phenomenal.

Very delicious!! This recipe is super easy and pretty much fool proof. I used a mild curry paste and personally I could have gone hotter. I unfortunately overcooked my lentils and they went very mushy. Overall very flavourful and could be used as a side dish. Will make again and experiment with hotness.

You won't be disappointed by this!!

This was great and super easy!  I used olive oil instead of vegetable and cooked the garlic and ginger with the onions.  I didn't have curry paste so I threw in a bit more curry powder.  I also served this with a fried egg on top for dinner - delicious!

This recipe is great! I left out the curry paste and chili powder so it isn't that spicy. I haven't even served it yet, and I've sampled it so many times because it was so good. For the tomato puree though, I put in one of those little cans of tomato paste and added about a 1/4 cup of water.

I don't doubt this is a good recipe but I did something wrong. I couldn't find curry paste at the market (can someone suggest a brand?) and ended up by using Patel's Korma. The lentils came out find but the sauce was bitter and thick. I tried adding water but nothing helped. Help!

Very delicious.  DH thought it was a bit sweet, but I liked it.  My only thought is that I wish I had used a lentil that held up better.  Red seem to turn to mush.  Although maybe I won't like it as much with a harder lentil.

Had to use mild curry paste.  That's all that is available locally.  A good dish but I'll add some more heat next time.

I used tomato paste b/c I didn't have any puree, along with some cooking water from the lentils. Also, I threw in a half pound of spinach and garnished with chopped cilantro.

Absolutely delicious! My new go-to lentil recipe (and we eat lentils once a week). The only differences where I used 1/2 tsp of ginger powder as I'd used up all my fresh ginger for another dish and I didn't have curry paste. I also passed on the chili powder. I boiled the lentils in about 6 cups of water with 3 veggie broth cubes as I love the extra flavor this lends the lentils.

Not my favorite dish. If it is a side dish, next to many others, I would like it. But as a main dish it is maybe too flavourful. I also found the recipe too spicey. I only added half the chili and even that was too spicey for my husband. For me it was OK (but I love spicey food), but I wouldn't like more chili in the dish.

This is delicious! I used green lentils instead of red, a 6 oz can of tomato paste and a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes and ginger powder instead of fresh (that's what I had on hand), but otherwise, followed the recipe. Super easy and super tasty! I served it over jasmine rice. Next time, I will add some cubed potatoes to the lentils while cooking them. Yummy!

This is so easy and delicious!  I just made it for the second time.  The first time I had it on rice, but this time I'm having it on greens.  The combo of the chili powder and curry paste can make it pretty spicy, though, so plan accordingly.

Omg. This wass so delicious!! I cant believe i had this gem in my recipe box for so long and just now made it. It makes for a great vegan dish!! I used cumin seeds instead of ground cumin and it was just as good. A little stronger cumin flavor, but definitely still very delicious. Also doubled the garlic and triple the ginger...yummo. Thank you for this recipe!

I made it just as the recipe called for.  I felt the flavor was too sharp, maybe it was the curry paste.  I would not make it again.

This was tasty, but I found the instructions confusing. When you mix the onions with the spices there is no fluid with which to actually "simmer" the ingredients. I added water, of course, but better instructions would be appreciated. Also, I found the tomato flavor to be overwhelming and prefer a creamier curry. Altogether I'm apt to try it again, maybe adding more spices and veggies to the lentil mix.

Perhaps I did something wrong, but I feel like this was missing something.  I'm not sure I would make this again, however it did make the house smell nice.

This was very easy to make and tastes simply scrumptious.  I could not find the tomato puree in a 14.25 ounce container, so I used the Muir Glen Fire Roasted Garlic Petite Diced Tomatoes instead.  I pureed them and it worked well.  This is a keeper in my home.

DELICIOUS. I live in Medellin and there aren't any Indian restaurants here... I finally managed to bring some curry paste with me from the US and found the rest of the ingredients here.  I can't get red lentils, just regular brown ones, and it was still great.  A can of tomato puree here costs a fortune, so I chopped up fresh tomatoes and added some tomato paste.  I ended up adding some more curry powder at the end because I like it!

Trying new things. I am happy I tried this recipe. found all ingredients. It cooks really fast. 30 minutes from start to table. Very tasty and extremely filling. I served it with naan bread and basmati rice.

Delicious! Only problem? 1) This doesn't tell you how much water to use, so I had to wing it. Originally I added 1 cup, but ended up adding more and more. 2) It doesn't show what the serving size is. I love being able to adjust servings (I did four instead of eight), but it's useless without knowing the size of the serving. Also noticed that when I cut the recipe down to four servings, it didn't cut the tomato paste, so I ended up putting much more than called for (but it was very good).

Excellent recipe. I like really spicy curries so I will add more heat next time. The sauce worried me at first because it looked too tomato-ey in the pan but it came out perfect once mixed in. Must serve with basmati for the best flavor. I used Thai Red Curry Paste and it was great.

I made as directed, and it was soft and mushy - very tasty, though!  I think next time I would add some chopped vegetables (potatoes or carrots) or the like to add some body to it.

This recipe was way too spicy and left my stomach in a mess. I do not recommend this recipe. Perhaps my chili or curry paste was spicier than average, but I didn't even add half of the spices and still it was spicy beyond being edible. I can't believe everyone else likes this recipe so much. Normally I can tolerate a good amount of spice, but this was just too much. Not for me...

We've been looking for ways to incorporate more beans & legumes into our menu and this recipe was a hit with the whole family!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, only substituting ground ginger for minced, fresh ginger. I still think it was fabulous. We served it over couscous with a little sour cream on top. Delicious...and really easy to make, too!

Very good-very easy too!  I've made this a few times--the first time I had made it, I felt it could use something "fresh" or green tasting...I added some peas the second time around at the very end of cooking and I was very pleased with the result...I've been adding little bits of this and that ever since.

Easy to make, but it was a bit too thick. It may have been my fault though, maybe I drained too much water from the lentils?

Awesome!  I made a few substitutions and it may be less authentically Indian, but still so delicious we couldn't stop eating it! Didn't have curry paste on hand, so added 1/8 tsp of cayenne, 1T of minced garlic and powdered ginger.  Chopped up 3 Roma tomatoes and used approx 2.5 cups of organic roasted red pepper tomato soup.  Great suggestion rinsing lentils first and simmering them for 8 min leaves them a little bit firm, but just right (especially for reheating).  In the end I added a handful of golden raisins! Thanks for posting this recipe!

I am taking all the credit for this -- I call it my best lentils ever!  But I followed the recipe exactly (well, I didn't actually measure anything, but all the proportions were relatively correct) and therefor the submitter should be acknowledged. The flavor is just fantastic, perfectly balanced, zesty and rich.  Thank you!

I didn't have any cilantro so I squeezed the juice of one lemon in to give it a zip and stirred in a couple of tablespoons of sour cream.  I didn't have canned tomatoes on hand (stuck in a blizzard and improvising) so I used some salsa. Cut back on the cumin and ground my own.  Wonderful.  Served it to my husband wrapped up in a warm flour tortilla.

This was way too chili-tasting. I like curries where you can taste the curry. My husband and I were kind of dissappointed. I would try this again, but I would not put any chili powder in there at all, and more ginger.

gotta retry with fresh, well-washed lentils. Threw coconut milk and fish sauce in it... and that was a bad combination of indian and thai curry elements.

YOWZERS this was spicy, but luckily I love spicy! (The only reason I'm not rating it a 5 is that perhaps there should have been a spice level warning-I'm the only one in the house that can eat it.) I'm chowing down as we speak. As always I don't have the exact ingredients/or want to substitute healthier ingredients. I didn't have red so I used brown lentils. Plus, I substituted honey for the white sugar. I served it with Jasmine rice. I'm in love :)  It really was easy to make.

I'm a curry lover and am never disappointed by curry dishes, but this was a truly original and delicious blend of tastes.  The only things I did a bit differently were to increase the curry by a bit and use a mix of half hot curry paste and half regular.  It was so good I'll likely be trying the sauce out on a chicken-based dish with other veggies soon.  Awesome!

Very good. Served it on top of rice cakes. Just the right amount of spice.

This recipe is so flavorful. I love it and I make it at least twice a month with garlic naan and brown basmati rice.

Man did the lentils expand.  Messy and seemed to be a lot of work but tasty.  Will stay in the recipe box for another time

I was missing a couple ingredients, so I had to modify the recipe for what I had on-hand, but this was still very tasty and easy to make for a quick, vegetarian dinner on a work night. I'm looking forward to trying this again!

This is a keeper--healthy, budget friendly, DELICIOUS!  No changes needed, recipe has a great balance of flavor as written.  Per others suggestions, it goes very well with Jasmine Rice http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Jasmine-Rice/Detail.aspx.

Wow!  So authentic!!  I totally forgot to add the garlic, and I didn't have any fresh ginger root so I used powdered ginger instead.  It turned out soo tasty with so many different flavors going on!  But red lentils apparently cook much faster than brown ones, so it was a bit mushy.  Next time I will serve it with a plain yogurt and basmati rice to cut the heat a bit. And I will shorten the cooking time of the lentils too.  I'm looking forward to doing what another reviewer did and use veg. broth to water it down into a soup for leftovers:)

This was really great ! I followed the recipe exactly and was so pleased with the results...I think next time I will add some more ginger root and maybe some more spices...I think it needed a little more kick, but I like my food spicy :)

Like many commenters here, I never leave reviews, but this dish was so good I had to!  I used ghee instead of veggie oil, chopped instead of pureed tomatoes, red curry paste, and a hot curry powder to add spice - the results were delicious and healthy!  This is an excellent recipe that could be easily modified to incorporate your fav veggies or legumes.  Definitely have rice with it though, both for texture and for health (complete protein if you're a veg'n). P.S. I hadn't cooked lentils many times before, but they EXPAND!  Use a bigger pot than you think you need because, as someone else pointed out, wet lentils stick to EVERYTHING

Fantastic. I changed the recipe slightly. I used ghee instead of vegetable oil. I omitted sugar and used coconut milk. I used cardomom, garam masala and tumeric/cumin blend for spices with the onion and three in some ginger and garlic as well. I added the coconut milk, a bit of lemon next and tossed all that with the lentils. delish! I suppose I also could have used a bit of stock and yogurt and that would have also worked well. I love curries and will continue to experiment with these.

I make a couple of changes: 3 TBS of RED curry paste (you really need the paste for this!), 2 TBS of curry powder.  I also add some ground Cardamom and Garam Masala as well.  I also put in some frozen peas at the end. It really tastes better if you carmalize the onions, but i dont always have time so i just saute them until tender, and it is still very good that way.

This was amazing!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but omitted the chili powder as my curry paste was already spicy enough for me.  I hope to make this again soon!

I don't actually like legumes, and almost never cook them, so I had high hopes, but realistic expectations.  This was great, and I didn't even have any curry paste!  My husband was a very happy man.

This is fabulous.  Very quick and easy!  I followed the recipe, only substituting tomato sauce for the tomato puree.  The puree would have made a nicer texture but this was still SOOOO good.  Will definitely make again!  Thank you!

Good base recipe. I way overcooked the lentils and ended up with a good tasting mush, so next time I will stick with about 10 minutes on the lentils.  I added a splash of lemon juice on my plate (my husband ate this with fresh pineapple) and that gave it just the right umph.

Well.. considering I totally messed up this recipe somehow it still came out pretty tasty so therefore I think it deserves a 4. My lentils turned to total mush, my curry stuck to the bottom of my pan and I didn't have enough rice.  Next time I won't attempt to make this recipe on a Monday lol.

Great curry!  I decided not to put it on rice, so I used the 8 serving recipe for four people and added a head of cauliflower for vegetables.  I also didn't have any tomato puree and my family doesn't like diced tomatoes, so I used tomato sauce instead.

Very good! Made exactly as the receipe says. I served it with basmati rice, and some saag paneer (Indian-style spinach-and-cheese). Since I had some leftovers, I thinned the red lentil curry with chicken broth the next evening to make a hearty (and quite spicy!) soup. Everyone liked it this way too!

This was a good recipe but I was expecting a bit more flavor. I know this must sound crazy considering all the spices that go into this recipe. I used a can of Hunt's tomato sauce (just pureed tomato without spices/herbs). I think it needs some fresh cut tomatoes. I did chop up a potato and threw in some frozen peas. I didn't use all the lentils, there were just way too many.

This was delicious! I took the advice of another reviewer and used the Muir Glen Fire Roasted Tomatoes, they were perfect. My only complaint was I felt the portion size was off. I felt it served less than the number stated.

This is awesome. I had never tried to make curry before, and this turned out tasty, hearty, and filling. I used a can of Muir Glen fire roasted crushed tomatoes as suggested by a previous reviewer and red curry paste. I paired it with Indian Naan II recipe from this site.  What a great meal!

I'm eating this as I type and it has a really good flavor. I've never made lentils before this so I think that next time I do I will definitely let them simmer longer. This dish wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be and I don't know if it was something that I did or not so next time I will probably add more heat to it. The flavor is still really nice, I'll make it again.

This is seriously tasty :)   I left out the ginger and the curry powder, as I didn't have these in, but it's still very, very nice.  Two batches have gone in the freezer for quick mid-week dinners, and I'll be having the rest later on with some basmati rice.  Thanks.

Excellent. Very easy to make. I used a can of diced tomatoes as I had no puree, also I didn't have any curry paste- this didn't seem to make a difference. Will make many times again!

This is a keeper!  I rescued this from the black hole of my recipe box today and am so glad I did.  Followed recipe exact with one exception; I thought I had tomato puree, but when I saw that I didn't, I had to improvise with leftover spaghetti sauce.  Didn't seem to matter as the taste is still wonderful.  Nice and spicy!  Watch your lentils as they do cook up very quickly. Thank you for posting this recipe!

A good mix of flavors, but even after I added water it came out very thick.  Next time I'll use canned tomatoes with just a dash of tomato paste to keep things together.  Also, I think this would be very good with a yogurt/cucumber dressing.

This recipe is a staple in our house. I make a large batch and freeze it into lunch size portions. I cook the lentils in chicken broth and water it down so it is more like a soup.

This recipe was lovely. My room-mate and I enjoyed it a lot, however, we both felt as though the spices could have been kicked up a bunch. Next time I will add more red pepper and possibly more onion. This recipe is certainly a keeper!

Very good, first time cooking lentils and I made it into a soup.  Added celery, carrots, cerano peppers, chicken stock and water.  (Dropped the cumin and only had ginger powder)  Everyone loved it and although I doubled the recipe 6 guys nearly finished it off.  Thanks for the great base.

Easy and delicious! My only change was to use half of a large can of stewed tomatoes instead of puree (I used the other half for matar paneer) and served this as a side dish, so I have plenty left over to freeze!

This is a great dish that is going to be a regular in my kitchen.  It is great now that I am on a limited budget, I have even used it in my wraps for lunch.  It was so easy to make and had just that flavor that I always tried for but never quite achieved before.

Meh. Maybe I have inappropriately high standards that I'm holding this recipe to, since I've had Indian food in India, but I wasn't particularly ecstatic about this recipe. I threw in some diced chicken breast while sauteeing onions, and added a chicken bouillion cube  in the lentil water. I'd make this again occasionally.

Good, but not a favorite. I did take a few liberties, like adding potatoes that I needed to use up and I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used dried. Maybe that's why it wasn't as fab as I expected.

This is a very tasty dish--nice and spicy but not overpowering. The only substitution I made was to use a 28oz can of diced tomatoes (undrained) instead of tomato paste. I ate it over Basmati rice. Will definitely make this regularly.

My husband and I liked this very much.  I rated it a 4 star because I made a few changes.  I used less hot ingredients, using only powdered curry, since we don't like real spicy foods.  I used chicken broth instead of water, to add flavor.  And used diced tomatos instead of tomato puree for added texture.

This was a great recipe.  I, of course, made a few changes as recommended, using 1 14 oz. can Muir Glen fire roasted tomatoes (with green chilis for extra heat), and a can of organic coconut milk to the end.  It was a huge hit!

I make this all the time. However, I use madras curry paste instead of the curry powder and paste and I use a big can of diced tomatoes instead of the pureed ones. I also like to toss in some frozen peas. I serve with roti instead of rice. So, so yummy!

Remarkably tasty, easy, yet too firey the first go!  I remember hesitating for a moment with the curry paste (I think I actually did a double-take on the measurement) but I left the recipe unaltered.  Thumbs up for my fire breathing guests, but for me...I would rather have been forewarned.

Absolutely excellent!  A big hit even with my parents, who aren't too adventurous, so I didn't use the curry paste, just more curry powder. Thanks for this new staple in my menus!

An above average lentil curry recipe.  Works well as one of a selection of dishes, but not by itself.  Really good with plain yogurt on top.

Wonderful recipe!  I served it over jasmine rice with fresh green peas added in the rice cooker.  My meat eating family had no idea there wasn't any meat in it.  It cooked up quick and easy and I'll be making it often.  I didn't have tomato puree so instead I dropped a can of diced tomatoes into the food processor and gave them a whirl.  I'm hoping there will be left overs tomorrow, but it doesn't look like there will be.

Very good recipe! I made it with a red and yellow mini tomato sauce direct from the garden. I omit turmeric since I didn`t have any. I added celery while cooking the onion and next time i'll add cauliflower wich is very good with curry and maybe a chili pepper even if its already very good. if you don`t let the lentils become dry, the texture is very good. We had enough for dinner and lunch for 2 adult +1 child. It is a very nutritious and inexpensive vegan recipe. Enjoy!

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe and used the fire roasted canned tomatoes as suggested by another reviewer. I also increased the garlic and added a seeded, chopped jalepeno because I like it spicy. I was not able to find curry paste at my local market so I left it out but this dish still came out great! Served it with jasmine rice, chicken and steamed veggies. It would make a great lighter meal all on its own. Might increase the heat with more jalepenos next time!

Liked this OK, but with Asian/Indian type ethnic foods we like something other than just "hot" flavor.  I only tasted "hot" & ginger.  I did use "chili powder" for this type of food, not the US version that you make chili with.

Fabulous stuff. Easy, quick, and delicious--really hits those Indian food cravings. I reduced the recipe by 1/4, used 1 T of hot curry paste and the heat level was perfect. Lentils got a little mushy, but they taste great anyway.  Thanks for sharing this!

This dish ultimately was very good. I did not realize that red lentils cook so quickly - mine were mush within ten minutes.  Also, I would have been wise to learn from other reviews which made reference to reducing the amount of curry paste.  It was so spicy that my husband was not able to eat it.  The flavor, however is right on.  I will definitely make it again (probably when hubby is out of town).

Okay.  Works well mixed with a little rice.   I followed the
directions on this recipe and elsewhere on the internet to rinse and rinse
and rinse the lentils.  But they still ended up as mush!  Did I overcook
them?  Did I add too much water?  I don't know.  They tasted fine in the
result, but didn't look very good.  The flavor as a whole was okay;   
the tomato was similar to but worse than that of the Indian Tomato Chicken
recipe.  It could almost be a four star but it looked so unappetizing (and
I don't know how to fix that!).

This is delicious! Didn't alter a thing however it was a little too spicy for us-and Indian food is our favorite so we are very used to hot. Perhaps my curry paste was unusually spicy. Will definately make again!

maybe it was because I followed the recipe exactly and didn't make any changes, but I thought this was a pretty bland dish. high on spice, low on flavor, extremely basic. not my thing.
