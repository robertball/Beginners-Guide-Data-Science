i havent tried this recipe yet.but wanted to share some info about using fresh coconut which is used widely in most of the asian cuisines.simple way to break open a fresh coconut which we use back home is to simply dip the whole coconut in  a bucket of water for 5 min.then hit it on some hard object to crack it a bit.once cracked keep a  strainer to filter and catch the coconut water.once 2 get 2 halves keep it in the fridge for few hrs ( this makes the coconut to loosen from the shell).then with a knife cut chunks of the flesh and put in the food processor .this gives a nice flaky coconut .hope this is useful and do write about how this method worked for u all.thanks

Wonderful desert.  I like mile high cakes.  I would like to share a tip for the frosting.  You should use a candy thermometer to watch the sugar.  I doubled the frosting.  After the sugar mixture reaches the correct temp (soft ball) remove from heat and wait about ten mins before you beat the whites.  After you stream the the sugar mixture into the whites let the mix cool off before you add it to the whipped marshmallow.  You can do this by letting it beat on high for up to 12 mins. If not the butter will melt and you may end up with soup.  (your looking for about 85degrees.  Then I just drop in 2 tbls at a time of room temp butter.  If it seems a bit soft (too runny to spread) just place the whole mix in the fridge for 5 mins. and whip again.  But be careful not to let it build condensation while in the fridge or the whole thing will collapse.

Very good!! I cut the recipe in 1/3 and still came out with a very good 2 layer cake.  Added a little more sugar, and substituted the coconut-water instead of plain old water.  Had a bit of trouble too, like the review above, with the icing, but all in all, it still came out yummy.

Here's a hint on how to use fresh coconut, (I had to do a bit of research!)   Crack coconut open, carefully, you can do this with a screwdriver and a hammer into one of the "eyes", and pour out & save the coconut water.  Once you have the coconut in large pieces, (halves more or less) put them on a cookie sheet in an oven heated to 250^ for 10-15 minutes.  This will make the meat loosen up a bit from the shell and easier to get out.  You'll still probably have to pry.  Then there is another layer of brown skin you'll have to slice off with a paring knife before you throw the meat into the food processor.  :)  It's a little bit of work, but definitely worth it in the end.

I've been searching for a coconut cake recipe that would be as good as my late grandmother's recipe (now lost).  My dad said this was close and everyone else just raved about it. Perfect for those special occaisions.  Also, due to time constraints, I did not use a fresh coconut and substituted canned coconut (much more moist than bagged coconut.)  The results were still fabulous.  Thanks!

This cake was a very good use for a fresh coconut.  It's lasted and tasted fresh for 1 1/2 weeks so far. Just put the bottom layer in the freezer. It was simply delicious! Not too sweet, firm, you can tell it's a from scratch cake. Took from 9-2 to make, starting with opening the coconut. There are good hints below about making the old fashioned cooked frosting, which I followed, which was really tasty! It turned out perfect. Might double the frosting recipe next time, to decorate the sides of the cake. It was for a birthday party, looked adorable and everyone loved it!

I made this cake for Easter and won rave reviews for it. I added a tsp. of almond extract plus the vanilla and it was wonderful. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this for the first time, following the directions exactly, and it was perfect! I couldn't have been happier. I did double the frosting to make enough to cover the sides, which was good. Beautiful cake, and wonderful flavor/texture! This is going to be a stand-by.

The cake part of this was pretty good.  Very rich, but tasty.  I had trouble with the frosting, but I haven't made cooked frosting very much and I probably did something wrong.

Good cake. Frosting tricky. I would double it if you want to frost sides. I did not use fresh coconut. I mixed Coco Lopez cream of coconut with milk to make up the 1 cup of milk asked for. And had coconut flakes from the bag that work fine. I used 1/2 less sugar for batter, since both modifications mentioned will add significant sweetness. Baked in 2 pans and split the layers, spread Raspberry preserves inbetween. And drizzled left over cream of coconut & milk mix on it. Good basic white cake recipe that can be modified to just about anything. Fun cake to do when snowed in.

This is a good recipe I didn't do the fresh coconut though.  I used the bag stuff and I couldnt find coconut milk so I use coconut water and regular milk together.  I didn't make the icing that was suggested.  I made a coconut cream cheese icing. I separated it and folded in cool whip to put between the layers.  I then took the remaining icing and cover the cake.  Then I placed coconut on the entire perimeter of the cake. Was a huge hit at the office.  This cake was the tallest cake I have ever made! It was almost 5 inches tall!!! WOW!! Recipe is a keeper.

The instructions for this recipe are off.  The ingredient list calls for 1 cup of milk, then never states what to do with it.  I know the directions stated to top off the coconut water to equal one cup, so I figured that's what that 1 cup of milk was for...but it's not.  You have to add it to the cake batter or it comes out tasting like flour and is dry.  The icing is terrible.  I spent half the afternoon shelling and grating a fresh coconut, then having to remake the icing using my own recipe for cream cheese frosting, only for it all to taste like a load of  except for my frosting.  Do not make this, it's not worth the hassle.  The recipes using a white cake mix are much better.

Well worth the work!  I did this with a hand mixer and an EZ Break coconut, and it worked out beautifully.  My food processor doesn't have a meat grater, so just grate the whole coconut and be done with it.  The frosting is delightful and not nearly as difficult as several other reviewers made it sound, though it only made enough to top each layer.  Still, the cake looked elegant and tasted divine!

We did not like the frosting.  It was too buttery.  I would have preferred something lighter.

I baked this cake as just two (thicker) layers, using the stated quantities, which worked out fine.  Per another reviewer's suggestion I added one entire cup of milk in addition to "topping up" the coconut milk to 1 c -- and the result was really a bit TOO moist.  A bit less "extra" milk would be better.  I used the icing recipe as well and liked it -- I have not made cooked frostings much but did not have any trouble with this one.

This cake was a dissapointment to me. Neither my husband or I cared for it much, just ok. More work involved than other cakes and no real payback for it.

I only made the frosting from this recipe and it did not come out well. Although I followed the instructions exactly I found that it came out syrupy sweet and too thin.

This cake was EXCEPTIONAL! It had a moist, dense crumb, fabulous flavor. Everyone who ate it raved. I used a raspberry filling and cream cheese frosting with it, however, and it was really a great combination.
