These are delicious!  I would definitely recommend melting the butter and then adding the rest of the ingredients before mixing in the warm cashews.  For the salt sensitive, I'd go short and then see what you think.  Thanks for the recipe!

These nuts are a delicious treat! Everyone likes spiced nuts, and these are a unique take on an old favorite. The rosemary flavor is unusual and special; the brown sugar and cayenne adds enough heat/sweet to perk your palate and make you do a double-take. (What spiced nuts are these?!) The salt adds a tiny bit of crispy crunch. And I used salted butter. I was introduced to these cashews when visiting my brother, who'd received them as a Christmas treat. When I was gifted a big tin of cashews the following Christmas, I decided to make them myself. Make sure you watch the oven carefully -- depending on the heat of your oven (ours runs hot) and the size of the cashews, they may cook a little quicker than expected, and as with all nuts, you will taste a burned flavor if they're even a little overdone. I'm not speaking from experience at all. ;-) These would be delicious made with almonds, too.

I've been making these for years. My brother LOVES them, as does everyone!  I've tried increasing the butter, but it just makes them greasy and they never fully dry, so don't do that!  But I do recommend increasing the rosemary if you love it as much as I do!

This recipe is addictive. In fact, we don't like plain cashews much anymore. I do cut the salt to two teaspoons and I cut the cayenne in half cuz I am a whimp when it comes to heat. Awesome recipe Boombatine. Thanks for sharing!

These nuts were delicious but too salty. I was very confused if I should buy raw or roasted cashews. The recipe only said unsalted. I chose raw. I researched how to roast raw cashews to check baking times and compare them to the recipe. Everything I found on roasting raw cashews recommended 10-15 minutes at 325-350 degrees. Given this info, I reduced my oven temp to 350 and roasted my raw cashews for 12 minutes, stirring them every 3-4 minutes until beginning to brown. 
I used salted butter and 1 tbsp. of table salt on my first batch (that's what I had on hand). The cashews were too salty for me and I do not normally find foods too salty. I reduced the salt by half on my second batch and loved them! The fresh rosemary was wonderful. My son and daughter also thought they were amazing and couldn't stop eating them (even the salty batch!).
Perhaps if I had used kosher salt, 1 tbsp. would be appropriate but if you use regular table salt, I recommend reducing the salt.

Easy to make, just remember if you are using raw cashews, bake a little longer for desired crispness.

I loved almost everything about this recipe.   I thought 1 T of salt was too salty.  I used raw cashews.  I would make it again.

I've never really been one to snack on a handful of nuts. I usually find them too bland, too dry, or too salty, but these cashews were great! I love the subtle sweetness from the brown sugar, and the rosemary gave the nuts an unusual (but pleasant) flavor. I think I will use this technique to experiment with other nuts, herbs, and spices. Thanks for sharing!

Big hit with everyone! This recipe is so easy. Do not add more butter thinking it will be better, it won't. I follow the recipe exactly because it is amazing! Well, I do cut back to 1/2 tsp.  on the cayenne because the full teaspoon would be crazy! You won't be sorry you made these.  Also, margarine? Does anyone use margarine anymore? Throw that  out and use real butter!

We absolutely LOVE this snack!  I made two minor changes:  I use 2 tablespoons of melted butter and only 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Tastes great!!

I chopped the rosemary finely and went a bit light on the amount. This is a great recipe... hard for us to leave it alone so there is enough left for guests!

Wonderful!  I used what I had on hand as follows and it turned out great:  salted cashews, unsalted butter, and half the kosher salt.   Let cool and store air tight...great as gifts!

After slaving all day over a variety of hors d'oeuvres .. I must say I got the most compliments on these cashews. Didn't quite read the recipe closely so I mixed all the ingredients THEN put the cashews in the oven to broil. Watched carefully as the brown sugar caramelized a bit. This added a crusted coating that I really liked. They were such a hit! Delicious!

I have been making this for a long time.  Absolutely fabulous!  I make a second batch without rosemary because we have one poor soul in the family who does not like rosemary.
