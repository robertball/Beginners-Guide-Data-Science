Loved this recipe, but I changed it alittle...used 28oz. can of crushed tomatoes only; reduced the stock to 1/2c; and added a 1/4 teaspoon each of allspice and ground cloves put everything in a crock pot and cooked on low for 5 hours. I served it with bulger wheat.

The flavour of this was very good, although I may use more lemon next time to get the zing I expect from Greek lamb dishes.  Instead of chopped fresh tomatoes and tomoato sauce I just used to cans of chopped tomatoes and it worked fine.  The sauce seemed to be a lot of very thin liquid, which I will thicken next time I make this as it just ran straight through the rice I served it with.

I was quite hopeful that I would enjoy this one but the lemon flavour just overpowered everything else...even the lamb!  Half a lemon was definitely too much...it was almost inedible.  If you decide to make this one I would add the lemon gradually to suit your individual taste.

This was wonderful! I left out the lemon due to personal prefences and cooked it in the slow cooker for 5 hours on high. I used the Mavrodaphne (Greek dessert wine) I had on hand, which gave the stew a nice sweet overtone.

I found a deal on lamb shoulder chops and without having a clue what to do with them, I snatched them up! Luckily I found this recipe. With the exception of using chicken stock in place of lamb stock, I followed the directions to a T. Just before adding the green beans, I tasted the broth and added more oregano and cinnamon and also a bit of brown sugar to cut the acid of the tomatoes. I gave the green beans 30 minutes because we like them a bit soft in stews. Surprisingly, it was a hit with the family! Next time I'll pay more attention to trimming the fat off those chops! Even better..this would be great with lamb stew meat!.

Great stew! I added a chopped red bell pepper toward the end, put in less tomatoes, used a bit more parsley fresh from our garden, and used dried red chinese hot pepper instead of black pepper. We all loved it!

Very tasty.  Used nearly 2 lbs cubed shoulder roast meat and 1 each of canned diced tomatoes, crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce.  Used two cans of green beans, chicken broth and about 1 cup burgandy wine.

I had this for dinner tonight cooked in the slow cooker, definitely a keeper but needs a bit of tweaking for my tastes.  As I ate it I kept thinking something was really missing - realised it was mushrooms and possibly a pinch of crushed dried chilis.  I had cheated on the original already by using canned diced tomatoes with tomato paste instead of fresh with canned sauce, and adding carrots and eggplant (because they were there).  Ate with fresh bread which sopped up the juice, it was delicious even without mushrooms.

I used 3lbs cubed lamb shank, but otherwise made as written.  Served over orzo with a bit of crusty sourdough bread for the sauce. Very, very good!

I have a lot of lamb so a doubled the meat.  I used 2 cans of spiced tomato then grilled zucchini and added last minute I did not have mint so used tarragon leaves at the end.  I combined the initial ingredients on the stove then put in the slow cooker for 4 hours.  I added big slices of raw onion in the base of the slow cooker. Everyone had seconds.

Very flavorful dish!  My husband and I made this for dinner last night.  One lb. of lamb shoulder blade chops would not feed four adults, we used two lbs., and have enough for another meal.  Used chicken stock instead of lamb stock, and cut cinnamon to 1/4 tsp.  you could still taste the cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. was plenty. Served over white rice. Delicious!

I changed a few things. I didn't have lamb stock so used beef with reduced sodium and used diced tomato. I also used the slow cooker to cook it instead of the stove top until the lamb was finished and started coming off the bone. very juicy. I also added a but more lamb not much more though. I enjoyed it.

So far so good, just got 1.5 lbs of prebrowned lamb stew meat in the crock pot with 14 oz tomato sauce and two cans hand crushed whole tomatoes. I had previously browned the meat with an onion so added 2 TBL of dried onion to boost the flavor. Had beef broth (no wine) and Penzey's lamb seasoning and homegrown/dried oregano, & fresh garlic.  I will add my frozen/thawed haricot vert the last hour of cooking and plan to serve it over orzo and with crusty bread...I'll add the lemon at the last to taste and I'll let you know how it turns out :) well it turned out a little too wet for my taste so next time I'll drain the canned tomatoes OR not add the sauce. The flavor was good and I loved the orzo to which I added butter, a sprinkle of granulated garlic, dried crushed  parsley and a handful of grated parm...yum. Altogether yummy I will make again with some some small tweaks...

This was very tasty. The only suggestion I have is to increase the amount of meat to 1 1/2 pounds.
