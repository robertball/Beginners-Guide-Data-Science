For a more authentic flavor: I add a copule more ingredients. Use pork stew meat and cook it with a lil bit of olive oil, fresh grated ginger, chopped up garlic, jalapeno and green onion (i love garlic and jalapenos so I use a lot of it. approx 5-6 peppers and 5-6 cloves of garlic). Then I add the kimchi and kimchi brine. Also, instead of using water I use chicken broth. When it's almost done I chop up tofu and throw it in the pot. Let it boil for a couple of minutes and it's all done and delicious! (I use the medium tofu - not the soft or hard)

I like to make Kimchi jigeh stew, but I always do in a different way. First of all, I add more vegetables, such as carrots, onions, green onions, bean sprouts, mushrooms and tofu. I usually use sliced pork meat or substitute knnyaku (Which is a Japanese vegetarian ingredient) for meat. Then, I taste the soup with Korean spicy paste (e.g. gochu jang) and miso paste. Don't forget adding minced ginger and garlic. This gives a great flavor to the soup.

This is a great dish to be served with rice as well as other korean sides. 

One of my fav. dishes to make.... I was always taught a diff. recipe as all recipes differ from family to family.

I suggest adding some beef bouilon or chicken... adds a great deal of flavor.... if you don't like to use spam you could use tuna or my fave. cubed pieces of pork or my mom would always find these pork things on bones...but were tiny...not sure if they were ribs or not. but very yummy! 

you can add any meat to your liking.... just needs to be cooked till the meat is cooked all the way through.

This was a great soup! I used 1/3 of a 16oz jar of Kimchi, 2 cups of water, 1 Tbl chili powder, a clove of crushed garlic, and cubed smoked tofu. Didn't bother adding salt or pepper.

I just finished making this and I rated it with 4 stars instead of 5 only because I went with the previous reviewer and added broth instead of water so I don't know how it would taste with water.  I added veggie broth only because that was what I had on hand and let me tell you, yummmmy!!!  My Korean step-mom use to make this all the time and I never realized how easy it was...  Thanks for sharing this recipe....

This recipe required too much adjustment.  I used all of the ingredients except salt, added Kimchi I purchased from the local Korean market with some cooked pork belly. These additions gave it a great taste. Use soup broth instead of water and green onions.

Really easy and quick. I add couple cloves of garlic and onions, and sometimes add instant noodles (esp. neoguri ramen) at the end :) I also probably put about 4 cups of kimchi.. the more the better :)

It is best to use pork in this recipe.  The pork shoulder is a good choice of meat.  Another choice, would be to use spam and smoked sausages.  The key is to use great tasting overly fermented kimchi and gochugaru straight from Korea.

Thin pork chops work really well.  Also, my mom used to use cut up hot dogs when we were little.  Try adding a touch of sugar too, taste better with a little sweetness.  Always a family favorite!

A few weeks ago, I made the "Spicy Cabbage Kimchi" recipe. I thought it was way too salty, and most of the reviews agreed.  So, it sat in my fridge, uneaten.  However, I used it to make this Korean Kimchi Jigeh Stew today, and the result was very tasty indeed!  I used some chicken instead of Spam, because I can't bring myself to eat Spam, and I didn't add any salt -- due to the aforementioned salty kimchi.

I made this delicious stew with unsalted, boxed chicken broth and the remains of a batch of homemade napa cabbage kimchi that had been fermenting in the refrigerator for two months. Served in a flat bowl with a pile of rice in the middle, it was a very tasty, satisfying one-dish meal. I will make this every time I have aged kimchi, with just one change--I'll  probably quick-fry the Spam cubes in a little oil before adding them to the stew for a bit more texture and meat flavor. Kimchi and Spam rule!

Yummy! I used pork chops, thinly sliced, instead of spam and chicken broth instead of water. I also added sliced onions, cabbage and tofu.

Don't forget to add the Korean Hot Pepper Paste (Gochujang) to taste. You can find it in Korean store or any asian stores that sell Korean food. Use the miso paste for the soup base (just a light taste of it). Add some dried lily flowers, onions (i like it when the onions become soft), chopped jalapeño and minced garlic. Salt and pepper to taste. You can also add 1tp of soy sauce if you like it. Boil for 5 mins, then add the medium-soft tofu (cubes) and cover for 2 mins. Serve with cut shallots on top.
