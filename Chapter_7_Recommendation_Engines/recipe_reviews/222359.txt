YUM! The marinade gave the mushrooms a wonderful flavor. The mayo was great, but a bit spicy for me, so I'd reduce the cayenne next time, but that's my preference. Instead of roasting a pepper, I had a jar of roasted peppers and onions, so I went w/ that...perfect! I served these on 'Soft Onion Sandwich Rolls' also from this site. I will be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was excellent!!! However, I didnt really measure the ingredients for the marinade and it turned out great. Also, make sure to use a good quality balsamic vinegar,it does make a huge differernce (no matter the recipe), a good balsalmic is on the thicker side. I also grilled slice beefsteak tomato slices on the grill and added a slice of sharp cheddar to compliment my shroom.

My husband and I really enjoyed these.  I liked the fact that it used simple ingredients I had on hand.  The red pepper mayo was delicious.  I also did not use as much cayenne as it called for.  Just about 6 dashes and it was plenty hot.  I could only marinate for 1 1/2 hours and the flavor was perfect.

Blech!  Maybe I did something wrong because the other reviews seem to be great, but the mushrooms soaked up so much of the marinade that all we could taste was the vinegar.  The mayonnaise was good, but I won't be trying these burgers again.

For those who felt the Balsamic was overpowering - I use White Balsamic almost exclusively.  A bit lighter and doesn't seem as sweet.  Many kinds available - I like the Peach.

I tried this recipe yesterday.  I am working on one vegetarian meal a week.  It was okay but I wouldn't make it again.

This was good.  I like the marinade for the mushrooms but what was so outstanding was the red pepper mayo!!  So simple yet so good.
