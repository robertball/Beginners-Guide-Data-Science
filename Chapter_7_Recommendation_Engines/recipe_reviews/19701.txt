I was looking for a good clam dip and this is it! I used regular cottage cheese and sour cream. I think fat-free is just to bland. I also substituted chopped clams for minced and used scallions instead of grated onion for some color. Thanks Joane!!

I followed this recipe exactly and was surprised; it did not have any flavor - could not taste the clams at all!  Maybe it was the brand of clams I used?? Neither wanting to waste the ingredients, nor having any more clams, I added some onion soup mix, some more black pepper and half a grated onion.  Then it was pretty good, even improved the texture, but still not what l was looking for - a great low-fat clam dip recipe.

My old boss use to make this, it was so good. I used regular cottage cheese and sour cream. And I only had 2 cups of cottage cheese so I put in 1/2 cup of sour cream. Turned out pretty close to what I had before... good enough to eat right away, but I think you're suppose to refrigerate it overnight or something. :)

This is an okay dip, as written, but it really needs more "oomph." I and my co-workers didn't get enough of the clam taste. I like the idea of using cottage cheese, but I think more tweaking is in order.

I'll give it 4 cuz I zooped it up from the get-go from the reviews. 1/2 tsp. onion had to be a mistake. 2c.cottage, 1/2c.yogurt/sourcream, 1/4c. onion/scallion/leeks/chives, 1 can of clams drained - I used whole, slightly chopped; dill cilantro paprika, ground black pepper. Loosen w as much lemon and clam juice as it will take. Could also add minced jalapeno, celery and/or roast red pepper.
