This recipe sounded good but it wasn't.  The combination of the pineapple, oranges and their juices along with the lemon pudding produced a bitter acidic tang on your tongue.  I was disappointed because it sounded like a very fresh combo. Everyone in my family said the same thing.  I'm glad I tried it out before I took along to Thanksgiving at my mother-in-laws!

I was sceptical after reading some of the reviews.  However, I prepared this but omitted the nuts and I used the pineapple chunks that are in their own juice (no sugar added).  My family really liked it.  My husband did request that I add more bananas in the future.

Very tasty!  I did use sugar free vanilla pudding instead.  Fresh and tropical.

I prepared the pudding mix with 1 cup milk and 1 cup whipped cream instead of the fruit juices to make a thicker salad. This is nicely sweet. Nuts add a good crunch.

What a mystery! Tried this recipe out on my beach buddies, total consensus was, what is this missing? too sweet, all you can taste is the lemon pudding. Adding whip cream might help.

I had no lemon pudding mix and from the sound of the reviews, I'm glad i didn't. instead I used sugar free cheesecake pudding mix, some grated lemon zest and the juice of 1 lemon, alomg with just the pineapple juice from pineapple tidbits. My family liked the flavor but thought it was too loose. I agree with another reviewer that it would be better with Cool Whip or whip cream folded into it. All in all it was good and a change from my usual fruit salad.

This recipe is really good.  When I make it I omit the nuts and use cheesecake flavored pudding.  Makes a big difference.

This recipe is the same thing my mother used to make in the 70's during the Tang craze! The only differnce in the two is instead of the lemon pudding mix use 1/2 cup Tang was a childhood fav I had forgotten about.

I agree with a previous reviewer that this was a bit tart and the lemon pudding taste was too prominent.  Even though I gave the recipe only 3 stars, I like the idea of such a refreshing salad that can be made early in the day and will try it again with a different flavor pudding.
