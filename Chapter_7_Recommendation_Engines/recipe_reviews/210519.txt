Sometimes I use a variety of substitutes, such as regular cane sugar and lemon juice instead of the tamarind paste, but the overall effect is still delicious. The dish tastes sweet and then explodes with heat in the back of the throat. Great over rice or with extra vegetables if you need to stretch the meal.

I'm eating this as I type this review. This is a very satisfying egg dish. The heat is just right and it has a slight sweet/ salty thing going on. I didn't have jaggery, so I used 2 tablespoons of white sugar which is a perfect amount of sweetness for this recipe. I'm a cilantro junkie, so I have a nice pile of fresh cilantro on top of this. It's not the prettiest food you will ever eat, but it is definitely worth making!

Overall, this is a tasty dish, a good breakfast meal, but boiled eggs with the spicy sauce was a little strange and unusual for us that is the reason I give 4 stars. This dish makes very interesting breakfast.
