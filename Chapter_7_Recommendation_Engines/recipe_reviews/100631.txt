This was pretty good, but my husband doesn't go for sweet flavors when they are warm, so it wasn't his favorite.  I thought the sauce was especially good.  I used flank steak in place of the filet mignon.

I'm sorry this just wasn't for us. I love a filet and am sad to have messed with the flavor by marinating it in such a way.  We also didn't like the mayo. I would suggest using ribeye to try this before investing in the filet.  I thought about doing that, but chose to make the recipe as is the first time in order to give it a proper review.  I'm sorry I just think the flavors weren't for us.
