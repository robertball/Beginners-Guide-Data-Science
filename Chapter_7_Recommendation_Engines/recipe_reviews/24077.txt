This was a wonderful salad!! I have made it several times.  It is good on hot days or when you want it to work as a side dish. Although I only used regular rotini noodles instead of the colored ones, I am willing to try both.  It is also a tasty way to get kids to eat their vegetables!! Mine loved it!!  Also, I brought it to a recent family reunion and I had none to bring back home with me!  Thank you Melissa!

I was skeptical...but this was GREAT.  I used all leftovers from the fridge -- spaghetti noodles, steamed carrots and cauliflower.  I omitted the onion (didn't want) and brocolli (didn't have), substituted red bell pepper for green, and used lowfat "parmesan peppercorn ranch" dressing.  I've been dieting and made this for a quick lunch yesterday.  Give it a try.  The pasta really mellows out the peppercorn taste in the dressing.  I'll save all my leftover dinner veggies from now on to use in this salad!

We didn't really like this recipe.  The Ranch just didn't appeal to us and we are a family of Ranch dressing eaters.  I won't make again.

What I love about pasta salads is how forgiving they are... you can take the basic concept and use what you have on hand and it'll always work out. I used grape tomatoes, carrots, black olives, sweet peppers, and cucumbers with the Peppercorn Ranch. Yum. :)

This was a really good recipe that seemed to please the whole family. As vegetarians it can be a challenge to find recipes that have a lot of veggies but are still kid friendly. This was a hit! I made a few changes and used the ranch dressing mix that comes in a powder and mixed it with half milk and half sour cream for a creamier texture then mixed in cracked peppercorns. Also, I reserved half of the mixture until right before I served it so it wouldn't all soak into the pasta. I also added soy bacon bits and peas right before serving. This would be great for a barbecue or chuch picnic.

Good salad!  I subbed red (bell) pepper instead of green & added some cubbed ham.  I had to take a portion (1 c.) of the salad out and leave it plain for the baby (egg alergy = no ranch for him) but he ate all that I gave him.  I did only use 1/2 of the dressing, not because I took out a cup, but for a personal prefference.  Thanks Lindsay!

I usually make pasta salads with an oil and vinegar based dressing so this was new for me. I liked it. It was great at my cookout.

This is a very good recipe.  I made one small change due to the fact that I had extra celery on hand that I wanted to use up, so I added it in.  It was still very tasty.  I think this is a very versatile recipe in that you can probably add just about any kind of veggie you like.  It's a keeper!

I could not find peppercorn ranch dressing, but I found that the Parmesan Ranch I substituted was very tasty, and this is a great potluck pleaser!

Great pasta salad side dish. I love peppercorn ranch so I was excited to see this recipe. Followed recipe exact except used white onion for the red onion. Will make again!!!

Not bad. Very simple to prepare but I felt it needed a bit more flavor. Added some parmesan and a few little additional spices. Used red pepper instead of green.

My boyfriend really liked this recipe but I unfortunately found it a little bland. I would make it again but would definitely add some of my own spices and ideas :)

I used a homemade lowfat peppercorn ranch recipe that I ganked from this site and red pepper only because we don't like green. I liked this but noone else did. I don't eat a whole ton of pasta/carbs so this was just kind of a bummer all around because I'd be the only one who would eat it. The recipe really depends on how good your dressing is. I think it could use some cheese, too.

Simple and tasty.  Very good for vegetarians looking for something they can use all their "about to go bad" veggies up on.

very good. i didn't think i would like it. it's kinda heavy when you eat a big serving of it, and you definitely have a strong pepper taste from the peppercorn ranch dressing. i added chopped tomatoes too with plain rotini

What a versatile recipe! I followed the recipe to the letter for a memorial day get together and returned home with none left. Plus, I had given out the recipe to five friends/family. I can't see how different veggies would negatively affect this great and easy dish!

This was pretty great. We both thought it tasted a little flat though (could just be the dressing I used?), but a good hit of salt and pepper and that was fixed.
