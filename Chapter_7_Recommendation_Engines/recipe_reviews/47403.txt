Awesome- so super creamy!  I added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch because the other reviews had me worried about the pudding setting up.  I'm not sure if I really needed it but it turned out fabulous!  The perfect comfort food in the middle of a South Dakota snowstorm!  My husband snitched so much of it that I had to make another batch to have enough for our kids!  :)  Enjoy!

I was really looking forward to tasting the result of this recipe, because I live in a foreign country and butterscotch flavored anything cannot be found here. Unfortunately, I found the flavor very mild, with more of just a "sweet" taste than anything else. Mid-way through cooking, however, I tasted the milk/sugar mixture, just before putting in the egg, and before adding the vanilla. I actually thought that it tasted more like butterscotch at that point, than at the end. I think I will try this again, but I will make some changes. I will either increase the amount of brown sugar used in the recipe, or I will try using dark brown sugar instead of the light brown sugar that I used. Also, I think I will omit the vanilla.

Awsome.  I have been looking for a good butterscotch pudding for a long time!  The only change I made was to add a bit of butterscotch schnapps - I like it Really butterscotchy!

yum yum!  Don't stir again after you finish stirring the butter in, or it will get grainy.  I also added about a tablespoon of scotch whiskey for flavor- it is butterSCOTCH, after all.

Much better than packaged pudding. Its worth it if you have the time and want to try it from scratch. Don't expect the overly strong, pre-processed taste. This butterscotch flavor is more subtle. I was a little paranoid about the tempering part but it turned out fine.

This beats packaged butterscotch pudding! Really liked it and can't wait to fix it for my daughter and family when they come to Wyoming to visit. Butterscotch is her very favorite.

Excellent recipe. Use real butter and even better with slightly less sugar and only two egg yolks.

Great flavor, especially warm.  Faster to make than homemade puddings which don't use cornstarch, but didn't really set up until chilled.

This was good. I used half dark brown and half light brown sugar. and cut it back to 3/4 cup. Next time I'll try with all dark brown sugar to give it a richer flavour. 3/4 cup was perfect, it would've been way to sweet without it. I also mixed the sugar mixture with the cold milk and cooked it together instead of boiling the milk first. It got super thick and perfect.

I did 4 egg yolks instead of 3, added just a tad bit more cornstarch and changed 3 cups milk to 1 c heavy cream and 2 c milk.  I did this because I wanted it thicker for pie.  I also did the directions like I do for chocolate pie.  I used a mixer and beat brown sugar and eggs.  I added cornstarch and salt.  Then did the same as written to add butter and vanilla after taking off stove. Yummy!

I was a bit intimidated by the tempering but it was okay.  I followed the directions exactly.  When mixing the paste I used about 1/4 cup of milk and it was perfect.  The flavor was mild but still tasty enough to be identified as butterscotch.  My kids said it was so creamy!  If it helps anyone, I used low fat milk and had no issues with thickness.

UPDATE:  They aren't kidding when they say best served warm.  It was actually pretty gross the next day.

I used this as a pie filling in a crumb crust. The pudding thickened nicely, but lacked a strong butterscotch flavor.

I see that a couple people had problems with the thickness of the pudding. I think it may be because their actually boiling milk. Scalding (bringing milk to JUST BEFORE boil) helps better with thickening pudding. My favorite recipe to make is a Old-Fashioned Banana Cream Pie With Graham Cracker Crust and the filling isnt made with storebought pudding, I make it myself. Learnt quickly that over boiling can cause a coupy texture! Maybe that will help! :)

This recipe 'may' get the butterscotch flavor using DARK brown sugar. As is, with brown sugar, it tastes like extremely sweet and mostly flavorless pudding. It has a nice texture and consistency, though (I used 2% milk).

I am not a fan of this recipe.  Even using dark brown sugar, as suggested, it didn't have a strong enough butterscotch flavor.  It was extremely sweet, and not creamy enough.

It is OK, but way too sweet for me. Next time I will try putting in 2/3 cup of sugar, instead of the recommended 1 cup. I also might rely a little more heavily on extra egg yolk, and cut back a bit on the corn starch, because I can taste the cornstarch. The consistency is nice. It didn't get a rubbery skin on it like the chocolate and vanilla pudding recipes I have used, which some people might like. I think that is probably due to the butter in the recipe. 

I think this would be better with something, like maybe in a bread pudding, or as a topping for some kind of cake.

Wow! So good! I was out of vanilla extract so I used almond extract and it was still amazing! I don't even know if I want to try making it with vanilla as this was just so good. Easy and fast, and I already had everything in my house.  Love this recipe!

Yum!  We really liked this pudding and it was pretty easy to make.  I would like to try it next time with dark brown sugar as some others mentioned because I used light.  It only has a mild butterscotch flavor, but we still enjoyed it and will make it again.

This pudding was delicious! It reminded me of old-fashioned pudding my mom used to make. Also, it is great for butterscotch pie filling. I have also used white sugar and vanilla and made it into vanilla/banana pudding. Great recipe!

This was pretty tastey...i liked the texture mainly, most cornstarch puddings I've made haven't really set up. I tasted it and then decided to add just a tad of cayenne to give it a little kick...pretty tastey that way as well...I think it could have had more butterscotch flavor though...I froze some for pudding pops...VERY good!

I tried for zero stars and was forced to rate it.  I looked forward to this.  It is so sweet.  I did follow the directions and added more cornstarch so it would be thicker but I think its inedible.  Sorry.

I did as others said and used dark brown sugar and it still tasted nothing like butterscotch. It had a pleasing taste but I will not make again.

I made this exactly as written. It is absolutely delicious! For us though it would make more like 8 servings because it is so rich... but it was very quick and easy to make... thank you so much for the recipe!

Definitely use DARK brown sugar for this recipe. I used lt. brown and it just doesn't have enough of a butterscotch taste although it's still good. Just the fact that it's home made makes it good and it's so comforting. I'm going to take another reviewers advice and add a bit of butterscotch schnapps.

Yum...It is worth the trip to the grocery store to get the dark brown sugar. Very rich pudding, but oh, so good on a cold evening :)

I don't think I'll make this again. the mixture didn't firm up until completely cooled (2 hrs). It was too sweet to be eaten alone. Maybe if the cornstarch was increased this could be used as a pie filling.

Used 1/2 dark brown sugar and 1/2 light cause I had it. Used 2 whole eggs cause I hate to separate and turned out perfect.

I saved this recipe a while ago and finally made it today.  I did as another reviewer suggested and used 3/4c of dark brown sugar.  The flavor and texture was perfect, creamy, and tasting of butterscotch. I would give it 5 stars for method but 4 because I changed the sugar content. 
One suggestion I have is making sure you use a good stainless steel pan, at least 3 ply.  Anytime you use milk you need to use good stainless and in the first boil stir with a stainless spoon then whisk for the remaining boils.  You need to just boil before tempering and boil before adding the butter and vanilla. 
 If you have never tempered eggs, or find you have some cooked eggs when you do, do not measure the ¼ cup; pull the pot off the stove, use a ladle and whisk the egg yolks while adding the hot mixture in a slow stream from the ladle. I make pastry cream all the time and a slow stream and whisking always gives a good temper.  
I used whole milk and had a slight thickening before adding the eggs.  If you have a runny mixture try just boiling, rather than cook for one minute, after adding the cornstarch/sugar mixture.

Used 2% milk, 5 Tbsp of cornstarch, dark brown sugar, omega 3 eggs, and 2 Tbsp of butter. Really tastes like butterscotch.

Good texture and consistency, when i make in the future i will use dark brown sugar as opposed to light and i will also add some butterscotch liqueur because the butterscotch flavor was there but not nearly as strong as i would like. It was very subtle and i wanted it to pop.

It was really hard to combine the eggs without getting a few "cooked" particles, which I had to use a sieve to remove. Next time I won't add as much hot mixture into the yolks to try to avoid this.  The flavor was pleasant but not very much of a butterscotch flavor.  Perhaps that's because I didn't have dark brown sugar and instead followed a recipe to make it, using 1 cup light brown sugar and 1 Tbsp molasses.

This pudding is rich and creamy! It is also a little on the sweet side. I substituted for the milk a combination of 3/4 unsweetened coconut milk and 1/4 coconut cream to make it healthier.

Fabulous. If you remember butterscotch pudding from your childhood, you have to try this. I used whole milk, real butter and regular brown sugar. My daughter has celiac disease so it is a great gluten free dessert for her.

My dad absolutely loves butterscotch anything so I thought I'd take a whack at some pudding. Upon making the pudding following every ingredient I came upon some conclusions. 1.Too sugary 2. Dark brown sugar is really needed to get a true butterscotch flavor 3.The way my dad goes through pudding his arteries are going to clog in mere hours of eating all that butter. So batch 2 I made it with 2/3 cup brown sugar, added a shot of spiced golden rum (I prefer rum to scotch) ,and only used 2 tablespoons of butter. The results were much better in terms of depth of flavor. Other variations I've done using light brown sugar and 1/4 cup butter toasted pecans to get a butter pecan pudding (just add in with butter and brown sugar at beginning). You could also get a really yummy peanut butter pudding by using the light brown sugar and 2 tablespoons peanut butter added around  the end. This could also easily be a caramel pudding if you desired by using regular white sugar and butter until it begins to bubble then slowly adding in a couple tablespoons of cream (because curdling sucks and caramel is so temperamental ) then adding the milk &ect. Overall really yummy though !

My kids liked this more then the version I made that didn't use eggs.  It makes more then I needed as well.  I would say I got 8 serving out of it.  The only change I made was how the dry and wet ingredients are combined to prevent lumps before adding heat.  I do suggest using dark instead of the light brown sugar for a more distinct taste. I did use light brown sugar this time.   But as is it's still a keeper.

This was awesome! Made it to the letter plus one addition of 1T. scotch when I mixed in the butter and vanilla. I gave my roommate the spoon I had cooked with to lick while the cups were chilling and he came back to the kitchen with a clean spoon confessing he might have sprained his tongue.

I fully enjoyed this pudding!  It was great warm!  Reminded me of my childhood back on the mennonite farm.  The only thing I did different was use tapioca flour as my thickner. (I prefer it over starch)

This seemed a tad grainy to me.  I wonder if the reason you make the brown sugar slurry to start with is to lessen that effect?  It's also not as firm as I normally like my puddings.  The taste however was excellent.

Mine wasn’t as dark in colour as the boxed style. However this is likely due to no food colouring at it which is a plus. Really tasty I think I doubled up on the vanilla

Really good! I would have liked a little stronger butterscotch flavor but it was very good as is.

I made this as written and I'll definitely make it again.  It's rich and creamy, easy to make and set up quickly.  We've been craving butterscotch pudding and this is the one!

Despite reviews saying it was too sweet or it didn't have enough flavor, I liked the amount of sweetness and I got the butterscotch. However, it didn't set and it was grainy. Also, the color didn't look anything like the picture. Overall, I wasn't satisfied.

Definelty not my favourite, I'd rather had bought the box stuff. It was alright, pretty blank, so I added extra vanilla and then it was too thin.

I added a hand full of butterscotch morsels but should have left them out they made the pudding a little to strong flavored but the grand kids still loved it. I'll know better to stick to the recipe next time.

Turned out great! My hubby ate two bowls. I burned a little of the sugar because I didn’t stir enough but that actually gave it more flavor.

I definitely liked the simplicity of the recipe, however, next time I will strain the tempered egg mixture before adding to the pudding for smooth texture.

Thickened nicely through all the steps. 

In the instructions is it 1/4 cup or 1/4 of the milk mixture? Is there a c missing or the word THE?

Made as the directions stated, it is good. It will make a good base for starting until I come up with the perfect Butterscotch pudding. I tried it before adding the eggs, and honestly will not be adding eggs in the next batch. Thank you for sharing!

WONDERFUL!  My only change was to use 2% milk.  It thickened nicely with no problems.  We really enjoyed the flavor and smooth creamy texture.  I served it with whipped cream and a raspberry garnish.  Thank for sharing your recipe, COOKIEWOMAN!  I will be making it again!

I ran out of vanilla extract, so I used about a cinnamon. I enjoyed the taste,  and apparently so did my family at the end of Thanksgiving dinner.
Made if tonight, and tried the cinnamon then adding the vanilla extract. A pleasant change.

I grew up making homemade pudding with my grandmother, and this seemed like a good variation.  I made the pudding, but reduced the brown sugar by almost a 1/2 cup, and used a 1/4 cup of butter.  It was great!  I added bananas at the end to make it a little healthier and to help out with any potential loss of sweetness. I will definitely make it again.

I made this for my husband's birthday. It came out so badly. I see a lot of positive reviews, so I am not sure what went wrong but the taste and consistency were really gross. I really tasted the cornstarch above all else. Any tips?

I really like the consistency of this.  i changed the order i heated things a bit, and didn't have any problems with lumps or grains.  I mixed dry ingredients, added  some of the milk, heated, then added the rest of the milk (and a bit of cream) other than that, followed the recipe. but the brown sugar overpowered.  on first bite, it was good, but after another couple i felt a tummy ache coming on.

I loved the flavor of the pudding, but didn't love the consistency.  I only had 1% milk and I suspect that might have been the culprit.  The pudding would have made a great sauce!  This goes in my recipe box and I'll try it again with milk with a higher fat content.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, using dark brown sugar.  My only confusion was that the ingredients called for 3 cups milk and it wasn't clear in the instructions whether the "enough milk to make thick paste" was from this 3 cups or in addition to the 3 cups.  I assumed it was included in the three cups.  Anyway, the pudding ended up not setting as well as I would like, after refrigerating overnight it is kind of soft-set.  What I don't like about it is it has a floury taste/texture.  Since I did not use flour I assume that is the cornstarch.  So I obviously did something wrong in the cooking...maybe I didn't get the milk boiling hard enough before adding the cornstarch/sugar mixture?  I plan to try this one more time to see if I can get it to come out better, if not I will move on to another recipe:)

Very Rich and Very Sweet.  You could probably forgo the butter and use less sugar and it would be perfect.
