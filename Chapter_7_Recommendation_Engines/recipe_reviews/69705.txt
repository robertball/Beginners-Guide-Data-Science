This was fantastic eggnog. As a safety precaution, we tempered the eggs by first heating 1/2 of the milk and slowly pouring it into the egg and sugar mixture while whisking the eggs constantly. Then proceed with the cold ingredients (and vanilla). This will raise the temperature of the eggs so it is safe for children and pregnant women to drink. That being said, I also left out the rum and served it on the side : ). This received rave reviews from all! Thanks for sharing!

Awesome! I just made a double batch of it. I did change a few things though. I used powdered sugar instead of granulated. I used 2 cups of spiced rum, 2 cups of brandy, and 1/4 cup whiskey. 
Thanks for the recipe!

Made this last Christmas and everyone raved! One change I made was straining egg nog just before serving. I also added extra freshly grated nutmeg in each glass.

This is an extraordinary eggnog recipe, but my guests found it way too sweet. I halved the sugar and I also included the egg whites.

I used this recipe because I needed to utilize 6 egg yolks from a dessert I made. It was my first eggnog, I have made coquito before (and realized I love it more), but this recipe is different from coquito. The texture was creamy and milky. I used less sugar and less rum (white rum), but I think spirit gives an extra kick and makes the eggnog tastier. In my opinion, this eggnog needs more spices, so I added cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg in the bottle. Overall, this is a delicious eggnog and easy to make too.

I made this for a small Christmas party last year and got RAVE reviews.  It was SO good.  I think I added a little more milk to it as this is very rich.   Enjoy!!!

This was a big hit at the New Years Eve party this year. There wasn't a drop left by the end of the night and several people were asking for the recipe. I used 2 cups of sugar and about 3/4 of the bottle of Captain Morgan Spiced Rum.  That was perfect for out tastes, but if you prefer it a little stronger, by all means add the whole thing as the recipe states.  This is a keeper for sure and will be a staple at all of my holiday gatherings.

Both adults and kids loved this!  Of course, I omitted the alcohol from the kid version.  It was great on Christmas day and sooo much better than the store.

My guests raved about this egg nog!  I used local, farm fresh eggs and milk.  I did not bother separating the eggs: this left an occasional slimy bit in the nog, which could be prevented by beating the egg whites until stiff.  I did halve the sugar and the spiced rum (Kracken brand) ~ perfect!

Yup this is amazing alright! I used evaporated milk instead of whole milk, heated it to temper the eggs, and then added regular milk instead of heavy cream after it had been refrigerated overnight which means you can make it as thin or as thick as you like! A winner with everyone! Also, since we dont have rum in the house I used vanilla vodka (Three Olives brand) and it was sooooo tastey! but honestly, this is great without any alcohol at all :D

I personally loved it. I used it for an Eggnog Latte. My mom asked why it didn't taste like Starbucks, I said because they use a concentrate. This is better, although she wasn't head over heels about it, I personally find it very yummy, and will make it during the Holiday season... Oh I did not use the Rum, and I used 2 2/3 cups of Whole Milk, a little less fatty!!! Yummy...

Let me start off by saying I have always HATED eggnog in the carton.  Everyone kept telling me I needed to try 'real' eggnog, so I decided to make my own.  Wow!  This was the best eggnog I've ever tried.  Following other reviewers' suggestions, I used less sugar, warmed the milk with the eggs, and added a small amount of rum after pouring a glass (this way my daughter could enjoy it too).  I might use even less sugar next time, since it is really sweet, but it is delicious.  I can't wait to serve this at Christmas!!

yum!!! loved it! I can't believe the amount of sugar in this drink, but I cant imagine it with less. I used 2% milk and it worked out fine. I used some agave instead of all sugar, I would have used more, but ran out. I didn't use vanilla, and it is fine without. I think I didn't have to use so much rum, but I'm not sure how to properly make up for that, more milk? 

Thanks, I will definitely make this again!

I have been making eggnog using this recipe the last 4 years.  This stuff is so good, it's ridiculous! I make four batches of this stuff for our Christmas Eve party and it's gone before you know it. As others have said, I halved the sugar. I highly recommend this recipe.

Eggs are raw, serving size is too big and too strong.  Also needs nutmeg. Overall was drinkable but will try a different recipe next time.

This was my first time making eggnog, so I'm glad I tried this recipe! I didn't add any alcohol (I just love eggnog flavor), and it was a little too sweet, so I will use about 25% less sugar next time. This was creamy and delicious and I can't wait to make it again!!

I scaled it down to 1 serving to test it, and it made me sick.

This is the same recipe my mom used every Christmas and it is so good! I usually use a little whiskey in mine, but will try it with the rum.

I made this with my Bialetti hot chocolate maker (heats it enough to make me comfortable, but not enough to cook the milk and eggs) and then I chilled it for about 6 - 8 hours.  I prefer everything less sweet, so I used less sugar.  Because I was making it for both drinkers and non drinkers, I left the rum on the side.  Overall, I liked it and will make again.

Followed it as written except used 2% milk because that's all I had. My first egg nog. Creamy and delicious. Chilled in freezer for 1 hour because I was anxious. Really impressed.

It was good hunny even though you poured it down the sink.
