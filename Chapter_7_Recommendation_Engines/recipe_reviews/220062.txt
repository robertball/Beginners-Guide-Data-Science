This is a GREAT brownie recipe!!! I love it!!! Way better than any boxed brownies! The only thing I adjusted was I put the batter in a 13x9 glass pan and baked it for 30 minutes and they came out perfect!!! And might I suggest, put some chocolate chips in the batter before putting it in the oven. That makes them really good!

I use salted butter in this recipe, pecans instead of walnuts and I add a half teaspoon of salt. One of THE best brownies I've ever had. Wanna really make this decadent? Frost these babies with Brownie Frosting, which is also from this site. Best cure for anything I can think of!!

These were amazing! I made a double recipe, and they went fast. Everyone who tried one said they loved it, even those who don't usually care for nut brownies. I will definitely be making these again, no modifications necessary!

I think this recipe deserves 5 stars by itself, but I made some changes that suited my own tastes. I used 1 full cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips (melted with the 3/4 cup salted butter in the microwave), 1 tsp vanilla (I like vanilla) and a few hand fulls of walnuts (didn't measure it, it must have been more than a cup). I baked it in a 9x13x2 glass casserole dish sprayed with PAM, for 30 minutes, perfect thickness. Very good not dry but not gooey and perfect sweetness. I will use this recipe for brownies from now on, mainly because I did not NEED a glass of milk to go with them. I also did not get the pic I wanted because I had 6 children yelling for brownies and I didn't have time, lol.

Great recipe!  I used bittersweet chocolate chips and was thrilled with the moist, not-to-sweet taste.  No changes to the recipe and will happily repeat

These were the best ever.  I lost Mom's recipe so had to find a new one.  This is even better.  I did add chocolate chips, about a cup; please don't tell the California Walnut Board but I used Pecans, they were wonderful!  Family loved them!

So, a good recipe overall I thought, however much more "cake" like than I prefer or expected given how dense the batter was. If you like fudgy brownies this isn't it! Maybe would be better with frosting?

Also, put this in  9 x 13 pan and they were SUPER thick. Can't imagine putting this in 9x9! LOTS of batter. Would put it in a larger pan next time.

This is a wonderfully chocolaty, cake-like brownie, just what I was looking for.  I used dark chocolate chips and the end result was exactly as I had hoped, moist and not too sweet.  Perfect.

I tried this today. And this my first time baking a Brownie. Still a beginner in baking. I baked for 40 mins, the edges and bottom got burned a bit. Also since I added semi-sweet Chocolate chips at the end, it turned out to get a little too extra sweet. I will try this again tomorrow for 30 mins baking.

My 9 year old grand daughter made this for desert last Sunday. She thought it was too chocolaty but I really liked it. She sprinkled the top with powdered sugar to make it a little fancier!

I've had brownies on my mind for a few days and was looking for a new recipe. This is an outstanding brownie recipe.  I also baked mine in a 9"x13" glass baking dish for 30 minutes. I used salted butter. The batter was really thick and I was afraid they were going to be dry. But, they were PERFECT.  Best brownies ever!

this is a really great recipy!
to make it into a rocky road put extra chocolate chips along with your walnuts in the batter.
5 minutes before it is done baking (i find 25 min in is good) put marshmallows on top (cut giant ones in half). let them brown for 5 minutes in the oven still at 350. after taking them out. cover your pan with something like a cookie sheet to make sure the marshmallows do not shrivvel and look gross.
melnt your choice of chocolate and drizzle over top. (milk chocolate is good.

hint: mix up the types of chocolate you add into your brownie milk chocolate, dark, white. lindor bars are also great to crumble in. this will make your brownie and any other recipy extremely decidant

I've made this recipe twice now. The flavor is really good, but I generally like a denser, moister brownie. So next time I'm going to use 3 eggs instead of 4, and perhaps a full cup of chocolate chips (maybe a little more butter, too?). This time I added about 1/2tsp of salt and that made a big difference, so I'll continue to do that in the future. But overall, a great jumping off point.

Great recipe! I did it with black walnuts, which are native to the U.S.  They cost a little more, but really "kick it up a notch."

It’s delicious and taste so similar to the boxed stuff. Everyone else enjoyed it as well. But it was a bit dry, I’m not sure if I cooked it to long and that’s why.

This is a very dense, chewy brownie with an almost too rich flavor for my tastes.  The baked pan felt like it weighed close to 5 pounds!  Less chocolate and more walnuts would have been more to my personal preference.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I have made it twice in the past two weeks and they definitely rank among the best brownies we have ever had. Both times I added one tablespoon of baking powder. For the second batch I reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 cups and added walnuts. I also melted the sugar with the butter and half the chocolate chips on the stove and then poured that mixture into the mixing bowl where I blended in the eggs and finally the dry ingredients. I also added a tablespoon of mint extract to make them chocolate mint brownies. Great basic recipe.

I baked these brownies in a 9X9 glass dish, but I will use a 9X13 pan if I bake them again, since they rose so high. Mine also cracked a lot on the top. What is the reason for that? I wonder if I should have reduced the cooking temp for glass?

Delicious! I love this recipe. When I mixed the butter/ choc chips mixture with the dry ingredients, it was a little runny but I cooked it anyway and it turned out amazing! 10/10

Cut down on the sugar 60gm brown, 100 white. Use a wider baking tray, 12”x12” and baking time of 30mins. Everyone has 2 servings!

Delicious! I made it in a 13x9 pan as others suggested. I put peanuts in a quarter of it. *my kids don't like nuts* I also mixed a cup of chocolate chips in. These are great. I used the brownie frosting like others suggested and it was the BOMB! I did need my cup of milk because it is rich with the frosting. Needless to say, the whole pan is gone in two days. And there went my 5 pounds I had lost....LOL!

I thought they were pretty good... The wife, not so good... She said too much of a cocoa powder taste... I may try these again using some pudding mix or a little chocolate syrup next time...

Simple, chocolate-y, wonderful brownies.

Not overtly sweet. Texture is more cake-like than fudgy, so if you like fudge brownies this is not the recipe for you.

For the batter, I needed to add a little more butter because the consistency seemed too thick. Also, though they turned out pretty tasty, they seemed a little dry. Will probably try to make these again though.

Great recipe!!  I will definitely make this again and again.   I used the same recipe and added chocolate covered caramel morsels.  Very good!!   Perfectly moist.  I agree with some of the readers to make the brownies even more decadent is to add frosting.  This will send the brownies over the top!

Mine were a little dry and too  fluffy. I think one less egg would help. I was looking for gooey and I didn't get it.

I made these, however I made a few adjustments. I doubled the recipe and made a double batch and used a 9 X 13 pan. I used 24 oz Dark Chocolate Dove instead of 3/4 cup chocolate chips. I kept the butter. I added 3/4 cup whole chocolate chips with the walnuts just prior to pouring into the pan. I did not grease my pan I used parchment paper on the bottom. This allowed the brownies to rise much better. I shared these with my neighbors and they were a big hit with everyone. Gary K

Too bitter and even my kids wouldn't eat it.  Disappointing.
