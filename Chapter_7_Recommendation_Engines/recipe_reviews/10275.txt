I had read on here that people were having trouble with the cookie being too thin,  so I added a 1/2 cup more flour, and also 1/2 more peanut butter.   the cookie came out great!  also added 1 teaspoon vanilla.

This is an excellent recipe. My family likes peanut butter cookies to be a little softer/chewier so I increased the flour by 1/4 cup and also added 1/4 cup more peanut butter. Also, I baked them on 350 for about 9 minutes or so- but watch carefully not too over bake them! They were just soooo good!

Thank you Shirley!  This is a fabulous recipe.  After reading some very helpful comments, I made a few minor changes.  Increased peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups, added an additional 1/4 cup flour, baked at 350 degrees for 9-10 minutes.  After forming the dough into balls, I dipped them in sugar and with sugar side up, gently created a criss-cross pattern on top.  The cookies are well balanced--crispy edges, chewy centers.  Delicate peanut butter flavor.  My whole family loved them!!

These cookies were for sure the best Peanut Butter cookies I ever made. I too added just a little more flour and a little more Peanut Butter. I made 2 dozen cookies with them and they were a hit. I made them super soft and gooey. Pull them out of the oven even when they are soft, and let them cool, they will be just the right crispiness on top but soft on the inside. I think I baked my cookies for about 6 or 7 minutes. 

Good luck and enjoy!

Very good cookies with just a little tweaking. I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and, because I like my peanut butter cookies very peanut buttery, an additional cup of peanut butter. Just for something a little different I threw in a package of chocolate/peanut butter swirl chips. Because the dough is made with butter, chill the dough till somewhat firm and you won't end up with thin cookies...no need to add more flour!

I love these cookies!  I was out of crunchy PB, so I used creamy, also didn't have unsalted butter, so used the salted and left out the 1/2 tsp. salt.  Also, mine took exactly 10 minutes to bake.  My kids loved them!!

Ok, to start, the flavor of these cookies is phenomenal. Absolutely delicious.  The problem is, you definitely should make these cookies a couple of times before you plan on taking them to any parties. My first try resulted in underdone peanut butter pancakes, and overdone peanut butter frisbees. The cookies flattened out literally to be about an eighth of an inch thick. Not cool. They also spread so wide, that I had beautiful octagonally shaped cookies after I had cut them all apart. After shoving the dough back into the fridge for few days due to frustration, I tried again, and discovered a few changes that make for better cookies. They still don't look like the ones in the picture, but oh well. For one, cool the dough longer than an hour. Three days is perhaps a bit long, but definitely give it a good, solid amount of time in the fridge. Next, don't squish the balls done with a fork. The melting butter and peanut butter doesn't need any help going flat. There aren't any cute fork imprints, but after your cookie has turned into a manhole cover, you don't see the fork marks anyways. Third, after baking, the cookies are going to be really squishy. You're going to think they're not done. Take them out anyways, and carefully move them from the hot baking sheet to a cool, flat surface (like plates, not racks!!). The cookies will cool and be nice and soft, but will harden a bit too, so you can actually eat them. I also added white chocolate chunks, which was yummy.

As is the recipe is 4 stars.  I would have given it 5 stars if I hadn't had to make some changes.  I followed the suggestions of others and added 1/4 c. extra flour and 1/4 c. extra peanut butter, and put 1 t. vanilla in.  I rolled them in sugar before pressing with a fork. I baked them at 350 for 9 minutes.  Thanks for a good base recipe.

This is a great recipe! My recommendationns are as follow: Cook for 8 minutes on 350. Add 1/4C more peanut butter. Don't flatten the cookies down too much unless you want a crunchy cookie. Substatute a small amount of oil for butter for a more moist cookie. And of course....add a couple handfulls of chocolate chips! This recipes was really delightful!

I have been using this recipe since I was a litle girl and first began baking! My best friend's Mom made them for us and I thought they were the best cookie around. My "twist" to the recipe is rolling each ball in granulated sugar before flattening with a fork and baking. It really adds to the final results and everyone loves them.

I creamed the butter, peanut butter, and sugar with my hands.
I also tried to beat the eggs with my hands.
The hardest part though was sifting and stirring the flour into the mix with my hands.

My mix turned out really lumpy and dry and I couldn't get it to make balls.  It just crumbled out of my hands when I rolled them together like sand.

Don't worry if you also do this! I found a way to fix it!

Just add a qaurter stick of melted butter and a little dribble of milk.

The cookies turned out crappy still.  But if you like crappy cookies then this is a life saver!

I've been making this recipe for over 4 years now, and people consistently ask me to bring these to gatherings.  I do make a few changes as recommended by others, and have it down to a science now.  Here are my changes:
Use 1/2 cup extra flour
use 1/4 cup extra peanut butter - CREAMY to balance the crunchy portion
add one overflowing tsp vanilla
bake 9 minutes instead of 10

Perfect.

This is a great old fashioned recipe. They are crispy yet chewy and great with crunchy peanutbutter. I added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the recipe. Just like grandma used to make. I made them in about 1" balls (using a melon baller) and flattened with a fork in a criss cross pattern. Made about 6 dozen medium sized cookies.

The best peanut butter cookies I have ever made. Putting the dough into the fridge is a must! I even made sure to put it back in to the fridge between batches, otherwise it gets too gooey to roll into balls for baking. Even the raw dough was delicious! I almost made myself sick eating the leftover dough and the hot cookies from the oven. Will make these time and time again!

Can we say Wholesome goodness. On 1-15-03 I had a massive craving for peanut butter cookies. So I tried this recipe...if I could rate this with 10 stars I would. I'm still making them. Move over Betty here comes Shirley! On the gay scale of 0-10 fingersnaps...it gets 20! You go GURL! Just hope the boyfriend doesn't find the batch I stashed. Oh and these were never crumbly, or burnt on the bottom,just in for 10 minuntes no longer, no later! FABULOUS!!! BUT GET SOME STRONG MAN TO MIX IN THE DRY THINGS INTO THE PEANUTBUTTER/BUTTER...CAUSE MY DELICATE ARM ALMOST FELL OFF...;)

So great! I followed other commenter's suggestion of adding 1/4 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter. Also if you have trouble with flat cookies, make sure baking soda is fresh! It goes flat after 30 days or so.  I also cooked at 350 for 9 minutes and that worked perfectly.

SOFT CHEWY peanut butter cookies. Amazing. I'm always reluctant to bake PB cookies because so often they're dry and hard. This recipe is brilliant. I made very few changes, just up'd the peanut butter to 1.5c per others recommendations. I'm a sucker for extra decadent, so I threw in a bag of PB chips and a cup chopped roasted peanuts. Not necessary but gave it an extra dose of peanutty goodness. Really though, you can't go wrong with this one!

This recipe has all the ingredients, but lacks the soul of a fabulous cookie if prepped as written. Here's my changes:
1st beat egg light and fluffy..rinse beaters and dry.
Then cream butter; Start w warm butter and brown sugar, you should use high power then cream white sugar. Should take several minutes to cream.....
. Scrape sides of bowl often to eliminate granules. Add peanut butter and blend well .finally add egg and beat to mix
SIFT dry ingredients together, add a little at a time. Mix slowest speed until just blended 
I baked at 375 for 6 minutes. Cookies did not look done, but left on cookie sheet for 5 minutes then transferred onto hard surface to cool. This seals in the moisture resulting In a crispy crunch and chewy delicious smooth pb taste!

These cookies have a crunchy but soft texture.  I am nine years old (my mom supervised me!) and I do not like a lot of things but these are the best!!!!  We did use only 3/4 cup of each sugar, which mom liked.  We added 1/2 cup more of flour and peanut butter as others suggested.  Mom says probably do not need the extra 1/2 cup of flour, that makes them a bit too crumbly.

I have made peanut butter cookies MANY times, but the recipe that I always use is in storage. So, I decided to try this one, and it was really good! I only made half a batch, because we were low on peanut butter. And, I used all natural creamy peanut butter. I also added a half tsp. of vanilla. I didn't refrigerate the dough at all, and didn't really feel like I needed to. It was easy enough to work with. I made them a little on the small side, and rolled the balls in sugar before my 4yo made the criss-cross pattern with the fork. Then I baked them for 6 minutes and let them cool a minute on the pan before removing them. The cookies didn't spread too much like a lot of peanut butter cookies do, and I liked that. They are nice and crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside- everything a peanutbutter cookie should be! Other reviewers said that these needed more flour and more peanut butter. I disagree. I think the amounts were spot on. Perhaps their cookies thinned out too much because they flattened them too much while making the criss-cross pattern? This is a VERY GOOD peanut butter cookie recipe and I know I will be making them again and again.

Following the reviews, I added about a quarter cup to a half cup of extra peanut butter and of flour plus a teaspoon of vanilla and used smooth peanut butter since I don't keep crunchy on hand.  The cookies got rave reviews.

I took them to work as well as to a girls' night and people were very happy with them.  I separated them into half batches - one of which I had in the fridge for barely an hour and the other which was in for 24 hours - both turned out well!  

Additionally, I baked the first batch a tad under the suggested time (as my oven burns hot) and they were soft for days.  The second batch I baked to recommendations and they were much firmer and were crumbly biscuit cookies (though not hard) the next day so depending on what kind you want, watch the baking time!

The portions on this recipe are all wrong.  I made this exactly as stated and, first of all, it made way more than 24 cookies.  Second, the flavor of these was just not there and the texture was not good.  Waste of good ingredients.

Fabulous cookie recipe! I used creamy peanut butter and salted butter because that's what I had on hand. I did add a scant 1/4th teaspoon of salt. I used brown sugar only, 2 cups. I refigerated the dough as directed and had no problem with over spreading. I made these cookies large. My husband who is very picky loved them. Surprise! Surprise!

Another great cookie! I use this recipe in my bakery department at work, and my customers love this cookie. I make jumbo 4oz cookies, because my customers like big cookies. The cookie is soft and chewy and stay chewy and soft for days; however, my cookies never last more than a couple of days on the retail shelves. For variety, I dip the cookie half way into melted semi-sweet chocolate...wow, it has such a awesome look, it is hard to resist.

These cookies are amazing.  Don't forget to put a slice of bread in with your cookie tin or jar to keep the cookies moist.  YUM!

I used salted butter and smooth peanut butter. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and omitted the salt. I also added a package of peanut butter chips. I made 2 tbsp sized balls, dipped the tops in sugar and pressed with a fork. I baked them for 9 minutes and let them cool 2 minutes before putting them on a cooling rack. I got exactly 3 dozen cookies. They taste great. (I skipped the chiling). Thanks.

Really the perfect peanut butter cookie! I did customize it like others suggested and added an extra 1/2 cup of PB and an extra 1/2 cup of flour. If you make small cookies they will NOT break apart after cooking so I highly suggest smaller sized ones. I tried medium/larger ones and they were crumbly. I bake a LOT and these were truly among the best cookies I have ever made. They were great out of oven and still perfect much later in the day. I sent them in a care package to my son in college. I think anyone who loves peanut butter cookies will LOVE these.

For a cookie, these were rather bland and had little to recommend them. They were dry, not sweet enough, and OILY. I'm not sure how a cookie can be dry and oily at the same time, but these managed.

The recipe was amazing. I wish.other people would stop addong their suggestions. Of you wsnt to post. your recipe, then do so. Stop telling peop k e who have posted a goid recipe how you made it "better". Its rude, narcissistic and shows you to be full of your own self importance, which is disgusting and uncalled for. This recipe wad s mazing AS IS, it needs no other peoples rewrites.

I added more salt, 1/2 t each of baking powder and baking soda.  I also added 1 C finely ground dry-roasted peanuts for extra peanuttiest.  Could possibly be the best PB cookies I've ever made.

This was a great recipe!  I read through the reviews and decided to add more flour (1/2 cup) and peanut butter (1/2 cup) as suggested, and I also added about 1tsp of vanilla.  The temperature was way too high at 375 in my oven, and after scorching the bottoms of the first batch, I reduced the heat to 325 and cooked for 9 minutes.  After that, they came out perfect!  I even added a milk chocolate center on some of them, for something extra!  Great recipe, I plan on making these more often!

Didn't like these, I did everything the way the recipe said except I didn't have baking soda so I used more baking powder based on an exchange ratio I found on the internet. They were not very peanut-buttery. I'm definitely kicking this out of my recipe box.

Delicious, love this recipe, have been making a similar one for the last little while, even good with chocolate chips as a final step.  If I make plain peanut butter cookies, I always sprinkle a little white sugar on them before baking for the sweet tooth in me!

These came out perfect!  I added some raisins, then baked them at 350* and kept a close eye on them.  They were a perfect chewy goodness with crispy edges at about 7 min.

i used whole wheat flour instead of white, and that didn't work for me. The cookies didn't flatten out at all - they just burnt on the outside. Next time, I'll try half wheat flour, half white flour.

Thanks!  This is a great recipe!  I did as the others suggested with the extra quarter cup of flour and pnutbutter.  I baked em at 365 for 8 mins and they were perfect.  I also did a dozen not rolled in sugar, and the next rolled in sugar before baking, and all of the teen boys here that did the taste test said DEFINITELY rolled in sugar wins! They are soft, not dry at all! Thanks, this is my new recipe, tossing out the old one!

Reading reviews before I made these, I decided to also increase the flour and peanut butter by 1/2 cup each and also added 1 teaspoon vanilla.  With these changes I am giving this a 5 star rating.  Many were saying that they spread too much using the original recipe, so I didn't want to take a chance.  These are a very good tasting peanut butter cookie.

OMG these were AMAZING!!!! I finally found an amazing peanut Butter cookie recipe! i followed the recipe as followed but added 1/4 cup more of flour and Peanut Butter, i set my oven on 350 and baked them for 9 min, and they turned out soooo nice,and round (after rolling them into balls) and were so chewy, and had a good peanut butter flavor to them. they were a bit greasy on the first batch but on the second batch i placed paper towels on a plate to cool them on, and at the same time it sucked up the greasyness!!! WONDERFUL COOKIES!

I followed this recipe to the letter with the exception of adding an extra 1/4 cup peanut butter due to the suggestions in other reviews and I used salted butter and did not add any other salt. My dough was a little sticky due to the added peanut butter, but they were still easy to form. They were very easy to make. They came out perfect, crispy, and they melt in your mouth.

These cookies are the best!  I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy and increased the amount to 1 1/4 cups.  Baked them for 9 mins. and they're perfect.  Just the right amount of flavor and very moist and chewy. My hubby and I can't stop eating them.  I'll use this recipe for peanut blossoms at Christmas, also!

My husband said they were  really good but they weren't as peanut buttery as I would have liked and they were a little to crispy for me at first.  So on the next batch, I left them in the fridge overnight I took them out before they browned and they were softer and tasted better - the way I like them.

These are great!! I did go with the general consensus of adding on to the flour and peanut butter amounts, but accidentally over-baked the cookies. They didn't burn, but they didn't come out both crispy and chewy - just chewy. Watch very carefully how long you bake them!!

This the best recipe to make pretend (peanut free ) peanut butter cookies.  We have a peanut allergy in our household.  I thought we'd never have anything like a peanut butter cookie again.  Unlike other peanut butter cookie recipes this one turns out great when using a peanut butter alternative.  I use sunflower seed butter in place of the peanut butter.  After rolling it into a ball, I dip the fork in sugar before pressing down.  I bake the cookie as directed.  This is a great recipe to use when making allergy friendly peanut butter cookies.  We can tell a difference, but it the closest to the real thing we've gotten.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Added 1/2 C of extra flour & 1/2 C of extra peanut butter like recommended. Dipped in sugar, and slightly flattened with a fork. Turned out AMAZING!!!!

Great mailing cookies. I send these to my husband in Iraq on a regular basis. He loves getting them. I follow the recipe almost exactly. If you live in the south and use White Lilly Flour (the best) remember to add a little extra- I usually add another 1/4 to 1/2 cup- it's more finely milled and less dense, sort of like cake flour. Thanks for a great recipe.

My friends loved these! I added chocolate chips, vanilla, and more flour and peanut butter. I wish I had crunchy peanut butter with me, though! 10 minutes is perfect.

I used salted butter, creamy peanut butter, and cooked them for only 8 minutes so that they were *super* soft.  My boyfriend and I really enjoyed these.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and my family loved it... One might try using an electric mixer and beating the dough extra once the egg is added in to thicken it a bit.

The best recipe I found for peanut butter cookies. Took the advise of others and increased the flour by 1/2 cup and increased the peanut butter by 1/4 cup. Dough is much easier to work with after it has been placed in refrigerator. THANKS FOR SHARING!!!

We like our PB cookies soft and chewy so I added a 1 cup more flour, 1 1/2 cup more peanut butter,  also added 1 teaspoon vanilla. Cooked for 8-9 min on 350 degrees.

I made the recipe as written and they are flat and lose the criss cross pattern.  They do not look like a traditional peanut butter cookie.

These are the best peanut butter cookies EVER. And I've made quite a few different recipes of them, as they're my husband's favorite cookie. Do not change a thing! I only added a teaspoon of vanilla, and sprinkled with sugar before smooshing slightly with a fork. AMAZING! Thanks for sharing!!

I made this for my family the first time and they were so good I made another batch for my kids school party (teachers prefer things without frosting in a class of 2 yr olds)  Great Recipe and better than the bakery!  I also really appreciate cookie recipes without shortening...I try not to cook with shortening if I can help it.

After reading the reviews I added more flour and some vanilla. I still had to chill the dough for 1/2 hour before rolling into balls. As usual I did the fork dipped in sugar thing to make criss crosses. I also did 1/2 crunchy pb and 1/2 creamy (we don't like too much "crunch"). The cookies were not as chewy or peanut buttery as I've had in the past, but the centers were soft with some crunch around the outside. My  6 year old enjoyed these!

These are GREAT, but like most reviewers, I took creative liberty with the recipe. I increased the flour to 2 3/4 cups, added a teaspoon of vanilla and used an entire 18 oz. jar of Jif crunchy peanut butter. I also threw in a bag (10 oz.) of Reese's peanut butter morsels at the end and rolled them in sugar before criss-crossing the oversized handmade dough balls -- lightly -- with a fork (we like our cookies big and chewy). Baked for 15 minutes at 350 degrees and cooled on stoneware for 3 minutes before transferring them to the cooling rack. Everyone is raving about how moist and chewy they are! This (modified) recipe is a keeper!

Good recipe! I made exactly as written. Next time I will add some more peanut butter as the peanut butter taste wasn't strong enough for my liking, but after chilling I had no problem with the flat cookie problem that other reviews said, did not need additional flour. Also sprinkled with sugar. BF loved them. Thanks for the post!

Man O Man these cookies are delish! This is the first time I have ever made peanut butter cookies from scratch and I'm glad I chose this recipe! I did add a 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter. The cookies are so soft and chewy! Just the way I like 'em. Highly recommend this recipe. I'll be making them again!

Great cookies. They could use more peanut butter flavor, but I liked them. I added about 3 tbsp of ground flaxseed to the flour and I mixed in a cup of oats at the end. I also took the advice of a reviewer and rolled the balls in sugar. I found that the cookies would be fine without the sugar rolling. I also added 1/4 cup more flour and peanut butter per suggestions. I used 1/2 cup butter flavored vegetable shortening and 1/2 cup margarine. 

I will make these again. Next time I'll add some chocolate chips to a batch. I got more than 24 cookies. I'd say I got close to 3 dozen.
They were delicious. They made my guyfriend swoon.

These are the best cookies I've ever made!!  I did not melt the butter, just let it sit out until softened.  I probably used more peanut butter than called for (I just dragged my wooden spoon out of the pb jar - natural, of course).  I made 3" and 1" cookies, and they were both fantastic!  I also added a bag of Reese's pb chips.  These were very pretty, chewy and so tastey.  I also rolled a couple of my batches in sugar.

I have been searching for a pb cookie recipe for years. My mom used to have a great one but can't remember it or find it. I need to look no further. These are not too peanut buttery, light and moist. I use crunchy pb and my whole family loves them. Thank you Shirly Sadler!

A few years ago I was looking for a peanut butter cookie recipe and came across this one, and they were absolutely amazing that I made them a couple of times more. Over the few years since then, every time I want peanut butter cookies(which is quite often), I go for this recipe. Love them.

Excellent solid recipe. I didn't deliberately change anything...I used salted butter, cause it's what I had, and thus just added a dash of extra salt. I also didn't refrigerate the dough for the first batch because I was impatient.

Oh and I only had creamy peanut butter.

The results were a thinner cookie, but I wouldn't say they were too thin. It made the edges nice and crunchy but the middles were still soft.  

Next time I might sub half the butter with shortening to thicken them and enhance the chewyness, and I think they'd be lovely with salted peanuts on top rather than crunchy peanut butter.......but either way these are great as is and a great base recipe to fiddle with and fancy up a bit.

These were awesome! I added about 3 TBS of peanut butter powder (the product is called "PB2 Powdered peanut butter" by Bell Plantation, Inc.), and took them out just as the edges started to brown very, very slightly. Let them sit on the cookie sheet for a minute or two before removing to a cooling rack. They came out chewy and delicious!

These are great! Crunchy on the outside, chewy in the middle. I only gave it 4 stars because I did have to make some adjustments. Used additional 1/4 cup flour & peanut butter. Baked for 10 min. At 350. Added 1 Tbs vanilla extract. Due to our own preference, I also used smooth P.B. rather than crunchy. Thanks for the recipe!

Great cookie, maybe a tad dry. Next time I would under cook a little more than I did this time around. I used and extra 1/4 cup peanut butter and flour. I really don't think I will add the extra flour next time either, maybe a Tbsp. or two. I normally do not use any sugar other than sucanat, however this time I stuck to the recipe. Next time I will try subbing the sucanat. Oh, and I did not chill in the fridge before I baked them

I like the 'soft peanut butter cookies' recipies from this site the best to be honest.  These turned out flat n crispy.  I want a soft, moist, LITTLE crispness on the outside kinda cookie.  These didn't do it for me.

Potential to be good but 2 1/2 cups of flour is way too much! The dough was so dry that it just kept crumbling, I couldnt even smash them down with a fork. I seriously think this must be some typo.

These turned out AMAZING!  I added 1/4 more flour and peanut butter like others suggested, and omitted the salt because I used salted butter instead.  I used crunchy peanut butter and added dark chocolate chips, cooked it at 375 for 10 minutes...PERFECTION!  I tried them the next day and they were still soft & chewy, not hard at all.

I made these tonight and the texture of the cookie is amazing!  I didn't think they tasted much like peanut butter though.  They were a little buttery for my taste.  I made the recommended changes of adding more flour and peanut butter.  I think next time I would put less butter.

Like a lot of reviewers, I made this recipe with the modification of 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter. I also added vanilla and rolled them in sugar before before putting them on the baking sheet. After baking them for about 8 minutes, they were gooey and crumbly and absolutely delicious little nuggets of wonderfulness.

Edit: I made these again on a whim when I was really tired one night, and didn't realize that there was no brown sugar in the house. I just used white sugar in place of it, and they still turned out amazingly. I made a thumb print in each cookie before baking, and when they were done and cooled, I filled it with a chocolate ganache. It was so freaking divine. They were gone almost instantaneously.

Mmm, yummy and so like my grandmother's old-fashioned recipe.  Chewy centers with a slightly crumbly edge.  Make sure to take them out just as they begin to brown, and then leave them on the cookie sheets for a few minutes to firm up a bit.  They will almost look like they are not done, but when they cool they are the perfect texture.

Based on all these positive reviews, I thought I must have done something wrong. I double checked the recipe I was using, and I am certain I followed every step. From a house full of peanut butter fans, we were very disappointed. Something is very "off" with this cookie. Sorry.

I didn't make any changes other than add a little more peanut butter.  About a heaping cup full.   I baked at 350` for 10 minutes as well and they came out perfect.

New favorite PB cookie recipe.  Added 1/4 cup flour and upped PB to 1.5 cups.  Cooked for 10 min in my oven.  Turned out chewy and soft and stayed chewy/soft for the next 4 days.  Best PB cookie recipe I've ever tried and the only recipe I will use from now on.

Made 1/2 the recipe and still go 24+ cookies (after "sampling a lot of dough!). Increased PB (used Trader Joe's organic crunchy) as suggested, used peanut flour (also from TJ's) instead of wheat flour. Added some vanilla bean paste, it's like thick vanilla extract but with a bit more flavor. The result was a very very dry crumb like dough. I added 1/4cup of water. I made flat rounds not balls and made the traditional fork marks. The cookies are great look perfect and have wonderful flavor. 
I wanted a cookie without wheat and higher in protein. These work great!

The recipe could be better. I added an extra cup of peanut butter and that made the cookies hold together better and created a cookie that had more moisture. If you use less flour than was recommended you will likely be able to avoid this process. All in all my cookies turned out pretty good with the additional peanut butter but they could have been moister with a few additional tweeks. If you are a novice baker go with a different recipe.

Great cookie!  I went with the other reviewers comments and added an extra 1/4 c of flour and peanut butter.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  They turned out fabulous!  Crunchy on the outside, yet chewy and soft in the middle.  A definite keeper!   I am planning on using them in some of my Christmas food gifts...makes a great addition to a tin of cookies for your friends and family.  Thanks for the recipe!

These came out really good. I thought they had a good flavor and was chewy in the middle and crunchy around the outside, which is my definition of a perfect cookie. I would have given it 5 stars,  but had to alter the recipe, I added 1/4 cup more of crunchy PB, additional 1/4 cup more of flour, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  Made these for my Dad who drove over 1600 miles to spend some time with me and PB cookies are his favorite. He loved them!!

I'm not sure where the good ratings come from.  Most reviews I read said to add flour and peanut butter.  I started out with the recipe as written.  On the first sheet out of the oven, it was apparent the cookies needed more flour - a lot more flour.  I added flour with each sheet, as it needed a lot more.  It also doesn't have much peanut butter flavor and needs more peanut butter.  Rather than adjusting this recipe, I will start with a different recipe next time.

Amazing cookies!!! Crispy edges and chewy centers...they literally melt in your mouth! I've made these cookies a couple of times and I have to say that my favorite was making them exactly as the recipe calls! The key is to make sure to REFRIGERATE  for enough time to allow the butter to cool down--without this crucial step any cookie recipe with butter will not turn out. The first time I made this recipe, I read the reviews and I took other people's advice and added 1/4 more of both peanut butter and flour but I was not so impressed with those results as it makes the cookie more bready. Will definitely be making these over and over! I make a double batch and freeze the remainder of the dough in ziploc bags and when I have company I defrost and bake...they come out as if they were freshly made. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Made these to satisfy a peanut butter cookie craving. Definitely satisfied my craving, however, as far as peanut butter cookies go...a bit dry and bland! Needed more flavor, in my opinion. Maybe adding vanilla or cinnamon?

When I made this recipe the first time, in December, it was without any changes.  The cookies were just ok.  I made them a couple of days ago with the extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter, extra 1/2 cup of flour and 1 tsp of vanilla.  Plus only cooked for 8 minutes so they were still soft in the middle, but lightly brown on the bottom.  Out of this world.  Everyone that has tried them said they were perfect!  :)

I took the advice from Natali66 and increased the peanut butter and flour by 1/2 cup.  I also used 1/2 creamy peanut butter and half crunchy because I like a creamy texture.  This is the best recipe I have ever used for Peanut Butter Cookies.  This is a keeper.

Don't add too much flour. Come out crumbly. Add a bit more peanut butter. Very P.Buttery.

I really loved making these cookies.  I added a little extra flour and peanut butter too, and baked them for 8 mins and they came out golden and delicious.  I love my pb cookies chewy and these were perfect!

This was the best PB cookie recipe I've ever come accross! I did fallow the advice of other reviews and added 1/2 cup more of both PB and Flour. I also added a dash of vanilla just because it goes against my religion to make cookies without vanilla LOL. But that's really the only changes I made. Oh! and I made one batch just putting them on the sheet. But then on the next, I rolled them into little balls and coated them with suger. Was glad I did..the result was AWESOME cookies! And they were picture perfect! I'll most likely never make them any other way again! Thanks for an awesome recipe! :)

Delicious!  No need to change anything - the recipe is perfect as is. The dough was not dry, or crumbly at all. (Probably because I did not add extra flour like many are doing for some reason.) Keep in mind that if you start changing everything - as many seem to have done - it's a new recipe folks! As mentioned before, I followed the recipe to a T, they took exactly ten minutes to cook and came out crispy on the outside, and chewy on the inside. My entire family + all the neighborhood kids thoroughly enjoyed these.

WOW!!!!  I lowered the oven temp to 350, used bread flour instead of all purpose, added 1.5 t of vanilla... But really, those were the only changes.  I baked them for about 15 minutes (lower oven temp), and made HUGE HUGE cookies.  Literally, I made 24 cookies-- about 3 inches across.  They are amazing!!

Turns out just as recipe followes. Excellent cookies. However you must soften the butter which was not included in the recipe. The cookies are great though.

These were right on the money. When I added the Peanut Butter I added a little extra to use up my jar, maybe 1/2 a cup more. These were moist and fluffly. My husband loves them. This recipe is a 5 star recipe.

Great peanut butter cookie recipe!   I also added 1/4 cup more peanut butter, 1/4 cup more flour, and 1 tsp vanilla extract. I also used 1/2 cup salted butter and 1/2 cup Crisco, thus omitting the 1/2 tsp salt.   The end result is a very flavorful cookie with a light and crisp outer texture while remaining moist and chewy inside. I baked at 375* for 10 mins.

This was the best tasting cookie dough I've ever had! I couldn't find the peanut butter cookie recipe that my mom and I baked while growing up so I decided to try this one.  I used creamy pb because that was all I had.  The cookies turned out great! I had to cook for 11 minutes rather then 10.  I rolled mine in sugar and then did the fork thing.  This will definetely be my go to recipe for pb cookies.

I took the advice of others and added 1/2 c more flour and 1/2 c more peanut butter and I rolled the cookies in sugar before baking them.  Absolutely wonderful, we couldn't stop eating them.  I will be making this again and again and again.

I used the advice of other reviews and increased the PB and flour by a half a cup. I also added 1 cup of chocolate chips and 2 tsp of vanilla flavoring. I cooked for 9-10 min. Do not over bake!! These cookies do not look done when they truly are. Very yummy

This is a really easy recipe. I added some vanilla and extra peanut butter. I also cooked for only 8 mins because my over is very hot.  They are quite moist, but I can tell will dry out quickly..if not eaten the same day! I would suggest a small piece of bread in the cookie jar. Overall, I would recommend this recipe to others.

These are a HUGE hit, people!  I decided to whip up some of these last night, and my office is currently raving over them.  Because I didn't want to chill the dough before baking I opted to use margarine instead of the butter, but aside from a smidge of vanilla axtract I made no changes to the recipe.  I wound up with 32 large, perfectly soft and moist cookies.  This recipe is very easy to put together, and I highly recommend it!

Followed others advice: added 1 tsp vanilla and increased amount of peanut butter (I used an entire 15 oz jar of Skippy Natural Super Chunk). Used a small scoop to keep cookies a uniform size. Dipped fork in a small bowl of flour prior to pressing fork into cookies. Bake time 9 - 10 mins.

The first ever from scratch cookie recipe I've done and this one is a hit! I have to have instructions to put water in a saucepan, but it went off without a hitch. I recommend it to any new cook. I followed hints from some reviewers (a touch more peanut butter and flour and a teaspoon of vanilla,) At 71, I'm really excited, especially with the AllRecipes site as a lifesaver for us beginners.

These were perfect. I did make changes according to what I read in the other reviews. I add 1/2 C more Flour and Peanut Butter. 1 tsp vanilla. I rolled them in the sugar. I also used creamy PB and salted butter. With those changes they were absolutely perfect.

These turned out great!  My friend and I made them for a gift, with a few slight changes based on some of the reviews.
First, We followed the 1/2 cup more of peanut butter and flour. 
Additionally, we used all natural peanut butter instead of regular peanut butter- I thought the taste difference was incredible compared to my previous attempts at peanut butter cookies.

Finally, we added just a small amount (~1/2-1 teaspoon) of vanilla. 

It took a little more than 9 minutes to bake perfectly, but I'll definitely be trying these again. =)

These are such great cookies and so easy to make. All my life my mother and I made them but they would turn so hard and crunchy that no one would want them after they cooled. These on the other hand did not and everyone is in cookie heaven! I especially loved how easily they came off the cookie sheet and how easy they were to roll. No sticky messes! I followed one readers twist of rolling them in sugar (I did it to some ginger cookies before so I trusted it.) Excellent recipe and I will use this one for now on. =)

Holy cow, these are the best thing since sliced bread!  I am a true fan of the peanut butter cookie and have tried many recipes but this one tops them all.  I made them just as instructed but used creamy instead of crunchy peanut butter (call me a purist) and they turned out wonderfully.  I think I ate half of the batch myself.  Additionally, I made some more another time and froze half of the dough.  One month later I thawed it and baked them and they were just as good as the first time.

I not a peanut butter cookie fan but my hubby loves them. I pinched a peice off just now and I must say, these are FAB! I added a little extra Peanut butter and melted the stick of butter (it wasnt softening fast enough lol). I also rolled them in some crushed bakers semi sweet chocolate for the other half of the batch, and WOW! Definitely a keeper!

Oh my gosh - these are great! I followed a few suggestions: 1 1/4 C PB, 1 overflowing tsp of vanilla & rolled top in sugar before pressing with fork. I also used margarine. I made them yesterday, and they are nearly gone today (w/in 24 hours). My Grandma-in-law, who worked in a bakery, loves them! My sister-in-law had 6 for breakfast. This is the first time I have made PB cookies and the recipe was simple; 10 min is perfect for the crisp edge and chewy center. I will be making more soon!
Quick edit: Grandma asked me for the recipe because she thinks it's better than her recipe!

a little too crumbly to my taste, but besides that, its an AMAZING cookie recipe. i did add some chopped walnuts, they added this flavor that is so good it's undescribable. i added more peanut butter too. Great recipe!

Really good cookies!! Used regular butter instead of unsalted. I also used Kosher salt, which is wonderful in the cookies; gives it a little salty sweetness when you bite in since Kosher is more coarse then regular salt. It is also important to add at least a tsp of vanilla, I added a tbsp. I also rolled 2 inch balls of dough into sugar before pressing them down with a fork. 10 minutes and you're good to go. PERFECT. YUM, YUM, YUMMY!!

Well my cookies are in the oven right now, so I don't know how they will turn out, but I am SO unimpressed with how they were before they went in the oven.  When I was putting the dough into balls i was actually able to squeeze the grease out. It is entirely unappetizing looking.  I must say the dough tasted ok... this is a good recipe if you like getting greasey.

The best peanut butter cookies EVER. They are perfect. I used salted butter and all natural peanut butter (increased the amount by about 1/4 cup) and they came out AMAZING. Peanut butter cookies are my favorite, and really good ones are hard to find. These are by far the best I've ever had.

Really Good. I used creamy peanut butter and added in mini peanut butter cups from Trader Joes. I did not refrigerate them but dropped them on to the cookie sheet by big spoonfuls and flattened them with the back of a spoon dipped in sugar. They turned out huge and wonderful!I will definately make these again, my husband can't stop raving about them:) One thing, the batch does make a lot of cookies, I will have to make the rounds to the neighbors houses so we don't eat them all!

I agree with everyone else.  350 for 8 minutes is just perfect.  I agree, also that there isn't enough peanut butter taste for me.  Next time I am going to decrease by 1/2 stick butter and substitute Peanut Butter for that and add a bit more...They are llight and chewy if you only cook them for 8 minutes.

This were very good.  I added about 1/2 cup more crunchy peanut butter based on past reviews.  I would definitely add at least that again, if not more and cut down the butter about 1/4 cup.

This is a great recipe!  I added 1 c. of chocolate chips and decreased the cooking time to 8 min (the cookies would have burned at 10).  Next time I make these I will increase the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups and decrease butter to 1/2 c.  Makes lots!

Made these with the kids after school and they were phenomenal! I only had salted butter on hand, so I just omitted the 1/2tsp salt and they came out perfect. Once cooled, we melted some milk chocolate chips over a double boiler and dipped each cookie in it, coating them moon pie-style. They came out tasting like peanut butter cups. Delish!

This is a great cookie recipe. I did not want to wait...so I just put the cookies in 350 for 10 minutes...they came out perfect! I used salted butter (on hand), I still put in the 1/2 tsp of salt (thats how I make the chocolate chip cookies)and smart balance creamy not chunky (on hand). These cookies were AWESOME!!!

YUM! I added a bunch more peanut butter (easily twice as much) and a bag of peanut butter chips.  Someone just walked by my office after taking a bite and I heard them say "Wow.  Oh, WOW!"  I chilled the dough very well, and even chilled the flattened balls before baking.  Baked at 350 for 13 minutes and got 4 dozen good sized cookies that are slightly crispy around the edges and soft and chewy throughout the middle.  This is my new favorite pb cookie recipe, thanks!

I love these cookies! Typically I double the batch and use half butter, half crisco. I like that flavor better. Also ,they set up on the edges a bit more with the butter and that crunchy and soft combo is what a pb cookie should have (in my eyes).

With so many recipes out there for this cookie, it was hard to decide which one to choose. I am soooo glad I chose this one! Based on other reviews, I added 1/4 c more pb & 1/4 c more flour, baked at 350 for 10 mins. The cookies came out thick, and wonderfully chewy in the middle. My go to pb cookie recipe from now on!!

I made them with no changes to the recipe and they turned out great!  These are not soft/chewy kind, so if that's what you prefer look for another recipe.

I doubled the recipe so I'd have some to freeze for school lunches.  As suggested, I added an extra cup of peanut butter (3 cups total) and an extra 1/2 cup of flour (3 cups total).  Didn't have time to refrigerate dough.  Just scooped with a small ice cream scoop and left them in balls on cookie sheet (didn't smash with fork).  Turned out great!

Wow, I was really surprised about these cookies.  I followed everything to a tee and they didn't turn out.  They burnt on the bottom (used parchment paper and they still burnt...I don't get it) and the taste was too bitter.  There was too much baking soda.  Next time, use less baking soda.

Excellent recipe, not quite like the one I was originally looking for but they turned out great.  I even made 1/2 batch of PB&J Cookies by adding 1/2 tsp. of blackberry jam in the center of half of them.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks!

I added 1/2cup more flour like others suggests
My tip: for the criss-cross pattern, i dip the fork in water after each imprint (so the dough doesnt stick)
My theory: After the cookies are done, i turn the oven off, open the door but leave the cookies inside to cool (keeps the cookies from going flat)

As a mother of a little one with peanut allergies I have really missed peanut butter cookies.  Then I decided to try this recipe but instead of using peanut butter I used sunflower seed butter.  I just have to say that it was such a good substitute, it tasted so similar but delicious in its own way.  I highly recommend trying it!!!

I was looking for a soft cookie and here it is. It can however become a chewy in the center, crispy on the outside cookie though. That is not what I wanted. Make sure you make fairly large balls if you want a softer cookie. If you don't mind a crispy outside, then make them smaller. I agree with others that more peanut butter taste is also needed somehow in this recipe.

Added about 1/2 Cup more peanut butter for extra peanut buttery goodness; did not bother to refrigerate for the hour (I was in a hurry).  They turned out WONDERFULLY!  Also added Reese's Pieces candies.  YUM!

Soooo good. I also went by other's reviews and increased the flour by 1/4 cup and the peanut butter(non crunchy) by a 1/2 cup. I also did half butter half shortening. I used a 2 inch scoop and baked for 11 minutes at 375 degrees...BIG soft chewy cookies. Delish!!!

I've been using this recipe for over 40 years, and my mother used it before me.  I believe it originally came from a Betty Crocker cookbook.  The only thing different in my recipe is that it calls for 1/2 c.  butter and 1/2 c. shortening.  They're a perfect basic peanut butter cookie.  One Christmas I used a different recipe and  it didn't go over well at all.

So I'm allergic to peanut butter and I substituted soybutter for this recipe. Honestly its pretty good. Its lacking the true peanut butter taste but its the closest thing I can have to the true thing. I added vanilla. Also Iput it in the freezer for about about 20 minutes as time was not on my side. In the oven for about 8 minutes. Flattened out a bit but was still chewy and fluffy. Good recipe.

Wow! These turned out delicious! I followed the ingredient list exactly, and using chunky peanut butter really elevated the taste and texture. I did adjust the baking temperature down to 350 for 11 - 12 minutes baking time and also added in two generous handfuls of chocolate chips.  They were the perfect mix of peanut butter and chocolate without one overpowering the other.  Will definitely make again!

The perfect, soft chewy peanut butter cookie! I took the advice of the other reviewers and added an extra 1/2 C. peanut butter, 1/2 C. flour, and, because I'm a vanillaholic, I also added a significant amount of mexican vanilla. YUMMMMMM!

Very good. As others suggested, I upped the peanut butter and flour and added 1 tsp vanilla. I also dipped mine in sugar before baking. To my taste, the extra sugar makes these better. For a chewier, airier cookie, don't flatten. For a crisper, browner cookie, flatten. Overall, lighter and more delicate than store-bought peanut butter cookies.

I Also did a little adjusting of this recipie. Just added 1/4 cup more flour and 1/2 C. peanut butter. No salt needed if you only have salted butter.  I also roll into balls and use a potatoe masher to make a nice checkered pateren, just dont mash to hard.

This recipe was so easy.  I actually didn't put the eggs in (I forgot!) and only used 1/2 tsp baking powder and Baking soda.  I also used creamy peanut butter, and the mix rolled so easily into balls that my 4 yr old granddaughter helped me.  We made the balls a little bigger, and only got 36 cookies, but we loved them!

The last batch of these are in my oven right now and they are awesome!  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and added an extra 1/4c. flour to the recipe and they are perfect!  I had a timing issue, they took a few extra minutes with my oven, but I will definately be using this recipe in the future!  The perfect PB cookie!  Thanks for this recipe :-)))

I also added 1/2 cup of peanut butter and 1/2 cup of flour. They came out perfect which surprised me because the baking temp seems high. They were a big hit with everyone in my family. I'm tripling or maybe even quadrupling the recipe this week to make for my sons football team. Oh, I also added a teaspoon of vanilla....yum!

This is a good recipe. Ive made these a few times and always end up adding something extra. Besides adding the extra 1/4 cup of PB and flour I also added 1 tsp of butter flavor extract. So good. Also cooked at 350 for exactly 9 mins and it was perfect using my electric stove.

This was exactly the recipe I was looking for. The only changes I made were making them (a lot) smaller, cooking for 8 mins, and rolling them in sugar before baking. This is my go-to pb cookie recipe from now on!

Yum!  Good texture and they stayed moist.  I also added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and some extra PB too.  I used them for PB&J Cookies!  So delish

I kept the ingredients the same, had to bake the cookies an extra minute. (My oven isn't really up to par on heating things well.) They were amazing! My secret? Nonstick cookie pans and parchment paper.

Wow! I don't even usually like peanut butter cookies, but these were amazing! The instant you bite into them your head is filled with visions of rainbows and sunshine (lol)!!! After reading other reviews, I added about two tablespoon more of peanut butter. They were perfect!! For some reason, my batch made 54 cookies instead of 24.... not sure about that.

I made these cookies yesterday for my dad and he absolutely LOVED them!  Per the other reviews, I added 1/2C more peanut butter, as well 1/2C more sugar.  This recipe made ALOT of cookies (I used my small cookie scoop)!!  Will definitely make again and again!  Thank you!

Based off others' reviews, I added an additional 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of flour.  These are delicious!  It makes a huge batch, so I froze 1/2 of the dough for use at a later date.  Perfect!

This is the same recipe I use and it is the same one my mom used to use also. The cookies are wonderful. I just want to mention to the person who took these to school for the children, to be sure there are no little ones allergic to nuts. That seems to be an issue with schools where I live.

OK, this is a pretty good recipe. Give it an A-. Issue is, unless you're feeding maybe 3 people, the portions are not sufficient. It's Christmas, and if you're like me, you make a whack of cookies. So I pretty much doubled everything (even more possibly) and added 2/3 cups more flour and 2teaspoons of vanilla extract. I didn't add any salt b/c I find PB salty already that you don't need the additional sodium to enhance the sweetness, unlike many other sweet dishes. Easy, good to make and remember to water your fork before you press down on the mixture if not it will stick. Cheers and Happy Christmas all! ;)

Great recipe, however I did tweak it a little bit. 2 cups of sugar is a little overkill since the PB already contains so much sugar so I used 1/2 cup of brown/granulated sugar instead and about a teaspoon of vanilla and they turned out AMAZING! I also used Smart Balance Light as a healthier alternative to butter and the cookies turned out well :)

I used half wheat/half white flour, used smooth peanut butter (added about 1/2 cup more than called for) and added a mixture of peanut butter/chocolate chips to some of them. Mine were almost done at 8 minutes, so I took them out of the oven and left them on the pan to continue baking for another minute or two.  They came out very chewy.  Even though peanut butter cookies are generally a more dry cookie - these came out just like I expected them to be.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I followed the other advises and added more peanut butter and flour. My husband liked it but I didn't think it taste really good. It wasn't sweet enough and you can barely taste the peanut butter.

This recipe worked great! Just a side note - to help make the dough smoother and chewier, melt the butter in the microwave for about 30 seconds first. Thank you, Shirley!

I recommend cooking them under 8 minutes under the same temperature. All ovens are different, but mine overcooked with 10 minutes.

A little cakey, but I took the advise of others and added more flour.  I'm going to try the original recipe next time to see if I can get a chewier cookie.

this recipe does NOT make 24 cookies! It makes 6 dozen + 6 extra = 78 COOKIES! wow. Ended up giving half away. However, they are SUPER yummy!! Loved it. But I will cut the recipe in a third from now on ;)

PHENOM!!  my absolute fav classic peanut butter cookie!!  Only changes made was an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter and 1/2 cup of flour to make the cookies soft and plump.  If you add this you do not need to refrigerate.

I've only made one batch so far.   The night I put the ingredients together I was so excited to have peanut butter cookies that I only refrigerated the dough for 40 minutes and made them about teaspoon size, and they came out pretty flat and crispy.   But after leaving the dough in my fridge for about a day or two, I made the rest of it and made them tablespoon size, and WOW.. they're soft and chewy, just how I love my peanut butter cookies.   So, if you didn't read everything I just wrote. I'd say  1. colder dough = better and  2. bigger balls = better

I made these for my 3 and 4 year old who dont really like sweets and these were perfect.  I took advice of others and added 1/2 cup more of flour and P.B.  I took some to my parents house and everyone ate them up and wanted the recipe.  Definitely a keeper in this house!

My family absolutely loved these peanut putter cookies. I use this recipie every time now. I made them and took them to a staff party and everyone was asking me for the recipie! I do add a tsp. of vaniilla. I do add everything the recipie states and use real butter. I cook them for 8 minutes and take them out to cook on the pan for about 2 min. They are soft and slightly crisp on edges. So yummy! The next day a beautiful soft cookie kept in a covered container. Thank you so much for this great recipie. :)

These are delicious!  I didn't refrigerate the dough for an hour, I just placed the cookie sheets in the freezer for a few minutes before placing the cookie dough onto the sheets.  I also placed the bowl of cookie dough in the fridge as the previous batch cooked.  I took some others' advice and added 1/4 cup peanut butter and 1/4 cup flour.  I rolled each cookie dough scoop in sugar and pressed down with a fork on top.  I also had to set my stove to 325 because it runs hot...and I baked them for 7 minutes.  Thank you!

Great and easy cookies to make. I needed an easy peanut butter cookie for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them. I would suggest making them smaller on the cookie sheet because it tends to be softer when you make them larger.

This is the best peanut butter cookie recipe ever! I use my medium Pampered Chef cookie scoop to get perfectly shaped cookies every time. They spread a bit upon cooking and make a large cookie also.

I made this recipe for my husband. Peanut butter cookies are his favorite. I didn't think there was enough peanut butter in the recipe. I ended adding more and they were much better, but I think I will stick to my old peanut butter cookie recipe.

These are very good. I substituted the white sugar with brown sugar and only had creamy peanut butter on hand. As others have suggested, I did increase the peanut butter by 1/4 cup and added 1 cup of chocolate chips.

Great peanut butter cookie recipe.  I also added 1/4 cup peanut butter and cooked them a few minutes short so they'd be more chewy inside. Perfect peanut butter cookie!

Oh my GOSH!!!  These are the perfect peanut butter cookie! They are just like the cookies we used to make my dad and he would eat the entire batch in one sitting.  I'm so glad I found this recipe.  Brings back good memories.

I don't know if it was the PB I used, but it was not as peanutty as I would like.  However, the people in the office liked it.  I used salted butter and omitted the salt.  In my next batch, I'd probably reduce the sugar content as well as I personally found it on the sweet side.

I'm actually in the refrigeration stage, however I wanted to comment on two things annoying me at the moment:
1. I see the same reviews being repeated on here over & over, which in actuality, does NOT result in a real 5 star recipe, more like some BOTS reviewed it.
2. 99% of you say, "oh yeah these were great! Hey, did I mention before I even tried your recipe, I added 2 cups of flour, omitted the peanut butter & forgot to bake them?"
SERIOUSLY, why leave a review if you never actually followed the recipe, it's like you're not all there!
Often times for a search, "highest rated" is part of my search criteria. But not anymore! I'm sure these will taste fine. I'm not changing a thing.

Excellent recipe!  For those having problems with spreading or cookies not keeping fork imprint: a little trick I learned in 4-H eons ago is to place the sheet of cookies in the freezer for about 5-10 minutes, then bake.  Also, be sure your cookie sheets are cooled down before you you place the dough on them. These cookies contain a large amount of fat so heat before baking is the problem. Adding more flour toughens the cookie and adding more peanut butter only adds more fat. Hope this helps.

I made this recipe and was extremely pleased. The first time I make a recipe I normally follow the directions and ingredients because it is unfair to change something and than give a review on a recipe that the recipe wasn't followed. I was reluctant to follow the recipe sue to all the reviews regarding flat cookies or other things. I made exactly as recipe stated including the refrigeration. When I placed the fork marks on the cookie I didn't "flatten" it either. I pressed about 1/2 way down. I use a cookie scoop to make the cookies the same size and parchment paper.  The cookies turned out absolutely gorgeous. I would not change a thing. The one thing I would like to mention is the importance of using quality cookie baking sheets. A cheap cookie sheet will leave a baker extremely puzzled and angry when the cookies looked like pancakes.  I have seen people try to add more flour, chill for ridiculous amounts of time and several other things when in fact it was the cookie sheet.

Great recipe, nice and easy.. Followed the directions and waited till they cooled before removing them from pan...my 6 yr old was hovering over them waiting till they could be eaten..  These are now "the best cookies I have ever made" according to him.

I added a half a cup of chocolate chips. I should have added another 1/2 of cup of peanut butter because I used plain and not chunky.The cookies are light like sugar cookies.

My husband just told me that these were the best peanut butter cookies I ever made. The only thing I did differently Was to use salted butter because that's all I had and creamy peanut butter. I rolled them in sugar and flattened them with a potato masher, makes for an interesting top.

These cookies were perfect! We added chocolate chunks to them and I'm sure I'll be making them for years to come. I think the refrigeration is really helpful if you don't like flat cookies. Ours came out of the oven nice and plump.

42 cookies-GONE in and hour!  I used half margarine/half butter (just to be more affordable).  I also used 3 cups flour and 1 tsp. vanilla.  I did refrigerate the dough for over an hour.  The first batch came out great, 2nd and 3rd batches fell a little.

I just made these and they came out great.  I added  tsp of vanilla and mini chocolate chips.  I did not refrigerate the dough.  All I did was roll into small balls and leave them instead of pressing them down.  They came out great, so easy and quick to make.  I baked them for 10 mins.  Left them on the cookie sheet for a couple of minutes for them to set then moved them to a cookie rack.  No problem at all.

These are downright dangerous. I didn't have unsalted butter, so I used salted and omitted the 1/2 tsp salt. Only baked for 8 minutes and they were perfect. (My oven runs a little warm and I like soft cookies.) No issues with thin or overlapping cookies. A welcome addition to my "look no further" recipe book. Thank you for sharing!

I read some of the reviews before I started making these and noticed people were complaining about the cookie being a bit thin. So, I ended up adding about 1/4 cup more flour and a bit more peanut butter (creamy instead of crunchy). I made these yesterday and was really satisfied with the results. Definitely will be making these again!

I just used the recipe for the ingredients list and forgot about the one hour refrigeration requirement.  Turns out, it didn't matter.  They turned out great!  I only had smooth peanut butter so I added one cup chopped peanuts.  Then I saw that I had some Hershey's Kisses leftover and some butterscotch chips, so I peeled and chopped the kisses and added about a cup of each (chopped kisses and bscotch chips).  I used a 2TB scooper and made flat scoops onto the tray, pressed them with a fork dipped into sugar and baked them for 12 minutes in my gas oven.  FANTASTIC!!

I am kicking myself for not reading the reviews just because the rating was good. I did not care for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. FLAT cookies; makes about 6 dozen! As I was mixing the ingredients I knew this would be the case. Didn't taste much like peanut butter. After an hour and a half in the fridge the dough was still gooey. I shaped the balls the best I could then put them in the freezer, they still spread like no ones business!

 Because they spread so much the cookies were crunchy. I like my peanut butter cookies  fat and soft. Will not use this recipe again.

Perfect.  As it is written, it is perfect!
I always try to make a recipe as written even though I read the reviews first.  This one turned out exactly as it should have, despite the problems that others seem to have encountered along the way.  (Though I admit, I used crunchy peanut butter per hubby's request. ;)  My suggestions to those guys are to try again! :)

My tips: 
1. When you "flatten" the dough balls, press just hard enough to make the cross hatch marks, but not so much as to completely flatten them out.  They will bake up fluffy, and slightly flatten as they cool.

2. Make sure your oven is preheated to 375 degrees and the rack is in the center.  If your oven is too cool, the cookies won't set fast enough, and they'll spread out and get flat.

3. DON'T over bake them!  I know says that in the recipe, but I can't stress it enough.  They will definitely seem underdone, but if the bottoms are brown (and maybe even the cross marks on top are slightly browned) they are done!  I did 10 minutes exactly.

Thanks to Shirley for this classic perfect cookie recipe!  This will be added to my company's menu for sure!!! :D

yummy!  I added a couple Table spoons of honey, because I love the combination of peanut butter & honey. and then about 1/4 c. more flour. and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet before transferring to a cooling rack. the cookies were crisp & perfect!

This was my first time making this particular cookie and it was very yummy! I read the reviews before I started baking them and I did as others recommended, I added and extra quarter cup of flour and peanut butter. I also used creamy peanut butter instead. They came out wonderfully. I also set my oven to 350, it seems happiest there and the bake time was right between 10 and 11 minutes, very good. I can say this peanut butter loving house-hold will be making these a bunch in the future. One other difference is my husband made the brown sugar, it was not store bought. Thanks for sharing.

heres a twist some of you might like, before you flatten the dough with the fork, dip the fork in your favorite jelly ( raspberry for me ) or melted chocolate. i doubt this is an original idea but i didnt see it posted.

Wow! I was craving peanut butter cookies and looked this up. I went through many of the reviews/comments and adapted the recipe accordingly. I've just eaten five. (Oh-oh!) These are hands-down as good as any expensive cookie at a coffeehouse but fresher! I added 1/4 cup of flour and probably a little more than 1/2 cup of peanut butter. I used Trader Joe's Organic Crunchy Peanut Butter with Sea Salt. I used salted butter which was what I had on hand--so I didn't add any salt. I used 1 and 1/2 cups of packed brown sugar and half a cup of white sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla. I also added slightly chopped peanuts. I chilled the very heavy dough for one hour and baked just four cookies at first to test them. I made balls closer to 2 inches, rolled them in granulated sugar (I had never tried this before), flattened them slightly with the criss-cross of a fork, and baked them for 10 minutes at 350 degrees. I moved them after about two minutes from the baking sheet to a plate to cool. They are absolutely perfect. Thanks for this recipe and to everyone who added advice and experience.

I followed the suggestions of other people about the extra flour and Pb.  Also added some chocolate chips, these were so good, got so many compliments and requests for more.  Have made these about 5 times in a month!!

I have made these many times and they taste wonderful, the only change I make is that I use 1 stick of margarine and 1/2 cup of butter flavored crisco instead of a cup of butter. My family beg for these ¡ALL 6 OF THEM!

High Altitude adjustments (over 6,000 ft).    I increased the peanut butter by a HEAPING 1/4 cup (it could have been closer to 1/2 cup).  I used High Altitude Hungarian Flour and increased by 5 tbls.  I reduced Baking Powder to 3/4 tsp and decreased Baking Soda to 1 tsp.  I found that I had to bake these at 375 degrees for 9 minutes.  I brought them into my gift store as a customer snack....I am now on my THIRD batch!  My yield was also better thn advertised...perhaps my cookies were a tad bit smaller but I managed 52 cookies.

This was a great and simple enough snack to prepare for a group meeting I attend every so often. I did make one adjustment. I added raisins which add a nice chewy contrast to any chunks of peanut that may not have fully melted during the baking process.

Quick and easy peanut butter cookies. I was too impatient to let them refrigerate for a full hour - I put the dough in the fridge for about 20 minutes, then started baking, leaving the dough in the fridge between batches. I did add about 1/4 cup extra flour and some vanilla extract as was recommended by a number of reviewers. I baked them at 375 for about 8 minutes so they were nice and chewy. I left them on the cookie tray to cool for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack - otherwise they were a bit too soft. I also made half the batch with chocolate chips (they still needed to be flattened with a fork). I brought these to work and they were gone before lunch!

I looked this up on my phone as a reference while I was in the grocery store.  I ended up following it as is, and it was even better than the recipe that I usually use.  NO CHANGES NEEDED.  Well.... I did add some chocolate chips to the ones for my wife.

This has been my p.b. recipe for years, with the exception of baking powder!  I'll try adding it to my cookie dough recipe the next time I make these. I no longer roll the batter into balls.  Instead, I use a cookie scoop and leave the dough as is when it's dropped on the cookie sheet.  I get a cookie that spreads a bit and makes for a great chewy on the inside with crisp edges on the outside.  I could make these cookies every week and have a happy husband.  He absolutely loves them!

Prep Tip: Never, ever microwave the butter to soften it!  If it is too soft, it will change the entire recipe and you'll end up with cookie batter you could wring out! Thirty minutes on the kitchen counter will soften the butter enough to work with in your electric mixer.
Also, if you want to ensure the cookie dough is the right consistency for baking, take a bit of the dough and roll it in your hands.  If the dough doesn't stick to your hands, it's good to bake!!!  If it is a bit sticky, just add a little bit of flour, maybe a 1/4 cup at a time, until you have the right consistency for baking.
This is something I do frequently because I don't measure the peanut butter so if I've added too much, I'll need to add more flour at the end.

WARNING! This recipe will NOT work if you are using all natural peanut butter with no oil added. They come out like flour. There isn't enough oil. Look elsewhere if you have that type of peanut butter.

OUTSTANDING!! I make these cookies for the house and to send to my two nephews stationed overseas. They're a HUGE hit! 

I only cook the cookies for 8 minutes though, to keep the insides particularly moist and chewy. I get 5 stars from everyone who's tasted them.

AWesome cookies. I double the batch make half just Peanut butter and the other half with choc chips...I do refrigerate the dough overnight however. If in a need to do sooner I stick the dough in the freezer for awhile...Five stars from me!

I used Almond butter instead of peanut butter, tripled the batch minus 1 Cup of butter and the recipe was perfect.  nice firm dough that did not need to be refrigerated before baking.  Love them!

just as a peanut butter cookie should be, be careful not to over cook, I like mine a little crispy on the edges and with a chewy peanut buttery middle.

Thumbs up from all 3 kids!  I was out of all-purpose flour so I used self rising (deleting salt, baking powder, and baking soda).  I also followed some others modifications and added another 1/4 cup of peanut butter.  They turned out just fine.

I made the cookies again and used all purpose flour and did not add any extra peanut butter, and they were delicious!

This recipe rocks. I followed someone else's alteration of making it 1 1/2 cups Peanut Butter and adding 1/4 cup extra of Flour. Also just eyed in some Vanilla extract. They turned out fluffy and golden and AWESOME! I also rolled half of the ball in sugar and with that side up made the little criss cross pattern. They're amazing. :D

Like the title says this is a classic cookie recipe.  I am not a fan of peanut butter myself but I love a good peanut butter cookie and theses are really yummy.  I didn't have unsalted butter so I used my lightly salted sweet cream butter and smooth peanut butter.  I could eat a whole batch myself.

wonderful recipe! these turned out perfect! I read other reviews and wanted to make sure they didn't spread out, so added a small (3.5 oz) pkg of vanilla pudding mix, also I only had creamy peanut butter and wanted some texture so I ground up about 1/3 cup extra whole peanuts in my food processor and added it into the mix at the end. Perfection!!! :-)

I like my cookies a little more chewy so I only used 3/4 cup of butter. But otherwise followed the recipe exactly...and this is a great recipe! One that I will be using many more times...and will recommend to anyone :)

I was never a big peanut butter cookie fan until i made these.  I like to consider myself somewhat an expert on baking ;) 
I did change the recipe like most:  added 1 tsp vanilla
extra 1/2 cup chunky peanut butter
extra 1/4 cup flour
-perfecto! yum yum! baked for 8 minutes, used a cookie scoop, made about 36 cookies!

Just like the title says, these are your classic peanut butter cookies. Exactly how you would expect them to be.  I used all-natural peanut butter and increased the amount a little (maybe 1.5 cups) Because, I think, the natural peanut butter is quite stiff, I had no problem at all with too-thin cookies. And this recipe makes TONS! Mine baked for 8 minutes.

This cookie has make the top of my list (and I'm not even that big of fan of PB cookies!)    I made a few adjustments, mostly because I realized a little too late I didn't have enough of 2 ingredients.  
Per suggestion of other reviewers, I added extra 1/4 Cup flour.  Also, I only had 1/4 C brown sugar so rest is Brown Sugar Splenda blend (you really can't tell) and had a little bit of Peanut Butter with Honey (made by Skippy) so used that as my "extra" peanut butter.
Apparently, I made them TOO small as I got almost 10 dozen from doubled batch.  And mine took about 10-12 minutes.

These are great cookies.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and added 1/4 cup additional flour and also peanut butter, rolled in sugar and threw in a couple of handfuls of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Baked at 350 for approx. 8 minutes.  They were soft and very tasty.  I will make them again and again!

This is a very quick and easy recipe to make, and the cookies are great.  I cut the recipe in half and got four dozen cookies, and I was generous in how much peanut butter I used.

Quite yummy. I've made PB cookies before with the very basic recipe on the PB jar and they tasted like a mouthful of PB... these, on the other hand, tasted like COOKIES. Definitely making them again. :)

This is a keeper!  Like others suggested I added an additional 1/2 c flour and 1/2c peanut butter.  Baked for exactly 8 min.  I halved the recipe which yielded 24 cookies.  The all recipes servings says 24 but the orecipe is for 48 cookies.

These taste really good, but are very crumbly. You don't have to chew them they break into crumbs in your mouth. Too dry. I like a more chewy pb cookie.

My favorite pb cookie recipe to date.  Thanks for adding this! Crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy and gooey on the inside.

Maybe I was expecting too much or did something wrong but these didn't come out the way I imagined. I used creamy peanut butter instead of the crunchy so maybe it was missing that element...

After reading several reviews I also made the followig changes: I added an additional 1/4cup flour, 1/4 cup peanut butter, and 1tsp vanilla. I did not press with a fork. I used my ookie baler, and when done baking, 350 for 9 min, I topped each cookie with a chocolate kiss. They were wonderful! They were moist, and done to perfection. Would've rated a 5 if no changes wer required.

The cookies came out pretty soft with a nice shape & consistency. They were less sweet than I'd like and a bit less flavorful. I followed the modifications Denielle2 suggested with additional PB & flour, as well as changing the cooking temp &  time.

YUM!!!  Made twice.  Once with no changes other than used salted butter and omitted the salt.  And the second time I swapped a cup of flour for a cup of oatmeal.  Both times, amazing!  The oatmeal made them a bit crispier/crunchier which I preferred, but both ways were totally tasty. (note that I did use natural peanut butter, the kind that is made of peanuts only, not the processed sugar added hydrogenated kind)

this is my go to pb cookie recipe. like other reviewers, i increased the pb by 1/2-1cup. i also used organic, natural, creamy pb. this last time i used 1 cup of pb and about 3/4c of nutella, with amazing results. also increased the flour by 1/2 cup. great recipe that is very forgiving if you add a little here and there.

Just made my first batch of these. I made a few alterations to the recipe based on reader reviews and personal taste- I used an additional 1/4 cup of flour, used smooth peanut butter rather than crunchy, and added half a bag of peanut butter chips. They came out great, and the recipe yielded approx. 30 small-medium size cookies. Thanks Shirley!

When I first found this recipes, I noticed that a lot of people had altered it, but I decided to give it a chance and see how it would turn out as-is. Rather than changing the ingredients I just refrigerated it overnight instead of for an hour. The cookies were perfect! They are also good if you roll your dough in sugar before baking.

I made this recipe with extra peanut butter, and extra flour. After that, I made the recipe as posted here. This recipe makes great cookies, with no need to change any further. Plenty of my family like these cookies, they don't last very long. This is a great way to use up the extra peanut butter. Eight minutes, and these cookies come out OK. Careful not to overbake!

Wonderful cookies, my grandaughter loves them.  I added 3 tablespoons of honey to the recipe and took out 1/4 cup of the white sugar -  Just an old baking habit - I think it helps the cookies stay moist.  Thanks for a good basic, no fail cookie.

This was a very good cookie. However, I did find them a bit too thin and crunchy. Next time I will take the advice of other reviewers to get the consistancy (chewyness) I prefer.

I decided to try this recipe the other day when I suddenly was in the mood for peanut butter cookies.    Since I was by myself and would be for a few days, I halved the recipe. I made a few substitutions: One, I used all natural creamy peanut butter instead of the chunky peanut butter called for in the recipe; two, I used whole wheat flour; and three, I used kosher salt.    The cookies came out so soft and were so delicious! I swear those were the best peanut butter cookies I ever had, and I'm not just saying that because I baked them!

The first time I made these, I didn't refrigerate them. Huge mistake. The second time, they were superb. I didn't have chunky PB when I made either batch and they were delicious. Next time I will make the cookies with chunky PB...if I get the PB before I get the craving.

I usually do not like peanut butter cookies. But I make this ones for my family. They came our very yummy and light ( which is weird being that the ingredients are no light at all). So I really like them. I try one and two and tree and now my diet is for next week :) I did change it a little bit because i did not have all the ingredients on hand. I added 1 stick ( 1/2 cup) butter and half stick margarine. 2 cups white sugar and 1/2 tbs molasses ( no give the flavor of brown sugar). Everything else remains the same. I got 3 1/2 doz and they where pretty good size.

I followed others' recommendations of increasing the flour to 1-1/2 and the peanut butter to 1-1/4.  Excellent cookies!

Pretty good as far as PB Cookies go, I added raw sugar on top to the second batch that went into the oven. Tip, Dip 1/2 of your cookie in melted chocolate almond bark and place on parchment paper to harden then you have a chocolate PB Cookie. Irresistable!!

These cookies were fabulous.  I did not bake them all at once.  Instead I baked half the batch, and prepped and refrigerated cookie dough balls for the second half, baking them 3 days later.  The 2nd half came out just as great as the 1st half.  The dough keeps well in the refrigerator.

Would try adding 1/2 cup more peanut butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla next time.  Also bake at 350 degrees for 9-10 minutes.   Not my favorite - all right

I absolutely love this recipe! It is so simple and easy and also very, very yummy! Everyone I bake these for just LOVE these cookies. What also helped was to take from some of the suggestions made in the reviews with more peanut butter and flour that really made these the award-winning. Will be the peanut butter cookie recipe that I take with me for years to come.

I am not a big peanut butter cookie fan and had never made them before, but my husband asked me to make him some.  I first tried a flourless peanut butter cookie recipe and they were awful!  I tried this recipe next and what a difference!  I sub'd creamy PB for the crunchy, added an extra  1/4 c of PB and 1/4 c of quinoa flour I had in the pantry in addition to the all-purpose flour and a tsp of vanilla extract.  They came out perfect!  Not too soft and not too crispy.  They came out pretty big and made more than the recipe said they'd make.  This recipe made me a fan of PB cookies!

FABULOUS!!! I added 1/2 cup more (creamy-store brand) peanut butter and 1 cup peanut butter chips. I made my cookie balls a little larger than suggested and they turned out wonderfully at 375 degrees, 12 min. Great tip: Roll the cookie balls in white sugar for even better presentation! Try this recipe!

I had a mad craving for something sweet tonight but i didn't have any oil to bake any of the items i want. I came across this and thought i'd try it since i had all the ingredients. It was very yummy. I followed what others said and added 1/2 cup more each of PB and flour and added some vanilla. My 4 year old is on his 3rd cookie right now. I did however was hoping that they would be more chewy then crumbly in texture but the flavor is really nice and the more i ate the more i like it :) Would definitely remake again.

Great peanut butter cookie recipe!!  Followed recipe as written and they came out perfect!   I did find that 375 was about 25 degrees too hot for my oven and baked the second sheet at 350 for ten minutes.  If you refrigerate your cookie dough long enough to solidify the melted butter then you shouldn't have any problems with thin cookies!  If you want to add anything, add a tsp of vanilla and throw in some peanut butter chips, makes them extra extra special and gives you a burst of peanut butter in every bite!   Yummy!  Thank you for a great recipe!  Had a house full of kids and adults and no left over cookies.

I was going to make the 3-ingredient peanut butter cookie (1c pb, 1 egg, 1c sugar) but I decided to venture out. This was excellent. My daughter and I got in there togeter and rolled out the balls and pressed them down on the pan. Everytime I make this delicious cookie I will remember the time I spent with her making them. They were not to thin, nor were they crumbly. They were a perfect balance of moist and dry; which, made them a little chewy. You can take the same recipe and pass it around and everyone can get different results. I dod not alter this recipe and it was perfect.

Didn't have unsalted butter so used sweet cream butter and no salt.  This will be the recipe that I will use for peanut butter cookies from now on.  My grandkids love them.

Awesome. I added a little more peanut butter and flour in addition to a teaspoon of vanilla. I made half the amount which ended up being 2 dozen - my husband and I ate so many that I had to take the leftovers to work the next day to keep us from getting fat! Everyone at work like them, too :-) I think next time I'll throw in 1/2 cup of chopped peanuts like my grandma used to do.

great cookie recipe.  I followed the other suggestions and added another 1/2 cup flour and peanut butter.  i baked at 350 for 10 min.  The cookies on my dark non-stick pan browned nicely.  I would turn the heat to 375 for my light aluminum pan as those were still not brown after 10 min.  I also rolled the dough in sugar before baking and everyone said they liked that touch.  I don't care for peanut butter cookies but ended up eating a bunch because they tasted great!  Awesome recipe!!!

Great cookies, but a little too greasy the first time I made them. I reduced the butter by 1/2 and the white sugar by 1/4 Cup and instead sprinkled the sugar on top of the cookie before baking. I also used this recipe to put chocolate kisses on top. I took them out of the oven when they almost seemed underdone and then after they cooled a bit, they were perfect.

Great!! I used more flour and peanut butter as some other reviewers suggested. I took it to a church youth activity, everyone loved it!! I would say that if you add extra flour, add equal amounts of extra PB, otherwise it gets crumbly and hard to roll into cookies.

These cookies are awesome!  I like the texture of them.  I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy.  After making the criss-cross deign, I sprinkled sugar on them.

These cookies were wonderful! I absolutely loved them! And a tasty hint, add 2 cups of chocolate chips for an extra burst of yummy goodness. :)

I made this for an end of year party for high schoolers--- I received so many compliments! My friend that loves peanut butter also loved them- I also added 1/2c more of flour and 1/2c more of peanut butter, these were just perfect, not too thin either.

These cookies were great.  A little on the dry side when rolling into balls but very moist when cooked.  I over cooked my first batch, my oven is a little on the hotter side.  So, watch the timing.

Its faster if you use a meat pulverizer instead of a fork and the cookies look really professional after cooking. Its also a good stress reducer, just don't hit the dough too hard.

Per a previous review I added an extra 1/2 c. peanut butter and 1/4 c. flour. It tasted excellent, but it really spread out quite a bit. Next time I'll only add 1/4 cup extra PB, but I'll leave everything else the same. I used half natural style PB and half regular PB (I was trying to use up what I had on hand), and it came out great. With the additional PB & flour this recipe makes more like 32 cookies, rather than the 24 stated.

I've been looking for a great peanut butter cookies recipe for many years.  I like butter in my recipes and so just couldn't find the right one.  This is it!  The cookies were thick, soft, and yummy.  I did add the extra 1/4 cup peanut butter and 1/4 cup flour, as some reviewers suggested, and they were beautiful.  My family ate them all!

These were very good. I made a few changes, after reading some of the reviews. I used 1 1/2 cups smooth peanut butter and added an extra 1/4 cup flour. I used a fork to make a criss-cross pattern on top of the cookies and I baked them at 350 degrees for 12 minutes. With these changes they turned out great.

I found this recipe to be awesome!  The dough was perfect and the baking time was perfect.  They came out very soft and chewy.  I have had great reviews on these cookies and many requests to make more. I had absolutely no crumbling and no "flour taste".  This will be placed in my permanent recipe file!

The first time I attempted to make (sugar) cookies they came out horrible! LOL But this recipe looked simple so I decided to give it another shot. After reading several reviews, I added an extra 1/4 c. of flour & PB & 1 tsp vanilla. The cookies came out yummy & my hubby loved them! Thanks for the great recipe :)

I love this recipe but I had to substitute some things as my daughter is anaphylactic to eggs and nuts. So for those of you w/ allergies try this: Instead of peanut butter, use Soybutter or Sunbutter; instead of eggs, use EnerG egg replacer; and if your little one is allergic to milk use a butter substitute; and if your little one is allergic to wheat, use gluten free flour. Hopes this helps. :) Also, I added more flour and soybutter as suggestions from others. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made a half batch of these with about 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour and also used mostly that Omega 3 super healthy peanut butter. With most cookies make sure you undercook this babies just a little bit. They definitely keep that melt in your mouth effect the next day, even if they're not straight out of the oven.

Fantastic!  I added a 1/2c creamy peanut butter and an additional 1/2c flour and these could not be more perfect.  I didn't even chill the dough and these were downright fantastic!

This recipe is great!  I'm giving it five stars because I estimated the quantities, forgot to add the eggs until the last minute, didn't have any brown sugar or baking powder, and then baked them in an oven with no temperature controls, and they still turned out perfectly.  You really can't go wrong.

Next time I might add chocolate chips though.  :)

I don't think I have had a peanutbutter cookie in over 10 years. Not that I don't like them, I just usually choose chocolate when I have a choice. But the other day I had a hankering for an old fashioned peanut butter cookie like my grandma used to make. This recipe fits that bill exactly. My only change was that I used all natural creamy peanut butter. These were soft, and perfectly flavored. I only baked a few the first batch and left the dough in the fridge. Worked perfectly all week to bake just what I wanted and have fresh cookies every day.

I gave this recipe three stars because I did make some changes. I made these with half organic, unsalted butter and half I Can't Believe It's Not Butter; I also reduced the  brown sugar by 1/4C and replaced the regular sugar with half raw sugar and half Splenda; and I doubled the amount of peanut butter in the recipe. I might add a little vanilla next time, as well, but with the changes I made I felt that the flavors were perfect! These cookies are soft and fluffy, but with just enough crunch around the edges. I baked them for 10 minutes at 350 degrees in my convection oven.

This recipe is awesome!  I took other reviewers advice and added 1/4 cup of peanut butter and 1/4 cup of flour to thicken it up a little and added 1 tsp of vanilla for a little extra flavor.  I used creamy peanut butter since we didn't have chunky on hand.  I made some by rolling them in granulated sugar (another reviewer's suggestion) before putting them on the cookie sheet and I made some without the sugar to compare the two.  The cookies rolled in sugar are much better!  I guess sugar makes everything better.  :)

I found this recipe to be quite good.  Leave the sugar like it is but cut out some of the flour or else the batter gets too crumbly.  I did add in some extra peanut butter and they turned out beautifully.

Great basic recipe.  I did a few changes myself which made it wonderful.  I started with melting the butter.  I increased the flour 1/2 a cup.  Added Vanilla extract.. 1/2 to 1 teaspoon.  Added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter.  I also added 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips (yes you can press them with a fork when they have the chips added) and baked them for about 9 minutes.

Although the  cookies baked up nicely, they didn't taste much like peanut butter. I like The Joy of Cooking recipe better. It makes a denser, more "peanuty" cookie.

I think this needs just a little more peanut flavor to rate a 5 for me.  It's very good but I can taste too much butter for my taste next time I'll use about 1 1/2 c of peanut butter.  This time I added 1 tsp. of vanilla, 3 cups flour, no baking powder but increase baking soda to 2 tsps. and used 1 1/4 c peanut butter.  These were initially 'fluffy looking' but as they cooled flattened right out and ended up a slightly crispy cookie.  Very good, it's a keeper.

I should have looked at the photo.  I was hoping for the cute litte PB cookies that keep their fork marks.   I spread this recipe out onto 2 cookie sheets - what a mistake.  They spread more than any cookie I've ever seen.  I started with one inch balls flattend slightly, and ended up with 2 giant sheets of 1/4 inch thick cookie that I had to slice into squares.  Absolutely could not tell they started off as circles or that they had cute fork marks I lovingly made in designs.  They did taste good though - wickedly sweet.

I give this 4 stars as-is, but with the addition of 1 tbs. vanilla and 1 cup of peanut butter chips, this recipe is perfect! I also only cooked for about 8 minutes rather than 10.

I am so excited!  I just made my first ever batch of homemade cookies!  I used this recipe.  These cookies were amazing!  Hint for those that aren’t used to making cookies from scratch, especially peanut butter cookies.  When all finished, the dough looks really dry and doesn’t seem to clump very well (I added ½ cup more flour and peanut butter also), but that is how homemade peanut butter dough is supposed to look!  I almost threw it out…or I’ll admit… thought I had to eat all of the dough (which is very yummy by the way, yes… I know not very unadvisable because of the eggs).   I am very pleased!  These tasted better than most of the other  peanut butter cookies I’ve tried, and I am just a novice chief.  Thank you!

There are NOT words!!!  Wow.  I am making cookies for a friends wedding actually and I have NEVER, no NEVER had success with peanut butter cookies.  BUT that has definitely changed.  I used a full 16 oz. jar of creamy JIF peanut butter, 3 sticks of butter, 1 1/2 cups of each sugar,(plus a tsp or so of molasses as I ran short of the brown sugar by a bit).  3 eggs, and 1 tsp vanilla.  Then i did a full 4 cups of flour.  Basically I time and a halved the recipe with a couple small additions.  No need to refrigerate.  8 minutes at 350.  WOW!!  Oh, and a hint.  I used the bottom of a plastic potato masher/ricer for perfect criss-cross pattern.  And I rolled them in sugar.  Perfect.

Hubby and son agree these are fantastic peanut butter cookies. I doubled the recipe and used an extra half cup of flour total, and I used an entire 18oz jar of crunchy peanut butter total. This made just a little over 12 dozen decent sized cookies! I let the dough sit for about 15 minutes in fridge before forming balls. Cooked 12 at a time on parchment paper for 9 minutes per tray at 350 degrees. Done perfectly in my oven this way (mine tends to run a little warm).

I saw the tips from other people to add more flour and peanut butter. I made half the recipe and added 1/8 cup peanut butter, but accidentally added too much flour (1/2 cup instead of 1/4 cup). So when I formed the cookies they were too crumbly... Don't make that mistake! Cookies turned out really yuummy but a little crispy. Next time I think I will just try to follow the recipe (and add a bit of vanilla extract still). The only other problem I had was that I made half the recipe, expecting to have 12 cookies. I came out with 36 cookies! The proportions are incorrect. Otherwise these cookies had a wonderfully nutty and completely peanut buttery flavor.

These were really good - reminded me of what my mom used to make! I did make some changes: I made them vegan, using egg substitute for the egg. I also had bought a jar of sunflower butter, which I love, but this time I had accidentally bought the unsalted, unsweetened kind, which really isn't so good for eating straight up. So I was looking for a way to use it up in a delicious way. I used about 2 1/4 c. sunflower butter (the rest of my can) and about 1/4 c. almond butter. I also upped the flour to 3 cups, as others suggested, but used whole wheat pastry flour. The cookies came out perfect, light and buttery. I will be making these again, probably with almond and sunflower butters again, but I will decrease the amount of shortening/butter/margarine to about 3/4 c. or even 1/2 c. They were just a little on the greasy side for my taste. Everyone at the potluck loved them though - said they tasted just like peanut butter cookies!

I made the recipe pretty much as stated except I used salted butter and creamy peanut butter. All amounts and other ingredients were kept the same. I baked for 9 minutes at 375 degrees and they came out perfect. Very good flavor for a peanut butter cookie, in my opinion. I will put this recipe into my permanent stash.

These are great peanut butter cookies...I only baked mine about 7 minutes then left them on the cookie sheet for about 3 minutes to finish cooking.  I froze about half the dough per another reviewers advice, so hopefully they turn out as well the second time around.  Thanks for a keeper :)

I used 1 and 1/4 c. peanut butter and salted butter; I decreased the salt to 1/4 t. and used kosher salt. Even so, these were too salty. I strongly suggest using unslated butter if possible, and, if using salted, I wouldn't use any extra salt. Also, don't overbake these - 10 minutes is just long enough; they finish baking on the cookie sheet, and if you overbake, they will be dry and too crispy. These are much better the second day; they were a little crumby right after they cooled. Overall, these are good cookies, easy to bake and quite tasty.

I'm in love with this recipe! These cookies turned out perfect. My mom is allergic to peanuts, so I made them with soy nut butter. They're completely yummy! I almost wanna wake her up to get her to try one now. They're that awesome. But I'll wait until tomorrow. Thanks for the delicious and easy recipe.

**Update: I made these with peanut butter  finally! They were every bit as amazing as I thought they'd be. I took them to my boyfriend's house the first time I met his family, and they loved both the cookies and me! They all said the recipe is a definite keeper.

I am updating this review slightly - as previous reviewers suggested, I am still adding 1 teas vanilla, and additional peanut butter and sugars to my batter. I also reduced the salt, but I used salted butter. And definitely roll the balls in sugar. I am now using 1/4 cup LESS flour because I like flatter cookies and I recently learned that more flour makes puffier cookies. I also want to mention that I use Smucker's natural creamy peanut butter, so I have added a tablespoon or two of vegetable oil depending on the state of my PB. I still luv these cookies, the batter is super tasty too!

these are the best peanut butter cookies! i did a few revisions, and they came out perfect. i added 2 cups of peanut butter and 2 cups white sugar, and only had one egg. if you are looking for more peanut butter taste, just keep adding peanut butter by the 1/4 cup and do some taste testing until it's to your liking. will definitely use this for a base recipe again!

This is the best peanut butter cookie and I've made many.. I used Jiff and the aroma was wonderful. I think it is important to use good quality peanut butter. I took them to a pot luck supper and everyone wanted the recipe. A keeper for sure.

One of the best I have tried! I like mine on the crunchy side so I baked an extra 4-6 minutes. Texture is just right for a peanut butter cookie, but I will try different brands of peanutbutter to get a more peanutty flavor. This one is going in my favorite recipe stash.

This recipe makes a big, chewy cookie with just the right amount of sweetness. However, even though I added an EXTRA 1/4 cup of peanut butter and an extra 1/4 cup of flour, my family still felt it could use more intense PB flavor. I also found they needed to cook more than 10 minutes long. Finally, I discovered that smashing the cookies with the fork made them spread out and get too flat, so with my last batches I just marked a crisscross pattern but did not press down hard. Next time, we will add even MORE peanut butter and see what happens. All in all, a very tasty cookie with great texture.

These turn out perfectly- very simple, just like peanut butter cookies are supposed to be! I add chocolate chips sometimes. Love these! A+

These cookies were delicious!  I did have a problem with how fast the bottoms browned, but I think it would be perfect if the temperature was 15 or 30 degrees lower.

My family and i loved this recipe. I changed a few things to it. I added extra half cup of peanut butter. 1 tablespoon of honey,and half a bag of choc. chips. I rolled the 1 inch balls in sugar but did not criss cross them with a fork. I baked them at 375 for 8 mins. They came out very soft and chewy. I will make these all the time now.

I was looking for a hearty, chewy cookie. This one is light and fluffy, with a few crumbs falling off the top. It's tasty, but not the cookie I wanted. These do puff up quite a bit as they cook, then fall down to a fairly "standard" size. Won't make again.

I'm no peanut butter cookie expert but these looked beautiful and tasted great.  Let them cool on the pan a minute or so to avoid breaking them while you are taking them off the pan.

My husband loves peanut butter cookies...and I didn't have a recipe.  I tried this recipe and he loved them.  Next time I'm going to add some more peanut butter for a little added flavor.  Overall though, a very excellent (and easy to make) cookie!

I was in a baking mood one day but low on everything except the essentials. I supplemented white sugar as I was out of brown and left out the salt but the cookies still came out fantastically. I also had to keep them in the gas oven for a few minutes more. Have had many requests to make more! Thanx so much for this easy, quick and versatile recipe!

The flavor was great, but the cookies spread out really thin, and they cooked fast (7-8 minutes).  The recipe says that it makes 4 dozen, but I got a whopping 98 (8 dozen +) - 2.5" cookies from it.

I did the same as other posters recommended -- I added an additional 1/4 cup extra peanut butter and 1/4 cup of flower. Rolled the balls in sugar before baking, and used salted butter so I omitted the salt. Turned out delicious!

THE BEST peanut butter cookies that I've ever had! I took the reviewers advice to add 1/2 C. more PB, and 1/2 C. more flour. Since I was Christmas cookie baking and worried about running out of butter, I used 1/2 butter + 1/2 shortening for the fat. Turned out TERRIFIC!!

I just made these cookies for the first time ever. I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and added 1/4 cup of flour (2 3/4 cups total) &1/4 cup of peanut butter (1 1/4 cups total) to the recipe. The dough formed perfectly & I had no problem with it staying together. I did have a hard time with pressing the fork down & the cookie remaining circular. Each time I pressed down with the fork the cookies cracked all over. They also tasted like they were missing something.... My husband said they tasted good. But, I think I was expecting more of a salty peanut butter flavor or something? I haven’t quite figured out what ingredient I am looking for. Having said that.... I think I might just follow the actual recipe next time & not make any personal inexperienced changes when I have never tried the recipe before!! Thank you for sharing your recipe & for listening. If anything, I am definitely learning and enjoying the recipes everyone graciously shares.

These cookies are perfect just the way they are but that is assuming all the ingredients are fresh and as written. 

  If you cookies are going flat one of three things likely happened. 
1. you used margarine and not butter.  With cookies you can not substitute one for the other unless specified.  They will always go flat with margarine, especially the recent no trans fat butters.  They are just not firm enough. 
2. You failed to refrigerate the dough or spent too much time handling them after you did.  The only change I recommend is to make the balls before you put it in the fridge  otherwise warm up when you roll them.  It will also reduce the amount of time you need to refrigerate to about 30 mins. 
3. You have old baking powder or baking soda so your cookies did not rise.  This is a common problem as people do not bake as often as they used to so it tends to sit in the cupboard for years. .  

  I have made "kisses cookies" every year. by adding a chocolate kiss to peanut butter cookies after they have finished cooking and are still warm and fluffy.   I lost my old recipe and went looking for a new one and I think these are the best I have ever made.  They were so fluffy it was amazing.

This is an awesome recipe!! After reading reviews, I added ½ cup flour and ½ cup of peanut better. Cooked at 15 minutes, turned out perfect. Oh, I also added M&M's.

Note: I live at high altitude (9,600ft.), so I turned oven down to 350°F.

The recipe is great! I used smooth peanut butter because I have people in my house that don't like nuts in their cookies and added walnuts and Reeses Pieces to mine.  Some were plain, some were Reeses Pieces only, and the rest had walnuts and Reeses Pieces. I made 5 dozen cookies (I increased the ingredients to make more) and they were gone in less than 2 days.

This is a very straightforward recipe.  Some have said the cookies spread but mine did not. I did not press them down with a fork at all. I also kept the batter cold while running the batches through the oven. I kept it in the fridge about two hours before I got back to it to bake . Also once the cookies came out of the oven I let them cool on the cookie sheet on the rack for two minutes before putting them onto the rack directly. I also use parchment for all my cookie baking. Great recipe!

I Don't know who this lady is, but she has simple recipe's.Shirley sadler,bon appetite had nothing over you. I don't like chefy recipes.And you talk alot conveying your thoughts in word's"good thing".The only thing I did different, as opposed to the 1st time baking  peanut butter cookies(I know a writer doesn't like an actor changing the script).I used salted butter.And they were perfect.But I always go to yours 1st because your 1st on Google video&post.And I'm a southern living in nyc, and You just can't get food southern fare here.And you'r great at getting information concisely right. I'm making my 4th batch this afternoon.And I will send photo.+I don't like crunchy so I used plain, I would not change your recipe,I just like the taste of a perfect amount of salt .I look forward to enjoying more of you'r recipes.

I followed this recipe exactly and these cookies came out perfect! Not sure what other reviewers are talking about when they said they came out flat! I rolled into 1 inch balls and then rolled in sugar and GENTLY pressed with fork for the design. Don’t smash them down. I baked an extra minute or so to brown. They came out beautiful and delish!

I will definitely make them again. They are rich, soft, and delicious! I didn't let the dough sit in the fridge and still was impressed with the taste and consistency.

I followed the recipe with two adjustments:
- increased peanut butter by 1/2 cup
-increased flour by 1/2 cup
And for purely decorative reasons put a peanut on top. 

I'm rating it 4 of 5 because I suspect the cookies would have spread a lot had I not made these adjustments.

Very simple yet delicious recipe! I used the exact ingredients it says except I used salted butter and left out the 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I also refrigerated the dough about half as long and baked them at 350 for about 8-9 minutes because my oven tends to run hot. If I make these again, I think I'll go a little easy on the white sugar and/or add a little more peanut butter to bring out the peanut taste a bit more. I made these for a coworker's birthday and everyone at work loved them!

This is my go too recipe for peanut butter cookies. They are wonderful and always come out soft and stay soft.  I do make a few changes - I add 1/2 cup white sugar and a solid packed 1/2 cup brown sugar and increase the flour about 1/4 cup - the recipe calls for way too much sugar imho. When putting them on the baking sheet instead of pressing down with a fork, I push either an almond or peanut M&M into the cookie instead and bake. It's super easy, pretty and delicious!

Followed the others and added the additional 1/2 cup peanut butter and flour.  The vanilla was imperceptible so add if you wish or not. I kept mine in the refrigerator for an additional 30 minutes. Make sure you have room between the balls when you lay them down or else the cookies won't get to flatten enough. They are yummy.

Fantastic! These cookies were so easy to make! I followed the recipe word for word and I also followed the one user on here who suggested adding a little bit more of flour and peanut butter to keep the cookies from being too flat - worked like a charm on my first try. This was my first time trying these and making these  cookies and they taste great AND look great - I think next time though, I will add more peanut butter but honestly, it doesn't matter. These are the bomb!

Update: After making these a few times, I decided they were too sweet, and I wanted to taste the peanut butter more. So instead of 1 cup of sugar and brown sugar, I only used half a cup. SOOOOO much better!

OMGosh-- what a terrific cookie!! I did also increase the flour and peanut butter like alot of others said to do-- flavor fantastic and I rolled them in sugar and flattened them out- they do spread so watch your placement of the dough!! 7-8 mins in the oven!! They are crunchy and need a glass of milk to go with them!! Will make again!!

I made these cookies but I put them together in a pan to make bars instead and they took twice as long to cook. But they were still amazing and it made a decently sized batch of bars.

These cookies were great.   However I did use butter flavor Crisco instead of butter because that is my preference and it results in a much thicker cookie.   So if your first batch turned out flat, I suggest you give the butter flavor crisco a try.   

I did add chocolate chips, and that was also very tasty, but for purposes of this recipe review, my comments are only for the "cookie" portion.   

Next time around I might experiment with some TJ Speculoos Cookie butter as an addition (just for grins), but I think one can't go wrong with this recipe.

I am going to remind myself to never look at the comments for others opinions on the recipes when they rave about how great it is but proceed to tell you how they changed 90% of the ingredients and/or directions. 

The top comments were stating how they  critiqued it to "fix it". 
I followed the recipe and video instructions to a tee and mine came out just as it should. No flattening, no leaving out the fork patterns because it didn't work for others, didn't add to it or leave out. 
There is nothing wrong with the recipe, it's just probably user error, environmental differences, or your ingredients are expired!

Dynamite! I made the recipe exactly as written (creamy instead of crunchy peanut butter) and had absolutely no issues. Cooked them for 10 minutes at 375 and removed immediately to a wire rack. Hands down the best peanut butter cookies I've ever made!

I, like many others, increased flour and peanut butter by 1/2 cup and also included a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I rolled dough balls in sugar before placing on cookie sheet.  They cookies turned out perfect this way. They did come out of oven after ten minutes still a little soft with some slight browning around edges. When cooled, they did firm up nicely.  Perfection! The sugar I rolled the balls in were such a nice touch. I loved them!

Yummy, big moist cookies! I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1/2 cup peanut butter, 1/4 cup flour, and 1 tsp vanilla. I used smooth peanut butter only. I refrigerated for about 3 hours and rolled the dough into balls, dipped into sugar and did a very light cross cross press with a fork. Baked on 350 for 12 minutes (I tried 9 but they were not done). Even at 12 minutes they did not look done, but I could see some light brown around the corners so I took them out. After 15 minutes of sitting out, they were great. Even better the next day!

i have made this recipe a few time.  They are always a big hit.  I used the suggestion of adding 1/4 cup more peanut butter and 1./4 cup flour.  I also add a little vanilla.  i also under cook them a bit to make sure they are chewy.

I made these cookies exactly to the recipe with the exception of the crunchy peanut butter, I didn't have it so I used smooth. They came out exactly the way I like my peanut butter cookies, crisp on the edges, soft and chewy in the middle. Love this recipe, it will replace the one I have been using.

The Cookie Gods are happy tonight.  You know it has to be a good cookie recipe when you are want  to make them in the summertime. (We have a Hamilton Beach Countertop Oven that the hubby put outside for me. It holds standard size pans so my baking production is not slowed down. I  can still spoil all the kids and not heat up the house.)  Consider this option and handy tip for yourself.  :)

I agree with everyone else, this is a fantastic cookie. I added the extra 1/2 cup of flour, heaped my portion of peanut butter, added an extra egg and a good dousing of vanilla.  

Something else I did was barely mix it just until it was all moistened.   Dragging a butter knife through it gently and occasionaly scraping the sides and folding it in on itself.

Popped it in the freezer for about a half and hour and when I took it out I used two forks to simply lift our a generous tablespoon of the barely handled dough. When I fillled the baking tray, back into the freezer it went. I dipped the fork in sugar and gently presses the fork into the dough gently pushing the high spots and making the fork marks we all look for. :)

I think handling the cookie dough as little as possible will give you an incredible texture that will drive everyone nuts and only wanting more.  I baked them about 8 -10 minutes BTW just like everyone else.

Have a good one  --Jodi

not so good but it's probably my fault.  I used natural unsweetened peanut butter and the cookies were dull and dry.  I also had to use shortening instead of butter because I was out.  Don't make these substitutions and your cookies will probably be better than mine.

What an easy recipe to follow and they cookies turned out perfect even without reading the comments I altered it to 1/2 c. of butter and 1/2 c. of shortening.  I didn't have enough butter to make it and my butter was salted so no need to add the salt it called for. They turned out perfect with that.  They were thick and chewy and yes watch the 10 min and pull them out.  My oven cooks a little hot so this I know and adjusted to what I thought would work and like I said they came out perfect.  Couldn't be happier with this recipe and how easy it was to have perfect cookies for the kiddos.

These are great. Make sure the dough is thouroghly chilled before baking. If not, the cookies will burn on the bottoms before they are fully baked. I chilled overnight, but you would be find with a few hours. I baked at 350 for 7-8 minutes or so. I watched them to make sure they weren't burning. When you take them out of the oven they will be so soft that they seem mushy - falling apart. Just use a spatula to carefully place them on a cooling rack until they firm up as their temperature drops.

I followed the recipe but added 1/2 cup more of chunky peanut butter and added 2 tablespoons of ground flax seeds trying to sneak in some more goodness for my son and hubby. Lol. Very happy.. Crunchy outside and chewy inside.

This will be my go to recipe for peanut butter cookies in the future.  They are perfect!  We prefer cookies that are 3 bites or larger, making it worth the time to cook them.  These are 4 or more bites, soft in the center but slightly crunchy on the edges.  I set the oven for 10 minutes and finally, something that didn't need even a little adjusting!

These cookies are excellent and turn out every time! They taste like the cookies from my Hometown Bakery where I grew up! I always use salted butter then you can omit the 1/2 tsp. salt, and I add a tsp. of vanilla for added flavor to all my cookie recipes. Be sure to watch your cooking time as all oven temperatures vary. You can chill these if you want, but not necessary as I have done it both ways.

I followed the recipe except for inadvertently only used 3/4 cup of peanut butter. I let them chill in the frig for an hour and followed the advice of another reviewer and did not press them with a fork and they came out soft, moist and perfectly Thick in density. I also added a small amount of white chocolate chips in one batch as one reviewer suggested, they're super rich, but so good!! I will be saving this recipe.

I hate to say something negative about someones recipe but, after these baked, they tasted like a ball of flour.  I could not taste the Peanut Butter at all.  I added more PB to the next batch but no change.

I made them exactly as the recipe calls for. The only thing I did differently is start taking them out of the oven a little more quickly so they were a little softer and more moist. Still crunchy and delicious after about 7.5 minutes! Perfect!

Natual creamy peanut butter (the type that needs stirring and is runny) worked. Made 26 large cookies for me. For half the cookies I added 8-10 semi-sweet morsels on top after flattening them out.  For me I didn't need to add more flour as some have stated in their reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and they turned out slightly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.

Followed this recipe to the letter and they are pretty good.  I didn't use crunchy peanut butter since I only had smooth on hand.  They spread a lot so be sure to allow plenty of room for them to expand.  Putting the dough in the fridge for an hour sure make it easy to roll.  I was hoping for a bit fluffier cookie, but the flavour is sure there.  I'll use this one again.

The taste is phenomenal and they are delicate. I also tweaked the recipe. I added 1 teas. vanilla, 1 c more peanut butter and maybe 1/4 c more flour. At the end when it was a dough, I added by hand roasted non-salted peanuts and mini chocolate chips. I like that combination.

They melt in your mouth and are very peanuty. They didn't come out crisp as I like. Next time I'll press to make them thinner; still better than any store bought. Anyone have ideas on how to make them crispy? I did bake them longer but it didn't make a difference.

Oh. My. Goodness. I made these cookies a few days ago having never made peanut butter cookies ever before and found the recipe easy to understand and carry out, it barely needed any ingredients. It was obviously a little thick and difficult to stir and make into balls but was it ever worth it! A few changes- I added some chocolate chips and used creamy peanut butter. They looked and tasted unbelievable. It's impossible to have just one. Even family members who hate peanut butter and peanut things LOVED these. It made so many cookies too. I will be making these again. Thank you!!!

These are exactly how a peanut butter cookie should taste.  The flavor and texture is perfect.  I did use creamy peanut butter because that is what I had and what I always use.  I made recipe as written except I did add one teaspoon vanilla.  Thanks for the great recipe Shirley Sadler.

Very good classic PB cookie recipe. I would suggest though using a natural peanut butter without sugar and salt and use salted butter instead of sweet butter. If you can try to find a natural peanut butter with a strong flavor - some seem to stronger than others. When I first tried this recipe I wondered why it didn't taste like the cookies I had as a child and then I realized that all the sugar etc. in conventional PB products was masking the PB flavor. Using natural PB solved the problem.

Because it's what I had I used Peter Pan Honey Roasted chunky peanut butter and, because it's just the best, I used raw sugar in substitution for white sugar and sprinkled on top as well.  Holy. Cow.  Best peanut butter cookie I've ever eaten in my life!

Theses cookies were very good. They are super simple, and a nice treat on a casual day. I added a little vanilla, a yummy improvement. It is definitely worth trying! ;-)

I made this recipe but with an extra 1/4 c. of flour and 1/4 c. of peanut butter as others have suggested. While the flavor of the cookie was good, they turned out a bit crumbly and dry.

These came out delicious! 
I've never made peanut butter cookies before , the first batch I over cooked thinking that they would flatten out like other cookies, they don't! The criss cross on top is needed to push the doe down for cooking! 
I also added 1/2 a stick of butter extra (yum) ... Cinnamon and chocolate chips and macadamia nuts! They turned out amazing and dynamic!

Made a double batch of these today.  Very good recipe!  Followed other suggestions & increased the peanut butter (used 3 cups for double batch) & flour (used 6 cups).  Used salted butter & omitted the additional salt.  Baked at 350 for 9 min then took them out.  I kept the dough refrigerated between batches.  As you can see from my pic, I also threw in some choc chips in a few of the cookies.   I feel the secret to my successful peanut butter recipes is to use Jif.  In my opinion, that brand has the best fresh roasted peanut flavor that is hard to beat.  Thanks for the recipe, Shirley!  It's a keeper!

They are perfect with the extra 1/4 cup extra peanut butter, and the 1/2 cup extra flour. Golf ball sized dough balls rolled in sugar.  Bake 350 for 10-11 minutes.  CHEWY and MOIST. Outstanding!!!

After reading multiple reviews I decided to follow the others lead and add an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter and an extra 1/2 cup of flour. I also added a tsp of vanilla and used whole wheat flour instead of regular unbleached. They came out great, the whole family loved them :-)

I read the others comments and let the cookie dough rest in the fridge overnight. These cookies do like to travel all over the pan so I suggest rolling them into small balls or you will have HUGE cookies. I also had to keep them in the oven for about 15 min. I also jazzed them up with a chocolate drizzle with Heath bar bits! SO GOOD!

Well this is my 4th or 5th time in a month that I am making these cookies. :) :) Even though I live by myself, I have been sharing these with my family and neighbors! So I've ended up with only a dozen or so cookies myself. Thats O.K. This time I'm making cookies just for me and my neighbor. OH!! And each time I make them, I get 7 dozen peanut butter cookies. Lots to go round!! HAPPY BAKING!!    YUMMY!!   :) :)

I am an absolute failure at making cookies, even store-bought ones!  However, I had a renewed interest and tried a few recipes again, only to be disappointed over and over again.  Until now!!!  This will forever be my go-to recipe for cookies!  I did follow the other recommendations and added: 1/2 extra peanut butter (smooth), 1/4 cup flour, and 1 tsp vanilla.  These cookies had knock you over backwards peanut butter flavor and most importantly remained chewy after cooling (even the next day!...they didn't last longer than that)!  Phenomenal cookie!  Thank you, Shirley!  I can now confidently make cookies and even give them to others without embarrassment!

Am I the only one that wasn't completely impressed with these? I like them to be chewy, and thick! These ended up semi-thin, and not overly sweet, even having applied a few changes suggested by the other commenters. Not bad, but no one was wowed by them (myself included).

I only had time to read the last few reviews suggesting the cookies are great if you add 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup peanut butter more.  I did this, and added about a tsp vanilla.  I cooked for 9 mins at 350 on a pampered chef cookie sheet.  I substituted the white sugar (equal parts) with golden cane sugar and OMG.  These cookies, hands down, are the best peanut butter cookies I have had (and these are my favourite kind of cookie).  I didn't roll them into balls, I just dropped them by tsp on the cookie sheet and pressed a sugar-coated fork in a cross-cross.  Have added this recipe to my favourite box and will be my new standby cookie recipe!  (this recipe also makes a lot of cookies).  I took half of the recipe and rolled the dough into a log and put in the freezer for fresh cookies another time.

Love this recipe. After making this recipe a few times and reading a few reviews I made a simple change, I added a cup of quick oats, which thickened the dough a bit and gave the dough a bit more texture.

I made a small mistake with these cookies (poured the white sugar in with the dry ingredients instead of creaming it) and the cookies still came out PERFECT! I sprinkled some with cinnamon sugar and they were delicious. This will become a go-to recipe for me

I just made these they are FANTASTIC!! I too added a bit more peanut butter, and little more flour. I only had smooth peanut butter and salted butter so used those just cut down on salt I added. This recipe made 6 dozen for me? Will make again!

These are the best.On my second batch I substituted all chunky peanut butter for half chunky and 3/4 smooth. Seemed to turn out more peanut butter taste and chewy . However,  the original recipe is fantastic. My mom who is particular when it comes to cookies and things, loved them. For me thst is enough said. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I tried the recipe, and found it to be the BEST Pnut butter cookie I've ever had.  I followed the recipe, and the cookies came out flat, but did they ever taste good... almost like I'd made them with caramel.  Definitely will try them again.

These cookies were fantastic!  Turned out great the first time I tried them and they looked just like the picture.  Next time I am going to try adding another 1/2 cup of flour and peanut butter and cutting down on the white sugar.

This recipe was great! I cut the recipe in half because I wasn't needing so many cookies and still came out with about 20 cookies. Even though I cut all other ingredients down, I still used 1 cup of crunchy peanut butter and I rolled the cookies in sugar before baking. You have to let them cool down before eating them otherwise they will fall apart immediately. After letting them cool, they were all intact and tasted delicious! Quick and simple recipe.

I just made this recipe for the first time and I don't understand the comments about the cookies being like pancakes. Mine turned out a little thinner (1/4 inch) than my usual recipe but they tasted much better!

I was worried because I didn't have enough regular peanut butter and about 1/2 cup was all natural peanut butter which is much runnier and has less fillers.

The only tweak I made was that I used salted butter and omitted the salt. I never use unsalted butter when baking. I find everything tastes flat if I don't.  I will definitely make these again!

The quintessential peanut butter cookie! I did a half recipe, with only one stick of butter in the house. Also added chopped semi-sweet baking chocolate which was not really necessary. I skipped the recommended one hour of chilling time and used a ice cream/cookie scoop to portion out the cookie dough. It is fluffy and I only lightly pressed down with a fork to flatten somewhat  They are perfect!  Makes 2 dozen with the half recipe.

I made these as written, they are very good, wonderful cookies. I had absolutely no issues with them spreading weird or needing any change or addition to be wonderful, they have a delightful texture, and are nice looking cookies too-see my photo

These are awesome.  I did add 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and reduced the white flour by 1/4 cup.  I didn't get to bake them right away, but refrigerated them 1 day.  Definitely a keeper.

My husband went crazy over this recipe!  Like the other users, I added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 more of flour and 1/4 cup or so of peanut butter.  I also baked it at a lower temperature (350) for 10 minutes and they came out perfectly.   There are never any leftovers with this one!  I haven't tried pressing them in sugar like some of the other users before baking, so I may give it a try next time around!

I made a peanut free version.  I used Almond Butter by Jif because this has the same consistency as peanut butter.  our son has a peanut allergy and I wanted to try this recipe with the almond butter and the whole family loved them! The cookies lasted only a few days before they were all gone!

I made some and took to work at Home Depot they loved it. I had some problem at the end with the fork design getting sticky on the cookies so I got a cup with ice and put two forks to cool as one started worming up and sticking to the dough I used the one still in the ice cup. and rotated as needed my cookies came out looking beautiful. Making some more today for my co-workers.

I love these cookies, but made a couple changes.  I used creamy instead of crunchy peanut butter.  Also i found that if you let it refrigerate longer then the consistency is better and less runny and no need for more flour.  Also if you are feeling daring you can add chocolate chips and have almost a Reeses like cookie!! yum yum!!

These were just medium for me (could take it or leave it.) Tried to use the popular changes suggested on a second batch; the same outcome. Not enough peanut butter flavor, but what's new? I've been on the search for that very thing for years. Oh well will keep searching. Thanks anyway.

These were PHENOMENAL! The only change I made was rolling them into balls, then gently, forking them only a little bit flatter. This way when they baked, they didn't completely turn into peanut butter disks.

Not enough flour.  When you make this recipe, add an extra 1/2 cup of flour and bake for only 6-7 minutes.  Then let them cool for 15 minutes.  They will be soft and chewy that way, not crunchy.

Wow! Sounds like D.Finn made a heap of chocolate & peanut butter with this cookie holding it together!  I want some of those, too!  (will try next time) As far as this cookie goes, I love it's taste and so does everyone I've given them to - and I'm talking people that consider peanut butter cookies their favorite. Only deviation I made was to add 1t vanilla. Dough is very hard to scoop once it's chilled, and flattens out anyway - you can hardly see the fork marks.  So I just made the rest of them with room temp dough & lightly pressed with a fork dipped in fine salt. I leave them on the pan until they're cool enough to move to a rack after baking 10 minutes @ 350* in my gas (propane) oven. I experimented with a few cookies by putting chopped pretzel sticks on some and Kosher coarse salt on others, but they weren't better than the plain ones so I skipped that step for most of them.  Why tamper with perfection?? (Unless you can get them to stand up!!) Thank you for the recipe, Shirley!

VERY GOOD!!  I made these today but I did take others advice and increased the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cup, and the flour to 3 cups. I added 1 tsp of villina as well. I also baked them at 350. They were soft but do let them cool for several min befor removing them from the pan. Incase anyone care to know, you do not need to refrigerate for one hour. Do not over bake

I used creamy peanut butter and they were perfect! ALSO, instead of refrigerating the dough for an hour I rolled the dough balls, made my indentations and put them in the FREEZER for 15 minutes before baking..it worked like a charm! Just make sure that they are hard to the touch before you put them in the oven.

This is the exact cookie I ate as a child!  Crispy on the corners and soft in the middle.  Yum.  I followed the recipe, except used creamy NATURAL peanut butter and organic white whole wheat flour.  As always, I use natural peanut butter - despite the rumblings of my critics - and get an irresistible peanut buttery flavor out of this recipe.  Who needs all that/those nasty high fructose corn syrup, trans fat, additives and preservatives?  Not me, I can tell you that.  This recipe is a home run.

I am getting married in July, and I decided to make all the desserts for my Rehearsal dinner. I love, love, love peanut butter, and this recipe really seemed great! So I started making it all together and I decided about half way through I really wanted them to be "peanut buttery" So I added an extra half cup PB, and Peanut butter chips to it as well! Man....were they amazing! I brought them to my coworkers and they still can't stop talking about how great they tasted!! I can't wait to make them again!

There is too much of a buttery taste. With twice the butter as other recipes, too much fat & greasiness as well.

Cut the butter in half & add two teaspoons of vanilla extract to have a good recipe.

I've been meaning to review these for weeks now and am just finally getting around to doing so.  Since I came across this recipe i have made a couple hundred of them and they turn out amazing every time!  This is by far the best peanut butter cookie recipe I've had.  I followed the advice of other commenters and in my alterations of this recipe i upped the peanutbutter by an additional half cup, generously i might add, as well as increasing the flour by a generous 1/4 cup. and added a heaping teaspoon of pure vanilla extract, then dipped the balls halfway in sugar before baking.  this takes them from awesome to amazing.  i did note that with the increase in PB and flour, when you do to flatten them they do split a little on the edges, but that doesnt really bother me any. i bake them for only 9 minutes, NO MORE!  they will seem like they are undercooked, and will be too tender to lift and move to a rack, but let them sit a few minutes on the cookie sheet outside of the oven, then transfer when they're sollid enough.  they are so soft and moist.  and the times ive made this recipe i don't know how i managed it because this never happens, but it came out exactly to 3 dozen.  Mine only last a few days only because they get eaten so fast. i stick them in rows of 3 in foodsaver bags to ship in packs of a dozen to my loved ones, and they arrive perfectly intact and just as moist as when i baked them.  they loved them even a thousand miles away.  can't recommend this recipe enough!

This was a great cookie! The second time I made it, I added 1 1/2 cup of grounded up pumpkin seeds 1/2 cup of grounded flax seeds and 1/2 cf  of grouded oats instead of flour and instead of butter I used coconut oil. My kids loved them! To my suprise they tasted really good a little on the crumbly side maybe one more egg.....

I have tried so many recipe's for peanut butter cookies and this is the best recipe.I did not have to change a thing followed the recipe to the T.I have made these cookies so many times and they come out the same everytime.I have read some of the reviews and can't understand why they are having so much problems with this recipe.They either don't know how to bake or can't understand the recipe.The cookies came out nice and big and so good.I was told to follow the recipe and if they don't turn out the way you want them to then you can change the recipe to your liking.These cookies were so delicious thank you for this great recipe.

These were so good! I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and an additional 1/2 cup of peanut butter.  I forgot to chill the dough but they turned out very good anyway.  It was probably just a little harder to roll into balls.  I also dipped my fork in sugar before I flattened each cookie. I almost ate the whole batch my myself!

These cookies are fantastic however if you use margarine they are going to spread. If you over beat the butter and peanut butter they are going to spread. I made them using natural no sugar/ no salt added peanut butter and these were the best - not greasy and full of flavour. I use a potato masher to squish them - works great with a little oil on it.

Great recipe, it's a keeper.  I didn't have unsalted butter so used salted and used self rising flour omitting salt, soda, and baking powder.  I added 1 teaspoon vanilla, per comments and rolled in granulated sugar.  My husband, children and grands loved them!  I also baked for 10 minutes at 365 degrees.

I don't typically like peanut butter cookies but at my hubby's request I gave this recipe a try. I added a bit extra flour and peanut butter after reading some of the reviews, oh and a couple tsp of vanilla extract. Didn't have crunchy peanut butter, but creamy worked well. The dough smelled so good, and even with the fear of consuming raw egg, I had to taste it. It was delicious and I knew these cookies would be a hit. I also rolled the dough balls in sugar before placing on the cookie sheet and then used a fork to make the criss-cross pattern (which my husband said was important). They turned out so good! I've eaten three and am trying hard not to eat any more tonight. I can't say that I don't like peanut butter cookies anymore after trying this recipe! Yummy!

When I made these, discovered (too late of course!) that I didn't have any brown sugar...but...did have Splenda brown sugar...cut it down to 1/2 cup and the cookies are awesome!  I've converted many recipies using Splenda and Splenda brown...they come out just as well!  some are even better!!

I tried this recipe.  I did not add flour except to substitute the last 1/2 cup of regular white four with whole wheat flout.  Whole wheat flour has bulk to it and i was happy with the results.  I use a melon baller to serve up the cookie dough and then i use a large meat tenderizer mallet to flatten the cookie dough.  Leaves a waffle pattern and works great!    I like the cookies and would make them again

Perfect Cookies! Taste sooo good. I did as many reviews suggested and added extra flour and PB as well as a tad vanilla (I didn't measure). Cooked at 350 for 10 Min and they came out perfectly done.  For the lines in the cookies I dipped my fork in sugar so it wouldn't stick and pressed just enough to make the indentions.  (I used creamy PB).

These were wonderful cookies!  I did add about 1/2 cup of extra flour and about 1/2 extra peanut butter.  Also, you can add semisweet chocolate chips or peanut butter morsels for variation!

I have to say I'm not much of a baker, well at all really, but these were extremely easy! I read the reviews at the bottom and decided to moderate my ingredients as well by adding 1/2 cup of both flour and peanut butter.Furthermore I also substituted the 1/2 teaspoon of salt for a teaspoon of vanilla. For two reasons I too didn't have un-salted butter and I love vanilla! 
# When it's time to make the pattern, dip your fork in flour to make sure it doesn't stick.

I have used this recipe twice now. The cookies came out great, my family loved them! I did make a few changes. I used regular margarine or butter, and I didn't have brown sugar so I used 1 3/4 cup white sugar. I also added 1/2 cup more peanut butter and 1/2 cup more flour. They came out great both times with these changes!

loved these cookies, I made them this morning. I did however give it 4 instead of 5 stars because as other reviews said, I did add half a cup more peanut butter and flour, I also left it in the fridge overnight and they were awesome.
I will definitely make these again.

These were great as far as texture but the dough as mixed was too sticky. I added just under 1/4c. of flour and it was all right. These aren't as peanut buttery as I would have liked, but considering my daycare kids devoured them, I can't help but like them! :)

Fantastic cookies! I read the other reviews and added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter, and added a tablespoon of vanilla as well. 
For chocolate lovers, I always add SKOR bars crumbled on top of the cookies as soon as they come out of the oven. Try it, it's amazing!

Made 1/2 batch of these and added mini chocolate chips.  The kids loved them... so did I!  Will make these again, full batch next time! *note* I used organic PB, the kind that is just ground peanuts and sometimes it does not work with recipes calling for PB but worked well with these cookies.

Sweet, classic peanut butter cookies.... However, I had a major problem with how quickly these cookies burn!! I undercooked (almost  seven minutes, rather than the ten instructed) one batch and they turned out to be the only edible ones. I can't say that my husband or I were very happy about 40 minutes of prep and burned cookies!!!

Excellent.  Made exactly as written, except that I ran out of brown sugar, so used about 3/4 brown and 1/4 Demerara.  Also, only refrigerated dough 20 minutes before baking first tray.  I was out of time. Came out perfectly.

I tried adding 1/4 cup of flour and peanut butter as suggested, but my cookies came out sort of crumbly! Use caution when adding more flour

A great peanut butter cookie recipe, I did add 2 tsp of vanilla, and did not use crunchy peanut butter, just smooth.  Thanks for the post!

DELICIOUS. a bit sweet for me but I still thought it was a great recipe. moist, soft, and a bit crumbly all in one.  I also added 1/4 cup flour + 1/4 cup peanut butter. baked for 10 minutes at 350 F.  I left it on the baking sheet for 5 minutes after baking and watched as the cookies cooled into a beautiful golden color!

I will say that this is a great tasting cookie. I really like and the ingredients were all on hand to throw together. I ran a bit short on crunchy peanut butter so added a bit of creamy. I liked it just fine.
The difficulty I had was with the cooking time. I am sure it is due to my oven, my weather, my humidity in part but I ended up having to increase the time to 15 minutes in order to have a cookie that did not crumble in my hand. The first batch just dissolved but the added time on the subsequent batches made for a perfect cookie!

This is awesome- my new favorite cookie recipe!  I did do some adaptations after reading the other comments: I added about 1 tsp of vanilla and an additional 1/2 cup of peanut butter for more PB flavor.  I didn't need to add flour- the dough will be a bit gooey, but stick it in the fridge for about 20-30 minutes and it will be easier to handle (also refrigerate it between batches).  I also followed the tip of dipping the balls in granulated sugar and I'm not sure if it improves the cookies themselves, but it certainly makes the dough balls easier to handle.  Finally, I added chocolate chips to about half of mine and both ways were good but let's face it- everything's better with chocolate! :)

AWESOME cookies!  I used margarine and creamy peanut butter.  I also added the extra 1/4 c of flour and peanut butter that a lot of people suggested.  I chilled the dough for 20 mins or so, then used a cookie scoop instead of making balls.  I just left them instead of flattening them.  I really like how they came out this way.  YUM!

These were pretty tasty! I just added a splash of vanilla extract but otherwise followed exactly.   You really can't overcook these, even 1 minute longer and they're shot. I had to watch these so carefully but when I did, they turned out great!

These are very good cookies. As it seems many people have done, I increased the flour and the peanut butter. I use 2 3/4 cups whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter. I've also found that you definitely need to refrigerate the dough for at least the hour if you don't want them to spread out too much.

I made these cookies last night for dessert. I just had a taste for peanut butter cookies. I looked over a couple of recipes and reviews, I decided to try this one. Glad I did.. they were awesome!! I did add a teaspoon of vanilla flavor, creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy a 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter. I used salted butter, that is what I had on hand so I just used a pinch of salt instead of a 1/2 teaspoon. I also reduced oven temp to 350.

These are dangerously good. I use creamy natural peanut butter. Also, I usually use salted butter and omit the 1/2 tsp salt that the recipe calls for.

Basically good but bland.. suggestions? I followed reviews and added 1/4 c extra PB and flour each and tsp vanilla..  And dipped one side in sugar and criss crossed. Nice texture. I preferred 375 degrees to 350 so a little crispier on outside.. Took out@9min.

Make that cup of peanut butter a generous one, and don't press down too much, keep the cookies thick. I baked mine for 7 minutes st 350*.

Excellent recipe. I also increased the PB and the flour for a tighter cookie. I only had creamy on hand and I think the cookies Lacked texture without the nuts from the chunky. My bad, but they were still great.

We loved this recipe too! Thank you to the bakers! We used a Jiffy-type, creamy peanut butter and they were soooo good. They are delicate so they don't hold up super well, but that's ok bc they taste so good. We added kisses on top at Christmas time, but they are so good they don't need them!

WOW!!! I don't like peanut butter cookies, but I made these for my boyfriend, and I LOVED them (can't wait til he tries them!).  Sooo creamy!  Added a dash of coarse ground salt to the top of each one prior to baking to highlight the creaminess.  Friends at work are raving over these as well.  Will be making another batch on Monday.

This really is a classic recipe for peanut butter cookies. They are crunchy around the outside and soft in the middle. I used a half cup crunchy and a half cup creamy. I thought they had perfect peanut butter flavor.

I love this recipe, but also made a few tweaks. I used regular salted butter and creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy. I also used light and dark brown sugar instead of white sugar and added vanilla. The first time I made this recipe I forgot the baking powder and ended up with a chewier cookie. Both were really good. I also added peanut butter chips.

Peanut butter cookies are not my favorite, but they are my husband's favorite.  I made 2 batches of these cookies.  The first batch was exactly as the recipe stated.  My family loved them.  On the second batch, I replaced half of the sugar with Stevia and half of the all-purpose flour with wheat flour.  I also increased the peanut butter by 1/4 cup.  My family still had rave reviews.  Thank you, Shirley.

Awesome Cookies!!! I read the reviews and added 1/2c flour and 1tsp vanilla...they were great! Cookies were not as peanut buttery as I would have liked them to be, so I will add more next time around and less butter. Great recipe!

I made the recipe without changing anything except the cooking time.  I added 5 min because I prefer them on the crispy side.  Just keep a eye on their color.  They were the peanut butter cookie that I was hoping for and this will be my default from now on.

These were wonderful. Soft, full, and the whole family enjoyed them.
I didn't change anything, and I didn't have to. They were perfect. They did not come out think they puffed up when baked they shaped great. This is a cookie recipe I will be keeping for sure. It made well over 24 cookies with using more like 2 tbs drops. Its a must try

Just made these and they turned out great.  I increased the flour and peanut butter by 1/4 cup each, and decreased the sugars by 1/2 cup each and they were PLENTY sweet.  We rolled them in red and green sugar for Christmas.  Very yummy.

I added an extra 1/4 Cup of flour as well as peanut butter. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla, because I think it enhances the flavors, and I threw in some peanut butter chips for extra peanut butter flavor. I baked for 10 minutes for the first batch and then 9 minutes for the following batches. I refrigerated my dough overnight. They turned out fabulous.

Very good, my husband was requesting peanut butter cookies and I thought I would try these out.  They cam out excellent, I followed some of the suggestions (ie: added more flour, peanut butter and vanilla).  Really good, just had to increase cooking time to 13 minutes as we have an older oven :)

Good recipe! I split the recipe in half because I didn't need all of those cookies. They were very good and very peanut buttery without having to add any additional peanut butter. When I took the batter out of the refrigerator it was a little soft (and I left it in for the entire hour). More flour as other suggested is probably needed. Because the batter was too soft I couldn't put the criss cross paterns on them with the fork.

I had all the ingredients on hand, and made these with the 'help' of my 2 1/2 year old daughter. I reduced the white sugar by 1/2 cup, and replaced 1 cup of all-purpose flour with whole wheat and the cookies turned out great. But next time I will cook them for 8 minutes instead of 10 so they will retain a little bit more moisture.

made these last night. i took the advice of others and added 1/4 cup more each of flour and peanut butter. the cookies came out tasting very good. the reason i am only giving 4 stars however is because i was hoping the cookies would be softer once fully cooled. i was very careful not to overcook them. they arent crispy, but arent chewy. overall its a good cookie and i would make them again.

I followed what other people had suggested and added 1/4 cup peanutbutter and 1/4 cup flour. They came out great. Next time I will cut the sugar just a little as they tasted a bit too sweet.

I will call my own version Three Nut Cookies. I put in one egg to toughen it, after seeing that some people had problems with the dough. I added a TB of liquid hazelnut creamer and topped each cookie with chopped walnuts. Very good and the cookies are soft but don't break apart in your hand.

I followed great advice of others before me (increasing both flour and PB by 1/2C, and rolling the balls in sugar before making criss-cross patterns with a fork).  I added a large dollup of sour cream as I often do with recipes calling for brown sugar since something magical happens when the two come together.  I also increased the salt to a heaping tsp because I crave salty sweet.  Baking for 9min slightly browned rims but were chewy still - though I'm a mile high so adjust accordingly.  Enjoy!

I read the advice others offered about adding 1/2c. flour and peanut butter in addition to the given amounts and the cookies turned out perfect! I used creamy peanut butter and added whole lightly salted peanuts as well as chocolate chip cookies (not like they weren't perfect already, but why not?).

The cookie could use a stronger peanut butter taste, but it has a wonderful texture.  The outside is crunchy but when you bite into it, it is soft.  If you bake it longer, both inside and outside are crunchy and that's OK, too.  Will use this recipe again.

Very tasty peanut butter cookie. Like other reviewers, I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and 1/4 cup of peanut butter, but thought the batter still needed more flavor.  So, I cut up 10 Reese's peanut butter cups and folded into the batter. The final result, a soft peanut butter cookie with a little surprise (more intense chunks of flavor). Yum!

Super yummy!  I've been looking for a good peanut butter cookie recipe for a while.  I've tried a couple of other recipes from this site and wasn't too impressed.  These knocked it out of park.  I followed the exact recipe and like others have said, the cookies did turn out a little flat.  Next time I'm going to try adding extra peanut butter and flour to make them fluffier.

I really like this recipe and have used it several times.  I don't change a thing.  When I made the cookies today, I forgot to flatten the balls on one of cookie sheets.   They needed to cook another minute and when they were done, they turned out to be the moistest chewiest peanut butter cookies I've ever seen.

Made exactly per the instructions with the exception that I baked directly after mixing.  They are a bit crispy baked at 10 minutes - we prefered them baked 8 minutes.  I sprinkled about half with coarse sea salt before baking - yummy!  A very tasty cookie.

I used 1/2 cup more of peanut butter (Skippy Natural, Extra Crunchy) and flour.  The dough was very crumbly when I pressed with a fork.  The finished cookies were also very crumbly, which I do not prefer.  They do taste great, but overall, I think I will try a different recipe next time.

We thought these were just ok. They have some sort of funny smell and flavor. If I used this recipe again I would cut the baking soda down to 1tsp.

Yummy! Not healthy by any means b/c of the saturated fat and tons of sugar, but good not the less.

As many other reviewers, I have tried many peanut butter cookie recipes on this site.  This one is the best yet.  My husband loves peanut butter cookies so I make them just for him.  The only changes I made were of necessity.  I only had crunchy peanut butter and no peanuts so I used the crunchy and added no peanuts.  I also only had a limited time so I only chilled them for 1 hr 15 min.  My husband likes peanut butter chips for extra peanut butter flavor, so I added those as well.  Turned out AWESOME!

They were good, I added more peanut butter -- maybe 1/2 cup more and I also threw in a few bit of chocolate from a baking chocolate bar I had lying around. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla as suggested by the comments and rolled each ball in white sugar before putting on the cookie sheet -- be careful not to push down too much or to remove while still hot because the cookies will crumble!

I tweaked the recipe a bit but it definatly deserves a good rating! I used smooth peanutbutter instead (not a fan of crunchy cookies) I put a pinch more baking soda and powder in because the first few times I made them they came out very flat. Also, I had to watch them carefully it is only a minute or so and they will burn and get hard! I would start checking each batch at around 7-8 minutes to make sure they don't burn. But this is definatly a must easy yummy recipe.

I loved this recipe. Due to a dairy allergy in our family, I had to substitute butter with Earth Balance Vegan Buttery Sticks, but other than adding a smidge of vanilla, I did not make any other changes to the recipe.   I needed a slightly larger cookie, so I used my small cookie scoop to scoop out 2 balls of dough and then rolled them together to make 1 larger cookie. I was able to get 40 cookies out of this recipe at that size. I baked in the oven for 12 minutes, shut the oven off and let them sit another 5 mintues, then cooled them on the pan for 10 minutes and they were perfection. My daughter, who can't have dairy, loved them and kept asking for more!

Really good cookies. My grands are loving the dough. I made one change to the recipe and that was to use half crisco and half butter. This is just a personal preference of mine so that the cookies are soft.

loved this recipe! I did add per other suggestions an extra 1/4 cup of PB and flour and 1 tsp of vanilla. I only had reg PB but they were the best PB cooKies I have had. If you like your PB cookies to be softer just shorten the baking time and these will stay soft for days in an airtight container. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

One huge tip for these cookies **Wait to let the cookie cool completely on the cookie sheet before removing or else it'll crumble apart during the transfer**  I flatted with a fork the 1st batch and they came out FLAT so the 2nd time around I only rolled into a small ball, they came out with a wonderful shape and just right.  Everyone loved the taste, received many compliments, I also increased peanut butter and flour and added vanilla extract as recommended.

This cookie was pretty good. The peanut butter was a little overwhelming for me but the rest of the family enjoyed them. I decided to make cookie bars and baked the cookies in a circular tin. Then I cut them into bars. They were crispy on the edges and moist and chewy on the outside. Overall this recipe was good.

I tried the alteration that most suggested and still found them to be a little dry. I guess that's how they're suppose to be, because most peanut butter cookies are a little on the dry side. I save some of the left overs for one last pan where I added a tiny bit of milk and mini m&m's, they were good. I'll have to try that later and turn them into a drop cookie.

I used 1 1/2 cup crazy richard's (natural) chunky peanut butter, and 2 3/4 cup flour, leaving the rest of the recipe the same.  The cookies were delicious and got rave reviews from everyone.  This recipe is going to be a regular!  For me, this made 60 good sized cookies.

One secret to a great peanut butter cookie is not only vanilla extract - but to double the amount of vanilla extract.  For that reason, this one ain't it.

I followed the recipe exact, only making this with my older son. I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla, only because I do that with all my peanut butter cookies. I found the dough for these cookies to be a little.....fluffy, which worried me. I did chill the dough for an hour, but I don't think that was enough, to be honest. They didn't spread as much as I worried they would but....these just aren't the cookie I was hoping for, I guess. We like a more peanut-buttery, chewier cookie. This just wasn't for us. 375* for eight minutes. Not the recipe's fault. FYI: This makes a TON of cookies. And big ones, at that.

I added 1/4th cup more flour to this recipe after reading other comments. I must have made my cookies small because one batch yielded 5 dozen cookies, rather than 2 dozen. I left them in the oven for 10 min at 350. They were very yummy and chewy, but quite buttery- so I guess I'm glad that I made them smaller so that people could choose to eat a smaller quantity of them, though it's still difficult to do!

These were amazing! I didnt have any problems with the cookies being flat. They were chewy and delish. The only thing I changed was I didnt have baking powder so I used a little more soda.

Great recipe!  I too changed it a little and added 1 teaspoon vanilla, and an additional 1/4 peanut butter and 1/4 cup flour.  The result was a cookie that baked great and turned really chewy the next day.  Normally I like a more crispy cookie..but these are wonderful!

I only had bread flour, no brown sugar and no baking soda. I added more baking powder and only used white sugar.  Wished I had brown sugar......... The cookies came out really thick & good though!

Awesome!  This makes a very nice peabut butter cookie.  I used half butter and half shortening because it usually makes a better texture and it worked just fine - very peanut buttery.

The first time I made these cookies I wasn't being very precise in measurement and I had cut the recipe in half but accidentally threw in 2 eggs. I also added a little extra butter and some more peanut butter and vanilla and they came out amazing. Super chewy but crunchy around the edges and amazing in flavor. Unfortunately I stayed closer to the recipe the past two times and they came out kind of dry and bland.

YUMMY!  I added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter to the recipe but it really wasn't enough... so if you like that strong taste of peanut butter, I would recommend adding 2 cups, or maybe even more but other than that, this recipe is great... I can't wait to make these cookies again!

Very good! The cookies were soft, chewy, and very peanut-buttery. Extra flour is a must. I have a large jar of peanut butter at home and nobody wants to eat it because it does not contain hydrogenated fat and tastes too creamy. Now we have found a way to enjoy our healthy peanut butter. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I had a traumatic peanut butter incident as a child! My grandfather decided to make me peanut butter and jelly oatmeal... and my goodness the smell. The horrid horrid smell!!! So to make a long story short I did not eat peanut butter for approx. 15 years. So, for my husband being the big time peanut butter freak that he is... I decided to take one for the team and smell the hot peanut butter cookies as they baked in the oven...Boy was I surprised! These cookies were phenomenal! Soft... delicious... enough to make me forget about the pb&j oatmeal... Well almost ... :) Thank you so much!

PEFECTION!!  I made these cookies with Organic Peanut Butter and added 1/2 cup additional flour that was recommended by other reviewers and found the best cookie ever!  My family can't leave them alone.  I was worried about how they would turn out because of the different texture of organic natural peanut butter - but they were just right.  This is a keeper recipe!

Just as suggested I added the additional peanut butter and flour...I also added a tsp of vanilla and a 1/2 tsp of almond extract.  Popped them in for 9.5 minutes (in my gas oven) and BAM! Perfection! I also added a drop of grape jam to the tops of half of the batch before baking to make them PB&J cookies...yum yum!

Great recipe with the added changes as other people have suggested of 1/2 cup more flour and a teaspoon vanilla. I used creamy peanut butter. As an extra treat, I softened some vanilla ice cream and made ice cream sandwiches with some of these. Yum!!

I have a wonderful recipe my fiance's aunt gave me that makes absolutely wonderful PB cookies...I will submit it later... but the recipe got lost in boxes when we moved so I decided to try this one....The cookies were so good! my #2 fave PB cookies now. To me they tasted very similar to the ones you make from the frozen dough you buy from boy scouts and school fundraisers. so moist very delicious... I used extra crunchy peanut butter. Makes large cookies. They were so good they only lasted a half hour out of the oven with my fiance and brothers around!

Best peanut butter cookie recipe ever.  Ive tried 3 other recipes from this sight but this one exceeded all of them.  I did add 1/4 cup more flour and had to use half shortening since I only had half cup of butter on hand.  Thank you for the recipe, my whole family enjoyed these cookies immensely

These were pretty good. 10 minutes in my oven would have WAY burned them; I needed about 5-1/2 minutes so watch them closely. They were a little bland tasting, even after adding more peanut butter. Maybe next time I will try adding a little vanilla.

Firstly, these cookies did taste nice and they turned out soft.  BUT  they have way too much butter in them (and I am a butter LOVER), they fell apart and were too thin.  I have a lot of experience baking cookies so I took all of the usual "precautions" and still couldn't get them to work.  I left the dough in the fridge overnight to harden, and they still came out flat.  I then rolled them all into balls and put them in the freezer.  Still, after I froze them they still came out flat & it was really hard to get the design on the top to come out looking pretty.  These are definitely NOT "Classic" peanut butter cookies.  If I was to make these again, I would probably cut the butter in half and possibly add more PB/Flour.  ALSO: they made approx 50 cookies, not the 24 as stated & I made regular size cookies.

Followed the recipe as-is, with the addition of a splash of vanilla extract-- because I just can't bake cookies without it-- and I think the recipe is great!  I've always used my grandmother's recipe, but it got packed away and is now in storage, so I was not expecting to be blown away.  But, I was pleasantly surprised!  One note:  Do NOT overbake!  They will burn very easily.  My oven cooked them perfectly in 9 minutes.   Note that slight discrepancies might be a result of different qualities of peanut butter.   Standard peanut butter might yield a different texture and flavor than an "all natural" peanut butter.  Some peanut butters also contain more salt than others; so all these things should be considered when rating a recipe.  Overall, this  is a good recipe.  It will give you perfectly edible peanut butter cookies, which are really great with a tall glass of milk!

Excellent recipe.  I used 1/2 cup more flour, though I'm sure the 2 1/2 would have been fine, I'm just used to putting in around 3 cups for that size batch of cookies and did it out of habit.  Cookies came out very flavorful and fluffy, soft, and not over crumbly like some turn out.  Delish!

So I followed everything on here but the time to bake was not good at all the cookies turned out to be hard and the taste was kind of burnt we did not like them but it was something i did for sure! next time i will be doing them at a lower temp...also they need to be watched very good! Tip: if your husband does not know anything about baking dont ask him to keep an eye on them! They may just turn out with a black bottom if so LOL

these cookies were a hit for me.. i made them palm size and sold all of them at a function. I added almonds for crunch, the whole jar of smooth peanut butter, balled them and dipped them in granulated sugar before i flattened them out and pressed them out with a fork dipped in milk... yummo!

I tweeked this to be a "healthier" PB cookie. I did add a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I substituted white sugar with Splenda and regular brown sugar with Splenda brown sugar, natural PB, Whole wheat flour and no salt and I have to admit they are very addictive! Husband and daughter are begging to make more.

Was not impressed with theses cookies.  I followed the directions exactly and ended up with a light airy (almost cake-like) cookie, that was dry and crumbly.  After tasting the first batch, I followed the advice of other reviewers and added more peanut butter and flour to the remaining dough.  This gave it a slightly better flavor, but did nothing to improve the texture.  I am giving this 3 stars simply because my 2 year old did enjoy them.

My roommates loved them, I found them a little heavy.  I added an extra cup of peanut butter, and 1/4 extra cup of flour as people suggested and it turned out great.  I softened the butter in the microwave, that made things easier.

I just made these for my husband to take to work.  Fantastic!!  They were crisp on the outside and soft inside.  After reading some reviews I did up the pb to 1 1/4 C and the flour to 3 C.  Plus, I rolled the balls in sugar before doing the fork criss-cross thing.  They were GREAT!  nice job Shirley, thanks

I dumped the ingredients together and baked the dough immediately.  I didn't sift the dry ingredients or cream the butters with the sugars.  I didn't chill the dough.  The cookies were delicous.  Next time, I'll follow the directions.

These cookies are fabulous! Per other reviewers' recommendations, I increased the flour to 2 3/4 cups and peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups. I also used creamy instead of crunchy peanut butter to suit my family's tastes. The cookies came out beautifully - thick, soft and floury, not either crunchy or grease-moist like other recipes I've tried. They also didn't get crunchy around the edges after cooling, but stayed uniformly soft and chewy. I have made these several times, and they never last more than a day - my husband loves them! Thanks for a real keeper of a recipe!

We liked this recipe very much. I took the advice of user "JenniferC77" and added an additional 1/2c of peanut butter, and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Also added an additional 1/4c of flour. Boyfriend likes anything with peanut butter and chocolate, so made half batch with chocolate chips. Very yummy! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

perfect recipe! pull it out at 8 or 9 minutes if you like your cookies chewy, because they harden quickly after.

I baked two dozen of these following the directions last night and the remaining two dozen the tonight baking only 9 minutes. I am now enjoying an outstanding cookie where as last night's cookies were a complete disappointment. Chilling the dough overnight and reducing baking time by one minute made all the difference.

I took the advice and added 1/4 c extra PB and 1/4 c extra flour, couldnt be happier. I might try the 1/2 c next time, but these are still excellent.

I've made several versions of peanut butter cookies over the years, but these were by far the best.  Nice balance of crispy and soft.  I used 3 eggs instead of 2 1/2 and baked them for 12 minutes instead of 10.  They are our favorite family cookie.

Awesome, awesome cookies:  An alternative:  make homemade Peanut Butter Cup Cookies by making the cookies smaller, using a vanilla frosting between two cookies to sandwich them together.  Then cover the top with a melted semi-sweet baking chocolate.  Let cool.  They are considered the best cookies in the world at my fiance's university!

Wonderful recipe! I don't like my cookies too sweet so I cut the sugars down to 3/4 cup each. Perfect! The only challenge I run into is that my husband and I always want to eat the dough before it's baked. The timing is key: I overbaked once by about one minute and it made all the difference in a chewy cookie and a dry, crackery cookie. I will continue to make these again and again!

Everyone loves these!  They are the perfect sweetness, texture and have just the right amount of peanut butter, but you can add a bit if you like them extra peanut-buttery :)  This recipe is much better than the ones using shortening, they taste perfect!

I had just moved and did not have baking soda or powder when I made these but they still turned out delicious which is a true testament to the recipe. I added a drop of cinnamon extract and a drop of honey (I would take back the honey, though - it was too dark) to bring up the complexity just a bit. These cookies were top notch.

Excellent cookies.  I used 20% less sugar than suggested (otherwise it's too sweet).  I also added roasted skinned peanuts for extra crunch.  Will definitely remake this.

I made these cookies and I was so excited.  I added some chocolate chips and a bag of peanut butter chips.  What I also did was forget to put the eggs in.  I have to say, despite not having the eggs it was a pretty good cookie.  I'm going to make them again, but this time with the eggs :)

This is a good starter recipe. I took the suggestions and added 1/2c of flour and 1/2c of PB and they were very soft. I also added some Reeses peanut butter chips and baked for 9 mins at 375. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made these cookies and my family and co-workers loved them.  I added 1/2 cup more flour, 1/2 cup more peanut butter, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and also for something different added M&M's.  They were delicious.

These cookies came out great. However, I changed the recipie a little. I cut down on sugar - 3/4 brown, 1/2 white - to make them less sweet. As for flour, I used 1.5 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose for more fiber. I used creamy peanut butter as I didn't have the crunchy one and I added vanilla extract (1 tsp) as suggested by other reviewers. I love them this way - they're not that sweet and they're a little healthier! Thank you!

Very good recipe for Peanut Butter cookies with a good serving amount.  The dough in the fridge is a must.  You can add broken peanuts to regular peanut butter with good results.

OH. MY. HECK. No doubt the best peanut butter cookies I ever did eat! They kept real well and were soft even the next day. I did add about a fourth cup extra peanut butter but it could do without. It even made more than the two dozen it said it was! Although one thing that made it better was chocolate chips! Which I did after I made half the cookies.

This is a great cookie recipe, 5 stars. The only thing I did differently was I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored shortening (Crisco). I do that a lot with my cookie recipes. It makes a BIG difference I think,the texture is out of this world. It just melts in your mouth. Also my cookies only needed about 8 minutes. But this is by far the best peanut butter cookie recipe yet!!!

Great tasting dough, we also were lucky that any got cooked.  I used Peter Pan Honey Roasted Crunchy.  Also added 1tsp of vanilla.  I like them fresh baked but friends I gave some to a week later said they were fantastic.  I did not increase flour or peanut butter, just put them in the fridge for a while.  I don't roll mine into balls, instead used the medium sized PC scoop, they baked up almost perfectly round, very nice.

Hands down, best tasting cookie dough ever! My family was lucky there was enough dough left to bake! I did use 1/2C. extra peanut butter and flour as some suggested and, my son demanded 1C. semi-sweet chocolate chips.  After about 30 minutes in the frig and 10 minutes in the oven, my cookies came out bite sized and fantastic. Everybody loved them; 5 dozen gone in two days. Thanks for a new family favorite

I didn't have baking powder so I omitted it.  I put 2/3 cup of butter instead.  And I followed some reviewers comments to bake at 350 for exactly 9 minutes. They turned out great!

I loved these! I did add 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/4 cup extra flour and peanut butter. I also rolled the dough balls in sugar before I forked them! I didn't have unsalted butter at home so I cut out the salt and used a little less baking soda and a little more baking powder. They were excellent.

This cookies were DELICIOUS! I'm not even crazy about peanut butter, but these were fantastic! Just the perfect combination! I did listen to the advice of others, and add a few alterations. I added an additional 1/2 cup of peanut butter, 1/2 cup of flour, and 1 tsp. of pure vanilla extract. I also added a medium sized bag of M&Ms! Mmmmmmmmm! These were amazing!

I added the extra flour and peanut butter, and they came out perfect. They had great line from the fork, the right amount of crunchy edges and chewy center. I also got created and rolled some out and used a squirrel cookie cutter dragging a fork over the tail section to make it look like fur. They were really cute but all crunchy, which was okay by me. Loved this so much!

This is THE best Peanut Butter cookie recipe!!! I did as other suggested and used an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter & 1/2 cup extra of flour, plus 1 tsp vanilla.  SO good... TOO good... I can't stop eating them, and I usually have enough after one cookie. Will definitely make these again... my kids, husband and daycare kids all enjoyed these.  Thank you for an amazing recipe!

These are fantastic!! I made a batch for my family and they loved them. Be sure to not overcook them, I found that the ten minutes was perfect and gave them a crispy outside and a softer center. Also make sure you chill the dough a bit. I too added some extra flour and peanut butter (about 1/4 cup of each) and rolled the balls in sugar before pressing them with a fork. Super rich and tasty!

Well this was a good base. I would make again but with my changes...I made as stated for 9 cookies but they were too crumbly for me and not peanut buttery enough. I added a 1/2 c peanut butter (used organic chunky), 1/2 cup flour, 1/4 c sugar, and another 1/3 stick butter. I did chill too. I also baked at 350 for 13 min on an airbake sheet (longer then a normal cookie sheet) Perfection! Made a lot- might cut in half next time- made 50 good size cookies (I did add to the mix). oops I added a capful of vanilla too!

Although, I decided to make a few tweaks to this recipe, it gave me the basis to create a great peanut butter cookie!  I added 1 extra egg and a sprinkle of water because I did not like how dry the batter was.  I eliminated the baking soda.  If I had more peanut butter I would have probably added that before anything else.  And I would suggest to add another half cup of peanut butter AT LEAST.  Baked at 375 for 10 minutes!  They stayed soft!

Perfect! Excellent texture and peanutty flavor. I used smooth peanut butter (and a little more than recipe calls for). Also, since I had salted butter on hand, I simply omitted the salt. Added a bag of chocolate chips--yummy. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It's a keeper.

Excellent! I added the peanut butter using a 1/4C measuring cup, and made sure they were heaping quarter-cups. I also added an additional heaping quarter-cup. I didn't add any flour. (I was out of all-purpose, so I used cake flour and it worked just fine.) I baked them at 350 for exactly 10 minutes, without refigerating the dough, and they turned out just fine. They didn't seem 'done' when I took them out, but I let them sit for 10 minutes and they firmed up perfectly. Wonderful recipe!

I didn't have no-salt butter as the recipe says, so I used the regular and they were a bit salty.  I added chocolate chips to the rest of the batter after I tasted the first batch and it made them taste really good as the chocolate went well with the extra salt.  I rated these cookies a 5 star because if I would have made them with no salt butter, I wouldn't of had to add the chocolate chips.

This Recipe is very good. I took the advice of other reviews and added 1/4 C. more flour and 1/4 C. more peanut butter. I used salted butter and left out the 1/2 tsp. of salt and used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy. I also added a couple handfuls of cinnamon chips adn they turned out delicious

Classic is correct - these were perfect.  I did take the suggestions of others and use 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter and 2 3/4 cups AP flour.  I also added about 3/4 tsp. vanilla.

absolutely no need to add flour, just chill the dough properly and the cookies stay moist and thick.  I did find that 350 for 9 min was just right. added 1/2 tsp. vanilla.

excellent cookies. I found that they were overcooked at 10 minutes, 8.5 was perfect.  I live at 800 feet above sea level, if that matters.

This is a great peanut butter cookie. I took the advice of others and increased the peanut butter and flower 1/2c each and added vanilla. I also added a bag of peanut butter chips. My family loved them.

I loved this recipe it was simple and yeilded delectable cookies. Just a couple tips, I like my cookies soft and moist in the inside but these cookies are actually better stiff. Otherwise the cookies don't taste like cookies but more like a spoonful of peanut butter. Also I baked them for 10 minutes on 350 F.I also rolled the balled dough in granulated sugar before pressing them down with a fork on the baking sheet.this kept them from sticking to the cookie sheet and gave them a more delicate texture in the end.

My family loves this recipe, they ask me to make it all the time. I did not refrigerate the cookies because I heard that it makes it to hard, and my family LOVES soft cookies. I also added a some vanilla and extra peanut butter. Also I cooked the cookies for six to eight minutes. Instead of one cup of regular sugar and one cup of brown sugar I did 3/4 cup of regular sugar and 1 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I have been making this recipe for over a year now. I recommend this recipe to everyone!

This is an excellent recipe. I used Peter Pan Honey Roast Crunchy Peanut butter and rolled the dough in granulated sugar before flattening them wiht a fork. The result was the perfect crispy, chewy PB cookie. Thanks for the perfect recipe!

Although the taste was ok the texture was rubbish! They were so cakey. Too much flour in my opinion! I did add coconut and that really brought them out. They were just too hard, crunchy and cakey.

I can't stop Eatin' Em they are that good! I did read the other reviews and made the following changes. I added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter, changed half the butter to veg. shortening, added one teaspoon of vanilla, changed half the flour to whole wheat flour, used baking splenda instead of the white sugar and added one bag of milk chocolate chips. I than refrigrated the dough for 1 hour. I used a 1/4 measuring cup as a mold and press them a little with a fork. I bake them on parchment paper for 10 min and let them cool on the sheet for 5 more before placing on cooling rack. I was swatting my kids away after the first one. They had no idea of the healthy changes made to the recipe. They were soft, big and yummy!What can I say I like a big cookie with my coffee.

This is a great recipe! Thanks. I chilled my cookie dough only 30 minutes due to anxiety, I couldn't wait to bake them. Exactly 10 minutes as a previous reviewer stated...these are perfect! I made them with choc. chips and with M&M's and Plain...great no matter what. I definately enjoy them as is with no chips or anything the best! Thanks again!

This is a great recipe! I added a cup of chopped dry roasted nuts.  I also used 1/2 cooking margerine and 1/2 real butter.  I rolled some of them in plain sugar and some in cinnamon and sugar.  They were a hit either way.  Thanks!!

Instead of adding salt, i just used regular salted butter. I like peanut butter cookies when using butter instead of shortning. Their not so hard. I hate a hard cookie! lol  very good.

I just made these cookies.  And like other reviewers said, I added more peanut butter and more flour (1/2 cup extra of each).  While the flavor is amazing, the consistency is a little off.  My cookies are a little crumbly and chewy.  Didn't know that could happen, hahaha.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.

WOW! I made these for my bible study group and everyone couldn't get over how amazing the cookies were. I added oats to mine, and dipped the tops in sugar before pressing them with a fork. Like some others have said, they really don't look done when they are, in fact they seem downright uncooked but they harden up a good deal as they cool. But they're still perfectly chewy and moist! I'm going to use this recipe over and over, I'll just have to triple it next time!

YUMMY!!!  These were so quick and easy to make.  I prepared the dough which didn't take long at all.  My 4 children couldn't wait the hour for dough to refrigerate so I made them in half hour.  They were delicious and gone sooner than the time they took to cook...lol.

I have always strayed away from pb cookies because as a kid I could never get the recipe just right.  14 years later I try again, with success!  All I did differently was add a small amount of vanilla and rolled the 1 in. balls in sugar before pressing with a fork.  I divided the dough in half and added mini chocolate chips to one batch and kept one as is.  Baked for about 12 minutes.  Fantastic!

This is a easy recipe, with amazing results. I get special request to bring the peanut butter cookies to things. That to me means it deserves 5 stars!!! Only thing I do different is press my cookies down with a fork, when they are hot out of the oven and then sprinkle the hot cookies with sugar.

I've never been a peanut butter cookie fan, but my Sweetie is.  I decided to do something nice and make some just for him.  This recipe is SOOO good.  Reading other reviews I kind of sloppily measured the peanut butter and flour (a little more of each) and did add vanilla.  I've been told by my husband and my two neighbors who covet peanut butter cookies, that these are the best they've ever had.  I even like them.  I've made them twice this week and will probably continue to do so on a regular basis.  These really are very good.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. I took advice from a few other reviews and added 1/4 C more peanut butter, 1/4 C more flour, and vanilla. Best cookies that I've ever had!! I've had nothing but raving compliments and requests for the recipe :)

These were great!  The first time i made peanut butter cookies.  Unfortunatley - I ate them all myself so much for my diet.  A personal tip - add a box of vanilla pudding mix to the batter to keep the cookies soft forever!

A GREAT recipe.  I did add the extra 1/4c peanut butter and 1/4c flour.  I purchased the creamy peanut butter by mistake, but had salted peanuts(1/2 cup) at home and put them in a mini chopper, then added them. I also made the balls slightly larger...YUMMY!!!

I did increase the flour and peanut butter as instructed by several other reviewers and the cookies were crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Perfect! Brought these to a party and everyone loved them!

Great recipe!  I added 1/4 cup of peanut butter and a 1/4 cup of flour to the recipe on suggestion of a few other users.  I also added a bit of cinnamon, as I do to most of my recipes.  I baked my cookies for 9 minutes, and they were just the perfect golden color on the bottom and just barely around the edges.  It's a great dough, and a smooth cookie, but it just crumbles and melts in your mouth.  Thanks for the deeeelicious recipe!

These are exactly like the peanut butter cookies that I always make, except for these changes:
3 cups flour (not 2 1/2 cup)
1/2 cup of butter and 1 1/2 cup peanut butter - it does make them more crumbly, but it gives them a wonderful peanut butter flavor.
 This recipe makes DELICIOUS peanut butter cookies!
(can add chocolate chips, if desired)

I had mislaid my mum's recipe, and this one was an exact match. Great flavor and best if pulled out just before done.  I use the Crisco butter sticks instead of butter and it seems to be better.

Awesome awesome awesome! I love these so much and everyone I make them for has fallen in love with them. They taste better than any store bought peanut butter cookies I've ever had. Each time I make it I add some thing new, whether its tiny m&ms, or semi-sweet chocolate/white chocolate chips. I love this recipe!
*Thanks for posting it*

Very good!  I also added the extra 1/2 c of both peanut butter and flour and the vanilla.  Just when I thought they couldn't get any better, I added chocolate chips the next night to the remaining dough.  Yum!  I didn't need to refridgerate the dough before forming the balls.  I also rolled them in sugar.  All in all, two thumbs up!

Very good recipe. I cut the all purpose flour in order to use some whole wheat flour -- 1.5 cups whole wheat and 1 cup all purpose flour. And, I used cashew butter instead of peanut butter...so, I guess, they're really not peanut butter cookies afterall...cashew butter cookies...they turned out great! My 4 year old loves them!

these spread out A LOT. i don't think an hour to refrigerate them is enough because the last batch came out way better than the first. i would probably just refrigerate it overnight and bake them the next day, instead. other than that, they're delicious. i used all-natural peanut butter, which gave them an awesome peanut butter taste. i didn't pack the brown sugar that much because one cup is a bit much. i lightly packed it into my measuring cup. good cookies, overall.

awesome peanut butter cookies, soft and chewy.  i used creamy peanut butter because i'm not a big fan of little crunchy bits in my pb cookies.  2 tips however.  the dough is very sticky, so it's a good idea to dip your fork in some flour before pressing them down for the "classic pb cookie" markings.  also, depending on your oven it's wise to watch the browning around the 8-9 minute mark on the timer.  in my oven, 9 1/2 minutes made for the perfect;y browned cookie

Great recipe! I used reduced fat creamy peanut butter instead and only had salted butter so skipped on adding the salt. Like others I added some sugared sprinkles on top of some and for something different used pumpkin pie spice on top of others. Delicious, thank you!

Amazing cookies! Very soft, even next day! I used natural smooth peanut butter and it gave it a great flavor! Per other reviewers, I also increased the flour and peanut butter a bit and only cooked it for 8 minutes at 375. I was amazed at how good they turned out!

Really great. I made most of the changes as per other reviewers, but I usually add my own touches to baked items. I know this makes it your own recipe, really, but this site always had great starter recipes. I love a soft cookie, so I baked at 350 for 7-8 minutes and they stayed soft and yummy!!

I made several batches of these and took the leftovers to work about 3 days after I made them and people raved about how good they were and they were still soft--I kept them in ziploc bags.  My husband asked me to make more tonight so we can give them to the firemen at our neighborhood fire station--wink wink.

These have to be the best cookies ever! I made them with regular peanut butter and didnt refrigerate the dough, rolled the balls in white sugar and pressed it down with the fork like the recipe says...rolling the dough in sugar really makes the cookie...i already ate the first batch, so now im on my second!

This was an amazing Peanut Butter Cookie recipe!  My dad is a huge fanatic when it comes to his PB cookies and these were a huge hit since they stayed chewey for days after baking.
I did take the advice of a few reviews and increased the flour, decreased the baking temp & time, and I also rolled the cookies in white sugar before placing on the sheet to keep them from spreading too much.

All in all, a definite keeper!

Great cookies, minor alterations.  I added 1/4c. extra flour and 1/4c. extra peanut butter and 1/4 tsp vanilla. Rolled the cookies in white sugar before putting on baking sheet for extra appeal.  I like my cookies soft, so I baked them at 350 for 8 min.  YUMMY!  Follow this and you will LOVE EM!

These were good.  I didn't refrigerate as outlined as I didn't have time and they still came out good.  I also did not increase peanut butter or flour and the cookies were not flat.  I will make these again.  I think I will roll in sugar next time I make them.

Nothing but rave reviews from family and friends on this recipe. I would have rated this cookie recipe with five stars but I had to add flour, vanilla extract and peanut butter as others suggested. I will be making these cookies for Christmas, that is how much these cookies are loved!

this is a terrific cookie.  I make them for bake sales and they go fast.  Don't try to substitute with regular butter.  They just don't come out right.  The crunchy peanut butter just makes them terrific, although I have used creamy and they are good.  Great recipe!

After a few cookie recipe disappoinments I was pleased when this one worked!  I added the extra 1/2 cup of flour and peanut butter as suggested by other readers - and it worked perfectly, I also dipped the cooled cookies in melted milk chocolate - so good!

I made these tonight to use for snack time for a preschool class I'm teaching tomorrow. It was a good recipe, but wasn't peanut buttery enough for me. I used margarine instead of butter. I added an extra cup of peanut butter, an extra cup of white sugar, about a 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla, a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, and an extra 1/2 cup of flour. It probably still could have used a little more vanilla but I ran out. It was a little oily, so I added a cup of oats to help soak up the oil. That gave it a nice texture. I rolled it in sugar and chopped semisweet chocolate and flattened it with a potato masher. I have a gas oven that tends to cook more quickly than others and I baked the cookies at 350 F for about 7 minutes each, and then allowed them to cool for about 10 minutes before removing them from the pan. I formed 2 inch balls and got 21 cookies. They are yummy, though like I said, I think they could have used a little more vanilla. Next time I think I will make the cookies a little smaller than an inch as the 2 inch ones ended up being too much cookie for me, but they are very very good.

I found this recipe very very greasy- we made a half batch and it was literally swimming in oil. I have never added butter along side peanut butter, its just too much oil! If I made these again I would consider adding more flour and not adding the butter.

These cookies are great!  I added a teaspoon of vanilla. Then I accidently used the measurement for the baking soda for the baking powder.  Even with my mistake, they still were delicious!  I also used a sugar coated glass bottom to flatten the cookies instead of the fork.  This recipe is a keeper!

Great basic recipe!. I added a few things to call it my own. 1 teaspoon vanilla, ran out of chunky peanut butter and regular butter, so I added a 1/2 cup of dry roasted unsalted peanuts I had and margarine. I normally do not substitute margarine for butter..But in a pinch to brighten up my husbands day he tells me I "can make these any time!"

Works for me! It was a hit!

Thank you!

***Update: Made these again as the recipe states. I added a little more peanutbutter and a little more flour as many reviews suggested. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. They were so good that when my boyfriend took them to work his boss offered to buy a dozen more. Now that's a good Classic Peanut Butter Cookie! ***

Original review: I made these cookies tonight and it was a complete failure. But that was due to my own stupidity rather than the recipe. 

I ended up using NO brown sugar at all, so I cut the recipe in half. The result was a very crumbly cookie with a slightly saltier flavor than a normal cookie. The cookies were SUPER crumbly. I thought maybe it was because peanut butter adds extra fat, thus extra crumblyness. Also my second batch (I didn't know about the sugar until a few minutes ago) I made smaller.... and they totally burned even though I put them on for a minute less. 

However despite all the craziness in the kitchen tonight, the unburnt cookies STILL turned out tasty and no one complained, or even noticed after they set for a while. So I gave them five stars.

I ran out of white sugar, so I doubled the brown sugar.  I added 1/2 a tsp. of vanilla, 4 extra Tbsp. of PB, and a 1/4 tsp. of ground cinnamon.  Also, I used creamy PB instead of crunchy.  Perfect!

These cookies came out perfectly with the addition of a tbs of vanilla extract.  Dense, chewy, and flavorful...I used JIF creamy peanut butter, sprinkled them with course sugar and baked them just until the tops were dry.  Thank you for this simple, tasty cookie recipe!

I find this recipe to be a bit mild for my taste. For a stronger peanut butter taste, double the salt. To get the right consistency, sift 2c of flour and the rest of the dry ingredients into the bowl and integrate as normal. Add the last half cup 1/6 (or so) at a time. Stop when the dough balls around the mixer blade/spoon and pull away from the sides of the bowl. I usually wind up using about 2 1/4 cups of flour.

Too much sugar for my liking. Based on previous experience, I usually have to cut the sugar down by at least a 1/3. And I prefer my cookies crunchier, so I left it in the oven longer.

These were not a family faveorite. In a household were a batch of cookies hardly lasts a day these are still here after 3 days. I don't know if I pressed the cookies down to hard with a fork but, they are very crumbly/ a lot of them broke. I put the dough the fridge for the time stated and the dough was hard to work with it seemed very dry, The consistancy prior to putting into the fridge was better. I followed the recipe exactly except I only had smooth peanut butter instead of crunchy. I don't know what I did wrong. I will search for another recipe.

YUM!  I read through so many of the peanut butter cookie recipes and I am glad I chose this one.  I doubled the recipe and it made 10 dozen cookies!  I used one whole jar (16.3 oz) of creamy peanut butter.  Out of 5 cups of flour, I used one cup of whole wheat and it is not noticeable in the taste or texture. My freezer is now full of cookies for school lunches.

I read the previous reviews and added 1/4 cup extra peanut butter. Cookies turned out very moist and didn't flatten out at all - but I did turn the temp up to 200C.

These cookies were ok.  I did follow the recipe and my cookies turned out crispy and as flat as silver dollar pancakes.  Although, I did notice after the fact that the dough should have been refrigerated for an hour before baking...would that have made a difference?

Great peanut butter cookie recipe!  I used a little more peanut butter (organic crunchy) and flattened them with a glass dipped in sugar.  Yummy!

They were very good, not as soft as I thought they'd turn out, my husband loved them though, I found doing what they asked to do with the fork makes them very thin and hence they turn out a bit crispy.  So I flattened the next batch with my fingers, they were a bit thicker and tastier.  They tasted really light, I will make again.

This is the best peanut butter cookie recipe i've tried out so far.  I didn't have crunchy peanut butter on hand, so I used creamy, and it makes the cookie perfect.  i finished backing about three minutes ago and I've already eaten four cookies!

I've been using the same peanut butter cookie recipe for 20 years and decided to try something new with this one.  I was very disappointed.  The presentation and consistency was good but the taste was not.  Very little peanut butter taste to these cookies but if you really LOVE butter than these are for you.

they were really easy to make, but i overcooked them.. but it was probably my fault , next time ill bake for 8 minutes instead of 10, our oven is very hot. they taste really good but just alittle dry and could use a bit more peanut butter. all in all, they were very soft and filled my craving! thanks for the recipe:)

Lack of peanutty taste...I used 1/4 c. more PB(creamy) & wasn't enuff still.  I didn't have time to wait(sweet tooth & it's late)to refig. for an hour, then roll into balls.  They went straight to pan from spoon and flattened with a fork dipped in sugar. Bake 8 min.! unless u like crunchy.Would make again if absolutely had to. Afterall, it hit the sweet spot for me tonight!      *After letting the cookies sit overnight, the flavor was much better & more PB taste came thru...upgrade to 4 1/2 stars.

My first batch turned out a little more crunchy than I like but they were still a hit from kids to adults. The second batch I made I substituted 3/4 cup honey for the 1 cup of sugar and baked them for about 15 min at 350. The dough isn't as firm so they are more of a drop cookie but they turned out fantastic.

I used salted butter & creamy peanut butter, baked them at 350 for 8 minutes and they were YUMMY! I baked my first batch on 375 for 9 minutes and they were too dry & crunchy but my second batch was soft & buttery & delicious.  I took them to work & they were gone in no time. I'll make these again soon!

It was quite nice, however i used 2 cups of flour, 1 1/4 PB and i used my hands to roll it into a ball, pressed it down with a fork. However, while mixing everything up together it was very crumbly. I halfed the recipe but used 2 eggs. It turned out pretty well. Peace xD

i made these cookies with a lot of hope, especially since the recipe was rated as a 5 star and everyone raved about it.  the cookies came out for me as they did for some other users- crumbly without much substance.  i followed the directions, adding 1/2c more peanut butter, and they still came out very dry.  i made one test batch of cookies, and most of them crumbled coming off the baking stone, even after cooling.  i just put the rest of the dough in a 13 x 9 to see if they make better peanut butter bars.

I used whole wheat flour, splenda, natural (chunky)peanut butter and didn't add salt. I like softer cookies so I cooked for 8.5 minutes instead of 10. Recipe is great; one of my favorites. Thanks!

Very good.  Very easy to make, I used creamy peanut butter though.  I wanted a chewier cookie, that's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.  I think I probably would try another recipe next time.

I didn't change anything on this recipe. If you roll them, put them on the cookie sheet then use a fork to flatten them they come out perfect! I've made them several times.

Yummy! I used extra crunchy JIF peanut butter and cut down the salt in half. Totally necessary if you're using salted peanut butter. Mm, next time I might try some chocolate chips too!

This was a very good peanut butter cookie.  I have had better only once and I never got the recipe!  So I've been searching for my favorite peanut butter cookie.  I would definately try this one again.  The kids and friends loved them.  I froze half of the batch for a later date.  I changed the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups as did others.  That worked out very well.  I also used 100% whole wheat flour instead of white as I do with all my baked goods. Finally, I cut the white sugar by 1/4 cup, this always goes unnoticed.

Best Peanut Butter Cookie I ever made.  Was very surprised by the size of the cookie, much larger than I expected.   
I now add 2 cups chocolate chips to the mixture.  Superb !

Super PB cookie.  I added about 1/2 a cup of white choc chips and 1/2 cup of PB Chips.  YUM!!!  I am no PB cookie conniseur, but I loved it. I also added about 1/4 cup of extra PB and added some extra flour at the end to make the dough a little drier and less sticky.  It was probably a total of about 1/4 c. of extra flour.  ENJOY THIS EXCELLENT COOKIE

Absolutely delicious!  I even, uh, forgot to add the baking soda and they still turned out great! Actually, I think that helped me - I live at about 5000 feet so things tend to rise too fast and then dry out...but forgetting baking soda altogether isn't a typical high-altitude adjustment.  Yumm...I think I'm going to wander into the kitchen and have another!

These were pretty good - a little dry, though.  Not sure how to remedy that, as I am more of a 'cooker' than a 'baker'!  Maybe more PB?  Dropped some Skor bits on top to give them an extra flavour.

These cookies were good, not THE BEST EVER, but very good.  Following the advice of others, I added 1/2 cup more of peanut butter and flower.  I don't know how the addition of these ingredients helped or hurt these cookies.

Very good, but a little dry, will bea dding 1/2 cup extra peanut butter and then I'm sure it'll be delicious. Thanks for a good recipe. Also, I only needed to cook mine 8 mintues or else they would have burned.

these tasted pretty ok though they spread out quite a bit so i ended up with a very flat cookie, i did not like that too much. i ended up using a 1/2 cup more peanut butter as people suggested and it seemed to be a good amount.
not my very favorite but i've noticed that a lot of peanut butter cookie recipes are so similar that they all taste  pretty much the same.

I made these cookies last year for Christmas.  They were both soft and crispy and were full of peanut butter taste; they reminded me of the peanut butter cookies I loved as a child.  My husband, son and I finished them in a matter of days.  Absolutely terrific!

I  was in a baking mood last evening but was out of chocolate chips for my favorite cookies. So, who doesn't have peanut butter in their cupboard, right? However, I didn't have enough butter so I supplemented with shortening. They were really good. This is a "keeper"

I think more peanut butter should be added to the recipe, because it tasted faintly of PB, but not really as much taste as i'd like. The consistency is excellent though.

This was a great recipe however I made a few changes. I didn’t have brown sugar so I substituted 1/2 cup black strap molasses for the 1 cup of packed brown sugar. I used sugar free salt free peanut butter. The result was a tender cookie with a slightly darker appearance and a rich taste. The molasses flavour was not noticeable. The cookie was not overly sweet either.

I’m doing a keto diet so I used 2 cups of a sugar free smooth peanut butter, almond flour, 2/3 cup of stevia, 2/3 cup of stevia brown sugar, salted butter and left out the salt. I baked them for 9 minutes and used sugar free chocolate chips for half the batch. These are some killer peanut butter cookies that I don’t have to feel guilty about eating

After reading reviews I increased peanut butter to 1&1/2 cups and flour to 2&3/4 cups and after chilling the dough for 1 hour I rolled into dough balls and rolled the balls in sugar, I was worried the cookies would flatten too much but they are hands down the BEST cookies I or anyone else who tried them has ever tasted!

I love to make cookies without chocolate for my husband when I have time off from work. These worked out well for me today. The only changes I made, a tsp. of vanilla extract, a tablespoon of milk
and extra peanut butter (1/4 cp) as well as salted butter. So I omitted the half tsp. Really good and
chewy! A great classic with a cold glass of milk for
dessert. Yum

First batch in the oven I made them a bit too big so they spread out too much, touching each other and ultimately becoming crunchy after cooled down. The smaller ones turned out well!

These were so tasty. Everyone at work loved them. I did add 1/4 cup of flour and another 1/2 cup of peanut butter and a teaspoon of vanilla. I probably wouldn’t add the flour again because it made the dough a bit crumbly.

So I followed one of the reviewer’s suggestion to add the extra 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 peanut butter and also added a splash more than 1 tsp of vanilla extract and these cookies came out great!! Just a heads up though, this recipe makes A LOT of cookies! I think I’ll easily be able to make at least four batches of 9 cookies, (so at least 36 cookies total), so if you don’t have much room in your fridge to store a big tub of cookie dough maybe cut down the recipe to fit your needs.

I got a chance to use my new Professional pink stand mixer for this recipe. There is no way I could have mixed it on my own! The cookies turned out perfect! Not heavy but light crispy melt in your mouth perfect! I used creamy instead of crunchy since I didn't have any.  So easy and fun to make!

The flavor is pretty good, but, like a lot of others, I agree that these cookies are too crumbly.  I added the extra half cup of peanut butter, but not the flour.  Part of the dough I added mini chocolate chips, this did not seem to change the consistency at all.  I also did not chill the dough, just rolled it into a ball and pressed down a little before cooking.  They stayed pretty fluffy during baking.  I will not use this recipe again.

Important changes I made was I listen to the previous reviews and added more flour and peanut butter. If I hadn't I don't think they would have turned out great. Also if you have a peanut butter lover in your house I suggested you add at least 3/4 cup to the recipe. Have fun baking!

I'm not a big peanut butter cookie fan. I'll usually have a few peanut butter blossom cookies around the holidays and that's it, but I found this recipe pleasant. It was very sweet and a nice peanut butter flavor. If I make this again, I'll add in some Reeses' pieces.

  I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy and baked them at 350 for 12-14 minutes (from cold). The edges were nice and crisp and the center was slightly chewy.

I've added 3/4 cup of extra crunchy peanut butter to this recipe and subtracted 1/2 cup sugar. They came out a little crunchy on the out side and a little chewy on the inside.
A perfect cookie.
Thanks for the recipe.

Turned out wonderful...soft inside, perfect texture outside.  I added just a tad more creamy peanut butter (and scant more flour)  Yummy!

Really good! I did follow one of the recommendations to add a little more flour and peanut butter and I cooked it at 350 for about 9 minutes they were so chewy and soft even days after making them. I added some crushed up butterfinger to add some different flavor and texture, it was good.

A good basic recipe. Mild peanut flavor. Because the flour is measured by volume your results may vary. It should have the consistency of greasy play dough. Too soft and sticky add flour. Too firm and crumbly add peanut butter. 
Keep this dough very cold, return it to the fridge if need be.

 I  lowered my oven to 350 but that's because it's an ancient piece of garbage.
I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Next time I'm going for a stronger peanut butter flavor by switching out half a cup of butter for peanut butter.

Perfect gluten free cookies.  I used oat flour (added 1/2 teaspoon(total) xanthan gum).  Used only 3/4 granulated sugar and 3/4brown. Also followed the other reviews' suggestions and added 1/4 c  extra flour  and some extra pb.  Cookies did not spread out and were crunchy and nice looking!. Pleasantly   surprised and relieved! ..(hadn't used oat flour in awhile). Cookies also tasted wonderfully.

Super quick, super delicious. I made them with a bigger scoop this time, and only 8 cookies per sheet. I ended up baking them about 14 minutes. They’re the bomb! Thanks for a great recipe!

I accidentally read 1 stick butter instead of 1 cup. The cookies turned out wonderfully. What a happy mistake. They are fluffy and look beautiful. Others said that their cookies turned out flat. Using half the butter got rid of that issue. They were slightly crumbly my first batch but I fixed that by making sure I made the balls tight before flattening them a bit.

I did not expect the cookies to be that big. They were bigger than most pancakes, however the consistency and taste was great. 
Might need to experiment with the size of the cookies.

I gave this a rating of 4 stars just because the cookies were a little crumbly and they lost that peanut buttery taste. My family and I loved them but a little word of advice... I would add a little more sugar and peanut butter and a tiny bit less flour to make it taste better and be less crumbly.

Great recipe! I used creamy pb since my family is not a fan of crunchy. Chilled for a few hours and Cookies came out wonderful. No extra flour needed. We put Hershey kisses on top of them when finished.

Produced nice classic peanut butter cookies.  With a 375 degree oven, watch time carefully as these can over cook and become ‘brittle’ quickly.  I had best results with a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes.
Recipe made 52 3 1/2inch diameter cookies. I have no idea why some people found the dough ‘thin’; mine was the consistency of Play-Dough. If you use a stand mixer use the paddle attachment not the whisk. I eliminated refrigerating the dough. It was very pliable and easy to work with right after mixing.

Great base recipe. Would have been 5 stars but I had to make the following adjustments based on other reviews. I added 1/4 cup more peanut butter and flour. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla. After chilling the dough I rolled them in sugar and cooked at 350 for 10 minutes. Perfectly soft and chewy peanut butter cookies!

I don't normally bake much, but I brought these in to work this week and multiple coworkers made a point to come by my desk and tell me how amazing these cookies are! I was also surprised that the recipe is so easy. Definitely a winner!

This is a wonderful recipe, very easy with lots of flavor. I made three batches for a cookie event which made about 10 dozen cookies.

Loved them!  Took exactly 10 minutes.  I used the Pampered Chef medium cookie scoop and it made a few more than 3 dozen.  I was using them with Hershey kisses, so I added an additional 1/2 tsp of salt.  Tasty!

Instead of refrigerating the dough leave it out much easier to roll into balls. Start baking right away. Around half way being done use a fork doesn't fall apart. Plus you get a nice crinkle effect on top.

A first for me....never have made peanut butter cookies from scratch.
So very yummy and totally easy to make!
I made them especially for my guy who said they practically melted in his mouth!
This is definitely going into my favorite recipes!

I just finished using this recipe to make peanut butter cookies and they turned out very well the only variation that I use instead of using regular all-purpose flour and having to worry about baking powder and baking soda and salt and all that kind of stuff I just use self-rising flour works just the same works very well saves a couple steps and it cost no different so if you're like me give it a try I'm always experimenting with different ideas.

Excellent recipe.  I did add some vanilla extract (1-1/2tsp) but otherwise followed the recipe. They came out chewy and delicious.  This will be my go to recipe.

They are perfect!  I used 1/2 cup more peanut butter and 1/2 cup more flour so they weren’t as hard to roll.

The perfect peanut butter cookie. I also added the extra 1/2 c flour and 1/2 cup peanut butter. FYI the 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter is equivalent to the small jar of peanut butter. My coworkers loved them.

I made a mistake in the recipe so instead of putting 1 and 1/2 cup of baking soda I put 11 and 1/2 cup of baking soda. It had no space in between the 1 and the 1/2. Please correct this mistake since my cookies taste like soap. I have read the reviews and many people made this mistake but did not realize it. My cookies were dry, crumbly and disgusting.

Exactly what I was looking for. The texture is buttery and crispy/crumbly . On the rich side with 2 cups of sugar, make them small!

Fresh tarragon elevated the flavor. I used a potato masher to break down the potatoes until the soup was at desired consistency.  I also added about 1Tbls of chicken base because I felt it needed a bit more salt. This is a great recipe that can easily be adjusted to taste.

I followed this recipe, first time as shown. Second time as suggested in reviews. I put 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter. I used creamy peanut butter as I do not like crunchy.  I had to bake cookies for 10 minutes.  They didn't hold together. I need to tweak this recipe more. Probably lessen amount of peanut butter and maybe more flour. I live at a high altitude  (6800ft) which could be my problem. This is why not so many stars.

Absolutely scrumptious! I added a tsp of vanilla and they were great! I will definitely make them again...AFTER the 3 1/2 dozen in the freezer are gone! It made around 4 1/2 dozen.

I thought the dough was a bit dry, I added about 1/8 cup milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. This made a big difference

The recipe needs some tweaking, as others have mentioned. I should have read the reviews before making these cookies. The cookies taste great but are hard as a rock and flattened out too much. Next batch I’ll increase the flour and peanut butter but also decrease the sugar and butter. In my oven 13 minutes was the right time at 350 deg. I don’t mind a crispy cookie but not a hard and brittle.

Followed the recipe exactly - turned out perfect! No need to add any extra flour or peanut butter. I added chopped pecans to half the batch for fun and it was delicious !

I would add more white sugar, 1/4th less flour. Sugar makes everything better.

Turned out great with small modifications as per recommendations of others. I added 1/4 cup more peanut butter and 1/4 cup more flour. I did not flatten them either- I left them in balls on the cookie sheet and they spread out to a very flat cookie all on their own. Very good flavour and consistency in my opinion. Although, if you’re looking for a cookie that packs a big peanut butter punch, this isn’t it. I would use this recipe again.

Easy to make and easy instructions to follow. Super tasty and not to sweet. I made them golfball size, slightly pressed them with a fork and they were the perfect size - great recipe!

I added about 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter like the other reviewers suggested, but as soon as anyone took a bite, the cookies crumbled apart. I don't know if it is what I added, or if the recipe was meant to be this way, but this is my first and last time baking peanut butter cookies with flour and 2 sticks of butter.

First time making them. Came out perfect. If you roll a good 1inch ball they work well. I think sometimes people underestimate how big a one inch ball is so they come out small or like pancakes. Mine came out absolutely beautiful and perfect and it was my first time with this reciepe.

This makes a delicious pb cookie, but I gave it 4 stars because I followed some of the adjustments of other reviewers. I upped the pb and flour 1/2 cup and added vanilla. They turned out perfectly delicious with the adjustments. I also added milk chocolate chips and toffee chunks for personal preference because I like the flavors of that combo. I’ll definitely use this adjusted recipe again!

Definitely will make these again. A friend recommended I add a Snicker in the middle of the cookie.  I found Snicker bites because of the size and were encased in chocolate. Nice surprise when eating them.  I made them a little big so I will adjust the size next time.

Made this per the recipe the first time and they came out good!! After reading some reviews I will definitely increase the peanut butter to 1 1/4 cups next time to oopmh up the PB flavor. I make mine larger, a little less than golf ball sized balls, dipped in sugar and baked at 350 for 11-13 min. Nice sized semi-soft cookies. Great base recipe!

Great cookies, but I used  1/2 cup butter & 1/2  cup shortening instead of all butter (makes cookies too flat to use all butter) and an extra 1/2 cup of flour. Also added 1 tsp of vanilla. They are nice and fluffy. Also added 1/2 cup or so of chocolate chips.

These are wonderful as written! I see so many reviews saying the cookies are too thin, but if you follow the instructions including refrigerating the dough for an hour, they come out perfect! I have been using this recipe for years, and wouldn't change a thing.

Really, really good!  Very worth making this recipe! I baked mine on parchment paper and on a baking stone until brown. They were so good fresh out of the oven. A little crispy and a little soft. FYI - the batter is pretty soft and I was about to add more floor, but I did a test bake before I did... Don't mess with the recipe it's perfect! (though I did add a tsp of vanilla). Yum!!

A great recipe. Very good consistency, soft, but not chewy. Very good looking cookie. Nice color, nice flavor. I did increase, as suggested, 1/2c each of flour and peanut butter. That’s it. Baked at 350 for 14 mins. They were perfect! I did have some sugar that I infused with vanilla bean that I used to dust the cookie rounds in before baking. Nice little touch of vanilla flavour without adding it to the dough. I will keep this recipe and use it again! Four stars  because of the adjustments, but all in all it was the original recipe, and the cookies were delicious!!

These cookies turned out great. I went along with the recommendations of adding more PB and flour. I preferred the longer cook time for a golden color.

These cookies taste great, I accidentally put in half a cup too little flour and I didn't refrigerate the dough but the cookies turned out large, thick, and soft. When they first came out of the oven they were very gooey but set nicely after a while.

Great tasting cookies, easy to make. Just watch the time, 10-12 minutes in the oven. The oven is HOT so very easy to burn.

i had to cook mine for less time than the recipe said to, and they came out just a tad burnt in the bottom, but i thought it was a great cookie recipe! My family all loved it and i wouldn’t make it again. It was a bit dry, but i didn’t mind! Very tasty and addicting!

This is my Go-To recipe, which dates to the 1930's, when a neighbor gave my Mother the recipe. (The original recipe called for 3 cups flour  and 1 teaspoon vanilla.) It has become our 4-generation recipe because my Grandchildren are baling them now.

I subbed in half butter-flavored shortening for half the butter. You could get away with all shortening too, to be honest. These flatten A LOT so if you go with all butter or butter that is too soft they will really turn into hockey pucks. I also subbed in half the flour for whole wheat flour because I like doing that with my cookies. They turned out just fine this way. Because they flatten out so much too, don't make them too big or squash them down too much with a fork. They are very crunchy but super tastey. If you want a softer, gooier, peanut butter cookie, look elsewhere. These don't keep the best, so I suggest making dough ahead of time and freezing/chilling it and then baking in small batches as you want.

you don't need to add alot of extra peanut butter, or they get chewy. instead of adding flour, make sure your butter is at room temp, not melted not half heated up. they get thin from that

Wonderful cookies! I took the advice of the first reviewer and increased the flour and peanut butter by 1/2 cup. I only had smooth, instead of chunky so I used a little more than the extra 1/2 cup to help make sure the flavor came through. At the end of mixing all the ingredients, I also mixed chocolate chips and vanilla! I didn’t flatten the cookies before baking, but flattened them very carefully after they came out of the oven. They were chunky and had a great peanut butter flavor.

OK.  I've made these several times and just now read the reviews. Yes, chilling the dough is critical. As is letting them sit for at least 2-3 minutes after removing from the oven.  This not only prevents breakage BUT also (cooler sheet), prevents the "pancake effect" for your next round of dough.  These are a family and friends favorite.  Happy Baking!!!

Overall, a really good recipe! Something that could be fixed about the recipe is the 1 1/2 teaspoon for Baking Soda. It is uncalled for. I would say 1 teaspoon is fine.

I made this with the addition of 1/2 c flour, as many reviewers recommended.  They came out lovely. They were soft and gooey when cooked for 10 mins.  11 would probably be fine as well.  Mine didn't spread out much at all, which I'm guessing is due to the additional flour.  The peanut butter flavor was solid without being too strong.

I omitted the salt and used salted butter.  Added chocolate chips.
I also used a giant scoop- cooked for 13 min.  (yielded 24 giant cookies - 6 per pan)
Very good and crunchy - not a soft cookie at all.

So what I did about the thin batter was I sprayed my baking sheet with spray,  then rolled  them into balls and place the tray in the freezer for an hour. I made mine with homemade candied bacon pieces it might sound weird but they are amazing!  If you have problems rolling the dough after you mixed all the ingredients together place it in the fridge for 30mins to an hour then rolled them and place them In the freezer on a grease7d baking sheet.  The came out perfect Almost the cook time was a Longer first put it in for 10 mins, checked it and 6 mins more was great.  But just keep checking after 10 mins

I've used this recipe for years. Only changes I've ever made was rolling in sugar and reducing baking time/temperature since not every oven is the same and heats up differently. This recipe yields wonderful cookies as is without anything added to it.

Added an extra 1/4 cup of peanut butter to the mix and rolled individual cookie dough balls (heaping tablespoons full) in granulated sugar before placing on baking sheet, pressing them down only slightly. Chilling dough for 24 hours produced best results. I didn’t experience the same flattening out of the cookies noted by other reviewers. Increased cooking time to 11-12 minutes per batch as well.

I followed the recipe exactly (though I also added in some chocolate chips) and they came out perfect! I see some people having issues with the thickness, but mine came out perfect using these exact measurements. The only thing I was surprised by was how many cookies I got out of this recipe! 75!?

I used the suggestion and added more PB and  Flour. I also added vanilla, an additional egg and a tiny bit of milk because my dough was pretty dry 
I also added Nutella in the middle of some of the cookies. They all turned out great! Even though I didn’t follow the recipe completely I feel this recipe is one to keep!

Yummy cookies... definitely chill the dough. I scooped onto baking sheets, chilled in fridge, rolled into balls and rolled into sugar before forking. I also used almost 2 cups of  peanut butter and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. Baked at 350 for 10mins and cooled on the baking sheet. Perfect

I followed the recipe exactly as written and the cookies turned out great. I made half using the fork criss cross pattern and half just slightly flattened. We preferred the slightly flattened version as it seemed softer and chewier.

Easy recipe with ingredients I typically keep in the house so it can be made without planning ahead. Some other reviewers said the cookies were too crisp, so I used an extra 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/4 c less white sugar and baked at 350 for 10 min.  I also added some crushed chocolate chunks to the top. I’ll use this as my go-to PB cookie recipe with my modifications.

These are phenomenal! I noticed people saying their cookies came out thin. Didn’t have a problem. Though I will point out that when you cream your butters and sugars, that you have to beat them until they are light beige, adding in a lot of air, then beat one egg in at a time with about a minute or two in between. This helps to make a light and airy cookie. This is CRUCIAL for almost all cookie recipes.

This is a fantastic recipe just the way it is. I've already made them twice this week because my family is just eating them all up! I'm a baker by trade and have my own small bakery, a few tips will help you yield the perfect cookies:

- use room temperature butter. Do not microwave it. Let it sit on the counter for 2-3 hours. I recommend a high quality butter such as Kerrygold Irish Butter.  It's richer and creamier.
- cream the butter, peanut butter, and sugars first with a paddle attachment. Scrape the bowl then add the eggs and beat for only 30 secs. Do not over beat eggs - it will make for flat cookies!
- same for the flour mixture, only mix until there isn't anymore flour streaks - don't over mix. Scrape bowl halfway through adding the flour mixture.
- ovens aren't all created equal, there are hot spots and some don't heat to the temperature it's suppose to. What works best for me is to rotate the pans halfway through for 8 mins instead of 10. I had to throw away 1 pan of cookies testing how it bakes. 

Happy baking!!

I would definately make this again. I made it as is, but I could see adding an extra 1/4 - 1/2 cup peanut butter. I didn’t need it any more chewy. I may also add 1/4 cup finely shopped peanuts next time (an inspiration from ATK). I did add white chocolate chips which I enjoy.

Family loved the cookies! I followed suggestions of adding 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 more peanut butter. Baked them at 350F for 10 minutes.
Will make this recipe again.

Worst recipe ever! These cookies came out paper thin and way too crispy. After the first batch came out I added more flour as suggested second batch still not great. Third batch I turned the heat down to 350 and they still melted too quickly and were crispy. Good thing my husband doesn’t seem to care but as for myself.. a pregnant woman desperately craving a PB cookie I am extremely disappointed. All I wanted was a soft and chewy cookie and now I’ve wasted an entire cup of butter, all my PB, and my time.

Reading reviews I made them with 1/4 cup extra flour and 1/4 cup extra peanut butter. I used creamy peanut butter.  I will make other small adjustments. Recipe worked. I am not much of a baker.
Since I have made quit few batches now. I use 3 eggs and tiny bit milk. 2 to 4 tablespoons. I don't measure. Also I have used 1/2 cup extra flour and peanut butter at times instead of the 1/4 extra.
Daughter and I make them together and sometimes we experiment a little.
The cookie now is more soft as before it was more crunchy.

I followed the review that suggested adding an extra 1/2 cup of brown sugar and flour and they turned out great. If longevity is any indication as to how good they were, they must have been good because they sure didn't last too long.

I made it as described with a few changes: I added a 1/2 cup of peanut butter and only had almond flour on hand. They turned out perfect and delicious. I didn't have the too thin problem probably because of the almond flour. 
I'd recommend cooking them on parchment and taking the whole paper off the pan instead of removing them with a spatula... they're super soft coming out and then perfect chewiness when cooled a bit. Yummmmm

Yummy! I used less butter (1 full stick, and about 1/2 a stick), and used a little less white sugar and used agave instead. Going to try using even less white sugar and substitute with more agave.

They were great, but  if you want them to be richer and taste more like Peanut Putter i would suggest that you use a whole jar of peanut butter, although they will be more thick.

I added 2 tablespoons of cocoa and I didn’t put my dough in fridge at all.  Put them in oven for 13 minutes at 375 and came out amazing!

i first made this recipe as a school assignment to cook a 1940's era dinner. They were very delicious. I have made them three times now. I always get lots of compliments on them! I have tried adding raisins and other dried fruits. They are always very good! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These were amazing!  I had some natural peanut butter in my fridge that I needed to use up, so I used that and a bit of the Kraft peanut butter to make up the 1 c.. 
Other than that, I made the recipe as is, and didn't have any challenges with the cookie being too thin and therefore needing to add extra flour. Maybe the trick is in the consistency of the butter before you blend it with the sugars? My butter was soft but not soft enough to easily sink a spoon into - if that helps. Also, refrigeration of the dough before cooking is key to making them not spread out like pancakes. Don't avoid the chilling of the dough! Lol.
The cookies were gone before I knew it and I'm going to make them again for sure.

It's a good recipe! I took some advice from the other reviewers and added 1/4 c flour after they were cooked and done I wish I wouldn't have. I think without the excess flower you get more of a gooey cookie which is what I was looking for. But if you like them sort of soft in the middle and kind of crunchy at the edges then add the extra flour. I also added an entire cup extra of peanut butter we like our cookies to be extremely peanut buttery. Over all great!

Two of us who are public school teachers had the day off so we got together and each made one batch of the "classic peanut butter cookies."  We made the recipe exactly as written except she used fresh ground organic peanut butter from the grocery store and I opened up and jar of creamy Jif, a well known brand with a strong flavor.  We each stirred in one cup of chocolate chips.   We both made our cookies the same size and used parchment paper as a liner on the cookie sheets.  
Hers turned out more flaky and lighter in texture, color and taste.  Mine were more dense, more chewy, slightly more carmel colored and flavorful.  Took 'em to a party and people went crazy for them!

This is my third time making this recipe. It always turns out perfectly! However, I too added in 1/4 cup more flour and 1/2 more peanut butter.  I roll the tops in sugar, flatten with a fork and bake for 9 minutes.

My first attempt yielded 68 flat wafers, like a ginger snap. I was expecting a chewy-er  center.  they are still yummy for the tummy and mucho deliciouso.  The next time I'll try 350 for 10 minutes.  I might try messing with the sugar combination,,, maybe molasis and cane sugar (though I hate to use the good stuff on PB cookies, saving it for cakes).

I just made this recipe, and sadly my cookies turned out pretty bad. I followed this recipe exactly, and although my warm cookies smelled quite amazing, they tasted like foam and something was definitely off with them. Since this recipe has such a high rating, I am guessing that maybe my baking soda was too old or an ingredient was off.

These turned out good, but be careful on the flour measurement.  The dough was very dry, which I think made the cookies a little hard.

These are great!
I made these with regular salted butter, and creamy peanut butter. I didn't refrigerated dough at all.
I simply scooped them with a mini ice cream scoop, and that made the perfect round shape and size.
When making fork patterns onto the unchilled dough, I dip the fork into granulated sugar before each press. Then it won't stick and you can just skip the whole refrigerating step.
I also sprinkle more granulated sugar over cookie tops before I bake.
Absolutely classic and deeeeeelish!!

I made these cookies exactly as written and they turned out beautifully. I didn’t have the spreading issue some people had. I always use real, unsalted Irish butter in my baked goods. I don’t know if this made a difference with the spreading or not. Delicious!

Pretty cookies chewy and delicious.   I allow the dough to sit in the fridge for a couple of 3-4 hours. I used half Crisco baking stick and the other half salted butter.

I made these cookies exactly how the directions stated and didn’t like them one bit. To my surprise they were pretty flavorless. With 2c of sugar I thought they would be more sweet, but they weren’t sweet at all. They were totally bland. I wouldn’t make these again.

I followed tips from other cooks by including the additional flour and peanut butter as well as a small amount of vanilla. I also refrigerated the dough for approximately 6 hours. I had no problem rolling the dough into balls and then I rolled them in granulated sugar. They did not melt and looked just like the picture. If you like them crispy bake them an extra 5 minutes.

These were a big hit in my house and workplace! Followed the recipe exactly and love the consistency and it's the perfect about of peanut butter. Only downfall is that they did crumble easily once cooled and did not stick together well out of the oven.

This has way too much sugar, it crunches in your teeth...while not tasting overly sweet they were rather bland. Not worth the time or trouble. I actually would be embarrassed to give them away.

I used a little more peanut butter than this recipe calls for, but beyond that I stuck with the recipe and the cookies turned out great.  I will make these again.

I added 1/4 cup of flour and peanut butter as suggested by other reviews and they were delicious! I didn't press the fork in for 1 batch and I actually think they tasted better that way...a bit chewier. The ones I pressed the fork in were pretty crunchy. I will definitely definitely make these again.

This recipe is great! It doesn't take long to mix or to bake, only when it says put dough in refrigerator for an hour they aren't kidding. The first time I tried making them I baked the cookies without refrigerating the dough and they didn't turn out well. The next time I refrigerated the dough for an hour and they came out perfect. In baking just as it is in life, when all else fails follow the instructions :-).

Easy-peasy recipe to make and these cookies are delicious. I followed the recipe and took into consideration the comments/reviews here regarding "flat cookies".  I had that same problem over Christmas with my oatmeal raisin cookie recipe...By reducing the white sugar by 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup more flour made this recipe come out just right.  Cooking time in my oven ranged about 12 -14 minutes. I tested a few before baking an entire batch and that seemed about right for this recipe.

I followed the recipe and let the batter chill longer than an hour. These turned out super thin to the point that those little fork marks were pointless. They taste ok, but seem to have a strange aftertaste I can't quite put my finger on. It seems almost too salty? I don't recommend this recipe. 2 stars because it at least make an edible cookie.

Needs 2tsp Vanilla Extract.

recommend weighing out 6 - 1oz balls, flattening out, and cooking  at 10 mins; then adjusting weight/flatten amount  to get the perfect consistency.  e.g.: I can do 10 1oz balls or 20 .5 oz balls with the same "push downness" and they have the perfect center after 10mins.  if I do 1.1oz or .6oz at 10mins with the same smushness it's too gooey, and .9 or .4 oz it's too hard. (I don't know why, but that fork hatch pattern is quintessential peanutbutter cookie...  I made peanut butter cookies without that hatch and with sprinkles... just not the same... wouldn't recommend...)

OMG delicious!  Just the right crisp, airy texture.  I used a little less sugar, and they were plenty sweet.  I thought 2 dozen wouldn't be enough, so I doubled the recipe.  Wow...I probably used about a 3rd of the dough, and we made 5 dozen 3" & 4" cookies.  Will have to do another round to use the rest.  Maybe God did a multiplying miracle???  ;-)

This is a great base recipe, per a suggestion Jennifer77 I added a half cup of peanut butter and half cup of flour and these were great cookies!  The cooking time needed to be well over 10 minutes, I would say 14 or 15 will be my marker next time.   With this mix they barely need to be browning and they firm up nicely when cooling.

Amazing cookies! Only giving 4 stars because I didn't make it exactly as shown, I made the changes other suggested. I added 1/2 cup more peanut butter and 1/4 cup more flour and they turned out great. I also added an entire package of Reese peanut butter baking chips - delicious! Maybe it's just my oven, but 10 minutes is not even close to being long enough. Mine took almost 20.

The cookies turned out perfect! I made a few small changes, substituted creamy peanut butter for chunky, chilled the dough for 24hrs, and didn’t flatten the cookies prior to baking. Once baked added Dove dark chocolate squares.

I used gluten-free flour and accidentally doubled the eggs.  They are delicious but have a mild peanut butter taste.  I would add more peanut butter next time.  I put Hershey's kisses on a few of them as they came out of the oven.  Very tasty.

I am allergic to peanut butter, but I agreed to make these for my friend’s mom. I have no clue what they taste like but she said it reminded her of her grandmother’s cookies. Not too bad for making them for the first time and not having a clue what it actually taste like. I did add a little vanilla.

This is an AMAZING recipe. I took others advice and added 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter. I also added a splash of vanilla, some ginger and peanut butter chips. Refrigerated dough for an hour. Cooked at 315° because my first batch I baked at 350 and the bottoms turned brown way too quickly as the rest of the cookie was still undone. Usually with half of the dough I will make into balls, flatten a bit and dip the top in turbinado sugar.. Then about half way through baking add a spoon full of strawberry preserves to the top. The other half I pull out halfway, do the cross with the fork and top with Reese's pieces or 
chopped up Reese's peanut butter cups. I usually refrigerate the candies while the first half of the baking is done. These cookies turn out perfectly every time now and stay soft and fluffy for days. So glad I tried this one again, absolutely a keeper.

I have never given a review before, but I saw how many people had problems with thin cookies and no one explained why. The difference is the peanut butter. Check the ingredients: if it mentions oil, particularly 'fully hydrogenated vegetable oil', the cookie dough will soften in the oven and the cookies will be flat. Hydrogenated vegetable oil is solid at room temp, but liquid when you warm it up in the oven. It doesn't matter if you refrigerate it for an hour or a week, it will still get warm in the oven and melt. If you use a peanut butter that only has peanuts, and maybe sugar and salt, you must flatten the cookies with a fork, because they won't flatten on their own. If you can't get peanut butter without added oil, you have to reduce the amount of butter, but the flavor won't be as good.  Also, if you use good peanut butter, you can pour off the excess peanut oil from the top first. Then you can increase the peanut butter by as much as double. The cookies will be more crumbly, but they won't flatten and they will have more peanut flavor. The only other 'tweak' I would suggest is a teaspoon of vanilla. BTW, it is hard to tell from the label if the peanut butter has a little added oil or a lot, but if it is more than 190 calories per 2Tbls, it has too much added oil or too much sugar. And, if it says 'molasses', it has so much added oil it would be white if they didn't add something to make it brown.

Needed to make 4 dozen cookies for a Christmas party, and who doesn’t like a peanut butter cookie? I took the advice of others and upped the flour and peanut butter to help with spreading. I doubled the batch according to the recipe and added 3/4 cup of flour and 1 cup of peanut butter. Used a pretty decent sized ice cream scoop, I think a 3 tbs one, and baked for 7.5 minutes in my convection oven, flipping the pan about halfway through. They were perfect! I dipped them in chocolate and decorated with a few sprinkles. People thought they were from a bakery and a few have asked to buy some for their other parties this season. This is a great recipe!

I made the peanut cookies up here in Big Bear Lake and due to the altitude (7600 ft.) they came out somewhat hard .  The next day I remade the cookies using the high altitude recipe and they still came out somewhat hard, however, my husband and friends loved them! Go figure.

I made these today as a tester for my cookie exchange next week. This is saved as my go-to recipe from now on. I followed the exact recipe and they are phenominal. The only thing the author should add to the instructions is to refrigerate the dough first. I always do with rolled cookies or even drop cookies like chocholate chip. It doesnt spread so much. Perfect cookie. Thank you for this recipe!!

This is a perfect old-fashioned cookie recipe. I added 1/4c more flour and a smidge more peanut butter. I use a small ice cream scoop to scoop the cookies. I also spray my fork with a bit of canola oil to keep it from sticking. Parchment paper keeps the cookies uniform, and the sheet clean. Let the cookie sit in the cookie sheet for 2 minutes before removing to a cooling rack. A favorite of my college-aged daughter and her floor mates!

Love love love! Did add 1/2 c. additional flour and 1/2 c. additional peanut butter as this was what most others recommended (gave it 4 instead of 5 since I did modify the recipe) Made about 3 dozen cookies.
I used whole wheat flour since this is all we had in house and they were still rich, chewy and delicious!

Very good, chewy soft , I like that but be sure to let them sit for about 10 min before scraping up or they can break,  also if you make them small and taller then flat before you bake them you will not have an issue with them flattening out and cool dough helps too not room temp. I cooked mine just a few min more too to be sure no breaking up and added some nuts and vanilla. I will be using this recipe again for new years cookies.

I wish I'd read the reviews before I mixed these cookies.
The recipe is very tasty but the cookies were a bit thin and crispy for my taste. The kiddos didn't mind and loved them. They also helped me mix and bake them.
I will definitely make again but tweak the recipe slightly.

I made this recipe almost as written and the cookies were good. I should have followed the reviewers recommendations to add more peanut butter. I started the baking process at 350 for 9 minutes as recommended by the reviewers, but it took closer to 20 minutes to achieve the desired outcome. After 9 minutes the test cookie fell apart. I will definitely make these again with the addition of more peanut butter and vanilla... and baked at 375.

This turned out delicious. Only change I made based off reviews was I baked at 350 for 10 minutes and I did not flatten at all. I used a cookie scoop and just placed on the cookie sheet. (I did add chocolate chips). They were perfect..crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

I followed this recipe exactly and they came out perfect! Soft, chewy and a good thickness. I threw them in the freezer for 30 minutes instead of the refrigerator. That was the only difference. Thanks! Will use again!

I am happy with how these turned out, although they are not the best that I've had. I would recommend placing them far apart on the baking sheet, or making small balls, because they spread a lot.

The BEST peanut butter cookie recipe, EVER!!
I made three double batches, (I always give away a bunch)
and EVERY comment I got back was that these were FANTASTIC!! And, they were! My son, as he was walking away with several, said that they were sinful! LOL! 
The only thing I did different with the recipe, was that I felt that the dough needed extra flour.  I added an extra cup, and the dough was fine then for me. This will DEFINITELY be my go to peanut butter recipe from now on!

I made these cookies with my Foods class, and they are amazing!  However, I only baked them for 8-9 minutes.  The recommended time for baking seemed way to long, and at 10 minutes, my first rack of cookies almost burnt.  I would definitely recommend these cookies, and will make them again.

I'm only giving this 4 stars because I modified the recipe as suggested by others. I added 1/2 cup more peanut butter and 1/4 more flour. I also added 1 package of Reese peanut butter chips. These are the best cookies I've ever had!

Great recipe.  I used creamy peanut butter, but that was just preference it came out nice and if you follow the recommendations of others to add a bit more PB and flour (1/4 cup each) it comes out softer and I love more PB anyways!

These had a great consistency, no problems with being thin at all, and I only refrigerated for 30 minutes! Not sure why some had issues with that. I flattened and made the criss cross too! However, they didn't have a lot of peanut butter flavor. Next time I'll add vanilla extract and more peanut butter. They tasted better after being in the cookie jar all night, though! My Mom loved them as is!

This may possibly be the best peanut butter cookie I have ever made. The dough was a little loose, so, I added  an extra 1/4 cup flour to it, I only added 1/2 cup demerara sugar instead of 1 cup of white sugar , and only used 2/3 cup packed brown sugar, and the cookie was just right in sweetness. Thanks Shirley for the recipe. I did not flatten them much at all and make marks. I rather rolled the dough before baking in sugar, and just pushed it down a very little  with my hand and they baked up beautifully into a lovely crinkle cookie. My husband was bonkers for them.

I cut the recipe in half and the results were good. As suggested,   I added an additional 1/4 cup of peanut butter and a 1/4 cup of flour  (half the amount recommended since I cut the recipe in half).  I added  dark chocolate mini chips to some of the dough which made the cookies even better.  Baked at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.  Would definitely make this recipe again.

They turned out awesome. I didnt have crunchy peanut butter or unsalted butter so used regular for both.  I have almost no experience baking so I did exactly as directed. I didnt experience the issues others did.

I substituted self rising flour so I didn't use any baking soda, powder, or salt. Also we only had salted butter but they still came out fine and we don't use crunchy peanut butter so I used creamy. I rolled the dough balls in sugar before I baked them.  They turned out amazing! I'm saving the recipe for later.

I added 1/4 cup extra flour, a teaspoon of vanilla and an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter.   I also added a half a bag of toffee pieces.   I used a cookie scoop and dipped the top of the cookie in sugar and pressed them down with a spatula.   I don't know the size of my scoop, but  smaller than a golf ball.   I baked them for 11 minutes and the outside was crispy and the inside chewy.   BEST PEANUT BUTTER COOKIE I EVER MADE!   Big hit at home, big hit at the office the next day and the recipe made about 3 dozen.   This will forever be my go-to peanut butter cookie recipe.

I have no clue where I went wrong, but these cookies taste TERRIBLE. Like the flavor is almost nonexistent. Followed this to a T... even followed other’s suggestion to increase the peanut butter and flour. Consistency of the cookies is flawless but the TASTE ugh absolutely horrible. No clue what happened here.

These came out pretty good. My rating is subjective. I can't put my finger on what it is I think would make them even better. Maybe less flour. I would make them again, but I am also going to try out some other recipes.

I read comments, and added 1/4 more of peanut butter and flour, and baked at 350 for about 13 minutes, and found this was a amazing cookie batch. Everyone who tried them loved them, so 9/10

These cookies turned out great for me. I have made these a few times and I bring them to work and everybody loves them. The only thing I would suggest is to use jiff peanut butter. Other brands have a weaker peanut flavor.  I am not sure why people change the recipe. I follow it exactly and they come out perfect.

Made these for my boyfriend; he went nuts for them! The flavor is very tasty and strong. For a somewhat softer cookie, I baked them on a sheet of wax paper and kept the dough in the fridge overnight

Great taste! Took some people's suggestions and made the following edits:
- added 1/4 c peanut butter
- added 1/2 c flour
- added 1 tsp vanilla extract
- sprinkled caster sugar on each cookie before baking

As for cooking time: I would set the timer for 10 minutes, then check every minute or so until the dough juuuust cracked. Result: chewy cookies!

These cookies came out AHmazing! My pregnant wife was soooo happy. I added an extra 1/4 c of flour and an extra couple spoonfulls of peanut butter, in addition to 1 tbs of vanilla extract. I let the butter sticks sit out to get nice and soft then whipped it on high speed with the sugar. Once it was whipped I added the peanut butter and vanilla extract and whipped again on high speed. I set the mixer to low and slowly added the dry ingredients and mixed until just barely combined. I let it set in the fridge for 2 hours then made 1 oz balls, rolled in my hands then dipped in sugar on one side which I then scored with a fork. I baked at 350 for 12 minutes. They came out nice and crisp on the outside with a moist chewy center. WIll def be saving this one!

It was awesome and easy.  The first time I made it I forgot to add the eggs, and it made absolutely scrumptious peanut butter SHORTBREAD cookies.  Not sure which one I like better.

I made this recipe as is, using all natural peanut butter (no added oil, sugar, or salt). I used salted butter and added the salt. I made it gluten free by substituting directly 1:1 with ground almonds (almond flour). I baked on convection at 320f   They turned out delicious.

This is just the classic Toll House cookie recipe without the vanilla and chips, and with peanut butter.  A good cookie, but not a classic peanut butter cookie.

I made these last night and they turned out pretty good. I used whole wheat flour instead of white, and instead of regular crunchy peanut butter, I used a creamy natural maple honey peanut butter (it has the maple and honey already mixed in). They are delicious and satisfying. 

I found that the dough spread quite a bit when baked, so pay attention to the 1-inch sizing directions. I also started baking them with the crisscross pattern, but after the first batch, the dough started to warm up and I had to peel the cookie from the fork after pressing it. I stopped bothering, and I actually like the crackled look they get better than the crisscross. 

I might make these again for the holidays with red and green food coloring and a few autumnal spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.

These tasted delicious! The only thing I forgot to do was refrigerate it, but it still turned out delicious! My only complaint, however, was that they weren't as chewy as I would have liked, but I could try to add more brown sugar next time. Still amazing as is, though!

You know the recipe for that thing you cook or bake that everyone swoons over and always asks you to make for special occasions or get-togethers? That’s your holy grail recipe. And that dish is as closely associated with you as is your signature fragrance, or your spirit animal, or your favorite team (this is how people know what to buy you at holidays). The Classic Peanut Butter Cookie recipe is my first HG recipe not handed down to me by someone else, which is a sign of killing it at #midlifeing (which is adulting for the 35+ set). I did add vanilla, as others have mentioned. I also love the flavor and texture Creamy Jif and raw sugar give to this cookie, so I make those swaps. It’s definitely a sweet cookie, so you may prefer to cut down some of the sugar and adjust your other ingredients accordingly, which I experiment with a bit depending on if I’m making peanut butter blossoms (rolled in green sugar at Christmas) or adding chocolate chips (sometime semi-sweet, sometimes half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate). My friends and family rave about these cookies. I make small batches for myself and freeze them but they still don’t stick around as long as they should. Baking is literally a science and to be successful you have to be precise. For baked goods recipes, I tend to take negative reviews with a grain of salt because there are many variables that contribute to successful vs unsuccessful outcomes. I learned a lot from my mom and old episodes of Martha Bakes, but I sti

They were good.  They were sweet.  A couple of things you really need to know if you make cookies.  You don't have to sift the dry ingredients together...at all.  Just cream butters and sugars and put the salt, baking powder, and baking soda in.  Mix for another 30 seconds and then add the eggs and cream it for another minute.  Add the flour and mix.  believe me, the dry ingredients WILL incorporate evenly.  I don't know why people try to make things more difficult than they should be.  Also, there is no reason to make "hash marks" on these cookies unless you want to make them look like old fashioned peanut butter cookies.  The original  reason for the marks  was because very little butter was used and we had to push them down a bit for them to spread out enough.  This batter is very loose and trying to get the fork not to pick up the batter between the tines is a pain.  Just sayin', trying to make an easy recipe hard is silly.  The cookie is a little too sweet for my taste and not enough peanut butter flavor, but my family loved them.  I'll make them again.

I would give this recipe 5 stars for flavor BUT they are a crumbly mess.  Followed the recipe exactly so not sure what went wrong.  Some say add more flour but others say there was too much flour that’s why they crumble. On to another recipe.

I made these cookies with my grandson.  I think this is an excellent recipe.  I only had salted butter, so we omitted the salt in the recipe.  We made 4 dozen cookies.  We let them cool briefly on the cookie sheet before moving them to a cooling rack.  They are crispy, just the way we like them.  I will use this recipe again.

I will use a smaller scoop next time and make them more bite size.  Also dip the back of fork into sugar when you make the cross cross pattern so the dough does not stick to fork when making the pattern.

As others had stated that the cookies spread out too much and were thin, I added a 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 more peanut butter as another review suggested. Cookies turned out delicious - but ended up making close to 80 cookies!! Might half the recipe next time! I also only baked them for 8-9 minutes as I wanted chewier cookies. Might add a little more peanut butter next time.

I have used this recipe at least four times now with the only change being that we never have crunchy peanut butter so I must settle for creamy. I follow the recipe exactly and bake each batch for exactly 9 minutes and they come out perfect every time. Wonderful recipe and I recommend everyone use this one! Thank you for sharing.

Followed the recipe but didn't refrigerate for the hour.  Quick and easy. My family loved these cookies and we will make them again.

I followed the advice of others and upped the PB to 1-1/2 c. I also increased the flour by 1/4 c.  The dough turned out dry and tough even with increasing the PB. I cannot imagine what it would look like had I not. The flavor was great though.  Be careful what kind of pan you use, however.  I used a dark pan and they burned at 350F.

Love these! Other reviewers were right. Made them for the first time today, added 1/4 cup of peanut butter, 1/4 cup of flour, and baked at 350 instead of 375 after leaving the dough in the fridge for a few hours instead of 1. They came out perfectly. I only had creamy peanut butter on hand, which worked out fine. I sprinkled a bit of sugar over the tops after pressing them down with the fork like grandma taught me and they were juuuust right.

I made it exactly as written.  Very disappointed.  No peanut butter taste at all.  They look good, however, if that is your priority.

Delicious!! I read the other reviews and cut the sugar down to 1/2 c white 1/2 c brown added 1/4 c more PB and 1/4c more flour. The dough ended up in the fridge for 3 days because of lack of time. Baked them with a peanut M&M in the middle, pressed them down because they don't spread much at all. So Good!!

My first ever attempt at peanut butter cookies and they were a big success.  I stirred in a snack size package of honey roasted peanuts that I got at supermarket checkout lane since I only buy creamy peanut butter and it added a nice little crunch.  Friends thought they tasted good enough to sell.

Followed the recipe to a T. Oven temperature and cook times were the same. They burned. 

Second half of the batch that went in the oven went in at 325. They still burned but just a little cause I kept an eye on them. Definitely a recipe problem. I would halve the amount of brown sugar in these and halve the butter, as well as cool at 325 for 6-8 minutes instead of 375 for 10. Bad recipe.

These were perfect!  And yes I did my own adjustments, as everyone seems to do.  I left out the white sugar and used whole wheat pastry flour.  No problems with flat cookies.  They turned out tasty and beautiful.

Great cookies! Very good texture and taste. We made only half a batch and it was 25 medium cookies! We put 1/4 cup less sugar and a bit more peanut butter and they turned out pretty sweet and overall delicious!

I followed the advice of several reviewers and added an extra 1/2 cup each of flour and peanut butter, and also added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I baked for about 11 minutes at 350 for a slightly crunchier cookie.  The cookies are delicious and were a big hit!

I chose to use creamy instead of crunch peanut butter, but I think I would be great either way.  I think it was delicious and My family liked these cookies too. I love that it was quick and easy to make. I enjoy feeding  my family home made foods, but don't Always have a lot of time.

It's good if you're having trouble with them being too flat just roll your balls and press lightly, not hard with your fork. I added to the original recipe extra four as suggested and it was yucky too much flour, I want peanut butter taste not flour taste.

These cookies were delicious. I took recommendations of some reviewers: I also added an extra 1/2 cup peanut butter, 1/4 cup extra flour and 1ts. vanilla. I cooked them at 350 degrees for 11 minutes and cooled on tray for 2 minutes. I lined my pans with parchment paper.  I got about 3 dozen cookies since we like big cookies.  These came out lightly crispy edges and a nice soft chewy center. I also sprinkled sugar over the tops after I used a fork in a crisscross pattern. These are now my go to peanut butter recipe.

After spending a lot of time reading the reviews I chose to add the additional flour and PB. My dough was extremely sandy even after chilling it. I decided to add water until it formed a nice cookie dough using my electric stand mixer. After that it held together nicely. This recipe made 4 dozen cookies. Baked at 375 for 10 minutes.

I Make these Peanut Butter cookies all the time and I have read everyone's review .. this is a no fail recipe .. but for some reason I can use the same amount of ingredients and I get 6 dozen cookies out of this recipe... I do like to change them up once in a while so I will add coarsely chopped walnuts to them or toss in come Chocolate chips or Skor bites... Very Good Cookie Over all!!!!

these cookies are GOOD, however, you should definitely add 1/2 cup more peanut butter, and 1/2 more flour. It'll make the cookies less flat, and just better all around. Let the dough chill in fridge to hold fat, therefore making the cookies tall and not flat. Some people like to press peanut butter cookies with a fork, and you can do that, however it makes them flat and I prefer them to be tall and gooey.

1/4 cup of butter and 3/4 cup of coconut oil.  1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Add 3/4 cup chocolate chips.  Make into larger balls of dough to bake, to keep moister :)

These cookies are great and easy to make. I made a half batch since I only had 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter on hand. I also added chopped peanuts and some peanut butter baking chips. The Hubs loved them. Next time I may chop the baking chips before adding them so the flavor is throughout the whole cookie.  I did not refrigerate my dough. I changed my oven temp to 350 degrees and baked them for about 12 to 15 minutes. I used a 2 tablespoon scoop and only made a slight indentation with a fork. The cookies turned out great and didn’t spread very much.   Thanks for sharing.

This excellent, yummy recipe makes roughly 3 dozen cookies. I followed the ingredients almost exactly with a few alterations to avoid the unnecessary hour wait in the fridge - nobody has time for that these days, lol! Instead of using 2 1/2 cups of flour, I used an even 3 cups. This helps thicken the dough without waiting. Also, to avoid flattened cookies as some reviewers complained about, I dissolved the baking soda in 1 tbs of hot water which creates a nice thick texture to the cookie with crispy edges and chewy middle (a good cookie recipe’s secret weapon) - no refrigeration required! Beat 1 egg at a time. No need to sift the flour etc. Some reviewer complained the fork marks disappeared, mine were very visible using my method. For added flavour I added a capful of Mexican Vanilla and 3/4 cups of semi sweet chocolate chips! Double YUM! I gave a dozen to my brother who popped in while I was making them and he said, “these are so  good, can I take some home?” Haha! I should also add, the kids were in heaven when they came home from school to an amazing smell and deliciousness! Thank you for this delicious recipe! I’d give it more stars if I could!  :)

I’m not the worlds best baker. So I try for the easy recipes and read the reviews for tips. I wouldn’t even know what to change if I didn’t read the reviews. I used salted butter, creamy PB, and added 1 tsp of vanilla. I cooked them on 350 for 10 min (my oven is old so keep that in mind). They turned out great! I kept the dough in fridge for an hour but kept putting it back in there when I was done with each batch. Never made them so someone said they had issues and said it wasn’t in the fridge long enough. I rolled them in sugar and didn’t fork them down flat. Just did the crisscross with the fork lightly. It flattened on its own.  They’re delicious so far!

I agree the cookies were too thin so I also added a 1/2 cup more flour, as well as a 1/2 cup more peanut butter. I also added 1 teaspoon vanilla. Thank you Jennifer for your additions. The cookies were delicious!

thank you for this recipe . It fit well with my modifications. I used Stevia instead of the sugars and Young Living Einkorn Flour . the best pb cookies are with crunchy pb and real butter. I didnt have enough butter so i blended in veg. shortening and the cookies are awesome . They have the texture when you bite into them of crunchy and smooth like a pie crust.

I substituted cookie butter for the peanut butter. After I rolled them in a ball, I roll them in cinnamon sugar mixture, then did the fork thing and baked. They are out of this world!! Make them now and thank me afterwards.

Made the recipe exact. No changes. The texture of the cookies are perfect. Nice and soft. The flavor on the other hand was a lil off. Doesn't have a full blown peanut butter taste. Now that is my preference. If you like a light tasting cookie leave recipe alone. I will be making these again but adding a lil more peanut butter. Thanks for the recipe!!

I have made these peanut butter cookies several times and we love them. The only thing I changed was using smooth peanut butter instead of crunchy. Ive seen some disappointed people on here about how they turned out. Sometimes it can be something as simple as baking soda freshness date or oven temps varies. So sometimes we have to experiment with recipes..

These were delicious. I didn't have a problem with the  cookies being too soft or flat like others reported. I made a batch part classic peanut butter, part with chocolate added. I used whole foods creamy peanut butter. They definitely satisfied my sweet tooth cravings.

Disappointing. People should NOT give a recipe 5 stars if they alter the recipe. I read tons and tons of reviews saying that more flour was required in this recipe as the dough was too thin. So i listened to the reviewers and i added an extra 1/2 cup of flower and extra 1/4 cup peanut butter. All that dough RUINED. I knew it felt dry as i was rolling them into balls, but i figured they would be fine. the cookies werent even in the oven for 6 minutes and they were BURNT to a crisp. Tried to fix the dough to make it less dry and then it just made it taste awful. I should have never taken advice from the reviews.

These are really crispy.  Not what I was looking for.  They are easy to make and the taste is okay.  They would be better with less or no baking soda.

I got a Kitchen Aid Mixer as a gift, and wanted to try it out.  It was late, I didn't have any chocolate chips and I love peanut butter cookies. This recipe makes amazing cookies. I was in a rush, so I did not refrigerate the dough. But, I love my cookies super soft and it made them just how I like it!

Followed the recipe exactly except I didn't press the cookies down at the end with a fork and they were a little shorter (chubbier and not as crispy) as I would have liked. Also think I used a fresh ground peanut butter which didn't have any salt so the cookies did not have the wonderful peanut taste of a roasted peanut butter cookie. The only reason I give 4 stars is because the recipe uses more sugar and butter than other recipes and the cookie did not blow my socks off but very solid. Enjoy!

Easy to follow instructions. Like others, I did increase the flour to 3 cups and the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups.  Used a cookie scoop, so all cookies were about the same size.  Made 4 dozen.

This recipe is great! It was created by Kraft and has been around for years. I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars because you forgot to copy down the vanilla.  These are awesome cookies. Remember, the longer you leave them in the oven, the harder/firmer they get.

4 stars for adjustments... Almost doubled the peanut butter and added flour .. about 1/4 cup... Tried a couple of sizes... the bigger the scoop, the better it came out.

These are amazing! I made them gluten free by using Namaste Foods Gluten Free Perfect Flour Blend. Another user said to bake them at 350 for 9 minutes - that works much better than the original recipe. It makes for a soft cookie instead of a crisp one.

I added 1/2 cup more non-crunchy peanut butter and 1/2 cup more flour. The cookies were really good..I adjusted the time to 12 minutes and they cooled too hard. Second batch at 10 minutes and they were too soft. Last batch at 11 minutes and they were just right. I also added chocolate chips to some and some I added minced walnuts which tasted the best.

These turned out so delicious!! I followed the advice of other reviews and added some extra flour, peanut butter, and vanilla extract. I also had a half a bag of crushed Butterfinger candies left over, so I mixed those in too. Baked at 350 for about 12 minutes on my stoneware pans. I ended up with about 70 cookies, crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle just as a peanut butter cookie should be. This recipe will be my new staple!!

I used JUMBO eggs so I added another 1/4 C of flour. The only tip I'd add is that these cookies needed to bake longer than 10 minutes.  Many variables might have effected the increase in baking time.

I followed the recipe exactly except for adding chocolate chips. I was going to add peanut butter as many people suggested, but I ran out. I found these to be quite dry and sandy. After I tasted them, I added some oil and incorporated that into the remaining batter. This didn't really help.

The best peanut butter cookies ever. I used salted butter, so I cut back a bit on the salt. Used homemade smooth peanut butter which I keep refrigerated. I do warm it a bit in the microwave. Used a medium size cookie scoop which made 36 cookies. Took them to a family gathering today & they were gone in minutes. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This cookie held up to the heat of the oven fork marks and all, furthermore it did not melt As some reviewers claimed.  I made this following the recipe exactly. I however did not like the shortbread cookie texture that it produced. I prefer a Crunchy  cookie with a nice bite that stands up to milk. This is not it. 
Summary: Its crumbly and more in line with shortbread than anything else. Lacks sufficient peanut butter presence.

I made these cookies exactly as the recipe called for with one change and everyone loved them. 

Baking at 375F caused the bottom of the cookies to burn before the center was done. This may not be the case if you use foil to line the cookie sheet (the only reason I can think of for the foil tip), but the recipe didn't explicitly state it was necessary for proper baking so I didn't. I lowered the temperature to 350F for 12 minutes. The cookies definitely don't look ready  when they are ready to come out; however, if you take a bite and they don't taste doughy then they're done.

Some additional things I did that the recipe instructions didn't call for, with reasonings provided:

1.  Make sure the butter is at room temperature (not fully melted, just soft enough to be squishy).

2. Make sure the eggs are at room temperature. Mix them in one at a time and scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula to make sure each egg is fully mixed in before adding the next.  They like to stick to the sides of the bowl!

3. I lined the bottom of the cookie sheet with parchment paper. Foil either attracts or repels heat based on if it's the shiny/matte side, but parchment paper doesn't interrupt the flow of heat and also keeps the cookies from sticking to the sheet.

 If you like a strong peanut butter taste, definitely add more peanut butter as some comments recommend.  If you're worried about the cookies going flat, refrigerate them longer than one hour; mine weren't pancakes but next time I

They definitely were delicious cookies. Though mine came out really big and flat using the tablespoon, they filled they entire sheet pan. The second pan I just used my hand to make them about half size, didn't seem to make much of a difference. I thought it was because I put the butter in last by mistake but, after reading a lot of reviews, I see it didn't matter.

This recipe is way too thin for me and they come out so dry. I'm going to do what others said and add more peanut butter and flour, but I don't feel like I should have to fiddle with a recipe so much like that. Tastes alright, but not a big fan.

Absolutely fantastic recipe! I didn't have enough ingredients and only made half the amount, and it still came out great. I know people hate changing the recipe, but I added a teaspoon of vanilla. Not an absolute major change and can be easily omitted. and one more thing- after mixing the ingredients, I refrigerated the dough for an hour just to make sure it was firm. It baked very nicely! This recipe will be my go-to from now on!

This is perfect as written. Don't add more PB or flour, it doesn't need it. Written as is, perfect. Don't squish or flatten the dough to make crisscosses, just lightly press. Remember to sift your dry ingredients. This is an easy recipe, yet the cookies are soft inside, with a slight crust outside, delicious.

I followed the instructions with the added flour and peanut butter. At one point I put 2 pans in the oven and they got crispy. So from that point forward I just did 1 pan at a time. These turned out AMAZING! Shared them with the neighborhood.

I was getting confused with the changes people were making to the recipe and just wanted to try the recipe as it was written.  I followed directions explicitly.  To experiment, the first cookies I made were made with a melon baller on the small side, used a fork as stated in the directions to flatten them a little. These cookies seemed a little crumbly, so second try I made medium sized balls, these cookies were perfect.  The third try I made them bigger and they came a much bigger, thinner cookie which became harder the longer it sat.  I didn't have time to finish the whole batch so I froze what was left and baked them today using medium sized balls and they came out perfect.  So delicious.  Next time I think I will add a little more peanut butter because I like lots of nuts in them.  I didn't feel the need to add any more flour.  They were very tasty cookies according to my family and myself.  Love the recipe and glad I found the difference between making them too small and/or too big.  Thanks for the recipe.  And by the way, didn't miss vanilla at all.  PS took someone's advice and put the cookie dough back in the fridge between every batch.  This keeps the cookie dough very cold and easy to handle.

I'm not sure why anyone had problems with this recipe. I followed it to the letter and they were perfect. If they're flattening out too much, your balls are too big. They really need to be on the small side of an inch. I've uploaded a pic of the balls and flattened cookies before baking to help with sizing.

These cookies were good. Texture was very nice. The temp of 375 degrees seemed high but I followed the recipe and they turned out fine. Why I did not give 5 stars? These were more sweet than "peanut buttery". The only minor changes I made was to add 1/2 tsp salt and a 2 tbs vanilla. While this recipe was very good, it wasn't the best recipe  I have ever made.

As a 2 Michelin star chef, these cookies would not be served in my restaurant. The rat from Ratatouille would not recommend these. They were very dry and tasted like sawdust. The only reason I ate them was because I used expensive $$$$$ peanut butter and I was a hungry caterpillar.

Will be my "go to" recipe.  I did chill the dough for an hour before baking, did not roll in sugar but dipped my fork in sugar before press ing dough.  I did freeze some dough but found it changed the texture a bit and once baked they didn't look as good either. Still tasted good but wouldn't give them to company, lol.

These were awesome cookies!  I didn't bother rolling them into balls and dipping them in sugar but instead just spooned them onto the cookie sheet and pressed them with a fork.  I added a little extra flour to make sure they kept their shape.  I made these for my wedding and all the guests raved about them.  Every last one was gobbled up.  Will definitely make again!

Great flavor after increasing peanut butter and flour as suggested. You definitely have to decrease the temperature. My first batch looked beautiful until I flipped one over and it was black.

I made these cookies recently but instead of using ordinary peanut butter I used M&S peanut butter with pecans and maple syrup, delicious. Will definitely make these again, 
I also added a little more flour.

a great simple recipe the first time I made them I used coconut oil instead of butter, this time I used a 50/50 butter coconut oil mix.
Even better richness of butter with the subtle flavours of coconut and peanut complimenting each other.

The taste is really really good. BUT these will flatten out like little pancakes if you don't refrigerate longer. Put mine in the fridge, set the timer for an hour and laid them out. I followed the recipe exactly and they all ran together and spread out a TON! And I thought I made them small! Next pan I rolled even smaller and didn't even do the cross cross pattern. They turned out tasty but very thin. Even on a larger pan only put like 6 or 8 (if your doing them super small). The spreading of these little suckers will surprise you!  Also, I didn't have crunchy so I used smooth and I used about a teaspoon of vanilla, as I always throw a bit in almost everything when baking. Very good but I urge longer refrigeration! I've already had 3 and my husband had 7! Beast mode!

This is my second review on these cookies. The first time I made alterations like others have suggested.  And the cookies were good but they reminded me more of a sugar cookie texture and were missing some of the peanut butter flavor. This time I made them just as the recipe shows without any alterations.  I must say that these are delicious!!!!

This is a great recipe. I read some reviews about the cookies going flat. I have found when making cookies that beating the butter sugar and eggs until fluffy, then add the dry ingredients mixing only until incorporated, no longer! Keeps them from becoming flat. Over mixing dry ingredients can make tough cookies.

They are very good, but I added my own twist and put chocolate chips. I made four dozens with the correct amount of everything, instead of two. Would make again

After reading the reviews and seeing all of the changes others made I decided to make them exactly as written only adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla and one cup of mini chocolate chips per preference.  Wanted to see if it needed improving before doing so.  The only thing I would do differently is maybe add another half cup of peanut butter. These were easy to make and I chilled the dough for about  3 hours. 
I baked them in a convection oven for 10 minutes.  I gently made my marks with a fork without pushing them down flat  
My cookies did not spread and flatten as others complained about .  I grate my cold butter and then mix it just enough to blend as I find if I overmix butter or let it get too soft the cookies tend to spread and flatten.  I would definitely make these again.  I got 40 cookies from one recipe as I am using them for a party, otherwise I would have made them much larger.  Unfortunately I only had smooth peanut better, but I would definitely buy chunky to make these again .
Thank you Shirley!  Your cookies were fine without all of the changes others suggested. There is another recipe posted  by Chef John which is exactly the same  ingredients,  just smaller amounts of ingredients that has rave reviews without all of the tips to change it.  I went with this one as I knew would make more cookies .

I followed the recipe exactly using creamy peanut butter and later chopped some fresh peanuts and added them to the mix.   I baked accordingly to the directions and my family loves them. Very simple, very easy to make. Definitely one to added to my binder of recipes under cookies.

What's so great about this recipe (besides being ultra-easy) is that I can make the dough, keep it in the fridge and make fresh baked cookies every day for a FEW days. We all know nothing's better than warm cookies right out'a the oven! Especially when there's a coooold glass 'o milk sittin' there waiting ...

These consistently come out crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Perfect!!!

One addition I make: When I roll the dough into balls, I also roll them in sugar (yes, sugar!) then fork 'em.  Seriously, what's another gram of sugar? Maybe this is what makes them crunchy . . .

I would not recommend this recipe for newbies. The key is to shape the dough into smaller spheres so that each of the cookies do not melt into each other.

Taste is great! Nice and nutty because of the crunchy peanut butter.

Perfect for my niece's birthday party.

These are easy and delicious. I used a hand mixer to mix peanut butter, softened butter, sugars and chunky peanut butter. Then one at a time I beat in eggs,  vanilla extract, baking powder and baking soda. Stirred in flour. Chilled for 30 mins. My only suggestion is not to press fork all the way into the cookie dough. bake 7 mins tops. baking longer will cause cookies to thin out and spread. Yummy!

The dough was a little sticky even after being in the fridge for an hour, but these were really good. It actually makes about 50 cookies. Also I would recommend dipping the fork in sugar before using it so it doesn't stick.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written, except that I halved it. Halved, it made 30 or so. I baked them for 9 minutes and left them on the cookie sheet for a minute or two before removing to the cooling rack. They taste delicious and are very soft if eaten soon after baking. They do get a little crisper with time but still have a good texture. This is exactly how I expect a peanut butter cookie to turn out. Certainly ovens and personal taste vary, but  in my opinion, this is a great classic cookie.

Definitely had to add more peanut butter but it was a great recipe. I sifted the flour (whole wheat), sifted the baking soda and powder, and sifted salt. They were tasty, light in consistency, and sat light on the stomach. I did not press the fork in very much. They are darker tasting but still a little sweet (I choose to use stevia so I just added a 1/2 cup instead of a full cup.)

The cookies were okay, but needed more depth. I added vanilla and sprinkled it with brown sugar, which helped, but next time,  I would use less butter and more peanut butter, perhaps freshly ground peanuts. (Other recipes add peanut butter chips, but gross.)

This is an excellent recipe, which I have made several times. I always add about 1/4 cup additional peanut butter for a richer peanut butter taste.

This is the best peanut butter cookie ever! I have been making this exact recipe for over 40 years. I do add 1 tsp. Vanilla. That is the Only change. As I read some of the comments I keep thinking they might be using a different peanut butter or different flour. It does make difference. Adjusting either or both can make a difference of the density they prefer. Great cookie!

Heres  the problem with this recipe....BUTTER! I have used the basic same recipe for decades except my recipe  uses SHORTENING and its perfect! 
I found that if I did use butter....the only changes needed are to use all brown sugar instead of 1/2 white 1/2 brown......and I lowered the temp to 350..........Perfect!!

The best! I would certainly make it again. I only had smooth peanut butter so I put a handful of peanuts in a food processor and added them rover the recipe.

These cookies are perfect as is without any changes. I see some reviews advising changes to this cookie and I am here to say that I made them following the recipe exactly, and they turned out perfect! They came out crisp but also chewy without being doughy, as some have stated. They are not a thick cookie which is fine with me, and the flavor is wonderful. Honestly the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made.

Best peanut butter cookies I ever made. Taste just like my Grandmother's. The only thing I changed was substituting creamy peanut butter for crunchy because I only had creamy. Really took me back. Also the dough freezes really well if you want to make some later. It is a big recipe.

Really good and easy.  I didn't have crunchy peanut butter so I used the creamy I had on hand instead but added 1/4 cup more peanut butter and 1/4 cup more flour.  Everything else was exactly as recipe, they turned out great!  moist, soft, great flavor, not flat at all.

I've made these twice, and both family and friends loved them.  I rolled the dough balls in granulated sugar before placing them on the cookie sheet, for a little something extra.  If you don't mind taking a bit of extra time, that's nice.  I chilled them for longer than one hour - probably about 4 hours on one batch, and overnight on the other.  That may be why mine did not over-flatten like some of the negative reviewers' did.  Also be sure not to press them too flat with your fork, and don't over-bake.  I forgot to make the criss-cross on top, on a couple of trays, before baking.  The cookies still came out great -- but they will develop little cracks on top as they bake, if you forget to flatten with your fork in the criss-cross pattern before baking.  I'll probably try using more peanut butter and less butter next time, following some suggestions in the top-rated reviews.

Great recipe. I followed the advice to add 1/2 cup flour. I think they would have turned out okay but possibly not as fluffy without the extra flour. I also used margarine vs butter because that's what I had.

These cookies are amazing. I've made them twice now and they always come out perfect. Second time I added chocolate and peanut butter chips and it makes them that much better. Perfectly crisp around the edges and chewy in the middle. Baked at 350 for 9 mins.

Very disappointed.  First off, this cookie recipe has entirely too much butter in it, which could explain why my cookies were flat, tough, gross discs. Next time I am going to omit 1/2 a cup of butter and increase the flour to three cups because the dough as way too soft even after being in the fridge overnight.  I added more flour when I noticed the bad consistency, and only half of my cookies came out the way they should have.

Very pleased! I used creamy peanut butter (what I had) and followed the advice in the comments and added 1/4 cup of  peanut butter as well as flour. My family and friends loved it, but I thought it could have more of a peanut butter taste, so I'll add a couple of more tablespoons next time!

I made these cookies exactly to recipe and they came out terrific!  I used real butter so I did not add salt (except a shake of some) and I never had to fridgerste.  Rolled in sugar prior to Pressing with a fork.  Baked 9 minutes at 375.  Very yum!  And a lot...6 dozen or so!

Tasted the better the next day as the flavors mellowed out and the texture set.  Added additional 1/2 cup flour and 1/4 cup creamy pb but would use chunky next time. Baked for 9 min for soft cookies 10-11 min for crispy. Didn't like it in rolled sugar as it's already sweet enough. Used a 1-1/2" cookie scoop which yielded 50 cookies.

Will make these again! Yum. I did add, as others suggested another 1/2 cup peanut butter and  1/4 to 1/2 cup flour. Pressed only slightly with fork, left lots of room to spread out, ping pong size  ball of dough makes a large cookie.

Delicious perfect peanut butter cookies! The only thing I did differently was less sugar, 1c brown & 1/2c white, and I used creamy Adams natural peanut butter. I think these might be the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had!

The cookies came out great. Only thing I would do is add a touch more peanut butter. Other than at I would recommend it.

I have made these before and they are my husband's favorite cookie!  I have also made them with the recommendation from other reviewers of adding the extra flour and peanut butter.  But I much prefer the original recipe.  Yes the cookies are thinner but taste better but I will say that the extra flour and peanut butter add ons do make a prettier and thicker cookie.  Which would probably be better for sharing.

Awesome cookies! They're everything you could ever want from a peanut butter cookie! Before I made them, I had read many comments saying that they were a tad thin after they were baked, but I didn't have any problems with the current recipe.

When pressing the cookies down, keep a small plate of water to wipe your fork between cookies. This will help it from sticking and keep a good peanut butter cookie shape.

Great recipe - only reason I give it 4 stars is because I used the recipe alterations given from others (extra 1/4c of flour & peanut butter, plus some vanilla extract). 

Baked tablespoon-sized dough balls for about 11 mins and they came out perfectly with a crispy edge and soft center! Will definitely be keeping this recipe.

I used salted butter and skipped the salt, and also used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy. I rolled them in sugar before placing in the oven. They turned out great! I had no issues with having flat cookies like other reviewers have said. Just don't press them down thin when using the fork and they will come out perfectly!

Finally. Peanut butter cookies that aren't too salty tasting. I added the previously recommended extra 1/4 cup flour & 1/4 cup peanut butter, & 1 tsp. vanilla. I also used half extra crunchy peanut butter & half regular. The cookies came out chewy and delicious. This one's a keeper!

Delicious! As suggested by others, I added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter and 1/4 cup flour. I baked for 9 minutes. After cooling for a few minutes, the cookies turned out perfectly chewy.

Love the taste, and how its crunch but soft, the only problem is when rolling it so small i have at least four pans of cookies and thats A LOT of cookies to keep around the house! 

Other then that i roll the cookies a little larger and i am very happy.

Any recipe that I have to fight with or make so many changes to get a cookie isn't worth it. I grabbed the recipe without reading the reviews. Should have done that first. The recipe the way it stands does not work without either adding more moisture or having too much moisture and adding flour. Won't be using this one again, results are just to inconsistent.

This a great recipe when you tweak it just a little bit. I added an extra 1/2 cup  of peanut butter and an extra 1/2 cup flour. I used salted butter and omitted the extra salt. The dough needs to be refrigerated for far more than an hour, overnight works perfectly. With these changes my cookies came out fluffy and delicious.

Really enjoyed this recipe close to "as is". I did not add extra flour or vanilla as other reviewers but I did eyeball the peanut butter and very well could have added at least an extr 1/4C. I chilled my dough overnight. The result was a well-balanced, flavorful cookie. The cookies did not spread excessively, maintained the classic cross cross pattern and baked beautifully at 375 for about 9-10 min. I made half the dough with peanut butter morsels and that was also delicious but the base recipe was really perfect as is!

I use 1 cup Splenda brown sugar baking blend in place of the brown and white sugar. My diabetic husband counts one cookie as 17 carbs on his diet. Cookies are scooped out with a 1/8 cup ice cream dipper to make the balls.

I followed the recipe except using creamy  peanut butter instead of crunchy and crisco instead of butter due to my butter allergy. The cookies came out perfectly and were richly delicious. Rolling by rounded teaspons, it made 41 large cookies with baking time of 11-12 minutes. I left one tray in too long but that was baker error, not recipe error, and they still tasted great.

The batter alone was delicious, the cookie is AWESOME! YOu know when your teenage brother asks for more...I didn't find that the batter was to thin or to thick, it was just right for me.

This is my new go to recipe for peanut butter cookies.  Soft and chewy and very tasty.
I actually made them a second time and added Hershey kisses 2 minutes before they were done.
This is a much better pb cookie than the one I used to use for that recipe

So I usually watch out for comments, when I made this recipe I also used 1/2cup more of peanut butter AND flour. Cooked on 350•F for 10 minutes. Turned out fantastically, perfect thickness and chewiness. Also with the ingredient alteration, I was able to get 3 batches (32 cookies) out of it! Happy baking

These were great, I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy, bake for 11 minutes other than I followed the recipe.  During the holiday I want to try to make them again I want to add vanilla extract as I am a big fan and white chocolate chips cookies to see how they would turn out.  Thank you for sharing this recipe delicious ??

This recipe is good and simple to make.  I did follow other suggestions by adding just an extra spoonful of flour, and didn't use a fork to flatten the cookies (I left them alone).  I also made sure to leave them in the fridge for a full hour.  With this, I didn't have any issues with them being too flat.

This is my go to recipe.  I just made a few tweaks for my household.  I use 3/4 cup crunchy peanut butter,  1/4 cup creamy, and a splash of vanilla extract. I don't wait the hour before I start cooking them. still comes out delicious!

Great recipe but unless you love super flat cookies, use shortening in place of the butter.   Or use 1/2 c shortening and 1/2 c butter.  (Using butter  instead of shortening in most cookie recipes will lead to flatter cookies).   Flavour is just as fabulous and cookie is more tender than if you add more flour to get a thicker cookie.  And you can still see fork or  crisscross lines in finished product.

Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe. I did not use chunky peanut butter.  I made this as traditional peanut butter cookie and also for peanut butter blossoms. My husband and kids love these cookies!!

Perfect! I added dry ingredients until just mixed and didn't overbeat. Fluffy and not flat. I used a small scoop, no crisscross and baked for 8 minutes on parchment paper. Half recipe made just over 3 dozen.

My son loves this peanut butter cookie. I too add a little more peanut butter because we love it, vanilla, & a little more flour. I don’t wait or chil my dough either. I pop them in after I make them and they always come out AWESOME. They keep their shape & taste soft & chewy!

Amazing! ...I followed the recipe but added 1tsp Vanilla and chocolate chips. I also used only 1 cup of sugar.

Wasn't too peanut-buttery just as I like it. I probably should've removed it from the oven sooner but it still turned out soft inside and a bit crunchy outside

This was my first cookie ever and it was delish!

Very delicious! I did what a lot of the comments said and added 1/4 extra of flour and peanut butter, and some vanilla. I also added white chocolate chips! Amazing! I had to cook for about 15 min, but I'm in san diego.

Absolutely the best .  No need to try any other.  Make them plain, with crunch peanut butter,  with peanut butter  or chocolate pieces, or put a Hershey  Kiss in the middle......it all works.

The flavor of these were amazing. Surprisingly, they weren't overwhelmingly sweet. I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy (because thats what I had in the cupboard!) 
While mine didn't get thin like many other reviews say, they did get hard. I tried turning the heat down for a batch and cooking them for less time on another batch and they all turned out very crisp. 
Still good, but I'm still on the hunt for the perfect soft peanut butter cookie.

I followed the recipe with the exception of using 3/4 cup of peanut butter, thats all I had. The mix turned out to be smooth, creamy.  I baked cookies for 15-20 minutes to be chewy and soft.  It does call for a lot of sugar. If I were to make again, I would use 2/4 cup white and brown for 1 cup total.

Tried the recipe for the first time today and the cookies turned out amazing! I read the reviews before I made them and added 1/2 more flour, tsp of vanilla, and about a 1/4 more PB. I used a combination of smooth and crunchy PB. Very tasty!

I love the recipe, it was easy to make and the only difference was to use creamy and not crunchy peanut butter, my husband likes creamy, but as for me if I make a batch for myself, it will be crunchy, thank you

The dough was a little crumbly than I'm used to but it turned out ok. I added chocolate chips at the very end. Yum!
Definitely ADD more peanut butter, next time I think I'll add 1/4 cup of creamy. Overall they tasted like there was too much flour is that's possible.

I made it exactly as described.   I used all natural nothing added peanut butter and I would consider adding a bit more sugar/brown sugar or using regular store brand peanut butter next time. But they were good!

I will definitely make this again.  I used half butter and half coconut oil instead of all butter.  Other than that I made it as written.  I consider this one a keeper.

Made A LOT of cookies. I read that many others were saying the cookies were too thin, so I added a fourth cup more flour, added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, and rolled each ball in white sugar before placing it on the pan, making a criscross pattern on each ball of dough. Those were my only changes. OH! I used creamy peanut butter and loved these cookies. I even saved about a cup of the batter by rolling it into a log shape and froze it for enjoying later. I figure I can get away with this since the recipe calls for refrigerating the dough anyway - thus the cookies bake the best when they're from cold dough. I plan to let the dough 'thaw' in the fridge overnight before baking the next day. It'll be nice to get my peanut butter cookie fix this easy! Great recipe overall!

Best peanut butter cookies!! I added 1/4 cup more flour, 1/2 to 1 cup more of peanut butter, and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Also, I used creamy peanut butter instead.

Turned out super dry and crumbly. Not good. Was kinda embarrassed bringing them to a work potluck, but they were liked by coworkers, it seemed. Wouldn't make again.

I needed to make cookies for the high school soccer team that my husband coaches. Big boys with big appetites. Forgot about peanut allergies but a quick trip to the grocery store will rectify that one. Anyway, after reading all the comments, I did add 1/2 cup flour, split the difference in peanut butter and added an extra 1/3 cup, and also a heaping tsp. vanilla. And leave the dough in the frig over night! As to baking times, I think it depends on the type of baking sheets you're using. Anywhere between 9-10 minutes. I also used a melon baller to keep them small and uniform. They came out perfect and absolutely YUMMY!! The boys should be happy. Especially if they win!

This is the first time I made these cookies.  They turned out thick,  hard on the outside and soft on the inside.  Perfect!  I read a previous review and decided to change a few things.  I used 1.5 cups of peanut butter, .5 cup of oatmeal, and 1 tsp. of vanilla.  I will definitely make these peanut butter cookies again:)

This is a great recipe.  I followed other's advice and increased the amount of peanut butter by 1 cup and added 1 tsp vanilla extract, but did not add any extra flour. I chilled the dough for an hour, made the cookies using a rounded 1/2 tbsp of dough and cooked 10 mins at 350 degrees. The cookies did not come out thin.  So far, I have made 4 dozen cookies and have 2 1/2 rolls of dough in my freezer just from one batch of cookie dough.

These are our favourite peanut butter cookies. I usually roughly measure the flour and peanut butter so there may be additional amounts as well as 1 tsp of vanilla. They don't last long  in our house.

You've got to follow this recipe to the letter to get perfect peanut butter cookies.  Any slight deviation can ruin the perfection.  My husband LOVES peanut butter cookies, and any time I had a little too much floor, or don't get the butter right....you can sooo tell!

I made  these cookies exactly as the recipe stated. I had no problem at all like others  had mentioned .  I'm not sure what I did different then they did but, I'm glad they turned out great.  I may try adding more PB, flour  & vanilla the next time just to see if  there was any difference in it.  It also made  ( for me ) 4 1/2 dozen cookies. So, I'd say that was pretty good. These are great cookies and I will definitely be making them again. :) Everyone at the party really liked them too. So that 's a plus.  ;)

This is an excellent recipe! Slightly bland  ONLY for a true peanut butter cookie fan, so like other reviewers add 1/4c. peanut butter. Nothing else needed, just follow recipe carefully. I don't like baking with salt, so I used salted butter. Also, I am not fond of crunchy peanut butter and used creamy Jiffy. VERY soft perfect cookie!

Best peanut butter cookie recipe!!!  I followed other reviewers and added 1/2cup more peanut butter and 1/2cup more flour.  I did not have crunchy peanut butter on hand so I used creamy pb but we did have some Virginia peanuts in which we crushed and topped each cookie with nuts before baking.  Yum!!!  My husband and I loved these.

Took others suggestions and added 1/4c extra flour, 1/2c peanut butter and 1tsp vanilla extract. Didn't have butter so used Becel and omitted salt. Used smooth peanut butter. Others say crunchy is better. I didn't flatten too much. Dipped top of ball in sugar before flattening. Pulled it out when still a bit soft in middle - it's cooked. 350 for 9mins. It will burn if more than 11 mins.

Delicious peanuty cookies. I didn't sift the dry ingredients and didn't use vanilla as others suggested. I did use 3/4c more peanut butter . These cookies do harden a bit as they cool so if you want softer cookies, I would suggest following another review and cooking them on 6-7 minutes. Great recipe. Will certainly make these again and again.

These turned out delish.  I too increased the PB by about 1/2 cup and increased flour about 1/4 cup.  I also used regular PB and added PB chips to them.

Didn't have crunchy peanut butter on hand but followed recipe to the T with plain peanut butter.  It came out tasty & It didn't  have an overly sweet taste like most cookies that I love which is good for the kids and diabetics in the house.
It also came out with a shortbread type texture which was also good and for some reason filling.

In my opinion you can probably call this a "sugar buster" dessert.

The first batch I made, I followed the recipe exactly, but they came out a little dry and crispy. For the rest, I baked them at 325 for 12 minutes, and they had a much more "melt in your mouth" feel than crunch. I'd definitely recommend lowering the temperature and adding a minute or two for extra deliciousness.

First time baking so i didnt have a mixer. I used more flour & creamy peanut butter & substituted sugar for Truvia & Splenda/Brown Sugar blend & added Vanilla Extract & Reeses peanut butter chips. Turned out so Delish! but next time I will flatten the cookies more. Turned out beautiful with the criss cross design.

The cookies cane out too soft and we're just falling apart. I should have read the comments before I baked them. Next time I think I will add more flour and and more peanut butter

I have to admit, they didn't come out as I expected. Maybe it's because I haven't much experience with cookies. This was my first try on my own.  But I did follow the directions. Hopefully if I plan on making another batch some other time, I will be able to do better or add my own changes to make it more tasty. Other than that, very good and I enjoyed them.

Absolutely the best peanut butter cookie recipe I've come across! The reviews others had posted were right on. Adjustments had to be made. I added 1/2 cup more peanut butter ( I used creamy and it worked fine) and 1/2 cup more flour. Also 1- 1 1/4 tsp vanilla. Delicious!!

On the advice of others I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and peanut butter as well as chocolate chips and vanilla.  They turned out good but could use more flavor, maybe a bit less flour and more vanilla, maybe even more peanut butter.  I didn't bother to refrigerate the dough and I added a couple extra minutes to baking time, the turned out like the picture, not flat at all, they look as peanut butter cookies should.

These cookies were absolutely amazing, so peanut buttery but not overwhelming at all. From the moment I tasted the batter I knew these would be excellent. They're also very easy to control as in placing them in different racks in the oven can control how chewy they can be, etc. They can be thin but not easily crumbly, it's not hard to change, since you can just add some more flour.

I only had about 3/4 cup of butter, no baking soda, and only baked them at 350 degrees. They still came out AMAZING. I cooked them in enough time to make the edges have a slight crunch but still perfectly soft.

Perfect!  I changed the recipe with a swap.  If you don't want as much butter and want these cookies to rise more like chewy puffed up cookies, then swap a stick of butter (1/2 cup) for another half cup of peanut butter.  Either way you do it, it's a classic cookie, and if you are looking to get rid of extra peanut butter in your cabinet, try the swap.

I made these cookies and gave them filling using this frosting recipe (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/84429/fluffy-peanut-butter-frosting/); they were perfect! They reminded me of girl scout savannah cookies. I will definitely be making these again.

It is sure important to refrigerate the dough and not press down the cookies too flat!

I used smooth, natural peanut butter and they turned out great.  Baked for 8 min at 375 for nice, chewy cookies.

I have made this recipe twice now. The first time I followed the instructions to the letter and the second time I did it a little different. The second time I didn't refrigerate them, and they turned out much softer and chewier. I also upped the peanut butter and flour a bit the second time.

These turned out yummy, I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and an extra 1/4 cup of pb, and 1 tsp vanilla based on the reviews. Next time I might try adding only 1/4 cup extra flour.

Made this recipe today with no changes except to refrigerate the dough overnight. The cookies turned out beautifully and we're not flat at all. I dipped the dough balls in flour and then made the crisscross with a fork.  I made the cookies a bit smaller than usual as they were being given as gifts, and from a double batch, I made 12 dozen cookies! And did I mention that they are delicious?

Great recipe! I needed a recipe that used butter since my normal one uses crisco and I want to stay away from it. I did take the advice of other reviewers and added 1/4 cup of extra flour and peanut butter. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla. I left in the fridge for about an hour and a half but I probably could have skipped it. I also replaced about 1/3 stick of butter with coconut oil. I do this for most recipes to help keep moisture and cut out some bad fats. I cooked at 350F for 9-10 min. as others have. The one thing I would have also changed was the amount of salt. They came out way too salty for me. As others stated, a good base recipe.

These are so tasty, and I did not need to change one thing (except I didn't have crunchy peanut butter so I used creamy). I baked them on a silpat and they turned out the perfect thickness and size. The key is to start with COLD dough; refrigerate for at least an hour, if not more, before rolling and baking. To get great fork marks, wet the fork and dip it in sugar.

My family loved it.
Just that I had to lower to 350 degree F and cook it for 15 mins.
375 seemed too high for my oven.

I've made these a couple of times and I usually do half batches, so I use 1 1/2 cups of flour and 3/4 cup of peanut butter and just halve the rest of the ingredients. To prevent the cookies from flattening out while cooking, I only cook one cookie sheet of cookies at a time. The other rack in my oven I move to the top most place and cover it with aluminum foil to disperse the heat in my oven better and so it doesn't blast down on the cookies, and I've found that that usually does the trick. If they are too thick, I'll flatten them out with a spatula and cook them for a minute more. I made two half batches yesterday, the second had dark chocolate chips in it and they are really good.

I made the recipe -doubling the ingredients and adding 1 egg because our large eggs are not that big.  This should have made 48 cookies.  It made 150! Not too sure why.  cookies were really tasty!  Soft and fluffy dough. Crispy brown cookies. Everyone loved them! Glad it made a whole bunch as they didn't last long!!

First off, very simple recipe. Just make sure you cream the butter and sugar long enough. Very important step. 

If you use high quality ingredients and follow these directions exactly, you'll get the best peanut butter cookie I've ever tried. 

The only change I made is I rolled each scoop in sugar before putting on parchment lined cookie sheet. Then flattened with fork. 

I used a #50 scoop and got one short of five dozen. 

Enjoy!

Followed recipe EXACTLY, but only baked them for 8-9 minutes then left on cookie sheet for 1 more minute before moving to a wire rack to cool. They are PERFECT! I don't think they're too thin at all. When pressing with the fork I keep them about 1/2" thick and they bake down to still just over 1/4" after they rest and cool.  We like them slightly chewy so this makes them just perfect for that. No changes to ingredients or measurements is needed. Thanks for the recipe. We enjoyed them (and the cold dough while trying to wait for them to cook).  **The recipe yielded over 50 cookies about 2-3" diameter.**

I finished making  the dough and thought that the dough seemed way too soft, so I read the reviews before baking them.  I decided to add more flour, as others did, and then was easily able to handle them without putting them in the fridge first.  I'm not sure this is the classic pb cookie recipe, because I made them a lot years ago when my kids were young and don't remember ever having to refrigerate them first. I just think the recipe is 1/4 o 1/2 cup short on flour.

I selected this recipe because I like peanut butter cookies,  and the ones I made turned out great. I used a bit more flour and id suggest others to add more peanut butter.

the cookies came out crumbly and a bit dry which was unexpected given the extreme about of butter and peanut butter in the recipe.  I will admit my execution of the rolling cookies into small balls was not how i did it, instead , i rolled the dough into a loaf and froze it, then cut  cookie sized slices and put them on the pan then used the fork to score them.  perhaps the density of the cookie needs the ball method instead.

I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour like previous comments said to do and I still had really flat cookies. I ended up not pressing the cookies, lowering the temperature to 350, and cooked them for 12 minutes so they wouldn't be flat. They did taste really good once I made those changes.

I'm overall very pleased with this recipe. 

Standard weights for flour seem to vary from website to website, anywhere from 120 grams per cup to 150 grams, so for this recipe I tried 360 grams of flour (144 per cup), and I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. I baked them without flattening them first, then flattened them slightly while they were cooling. With this amount of flour, the cookies held their shape well and were the perfect texture. Note: It's really important not to over bake these. Also note: I got more like 4 dozen from this recipe instead of the two dozen indicated in the recipe yield.

I may try to reduce the amount of flour next time to see if I can get a  more intense peanut butter flavor without changing the cookie texture.

I was afraid of the cookies flattening since there was so much butter including the fat in the PB, so I added around 1/4 c flour and ~1/4 c sugar. I scooped a tbsp and pressed down each to around 1/4 in thickness and they ended up fluffy and moist.

I used cannabutter instead of regular butter, added 2 tsp vanilla and added another 1/2 cup peanut butter to this recipe. It is a great recipe that I have used before, but for regular cookies. Cannabutter is slightly runnier, which is why I added some more peanut butter. The vanilla, I add to everything...whether it calls for it or not lol. Thank you!

Reading reviews, I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and peanut butter, but, upon making them, discovered they needed more salt. I think next time i will use salted butter instead and see how they turn out then. To fix the problem with the current batch I sprinkled salt on the cookies before they went in the oven, and that made a huge difference.

Tastes great and came out perfectly! They're crispy around the edges and chewy inside. I made 1" balls and they came out about 1/2" high. I followed the directions exactly except that I put the dough balls in the freezer for 5 minutes before I put them into the oven. If you are having an issue flat cookies, the dough just needs longer to cool -- especially if the weather is warm!

I made these following the recipe exactly. The only thing I added was a teaspoon of vanilla and I used creamy peanut butter because that was what I had on hand. They were fantastic! Crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside. So yummy! Next time, I'll use crunchy peanut butter like the recipe calls for. I think that would make them even better!

Used creamy peanut butter, salted butter, decreased salt to 1/8 tsp, increased peanut butter to 1.5 cups, increased flour to 3 cups and added 1 tsp of vanilla. I used my cookie scoop to drop them on the baking sheet then flattened them with a fork dipped in sugar to make the classic criss cross pattern. Great cookies!

I don't like peanut butter cookies, at all. This was a very good peanut butter cookie. I stuck to the recipe but thought it needed something (probably b/c I don't like peanut butter cookies). Next time I will probably add chocolate somewhere, or dip them in chocolate when done.

This was my 11 year old daughter's first, completely on her own, cooking/baking experience. She did SO well. They were delicious. Only lasted about a day and a half with three of us eating them. We will be making them on a weekly basis. :-) Thanks so much for the great recipe.

I make this standard recipe a few times a year.  My family and friends beg for the recipe, but I found this recipe a while ago!  I was surprised everything was almost the same when I looked over this recipe.  This is absolutely delicious.  I use smooth creamy peanut butter, but it is absolutely delicious and easy to make!  I also only use a teaspoon of baking soda and a teaspoon of vanilla.  I use 3 and a half cups of flour.

They were a little him I did the same added more flour. Plus it helped with not putting the dough in the fridge for an hour. When you want cookies now it's easier to thicken the dough up. I also added Reese's pieces and they came out yummy

Made the following changes - for the peanut butter I used planters cinnamon granola raisin nut peanut butter - used full jar of it.  Also when I measured flour the cups were slightly heaping.  Chilled the dough for 2 days. Turned out great.

Literally perfect! The only thing I didn't do was sift the dry ingredients. Not needed. Just follow the recipe, cook for ten minutes and let sit on the pan, return about ten minutes later and pop them off the pan! I might add some chocolate chips next time.

I took a lot of the reviewers advice and used 1/4 extra flour and 1/4 extra peanut butter. I also sprinkled some sugar on top of the cookies instead of rolling them before baking them.  I also put the dough in the refrigerator for 1 hour prior to baking them. 

That being said, they  were just  ok. Not what I would call phenomenal like one of the reviewers wrote.  Although I did like the fact that the cookies weren't greasy as some of the other peanut butter cookie recipes I tried.  I may just have to tweak it to my liking the next time I make these again. 

It was missing something that's for sure .

I followed the recipe exactly.  Recipe made about 4 dozen cookies. The cookies are a bit thin, and they were not peanut buttery enough.  Next time I am going to add an extra half cup of peanut butter, and maybe some more flour as others have mentioned.  They get crunchy, so on the second batch I baked them to where they looked just slightly under cooked, and those ones stayed soft in the middle.  The edges still crunched, but they were much better that way.

I added chocolate chips to this recipe and also cooked them for 12 minutes instead of 10 and let them sit on the hot pan for 10 minutes before removing them. I ended up with 36 cookies and they were absolutely yummy.

Cannot say enough good things about these cookies.  I NEVER eat PB cookies b/c I think they are dry and flavorless.  These have totally changed my mind.  Soft, moist, flavorful - heaven in a cookie.
The only thing I did differently was instead of 'forking' balls of dough, I rolled them and then flattened them slightly with my hand (like little patties).  Then I 'forked' them.  Baked for 9:30 min.  These will definitely be part of my cookie repertoire.

I followed the advice of others and used a little extra peanut butter and flour. I only had creamy peanut butter so I used that. I used my small cookie scoop and baked at 375* for 10 min on my stoneware and the cookies came out great!!! I will be making these again soon :)

I completely disagree with the reviewers on here who think this recipe needs more flour.  This is my go-to Peanut Butter Cookie recipe, and I follow it  to a "T."  However, whenever I make ANY cookie batter, I always put it in the fridge with cling wrap over the top, for a few hours, or even overnight.  That way the butters get solid again,  and when I scoop it out, it is easy to handle. I This results in a perfect cookie, in my opinion, where the outside edges are somewhat crunchy, while the inside is chewy and the cookie practically melts in your mouth.

Sorry but these might be better than my grandmas... I added about an extra 1/4 C flour and an extra 1/2 C of PB, plus a splash of vanilla. Roll them around lightly in sugar, and press with a fork. I've already had 3 and I just made these 10 minutes ago!

Making these again today upon request of my ex-husband, for whom I still cook.  I make them really large for him.  They are soft and delicious.  He loves them.  They are everything you want your peanut butter cookies to be.  Delicious and soft.  Yum.

Like many others, I added a little vanilla, a 1/4 cup each of flour and peanut butter. 
I used half crunchy and half creamy. 
10 minutes at 375 was perfect. I let them sit in the cookie sheet for a couple minutes before putting them on the cooling rack. We loved them! Perfect!

This is a basic peanut butter cookie.  Chilling the dough was a setback not major as I am not a cookie baker. I need to read the entire recipe not just scan through.  One to grow on.
The recipe states 24 servings, I made 80 cookies. I guess I would ask how many cookies are in a serving. Like I said I don't bake cookies a whole lot, I looked at the mix and thought wow what big cookies these will be. So used a teaspoon. They spread out and truly bake at 375 for 10 minutes, no more than that. I used parchment paper to bake them on. I took them out of the oven, leave them on the bake tray for a minute or so, otherwise they are mushy and will fall apart.  I mixed them in my kitchen aid, creamed butter and sugars  prior to adding eggs and flour I put the mixer on high for about a minute to aerate the mixture added the balance of ingredients and ran it high once more.  The fork is just for the classic look. They will spread on their own if you choose not to do it.  Don't bake any longer than 10 minutes otherwise they will overbake. Cool and put in airtight containers. I had a few this morning with my coffee. Came out pretty darn good. 
Overall easy cookie and very tasty.

Very easy recipe - my daughter made the dough by herself, and they were delicous. The only thing we did differently was to add sugar to the top of the cookies before we made the criss cross pattern.

I've now made this recipe 4 times and every time the batch of cookies goes so quick, I rarely get one for myself.  I've made them for family get-togethers, just as a desert at home and recently made them into little football shaped cookies with white lacing & side striped frosting as highlights for a Superbowl party.  The folks at the party asked for the recipe and the platter was empty by half time.  A very easy and delicious recipe.  Most folks ask my wife for the recipe, but they're shocked when they're told it's a MAN who made them.  It's easy enough I can make them and get rave reviews. Thanks for making me look good.

These are the quintessential peanut butter cookies.  Crisp, buttery, crumbly.  My kids (and I) loved them!

I made these exactly to the recipe albeit using whole wheat white flour and they came out very nice.  Cooked 11 minutes and let cool in the pan for four minutes or so until placing on paper towels.  Was nice as I used stuff I had in my kitchen and did not have to go to the market.

I made this recipe with the changes suggested by a few reviewers (added 1/2C flour and 1/2C peanut butter).  I also left the dough in the fridge for 5 days (I was...busy I guess, ha!).  I ended up with 60 cookies!  What!  I wasn't expecting that many.  I even made the dough balls larger than 1".  Luckily these are really good for peanut butter cookies (I made them for a friend, I don't typically like them).  Since there were plenty of times to put cookies in the oven, I tried different things with each batch:

The first batch was rolled into balls and not pressed down (due to a recommendation from another reviewer).  They came out like flattened balls, which I actually kind of like because they are pretty soft in the middle.  They're cute one-bite cookies.  The second batch was slightly flattened before baking, they came out a little more flat than the first batch.  Two-bite cookies this time, still nice in the middle.  The third batch was pushed down with a fork, traditional style.  They came out looking crackled like typical peanut butter cookies, and the fork marks are sort of visible.  Still nice texture, not as much soft middle as the other batches (obviously).

All batches were taken out of the oven after 10min and immediately moved to a plate to cool.  My advice for avoiding flat, spread-out cookies is to refrigerate the dough for a while.

Husband and I loved these peanut butter cookies!  5 stars!  The first time I made the dough, I followed the printed recipe and we both thought the cookies were delicious; just not"peanut-y" enough.  Second time, I added a teaspoon of vanilla and the extra 1/2 cup of both peanut butter and flour advised by other reviewers, and I thought the dough was a little too dry -- it didn't "roll" into a ball that would hold together well and the dough would break apart when I tried to press the fork tines into the tops.  It was a little better when I pressed the balls into coarse sugar before using the fork, though.  I used my old round ice cream scoop for even-sized cookies.  Baked at 375 degrees for 11 minutes and they came out perfect!  This recipe is a winner!  5+ stars!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

The only change I made to this recipe is I added mini rolos to the middle of the cookies after removing from the oven. That made it over the top good!

They were delicious! They did flatten out a bit & harden up so I'll try adding an extra 1/2 cup of flour as recommend by other bakers, substitute a small portion of oil for the butter to make it moist & cool it in the fridge before baking. Got an add a boy from the guys at the "Firehouse" as they loved 'em!

These were awesome. The only thing I changed was add 1/2 coconut oil (extra virgin expeller pressed) & 1/2 butter. Also, I only added 1/2 of the baking soda. I'm picky with bakng/tasting cookies, and can always taste the baking powder.

Pretty good! Used coconut palm sugar in place of brown and baked for 9 mins on a parchment lined sheet. Great with a glass of cold milk :)

4 stars as it needed tweaking. Excellent flavor. I suggest taking others' recommendations and upping peanut butter by 1/2cup and flour by 1/4 cup. I also added a tsp of vanilla and baked at 350 for 10 min. These changes help keep the cookies from getting too flat. Come out soft and chewy. Thanks!

Excellent recipe, one of the best peanut butter cookie recipes I've found.  I halved the recipe and increased the flour by 1/4 cup and the peanut butter by 1/4 cup.  Threw in some chocolate chips.  Baked for 10 minutes.  They weren't quite as brown as I'd like but I was worried about overcooking them.  Will definitely make again!

This is a great recipe! I incorporated the additional 1/2 cup of pb and flour and the consistency of the dough seemed perfect! The first dozen may have been in the oven a little too long because the inside was just as firm as the outside of the cookie (no gooey middle). So for my second batch, I made sure to stand by the oven and take them out on time. However, even with the softer middle this time, the cookie still is a little crumbly and crunchy. If I wanted the whole cookie to be soft, should I have used less flour? Maybe 1/4 cup instead??

It was the best recipe. I recomend putting jam on top. However I would recommend using slightly softened butter so the dough is cold. And don't chill it in the fridge. First time I made them was without chilling them and they came out perfect. However I just made them after being chilled and they are crumbled and not to good.

These are perhaps the best peanut butter cookies I've ever tasted.   The dough didn't come out too thin but, I'm wondering if people aren't putting it in the fridge for an hour.

I thought these were OK. They lost their shape a little bit (they spread), and they didn't have the right texture or even peanut butter flavor. They also seemed too sweet. I'll find a different peanut butter cookie recipe next time.

I used less butter and a cup more peanut butter as well as a dash of vanilla. I find baking at 350 for about the same time works for me but then again Ive change the original instructions. Rolled in sugar then placed on the tray and pressed. Boom. Amazing cookies, but I know I can do better.

I added about two cups more of flour than the recipe calls for, and I also added two teaspoons of vanilla (the recipe didn't call for any at all, and I thought that it might need some). Cookies turned out great, and were delicious.

followed recipe exactly (except had creamy natural peanut butter and added 1 tsp vanilla) and they turned out great; used a scooper to measure balls for consistency and gently patted down before baking... DELICIOUS!

A great recipe but rating a 4 star because I didn't make exactly as recipe stated. However, after reading other reviews and adding 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup peanut butter, and 1 tsp. vanilla these came out fantastic. Not sure what would have happened had I not done the  changes. 
The baking time in recipe (10 min) was too long for me.  I use air-bake cookie sheets and usually have to add a few minutes to the time on recipes. At 9 minutes in, I checked and much to my surprise they were already getting brown. About 8-9 mins did it for me.

My favorite peanut butter recipe. Added a teaspoon of vanilla. The only trick to these cookies is creaming the sugar,butter and peanut butter at the same time and then individually add each egg and then adding the vanilla. After creamed slowly adding all mixed dry ingredients and you MUST allow it to sit in the fridge for an hour so the cookies cook without temperament.

I will definitely make this recipe again.  I have been using this recipe for years.  The only thing I change is the oven temp to 350 degrees because my oven seems to run hot and I cook for 7 minutes. Definitely not 10 minutes.  You CANNOT overcook  cookies.  They will taste burnt. I also add 1 teaspoon of lemon juice or I add cream of tarter if I have it.  It makes the cookies crispy around the edges but soft in the center.

I loved these cookies!  My six year old grandson helped with all the measurements and we had no issues. We couldn't be bothered with chilling the dough so we went straight to the shaping part of the recipe. We used a fork dipped in water to press them down a bit on sprayed baking sheets. As a side I should mention my kitchen, even with the oven on, was on the cool side. I also used creamy not crunchy peanut butter. And I made him sift the dry ingredients with a whisk. A little cooking spray on the hands kept the dough from sticking too much on our hands. ;)

This was my first time making these cookies.
I don't know if I would be able to make these again.
They did not turn out right, but I guess that is because that was my first time using this recipe. But overall the were okay for it being the first time making them.
Also it made more than i expected but that was a good thing.

O...M...G! These cookies got rave reviews from my guests. I hardly ever leave comments because I usually manage to mess up the recipe but I actually got this one right. Granted, you can not eat more than 2 of these a day without feeling your heart stop... but man are they worth it! The only think I did differently (unintentionally) was use creamy PB instead of crunchy. Can't wait to see how they taste with the crunchy. I would suggest adjust the cooking times and temps based on what you know of your oven. No 2 ovens are the same. For example, I had to bake mine on tin foil at 350 for 7 min. exactly. At 6 they're under cooked, at 8 or more they're burnt.

Turned out fantastic! Made a couple of changes, added a teaspoon of vanilla, added an extra 1/4 cup of flour, and used dark brown sugar (all I had). 

Baked them on convection at 350 for 9 minutes, then rotated 180 and baked for 2 more minutes.

They look like they came from a cooking magazine, so good!

I'm always trying different PB cookie recipes. I made a double batch for our hockey team, using the suggested extra flour and PB by 1/2 cup each. I added a hershey kiss to the center while they were still warm. 25 boys at 102 cookies!  They were all gone and I've shared the recipe with three others so far.

Soft and chewy. The only change I made was that I used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup soft margarine as I had no hard margarine on hand. I also added a tsp of maple flavoring. Turned out perfect!!! I did not cool the dough before baking. No offense but mine look better than the photo on here ;)

I have baked these to the recipe and they were fantastic. I like to experiment so for softer cookies I took half the white sugar away and replaced it with an equal amount of brown sugar. They were great. My next experiment was crispy cookies, so I  reversed the sugar ratio. These were fantastic also. It's a personal preference, but the original recipe is a great start. I use smooth organic pb and add 1 cup of chopped peanuts. I top each cookie with half a pecan. Delish! V

I took the advise from other reviews and changed the amount of peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups and 1 1/2 cups of flour. Added a mix of  white & chocolate chips. They came out perfect the best I have made. So delicious....my husband loves them.

Followed the recipe exactly and turned out some wonderful cookies. I refrigerated the dough overnight though to avoid thinning out the cookies as they baked (per other reviewers' suggestion).

The taste of these cookies is phenomenal!  The texture is wonderful, and they disappear at my house almost overnight.  I've made them three times, and I'm getting ready to take a batch to work tomorrow.

My first time making peanut butter cookies, so I stuck with the recipe called classic. I truly appreciate the recipe, but mine came out pancake looking. Is there anyway to make them look like the picture? I really made sure my measurements were all correct.
Thank you

These were really good cookies, however noticed with my oven I only needed to bake them for 8.50 mins.  Next time I would add about 1/2 cup more peanut butter, otherwise, wouldn't change a thing.

My husband has a sweet tooth that I am trying to curve by baking fresh for him instead of store bought. At least I know what is in the sweets he is eating, all natural and no additives.  He is also a very finicky cookie fan.  I had to do a lot of research before I found this recipe.  The last one I tried didn't even taste like peanut butter.  He gave this recipe two thumbs up!  
I didn't change anything about the recipe. I used an all natural organic peanut butter and organic sugar.  Using a stand mixer is a must.  I left the dough in the fridge all afternoon while we were out.  Then I used a cookie scoop and handled the dough as little as possible so that they were still cold and hard when they went into the oven.  They came out looking exactly like the photo and tasted very peanuty!  Thank you for sharing!!

I threw all ingredients into a bowl. I didn't follow the instructions or steps as the recipe  states and they turned out amazing. They weren't overly peanut buttery. The recipe also made about 8 dozen smaller sized cookies. I used creamy peanut butter and a bit of vanilla.

Needs more,peanut butter, not a strong peanut butter taste.
Makin it again, increasing peanut butter, some,flour to balance it. Should have read those ideas before making them.

These are the best peanutbutter cookies I've ever made.  I didn't have any problem with them being flat.  The butter mixture was really fluffy which I think made a difference.

Wonderful!  They are better than the Girl Scout cookies.  I usually halve the recipe and it makes about 2 dozen medium sized cookies.  They are crunchy around the outside, they brown magnificently on the bottom, and they are chewy.  When I store them I place a half slice of wheat bread in the container to maintain the chewy goodness.  A MUST TRY!

I have made this recipe many times over the course of two years without altering a single ingredient/measurement. I have been using light brown sugar and I highly doubt that. Also, I use a melon scoop for my "portions". It allows each cookie to be the perfect size and the same size. I'm sure plenty of you already do this, however I found it to make the mountain of dough this recipe makes a little less overwhelming! Delicious recipe!

The Best ever, simply use a whole 16 oz. jar of peanut butter and 3 cups of flour. No need to refrigerate, roll nice size dough balls out and flatten with fork to about 3/4 in. thick. makes 28 nice size cookies.

perfect! only changes I made was adding 1 tsp. vanilla. I refrigerated dough overnight. made small balls of dough and rolled them in small bowl of sugar before placing on cookie sheet then  flattened them with damp fork to make cris cross markings.

I made it a bit healthier by using whole wheat flour, natural peanut butter and coconut palm sugar instead. Easy replacements made for a very tasty and more justifiable cookie ;)

These are the perfect peanut butter cookies, with just a couple of tweaks.  I used salted butter, 1 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 c white sugar, and added 1 tsp vanilla to the mixture when I creamed it.  I also doubled the peanut butter.  I only used 1/4 tsp of salt, and baked the cookies for 8 minutes at about 360.  They were soft and thick -- didn't spread at all.  These are everybody's favorite peanut butter cookies!!

I made gluten-free peanut butter cookies with this recipe, simply by substituting 2 cups of Krusteaz all-purpose gluten-free flour plus 1/2 cup coconut flour in place of the standard all-purpose flour called for in the recipe. (I'm sure you could just use 2 1/2 cups of the gluten-free flour and skip the coconut flour, but I had some coconut flour that I wanted to use.) I also used regular peanut butter instead of crunchy because that's what I had on hand. I let the dough get completely chilled before rolling it into balls, and I made mine slightly bigger than 1-inch ball.  They turned out really well and I got huge compliments from the gluten-free folks when I shared these at a gathering. (I'm not gluten-free but I like to experiment.)

I made no changes to the recipe. I refrigerated the dough for an hour and used my cookie scoop to have even sized cookies, criss crossed with fork and sugar. Baked at 375 for 13 mins. Perfect! Saved to my recipe box.

Classic recipe.  Really yummy, good texture, and great flavor.  I did the recipe slightly different.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla and it livened the flavor of peanut butter.  After  refrigerating, I rolled about a tablespoon of dough in white sugar.  They need the full 10 minutes in the oven. Overall, great cookie recipe.

AWESOME SAUCE!!! loved this recipe! added 1/2 cup more flour and peanut butter, i used creamy, and did not have to chill. also added about a teaspoon of vanilla. rolled up real nice, not too sticky. i mainly loved it as i have been looking for a  recipe similar to my mom's, (lost the box in a move :(...) This one is it. I tried several different recipes this week including Martha Stewart's peanut butter cookies. This recipe beats all the others hands down! Rolled small balls, didn't spread out, just right! Made about 40-50 cookies. Bake 10 mins only!!

I made the cookies exactly as written because most of the reviews are based on changes to the recipe.    Because of the spreading mentioned by many reviewers I made sure to chill the dough for an hour and did not overmix.  I shaped the dough into balls about the size of a ping pong ball and very lightly pressed them in a criss cross pattern with a moistened fork making sure not to flatten too much.  At this point they were about 1/2-3/4" thick.  I baked for 10 minutes, or until just barely brown on the edges.  The cookies did spread to about 3" in diameter, and were about 1/4" thick when cooled.   They are a soft/chewy cookie, not crisp.  I would prefer a crisper cookie, more like shortbread, which is why I only gave the recipe 4 stars.

Not enough flour. Would add at least one more cup and probably half a cup more of peanut butter to keep the texture and taste. The overall taste is excellent.

I thought the recipe was written correctly!  My grandson and I had a great few hours in the kitchen together baking cookies!  The flavor was great!  They have a good crunch on the ends but soft and chewy in the middle!  My grandson liked making the fork marks with sugar on the top of each cookie ball!  I would recommend this recipe with no changes!

I was a little apprehensive about this recipe because I didn't read the reviews until after the dough was chilling in the refrigerator. Not to worry! They turned out perfectly, didn't run at all. The only thing I did differently was use creamy peanut butter and roll them in sugar before scoring them with a fork. Used my pampered chef smallest scoop.

These cookies were delicious. The only change that I made was that I added one more tablespoon of peanut butter and whenever I pressed the cookies down with a fork, I put a little bit of Crisco butter spray on so that the fork wouldn't stick to the dough. This is a great recipe.

I made a batch for 12 cookies  which required me to use 1/2 cup of peanut butter but I used 3/4-1 cup of peanut butter (what I'm trying to say is I added more peanut butter than called for) and I added a capful of vanilla extract. These cookies came out big and chewy. DELISH!!!! Will be making again.

I halved the recipe and used 1/2 cup zero calorie sweetener (sucrolose/splenda) and then added 1 cup peanut butter chips! I also skipped the refrigerator part.. I dissolved the baking soda in 1 teaspoon hot water and added the baking soda to the dough and salt before the flour. The dough was fluffy and perfect! They turned out fantastic but in part due to the peanut butter chips because I left out white sugar and used the substitute.
I also used 1 cup peanut butter instead of 1/2 since I halved the recipe it only called for 1/2 cup.  Try it!

These were the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made! I added 1/4 cup more flour to make them more fluffy and chewy as the first time they were too crispy and flat for my taste. I also added 1/2 cup more crunchy peanut butter for some extra flavor! The standard 1 cup is good as well, though, for a delicate, light flavor. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and all of this balanced perfectly. Additionally I did not cross the cookies with a fork because I wanted them to be as full and fluffy as possible. Making again!

I had no problem with them spreading all over the place. I did refrigerate overnight and added about 1/2 cup more flour as was suggested by many others. Also added vanilla.  I used my stand mixer and beat the butters and sugars until fluffy before adding eggs and other dry ingredients. I didn't mix the dry ingredients before adding to the mix.

I followed the advice of others and added more peanut butter and flour as indicated.  I forgot the vanilla; that would have probably been just what was needed to enhance the flavor perfectly.  I refrigerated my dough for about 1 1/2 days, mainly for convenience, but it was perfect.  I was able to put the "criss-cross on my cookies, and they were yummy!

I made exactly as is with the exception of adding some chocolate chips.  I was told by my husband these are the best peanut butter cookies he ever had.  My son and I agree!!  I had no trouble with them flattening out too much... I gently scored the fork marks.  I didn't flatten the dough down. The cookies are off to a bake sale today where I am sure they will continue to receive rave reviews.   I will make these again and again! Thank you!

I followed the recipe exactly and got amazing results! The cookies are crisp, but still soft. Perfect texture, and balance of peanut butter! This is now my go to recipe for peanut butter cookies.

Great cookies!!!  I did what Natalie66 did.  I changed the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups and added 1/2 cup flour.  Also, I used salted butter so I cut the salt to 1/4 teaspoon.  Very moist and soft cookie!  I cooked them for 8 1/2 mins.  I did the criss cross with my fork dipped in sugar.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I would bake them for only 8 minutes and do not be afraid to take them out even if the top does not look cooked. If you leave them for longer the bottom will harden and burn a little.

I've made PLENTY of PB cookies in my many years of baking...& this recipe is my above & beyond Favorite one!!  You just HAVE TO take them out of the oven  when they're just starting to get a bit crispy on the edges.  They WILL be soft, but, just leave them on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before trying to lift them (I use a spatula, like I use for my pancake flipping, either the small one or my larger one, depending on the size of the cookie I make.)   These are my husband's absolute favorite cookie... So, I make them @ LEAST once or twice a month!!! (Sometimes to fancy them up a bit...or, if I feel like it), I'll dip half of each cookie in some melted chocolate chips... either dark or white ones.... Yummy!

I took another reviewer's suggestion and increased the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups, added an additional 1/4 cup flour, and baked at 350 degrees for 9-10 minutes; Refrigerated overnight; rolled into balls and had my daughter (age 3.5) roll the balls in sugar and press them with a fork (she did remarkably well btw).  Don't roll/sugar/press too many minutes before cooking, otherwise the sugar you roll will start to get too wet and won't give you that sugary taste after cooking.  I was impressed how they turned out, just a little crispy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside.  To make sure you don't over cook them (or any cookie really) - the top of the cookie will go from wet looking to "dry".  I used to look for the golden sides, but honestly, this technique has baked many batches of cookies with that awesome taste of soft Otis store bought type cookies.

This is my go to recipe. I use natural peanut butter (made with peanuts and salt only) instead of Jif, and my one cup of peanut butter is a heaping over flowing cup! I find that they don't flatten as much if you refrigerate the dough overnight.

These were yummy peanut butter cookies! I did not have chunky peanut butter, but I did have salted caramel peanut butter.  This special peanut butter gave these cookies a crisp outside and a chewy inside...perfection!

After reading the reviews, I added 1/2 cup of peanut butter (smooth) & 1/2 cup of flour & baked them for about 12 minutes, at 10 minutes they were still a it doughy, & they were perfect. This recipe makes way more than 24. I baked 24 & had more than half of the cookie dough left! Wrapped the rest in aluminum foil & put in the freezer for a rainy sweet tooth day

Best peanut butter cookies ever!  This recipe replaced the one I used for many years. I didn't have crunchy peanut butter so used creamy and added 1/2 cup chopped peanuts. Yum!

I didn't wanna make the fork marks on them so I didn't and they weren't flat so that's less dishes to dirty and less ingredients to use too

These were delicious cookies! I see a lot of people having issues with their cookies being too flat. Try using Bakers Flour in lieu of All Purpose (Yes, still include the additional leavening ingredients.) Outside of a different flour, I added an additional  1/2 C of both flour and peanut butter and a bag of mini Reese's bits. I spread the dough out into a 9x13 baking dish, covered with cellophane and let sit in the fridge for about 3 hrs.  Rolled into 1" balls and lightly cross crossed with a fork dipped in granulated sugar. In our oven, we baked 1 dozen at a time for 12 min and they came out perfect! They only spread just a tad so we got a 1/2" thick cookie that is a little crispy outer shell and a soft & chewy center. Will definitely use this recipe again.

These peanut butter cookies are great! My family just couldn't stop snacking on the crumbs! The only thing I did for a change was use creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy because it was the only thing I had. Absolutely delicious from the texture and the taste #scrumptious!

I followed the recipe exactly. The texture was fine. I did not have runny, flat cookies like others mentioned. However, I couldn't really taste much peanut butter.   Maybe it was the generic brand peanut butter - not sure.

I was looking for a go-to peanut butter cookie recipe. Following the recipes exactly, I made a batch of these and Joey's Peanut Butter cookies, also on All Recipes, and took them to work. Of the 30 people who participated in my taste test, they came out at a tie.  But by the end of the day though, the Joey's were breaking apart while this Classic Peanut Butter Cookie was holding its shape in the zip lock.  As they were tied for taste, this is now my go-to peanut butter cookie because it held up better for transporting.

As did other reviewers, I added a half cup more pb and a quarter cup more flour. I didn't have an hour to chill so I stuck the dough in the freezer and mixed it up a couple times to cool quicker. I also didn't have unsalted butter so I added less salt and I added a touch of vanilla. I dipped the tops of the "balls" in sugar before I pressed them with the fork. I ended up cooking them about 12.5 minutes and kept an eye on them in 30 second intervals to ensure they were just starting to get a hint of color but I don't think I will even do that next time. I think mine could have been taken out at 11 minutes, maybe 11.5 if you want to get that technical. No issues with flat cookies.

This recipe was absolutely fabulous! Like most reviews i guess this one calls for a couple more grams of flour. I tried this egg-less with 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and the resulting cookies were absolutely divine! This one's going in my recipe book!

I made these just as the recipe states except for adding 1 tsp of vanilla.  Baked for 8 minutes, and they are of perfect consistency and are delicious.  This is now my "go to" peanut butter cookie recipe.  Crisp yet chewy.  Thanks, Shirley, for sharing.

This recipe is amazing as is. I was a pb cookie virgin, but I made this using typical cookie approach: cream fat/sugars/eggs for 5-10 minutes to help make fluffy cookies. I sifted my flour, didn't even bother refrigerating the dough, and used am ice cream scooper to make balls (so that the dough was handled very minimally), made slight fork marks and baked 10-11 minutes on a silpat.

Made these following some of the suggestions above.  Increased peanut butter and flour both by 1/4 cup, and added 2 teas vanilla to wet ingredients. Rolled balls in vanilla sugar, flattened and used fork to do criss-cross pattern. Baked at 350 for 10-11 minutes, came out very nice.  Slighlty crispy and chewy.  Will make again. (Also added dark chocolate chips to 1/2 of the dough - they turend out really good!)

I followed the recipe except I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy (which I didn't have on hand).  I think that the people who feel a need to add more peanut butter might not be using crunchy.  With the actual pieces of peanut in the cookie, it would enhance the peanut flavor.  I'll use crunchy next time.  I chilled the dough for an hour and the cookies spread the perfect amount.  Not flat at all, perfectly round, no need to add more flour.

Love this recipe I make them a little bigger and after they come out of the oven I sprinkle them with a little vanilla sugar.

This is a great recipe. My husband and his co-workers love them! Just wondering though... It says it makes 4 dozen. I got over 6 dozen the last time I made them. Has that happened to anyone else?

I liked this recipe but knew that a lot of people were experiencing overly thin cookies. To help with this I used half shortening and half butter, being sure the butter wasn't overly soft. I also used half a cup extra peanut butter and a tablespoon of vanilla extract to improve the flavor. The fork pattern was a nice touch and as long as you don't flatten them too much it'll be fine, keep in mind they are meant to spread a bit in the oven

Great cookies. Used same measurements. I cooked them on a stone. Flattened them a little with the fork but they came out perfectly, not to thin and they are chewy. I took them out as the recipe said when they started to brown.

My kids loved them. The trick is to bake them to at 180C for just 8 mins and let them stand in the oven. The heat will make them just right on the top with gooey inside. My kids lapped them up so quick.

This recipe was just stupid good! 8 million stars! We halved the recipe and I accidentally put more baking powder than it call for (oops) but they came out PERFECT! This is for sure, no doubt MY LAST RECIPE for peanut butter cookies! We cooked them exactly 10 minutes - Perfect! We then scooped them into mini muffin tins and added chocolate and rolo's and cooked them 11 minutes and they were perfect! Thanks for the recipe! BRAVO!

Well, I mixed it up... One stick of butter instead of 2, no baking soda, skipped refrigeration etc.  When first batch came out, I thought they were very bland.  So I added vanilla, cinnimon, maple syrup.  The batter tasted WAY better!  The cookies did too! ??

I make these foe special occasions because my husband LOVES them and he thinks they're hard to make...these really are simple and taste EXCELLENT. They way you cook them is key. Experiment what's best for you. We do 8 minutes, 2 minutes in the pan cooling for crispness. Larger cookies make chewier middles.

The recipe was great and simple and easy to follow, but it was my first time baking cookies, and mine came out more like cupcakes than cookies. They still were the shape and size of cookies, but rather than being crunchy or moist like cookies, were just sponge-like.

All time favorite recipe for peanut butter cookies...and I've tried quite a few! Made a few small changes: added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and an extra 1/4 cup of Peanut Butter. I also baked at 350 for about 10 minutes and it worked perfectly! Stop looking now and use this recipe now! The cookies are absolutely delicious.

Very good--a little different in texture, since when my children were growing up, I made them probably the size estimated here.  I added the extra flour and peanut butter as others mentioned here, plus the teaspoon of vanilla.  The flavor would be richer with the butter; however, since I had none, I used 1/2 cup cube margarine plus 1/2 cup shortening.  Since everyone seems to like cookies larger these days, that's what I did, ending up with about 3 dozen.  Just right at 375 degrees at 9 minutes.  I tried some at 350 degrees earlier after preheating, but they were too pale.

I've cooked these cookies multiple times now, except I was adding a little bit more peanut butter as well as flour. Well this time I followed the instructions exactly as they said, except I used 1/2 crunchy 1/2 creamy peanut butter, and added 1/4 tsp vanilla extract, cooked on 375 for 12 mins and they're the best ones yet. The ends managed to stay crunchy while the middle is nice and chewy. So great!

These were exactly what I was looking for! I listened to other reviews and added some vanilla, 1/2 cup more peanut butter, 1/2 cup more AP flour, and 2Tbsp of cornstarch to keep them a bit more chewy. But I made the mistake of doubling this and oh my goodness I got soooooooo many cookies! I'm not sure if I am making them considerably smaller than others but I have soooo many cookies that I don't think I know how to get rid of them all! But truly if my only complaint is that the yeild amount seems a tad off well then honestly there isn't much to complain about :-) thank you for this post as this is now my go-to PB cookie!!!

This was a great recipe.  I read other reviews which noted flatness of cookies so I added a little over 1/4 cup of flour.  Also used creamy peanut butter and not crunchy as we dis n it have it on hand.  Cookies came out nice, although they were a bit hard, so next time I will bake them a minute or two less.  Thanks again for the recipe.

These are amazing.  Peanut butter is my husband's favorite type of cookie and he absolutely loved them.  I added more flour and peanut butter as the top reviews suggested and they came out simply fabulous!  Froze well, too!  I definitely will be making these again!

FANTASTIC COOKIES...First time I'v made peanut butter cookies.  I followed the recipe to a tee but did not know how to measure the peanut butter accurately so just put the whole jar of chunky Skippy in the batter.  NO REGRETS.  The aroma of the baked cookie is intoxicating and the next day, I could smell the cookies my husband had on a napkin, across the room.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

Loved it but... no matter whose recipe you follow, after refridgeration of your dough, it turns out really really crumbly. Add one cup of milk and mix before baking your cookies. I get compliments every time I make these!

The recipe is great. I added 1tsp
of vanilla and did not press the cookies much to avoid the crispy pancake look. Cookies were moist and better the next day. My oven bakes fast so I baked for 8 minutes. Jiff is my favorite peanut butter and is my preference over others.

So delicious! Just put 3 cups of flour instead of 2 1/2 and put 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter. Other than that , these cookies are wonderful.

honestly they taste  delicious, i won't lie, but they are really weak and won't hold together. like i tried to pick up one and it fell apart like my social life. i kind of ended up with a pan of peanut butter deliciousness, like i decided to just put the first batch in a bowl and eat it with a spoon. 
it was a very good idea.

These cookies are to die for. They are the perfect amount of peanut butter and all of the other ingredients made the cookies taste much better than the classic recipes that you find on the back of the peanut butter container. I wanted to go straight into the baking without seeing any comments so that I could give this a pure rating. Stay tuned if you would like to hear my recommendations.                                                                                                                        I made a large mistake during the first direction. While I was combining the butter, peanut butter and sugars, I left the stand mixer for a minute. 1 MINUTE! In that minute the butter whipped. I then returned to a very light mixture. If this happens to you DON'T WORRY. I actually had none of the problems that anyone else had. I also didn't have enough flour and only put in 2 1/4 cup flour but once again it did not mess up my cookies. Once I was done making the dough, I put it in the fridge. I went shopping and lost track of time which led me to leaving the dough in the fridge for 2 and a half hours but that once again did not mess up my cookies. The dough was a perfect consistency and didn't grip the fork so I did not have to use any sugar to keep it from sticking. Once cooked the cookies return to peanut butter colour. I highly recommend this and don't worry if your mixture is more white than it was in the video. It may even turn out better then the regular recipe.

This is the best peanut butter cookie I've ever had. I did follow some of the other folks suggestions and used 1 1/2 cups peanut butter, and 2 2/3 cups flour instead of the measurements used in the recipe. I chilled the dough for about 20 hours in the fridge. I also rolled the dough balls in sugar, and baked them for 11 minutes at 350 degrees in my toaster oven. They turned out amazing. Just check out the pictures of the final product!

These are AWESOME!!!  I did take others' advice and added a bit more flour (I live in CO, cookies come out flat if you don't add flour) and I cooked them for 8 minutes and they were chewy and perfect!!!  I kept putting the batter into the fridge between batches--my kitchen gets HOT and I didn't want to risk it them melting in advance!  Excellent recipe!

This recipe was so easy and I did not have to adjust it. 

I made 2 dozen D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S, melt in your mouth peanut butter cookies and will keep this recipe in my recipe box :)  

Shirley, Thank You So Much

I followed the basic recipe but did make a few changes that people said would make the cookies chewy. Well I don't know what went wrong but these (all 9 dozen of them) are dry and almost powdery. Very bland flavor too, even with vanilla. So while they are not the worst cookies I've ever had/baked, they are just VERY plain.

I followed the recipe to the letter and really liked it!! It made a lot more than 4 dozen cookies, more like 6 dozen. That's okay, it means I have something to bring to a potluck at work tomorrow. LOL!!

I made exactly to recipe but I can't help but think I should've used another egg (though large they were kinda small). It didn't seem enough to make the batter consistent. Some of them crumbled (just a few not all). But they are definitely delish!!! These will definitely be made again! HUGE HiT!

These cookies are the BEST PB cookies I have ever tasted.   I made a total of 28 large cookies, and they started disappearing right away!   I followed another reviewer's advice and chilled them overnight, and they came out perfectly.   Sprinkled with a little cinnamon and sugar before baking, and dipped in milk afterwards, they are absolutely fantastic!

I really like this recipe.  I rolled my dough larger than I should have but I like a larger cookie.  No big deal, but the trade off is you will lose most of the fork marks.  The taste is wonderful, not too sweet.  I chose to use salted butter (since I didn't have unsalted on hand) and ditched the salt addition listed.  I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews.  If the batter looks too loose or you know your oven tends to run hot, use your best judgment!  Add a little flour or turn your oven down; my oven runs very hot so I turned it down to 360 degrees and had no burning issues.  I highly recommend this recipe, just remember to keep your dough chilled right up until you put in the oven!  If you have some lag time between shaping and baking or more dough to prepare while waiting for a free cookie sheet, pop the dough/prepped unbaked cookies back in the fridge until the pan is ready to go into the oven.  Good luck!!

I thought this was a great recipe! First homemade cookies I've ever made. Only change I made was I cut the butter in half and replaced with 1/4 cup of yogurt.

We didn't chill ours and yet they are still fluffy! Also we only had maybe 3/4 cup of peanut butter and accidentally used 1&1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of baking soda. Good recipe! Not big on peanut butter but had a hankering tonight! Glad I chose this recipe!

Tried the recipe on it's own, and I have to be fair; only three stars' worth of good.  I'm going to try the suggestions in these other reviews, and we'll see how it goes.  I'm hoping I don't end up with more frisbee cookies - that really was quite frustrating!

3.5 stars. These cookies are good, they don't taste bad at all but both my husband and I thought the peanut butter taste could have been stronger. The first batch I cooked for 9 mins and a couple cookies were too brown so I cooked the rest for 8 minutes and it resulted in a much tastier cookie, soft but crunchy at the same time. Next time I want to make pb cookies I'll probably look for another recipe though.

I just finished making these cookies and they are wonderful. My son requested peanut butter cookies with chocolate chips in them. I did use creamy pb, because that is all I had. After reading some of the comments, I increased the flour and the peanut butter. I did not have any trouble with rolling the dough. The chocolate chips I used were frozen, and I did refrigerate the dough with the chips inside for almost an hour. Maybe because the chips were right from the freezer into the dough, that might have helped. I baked them at 350 for about 10 minutes.  I had no trouble with them flattening out whatsoever. Actually, mine did not flatten hardly at all.  They came out more like a cake-like cookie - which I like.  My son loves them and so do I.
Thank you for the original post, and for all the comments/suggestions!

I made these cookies today. I think they are the best peanut butter cookies I've ever made. I made some adaptations based on some of the other reviews, but I also live at 7800 feet, so I needed to adjust for high altitude. To adjust for high altitude, I only used 3/4 cup butter and I cut back to 1 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp baking powder. In deference to the review recommendations, which were all great, I also added 1/2 cup extra peanut butter, 1/2 cup extra flour and 1 tsp vanilla. I love chocolate chips in my peanut butter cookies, so I added 1 cup+ mini chocolate chips. I don't like flat, crispy cookies, so I always refrigerate dough for 2-3 hours before baking and keep the dough in the fridge in between baking sheets of cookies. I think they come out better. This was a great recipe to start, the recommendations from the reviewers were spot on. I will make these again.

This recipe was great! My hub has asked me a few weeks ago if I'd make some peanut butter cookies and I finally got around to it. I found this recipe and had most of the ingredients. I didn't have unsalted butter so I just used my land o lakes light butter (with canola oil), and I only had somewhere between 1/2 and 3/4 cup...so I used that. I also had some peanut butter from trader joe's that wasn't very good on sandwiches. It didn't have any sugar. So I used that and the cookies were great! I also added a little pumpkin spice just because of the season :). I baked them on wax paper. I will be making these again.

I followed some tips from other people like increasing the flour & peanut butter by a 1/2 cup & it did make them much fluffy & softer which we like. However I just don't think there is enough peanut butter taste. I think next time I will increase the peanut butter by a full cup & see how it turns out. I also used smooth peanut butter instead of crunchy bc it's what we prefer. Maybe that could have made the peanut butter taste not as strong

THIS IS PERFECT! The cookies came out as a perfect and the texture was heavenly. I didn't have crunchy peanut butter, so I had to do creamy. We added some chocolate chips and it was FABULOUS. The cookies spread out more than I had planned, so next time I'll add a bit more flour. Perhaps 1/3 a cup. I added some more vanilla extract,and they were the bomb! Do want to hear a good serving tip? Mash 4 cookies in a 1/4 cup of milk and it tastes like ice cream and cookies that you can get at Chile's. That sounds crazy right? But it was awesome. We made about 25 cookies and in a family of 4, they were devoured without leftovers. My bro asked me if we could make this instead of regular cookies, and A LOT MORE OFTEN. Well I'l tell you this. I agree.

This is THE recipe i was looking for when I came looking for that old school taste. I love this recipe and often find myself going a little over on the peanut butter and still these little babies turn out great!!
Adding choco chips never hurt either!!

I was very disappointed!  I made the cookies exactly like recipe and I found the cookies to be too buttery tasting.  I have always loved peanut butter and used other recipes that were great tasting peanut butter cookies.  Should be called butter cookies with a little bit of peanut butter.

So I use this recipe as a base and tweaked it for what I had in the cupboard. 
I used

1 cup powered sugar
2 1/2  cups whole wheat pastry flower
A good sized glob honey
a big big spoonful maple sugar
1 1/2 sticks butter
1 cup creamy peanut butter
One big giant spoonful trader Joe's Cookie &Coco swirl spread
2 eggs
Salt, baking soda, baking powder the same as recipe


Mixed and baked the same as recipe, topped with trader Joe's cinnamon sugar ( in the grinder)

Turned out yum! 
Thanks !

Halloween 2014 I took my 6 children trick or treating. When we got to the house I realized how much candy we had gotten :-( it didnt look so good....we had so much candy we filled 2 medium size duffle bags. I knew this wasnt right I searched for places to donate candy to, when the greatest ideal came to me.....I can use the chocolate to make cookies. I found this recipe and BOY I'm glad I did!  I did add the 1/4 flour and extra peanut butter. I crushed up all the chocolate and poured it in after I shifted my dry ingredients.  Scared not knowing what the cookies would taste like considering it was all types of chocolate candy (Reeses,  Hersey,  cookie and cream hershey, paydays, snickers, kitkats, 3 musketeers,  babe Ruths, m&ms etc) I just wasn't sure if it would come out right.  The cookies were wonderful!  They came out HUGE and soft! !! My children loved them and I got rid of a half of bag of candy :-). Note I have an Electric stove so I baked on 350 for 9-10 mins. 


Oh yeah the next day I uses the left over batter and brewers yeast and fennel seed to the batch and made lactation cookies and they turned out great! Im really happy I found this recipe.

10 minutes was a perfect cook time for my oven. I followed the recipe the first time. They  were okay but seemed to be missing something. For the second batch, I rolled the tops in sugar. They were 5-star worthy afterwards.

Great recipe but definitely needs more peanut butter next time even though I used a whole jar!  Used smooth peanut butter and salted butter so just omitted the salt and added dark chocolate drops on top just before baking them at 190 degrees Celsius for 13 minutes. Used 1 tbsp as the measure for each cookie and it made 50. Might try another batch but portion it out then freeze so I can have fresh cookies with minimal effort when ever I crave them.

NO NEED TO CHANGE RECIPE!!! REFRIGERATION IS THE KEY!!! I've made these cookies now probably 20 times or more.  The only thing I do differently to the recipe is refrigerate them over night before rolling into balls. They've come out perfect every time.  They are requested for every party I go to.

This was a great recipe and the cookies turned out awesome!  I gave some to friends and they said that they were the best peanut butter cookies they have had in a long time.  Prior to baking the cookies, I read some reviews and decided to add ¼ cup more of peanut butter and ¼ more of flour so the cookies turned out soft and chewy.  I also used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy.  I baked the cookies for 8 minutes and let them cool on a plate (not wire rack).  I would recommend this recipe to any peanut butter cookie lover!

Read the comments before making and added extra flour and peanut butter.... Combined ingredients. Still had to add another extra cup of flour because dough was to soft to form balls... With that said they came out well.

This recipe worked perfectly for me as it was written.  I did leave in the fridge over night, mostly because I was tired ha.  I think I will add more peanut butter with this next batch though.

They turned out fantastic! All of the measurements were correct except for the flour. I would recommend 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup more flour. Without the extra flour it was very hard to form the dough into balls. Overall, the cookies were amazing and i would definitely make them more often for my kids!

It had a good flavor but was way too thin. Reminded me more of a chocolate chip cookie dough that was peanut butter flavored. The first pan I flattened with a fork but then decided not to since they were so thin. The next pans we threw semi-sweet choco chips on top. They were a great flavor as is but everything is better with chocolate :D

This was the absolute best peanut butter cookies I have ever had.  I too like my peanut butter cookies very peanut buttery, so I added an additional cup of peanut butter, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1/4 more flour. My family devoured it, they used terms like these taste "amazing".

Just got done making these. Yummy, but after reading reviews decided to add more flour and p-nut butter as others did. Glad i did because while some liked them as is, they stated that the p-nut butter taste was not strong enough. So with the additional they came out perfect for our taste. I did use creamy instead of chunky but that's because i have four jars in my house. My reason for wanting to make cookies,so thanks for the recipe even though it was slightly tweaked

i liked this recipe! i did add an extra 1/4 cup flour and i used 1/2 chunky and 1/2 creamy peanut butter ...i also rolled the balls in a powdered cocoa mixed with sugar...gave it a nice chocolate taste and it's cheaper than chips. i did not cool the batter in the fridge for the first batch...they were perfect..i chilled the next batch and they were flatter! still tasty though!the recipe made 4 dozen cookies.

I liked these cookies a lot, but just remember to use the fork to flatten them out. It makes it look nice, and gives you a decently sized cupcake- not one big mound of cookie! ;-)

Great recipe.  I added flour and vanilla to mine.  I use a cookie scoop instead of rolling them in sugar, but then sprinkle them with Penzey's Vanilla sugar before baking.   I've also tried it with almond extract and they were wonderful.

I have used this recipe several times and everyone absolutely loves it. Today I tried something different. rather than two and a half cups of white flour I used 1 cup of white flour 1 cup of whole wheat flour and a third cup of protein powder.guess what. They are so delicious. A little extra nutty flavor came through and though they're not as light and crispy as the original recipe, they are delicious.my kids love them too. And they don't even know they're getting a healthier cookie.

The only changes I made to this recipe were to add a tbs of milk (I thought the batter may be too dry), chocolate chips (two handfuls) and I skipped the hour chilling time - we were too impatient to wait. My cookies turned out exactly as shown in the picture and tasted fantastic!

My favorite peanut butter cookie recipe! This is the exact recipe I have been using for years from the Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook - with one exception - theirs also calls for 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, which I highly recommend adding. Delicious!!!

This recipe is perfect as is.  If you are looking for a very peanut flavored cookie, this probably isn't the recipe for you.  However, if you are looking for a hint of peanut butter with a perfectly chewy, soft cookie...  this one is for you.  My family LOVES these cookies and can never get enough of them!

So I rated this recipe 5 stars and I think that is due mostly to all the fantastic comments before me. I read the comments and  lot of comments discussed runny consistency so I made some tweaks. First of all, I made this with creamy peanut butter and that was only due to the fact that we had creamy in the house. Secondly, I added 1/2 each of flour and peanut butter as many comments suggested. Thirdly, I put the cookie dough in the fridge for 24 hours to firm up better for baking. Finally, I added in some chopped Reese's cups and white chocolate chips. I baked my cookies at 350 but I can not tell you for how long since I don't like to follow timers but remove them when they are done. My first batch came out looking not real runny but still a little smaller than I would like so with the second batch I made bigger balls of cookie dough and Volia! the perfect cookie. It tastes fantastic but I would recommend using more flour and peanut butter and letting the dough sit in your fridge for a while before you cook it so you don't waste all the ingredients due to a runny cookie.

Made these following instructions given with no changes or additions. They came out great. The last dozen baked I rolled in sugar before pressing with fork. This definately adds to the look and flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly when making the cookie dough.  However, because I wanted huge cookies, I cut the oven temp back to 350 and cooked them for 12 to 14 minutes.  The center is soft and chewy and the edges just a little crunchy.  Great recipe with plenty of peanut butter flavor.  Will definitely try again.

These were so yummy! Wanted cookies as a late night snack and peanut butter was the only thing I had. I didn't have brown sugar so I just added the white sugar plus 1/4, nor did I have baking butter, so was surprised how good these still came out. I made them with freshly ground peanut butter where you grind it up at the store. My family ate them all up in two days. I did follow,DENIELLE2's advise on adding 1/4 more flour and 1/4 more peanut butter. Which made them more softer/chewier. I was going to do JENNIFERC77's advise but didn't have that much peanut butter. I'm going to make these my go to peanut butter cookies.

My wife and kids just made this recipe and followed it verbatum...WORST PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES EVER!!!  We have 20+ cookies that we can't eat...Not enough peanut butter...Cookies were more like a sugar cookie than a peanut butter cookie.  Excellent texture though.

This recipe is delicious, and I was pleasantly surprised. I kept the recipe just about the same except for adding a 1/2 cup of flour as others suggested, and 1/4 cup of peanut butter. I also added 1 tbsp of cornstarch to dough for taste. The only difficult part of making the cookies was stirring the flour mixture with the peanut butter mixture. I stirred and stirred at least 10 minutes!!! Other than that, the cookies came out soft and tasty, with a subtle peanut butter flavor. I cooked these cookies right at 10 minutes. I was able to make just shy of 3 dozen. Yum!

Thank you Shirley for a surely delicious cookie.

I made the recipe EXACTLY and cookies were very good.  The dough MUST BE REFRIGERATED for at least the recommended time.  This will stop the cookie from spreading while baking.  Also, because it is butter based, make sure you bake them on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. :-)

The TWEAKED RECIPE -increased the peanut butter and flour by 1/2 cup each and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  OH YEAH, BABY!  YUMMY!  Yet another suggestion, add some finely chopped up dates, maraschino cherries and walnuts or peanuts. Thank People for your suggestions.

These are the most delicious cookies! I make them at least once a week for my husband, a peanut butter cookie fanatic. The only thing different for me is that I bake them for 6 1/2 minutes at 350 degrees.

Not enough peanut taste, just sugary flavor.  The texture is nice, though, no issues there, dough nice to work with. Not making these again!

I added an extra 1/4 c. flour and put in about 1/3 c. crushed peanuts(I accidentally bought smooth instead of crunchy pb!)and these came out beautifully!! About 9.5 minutes was the perfect time for them, brown on the bottom but still soft and chewey. Everyone loved them!!

These cookies were really good.  Took them to where I volunteer and the girls raved about them and they all disappeared.  They looked fantastic and depending on your preference you could have crunchy or soft.  I baked soft ones for 11 minutes and crispy 13 min.  The only change I will make next time is add a little more peanut butter.  I don't know if because I used natural peanut butter (without hydrogenated oils) if this made it taste less peanut like)  I like more peanut butter taste.  I would not add vanilla to this recipe as it would distract from the flavor you are trying to acquire.  I also used a melon baller to make sure all cookies about same size.  Then I rolled them in some sugar and when on cookie sheet I flatten slightly with fork in crisscross manner.  Wish I had taken a picture but they were gone before I got a chance.

These cookies were perfect; I had accidentally purchased crunchy peanut butter and my family hates crunchy; so I needed to do something with it.  I figured; why not do cookies!! This recipe was perfect; my daughter and husband, the peanut butter snobs, loved it.  I even made them again a week later and added mini chocolate chips.  Yummy, yummy, yummy!!

I loved this recipe, but i think i put too much flour. i had seen that other people had suggested an extra 1/2 cup of flour and peanut butter. I think next time i will only add an extra 1/4 cup of flour. These came out a little dry but that makes them perfect for dunking in some cold milk. Yummy

I wasn't impressed either way with these cookies BUT the rest of the family can't get enough. They have nice texture with crunchy edges and a softer middle. Watch the baking time closely! Recipes was easy to make. I got 4 dozen nice sized cookies from walnut sized balls.  After reading the reviews I did increase the flour and peanut butter. I'm not sure by how much I just used heaping measurements.  I will make these again since they are almost gone already.

I love this recipe for Peanut Butter Cookies especially because you are directed to put the dough in the fridge for an hour, gives me a chance to rest up!  Today I added semi-sweet chocolate chips to the recipe.

Easy to make and yummy! I opted for the longer baking time. This improved the texture of the cookie. It also helps if you keep the dough cold between wait times. I read that some were adding extra ingredients. Longer bake times and cold dough eliminate this I believe.

I read the reviews before I baked these this morning. I added more peanut butter and flour as suggested in many reviews and I think that is what ruined the cookies. They are beautiful, but they crumble nearly into dust when touched and taste like slightly peanut butter flavored flour. I should have tried the original recipe first, because I would rather have flat cookies (which is what the extra flour is supposed to fix) than flour crumbles.

These tastes amazing! Like others have said they do turn out flat but I still thought they were perfect. I thought they were moist and chewy. I would definitely recommend you do not make them for the first time as a treat to take anywhere.... make them for yourself at home. They arnt pretty but taste great. I have saved them as the only peanut butter cookie I will make from now on just because they taste that good.

Well, ive made this a few times now and something still doesn't taste right. Ive added more peanut butter, tried more flour, tried vanilla. And still, doesn't taste right. Maybe its just me. My husband likes them but I don't think he even tastes, just swallows whatever I make. hahaha

Like others I used 1/2 cp more flour, I used margarine so omitted the salt, and added 1/2 cp of CREAMY PB. I've tried out many PB recipes, this one with the addition of the flour and creamy PB, WINS! Hands down. The best PB cookie ever. The edges are slightly crispy while the middle nice and soft and just a little chewy.  350o for 12 mins. I put a thumb print in the center and added strawberry jam before baking. OMG!!!!!  Better than Mrs. Fields if I do say so myself.

Very good cookies.  I didn't have crunchy PB, so I used creamy.  I also didn't have unsalted butter so I used salted and just left out the salt called for in the recipe.  I've made PB cookies before and I know what happens when you flatten the cookie for the imprint so I didn't flatten the cookie, just pressed the fork lightly into the dough. Mine came out looking just like the picture.  Will absolutely keep the recipe as a starter and add my own twists on it.  Thanks Shirley.

I made these cookies two weekends in a row to take to parties. Even though there was lots of food at these parties people ate up the cookies. The other thing I like about the recipe is that you don't have to double it. One recipe makes a lot of cookies.

I have been trying to figure out what is wrong with the cookies!  NOTHING. I always bake my cookies for 10-12 minutes in a preheated oven.  The only thing I can figure out is maybe new cooks use too large eggs and added more liquid with the vanilla.  That would make them cook thin and make sure you cook them until done.  Wonderful..  Crunchy and delicious.  Thank you for the recipe!here.

I followed along with a few others who increased the flour & peanut butter along with vanilla...they turned out fantastic!! Even my picky chocolate loving daughter inhaled them....that says A LOT in my house :)  Oh, and I only had smooth peanut butter, but they were still great!! It's a keeper here!

I made these almost exactly to the recipe, substituting crushed almonds and leaving overnight. I don't really measure but I reckon I put about 2.5 cups of flour. I had no problem with them being too stretched, that's probably because I let it sit overnight. I used a bit less peanut butter, but I loved these! They're fluffy and crunchy and very delicious! Next time I'll add more peanut butter, but overall it was easy and quick, 5 stars.

I made this recipe and it was wonderful. The cookies came out soft and a bit crisp. The taste was rather bland, so I did add a little bit of peanut butter. I am not a fan of peanut butter cookies, but they were just right. I don't like for my peanut butter cookies to be too overbearing with peanut butter taste. I do like my peanut butter cookies a bit more crisp. So I just added another 1 to 2 minutes. This was a great recipe! I loved them and my husband loved them as well. I may have had to adjust the ingredients, but since I don't like my peanut butter cookies overbearing, this recipe was delicious and deserved 5 golden stars!

These cookies taste just heavenly! They came out the same way as on the picture, taste and texture perfect. For those who like fluffier cookies, substitute butter with shortening. On a well-known brand website (wink): "Shortening doesn't contain water, so if you want to get the same results as you get with butter or margarine, adjust the water according to the chart below. (A shortening cookie with no extra water added is higher and lighter, while a butter cookie is flatter and crispier.)" Since I didn't have enough butter handy, I used same amount of golden shortening, and whisked in 2 TBS of water in it. If you like your cookie lighter and higher, don't had the water. Yummy!

I would say the "perfect" peanut butter cookie. These are so incredibly light! Be sure not to over bake, 10 max for my oven. Thanks Shirley!!!!!

These came out so soft and tasty.
Changes I made were using salted butter, adding 1/2 cup of peanut butter, and some vanilla extract. I baked on 350° for 9 minutes and chilled my dough between batches.

These are good.  I did half crunchy peanut butter and 1/2 creamy.  Next time I will do all creamy as I'm really not a fan of nuts in my cookies even though I love nuts.

Just made 5 dozen of these bad boys. Awesome! Four stars for the adjustments I made. Three cups of flour. Extra 1/4 cup of creamy peanut butter, and one teaspoon of vanilla. Cooked for 10 min. @ 375. Also, keep the dough chilled in the fridge in between batches. Thank you for the recipe.

This is surly a "Classic" peanut butter cookie recipe... straight from Betty Crocker. The ingredients are doubled here but it's the same recipe. I've been making them since I was a child.

My husband loves cookies, and is what I would call a cookie connoisseur.  These cookies are his favorite.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I refrigerated the cookie dough overnight and rolled the balls of dough in granulated sugar (thanks to the reviewers who mentioned that trick) before putting on the cookie sheet.  10 minutes later, perfection!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I thought this recipe tasted extraordinary but I was in a time crunch and didn't realise you had to chill the dough until after I started making it but they still turned out perfectly fine!

I doubled this recipe and decided to add a teaspoon of vanilla and just a sprinkle of cinnamon......they are unbelievably delicious!!  I put the batter in the fridge overnight and made a batch this morning not knowing what to expect because the reviews were so mixed.  I had no problem with the amount of flour.....also, I did replace the butter with "butter flavored baking crisco" - which is what I always do when baking cookies.  This is a keeper!!

These were delicious! Followed the recipe exactly and baked for 9 minutes as directed,on parchment paper. I was able to get 5 dozen from this recipe. They were perfect. I took them to work for a special lunch and of the 4 dozen I took, only 4 cookies came home. Thank you!

Made these for the first time today.  Added the suggested 1/2 cup of extra flour and 1/2 cup of extra peanut butter.  My oven runs a little hot, so I baked them at 350F for 8 minutes and they turned out absolutely perfect.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The first dozen disappeared almost as quickly as it came out the oven.  I'll definitely be making these again - soon.

We have loved this recipe for quite some time now, until recently when we discovered our sixth child has a peanut allergy!  Today we tried it with homemade sunbutter (sunflower seed butter) instead of peanut butter and these are also fantastic. (I think I might like them even better!) Such a perfect combination of moist and crispy!  Delicious!

Done this about 5 times. So simple, yet so good. Family is so impressed with these. This recipe makes an amateur look like a pro. Thanks! I did a batch using all Whole Wheat Flour for a bit of a healthier version. A bit tougher, but still too good.

Reviews are correct. This cookie takes a few trays in the oven before they look perfect.  However, they taste wonderful, have the right softness to crunch ratio.  No sugar grit either. Saving this one. Thanks!

Sound great. Confused though because the ingredients include brown sugar but the recipe doesn't.

I usually only rate when I follow the recipe as stated. Since I added the peanut butter after I had chilled the dough for 10 minutes and they still turned out awesome. Can't wait to try them by adding the peanut butter when it should have been!

Tried this Recipe for the first time this afternoon.  They were ok.  I think they need to be a little more Adjusted for Sweetness and Peanut Butter Flavor.  They were to Fluffy and Cake like for me.  I like a Cookie to have a little Saltiness and Crispness around the edges.  I will be Tweaking this Recipe to see if I can make it more to my Liking.

Ok so I had high hopes for this recipe and I followed the recommendations of the other reviewers and added an additional cup of flour, a half cup of peanut butter and the teaspoon of vanilla. Put the dough in the frig for an hour and then rolled them into balls and baked them for the ten minutes. They look nice but taste bad in my book, I can harderly tastes the peanut butter and they are super fragile. I am making another batch right now with 2 cups of the peanut butter and then sprinkling sugar on top. I also made them smaller in the hopes that they won't fall apart... Hopefully these come out decent.

Excellent classic peanut butter cookies!  I used organic natural smooth peanut butter (made with just roasted peanuts) and substituted whole wheat flour for half of the flour.  I halved the recipe, as it is only me and my daughter at home, but forgot to half the baking powder and soda.  It made for fantastic cookies and no taste issue.  I would make it this way again!  So yummy!

Love this recipe! Very easy and delicious! Here is a small twist that I learned from my mother-in-law. Add a 12 ounce bag of semi- sweet chocolate chips. But only if you love chocolate and peanut butter! My kids love them that way. It is also a wonderful recipe on its own! Thanks so much!

These PB cookies rocked! I used creamy instead of crunchy, and maybe a tad more than a single cup if I'm being honest. Will try crunchy next time, and probably add a bit more than a cup then as well. Thank you, Shirley!

I really liked these. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Next time I won't flatten with a fork (they got a little too flat), but will be making these again for sure.

Wow! Just wow! These are amazing. I added the 1/4 cup extra flour and a couple tablespoons of peanut butter. After refrigerating them, I rolled the balls in white sugar and then flattened them just slightly with the criss-cross pattern. The result was stunning! 
I took the other 1/2 of the recipe and added 1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. The taste is neither too sweet or too dry!

I didn't read the reviews until after the dough was made, so I didn't change a thing. They turned out spectacular! I used "old" baking powder/soda and live at 7300'. They didn't flatten a bit. The only thing I did differently was use Jif chocolate spread instead of the PB (wanted to get it out of the pantry). They tasted great, but not overly choclatey or peanuty.

These turned out great.  Yes, they do spread and flatten quite a bit, so I squished the fork down much less in later batches for the design on top - but these were delicious and easy to make.

I usually do not make cookies, but since we were snowed in(Alabama!)and I was looking for something to bake with what I had, this fit the bill. Followed this recipe to the letter.  No added flour or peanut butter or vanilla. I did chill the dough for an hour and cooked for 9 mins. Absolutely. Wonderful. You don't have to change a thing.

This recipe is even better than Mrs. Riggs peanut butter cookies. I thought I found a great recipe, but this one tops them all. Incredibly delicious cookies. The ABSOLUTE best peanut butter cookies that I've ever baked.

Like several others, I added 1/4 cup each of peanut butter and flour as well as 1 tsp of vanilla.  I also added half a bag of peanut butter chips.  I used a scooper to ensure they bake evenly then rolled them in white sugar.  Instead of the "fork design" on the cookie, I pressed them down slightly with the back of a spoon and baked them for 9 minutes @ 350 degrees.  The cookies are AWESOME!!!  They reminded me of Panera's Peanut Butter Dream cookie.  

I will DEFINITELY be making these again.  Next time I'll add more peanut butter chips and a bit less butter.  The cookies were a tad greasy, but still AWESOME!

I've made this recipe before as directed, but since I bought chocolate peanut butter, decided to try that. When I opened the jar I tasted it and it didn't taste very chocolaty, so I added Nutella also. I'll let you know how the changes affected the cookie when they're done baking.

Big hit in my house. Tweeked it a little. I added 1/4c extra flour, 1/2c extra peanut butter, 1 tsp vanilla, and instead of a full cup of butter i used 1/2c butter, and 1/2c applesauce rolled them in sugar and lightly pressed them. Baked at 350° for 10 monutes, PERFECT!!

These are awesome, the BEST Peanut Butter Cookies Ever!  I did follow the other posts and added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and an extra 1/2 cup of Kraft Smooth Peanut Butter along with the recommended vanilla extract.  I did let the mixture cool in the refrigerator for an hour as well as between batches.  I also rolled the balls in sugar before pressing with a fork to make the criss-cross effect.  I baked for 10 minutes on 350.  I did watch them closely.  YUMMY!!!  Will definitely make these again.  Vegas155

Delicious!! My husband is allergic to dairy though so I substituted the butter for 3/4 cup of olive oil. Moist and still a perfect blend of fluffy and not too chewy. I used creamy peanut butter (sugar free), added a tsp of vanilla, and about a 1/4 cup less sugar than called for in recipe. My husband said it was my "best baking endeavor" - I am putting this recipe in my permanent recipe box!

It was so dry and not sweet. I cut the recipe in half, but followed the directions to a tee. After the first dozen, I even added more butter to make the dough stick together, but still did not care for it.

OK, I've made this recipe before and followed it exactly, and for me, the cookies were great. However, I wanted PB cookies today and had no butter… Sub'd in shortening, plus 3T water, and also added a bit of extra flour after reading reviews. That's probably great when you use butter, but shortening is OMG NOOOO!!! My dough was crumbly as heck, so I added some more PB, some more water, and a bit of veg oil until it was wet enough to at least make a ball. It's still really dry, and the cookies I baked (only one batch so far) are really pale. I haven't tasted them yet, but I envision a crumbly mess! Probably make this recipe with butter… :)

I love this recipe, and by being a 17 year old cook, my mom always ask me to make her lots of desserts. So I chose this one since she craved it. I thought the  dough was a little too thin, so I added another half cup of flour including peanut butter. And I tell you, it turned out amazing! So anybody in need in help, that's what I did, this is a keeper!

Wow.  Chewy, peanut buttery, and oh so addictive!  My grandmother-in-law made this recipe, and she complained that the cookies flattened during cooking, but I didn't really care; they were still delicious.  No complaints whatsoever here!  EDIT:  I made this recipe again last night and changed it up a little to fix the complaints Grandma had.  For one, I added a little extra peanut butter and flour as the reviewers suggested.  For two, I refrigerated thoroughly--more like three hours, and put the dough in the refrigerator between batches in the oven.  Three, I made smaller cookies--three dozen out of a half batch.  Mine turned out very differently--they didn't flatten much, and they were crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside.  Perfect!

I made the recipe as directed - with three changes.  I didn't have unsalted peanut butter, so I used regular creamy peanut butter and omitted the salt.  I also added a cup of unsalted dry-roasted peanuts.  The cookies are delicious - but a little mild in the peanut butter taste.  I will add more peanut butter the next time I make them (and keep the peanuts - they add a lovely texture).  Also, it's very easy to over-cook these.  After they were pressed on the pan, I placed it in the fridge for 15 mins.  I then cooked them at 350 for 6 minutes.  (My oven runs hot.)  They were chewy and crispy on just they outermost edges.  Don't wait for them to brown - you'll end up with a very hard and dry cookie. (The dogs loved those hard ones though.)  Thank you for the recipe!

Great cookies! Just baked them and followed the recipe with the exception of one minor mistake that I didn't realize until after baking. I used 2 cups of smooth peanut butter, instead of 1 cup crunchy, only because my husband misread the recipe to me!!  The dough was thicker and balled up nicely so I didn't think anything about it. He added some chocolate chips to some dough I gave him to bake and those turned out very tasty.

Yum! Didn't change a thing except only baked for 9 minutes. Keep the dough in the fridge in between batches and let the cookie sheets cool down before putting more dough in. Also don't flatten with the fork very much, just a tad. Beautiful tasty cookies!

I predict this will be a 5 star recipe. Haven't tried the recipe yet, but the flour issue sounds like an altitude problem. I love PB cookies and will try the recipe. As I live at a higher altitude, I will plan on adding the extra flour. Thx for the tip. Also thx for the suggestion of adding Vanilla. That's what I've been missing!

These were just ok. Followed the suggestions of adding more flour. They ended up tasting more like pb biscuits. We enjoyed them still. I just didn't find them to die for so will continue my dream pb cookie recipe search.

After reading the reviews, I added 1/2 cup extra AP flour and maybe 1/4 cup extra peanut butter, and a smidge of vanilla. I also substituted in a cup of whole wheat flour, trying to trick myself into thinking these would be a healthy snack ;)  Fanatstic cookies! Perfect texture, beautiful light color, nice form and thickness, and, of course, delicious! Folks...if any of your cookie recipies are spreading too thin, remember 1. use softened but not warm butter (never get it goopy in a microwave!) 2. don't over-mix the butter & sugar, just barely cream them together with a lower speed until evenly mixed, 3. don't spray your cookie pans, use parchment paper or tin foil and 4. refrigerate the dough before baking. Works every time!

Excellent PB cookie. This is a keeper. These are very easy to over bake. I took them out of the oven when the edges started to look a golden brown and the texture was light and crisp on the edges but not crumbly in the middle.

This is an excellent recipe. My only add is a teaspoonful of vanilla flavor. Of course, I added the chocolate kisses to the tops of the warm cookies. I try very hard to let these babies cool because their texture improves dramatically and the flavor deepens.

Whenever I need a recipe I always come to this site, I love all the reviews and suggestions people make. I tried the pumpkin bread recipe on this site a couple years ago and did all the suggestions people made and it's is the best recipe I've ever tried, can't keep it around when I make it, very moist and delicious.

Final result was awesome!! I increased the flour by 1/2 cup as suggested as for the peanut butter I used the 1 cup of crunchy peanut butter plus 2 TBS. Creamy peanut butter and 2 TBS. All natural p.b. I also didn't have butter on hand  and for some reason I had lard( oh yeah I used it to make tamales lol!)so I subbed the lard for the butter. I accedently put 1 tsp of salt instead of 1/2 tsp.(which I would do again I love the salty sweet thing with these cookies)  I also had to add 2 tbs. Cold water ( as the dough was a bit dry and crumbled when I tried to form my balls) I made large cookies 2 oz balls I dipped them in sugar and flattened with a fork I baked at 350° for 11 mins on top rack. Cooled them on a wire rack for 5 mins . These turned out better than I ever could have imagined. My mistakes and not having the right ingredients turned into a blessing from Jesus Christ himself. The rich and intense peanut flavor light and crisp with a soft chewy center. This is by far the best peanut butter cookie I have ever placed in my mouth better than any bakery or gourmet cookie shop. It was complete extasy from the moment it touched my tongue. I will definatley make this again exactly the same way!!

Wow, these are better than anything you can buy at a bakery. I use creamy peanut butter, and added peanut butter chips for fun. The first time I made them, I had no eggs, so I substituted a flax egg (3 TBS ground flaxseed and 1 TBS water mixed). They stayed soft and chewy for the whole week. I've kept with the flax because I think maybe it helped keep them soft--I could be wrong. Super addictive, so watch out. I find that chilling the dough for an hour and using a cookie baller worked really well. It made them into fluffy 3-bite balls. I don't press them down with a fork. I'm about to make batch number 5 today to give as a welcome gift to our new neighbors--they're perfect.

These were excellent - crunchy and not too sweet! I made them with almond butter.

I loved this recipe as a fixer-up. Like many, I start with something else and touch it up afterwards to my liking. I always make my cookies in a muffin tin, it keeps them from getting too big and saves my calories. :) Oh and I also used salted butter and smooth peanut butter. My boyfriend raves about these now, he says they're as good as his mom's! I never get that!

These cookies were SCRUMPTIOUS!!!! Delicious! I followed the recipe 99%, but forgot to refrigerate the dough. They came out absolutely delicious, but a bit greasy. Not so greasy that I'll never make them again, but enough to notice. I will probably make these cookies again; as long as I have more time in the day (I doubled the recipe-48 cookies-and my oven doesn't keep temp consistently, and bakes unevenly) lol

I added 1/4 c more of flour as others suggested. Delish! The smaller the cookie the better as I like 'em crunchy. Very peanut buttery. I made 2 batches and added chocolate chips to the second and even better as I like a little variety.

Nice, perfectly round cookies.  My cookies rarely turn out the way  I want.  These ones look amazing and taste just as good.  I added a bag of mini chocolate chips.

I often make cookies for the small office where I work.  There are only 8 of us.  Usually cookies take a few days to disappear.  These were gone by 3:00pm the day I put them out. 

They are light, crispy and crunchy with a perfect peanut flavor.  There's nothing cakey or too dry about this cookie.  I added chocolate chips because who doesn't love chocolate and peanut butter? This recipe is by far the best Peanut Butter Cookie recipe I've come across.
Update 10/23/2018 - it's still the best Peanut Butter Cookie recipe I've ever found.  This is one cookie that people request over and over again.

OH MY GOODNESS! It's really great!
Pros: It's really good and it lives up to its name. The peanuts can really be tasted and the texture's good. The servings really big too! :D
Cons: I am a beginner too so it was a bit hard using the mixer, I think I over mixed it making it dry. I added another egg because my eggs were a bit small and half a glass of water because it was a bit dry. You also have to bake it 2-3 times before you get the hang of it, especially timing the cookies when their perfect. You need practice or experience to really get it perfect the first time but it's not impossible.

I followed other comments, so I added 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of peanut butter. Fantastic.

Thank you for sharing the recipe! :D

These turned out great!  I added extra peanut butter and flour,as suggested by the other reviewers, plus some peanut butter chips.  I put the batter in the fridge overnight and I cooked them for about 9 min and 30 seconds in a 375 degree oven.  I prefer my cookies a bit chewier but if you prefer a crispier cookie, I would probably add an extra minute or two in the oven. This recipe is a keeper.

Followed the recipe exactly and came out perfect!  I was worried when I read the other reviews after making the dough.  But as it turns out, not a single change was needed.  I think another reviewer might be spot on when he suggested you really do refrigerate the dough for a full hour.  I did and had zero problems.  Crisscrossed the top and all!  Delish!!!

This is the best PB cookie recipe I've made. I added the 1/4 cup extra flour and pb along with the 1 tsp vanilla suggested by other reviewers. I didn't smash my cookies too much and baked them for 9 minutes at 350. They are so soft and good! Thank you!

I just finished making these cookies for a church event I am going to.  The cookies were perfect and so Delish!  

I used smooth almond butter because I wanted to use up what I had in the pantry, and it tastes just as good as peanut butter.  I used about  1&1/4 cup of the almond butter.  I used 3 eggs and added 1/2 cup more flour & the consistancy was perfect.  I used a stainless steel mixing bowl and put the dough in the freezer for about 15 minutes and the dough was easy to handle. I have a cookie scoop (like a small ice cream scoop)and the cookies are uniform in size that way, not to mention faster and easier to scoop up. I always dip my fork in flour before I make the criss cross design, then redip it for the next cookie. The fork never sticks to the cookies that way. 
 
I have two large cookie sheets and only bake one sheet at a time.  I line the sheets with heavy foil, dull side up, and let the cookies cool completely on the foil (after I slide it, cookies and all, off the pan) then I can reuse the cookie sheet. 12 minutes in my oven was just right. This recipe yielded 4 dozen & 8 cookies, about 3 & 1/4 inches across.

I had some chocolate kisses in the pantry so I unwrapped them while the cookies baked and when they came out of the oven I put a kiss in the middle of each hot cookie and pressed down a bit.  They melted just at the bottom, enough to hold them in the center of the cookie after they cooled.  

I will make these again with my grandchildren next week!

I've made this recipe several times now, and the cookies are delicious and always a hit. I've used both crunchy and creamy peanut butter and both work well. I do typically add an extra 1/4 - 1/2 cup peanut butter and I like to add peanut butter chips, too!

I used 'all-natural' peanut butter (the kind that is naturally oily) and suspected less than perfect, but the recipe turned out flawless somehow. The family loved it!

I agree...flour needs to be increased. I increased to total 3 cups. In doing so, the peanut butter must be increased as well. I used 2 cups. Other than that, this recipe is golden. Tastes great, bakes evenly, and does NOT last long so eat some while you can!!

These were the driest cookies I have ever made.  The dough was ao dry it looked like flour! Way too much flour.  I had to add 1/3 cup of
Milk to even be able to make these in a ball! Dissapointed.

So good! I love that everyone tweaks these recipes to make them their own. Here are my tweaks: First of all, I used all ORGANIC ingredients, that makes all the difference in the world. I added 1/2 tspn of vanilla extract, added butterscotch chips, used salted butter, 1 tspn of salt instead of a 1/2, added a dash of nutmeg, and substituted pure honey & real maple syrup for the white sugar. I almost didn't finish these cookies because I couldn't stop eating the batter! If I could name my version of this recipe, I would call it Salted-Honey Peanut Butter Cookies. :)

These cookies are delicious!

I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the peanut butter.  I was "loose" with that and added approximately 1/2 c. more.  I also added a full (exact) 1/2 c. of flour knowing I liked a dryer outside texture for my cookie.  

I used natural peanut butter (the kind you stir because the oil separates); a 50/50 mix of white and wheat flour; salted butter since I had no unsalted in the house (I omitted adding any additional salt to offset its content); and powdered egg mix (placing the water in the moist batter and the powder in with the flour).

The result was a beautiful cookie in appearance, texture and taste.

I've never found an enjoyable homemade peanut butter cookie recipe before this one. Needless to say, I was very impressed. I took JENNIFERC77's advice and added the extra 1/2 cup of flour, peanut butter, and teaspoon vanilla but also included a 10 oz. bag of peanut butter chips. Good Lord, they were decadent.

Tasty and simple!  Made them exactly as per the recipe and had no troubles with flat cookies - maybe it depends on the kind of peanut butter you use?!  Also, I just pressed them with the fork enough to make the criss-cross pattern - not actually "flattening" them. Will try adding vanilla next time.

Wonderful recipe - perfect texture!!! It's so hard to stop eating these cookies! I added a tsp of vanilla and more peanut butter (a bit more than 1/4 cup), and family and friends LOVE these cookies.

Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

Add a chocolate kiss to the center to create another layer of goodness -- or just enjoy this really great PB cookie recipe on it's own.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup PB, and 1 tsp vanilla. Wonderful texture and taste!

First, I must tell on myself. I am a very seasoned baker, but like all I have my oops moments. I made this recipe to the exact measurement, except I forgot the brown sugar!! They weren't that bad, very light in color and flavor, but the kids loved them!! Once I discovered my mistake (two pans in) I added the brown sugar and they turned out great!

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out perfect!  They came out crunchy outside and moist inside......needless to say PERFECT! I also made a batch with chocolate chips that were just as delicious. If you have problems with this recipe it may be your baking soda or that you are handling the dough for fortoo longand letting it get soft in your hands. Try putting them back in the fridge for bout 10 minutes once you have them rolled o to your cookie sheets, then straight to the oven from there!

I followed the recipe exactly, and the cookies all spread out and came out too thin. They were not very flavorful either. I won't be making this again.

I made this recipe for my hubby.  I followed it to a 'T' mostly, but I cut all ingredients in half for a half recipe.  I also omitted the salt (I never cook or bake with any salt).  I had no problems of the cookies "melting".  They came out looking delicious!

I am making this recipe for the second time today and both times they have turned out amazing. This recipe makes 3 dozen cookies and the last time I made them, they lasted 2 days and then they were gone. This timed I added chocolate chips to make them kind of like a Reese's and they are amazing!

Hello Bakers:  I too read the helpful reviews for this recipe and decided to add a twist to it!!!! I added 3/4 cup of coconut, 1 teaspoon of vanilla flavoring, extra 1/4 cup of flour and peanut butter.  The consistency was perfect for rolling into perfect balls for baking. I sprayed my cookie sheet with non-stick spray for easy removal.  My husband was asleep in his recliner and the aroma awakened him and he was my sampler.  His response:  These are great!!! This recipe is definitely a KEEPER!  Thank You.  Terri Woods

These are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made.  The only think I did different was before putting on the pan I rolled them in sugar then put them on the pan and criss crossed them.  Most excellent and I will be making them again and again. They are awesome!

Just made these last night and had added vanilla since it did not call for it as I've always added it to my PB Cookies and extra peanut butter (bit of a fan).  It was not until after making them reading the reviews while baking to find out that a few others had made the recommendation.  Thank you to those that did.  Other than that these turned out really cook as dad made a comment about them being really good (prefers chocolate over PB).  This says something in my world.  Thank you for the recipe Shirley.

As written, I tasted more butter than peanut butter. I upped the  peanut butter by 1/4 cup and decreased the butter by 1/4 cup. I like the new flavor.

While the cookies come out almost perfectly round and acceptably good, they really need more peanut butter. Either that or a few chocolate chips. Or both.  Because they just have a hint of peanut butter, not an "in your face" peanut butter that both of us like. 

Note: The cookies came out perfect. And I didn't refrigerate them at all.

I loved this recipe. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it was not the best one that I've come across. I had to bake the cookies for about 13-15 minutes instead of the 10 otherwise the cookies were doughy and just fell apart. Other than that, the recipe was good and my friends enjoyed it (they were attracted by the delicious smell and begged to try some).

This is my "go to" recipe for peanut butter cookies. This recipe makes a PERFECT, classic peanut butter cookie. I did as other suggested and added more peanut butter and also added some M&M's. I always half the recipe and it makes enough for my little family of three :-)

Delicious!  Didn't change anything.  I had a bit of leftover chocolate butter cream in the fridge and made sandwiches with a few.  Not for the faint of heart or will power.

I loved these cookies.  Like other reviewers I added vanilla (1/2 tsp since I made a half batch) and cooked the cookies at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.  The cookies turned out both chewy and yummy.

Great, simple recipe!  My eldest teen makes these with ease.  I substitute Crisco for the butter and they come out light and crispy every time.  Give each dough ball enough room to spread on your cookie sheet - these do expand quite a bit.

These had great texture and good flavor. I would've liked a little more peanut butter flavor so next time I might add some more peanut butter. I followed the recipe minus putting the dough in the fridge and I added chocolate chips.

These cookies are so tender. Awesome! Make sure you refrigerate the dough because it was hard to handle being room temp. These are the best!
I baked them 9 minutes and used creamy peanut butter.

These are very good, they are chewy, soft and easy to half the recipe (which I did). I did not find it necessary to add additional flour and/or PB which would throw the additional ingredients out of proportion.  I used JIF smooth peanut butter so the taste was mild. If you use a natural PB, the taste would be bolder.

These were yummy and I don't even like peanut butter very much. I followed another reviewers advice and added more peanut butter and they still came out fantastic. I have made several batches of these things and they are always consumed quickly by friends at parties. Love these

These weren't as dense as the cookie batter I remember, but were excellent when baked. Make sure to really squash the fork into the cookie before baking or you will lose the indents that a classic peanut butter cookie must have. Will make this one again.

Love this I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy. I ran out of vanilla which I always put in baking even if the recipe does not call for it. So I added vanilla coffee flavoring this was so good. My hubby took them to the office and brought back an empty bowl. Awesome

We also added 1/4 C. of both peanut butter and flour.  They are perfect!  Remember not to over bake.  We've also tried adding 1/2 c. chocolate chips.  The whole family loved them.

One of the best peanut butter cookie recipes. I did cut the cooking time down to 10 minutes and cooled on the cookie sheet for no more than 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

The mixture was all dry and crumbly and I kept re-reading the recipe and realized i had only put in 1 stick (1/2 c.) of the butter... so I pulled it out of the fridge and blended in another stick of butter and the mixture was perfect consistency. These cookies are awesome!!!

Just made these today. Followed the advise of other reviews, and added 1/4 of cup more flour and used a whole jar of peanut butter (we LOVE pb).  I also added 1 cup of peanut butter chips, and 1 cup of chocolate chip.  Kids gobbled them up.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these vegan by using "no Egg" egg substitute and earth balance in place of the butter... Then I made them gluten free by using a 50/50 of almond and oat flours.  Chewy, perfect!!!   Thanks for the recipe!

I used salted butter and omitted the salt. I cooked them at 350 since my oven runs high and cooked them for 9-10 min. They came out a little on the thin side but they were still good.

Love these cookies made sugar free even! I don't do sugar so I substituted with Splenda white and brown. Very easy to put into the stand mixer and let it go. I must admit that I don't wait an hour to let the dough chill in the fridge because when I want a cookie, I want a cookie. These hit the spot with perfect texture and very moist.

I have been experimenting with Domino Light Sugar and Stevia blend. It equals twice the sweetness of sugar so I used 1/2c. and used the 1 c. brown sugar. I used the suggestions of other reviews and used 2-3/4 c. flour and 1-1/2 c. pb. I made 1 ounce balls, and they took 13 minutes. Woowie kazowee-they came out so good I could eat them till I get sick, because there is less sugar-right?

I usually use creamy peanut butter rather than crunchy, and I generally add an extra 1/2 cup for a stronger peanut butter flavor. I also chill the dough for at least three hours, and I take just enough dough out of the fridge to shape *one* batch before it goes in the oven, so the remaining dough never gets too warm and soft (which happens very quickly, especially after you shape it with warm hands); I take the next bit of dough out of the fridge for shaping about two minutes before the first comes out of the oven. I prefer a chewier cookie, so I cook mine for 13-14 minutes at 300 F, and allow them to cool for several minutes on the cookie sheet before transferring them to a wooden cutting board (otherwise they are too soft). Another reviewer mentioned not to flatten them with a fork, and that they will seem underdone when you remove them from the oven. I *always* flatten them with a fork just a little bit, but they do spread a little so don't go crazy with it; I usually do only eight per cookie sheet if I'm using my smaller pan, just to be sure they don't touch, but I have never had an issue with excessive spread. I do agree that you will likely think they are underdone when you take them out. They will flatten, harden and even darken just a tiny bit as they cool. This recipe has a large yield so you can always do a couple of test cookies to get the timing perfect for your oven. :)

Absolutely delicious! I made those yesterday (only 1 dozen) and they came out perfectly chewy, sweet and peanut buttery. I had no butter so I used the same amount of vegetable oil, but the taste is still fantastic. Just note that if you use oil they'll need to set for a couple of hours or overnight in an open jar to get the proper texture and aroma. Five stars without hesitation!

These are very good, but VERY rich!  I can barely make it through one cookie!  They have a great flavor and were definitely easy to make.

I made this recipe exactly, without making any changes, and the cookies turned out wonderfully! They were a little difficult to get off the spatula, and would fall apart if you tried too hard to get them to come off on their own. (I only have one cookie sheet, so I don't have time between batches to wait for the cookies to cool on the sheet) I found that using a second spatula to push the cookie off the first spatula used to get the cookie off the baking sheet worked well enough. After cooling for a few minutes on waxed paper they held together just fine. I store my cookies in air tight containers with a piece of bread to keep them soft. :)

These cookies were great! I am a fan of thinner, crunchier cookies. I may add a little more peanut butter next time.

My batter came out all crumbly and unmanageable. I tried to bake them and they got even worse. I thought that with it having such good reviews I must have done something wrong. So I looked over the recipe again. Nope, I did everything correctly. SO I looked up another recipe for peanut butter cookies and found out the problem: this recepie HAS NO LIQUID!!! I took out my milk and vanilla extract before starting everything and when they didn't call for it in the ingredient list I thought it was a little bizzar, but followed the directions. BIG MISTAKE! Just go with another recipe in my opinion.

Phenomenal! I've been searching for the perfect peanut butter cookie recipe and this one rocks! I think refrigerating the dough and using baking powder makes all the difference! However, I never met a recipe I didn't tweak. I made a batch and a half, using a full 16.3-oz. jar of peanut butter and 4 cups of flour. I used a small cookie scoop and baked 7 1/2 minutes. The search is over!

Even though I revised the recipe I feel it deserved 5 stars.
I added 1 ts. of vanilla, an additional 1/4 c. peanut butter & flour, as stated in other reviews. I only had salted butter so I omitted the salt. Excellent cookies. The best I have ever made.

These cookies were absolutely delicious. I managed to get exactly 24 1-ounce cookies. I would be interested to know how these would turn with all natural peanut butter. I also used a silpat to bake them on which made them spread out a bit more. Overall Excellent! Thank you Shirley!

Really good. I doubled the recipe and it came out great. They bake better when the dough is really cold. If the dough was not cold, the cookie tended to flatten out more and burn a little. But the flavor was great! House smells so wonderful.

A very good base recipe made excellent with the changes suggested by other reviewers. For myself, I used 2 cups of peanut butter, increased the flour to 3 cups and added a teaspoon of vanilla. Since I am not big on plain peanut butter cookies, I press the dough into mini muffin tins with paper cup liners, bake and then finish immediately by pressing Trader Joe's peanut butter cups into the center of the hot cookie dough.  Yummy!

Best PB Cookie recipe yet! Cream the butter, sugars, and pb very well to make them light and airy. Do not skip the cooling, at least 30 mins in fridge so cookies don't flatten. Remove from oven just before edges golden, trust me, they will be done enough. So delicious! I also rounded the pb and flour, and added a tsp vanilla.

This worked well, a moist and flavorful peanut butter cookie, though they did spread a bit more than anticipated.  Next time I'll probably halve the size of the cookie.

These cookies turned out great!! I added chocolate chips and used a cookie scoop instead of rolling and then flattened them a little with a fork.  I brought them into work and everyone loved them.  I even had to share this recipe.

I absolutely loved these cookies!  I prefer creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy so I swapped that.  It tasted just like my grandmother's peanut butter cookies...mmm!  I agree with someone else that the cookies seemed a little thin, but I'm not sure how to fix that so I left it alone and they were still delicious.

I myself am not a huge PB fan but my sister is and I wanted to make her her favorite cookies. While she hasn't had them YET (it's 2AM and she's sleeping), I had not one, not two, but three of these delicious cookies! 

I cut the recipe to yield a dozen cookies (but I actually got 2 dozen) using the 1tbs scooper. For the dozen cookies I used 3/4 C of chunky PB and used 1.5 C of flour (or 1C + two 1/4 cups). I also froze my baking pan for 5-10 min while I rolled the balls placed them in sugar. I also know some people have trouble with the cookies, being "flat" if you make them less than 1/2" thick you'll get thin cookies. Also if they "spread wide" it could be your butter or you have too much wet ingredients. Once you chill the dough it shouldn't spread too much, so what you put in the oven is what you'll come out with.

I have a convection oven, so if you have one lower the temp to 350°F and put the timer for 8 min. I actually opened the door for about 15-20 sec and left it in there for another min. I've never made PB cookies before so I wasn't sure how "dark" they get. But my cookies came out PERFECT! I also let them rest on the cookie sheet for about 2-3 min then moved them to a plate. 

I omitted putting vanilla like some posters recommended. I believe that vanilla is really strong and would take away from the PB taste. Plus you wouldn't need the vanilla if you put more PB like others suggest.  Let the PB stand out! No need to "enhance" the flavor :)

Great recipe! Used natural peanut butter instead of crunchy. Nice and crispy (which I like), not chewy. Adding this to my list of cookies to make again!

I left the dough in the fridge overnight based on other reviews, so I did not have a runny cookie issue.  However, these were a bizarre combination of crispy and chewy, and the flavor wasn't great, which suprised me since the dough was very good.  However, after they sat for a couple of hours, they softened up and got rave reviews from my students.

Delicious! The only changes I made was that I mixed everything by hand, as I didnt have a mixer with me. And I used Splenda instead of the white sugar- in an attempt to save myself a few calories. So good that my husband asked me to make another batch to bring to his office to schmooze his boss.

I added more peanut butter, maybe a 1/4 cup.  I added 3/4 cup flour more and 2 cups of chocolate chips.  I then spread it in a cookie sheet and baked until very lightly brown. Delicious! Very moist and awesome flavor.

I always read the reviews before trying a new recipe and can never figure why people tweak recipes before they've even tried them.  This is a SUPER recipe as it stands...no additions needed.  The only thing I can think that some would want to do is use CREAMY PB instead of Crunchy.  That's it.  They baked up to be a super combo of crisp on the edges and soft/chewy in the center.  I LOVE these and don't really even care for PB!  Maybe dip the balls into a bowl of white sugar.  NOT needed but makes them pretty!

These stayed moist for as long as the cookies lasted (about 1 week). The dough was so sticky...and the cookies were flat. BUT - Hubby said the cookies were yummy and addictive :) I guess that's a good thing!

I have always bought the easy packaged cookies. Was in the mood one day for cookies and didn't feel like running out to purchase anything so found this and had all ingredients on hand.  Oh hooray for mixing yourself. .. I will NEVER buy the junk in a tube again!  This were so good they didn't even last the day in my house.  I added chocolate chips to mine =)

Thank you for sharing this great recipe!!  Turned out perfect and really are the "classic" version of peanut butter cookies. 

We like our cookies a little less sweet - so I always skimp on the sugar and don't pack the brown sugar when I measure. Absolutely wonderful!!

I made a few adjustments to this recipe based on other reviews.

I cut the flour down by 1/4 c and I added vanila and 1/2 c more peanut butter.

I used a fresh ground peanut butter in a Honey Roasted flavor from my health food section of my grocery store (YUM).

I baked the cookies for 7 minutes.  They are perfect!

Phenomenal! I did add a bit more flour and peanut butter than the recipe called for, and added 1 tsp vanilla, after reading other users' comments. This is now, and forever will be, my new go-to. Thanks!

Through reading the reviews of others, I decided to modify the recipe. I increased the flour and peanut butter by 1/4 cups each. I used creamy peanut butter, also. I dislike crunchy very much. Next time I bake these, I will be dipping them in sugar before I bake. My husband loved them and his friends went crazy over them!

Really awesome cookies! I followed other reviews and added 1/2 cup more PB, 1/2 more floor and vanilla. I used organic crunchy peanut butter. The cookies came out perfect =)

So good! First to note, the recipe made 5 dozen cookies for me (when I measured with 1tbs measure). I altered the recipe as the others did, adding 1/4 cup peanut butter, 1/4 cup flour, 1 tsp vanilla. They turned out great! Also put a chunk of chocolate in the center just out of the oven and it worked well. The dough is a little dry and crumbly, so I'll have to work on that.... Overall, fantastic!

This is a fantastic recipe! Like others, I added an extra 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup peanut butter, 1 tsp. vanilla and dipped in sugar before baking at 350 degrees for 12-15 minutes or until light brown. Perfect cookies!

Wanted this recipe to work but was not for me.  There was no taste to the cookies.  I made exactly as written.  Maybe like others have said this would have been better with more peanut butter.

Although these cookies lacked a certain something, the texture was fantastic. I did add a bit of cinnamon as the other reviews advised and that happened to be the only real flavor that came through. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the texture was so great.

The bottom line is this recipe made for some delicious cookies!  The only change I made at first was to double this recipe.  However, after the 1 hour chill time, the dough was very crumbly and  I had trouble making dough balls.  I threw the bowl on the mixer, added about 1/3 cup of vegetable oil, and the texture/consistency was much improved.  I also sprinkled the dough with sugar just prior to baking.  10 minutes cooked these to perfection in my oven.

I used salted butter and creamy peanut butter because that's what I had on hand. I quartered the recipe to only make one dozen.

I didn't chill them, because let's get real - some of us can't wait that long. They were just right to handle.

After I flattened them with a fork, I piled up a lot of sugar on top of each one and baked at 325 for 15 minutes because I like my cookies a little drier. They were perfect for my taste. Thanks!

Fantastic Recipe! Added a bit more crunchy peanut butter and flour, and also added a teaspoon of vanilla, because of other comments' advice. (Thanks, guys!) I doubled the recipe and rolled them up and froze them. They freeze beautifully. Now, whenever I want a peanut butter cookie (which has been quite often), I just slice a bit of a cookie dough roll and put in on the tray. Then, when the oven's preheated, I roll each cookie into a ball and crisscross with a fork, and pop them into a 375 degrees (F) oven for 9 min. :)

Just like mom use to make!  My mom use to make the best peanut butter cookies but we haven't been able to locate her recipe.  This is the closest we've found and they turned out great.  Did half the batch just as the recipe calls and half the batch with a chocolate button pressed in the middle prior to baking.

I'm not the biggest fan of peanut butter cookies, but these were awesome!!!! Only think I did different was add chochlate chips before putting them in the refigerator. Love the recipe, and I will make these again.

Even after refrigerating for an hour the dough was very sticky. To remedy, I rolled each ball in sugar. These cookies really spread out and become thin when cooked. To make them not so crispy I baked them at 350 for 8 minutes. This is a really good cookie. I do prefer mine a little thicker though.

Great cookie recipe.  I used Splenda for the 1 cup of white sugar and changed the flour to 3 cups.  I also added approx 1/2 cup choc chips to the last half of the batter before baking.  So I had two kinds of cookies from one recipe !  A keeper !

Yummy, yummy, yummy! Followed the recipe exactly except I used a dark chocolate peanut butter and I rolled the top of the cookie in sugar.  They did not last long.

Just outstanding!!! I didn't bake for the full 10 minutes, because they come out softer this way.

I didn't make any changes to the ingredients.  I DID however change the size of the dough ball.  I like my cookies BIG!  So I rolled about about a 2"-3" ball, flatted with a sugar coated fork and baked for about 10 minutes.  They are crispy on the top, and soft and chewy on the inside. . they are FABULOUS!!!

I didn't refrigerate my dough, and I also used country crock margarine instead of unsalted butter.  Seriously, these cookies are amazing!

This is a really great recipe for peanut butter cookies!  Forgiving too, as I messed it up!  I only had one egg, so for the other one I substitued 4 tbsp mayo, and increased the flour just a bit.  Also added one tsp of vanilla.  Rolled into almost golf-ball sized balls and flattened with a fork both ways, baked for 11 minutes.  They are crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside...wonderful recipe!

These cookies are super! I did change up the recipe a bit. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, 3 cups flour and 2 cups of peanut butter. But, they turned out so soft! A little crunchy on the bottom, but that is my fault. Otherwise, they are really good.

Perfect everything with this recipe! Even the 10 minute timing was perfect! I did roll the balls in sugar and then did the criss-cross pattern with a fork as I believe all PB cookies should have this distinctive mark! 

Just remember... if the recipe calls for BUTTER use BUTTER not oleo or margarine. Using the other will make your cookies thin and spread out.

This was good with changes suggested by others - I split the batch in half, then added 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1/2 cup soy flour.  I used smooth peanut butter because it was all I had and I also cooked at 165 for 8 minutes.  Came out yummy!

I gave 4 stars because I haven't actually tried them yet but they look fantastic...has anyone tried these with almond butter?  My son is allergic to peanuts.  Would you have to add extra sugar?  Thanks for your help!

Peanut buttery, crumbly, decadent... everything you want in a classic peanut butter cookie. The only changes I made were using smooth peanut butter instead or crunchy, and dark brown sugar instead of brown and that was what I had on hand. Delicious. I will make these again.

I used the cookie recipe as a basis to making glutein free almond butter cookies. I substituted almond butter for the peanut butter ( we have a peanut allergy in the house) and rice flour for the reg flour (we are trying gluetin free for heath reasons) otherwise I did everything as  stated. The flavor was good, but they are thin and crumbly as several people stated. There is also a slight grainy feel to  the texture when eating. I am not sure what caused this at this time. Over all it was a pretty good cookie and the kids liked them. We will try it again with the suggestions that we found here. Thanks

My family loved these but i made a huge mistake.  I used 1 cup of creamy peanut butter and 1 cup of crunchy peanut butter instead if butter and peanut butter.  They were still great and I will probably continue to make them without the butter.

First time making cookies from scratch and these were AWESOME. I did add some chocolate chips to mine cause I had them and they are wonderful. Even after 48 hours they are still soft and scrumptious. I would not use any other recipe other than this one.

Double yum! I baked at 350 and cooked about nine minutes; cookies were still soft when I took them off the sheet after two minutes of cooling but nice and brown on the bottoms. Added the vanilla per others and tweaked flour and peanut butter also as others suggested. In addition, I mixed in some Heath toffee bits, my "go to" secret ingredient for many cookies. Easy and yummy, highly recommend.

I loved these cookies! I added more peanut butter and used 1.5 cups of oat (and 1 cup of white) flour instead of all white. I used a bit of oil instead of butter. I also added nuttela, chocolate chunks, and cocoa powder to give it some new flavors! They turned out great!!! They taste like Reese cookies!

These cookies are awesome!!!  The hubby love them.   I just baked a few and froze the rest of the dough.  Now when we want peanut butter cookies, my husband or I can just slice some off and bake them.  Thanks Shirley for the recipe for some great tasting cookies.

The family loved the cookies.  I added a small chunk of Lindt dark chocolate on top to 1/2 the batch.  The girls enjoyed them but overall they said they really preferred them without chocolate. Imagine, my wife asking me to make a cookie without chocolate...go figure.  Great cookie recipe.

I thought this recipe was fantastic.  I made it w/ half reg flour & half whole grain flour and used 1c applesauce in place of the butter & it turned out SO good!  I did add 1/2c more of peanut butter and 1c more of flour, as others recommended. You can also put a hershey kiss in the middle after removing from the oven for a more fancy presentation:)

Originally I had rated these a 5 right out of the oven, but after a day or two I have noticed that the butter is way too much. With the peanut butter, they are almost like a shortbread cookie. I think the butter could be reduced in proportion with any extra PB you may add. Original review ---> Just came out of the oven and these are pretty good. I bake a lot but have never made peanut butter cookies before, so I used this as a guide. I would agree that you need to increase the PB by at least 1/3 cup to get a good peanut flavor. I also reduced the sugar by 1/4c each because these are already pretty fattening, esp. if you use sweetened PB. I did not use crunchy PB but I did add about 1c rolled oats and they are great! Cooked at 350 for 10 min, may reduce the next batch to 9 min since we like softer cookies.

Best PB cookie recipe I've ever tried, and there have been many over the years.  I was never thrilled with the results, but finally the search is over for the perfect cookie.  I did add 1/4 cup PB and 1/4 cup flour after reading some of the reviews and I only had salted butter so I left out the salt.  Thank you for sharing.

Yummy! Just like mom makes! Be sure to space them far enough not to join too much.(like I didn't) reduces the crispy edge:( But chewy as they ran together was still good!  I made a double batch!

Ok as written.  Cookies were a bit flat even with refrigerating the dough between batches. Will try the addition of 1/4 more flour and peanut butter next time as others have indicated.  Still very tasty.

Awesome cookies!  I didn't read the reviews until after I started making the batch so now I know what I need to tweak next time.  I am just starting to cook so this was lots of fun for me.  Thanks!

These really are classic.  I added a 1/2 c peanut butter and flour as well as 1 tsp vanilla.  Loved the idea of dipping half of each cookie in choc. almond bark.

Oh so yum! I too, increased the peanut butter. However, I didn't add any extra flour. Also cut back white sugar by 1/4 cup. Added 1/2 tsp vanilla. Cookies were perfectly flavorful and chewy after baking at 350F for 12 mins! (I didn't refrigerate them) I also ended up with 36 cookies instead for 24... depends on how big/small you like them to be I guess.

These were very good cookies!  I used 1 cup of crunchy peanut butter, and about 1/2 cup of the creamy kind.  I added a little vanilla (just because I do to almost everything).  I rolled into balls and then rolled the top parts around in sugar before making the criss cross patern with fork.  Don't flatten them too much or they will be thin and crispy.  I also only baked them for about 8 minutes and they were perfectly soft.  Great recipe; thank you!

Wow! Amazingly good! I used whole grain all natural flour and they came out great. My husband is a huge fan of peanut butter cookies and he just loved them. The best part about the recipe is that you can make a few changes and it still comes out great. Sometimes we don't have chunky peanut butter or we use all natural peanut butter. We sometimes use the splenda and brown sugar mix. It's just a great recipe.

These were exactly what I was looking for. I added 1/2 t. vanilla and, like other viewers suggested, I added an additional 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1/2 cup flour. Also, I baked them for 8 minutes--don't overbake! They were soft and chewy. Reese's Pieces are a fun add-in too!

These cookies were amazing. I followed the recipe to a "T" and loved how they came out. I have no mixer, so mixed by hand (wooden spoon) and they were just great. They are a little dryish, and moist at the same time. I normally like gooey cookies better, but this rocked my world. Amazing with some vannilla ice cream or to eat with coffee!

I too added a 1/2c more flour and 1/2c more pb and 1tsp vanilla, I then added 1 and half cups of chocolate chips, instead of making regular cookies, I rolled them onto baking sheet and made bar cookies, they were wonderful!! I also baked them at 350 and adjusted bake time to 15 minutes.

I followed some of the other suggestions, more flour, more peanut butter and some vanilla.  They are soft and beautiful.  I make then for a coworker and he thinks they are the best peanut butter cookies he has ever had!  Thanks for this great recipe!

This is exactly the same recipe as Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book that I grew up with. One variation is to make round balls then push one hershey's kiss on top of each to slightly flatten before baking. Absolutely delicious. We called them peanut butter kisses.

This was a good base recipe. I cut the sugar in half, added a 1/4 more peanut butter and flour (like other reviewers suggested). I only had one egg, and I used safflower oil to make up for the difference. I tried reducing the oven heat to 350, and the cookies took way to long to bake (my cookies were pretty big). Keep original baking instructions, or use your best judgement!

I cut this recipe in half because I didn't have enough peanut butter on hand...it came out perfect. I was thinking of taking these over to my friend's house to share, but I don't want to!

I made these cookies a few weeks ago, and my friends can't stop bugging me to make more!  By far the best peanut butter recipe ever, and I too followed the increase in peanut butter and flour, they are delicious every time!

Very tasty!  I also added an extra 1/4 cup flour and peanut butter as well as some vanilla.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup of each which made a less sweet but still delicious cookie!

I added another 1/2 cup of peanut butter and also another 3/4 cup of flour. I also lowered my temperature to 350 and baked approximately 10 minutes. They came out kinda of crunchy on the edges and nice and soft in the center, just like my family likes them.

Although I read the tips from others I didnt change anything except using a mix of crunchy and smooth peanut butter and I added about an extra half cup. I also creamed the butters and sugars for a little longer than normal and added a splash of almond extract. The cookies came out perfect! Not thin or too crispy at all! A recipe I'll definitely use again. Thanks!!

Delicious cookies!  I used creamy PB and added more than the recipe called for as other reviews advised.  The cookies came out a bit less chewy than I hoped but taste wonderful.

This is an excellent recipe although I did follow others suggestions. I increased the flour to 2 3/4 c. and the crunchy peanut butter to 1 1/4 c. Other than that I followed the recipe. I chilled the dough for one hour.  Instead of making cookies, I used 2 smaller sheet pans 14" x 10" and spread out the dough. I cooked for approx. 12-13 minutes each but you have to check after 10 minutes. I cut into small size bars. My husbands favorite cookie is peanut butter and he loved them. Thanks alot Shirley, Debra

My Grandma asked for "real" peanut butter cookies for the holidays. She loves these so much that she's rationed herself by putting two cookies in a baggie and freezing them! I followed some of the suggested alterations, such as adding more peanut butter and adding vanilla extract. I also used smooth pb instead of chunky. Delicious!

Love this old fashioned recipe! I cooked them for about 8 minutes...perfect!! Also dip your fork in water before flattening the cookie...it will prevent the cookie from sticking to the fork.

This a great basic peanut butter cookie recipe. There's so much you can do with it. I have some health-conscious people in my household, so I did make a few modifications. I subbed half the butter with applesauce and subbed the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour. Based on other people's recommendations, I increased the amount of peaut butter by 1/2 cup and the amount of flour by 1/4 cup. I used a dark chocolate peanut butter, and since it was already sweetened, I reduced the 1 cup brown sugar to 3/4 cup and the 1 cup white sugar to 1/4 cup. They turned out great!

These cookies turned out very tasty.  I do suggest to add about 3/4 of a cup extra peanut butter.  The first batch I made did not taste peanut buttery enough so I tossed in some extra and they were delicious.

I made 2 batches of the recipe.  For the most part, the cookies were good.  Only comment I have is that they were not peanut buttery enough.  I even added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter, and still wasn't quite enough.  Other that that, the recipe is good.

The only modification I made was omitting the criss-cross pattern; it didn't work for me.  What did work was to roll the dough into balls, as instructed, then flatten them with a spatula before baking.  One other note, I formed 2 inch balls instead of 1 inch, again, this worked for me since I love large, chewy cookies.

I followed the recipe, but added 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter as a reviewer had suggested, but still, the cookie was too crunchy/hard for my taste. If you like soft and chewy cookies, this recipe may not be for you!

These were great, they are my go to peanut butter cookie now.  I took other reviewers suggestions and increased both the peanut butter and flour.  I rolled these in granulated sugar before marking with a fork.

Great recipe! I just made them for the first time (my first time ever attempting peanut butter cookies, in fact), and they turned out quite well. Like some other users, I added extra flour and peanut butter and reduced the cooking temperature to 350.   Thanks! I'll definitely make them again. :)

They were amazing. I added a little more peanut butter and 1/4 tsp. of vanilla. Half way through the batch i added chocolate chips and found that it added more flavour. This recipie was really good, but not the best i've ever had. I will make it again : )

these are really good but I wanted MORE of a peanut butter flavor....I suggest using the crunch peanut butter like suggested I used the "smooth" and thought they were just good not "great". :)

Super easy and tasty. I refrigerated the cookie dough overnight and it baked up nicely the next morning. It was a fun activity w/my 3 yr old who liked to roll the cookie balls in the sugar.

after reading all of the reviews I decided to split the recipee in half. Half I made with the recipee shown, and half I added a tsp of vanilla, 1/2 cup of flower and 1/2 of peanut butter. the half that I added to tasted better but was very flakey and crumbled appart with the lightest touch. but the half I did nothing to was blan and very thin.

These cookies are deeeelish!  It was my first time baking peanut butter cookies, and certainly not my last...  and I don't think I will be straying from this recipe. :)  I cut this recipe in half due to on-hand ingredients, but still managed to get two dozen out of it (I must have made them smaller).  I only had creamy peanut butter on hand (and I used about 1/4 c. more than listed for half the recipe), and I reduced the sugars to preference.  These came out slightly crisp (not crunchy) on the outside but extremely soft on the inside..  perfect!  Although, straight out of the oven, they were not *as* soft/creamy/melt in your mouth..   but I put in fridge overnight and then brought them back out in the morning and took to work.. and that seemed to set them very nicely.  Major raves from even the pickiest eaters. :)  I baked these on parchment lined baking sheets that I sprayed lightly with cooking oil spray.  The recipe doesn't state ungreased or greased.

I'm eating one of these as I review the recipe.  We made the recipe, only using creamy peanut butter instead.  Followed the rest of the ingredients exactly - no additions.  We did reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and baked for 9 minutes.  They didn't look done but as suggested in other reviews, we took them out and let them sit on the baking sheet for a couple of minutes before removing to the cooling rack (we always put a paper towel on the cooling racks to catch excess butter) and cooled.  Then we turn them over once we can handle them and allow to cool completely.  They were great!!!!  8 minutes will give you gooey cookies.  9 minutes they are a little firmer and 10 minutes will give you firm but chewy cookies. My 17 yr old son is making these to take to a dinner tomorrow (Thanksgiving Day) and he wanted to make two types of cookies, and I suggested one be peanut butter.  They have turned out great.  My son says this is definitely a keeper.  One note about the peanut butter, we had a 15 ounce jar and just put in about half the jar.  Great job!

These were delicious cookies- but if you are wanting to make the peanut butter cookies with the chocolate kisses on top do not use this recipe as they come out too flat (even if you start with tight little balls).

These cookies are fantastic! I followed other reviewers' comments and upped the peanut butter and flour and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I took them to work and got very good reviews (unusual as they're not a PB loving crowd!).  I will be making these many times in the future.  I have also used this recipe with great success in a cookie press - it was a bit stiff however and I think I'll leave out the extra flour for the press.  Only four stars as I had to modify the recipe.

I use 1-1/4c peanut butter, 2-3/4c flour, and egg substitute (vegan). These are wicked-good cookies and everyone who tries them loves them. I give them 5 stars even with the egg substitute but I bet they are even better with real eggs.

This recipe is pretty good for basic peanut butter cookies. They're best if you press a chocolate kiss in the middle of each cookie right when you take it out of the oven to make peanut butter blossoms. I also roll the balls of dough in sugar before placing them on the cookie sheet. Peanut butter blossoms are a family favorite for us, especially around the holidays.

The cookies spread a lot so I recommend reducing the butter to 3/4c or increasing the flour to 3 cups. Otherwise, very tasty!

these were some good peanut butter cookies. i actually halved this recipe so i increased the peanut butter and the flour by 1/4  cup. even though i only made half the recipe called for i still came out with 3 dozen cookies. i made half normally and half with dark chocolate hershey kisses pressed into the middle.  make sure to refrigerate thoroughly before you bake these guys or else you can hardly shape them into balls.

wonderful and simple to make, especially with the aid of a stand mixer. definitely increase the amount of peanut butter by 1/4-1/2 cup.

This is the first time that I made peanut butter cookies and they turned out so good!  I was very proud of myself, but I have Shirley to thank for the great recipe!  I didn't have unsalted butter or baking powder, so I just used regular butter (cut the salt ingredient to 1/4 teaspoon) and no baking powder and they still turned out good.  I have a tip - if you spray your fork with some PAM before pressing it in the cookie it won't stick and mess up the design.

If you cook it a couple more minutes, it is at least just as good. (2 out of 3 people said better)

These were terrific! I added 1/4 cup more flour and peanut butter, but other than that went right by the recipe. They turned out just a bit crisp but still tender. I could'nt wait the hour in the frig so I did 20 minutes in the freezer and they turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies remind me of "melt in your mouth" sugar cookies, but with peanut butter.  We grade any new recipe I make and I got an A+ for these.  LOVE them.  I made them just as the recipe states.  Made 3 1/2 dozen.

MMM... yummy!  I halved the recipe (there's only two of us) and added 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup peanut butter.  They turned out lighter and fluffier than other pb cookies I've had and I loved them, still sweet enough for milk, but not heavy enough to make me sick.  The half recipe made about 2 dozen cookies.

I followed this recipe to the letter and they were delicious!  The only difference is that I used smooth peanut butter (only because it's my preference).  I made a double batch of these cookies and took them to a picnic and they were all gone in a couple of hours.  Definitely a keeper!  Oh, and the cookie dough is delicious!

I really enjoyed these cookies and so did my family.  The only thing I changed was that I halved all the ingredients because I had a shortage of peanut butter on hand.  I baked them at 190 degrees celcius for 9 minutes and they were perfect!!  I didn't have the problem of the dough being too thin because I refigerated the dough for 90 minutes and between batches I put the dough back into the refrigerator.

I used crisco instead of butter which, of course didn't spread AT ALL. Otherwise I think these would have been okay. They are lacking a bit in flavor.

Yummy! Some alterations: - used half of the recipe - added chocolate chips - used egg whites instead - used a little bit of my left over Splenda in the white sugar mix - used almond butter instead of peanut butter - sifted flour twice (for no particular reason) - a dash of Benefiber - let batter sit in fridge for ~2 hours - rolled into tiny half dollar-sized balls (did not melt out very much, good size for me to eat though) - baked at 350F for 7 minutes  This recipe is a keeper!

Had to make changes, so that's why I deducted a star.  I added more flour and more Peanut Butter (about 1/4 each).  I used extra crunchy Peanut Butter.  They were great, but watch closely - they overcook easily.  Also people who said they got 2 dozen cookies must have made some really big cookies.  I got four dozen and I don't think the extra flour and Peanut Butter accounted for that.

These were the bomb. I lessened the amount of baking powder and soda, and flour by a bit, and added a bit more peanut butter. I only put 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and they were pretty salty so maybe it depends on what pb you use. Overall though, they were sooo frickin good.

These were actually pretty good. I did however made some slight changes. Instead of 2 cups of sugar, I added 1/4 of Brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. I substitute half of the flour with whole wheat flour and used bread flour instead. I also added semi-chocolate chips on top for decorations. It turned out great! If your looking for chewy cookies don't go buy my recipe! it came out like shortbread cookies. Enjoy! =]

My fiance loved these, but I found they lacked something I couldn't put my finger on. Maybe I'll try adding the vanilla as others suggested next time, and will ad more peanut butter. They did come out nice and moist, and had a good consistency though.
Update: I tried these with a tsp of vanilla and they were perfect... Upped my review from 3 to 4... they are a 5 for me with the vanilla but that's personal preference!

Though they've got a nice flavor, these are on the Dry 'n' Crumbly side.  Used Butter Flavor Crisco, Added a Tsp vanilla, cut the sugars a bit and put in some Reese's Pieces.

Dry, and fell apart in the oven. 375 is too high, and 10 minutes is too long. Stick with the recipe on the Jif jar.

Pretty good recipe. I did add 1/4 c. more recipe, and 1/4 c. more flour according to other reviews, but I felt like it could have used even more peanut butter. Maybe it's because I used smooth PB instead of the crunchy. I prefer a little more softer, chewy cookie.

These cookies are great...although I haven't had them plain yet, I always put a miniature peanut butter cup in the middle. They are awesome that way!

very good,have to be sure not to bake too long as then the cookie is very crispy.  I made a double batch and then froze half the cookie dough so I can have some fresh cookies when unexpected company comes...and it makes the house smell good!

Totally fell in love with these cookies! I've made other PB cookies which were more... adult. not so sweet and a lot more delicate. these were perfect for kids. i didn't put any any baking powder in as i wanted them to stay low. i also kept them in the oven for 10 minutes; they came out perfectly crunchy.   As a true marker of deliciousness--the kids LOVED them.

I didn't have butter on hand so substituted 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup shortening.  They came out so delicate and delicious that I will substitute this for the butter in the future.  Awesome and delicious

Fabulous.  The perfect Peanut Butter cookie.  I followed another reviewers advice and added 1/2 a cup of both peanut butter and flour and they turned out great.  I froze the leftovers and they are even yummy straight from the freezer.

These cookies are delicious!  They are more on the crunchy side, so if you want a chewy cookie, you may want to look elsewhere.  I made these cookies with creamy rather than chunky peanut butter because that's all I had on hand, but they still turned out great.  I will definitely be making these again soon.

I made a half batch, since I only had a half a cup of (creamy) peanut butter. Used light brown sugar for all the sugar. Chilled the hour, rolled in sugar and pressed with fork. Baked 10 minutes. The 1" balls yielded 47 cookies. Not as peanut-buttery as some I've had, but a really nice texture (not at all crumbly), and pretty to look at. All in all, a very good cookie.

I love these cookies, but made a couple tweaks. In my oven, I have to bake them 8 min. at 350 degrees (I've done them in a convection oven for 8 mins at 375 before, though).  I flatten my cookies, since I like them crisper.  I also put in a bag of toffee bits and a tsp of vanilla.  I'll try adding a 1/4 c more flour and a 1/4 c more peanut butter, as suggested by others, to see what that does.  Great base recipe.  Thanks.

Very good.
I used reduced fat peanut butter, but increased to 1/2 cup along with 1/2 cup more flour and added vanilla extract as well.
I also rolled dough ball in sugar and barely criss-crossed so the cookies
did not flatten out.

The cookies were very good. But I made my own little variation. However,  I did use 1/2 teaspoon of salt and the cookies turned out pretty salty. Since peanut butter isn't exactly sweet and baking soda tastes kinda salty anyway I wouldn't recommend using any salt at all.

This Recipe was wonderful! I made the cookies on the larger side and cooked them for 12 minutes. I also added an additional 1/2 cup of flour and 3/4 cup of peanut butter chips. This made the cookies extra soft and sweet. I will definitely make this again.

I halved the recipe and the yield was about 20 cookies.  I followed recipe as is except for the addition of 1/2 tsp of vanilla. The cookies had a good flavour and a pretty good consistency - they get a little crumbly after a day or so.

These came out delicious!!! I skipped the refrigeration part because I was too impatient. Thus, the dough was too sticky to roll into balls with my hands. Instead, I got two spoons and spooned the dough back and forth to make a ball. I actually only cooked these for 8.5 minutes so that they wouldn't be too crispy. They came out perfect, and we ate them until we had stomach aches.

This is a really great recipe, I too, made a few changes to it. I used 1/2 cup more peanut butter, creamy. I also used 1 1/2 cups brown sugar only 1/2 cup white sugar. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a 1/4 teaspoon almond extract. Instead of unsalted butter I used salted butter, therefore I did not use any salt...Very Good Cookies!!!    Thanks!

These were excellent! Very peanut buttery and a good texture. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because they fell apart a bit after they sat in my cookie jar. I will definitely make them again though!

good recipe w/some tweaking...I added 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter, 1/2 cup flour, 1 tsp vanilla and used 1 & 1/2 cup butter and 2 tbs oil.  The cookie came out perfect!  I like it a little crunchier.

I made these cookies and followed the recipe exactly without any changes, they came out perfectly!!  I liked the use of Crunchy P.B. instead of Creamy.  I also tried Joey's PB cookie recipe on here and I think the Classic PB Cookie recipe is slightly better.  I will definately keep this recipe to make again.

These are the best peanut butter cookies! I added peanut butter chips for extra flavor, but I didn't really need to. This recipe is very peanut buttery. I really like the texture, they melt in your mouth, and one day later they're still soft!

I had a late night craving for sweets so I decided to give this recipe a try. I halved the recipe for all the ingredients except the peanut butter. I left it at 1 cup. And I added chocolate chips. I didn't have time to let the batter refrigerate for an hour so I just baked them immediately. They were exactly what I was craving!

The texture of these cookies turned out great. They were very pretty but just okay taste wise. I used margarine instead of butter but now I wish I would have just used butter. These were okay but they definitely needed more of a peanut butter flavor to satisfy me.

Pretty yummy! I planned on making this as other reviews suggested, with 1/4 C more peanut butter & flour, however, I just barely had enough peanut butter to fill the recipe as written and I think the consistency was just fine, no problems! I did add 1 t vanilla which I think was needed for taste and look forward to adding more peanut butter next time around.

After reading the other reviews, I added another 1/2 cup flower and 1 teaspoon vanilla. I was going to add another 1/2 cup peanut butter, but didn't have enough.  I cooked the cookies for 9 minutes as other reveiwers and they came out perfect. I brought some to work and they got great reviews.  Next time I will try with more peanut butter though.

Yum, Yum, Yummy.  I have made peanut putter cookies only once before and was not overly pleased with them.  I used the reviews and made them a bit chewier by adding a little more flour and a littler more peanut butter. Yum.  I also added a little bit of dark chocolate in the center which always makes a cookie better.  I would absolutely make this recipe again - thank you for posting!

Delicious!!! After having read the reviews I decided to add a 1/4 cup more peanut butter & 1 tsp of vanilla. I baked them for only 9 min as my oven is gas w/ convection feature. These cookies were the perfect crunchy with a softer center. I love a crunchier cookie type so these were terrific. Will be saving these to my recipe box for sure. I will aslo add for those who nibble on batter while baking... beware once you start you cant stop!

ummm umm umm.. these were delicious. mI used crisco insteaad of butter and they turned out perfect. I also added 1/4 more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter because my family luves peanut butter and it was wonderful.Ohh and a splash of vanilla.
 I also did what mom would do when  we were kids and let us roll the balls of dough into sugar and the flatten them down with a fork. Momories are wonderful.I found it better to flatten them down once was better than twice making the cross.Why? well because the thinner they got the  more likely they were to fall apart. So they came out just the right size. B.T.W this recipe makes a lot of cookies. I think maybe like 4 - 5 dozen depending on the size of balls you roll. 
Thanks again.

This recipe was fantastic! I went looking for a peanut butter cookie recipe because I had a can of mixed nuts that my kids picked all the good nuts out of leaving the peanuts and the toe looking nuts.  I blended them up and used them in place of the peanut butter.  I usually end up throwing the left over peanuts away, so this was a great way to use the leftovers.  I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla.  I followed a previous reviewer who said to cook them for 9 min.  I also discovered that if they I don't have time to refrigerate them, I just don't flatten them out with a fork.  They spread on their own.  I have to say, these will be my favorite peanut butter cookie recipe!

I followed what some said about adding more peanut butter and flour (1/2 Cup each). My twist to this, mostly because I'm a health nut and have these ingredients laying around my house, is:

Adams Natural Peanut Butter
I didn't have baking powder so I just omitted that
Raw Sugar instead of granulated
Smart Balance Spread
Whole Wheat Flour
And I rolled the cookies in the sugar before baking

They came out AMAZING.
Very moist with a rich flavor from the raw sugar...I'll never bake with granulated again!

Good cookie recipe.  I also added 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  It didn't seem necessary to refrigerate the dough at all. I found the baking time to be about 8 minutes.  Next time I make this recipe, however, I'm going to try it without the additional flour; I didn't think it was necessary.

Yum!  I just had to make some peanut butter cookies the other night, and this was the first one that popped up.  I read some of the reviews quickly and made a few alterations.  I don't really care for crunchy cookies, so I used creamy peanut butter and added about 1/4 more flour and peanut butter to the mix.  We're going on day 3 here and the cookies are still soft and yummy.  I think they could be a bit sweeter, but if everyone likes them the way they are then I don't need to add more sugar!!

My family loves these cookies.  I use margarine instead of butter, 1/4 to 1/2 c. extra peanut butter and roll in granulated sugar before baking.  I don't flatten with a fork, instead the kids help me put a hershey kiss in the middle when the cookies are slightly cooled.  For the adults we leave without.  they spread while baking, but stay light and puffy.  Perfect.

A wonderful classic!  It's super easy to whip up!  This would be a good one for kids to make too since the dough is easy to work with and it's hard to mess up.  My variations: I used margarine and I had only 3/4 cup of creamy PB to work with, but it doesn't seem to have suffered much for it.  Crunchy would be good as well, but don't be scared to go with creamy!  I skipped the hr of refrigeration and it was still very easy to make the balls of dough.  Watch the time though... I expect this will take less than 10 mins for many people!  I had my oven set to 350* and made my cookies larger and they were perfect at 11 mins.

Peanutbutter cookies are favorites at this house.  During a recent move I lost some of my old family recipes, and this was as close as I could come to my grammy's cookies.  She added "Honey Roasted Peanut Butter" (sometimes "chunky honey roasted peanut butter"), and Peanut Butter chips. OH MY!!!  They have a way of disappearing at this house.

This cookies were really good and great right out of the oven.  They didn't stay soft though later though the flavor was still delicious!

AWESOME COOKIES!

Must be my oven, but I had to bake them for 16 minutes at 375. They weren't quite done after 10. Nobody else seemed to have this problem though, so I'm thinking it's my old oven. ;)

A++++++++++!

I am not much of a baker and therefore should have obeyed the instructions. But, I didn't and kept the cookies in the oven for 14-15 minutes because, for me, they didnt look done after 10min. So, what I got was a batch of cookies w/ almost burnt bottoms. I am giving 5 starts b/c even w/ burnt downsides, the cookies were tasty. Just think how good they must be when done right!

Great recipe.  Really yummy cookie!  Used a half and half mix of whole wheat pastry flour and unbleached white all purpose. I followed the suggestions to add 1/2 c. more flour and 1/2 c. more PB (Smuckers Natural Smooth) and this made just over 3.5 dozen.  I did forget the suggestion to add a little vanilla, dagnabbit! Oh, well...next time, because there will be a next time as these are so good!

My husband and I are peanut butter "nuts" so I tried this recipe.  I added extra peanut butter (which it definitely needed)and also added peanut butter chips.  They tasted good but be careful not to add too much extra flour as mine were a tad dry.  Next time I think I will follow the regular flour amount.

I made these cookies for a church meeting and they were all gone! I did as others suggested though and added 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter. The cookies were not overly peanut-buttery, so I can imagine that without the added 1/2 cup, they would have been bland for my tasting.

These cookies are not too bad. Not the best peanut butter cookie I've ever had but still pretty good. I used 1 1/2 cup of peanut butter instead of 1 cup. I like alot of peanut butter. I followed the rest of the recipe as given.

Very good cookies...as suggested, I used a bit more flour. I froze the dough in balls on a cookie sheet then put them in a ziploc till I was ready to bake them fresh for Christmas. Came out terrific!

Fantastic Cookies. Added 1/4 Cup peanut butter because I like my cookies extra peanut-buttery. Must Chill for 1 hour or cookies will come out too flat :)

Maybe I did something terribly wrong, but these were the WORST cookies ever, texture-wise. I creamed the peanut butter with 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. coconut oil (which is solid at room temperature like butter), and it was blending beautifully. Next, I added the eggs as instructed, and blammo - my beautiful, smooth, oily mixture turned into a clay-like mass, like some science experiment turned very wrong. Undaunted, I continued with the recipe, adding the flours then baking... unfortunately, what I ended up with were these really bad-looking, dry as sand, crumbly, disastrous cookies (which tasted good, but fell apart into a million pieces when you pick them up). I am giving this recipe 3 stars only because I didn't follow the instructions *exactly*, substituting coconut oil for butter. Maybe that's what messed it up.

AWESOME. These cookies came out incredibly well and so yummy. I followed the reviewer's comments. I also added a 1/2 cup  more flour and a 1/2 cup more peanut butter. It made the cookie not too thin, just a little bit chewier, not to mention soft and not too dry. Great recipe!

I tried this tonight and it was perfect.  Very peanutty.  I followed the same advice as others with the additional peanut butter and flour.  Very soft cookies.  I'll definitely keep this as one of my favorites.

I read several reviews, then I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of peanut butter ( diddn't have crunchy) I've never made peanut butter cookies before...the dough was really crumbly and I couldn't get it to roll into a ball...so I wet it a bit with water...then it was a goopy mess...so I did my best and rolled them and smooshed them flat...then I added M&M eye's and nose and pretzel ears to make a Rudolf cookie. I cooked them at 350 for about 10-12 minutes--I made big cookies!! I love the flavor...just wish the dough wasn't so stressful. I gave 4 stars because the flavor was great and I probably messed up the consistency of the dough. Will make again...but maybe only 1/4 cup more flour. Thanks!

This is a very good cookie.  Since I had to make changes, I gave it a 4.  I, too, increased the peanut butter and flour by 1/4 c each. Might increase by ½c. each next time to see how they turn out. I used creamy all natural peanut butter and added some chopped peanuts, but no added peanuts would've been good, too.  Also, I increased the size of the ball of dough to 1½ in. and they baked better and were a size we like.  I put sugar on the first  2 batches, but would rather have them spread a little, so didn't sugar the rest.  That's just a matter of taste.

I added 1/2 cup more flour, 1/2 cup more peanut butter and 1 tsp of vanilla like another user recommended. The consistency came out perfect, but they were not as sweet. I think it was too much flour and didn't add any sugar, so it made them less sweet. They were still good, and probably perfect for anyone who likes their cookies not too sweet, but I'll try adding more sugar next time to compensate.

I made with Splenda white sugar and Splenda brown suger.  Followed recipe and baking time.  Came out very nice.  After first batch, reduced baking time by 1 minute.  May add a little more peanut butter next time.

Followed recommendations of other reviewers and added 1/2 c. flour and a tsp of vanilla. Didn't have chunky PB so I added a couple handfuls of roasted peanuts we had on hand.  Fluffy cookies with peanuts....yummy!  Well received by the family.

These are really good, I added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter and flour. Yummy! They were all gone within a day! **Feb 2, 2009 I made these again and they are still yummy! I only added 1/2 cup  more peanut butter and they came out a little flat. They are definitely a delicate cookie to bake cause if its to long it gets hard but they still come out tasting great. These will not last long in my house soft or crunchy! I didn't put them in the fridge this time so maybe that's why it came out a little flat. I used a tbsp to make the balls and I got over 70 cookies.

These were great.  I did take the others advice and use 3 cups of flour. And added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I also used Reduced Fat creamy peanut butter since it is the only kind I buy.  Everyone loved them.

These cookies turned out light and fluffy, but nothing distinguished this recipe from other peanut butter cookie recipes. In fact, this one calls for twice the sugar and butter of another recipe I have used, and both batches taste almost identical (and the portions of the other ingredients were of an equal ratio).

These are fantastic!!  I use natural chunky peanut butter (no sugar added), and it's got a nice combination of salty/sweet, just how I like it.

Oh My Gosh!  YUMM-O!  I used almond butter in place of chunky peanut butter and I had such rave reviews I think I could make a million if I sold them.  I did bake about 1 minute longer than indicated...but that could be my oven, too.  Thank you!

Good but not great. I had a really hard time playing around with the oven trying to get the temperature right. 375 is definitely too hot. They are tastey but missing something. I agree with other reviews that they need more peanut butter. Next time I will definitely add sugar on top and use salted butter. They are very pretty, though, and hold their shape well.

Great recipe overall. A couple minor things: I measured the salt to the exact amount and the cookies taste a bit salty (at least to me, but everyone who's eaten them have loved them), and secondly, I think they could use a bit more peanut butter flavor, next time I will add more. I used a size 30 scoop, baked for 8 minutes at 375 and they turned out perfect. They're nice and soft :o)

This is exactly how my Momma makes them. I live 6,000 miles from her and now I can create them in my own kitchen. Thank you. :) I asked her for the recipe but she's the type that doesn't write them down.

I thought these cookies were great.  I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy.  Everyone really enjoyed them.  Also, I didn't have time to bake the whole batch of cookies at one time and put the rest of the dough in the refrigerator.  A week later and the cookies still came out great! I will make these again and again!

nice cookies with beautiful color and shape, but lacking in the peanut butter flavor. i'm searching for a recipe like the ones my mom used, and this just wasn't it. i refridgerated them overnight and woke up early to bake them. i like the texture though!
