I still can't figure out the relation to the dish from the comment above, but this is a fabulous traditional grinder.  Add prosciutto (aged Italian ham) and it's over the top!!

Mine ended up tasting like a lot of pepperoni in a cheap sandwich. However, I didn't follow the directions. I used about double the pepperoni and left out the red pepper flakes. I also used beet greens instead of the broccoli and mozzarella instead of the provolone. I think all the substitutions would have been okay if I would have kept the ratios the same. Keep the ratios correct.

Moved this into the rotation after getting great reviews from the entire family. Made the broccoli version and did a spicy Italian sausage version. Wrapped the grinders in foil and put the in the over for 15 minutes at 350, This melted the cheese and made the rolls soft and crusty. Fantastic.

I made this today. The taste was good, however, next time I would cut the broccoli rabe into bite sized pieces before cooking. The recipe called for it to be trimmed and I thought that meant to trim the ends. Eating was difficult because the stems were stringy. Other than that it was good.

Delicious!  The only change I made was that I used a whole grain tortilla instead of the Italian roll.
