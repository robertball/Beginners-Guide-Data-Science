DIRECTIONS TOO SCANTY FOR A BEGINNING COOK. 
I love Dutch Babies and they are so easy to make. However, I am usually at a loss as to what to fill them with. This recipe is the perfect solution. I will cut it down to one serving, though. No need to hack up a very large pancake. Also, I am not a fan of the quick-flash videos. If you are going to demonstrate how to cook a recipe, then show the real process.

Did not have whole milk but substituted cream.  Turned out very good.

I made this because the other reviewer couldn't understand the recipe and it looked good. I had no problem with it and it was delicious!

This has some of the most confusing directions I have ever seen.  I’m not sure we’re to start or even if I want to!!
