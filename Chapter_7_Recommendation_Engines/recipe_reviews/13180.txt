We loved it.  We used 4 T of lemon juice (not listed in ingredients, but it is in recipe w/o quantity).

I've made this soup 4 times now. Its amazing and simple. I made a few changes this most recent time that I was pleased with. I switched out the lemon for a lime. I actually just cut it up into quarters and stuck the whole thing in to get more of the lime juice and more of an intense flavor. I also omitted the the parsley and upped the mint. White pepper is a MUST.

The only changes I made were to briefly sear the chicken (I used skinless boneless breasts) in a little olive oil as I can't stand the look/texture of boiled chicken, and I used wide egg noodles. Like previous reviewers, I also added in some fresh lemon juice. This is such a delicious, fresh-tasting soup. I know I'll be making it again (probably tomorrow). Thanks so much!

Before I added the noodles, it was exactly like the soup I eat and LOVE at the Japanese Hibachi restaurants! Thanks a bunch!

Very unique chicken noodle soup, great if you are in the mood for something a little sour and tangy. I used 4 tablespoons of lemon juice right at the end as others suggested. Less could be used (you could add a tablespoon at a time to find the right balance for your tastes). With the lemon juice, mine didn't need salt. My only change was I used probably closer to a cup of noodles (whatever was left in the bag). Definitely will make it again when I have fresh mint on hand I need to use.

I used powdered chicken bouillon and it was WAY too salty, even when no more salt was added at the end. I will try unsalted chicken bouillon (if such a thing exists), only add half as much of the bouillon, or canned broth next time. Ended up simmering it with a washed and peeled potato to remove some of the salt. Other than the saltiness, it was delicious!

The lemon and mint are a nice twist to a comfort classic. I served with a crispy baguette. Mmmmm....so good dipped in the sour broth. A definite Sunday afternoon must-try.

the flavors of lemon and mint in this soup are perfect in this soup. the only thing i added was a dash of garlic powder to the broth. and at the end i used the juice of about 3/4 of a lemon. does anyone know if this is an authentic portuguese soup? the only ones i have heard of before have kale and chourico or linguica.

We absolutely loved this version of chicken noodle soup. It'll be my new favorite, because it's so tasty for so little effort. I used a leftover rotisserie carcass, so my meat wasn't all pretty and julienned, but it was delicious and thrifty nonetheless. I served with lemon juice to splash in at the table. Thanks for the recipe!

Not sure what went wrong, but this soup was almost tasteless. Kept adding lemon, but didn't help until it became too lemony.  Will not make again.

Feel good soup.  Nice flavor combo but it's missing something.  Would recommend adding celery or carrots to really bring it together.
