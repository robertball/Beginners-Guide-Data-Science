Very tasty.  I used some white purple-topped turnips, and turkey bacon instead of regular.  Lots of flavour.

Great side dish, not only for your Thanksgiving feast, but for your fall dinner parties.  Turnip lovers and non-turnip lovers alike returned for seconds.

A very tasty way to make turnip.  I cooked it ahead and froze it, leaving out the bacon bits, which I fried up and froze separately.  On the day, I warmed the turnip in the microwave and crisped up the bacon bits on the stove, then stirred them together.  Everyone, even those who do not usually like turnip, liked it!

I think this is the state veggie in KY, everyone grows them & gives them away, & I'm always looking for a new way to cook them. Thanks a ton!!

Four out of five family members liked this dish, and the fifth is one of those picky eaters.  It was easy to prepare.  We are not big turnip eaters but someone gave us a ton and we had to do something with them, and this was it.

My husband really loved this a lot better than my standard mashed turnips with maple syrup.  The only modification I would make would be to actually use a little less bacon.  It was more bacon than turnip practically.  I used pre-cooked bacon which worked out perfectly. I did pour the grease into the dish. Next time I will omit this, too.  It made it too salty.  I think with slightly less bacon and no bacon grease this would be 5* (or at least omit the bacon grease if nothing else).  Will make it again for Thanksgiving next year!

This was the first time any of my family had tried turnips so I have nothing to compare them with, but I am over my turnip-phobia thanks to this recipe. I couldn't find orange turnips and my grocer was clueless also (Florida maybe??), so I used the white purple-topped turnips. They were so different than working with potatoes, but I soon came up with a system of continuous spiral peeling which went faster. I doubled the recipe and there were barely any left-overs! We ALL enjoyed these. The biggest surprise of all was that my I-hate-anything-new 10 year old daughter actually asked for seconds! I would like to add that these were the perfect consistency. Another had said that they were watery, but not at all. The recipe is great as it stands. I will definitely be making these again. Thanks!

Delicious! I used purple-topped turnips and added a few small potatoes because I had them on hand. The only problem I had with the recipe was that it didn't specify how long to boil the turnips, which is kind of critical information. It took mine about 15-20 minutes (they were small, and I didn't chop them up further). I also cut back on the bacon amount, and it still had a great bacon flavor.

This dish was wonderful.  I have never cooked turnips and wanted to try.  This is the recipe I will follow next time too, and there will be a next time.  This is easy and tasty and if you like cabbage, you will like turnips...and this recipe.  Thank you for helping me to expand my choices.

This recipe was really good! The only thing it needed in my opinion was more salt. Although, I didn't use the bacon fat, so this could have altered the taste. Otherwise, it was really good, will make it again!

No idea what orange turnips are. Can't find them here. I used regular turnips. Super easy, really freaking good. No, really. I made a recipe and a half of this only I didn't increase the bacon or the bacon fat. I don't think I can go back to regular mashed potatoes again. Even the littlest loved this.

This was a delicious side dish, alternative to mashed potatoes.  My husband also enjoyed this  tasty dish.   I used precooked bacon to avoid a mess in my kitchen and omitted the bacon fat.  I drained the water out of the cooked turnips before adding the seasoning,   I'll definitely make this again.

I'd never eaten a turnip in my life before I tried this. I suspect it'll be in my regular rotation from now on! The bacon gives it an excellent crunch. A great, warming dish in the dead of winter.

Excellent!  I'd never had a turnip and was apprehensive...but this was a great recipe to introduce myself to the healthy turnip.  I think next time I'll try it with turkey bacon just to keep it on the healthier side.

I was eager to open my kitchen up to seasonal produce, including turnips, even though I'd never cooked with them before. This recipe was super easy to complete and we were rewarded with a tasty and [somewhat!] healthy side dish to our dinner! My boyfriend told me I could make this again so I definitely will be; thank you for introducing me to the world of turnips with this wonderful & easy recipe! It gets 4 stars because it seemed a little runny, even after letting it go on the stove for much longer than the stated cook time; maybe my fault.. so I will cook the turnips differently next time and see if I can get them to be a little less watery!

Tastiest turnips I've ever had!  Followed the recipe exactly.  I'm going to try boiling the turnips in chicken stock next time just for, the heck of, it and see how that tastes. :)

I was really excited for this but it turned out to be sub-par. I found using the rendered bacon fat made it far too greasy for my liking. I would do it again without adding the fat.

This is pretty good, although not the best mashed turnip I've had.  I used one bag bacon bits and 1/2 cup whole milk.  I also doubled the butter.

You've turned a lifelong turnip hater to one that now loves them! I made this for a group of friends, following the recipe to a T and it was an absolute HIT! Thank you! My friend gave me some massive turnips to take home and I made this again: only because my husband and I are health conscious, I omitted the salt, used turkey bacon (Oscar Mayer) and fried it in some extra virgin Olive oil and to that I added a large pinch of black pepper and garlic. It was equally delicious!

I actually thought this was good.  I think using enough salt, pepper & garlic is the key.  After I made it the first time as a side dish with dinner, my husband and I looked at each other and said the same thing -- "Breakfast!"  The next weekend I got another batch of turnips from the farmer's market and made this and then served it with a fried egg on top.  Delicious "hash"-like breakfast dish, unusual and tasty.

Tried this for Thanksgiving, but didn't really care for it. Thought the bacon flavor would remove the bitterness of the turnip and make it more flavorful. Didn't happen in my case.

First time cooking turnips. I thought with bacon, anything can work! My husband and I found it lacked flavor.

Accidentally used 1 lb of turnips and 1 lb of white beets (that I got From my CSA and thought were turnips).

Made recipe as written except for the swap of 1/2 beets an$ it was incredible. I think The sweetness of the beet and the tar ness of the turnip with the smokiness of the bacon made an awesome combo.  Best mistake I made in a long* time.

I loved this recipe!  This was a great introduction to turnips as I had never had them before.  I followed the recipe as is but, In hindsight, I don't think I would have finished the turnips in the bacon grease.  I felt like  the turnip flavor got lost after that step.  Nevertheless, I will definitely be making this again!

I had been getting an abundance of potatoes and purple turnips in my CSA box so I have made this a couple times. Obviously I used purple instead of orange turnips. I used a mixture of russet and fingerling potatoes. I added about 2 TBSP of minced garlic and an additional TSP of garlic powder. (We REALLY like garlic). I topped it with chives and sour cream as well. Delicious!

I followed the recipe pretty close and it turned out to be pretty good.   Season to taste is the key here, but it is an excellent lower carb side dish.  I'm glad I tried it, and I'll do it again.

Bacon Turnip Mash Haiku: "Better than I thought! But bacon is a rockstar! I'd eat this again!" I used more than a pinch of garlic powder, and regular, non-orange (?) turnips, but otherwise did the recipe as written. I found this to be a nice alternative to mashed potatoes, but the bacon (and the grease, oh my!) probably made it not so healthy, but definitely nummy.

Loved this recipe. Super simple, not a lot of ingredients but a lot of flavor. I think this would make a great side dish for breakfast instead of potatoes.

Very good and wonderful alternative to potatoes.  I used low sodium bacon and removed salt, and it still had wonderful flavor.

This only my second recipe with turnips.  Boiling them takes some of the flavor out.  These tended to be watery.  I had to drain alot of liquid out before serving.  Roasting them preserves the flavor much better.  Even adding bacon I had to add more salt and pepper to taste better.

Bf made this today and said he'd never made turnips like this before.  I've never had turnips, ever, but I thought it was pretty good.  He thought it was bland--I agree, kind of, but that's easy enough to fix.  Worked as an early lunch for us today.  He used turkey bacon so didn't really have any bacon grease.  Thanks for the recipe!
