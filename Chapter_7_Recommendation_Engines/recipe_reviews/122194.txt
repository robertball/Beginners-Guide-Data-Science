This was awesome! I had family over for dinner the other night, and they all left will full tummies and smiling faces! I read the reviews before trying this out and did change a few things I thought would help.  I added garlic powder to the flour before coating the chicken, and I replaced about 3/4 of the called amount of ketchup with bbq sauce.  I think in total I had more chicken than the recipe called for (I used boneless skinless breasts cut in half) so I also add about a cup of low sodium chicken broth to the sauce. The result was VERY tasty and moist chicken. I've added this to my recipe box, and been told I HAVE to make it again!! Thank you for sharing :)

This dish tasted so delicious!  I would change a few things: 1. Season the flour(salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and Tony Chachere's or seasoning blend of choice), brown the chicken in 2 batches to ensure even browning (does take quite a bit longer though, but worth it), add Liquid Smoke, cider vinegar, cayenne pepper, salt, parsley, and Tony Chachere's to the sauce mixture, or in a pinch, use bottled barbecue sauce. 
It smells so wonderful and is even better the next day!

Five stars for its simplicity alone. Very tasty. Had to cook the corn separately because we missed the 30 minute time mark, but the casserole was good nonetheless, even without the corn. We used thin-sliced boneless, skinless chicken breasts, which we seasoned and marinated first (using a little balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil). Added a little garlic to veggies.  Also added some spices to the flour. Used olive oil for the browning and sauteeing. Will definitely make this again.

I used pre-made BBQ sauce and boneless skinless chicken tenders. The only downside of this recipe, my husband noted, was the chicken didn't seem to absorb much of the BBQ flavor. Will make with dark meat next time and will marinate in BBQ sauce beforehand, probably skipping the browning step.

This dish tasted pretty good, I will use less chicken next time because 3 lbs is just way too much, there wasn't enough sauce to cover it all, I had to make more sauce and I would suggest using a brand name bbq sauce, this one was too ketchupy. Great on top of rice.

Recently, I prepared this recipe for my sister's family.  I assembled everything (adding a bit of clove and cinnamon to the sauce) and froze it.  I was not there when the meal was cooked and served but it received rave reviews!

My husband loved this.  We did use only breast and thighs and used extra virgin olive oil and added fresh garlic to the saute.  Thanks for the post.

I thought this was very good.  I left out the corn and added a little more brown sugar to the the sauce so it was almost like oven-baked sweet and sour chicken.  I also added roasted garlic and fresh thyme to the sauce and made it an hour or so ahead so the flavors could get blended well.  My husband and children ate it all up and my 5 yr old said that it was very good.  I served it with glazed carrots and the Oven Baked Potato Wedges from this website. I will definitely add this one to my recipe box!

Seemed like dinner seperates put together for a casserole recipe. It was good but didn't hit me as a hearty casserole that could handle being the main dish.

It did taste more like a sweet and sour chicken dish.  Next time I would add more spices for more flavor.  My husband liked it more than I did.

5 stars with just a few changes recommended by other reviewers. I split the ketchup with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Also seasoned chicken with garlic powder and added it to the ketchup mixture. (I love garlic.) I also forgot to do the flour-shake-in-a-bag thing. I used bone in drumsticks and thighs. Very good.

There wasn't enough sauce to cover the slices of chicken breast I used, and I thought it needed more spice.  Probably using a cutup chicken as the recipe states would work better?  Needless to say, there were leftovers of this while the Mexican chicken casserole was cleaned up.

I am very new to cooking fresh food (processed  food was mostly all I ate). So this was easy to prepare I added my own touch (cayenne pepper) and it was delicious.

I was a little worried when I started making this recipe that the ketchup flavor would be too strong. But the flavors of the sugar, peppers and onions mixed well with it. It reminded me a little of sweet and sour. I used boneless skinless breast and only baked them for 20 minutes so it wouldn't be over cooked. The only "problem" was with the reduced cooking time the corn was still cold, other than that it was a pretty good recipe that the family liked (even the kids!)

The outcome of this casserole is amazing. It's a little more time consuming than I'd like, but very tasty without being too heavy. At another reviewer's suggestion, I added garlic powder, salt and pepper to the flour before coating the chicken. I used about half a cup of barbecue sauce and half ketchup. I used a little less than three pounds of boneless skinless chicken breast cut in half and added half a cup of chicken broth to the sauce. Great suggestions that made for a great dinner. I served it with English Baked Potatoes from the site.

We collectively marked this 4.  My partner said it was a 4, his daughter thought it was a 4.5 and I thought it was a 3.5 but I didn't cook the celery enough so I think next time I'll make sure it is REALLY tender.  I did all the fixes in the reviews and apparently it was a huge hit.  A must make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was excellent!  I did not change much.  I just added a little salt and pepper to the flour.  I also added some garlic powder.  The only problem I had was the chicken should have been cooked just a little longer.  I will definately make this again.

My husband and I enjoyed this when I made it a few months ago, but not enough that I have made it again.  It was very good, just somehow not AWESOME good.

Plenty of work for an uncomplex flavor.  Doesn't freeze well - corn becomes tough. Bob not a fan.

I thought this was amazing!  It has such a unique blend of flavors.  It tastes a little like Chinese food... but with corn... that's what my husband said anyway.  I substituted boneless skinless chicken breast tenderloins (cut in half so they're nice sized chunks) and drained canned corn.  FYI, if you're counting Weight Watchers points like I am... this turns out to be a low point recipe!  I'm adding this to the family book of recipes and making it again.

Absolutely delicious. Cheap. Easy. Make sure to let it rest a little after its done, the juices will thicken and it is wonderful. Served it over rice!!!!!

It was a little on the dry side for my husband's taste, but maybe that was my fault.  The, taste, however, is delightful.

I tried this recipe, and my husband and I fell in love with it! Of course, it's just us two at home so we were eating it all week. HA!HA! But, we really enjoyed it. We did sprinkle it with Kraft shredded 2% Mild Cheddar Cheese, though. It was great to learn a new way of making chicken that is simple and very delicious. Thanks for posting this. Again, this is a great recipe, and it will definitely be around my family for a long time to come!

Not crazy about the sauce or the veggies and the corn thing.  And time consuming to put together would rather marinate chicken then BBQ on grill or bake in oven with out flour alot healthier and easy and faster.  Sorry we overall in the family have to pass not to our liking.

I loved this recipe!  I didn't have enough ketchup so I added a 1/4 cup of bbq sauce.  I also added a clove of garlic and seasoned the flour w/ garlic powder, seasoned salt and bbq seasoning.  Overall this recipe was super easy to make and very delicious:)

This was just ok for me, I think the ketchup flavor was too much and like others mentioned I think BBQ sauce would have been a better option. I was going to give it a 3 but my husband and daughter liked it a lot and both gaveit 4 stars. It was a nice change from the usual chicken recipes. Thanks for posting.

This was absolutely delicious! I am thrilled to have found a "down home, comfort food" way of making chicken! I think next time I might throw in some chopped potatoes along with the corn. Yummy! Thanks for sharing!!!

This was awesome! My husband and children loved it! I threw a can of corn on top (without thinking) BEFORE I cooked it and it still came out great. I used cut up chicken breasts (sliced) served it with mashed potatoes (I might try rice...cause it made a good sauce). Excellent and EASY!

I've used this recipe more times than I can count.  It's about time I rated it.  Definitely five stars.  I like using this recipe when I have company because it can be prepared in advance so no fussing around while the company is here.  I've never added the corn simply because we seldom eat corn.  Still was excellent.  The corn would add a contrast in colour. I always use boneless skinless chicken thighs and they work really well.  Bon appetit!

This isn't really much of a casserole. It's more like chicken swimming in BBQ sauce with a few veggies thrown in.  The taste is just all BBQ.  This was a good dish, but it's almost overwhelming.  I would perfer if it had a little more complexity other than just straight BBQ sauce...

this was a little different, but ok. followed it all and could probably make some personal changes. like frying the chicken first. i used drummies instead of bnls sknls. bbq gave the chicken good flavor, but didnt' really dig the sauce/corn mixture. wouldnt use to top anything, just discard it.

Oh man, This was so good!!! Everyone loved it. I did not put the corn over the top, but did serve it as a side dish. I used boneless thighs also. I will definitly be making this again.
