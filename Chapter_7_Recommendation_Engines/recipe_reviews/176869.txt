This salad is absolutely delicious! I omitted the bacon, halved the sugar, added some thin slices of pears and added pecans instead of almonds.

As I was reading this recipe I realized I forgot to mention that if you use it as a pasta sauce you need to omit the vinegar....for obvious reasons.  I also wouldn't mix the entire batch of sauce with all of the greens but drizzle each serving with a little bit.  Fresh sliced pears and/or candied pecans work very well with this salad.

Sooooo GOOD!  I loved this.  At first when I tasted the dressing I immediately thought, too sweet.  However the gorgonzola catches up quicky making it a wonderful combination of salty, tangy and sweet - PERFECT!  Also, the dressing processes up nice and thick and doesn't seperate!  As far as the salad part goes, I had to omit the nuts(allergy) but did add a sprinkle of green onions.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I have made this salad dressing twice now and I thought it was unbelievable. My mom wanted the recipe, so when she made this salad one night I had no idea it was the same one. I realized that I had never put the olive oil in my salad dressing and believe me, SO MUCH BETTER! It is like a pinkish colour and so flavourful and not oily at all. Delicious with the olive oil but even more delicious...without the olive oil.

Excellent! The dressing is also great 'unwarmed' for anyone squeamish about warming it. I warmed mine very happily. This is also a great salad for additions of...whatever. I served sliced apple with mine tonight, I think dried apricots would also be good. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this salad! I used a mix of baby spinaches, used reduced fat feta cheese and did not warm the dressing. It was excellent!

Delicious!  My only complaint is that there is too much olive oil.  My dressing separated due to too much oil, so I think 1/2 cup would be plenty.  I also only used 1/2 tsp. salt and real bacon bits instead of going to the trouble of frying up some bacon.  This dressing and the bacon go perfectly together and I loved it warm!  Excellent salad!

I subbed blue cheese in the dressing, b/c it was what I had on hand.  I thought the dressing was really good.  I ALWAYS use less evoo than called for b/c I like my dressings tangier and healthier.  I wuold add some veggies or something though to make it more interesting.  Or pears - that would taste really good against the strong cheese.

Loved this recipe. I used feta instead of the gorgonzola and didn't heat up the dressing and it was still very, very tasty!

Made this the other night. It is wonderful. Just what we were looking for. I mixed the ingredients ahead of time then just before serving put in the blender and then warmed it up on the stove. It was simple.

I LOVE this recipe!!! It's always a hit when I show up with it. Adding a bit of thinly sliced red onion could be a nice addition too but it's wonderful just the way it's written. Thank you for sharing!

This is basically what was called years ago wilted lettuce salad. This recipe calls for way too much dressing. It puddles, and is far too sweet. Cut down on the vinegar and the sugar and salt, then it will work better. Salad dressings should just be a hint on the salad. There should just be enough to kiss the lettuce leaves or other ingredients. I would make this again, but reall cut back on the vinegar and sugar.

One of the Best salad ever made. I did add a (steak) fillet on top to give it some structure and a very ripe pear. Added candied pecans from recipe from here and red onion. Put some Gorgonzola cheese crumbles on top as well. Crazy good.

The first words out of anyone's mouth when first tasting this salad is OMG! I added some extra bacon but otherwise stuck to original recipe. The dressing is simply awesome, and the other ingredients are the perfect complement. 

Thank you, Cheri, for such a perfect entry in my recipe book. :)

When I made this recipe for the first time, I guess I wasn't paying attention, because instead of baby greens I used Green beans!  Well I am so glad I did becuase it was sooooooo good!  Everyone loved it and it is now a favorite among our family dinners!

I took a chance and made this recipe for the first time when I was serving guests.  They LOVED it and wanted the recipe.  I did double the bacon, garlic and almonds.  Plus I added crumbled gorgonzola to the salad when I tossed it.  I will make this again for sure!

LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this! I seriously could've drank that dressing, it was that good! I did reduce the servings (for the dressing) to 3 and that was perfect for us. I also added some red onion to the salad, and that was a great addition. I made the dressing earlier in the day and stored it in the fridge..I ended up deciding not to warm it, but just let it come to room temp before pouring it over the salad. I think this is my new favorite! Thanks for sharing. :)

I absolutely LOVE this salad.  I served it at thanksgiving and my very large family loved it as well.  It's not often I find a recipe my entire family likes, but this one is a keeper!  I have since tried this recipe by substitiuting the red wine vinegar for balsalmic vinegar and reducing the olive oil to 1/2 cup, and adding thinly sliced pears.  I love it even more!  This salad looks impressive and complex, your guests never have to know it's not!

I used goat cheese because the grocery was out of gorgonzola.  I also added one thinly sliced shallot to the mix.  I also doubled the amount of sliced almonds for extra protein. If I make this again, I will probably cut the sugar in half as I do not favor sweet salads.

Worth frying bacon for!  I used a few more strips of bacon and a little extra crumbled Gorgonzola which thickened the salad dressing.  I also mixed baby Romaine, baby spinach and the usual spring mix.  It was just delicious.  Best salad I've had in a long time.

This is fantastic.  After cooking the bacon I did cook some chopped onions in the bacon grease and added to the salad - really added to the flavor.

This was very tasty. I used feta cheese (less expensive) and turkey bacon, but if I make it again I think I'd want to use "regular" bacon. My guests and I enjoyed this very much.

I have to rate this recipe twice; first with using just 2 tablespoons of olive oil drizzled into the food processor with other ingredients, my rate 5 stars.
Second, using original recipe, no mods or short cuts, yuk! Way too much olive oil....minus stars.. Will definitely make again, using my adjustments.

The dressing over baby greens was very good (I used less olive oil and less sugar.)  At another meal, I used the dressing over cooked baby red potatoes and it was great!

This recipe was fantastic! We had some leftover steak, so we sliced it thin and pan fried it to warm it up. We left out the bacon but kept the almonds and added craisins. Served it over mixed greens and baby spinach. Everyone loved it.  Second helpings for several of us! Next time we may add grilled asparagus.  Thanks! It was a perfect meal for a hot day.

Loved this! I hardly touched the chicken that I made to go with this. I just wish I had made more. Unfortunately, our grocery store didn't have gorgonzola so I had to go with the blue cheese someone else suggested. I can't wait to try it with the right cheese.

I hate cooking, but this recipe is so easy and delicious.  The only alteration I made(for convience) is I cook the bacon in a frying pan then I set the whole pan aside and let it cool down.  Then I put the blended mixture into the pan and warm it up on a low temperature.  (Do not pour mixture in the pan if it is HOT.)  But then I just pour contents of pan on to salad.  Granted the fat is a little higher this way, but it is so good.

Very easy to make and tasty.

I did not have enough red wine vinegar, so substituted balsamic.  Also, cut the sugar to 1.5 tablespoons.  Added about an extra ounce of gorgonzola.  Yum.

Love the dressing!  I was looking for a way to use up gorgonzola cheese and found this one.  The first time I made, I didn't pay attention about blending the cheese with the dressing but it was still good.  The second time, I used my mini processor & halved the oil.  I didn't have bacon nor almonds, just threw more cheese, candied walnuts, & a little bit of onions.

The 4 of us literally fought for seconds. It is that good. I was surprised that even my 5 and 7 year olds loved it. I didn't use bacon and almonds, question of preference, but added a Bosc pear instead (you must try it with a pear, so good!!), and I halved the sugar.  I put a tad less oil as well, question of preference once again. But it's a definite keeper, can't wait to have company over to make this. Oh and it's as good hot or cold. We've tried it both ways, they're both delish!

This recipe was absolutely wonderful, after reading the reviews I have to agree that the recipe calls for way too much oil after making it like it says.  I did vary the recipe since I didn't have any nuts I omitted them but did add some fresh pear. I had this for dinner tonight it looks like I'm going to have for dinner tomorrow. Can't get enough of the taste. 5 stars for sure.

My husband doesn't like blue cheese, but he loved this recipe. The dressing is even good later, if you just pop it in the microwave for a few seconds.

Used pears in place of the bacon for a healthier spin.  I've got a lot leftover (both salad and dressing), so I'm anxious to see how it is on Day 2.  REVISED:  Bumped this from 4 to 5 stars.  The leftovers were great . . . glad that I kept the dressing separate from the salad and then just reheated the dressing in the microwave before drizzling over salad portion.

Great salad. With the amount of dressing this makes, you could at least double the amount of greens. I’m making this again for sure. Simple and delicious.

I made this salad twice, the first time it was good, the second time, great.  I changed it by using arugula, omitted the bacon and almonds and added sliced fresh strawberries.  The sweetness of the strawberries and richness of the arugula, with the dressing drizzled to taste, was perfect and everyone loved it! The dressing is amazing and rich.

I took this to a party and it was such a hit.  Instead of the almonds the recipe called for I candied walnuts and almonds together. The sweet with the fresh bacon bits was DELICIOUS! Also, after making the dressing in the blender and heating it up I added chunks of gorgonzola to it.  SERIOUSLY DELICIOUS RECIPE

I must say, I've never made a salad dressing before but oh man, this is awesome. Since my son is too young for salad, I had leftover dressing and I just reheated it and it was more delicious than before! I will continue using this recipe. 2 thumbs way up.

This was a hit at a dinner gathering tonight!  I had some peppered bacon that added an amazing zing to the sweet/tang of the dressing.  The almonds add great crunch and the greens were wilty, but not flat!

Double yum!  Is it possible to give six stars?  I made the dressing only, exactly per the recipe, served cold on a salad, and it was fabulous!  My husband agrees.  Yum!

Huge hit at the neighborhood dinner party. I added some red onion and cut back on the sugar. Very yummy!

This is a fabulous salad.  You can make it ahead and then just dress it before you sit down.  Will definitely be in my rotation!

Loved this! The Gorgonzola in the dressing was not overwhelming, and it added so much to it. I omitted the almonds since a family member has an allergy, but the recipe was wonderful without them.

I will definitively make this again. I just shared the recipe with my mom because she love it! I used feta instead of Gorgonzola because for the life of me I could not find Gorgonzola anywhere!

I have made this recipe- EXACTLY AS WRITTEN many times and it is my favorite salad. The dressing is the best and so easy to make. It is the one salad my whole family (husband, 3 teenage daughters) all love. Thank you for sharing!

This dressing was soooo good I dipped my bread, bits of steak and my finger in the bowl to not waste a bit. My son likes food but I was skeptical if Gorgonzola was going to be too strong for him to like this. He loved it as well. Very delicious...my new favorite dressing.

I LOVE THIS DRESSING!  I didn't have red wine vinegar so used the white wine vinegar on hand.  Thanks for posting this, I will make it again and again.  Its so simple!
