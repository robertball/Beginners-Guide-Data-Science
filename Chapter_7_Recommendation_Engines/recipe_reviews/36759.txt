Alright, I was afraid that I was going to have to give this a thumbs down, BUT after I made it with the FROZEN watermelon cubes, it was DELICIOUS!!  If the watermelon isn't frozen.. think of it as "yuck watermelon puree" (as my brother-in-law put it).  Thanks-

Made this for our 4th of July party and it was fantastic! We even made a virgin batch by adding lemon soda instead of alcohol...TIP...make sure you don't overlap the watermelon when you freeze it, the pieces are hard to get apart otherwise...Great Recipe!!!!

I made these for Burning Man. They were asked for by our campmates three nights in a row. That says a lot. Even in dust storms, they were at my door asking if I could possibly whip one up. Huge success. My only complaint is how over-sweet they were. I cut back on the amount of sugar to let the watermellon really show through. They also make a huge, sticky mess. Don't let the blender sit for any time at all because it will become impossible to clean.

These margaritas were awesome!  I just happened to have some frozen watermelon cubes, so I was very pleased to come across this recipe.  I used Chambord liqueur instead of triple sec, since I had that on hand.  Sweet and delicious!  Great for a summer party!

These were great! We did it first with the crushed ice in the glass but thought it too much, so we dumped the ice and just put the watermelon margueritas in the glass -don't forget a straw!

I tried this recipe and it wasn't too well received. The problem was that it was warm and difficult to cool since it was so thick. I added ice to the mix but it lost flavor by doing so. I'm going to give them one more try when using frozen watermelon cubes as some other reviewers suggested.

These are scrumptious.  A big hit for summer get togethers.  I've made them three times so far this summer and we're addicted!

I've now made these twice, and I like them much better without the additional ice. Probably a bit too much trouble to make frequently, but a refreshing treat nonetheless!

This recipe is fantastic! I have made this at least 4 times and every time have received rave reviews. I do not use the ice cubes just the frozen blended watermelon. This is a must try for your next girls night out!

..I scooped seedless watermelon with my cookie scoop and placed them on a cookie sheet in the freezer.  When it was time for drinks, just threw them in the blender with the other ingredients (no ice) and had the best frozen margaritas!

I did freeze the watermelon cubes & I used raw sugar both to rim my glasses & in the margarita because I love it's flavor. Be sure & puree until it's smooth. In the first batch, I still had some watermelon that was a little chunky & icy. It's much better really smooth. I garnished w/ a watermelon wedge w/ rind attached. Best margarita I have ever had...I loved the watermelon flavor!

Just had these tonight with some friends. They were quite tasty!  Froze the watermelon cubes. We poured the first batch over the crushed ice as suggested. Second batch we put the ice right in the blender with the rest of the ingredients.  All preferred the second batch.  Had smoother, more liquid consistency.  Great mid/late summer drink - when watermelon is at it's best!  Thanks!

Only 1 of 4 people liked this recipe. I won't be doing this one again. It just didn't have enough flavor for the rest of us.

Broke my expensive KitchenAid blender on this one! But they were good/not great! Husband didn't like/ prissy daughter in law loved them!  Definitely DO cube watermelon and freeze individually before putting them in a bag (which I did NOT do and what ruined my blender!). Do not use ice...makes too watery.  I ended up with too much watermelon and not enough tequila, but was a good slushie, summer drink on a VERY hot day.  It used up the extra watermelon from my fruitbowl and nothing went to waste. Try it...you might like it...but make sure you have a heavy duty blender!

Pretty good, a little watery on the bottom. Next time we're going to mix the watermelon and ice together instead of piling the fruit on top.

I maded these for a Mexican theme dinner party & everyone LOVED them.  My guests told me to make sure I rated this recipe a 5 star.  There was not a drop left.  I did change the recipe a bit.  I didn't add the ice as others suggested.  Also, I did not have triple sec so I used Grand Marnier.  In place of the 3T sugar, I used 2T simple sugar syrup.  I also used one small seedless watermelon & got about 9 drinks from it.  This is a great summer drink.  I may try it with honeydew or canaloupe, too.
