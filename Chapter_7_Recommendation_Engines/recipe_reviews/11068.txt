These cookies have a very good flavor and are not too sweet. The dough is pretty easy to work with as well. I have been looking for a chocolate pinwheel cookie recipe that calls for cocoa instead of chocolate chips or baking chocolate, both of which are expensive and difficult to find where I live. Since I couldn't find one I adapted this recipe and it turned out great! I mixed the wet ingredients and then divided the mixture in half and added half the dry ingredients less two tablespoons of flour along with 2 tablespoons cocoa to one half of the wet ingredients  and the rest of the dry ingredients to the other half of the wet ingredients. I will definately make these again.

These are pretty good. I make them following the recipe during most of the year. But at Christmastime I leave out the cocoa and tint 1/2 red and the other 1/2 green. Then I brush them with milk and sprinkle with colored sugar. Very pretty.

I found this dough extremely difficult to roll, even after chilling. They tasted good, but my pinwheels didn't look nearly as nice as the picture, but that was probably my own fault.

these cookies looked perfect, and tasted as good as they looked!  i did bake one batch a few minutes longer than recommended, until the 'vanilla' part started to brown, and the chocolate flavour came out better.  i'd definitely be making these again!

Really good. I made a double batch, so I just made the recipe twice: one chocolate (2 squares chocolate), one vanilla. I chilled the rolled dough-log overnight. Since I only had unsweetened chocolate, they weren't too sweet, so I sprinkled some white decorator sugar on them before baking. I had 48 1/4"thick, 2-1/2"diameter cookies, baked for 8 minutes. I will make them again.

I made these cookies, for the first time, this Christmas.  My family raved about it even though I had made 4 other types ... these were their favorite.   I used powdered unsweetened chocolate, approx 4-5 tablespoons and 4-5 teaspoons of white sugar, instead of squares. I took a members advice and rolled the dough out between 2 pieces of parchment paper.  No need for a floured work table and floor getting dusted. To prevent slippage, I held the ends of the paper down with one palm and rolled a wooden rolling pin down the length of the paper.  After a few attempts, the dough softened and I got the knack of it.   I kept the paper on the bottom to transfer it and flip it onto the other rolled dough.  Easy, neat and hygienic.  Rolling was sushi-style. I used the cutaway edges to briefly mix the 2 doughs together, into a ball then partially flatten.  This made a marblized design.    I will be making these, again, for Easter, using pastel colors and different flavors.

These were very tasteless! When rolled out and rolling up into log the dough kept cracking as well. I won't be making these again.

I found this recipe very simple and the cookies turned out great. I didn't use chocolate in the recipe, but rather red and green food coloring for Christmas cookies as another rater suggested. Thanks for the recipe. Will be using again soon

Chocolate Pinwheels were a favorite of mine growing up! These cookies were delicious.. the only problem I had was the chocolate layer being a little drier than the vanilla layer, and had a tendency to crumble.

Good and simple cookies?  I followed the ingredients exactly, but made my cookies into checkerboards.  I made just over 5 dozen cookies.  They were not big cookies and I cut them very thin.  Overall , they looked adorable and tasted good, not too sweet.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe. I followed the recipe to a T and found the dough to be un-rollable. I added additional flour to roll it and still no luck. The dough itself is good, so I just took a little off of the chocolate mix and then a little off of the regular mix and rolled them together in my hand. They taste pretty good as well.

I used baking cocoa instead of the chocolate chips. As a result, I also added more vanilla (up to 1/2 tsp) to the chocolate half of the dough. These are fun and cute. Great addition to my Christmas cookie gifts both in flavor and appearance; these cookies made them look even more festive. Several possibilities, too. I made the swirly version. Look forward to trying the half/half look, and I have grand ideas for things like a yin/yang version, too! I bet you could (with patience) manage quarters, sixths or eighths, as opposed to the half/half. That would require solid chilling, and careful division & re-joining of rolls. Ooh, and how irresistible would they be if the white half were green & minty?!?!

I'm sitting here eating this cookie while I type.I used  Hersey's cocoa powder for the unsweetened chocolate.The measurements are on the can. It just might be that semi-sweetened would be better. Here's the amounts
for equal to 1 ounce of semi-sweet. 1 Tablespoon cocoa powder, 2 tsp shortening + 3 1/2 tsps sugar.I didn't bother with wax paper or a rolling pin, I just flattened the dough on a floured board,brushed on the milk and add the layer and rolled it up.On the down side no one even mentioned that 5 minutes in a oven is never enough time to bake a cookie, mine stayed in for 9-12 minutes.Also I added 1 tsp lemon juice & 1/2 tsp almond flavor, so mine tasted ok.

The dough starts out quite crumbly, but you just have to squish it around a little and it becomes the perfect consistency. My pinwheels turned out perfect - they look super pro! I added some orange zest to the white dough for a great flavour combination. Next time I think I'll double the chocolate.

I made two versions, one as written, and one for Christmas, with food coloring and colored sugar.  I do not like the chocolate version, it tastes very salty.  I'm not quite sure why!  I used good Ghirardelli chocolate, but it just doesn't taste good.  The Christmas version are much better!  I colored half the dough green, and put red sugar on it, and put green sugar on the remaining batter.  One thing I would change is to eliminate spreading the dough with milk.  Once in the oven, the milk and sugars ran together and made quite a mess, so the cookies have  a kind of "runny" look, but they taste pretty good.  I'll try them again, with modifications and no chocolate!

The cookies were tasty but a little difficult to make. I used a review suggestion and made the chocolate half with 2 tbsp of powdered cocoa after omitting 2 tbsp of flour mixture. I had to use a lot of flour to roll them out. The dough was really sticky and hard to work with. It even stuck to the wax paper.   I had to mend it here and there with extra dough from the corners. They looked cute and tasted fine.

Excellent! I did agree that the chocolate dough didn't have much flavor.  I added some more chocolate powder until it was chocolaty enough for me.  I am a bit of a chocoholic though. I also really like how easy the dough is to freeze.

Absolutely wonderful cookie. Quick to mix, rolled them, froze the dough and cooked them the next day.  I rolled them between pieces of plastic wrap (no parchment paper on hand) and they rolled out PERFECTLY even without extra flour and didn't need to brush milk on - I forgot that step and they were fine.    Since chocolate wasn't on hand I used cocoa and a bit of extra sugar as reviewers suggested. Definitely will double the recipe next time  I make a batch.
