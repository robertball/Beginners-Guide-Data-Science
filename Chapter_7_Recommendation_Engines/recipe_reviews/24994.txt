The recipe should suggest you put cottage cheese in a blender and cream it first.  This recipe was lumpy and had a gritty texture.  Also needed more sugar and lemon juice.

This recipe was pretty good.  I used ricotta cheese like it said I could and half mascarpone cheese.  It was good.  This is only my second time making cheesecake so don't know if it was me or the recipe but was hoping for a creamier texture. I would use this recipe again!

Too much liquid--the bottom crust absorbed it and was spongy. The curds were hard, like undercooked rice pudding. Bake crust for a short time to seal it? Drain the cottage cheese? Grind it first in a blender? Not mentioned in the recipe. :(
