My wife is from Thailand so we know the flavors.  We were mixed as to whether to even try this because I didn't want to waste a corned beef if the flavors were too "conflicted".  On the other hand, the "same old" corn beef and cabbage IS kind of boring.  WOW was this good. The ammounts of coconut milk and curry paste were just enough to "hint" at the changed recipe and there was a richness in the broth that we both loved.  Only change I made was to use a crock pot instead of a dutch oven.  Now my wife and I are talking about whether to "push" the coconut milk and curry to make them a little more prominent.  We LOVED this as written and I recommend this as a change.  It is NOT radical nor conflicted at the table.  thanks rc

This was awesome! It is definitely not the norm for this dish but was very good.  I cooked it in a crockpot for 6 hours and cutting it was like butter! Serve with white rice with the sauce over the top for more of an oriental flair.

Made it twice now... Both times in slow cooker on low for 12+ hours added cabbage in last 2-3 hours. (5-7 lbs meat, be careful with larger size meats, barely fit in crockpot and had to adjust potatoes quantity to fit!)
 Second time around 10x the curry paste and increased the ratio of cocoanut milk to water.
Fantastic as written, but even further enjoyed the additional flavor/heat second time around, reminded of great curry dishes in Singapore. Plated it for St Patrick's party guests with jasmine rice and touch of fresh cilantro on top!

Thanks to the wonderful participants in the reviews, I started to cook in a crockpot with double the ingredients as suggested. Even after doubling the red curry paste, I still could not get the essence of the curry to come through. I tripled the suggested amount to 6 tsps, added another can of coconut milk, and another tablespoon of fish sauce, trying to create a creamier balance. Threw in carrots, celery and onion, but held the potatoes until the end, cutting into bite size pieces and boiled them 20 minutes in the broth after corned beef was done. Yummy.  At the same time I cooked a Guinness Corn Beef in another crock pot. 10 hours later, there was not much difference in flavor of the beefs. The texture was very moist on the Coconut Curry one. Amazingly moist compared to the beer broth beef with less pronounce grain, and hints of the curry linger in the taste buds. Both fell apart and were consumed without a scrap left. I cook twice a day for 15 office employees. Will not be afraid of that curry next time! and will try to make a gravy with that broth next time, using a heavy cream and yogurt base. Thanks Chef John! Awesome!

My husband and I really enjoyed this, but honestly the coconut and curry paste flavors didn't come through as much as I was hoping, my husband didn't realize this was supposed to have a Thai influence at all until I told him what I'd used.  I will most likely make this again but up the seasonings.

Chef John ... You knocked this one out of the park. I love Thai and as much as I enjoy corned beef, it's always reserved for St. Pat's and the occasional sandwich. I am amazed how well this works. Thanks!

Loved it! Didn't add any water or carrots or potatoes - just Savoy cabbage and it was fabulous! Next time I make it (and there will be many, many more times!) I will add the carrots and serve it over mashed potatoes.

I used beef roast instead.  I threw this all in the crockpot.  I couldn't taste the thai flavors. It's meat, vegetable and juice.. Maybe if I cooked it outside the crockpot then it would have been better.  It was still good but not "out of this world full of flavor"

My family does not like corned beef and cabbage but they loved this recipe! Changes - cooked in crockpot on high 6 hours (low for 10 would probably be even better).  2 cans water, double curry paste, fish sauce and tomato paste. Used unpeeled red potatoes and skipped the cabbage and celery (just because I was out so I added 2 extra carrots). 
Even better on day 2 when served over rice.

Excellent!  I always buy four or five corned beefs every March. I love having a new easy recipe that is delicious! I used the instant pot for 70mins on high pressure.  Excellent!

Yesterday was  St.  Patrick's Day. I was asked to do Corned Beef and  Cabbage for  the  Elks  Lodge. I used your  recipe for Coconut  milk corned beef. I cooked  18+ lbs.  of  brisket  & I   should have doubled that. I have never gotten raves like that before & I've been cooking most of my  74 years.

This is a great recipe. As always Chef John hits a home run. I did add additional Carrots and Celery (Personal preference) but followed the recipe in all other areas. the corned beef was so tender you could cut through it with a fork and had a good combination of Corned Beef, coconut and curry. The vegetables were very much like I have had in Thailand. My wife said we will never cook the corned beef the old way again.

Being  variation of a wonderful classic, it was certainly different from the traditional meal. What was liked most about this recipe was the hot spice addition. I added more to taste. I doubt I will make it again unless I go on a corned beef and cabbage bender and need a variation.

My husband is part Irish and he loves his corned beef and cabbage!! I, however, find it a tad boring so this year I went looking for a recipe that might take the ho-hum out of the dish. I came across this recipe and decided to make it. When my husband heard I had yet again adulterated a traditional recipe he was a little beside himself. No one complained though when they were eating it. The result was not overpowering Thai, it was a hint of Thai and really, it was delicious, so much better than the standard corned beef and cabbage recipe. I will definitely make this again and from now on, this is the recipe I'm using when making corned beef. I found the poster's original recipe on his blog and it indicates you can use a corned beef but don't use the seasoning packet (the recipe posted here doesn't specify this), so that is what I did. Otherwise, I made the recipe as written in a dutch oven on the top of the stove.

Regarding the instruction in direction number 1 to "skim off any foam that accumulates," I've found that using an inexpensive plastic strainer with a fine mesh, in one of the smaller diameter sizes, works infinitely better for this purpose than any cooking spoon. (And it works great with all sorts of recipes.) The finer the mesh of the strainer, the better. Such a strainer corrals the foam far more effectively than any spoon, while leaving behind the broth or liquid that needs to remain in the pot. After each skim, just rinse the strainer under running water. If you happen to skim off any floating ingredient along with the foam, just rinse the foam off of the ingredient and dump it back into the pot.

I've made this many times over the years. It's really the only way we do corned beef now. Today, I happened to have an extra can of coconut milk in the cabnet plus the one I bought for the meal. I used both and lessened the water by 12oz.   I really think the extra can makes a difference. However, I would have been fine with just one because of cost.
