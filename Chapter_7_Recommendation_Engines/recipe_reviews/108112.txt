Incredibly bland. It smelled delicious, but the smell was not reflected in the flavor. There is nothing I can think of that would save this recipe for myself.

i made this recipe for my husband and i and we loved it. it was a great way to get our son, who hates any vegetable besides green beans, to eat something different. it was fun to make and it was delicious. i would recommend this dish to anyone who wants to revisit the carribbean or if they want to try something different.

I thought this had a lot of flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I served as a side dish for dinner with mango chicken and cuscus.  It was perfect.

I modified the recipe slightly (did not add pineapple and added 1/4 tsp cloves.) perfect winter comfort food.

I added chopped apples to this fritter;) These were super good. I did add some brown sugar. NOTE: Use a tablespoon, not a scoop like I did, mine a bit doughy, my bad, haha. Perfect breakfast along with sausage patties. YummmO Thank you I L T E ;)
