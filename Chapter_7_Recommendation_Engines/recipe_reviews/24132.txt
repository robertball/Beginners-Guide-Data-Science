This was really good and really easy. I did make a couple of changes. I personally don't like globs of cream cheese in my breakbast bakes. I added a tbsp of sugar and a tsp of cinnamon to the cream cheese and mixed it until creamy with my electric mixer. Then I spread it on each piece of bread before I cut it. A bit of extra work but it tastes better to me. I also added a tsp of vanilla to the eggs. Next time I would add another apple and mix it in with the bread as well as on the top. Thanks, I will make again!!

I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and only used 6 eggs, half of the cream cheese, and I added vanilla and cinnamon.  I also upped the temp to 350, and it was delicious!  Moist, but not soggy.  It even kept well for several days in the fridge, and I ate it for breakfast!  Yummy!

I have never had so many people ask me for a recipe!  I made it three times and each time it was the hit of the brunch.  Two tips:  I recommend Pepperidge Farm bread--it's denser than the store brand I used the first time.  I also used fat-free half and half the second two times to lighten the calories, it went undetected.  (Next time, I'm also going to try egg beaters!)  Really a great recipe.

I made this for about 20 guests and people loved it! I followed some of the other users ideas and used apple pie filling instead of apples, cut the eggs back from 8 to 6,used fat free half and half, spread the cream cheese instead of using cubes and baked it for about an hour. I also used Trader Joe's cinammon swirl bread, it's thick and dense. It's really easy and super good.

Update:  I had no 1% milk, which is what I normally use, and I had very little half and half.  I looked up a sub for half and half and it said I could use evaporated milk so I used a can of evaporated milk with half and half added to make 2 cups total.  I now see why some said it was like bread pudding. It is much lighter and fluffier using 1% and I won't make it with heavier milk again.  Original review: As per other suggestions I used only 3/4 package (6oz) of cream cheese spread on pepperidge farms cinnamon swirl bread (no raisin fans in our home), 1 can of apple pie filling sprinkled with cinnamon, only 6 eggs, two cups of milk and 1/4c. margarine. I covered well and then used three bags of beans (bags of water would work if closed well) on top to weigh it down and make sure the egg mixture was absorbed evenly. It cooked at 350 degrees for one hour, covered with foil first 30 minutes to keep it from drying out.  It came out perfect. Fluffy, not too moist and absolutely delicious.  Can't wait to have it again!!

This recipe turned out great.  I did substitute a few items.  I used cinnamon swirl bread for the bread, fat free half and half for the cream,egg substitute for half of the eggs,light cream cheese for the cream cheese and I didn't use any apples.  No one in our Sunday School knew that it was made light.  Everyone loved it.  This was very easy to make.

This recipe is amazing!!  I cooked it this weekend for a small group of people and everyone absolutely loved this recipe.  I changed the recipe slightly by lightly sprinkling brown sugar and cinnamon over the cream cheese and cubed raisin bread. Also this recipe is quick to make!

I hate to be the odd man out, but I was not impressed with this recipe.  It was very plain and mushy--maybe adding less liquid would make it a bit better.  I cooked it for over an hour; if you decide to try it, and use the same amount of liquid the recipe calls for, plan for extra baking time. Even the people I made it for seemed to agree, and even adding a spice (like cinnamon) would not make it better. I am not making this again--there are so many other recipes on this website that are better than this. :)

Very good.  I used a loaf of semolina raisin bread (day-old at my store for half the price) and added my own cinnamon to the mix.  Used neufchatel cheese and fat-free half and half.  I refrigerated overnight and didn't find it too soggy at all.  I did bake at 350 for longer than specified.

I didn't have the time to let mine soak 2 hours, but it was so tasty! The perfect combination of flavors and it smelled like cinnamon buns while cooking.

Served with apple cider syrup from this site and it was wonderful!  Used a local cinnamon raisin bread and had them slice it thick which makes all the difference.  Added vanilla to the cream cheese mixture and then spread it onto the bread slices as another reviewer suggested.  Added a 1/4 cup more of raisins and apples for extra goodness!  Oh my, this was wonderful!

I changed a few things to make it more like baked stuffed french toast. I layered the bread slices across the bottom and then spread the cream cheese (creamed together with a little vanilla,cinnamon, and sugar)then a layer of sliced apples and finally another layer of bread slices. Pour the egg mixture over the top and sprinkle with more cinnamon/sugar.

This strata was soooo delicious!!  I modified the recipe according to some of the other members:  I added cinnamon and sugar to the cream chesse then spead it on each slice of Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon and Raisin bread before cubing; added additional raisins; and increased the temperature to 350 degrees for 1 hour, the first half-hour covering with foil.  It turned out absolutely perfect.  It was not too sweet and the addition of maple syrup on the finished product was even more scrumptious!  A real winner at our home.

This was very blah.  Very similiar to bread pudding texture.  I even used cinnamon raisin bread and extra cinnamon.  We ate it with extra sugar and cream over it.  I might make again, but with alterations.

my husband LOVED this, even though i will definitely change it up a bit next time.  i used 2 large apples plus extra raisins, and only used 7 eggs and 1 3/4 cup milk due to previous reviews of it being "too soggy."  it ended up too dry on top, though my hardworking husband didn't notice one bit.  for the leftovers, i soaked them in more milk & egg & vanilla & rum overnight, adding a bit more cream cheese, and he went NUTS.  he's already asking for it again!  thank you for the recipe!

I used Pepperidge Farm vanilla swirl bread and a cup of blueberries instead of apples since they're in season.  Made for a delicious blueberries and cream concoction. I bet this recipe would be a good base for all different types of fruit and bread.

If you're looking for a time saver....this is it!!  Instead of chopped apple, I used about 3/4 of a can of apple pie filling, added a tablespoon of vanilla to the egg/cream mixture and then sprinkled cinnamon on top.  I also baked it slightly longer and, since I'm from central NY, used only real maple syrup.  This is excellent!

I made this for Christmas brunch and it turned out great. I used Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Swirl bread. I mixed fat-free cream cheese with a tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla and spread the mixture on the bread before cubing it. I used 2 large rome apples and a generous sprinkle of raisins. I cut the butter to 4 Tbsp. and added 1 tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla and fat-free half and half to the egg mixture.  I soaked the strata overnight the refrigerator and weighed it down with bags of beans as suggested. It was neither too soggy nor dry  I forgot to add the syrup to the eggs so I poured 1/3 cup over the top before baking and that was fine.  I look forward to making this again.

This was delicious.  Because I'd read to cut the cream cheese in very small chuncks, I decided to warm it first and then actually MIX it with the cubed cinnamon bread.  So, all the pieces were coated with cream cheese when I layered it on the bottom.  That took care of the "problem."  I did have to bake it a bit longer and it was still a little "mushy" to me, but everyone raved about it on Easter morning.  And it was so nice to make it the night before and just pop it in the oven when I got up!  No fuss that day!!  VERY GOOD!!!

I made this for a baby shower brunch, and while I didn't try it, everyone raved about it (mommy-to-be, especially). I used french bread instead of raisin bread, so I added cinnamon and about 1/4 cup sugar and left out raisins.  I used 7 medium sized eggs (didn't taste eggy at all, I was told). I microwaved the cream cheese for 15 seconds, added a drip of vanilla extract and 1/4 cup powdered sugar then spread it over the first layer of bread. I left it in the oven about 1 hour (I set the timer for 45, tuned the timer off when it went off, but forgot to take it out of the oven!) It was nicely cooked, however, very moist and slightly puffy.  I drizzled a little syrup over the top after I took it out of the oven. No leftovers and have already forwarded the recipe to several guests.

Loved it, though I tweaked it a bit like other users.  I added 2 heaping Tbsp brown sugar, 1 Tbsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon to the cream cheese and mixed it really well, spread it on the bread, then cubed it.  I cut the eggs to 6 instead of 8 and used 2 cups of apples instead of one.  Dusted with powdered sugar after it baked and it came out Fantabulous.  I make this every time it is my turn for breakfast at church.

This recipe is delicious as written. I accidently baked it at 350 for 45 minutes and it turned out perfectly. It was neither too soggy or too eggy. I prefer the pieces of cream cheese - it makes for a yummy bite! I used 2 medium sized granny smith apples & tossed in a few teaspoons of sugar & a few dashes of cinnamon. Vanilla would have been nice too. I also used Pepperidge Farms cinnamon raisin bread - I love the bread pudding like texture of this dish & drizzled it with real maple syrup! Maybe I will try the fat-free half & half - I don't know if it is worth the risk!

This Strata was easy and delicious.  Based on advice from earlier reviews, I increased the temperature to 350, but it still took more than 45 minutes to cook.  I baked it until it had puffed up and started to brown on the tops and edges.  This baked it to the right consistency for me.  I don't like a soggy interior.  Also, I only used 4 oz of cream cheese.  As I was putting the cream cheese in the casserole, it seemed that I had enough when I had used only half the package.  I think for my taste it was the right decision.  There was just enough cream cheese to make it creamy and to offset the apples and sweetness of the bread, but not so much that it overwhelmed the other flavors and textures.  My family really enjoyed the dish.

It was a hit at the office! It takes a while to cube the bread, so I left the slices whole on the bottom to save some time.

This is a tradition in our home for close to ten years.  I make this every Christmas Eve, so that when we wake up Christmas morning, I pop this in the oven, and by the time the presents are done, breakfast is ready (or close enough!).

The only changes I have made over the years is that, it's Christmas, I use heavy cream!! We skip all raisins, (DH, not a super fan) and we ADD cooked, crumbled, maple sausage.  SO YUMMY.

I made this for Christmas Eve morning brunch and it was a bit hit with my crowd.  I did make the following changes and it turned out perfect:  used 6 eggs instead of 8, only 2 cups of half-and-half, 2 medium sized Granny Smith apples sprinkled with cinnamon and suger after layering them, and spread the cream cheese (softened) on the bread before cubing it.  I did mix it up the night before, but made sure that I really pushed the all the bread down under the plastic wrap so that all of the bread got some of the batter on it before putting it in the refrigerator.  In the morning, I cooked it at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  Everyone loved it, including my sister's picky boyfriend, and my boyfriend even had 2 helpings (he's not a big eater normally).  We paired it with a potato casserole that my boyfriend's brother and wife brought and bacon and had plenty for our crowd of 6 adults and 6 kids.

This would also be a good base for other kinds of fruit when in season.  Some we came up with were blueberries, peaches, and pears.

Easy to make and great "do-ahead" for company and holiday mornings.  Careful with what kind of apples you use...it can make a BIG difference.  If you have a Trader Joe's near you, use the cinammon raisin bread from there.  It was great!  I added some cinammon.  As I was making another casserole, I baked at 350 for nearly one hour. I thought it was perfect...not too soggy and nicely brown/crispy on top.  Not real sweet which my husband lies.  I added more maple syrup as did others.  Everybody loved it.

This was really great! Only adjustment I did was to mix 1 tsp. sugar with 1 tsp. cinnamon and sprinkle on top before baking. Made a delicious crust on top!

Based on other reviews, I made the following changes:  Used a can of apple pie filling instead of dicing and peeling my own apples, added a couple capfuls of vanilla, and upped the temperature to 350, keeping it covered with aluminum foil until just the last 20 minutes or so.  I also used Neufchatel in place of regular cream cheese.  It baked beautifully.  The top was golden and the texture was perfect - fluffy and soft-chewy, but cooked through and not too soft.  This was very delicious and the preparation could not have been simpler.  I will definitely make this again.    I didn't give it a full five stars, because I do wish there were a little something to contrast with so much sweetness.  I had also made a make-ahead breakfast casserole to which we added bacon, and I couldn't help but think I wish I'd thrown a teaspoon of brown sugar in the pan with the bacon and then added that to this instead of to the other pan.  That little bit of salt from the bacon could have been just the thing.  I'm going to make this again and will try that.

I made this for an office brunch: not a scrap left, and four people asked for the recipe.  The only full-calorie ingredient I used was the butter (used fat-free half & half, neufchatel cheese, and Better 'n' Eggs egg substitute), and this came out great.  I only soaked it for an hour and forty minutes, as that was all the time I had.  I did weight the casserole with a bag of water, as someone suggested in an earlier review.  I set the oven to 375 degrees, then set it back to 350 when I put the casserole in the oven.  I plan to make another this weekend for my family!

I covered overnight with Saran wrap, placed a dish on top and then a heavy can. Made the bread absorb all the liquid. I would add a little cinnamon sugar to the apples to sweeten it a little. Definitely need syrup. Will make again.

What a delicious dish!  After reading the reviews, I melted the cream cheese in the microwave, and tossed it with the first layer of bread cubes, so that everything was coated.  I didn't have raisins, so I added some dried cranberries that I had on hand, and sprinkled the top with cinnamon and sugar.  I baked it for an hour and a half, which was perfect.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was delicious - I made it New Year's morning for our overnight guests.  I followed another suggestion and used fat-free 1/2 and 1/2 - it went undetected.  I would suggest dicing the cream cheese into small pieces - it doesn't melt and my son complained that he got a mouthful of cream cheese.  I would definitely make this again.

I first had this at a friend's brunch - was absolutely yummy so I made it for myself later.  Peapod didn't bring the raisin bread, so I used the multigrain bread I had in my fridge, plus extra cinnamon and raisins.  It turned out lovely - I think the nuts in the multigrain bread were a good addition.  And it lasted in the fridge very well for a few days of yummy leftovers.

Fabulous recipe, though a bit basic and after reading through previous users' reviews I made some tweaks per their suggestions as follows:

Cream Cheese - I spread on bread prior to cubing. Time consuming to cut up bread with cream cheese but worth it as I don't like chunks of cream cheese as was suggested by the original recipe. 

Eggs - I used 8. Will use 6 next time. 

Spices - I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg, and .25 tsp cloves. I sprinkled a bit of brown sugar over the apples as well since some users suggested it wasn't sweet enough. 

Apples - I opted for 1 large can of apple pie filling but felt I could have used 2 cans, though next time I will use 1 can apple pie filling and maybe 2 medium fresh apples for a bit of "crunch". 

Baking temp/time - Per users' reviews, I baked uncovered at 350 degrees for 60 minutes. Perfect! Not soggy in the least. Refrigerates well, and tastes even better the next morning in my husband's opinion ;-) I think that if you are a real cook you will love it. For those who said it was bland or soggy, my thoughts are that they are beginner or amatuer cooks bc this was my first time making it and I am by no means a professional chef and it was super easy to prep Christmas Eve, and even easier to pop in the oven the next morning for Christmas breakfast. Perfect timing - pop in before presents and voila! Complete breakfast is ready by the time the gifts are unwrapped and GREAT when you are feeding a large crowd! Happy cooking my friend ;-)

I made this for our church's Easter breakfast. It looked so yummy and had such good reviews that I didn't try it out first. It was a HUGE hit and I enjoyed making something new.  We didn't get to eat it for about an hour after I took it out of the oven (it hung out in my Pyrex carrier), and I did not take extra maple syrup.  It did not need it (probably because of the pie filling sweetening it up) but when I make it at home I will drizzle on more because you really can't have too much real maple syrup!

Based on other reviews (and my being too tired to face peeling and dicing apples) I did substitute the can of apple pie filling for the diced apples.  I also added a couple of handfuls of Craisins.  I also heeded the advice to up the temp to 350 and baked for 50 minutes.  I also used a few bags of beans to weigh it down as it soaked overnight.

The strata puffs up A LOT, so be sure to use a large enough baking dish - not all 9x13 baking dishes are created equal.  It will settle back down as it sits - after 5 minutes I was able to put the lid of my carrier on it with no problem.

Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

I have made this recipe several times.  The first exactly per recipe.  Since then, we have opted to eliminate the apples, and top it with chopped pecans before baking - then drizzle generously with caramel sauce (the kind you buy for ice cream) when it comes out of the oven!  YUMMM - Carmel Pecan French Toast Strata!

This has been a crowd pleaser whenever I bring it to a brunch. 

Modifications- I beat the cream cheese w/ a hand mixer, add in 2tsp of vanilla extract and a tsp of cinnamon. I also use whole slices  of bread and I spread the cream cheese mix on top of each slice as a previous reviewer said. I use the Cinnibon bread and golden raisins, it's amazing

Made this for a bridal shower brunch. Didn't change a thing. Everyone loved it and had so many requests for the recipe. Loved the fact it could be prepared the evening before and just put in the oven in the morning.  This is a can't miss yummy brunch recipe.

We enjoyed this so much and so did our out of town company.  I used Trader Joe's cinnamon swirl bread as I do not care for raisins.  Also made half a recipe using 2 eggs and egg substitute for 2 eggs.  Also used peaches, fat free cream cheese and 1% milk for much less grams of fat and it tasted just wonderful.  The house smelled so good when it was cooking.

I plan on cooking this for tomorrow with the added suggestions of vanilla, etc. I wanted to make a suggestion to people who think this is too soggy. Prepare the strata the night before.  Cover with plastic wrap.  Your bread should be day-old (left out overnight to dry or dried in the oven). Put a couple of 1lb. bags of dried beans or rice in a ziptop bag and put them on top of the strata. Let sit in the fridge on a tray overnight.  Your bread will soak up all of the moisture and your strata will not be soggy.

My family loved this. I followed other people's advice and used only 6 eggs and added cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla, only I added mine to the egg mixture instead of the cream cheese. When I make this again, I will not dice the bread; I'll arrange whole pieces so that it's more like french toast. I'll also spread the cream cheese on the bread like others have suggested because cream cheese doesn't really dice and trying to get it in small dollops was a pain.

I also added some apple pie spice to apples ( I used 3 granny smith apples. Everyone just loved it. It is for sure a keeper, I can't wait to have company again so I can make it.  Thanks

This was good.  I made a couple changes.  Added vanilla to the eggs, sprinkled cinnamon over apples, only used 6 eggs and reduced the half and half to 2 cups.  I let it sit in the fridge for 3 hours prior to baking and I don't think it was too mushy.

The recipe is a little bland as written, but it's pretty easy to spruce it up. I added 1 teaspoon each of vanilla and cinnamon, 3/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon of cloves to the egg/cream mixture. I also used sugar-free syrup, half a package of neufchatel in place of a full package of cream cheese, and reduced the eggs from eight to six. I've had it with and without apples, and it's good both ways. Definitely bake a little longer/hotter than listed, or it may be pretty mushy in the middle. An hour at 350 was perfect for me. It's also *much* tastier the day *after* baking. It takes on a moister consistency, which some people might not like, but it gives the post-baking flavors a chance to meld together nicely.

The recipe was a hit with Easter brunch at my home.  The changes I made were; doubling the recipe (used 11x15x3 glass dish), on one loaf I spread cream cheese on the slices of Pepperidge Farm Cinn Raisin bread, the other loaf I did not, the 2nd pkg of cream cheese was chunked and put on top of the apple layer, I added 1Tbsp of vanilla to the liquids, I used 2 ups of 1% milk (rather than 1/2 and 1/2) and 2 cans of apple pie filling carefully layered (rather than the work of peeling and coring fresh apples). It was covered with saran wrap and soaked overnight (didn't need to weigh it down).  baked at 350 for 1 hr then kept in warming oven til serving.  Next time I will spread the cream cheese on all of the bread...chunks were not the favorite.  One 4x4 slice was enough for each person.

I've made this twice now (thought maybe I did something wrong the first time since it was so highly rated) and it's pretty good, but I won't make it again. The second time I made this it was for my daughter's sleepover crowd,  and they didn't really care for it either.  Tasted better after it cooled longer (30-45 minutes).  I drizzled a LOT more than 1/4 c. real maple syrup over top of strata (I basically drowned my slice in syrup) & that improved the flavor also (duh!)

Trust me, you will not be disappointed.  I was worried when I saw some of the reviews.  I added the apple pie filling and vanilla as suggested, not as much creme cheese, and left the rest as is.  It is delish.  The staff at my school loved it, and the whole thing was gone in a matter of minutes.  I will use this recipe again.  Thank you.

I made this as a Mother's Day brunch, and it turned out fantastic! I didn't have cinnamon raisin bread on hand, so I just used white sandwhich bread. Like other reviewers mentioned, I spread the bread with the cream cheese (which I had mixed with a tsp of vanilla, some cinnamon and allspice) and laid the slices in the casserole dish instead of cubing the bread and sprinkling it with the cream cheese.
I also doubled the amount of apples, and coated them with a little cinnamon and sugar before adding them.
I followed the rest of the recipe to the "T," and we all loved it! My mom said it was the best part of her Mother's Day...definitely a keeper!

This was a hit at my Easter brunch.  Made some simple changes, added enough apples to cover the pan, used the whole slice of bread instead of cubes, added a tsp of vanilla extract to the egg mix.

I made this for breakfast the other day and it was DELICIOUS!!! Who knew all those ingredients combined could make such a great dish! I did add extra raisins because I just love them and really didn't need to add much syrup because it is pretty sweet by itself. The only thing I would change next time is to cut the cream cheese into even smaller pieces. Mine were a bit big, but it was still really good! Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe! :)

Had this for Christmas morning brunch.  Everyone loved it. I did use an Italian bread w/ raisins, dried cranberries and almonds.  The texture of the almonds added something extra that we really enjoyed alot.

I made this for a family reunion and used cinnamon bread (my sister hates raisins:)).  I added 2 eggs to the recipe and it set very well.  Texture was great and the kids loved it - as did the adults - it is rich so if i make it again i will cut down on the cream cheeses. I used fat free half and half which worked beautifully.

Boy, did I score the attaboys on this one. What I did different: Used lots more apples -- about 2.5 cups total. Added 1/2 cup golden raisins, and together with the increased apples, the amount of fruit seemed just right. There's just something about butter, warm fruit and maple syrup...Used a 1 lb loaf of "Cinnabon" brand bread. If you make this, you will forever be regarded as the world's best cook... And it is so EZ!!!

I was very dissapointed. I had high hopes for this Strata.  I love the idea that you can prepare this beforehand.  But the taste was bland (even though I added cinnamon to coat the apples).  The texture was very mushy.  THe raisins ended up tasting odd and the cream cheese didn't do anything.  Too bad...it really sounded good.

YUM, was great.  I spread cream cheese on bread, then cut into cubes.  Used 6 eggs, 2 apples, extra raisins and about 1.5 cup half and half, also added cinnamon and vanilla extract to the egg mixture.  Took it to work and it was devoured!

This was very easy and very yummy, I always follow the recipe exactly the first time I make something new and this turned out very good. Even better heated up the next day. Next time I want to try some of the advise from other's on adding sugar, cinnamon and vanilla, that sounded good too.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for a family brunch and everyone loved it! I made a few changes based on other reviewers suggestions. I used Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon bread and spread the cream cheese on each slice before cutting up the bread. I reduced the eggs to 6, the half and half to 2 cups, added a dash of nutmeg, tsp vanilla, little extra cinnamon, and baked at 350 for 50 minutes. It turned out wonderful!

My kids loved this. To make it more heart healthy I used 1 1/2 cups lowfat milk and 1 cup fat-free half and half. I am not a huge cream cheese fan so I cut the amount of cream cheese in half. Took the advise of other reviews and cut the eggs down to 6. Definitely worth making again. Very easy for kids to help too.

I made this today for brunch and it was wonderful.  Although I did make some changes to make it a little lower in the fat area.  I only used 7 eggs and 1 1/2 cups of milk instead of half and half.  Like others, I also softened the cream cheese and spread it on the bread, using only 6 oz. of light cream cheese,   2 cups of apples through in some raisins and sprinkled the top with cinnamon and sugar.  It was absolutely fabulous. Will definitely be a family favorite.

Very easy to make, very rich.  I substituted low-fat cream cheese, and whole milk just to make myself feel better for fat content and it was still great. The kids were a little reluctant because of the appearance, but after some coaxing enjoyed it.

Every Fall a group of women from ages 30+ to 60+ go away to the White 
Mountains of New Hampshire for a weekend away.  A couple are married, a
few divorced and one never married.  The number varies from 8 - 10.  This
year there 8 of us, 2 of us were in charge of Sunday breakfast and I tried this
 recipe for the first time.  It was wonderful!  Everyone loved it.  I definately will
use it again.

Maybe its personal taste, but I didn't care for it at all. I don't like the soggy bread texture and like others said, it didn't end up having any flavor. The apples were the only good part.
This is the first time for me that a high rated recipe on allrecipes.com didn't turn out delicious. What a disappointment :(

I made this for a holiday brunch and it was a big hit.  If I make it again, I will follow the suggestion of whipping the cream cheese, as I found the chunks of it a little unappealing.  I also would add additional raisins and dried cranberries.

I over cooked a apple cake that came out dry, I did not want to waste it as the flavor was real good. I made this strada with the cake instead of bread and since it was already frosted with cream cheese frosting I did not have to add that either. Came out AWESOME..... Mix it up with what you have on hand. Leftover banana bread would be good, going to try that next.

I made this for Mother's Day brunch and it was a big hit with everyone! After reading previous comments, I altered the recipe slightly, but think we would have enjoyed it if I had made it just as directed. I sliced the apples instead of dicing, using 2 cups instead of 1; I added raisins to the middle layers and the top and sprinkled brown sugar on top of the apples. I also served it with homemade syrup. Delicious!

Good recipe, however I found that cooking time should be increased by about 30 mins otherwise the strata comes out soggy and make sure the caserole pan is NOT covered - it needs to breath as it cooks... A couple of changes I made was:  substituted Store brand cinnamon-Raisin bagels instead of the raisin bread - the texture holds together better, added about a tablespoon of cinnamon and a cup of raisins to the middle layer. Enjoy

This was a hit for the family on New Years Day.  We had a group of ten and it fed them all. I wish I would have followed the advice of several other writers and added additional raisins. I substituted Tofutti for the cream cheese and used unsweetened almond milk instead of the half-and-half cream. We have a couple of boys that can't have milk protein.

Excellent recipe just the way it is.  Don't even need additional syrup on it.

I made this for our church brunch and it was a total hit!  I took some of the previous reviewers suggestions and added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.  Instead of spreading the cream cheese on the bread, I whipped the cream cheese with vanilla then added the egg and half & half.  I completely forgot to add the butter, but it didn't really need it.  My hubby and picky kids loved it!  Will definitely make this again.

A few changes:  6 eggs, 2 cups whole milk, honey instead of maple syrup.  Turned out firm and not runny.  Very tasty.

My family and I enjoyed the original recipe, but I like to add the extra raisins as well as a sprinkling of nutmeg, allspice, ground cloves, and extra cinnamon, and I am generous with the apple. I think it works best with a good quality bread that isn't too sugary.

Delicious. Since I only have a 5/13 inch baking dish and I used the quantities given, I made two and only had enough apple for one of them. I wonder had I made just one dish, would the apple be enough? I melted the cream cheese and mixed it up with the other ingredients, instead of putting it in in dollops. I also increased the cooking time as per a reviewer's advice, but it came out a bit overcooked, so the 45 min in the oven should be enough.

Was good, but a bit bland.  Will try it again with cinnamon swirl bread and fewer raisins but add pecans on top.  Might try adding a splash of rum and serve it for dessert.  Great potential!

Ok so i didn't have any cinnamon raisin bread so i used some of my wheat bread that was a few days old. It wasn't as sweet as if I would have used the suggested bread so I know if i did it would be fantastic. I added some dried orange cranberries in place of the raisins. I sprinkled some powdered sugar over the top to up the sweetness to what it would be if I used the cinnamon bread. I will definitely make this again.

This is a really yummy recipe, I made it almost to the tee of the recipe. Instead of dicing the cream cheese I did slabs and tried to cover as much area as possible. My suggestion for the cream cheese is to freeze it so that it is firm before cutting and then dice it for a more even spread. It doesn't have to be frozen solid but just enough to make it easier to manage and use a very sharp knife. I sprinkled brown sugar, cinnamon and about 1 1/2 oz. of raisins on the apples, then a little more brown sugar on top on the last layer of bread. After 45 mins of baking I popped under  the broiler for a couple mins (watch closely!) to crisp up the top and dry out a bit more as it was still a tad too wet. Delicioso!

This is an amazing recipe. Just needs a few extra spices for my taste, so I add at least 1/4 tsp nutmeg , 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, to taste. (mix it in with the eggs, cream, butter, etc.) I also like the idea of spreading the cream cheese on the bread before cutting it up so the cr. cheese isn't so globby. Anyone would love this for a brunch/breakfast recipe and it really isn't hard at all. YUM.

I made a variation of this last night for the kids' breakfast this morning.  At Costco, they carry a brand of English muffin call "Innkeepers", which are a vanilla/raisin/super yummy english muffin.  Anyway, I used 5 muffins, 3 pieces of Kirkland (Costco again) multigrain bread, only 4 T of the butter, and 3 oz of cream cheese.  I used an entire cameo apple, 1 can of non-fat canned milk, then for the rest of the "Cream" I used fat-free milk.  I baked it for about 50 minutes, rested it for 10, and the kids loved it!  Anyway, my 17-year-old daughter said, "This tastes like Christmas morning!"  It was delicious!

Sorry to be the odd one out, here, but I didn't like this. The cream cheese made me nervous, and I should have followed my instincts. I followed all of the tips (including spreading the cream cheese by hand), and I usually do like casseroles, but not this one.

I made this with a few of the suggested changes and my guys ate it up!  I spread the bread with soft cream cheese before cubing, eliminated the extra raisins, and added sugar and cinnamon on top.  It soaked in the fridge overnight.  I baked it at 350 degrees for 45 minutes and it puffed up and browned beautifully.  I think I'll use 6 eggs instead of 8 next time though because it seemed a little eggy to me but still so good!  Definitely a keeper.

I have made this twice and it is excellent. I have always made it the morning I was baking it, never refrigerating it for any length of time.It has still come out wonderfully. The only things I do differently are to : bake it longer and sprinkle the top with cinnamon sugar. I dont melt the cream like some other reviewers and I still thought it was great. Definitely "company worthy!"

This tastes wonderful! I made it for a baby shower and everyone loved it. It tastes real good with maple syrup, but it really has the taste and texture of a bread pudding. If you want a french toast texture, this is not it. But, don't let that stop you from making this, because it really is yummy.

Did some tweaking after reading several reviews and it was a big hit at my women's group. First of all, I just laid the slices in the pan.
I reduced the half-and-half to 2 cups and left rest of egg mixture the same. I poured half of this egg mixture over the bottom layer of bread. I used 8 oz of whipped cream cheese mixed with 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 c sugar. I spread this evenly over the bread. I then added the apple layer (I used pie filling). I added another layer of bread and poured the remaing egg mixture over it. I let it sit overnight in fridge and then baked it in the morning @ 350 for 55-60 min. The bread turned out the perfect texture of french toast with a creamy center.

Smelled great and looks beautiful.  However, I followed the recipe to a "T" except that I baked it, uncovered, for over an hour at 350 degrees to try to and dry it out a bit.  Consistency was mushy/slimy, flavor was very bland.  Hard to believe that something that smelled this good was so devoid of flavor. I would not make again -- would need too many alterations to rescue this recipe.  Something this unhealthy (fat, carbs, cholesterol, calories) should  be far more delicious to be worth the nutritional sacrifice.

I was not as impressed with this recipe as I thought I would be.  I'm not sure why, but I was expecting something a little more spectacular.  I will probably make it again, but in the future I think I'll try cutting off the crusts of the bread before cubing it to keep the consistency a little more "constant" throughout.

Just made it really amazing! I followed the directions as it...added a little more raisins just because they are so yummy! I baked for an hour to avoid any chance of sogginess... Turned out great! I will make again without a doubt.

I was quite hopeful when I saw this recipe--it sounds delicious. Unfortunately, it is tasteless and mushy. I do not usually review/rate recipes but this one is just that bad. I do NOT recommend it.

We LOVE this. I serve it when I have overnight guests and haven't found one person who doesn't like it. I've had a gastric bypass and to bump up the protein content, I have added 2 eggs. I may try to add a 3rd next time. We like it better with the extra eggs. I also use the lower fat cream cheese. Since I don't like raisins, I use Cinnabon cinnamon bread. Oh and this freezes great. If it's just my husband and I, I would have to throw it out before we could finish it. I just cut it into individual pieces and feeze it in separate containers. The other thing i do is put apples on 12 and on the other have, at a friend's suggestion, I use frozen wild blueberries. I get these at Trader Joes or Albertsons.

I'll admit up front that I don't follow this recipe very exactly, but it's so adaptable, I'm giving it 5 stars for sheer flexibility.  First, I always use whole grains in my cooking, so I use plain whole wheat bread, which I leave in whole slices and spread with honey nut cream cheese, placing half the slices on the bottom of the dish and half on top of the apple layer.  Then I add raisins with the apples, sprinkling cinnamon and brown sugar on them.  I use plain old skim milk and skip the melted butter, just using enough butter to grease the baking dish.  Because I don't measure exactly and sometimes adjust the amount of eggs, milk, and bread according to the number of people I'm serving, I get slightly different results all the time, but it's ALWAYS extremely tasty.  So glad I could add this dish to my breakfast rotation!

Made this for my Sunday School Class. It was super simple and great to make the night before. I cubed the cinnamon bread on the bottom, but placed the slices on top, overlapping just slightly. Then sprinkled with powdered sugar, and served with warm maple syrup. Made a nice presentation. I got rave reviews.

Made this recipe for a sunday brunch with friends and everyone enjoyed it.   I didn't have the right size pan, so I had to improvise and I misread the recipe and put in twice the amount of butter the recipe asked for, but it was still delicious.  I also added vanilla and cinnamon even though the recipe didn't include that. I loved that you can make the recipe the day before and then pop it in the oven the morning you need it. In the future I might use less cream cheese and more apples.   I would also suggest using really good bread. definitely would recommend it to anyone.

This recipe was incredible. For my taste I would have liked it a little sweeter, so next time I would add about a 1/4 cup of cinnamon sugar in addition to the maple syrup. Two other notes. Chop the apples about a 1/4 of an inch or they will not cook enough. I also might melt the cream cheese and pour it over as it was a little clumpy in spots.

Very good! You may wish to try it as is first, but I make it with a few modifications. In order to cut back on the fat and up the maple flavor (I also didn't want it to be too soggy) I use only 6oz of low-fat cream cheese, 2 large granny smith apples, only 6 eggs, 1 1/2 cups skim milk instead of half n' half, and a 1/3 cup real maple syrup. It's wonderful for special occasions.

This is a keeper!  I used evaporated milk instead of half and half.  It is essential to let dish rest 10 min. before serving; otherwise, you get mush. I also added more apple.

I guess it is kind of redundant after all the other rave reviews, but, YUMMY!!
I have tried a couple of other "night before" french toast recipes, and while they have been good, I've found them to be too sweet, syrupy, sugary, etc.  This one was just right.  I loved getting a chunk of cream cheese and apple in a bite. This will be a regular when we have overnight guests.

Was just alright.  Cream cheese didn't melt so there were these chunks throughout.  Decent but probably will not make again.

This is great, a real crowd pleaser.  I followed some of the suggestions, combined them to my taste.  Added apple pie filling with some fresh apples, added extra raisins, melted the cream cheese, stirring into the first half bread cubes.  Topped with extra cinnamon and sugar, baked for 1 hour.  It was wonderful with lots of compliments and asking for recipe.
Thanks for sharing!

Like others, I got much better results from melting the cream cheese and tossing the cubed bread with it, instead of cubing the cream cheese.

Loved this!  So did the rest of my family on Christmas morning.  As recommended, I used light cream cheese...melted, and cooked it on 350 for a little longer.  I also used two cups of apple instead of one.

This recipe is WONDERFUL! I made it for a holiday brunch and everyone raved about it. I made a few small substitutions to decrease the fat and calories ... I used half eggs/half egg beaters, fat free half and half, and low fat cream cheese and it still was rich and delicious. I'll definitely make this one again.

Wonderful outcome with this recipe.  The second time I made it, I spread the softened cream cheese on the bread and then sliced into cubes.  I used less cream cheese and got a better result than the first time.  Delicious!

Great recipe when you are looking for no work in the a.m. with guests coming. I prepared it the night before-used a granny smith apple and melted the cream cheese to toss with the bottom layer of bread as suggested. It really worked no lumps just a nice flavor. I did sprinkle the apples with brown sugar and nutmeg and covered with aluminum foil the last 15 minutes. Served with warm maple syrup. Guests loved it.

FABULOUS!  Served this at my Easter brunch with maple syrup and orange blossom honey. I put the cream cheese in the freezer until very firm and cut it into tiny dice before sprinkling it over the first layer of bread.   Not a bite was left!

This recipe was good.  However I think next time I will keep the raisin cinnamon bread whole so that the cream cheese is easier to spread.

I really liked this recipe and it was VERY easy to prepare.  It was rich and custardy and smelled great in the oven.  I used Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Raisin Bread and then I added some gourmet apple bread (very dense) which was a mistake.  Stick with the Pepperidge Farm bread only.  It has the right amount of cinnamon, but could use a few more raisins for my liking.  Served with real maple syrup warmed in the microwave.  Next time, I might make a blueberry syrup as well.  This is a great and different make ahead for a brunch or late-night treat!

I used 6 eggs instead of 8 and baked it for an hour. I added a lot of cinnamon, freshly grated nutmeg and cloves and it still was pretty bland.Didn't like it at all.

I can't believe how soggy it was! I wish people would just print out the recipe after all of the adjustments are made. Very costly to make and then for it not to turn out is very upsetting. And to top it off this one was in the magazine.

The recipe turned out really good! My mother-in-law and I made it for Christmas morning. It tasted fantastic! I feel that replacing the apples with another fruit would go really well too, like for example: blueberries, strawberries, pears even? Wonderful recipe.

I followed the directions, it was tasty, but I was not pleased with the texture or the appearance.  I would not serve this to guests.  I did spread each slice of bread with the cream cheese, but it showed up on the plate as small curdled looking lumps.  It has a custard texture, which is fine if that's what your wanting.

I fixed this for Easter brunch, and it was delicious! My wife said it was like bread pudding, which is her favorite dessert. Like most others, I made some changes which worked well for me. I spread the cream cheese on each slice of bread before cubing and extra cinnamon as well as some freshly ground nutmeg. I also used only two cups of Half-and-half and 6 eggs which was enough for the 11" X 14" pan I used.When I make it next time, I'll toast the bread lightly to make spreading the cream cheese and cubing easier and will double the diced apples.

I made this dish today for Easter brunch. It was tasty; however, it was very rich. Next time, I would cut back on the creamed cheese and maybe use half milk and half "Half and Half. I think I would also add some chopped ham to it.

Yummy!  I made 1/2 the recipe in a 8x8 pan.  I put 4 whole slices of bread on the bottom, covered it with apples and raisins, put 4 more slices on top.  Poured the wet ingredients on top and let it soak in for 1 hour (that's all the time I had). Before baking I added sugar and cinnamon and then baked it.  Thanks to all the readers suggestions, this came out perfect and delicious!

Bland and flat tasting. I think maning french toast with raisin brand and adding toppings would be easier and quicker. Waste of time IMHO.

Very bland.  Made it for Easter breakfast and no one really liked it.  It lacked flavor.  Perhaps more cinnamon or some vanilla or soemthing would have helped, but had alot left over because no one really liked it.

Cut the entire recipe by 75% and made it in a 7 x 11 dish.  Used Cinnamon Swirl w/out raisins, honey instead of maple syrup.  Refrigerated for about 12 hours.  Everyone loved it, second helpings all around!

So yummy! I used cinnamon bread (not a huge fan of raisins) and also mixed cream cheese with brown sugar and cinnamon before dolloping on 1st layer of bread. My kids and hubby loved this even more the next day!

I have to say that I wasn't overwhelmed with this recipe when made as stated.  It seemed mushy/gritty because of the cream cheese.  I also tried reducing the amount and/or making it with the cream cheese spread on the toast before cutting and had the same results, and also tried reducing the # of eggs to 6.  It tasted better cold than warm, as well.  If I were to make it yet another time, I would for sure eliminate the cream cheese to see if it helped the strange texture.

I made this for a breakfast at work. It was a HUGE hit. The only changes I made were I added another half pound loaf of the bread and substituted 1 cup of  whole milk. I also found it needed to bake longer than indicated, so give your self some wiggle time.

I LOVE this recipe, thank you! I made it Christmas morning & I think I'll make it every Christmas morning. I followed some other advice & whipped the cream cheese w/ 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon   then spread on bread to avoid clumps. I also added vanilla to the eggs & used slightly more maple syrup. YUM!!! It was a hit!

Made this for Christmas breakfast.  It was so easy to make the day before and put it in the oven this morning while the kids opened thier gifts.  Everyone loved it! I spread the cream cheese as per other reviews. I used 2% milk and 6 eggs, extra apples and I mixed the apples with bread.

Great recipe! I usually make it the night before and just pop it in the oven while I'm getting ready. I like to spread the cream and cheese on the bread then cut up the bread slices in cubes ( that means I end up using less than 8 oz). Also I used less butter.

I took other's suggestions and reduced eggs to 6, added some vanilla to eggs, added brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla to the cream cheese and spread it on the slices of bread prior to cubing them and upped the oven temp to 350. My oven thermometer confirmed the temp of the oven so I know that was OK but even after 90 MINUTES in the oven this was just a soggy mush in the middle with the substance of tapioca. I can not imagine what it would have been like if I had used 8 eggs! I finally took it out and microwaved individual servings to get it to set up better. It was edible. After sitting for the 1/2 hour that we ate it set up a little more but not much. This got a unanimous 2-thumbs down from me, my husband, daughter, mother and 2-year old granddaughter who usually eats anything. I will definitely NOT be making this again. I would like to know how this ever came to look like the picture as I made it as listed but with LESS liquid! No way would I have gotten a "slice" out as pictured above. If I could have rated 0 stars I would have but we'll say that the 1 star is for the fact that it smells divine while baking.

The kids loved it.  I used brown sugar-cinnamon flavored whipped cream cheese, rather than the lumps of cream cheese.  It was easy to make, and it disappeared very quickly!  We ate it before we went to church, and they came back and ate the rest when we got home... and they aren't usually good with leftovers!

Yummy.    Changes taken from other reviews:  - spread cream cheese on bread before cubing  - use apple pie filling  - use evaporated milk instead of cream  - Bake at 350 for 1 hour.

I'm not sure how to rate this recipe.  I followed all directions exactly... except I put the oven at 350.  Even at 350 I baked this for 1 hour 20 minutes and it still was not done.  Everyone had a piece (just my husband, 3 kids, and me) and all said it was good.  The second half of it is now back in the oven to see if it will firm up a bit.  So..... flavor is good, cook time is inaccurate.

I made this for our Christmas breakfast & everyone loved it!  I did only use 6 eggs as suggested by others, but everything else I kept the same. In the future I may add a bit more apples. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Mixed reviews at our house. I really liked it, tho it needed to cook longer than the recipe says (more like an hour.) My husband and daughter thought it was too goopy in the middle and didn't like the cream cheese in it. I may try to make it again without the cream cheese and cooked much longer to dry out the middle.

We were supposed to have company and so I chose this recipe to make for for Sunday Brunch. The company could not come as snow made the roads impassable and so it was just us 4.  My son and I did not like it, my hubby and daughter like it a lot. I am not into sweet breakfasts and my son does not like the textures of stratas, quiches etc. My husband thinks it should be a keeper recipe.  The recipe was easy to follow, I added cinnamon and vanilla to the cream cheese mix and whisked it soft and tossed the bread cubes in it. I bought a loaf or raisin/cinnamon bread a couple days early so the texture was a little denser and not so soft, worked well.   It made so much that after 3 days I had to throw out 1/2 of the pan since no one wanted to eat any more.   It would probably ok if you had a large crowd for Brunch and served something hearty as well for all the people who are not into sweet breakfast foods.

I used 2 apples diced with skin on.  I used extra raisins.  i tried spreading the cream cheese on the bread but it was better with chunks of cream cheese.

Wow!  Made this for brunch on Sunday.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone loved it.  Kind of a cross between strata & bread pudding.  Served it with maple syrup & sausage links.  Might try crumbling the sausage after browning & adding to the strata next time.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Will definately make again.

Great dish! I took this to a "Dining Divas" brunch (a picky bunch) and everyone asked for the recipe. I may omit the cream cheese the next time. Very easy!

This was very good. I also beat the cream cheese with powdered sugar, and vanilla, then spread on bread. I think that was probably better than chunks of cream cheese throughout. 
It made a nice start to our Christmas morn,. 2008. 
Thanks!

this is ok.  it is a little bland for my taste & I don't care for the soggy bread.  I did follow the other reviewers advice & changed temp to 350.  Baked for about 65 minutes.  Spread the cream cheese on the trader joes cinnamon bread before I cut it up.  Used apple pie filling (thought it would add more flavor).  Used 7 eggs- but only 3 yolks.  Used low-fat half & half.

Excellent dish!  We really enjoyed this as I tend to stick to eggs and hot cereals for breakfast.  It has inspired me to try more breakfast casserole type recipes.  I made a few changes; used only 5 eggs, 2 apples, whole milk, a few sprinkles of cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla to the egg mixture. I also spread the cream cheese to whole slices of pepperidge farms cinnamon bread minus the crust- didnt' cube them.  I have tried different breads and found this to be my family's favorite.  My 3 year old loves this "breakfast toast".   I look forward to making it for my MIL and her brother when they visit next month.  Easy to prepare the night before and cook while in the shower.

My husband and I were helping friends of our re roof our house and I made this for breakfast---talk about a total hit! There wasn't so much as a crumb left!! I made the cinnamon cream syrup to go along with this---really really good and very easy to double the recipe to have enough to go around!

This was such a disappointment, and I had high expectations.  Way too much cream cheese, not enough apple. I am sure you could improve it by changing the recipe around, but the recipe as written isn't very good.

This is sinfully rich and so easy to make. It is wonderful to make up the night before and bake in the morning. I have made this for more than one brunch gathering. I take along the extra syrup heated for topping.

I got rave reviews...I also used sugar free maple syrup and couldn't tell the difference. I froze the left overs that I sliced.  Three weeks later we finished it off.  Just as good as the first time.

I added some raisins, a little brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg, but the best substitution was fat free buttermilk for the half and half.  It tasted so good with a lot less fat.

I really messed up this recipe.  First I put it in the wrong pan, then I forgot the butter.  It turned out soggy and we had to cook it for a long time extra.  But it tasted good anyway.       I'll try it again though.

This is one of our favorites.  I add 1/2# browned bulk sausage and use cinnamon bread w/o raisins.  I also use regular syrup.  This is a delicious meal that doesn't need anything else served with it.

Very easy--and feeds many! I skipped the raisins--hubby doesn't like them, but I think they would add nice flavor. I also used a loaf of italian bread--I made this on a whim one day and didn't have time to get to the store!

Great brunch recipe!  I sprinkled cinnamon over the apples and added extra raisins.  Served with warm maple syrup and bacon or sausage, it's a wonderful way to start the day.  I love the fact that it's assembled ahead of time and refrigerated overnight, so there's no last-minute fussing or mess.  This is a keeper recipe!

I made this for company, mixed in the cream cheese as recommended, and used only 6 eggs. It came out more mushy and less like the french toast consistency I thought it would be--and I cooked it for longer than the recommended time. Everyone thought it was just ok; I think the consistency is what turned them off.

We loved this. I assembled it the night before, and even after all that fridge time, the directions for baking it in the morning were perfect. It came out wonderfully.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I added extra apples and raisins and it was delicious. I used light cream cheese which was fine (but next time I'll cut it into smaller pieces & spread it out more). I will definitely make this again! yum! thanks

I made this for a New Year's Day brunch, and everyone loved it.  I had to cook it way longer than the recipe said, but other than that it was great.  I served it with maple syrup on the side.  I had several requests for the recipe.

I took the basic recipe and some of the excellent suggestions from other reviewers.  I used a loaf of Trader Joe's cinnamon raisin bread, spread slices with whipped cream cheese before cubing.  I used 6 eggs, added a tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla to the custard.  I used 3 apples and a cup of raisins distributed throughout the casserole.  350 degrees for one hour.  Very popular!  I'll make this again.

Very filling.  We use whatever fruit is on hand and sometimes use craisins or currants instead of raisins.  I usually use plain whole-wheat bread and add my own spices (cardamom, nutmeg, cloves, etc.)

This is a fancy good old bread & butter pudding.  I can't buy raisin bread so I used ordinary bread and I had raisins macerating in cognac.  It was absolutely delicious  The only thing was that the apple slices remained firm, so the next time I will cook them in the butter first.  Also. for me, this is a dessert. and I certainly would not like it for breakfast.  Yuk! Yuk!

I made this last year as per the recipe. It was delicious except I didn't care for the globs of cream cheese. I am making it this year without the cream cheese. Will let you know how it came out.

DELICIOUS. Used about half the cream cheese and spread it on each slice as other did. Used sunmaid raisin bread and two less eggs and fat free half and half which as someone else said went undetected.I think this could easily use half the amount of butter. Might also try this without cream cheese someday... Not sure it adds anything. Two Honeycrisp apples worked great!

I didn't have raisin bread so I used 12 slices of white bread and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on it.  I also didn't have raisins on hand so I added half a cup of dried cranberries.  Layered the cream cheese, mine had been frozen so it was kind of just crumbly.  Added three apples chopped and another hand full of cranberries on top.  Then the rest of the bread and another sprinkle of cinnamon sugar mixture.  To the egg mixture I used whole milk as that is what I had on hand, real maple syrup and I added a drop of butter flavoring and a drop of vanilla and another couple table spoons of the cinnamon sugar mixture.  My guys told me that it won't keep so they are having thirds.  I think will keep fine but they really like it!  The tart of the cranberries and apples goes great with the sweetness of this dish.  Yum!

This was demolished! I do have a hint for those who thought parts of it stayed too dry. Instead of layering the bread in the pan then pouring the custard over it, mix up the custard in a very large bowl, then pour your cubed bread into that and mix well. THEN, put a layer in the pan, put on your fruits and then add the rest of the bread and pour over any leftover custard. If you let it soak for a minute in the custard and stir it up well, it makes it nice and evenly moist.

I also used fat free half and half and added about an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and half a teaspoon of nutmeg since along with about a teaspoon of vanilla extract since I use that on my french toast normally. 1 granny smith apple and an extra large handful of golden raisins make it perfect. Cube your very cold cream cheese into tiny bits so every bite has a little but doesn't overtake the bite.  Good stuff! I think this will go into our weekend guest rotation since it's so easy to put together the night before. Next time, I think I will use egg beaters and light cream cheese to reduce the calorie count but not the flavor. Use real maple syrup and you won't be sorry!

I had not made this in a very long time and want to kick myself for not making it more often. I thought there would be lots leftover as there weren't too many of us at today's gathering, but every last piece was gone.  The chunks of cream cheese is what makes it so good, don't reduce, don't melt or spread it.  I did reduce the eggs to 6 and will add another 1/2 cup of apples next time.  So easy and so yummy.  Thank you, Terrie!

I used french bread (and a couple of sprouted wheat hot dog buns!) torn into small pieces and stirred with a softened cream cheese/brown sugar/cinnamon mixture. Added that to the pan and topped with 3 med. apples, also mixed with a little brown sugar and cinnamon, and chopped very fine. I didn't bother to peel the apples, and I didn't add any raisins. Added the other 1/2 of bread on top and poured the egg/milk combo over. I used 6 eggs and 1 1/4c heavy whipping cream and 1 1/4c. whole milk and 2TBS of the maple syrup. Baked @ 350 for 45 min, with foil on the first 15 min. We drizzled with a little more maple syrup before eating. The closer it is to room temperature the more delicious it is!

Very good. Not soggy at all. I did 6 eggs, added vanilla to the egg mixture. I also creamed the cheese with some sugar and cinnamon per other reviews and spread this on the bread before cubing it. I baked it at 350 for an hour and it was perfect! Wonderful xmas morning breakfast, I made it yesterday and it sat in the fridge for over 16 hours before I baked it this morning.

This stuff is pretty darn amazing.   I did use milk instead of half-and-half because I really wanted to make this and didn't have any.  It worked out well anyhow.  Unfortuately I am the only true apple raisin fan in the house, so I have been eating most of this by myself.  Luckily, it keeps well in the fridge, so I can just heat a little up and eat.  Great recipe!

I thought this was good, but it wasn't a big hit with the family.  You really have to top it with a lot of syrup.  I also added dried cranberries, which were really good.

Very flavorful. I had a little issue with texture. We refridgerated for 24 hours. It still had a "soggy" feel. I will definintely make again, but I will cut back on liquid. Apples were a GREAT touch. I did use chunky cinnamon bread from Cub Foods since I don't like raisins.

This was great and easy.  My guests were very impressed.  And I was thrilled b/c it only took me about 20 min to make.  I also spread the cream cheese on the bread rather than putting in chunks and cut back on the butter (I think I did half, 3 TBSP).

I wasn't that impressed with this.  It was good, but just not very flavorful.  I cut the recipe in half and then still only used 3 eggs.  It wasn't soggy or dry - just perfect there.  But it was bland.

Had this for Christmas.  Thanks Terrie!  My family really enjoyed the fact that it wasn't too sweet.   Those of us with a sweet tooth could add syrup if we wanted.  Like others, I also spread the cream cheese  on the bottom layer of bread.  I also used two apples.  Yum!

My  daughter said "muy bien"!  Used Pepp. Farm whole wheat raisin bread and threw in a handful of extra raisins, and a few more apples (the one apple I used was HUGE).  Only used six eggs and think I would go with the full amt next time...did not get done in time allotted even at 350.   Also, I only used 1/2 pkg. cream chesse which was plenty.  Would probably make again.

i made this recipe as stated and it was good but it needs more cooking time. It was soggy and definately underdone when i served it. After putting it back in the oven for about 20 min., it was much better. I would add cinnamon next time for more flavor. Kind of reminds me of the bread pudding my mother made when i was a kid.

This was delicious! I took another reviewer's advice and spread the cinnamon bread with cream cheese before cubing. You couldn't really taste it. Next time, I'll skip this step. I also changed the cook temp to 350, but it still took 40min.

I crave this dish all the time.  I would say that you probably don't have to use a whole entire package of cream cheese (and I love cream cheese).  Topped with syrup, this dish is mouth watering

This recipe was a great starter for me, but changes will have to be made for it to be tasty. Frankly liberal doses of syrup poured over it are the only thing that saved it at my house, and we aren't sweet eaters :/  I'm going to put the apples in the same mix as I make when making an apple pie and see what happens. At least it will have more taste.   Great idea, but way to bland for me.

I used 4 cinnamon raisin bagels for the bread, and it turned out very well.  I did reduce the eggs to 6 and baked it at 340 for about 50 minutes.  The kids liked it, and my husband says its a keeper.

I baked it at 350 for 1.5hrs and it was really mushy in the middle.  I didn't expect that texture, I thought it would be a little less mushy and more creamy thinking with the cream cheese melting through the bake.

The cream cheese didn't melt at all.... I expected that it would but any dish I've ever used cream cheese in was on stove top.

It tasted delcious the texture was not good for me BUT maybe I did something wrong.

It turned out pretty good. My coworkers loved it. I personally would add more raisins and cook a little bit longer than instructed. Other than that turned out pretty good.

Gosh so frustrating.  I'm blending two recipes in my mind.  Well, I recall that the cream cheese is better in chunks than spread on the bread.

Loved this breakfast!  I actually used about 3/4 of a loaf of Berlin Bakery (R) Righeous Raisin bread because it's spelt bread and I'm allergic to wheat.  It was still absolutely amazing!  Another small change I did was instead of cubing the cream cheese, I sort of sliced it in order to make it layer the whole dish.  Last change was that I used whipping cream instead of half and half.  I would recommend this recipe highly to anyone.  It's delicious!

this was really good.  i made a few changes:  used a bunch of stale homemade bread cubes, some super dry; used half the cream cheese in cubes, 6 eggs, baked in a smaller glass baking dish, about 1 1/2 cups milk and whipping cream mixed, 2 tbsp. butter, forgot the maple syrup completely.  amazingly, it turned out really good and the whole family loved it.  some recipes are just immune to tinkering, this must be one.

This was wonderful. I wanted to use up my sweet potatoe biscuits I had in frezer so I used them instead of bread. I followed other reviewers and spread cream cheese on biscuits before cutting, used two apples and some raisins. I sprinkled some cinnamon straight on apples and that was enough of spices for me since my biscuits had already cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger in them. I did not have half and half so I used 1 cup of heavy cream (all I had) and rest just 2% milk. It worked out so delicious and looked fabulous with powdered sugar sprinkled on top. I cant wait to try it with blueberries or strawberries when thet are in season.

I made this recipe for a New Years Day brunch for 35 people.  It vanished.  Nice because it can be all done ahead of time.  I made it the day before and let it sit in a cold garage.  I also made it with gluten free bread which worked just fine.  I think I would add some extra cinnamon and raisins next time.

I followed this recipe as written, except for adding a tsp of vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg.  I thought the flavor was wonderful!  Having made it once, next time I will bake it at 350 degrees.

It was yummy and a nice treat for breakfast.
I used 6 eggs and decreased the milk to a cup and a half but the bread was still soggy. I evenly lightly toasted the bread so that wouldn't happen!

Sorry to say, I just didn't like this. It came out mushy, even though I baked at a higher temp. To be fair, I followed some of the other reviewers' healthy substitutions, so that could have been part of it too. I'm not going to try this one again.

Very good,  I made it in the slow cooker, instead of letting it sit over night(cooked it on low for 4hrs).  I think that next time I want to try cranberry instead of rasins, and make glaze to have with it.

This meal is such a hit, and it makes the 'morning of' so simple.  It's an easy way to feed a lot of people.  I personally like more apples, and you don't need quite as much cream cheese as it calls for.  But however you do it, it will be delicious!

OK - I made for Christmas brunch - I think I will continue to stick to what I usually make - egg type dishes.  I did decrease the cream by 1/2 cup and reduced one egg to elimnate the "soggy" effect - it worked and I added extra apples which was a great suggestion.  It was good but not AWSOME.

What a lovely breakfast casserole.  I skipped the raisins all together and used apple streusel bread.  I also added 2 less eggs, in order to avoid a soggy consistency.  Sprinkling cinnamon on the apples is a must!

I made this as one of the dishes for our Christmas morning brunch, and it was a big hit. I forgot about melting the cream cheese, as others have suggested, but it still turned out great. I just dropped small dollops of the cream cheese over the bread. Also, instead of using a fresh apple, I had a bag of Schwann's roasted apples in the freezer, and I took a cup of apples out of there, and chopped them up before adding ......... because the apples are already spiced, I think that added a lot of flavor. Using low fat cream cheese and fat-free half/half did not hurt the flavor of this recipe at all. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

Great dish, especially since it can be made the night before.  It's just as good without raisins, if you don't like them.

Overall, I liked this recipe, but the cream cheese cubes were too much.  Next time, will melt the cream cheese as suggested in other reviews of this recipe.  I also think I would use less cream cheese and more apples and raisins.  I look forward to trying this one again.

This is very good.  I wasnt sure what to expect and I made this for company.  Everyone- kids and adults- loved this.  I followed the recipe to a 'T' and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before cooking, as one reviewer suggested.  Yummy!!  I may try it with some walnuts mixed in next time.  A keeper!!

A great recipe to serve for brunch.  My family loved it. I did add more raisons, and agree that the cream cheese could be cut smaller.  I photocopied the recipe and gave it to my guests to take home!

this was not much to talk about.  The cream cheese was in blobs, the dish seemed overcooked and there wasn't enough liquid.  It seemed like it should be looser.  Not going to be using this recipe again.

This was a fantastic recipe and the best part is that you just get up in the morning and breakfast is ready! I added the extra cinnamon and sugar on the top as someone suggested. Best served with extra maple syrup.

J made this for our Church's Fathers Day breakfast this morning. After reading reviews for this & other recipes I made changes. My modifications make a different casserole but I started with the basics from this one. J added 1 lb of cooked crumbled mild breakfast sausage (map!e flavored would also be good) but I used what I had in hand.  I also diced up enough Apple's to make 2 cups. Then I sprinkle a stevia & cinnamon sweetener mixture into the apples.  I also added a two teaspoons of nutmeg to them.  I used a half loaf of cinnamon bread & half loaf of French Toast bread. I spread the softened cream cheese on each slice of bread., Then cut the bread into cubes. Since my recipe was for 12 servings I used 2 disposable large lasagna pans (one inside the other to make it easier to move). Ok
!sprayed with non stick spray. I sprinkled half the sausage Collier by cubes bread then applies then sausage & the remaining bread. I used 10 eggs, 2 tspsn of vanilla, 2 cups of whole milk & 1 cup of heavy cream ( no half & half on hand), 1/2 cup reduced sugar flavored  syrup & 1 stick (8 tblsI ) unsalted butter ,melted. The butter was drizzled directly on the cubed bread. All other liquids were mixed in with the eggs. Then pour all over the cubes bread. Since I do not like soggy bread I only let this soak for 30 minutes before cooking at 350 for 1 hour. At about 40 minutes I covered pan with foil to keep top from over browning. Drizzle with 1/2 syrup when complete.

Excellent casserole.  The easiest way to add the cream cheese is to freeze the loaf first. No need to cut the bread either.  Keep slices whole and spread the cream cheese on half the loaf. Crumble the other half loaf for the top.

I found 2.5 cups of 1/2&1/2 was a little runny.  I would up the eggs to cream ratio next time.  I dusted the apples with a little cinnamon.  It turned out good after 15 more minutes at 375.

WishI had read the reviews before making it. It tasted great, but there was way too much liquid and I cooked it for an hour and a half. I will definitely cut the eggs to 6 , half the cream and cook at a higher temperature next go around.

I love this recipe and make it every Christmas for Breakfast.  As others have suggested I spread the cream cheese on the raisin bread before I cube it, so it's spread out more.  I use an extra apple and do full layer of apples in the middle.  
My only issue with this recipe is when adding melted butter I have had a few times where the other ingredients are so cold that the butter ends up reforming and floating in little globs.  I now let me butter cool down after melting and let the eggs warm up before mixing.

My husband was very skeptical about this recipe. He loved it! I swapped honey wheat bread for raisin bread and chunked the cream cheese. I would suggest serving with syrup. I served it for a brunch and made 1.5x the original amount.

I really liked this.  I took some suggestions and mixed the cream cheese with a tablespoon of sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon, then spread it on dense, quality cinnamon bread.  I used the full 8 eggs and fat free half and half.  I also added 1/2 tsp of rum flavoring and 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the egg mixture.  Next time I will try it with a tsp of maple flavor instead of the rum and vanilla, but I didn't have it this time.  I baked it at 350* for an hour and 15 minutes.  In hindsight I would probably only bake it for an hour.  I had plenty of apple so I doubled it and sprinkled a good dose of cinnamon sugar over the apples before adding the last layer of bread cubes. I then sprinkled the top with a bit more cinnamon sugar.  It was mildly sweet and went great with a bit of maple syrup on it.  I will definitely make this again.  My husband can't wait!

Absolutely terrific - added 1 tbsp sugar and about 1/2 tsp cinnamon over cream cheese.  & tsp of vanilla to eggs.  Baked at 350.   Cream cheese doesn't melt  quickly enough to be heated through.  Maybe I should have whipped it.  Instead, microed individual portions as I served it.   Adults & kids loved it.  Served with choices of  syrup & blueberries.

I made this for Easter Brunch, all the family loved it.  Easy to make the only thing I would change is I would cook the apples slightly before adding to the dish.  I served it with fresh strawberries, scrambled eggs, and sawsage.  It is on the sweet side but we like sweet??

I have made this several times and it is always a big  hit.  I prepare it the afternoon /evening before and then pop it in the oven the next morning.  I think the big key is to use REAL maple syrup.  I love this recipe.

I used 10 eggs, 1/2 loaf pepperidge farm cinnamon swirl bread and 1/2 loaf of challah. Maple syrup and heavy whipped cream definitely made the rounds at my table. This is a keeper

This recipe came out in the Allrecipes magazine several years ago and I have been making it ever since. I do make some alterations. I use cinnamon bread because I am not a fan of raisins. Also I spread my cream cheese mixture with some cinnamon on each piece of bread and then cut it into cubes. This helps to keep fro having globs of cream cheese. Then I follow the rest of the steps and it turns out great. One of my favorite breakfast casseroles.

Tastes good and pretty easy to make (I'd say extremely easy except for apple peeling/slicing), but be sure to use a large (and shallow) enough dish to bake this in. I used a casserole and when I took it out at the end of the cooking time it was still completely uncooked in the middle (raw egg hanging off the spoon when I scooped some out). I put it back in the oven covered for another hour and it still wasn't cooked enough in the middle. I ended up turning the oven off and letting it sit in there in its own heat until cooked and ate it for dinner instead of brunch. Kind of frustrating, but I guess it was my fault for not using a 9x13 pan.

tl;dr: Use a 9x13 (or larger) pan or else it will not cook properly in the time given.

I don't like raisins, so I used regular white bread. I added a tsp of cinnamon and cut the cream cheese into very small pieces. Came out fantastic. All stratas work best with slightly stale bread. Using "day old" bread soaks the egg mix in and does not end up as soggy.

It was okay but I was a little disappointed. I thought it would be sweeter. Maybe it's because I used green apples? The recipe didn't specify what apples to use. If I make this again, I'll probably experiment and tweak it a bit.

It is easier to spread the cream cheese onto the bread before cubing it - this avoids clumps.  I also sprinkled extra cinnamon onto the cream cheese as we love the taste.  I also used extra apples, thinly sliced to ensure the bread was covered with apples.  Awesome dish.

I followed the recipe exactly, with Granny Smith Apples. Delicious! Rich, soft, comforting. My sweet-tooth husband says that pouring maple syrup on top is "necessary," but I prefer it without. It has a very mild taste, which is not a bad thing. I didn't love the blobs of cream cheese (although some of you might!) so next time I'll either leave it out completely, incorporate it into the egg/cream mix, or spread it on the bread as another reviewer suggested. It would be easy to add sugar or cinnamon (or other spices) if you are so inclined. I am going to double the amount of apple next time because the apple flavor didn't really stand out as much as I hoped it would. Thanks for the recipe!

It was missing something. We added syrup to it after it was complete and it was a little better. It was okay but it's not something I would make again.

I have made it many times over the years. I freeze the whole  bread and slather the frozen slices with soft cream cheese or Neufchâtel cheese.  Not so messy and it tastes better.

This was really good and looked great. I served this for Easter brunch. Used Pepperidge Farm Brown Sugar/Cinnamon swirl bread and basically followed the directions. Cut the cream cheese into very small bite sized pieces, cut up two apples and added extra raisins. I let my strata soak for 16 hours. Next morning, bake for 45, and let it sit for 15. I will try the brown sugar/cinnamon topping the next time for a little sweetness.

We liked this but thought the cream cheese gave it an odd, not-quite-baked-through texture. Next I make it, instead of baking the cream cheese into the strata, I will make a glaze or icing out of it to use as a topping after it comes out of the oven.  With this change, I think it could be a 5-star recipe.

It was great, but I think it got better over time. The next morning after it was cooked and refrigerated I heated it up and it was perfect. The consistency was just right, not as runny as before. I'm going to try it with a few more eggs and add sausage and a mix of cheeses next time to give it a mix of sweet and salty.

i added more raisins and apples to it. i also spread the cream cheese on the bread first. it had a very good taste. all my boys loved it. i did wish i had cooked it a little longer though, as it was a little mushy.  stayed good for a few days as leftovers and good in the microwave.

We made this for Christmas breakfast this year; honestly I have had better french toast casseroles, so we will not repeat this.  We added an extra apple, added cinnamon and vanilla to the egg mixture, and spread the cream cheese onto the bread slices as other reviewers suggested.  We still didn't get a cinnamon taste, we missed a raisin presence, and the dish was very bland without a lot of syrup.  It was easy to prepare, but I know there are better recipes to use for overnight casseroles.

This was a great brunch meal for Christmas. I doubled the apple and added a bit of cinnamon. It got rave reviews and no one touched the maple syrup I had brought for a topping.

I followed some other reviewer's leads and used apple pie filling and it worked really well. I was a little worried about how it would taste since it looked kind of mushy but it really did taste like french toast! I was happily surprised. I think next time I may use smaller chunks of cream cheese or use others' suggestions of spreading it on the bread because while I liked the chunks and the taste of the cream cheese, after awhile it started to overpower the rest of the tastes in the dish. It's a keeper none the less. :)

This was so good thank you. I made this dish twice. Both times I used 7 eggs and one pint of half & half ( 2 cups). I also spinkled  cinammon on the apples. This french toast was a hit at Sunday school breakfast. I also made Breakfast Supreme from this site to go along with it.

i was expecting something much more spectacular considering all the great reviews.  i thought it was way too "eggy".  flavor wasn't good and very mushy.  i won't be making this again.

I made this for a brunch, it was delicious and filling.  I used light cream cheese, 2 % milk and 7 eggs, and granny smith apples.  It was really really good.

Made this Christmas morning and it was very good.  A little rich because of the pieces of cream cheese. Will follow other suggestions next time.  Overall liked it a lot and will make again.

This was okay, but it seemed to be missing something, perhaps some cinnamon.  The cream cheese didn't really melt either, it was just in the cubes, which I thought was unusual.

Very good. One complaint was that it was a little soggy. I used butter pecan syrup in place of the maple.

I was not overly impressed with this - perhaps it would have been better if I'd used higher quality maple syrup, but I don't think I'll try again.

This recipe tasted very good and was really different from anything I've made before. I did mix the cream cheese with the first half of the cinammon bread instead of sprinkling it over the bread. It was a bit musy underneath and the look of it wasn't real appealing, but it was still very good.

I made this for company.  Although it went over "pretty" well, it was almost too soggy and sweet.  The leftovers were not eaten so the time, effort and expense weren't really worth it.  If I make it again, I will definitely make a smaller portion to avoid leftovers.  I don't know what to do about correcting the soggy part.

This recipe was wonderful.  I made it for an indulgent New Year's breakfast and it was a hit.  I did change the number of eggs to 6 and added some orange zest(I'm not an egg fan).  I served it with Bacon, lots of maple syrup,cinnamon,fresh blueberries and loads of whipped cream.The best breakfast.

Absolutely fabulous! I made it exactly by the recipe the evening before and baked it at 10:00 the next day. It puffed up beautifully in the oven and was moist but firm. EVERYONE, indeed, wanted the recipe. A great recipe!

I made to pans for a large family brunch and not a bite was left. I melted the vream cheese as suggestd and the cooking time (we are at high altitude) was 50 minutes.  Perfect, not soggy and a huge hit.

All of my guests seemed to love this recipe.  It did take much longer than said time to cook in my oven (and I even raised the temp to 350).  I melted the cream cheese and added extra raisins (1/3 cup Sunmaid Baking Raisins) as some suggested. The longer it sat, the more delicious it was.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will make this again and experiment a little more : )

This was wonderful!  I think I'll try to find a good glaze, and have it sometime for dessert as bread pudding!  YUM!  Definately will make it again.
