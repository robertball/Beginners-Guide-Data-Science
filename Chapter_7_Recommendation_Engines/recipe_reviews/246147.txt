I removed less cheese, it was a bit too intense for the amount of tortilla.

Tasty. I added a layer of cheddar and that helped the quesadillas retain their shape. I love Gorgonzola - you'd have to love it before you picked this recipe. You can really taste it.

It was delicious! I substituted the cheese and added cooked pineapple. I also added uncooked spinach shortly after adding onion and garlic and cooked together.

Gorgonzola is kinda salty and I hate thinking about the fact that I'm eating mold but it wasn't bad.
