I'm very surprised more people haven't tried this recipe. It makes GREAT cookies!!! They remind me of favorite choc. chip cookies I get from a local restaurant. I was searching around to find a recipe that was close to them and I found it!! Definitely roll them in a ball--don't smash and be generous with the portions. You won't be disappointed!

This is a great recipe.  I made it as written but made big balls which took about 14 minutes (in my oven) to cook. By making them big they stayed very moist inside and crispy outside and didn't spread much. Next time I make them I'll add flax seed and craisins-super easy to change up the additions.  thanks!

Great cookie!!  I had to bake mine for 15 minutes but I rolled balls the size of walnuts, so that may be the reason.  This is definitely a keeper!

Delicious, nice and slightly crisp edges with soft centers.  I didn't have any coconut, but the cookies didn't need it.  Plus I didn't tell my "hates whole wheat" kids that there was whole wheat flour in these--and they never noticed!
Thank you R.Huddle for the recipe.

These are excellent cookies.  I brought them to work to share and several people asked for the recipe.  I made just a couple little changes.  I substituted pecans for the walnuts.  I didn't have enough chocolate chips so I used some toffee chips to make up the difference.  And I added 2 T of wheat germ and 1/4 c flaxseed meal just for the health of it all.
