I made this for my husband last night and he loved it!!.. I didnt have cake flour so used all purpose..I made it in a bundt pan and then piped "Cream Cheese Frosting II" all over the top.. I then sprinkled some finely chopped walnuts to finish it off.. My husband likes cold cake so I put it in the fridge and he absolutely loved it!..

This cake is WOW!!!!  I am so picky about cakes regarding whether they are moist and flavorful. This cake/recipe is really superb.  I am so glad I went with this recipe of the many banana cake recipes on this site.  The reason I did was that I did not want to buy a whole container of buttermilk that the other more highly rated recipe had.  This banana cake called for sour cream and cake flour and I had both at home.  I do find that cakes that call for cake flour are more tender and moist and this one holds true.  Like other reviewers suggested...I used 3 bananas which measured 1Â½ cups of mashed banana.  I followed the recipe exactly. This is the most delicious cake I have made in a long, long time.  My six year old son asked if he can have this cake for his birthday cake next year.

One word - ohmigosh!! I love bananas and this is the best recipe I have tried for Banana Cake (I have tried several on this site). It is moist, fluffy, easy and deee-li-cious!! What's more, it is the perfect size - 9 in. square pan - for a small family or a small get-together. You don't have to worry about eating leftovers for the entire week , although this is sooo good, you WOULD want to eat this cake for an entire week. Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely wonderful! Instead of using 1 cups of banana, I used 5 bananas and the cake turned out with that 'banana-y omph' I didnt have cake flour, so i used bread flour and take away about 3.5 tablespoon away. Also, i used brown sugar cos we didnt have much white sugar left
Overall, this recipe is great! Moist and full of flavour. I suggest u use more than 1 cup of bananas though.. I love mine!!

Great cake.  Instead of sour cream, I added same amount of milk.  That could be why my cake took at least 15 more mins to back.  The outside was crusty and brown while the instead was still soft.  Overall however, it's a great cake.   Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Excellent!  Baked this in an 8x11 pan, and frosted it with Cream Cheese Frosting II (on this site). I used 3 blackening bananas which came to about 1 1/2 cups, but I forgot the vanilla extract. Used all-purpose flour, and it worked just fine. The cake is fantastic, very moist and superb banana flavor.  Thanks!

Amazing!  Other than substituting yogurt for the sour cream, I used the recipe as written, and it turned out delicious!  Highly recomended!

Excellent recipe! If you've ever tried one of the banana cakes sold in the tropical countries, then this thing is as close as it gets!! I have gathered quite a few banana cake recipes over the years, but this one is head and shoulders above the rest! 

Used 3 medium bananas. 
Substituted cake flour for all-purpose 1:1.  
Didn't have butter on hand, so used 8Tbls of corn oil.
Added 1 cup(~100g) of chopped walnuts, everything else is exactly as listed in the recipe. Don't reduce sugar, it's really at it's best with 1 1/4 cups! 

Baked in the 8.5 x 4.5inch pound cake rectangle at 340F for 1hour. Results are above all expectations!

I was wavering between this and the Banana Cake VI, and I'm really glad I picked this one! Used all-purpose flour and scaled the recipe to 18 servings for a two-layer cake, added chocolate chips to the batter, then iced with cream cheese icing. I love banana everything and this far exceeded even my high hopes! I couldn't get enough of it. Two layers in 9" round pans baked for about 25 minutes, so watch it if you alter it some. Absolutely wonderful and I can't wait to have an excuse to make it again.

This cake is excellent.  I even buy extra bananas and let them go black since we crave this so much.  The recipe mentions vanilla as an ingredient but doesn't tell you when to add it so make sure you don't forget to add it.  I added it after the bananas were added.  I topped the cake off with a rich butter icing.  Mmmmm it's definitely a hit.

I used the ingredients as directed but changed the technique, which is why I can definitively say that this is banana CAKE (light and fluffy) and not banana BREAD (heavy, dense).  Cream the butter and sugar until light, fluffy and noticeably lighter in color, a good few minutes.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each.  Add vanilla, then bananas.  Add flour mixture alternately in thirds with the sour cream, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. You WILL have a lighter cake.   Sweet, moist, banana-y.  Great for cupcakes (baked about 21-22 minutes at 350 degrees) and topped with vanilla or chocolate buttercream .

This is really good! I used 1 cup of sugar because I was afraid it might be too sweet. Didn't use the butter. Replaced it with 1/4 cup applesauce and 1 medium mashed banana for a lower calorie option, and it turned out great!

I had left over chocolate frosting to use. This does make a very good snack cake -- the kind you can pick up with your fingers because it is not airy, it is moist.

AMAZING! I used 3 bananas, and added a teaspoon of cinnamon. Everyone LOVED it and said it was the best banana bread/cake they'd ever had!  It was gone in a flash.  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site, and it rocked!  Thank you for the awesome recipe!

I would give this 10 stars if I could!!! VERY good - I did not have cake flour so I used regular, I also used 1/2 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown as others  suggested. I also substituted strawberry banana yogurt for the sour cream.  I will make it this way all the time!

I was not super impressed with this recipe, which was really disappointing given all the rave reviews! I wonder if my bananas may have been too overripe though - the reason we didn't love this is it was just too sweet.  And it didn't turn out as dense as we would have liked either. Maybe I'll try it again with bananas that aren't black yet and see if that makes a difference.

This was outstanding!  I took it to Bible study and all the ladies wanted the recipe!  I cut the sugar down to 1 cup as others recommended and added the vanilla with the bananas.  I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  I topped it with whipped cream .  It was fairly simple and really delicious!

Very nice, light banana cake!  I gave it a 4 because it could stand to have more banana, as reviewers have stated.  I did it at 18 servings and baked as layers.  I sprinkled some chocolate chips on mine--they sunk to the bottom, of course, and left my hubby's without because chocolate triggers migraines for him.  I'll try it again with more banana, to see if I like it better that way.

The banana cake was great! My family finishes the cake within a day. I followed the reviews and cut down the amt of sugar to 3/4 cup. The cake was not too sweet and tasted just right and moist.

This cake was so yummy. I made my own topping for it using 1/2 cup butter, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup coconut and 1/2 cup of crushed walnuts. It made the cake sweeter, I don't think the cake on its own would have been sweet enough for me.

Wow!!  All of my family members and all of my coworkers LOVED this cake and asked for a copy of the recipie!  My eight year old son decided that this was the cake he wanted for his birthday cake.  This cake was probably the most moist banana cake I have ever had. I used a recipie for cream cheese frosting from this site, the one with the folded in whip cream and this cake was to die for.  I hurried up and printed coppies off my computer so I would have it handy at all times.

This is an absolutely delicious cake - every crumb gets eaten.  I put a butter cream icing on it.  I have doubled the recipe and it works too.

Excellent!  Easier than my Mom's recipe that I had to beat egg whites til stiff!  I did make a few changes since we are on a diet...I used non fat yogurt instead of the sour cream, and I used egg beaters instead of eggs, and It was still delicious!  I would recommend it and definitely would make it again1  A Winner!

This recipe was excellent!! I didn't have white sugar so I used brown sugar and it was really good!  I also used a little more banana than was called for. I almost forgot the vanilla too, so I used double the amount!  It was GREAT!! Really moist and delicious.  I will definately make it again.

Just made this cake in a 8x11 glass pan.  It is very good!  I used regular flour instead of cake and I used 4 bananas.  My husband really likes it! I also used the cream cheese frosting recipe from this site.  I'm definitely making this again.  Next time I will include some chocolate chips,

This cake is awesome - unbelievably moist, light and full of banana flavor.  I used 3 over ripe bananas and all purpose flour instead of cake (didn't have it).  While the cake didn't rise as much as I would've liked, the flavor and consistency is excellent.  Now I just need to find a good icing recipe (more like a drizzle) that I can use with this cake, and it'll be perfect.

I made this today, and as others suggested, used 3 bananas (1 1/2 cups)...delicious!! Moist, and very banana..eey!! I didn't have cake flour, so I used White Lilly a.p. flour, baked in a bundt pan, and topped with a frosting made with a little butter, confectioners sugar, and mashed banana. Will definitely make again, thanks!!

Very yummy recipe.  I did not change anything about the recipe but when cooking it I bake it in a 9X13 dish and only cooked it for about 20-25 mins.  I actually made it twice in a week and both times it was gone by the next day.

Really pleased with the outcome of this cake.  I baked in a Bundt pan and the 45 minutes was perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly other than using 1/2 tsp of Banana extract and 1/2 tsp Vanilla extract.

Really great recipe--this is more like cake and less like bread! I loved it.   I cut down the sugar to 1c and it was still very sweet. Also added walnuts and dried cranberries to the batter--yum.   I used a Bundt pan and it came out beautifully after about 35-40 mins.

This was tasty and quick to make. It was similar to banana bread. I did not have butter or sour cream, so I used veg. oil with a touch of extra flour, and plain yogurt. With these changes, I found it was well done after only 35 minutes.

Wonderful recipe. Easy to make and very moist and scrummy! I tried a little when it was fresh out of the oven (couldn't wait!)and the moment I sliced through the cake I knew it's a success. The texture is soft but not soggy and crumbs tender. I had to help myself to a second piece!  As I did not have sour cream or plain yogurt at hand, I substituted with fat-free strawberry yogurt. The cake turned out to have a hint of berry-ness which is a lovely touch. I used a little less than 1 cup of sugar to compensate for the sugar in the yogurt (plus ripe bananas are loaded with sugar!).I also sprinkled some cinnamon but not too much as you don't want to over-powder the banana flavour.  Cake flour is essential to ensure light and tender texture. (This is a banana cake not banana bread, which is denser)I used a wooden spoon to mix in the bananas and flour. It's important not to overmix the batter. Be sure to use very ripe bananas :)

Mmmm! The recipe is excellent as written. I made the following alterations: I used 3 ripe bananas which was about 1 1/2 cup and used all purpose flour since I didn't have cake flour. Replace 1/4 cup white sugar with brown sugar. Replace 1/4 cup butter with unsweetened applesauce. Replace sour cream with plain yogurt. Added 1/4 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. Tasty...almost like a chocolate chip cookie!

This was easy to make.  I had a bunch of bananas that were ripening and I mashed them up and made this cake.  I gave it away to help my own waistline and everyone loved it, including my student's cat.  Weird cat!

I added more banana, cinnamon, a pinch of salt, 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder to make up for the heaviness of the brown sugar and the extra bananas; sprinkled top with walnuts.   WE LOVE IT!!  I drizzle ice it with the vanilla glaze from this site.

I was not overly thrilled with this recipe. Maybe I did something wrong because it took forever to bake in my oven and the outside turned out hard while the inside was too moist. The flavor was ok but not especially sweet or banana-ish for a cake. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Excellent cake!  It was very moist, smelled and tasted fabulous, especially with a thick layer of cream cheese frosting!  Don't forget to add the vanilla, as the written directions skip that part even though it is listed in the ingredient list.

This is a very moist cake.  I did use 2 cups mashed bananas, used half white sugar and half brown sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg; so because of all the changes is why I only give it 4 stars.  Over all it is a pretty good cake

I just made a double batch - getting rid of some pretty mushy bananas. 

It really is a good cake recipe. Almost like a loaf recipe more than a cake and really simple to make.

I used regular All purpose flour and just reduced the amount of it by 6 tablespoons (3 per batch) instead of the cake flour. 

I had to cook it an extra 10 minutes maybe. It came out a dark brown with a crispy/harder top - which I love. The double mix made 2 x 8 inch round cakes plus 2 x small loaves. 

I will make this one again - if I remember where to find the recipe!

This was fantastic! Like the others said. don't forget about the vanilla. I did a low-fat version. I used applesauce and a little bit of Promise butter substitute. Also half and half of brown & white sugar. You don't even need frosting for this- it is so good. Even my husband who doesn't care for bananas really liked this cake!

This was a big hit after dinner. I didn't have any sour cream so substituted plain low-fat yoghurt and it worked just fine. Also, I baked it in a 7x11 glass pan and frosted it with a canned chocolate fudge frosting. It was wonderful, thanks.

I'm pretty sure i've rated this 5 already, but this cake is so awesome.  It is a fail-safe recipe.  I use regular flour and add a half tsp of nutmeg and cinnamon for added flavor.  Everyone I gifted with this cake loves this...thanks Cristin!

This was extremely moist and delicious.  I, like most other reviewers put more bananas in - I put in five really ripe bananas (about 1.5-2cups) and kept everything else the same.  It was fantastic.  Also used the cream cheese frosting II as recommended by another reviewer.  Wonderful!

Great banana cake! It tastes like the one I used to buy from KL(Malaysia) bus terminal whenever I went back to Malaysia. My fiance and I love this cake very much. However, I would make some changes next time, eg: bake in muffin cups, top with sliced banana etc.

This was so easy to make I used yogurt instead of sour cream because that is what I had on hand...I was looking for a way to use ripe bananas and am glad I tried this.

Great way to use up overly-ripe bananas....I used all-purpose flour (I didn't have cake flour), extra vanilla, and substituted vanilla non-fat yogurt for the sour cream (didn't have any sour cream, either!). I frosted the cake with butter cream frosting.  Perfect sized for 3 people.  Yum! Will definitely make this one again!

When I served this cake to one person the reaction I got was (quoting here) "Oh my God! Thank you for making this! It's SO good. I'm glad you like to bake." It is really moist and deeply flavorful, and quite easy to make. I followed other reviewers' suggestion' by substituting European-style yogurt for the sour cream (great idea), increasing the bananas a bit, and increasing the vanilla a bit. Also I cut the fat by just a bit, about 3 Tablespoons. It's really delicious, and the texture is a winner.

I had a picky eater over for lunch today, my daughters play date, and she loved this cake.  It was very moist and delicious.  It was also very easy to prepare.  I iced it with chocolate icing.

I made this last night and topped it with homemade caramel icing.  It was very moist and flavorful.  It makes the perfect size cake for 2 people.  This will be my new standard banana cake recipe.  It is a really excellent and easy to prepare recipe.

This cake is very good.  I usually make a 9x13 banana cake and it is always too much and I end up throwing half of it away.  This recipe made just the right amount!  It was very good and moist.  I will definitely make it again.

This is a gorgeous simple recipe that can easily be embellished to make delectable. I tried it last night to my amazed delight. I'll say aside from one supernaturally amazing carrot cake I made with two friends once, this is easily the best cake I ever made! I don't have access to sour cream in the country we live in. I used plain full fat yoghurt with a spoon of Apple cider vinegar instead. I added a 1/2 tsp of salt and a tsp of cinnamon. Doubled the bananas. Halved the soda & used 1 tsp baking powder. I only have a small tabletop oven but the cake was done in the same amt of time listed. Moist but not undercooked, not overly sweet, buttery and beautiful. I'm 8 nmonths pregnant and am not ashamed to say I've almost single-handedly finished the whole thing! ...maybe I'll share some with my family...maybe...

One of the best recipes i have found. i changed the portions from 12 to 18 and baked in a copper bundt pan. I used yogurt instead of sour cream. VERY moist - maybe a little too moist but that is a variable hard to control. Yummy.

This was a nice change from regular banana bread and the family LOVES it! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a bundt pan and (based on suggestions from previous ratings) I added a light frosting on top (Cream Cheese Frosting II) and some chopped walnuts. Perfection!

YUM!!! This is awesome! UNBELEIVABLY moist an tender!!! Not your average banana bread! I cannot express how perfectly this turned out. I added 1/2 cup banana (to use up what I had) which required me to bake it an extra 10-20 minutes (in a loaf pan b/c I just moved and couldn't find my bundt pan). Thank you! Perfect for company or a gift basket. I made a yellow icing and drizzled zig zags. Beautiful. 
For icing:
1 cup powdered sugar 
Milk (add until desired consistency is reached)
2 drops yellow food coloring
1/2 Tsp banana extract (or to taste). Can even make little banana designs if you make a small bit of the icing green! Enjoy!

The best banana cake I have ever made!   And, it was so easy.  I upped the servings to 18 so that it would work well in a 9x13in pan and topped it with cream cheese icing.

I made two changes for the sake of what I had on hand:  used AP flour instead of cake flour and greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  this is a very nice, moist, banana cake.  I tend to prefer banana cakes or breads with more banana, but this was lovely.  I used a bundt cake pan instead of the 9x9 and it still baked up just fine.  thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent recipe as is.  My own personal tweaks are that I use 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, double the vanilla and use 3-4 bananas.  LOVE IT.

This was delicious.  I had no sour cream, so I substituted with some fat free half and half.  I also made these in cupcake form and stuffed with cream cheese icing.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a wonderful moist cake. I followed the directions exactly and we loved it. Lighter than a banana bread and yet more dense than a traditional cake. I will continue to make it exactly as the recipe indicates, it was just the right sweetness for us.

Thought this was a good way to use up some older banannas. I used chocolate chips and so glad I did. I was good but way better with something sweet in it.

The recipe is good, but here are some alterations i made to make it better. Instead of all white sugar i did 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup white sugar. I added 4 whole bananas to give it extra banana flavor. Also I added chocolate chips to the cake after I put it in the pan already. Whenever I bring this cake to work it gets gobbled up so quickly, no one has a chance for 2nds!

I used all-purpose flour and yogurt instead of sour cream and a little less sugar.  I also added chocolate chips and cream cheese icing.  It really had great banana flavor, but wasn't really a cake.  It was just like banana bread, probably because of my changes.

We liked this recipe.  I'm sure it would have been good as is, but I made some changes.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 13 x 9 pan, no time or temp adjustments needed.  I used 4 mashed bananas and it worked fine.  I also threw in a cup of chopped walnuts, and a handful of chocolate chips and a handful of toasted coconut.  I am quite sure I will be making this recipe again soon!

Personally, I like rich cakes. So I topped almost all the ingredients. Everyone who tried the cake loved the first variation the most (it has beautiful aroma, was dense, rich, moist and satisfying). Very different from the usual banana cake (bread like) recipes.
Thanks!
1 cup of banana instead of what was called for. Replaced sour cream with same amount of full cream milk and approx. 1 Tbsp of cream cheese. Replaced 2/3 of white sugar with palm sugar. Added these too; 1/2 tsp of banana essence, 1/2 tsp of grounded cinnamon & 1/8 tsp of nutmeg powder. generously sprinkled assortment of nuts (peanut & almond sliced, pecans roughly chopped & raisins).
In another batch, I made some changes; mixed grounded nuts (assortment) and chunky nuts (assorted with raisins) & chocolate chips into the batter. Because of the inclusion of choco chips, I reduced the sugar amount to maintain the sweetness. Top it with icing sugar n tiny weeny bit of cinnamon.

I really liked this recipe.  I didn't have sour cream so I used a little milk.  I put it into a 9x13 pan and sprinkled chopped walnuts on top.  Yum.  Not too sweet and more like a snack cake.

This is a fast, easy, inexpensive, and delicious recipe.  Sometimes I double the recipe and layer with cream cheese icing.  It makes it very sweet, like an Italian creme.  Best idea is to sprinkle with a bit of powdered sugar and enjoy!

Great recipe, very easy. I took the reviewers' suggestions and decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup. Also, we can't get sour cream here so I used milk and added 1 T of vinegar. Also reduced the soda to 1/2 tsp and added 1 tsp baking powder.  The cake came out nice and light, and our Chinese friends loved it. I'll definitely make this again!

The cake came out perfect. Moist but not dense. I did not mash and measure the banana but only threw in two very riped into the cake mixer. No problem at all. However, I used two 5x9 bread pan as I did not have one 9x9. It was a mistake because the cakes did not rise a lot so they were rather flat.

I brought this to class and they ate it all up, It was really moist. I cut the sugar to a little less than one cup, and added cinnamon and nutmeg as well. I would love a nice frosting to go with it.

LOVE IT!  My husband and I inhaled 1/2 of the cake in just a few minutes like it was bread on a table.  I didn't have sour cream, so used yogurt as others have suggested.  This is a recipe to share.  thank you!

Good- but not as amazing as other reviewers thought.  Cooked for 35 min and could have probably cooked for a little less. Used 1 cup sugar and sweet enough.  Again, good but not amazing.  Next time I might add some chocolate chips!

I used 3/4 c. white sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar.  I added a pinch of clove and pinch of fresh nutmeg.  Bake time in my oven was 38 minutes.  Don't forget the vanilla in the instructions it does not tell you to put in the vanilla (I add when blending the sugar and butter).  Very good as is.  I don't think it needs frosting.  I like having the cake warm w/butter.  I will try frosting some other time.  Thank you.

Very moist and flavorful.  I added a dash of cinammon to mine as well using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  Covered with powdered sugar - it makes a complete snack!

This was grrrrrrrrrrrrreat!  This is like the perfect banana cake recipe, the only change I made was I cut down the sugar because I don't like overly sweet; I put 1/3 cup of white & brown sugar.  It turned out better than I would have ever thought possible; it's moist with wonderful flavor and the perfect amount of sweetness.  Enjoy!

Too sweet for my liking.  to the health conscious people: you might want to reduce sugar by half.  and use really ripe bananas for a full and rich banana flavor.

It is a good recipe but I would definitly use 3/4 cup each of brown and white sugar, 1 more banana and 1/2 tsp more of vanilla. Better off as cup cakes!

As per suggestions, i used 3/4 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar.  Next time i will use 1/2 cup of each sugars instead since it was a little too sweet for me.  It is also very important to use cake flour if you want that light and fluffy texture of a cake.  Overall the cake was delicious and will make again. Used the whipped cream,cream cheese frosting.

Made this cake many times and it's great, ripe Banana's are always the go. In a fan forced oven drop the temp to 150 for the full 45 min.

Oh so moist!  I doubled the recipe and used a 13x9 cake pan.  I had six almost black banana's and used all of them in the recipe. Great banana flavor.  I can't wait to eat another piece of cake!

Very easy recipe with great results.  I also did not have any cake flour so I used all purpose (1 1/2 c sifted less 3 tbsp) and I used brown sugar instead of white.  For an extra treat I also added frozen blueberries.  Thanks for sharing!

my bf, who does not normally like desserts, loves this!  i made small tweaks to the recipe: 2 tsp of vanilla, a little less flour, 1 1/4 c bananas, fat-free greek yogurt (i swear by this stuff!) for sour cream.  i topped it with homemade buttercream frosting, but it's sweet and delicious w/o it.

This was exactly what I was looking for. Like another reviewer, I used more bananas than called for (because I needed to get rid of them). I also subbed the same amount - coconut sugar in lieu of white sugar - and it was not too sweet at all - very mildly sweet. The consistency was very moist and delicate. I added some crushed walnuts and cinnamon too, and used a bundt pan. It took about 35 minutes instead of 45. My household enjoyed this - it's fluffier and softer than a banana bread and was awesome with vanilla bean ice cream.

I've made this several times, and it is definitely my go-to recipe. I use AP flour, as I don't usually have cake flour on hand. It turns out great, not as fluffy as cake, but not as dense as traditional banana bread.

Fantastic recipe. Also used yoghurt and 3 banana. Next time I will reduce the sugar. It's moist and rich enough that you don't need to butter it when you're having a cuppa for tea.

This cake was delicious. It was sweet and moist. I didn't have cake flour so I used AP. I also had fresh blueberries on hand and added a pint to the mix. It was a delicious dessert and lovely with coffee in the morning. I will definitely make this again when I have over ripe bananas.

An extremely easy, moist and flavourful cake. I made a double quantity which gave me two reasonably deep cakes using 9" silicon moulds. Not having sour cream I used full cream milk and the juice of half a small lemon. I also used half margarine / half butter. The banana was coarsely crushed using a fork and so maintained a good texture. I think that next time I may well mix in some walnuts for an even more textured cake. i cooked it eventually for 50 minutes at 175C but next time I will raise the temperature to give a more crunchy top to the cakes.

Rated by my banana eaters. I don't like the flavor or texture of bananas so I didn't try it. Great way to use bananas that are turning brown.

This cake is very good and easy to make. I had to sub with flour + cornstarch because i didnt have any cake flour. I also used 4 bananas since they were ripe and ready.  Will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe! I made it today for Christmas Eve and my partner loved it! I followed the instruction almost exactly, except I added walnuts and raisins, and I replaced the sour cream with yogurt. I'll definitely be using this recipe again! Yum!

This banana cake is awesome.  Great flavor.  I had never made one with sour cream before, but this will be my go to recipe from now on.  Everyone loved it.  I used 4 bananas and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It is rich, moist and delicious.  No frosting required on this one.

Yummy! Came out moist and flavorful.  It was hard to leave in the oven the entire 45 min, but I'm glad I did. It baked perfect in my new convection oven. My rating is based on following the recipe exactly.

After reading all the reviews I tried this recipe and everyone loved it.  Right out of the oven with no frosting its that good.  I will definitely make this again.  I didn't have cake flour so I used all purpose and 5 over ripe small bananas.  Everything else stayed the same.  So moist and good.

Taste is amazing, but I did have to cook it much longer than what it states in the recipe, which is the only reason I marked it down a star. Def a keeper!

Realy good recipe. It was easily made and I loved how it turned out - lovely consistency, fairly moist. But, for me, it was just too sweet. I only put in 3/4 cup of sugar as I had thought 1 1/4 would have been way too much. I think the bananas are sweet enough already by themselves, so next time I'll probably add only half a cup of sugar. Or maybe even less...

This was delicious! I made this for my grandson who is allergic to dairy so I used coconut oil in place of the butter and non dairy sour cream. I also did not have cake flour so used all purpose flour. This cake was a hit!

I made this cake a second time and my children love it. I made a slight adjustment by using a three quarter cup of sugar (I used extremely overripe bananas) and added quarter tsp of cinnamon. Yum!

I was just looking for something fast and easy for a treat for our grandson and found thus recipe which I didn't have big hopes for. Well! Fast, yes, easy, yes, but they also rose beautifully into cupcakes that I made, and had a lovely flavour!
I baked the cupcakes for 20 minutes and they were golden and lovely! Thank you!

OMGee this receipe was FANTASTIC! I made it with about 5 bananas instead of just one cup to make sure it had a great banana flavor. I also added chopped walnuts into the batter. I made a dozen cupcakes and 24 minin-cupcakes. They are so moist and great with absolutely no frosting on them. Definitely a keeper.

Probably the best banana cake I have ever had.  The only thing I did different was I didn't have enough cake flour so I made up the difference with all purpose flour (it still worked) and I added mini choc. chips and pecans.  This would have been great without them but I just had the craving for them today.  My husband loved this as well.  Thanks for a great recipe and it's easy to make!

I made this yesterday because I had 5 overripe bananas to use. I doubled the recipe and made two rounds, stacked them with a banana buttercream icing in the middle and frosted the whole cake. I didn't make any changes to the recipe but did find I needed to bake the two rounds slightly longer. I can't say I am over impressed with this recipe but was expecting something a little different. My two year old is asking for this cake every hour so it can't be bad.

i made this cake right after dinner and i was sure i had messed up. it didnt rise more than a couple of inches, but as i looked through the pictures posted i realized that my cake looked just like everyone elses!! it was suprisingly moist and wasnt at all overwhelmingly sweet. i opted to add chocolate chips and was suprised to see everyone including my 2 year old cleaning their plates!

This is my first recipe from allrecipes.com and I am glad I used this one. It was GOOOOOOOOD. Also, I was kind of scared of using blacken/really ripped bananas so I used banana I bought the same day at the grocery store. The only issue was that I had to struggle a bit more to puree them and I added to table spoon of brown sugar to the bananas to give them a similar sweetness to rip/blackened one. I had 9 banana so I adjusted the flour in proportion. It gave me an 8X8 cake as well as 4X7 cake. Gave one to my  friend, she LOVED it. The best thing is that I personally found the cake to taste better the day after, once in room temperature and to have a better consistency. Thank you for the recipe!!!

Yes, quite moist. I did add about a half cup of chopped walnuts and 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg. My family and I really enjoyed this, me especially with hot coffee. This took 45 minutes to bake, covered halfway through with foil. NOTE: Little sweet. Next time, I'd cut the sugar in half and it'd be perfect. Let the sour cream/butter come through a little more.

I made this delicious cake for my husband's birthday. This was my first banana cake and it turned out perfect. I took the advice of previous reviewers and used 3 bananas. I also frosted it with cream cheese frosting and topped with walnuts. Everyone loved it. It was very moist and had a great flavour. Thanks for this recipe!

Wonderful! Fantastic! Very Very moist indeed. I didn't have cake flour, so I used all-purpose and added 3 tbsp cornstarch. I substituted 1/4 cup plain yogurt instead of sour cream (didn't have that either), and instead of the 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, I used 1 tablespoon. SOOOO YUMMY!!! This is a recipe I will use over and over again! Thanks!

Delicious!  I used all purpose flour (didn't have cake flour on hand) and a 9x9 pan and it came out great!  Right out of the oven it was pretty moist, but the second day it was perfect;  soft and fluffy.  I didn't use any glazes or frostings so it tastes a little more like a coffee cake/bread, but very good.  Will have again.  Thanks for the recipe!

What a wonderful taste!!!! If you love banannas or cake you will love this recipe.   Only thing I changed was the sugar.  Left off 1/4 cup. Everyone raved about the cake and it disappeared fast!

Great recipe! Very reminiscent of banana bread, probably because of my modifications - I used half brown sugar/half cane sugar (will reduce amount next time), added ~1.5tsp cinnamon, added an extra .25-.5c of banana, and a handful (~.25c) of slivered almonds. Fantastic result, but edges were a little too crisp while the inside was perfectly moist.  May play around with oven temp next time.   Great recipe - thanks for sharing!

Pretty good. We made this last weekend and it was gone in four days. Not quite as tasty as the one in the Edmond's Cookbook, but still very good. I used a simple butter icing with a few walnut halves on top.

Ugh.  my banana cake came out looking good, but smelled really strange upon closer inspection.  Seems to taste alright, but I've no idea why but it smells terrible despite the fact it's a simple recipe:  flour, eggs, banana, rising agent.

This cake was very easy to make and is very densley delicious.  I made this cake with 1/2 whole wheat gram flour, too. I also added a little more banana.  I think it would be good with pecans or walnuts added to it, too. Make sure you add the vanilla with the bananas as this step is left off of the recipe!

I made this as cupcakes for a first birthday party and it was GREAT! I tried it the weekend before and made some changes for the final batch. 

After creaming the butter and sugar and adding the eggs, I stopped using the mixer and only beat it by hand. 
I did use cake flour and that made a huge difference and I guesstimated that 2 bananas would be 1 cup. 
It was just awesome -the cakes were light and fluffy and full of flavor. 
I topped it with the whipped cream cheese frosting also on this site.

I made cake samples for a person that I am going to do their wedding cake, so I only use half of this recipe.  They loved it! The moist texture and the flavor were wonderful!  I did tweak the recipe with a little more banana and brown sugar, but it came out great.

SUPER MOIST! I doubled this recipe, used nonfat organic yogurt in place of the sour cream, added a pinch of cinnamon. I ran out of white sugar and used brown sugar for the last 1/2 cup needed. Doubled the recipe called for 2 cups sugar. Increased bananas to 2.5 cups of mashed banana. Added raw sunflower seeds and organic rasians. Baked in a Huge cast iron skillet for one hour-it tested done with a knife. The oven had been preheated to 375 and then lowered to 350 before I place the batter in to bake. It came out Super Moist and it has that heavy comfort food sensation when it hits bottom. Filling as well as having some nutritional value. Next recipe I am adding 1/2 Cup ground flax and possible lowering the sugar. Then experiment each time with extra fruit, nuts, etc...

Fabulous recipe however I did modify it slightly and it had people raving.  I accidentally miscalculated how much banana I had and was short by 100g so I added 100g of mashed persimmon.  Just before I put it in the oven I dropped some choc melts around the top of the batter which sank to the bottom as it cooked!! Turned out gorgeous - dense yet moist with choc chunks at the bottom!!  Finished it off with a real chocolate butter cream.  Was cleaned up at the office!!

very good and very moist cake. i didn't measure the bananas exactly since i just mashed 3 and put them in. i think it was a little more than the recipe calls for. other than that i followed the recipe word for word. my husband said it's the best banana cake/bread i've made to date.

WoW!!!  I'm always trying out new "Banana Cake" recipes...this one by far is most amazing!!!!  I wasn't "shy" with the mashed banana and topped off cake with Duncan Hines Homestyle Buttercream icing....well, let's just say I blew my diet due to multiple pieces I ate!  lol!  Worth the try and you wont' be dissapointed!

Nice and moist, although it wasn't as sweet as I would expect a cake to be.  My son insisted that it was bread and not cake.

Okay cake.  I used another reviewer's advice and added the cream cheese frosting and I think it took away from the cake. Would try again with sprinkled powder sugar.

It was a great recipe and I started it of by getting all the ingredients, but this is what I ended up happening to my recipe:
I had to subsitute the white sugar for brown sugar and since I bought whole wheat flour instead of cake flour then I used that instead. In the end I made a healthier version of the recipe with a great taste!
I served it with chocolate ice-cream and my husband and family really enjoyed it! 
If you want a good way to substitute the recipe and make it heart-healthy it turns out great!

I didn't use as much sugar (because ripe bananas are already sweet enough for me!) and used half white and half light brown sugar.  I also put in too many bananas so it came out mushy... so this is just an okay cake for me.

This cake turned out great. Soft and moist, not the least bit dry.  A great afternoon tea for the family.  For a little crunch add chopped pecans or walnuts to the batter, mmmm delish.

This recipe is a real winner. I followed the recipe exactly as written. This little cake turned out beautifully. I added some buttercream frosting and served it for a family dinner dessert. It was a hit. Highly recommended if you like banana.

This cake is fantastic. I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup light brown sugar and thougth it was sweet enough. I also used more banana because I had them.  This is a very moist, flavorful cake and I'll be making it again soon.

This was divine! I had 3 bananasin the freezer plus one starting to turn. Lots of banana flavour and extremely moist. I forgot the vanilla and I didn't really miss it. I used fat free sour cream and topped with cream cheese icing and chopped walnuts. My mother-in-law even took some cake home and copied the recipe. I can't wait to have some tonight. I am thinking of making it again this weekend for when my parents visit. Definitely a new favourite!!!

Superb recipe!  Made two cakes:  one as stated in the recipe (except subbing low-fat natural yoghurt for the sour cream), and one with wholemeal flour and 3/4 cup of walnut pieces added.  Both were delicious, but I have to say the wholemeal/walnuts one went down the best!  (Kindof like carrot cake, but bananary...  mmmmmm...).  Will definitely be a regular with us!!

My husband never asks for seconds when it comes to dessert, but he did this time!  We all loved it.  I too used brown sugar instead of white and yogurt in place of sour cream.  I also agree with others that a little more banana would be better.

I used the recipe for Cinnamon Bun Icing on this cake for a REAL treat!

This is a really good recipe. Just know that it comes out more like banana bread than cake. It's moist like cake, but is definitely a banana bread. I was looking for a banana cake and was really surprised at the result. Maybe I didn't read the other reviews closely enough b/c I thought it was going to be a cake cake.

This is insanely delicious.  Out of this world.  I amde it for Easter Brunch and I swear, I didn't want to put it out, I wanted it all to myself.  I took some suggestions of others and tweaked it a bit.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour , I used 1/2c of brown sugar and 3/4c white sugar, increased the vanilla to 2 teaspoons and I also used "I can't believe it's not butter" Light.  Thank you for shareing Cristin.  This one is a keeper.

This cake is EXCELLENT!  I've made it twice (exactly as the recipe is written), and it's so easy and so good that my husband is asking me to make it for a party next weekend.  I may never make banana bread again, this cake is simple, very moist, and needs no frosting.  My 2 year old loves it too, she asks for it as soon as it comes out of the over.  The only comment that I have is that I have to bake it at 340 degrees for 50-55 minutes in a glass (Pyrex) pan.

Delicious, moist, very easy & quick.  Next time I will try serving with cream of coconut (warmed, as a sauce) as I had tried in a Thai restaurant, & was delicious!
