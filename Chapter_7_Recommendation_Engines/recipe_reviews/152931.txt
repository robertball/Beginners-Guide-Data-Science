For this to turn out, ALL the liquid must evaporate.  the mizure turns from liquid to syrup to a stringy consistency, and then crystalizes onto the almonds.  Be sure to stir consistently throughout... this process takes just under 30 minutes.

The trick to this recipe is to cook it until there is no liquid.  If you get the sticky kind, that means you need to cook it longer.  I have made this a many times and came out great!!!  I made pecans and almonds to mix.

Very simple, easy recipe that produces light, crispy, sugary candied almonds.  I'm glad I read the other reviews explaining that the almonds must cook until the water is gone, that is the key to the almonds coming out crispy and not soggy.

Spiced nuts are always a hit at holidays, but I use them all year long for toppings on muffins, sweet yeast breads, salads and yogurt. There is a simple trick to making them though.  I use a candy thermometer and cook the sugar, cinnamon, and water mixture to the "soft ball" stage, approximately 238 degrees.  Then I add the nuts (I use about 3 cups of any kind of nuts I happen to have on hand), and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the mixture starts to lose it "shine". (It will look almost "dull") Immediately pour onto a waxed paper lined cookie sheet. My mother used to add nutmeg and cloves to her spiced walnuts.  There were rarely any left over after the first day!

OMG-Fantastic and SOOO easy!  MAKE SURE that you read the other reviews-thats what saved me becasue I was ready to take them out when they were gooey.  KEEP cooking in the pan until the goo is gone and they are nicely "chunky" with the sugar mixture.  This was SO good and a huge hit! Great for office presents during the holidays or any occasion. Just add to a cute tine and you are good to go! Thanks other reviewers and thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Dragée nuts are one of my favorite candies to make. This is a great method for hazelnuts and macadamias, too. I’ve used a recipe just like this, but with only half the cinnamon and using blanched almonds. Cook until the nuts are dry and covered with a bumpy whitish sugar coating. When they're cool, toss them with warm melted bittersweet chocolate and then into a bowl of unsweetened cocoa powder. They should have a hard sugar coating topped with a hint of chocolate and cocoa. (I wear latex gloves when working with chocolate; you can change gloves anytime your hands get chocolatey or sticky.)

This is great. I wish someone has mentioned that I should have lowered the heat before smoking up the kitchen with the burning sugar, though. So, after you add the almonds, lower the heat. Then it turns out GREAT!!!

This is an AMAZING and simple recipe!! They taste just like what you get at the fall festivals, and are just what I was looking for! As everyone else says, read all the reviews, make sure to cook until every drop of the liquid is gone. It may seem like it's never going to happen, but as soon as it starts, it happens in seconds! Also, if you bake the almonds for about 8 minutes (stir halfway) at 400 degrees, it gives the nuts extra flavor and crunch!

Although I was disappointed that I had no white sugar, I used brown sugar. It tasted wonderful, and the whole house smelled of molasses! Great recipe!

I made this for a dinner party as a topper for a spring green/ gorganzola/ cranberry/ green apple salad and people were eating them straight out of the serving dish. My best friend asked me to make them for her birthday. The only thing I would recommend is cooking them until the syrup is VERY thick. I think I put them out to cool too early and they were a bit stickier than I would have liked. (I substituted walnuts for almonds, by the way). All in all, though, a great and EASY recipe.

these are really addicting.  I'm not sure if I did it right, but I kept stirring until there was no more liquid.  They turned out great, but they aren't glazed and shiney like the picture.

Took this one a little too far and burned everything when I followed a reviewer suggestion that this would take 30 minutes. 
 
Around 15 minutes in, as suggested in the recipe, the sugar crystallized but then it began to melt again before all the liquid was gone and everything went wrong right about the time I began to second guess myself. 

Otherwise, my house smells terrific. I will gather myself and try this again as a snack for my son's birthday party since the pan escapees from the point of crystallization are delicious!

These were definitely delicious!! Mine were not so much candy coated but sorta coated with a crumbly sugar. They don't look like the picture. I stirred them constantly until the moisture was all gone. Any suggestions?? Did I cook to high or for too long. I will definitely keep trying but they are also great just the way they are too.

This was an AWESOME and extremely easy recipe. The only thing I forgot to check was whether or not my almonds were crunchy first. I got done with the recipe and the almonds were soft with a crisp tasty coating. I just need to bake the almonds next time to make them crunchy too :]

This was really easy to make.  I'm glad I had the reviews first and cooked the almonds until all liquid was gone. My added suggestion would be to make sure you have the wax paper ready because the mixture hardens very quickly.

These are perfect- just like we've had at the fair.  The directions are a little misleading- DO NOT stop cooking when the almonds seem covered in syrup.  Keep going until the syrup has turned into a sugary consistency- almost like a sugary powder.  Then quickly remove it from heat and scrape out onto the waiting wax paper to cool.  This is very good ground up and served over ice cream.  YUM!

These are pretty good.  I followed the other reviewers advice and cooked the almonds in the sugar mixture until almost all the liquid was evaporated, but I could have cooked them a little less and been fine.  If I make them again, I will wait to add the almonds until the syrup has reduced signficantly, as cooking the almonds in the syrup for that long gave them a slightly weird texture.

My husband came home with a three pound bag of almonds from Costco and I was thinking what ever will I do with this! I tried this recipe and it was quick and easy.  I thought it was very good but I would like to add a little vanilla next time and maybe brown sugar. I felt like it was missing a little something but I will definately use it again. Atleast now I can use up some of those nuts!

The recipe works well the way it is, but here is an added twist to this recipe - I once cooked the almonds too long past they're dry and the sugar started melting and turned into hard caramel (I originally thought that they were not dry enough because the looked wet). I lifted the almonds, spread them out on parchment paper, and waited for them to dry up and harden. You must spread them while they are hot, otherwise they will clump together and there will be no way to separate them. Anyways, this surprising outcome was amazing - I started making hard caramel coated almonds and they went out in a snap. A problem with this is that the sugar started burning pretty quickly (then you get burnt caramel - not so good). So if you are going to try this, be careful, use low heat, and be patient.

I tried this recipe and followed exactly they burnt before the liquid was close to being gone. I cooked them on 4 for heat, I have an electric stove. I make alot of brittles,and hard candies so I am not sure what went wrong. I did stand and stir them with a wooden spoon the entire time. I rated in between bec of my problems

Didn't work for me!  The sugar never crystallized.  What a waste of ingredients.  I can't suggest how this could have been avoided but don't recommend trying this unless you don't mind wasting almonds.

These are amazing! The ONLY thing I would do differently is toast the almonds before placing them in the sugar mixture for more crunch and flavor to the almonds. Even without doing this they are awesome! They are actually better the next day in our opinion!

Wonderful and easy recipe! I have tried several candied nuts recipes and this one is the best (and no butter!! awesome!) I followed other reviews that said to keep stirring away until it was sort of powdery. I was worried about burning but kept on stirring. They came out perfectly! Make these!

These are so good!  I had to comment and share my experience with them, so it doesn't happen to someone else.  Once the liquid is all gone, make sure you take them off the heat right away--otherwise you get a very burned ooey gooey mess to clean up.  First batch was horrible, but once I realized I missed the "sweet spot", we tried it again and the second batch was wonderful!  I will be making these for christmas gifts this year.  :)

Ive made a lot of batches of this, I've also substituted Pecans and hazel nuts for the Almonds with good success.  

If you cook the syrup (sugar, cinnamon, water) until it goes from soupy to syrupy and then add the nuts and cook until it starts to clump/all stick together while stirring you should get the right results.  

I dont use the wax paper, I just dump them from the pan onto a clean cookie sheet/jelly roll pan raised on a cooling rack and let it sit for a minute or 2 before spreading them out.

This is a great recipe - just like what you would find at a traditional German xmas market. It got rave reviews from everyone that tried it. I followed the recipe as written with the exception that I added a vanilla pod to the sugar mixture as it cooked, and reduced the cinnamon a bit because my husband isn't a big fan of it. I will definitely be making this recipe over and over again. Thanks for sharing, DarlaJo!!

These were WONDERFUL! Everyone loves them and says I could sell them! I bought a tiny bag of these at the farmer's market for $6 but could make the same thing for so much cheaper! I only added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla (and would probably add a little more next time).

Every other batch I make burns.  And the last batch woouldn't even crystalize.  The sugar got syrupy then it turned grainey, didnt stick to the alomonds very well at all.  The burned batches will get to a thick syrup stage and will smell heavenly then suddenly it turns watery and burns.  I dont get it!  I have wasted like $60 worth of almonds to make this blasted thing for Christmas gifts and still have nothing to show. Im so pissed!! :-

This recipe is wonderful.  My daughter and I made a few batches to give as Christmas gifts to co-workers.  After they cooled we scooped them into small gift bags and tied pretty ribbons to the bags.  As I read on other reviews, the almonds have to stay cooking on stove until the mixture is dry! The house smells wonderful!!  Thank you DarlaJo!  This recipe is a keeper!

Made these for neighbors this Christmas. I mixed almonds and pecans and added about 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper to cinnamon mixture. After I spread the nuts on the baking sheet to dry, I sifted a bit of unsweetened chocolate powder over them. Yummy! The layers of flavor were scrumptious!

I did these as a last minute topping for a pear/blue cheese dessert, and they turned out beautifully. I used half brown and half white sugar. I cooked them till the nuts were still a little sticky, and then turned off the heat and let them cool. By the time they were back to room temperature, the sugar had crystallized.

So simple, so good.  These are always a hit and I have made them several times.  As other said...just be sure to cook long enough for the coating to completely dry on the stove.  It will take longer than the recipe states.

Just like Ren Fair!  These were so easy to make (15 minutes from start to finish).  I will make these again and again.  Followed the advise of others, boiled until liquid was gone.  Delicious!

Better than the ones you can buy in the mall at Christmas. The almonds are much more tender than the mall ones. My family ate them in one sitting. Definately a keeper.  Followed all the advise and cooked until the sides of the pan looked like dry cinnamon and all the moisture was gone. SOO GOOD!

Turned out great! Followed everything to a T, and it turned out faster than I thought. My husband doesn't really care for almonds, but he loved these! We are having an ice cream party for my daughters birthday and now I know what toppings I'll be making for it! Just make sure that you use a wooden spoon! LOLBut really, almost lost one of my plastic spoons.....sounds dumb, but I didn't even think of it til it happened!

Wonderful!  Added 1/2 cup of brown sugar and a pinch of chinese 5 spice to the mixture.  Delicious, especially after roasting them briefly (about 10 min) in a 250 degree oven just to give them that roasted/toasted flavor as well. Will be making much more for holiday gifts!

Wow is all I have to say. I just finished making these and they are amazing. I cannot stop eating them! I love that they have a perfect mix of being sweet, but not to the point of masking the taste of the almonds. I agree with other reviews that if you just keep on stirring that there will be a point when the nuts are done and there will be no more liquid left. It is very obvious once this change has occured as they go from being glossy to matte finish and look dry.

Super Easy! Just ignore the picture - they do not come out shiny. Like others have said, you stir until ALL liquid is gone (10-15 minutes). At first I thought I had ruined them -  it turned into an ugly gob of goo, but suddenly it crystalized back into sugar - they were perfect. I ended up making a second batch immediately. These remind me very much of the nuts from the fair!

Overall a good recipe.  You get a good taste of the cinnamon, and it makes a sweet snack.  You really have to cook out all the liquid, or else it will turn out almost soggy(that is how I cooked mine.  I won't make that mistake next time.)  It is very easy to make, so I will definitely make this again.

These are great!!!  Simmer the almonds in syrup for about 15 minutes on medium heat.  Just watch it for the last 5 minutes, at that point the liquid may dissolve quickly.  I cooled them on silpat, just work quickly with two forks to separate them.  They always taste better the second day when the almonds are totally cooled and crisp.

Nice and tasty almonds!  The only change I made was to use a 1/2 c of Splenda instead of 1 c of sugar to keep the carbs low.  No matter how much you 'dry' these out, they will remain awfully sticky when put in any container.

I added a touch of butter. They looked shiny while cooking, but once liquid was gone, they are grainy/sugary, and shininess is absent. 

Disappointed the almonds don't taste cooked too.

Although it will seem like the syrup will never dry out, it suddenly does, and you end up with lovely sugar coated almonds.  I added 1/8 tsp. cayenne, and will probably add a little more next time.  The slight hint of spice keeps you going back to the bowl for more.  This is a very good recipe!

This recipe is so good! I added a tsp of vanilla extract and it tasted great. It takes a while before the mixture actually hardens in the pan - you just have to be patient and it will pay off!

Oh, bliss!  I have an absolute thing about candied nuts so finding this recipe was the best surprise of the weekend!  I found all the reviews really helpful.  I would add this - you can tell when all the water is evaporated because the syrup starts getting gritty looking around the edge of the pan first, and then the syrup on the nuts suddenly stops looking all glossy and also starts looking gritty/crystallised.

I think this works better if you bring the sugar mixture to the soft ball stage BEFORE adding the nuts. It is difficult to keep the mixture from burning if the nuts are added too soon. I tried doing this both ways. On my stove using my candy thermometer it took about 8 minutes on medium high heat.

Yummy! Tastes just like the high dollar ones sold at the big sporting goods stores. So glad I read the reviews before making, definately stir until mixture is dry. It will take several minutes but seems to dry completely all at once. Just keep stirring, you'll know when its ready. Enjoy!

Soo easy to make! I used walnuts(trying to use them up).  The process was very easy and I followed the recipe, but used 3 cups of walnuts. I also sprinkled some salt and added vanilla to the mixture, right before all the liquid was evaporated. I am going to get some almonds and make some more cinnamon nuts! Yummy!  UPDATE: Just made almonds and they are delicious! Just like the ones you purchase at fairs or markets! Love this recipe.  I USE 3 CUPS OF NUTS AND IT WORKS PERFECT!

This is a wonderful candied nut recipe. I doubled the batch and dusted half of the almonds with powdered sugar at the end after they were separated. I got rave reviews on both but everyone leaned toward the powdered sugar coated ones saying they were a little sweeter.

Make sure you read the other reviews and let all the liquid evaporate. There is a fine line of when there is none and when there is.... you will know when to take them off. Also... make sure you use Roasted almonds... not blanched (Like I did). They tasted good, but were not crunchy at all.

These are so good. I had old almonds that I could not bring myself to throw out.....so I thought I'd give this recipe a try! So glad I did! It does take forever to make it look like dry sugar but they turn out so well the stirring is worth it.  I did add a cap full of vanilla to water/sugar when I started. Thank you so much for this!

Excellent and so easy.  I skipped the cinnamon and cooked the water/sugar syrup until 238 degrees, added 3 cups of nuts, and stirred until they were powdered white in color.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  These type of candied nuts sell for $5 for just a few ounces at my local store.

I used this recipe with walnuts.  At the same time I tried "Dawn's Candied Walnuts" and used almonds.  "Dawn's" won hands down for flavor!  (in my opinion and my son's).  I would not make this recipe again.

These are great! I did add a touch of vanilla extract and nutmeg. It took about 45 minutes for the liquid to evaporate which was a lot longer than expected.

Great recipie, very easy to make. I love to make several batches and package them up as gifts for people, everyone loves them! However, I have learned to not try to make a double batch, it takes about three times as long to cook.

I have been looking for a recipe similar to the candied nuts you can buy from a street vendor in New York city. This is it!! They are absloutely fabulous and simple. My fmily is not crazy about cinnamon so I only used a sprinkle. I was worried since I took out most of the cinnamon I put in a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Be patient and let all of the liquid evaporate. You will know when that is. Do not try and rush it. There was some sugar coating left so I think I will try and add at least another 1/2 cup of nuts to the ingredients.I also added cashews and walnuts. All were good. You wont be sorry these are delish!

Turn out great and are very easy to make. I added dries cranberry and coconut. And after I spread them out I added sea salt and milk chocolate chips. You can get very creative with this recipe.

These are outstanding.  Definitely make sure you cook them until they are dry, as other reviews state.  I was standing there worried I wouldn't know what they meant by "dry" but I definitely did.  Watch them carefully, the time between "sticky" and "dry" changed VERY quickly.  I did them with pecans (my fav!) and they were awesome.

If you are looking for something very easy and yummy look no further. These are so good!! I hate it when people change the recipe but the only thing i would recommend would be to toast the almonds lightly before coating them. That will give them more of a crunch.

This was surprisingly easy to make and I am *so* grateful for all of the readers' comments -- thanks for the tips, everybody! Yes, it is easy to get nervous near the end of the cooking stage, but definitely wait until the sauce *completely* evaporates in the pan and crystalizes onto the almonds. And that's when you know they're done! The sauce will transform from liquid to syrup to stringy to ready. Next time, I will follow someone else's tip to bake the almonds first (8min at 400) for that extra crunch.

I had a bag of almonds that I found in the pantry and really craved a sweet snack. I remembered saving this recipe, so I tried it.I added a bit of salt to make it salty sweet. Lets just say I only got to eat a handful. The family gobbled up the rest in no time flat.So easy to make and so good.

Good alternative to plain old nutss.  I followed the directions exactly but still cae out with a too soupy syrup.  Even after cooling the nuts remained too stickey.  Liked the flavor although would have prefered less cinnamon.  Won't make this one again

I found these to be dry and too clumped together.  Maybe I cooked them too long, but I got it out of the pan pretty fast, but not fast enough. I found it very disappointing.

Just made a batch.  Did just as written, but added 2.5 cups of pecans halfs and prob could have added a little more.  Will be making this a lot.  Easy just keeping boiling until everything evaporated.

I was hoping these would be like the almonds they sell at Octoberfest, but they're not quite right.  They taste good, but the sugar coating isn't as thick, and the almonds aren't as crunchy.  I guess I'll keep looking.

I sure wouldn't consider this "foolproof"! Even after multiple tries and trying things out in different ways, I never got the same kind of candied/Bavarian almond that's often found at fairs and festivals. However, I did get delicious sugary and cinnamony almonds with a teeny bit of crunch. However, overall they are still soggy, even after roasting out all of the liquid. (I was left with lots of little bits of crystallizing, and not much crystallizing on the actual almonds.) Any suggestions??

These were great!  I used pecans and the only problem I ran into was that I passed through each "stage" too quickly (liquid/syrup/crystalized) and what I thought was the syrup stage was actually the coating melting off the nuts and the nuts burning.  It only took about 5-10 minutes from start to finish.  I had my burner on medium so am confused as to why this happened.  Not sure if pecans have more oil or something in them to cook so much quicker but it is something to note when trying different nuts.  I have bought some almonds since then and will try again looking to see if I run into this problem again.

This is not what I was looking for, I expected the coating to be heavier and more crispy, sorta like the style of nuts you buy in NY at the street vendors, I think I found the recipe under cinnamon  roasted almonds. I will never try this style again, sorry

I liked that it was easy, but I had a hard time with the instructions because I wasn't sure exactly when it was completely done. It said to leave a little syrupy coating, but mine didn't turn out like I would have liked with it that way. I read one of the reviews that said to make sure ALL the moisture has boiled out, but mine started to smell burnt, so I turned it off and hoped it was done. I'm afraid it really would have burned on me if I kept cooking it, even turned down. If the picture included with this recipe is what it actually is supposed to look like, mine do NOT look close to that. I decided to get some cinnamon sugar and toss the nuts in a bag with it to coat it a little bit. I'm sure it is wonderful when done correctly, but didn't turn out as well as I would have liked. I also felt like they cooked so much that the nuts are soft rather than crispy. Maybe I'll try it again, but at a lower temp. :-/

These were amazing. The trick really is to keep stirring and waiting it out until the liquid evaporates. It really does work if done correctly. They were a hit at our Christmas parties. :) Thanks!!!

I was still stirring after an hour and now the almonds smell burnt. There is still liquid with the almonds. They now look like black, greasy jelly beans and smell terrible.

I don't know if this recipe was meant for a higher altitude or what, but I tried this recipe twice and it failed. note that this was after using another recipe my first time and having it turn out perfect, but I lost it. I think the problem is that this recipe calls for too much water. The sugar syrup will start to burn before enough water evaporates to candy the nuts. Water evaporates different at different altitudes so maybe this is  just a problem at sea level.

Very easy and tastes like what you buy at the fair! One point I would make, is that, just as a previous review had stated, mine suddenly began to turn back into a sugary powder, at which point, I immediately took it off the heat and dumped them onto my cookie sheet. They did not stick together, or to the sheet (which by the way, I used parchment paper instead of wax paper.) The magic moment of thickening is QUICK. Try this recipe, just find that critical moment between final thickening and sudden powdering. LOL! Good recipe!

I just finished up a double batch.  My almonds were already toasted so I boiled the sugar syrup down, tested it on the wax paper to make sure it would "set" and then I added my almonds.  The mix went from syrup to sugar nuts in about 30 seconds!

I poured the nuts onto the wax paper and separated them apart with forks as much as I could but as soon as the nuts were cool enough to handle I broke the remaining clumps up with my hands. *Do NOT touch the nuts when they are hot!!* This is going to be a Christmas gift to a few lucky people!

Pretty good, something different. I halved the recipe and added 1/8 tsp ground chipolte powder. If I was to try this recipe again, I'd definitely add a bit more chipolte powder, maybe 1/4 tsp. Any heat that was there was outweighed by the cinnamon sugar. And WOW are these nuts SWEET!! But I guess that's what you get with candied almonds haha. I was looking for a recipe more close to what an old family friend referred to as "Vodka Nuts" Unfortunately, this recipe wasn't similar enough so the quest continues. I also sprinkled a little salt on the nuts after I separated them. I let the syrup reduce down as much as possible before adding the almonds. I think this really helped the almonds from getting soggy. As others have posted, it is so important that you reduce the syrup as much as possible or you will end up with mushy almonds. I boiled down the syrup and almond mixture until the sugar started searing to the pan and that seemed to be the perfect time to remove them from the heat. Separating the almonds on the wax paper was very easy and made clean up easy. All and all this recipe is very versatile and forgiving so I think it is worth the try :)

DEEELicious!! I made 1/2 of the original recipe first and they were perfect! I have never had success with the oven roasted cinnamon/sugar ones and this was easy and the way to go! I did another batch with 1 cup of nuts (3/4 walnut, 1/4 almond) and 1/3 cup of sugar and they still came out amazing.

Perfect, just like you'd buy from a vendor.  Like the others said, cook until liquid is gone.  Took about 5 mins. for it to be sticky and done.  AWESOME!

Great recipe and very easy, even for me, because I don't often cook with sugar. Keep stirring until the sugar crystallizes - don't stop too soon, otherwise the almonds will be sticky. I tested a few through the process to make sure I was on track. I added a tsp of ginger for a little zip (I love ginger) and put them on tin foil to cool. Thanks for the recipe!

These were delicious but when I followed the recipe, I had a gooey mess.  I let them cool/dry all night and still had goo in the pan so I put them in the oven at 250 degrees for around 1 hour and they came out wonderful!  They had a crispy, cinna mon sugar coating.

These are pretty tasty.   But it should be noted in your directions the different stages the mixture will go through before the almonds become caramelize. (thanks kerimac) I took mine out to earlier and had to put them back in the pot.  I have never made candy, so its not something I would know. But it was a very good recipe!

Very good recipe--make sure if using natural almonds to roast before putting in the sugar mixture, and cook until the sugar mixture evaporates as explained in the other reviews.

These are great. Minus one start for the instructions. These should be cooked until the liquid has begun to crystallize...not syrup-like coating like the instructions indicate. I also add a little vanilla and I don't always measure the ingredients, I just eyeball it and it always turns out.

Well this was my first attempt at candied anything, I found very easy to follow , I cooked it down until there was no liquid. It turned out perfect infact I cannot wait to try different nuts. My sister in law is getting married soon I think I am going to make some for the shower.  Thanks for the recipe

I added half a tablespoon of cumin and some black pepper to give it a kick. I stirred the almonds until the syrup was gone and there was only crystallized sugar/cinnamon left. If you don't do that, it won't turn out the way it's supposed to.  Needless to say, this was a hit with my fiance and all my friends. I've been ordered to make more!

These are wonderful. The instructions are easy to follow, it does take a while to cook the liquid off, so be patient. The results are well worth the effort. The house smells great afterwards too.

This is the best recipe ever.  They taste exactly like the ones we get in the mall.  Just make sure to cook them just until they barely turn sugary and they turn out perfect.

This is the 2nd recipe in as many days for the candied cinnamon almonds - this one has much better flavor but I need to perfect my methods.  I wasn't ever sure when the right time to stop stirring was, but once cooled, the nuts formed kind-of a almond brittle in the pan.  So now I am going through and breaking them up.  I would also spray the waxed paper next time since the nuts and coating stuck to the paper.  I may try this one again because the taste is great!  My son and husband were eating them warm from the pan!

My family loved this special treat!  Make sure to roast your nuts first as otherwise they come out slightly mushy to the tooth.  I like the carnival type and once I tried it after roasting the nuts first, it was perfect!

Wonderful to be able to recreate the same snack that I love at our local Autumn Festival. I doubled the recipe ingredients but loaded up to 2 lbs of almonds (vs 4 cups). Set a timer for 20-25 minutes and keep stirring until water evaporates and almonds lose their shine. This will dry out the almonds and make them crunchy. Great recipe!

Tasted good but they were not crisp enough.  I cooked them until all the moisture was gone. I will try another recipe, called "Cinnamon Roasted Almonds" as suggested by a reviewer. Maybe they will be crisper because they are baked.

To the commenter who gave this one star because it won’t work with splenda or stevia- no. It won’t. That’s why it calls for sugar. If you want it to work with stevia, or monk sweetener (I don’t know about splenda), you’d likely have to make a simple syrup first and add a pinch of guar gum to thicken it. I’m going to try this with monk sweetener maple syrup!
The recipe is classic and delicious. 
Don’t give a recipe one star because your substitution didn’t work. That’s a misrepresentation.

Easy recipe and loved by everyone who tried it! As recommended, I roasted the almonds at 400 degrees for 15 minutes beforehand and allowed to cool to remove their moisture. I also 6added a pinch of sea salt to the sugar and sprinkled a pinch over the to of the nuts after they were spread and cooling. Delicious!

These are very tasty!. I added about 1/4 brown sugar  a teaspoon of nutmeg, and pumpkin spice. One tip i will give is once you see the sides of the sauce pan started to crystallize, give it 2 minutes and pull from the stove and put on the wax paper.

I made it with pecans.  It would be fine if you included 2 1/2 to possible 3 cups of nuts with the recipie.  Otherwise it was close to the nuts that I sampled at the German Kris Kringle Fair in Chicago last week.

Great recipe! I also added about a Tsp of vanilla extract and a couple shakes of pumpkin pie spice and a dash of salt. I toasted my almonds in a preheated 350 degree oven for 12-15 minutes. I would suggest using either parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.

To anyone looking for the almonds they serve in Disney World...these are as close as you will ever get.  I did as another recommended and put them in the oven for about 8 minutes after I finished them on the stove.  Great!

Disappointed.  Yes you definitely have to cook the syrup down but I think this needs a savory flavor to go along with it, say some sea salt?

Was thinking about the nuts at Disney and craving them. Ended up on this recipe via Google. I am SO glad I did. I had all the ingredients for two kinds of nuts in my pantry so I did almonds and peanut. Both turned out delicious. I'm thankful I read the reviews because I wasn't sure how dry to get them. I did what the recommendations in the comment sections stated and they turned out fantastic. I can't wait for my husband to get home because these are his favorite and I think I outdid Disney on these. :) Thank you for sharing this amazingly simple and tasty recipe.

These were delicious! I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and added 1/4 tbs of nutmeg.

The best recipe for candied almonds.  My only suggestions are to use either parchment paper or grease a pan it will be easier to break them apart.  If you use wax paper put in the microwave to loosen from it.  Enjoy

This recipe is simple and easy but gets difficult when it gets to the end. Everything is well explained but once you get the the water being all gone if you don't get it out of the pan at the right time, good luck getting them out at all.

After reading other reviews I was nervous about making sure ALL the liquid was gone...& in the process my candied almonds taste burnt. :( SO- make sure you lower the heat to med low AND get them out of the pan as soon as the liquid is absorbed- the almonds will be covered in a pasty, chunky 'gunk' (it's more delicious then it sounds!) w/ no 'liquid' in the pan but the gunk is still moist. The gunky coating is pretty thick so next time I'm going to use 3 cups of almonds & add cayenne to the mixture.

These almonds are fantastic. I read the hints about cooking and stirring the liquid until it become dry. And that worked. Except I had a very few spots that still looked wet so I thought a little more time would work. Just the opposite happened. They became wet all over again and carmelized into a brittle mess. So, when 95% of the mix is dry just spoon it on the wax paper and it will be amazing. Hope that will help you make this wonderful Holiday gift idea!

SUCH a hit!  Just like the ones you get at a fair or fall football game.  The advice from all the reviews was crucial!  I definitely thought I did it wrong when I was making it, but here are some things I learned:
- use roasted nuts, rather than raw nuts. Raw nuts are good too, but roasted gives more crunch in your end product. 
- stir until all the liquid is gone. This means all the "goo" is gone. The sugar will begin to get REALLY hard to stir, then will become powdery again, and That's when the liquid is gone. 
- stir vigorously towards the end. It might take a while
- don't make more than double the recipe at once. It becomes SO HARD to stir and will take forever to make. 
- add some other spices to it. I think I added cloves and pumpkin pie spice. Yum!
- use a sifter and dust powdered sugar over the nuts when they are cooling on the cookie sheet. Gives a sweeter kick.

Ok, so the first time i did this recipe i followed the directions and the amounts exactly and it turned out great!  The second time i did it i wanted to make a big batch since i liked it so much and hand it out for the holidays. I quadrupled the recipe and it did NOT turn out.  The sugar never crystallized.  Anybody have any ideas on what happened?

LOVE LOVE LOVE these! I did as suggested by a couple of others and made sure the liquid was gone and boy oh boy does it go quickly when it does! I also added a splash of vanilla and used brown sugar to get the molasses taste. Will do it this way again. I think I will be adding this to our Christmas gift giving. :) Thanks so much for sharing! This was perfect!

Reading the other reviews really helped me but also scared me at the same time. I read some that said the sugar burnt even with constant stirring. The main thing is to wait until all the liquid is gone and the sugar has crystallized. Constantly stir! Once you have reached the thick gooey syrup like consistency within minutes it crystallizes. It was my first time making these and they came out great!

Fantastic simple recipe...

My favorite version of this is to use almond slivers with none of the dark shell.   I stir over high, then medium heat not only until all the liquid is dry but until it toasts the almonds with a golden brown color.  THEN I serve these over a dollop of home made vanilla whipped cream on top of an almond creme brulee.    Delicious crunch that really elevates a variety of desserts as a topping or garnish.

Turned out fantastic. I also read all of the reviews and it helped with the "coating" process.  I also added nutmeg and cloves, it made my kitchen smell like autumn!

I needed a quick hostess gift for a dinner party. I recommend roasting the almonds first so they will be crunchy.  I put mine in the oven @ 350 for about 8-10 minutes and put them in the freezer (5 min or less) to let them cool before starting the sugar mixture.  I started the sugar mixture and let it cook till the cool ball stage as another reviewer suggested. After I added 3 Cups of nuts, I reduced the temperature and kept it between medium and simmer. To check the cooking time, I'd pull a nut out every few minutes and place it on parchment paper. Once a nut held the glaze when slightly cooled, I shut off the heat and kept stirring until all the syrup was gone. Then I poured them out on parchment paper and lightly broke them up with a wooden spoon.  I put the cooled product in a Ball Jar, tied it with a ribbon and I'm set for my party.

You must cook until the sauce literally turns to dry crumbs that coat the almonds.  It will happen, be patient!  Also, I used natural almonds, but they turned out a little soft (although the coating was nice and crunchy).  I think I will try roasted almonds next time and add more spices.

I used Sugar in the Raw for this recipe and loved it. Per the photo, you shouldn't stop when there is a syrupy coating on the almonds - stop when the coating turns crumbly. It still sticks to the almonds, but not to your fingers. We used the nuts as well as the extra crumbles on the bottom to top vanilla ice cream and it was divine.

Great recipe...One suggestion...I would recommend heating the surface that your pouring your mixture on to. If the surface is cold you will flash cool your mixture causing a clump. By heating or warming your receiving surface you give yourself time to separate the nuts. I also added 2 tablespoons of vanilla and a cup of brown sugar....Just my two cents.  - Comptonsrule

Yay!  wish I had read the reviews before my first effort at this a couple weeks ago -- you ain't kidding "until liquid evaporates!"
It worked! (this time)
For fun I added a pinch of salt and cayenne in a half batch to see if I could give it a little kick -- not quite enough to distinguish the cayenne, but I'll keep trying!

These are JUST what I wanted!! (preggo craving!) Only thing extra I did was add 2 tsp of vanilla! You MUST stir and cook for close to 30 min to get the texture you are looking for...all the liquid has to be gone..which I did and they were perfect! Love them! I'll be making these a LOT!!

This recipe is great if you have 2 lbs of almonds sitting around like i did! I'm glad i read the reviews though, I waited until the mixture start to chunk onto the almonds. Which was about 20 mins of stirring. Taste much like those you find on the street on NYC! I also liked the idea of one review to use during holidays with a tin! WIll try this yr!

Used Dererara Cane Sugar and added a little Cayenne Pepper in addition to the Cinnamon.  YUM!  Recipe worked perfectly as prescripted.  Only recco; let the candied almonds rest for a couple of ours, after the fork-separation step, before packaging to maintain crispness.

This recipe is soooo easy!!  From the boiling stage to the end it only took 9 minutes.  The moisture evaporates very quickly, so stir constantly and watch the pot.  I added ground ginger and cloves and a little vanilla.  It was very good.

I made it with walnuts and took it to Thanksgiving dinner. It was a big hit so I made a lot more for Christmas and put it in little plastic goodie bags for work gifts.
It  takes longer than the recipe seems to indicate.  It said medium heat and stir constantly.  I finally got so tired of stirring I turned up the heat and only stirred every 30 seconds or so, and then things moved along nicely.  I knew better the second time.

Super easy. I made with almonds, pecans and walnuts.  Needs more spice for my taste. May make again and add some cayenne for a touch of heat or large flake sea salt At the end for a salty sweet treat.

Taste the almonds first, I used some leftover almonds mixed in with new. The bitter taste and the absorbed moisture can throw off the taste.  For moisture, I recommend baking them first in the oven 165° for  30 mins. I had to do it after I candied them and they still turned out fine. The bitterness is still bumming me out. Otherwise, they are good. BTW , I nearly blinked and the stingy candy turned to dry. I also lowered the heat the closer they came to finishing as not to burn.

I was very cautious after reading reviews ...
I toasted my almonds first
I cooked the mixture without almonds a bit just below medium heat (I added vanilla and 1/8 tsp cayenne) then took hot almonds and dumped in 
I kept stirring and at about 10-15 min things really thickened up, I watched for the gooeyness to be almost gone and the sugar to begin crystalizing around the pan edge.
I lifted the pan from heat and stirred a bit more, things crystalized rapidly even more and I dumped the contents onto a parchment lined baking sheet.  Perfect!

I've made this several times, but with a few changes. I just use this as my guidebook. 
1- I use fresh squeezed OJ (pulp stained out) instead of water
2- I use only 1/2 Tbsp cinnamon
3- I use 4 cups raw almonds

Works great, tastes great!

Did it via volume and used a somewhat smaller pot. the amount of almonds I used I weighed by hand to be more 1:1 to the sugar. Doing it this way produces far to much sugar mixture for the amount of nuts so go by weight. The smaller pot vs using a big pan with low sides made the water boil out much more quickly. 

despite my own mistakes and flaws the finish product was pretty delicious though a little too sweet. for the first time trying something like this it still turned out worth it. 

Unlike the first sacrificial pancake even if you mess up these should be good. Just be sure to get them off the heat when the sugar is recrystallized. 

the clean up wasn't nearly as bad as it looked either. rinse, scrub with water/soap and then soak the stubborn remainder.

Because of the helpful hints they turned out perfect.

I used 1 cup of Erythritol to replace the sugar but I didn’t have enough to make it equal to the same amount of sugar. I didn’t let it get as thick as desired?? bc it wasn’t  thickening up but was burning so I took the almonds out n put them on a aluminum foil to cool added some sugar n cinnamon mix that I already own on top. I also put a dash of vanilla in it. Nonetheless, They taste like toasted almonds

So good and so easy!  Glad I read the reviews about waiting until all the liquid evaporates.  Used brown sugar instead of white since I didn't have any white sugar and they were delicious.  I also just dusted them at the end with cinnamon.    Will make again for holiday events.  I took these to an Octoberfest party since I read these are common in Germany this time of year.  They were a hit.

Our family visits Sight and Sound Theaters in Lancaster where they sell candied almonds and I buy bags of them to take home. They’re addicting! Now, I can actually make them myself! Game changer!!  This recipe is super simple which makes it a keeper. Definitely wait until the liquid dries up. Just do it. You may feel like the end is never in sight while you’re stirring, but they will dry up - about 10 plus minutes of stirring. By the end you will see crumbs that look like brown sugar in the pan. The almonds soften nicely in the given amount of time. Perfect for Christmas gifts or anytime sweets! I made half a batch and stored in an airtight container. Next time I will definitely make more.

I have been looking for a copy cat recipe for so long. These are just as good as those being sold at the carnival.  Be sure to let ALL the liquid evaporate before you remove them from the pan.  I would add a pinch of salt the next time I make these (tomorrow), but otherwise they are perfect.

I add 3 tbl vanilla and half the cinnamon and use  brown sugar..   Also don't drop them onto waxed paper to cool.  They will just melt the wax.   I let mine cool in the skillet.  They break up easily enough with a plastic spatula when cool.

I used slivered almonds and the sugary syrup got hard sooner than I expected.  Next time, I’ll get the nuts out of the pan as soon as they are well coated.

Super easy! Keep cooking...keep stirring. You’ll think the goo will never go away and BOOM! It will suddenly be dry. Trust us on this one. You’ll instantly know when it’s ready. Another good stir or two and most of the almonds will separate. This is a nice addition to Christmas and it reminds me of the European Christmas markets!

The first time I made it ... perfection. I made it the next day to add to Christmas gifts and ended up with a smoky kitchen and black tar with almonds in it.  I made it the same way but obviously something happened.  So disappointed.  Will go to something else for the gifts.

I made these.  So good.  I put butter around the top two inches of my pan. Stops sugar from getting around the top of the pan.   Really useful when making caramels. 
Just an old trick.

I couldn't get it to the dry granular stage.
When it started smoking I decided to cut bait: I spooned the almonds on to parchment and spread them as "individually" as I could.
The almonds are well coated with a glossy sugar shell which is okay, but not what I wanted. 
I won't try again.

These were so easy and delicious.  I followed a couple of previous recommendations and added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper to the pot.  Also, once I poured them out on waxed paper and they started to cool, I transferred them to a foil lined baking sheet and put them in the oven for 8 minutes on 350 degrees to get them crunchier on the inside.  Delish!!

These almonds are great! Follow the instructions in the reviews for getting them to be the crispy fair-like and not goopy weird almonds. Just keep stirring until the sugar mixture looks like sugar again.

Super easy. At first I didn't think they were going to turn out the same as theme parks and stadium candied nuts  but as soon as they were dumped onto the cookie sheet they crisped right up. No more spending a fortune for a tiny bag. I can't wait to try pecans and walnuts!

Great!! Was glad to see the added instructions on the stages it cooks. I think I would have stopped as soon as the syrup stage hit, but continued and could see all the additional stages.  These are really good!! Will make again and in bigger quantity!

I love this recipe so much. It's my favorite, reminds me of a carnival.  The trick is, like everyone says, all the water MUST evaporate. Dont be afraid to let all the water evaporate. The first time I made this I let it boil until there was no liquid. Just super sticky syrup, and I thought I burnt it, even smelled a little funny. BUT it was not burnt, they taste amazing recommend this for every one.

Excellent recipe! Be sure to use good technique and these will come out perfect. After bringing the liquid to a boil, add the almonds and don't stop stirring until the liquid goes from watery, to glaze-like, to crystallized and not shiny. Immediately remove them to cool, don't burn the sugar!

I maintained medium-high heat through the candying process.

I used almond, cashews, pecans, and walnuts (2 cups all together). Used 3/ 4 cups of white sugar, and 1/4 brown sugar, and then added the cinnamon to my mixture. Came out good, though I find it hard to seperate them and make them look really appetizing on the wax paper when they are finished. Maybe I boiled too long, will try shorter boiling time next time. Still delicious.

I made 1/2 of this recipe just to give it a try...
OMG!, this SO GOOD!!!
Follow the directions, lower the heat &  be patient 
It will turn in AWESOME!
When it was done, I'd just put it in a baking sheet, and spreat it all over, no need of wax paper or separate with nothing, just spread it while is hot.
It was so good, that I'd just took time to clean my pan and do it again in full amounts of ingredients as the recipe requires.
Once again it was a hit!!!
I'll get tomorrow some walnuts & macadamia to give it a try.
Keep experimenting doing new things & share your experiences that helps everybody.  :-)

I used brown sugar instead of white because it makes a better syrup as well as having a better flavor. I cook it on medium so it doesn't stick to the bottom. It takes longer but the "candy" syrup is a better quality than when it is cooked more quickly. It also doesn't need to be stirred constantly.

These turned out very good! It did NOT take 30 min to cook, more like 10. I used a heavy bottomed pan. I did stir continuously. I was reading something while I was stirring, because I thought it was going to take 30 min, like a reviewer said. When I looked at them after 10 minutes, I was surprised that it was totally dry. Some almonds, like 5 of them out of 2 cups, were shiny, but still dry. I think next time I will stop cooking when shiny. They looked better. I spread out on a silicone mat on the counter. My husband couldn't stop eating them, and they were to be gift for someone.

It turned out great taste delicious and advice just keep mixing it will eventually evaporate and candie I lowered the temperature the closer I got to the end so it didn't burn and I get real hard to stir when you're just about done so when It gets really hard to stir you're on the homestretch

I made this and I think I did it correctly. I was wondering if I used the correct almonds? Unsalted roasted whole almonds are the ones I used. If I was supposed to use raw almonds it would have been nice to know. Warm they are not as crunchy as you would get at the mall. But maybe that's the type of almond I used. The key to this is to constantly stir stir stir!they are still delicious!!!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated the first time, and I did not like the texture of the almonds. They need to be roasted beforehand, and they don't need to cook in the sugar mixture the entire time. The second I time made these, I roasted my almonds on an ungreased cookie sheet 10 minutes at 350 degrees. While they were roasting, I simmered the sugar coating. Once it reduced and  got syrupy, I added the roasted almonds and continued to stir.  After 2 or 3 minutes, the wetness was gone, and I dumped the almonds onto parchment paper and separated. The almonds themselves had a crunch this time. Perfect!

i tried this but the whole syrupy mess smoked terribly, it wasn't anywhere close to crystallising and instead all the syrup was burnt to a black char. i spent more than an hour scrubbing to get the layer of burnt char off. Quite sad and a total waste of my almonds.

My go to base recipe! I do 2 cups almonds and 1 cup walnuts (or whatever I have on hand) for the same amount of sugar syrup. I heap the cinnamon and I add about 1.5 - 2 tablespoons corn syrup which helps the sugar mixture stuck to the nuts. I stir until all the moisture is absorbed.

Great recipe.  I cooked the sugar/water combo down until it started to thicken, then I added the nuts and cooked until the nuts no longer looked shiny.  Once they looked dry and crumbly, they were done.

It's very good....what I hoped for..  Except I used raw almonds and they are not as crispy as I wanted. Next time I will use toasted almonds.....Otherwise ...perfect.  I tossed a few macadamias in and they are also great... Thanks

Great recipe.  I tried almonds, walnuts and pecans.  Although I baked them all to bring out the flavor and "crisp" them, only the almonds were truly crisp.  The others tasted great but I liked the texture of the almonds best. I added 1tsp vanilla and 1tsp cinnamon.  I mixed half brown and half white sugar.  I'm going to make some more almonds for the holidays!

I blanched my almonds first and they came out perfectly. No more buying expensive candied nuts for me. Once all the liquid cooks out and it's just a syrup coating it crystallizes once it hits the cold wax paper. You can sprinkle some kosher salt over them to for salty and sweet.

The only thing keeping me from rating this as a 5 star recipe for ease and taste is that I felt the almonds themselves were not roasted and crisp enough in the finished product. I used raw almonds (which i'm assuming most if not all cooks are doing) and think that they should be lightly roasted in the oven for 10 minutes prior to cooking in the sugar coating.

I'm glad I read the reviews you really do have to cook until all the liquid is out it was crazy it took me about 15 minutes one minute the liquid is there the next it was gone. I did add a teaspoon and a half of vanilla extract to it and I made him even more delectable! Amazing!

I likes the simplicity of the recipe. I add in a packet of vanilla sugar. I think that the recipe needs to be altered so people are aware that the water evaporates and then sugar turns to powder and after additional cooking the sugar will become wet again to coat the almonds. I have never used wax paper. I use parchment so they don't stick

These were excellent. Just like the ones I always want to buy at the fall fairs, but can never justify in cost. So ridiculously easy, just need to keep stirring till liquid is gone and the nuts lose their glossy coating.

I used a mix of almonds and pecans and added a bit of salt to cut through all the sweetness and really pop the cinnamon flavor. They turned out good but next time I will toast the nuts first to give more of a crunch to the treat.

Like all the other reviews, continue stirring until the  liquid completely evaporates! It will first become sticky and gooey and in maybe another 10 minutes of stirring, it just becomes a drier coating on the almonds, at which point you transfer to wax paper. Watch them closely because when that liquid is gone it is easy to burn the sugar coating!

I added 2 tsp. vanilla and Flavor God pumpkin pie spice.  I made it exactly what the recipe says. I kept the heat on medium and when the syrup started to disappear I lowered the heat a little bit more. But like I read in previous comments the syrup all the sudden is gone and quickly you have dry cinnamon sugar again. As soon as I seen the liquid turn to dry sugar I turned off the heat and continued to stir until all the liquid turned to dry sugar. When I put them in a bowl for storage I added some of the extra dry sugar that was left over in the pan.  Then I tossed the almonds with it and that gave them more flavor. 
When the almonds completely cool they get a better texture and Flavor although if your looking for the roasted almond texture they do not have it.

I was hesitant about making these since I usually toast my almonds in the oven, they are AMAZING!!! I made them to surprise my significant other...but may end up eating all of them by myself :)

A tip...I added  paprika and salt to balance the sweet. Also...it does take a while to cook up, keep staring so it cooks evenly, and don't stop till your pan is totally dry, and your nuts look sandy.

This recipe is so easy to make. I substituted coconut sugar and they they were delicious. Family loved them. Tried with Xylitol as well, and although the flavor was really good, it was gooey.

Made only slight change. I let the water, sugar and cinnamon cook to 230 degrees before adding nuts then stirred until they all came together. Delicious. Look just like the picture, super easy. Made these for my sons Spanish III  class.

I love, love, love this recipe ! I hate having to wait until the holidays or find a place that makes this now I can enjoy them anytime I want! It didn't take long at all. Caution because of the heated sugar, this gets extremely hot.

I used 3 cups of nuts...could have used even more, plenty of coating here.  Added extra spices, allspice, cloves, & nutmeg.
Delish!

Delicious and quick to make. I have not seen any recipe specify roasted nuts but they have to be or they are not good. I was given a tin of whole natural almonds, which I roasted for about 10 min. This was not enough to keep the almonds from being chewy. I will only use roasted in the future. The syrup mixture goes from stringy to dry in seconds and that's when you know it's done. I didn't need to separate with forks. They came out of the pan separate.

Just keep stirring until the almond goop turns dry and starts to toast.  

If you put the almonds on the wax paper and it still has the gooey carmalized sugar and the almonds are shiny, you've removed them from the pan too soon. Easy fix would be to put the sheet of almonds on a metal cooking sheet and heat them up and then place back in the pan with a tablespoon of water and continue your stirring to get them to the dry state.

mmmm smells so good and makes your house smell like the holidays.

Great recipe and I agree that you need to wait for all the liquid to absorb. Something I didn't think of at the time was not to use plastic utensils. One melted spoon later - lesson learned. Oops.

Followed directions to the letter.   Cooked until they became coated with a dull sugar coating.  They turned out onto the waxed paper perfectly, all separated.   If this recipe didn't turn out for you, you did something wrong.  My guess would be undercooked.  It cannot look like there is any liquid left, syrup or otherwise.   They will be loose, separate nuts, coated with cinnamon sugar, if done right.  Please try again, they are so worth it.   I would hate to think anyone missed this one.

I made these for a party and they were definitely easy. I used roasted unsalted almonds and I waited until everything started to crystalize before removing them from the stove, but they still weren't as crunchy as I had hoped for. They do taste great though!

I have a recipe that I make in the oven and it is so time consuming.  I was so happy to find this method!!!  It works wonderfully but follow the ad given...keep going until the last drop of water has evaporated! (take it off the heat) I followed this recipe exactly!

Others have said it and I will repeat. Read some of the reviewers. It will help. My first batch was a complete flop. Had to throw it all away because i stopped cooking when it got stringy. The next three however were amazing!  Once you add the nuts, you will end up cooking it longer than you think you should. It will get syrupy and then stringy.  Keep stiring and reduce the heat. I kept reducing the heat until they were almost done. Ended up at medium low to low by the very end. Don't walk away from the stove. You cannt stop stirring in the last few minutes. You know it is done when it completely drys out. It will end up powdery/crystallized. 

They taste GREAT but the aroma in the house is the best.

IMPORTANT -->  Stir very frequently and wait for all liquid to evaporate! It takes awhile, but it happens very suddenly so keep a close eye on the pan. Be patient. Trust me, you will know when the liquid is gone so don't second guess yourself because it's taking too long. Have the wax paper ready because the mixture hardens quickly. After I dumped the almonds onto the wax paper, I used two forks to quickly break them all apart and it seemed to work excellent for me. Enjoy!

Turned out great! Stir a lot, you'll see when they are done, no liquid and will look like the picture I posted in the pot. Total time after brining to a boil was 10 minutes. Can't wait to try this with other nuts.

First I tried making these without reading the reviews.... I ended up with a sticky syruppy mess..... I put the nuts back in the pan and kept cooking until literally all the liquid and stringy-ness is gone. They should look dry when they are done. It takes awhile.... but just keep stirring until they are dry. I am using these in a pear arugala sald with chedder, YUM!

OMG! They taste just like the ones at the fair! I used Dry Roasted - Unsalted Almonds and Organic Sugar, both  from Trader Joe's and Fresh&Easy ground cinnamon(it's what I had in the pantry). I'm glad I read the reviews to let the water evaporate. That's a great tip!

I used Splenda instead of sugar. Sometimes that works out fine, but is just so so in this case. I'm not sure if I cooked it long enough. I'll try again later.

This is a great recipe, very easy, just let all the liquid evaporate as instructed. Now, the comment on the Splenda version was mostly wrong. I say mostly because there is a trick to it. After boiling until all of the liquid is gone, spread on a cookie sheet with parchment paper and put in a 350 degree oven for 25 minutes. Its done. This dries the nuts out so that the coating can harden up. They are great. Not quite as good as the real sugar version but much healthier. Also, try the original recipe with pecans and put them over a good brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate/caramel syrup. The nuts add flavor and texture that really makes an outstanding desert.

I did it with walnuts and didn't cook it quite long enough but they were still pretty good!  Today I used pecans, a tiny bit less water and sugar and cinnamon and added a pinch of ginger!  Awesome!  ( I was doubling the recipe and that's why I cut back a bit).  Thanks for this easy wonderful recipe!! It is important to cook them till almost ALL liquid is gone.

Would have been delicious if I had not followed one user that said to cook for 30 mins. DO NOT DO THIS. It will burn them. Just cook until there is no liquid. If you cook too long it will get soupy and burn the almonds. Would have been delicious if not for burnt almonds. :(

So delicious!  Follow the other reviews, cook until ALL water has evaporated! The recipe made me think I had to take it off sooner.  I waited though and it became a thick syrup and when the almonds started clumping together, rather than settling right away into the pan like when it was soupy, I knew it was done.  BIG HIT!! Very easy, will make again.

I think I would roast the almonds next time, prior to putting them in the pot with the sugar.  This would bring more flavor and a better crunch.  Maybe I would even broil them for a minute or two after they have the sugar coating to provide extra crunch too.  Either way, delicious!

Just finished making these and they turned out perfect! So glad I read the reviews about making sure all the liquid is gone! So good.

I added 1additional cup of almonds. For me that was plenty enough sugar to almond ratio. Soooo easy and one not too many people make it seems.  Yummy

So delicious! Best recipe I could find for candied nuts. I have used this recipe to make other nuts as well. Also brewed blueberry blacktea and used that for the 1/2 cup water, added a dash of vanilla and cut back the cinnamon to 1/2 TBSP - turned out yummy! Great to make before having people over to the house - really warms up the house with a delcious aroma. I also toasted my nuts in the oven as other people suggested. I like the nuts to be a little crunchy otherwise I found them to be too soft.

I loved this!  I made them with almonds and walnuts at the same time, delicious!  Instead of letting them cool on wax paper, I put them on parchment paper.  It worked great!  I also tried to use brown sugar, (due to my lack of white sugar) and they turned out perfectly.  I don't really understand how so many people had problems.  Great recipe!

I just finished making a batch of almonds.  I think they're OK, but nothing special.  I agree with the former posters regarding the cooking time.  If you don't continue to stir through the cooking time, you'll run the risk of burning the nuts, and if you don't keep the pan on the burner until ALL the liquid has evaporated, you'll end up with almond brittle.  I also think that it would be helpful to roast the almonds beforehand.  I used whole raw almonds and believe they turned out a bit soft.

DELICIOUS and so easy to make.  Told my sister and son about it and they quickly assembled the three ingredients and within a few minutes, they experienced the same wonderful aroma and taste that I did.  My sister added a dash of cayenne in one of her batches and was happy with the results.  I had purchased a very large bag of almonds from Costco and this made several batches to package, tie with a ribbon and give to friends for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  My sister also made batches of Pecans using the same technique.  So happy I have this recipe...a great recipe for a beginner trying to impress!

Perfect ingredients, but you have to KEEP COOKING it until all the liquid is gone. I made candied nuts years ago while working in a restaurant but forgot the ingredients, so I followed this recipe but continued to cook in the pan until they were done. No need to put on a pan and separate at all. Delicious to eat alone or add to a salad, especially one using fruit with lettuce. Yum!

These turned out great. I only made 1/4 recipe since I needed a handful for a salad. I took a shortcut on these to save time and to keep my house from getting too hot in summer. I toasted the nuts in a non stick pan (don't use non stick for full fledged candy making!) and meanwhile boiled the sugar and water in a glass measuring cup in the microwave for a few minutes until it got very thick and slightly yellow. I sprinkled cinnamon on the nuts in the pan, then poured the sugar mixture over the nuts. It only took 60-90 seconds for the nuts to get the white cruncy coating others described. Very simple for occasions you don't have prepackaged candied nuts onhand.

Wow. I've never made candied nuts before, but I've always liked the Nutty Bavarian almonds.  It's been a while since I've had them so I can't say with much confidence how they compare to this recipe, but YUM.
Followed the advice of other reviewers and let ALL of the liquid disappear before cooling almonds.
Used white and brown sugar, and added cayenne pepper which made them DELICIOUS!  I didn't measure the cayenne, but I will say that the liquid tasted much spicier than the finished product, which is ok because they are a-mazing.

These are delicious! They are just as good as the ones we get from a street vendor or at the fairgrounds. As other reviewers said, be patient. I stirred constantly for at least 10 minutes and then the consistency changed almost instantly from a syrup to a powder. The kids will be asking for these all the time now!

Yum! I used walnuts and almonds which turned out great.Even though they are considerably unhealthy, they are a very tasty snack. Next time i need something sweet, im gonna pop a couple of these in my mouth to satisfy my sweet tooth. That way, it'll be low cal compared to most desserts.

I'll cook the nuts a bit less though next time, since i honestly liked them semi-sticky and shiny. Thanks Darla!

These nuts taste amazing! I've always been looking for a recipe for candied nuts... i just love candied nuts and this recipe, because it works for all nuts. MAKE SURE YOU READ THE REVIEWS. I thought I had failed when the mixture was all watery, I panicked. But dont give up, keep stirring and itll look just like the picture. Also, if you want to give it that crispy taste to it, back it in the oven again. Its just like the ones they sell

Very good- cooked up very quickly, just keep stirring and stirring. We couldn't wait for them to cool down, so we were eating them within 15 minutes of my first seeing this recipe. :) Will make again, maybe adding a pinch of salt?

This recipe didn't work for me. I didn't let all the sticky stuff evaporate, just the liquid like the recipe states. I wish I read more of the reviews or remembered what I read. They tasted great with the glaze while warm but by the time they dried they were stuck to the wax paper and immovable. It was disappointing. I will try it again.

Didn't turn out quite as pretty as the pictures that were posted...more like an almond brittle.  But reading through some of the other reviews I may not have cooked the mixture long enough.  At the time I was afraid that I was cooking it TOO long.  I'm about to try a 2nd batch to take over to a friends house, so it'll be trial and error.  Regardless of the cooking time, it tastes awesome!  Also, added about a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the mixture.

LOVE this recipe!  I actually halved it and put it on a scant cup of whole walnuts...the whole process only took about 5 minutes, so I'm thinking you're better off making smaller, fast batches.  DELICIOUS!  Thanks for the great recipe!
