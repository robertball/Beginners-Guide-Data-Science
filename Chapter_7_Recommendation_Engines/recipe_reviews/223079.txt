I used the stems of the greens, and omitted the capers.  The sun dried tomatoes were an unexpected pleasure in this dish!  I'll be making this again!

First time fixing beet greens. Not bad!  But why does the recipe say to discard the stems while the pic shows the stems?   I cut the stems into 1 inch pieces and sauteed in a little olive oil until they were tender. Then added the greens and followed the recipe pretty much as is from there.  Didn't shred the greens, just chopped roughly. Left out the sun dried tomatoes.  The capers were the perfect touch!

I made this for my supper tonight. I'm also a "pinch of this, pinch of that cook" so I didn't follow exactly. I needed to have a protein, too, so I added 3 oz. of frozen Boca crumbles. Topped it all with some rice vinegar (that's all I had). It was a pretty good, one pan meal. Thanks!

I was skeptical about this one because I am not a fan of beets, but we got the tops in our CSA this week.  Well, I'm very happy we did because these were great!

My husband usually does most of the cooking in our house but the other night he was engrossed in a TV show so I hit the stove!  I wanted a tasty way to prepare beet greens which he had already washed and cut up (sweet man). I found this recipe and it was close to what he usually does so I gave it a try.  BANG!  Delicious.  I did not have the sun dried tomatoes, but there were two partially used tomatoes in the fridge so I cut them up and tossed them in with the beet greens and capers.  I'd surely make this recipe again.  Thanks!

I accidentally left out the capers the first time and we really liked it. I made it again with the capers as we get a weekly CSA share and have been getting beets somewhat regularly; that time I included most of the stems since I'd seen that in another recipe. I didn't think the capers were really noticeable, but we really like the  sundried tomatoes and the stems were fine. We also threw out less. Going to make it again tomorrow.

I can't believe I've been throwing these away! I always thought I would have to cook them down forever (like turnip, mustard or collard greens)and I just don't have the time,  but only five minutes and they were perfect.  I didn't have any capers, but followed the rest of recipe exactly. Delicious!

Quick, easy and delicious. I hate to waste any part of my vegetables. This recipe helps prevent waste and is nutritious to boot! I did not have sun dried tomatoes but substituted some radishes I had leftover from another recipe. Result was GOOD!

Very tasty side dish!  I especially liked the little 'zing' of the capers.  I'll never throw away beet greens again!

Needed to do something with the greens from my beets. Found this recipe, but didn't have capers or tomatoes that weren't to be used elsewhere. Still super tasty and the hubby loved it!

They were great!  I subbed coconut oil and didn't have sundries tomatoes on hand and was still delicious. I liked it even setter the second day.

Very very yummy. I left out the sundried tomatoes just because I didn't have any. We really enjoyed these with dinner and they honestly couldn't be quicker to throw together much like spinach.

This was a perfect combo to the Snapper, potato salad I made. I made this as my husband was cooking the red snapper on the BBQ.  On farmer's market day I like to cook the beets while still fresh and wanted to do something quick with the greens that I usually toss. It was so easy and I had all the ingredients.  He is usually picky about what cooked greens he eats. He ate a large serving too. Thanks.

This was my first introduction to beet greens and I loved it.  I had some ricotta cheese I needed to use up so I threw it in there and loved it.
