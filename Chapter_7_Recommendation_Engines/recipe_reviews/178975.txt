I cannot stand people who rate a recipe before they've even tried it or because it was submitted by a food company rather than an individual! What's the point of that if you haven't even tried it??  There are many other brand names on this site who submit recipes other than Campbell's, so why judge a recipe just because you don't like that it's being submitted by a food company?  This was easy and fast for a week night meal, even though I don't usually like using soups and other processed ingredients and use them sparingly,  but hey, give us a break from your opinions based solely on what you THINK it might taste like when you haven't even tried the recipe!  And by the way, people have been cooking with Campbell's soup since before most of us were born.  Just saying, don't rate it unless you've tried it.

Substituted milk for the apple juice/water.  My husband was a HUGE fan of this recipe.  Told me this should replace my regular pork chop recipe - and even went back for more sauce to eat over his California blend veggies.  There is a similar recipe listed from Campbell's Kitchen, that omits the apple juice/water and spicy brown mustard - I'm glad I went with this one instead.

My husband & I really liked this!  I think it would work well with any long noodly pasta or rice, too.  Also, I cut the chops into big chunks (or "medallions," if you prefer). I think it looked more appetizing, and required less wrestling of the meat!

We all loved it.  Made a few changes because I didn't have everthing listed on hand.  Used Cream of mushrooms soup instead of celery.  Then added chopped celery(2 ribs). I did not have  spicy-brown mustard but had honey mustard and added some horseradish with it.  Added apple sauce with splash of water  instead of apple juice.  Sauce came out thick and nice.  Where no left overs.  Maybe next time I will add some onions and mushrooms.

Fantastic recipe!  Didn't really change anything, but I did add about half a container of fresh mushrooms when I added the soup mix.  The whole family loves this recipe..my kids even asked for seconds.  Thanks~

This was ok. I followed the recipe, except I forgot to add the honey, I used apple cider, and I served it with brown rice instead of egg noodles. The chops themselves were good, but the sauce wasn't very good. The celery just gave it a weird flavor. I really liked how easy and quick it was too cook, though, but if I make it again, I think I'd use cream of mushroom or even cream of chicken (cream of anything-but-celery, really), and that might make it better.

We really liked this recipe - the flavor combination is different, but balances out nicely.  The only thing I would change is to reduce the amount of honey since I would prefer a little less of the sweet.   I didn't have apple juice on hand, so I used another reviewer's idea of apple sauce mixed with water and the sauce turned out well.

My family LOVED this recipe.  The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because I did not follow the recipe exactly.  I used milk instead of apple juice!  And it was great!

This is a great recipe but I use cream of mushroom soup and milk instead of the apple juice or water. Serve it over your favorite rice and its an awsome comfort meal!

We really like this. I didn't have any egg noodles so had it with steamed carrots and mashed potatoes. I doubled it since I had some pork to use. I would have been fine with leaving the sauce as one amount instead of two.

Followed this exactly, but didn't care for it. The cream of celery soup gave it a weird flavor, and frankly it was kind of bland. I won't make it again, it wasn't worth the ease of it.

Although the celery and apple juice are a weird flavor, I crave this recipe every now and then.  I love it served with mashed fauxtatoes, which is actually cauliflower, steamed and then whipped with cream cheese, butter, salt and pepper.  Since I am diabetic, I try to stay away from potatoes, noodles, and rice.  This pork chop recipe served with the mashed cauliflower is something I make about once a month.  I don't change a thing.

A little bland - even I added salt at the table!  But loved the combo of soup, honey, mustard and apple juice.  I might try apple cider next time.

My family loved this receipt! Perfect blend of sweet and spicy. You can actually taste all the ingredients but no too much of any. I will make this again because we had no leftovers with a family of 4...including a 3 and 7 year old!

Interesting combination, for me it sounded better than it tasted. Apple and pork are such a classic combination but in this case I didn't care for it. It was easy to make and I would do it again with broth in place of the apple juice. The only change I made was to use Cream of Mushroom soup.

This is ok.  Nothing spectacular but certainly not awful.  It's not a company recipe but it's not trying to be- for an average weeknight meal it's adequate. The gravy is interesting!  It can't decide if it's sweet or savory, it is actually surprisingly complex and tasty.  All in all this is a decent yet ultimately forgettable recipe.  If you have a skillet pork chop recipe you already like, then I wouldn't recommend reinventing the wheel by trying this one. If you need a way to throw together dinner in a pinch then this is good enough for that and only needs ingredients that most will already have on hand. I served it with a stove top stuffing and frozen mixed veggies.

I had 2 thick bone-in chops (about 2.5") that I needed to use and found this recipe.  I only added a few personal touches and it was deemed restaurant quality by my husband.  First I chopped a little onion and one clove of garlic and added it to the pan with the oil to sauté before adding the chops.  Second I used Grill-mates Smokehouse Maple Rub sprinkled and rubbed into both sides of chops prior to adding to heated pan and seared the chops on both sides.  Lastly, it seemed to me that the creamed mixture was alittle bit thick after adding to pan so I adding about 1/4-1/3 cup of white wine to thin it slightly.  Then I let these cook on medium-low for about 25 min. because they were thick.  Served over egg noodles and it was a real hit.  Will definitely make again.

I thought this recipe was good but, it started out a little too sweet for me, so I added a little onion soup mix and thought it was great! Served it with brown rice and peas.

The Cream of Celery soup was overpowering, that's all I could taste. The gravy was too runny. I wouldn't try it again.

These chops were awesome.  Made them just as they were.  Very moist as my husband hates dry chops.
