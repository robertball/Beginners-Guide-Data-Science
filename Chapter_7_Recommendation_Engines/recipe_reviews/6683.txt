Great recipe. I made it like Grandma Van Doren probably did, using regular flour, because I'm sure "bread flour" did not exist when Grandma was feeding her hungry family.  Hint:  Double the yeast to halve the rising time. It's a real time saver.

Yummy bread and so easy in a mixer.  I like to put the loaves in disposable bread pans and throw them in the freezer before they rise.  Then I can have home baked bread any day I want.  Just leave the frozen dough out on the counter in the morning to rise all day and bake it in the evening.  This Bread tastes good with everything, but be careful, it goes quick!

Oh My!! This is a very good recipe. I love to bake bread and hate it when it comes out dense, not so with this one!

Nice and light dough, soft chewy crust!  I ended up using 4 packets of Rapid Rise Yeast because that's all I had.  All purpose flour worked fine as well. I let it rise for an hour in between each step and the cinnamon rolls rose an extra 35 minutes while the bread baked.

Made 2 nice loaves and a big batch of 18 cinnamon rolls with cream cheese icing. YUM!

 We ate a whole loaf with Peasant soup for dinner and had a cinnamon roll for dessert! I am so full! 

Nice tangy taste and wonderful texture, don't miss out TRY IT!!!

This is an update for my review.  I did finally make it right and this is a wonderful recipe just as is.  But if you add 3tbl of gluten flour, a tablespoon of vitamin c and an egg, they act as preservatives and keep the bread soft and fresh for longer than a week. I never buy bread anymore, and the daycare kids LOVE this recipe.     I did just about everything wrong with this and it still is the best bread recipe I've ever made.  I didn't let it set a sponge, I added 1/4 cup oil (reading too fast) didn't let it rise until double and it made the BEST ever cinnamon rolls and pizza.  This is fool proof, as I have proven.

This bread was delicious. There are only two of us so three loaves was to much. I cut the dough in thirds like the recipe says and used two for  bread, and the third for pizza dough. I spread it out on a pan greased lightly with shortening, and let it rest for about fifteen minutes. I put my toppings on and baked it for 30 min. at 375F or till the crust was browned. It was awesome. Definately use this again.

This is a delicious bread, but the best part about it is how fast and easy it is.  It rises so quickly - I got up early this morning to make this for a work lunch party and could have slept in another hour - start to finish takes about 2 1/2 hours.  I use regular all-purpose flour and butter the loaves before and after baking.  Delicious!

I have orders from the kids: "we will not eat that stuff from the store anymore". My son loves to cook and was amazed at the process and simplicity at making the perfect homemade white bread-think I have a budding chef! I have been looking for this recipe all my life! I wanted an EASY bread -not from a breadmaker -(there's nothin' like the feel of kneading fresh dough!) I am sooo pleased! As others have said it freezes so well (I am going to attempt freezing dough, after 1st rise, so we have fresh from the oven...!) If you want a simple, delectable and versatile bread (rosemary/thyme, cinnamon/raisin, cheddar, etc..), the possibilities are endless-this is your bread!! I actually got four good sized loaves!! There should be 10 stars for this one! P.S. to Ms. Sim-I met a lady a long time ago who had a 'secret' family recipe from her grandmother for the most delicious homemade olives I have ever had (and I DON'T LIKE them!) Anyway, she would be a little self centered w/ the attention whenever asked for the recipe (many did). She died a few years ago along w/her family olive recipe. She had no children or siblings. So her grandmothers wonderful recipe is lost. I am TRULY grateful to you who share these family treasures. I hope Grandma Van Doren is pleased w/ all the VERY happy children she is feeding!! My best to you!

Absolutely incredible!  We make this in the bread machine with the dough setting and it disappears within an hour out of pulling it out of the oven.  We generally only make a third of the recipe so it fits in the bread machine.

I just got back into bread baking and have played around with a variety of recipes over the last couple months, and this is the one that does the best job, consistently so. Good, crusty bread, freezes great, and very hard to mess up. The touch of sugar makes the difference, I think.

I used this recipe and made 2 big loafs, and 6 mini loafs of bread. I also adapted it, and added cheese & seasonings. No matter which way you bake it, its good!

I've been making this bread about three times a week since I discovered it a month ago. It is fantastic bread! I follow the directions for the most part, except for lowering the yeast to two tbsp. I don't like a strong yeast flavor and it still rises beautifully. I have large loaf pans so I always make either two loaves at a time or one loaf and buns. The buns from this bread are amazing! I roll out a rectangle from the dough and love to put either cheese and bacon or dried onion down and then roll up. I then take thread and slice the log of dough like you would for cinnamon buns, place on a baking sheet, let rise and bake at 350 for about 20 mins. Perfection!
Edit Dec. 16 2009- Just wanted to update, I still make this bread several times a week! I love it! I've actually started to lower the yeast even more than two tbsp. I make it with 1.5 tbsp and it really tastes much better. Other than that I don't change a thing. If you haven't tried to make this bread yet, please do! You won't be disappointed. It's the only recipe I use!

A good, solid recipe, but I didn't find it to be anything outstanding as most of the reviews led me to believe it would be. I have a couple of recipes that consistently deliver better results than this. It was moist enough when fresh, but by the second day, was starting to stale already, even though wrapped air-tight. Very crispy crust and light inside. Don't get me wrong. This resulted in a good loaf, nothing that we'd turn our noses up at. But let's face it, fresh home made bread, even so-so home made bread, is still wonderful! Edited to add: A far superior recipe on this website is Amish White Bread, with the sugar reduced from 2/3 cup to 1/2 cup. The texture is better, the crust is much more delicate, and it keeps its quality longer.

I really liked this recipe. It was nice and crusty and firm. It sliced so great.  It was just a touch of sweetness, perfect with my savory soup. It did indeed make three loaves.  I made two loaves and while they were baking I rolled the third into a rectangle. I rubbed margarin over it, covered it with brown sugar and cinnamon. I rolled it up like any other cinnamon roll.  Sliced it and put into a 10x13 pan. I let them rise an hour then baked about 18 min till brown on top. They were so good.  I used all purpose flour and 4 packages of active yeast.

This is an amazing recipe!  I first tried to make it in my bread machine.  Somehow it wasn't mixing properly once I added the additional 4 cups of flour so I decided to go ahead and do it by hand.  It rose beautifully and it was so light and wonderful.  I made it as written and wouldn't change a thing.  The taste was great too.  Thanks Marilyn!

LOVE THIS BREAD!!!!!!
My family is crazy about this bread. Wonderful texture, excellent taste. Number one in our book. 
A must try.
Update: I make 12 loaves of bread on my bake days. I also shape my loaves and freeze them after the second rise, they bake up well after being frozen for a few weeks. Three of the loaves I go ahead and cook, after cooling I preslice them, put them in plastic freezer bags. I freeze the slices and take out what we need as we go along. The slices thaw quickly, taste just like they were freshly baked, and we never have stale wasted bread. I recommend freezing what you don't eat.

This was the best bread recipe that I have ever made.  I didn't know about sponge rising, but when I saw it happen it was wonderful.  My bread was high and exceptionally tasty.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I used all purpose flour and it was great.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

I am HORRIBLE at making bread and have tried numerous white bread recipes and found them all to be entirely too heavy ....I wanted something that was light, fluffy, and had not only the perfect texture but taste as well....with one minor adjustment, this is definitely it! I wanted a bread that could serve as my everyday loaf of bread instead of buying it at the store, so I dropped the sugar down to 1/4 cup as others suggested and it was PERFECT!! If my husband doesn't get home soon, he might be getting any! I rarely eat bread without butter or anything on it, but I could eat an entire loaf without anything!! (however, I totally dig it with some butter, too!) My 5 year old devoured a piece and told me I was the best cook ever...a HUGE compliment. I highly expect my husband to praise this bread just as much! Thank you SO very much for sharing your family recipe...I will use this from now on...DELISH!!!! (P.S...I liked it a little if you can't tell....I'd give it 100 stars if I could!)

I have tried a couple of recipes from this site and this by far is the best. You can't mess this up if you follow the instructions. The only thing that I did different was after I divide it into the 3 loafs I roll one of them out with a rolling pin pat with milk sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar add raisins and roll up to form the loaf. You get 2 beautiful loaves of white bread and 1 loaf of cinnamon raisin.

Great bread!  I halfed the recipe and everything turned out great.  I always use a bread machine for the mixing/kneading, running it through 1 cycle of mixing/kneading, turn machine  off and immediately run through another cycle of mixing/kneading.  Once this is done, I throw it in the pan, cover and let rise.  This recipe rose beautifully.  Cooked on 350 for 30 min.  I will be making this bread every day - forget about store bought.

This was the third times I made the bread before I wrote this review. Because I want to make sure that this bread will accommodate my expectation. At least I expect my bread would be like the picture (not dense nor heavy, but light, chewy, fluffy). But it never came true. The last time I made it (in Pullman tin- perfectly square)it was slightly rubbery. It happens when I made bread with veg oil. Have to find another recipe that will fulfill my expectation...

This is a wonderfully easy and very tasty bread..just be careful when doing the conversion to make 12 or 14 servings..when the web site converts the measurements it doesnt convert the flour in the "directions" portion.  So you actually mix 1/2 the flour, then let it rise...then the other half, and let rise again....be careful..BUT IT IS SUPER BREAD!!!  THANKS FOR SHARING THE RECIPE!!!!

Yummy goodness! Easiest thing to make. Asked my hubby to pick up more yeast/flour so I could make more. He came back with 15 packs of yeast, and many bags of bread flour, so hrmmm... guess he liked it too. Very forgiving, too--first time I made this I left out a rise cycle and it was still very good! Seems the longer it rises the fluffier it gets. This is posted on my fridge as a staple recipe. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe! I love the idiot proof stuff! (12 days later, I'm back to say I used this for hamburger buns today, and it's wonderful. I've also made boules with it successfully. Thanks again!)

This is the closest I've come to making bread like MY grandma used to make.  It was delightfully crispy on the outside and moist adn airy on the inside.  Just the most perfect yeast white bread! Yum!

This bread is delicious!  I notice other people have mentioned cutting the recipe into thirds to make only one loaf.  Just a suggestion - you can also freeze some of the dough and bake it later.  After the 2nd rise, shape the dough as you would to fit in your bread pan and wrap it in plastic wrap.  I put my dough into freezer bags and label.  When you want fresh bread you just remove the dough, unwrap, place into a greased bread pan, and let it thaw (about 4-6 hours).  Then bake as usual.

I made this bread today, and i have to say it was the "best" and easiest Bread i have ever made! The directions were "right on" the bread was moist and dense, great texture and mmmmm so good with some butter slathered on right out of the oven.  I divided the dough in three sections as it said , i baked one loaf (I only had one bread pan) and i froze the other two sections to save for an easy thaw out and bake bread when i want to.  Or maybe some yummy cinnamon rolls or dinner rolls. I will let you know how those turn out.  I scoured all recipes looking for the best rated bread and i read the reviews and decided to give this one a try because of all the great reviews.  I must say it is definitely as good as everyone says. If my mom was alive , she would definitely have loved to try this bread. She always made a great bread also, but i don't think it was as "easy" as this recipe.  The hardest thing about this recipe is the anticipation of trying a slice , while you smell that delicious aroma drifing through the house.  Thank you for sharing this recipe. This is definitely one i will make over and over again.

This recipe yields three good sized loaves of bread. I have been modifying the recipe to about 50-50 white bread flour and whole wheat flour. It is excellent. I rated the kid friendly portion a little lower since I don't think they would have the patience for bread making.

I've been wanting to try this recipe for a while and finally today had the time. I am kind of in a let's make bread as often as possible mood so this looked like a great recipe to try. I was kind of surprised at how much yeast it wanted...most other recipes use much less. I used 4 packets of the active yeast and it was enough.  My dad was visiting and the fact that the bread dough bubbled freaked him out. I don't usually watch the bread as it rises so I don't know if that happens often. 
I had tons of dough in the end and decided to make two loafs and play with the rest. This time I made some cinnamon rolls and cinnamon bread. The bread was a little iffy but the rolls were amazing! I created a cinnamon, brown sugar, nut mix for the filling and iced them with cinnamon cream cheese frosting. I will use this recipe again, i want to try to make garlic cheese rolls.

My first attempt at making bread sans bread machine and it turned out! I couldn't stop eating this, after a half a loaf I just forced myself to walk away.  So happy that I tried this because it is actually quite easy.  Thanks for sharing.

I've made this white bread twice and it turned out great.I gave it to 4 different friends and without exception they all raved over it saying it was the best white bread they'd ever eaten.I'm not an experienced bread maker.I have only been in this hobby for about 5 weeks and even with my lack of experience this bread came together easy,tasty and without a glitch!

This was great! I halved the recipe and made one big loaf. I also used honey instead of sugar and 1/2 white whole wheat flour for the flour. Yum! This will be awesome for sandwiches :)

I have always enjoyed this site and never rated before.  That being said, after reading the glowing reviews on this bread recipe I hurried to get the ingredients. We worked all afternoon and I was as excited as a kid at Christmas. Well what a let down, the bread was not even as good as frozen dough and it took all afternoon to get 3 loaves of which had to be nuked the NEXT DAY just to even eat it. We followed the recipe to the hilt. What a huge disappointment!  If I could give a negative star, I would.

I've been trying for years to find a good white bread recipe, and now I've found it.  The ones I've tried previously have usually been "too" much of something: too dense, too yeasty, too sweet, etc.  This one has the perfect combination of everything, and it comes out perfect!  I had never tried the sponge method before, and found it quite interesting to watch in its final stages. (My two kids were up on chairs watching the mixture bubble and move.)  I only made two loaves of this recipe because I was short on yeast; I let the dough hook on my mixer do the kneading for me, which I usually don't do.  I was so amazed how high this rose once I put it in the oven.  I thought it was at its max after the 2nd rising, but it towered up beautifully once I began baking it.  I am so impressed with this recipe and am looking forward to adding spices, etc. to it.

incredible bread...I live in France, and this bread is delicious, that says something. I did add 2 T almond extract, and I'm glad I did, as the bread has a beautiful almond aftertaste.

I love extracts and will try the bread with orange blossom water as well as orange juice as part of the water requirement. I can't wait.

This bread will now be my staple for other breads that I decide to make, such as cinnamon raisin, honey whole wheat etc... highly recommended!

I have been baking bread for more than 20 years and I can honestly say that this is the most wonderful bread I have ever made. It doesn't take a high level of culinary skill but will taste like it does. I thank your grandma!!!

Thanks! I was nervous when I read through the recipe. When was it doubled? What's a sponge? It just didn't matter! I've made this recipe twice now, and it is so forgiving of my lack of experince in breads. I used by Kitchenaid to knead, high-gluten unbleached flour, olive oil and fresh yeast from the bulk store. It is a beautiful, aromatic, light, flavorful loaf. Try it!

I have been making this bread for eight years now. It is still my  go to recipe. it is very forgiving and allows for substitutions easily. Today I used a mix of bread flour and white wheat flour, coconut oil and honey. Still turned out great.

God Bless Grandma VanDoren.  My search is over.  This was by far the best white bread recipe I have come across.  We made 2 loaves of the white bread and then tried something a little different with the 3rd.  We flattened the dough a bit, after the the 1st rising, and spread cooked Italian sausage on it.  Then rolled it  and shaped it into a loaf.  The bread was a hit with our dinner guest.  Thank you for sharing this family jewel, we will use it often.

WOW!  This recipe is a keeper.  I have made it several times now.  The only thing I did different is I used 1 1/2 cups skim milk and 1 1/2 cups water instead of the 3 cups water.  I also made it once with 5 cups bread flour and 3 cups whole wheat flour.  That was really good also, if you like wheat bread.  Thank you Marilyn for the recipe, it is my staple bread recipe now!!!!

If I can make this work, anyone can.  First of all I had no bread flour, so used regular flour.  Secondly, I decided to use my Kitchenaid dough hook instead of kneading it, and last of all, only one of my two oven heating elements were working, so baking them had a disasterous potential--yet all three loaves still turned out great!  Thanks for the delicious recipe.

Wow!!! I have been baking bread for a while this bread is so much better than store bought!!! The bread dough is very sticky.  But that is how it gets to be so moist and crusty! Besides that the directions were very easy to follow.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe with us!

Thank you for this recipe. I have been making bread for about 2 years but never had a recipe that I really like or one that made bread "like mom used to make" I make 3 at a time now and keep 2 in the freezer. They are the best, moist and light, and not crumbly like the others I have tried....Thanks again for sharing...This is the only one I will use from now on. Even sending it to my sister how has made bread for 30 years...

I actually printed this recipe quite some time ago and have been using it as my staple every day recipe since.  I whip up 3 loaves and put 2 in the freezer - we hardly ever buy bread anymore.  This is the best recipe!

It uses what is called the "sponge rise" method, though after looking this term up on Google, what is described in this recipe is not the standard for this method.  Doesn't matter... This is a great bread, though not one I would consider for making sandwiches with. No this is a bread where you slice off a slab, the likes of Texas Toast. This bread is the type you use for sopping up all that goodness left in the stew or soup bowl... This is the slice of bread you use to make sure you get all that Gooey goodness of the egg yoke off the breakfast plate. This, this is the bread that serves as a desert... With soft butter smeared on it and a heaping spoonful of jam, chased by a good cup of coffee or ice cold milk. Mmmmm!

Thank You Grandma VanDoren!

Now I didn't have enough "bread loaf" pans, so I substituted a good ol cast iron skillet, oiled and sprinkled with corn meal. Tonight when I make another batch... I'll use instead my cast iron dutch oven... that way it will rise much higher and be more plentiful. My Mother taugh me to coat the tops with a cold butter stick shortly out of the oven... it makes the crust all that much softer.

This was the first time I ever baked something that looked so bakery-perfect that I took a photo of it. I got a lot of facebook 'likes' on that picture! The dough was pretty sticky, so I added a little more flour. It was still more sticky than I usually let yeast dough stay, but I went with it and got a beautiful result.

This bread was good, but a little sweet like yeast rolls. I also do wish I could have made 2 loaves at a time though, as 3 is a bit much. However, it is easily freezable in bread bags. I mixed and kneaded in my Kitchen Aid mixer making it relatively easy to make. The recipe wasn't specific, on rise times or other important bread making details, but I have made enough bread to know what to look for. The rise times that worked for me were 30 min, 45 min, and 1 hour. Before baking I brushed the loaves with an egg wash to give them a shiny top. It is not much of a sandwich bread, because of its sweetness, which makes it less versatile, however it is great hot with some butter and would go really well with a hearty meal. For some reason it is also really good toasted with breakfast.

I made this exactly as the recipe said except I used all purpose flour.  It turned out great.  It makes 3 loaves so I took one in to work and everybody there loved it too.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe delivers, I was looking for a quick, but still GOOD homemade bread. All done in about 2  hours, and turned out very tasty. Took it to a family function and got rave reviews! Thanks to you and your Grandma!

I baked 2 great big loaves instead of 3 smaller ones. We really like this recipes. Very easy to do, and the results are great. Only problem is that it gets eaten up real fast! Next time I will make 2 loaves and some hamburger buns. Very nice dough to work with. I think I am going to try the cinnamon loaf that some reviewers had done.

So many recipes for homemade bread turn out dense and dry, so I was very happy to find this soft, moist white bread! I usually cut the recipe by 1/3 for one loaf, putting the ingredients in my bread machine on the dough cycle (water and olive oil first, then flour, salt, sugar, and yeast). After the dough cycle completes, I take out the dough and give it a few half-hearted kneads, then place it in a greased 9x5 glass bread pan. I cover it with greased wax paper and let it rise in a slightly warmed oven until it is poofing out over the sides of the pan (about a half an hour) and then bake it as directed in the recipe. I make this bread about once a week, and it turns out great every time! My roommate and I have decided that this is pretty close to our all-time favorite food.

I've baked a lot of bread over the years.  This one tops them all.  I jumpstarted the yeast first though, by making a poolish from 1/2 the flour, all of the water, sugar and yeast and letting it set for 20-30 minutes until it was bubbly.  I also gave it two risings before putting it in the pan!  Wonderful flavor and texture!  Sure to be a staple around our house.  Thanks Grandma VanDoren!

Move over Amish white bread, this is my new favorite!  This bread is awesome.  The taste is great, and it isn't dense like the Amish bread.  DH LOVES it!  I used honey in place of the sugar and also all-purpose flour.  It is a wonderful, soft, slightly sweet bread.  Thank you, Grandma VanDoren!

This bread actually has  flavor and makes wonderful toast. Ummm...just ate a piece slathered in butter and home made slowcooker apple butter. My   very, very favorite bread recipe that always rises so high and tastes so goodI found over 30 years ago in a Fleischmans bread book. It will remain top dog and not fall out of favor but Grandma VanDoran's will be right next to it on my favorite breads list. As several others have owned up to  I do not use bread flour either. I doubt that Graqndma VanDoren had the privilage of bread flour available to her. My bread pans are a smidge larger that those called for so next time I'm going to make two larger loaves rather than three smaller. Easy and delicious -disappears quickly - what more could you ask for to get me back in the kitchen to make more of Grandmas's wonderful bread.

If I could I would give grandma and Marilyn great big hugs and many thank yous':):) I have searched for a yummy bread recipe for 2 years now. Everything I tried turned out too heavy and flavorless:( BUT after baking this bread, smelling it's comforting scent, marveling over it's airy interior and crisp exterior, I knew I had a winner! The true test came when my husband tried it. He's never cared for any of the other breads I've baked but lo and behold-he LOVED it! In fact he couldn't get enough:):) Suggestions: I experimented with different oils. A fat free healthy bake oil actually tasted the best (my husband dislikes fat free foods so for him to like this oil best is a shocker to us both:)), followed by corn oil, veg. oil came in 3rd, and olive oil was last place. FABULOUS! ENJOY:):)

I've made this bread several times now and it always comes out well.  My wife likes it because it's less crumbly than other breads.  Since I bake bread every week, I'm quite familiar with judging how much flour is needed.  My only caution is watch the flour, I've never put in the full 8 cups (usually 6.5 to 7 cups), granted I usually use unbleached all purpose flour instead of bread flour.  Also, on occasion I've used part (3 cups) whole wheat flour, which works well too.

This bread was soooo good! I used olive oil instead of vegetable, regular all purpose flour,and brushed the tops of the bread with butter before baking. It's soft and chewy inside, and the crust is crunchy. This is now my favorite bread recipe! Thank you so much for sharing.

I didn't have bead flour, but turned out amazing none the less! I think next time I'll give it a brush of butter (the top) before baking to give it something a little more special. My picky husband said it was better then wonder bread ;)

Very  good bread. Easy to work with and I loved that it made so many loaves. I made 2 loaves and used the leftovers for Blackberry Bubble Ring (AR) and it was very delicious. Thanks Grandma VanDoren :) Grandma recipes are always the best!

Grandma you rock!!! I have made a lot of bread in my years, and this one is the winner. It came together perfectly in the bowl, it rose beautifully, baked up awesome, and slices great. Oh and it tastes great too and has a great texture. Thank you for posting this one Grandma!!! :)

Fantastic recipe!  I let my bread machine do the "hard" work and mix/knead the dough, but did the rest myself following the rest of the directions.  Flavor is great, I love the bit of sweetness from the sugar.  I used the servings conversion calculator to determine the ingredients needed for a single loaf, and the end result was perfect.  The only thing I'll do different next time is brush the top with butter near the end of the cooking time.

My family loves this bread, it is great toasted, snadwich and pretty much for any recipes you need bread for (grilled cheese, french toast)

I use half white flour, half whole wheat and half white sugar, half honey.

Okay.. I studied the reviews, but with any thing, it could be the environment, the person cooking, the oven, the ingredients...but I gave it a try anyway. All I can say is.. WONDERFUL!! I have been looking for a great bread recipe.. I have saved a few in my recipe box here, printed many from other websites, well I believe that I found my recipe! I just learned how to make homemade buttermilk biscuits and now yeast bread. This made 3 loaves of bread.. I shared one with my neighbor, we had one for dinner and I have one to munch on tomorrow.. it won't last the week! Thanks for sharing!!

I call this "Two Grandmas Bread" because I use my grandmother's glass loaf pan! It is a little smaller than normal, so I get 4 GORGEOUS & delicious loaves! Perfect every time, even when I screwed up and doubled the yeast first time I made it! I used highly active yeast this time & it went way fast! My guy loves this bread & refuses store bought now. Gonna try some of the variations in the reviews below for rolls or cinnamon treats! Thanks for sharing your special recipe! I am so glad our two grandmas met to give me such a wonderful treasure! They are gonna hang out in my kitchen a LOT!  :)

This was so easy. Made it in my stand mixer and used 3 cups whole wheat and the rest AP. Used one loaf as garlic bread tonight. Don't think I'll be buying store bread again. Update: Made another batch of these and used one portion for pizza. It's so simple and easy!

I really like this bread recipe.  the texture is excellent.  I have another favorite, but this one is really good. and I even did my best to screw it up (accidently) and it still came out great. baked one loaf, froze one before it rose second time, and made wonderful cinnamon rolls with the rest.  YUM!

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would!  The bread was delicious and so easy!  I made two loaves of bread and about 10 bread rolls.  The rolls made delicious sandwiches, they were wonderful!  The bread has a delicate crust and a wonderful crumb.  Highly recommended!

Such and easy recipe that makes amazing bread! Absolutely perfect, if you allow enough rising time you will get the perfect texture.

Awesome bread recipe. I was using another one from this site but it had more oil and sugar. I was trying to find something a little less sweet that would make good sandwich bread. This is fantastic bread!  I did make one alteration though, I used 6 cups of bread flour and 2 cups of whole wheat. I also skipped the sponge part and just mixed all the flour in and kneaded by hand for about 5 minutes and it came out perfect.

This was a very sticky dough. Probably had to add another 2 cups of flour to make it managageble. My Kitchen Aid couldn't handle it so had to knead by hand, what a task! The first rise was high at only 30 min so punched down for 2nd rise and shaped into loaf and 24 rolls but 2nd rise took a long time and very seemed to never fully rise.  I much prefer the Amish White Bread Recipe,much lighter and more manageable recipe.

I've been really working with yeast breads lately. Seems to help me work out all my frustrations.

This was incredibly simple. I even halved the recipe to make one loaf and it wasn't difficult at all. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer for everything. I let the yeast proof in the mixing bowl with the sugar and warm water, then gradually added the dry ingredients. Then, I kneaded the dough with the hook for about five minutes. I made sure to oil my bread pan, shape the loaf and add it to the pan, then slather it with oil on top. When I let it rise, I covered it with saran wrap tightly, then a dishtowel. This bread baked up beautifully. I want to say that this bread recipe is like the Amish White Bread, but I think it's a little fluffier and a little less sweet. 

This will go well with tonight's stoup.

light and airy; favorite of my family.  followed the recipe exactly leaving the bread to rise 35 to 45 minutes at each rising.  added cheddar cheese before the last rising on one of the loaves and froze 2 before the last rising to make at another time.  thanks for sharing this one!

Super easy, tasty bread.  I added flax meal to make it higher in fiber.  Than made it into dinner rolls.

This easy recipe was okay but nothing special. I wanted a bread a little fluffier than my standard recipe and based on the reviews I expected this to be super fluffy which it was not. I guess I was expecting more based on all the rave reviews. Overall, not bad but not great.

Oh, this is really good. The dough was not the same consistancy as most of the breads I make...so I really didn't think it would turn out...I had to put it in a warmed oven to rise (and it rose beautifully). And the end result was a gorgeous, soft crusted, fluffy bread. YUUUUM! This is a keeper.

Okay taste, but did not rise well and came out "squished" down.  Maybe I could have added more yeast?  I wont make this recipe again since it didn't turn out and I never have problems making bread!

RUN DON'T WALK to your kitchen and make this bread.  It's THE BEST recipe I've tried from allrecipes.com so far.  I knew it would be wonderful by the smells and sight in my oven.  My little family of three was standing in front of the oven counting down the last 10 seconds before it was done like we were at an NBA game waiting for the game winning point.  We devoured an entire loaf immediately.  It's seriously yummy!  

I substituted about two cups of the bread flour for all purpose flour and cut the baking time to 30 minutes.  I covered the tops w/ foil for the last 5 minutes as suggested.  It's perfect!

Edited to add:  This made THE BEST french toast a few days later.

This is the first time I have successfully made a yeast bread. It's delicious AND easy! When eaten right out of the oven, the crust is nice and crunchy. The inside is also very fluffy, moist and slightly sweet. I scaled the recipe to make 1 loaf and used all-purpose flour, but the bread still turned out fine. I actually prepared the dough and let it rise the night before. Then, I placed it in the fridge overnight after it doubled with the damp cloth so I could bake it this morning. I let it rise in the prepared pan near my stove when I was steaming some dumplings to take to school and it rose fairly quickly. The key to making the bread rise is having a warm environment for the yeast to work. This is the best recipe for white bread I have come across. =)

In the words of one of my friends, "YUMMY!"  This does make a massive amount of bread, so I made one loaf, some rolls, and a round loaf that I put melted butter and garlic on.  They all turned out great.  My boyfriend will be so surprised when he gets home.

i just finished baking the first loaf and the second one is in the oven.... this is by far the best bread i've ever tasted. its so moist and whatever... 
i accidentally fell asleep last night before i could bake it, so it just rose overnight... worked out fine. 
i'm sure even my mother will be impressed with this (i'm 16) and she makes the most delicious food imaginable.
thanks for the recipe! will definitely make again.

My family just loves this bread!  I just use 1/4 cup of honey instead of sugar, as we are cutting back on our sugar intake.  I make it all the time and recently added wheat flour.  Right now my family's favorite combination is 4 cups bread flour and 2 cups whole wheat.  Excellent recipe!

Oh my goodness!  You cannot believe how incredibly delicious this bread is.  I was a little nervous making this, because I am a novice bread maker.  I cut the recipe down to a third, because the only yeast I had on hand was one packet of quick rise yeast.  I used unbleached AP flour and canola oil.  I used my stand mixer to knead the dough and let it rise in the mixing bowl.  I covered the loaf for the last 7 minutes (cooked for 35 minutes total) and slathered the top in butter when it came out of the over.  It was absolutely divine!  I will not look elsewhere for a white bread recipe.  It cannot get any better than this one!

First off, I am no baker by any stretch of the imagination, nor cook for that matter. I do enjoy trying new recipes but not very often. What brought this recipe to light, I have no idea, but I am thrilled beyond words. 

I first was captured by the picture that remarkably looked just like what Grandma used to make. This is a feat in itself with 4000 +/- bread recipes online. 

I made the recipe the first time and overlooked letting it rise a second time, (remember... not a baker) I still loved the loaf, even though it was dense, the flavor and texture took me back 40 years. I nearly cried, no kidding. I couldn't wait to make the next batch and today was the day. (08-23-14)

Unbelievable!!!! No reason on God's green earth to ever have store bought bread in the house. Tell me why we settled for anything less??

I tried to upload photo but haven't enough megapixels...whatever!

I encourage everyone to give this a try.

Thanks a million for sharing "Grandma Vandoren's" recipe.  

God Bless, Shalom.

I've used this recipe a number of times and love it. I start the yeast in the water & sugar first before continuing with the recipe, and I always need a lot more flour than the recipe calls for. I don't even think you can start kneading it until you have at least 9 (closer to 10) cups of flour in there.

Freaking awesome bread. Seriously folks, stop thinking about making this bread and just do it. I was looking for a recipe that would come close to the bread I had when visiting my relatives on their farm in Northern Michigan and this nailed it. Just to put this in perspective, I made this bread in 90 degree weather with 85% humidity, left it to rise too long TWICE...AND baked in a silly toaster oven. (no one has an oven in the Carribean darlink) It still came out fabulous. Thank you to the person who posted this, I love you.

I love making bread and this recipe held up well to my extra ingredients, like shredded cheddar and onion flakes or garlic salt, oregano and parmesan. I roll out the bread and sprinkle my 'extras' on top then roll it back up, brush tops with egg yolk wash and sprinkle more of the 'extras' on top, pop it in the oven. No additional time is needed for the baking. The family and friends take big chunks slathered with butter and call it a meal! Even the white bread goes as fast as I can make it! Yummy!

I made cinnamon rolls of the third portion of the bread loaves. (2loaves seemed enough).to my surprise they turned out to be 'the best' cinnamon rolls ever."The outside was light crisp while the inside was super fluffy".I  had used all purpose flour, as bread flour wasn't available. The texture I got was the texture I had never got till date when using all purpose flour. There's something about the recipe I guess.After shaping the2loaves I made a mixture of brown sugar (dark)+melted butter+cinnamon+ zest of 1whole orange+walnuts. Spread it on the shaped rectangle, rolled, sealed&cut into 8pieces,which were of standard size.i did let them rest &rise for 35min while the loaves were baking.&then baked them for 20min at400°f(200°c) on bottom rack. What I got was out of the world.it didnt need any glaze or topping&was a complete balance of sweetness. The flavour was mind blowing. My darling hubby couldn't stop eating. ..What more can I say.thanks  grandma & marylin from the very bottom of my heart, because the texture of bread & cinnamon rolls was the texture I ever imagined & that too using all purpose flour. No bread or croissant or pretzel till date gave me the quality & texture I always wanted.

Made 3 loaves, exactly as recipe stated, and baked them at same time.  Melted 2 sticks of butter, divided into 3 different little bowls.  The first, I left alone. As for the 2nd bowl of butter, I added lemon juice, basil, lemon pepper, pepper, and parsley, to taste. For the 3rd bowl, I added minced garlic, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper, with just a dash of chili powder and cumin for a little kick.  I spread half of the bowls of butter onto the loaves with a basting brush; one flavor for each loaf, just before baking.  Then, about 10 min before it was done, I spread the other half of the bowls of butter onto their respective loaves.  3 loaves disappeared in one friendly gathering, when everyone supposedly already ate before they came over!!  They just kept coming back and picking off slice after slice!! Easy recipe to expand on and create with, too!

Well, I have never made bread with oil before, and was really skeptical about using it.  No more skepticism, it does work.
This bread has great texture, and wonderful homemade taste.  Made three loaves this AM, the dough raised wonderfully, but with 3 TBSP yeast you would expect that.  
Will use this recipe as my go to from now on.
Thanks for sharing such a great one.

Would rate this 10 stars if I could!  I halved the recipe and made one loaf of bread and used the other half for cinnamon rolls.  It was super easy and tastes very much like my Nanna's!  Thank you for sharing!

I just tried this recipe today and I have never seen Home Made Bread have the taste, texture and look that this recipe has. All my life family members have been making home made bread which never turned out like this did. I highly recommend this recipe to everyone.
This is my recipe now, nothing else!!!!

The BEST bread recipe you will find.  I substitute the vegetable oil with olive oil for a more Italian taste and bake it into knot rolls rather than loaves.  My family asks me to make this bread for every holiday.

This recipe was amazing. It had the right texture, didn't make my mouth feel weirdly dry, and tasted like the way I always imagine homemade bread is supposed to taste. The only change I made was that I used butter instead of oil only b/c that's what I had on hand. The bread was fluffy, light, flavorful...I mean, just perfect. Really, really good. I've tried MANY white bread recipes over the years, and this is a clear winner. Will absolutely 100% make again.

A W E S O M E!! I've never been happy with the results in my bread baking before.  Over 30 years I've tried and tried to get the soft, wonderful yumminess my grandmother used to make.  Lots of people can and do get their bread to turn out with other recipes. But mine never did, until this recipe.  With 3 rises, it may seem like it would take longer to make, but I found that it took no longer than other recipes. That first rise of the "sponge" seemed to really get that yeast going! My 14 yr old daughter, tasting the first cloverleaf roll, said, "Mom, why haven't you made this before." :)

Today I made this recipe for the 2nd time. It's a large, awesome recipe. Enough for two loaves of bread and a pan of cinnamon rolls. It comes out perfect every time. Put some cream cheese frosting on top and a mixture of cinnamon (lots), pecans, butter and brown sugar in the middle and those rolls are to die for.

Tried this recipe, my first time ever baking bread. It was so easy to prepare. Being a family of two, I cut the recipe in half, and used two packets of quick rise yeast. Rising was a breeze, and bake time was approximately 30 minutes. Yield was one loaf and one large bun for sampling (or else I knew my other half would be tearing up my lovely loaf!). The bread tastes great (better than store bought) and was so easy to make we're never buying bread at the store again. Thanks for the recipe!

I can't express my thanks for this perfect recipe.  I have literally tried so many ways to make homemade bread.  I had even tried a bread machine and was only able to make hot dough!  This recipe is perfect as is.  I've got a stand mixer and just throw the ingredients in it, use the kneading hook through the whole process and follow the instructions.  I usually make the 3 large loaves, but tried one of the suggestions and made 2 loaves and made the best homemade cinnamon rolls in the world with the remaining dough.  Another time I added 1 cup wheat flour and 7 cups white flour and it was really good too.  This is the most consistent recipe I've ever made.  No matter how many times I make it it's perfect every time.

Is it possible for a bread to be "too fluffy"?  Maybe I let it rise too long, but it was definitely too fluffy.  The middle couldn't handle the pressure of the bread knife cutting through the crust.  I'll try it again and watch the rise time.  Delicious, but with faults.

I made 1 batch yesterday and I used bread flour.  I proofed my yeast till it was very bubbly and I ended up with a very nice and tall loaf of bread.

Since that turned out well, this morning I am making a full batch with all purpose flour.  I put 2 mini loafs of dough in the freezer for future use--figured a mini loaf would be perfect with a spaghetti dinner some night.  I also 2 small loaves which are in the oven, and a pan of 10 cinnamon rolls.  The dough was the perfect consistency, it reminded me of a bakery yeast dough.  Can't wait until it is out of the oven!

My plan is to bake the bread and dry it to use in my Thanksgiving dressing.

Looks just like the picture, Yummy!  Didn't change a thing.  It was super easy.  Just takes time to let it rise (several times) but I didn't mind.  It made 3 loaves so hopefully you have three loaf pans in your home.  I went out and bought the aluminum loaf pans (they come three to a pack) and that worked out perfectly.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Halved recipe. Had to add about 1/3 cup extra flour but it made a really smooth dough. Used my kitchen aid and did 1/2 whole wheat. Thanks!

I have been using this recipe for a few months now and want to thank Marilyn for sharing Grandma VanDoren's bread recipe with us.  My whole family loves this bread!!  It has a flaky crust and has a wonderful texture and flavor. The taste is very much like what my Mom baked when I was a child.  My husband loves this bread and that makes me happy!  I follow the recipe exactly, except I use one less cup of flour than is called for because I live in the desert and the dough would just be too dry.  I love the sponge technique and have success each time I make this recipe.  I am so thrilled to have found this recipe!!  The search is over and I and my family are very happy!!!

As others have said, it's light inside, crispy/crunchy (lightly so) on the outside. It makes three great loaves. It rises very quickly, so wait three times is still faster than a typical recipe. I'll be making it again! Thank you!

My husband really enjoyed the bread, as did our housemates who pretty much depleted our 3-loaf supply.  If I make it again, I'll be hiding the bread so the housemates don't eat it all :p

This was my first attempt at bread baking, and it was easy!  I'll definitely be experimenting with different types of breads.  I did notice a strong, yeast-y sort of taste, which probably comes from the fact that I've never eaten fresh-out-of-the-oven-made-from-scratch bread.  Still, for the yeastiness, I rate this a 4-Star recipe.

I also used regular flour, and had no trouble.

Spread a little garlic powder and some butter shavings over the top before baking for a nice, savory bread.

I've never had a bakery product come out so gross before. There is a possibility that I messed up, but I am an experienced baker.

I came across this recipe on here. Tried it and the whole family loved it. It was gone in no time. They request I make it again every time there is a family get together.

This gets 5 stars as a very forgiving recipe!  I completely forgot the vegetable oil until it was almost done kneading in my stand mixer.  I added 3 Tablespoons instead of the 4 and added just a bit more flour and it still turned out great.  When I shaped the loaves, I thought there would be a lot of air bubbles but there were not.  It was a little sweet so I will cut back on the sugar next time and experiment with adding some other healthier ingredients--seems like it can handle it!  Kids were VERY excited for white bread!

This was a delicious bread! It tasted great, and very old-fashioned. My only complaint is that it disappeared too quickly. :)

This is great! I've been baking since I was very little and this is the easiest recipe with the biggest payoff that I've ever used! I did have to use ap flour and olive oil, since being snowed in means no quick store runs lol, but it still came out wonderful! I made 4 big loaves ( made 2 batches ) and 4 large pizzas. My kids raved over it! Thank you so much for giving me a new go to recipe for good solid bread!

Simple recipe and it taste great, a little salty though.   I altered the directions and the dough still turned out beautifully.  I proofed the yeast and omitted one rise.  Will definitely bake again.

The first bread I've ever had real success with! After trying countless recipes this one finally did it. I followed it mostly to the letter (added a bit more yeast, buttered the pans instead of grease) and it came out perfect. I could tell as soon as the knife passed through it that it was a success. Can't wait to try other varieties now!   Also, I have to say that I really like the "sponge" method. I have tried proofing and a few other ways but this really worked well.   I'm way too happy about this. "woah, this lady is really excited about her bread."

This was delicious bread. It reminded me of my Gramma's bread. I just don't know the purpose of mixing all the ingredients THEN letting it rise, which is much more time consuming than the normal proofing of yeast and sugar in warm water. So, since I followed the recipe to a T, it took quite a while, as it was a "three rise" recipe. I might just proof the yeast next time instead of going through the process of mixing all the ingredients and then rising. But, it was still delicious. I only have one loaf pan, so I cut the recipe by 1/3, made one loaf last night, and stuck the rest of the dough in the fridge for today.

I've tried several bread recipes with varying degrees of success.  This is by far the BEST.  I made a loaf and 6 large buns, my husband didn't believe it was homemade bread.

This recipe is delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe states, but add a drizzle of honey in the last 10 minutes of baking. My family love this bread and I have made it monthly since finding the recipe 6 months ago. Perfect to go with soups and pasta!

delicious right out of the oven!  Made 1 loaf, 1 large pizza crust, and have 1/3 dough left to make another pizza later this week - really easy recipe.  I was skeptical about not proofing the yeast first, but I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful!  My family thanks you for sharing this!

This recipe is good. Exept for when i add all the flour the dough is dry and wont stay together. Also the bread is very doughy and dense after you bake it. But this is my 3rd time baking it and everyone loves it.

I use all-purpose flour and 1/4 c white sugar (or a tad more) and its perfect for sandwiches, toast, whatever!  I bake mine for about 27 minutes.  Bread freezes and thaws great!  I've also used this modified recipe for dinner rolls.  Bake 12-15 minutes at 350.  Perfect!

Followed the recipe exactly. This bread did not really work for me.  I was not over keen on the crust.  Many better bread recipes out there.  Don't think I will be baking this bread again.

I make a lot of bread recipes. My husband and children loved this recipe. I used my bread machine for the dough cycle. I ended up braiding the dough. I let it rise again for 30 minutes and baked it for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Light and very moist. Very lovely. This will be my go-to recipe for white bread.

Thanks to Grandma! We made this recipe a couple of times....fantastic!!!! The only adjustments we made was to put 2 tsp of yeast and we put only 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Everyone, and I mean everyone, loved it!!! We even had requests to bake it again. This is defenately a keeper. Even our finicky 5 yr old loved it.

This bread was not bad, just not as great as I expected. It tasted good right out of the oven, but all fresh-baked bread does. Toast was also good the next day, but I can't imagine using this bread for sandwiches. Too dense and yeasty.

My daughters are devouring this bread while I write the review.  We made a loaf for a friend as a thank you today, and they thought it smelled so good, I had to come home and make one for them.  We're slathering it in the Cinnamon Honey Butter from this site (modified with 1 extra cup of butter), and it's melting into the warm bread for a little slice of heaven!  My Grandma was the breadbaker for the whole family and lots of friends as well, but she passed away without anyone ever getting her recipe.  This comes pretty darn close.

This is the yummiest bread! Since I began making this bread I usually make at least 2 loaves a week and rarely buy bread from the store anymore. I reduced the recipe to make only 2 loaves at a time. We usually devour one whole loaf almost as soon as it gets out of the oven! I also substitute 2-3 teaspoons of the sugar for the same amount of honey as this seems to keep the bread moist longer (just in case it lasts that long LOL). We LOVE this bread!

I think this is a wonderful recipe! I have only made free form rustic style crusty breads before, this was my first loaf white bread and I am so pleased with the results. I has a little worried when I was making it looking at the sugar amount, but the bread did not turn out overly sweet to my taste at all. also I was worried because the dough seemed very soft, but again, it really came out great. nice texture, crust chewy. I did used my kitchen aid with the dough hook for kneading and it came together fast. Nice rise too. I just took them out of the oven and it was delicious warm with butter. My (picky) 4 year old has already had 2 slices ,asking for it over the cookies I also made today---so that's an endorsement!

Good bread.  Didn't give 5 * because it's not fabulous to me but it is a good bread that I will make again.  The crust came out of the oven HARD and I was very disapointed.  It was golden brown and not over cooked but very hard.  I wrapped the loaves in tin foil over night and when I got up this morning they were soft.  Had 2 pieces for breakfast and the kids each had a sandwich too.  They think it is great.

Excellent recipe. Found the bread to have almost perfect texture; crusty exterior and soft within. I may reduce the sugar a little next time, though that's purely personal taste.

EXCELLENT all around  sandwich bread!  This is my second attempt at making bread with my new mixer and I am so pleased with how this turned out!  The inside is tender and moist while the crust is absolutely perfect!  I can honestly say this is the best all around bread recipe I have ever used!  I followed the recipe to a tee after down sizing it to 1/3 all with absolutely no problem what so ever.

This is a keeper! Finally found a recipe that I've been looking for.Nice and fuffy, not too heavy and you really can't go wrong with this recipe. I made a 1/3 of the recipe because my food processor can only take that much. Didn't really measure all the ingredients accurately,left it too prove for a little too long. The bread still turns out nice! My 19 month son who is normally a fussy eater loves it too! The only thing that I would play with is, mine taste a bit too 'yeasty' but as I said, I didn't measure my ingredients properly + left it to prove for too long, so maybe user error there! Thanks Grandma VanDoren

This was the first time I have ever made bread from scratch and my husband loved it.  I did add a little more sugar.  And....I split into 3 loaves, baked two and made cinnamon rolls with the other.  Absolutely delish!  Next time I make this recipe I am going to try and make it a little more dense as the bread was a little too fluffy.  Can't use it for sandwich bread or french toast.  Great recipe!!

I have NEVER been able to make bread before.  I guess I just don't have the touch.  However, THIS bread worked perfectly.  I had never made a sponge before.  It rose wonderfully and baked up beautifully.  The second time I made it I halved it.  It tastes wonderful too!  Thanks!

My family LOVED this bread.  I make it at least 3 times a week.  My husband raved about it and told all of our friends "It is the greatest bread in the world!"  He made me take a loaf to a pot luck that we had and everybody was asking for the recipe later.  I will always use this recipe.  Too bad we can't give it more than 5 stars.

I just made this recipe and the dough was marvelous to work with.  The texture and the taste are very good.  We had it with homemade beef stew and it held up for the last "dip into the bowl".  What a wonderful recipe to share with others to remember your grandma with!  This is a keeper and one that I will pass along to my 4 daughters.

I made only one loaf and had great results even though my pan was too large.  Total rising time was about 3 hours; kneading took about 10 min.

The bread is slightly sweet and might be mistaken for an egg bread.  Take the loaf out the pan toward the end and the crust will crisp up a bit.  Delicious!

Wow, this is an impressive loaf of bread. I only have two loaf pans, so I used one packet of yeast and around 4 or 5 total cups of flour. Turned out lovely and moist, with a great crust. My boyfriend thinks im a superstar, if only he knew how simple this bread was. Oh, as a hint, I let my bread rise in a dry dishwasher with a pot of hot water, works quick!

I love this recipie. I have attempted to make over the years, but they have'nt been very successful. I found this recipie easy and very rewarding. Totally fool proof. I found the first time i made it, mixing the flour in was hard, so the second time I made it, it put al the flour on the bench, then poured the sponge onto the flour and slowly kneaded in in. thanks for a great recipie.....:-)

WOW!  This is the only homemade white bread my kids will eat.  It's so fluffy, unlike the heavy stuff I always made before.  For this recipe, I used unbleached flour and a tablespoon and a half of the powdered dough enhancer you can get at your local kitchen supply store.  I'm also an impatient bread maker so I used my favorite brand of rapid-rise yeast with great results.  This was ecxellent!  The only white bread recipe I'll ever use again.

This recipe was very simple and it turned out great.  It was my first attempt at making bread without my bread machine, very pleased with the outcome.  One thing that would have helped would have been a little bit of time frames for the rising parts.  My husband loved it and is ready for more.  Hope I didn't get myself in trouble with this bread thing. :-)

This bread is great!  Mine came out pretty dense, maybe because I used the rapid rise yeast since I have no patience.  I like my bread heavy though, so that's fine with me, and this stuff tasted like my late grandma's dinner rolls.  I even made my own butter to go with it, and let me say, EVERYONE was insanely impressed!

I divided this recipe by 3 to make only 1 loaf.  It worked perfectly and tasted fabulous.  I used quick-rise yeast and was generous with the salt and sugar (slightly heaping measures).  I baked it about 25-30 minutes before covering with foil.  And put it in for an additional 3-5 minutes after that.  Try allowing butter to melt over the top of it when removing from oven to add foil, and again when it is finished baking. 
Great recipe!

I don't usually eat white bread, but this bread is awesome!  I'm not sure if I could truly rate this recipe because I made a lot of changes.  For starters, I only made 1/6 of the recipe because I intended to use homemade bread for french toast tomorrow morning.  I didn't have any bread flour, so I just used All-Purpose.  I also forgot to add the oil, but it turned out fine.  I filled a pan with hot water and placed it on the floor of my oven for the first 10-15 minutes of baking so I would get a crusty loaf of bread.  Since I cut the recipe down significantly, I only needed to bake it for 25 minutes.  Also, I don't own a loaf pan, so I just shaped the loaf and put it on a greased cookie sheet.  This is great bread!

I'm a lazy breadmaker. I throw everything in my food processor, process it 40 seconds or so. Let it rise in the processor, punch it down, throw it in a pan, let it rise again and bake it. Not all recipes can handle such a careless baking technique but this one comes out perfectly and is delicious. I have a loaf cooling on my counter now so my granddaughter can have warm bread for a snack when she gets home from school. This has become one of our favorite bread recipes.

I used 7 cups of bread flour and 1 of whole wheat and buttered the tops of the loaves when they came out of the oven.  It was wonderful!

I love Grandma VanDoren!!!! I scaled down the recipe to make 1 loaf, followed recipe exactly, baked for 30 minutes, and didn't have to cover to keep from overbrowning. The texture and taste were perfect. I will not be making the 3 loaf recipe unless I plan on sharing because my husband and I will eat entirely too much of it. Yes, I will be making this many more times.

I have made this recipe repeatedly because it is delicious, cheap to make, and it gets rave reviews. I have made it exactly following the recipe and it doesn't disappoint, but I typically add extra gluten and dough conditioner when I make it because bread flour is hard to come by.
This bread is delightfully light and fluffy with a bit of chewiness to it. It is definitely a dessert bread when compared to rustic breads, but no one complains when it is served with sandwiches or as toast. It just disappears and brings smiles.

I make a whole wheat bread that also uses the "sponge" rise so the whole wheat flour can soften, so this was not new to me.
I cut this recipe in half as I live alone. I baked it in an 11 X 4-1/2 inch pan, perfect size loaf for half the recipe. Excellent texture and color, was fully baked in just under 30 minutes. Tastes wonderful! This is my new to go recipe for white bread. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great white sandwich bread recipe! The only changes that I made were to let my KitchenAid knead the dough, rather than to hand knead it. I made the  initial sponge with the yeast, as per the recipe. I did add a little bit more yeast than the recipe called for, so I did not let it rest a long time before adding the other 4 cups of flour. The initial sponge rose quite rapidly. After this I followed the recipe completely, and had three wonderful loaves of white bread. I will use this recipe often.

I will never make another other bread, this recipe is what I have been looking for,  The instructions are a little different than the video. put 4 cups flour into the bread mixture, then 4 on the counter where you will kneed the dough use all the flour on counter to get the right texture while kneeding,  It will be runny to start with but the flour on the counter will make it just right. to kneed push forward on the dough and bring in corners and continue to kneed till all the flour is gone.

Absolutely delicious!!! I halved the recipe and made I large loaf in a larger longer bread pan and it turned out perfect!!! Within minutes after cooking half the loaf was already gone!! This is very close and almost spot on to my "All purpose bread dough" recipe I have used for years.

I have searched and made numerous homemade bread recipes hoping to find that  'WOW'  factor. Well my search is over! An incredible recipe and I have now closed the book on bread searching.  This dough is so light, soft and easy and the bread is amazing. I may keep this recipe under wraps but maybe not as long as Grandma.  Thank you

I followed this recipe to a "t" to try it out. I used the largest glass bowl I own and about 30 minutes into the first rise (sponge stage) it was about to over flow my bowl. So I punched it down lightly to let it rise a little longer. This is a HUGE recipe! Before the second rise I decided we would make 2 loaves and 1 recipe of cinnamon rolls from this massive quantity of dough. All turned out wonderfully. The bread has a low crumb, which is perfect in my opinion, and just the right amount of chewy-ness. Love it!

I have used this recipe for about 4 years now and each time I make a batch it gets better (practice makes perfect) I always mix it in my kitchen add and when I am not in a hurry let it rise twice for a fluffier loaf.  I have let it set in the fridge a day or two before useing it all and it still is great. the only thing i have changed is decrease the sugar to one forth cup unless i want to make cinnamon  rolls and all purpose flour is great. I use it for everything thing now pizza, bread sticks, carmal or cinnamon rolls, dinner rolls and of course bread. it's a great recipe and reminds me of my grandmother's bread however grandma just made bread and never used a recipe. Thanks for sharing it has become my household favorite.

I decided to start making my own bread after reading labels on the store bought sliced bread. I like knowing exactly what's going into my bread. And this is a wonderful bread recipe! This is only my second time making bread but this was really good. I substituted vegetable oil for coconut oil and 2 cups of whole wheat flour out of the 8. Other than that I followed the recipe. I will be making this bread again very soon.

This is an awesome recipe.  It was a toss up between this and another bread recipe from this site after reading the response it was a no brainer.  If you are looking for a good bread recipe that is hard to mess up and turns out great then this is the recipe for you.

To say I'm an amateur baker is an understatement.  I was raised with a grandmother who made home made biscuits for every meal but I'd never even seen loaves of bread be made nor did I even understand what all went into it. I seriously thought you just mixed everything up once, let it rise the threw it in the oven. With that being say, making bread the first time was an experience. I was impatient and exhausted by the end from all of the hurry up and wait. However, the first batch (and my first time baking) turned out amazing. Now I bake this bread almost every Sunday, and I've learned not to stress about how long steps take. I do a step, do a chore, do another step and so on. I've aldo started adding all kinds of things to this base receipe. I roll one loaf out long and cover it with butter, cinnamon and sugar then roll it up for cinnamon bread. I kneed in garlic salt and parsley and then roll the loave in it too for garlic bread. Most recently I added cheese, bacon and dried onions. As the loaves come out of the oven I'm trying to decide who gets what because the entire family now expects a loaf of bread on Sunday.

I made this in my KA. We enjoyed it but it was a bit too sweet for my taste. I made 2/3 of the recipe, 1/3 was the loaf and the other 1/3  I made into cinnamon buns. This recipe worked well for the buns as it was a tad sweet. I loved the texture and will make it again but will scale back the sugar considerably. Thanks for sharing.

SO EASY! This is a delicious, light bread that rises quickly. Each step says you should wait about an hour in the video, however, I found that each step really only took 30-35 minutes. I think what makes this bread so great is the sponge rising technique. I yielded three high loaves of bread with this recipe. This is quite an easy recipe, especially if you have a mixer. I sent off one fresh loaf of this bread to a relative today! This is a bread recipe I am keeping and will be sharing with others :-)  Note: You can also use all-purpose flour and the bread will still taste totally fine.

Not really sure what went wrong.... I had such high hopes for this recipe.... after reading it and watching the video...but, it was one of the most disgusting breads I've ever had in my life.... extremely dense and smelled and tasted like beer. Not for me.

Actually really easy with a KitchenAide. I follow the recipe exactly but for baking only had mini loaf pans. Made 4mini loaves, a pan of cinnamon rolls and froze enough dough to make 3 more mini loaves later out of 1 recipe.

Thank you for sharing this!!! I've been making bread for years but this was the best I've made.  My 7 yr old was wanting to make bread like they did in "pioneer" days and I didn't want to figure that out so we gave this a try.  WOW I am so glad we did.  The only negative thing I have to say about this is that it completely ruined my diet.

I have been making this bread on a semi regular basis for two years. Everyone I make it for loves it. It may not be extremely flavorful but it is definitely reliable. I once followed another reviewers suggestion to double the yeast to halve the rising time when I was pinched for time. This worked great and my bread still came out nice and fluffy. I have used this dough for cinnamon rolls and used the baked bread as the base for a french toast casserole after it has started to stale. I always use only all purpose flour. This recipe easily halves or thirds for smaller portions.

Great texture, light and fluffy, not dense at all. A little bland but still very delicious.

Tried this recipe for the first time after trying a few others, and this is by far the best. I cooked the loaves a little longer than suggested and it improved the colour, crust, taste and texture. It's the only recipe I will now use. The flour used can be a mix of all purpose, strong white and wholemeal in any combination you prefer.

For two years I have been looking for my favorite "go to" white bread recipe and I've tried about twenty others... But this is it! I've made this recipe about 10 times now and it is consistently just wonderful. Light, fluffy loaf with a fine crumb while still managing to be substantial but never dense or heavy. I will continue to use this recipe. My family absolutely loves it but I'm the one who gets the first delicious, buttered slice, still warm from the oven.

I did this receipe a couple of times, and I really like for breakfast as it is a sweet bred.
I don`t use dry yeast but frexh one as it is much better.
30g of fresh yeast for 8 cups of flour. I think it is important to put the salt as last ingredient as salt may kill the yeast if enter in direct contact. If your dough didn`t rise That may be the reason for it!

I bake bread at least 2 times a week. Have been doing this for 57 years. I love this recipe. It is old fashioned and really good. Turns out like bread is supposed to turn out. Thank you for sharing this. It is truly a treasure.

My dad was an avid bread maker, making much of the bread we ate.  I never got his recipe, as he kept it in his head.  I have made this bread several times now, and enjoy every loaf.  It is so very close to the bread that dad always made. Thank you for sharing this remarkable recipe, as it brings back so many fond memories of my dad, and sitting down with him to eat warm bread right out of the oven.

This is absolutely the best bread recipe I have ever made. With one recipe, I made one large loaf,one dozen buns and one dozen cinnamon rolls. The texture is amazing and this will be the only bread recipe I use from now on.

My family LOVES this bread!!! I can't emphasize enough to get those wonderful recipes from Grandmothers, Greatgrandmothers!!! Or like the lady with the alive recipe, it was lost when she passed....
Instead of Oil for this recipe, I substitute Organic Coconut Oil(melted in the microwave about 20 seconds) the bread has come out perfect every time! Now if I could just figure out how to make cinnamon brown sugar rolls with it????!!! I've seen some reviews say pizza dough and rolls....Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Easy & delish! I followed the recipe but did add ground flax for fiber : D I always put a pan of water at the bottom of the oven when baking bread, the steam gives the bread a wonderful crust!

This bread recipe is the one I've been looking for to use in my bread machine.  I cut the recipe back to 12 servings, and it made the perfect size loaf in the machine.  Has great texture and is very light.  Makes wonderful toast!

This recipe is super easy and produces delicious (and consistent) results that you will be proud to call homemade. I too had a grandmother who baked amazing bread but she passed when I was 12. I never had the chance to write down her recipe and I've hunted for a similar recipe to recreate her 'loaves of love' throughout my entire adult life. I had another recipe that I was using prior to finding this one and it gave me loaves that were dense. Even  baking with steam produced from a pan of water at the bottom of the oven couldn't prevent  tops that cracked every single time. In addition to being delicious, VanDoren's recipe creates soft bread that tastes just like I remember and doesn't ever crack when I pull it out of the oven.  You won't be disappointed; bookmark this page and make this recipe today!!!!!

I make this every week for my family and I will never go back to buying bread.  I have tried multiple recipes and this one is perfect.  I love at high altitude and had trouble getting my bread to rise appropriately.  No one in my family like bread that is too dense so the trick for me was heat.  Since it is winter, I park my dough in front of our warm fireplace during both rise times and it comes out perfect every time.  In the summer, I am hoping a little mountain sunshine will do the same.  Thanks for the perfect bread recipe!

We followed the recipe to the letter - it was perfect!  It is incredibly soft like store-bought bread!  It doesn't take much time to make and the kids love it.  My husband called me from work twice to tell me how good it was and how excited he was that we finally found the perfect bread recipe!  Thank you Marilyn for sharing you grandmother's secret!

I ran out of bread.  4 days until payday.   I tried a different recipe and of course I ruined it. Found this one and read through the reviews, but the video convinced me.  

It's amazing!!!! I am the world's absolute worst cook, and it turned out amazing! I did it all by hand. Tell Grandma VanDoren thank you!!!  And whoever made the video... Big thanks for that.  It really helped to see what it should look like.   I cut the recipe in half  using "change servings"   It would have made 2 loaves, but I made one loaf and made cinnamon rolls out of the other one. They turned out so yummy.  The crust of the loaf was crispy and the inside was fluffy and perfect.  Definitely will work in the toaster or the panini press too. 

Definitely tasts like grandma used to make!

This is a very dense, but very good, white bread. It held up to dipping into clam chowder and was still light enough for my guy's sandwiches. LOVED it, and so did the kids! Not only did it TASTE good, but it felt great to make fresh bread from scratch -- I should have tried using some of this for french toast, but by the time I thought of it I didn't have enough for our brood :)

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time was with 4c bread flour 4c white flour, and it turned out great. This time I made it with 4c stone ground wheat flour 4c white flour. I've not tasted it with the wheat flour yet, but the first time I made this bread it was delicious. 

Some people have mentioned getting no rise/poof from their loaves. Maybe they had dead yeast, because I've never had a problem with rising. I always add the yeast to warm water, give it a quick stir, then add the sugar, salt, and oil, another quick stir, and then gently stir in the first 4c of flour. I tend to forget about bread while it's rising, so the "time" involved isn't really that big of a loss to me. I always just let it go for a while and do other stuff around the house. 

I would suggest that people put an oven thermometer to check their oven temps- mine cooks about 50 degrees hot, so I had one loaf get burnt the first time around. 

All in all, this is a very good and simple recipe, and I will be making it regularly.

Perfect. I used this recipe as a base for my cinnamon bread. All it needed for the sweeter bread was the extra sugar. Love it!

I followed a reviewer's advice and made half of this dough into cinnamon rolls.  Very nice and soft, like the ones at the bakery.  Bread was nice and soft and rose well.  I mixed it using my 6 qt. Ktchenaid so very little hand kneading was required.  Made it really fast that way.

LOVE this recipe. It does take an afternoon at home to make it, but soooo worth it. I did a step, did some chores, did another step, etc. Only change I made was I used 1/3 cup of Agave instead of the white sugar. Was nice too, because 1 split mine into 2 for loaves of bread and 1 for a pizza crust. Makes AWESOME pizza crust, but be sure you have plenty of people to eat it, because it makes an extra-large pizza.

Great recipe!  The tecture of the flour dough was soft and spongy and so so easy to work with. With the cost of bread so high now, home made bread is the way to go. Thank you Marilyn for sharing this wonderfully east and delicious recipe.

Bread was really good, family gobbled it up! I coated my pans and top of loaves with cornmeal. I just love the flavor it adds plus it's great to keep the bread from sticking. Next time I think I'll make it a touch sweeter. Also, it's best stored in a paper bag . If you store in in plastic moisture will build up and cause it to miold quickly.

I made this bread today and even though I didn't have quite enough yeast as called for on hand, I chanced it... I am a very inexperienced bread baker however, this recipe was WONDERFUL. Light, airy, yum... I had two very picky eater children as my quality assurance team ... and they had 2 pieces each as soon as it was cool enough to cut.  I will make this again the directions were great.  I didn't think we would eat 3 loaves before they would go bad, so on the recommendation of other reviewers here I made two loaves and the third portion I rolled out and made cinnamon buns.... they were great too! Although I will cook those a little less time next time.  Topped with Cream cheese icing and they were delicious. Thanks for sharing your Grandma's Recipe!!

Great basic bread recipe. I like this better than the Amish White bread recipe on this site. The crust is chewy and the bread is much lighter.

I find that adding 1/2c warm water & 1/2c buttermilk (instead of 1c warm water) makes this bread perfect! It's a bit on the dry side without buttermilk.

Tasty! This was my first time making bread without my mom holding my hand through it, haha, only took me 22 years :)

I didn't have the right yeast, so I used what I did have (3 packets of rapid rise) and it turned out nicely!

Used 2/3 for bread and the last 1/3 I rolled out flat, brushed with melted butter, sprinkled with a brown sugar/cinnamon/glazed walnut mix, rolled, sliced, and made cinnamon rolls! Baked the rolls for 15 mins and they turned out awesome too!

If I had more than five stars I would use it. The dough is quite soft so I put it in the fridge for about two hours, shaped the loaf and then let it come back to room temp before popping in the oven. Thank you for sharing your family recipe....DELISH!!!!

This is the best bread I've ever made - bar none!! Before I added my own twist, I made it according to your recipe... My family loves it! I've also tried making it with 2.5 cups of whole wheat flour replacing some of the white and have had success! This recipe doubles well and freezes excellently. Thank you for sharing your grandma's recipe... it has become a treasured part of our family's recipe book too!

This was fantastic on many levels. It was easy to make and had a fantastic flavor. I used all-purpose flour and let it rise an hour between each step. The loaves turned out beautifully and got raves all around! Thank you for sharing this!

I can only give this 4 stars so far. My dough is currently going through it's first rise. I am only making a half recipe, as 3 loaves is more than my family needs right now. I'm just making this for fun.  I did note that the flour wasn't enough. I had about 1 cup extra. This might be because of the weather, it's cloudy and has been raining off and on all day. Also, I used a Kitchen Aid mixer to mix and do most of the kneading. I will be making homemade butter to go with this. But aside from needing extra flour, this seems like a really good recipe to have on hand. I can't wait to see the finished product.

After going through many bread recipes I finally decided to give this one a try.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  After making the sponge I could only add about 2 cups of flour to the sponge and the recipe calls for 8 cups total.  Not sure how anyone would get 8 cups into this dough without adding more liquids.  I ended up splitting the dough into three but really should have only divided it up twice.  I made one batch of rolls, a loaf of bread and cheesy bread. They all turned out great.  For cheesy bread I made inch dough balls rolled them in melted butter, than parmesan and layered into tube pan, sprinkling cheddar cheese in between layers...it was the fav of the three!!

I used this recipe to make my Jalapeno Cheddar Bread, and am I glad I did!!  This turned out wonderful.  I scaled the recipe for one loaf, and mixed in my bread machine.  I then rolled it out and put a layer of shredded Cheddar cheese, then scattered a few Jalapeno slices randomly.  I then rolled up pressing firmly to get out all air pockets, sealed the ends and tucked underneath, and put in bread pan for second rise.  Baked at 350 for 35 minutes, and this was perfect.  Thanks Marilyn for sharing your family recipe!!

Very good bread. It is a bit dense but I like it that way personally. It reminds me of what my mum used to bake. Great hot with just a dab of butter.

Absolutely delicious, thank you for sharing your Grandma's recipe!  This is the best white bread recipe I've ever made and it's so easy.  It's a cool damp Autumn day, so I added another half cup flour, used my kitchen aid to do the mixing and kneading, I hand kneaded it about a minute before placing it in a greased bowl to rise. The crust is a little chewy (which we like) and the inside is as light as a feather!  Two floured thumbs up!!!

I just made this the other day and it was only my second attempt to make homemade bread.  Two of my three loaves flopped (my fault) but the third one rose.  The bread is simply delicious.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This turned out wonderful. I made 2 loafs of bread and used the rest to make Cinnamon Rolls. Wow everyone loved the cinnamon Rolls. Even was told, that it was better then the ones you get at the stores. Thank you so much.

This bread is awesome!! I was using the traditional white bread recipe from this site and was finding it heavy and dense, but this one turns out light and fluffy every time, my family loves it! I make it according to the directions given, but I use all purpose flour......thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This recipe is great. It's my first time to make white bread, it is so easy. I just follow the procedures step by step. Make some modifications on my bread, I made 1 loaf with my left-over pesto and cheese. The other one as dinner rolls w/ some cheese. The last one just plain white bread. I also brushed milk on top of the bread and it did not turn brown. All breads turned out great, it was soft and delicious. My daughter love it. Thank you grandma for sharing your recipe.

I thought this was a very good bread, but I would have like it to be a little "less airy".  Maybe to achieve this I won't take it through 3 rises.   The flavor was fabulous so I will try again.  Thanks Grandma VanDoren!

Superb bread.  This has replaced store bought white bread in my house.  I am a novice breadmaker and this was so easy to make.   It also cooked great from freezer.  I sat it out at 8 am and it was ready to go in the oven at 5 pm.  Next time, I will double the recipe so I have lots to freeze.

My family loved it! I used a fast acting yeast and could have got away with using only 2 TB. I also ended up using more flour in the end but I didn't have any bread flour on hand so I used all purpose. I came out with 4 loafs of bread so I turned one into a cinnamon raisin bread. I sent a loaf and some honey with my husband to work and it didn't last 20 minutes!

This bread is fantastic!  I adapted the recipe for use in a bread machine by cutting the serving size to 8, for a one pound loaf.  I mixed the water, yeast, oil and sugar in the bread pan and allowed it to sponge for 10 minutes.  Then added the flour (substituted bread flour) and salt.  baked on the basic cycle and it was absolutely delicious.  Many thanks to Mrs. Van-Doren for sharing such a wounderful recipe.

I made this recipe according to the instructions but in an electric mixer with honey instead of sugar, a water bath on the bottom rack, and made one of the loaves into a cinnamon and sugar swirl loaf. I also brushed with butter when I removed them from the oven to cool. This is the best bread I have ever had- I couldn't leave it alone when it was still warm because it's so moist and light. Thanks very much for sharing this- I will be making bread this way from now on!

This is an excellent bread that is great for making toast and putting a little jelly or honey on. It seemed to rise slowly, so have patience and it will be rewarded.

Wonderful wonderful wonderful!  I'm a bread baker, I'm picky.  This was by far the softest, best bread recipe I've ever come across.  It was almost so soft you had to really be careful cutting it.  I mixed the yeast and water and let it sit for about 20 minutes and it never doubled so I dumped it into the Bosch Mixer and mixed it with half the flour like the recipe said and then tried to proof it, to see it rise and it did bubble so I knew the yeast took and was good.  I added the rest of the flour in, mixed well, let it rise for about an hour, shaped into loaves, let them rise about another hour and baked.  When they came out, I dusted some of them with melted butter and whalaa!  The best bread ever.  Just don't be in a hurry when you make this one.  While it's rising, do the dishes, pick up your feet, watch some tv and it'll be ready to bake before you knowit.

So glad I came across this recipe!  I have been searching and  trying different recipe to get a good homemade sandwich type bread.  So far this is by far the best.  It's light and airy and not dense and thick like most loaf bread recipes I have made.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

The instructions on this recipe seem incomplete - I never got the "sponge" described in step 1 and it didn't double in size either.  The bread did taste okay even though it didn't rise properly.  Next time I will proof the yeast before adding other ingredients.

Fantastic! I have tried countless bread recipes over the past months, making a new recipe every week trying to find the right one. I have tried complicated ones where I had to melt butter to a certain temp even and those all turned out no where near as good as this recipe and this recipe was very easy!!! This is the first bread I will be able to slice and make sandwiches with. Turns out soft and wonderful and I cannot tell you how happy I am to not have to look for a recipe anymore! I divided this in half so it made a batch of buns for bbq's and 2 loaves of bread.
I also add bacon bits and cheddar cheese after it has risen to make a great breakfast toast.
UPDATE: I have now begun using half white flour and half fresh ground whole wheat flour. It still turns out great and most as long as you kneed long enough for the gluten to get elastic! I don't even have to add potatoe flakes or dough enhancer with this recipe. I began putting all the dry ingredients premeasured into zip lock bags. Then just proof the yeast and add bacon grease and it is ready to go.

This is my go-to white bread recipe - everyone always seems to love it.  Made it as rolls rolled in cornmeal for Thanksgiving, and it was a hit as always.  Works well to add roasted garlic cloves for a great garlic bread recipe as well.

This bread is just wonderful. I don't like using white sugar in my bread so I substituted with honey. I made 2 loaves and a pan of rolls. I've baked a lot of bread but never with a texture so nice.   Thank you for the recipe!

I had never made bread in my life (or cooked much of anything else) before making this. The directions were easy to follow and my loaves turned out perfectly. My boyfriend and 5 of his friends were around at the time and all 3 loaves disappeared within a few minutes. Thank you so so so much! Will be making this many times over. :-)

This was a very nice tasting bread, but a little crumbly and light for my taste. I prefer a more dense bread, especially for sandwiches. This is a good dinner bread, and if sliced thick, is good toasted with jam, but won't hold up to hard butter.

I made two loaves instead of three.  I live in FL so it's a lot more humid here.  Because of that, I used 5 cups of flour (3c white, 2c wheat because I ran out of white) and then baked it for 33 mins uncovered.  The top got just enough brown and the center was so moist.  I will be using this recipe a lot!

I made this in the bread machine and used 1/3 of the recipe for my machine.  It worked perfectly and was incredible.  I'll be using this again!  Next time I may bake in my oven rather than the machine for a better shaped loaf.

I like this recipe! Easy to make.  The bread's texture is soft even overnight without freezing.  I use half white and half wheat all-purpose flour.  Highly recommended.

This recipe gave me possibly the most beautiful looking loaves I have ever made. I only have 2 loaf tins so made 8 rolls with the other portion of dough and used them as burger rolls. This is a great sandwich bread and didn't last long. My husband and daughter number one devoured 3/4 of a loaf between them in one sitting. The only slight negative for me was that it was a little too sweet for my taste but that's easily resolved. Thankyou so much for sharing your family recipe.

I make a super-healthy version with all whole wheat bread, olive oil and honey (I'm making it now).  Before the last rise, I divide in third's and make one into a loaf shape, one third into sandwich bread rounds and the other third into rolls.  I wrap in wax paper then put in a plastic bag and put this in the freezer.  Then I take out what I need, let it thaw and rise (a few hours for a loaf, one hour for sandwich   rounds, 1/2 hour for rolls) and I have freshly baked bread all the time.  The frozen dough makes great gifts - friends will love how it makes their kitchens smell.  Try spreading dough for 1 loaf with 1/2 C brown sugar mixed with 1 Tbl. cinnamon.  Roll up, put in loaf pan, let rise final time & bake.  Scrumptious.

I make this bread a lot and it always turns out great.  I only use have the sugar called for and it's perfect and not sweet.  Sometimes I use honey instead of sugar. Also have made whole wheat/oatmeal bread with this recipe.  Just omit AP flour and sub in the others. Usually have to add more whole wheat to make a nice dough.  Fool-proof recipe!!!  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent- I have made it several times with equal results!  This is also a basic, easy bread to incorporate "add-ins" such as pepper-parmesan or dill.

Wow! I just made this recipe this morning. I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out because it was so sticky during the kneading and I had to keep adding flour beyond the 6 1/2 cups called for. Best guess would be almost another cup during kneading. However, this was THE BEST white bread recipe I've come across in a long time. Good job Grandma VanDoren!! :))

I like this bread because it was easy, Baked up nicely in my uneven oven.  Texture was light and fluffy.

I found it to be bland though. But I think adding a little more salt  and some herbs can perk this loaf right on up.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

Really good and easy.  I made a few errors while interpreting the directions and it still came out beautiful and delicious.  It was sweetened perfectly and it had a really nice crust...

This bread is wonderful! I am so excited. It is so very easy and gets better each time I make it. (Practice makes perfect.) I usually just bake up one loaf at a time and freeze the others before the last rise. Then I let them rise in the oven. When it has risen enough, I let the oven preheat with the bread in it and shorten the baking time by about five minutes. Absolutely wonderful!!!! This dough also makes great dinner rolls and cinnamon rolls. Thanks so much for sharing this!!!!!

This is a fantastic recipe.  The bread is soft, crust is soft.  Great for sandwiches or just eating.  Makes the best grilled cheese sandwiches ever! I didn't change a thing and received many compliments. Suggestion: Use a Kitchen Aid mixer to mix and knead dough.

I've made this twice now.  The first time I made 3 loaves and the second time I made one BIG loaf in a large pan.  The only other change has been using AP flour instead of bread flour. Both times I got a nice soft interior with a chewy crust - the first smaller loaves were a bit denser, but family says both were GREAT.

WOW WOW WOW I followed the directions exactly as written (used 4 pkgs rapid yeast) and this bread is so good!!! My son tasted it and said, "Can we have this bread everyday for the rest of our lives"?!   I made 2 regular sized loaves(cooked for 40 minutes) and 4 mini loaves(cooked for 30 minutes) and my family is sure going to be glad, I am giving them a couple mini loaves for Christmas!

This bread was fabulous! So easy to make, too. My boyfriend woke me up at 2 AM just to tell me it was awesome. For people that are having trouble with the bread rising, try proofing your yeast first by combining just the sugar, water, and yeast. When the mixture starts to look foamy it means that your yeast is alive and well. Then you can make the sponge. I had no problems with rising. Thanks for this recipe, Grandma VanDoren!

I made two batches of this bread, they both turned out perfect.  I made one batch into three types of loaves, plain, cinnamon and what I called my Smore's Loaf for my grandsons PB&J sandwiches, give them a bit of a taste change.  I also made the best cinnamon rolls, handed out to three different areas...perfect.  Very light, yet perfect texture. 

Thanks for such an easy recipe with great results.

Great bread. It was very easy to make compared to other white bread recipes. It probably only took 20 minutes of my times with a total of 2 hrs from start to eating! It rose very fast. It is very yeasty, which is fine by me. The crust was very flaky and flavorful. Terrific!

Outstanding!! I made this bread for the first time today and I received rave reviews from my husband and 3 year old daughter! And believe me, they are two very picky eaters! I used the rapid yeast because I am so impatient,  rushed the process and in doing so, it still baked up light and perfect. I began the sponging process but couldn't wait that long, so I decided against it and added all of the flour to it after it sat for only about ten minutes. I basically rushed the entire process and it still came out wonderful. Excellent recipe, will use for years to come!!

We have a really big family, so I "sextupled" the recipe--six times--and made 22 loaves. I wanted it to last a while. It's great!! We used half wheat flour, so the bread was a little denser, but it's still really good. Next time I might make it with a little less wheat, but I was surprised at how well it turned out since we made so much. thanks!!

This bread was excellent, made a double batch for a family gathering and all six loaves just seemed to vanish! It was a little bit sweet for my liking, but obviously everyone else liked it! I did replace half of the flour for whole wheat, and I was worried that it was going to be a little bit too heavy, but it was just right. Definitely going to be a staple in my recipe book!

it was fun to make, and I've never made bread before, and on one of the loafs I added cheese to the top of it while it was cooking, which added a nice little zest.

I love this recipe and everyone whose tasted this bread also loves it.  Notably, for those who might like their bread a little more dense in texture, they should allow the first and second rises to collapse, or to rise for extended periods of time.  The final rise will be much slower, so it takes a bit more time.  But it works out great if you can't get to the batter right away, and it's a nice change in texture with the same great taste.

A very very good white bread, generally easy to make and very tasty!  Perfect for sandwiches or just warmed and with butter.  I love your grandma!

This bread was very tasty.  I ate it right out of the oven with some strawberry jam and it was really good.  I ended up eating half of one of the loaves all by myself.  Then my husband came home and almost finished it off.

This was a very good recipe.  I really like making the sponge, it helped make the bread nice and light.  I did add about 2T of half and half for the milkfat.
Yummy!!!!

I love this! This bread is so incredibly easy to make & is wonderfully fluffy & light. The mixture was a bit dry so I added a little bit of scalded milk.

It has a WONDERFUL flavor but it took forever to raise.  The loaves came out very dense.  I started this about 12 noon and finally had the loaves partially raised and baked at 10 pm.  Don't know what happened because everyone said it raised quickly.  My yeast is good because I used it the day before with another bread recipe and it worked great.  I probable will try this again and shape the loaves the second raising instead of the 3rd time.  Thanks - it does taste great.

This bread was awesome!  It tasted great, and had a great texture as well.  Only problem that I had was that it rises fast!  And when i went to check on it, it had exploded over the sides of the bowl!  Oh well...  was still great.  Just need to check on it sooner next time.  There will definitely be a next time.

This is the best bread recipe that I have EVER used and I have tried alot! The bread turns out unbelievably soft and FAST to make!  I have given this recipe out to 6 different people already. The only thing I would change is to make 4 loaves instead of 3. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!

WOW!!! this bread is fantastic. I was very sceptical at first, 3Tbs of yeast seemed like an incredible amount. The rise times where so short I thought the flavor would not have had enough time to develope. But I was very pleasantly suprised. I can't wait to make this in the winter.(my other recipes take forever to rise in the winter but I'll bet this one won't=)   Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

I've made this several times and it always turns out great.  Sometimes the dough seems a little sticky, but it doesn't seem to affect the outcome.

Just made it this evening. I scaled the ingredients down to make 2 loaves. Scrumptious! I baked one loaf and used the rest of my dough to roll out a pan of cinnamon buns. This is the best white bread recipe I've ever used. I've been baking bread for 25 years....so that says a lot about how wonderful this bread is. Thanks for sharing.

Maybe i made this bread wrong, but i thought i followed the instructions to the dot- My bread absolutley refused to rise, and i could barely knead in half of the last cup of flour to the dough. Very stiff, and tried to let it rise over 4 hours, and it barely puffed up. Ended up with an okay bread, but they were rather dense and small loaves. Ive got to find the trick to making my breads rise better.

EXCELLENT bread.  Follow the directions and you will get the most amazing bread.  I have made bread many, many, many times before and I have to say this is the easiest recipe to follow.  I slathered butter all over the top of the loaves after twenty minutes of cooking, and then I let it cook the rest of the way.  I didn't find it time consuming for "homemade" bread.  It's really worth the effort.

I have to thank Grandma Van Doren for this wonderful recipe, bless her heart. I've been trying to make bread for so long and couldn't even get the wonderful "aroma" everyone says comes with making white bread. This one has it all, aroma, ease and TASTE! I forgot to grease the pans and still they came out great. I also failed to cut the dough into 3 equal parts, making 3 very dissimilar size loaves, but all are lovely. THE TASTE is so good! Toasted, plain, buttered etc, all are perfect. I was thinking about cutting down on the sugar or increasing the salt as someone mentioned here. I'm so glad I changed nothing, it's just perfect! Thanks again, I'll be making this often (it's only one day and we already polished off a loaf and a half (and that's only 2 people!)

Easy and delicious!  I have been making bread for a long time and this one has to be the best!  The recipe is also very versatile.  I made two loaves and 12 dinner rolls.  I will definitely make this recipe again and share it with others!  Thanks grandma!

Excellent white bread! I used a stand mixer with a dough hook and let it kneed for about 5 minutes. The texture is perfect and the bread has a great fresh taste. This recipe is a keeper.

I cut this recipe down to 1/3, increased the flour to 3 cups and increased the oil (in this case, I used butter) to 3 tablespoons.  Used milk instead of water. After the first rise, instead of making a loaf, I rolled it to 1/4" thick square and cut it in 9 smaller squares.  Filled them with ham and cheese, rolled them into mini hot dog buns, let rise and baked till golden.  Husband and kids loved them.

I scaled this recipe down to just one loaf and it was great!  This was basically my first try at homemade bread and I only had 2 packets of yeast which was only enough for 1 loaf.  I also freeform baked it on my bread stone instead of in a pan.  I have to get to the store to get more yeast so I can make the full recipe.

Good tender bread with crusty exterior. Tasted great along side the vegetable soup I prepared. I would cut down on the salt the next time. I suspect that this bread would be great toasted on the stove top or used in making seasoned croutons and bread crumbs!

Excellent bread! I have made this many times, it is now our family's staple bread recipe. I have substituted different flours and I have added wheat germ with fantastic results, adding oatmeal however made for a very dry loaf! Two thumbs up!

I made it as the recipe states with the exception. Of the bread flour I used AP flour since that’s all I had and it was great.

This was my first attempt at making bread, but I've watched other people do it on TV  ;-)  

It came out perfectly, but ....... I substituted honey for sugar, and I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour.  When I finished mixing, it seemed a bit too wet (possibly from using honey rather than sugar?) so I added about another 1/2 cup of flour until it looked like what I perceived to be the correct consistency.  

WOW, this is a mighty sticky bread dough.  It was difficult, but I finally got it into 3 small loaf pans and put them in the oven.  

My house smelled AWESOME while it was baking.  The top browned nicely.  I removed the loaves about 4 minutes early, I'm always afraid I'll overcook everything. 

EUREKA !  I cut a couple of slices ..... perfect.  The bread is absolutely delicious.  My wife was impressed, so that's cool too.  I should have waited for Valentines day.

This bread is amazing!! I’ve been looking for a a recipe that comes close to the bread at our local bakery, and this is almost exactly like it!! The first loaf I did turned out perfectly, but since that loaf, they have all fallen when in the oven, and I haven’t done anything different, so not sure what’s going on. Anyway, it’s an amazing recipe!!

This is the first recipe that the yeast really raised well for me. Also, my dough was sticky and wet, so I just added a little bit of flour at a time and it seemed to work. I just need to figure out how my oven and the recipe will work together and which of my bread pans I like best. My husband loves it when I make homemade recipes.  We are a family of 5 so I almost need to make a double batch. I also will use this bread for packed lunches in the future.

This is an excellent, basic white bread. Comfort food doesn't get any better than this. This bread has a tender crumb, yet, is sturdy enough to slice thinly once cooled. This is the perfect sandwich bread.

No changes in this fabulous, fast recipe. Made two bread pans and Light crust, airy texture and wonderful, fresh taste. Not dense, but holds its own. Bonus for me was clean slices with little or no crumbs. Thanks you for sharing.

This turned out beautifully for me as I used my Kitchen-Aid glass bowl mixer during each process.  Having Arthritis hand-kneeding was not possible for me--so this was a first time experiment  which actually worked! Oh, It's Soooo Good!

This is great bread recipe. Thanks so much for sharing! Warning, the default recipe makes a ton of dough. I only had one bread pan (new baker), so I used my Dutch Oven for the second half and it came out great!

Followed the recipe , except making only 2/3rds. The 2 loaves came out perfectly and were just the thing to make toast for out BLTs. Super easy, makes the house smell great and some of the best white bread we have ever had.
I will be making this again. Thanks!

Made this several times and making it again tonight. Awesome recipe. I have added melted butter instead of oil  and mixed brown and whit sugar together. Awesome. It's hard to mess up this recipe.
Have also added herbs to make a nice herb bread. Will be experimenting with this recipe.

I’ve been making this recipe for 2 months and my kids love it. I make 2 loafs instead of 3. It’s delicious, my 2 girls love helping... they even whisper when the dough is rising (bugs are sleeping and eating). Thank you for this recipe  love every second.

I made 1/3 recipe for one loaf and used honey instead of sugar.  The method of making a sponge and then kneading in the rest of the flour was easy and the bread was wonderful.  It rises very quickly.  Next time, I will use half the amount of yeast and let it rise more slowly.

I ended up using more flour than expected during the kneading, and it took longer to bake than the recommended time. I had to bake for more like 45 minutes. Still came out well!

WOW!  I've made a lot of bread and this one is so easy and makes enough without being too much.  It's so soft and delightful the next couple days.  Everyone asked me why I haven't been making this bread all along.  I wish I knew!  Fantastic!  Oh- and I used whatever olive oil I had one hand and it was fine.

My stomach is growling while it's baking, I promise you as soon as it comes out of the oven, I will be eating it.
Easy to make, probably one of the best white bread recipes I have tried.

I love this bread. I've made it several times and what I've learned is there is way too much yeast. The bread rises too quickly and the flavors don't develop properly and it puffs so much it tunnels. I adjusted the recipe by cutting the yeast in half and giving it longer to proof.

This baked beautifully and my family liked it. I increased the sugar to one third because my favorite brioche recipe has that much in it.

I have never made white bread until I tried this recipe. Not only is it easy but it’s amazing!  I started out using AP flour then tried bread flour. Bread flour made all the difference. When we want to make a really good textured bread for grilled cheese, French toast or garlic bread, I use the AP - everyone wanted to know what kind of bread I used for my French toast and my pimento grilled cheese sandwiches. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe - my family thanks you also.

I made it as is. The three loaves rose beautifully and the fourth loaf I made into two medium pizzas. It will now be my preferred pizza dough recipe for Friday night because I liked the flakyness of the crust, the extra sweetness, and the perfectly browned bottom crust. I baked them four minutes and then added the toppings for about 8 minutes at 500 degrees.

This has been my go to recipe when I am looking to make a white bread.  Have tried a number of recipes for white bread and this has become my favorite.  Sometimes I divide it into 2 huge loaves. (for french toast or toasting)  Other times I shape some of it into buns for hamburgers or pulled pork sandwiches.
Knead it less for a more coarse crumb.
Knead it more for a softer crumb. Very versatile recipe.

I made exactly per recipe, using my stand mixer. It turned out fabulous. To check my yeast I let it proof a couple minutes with just the water and sugar before I started mixing in the other ingredients.  After about 4 min it was foamy so then I proceeded as instructed.  
I managed to get 2 huge loaves and 10 good-sized hamburger buns out of this.  Fabulous flavor and textured!

What an outstanding bread recipe! Minimal amount of stuff to clean up afterwards, simple (as bread recipes go), and delicious. I did a 1/3 recipe the first time to see how it worked, and my wife complained that there was only one loaf.The second time, I did the full recipe and froze two of the loaves saran-wrapped and placed in loaf pans (ready for the final rise and baking when they come out of the freezer).
 I think that I will try a little honey in there to see if I can re-create my Grandma Sutton's bread even closer. Unfortunately, although several people tried, no one ever managed to get her recipe to work for them.

Hey! Nice flavor. I made it as advertised. It was pretty good. Then made it again and added 1/8 cup flax seed and used light brown sugar for half of the sugar requirement. It had a very good texture and flavor. 
I love to make it in small  rounds to dip in my soup.

This is delicious fluffy white bread. I tried to freeze 1 loaf of dough after the second rise, bit of a fail because once thawed it just wouldn't rise again. However, the fresh was great. I felt like 8 cups of flour was too much and couldn't get it all incorporated so when I made this the second time I used less and played it by ear as I kneaded it. It's beautiful and in the oven making the house smell wonderful as I type.

Solid white bread. We made loaves, dinner rolls and cinnamon rolls. Very versatile recipe.

I just made this recipe and it is the best white bread recipe I have tried. The only change I made was butter for the veg oil and I used 2 pkgs of yeast (4 1/2 tsp).  This bread makes the best toast!  This is now my go to recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I believe that this is the most beautiful loaf of bread I have ever made! It came out fluffy and golden brown, I am thrilled with this recipe. I followed the recipe and made one loaf of bread, a pan of rolls, and then I wrapped up one loaf and put it in the freezer for later. Absolutely the most perfect bread recipe ever! Thank you for sharing this, I will never use another recipe.

Best. Bread. Ever.  I switched out the ½ of sugar for ½ cup of honey with ¼ tsp baking soda and it’s amazing.  It ended up having a great crust and chewy center.

I only let it rise in the pan for maybe 2-3 mins and then right in the oven for about 40 mins.  I checked the bread every 10 minutes and the foil trick really does help the bread to not burn when the insides need a little more time but the top has a great color.

This was perfect! I used this recipe to make (9) runza's and used the left over dough to make (10) dinner rolls. I ran out of flour making this batch, but as soon as I go shopping I think I will make a big batch of dough to separate and freeze.

I have made this recipe so many times that I have it memorized.  It produces three beautiful, soft, fluffy, tasty  loaves every time.  I have a large family so these loaves do not last long.  I have been tempted to hold back all but a tablespoon of sugar and all the salt until after the sponge rise is complete to give the bread a longer, more traditional sponge rise, but the bread is so good as is I am afraid that playing with the recipe will just mess it up.  By far my favorite white bread recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us!

Amazing....... I made the recipe exactly  written. I did one batch in a kitchen aid mixer and another with the dough blade on a ninja processor. The ninja one came out way better in terms of appearance but both tasted the same.

This recipe is very good and reminds me of my grandma’s recipe! The smell of my house brought back some awesome memories. I followed the recipe to a T because it was my first time ever making bread other than banana or zucchini bread. The one rookie mistake I made was not greasing the pans enough- Grease those babies good or your bread will stick!

I am not an expert, but I can make this and it's fantastic.  I've used this recipe for bread, rolls and cinnamon rolls.  Brush a bit of melted butter on it when it's hot out of the oven.

Delicious recipe! The only problem that I had was, after the final rise in the pans, I covered them with the damp towel and it stuck to the loaves. I think next time I will try covering with plastic wrap sprayed with cooking spray. Other than that,  a recipe I will use again and again!

I have made this recipe a few times. I cut the yeast down to 4 1/2 tsp. The full 3 tbsp was giving me too soft of a loaf. The flavor was really nice, it just wasn't firm enough. Aside from that I am super happy with the recipe. I bake one loaf, freeze the dough for a second loaf for the next week, and use the final third for a pizza/calzone.  This is a staple for us. Thank you Grandma VanDoren!

This is the first time I made bread and I'm pretty happy with the results.  However, for all of you fellow newbies, the instructional video makes it sound like you should cool the bread in the pans and I think that's a mistake because my bread got soggy that way.  Next time I will remove the bread from the pans for cooling.

I made this today and it turned out great.  I used part of the dough to make stromboli and the rest in plain bread.  Both were wonderful.  I like the fact that it is an easy recipe  and the dough is good to work with.  Will definitely make this again.

I tried this recipe last week. I love it. I made it to give to some of my neighbors for Christmas. Making more loaves today for New Years. So glad I found this recipe. It is very easy to make.

**Update** after 2 months of making this bread we still love it. I have not ventured out to try some other things with this recipe. I want to try freezing a loaf and seeing how that works out.

All  I changed was proportions from three loaves to one. I ruined a bread yesterday and didn't want another mistake. I followed the recipe, and am happy with the results. I used the Cuisinart with dough hook to knead  it.  I used butter flavored Crisco for the bowl and greasing the dough. It's perfect and tastes great.

Wonderful recipe! My mom was known all over town for her unbelievable homemade bread, but I never got her recipe before she passed away. This is as close as I've come to the same taste and texture. Will be baking this for years to come! So glad I came across it! Only change I would add is to let the dough rise twice before kneading it into loafs for a third rise.

Grandma Van Nailed It. 

Excellent, simple basic white bread recipe. It's perfect for a quick white bread, but I find it most useful as pizza dough. If you let it ferment a day, it makes an outstanding pizza dough - perfect!

By the way - you guys "doubling the yeast" - you're nuts!!!! lol. I actually cut the yeast in half when I make this. Stressing the yeast a little and forcing it to overwork is where you get those great beery bread flavors. No flavor with an ultra fast rise and too much yeast. Similarly, I have my own sourdough starter (6 years old at this point I think), and less starter leads to better flavor pretty much every time. 

Just my opinion here - but I would cut the original recipe yeast in half, and just use your judgment on the timing change for rises. Baking bread is more jazz than Bach in my opinion :)

Lovely recipe.  I had to increase the salt a bit and the yeast the next time around.  The recipe isn't lacking, it's the flour I have to use.  This made 3 1lb loaves, 2 in the freezer only partially cooked. Thank you

My kids loved this bread. they told me I need to make this very day ... good thing you get 3 loaves out of this recipe. I only used 3.5 cups of flour in the 2nd step  because it was hard getting that in . but next time I make this recipe I am going to try to get all 4 cups in to see how different the bread is then. plus I had all 4 kids talking to me and fighting with each other during step number 2. the recipe did take a little long because of all the resting but its delicious. make sure you have no kids around to distract!!!

The only change I made was adjusting the servings, instead of 36 I changed it to 12, I didn't want to screw up 3 loaves. (haven't had much luck with bread making).  I will admit it came out great and will make 3 loaves next time.  Follow the directions.

Terrible!  Using the amount of water and flour in the recipe makes sticky goo that never forms a dough ball,  no matter how long it is kneaded either by hand or in a stand mixer.

This was AMAZING!!! My husband said it was the best bread he has eaten in his life...and I've been making homemade bread for years. I made it aaaallllmost exactly as written and it was perfect in every way.  The only thing I changed was I subbed melted butter for the oil because I didn't have any oil. Try it! You won't be sorry.

Great recipe, loved it. I didn't really stick to it  (I didn't put in sugar and used less olive oil) and it turned out great. I also put all my dough into one Bundt cake mold because that's all i had and it didn't mess it up at all. The only reason I put 4 stars is because the recipe is not precise.

Okay, for a complete novice, there needs to be way more instructions. Do you knead it in a bowl or on a floured table?
How long does it take to double in size? Should it be covered
the first time too?

I followed the instructions well I think.  Bought new yeast , new flour, used warm water etc.  After nearly 3 hours it hadn't risen at all. I went ahead and mixed in the rest of  the flour
and I'm waiting to see if it will rise. But not expecting  much.
I wonder what I did wrong. Frustrated!

Love it.  It's become my go to recipe for bread.  I usually double it and always substitute 2 cups of whole wheat flour for 2 cups of the white.  It is time consuming but so simple and so good.  Thank you.

My bread finished baking. It turned out okay, but it has too much sugar. Perhaps try 1/4 cup and 2 tablespoons of sugar instead. Someone's grandma has a sweet tooth. 

If your dough is too watery, you did not use enough flour. If your dough is tough or "dense" you either used too much flour , or you kneaded the bread longer than necessary. Always start with warm ingredients, this includes eggs, if used. PROOF YOUR YEAST SEPARATE. SALT SLOWS THE YEAST PROCESS. That being said, be careful to follow the recipe and not add too much salt. Do not double the yeast as someone has said.  Sometimes more flour is called for than the recipe states. I always sift my flour, so I end up needing more for the recipe. To avoid the mess above that was shown in the video, knead the dough in the bowl. It works just as well. There is no need to handle sloppy dough using the sponge method.  Continue to add flour just until the dough is workable. Knead the dough about 5-7 minutes, this goes by feel. Bread recipes will tell you one thing, but the dough will tell you another. I know extremely helpful, right? I suggest finding some books on bread baking. But all of this "grandma's recipe" headline is nonsense. This recipe is similar if not the same as other white bread recipes that someone copied out of a book. Find a good cookbook and work from that.

The first time I made this, I used all-purpose flour and made 1/3 of the recipe. It didn't rise as much as I had hoped, based on the wonderful reviews. 
However, I just tried this again this morning using the bread flour that is called for in the recipe. The dough rose beautifully at all three stages. I put one loaf in a bread pan, rolled another third into hot dog rolls, and mixed garlic, Italian herbs, and parmesan cheese into the last third for our pizza crust for tonight. My husband called the crust "perfect" and my 6 year old said the bread was delicious. :) This will be made weekly at my house from now on!

This is a really good and easy recipe. It does take a while to make because of how long it takes to rise but it is worth it! The amount of time that you are actually making the dough is far less than I thought. I will hopefully make this recipe again because it turned out great! I actually only made one loaf instead of 3 loaves like the recipe makes so I changed the servings to 12 instead of 36. This recipe is great, I love it! :)

I used 2 cups whole wheat flour to try to be healthier...it worked okay but definitely made it more sense. I'm going to go down to 1 cup whole wheat next week.

Don't underestimate the size of your large bowl, in which the bread rises.  I chose too small, and it almost overflowed, so I had to quickly move it to a much larger bowl.  Will be putting my loaves in the oven in a few minutes.  They should be wonderful.  Will update if this doesn't remain a 5*.

I followed the recipe exactly. It came out like a typical loaf of bread, but was way too soft. I had a hard time cutting it to the point where either the bread would tear as I cut it or I'd nearly slice my fingers off trying to hold it and cut it. The flavor was also fairly ordinary, just like every other white bread recipe I've made. I doubt I'll be making this again.

I enjoyed this a lot. I made it in my bread maker and added some gluten flour. It is now my staple bread recipe!

I would add a bit more sugar next time as I enjoy sweet bread.

I make this a few times a year, and I have never been disappointed, great recipe! Love making BLT's with this mash it down and eat! FYI the first round of dough should be watery, not until you add the second 4 cups of flour does the consistency change.  God Bless

AMAZING! I made this with the adjustment of 24 servings instead of 36, and weighed the ingredients in grams. I had to add about a quarter cup of flour, even after weighing, but the conversions can sometimes be tricky, when they are written for volume instead of weight, originally. I also threw 1/4 C water onto the bottom of the oven right before I shut the door for baking so the crust would be extra chewy. The recipe took very well to it! I accidentally added the amount of oil that the 36 serving recipe called for, but I'll do it again because WOWZA!

The result was fantastic! Soft crumb with a nice mouth-feel, chewy from crust and throughout, good flavor, and the yeast-gas bubbles were well distributed for a light but strong bread. 

I've been baking all kinds of bread for over 10 years, and this may be my new favorite non-sourdough recipe. 

I'm going to try it with some vitamin c, because, like all white breads, it goes stale faster than other sorts of bread made from whole grain flour. This is not me complaining, because it won't last very long in my house! :) I'll update on the keeping properties of the kind of vitamin C I'll be using.

Worst bread I have ever had, not sure why, but it didn't rise and was horrible tasting, I am sure I did something wrong, but followed the recipe exactly. The lack of raising seemed to be the issue. I even used a thermometer to measure the temperature exactly, what did I do wrong?

When I made this recipe I cut it in thirds and only made one loaf... while also just flat out adding all of the flour at once in a Kitchenaid mixer and kind of skipped the whole "Sponge rise" in step one. Still turned out perfect! Also, I doubled the yeast to cut down the rising time, which was perfect - instead of waiting two hours for the bread to rise, I only waited for one. I would suggest kneading the dough for only a minute or two, and let it rise again for another one and a half hours when it's in the bread pan.

And don't worry about not having any bread flour. I used Unbleached All-purpose flour, and was good to go!

My first foray into bread making  I used this recipe and it turned out great. Over the years I modified the ingredients replacing oil with melted butter and using a couple cups wheat flour with the bread. Results have been consistently great. I think experienced bread makers who rate this poorly are either using one star as "great" or are rigidly adhering to proportions and procedures (common for skilled bakers). Since I've never been a baker but a cook, this recipe allows for some flexibility and that's why it worked for me. Regardless, the loafs are gobbled up by family and friends almost as soon as it's taken out oven! It's versatile enough to use for other breads but I like its classic style.

I was happily surprised that this recipe worked great!  I didn't want to waste ingredients on the chance that it didn't, so I divided it by 3 and made 1 loaf.  It was a little weird letting it rise 3 times, but the end result was a perfect golden brown loaf of light bread.  It didn't taste yeasty at all (I followed the base recipe and did not double the yeast).  This one is going in my recipe box!

I made this twice. The first time it came out okay, but I mixed it by hand and wasn't able to get the consistency down, so it came out good, but dense.  The second time I used my mixer to mix the dough after the initial sponge rise and it came out much more like sandwich bread.  Very tasty and a keeper and so easy to make.  I had some great peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch with this bread and toast in the morning.  Thanks for the recipe.  Delicious.

This way good but had a heavy yeast taste. I only made 24 servings so maybe it was the additional 1 1/2 tsp that did it. Regardless of the taste, it was light and airy like store bought bread and rose beautifully.

This is a fantastic recipe! I have made it twice and my family loves it.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and it worked really well.  I also grease my pans with butter  and bush the loaves with melted butter which makes the crust really yummy.  The first time I used regular flour and the dough was a little sticky.  The second time I used bread flour and like the results better.  It makes 3 beautiful loaves!

I love this recipe!! I did have some problems with the dough being really runny, so I added 1.5 cups of flour to step 1, and 1/2 cups of flour to step 2.
I replaced the sugar with honey and instead of oil, I used Lard. 

GREAT - I am looking forward to making this at least twice a week.

Added a bit more sugar to the dough.  Used it to make the BEST cinnamon rolls ever.  One of the secrets of the cinnamon rolls is to douse them in powdered sugar icing immediately after baking.  Let it run down the sides in the pan.  Makes the centers ooey gooey.

Fantastic recipe!!  Thank you grandma Van Doren. We are having the bread with Italian food so I added a teaspoon of garlic powder.  As others have said it's  much less dense than some of the other recipes here. I did accidentally let it rise before putting it in the oven because I forgot to pre heat the oven. Oops. Maybe a happy accident though.

I make this bread frequently and it always turns out great.
The dough is a little bit wet, but i just add flour a little bit at a time until it's more manageable.   Practice (and common sense) makes perfect.

I make this bread recipe about 3 times a week, not always the full amount, and sometimes double it. It's the easiest recipe to follow and can be "tricked out" with cinnamon & raisins, walnuts, garlic & basil, pretty much anything. I LOVE IT!
Dank je wel, oma Van Doren!

oh so good. I did things wrong and it still turned out great. this recipe really does make 3 loaves. I made one loaf, one batch cinnamon rolls and tried making donuts out of the third. All turned out fantastic...even the donuts! I was impressed. Made a simple powdered sugar glaze for them and they tasted almost like Krispy Kremes. My new go to bread recipe.

Easy to follow recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I don't have a bread pan so I made two big loafs, and a small loaf in a Pyrex container. 
I made this with my 13 year old step-daughter who is pretty new to baking, and she was able to understand the recipe.  It came out really well.  The kids loved it, and so did their father.   I didn't like it as much as they did, but it was still really good.  I will definitely make it again.

I divided the recipe into thirds since I only wanted to make one loaf. I may try it as written next time and freeze two since this loaf didn't rise as much as the photo; even with fresh yeast. Regardless, utterly delicious and thank you for sharing.

I have made this several time, and this recipe has become my favorite bread.  The resulting bread is soft, finely crumbed, and tastes great.  I regularly add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour with no problems, in case you are wondering.  More than that I haven't tried.  I have used this to make baguette-style loaves, with an egg wash, in my Pullman-style bread pan, and in shaped canape bread tubes.  All have come out really nicely.  
Yes, this takes a bit of time, since there is 2 rises (sponge, after adding all the flour, and once shaped), but it's totally worth it.  It sounds worse than it is.
I'm currently working on a batch to turn in to rolls for tomorrow's Super Bowl game.

This was the first time I ever made my own bread. It turned out really good. My adult children loved it I myself found it to be sweeter than I wanted to use the bread for. I have since bought a bread machine but I think I would still make this recipe since it makes three loaves and I was able to freeze two and bake one.

This is our go to bread...no kneading and lots of flavour. Sometimes we add sesame and poppy seeds. Often we use 6c white flour and 2c whole wheat. We LOVE this recepie!

This bread came out pretty dense for me, but it still tasted delicious so I'm still giving it 5 stars. It makes perfect cinnamon rolls, by the way!

Followed the recipe to the T and it came out just wonderful.  I baked in a small oven and will use regular oven next time.  The flavor and consistency was wonderful.  This will be my regular bread recipe.

my first attempt at making a simple white bread for school lunches and such.. I made 1 larger loaf, and a regular sized loaf. It turned out beautiful! (I even did a photo shoot!) HeeHee. 
It was super delicious served warm with homemade beef stew. 
ps... There's none left for sandwiches....

I used regular organic flour.  Halved the recipe and made two small loaves.  Truly excellent, soft and fluffy bread.  I will definitely be making this again.

I made this bread on our anniversary which is January 1, but cut the recipe in half.  I used King Arthur's All Purpose Flour and it turned out wonderfully.  It is sort of like the overnight no-knead bread but is done in about 3 & 1/2 hrs.

My Husband normally eats wheat bread.  As soon as it came out of the oven he ate a slice with peanut butter and honey and gave this recipe a 10 +.  I will be baking this bread many more times and sharing it with my family and friends.

First off made this recipe 3 times now. Sadly the first time it came out like cake. Not good for sandwiches, great for dinner rolls as is though!!!

So I modified the recipe a little. Switching oil for butter.
If you do not know it is crucial to add the oil/butter/shortening at certain points while mixing. In this case you should add them in after all the 8 Cups of flour have been mixed in smoothly. With 3 tablespoons yeast it will take you allot of mixing to over mix this bread. So it is not an issue. Please note that adding oil/butter/shortening when the flour is not activated with yeast will keep it from rising. It will coat the dry flour and make it heavy. So just add oil the 2nd time you need to rise after you knead in rest of flour. You will thank me for it.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out wonderful. The only thing I added was an egg wash (one egg, 2tbsp of heavy cream, pinch of salt) but this didn't affect the taste just the appearance. It was super easy and tastes much better than store bought. I even decided to make dinner rolls and hey came out beautiful!!

I've tried many recipes but still manage to make horrible, heavy bread. So, I went in search of a good recipe and what better than a Grandma's recipe? I can't believe this recipe is so easy and so good,,,, EVERY time. Love it!!  Would recommend for beginner bakers.

I followed the recipe for the most part, only changing it to use regular flour instead of bread flour. This is a family favorite, I've made it countless times but finally got around to rating. My 9 year old daughter has this recipe memorized and makes it for every family get together. Thanks!

I never give recipes 5 stars but this recipe deserved it. I liked how the recipe called for you to let the bread rise 3 times I usually only let it rise twice. This bread cooked so nice. Stayed nice and fluffy and then the crust crunchy yet not over done. I would add a little more sugar because I like a little sweeter bread but that's just me this recipe is good either way. Two thumbs up to grandma VanDoren!

I selected this recipe due to the ingredient measures, nice easy round measures.  Would recommend changing the salt to 1 Tablespoon instead of 3 Teaspoons .  The results were a light fluffy loaf, but not as much flavor as I would like.  The search continues.

I have made a lot of bread over the years and this is the best white bread recipe I have found.  We loved it and next time I will use one of the loaves for cinnamon rolls or pizza crust.  I followed the recipe as written and it was delicious with soup and sandwiches.

I've made this recipe several times and it's our all-time favorite white bread. I have found a great trick on the King Arthur website for helping the bread rise: I cover each of the 3 bread pans with a clear shower cap which makes a tent and humidifier. It works wonderfully!

First time Ive ever made bread. Turned out great! Followed the instructions to the letter, though I greased my bread pans with butter =) 

Beginners tip : Be sure to flour your hands before kneading. Save yourself a huge mess =)

I will make it again, but I might add 1 more tsp of salt.

This is my white bread recipe. Replacing water with whey will make it chewy and the beautiful texture would last for at 7 days as opposed to just using plain water, the crumb will start to disintegrate on the third day. I live in a tropical country where room temperature is at 32°C normal.

Delicious recipe and easy to make.
I took the advice of another review and made some rolls, but i also made pizza as well. Only because I dont have 3 bread pans, but everything turned out wonderful. Very happy with this recipe and will be making it again.
I would maybe suggest watching the video if its your first time because its a bit different from others ive made.

This is an easy and excellent tasting bread.  I have made hamburger buns, cinnamon rolls and of course loaves of bread.  This is a really nice bread,  not dense, nice and light.  My family loves it.  Great recipe,  no changes here!

I've made this bread twice and had great results. This produced 3 beautiful loaves with a crusty exterior and a delicious, soft interior! Great with fresh butter!

I made this recipe last nite..9/15.  Only problem is if your home is cool like mine it dosnt rise...have to preheat oven to get it warm and turn off then let rise..or find a warm place...but other wise it was very good bread...we even used a third of the bread to make monkey bread which came out awwome..

Wow. This recipe is really fool proof! I made these three loafs today and they turned out amazing! I am new to bread baking and tried out a different recipe yesterday but failed hard. Today I decided to give it another shot using this recipe instead and oh my gosh. I am over the moon happy with how they turned out! Fluffy, not to sweet, big beautiful loafs. This is now my official bread recipe! Thank you so much!

I make this bread all the time for potlucks. Turns out delicious. I always end up using less flour than the recipe calls for. Don't try to force too much in because then your bread will end up a dry and crumbly, and if your dough feels like it's too crumbly as you're kneading it add a little extra oil. Delicious!

So easy and so delicious. A soft white bread. Perfect crumb. Watch the video. I didn't know what a sponge was related to making bread but the video shows how it should look.  This is only my second time making bread and it turned out great.

My husband thought the bread was a bit "yeasty" but I really liked this bread. So, so simple to make. I cut the recipe to a third to just make one loaf and it was an easy peasy addition to dinner.

I have tried a lot of bread recipes looking for that perfect texture, and this is it.  I used coconut oil and only 1.5 tablespoons of yeast and it turned out perfect (I had reduced the recipe to make two loaves).

This bread came out to pure perfection. I used two 9x5 pan (I think, I may be off by half inch). This is my first time making any type of bread! I'm glad I chose the right recipe. I did not change a this. Also I wanted to add that I made it all in my Kitchen Aid stand mixer with the mixing blade first to mix the wet ingredients with the 4 cups of bread flour and the rest it calls for. After I let it rise I used the dough hook to mix the last 4 cups of flour. The dough was sticky but I did not add anything else, I just used oil on my hands to prevent it from sticking. My husband is so excited since he takes a sandwich to work daily.

I halved the recipe, dumped it all in the bread machine on Med. white and it was WONDERFUL. I had no idea what a sponge was, so ignored that step. (Afterwards re-read and figured it out, but this was a winner all on its own.) Bless our ancestors for passing recipes like these down... the wonderful women who made these recipes by hand - and how lucky I feel that I don't have to.

I have made this recipe twice already, it is my new go to white bread recipe. Very simple and with the use of quick rise yeast you can skip the bowl rise (still need to do sponge rise) cutting out an hour of prep time. I used all purpose flour as I did not have bread flour, but it turned out beautifully! Thanks to another reviewer for that tip about the flour or I might not have made it! Have sent the link to family as well, thanks for a great recipe!

I have been using this recipe for a few years now, and recently switched to using half Goat Milk and half water.
It is the most delicious and moist bread I have ever had and it doesn't fall apart after a few days.

We've been through a few bread recipes lately, most of which haven't risen so we were cautious about having to wait for this one to rise THREE times, but it did and we had great success. Love it!  Will make again for sure.  We did add one cup less of flour though, it was too thick to add more.

This recipe is wonderful!  I must admit, I like it better than my grandmother's recipe and will now be using it for my own. I made a half batch the first go through to try it out and because I wanted smaller loaves to accompany soup. It had a perfect crust, moist inside and tasted amazing.  I think I could have ate the whole 1st loaf myself, and almost did!  Needless to say, I will be making several more of these loaves tonight as my kids devoured them as soon as they came home from school.

I made this last week and it turned out wonderful! The only change I made was I used regular flour otherwise left everything the same. I made 2 loaves then made ooey-gooey cinnamon buns from the sight and they were very yummy! I'm making another batch I this bread today and I think I will just bake 2 loaves again and use the extra to make fry bread....I will update on how the fry bread turns out

Great recipe!!! The only addition I made was a slight egg wash brushed on top before baking. My picky husband said it's the best homemade bread he's ever had. And my even pickier 6 year old begged to have her sandwiches for school made from it and told me to leave the crust on!!! She NEVER eats crust!! So a win, win, win recipe! Happy hubby! Happy kids! Happy mom!!

I'm still a beginner with making my own bread, but this recipe was still easy to follow.  I've been making baguettes lately and wanted to make something to use for my sons sandwiches.  This bread was exactly what I was looking for!  I increased the yeast to 4 1/2 tablespoons trying to speed up the rising time (which seemed to work) and I used regular all-purpose white flour.  I love the fluffy texture of this bread.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is the easiest bread I have ever made!  I have a huge household so I usually double the recipe on baking day and freeze uncooked dough (shaped in a loaf or rolls) for the following week. I've found in my area that I don't quite need all 8 cups of flour, depending on the humidity.  I usually add 2 cups (after the yeast mixture has doubled), then add 1/2 cup at a time.  Never a dense loaf yet!

A bit dry, and the directions for this bread would be very difficult for a novice bread-baker. Whenever the directions indicate to let the sponge or bread rise, I heated up my oven to 350 and then turned it off and opened the oven door, slipping the bowl of sponge or bread loaves onto the rack and letting rise for about 30 mins. Perfect results.

Absolutely delicious bread. Much softer and fluffier than a lot of bread recipes that I've tried recently. Very light and airy, with a fantastic flavor.

I used regular all-purpose flour instead of bread flour, but I'd love to give it a try with bread flour, too. I usually make two loaves of bread, then throw the rest into the fridge to make pizzas with later. This is now my go-to white bread recipe. Wonderful!

I'm sure this recipe deserves more than 3 stars but the bread I made was just ok. I think my mistake was in using rapid rise yeast (dough cycle) instead of active dry which I didn't have. The Fleischmann's website said it could be used instead. The bread had a nice flavor, but didn't rise well. I will make this again this week and update my rating. With so many positive reviews, it has to be novice baker error.

UPDATE: 2 WEEKS LATER - So I finally got over my failure with this recipe and decided to make it again. This time, I used SAF active dry yeast and King Arthur's bread flour. I knew this loaf would be different when the sponge doubled in less than 1 hour. The bread was absolutely delicious. My husband and I made turkey and provolone sandwiches with the warm bread. The texture was perfect. We just had the remaining half with scrambled eggs for breakfast. The entire loaf barely lasted 12 hours. Definitely five star.

I have been searching high and low, literally for years, for a light and airy bread recipe.

This is it. 

There is one review that indicates the dough was watery - this has to be user error. As I approached my final cup of flour, I just added a little at a time so not to make the dough to dry. I can't see how 8 cups of flour to 3 cups of water could come out watery?

I went ahead and ended up using 6 cups flour before my first rise, and added a bit more before it's second rise. Seems to have worked out fine.

I was looking for a new bread recipe and I found an amazing one.  Followed the directions EXACT and came out with 3 perfect loaves of bread.  So uncomplicated it was almost too good to be true.  My grandmother did milk and butter and heated everything exact.  I've been using an over complicated recipe until now.  Thank you so much.

LOVE this bread, this is the second time I made it and I tried rolling a cinnamon & sugar mixture into one loaf, it didn't work out like I wanted, next time I'll use butter with it. Will definitely keep using this for my go to bread recipe. UPDATE 10/14/14 I have tried so many other bread recipes but always find myself comparing them to this and then making this one anyway! Past 2 times I have made 2 loaves of bread and a batch of about a dozen small cinnamon rolls yummy!!! Again, by far the best bread recipe I've found!!

I can't believe I actually made bread! This is a great recipe for first-timers. I'm pretty sure I messed up several times, and it still turned out really well. I love the lightness of this bread. I had to be pretty gentle while slicing it and I don't know yet how well it will hold up for things like grilled cheese or french toast, but I think that's in part due to my poor kneading technique. I found the accompanying video to be extremely helpful as well!

I followed the recipe exactly except for halving the sugar added. I made two loaves and eight rolls. Lovely bread to go  with my home made strawberry jam for supper. Love it! Had to stop myself from guzzling the lot in one go !

It's a great recipe. I just reduced the yeast to 2 table spoon and it turned out same fluffy. First time when I made it I felt very strong smell of yeast. Other then that it's a great bread.

This was my second time making Bread. The first recipe I used didn't turn out well. So I looked for another and found this one. I only had 2 Bread pans so I had to adjust the recipe and it turned out good. I should have been a bit more patient when waiting for it to rise but it still turned out yummy. I definitely will make this again. I recommend this recipe for beginners and pro's. It is very easy to make.

This is a great recipe. I had to cut it in half so my kitchenaid mixer could handle it and also because we can only eat one loaf of bread before it goes bad. I also cut the sugar down to a tablespoon because I don't like it so sweet.

I've been looking for the perfect bread recipe and I think I've found it! Nice crust, great crumb and awesome flavor. I made a full batch and did 2 loaves and one batch of cinnamon rolls. This is now my go-to bread recipe!

I used this dough to make cinnamon rolls, cutting the recipe in half to get 18 small-ish buns.  I used regular old AP flour and subbed melted butter for the veg oil as I never use veg oil in anything.  The dough was a dream to work with, rose quickly and tasted fabulous. I started making the rolls at 7:30 and they were ready to bake by 9:30. I can't wait to make loaves of bread with this.

Ok..I thought I had found the perfect bread/roll recipe a few weeks ago on here but I was so wrong! THIS is the perfect bread/roll recipe! Hands down! I made as is...except that I made 2 loaves of bread and a pan of 8 HUGE cinnamon rolls. Turned out very light, very moist...the bread AND rolls...I will not be going back to the other recipe. Thanks so much!!

This is our go to bread recipe - not that we had tried others before. We beke 2 loaves, and use the remainder of the dought to make cinnamon rolls, or pizza crust. Recipe seemed so easy to follow that it inspired me to try. I am not a good cook/baker, but I always find easy, good recipes on here.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it is great. Not too dense, nice and fluffy. I freeze two of the loaves, and pull out of the freezer to thaw on the day I am going to bake them. Doesn't take long to thaw, and they still taste wonderful.

Pretty good bread.  Certainly better than any mega-store white bread.  I do feel there is some room for improvement so I may try some other recipes on here before settling on this one.

This makes a very nice, very hearty bread. I actually cut the ingredients down as I did not have enough yeast. So I used 2 cups water, 4 packets of yeast (I proofed the yeast first, before adding the other ingredients), about 4 - 5 cups of flour, and just reduced other ingredients by eyeballing it (instead of using exact measurements). The dough did rise perfectly and I made two loaves.

I just finished making this bread.  Only my second attempt ever making bread.  It turned out SO well!!  Light, & fluffy with a nice crisp crust.  If you follow the instructions to the letter, there's really no way you can go wrong.  I am so very pleased to have found this recipe, now I won't be afraid to make bread anymore!  Thank you Grandma VanDoren!!

Made this for the 1st time today. I am not very experienced with breads beyond throwing the ingredients into a bread machine.  Gave this a try and I might not ever go back! The texture was good, it was moist and not too dense. I did not follow the recipe 100% though, I substituted all purpose flour for half the flour called for in the recipe. Also I only made 1 loaf out of the dough, the rest I turned into rolls (which can be frozen and heated up at a moment's notice).

This is the best white bread recipe I have ever made. It is excellent. I made it exactly as in the directions, but instead of making 3 white loaves, I made 2 white loaves, and a large cinnamon raisin loaf. This is how I made the cinnamon raisin loaf. After I mixed the sponge, I poured some out into another bowl, (only enough to make 1 loaf). I then added 1 tablespoon of cinnamon, 1/2 cup of black raisins, and 2 tablespoon of agave sweetener. I then set it aside and let it rise just like the rest of the batter. I followed the rest of the directions exactly as in the recipe, and the breads turned out wonderful.  My husband and I loved both the white and the cinnamon loaves. The texture of breads were just like it looks in the picture. This is the bread recipe I will use from now on. Thank you for sharing your Grandma VanDoren's White Bread recipe. It is a winner!!

As a little girl I remember watching (and stealing and eating dough because it is just that good!) my sister time after time make bread. I can't remember it turning out great all the time, but like i said the dough was dee--lish! But once she moved out no more bread was made! Ever since I've had this incurable itch to make it! I was so excited when it turned out so yummy! I did have too much flour left over though, not sure what happened there, but it turned out great! I think i want more flavor though, it seems too bland. This bread is nice and fluffy, with a good crust (as in not crunchy). Will for sure make it again, but if you have suggestions on how to make it possibly more flavorful i would be exceedingly greatful!
Thanks so much! I'm pumped that my first bread-making experience went so well :)

Just a little tip for new bread machine users.  You can only make 1 loaf at a time in the bread machine.  I did 2 loaves and big disaster.  LOL.  You can make this recipe for 3 loaves but you gotta do it all by hand not using the bread machine.

Brilliant recipe!! Best one I've ever made. I don't buy store bought anymore, I just make one batch of this bread every 2 days. Great for the kids and my wallet too! Thanks for sharing :)

Didn't want to make 3 loaves and hate it, so I split the recipe and only made 1 loaf.  Mistake!  Should have made 6 loaves.  I made it exactly as stated and it was delicious.  Between last night and this morning the 3 of us ate the whole loaf.  It was like having dessert when I put my homemade strawberry jam on it.  Will be making more tonight!

Second recipe I tried from this site and this blows the other one away!!! It came out so moist!!!
I did spread a little bit of "I can't believe it's not butter" on the top of each loaf with 15 minutes left to cook, then covered with foil and finished cooking.  Then while cooling I brushed a little more ICBINB on top... so yummy!!!
My 5 year old who does not like bread at all LOVES this stuff... so I will not be buying bread any more.. this is what she will eat so I will be making it!!!
Thank you!!!

I made one loaf of this recipe and one loaf from the recipe I usually use from this site. The loaf from my usual recipe rose nicely and came out perfect. This bread did not rice nicely at all and though my husband thought it tasted okay, I did not care for it. It also took an hour longer than my usual recipe so I think I will stick with what has worked well for me.

Excellent bread!! I really like that the recipe makes 3 loaves. I make 2 for bread and other one for cinnamon rolls or dinner rolls. Very good taste and texture, perfect for sandwiches. Brushed with a little egg wash for a nice golden shiny look. I no longer buy store bought bread. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe. Very easy to make. I have not baked bread in many years and it came out perfect the first time! I cut the recipe to two loaves, the directions are very good. I did dissolve yeast and sugar before adding flour. Rise time in between was about an hour. We had it for dinner with chicken parm last night. Is an excellent bread for sandwiches, and I plan on making french toast with the rest!

This bread is delicious - and as others have said, virtually no fail. It's easy and comes out great every time. Thanks for a great bread recipe!

For those who have a food processor, this is how I do it (it saves on a little time):

Proof yeast by dissolving yeast and sugar in the warm water and letting it set until foamy (5ish mins). 

Use dough blade to mix flour, salt, and olive oil in processor. Add in water mixture as fast as the flour mixture will absorb it. Mix until dough cleans the sides. Process for 45 seconds to knead.

Then, I follow the directions in this recipe starting with rolling dough into ball and putting it in a big greased bowl and cover it with a damp towel. 

Also, I usually half the recipe - which yields two 1lb-ish loaves.

Always comes out great!

I just watched this video and it is exactly what I grew up watching my mother and grandmother do.  I have been missing their bread and searching for a recipe that will replace theirs since they also didn't write it down.  Watching this video brought tears to my eyes and a recognition of something I haven't seen for years but is so embedded in memory that it all came flooding back.  Can't wait until tomorrow AM to try this recipe out for real!!!

Made it with regular whole wheat flour for my visiting family who does everything natural and homemade and said it was the best whole wheat she has ever had. Came out nice and soft. Thank you for sharing.

I used an antique bread bucket mixer to do the kneading and THAT is a method for making bread 100 years ago. It worked out great. My Mom used to make 6 loaves at a time and we lost her recipe. I was glad to find another nice antique recipe. Making bread should be an inheritance of Grama's talent!

I Love this recipe! I have made it 3 times now. I change the servings to 1 or 2 (I use my Kitchenaid so 3 would be too much).  I do add a little less sugar as others have commented...I have also made it with 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 AP flours. I use a Tbsp of vital wheat gluten and fill with a flour to = 1 cup (for each cup).  That is basically to add protein (or you can use bread flour which is a higher protein).  Love it and I may never buy sandwich bread again!

This was mouthwatering!!! It's light, soft, fluffy, and not at all rubbery as a review suggests! I used regular unbleached flour as I had no bread flour. I followed the recipe exactly, this will be my go to bread recipe from now on! Thank you so much for sharing it!!!!

Made this for dinner tonight and it turned out great. I used the bread machine to make the dough, which I had to halve for the machine, and then baked in the oven. The family loved it!

One of the very best bread recipes I have tried.  The bread rose brilliantly, and was delicious.

I have made this twice and it is wonderful.  The first time with regular flour and the second time with bread flour.  Both work well, however, I did think the bread flour made the bread a little lighter in texture and it rose higher than with regular all purpose flour.  It is very easy to make and the taste far exceeds anything you get at the store.  I have made bread on and off in my lifetime and used different recipes, but this one is a keeper!!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Loved this recipe!  My Gramma Cook used to make bread and cinnamon buns for us using a very similar recipe which (again) was never written down.  We made half the recipe and baked the bread in a round bread dome for 40 minutes.  Perfect taste.  Perfect texture.  Perfect rise.  We used a Kitchen Aid to knead the dough and then did a final knead and shape into a ball on a floured board.  Next time we will make a full recipe and make a loaf with 1/2 and then use the other 1/2 for cinnamon rolls.  My gramma will be proud!

It worked great for me. I made two loaves in 10 inch pans. I used bread flour but I might try all purpose flour sometime. Definitely a keeper recipe.

I have made this recipe many times in the last couple month with excellent results.  I used it for my rolls at Thanksgiving and had many compliments-even from some of my most picky eaters. I used the dough to make scones for a group of teenagers and they could not get enough. I use regular flour and it turns out just fine. I have also used a couple cups of whole wheat flour with the same great results. Sometimes I punch it down and let it rise in the bowl twice for an extra smooth texture.  This is a great base dough for all kinds a wonderful treats. This is one of my favorite bread recipes and it will get many more uses.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written. It turned out great! Light yet denser than store bought white bread. It slices very easily, without crumbling. I made some into small sandwich buns instead of 3rd loaf. Will be making it often, and will try the freezing method for dough to cook later,, as another comment mentioned. Thank you, Grandma VanDoren for giving up the recipe! Thank you, Marilyn, for sharing with the rest of us!

Wow! Really great recipe! Very easy to make and it turned out fantastic. Crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Made this using loaf tins and the bread attachment on our kitchenaid. Made 2 loafs and 1 small batch of cinnamon buns. Next time I make this, I will omit sugar or reduce drastically since me and the hubby prefer non-sweet breads. Thanks so much for sharing this :)

I've been baking bread of all kinds for years and am kind of known for it- my husband says that this is the best bread I've ever made.  Will DEFINITELY make again!  Made most of the batch into loaves and used remainder to make hamburger buns topped with egg wash and sesame seeds.  Used slightly more flour than called for in order to handle dough.

I love the texture of this bread. I used to bake bread weekly, many years ago, and didn't go by measurements....time has removed the memory of those "recipes" from my brain. :) This is one I will use again. I just made three loaves [kitchen aid mixer] and can't believe how fast it ended up in the oven.  Three loaves is a bit much for my mixer but everything worked out great. I was out of bread flour and just used my all purpose organic unbleached white flour. I will try to use bread flour next time to see the difference..but this bread is great!

Good, but I am looking for a "Rhodes Bread" taste and texture. This is not. The crust is a little thick and tough. Was very easy. Maybe next time I will not bake it as long as the recipe calls for.

I am not an experienced bread maker, and have always had issues with my yeast proofing.  My bread ALWAYS ends up being dense and closer to a brick then bread.  Not anymore!  I've never seen a recipe for bread where you didn't proof the yeast before adding the oil, etc. I was thrilled when my dough doubled!  Of course, the best part was the bread.  Delish!  I will be making this recipe over and over again.  No more brick bread.  Hooray!  A big thank you to Grandma VanDoren for a recipe the even I can make.

This was great! The crust was soft, and the inside was chewey and delicious. I covered the loaves with foil after baking for 15min and then brushed the tops with butter after removing them from the oven. This is by far the easiest and best-tasting white bread recipe I've tried.

Just tasted the first loaf we tried of this.  This bread is outstanding.  The only thing I did different is when we pulled the bread out of the oven, I took a tablespoon of butter and brushed it onto the top of the loaf.  This is great!

I used 3 cups of whole wheat flour instead of all 8 cups of bread flour.  It turned out great. Way too much for 2 of us. made some into rolls and Parmesan and garlic bread and one regular loaf! All tasted great!

This is the greatest recipe ever.  I make it all the time.  I was out of salt last time I made and used garlic salt as substitute and wow, wonderful.  I also used this recipe to make a sour dough bread.  Fantastic.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.  :)

This is the best bread I've ever made.  The recipe was easy to follow, and the dough felt like a dream.  As another poster suggested I added 1 Tbsp of Vitamin C, 3 Tbsp of Gluten flour and an egg to act as natural preservatives but I doubt it will last long enough to need preserving!

Superb, stupendous and wonderful. This is so easy and delicious. Loved the way the house smelled while this was baking. Folks, don't miss a chance to get a slice of this while it's still warm. My bread flour had gotten funky, so I had to use all purpose flour, still had stellar results. Thanks!

adjusted recipe to make 12 servings (1 loaf). Used 1 1/2 c bread flour, 1/2 c regular flour, 2/3 c whole wheat flour. 1 tablespoon sugar only. Extreme difficulty getting it from board where I let it rise to bread stone.

This is the best bread I have made in a loooong time!  Got it right the first time and it is delicious.  Some recipes, you have to try them again and again to get it right.  This was so easy and quick.  The family loves it!
Thank You Grandma VanDoren for sharing your recipe!

I just cut the first slice of this wonderful bread.  It's absolutely delicious and makes two 10" loaves perfectly.  I put in an egg and 1 cup of whole wheat flour because I like my bread to be a little heavier than usual.  I will use this recipe over and over, it's wonderful. I also used 3 packets of yeast, almost 3 tablespoons and bread flour, but think I will use all purpose next time. Thanks to Grandma VanDoren, I'm sure she was a wonderful lady and a great cook.

this is the old fashioned loaf of white bread I have been searching for. My father in law taught me to bake many years ago but I lost his recipe and he has been gone for many years. This is much like the bread he baked and taught to me. Outstanding!

I don't know what went wrong. The sponge and subsequent rises, uh, didn't. I tested the temp of water carefully and followed the recipe to the letter.

I can either conclude that the recipe is bad (unlikely given the high reviews) or my yeast had died. Either way, the recipe didn't work for me, which is a shame.

This bread is delicious and so easy to make!  It has became a staple at my house.  It freezes well, just take out of freezer and let thaw.  I will never buy store bread again. Thank you!

This was my first attempt at bread-making and this recipe was phenomenal!  I can't believe how easy it was and it only took about 2.5 hours from start to finish.  I have a teenage son and husband who at a whole loaf at dinner!  I will be making this again for sure!

I have to say that this recipe was very simple to do! I've been trying out alot of bread recipes throughout the years and this one is definitely a keeper!! I followed all directions but just added a bit more yeast for faster rising.

Baked really nicely, but it was too sweet for me to act as a go-to loaf.  It'd be great with jam, as toast, or to eat on it's own, but not for sandwiches imho.

This turned out great.  I cooked it on cookie sheets but let it set on them for about 2hrs in the oven before turning on the heat.  It only had to cook for about 20min so do keep an eye on them.  They turned out so light and fluffy, my wife and 6 kids just loved it.  A KEEPER!

This is one delicious bread!   I recently bought a bread machine and have been searching for a sandwich bread and this is fantastic!  To work in my bread machine, I changed the servings to 12, and followed my machine instructions which say to add all liquid ingredients first, follow with all the dry ingredients and make a well on top for the yeast.  It turned out perfect!  I can't wait to make our club sandwiches with it.

This is a great recipe!!! The bread comes out so thick and chewy, and since it's so thick it doesn't get soggy fast so making a tuna melt on it is great (when you toast this bread in the oven with some butter on it, it's the best), just don't slice it so thick and put so much filling that it's hard for you to fit it in your mouth...I speak from experience lol.

Lovely crust and crumb. I shaped 2 loaves into Italian-style free form loaves and 1 loaf as directed. I used olive oil. Next time I will decrease the sugar, oil and yeast simply for the sake of experimentation. It's perfectly lovely as is. How wonderful that Grandma VanDoren shared her recipe with her family. It's always such a shame when a beloved recipe is forever lost because it was never shared with loved ones. How nice of you to share it with us. Thank you.

I wouldn't say this bread tastes better than the ones bought from supermarkets. I found it's oily and quite different than the bought ones. After all hard work, I don't think I'll make this again. And, I'd better go back to the supermarket to get my favourite brand.

I have tried many white bread recipes on this site (don't know how i missed this one for so long) and they all turned out well and looked great BUT had no real flavor.  This one tastes like homemade bread should taste!!  So glad i finally tried it!  Easy to make, i used AP flour and it didn't seem to matter, and the result is wonderful!  I can't recommend this enough- try it!

I haven't reviewed anything on this site as of yet.  However, I do make recipes from here daily.  This recipe is EXCEPTIONAL!  Everyone in my house was completely bowled over by it.  I didn't have quite enough yeast, (only had three packs of rapid rise) so wasn't really sure how it would turn out.  It was fantastic.  Took the advice of another review and froze two loaves.  They came out of the freezer the next morning.  Great recipe!

This is a wonderful sandwich bread when you need a classic, sturdy white slice. Perfect for BLTs, egg salad or PB&J. The dough freezes well so if, like me, you can't use up three loaves at a time.   Thanks for sharing this great recipe. Your grandmother must have been quite a cook.

Excellent recipe even though I really messed it up, but it turned out SO GOOD. I was distracted by a service man at our house and spaced out adding 1 of the cups of liquid!  I meant to use 1 cup of the liquid substituting milk and I totally forgot about it.  So, I just used the two cups of water and started out my mix with 4 cups of the flour.  Because I messed it up and shorted the liquid, I only added a total of 6.5 or so cups of all-purpose flour (bread flour gets too dense in white sandwich bread for my tastes). I also added a tsp of diastatic malt powder, which gives my breads a nice, soft crumb.  Instead of the oil, I melted unsalted butter.  I shaped one loaf of dough into bread and made one 9x13 pan of cinnamon rolls and both bread and rolls turned out HEAVENLY.  Probably the nicest loaves I've made in ages.  Next time I'll stick to that recipe and cut back on the yeast by 1 TBS and keep everything else just as it is.  Perfect!  Thanks cable guy and thanks Grandma Van Doren!

I am a new bread maker.  I halfed the recipe because I was using a bread maker but didn't change anything else.  The bread turned out wonderful.  My husband says it is my best yet.  I will be using this recipe at least once a week from now on.  Thank you

I followed the recipe exactly!  What a great dough.  Overall, very easy and very tasty.  I would closely watch the cooking time though.  As she notes,I definitely had to put foil over the top to keep it from burning.  I will definitely make it again and again!

Awesome!  I really love that the recipe yields a full 3 loaves.  If I plan to make bread I want to make more than 1 loaf!  I also like that there is so little kneading.  Way to go!

The last time I made bread was with a bread machine and a package. Today since it was -15c outside I decided to try this bread recipe.( plus it is laundry day-so what else is one to do than make bread) This recipe is amazing . Very simple to do and  it makes great bread.  ( I was worried about a draft so I let 2 of the 3 loafs rise in the laundry room and one on top of the fridge. The loafs from the luandry room turned out higher and alot better  than the other one.). This is indeed a keeper recipe.

It seemed like 3 tablespoons of yeast was too much, compared to my other bread recipes, so I used 4t and it still came out wonderful.  Great texture.

Excellent!! I love that it makes 3 loafs at once! It's fantastic! Keep one (or two) for yourself and give the other to a neighbor. Love it! I used all purpose flour and it worked perfectly!

I have several recipes for white bread, and all of them are good, but they all lack something.  Either it is too dense or it tastes "old" too fast, or some other thing that keeps me looking for another recipe.  I think I have finally found it!  This is super simple, especially for someone who enjoys NOT using a bread machine.  The taste is phenomenal, and as long as you keep air from getting to it, as you would any other loaf of bread, it remains moist and flavorfull.  After it cooled, I gave a piece to each of my kids and my husband, and they all agreed it was the best ever.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It's hard to mess up this recipe.  We make it twice a month instead of sandwich bread from the store.  Grilled cheeses are delicious with this bread! This last time, I made 2 loaves and about 10 rolls in a muffin pan.  I made a rectangle, sprinkled basil and rolled it up like cinnamon rolls. Let it rise in muffin pan until double and bake at 350 for 15-20 mins. If you brush the loaves and rolls with egg wash---Wow!! Thank you for this family favorite recipe!

This is a great recipe.  Easy to make and safe for our daughter who has fatal food allergies to egg, milk and soy. I add a little more sugar to make it sweeter.  Freezes wonderfully baked, gonna experiment with freezing a doughball to see how that works.

I haven't made much bread - I'm a cake and cookie expert, though - and this recipe was so easy!  It rose quickly and made three, nice, big, fluffy loaves of bread.  I had to try it straight out of the oven.  The crust was nice and crusty and the inside wonderfully soft.  No dense loaves here!  I can only imagine it with soup or peanut butter and jelly - that is if it lasts that long!  Thanks for a great recipe!

A really great recipe! My husband and kids are in love! For being fairly new to making bread, it was well explained, easy to follow and delivered airy, tall, soft inside and a beautiful crust. My hubby won't even eat store bought anymore! I will definitely continue to come back to this recipe for my bread making needs!

This was actually my first attempt at making bread. I chose this recipe b/c it looked the most appetizing. I believe I did it right, and it tasted the way it was intended to. Giving it 2 stars..it was much lower than my expectations. Wasn't the taste and texture I was going for.

I have made this several times now and it is so easy.  When I first started making bread I avoided this recipe as I thought the sponge as oppose to the traditional proofing yeast then adding flour, salt, oil etc was the proper way to make bread.  One day however I decided to give it a try - and no looking back.  I got up Christmas morning at 6 a.m. and made this recipe.  The equivilant on one loaf I made into "Cinnamon Rolls from the land of Nod"  The other two I made into loaves for the day.  Between 8:30 - 9 o'clock - everything was done!  This recipe is so quick to make!  Rises like a dream and very quickly - better then any other recipe I have made.  I am making again this morning after watching the video for the first time.  It states to let rise approx 1 hour or until double.  I knew I mine never took that long to rise but today I decided to see what happened.  The timer has about 36 minutes left on it and the bread in to the top of the bowl! (first rise)  There is no way I will let it go the full hour (if someone has, I'd love to know how it turned out)  I'm scared if I leave it that the yeast will exhaust itself.
I have made with both less salt and less sugar - always with good results.  ENJOY!  We do everytime I make it, the bread disappears at family gatherings - from the oldest to the youngest there - everyone enjoys!

Wow!!  My Mom (74) said this is the best bread she has ever eaten.  I did not add the salt with the sponge as I had heard it can  the yeast, so I mixed the salt in with the last four cups of flour which were added when sponge was ready.  I also made a batch using 3 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup white for the sponge.  After kneading I put in fridge and left over night before dividing into loaves.  A big hit with lots of flavor due to the cool rise!

Excellent bread!  I used all-purpose flour, reduced the recipe by 1/3, and made two loaves in disposable 9"x5" pans - they came out great.  I did find that the dough rose very quickly on a humid summer day in New England.  The first rise took about 45-50 mins, but the second and third rises only took about 20 mins each.  Also, I took the loaves out of the oven after about 30-31 mins, and they were perfect - so keep a close eye on them as they're baking!   This bread is exactly what I was hoping it would be: soft, slightly chewy white bread with a flavorful top crust and a hint of sweetness throughout.  It's great with butter and a little cinnamon sugar; it also made for a very tasty ham sandwich.

This bread did not turn out the crispy crust like I'd hoped for. However, It was easy to make, this was the first bread I've made from scratch. This bread would be great for sandwiches.

This bread was good but not quite what I had expected. Other reviewers stated that this bread works well with regular self-rising flour but I used it and didn't get what I expected. I will make this again and use the bread flour instead to see what the recipe is really supposed to taste like.

Oddly enough, I tried doing something weird-- I left out the oil, sugar, and salt. I thought they would turn out just ok, but they were great! I loved them (because I love bread for its plainess), so if you want actual bread, just follow the recipe.

This was my first time making homemade bread.  I made Jam the day before so my family was excited to try this.  It turned out great.  Thanks for an easy recipe.

Between this recipe and Amish White Bread, I can't decide which I like best.  I can say that I love that this makes 3 loaves.  We don't buy bread from the store any more, so this works out well - we usually use one loaf/week and freeze the rest.  The dough was probably the best I've ever worked with - so soft and smooth! I took it out of my KA and kneaded by hand after it was thoroughly mixed. I added 3T of vital wheat gluten.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Made this earlier this week and it turned out great! I made 2 loaves and 1 pan of dinner rolls, the only thing I did different was I did not have quite 3 T. of yeast since I had 3 yeast packets but it rose great, and I added all the flour when mixing it and let it rise twice.  This made wonderful toast and I'll be sure to make it again.

I LOVE this bread!  I make it 2-3 times a month, and each time it dissapears.  I have a family of 6, so I like the fact that it makes 3 loaves so there is plenty to go around.  I have also used the dough to make cinnamon rolls, and they have come out wonderful as well!

This bread is wonderful!  I am new to the bread-making world,  and this is an amazing recipe!  The bread is the perfect consistency.  I covered the bread for the last 5 min.  of baking (after 30 min.) and it turned out great.  User friendly and super yummy!

Made this bread today. Only thing I changed, was that I added 1/2 cup more sugar b/c DH complained about the bread I had made last time (that amish one from this website) was too sour for his taste. It came out great though. It baked beautifully. Tryed some of the dough for pizza. The extra sugar made it a bit weird, but the texture was still very good. Next time will follow the recipe as is and try it again :D

Very easy bread to make.  I substituted one cup of the white flour with half wheat germ half ground flax seed for added fiber benefit.  I am watching three loaves rise as I type, and can't wait for the end results!

We make homemade bread often and I have to congratulate Grandma VanDoren for the fabulous recipe - easy to make, light, and extremely tasty - Don't make just one batch, we have 4 kids and this stuff disappears as soon as its cool enough to eat.  5 stars for an excellent, make again keeper!

Excellent recipe, excellent bread... all kinds of things can affect how well a bread turns out, from nearly-dead yeast to too much humidity. And, I mixed and kneaded by hand, the way it would have been made originally. Simply fabulous!

Very easy, and bakes up well.  But it is, when all is said and done, a basic white bread.   Bf was ecstatic--I'm not a white bread fan, but he loves it.  So periodically I make it for him.   Thanks for the recipe--I'll keep it on hand for the bf.

Thank You-Thank You for sharing this awesome recipe.  I live at a high altitude but this recipe worked perfectly.  Less than two hours from start to oven.  It rises incredibly quickly and is simply the best of many I have tried.  I only baked it for 35 min.  Soooo easy!

I have been making bread for over 50 years and like to try different recipes. This is by far the best recipe i have ever came across. I used all-purpose flour as it is all i had on hand. I used kosher salt,and i did the recipe by hand not mixer . it is SOooooo very good. i got 3 loaves from the batch. Shared loaf with my brothers and i keep loaf. had a slice for dinner and iam still licking my chops lol. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe and thank you Grandma, Goog job!!! Janet

Loved this bread!  Nice and fluffy, easy to make, great for sandwiches ... doesn't keep as well as some breads I've tried, but, if you are going to eat it over a 24-hour period, a great bread!

This was so easy and made 3 fabulous loaves. I've already passed the recipes on to friends and family. It now has a permanent place in my recipe box. 
The second time I made it I turned one of the loaves into cinnamon rolls - they turned out wonderful!

Yumilicious!  For the 3 parts, I used one as a bread loaf, another for cinnamon rolls, and I'm saving the last for pizza dough!  So far, the bread is great and the cinnamon rolls look irresistable!  WOOHOO!

I was hesitant to try the sponge method but this bread was AMAZING!  We LOVED it! I also loved being able to put it up in the freezer too.  The bread was soft and light, with a nice crust.

This is the best white bread!  Simple and old-fashioned...  I also use this recipe (cut in half) to make scones.  I follow the recipe through the first rise, then roll it out into flat round softball size discs, and fry them up.  We top them with jam, honey, nutella, cinnamon sugar...  My husband LOVES them!

I'd give this recipe 10*'s if I could. It's such an easy recipe with great results each time. I've made it several times, once it didn't rise like it had before, but the bread was still delicious. I use all purpose flour with no problems. I agree with Jan, it does make the best grilled cheese sandwiches...you have to try it. The only thing is once you make this bread for your family they won't let you stop! And it goes fast! Thanks Grandma VanDoren!

Absolutely fantastic recipe!  

I halved it and used half white and half whole wheat flour.  I underestimated the size of loaf this would make so it made one superduper large 9x5 loaf.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I baked for Christmas Dinner.  I usually make dinner rolls but opted for loaves this time.  This was a perfect recipe.  It was very easy and not as time consuming as dinner rolls.  I will take others suggestions and try adding cheese and herbs next time.

A great white bread. What I did---I halved the recipe, using only 2 teaspoons of yeast and added 1/4 cup dry powdered milk and made it in my bread machine on the dough cycle. It made 1 loaf of bread and 9 nice sized rolls. YUMMY!!!!

Very tasty bread. Everyone in my family loved it. I made only one loaf. I used 3/4 cup water, 2 cups bread flour, 3 tsp yeast, 3/4 tsp salt, 1.2 tablespoon vegetable oil (canola & soybean oil), and just a little less than a tablespoon white sugar. It came out perfect. Thanks for sharing the recipe. I love your grandma.

I really enjoyed baking this bread, it was so easy to make and didn't take much of my time. I used only half of the recipe. When I was ready to bake it, I greased my pans with butter and lightly floured the bottoms. This is by far the best and easiest white bread that I've made. There are so many options to use this bread as well! I am thinking of using this recipe for upcoming hoildays! Thank you for sharing your Grandma's bread recipe!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  Made it yesterday.  Such an easy recipe. I used 4 packs of rapid rise yeast and made it into cinnamon swirl loaves.  Made the 3 loaves and kept one and gave daughter and son each one.  Hubby finished ours at breakfast this morning and request that I make this more often.  Daughter called and said it was fantastic.  I put powdered sugar icing on loaf.  Toasted and buttered it... absolutely the best bread ever.  Warning though if you toast it be very careful not to touch the icing....really hurts if you do, I know!!  This is now my white bread recipe.

This bread is sooo yummy!  I really enjoyed it.  I cut the recipe down to make just one loaf, and it turned out well.  I only had a 9x5 loaf pan, and so the bread was kind of flat, but it still tasted awesome!  I put some strawberry jam on it and everything.  Definitely a keeper!  Now I wonder if it'll go well in a bread machine.  :-D

I have a problem keeping white bread moist once it cools off. It also has a problem raising to a desireable height. No such problems with this one. I love that it is a sponge. I cut down the raising time GREATLY!

I gave this recipe the privilage of being the first bread i have ever made, and let me tell you, for a 19 year old like my self it was easy and delicious. I gave it to my boyfriend and he just loved it. It turns out perfect for me everytime, and what i really like to do is use it to make garlic bread!

Wonderful and very easy recipe.  I didn't end up baking it for the full 35 minutes, but it was still excellent.  My husband said that it was the best bread he's ever eaten, and he never wants store bought bread again.

oh my goodness... this tasted so good!! Nice light crunchy crust, and a fluffy interior... and best of all, it didn't taste of yeast like so many other recipes did. =D It was VERY chewy... my family commented that its texture reminded them of 'fat kueh' (a type of asian steamed cake which is moist and sticky and gummy). So I guess next time I'll substitute a little all-purpose for some of the bread flour. All in all though, its a simple and easy recipe that makes for great results.

Wonderful bread! I've been making bread for 10 yrs and have never found a recipe that I loved for white bread until now!  Loved the simplicity of the ingredients, easy bread to make and tastes wonderful!! I made one loaf to try this afternoon, used all-purpose flour and kneaded it with a dough hook. Thank you for sharing.

This recipe makes a great high altitude loaf. Be warned: when the recipe calls for a large bowl, it means a REALLY large bowl. I've added whole wheat for half of the flour, and that works great, too.

First time I ever made bread, and it turned out wonderfully. My second batch I added 1 cup of skimmed milk powder with the warm water, and it turned out great - a little softer than the original.

Very good recipe. The bread came out very fluffy and tasty. However, I spent most of a day kneading it and letting it rise. It's a good recipe if you have alot of time.

Made this bread right after I found the recipe. It was good bread, but not what I had hoped for. Seemed a bit too chewy for my taste. All-in-all a good recipe, albeit not the most simple to make.
