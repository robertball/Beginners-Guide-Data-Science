This is a beatiful, tasty beverage that everyone will enjoy. The acidity of the fruit counterpoints the rich creamy salmon perfectly.
It's an odd combination, but it works! You may be surprised - give it a try!

I just want to thank you for submitting this recipe, because it includes all of my favorite ingredients in one, healthy sitting!  I just love the fish/fruit combo!  You have a unique talent for finding the perfect, yet odd combinations in ingredients and I recommend making a cookbook-- i would be one to buy it!  Thanks again!

This is a great recipe. It's too bad that there are ignorant people out there who would call this a joke or a bad dream without even trying it. This is a really good way to have a protein smoothie without all of the artificial protien powders. It just takes creamy. My fiance and I didn't really notice the fish. I though it tasted much better than the chemically processed powder we would normally use to get our protien. Thank you Kayla!

This went over big at my last auto show tailgate party! I recomend a portable blender.

I never though this recipe was a joke. Made exactly as written and definitely earned 5 stars. No you can't taste the salmon. The smoothie tastes like any other fruit smoothie with the added protein. Great recipe Kayla!
