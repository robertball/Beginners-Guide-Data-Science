I've used many Garam Masala's in my cooking because my husband is from Punjab and we both enjoy Indian food.  I use to make my own Garam Masala but found it too time consuming to make from scratch, I tried this recipe because it used less ingredients than what I am used to cooking with.  Sorry but it was lacking in the rich flavour that I am use to.  

I have also tried some other brands like McCormick's and was disappointed at the blend.  I just recently discovered the most amazing Garam Masala when I visited a Farmers Market in Port Moody area close to Vancouver BC.  It was amazing, it was a punjabi style garam masala that can be used for hundreds of recipes. It seriously reminded me of my mother-in-laws cooking back in punjab! You can get it online from IndiaBase Canada's website.  

Sharmila masala's is another brand that I truly love, but its a bit hard to find.  

Making Garam Masala is an art and often takes several tries before getting it right!

Hope this review helped!

I loved this stuff. I used whole spices though, roasted them together on dry pan until you could smell the aroma and then ground them all up. Was perfect on chicken tandoori and pulav.

I wanted to make Moroccan Lentil Soup from this site and of course couldn't find garam masala at my grocery store.  I don't do much Indian cooking at all, and didn't even know if it was a powder or paste or something else.  Thankfully did a search, this popped up and my soup is smelling wonderful as it simmers away!  I also added this to my "spice mix" list - for Christmas I gave someone little bottles of Taco Seasoning, Tourtiere Spice Mix and my own poultry seasoning mix.  Plan on doing the same as part of an upcoming bridal shower gift, but will add a jar of this to it!

I had a curry recipe that called for garam masala.  I searched the grocery store endlessly (including bulk spices and specialty areas) with no luck.  I was so happy to find this "quick fix" on Allrecipes.  I thought this was the perfect blend of seasonings- the curry tasted delicious and authentic.  I ground my own coriander because I only had whole on hand.  Otherwise, left everything the same.  Thanks for the recipe- I will use this from now on any time I need garam masala!

Why purchase garam masala from a grocery store if you already have the spices on hand? I use this blend in many Indian dishes, and I feel like it makes my cooking even more authentic and "from scratch."

I have never purchased garam masala and I didn`t know its flavor. I used this recipe to make Indian dishes. I used all spices, roasted them for 1-2 min (until you could smell the aroma), then ground them. I think, great for use in all Indian recipes.

I bought most of the spices whole and grinded them in the coffee grinder. Used this in my oatmeal (surprisingly good) as well as a chicken thigh marinade by mixing into yogurt and seasoning with salt.

I, too, needed this for the Moroccan Lentil soup. It was easy to make and added with a little sugar and black tea, makes a great, quick Chai beverage!  I love this site!

Just what I needed! I didn't have time to round up whole spices; frankm7 is right, whole is best, but in a pinch, this worked well.

So grateful to have found this recipe since I can no longer find garam masala in my local supermarkets!  Luckily, I had all the spices listed in this recipe, threw this together exactly as written, and used it in my crockpot chicken makhani.  I can't say whether this is *traditional* garam masala, but I CAN say it worked wonderfully in my chicken makhani.  For those of you who prefer the convenience of using pre-ground spices to make your garam masala, I highly recommend this recipe!

Perfect! I had a little left and couldn't find it at my grocery store.  I came home and made it from spices I already had in my kitchen, mixed it with the little store bought stuff I had left and VOILA!  Perfect and easy!

It's been a while since I've been able to get my hands on real garam masala, so I'm sort of going from memory, but this tastes and smells pretty much like the real thing!  I was out of cardamom so didn't use it and I suspect my coriandor was kaput since it didn't smell like much, but still - an excellent substitute!

Much easier than the hour drive I have to any decent spice shop (for whole or ethnic spice blends). My curry tasted the same as when I use the store garam masala.

I thought I had this ready made spice mix in my pantry, so I didn't buy anymore at the store.  When it was time to add it to the recipe, I couldn't find the jar.  Luckily I had all the ingredients that your recipe called for!  I easily mixed it up, and it saved the dish!!

Soooooo good!  Seems very close to what I get from our local Indian restaurant.  I assume "ground pepper" means black peppercorns and not red pepper flakes or something else. (?)

I love this!  So easy to make and it adds great flavour without too much heat.  I love to saute onions, ground turkey and spinach with this as the seasoning.... yum!

While this is indeed a good substitute I must say something. Garam Masala is Indian and in no way Moroccan. I lived in Morocco and no spice blends are used.

I needed garam masala for "Gobi Aloo (Indian Style Cauliflower with Potatoes) (also from allrecipes.com)."  This recipe worked out great and I have more next time I need garam masala.

Love it, thanks.  Don't have anything really to compare it to bc I don't think I've tried garam masala by itself, but another recipe that saved me from buying another spice.  I so don't need another one!  I subbed curry powder for coriander bc I didn't think I had any, then I found some.  I'm not sure what I was thinking bc now I have two jars of coriander . . . .(see what I mean?  I don't need anymore!  Can't even find what I have bc I have so many!!).  Anyway, thanks!  Perfect for the butter chickpea recipe on this site.

A very delicious spice combination that worked really well in 'Chicken Shawarmas' from AR.  I only mixed up one-fourth a recipe as that is all I needed for 1 large chicken breast.  We really enjoyed the taste of this and I look forward to finding other recipes that use garam masala in it.  Not sure how close this is to the store bought version, but for us, it worked great and we loved the taste.

What a wonderful way to mix up some garam masala, when it is needed for a recipe. From what I know of the taste and smell this was pretty darn close. I only needed enough for a recipe, so I just mixed a little up. I did an equal amount of all of the ingredients. Only change I made was leaving out the cardomon, because it is expensive. Nutmeg is similar, so a little extra of that can be added. I also subbed allspice for the cloves, because they are similar, but cloves remind me too much of Christmas. This mix is fool proof and worked great for what I needed it for. ty

I could not find Garam Masala at the store to make an Indian Butter Chicken recipe I wanted to make.  I used this.. not sure if it is good or not as I have never tasted Garam Masala before but will say it saved my recipe to be able to make my own.  Be aware taht Cardamom is VERY expensive for a spice... I paid $10 for a small bottle.

Looking for an alternative to store bought curry powder when making Curried Mustard Greens with Kidney Beans from this sight.  Though we were missing coriander and nutmeg, this was still wonderful...., HOWEVER, MY HUSBAND'S PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO REDUCE THE CUMIN A BIT..., HE LOVES IT TO BE STRONG IN TEX MEX, BUT NOT SO MUCH HERE (sorry, that's a note to self..., I personally loved it as is).  We look forward to trying this with the proper ingredients next time.    My husband might even enjoy the cumin with the appropriate changes.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Thank you! My husband keeps urging me go try cooking Indian food at home, but I didn't want to have to buy a whole bottle of spice I might or might not end up liking. All other recipes were for toasting and grinding whole spices, which I rarely have on hand. This recipe hit the spot perfectly!

I used only 2 tsps of this to make Chicken Makhani (Indian Butter Chicken). Since I've never had Garam Masala or Chicken Makhani and have nothing to compare it with, I thought the dish was exceptional!

If taste is king, then this recipe needs adjustment.
First of all, no cloves (it's perfum).
Second, use 1 green and 2 black cardamom pods  not 1.5 teaspoons worth, the black ones are smoky, green more perfumy hence the former.
Lastly use 3/8 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/8 mace.

Because one of the ingredients is cinnamon, its recommended to add the garam masala at the end of cook time.

Absolutely delicious.  I have never had garam masala from a store.  But I used this recipe to make Chicken Tikka Masala after having it in a restaurant, and my homemade version comes out amazing every time with this spice recipe.

Too much cumin - try 1 or 1 1/2 teaspoons of ground BLACK cumin (charnushka or kalonji) and also add in 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger.

I gave it 4 stars because it shouldn't contain cloves or nutmeg (I usually buy this seasoning from a Lebanese store and I've used it for years and nowhere does it list cloves or even nutmeg).

Very good and I like to use it on stir fried cabbage.  Fry/saute cabbage red, green or both, with onion, garlic and then sprinkle on either fresh or dry fennell seed.  Use the garam masala sparingly at first until you get the taste to your liking.  It doesn't sound like it would all go together, but it really does!

Love this recipe. Have made it twice and doubled the second time I made it and keep it in a small mason jar. Taste great on roasts, chicken, lamb and just about anything. I do occasionally sprinkle in a bit of cayenne for a bit of heat. Everyone loves when I make a roast with this seasoning.

I love this recipe. The scent is bold and makes my mouth water for Indian food. The flavor is full. I use it in many recipes. It tastes great as a spice over baked sweet potatoes and a sprinkle of olive oil.

This taste amazing! I used the same salt amount in the marinade, and cut the salt by a two thirds in the Marsala sauce.. I made naan bread with it (from scratch) , and it was a hit in my house full of picky eaters!! Even my 3 yr old ate it!! Yay!! Success!!

I was making an Indian dish and had no garam masala.  I found this recipe and did as many others.  In my case, I added all the spices whether ground or whole and roasted them very quickly in my pan, then I ground it all up in the coffee grinder.  I liked this recipe very much and it was much easier than going to go buy garam masala at a specialty store.  I recommend this recipe!

I live very far away from any sort of store which sells Indian food, and wanted to try making some...so I was left to my own designs to find substitutes for the spices.  So I followed this recipe, and the only things I had to buy were the cardamom (expensive!) and the cilatro/coriander.

I only used 1/2 tsp of cumin as I really really do NOT like cumin, but I know that it'd be missing something without a bit of it.  I used extra cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.  I combined all the stuff into a cermaic mortar/pestle and combined it that way.  Ended up very floral and fragrant!  Very intersting combination.  Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe is a life saver. I am an American who lives in Bulgaria and I needed Garam Masala to make butter chicken. In Bulgaria, you can't find garam masala ANYWHERE. However, all of these ingredients were available and resulted in some of the best butter chicken I have ever had! Thank you so much!

Of course I was out of some of the spices so I substituted pumpkin pie seasoning for the cinnamon, cardamon, nutmeg, coriander and cloves.  It was probably a little heavy on the cinnamon but I was probably the only one that noticed.  The dish was definitely better with the Garm Masala, than without it.  Much better!  I love cinnamon, so to me it tasted great.

Even though I’m a rookie to Indian food, I made my own garam masala from this recipe to go into another recipe - I was nervous about cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg because my American palette associates that stuff with sweets, but I found this mixture very tasty and the the cinnamon, nutmeg and clove flavors made sense in the curry dish I put it in... Cool!

Great spice blend. I didn't have coriander, so I substituted curry powder instead, since the first ingredient is coriander.

Making my fourth triple batch!  Easy as the  name says. The biggest problem was initially finding all of the ingredients but now have enough for many batches.  I would recommend grinding the whole ingredients outside after dry roasting.  My husband had a respiratory issue and grinding the mix inside aggravated his condition.
Love this receipe!

Not quite as good as toasting whole spices and doing this the "real" way, but an easy substitute for the pre-ground masala mixes at the store.

Thank you, whoever contributed this recipe! I didn't have any garam masala and wanted to make dinner tonight. I had all of these spices, and whipped this up in no time. I also toasted them in a dry skillet for a little first. This was so incredibly delicious and flavorful, AND it cost me nothing! They wanted $5 for a tiny jar of this at my local market. This will be a staple in my household.

In my opinion, this blend did not have enough of what I call the "perfumey" spices, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves.

I needed garam masala in order to make Red Curry Chicken Chili from this site so I made my own. I didn't have cardamom, so I left it out; and I did have star anise pods, so I put them in, because I thought they'd be fun. And they were. Nice combination of flavors. Yum. Thank you!

This worked just perfect for my butter chicken recipe that calls for garam masala. I could not taste much of a difference between this and the Suraj brand I normally buy. Makes enough to add to your spice rack and then some. I substituted ground parsley flakes for the coriander I didn't have.

This is a warming spice.   I added New Mexico chile, mustard,  and turmeric .  I also tripled the  amount of coriander and increased most spices to get the right blend.  

I have not seen a Garam Masala mix without chile before.

I made this and it was AWESOME.  I really liked the cinnamon. If I make another batch, I'll go heavier on the cinnamon and clove just for personal preference but it was just the right ending to the Chicken Curry I made.  This recipe made my chicken curry go from great to AWESOME!

Added 1/2 tsp of tumeric and 1/2 tsp ground mustard (trying to match look and smell of one I bought at an Indian market). I think I'll be using this from now on :-)

Making Keema Aloo (recipe on here - The Meatetarian, recipe author).  That recipe called for garam masala, but I didn't have any.  A search on Allrecipes and I find this one!  It's my go-to garam masala spice mix.  :D

Really tasty and smells so good as the dish you use it in is cooking! .I used this with a Weight Watchers recipe for Spiced Roasted Butternut Squash. It was delicious!! I especially appreciated the recipe because my husband is allergic to coriander, so I was able to leave that out.

Having never had this spice blend before I've nothing to compare it to...however, the recipe I made it for ('Chicken Shawarmas' from this site) was scrumptious and now I can't wait to find more recipes using this fabulous spice combo. The only change I made was having to grind up my coriander, only had whole on hand. Thanks for saving me from sticker shock at the grocery store!

Great substitution.  I use it generously and it really adds authentic flavor.

Hubby made this to use in the Indian Butter Chicken recipe that is also on this site (and excellent that I might add).  This spice mixture was spot on as far as I can tell...of course I'm Polish-Italian and not Indian  :-)

This is great. Glad I don't have to buy it premade ever again! Next time, I'll add paprika, cayenne pepper, crushed bay leaves and either caraway seed or fennel seed. I'll probably make a big batch and keep it in my pantry for future use :o) Thanks!

Easy substitute for packaged garam masala.  I made a bit extra so I can add it to other recipes.
