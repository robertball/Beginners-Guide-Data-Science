I rubbed the salmon fillets with ground pepper, paprika and 4-5 cloves of finely minced garlic, just like an earlier review recommended.  The taste of garlicy brie cheese was heavenly!!  I also substituted a ripe pear for one mango (as I only had one) and it turned out great!  I added a pinch of salt and about 1/2 tsp of sugar to the mango/pear mixture as it cooked to enhance the flavours of the fruit.  Next time, I would make DOUBLE the amount of mango sauce as it is a terrific topper for basmati rice - maybe it would be even better with a splash of coconut milk?  I may also add some finely minced fresh cilantro to the mango mixture the next time I try this.  For those of you who are concerned about the amount of fat in the brie cheese, use some light mozzarella cheese instead.  This was so refreshing!!

I wanted this to be so delicious. It's 3 of my favorite things in the world, all together in one dish! In reality, it was just OK. The flavors didn't work as well together as I would have thought. The brie gets a little lost. I'd make it again, but I'll have to play around with the ingredients, maybe a less flavorful fish or a stronger-tasting cheese. One warning - make sure your mangos are very ripe, or you won't have a sauce, you'll have caramelized mango chunks. Mine were way to underripe to turn into a sauce. We still enjoyed them as a "warm mango salsa" sort of thing, but if you're looking for an actual sauce, start with mushy mangos.

Recommend the following changes:
*add garlic to pan before adding mangoes
*mix in 1 tbsp of brown sugar with the mangoes

This was fantastic, I LOVE the combo of brie and salmon. I enjoyed even more the second time when I used an asian pear and a fuji apple instead of the mango, then cooked them in a little bit of maple syrup. Made a nice, crunchy contrast to the smooth brie and salmon.

This recipe is fantastic! The only problem that I ran into is that the brie melted almost completely off the salmon, but I just layered more brie on before ladling the mago sauce on. For the mango topping, the mangos I started with were a bit unripe, so I took another reviewers advice and blended them in the blender first. I think this greatly facillitated with making it smooth, for the unblended chunks never got smooth on their own. I also added some lemon juice, some brown sugar, and a pinch of cayenne pepper. It was great over the rice I served on the side. Be prepared to make extras, but don't expect any leftovers, everything was scraped clean! This is one of my favourite recipes and the only reason it isn't getting 5 stars is because of how much I changed it. Have fun with it!

This was very good! We made the salmon on the grill on a cedar board. At the very end laid the brie on top to melt-- which only took a couple of minutes-- the cedar board added a great smokey flavor to it all.  As for the sauce, on other reviewers suggestion I added a pinch of cayanne pepper. I used jarred mangoes and added a tiny bit of the juice from the jar as well so that they could cook up better.  They didnt get completely smooth, which could be remedied by putting in blender, however we liked the sauce just fine with the small chunks of mango.

This was sooooooooo delicious! My husband was very skeptical about the mangos but that was really what made the whole dish come together. I didn't have Brie cheese so I used Munster instead, but next time I would like to try the Brie.  Another review mentioned that if the mango is not ripe enough you just get caramelized mangos which I ended up with but it was still very tasty. Very easy to make and not much time and clean up.

I'm not sure how I feel about this recipe. The mango mix was delicious, and I love brie cheese. I followed previous suggestions to add some punch to the salmon with salt and pepper. It definitely would have been bland without it, in my opinion. In retrospect, the idea of cheese, even something like brie, just seems weird for fish.

This recipe was delicious!  So flavorful and easy.  The only thing I would suggest would be to add a dab more brie on each piece of salmon a couple of minutes before it's done baking.

really good!  I sauted garlic in my cast iron skillet before searing the salmon in it.  I also toasted some coconut to serve on top.  
Went great with coconut rice, will def make again.

Everyone I've made this dish for has loved it.  I usually add a little garlic, fresh ground pepper, and paprika to the salmon before searing, but that's just because my boyfriend is a garlic lover.  The recipe is perfect just as it is.  Thanks so much.

I don't think the flavors worked well together... salmon is naturally fatty and the brie cheese just added to it.

YUMMY! My boyfriend and I made this tonight, and loved it. We altered the mango sauce a little, and simmered it with about a half cup of coconut milk, and added about 2 tsps of sweet chili sauce and lime juice. It added a little bit of asian flair, and the brie mellows it out perfectly.

This one's pretty good.  The salmon, brie & mango flavors combined very well together.  I think it needed a lot more seasoning added, though I'm not sure what would be best.  The mango sauce was fabulous though, I enjoyed that by itself!  Went great with asparagus.

This was awesome! I made it for my family who isn't too fond of salmon or brie (I'm in love with both), and now they can't get enough of either!  It was perfect over rice with some greens on the side.  I can't wait to make this again!

My husband, eldest son and myself loved this! However, rather than baking the salmon, my husband grilled it (after seasoning it as he usually does.) We added the brie to the fish on the grill and let it melt a bit. Served with the mango sauce it was amazing! My two younger kids were not keen on the taste of the brie, but definitely liked the mango sauce. We will certainly have again!

I loved it.  I thought it was very simple to make and very tasty. I followed the recipe closely except for some kosher salt rubbed into the salmon prior to cooking.  I thought the cooking times listed were longer than necessary. I will not be making this recipe often though because my kids did not like it too much - they prefer their flavors separated. They love salmon grilled with just a little lemon pepper seasoning - how boring.

This was amazing.  The only thing I'd recommend is adding the brie with about 2-3 minutes left baking the salmon, I did this because I wanted the cheese a bit more gooey.

The recipe by itself is great, however, it needs a bit improvement here and there to make the presentation way more appealing: I had the mango sauce (with fresh mint leaves by the way...) on the side and the brie was added almost around serving, this way doesn't get messy and your plate looks like 5 star cooking.  A real keeper!!!!

I cooked this recipe with halibut instead of salmon and it was still wonderful!  Only change I'll make next time is more mango sauce.  Using ripe mangos was a great suggestion.

I thought this was great! I used creamy swiss wedges on top of each fillet, instead of the brie. I also puree'd the mangoes after cooking them. They never did get "smooth", but the blender did the trick!! Regardless, the flavors together were AMAZING!! Maybe the swiss is a better flavor than the brie?

This was wonderful! I followed the recipe pretty closely and it was absolutely delicious.  I would never have thought to combine the three ingredients, but everything went together.  I served it with a spinach salad and it made a nice, flavorful summer dish.  Will definitely make it again!

This was just OK.  Nothing to write home about nor is it a dish that we would prepare again.  My husband and I love all the ingredients in this dish but once prepared it was underwhelming.  The leftovers that we have we actually removed the brie.

This recipe is great!  Everyone loved it and it was super easy to make.  I served it with rice pilaf and the winter fruit salad with lemon poppyseed dressing.  Great meal!

I sprinkled the salmon fillets with sea salt, black pepper, paprika and garlic salt. Although my mangos were fairly ripe, they stayed intact and didn't become smooth. I'm not too sure I like the combination of salmon with brie and mango, although separately, they're some of my favourite foods. Probably won't be making this again.

I tried this recipe and was amazed how good it was. The combination of the three ingedients blended together very well and it does not need anything. Easy to make and clean up was quick.

I thought this turned out just amazing.  The mangos were very sweet and refreshing which blended well with the fish and brie softer textures.

This was just okay.  It did taste good, but my husband and I like to taste our fish more.  Salmon is so tasty, that I don't think it needs to be smothered in brie and mangoes. I made the recipe because I love all the ingredients separately, and in the future that's how I'll keep enjoying them.

Granted I didn't use Brie, I used Feta and swiss.  I also followed another's advice to add garlic (1 clove) to the mango, and salt and pepper the salmon.  The salmon was great, the mango sauce/topping was great.  I am not so sure of the cheese.  My husband called it  "interesting" and "different."  I may try again in the future when I have Brie.  I thought it was tasty- I gave it a four and he gave it a 2/3.  I also used flash frozen salmon and frozen mango.  Enjoy!

Very easy to prepare and tastes so good! Make sure the mangos are ripe or it will be hard to make the sauce smooth.

Fantastic!  The salmon turned out perfectly flaked and moist.  The brie & fresh mango were perfect compliments!  And, best of all, it was so so quick (with very simple ingredients)... will definitely be making again and again!!  =)

This was an okay dish.  DH said it warmed up very well the next day, so that is definitely a plus.  Simple to prepare.  Not to sure I would make again, but definitely well worth doing at least once.

Wow!!!!  This recipe was great!  I cooked this for my parents, grandmother & husband - and they absolutely loved it.  I'm a big salmon lover - but this was over the top.  The recipe was a snap to follow - not alot of prep time or extra ingredients you had to worry about. And the end result was awesome!  The mango really added that something special.  I will definitely make this again.

Quick and easy. Seasoned the salmon with Tony Cacheres spice and herb seasoning. Just a quick browning turn in the frying pan (not the suggested time) then into the oven with the cheese. My mangoes were very ripe. So delicious.

This is a great recipe!  I thought the cooking time was way too long, but it was just perfect.  The only thing I changed:  I cooked the salmon in a non-stick fry pan for 3 minutes a side, then put all the salmon in a pyrex baking dish, followed the directions and covered the dish in tin foil.  It was terrific!! and easy!  I also cut the rind of the cheese - too bitter for me...
