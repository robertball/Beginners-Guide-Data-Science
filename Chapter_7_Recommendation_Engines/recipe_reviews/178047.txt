This has become a staple for us. I make it mini sized, and have it as side dish. *** DO NOT SKIP on sesame oil or soy sauce or garlic, these are the main flavor ingredient. Used ground turkey instead. Added a little jalapeno, and breadcrumbs. Used parseley and onions instead green onions and water chesnut.  Used real ginger and garlic.  Made toping of sauted onion and mushroom on the same pan in the left over running juices.

I served these up on a Friday night recently.  With the snow still on the ground, I fried them up on the stove.  They were excellent!  Everybody enjoyed them.  I did not stray too far from the recipe, but I certainly did not measure out any ingredients either.  They did not lack flavor as suggested by another reviewer. I always roll my burgers and then place them in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before flattening and cooking.  This helps them to stay together through cooking and enhances any flavors added...I was asked to make these again once barbecue season is back.

Wow!!! This was great, though I tweaked it a bit...  1/2lb each ground chuck, ground sirloin, and ground pork  A pretty nice Japanese sesame oil.  Added 1/2 table spoon hot Thai chili oil  Diced red onion and garlic rather than the powdered stuff.  Added an egg and some Italian bread crumbs as the mixture was a little wet.  I also let the meat sit for half an hour while my side cooked (Honey Roasted Red Potatoes found on this site)  Finally, I seared each patty on high and finished off in the oven.  I will definitely make this again. Lots of flavor, great aroma.  Paired great with Andrew Will Semillon...

I too used ground turkey to make these burgers and other than cutting back on the ginger, we all thought these were so good. Ground turkey needs a little help in the flavor department anyway and this really did it! Thank you!!

Not real crazy about the flavor.  Use less sesame oil and they'd probably be better, but I probably won't try them again.

We didn't have peanut oil or sesame oil to make these so maybe it affected the table. One of the seasonings was a bit overpowering to the palate and I actually think it was the onion powder. Overall it just seemed like a bunch of competing flavors.

I really liked all the flavors in this burger. I didn't have peanut oil so I used vegetable oil and then added a bit of sesame oil at the end of cooking. I wasn't sure whether I liked the water chestnuts or not. The texture was a bit different is all. I will have this again. It was a change from a regular burger.

We liked this but for our tastes we almost doubled the spices and grilled them with a store-bought spicy Sichuan sauce.  Served with a napa cabbage/carrot/peanut slaw and soba noodles. We would make again.

Loved these! Didn't have charcoal so we used the Forman grill. Had some Kikkoman wasabi sauce on top---yum!
