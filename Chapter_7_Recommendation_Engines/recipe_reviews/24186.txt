Quick and easy to prepare.  I added some cocktail sauce instead of the chili sauce and added some garlic powder and cayenne pepper as well.  I put it in the fridge overnight and thought it tasted better the second day.  I also thought it tasted nice cold.

This was great with fresh crabmeat, 1/2 cup mayo, cocktail sauce rather than chili sauce, and a tablespoon of Dijon mustard. It is really good served cold the next day.Thank you Chef Suzi-Q!

This dip was delicious!  You are supposed to serve it hot but it tastes just as good cold.  Very easy!

This was rather disappointing.  Took it to a New Year's Eve party, and only half of it was eaten.  No one even commented on it.

Took to office potluck and it was a hit! Served it with white corn tortilla chips which complimented it nicely. I found it a bit bland so I added a DASH of seasoning salt for the extra spice!

So good and easy. A bit too much bite for little children, but would recommend for anyone else who loves crab! A great dip!

Very good!  I served it cold and added diced red and yellow peppers-worked well.

DELISH! I love how incredibly simple this one was, & was a HIT with everyone! Next time think I'll add bacon & cocktail sauce for a bit more punch. Ãœ

I found it a little on the bland side. I added some schallots and a bit more chili sauce, as well as some parmesan cheese which helped a bit.

We loved this dip!  It is warm and rich and very filling.  I was surprised by all the reviews that said it was bland until I was giving the recipe to one of my guests.  When I read chili sauce I made the leap and used Sriracha.  My friend thought it meant ketchup like chili sauce.  Given the choice, I'd stick with the Sriracha.

Sorry, this was not a hit. It seemed like too much cream cheese, and it was like paste.  I ended up adding a can of baby shrimp, scallions and seasoning as well as some chopped water chestnuts to provide texture.  In the end, I couldn't "doctor" it up enough to make it good.  No one liked it before... or after.
