I read the comments about the nest not sticking together.  I added one cup of marshmallows and melted w/ the rest of the ingrediants.  Also I toasted the coconut - Yum!  I put paper muffin cups into a muffin pan.  I have a large scoop from Pampered Chef - this made for the perfect measure for these nest.  I then used my tart shaper to make the nest shape.

My teacher made this for our bakesale, but instead of jelly beans she used miniature candy eggs. It's cute and tastes great either way!

I added the cup of marshmallows as suggested by another reviewer. They stuck together very well. I also scooped them by the spoonful into a muffin pan so they would hold their shape. I let them cool for 45 min. and popped them out gently with a fork. They taste great!

These tasted much better than I expected.  On my second batch, though, I added more peanut butter and corn syrup so they would stay together easier.

These were a hit!  In addition to being adorable, they actually TASTE good too!  Took them to Easter dinner and they were "awww'd" over and gobbled up.  I too added some marshmallow creme and also green food coloring, and used a muffin pan to shape them.  Super easy and quick to whip up.  I would do these again...

These are so cute.  My kids and I made them for our family's Easter dinner. Everyone thought they were adorable; but no one ate them.  They look a lot better than they taste which was alright because I made them more for their appearance anyway.

These are pretty good.  I added some marshmellows to help them stick as well.   I found the peanut butter to be too over-powering, and I like green nests.  So I'll probably try a different recipe next time, and hand most of these out to the neighbors.

These little nests were extremely well received!   It was nice to find something to serve for one of my guests who is not eating flour however I did find that the nests weren't holding together as well as I wanted so I added another two tablespoons of corn syrup to make them stickier.  I then scooped up a tablespoon of nest and squeezed it tight into a ball, then pushed an indentation into the centre while pushing the edges up to form a nest shape.  I also put a drop of corn syrup into the centre of each nest to help hold the jellybeans in place.  Very cute and very tasty!  I would have rated this five stars  but felt that the nests wouldn't have stuck together without the extra corn syrup.

After reading the reviews about the lack of stickiness in order to form into birds nests (which I found to be true), I added 2 cups of marshmallows and added green food coloring. It isn't the best tasting cookie out there- but it is really cute and kids love them!

A great treat for Easter. I used the cup of marshmallows that others recommended and everything held together wonderfully. Everyone remarked about the cuteness and the taste was good, some people had seconds. I left out the brown sugar as it seemed it would be too sweet after adding in a cup of marshmallow.
