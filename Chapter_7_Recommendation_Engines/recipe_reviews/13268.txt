5 Stars is not enough!  Truly not enough!  Making soup is my specialty and this soup is amazing!  I had a special request for fish soup from a very picky eater, so when I found this recipe, I thought it sounded good.  I was amazed!  And the crock pot did most of the work!  I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned (the picky eater won't eat canned) and I used fresh mushrooms.  The picky eater gave this thumbs up, and after three bowls said that he wished he could eat more!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  I will add this to my soup repetoire, as it is fabulous and wonderful for Lent!  I was also skeptical about the orange juice and I added it, and am so happy that I did!  This is a 10 Star recipe!

Delicious and easy.  Just throw it all in the Crock Pot.  I substituted a bag of frozen seafood medley (shrimp, scallop, calamari) for the shrimp.

This recipe was great, I omitted the olives and substituted Tilapia instead of cod.  I slow cooked it all day and actually added the shrimp and fish at the same time.

I too made this on the stovetop. I added chopped fresh fennel (green stalk), chopped green beans, and a pinch of cayenne. I added the fish with the shrimp, about 10 minutes before serving. Quick and easy!

Despite the hot weather, for some reason I was craving a hearty soup for lunch today. I left out the green bell pepper (don't like it cooked) and the olives (didn't have any), and I used a fresh fennel bulb instead of seeds, and fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Because I was in a bit of a hurry, I cooked the soup in a pan on the stove top. Dang, this was SO good! Don't forget some crusty bread to mop up the brothy goodness. Delicious! Thanks so much!

everybody loved it - my little one wanted an additional serving. Though, I have to admit I did make some changes: didn't use a slowcooker and stewed it for 30-40 min (didn't keep time very carefully), used fresh mushrooms, added 1/2 cup tomato puree and fresh instead of dried basil. also, tried it with halibut, celery instead of fennel (as a sort of substitute as I didn't have any kind of fennel left), some fresh thyme, and basil was actually a spoonful of pesto genovese. And, for the second version didn't have shrimps. anyway, it turned out great both times. last thing we would say about it was bland.

This was excellent! I was skeptical about adding orange juice, but did based on other reviews. It was delicious. I did not add olives, green peppers, and bay leaves because we personally don't like them and did not have fennel or fennel seeds on hand. It was still good :-).  After making this once, I could consider adding in more vegetables such as zuchini and carrots, but would be happy just as is. Will definitely be making this again.

So, so good. Made this for a casual get together for 9 (doubled the recipe) and it was a huge hit. We didn't have much left over at all. Added two potatoes small dice and a half can of white beans pureed to get a little fuller broth. Used red and yellow peppers instead of green, no mushrooms or olives - don't judge, just wasn't feeling it. I like a little spicier soup so added red pepper flakes and tabasco but the basic broth is really delicious so start with that. The orange juice added a very fresh taste but indiscernible. I used shrimp, cod, salmon and scallops, all small dice, and the flavors and textures were wonderful together. Made the broth the day before for ease and to let the flavors blend so 'day of prep' was a breeze. Try this - it's just really great. This is a very forgiving base recipe so have some fun with it.

I left out the mushrooms, but did everything else as written.  I was surprised how good it was.  It was very different with the olives and orange juice, but had a good flavor.

I enjoyed this soup a lot!  My husband however, thought it was a little bland.  I will make it again.  I followed the recipe except I did not drain the tomatoes and I added a little bit more olives than required.  I also cooked it on the stove instead of a crock pot.  lightly sautéed the onions and peppers before adding everything else.  I wouldn't skip the fennel like others, I think that is the one spice that really adds dimension to this recipe.

This is an excellent recipe! The broth is extremely delicious. I don't have a slow cooker so I just cooked it on the stove and it turned out great. I also omitted fennel and diced tomatoes and added fresh mushrooms. The combination of orange juice, wine, and tomato is extremely delicious!

Recipe was just "so-so". My husband and I had it two times and it just didn't get the "keeper" status. Had to use red pepper flakes at the table to give it some pizzaz.

The only thing I would change is maybe half the amount of fennel.  Just a hint of the strong fennel flavor makes it great.  Also some fresh black olives with a stronger flavor would make it better than just using regular canned black olives.

very yummy flavor...especially with rolls to soak up the broth. Needs salt though...quite a bit.

I love the combination of flavors in this soup- it's so bright and cheery. I make it on the stove, and it's ready in under an hour. For a little extra heartiness, I add a can of artichoke hearts if I have them on hand.

I was searching for a good recipe that allowed for wiggle room on ingredients - it was clean out the freezer and pantry for soup night.  This was perfect.  We used up some garbanzo beans, frozen snapper, frozen veggies, and dried mushrooms we had.  Substituted anise seed for fennel.  Our liquid ingredients were almost identical to the recipe (except we used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth).  Fantastic.  The soup was amazing.

Very yummy! Loved the fennel seed taste with the combination of ingredients. Added a whole bell pepper, 2 tsp. of dried parsley, and 2 cans of olives. I cooked it on the stove top on medium high heat. The soup served 8 people. I served this soup along with sauteed asparagus, salmon cakes, and a flan dessert. Will cook again, thanks!

This was excellent.  I substituted salmon, rock fish and scallops for the cod and shrimp.  Used fresh cremini mushrooms.  Did not have fennel so I omitted it.

This soup was not bad, but so entirely "so-so" that I will probably never make it again.  On the plus side, it was really quick and easy to make!

The soup came out excellent. One of the things we like a lot is that this soup recipe has so many potential variations.  

 It would be even better next time with more vegetables.  We could envision chard, celery, peas, more bell pepper,  broccoli, carrots.  It could be all or some of these.  

We put in less fish and shrimp because it does not need 2 pounds!  That would be a lot of meat.   We used 1/3 pound of each, making it 2/3 pound total, and it was plenty .    I used a small salmon fillet which someone caught last fell.  By the way, this soup is a good place to use up frozen fish which is a few months old, still fresh, but not at its prime for broiling or BBQ. 

Next time we will also try putting in a handful of partly cooked brown rice.  We could envision potato in tiny cubes or angel hair pasta, too.

somehow this was my least favorite of the recipes I've made from Allrecipe.com. I'm not sure what it is. Could it be the wine I used? I used tilapia instead of cod; I used frozen shrimp, thawed of course. I just didn't like the flavor at all.

The recipe was delicious! I used fresh caught Sand Trout and Whitling I caught in the Gulf of Mexico. I added artichoke hearts and a little sea salt. It is one of my favorite recipes of here so far.

The broth needed more seasoning. It's possible I put too many onions in it. I didn't add clams or mussels, just shrimp and cod. I broiled a slice of sourdough topped with Swiss cheese to put on top of the soup. Ultimately, it was a really good fish soup.

This fish soup is delicious (and I don't like fish)! I made it with homemade bone broth, fresh mushrooms, kale, (no olives-didn't have any), 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar (instead of white wine), some salt, and salmon (instead of the shrimp). I would make it again in a heartbeat. A great way to get the omegas down. Bon appetit!

I have made this a few times and really like it. I do sauté the pepper and onion for a bit in butter  then add the garlic before adding the liquids. I have never planned early enough for the crock pot... so I just stove top it for about three hours or so before adding the seafood.  I also go for fresh fennel, olives, mushrooms and herbs. ( I work for a fresh food market so too easily available)  I threw in muscles recently and that was so pretty! Thank you for sharing, CD

I made some changes and loved it.  I doubled the onions , garlic and green pepper.  I added 4 carrots and 2 sweet potatoes, both cut up small, and some dried parsley.  I did not have mushrooms or black olives, so washed some capers and used them.  I used frozen flounder instead of cod, skipped the shrimp, and served the soup over brown rice cooked with dried onions and turmeric.  Yummy.

Wonderful flavor. I used cat fish since I did not have any cod or shrimp and it still tasted great.

I've made this a number if times. I've used cod, halibut and striped sea bass for the fish. Shrimp or crab. I think it would lend itself to any seafood. Very goos!

I added a little salt and 1-2 tbsp of tamarind soup mix.

This was pretty bland. Texture was nice, but no amount a seasoning I added could really revive this soup.

I'm becoming disenchanted with slow-cooker recipes in general, so maybe this just wasn't for me.
