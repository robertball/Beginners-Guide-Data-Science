This recipe was pretty good, however, it received 3 stars because if you follow the recipe exactly, the rings turn out very BLAND.  We made this for the first time and after the first batch, had to make some immediate modifications.  There was no flavor to the batter, so we added seasoning salt (tons), regular salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper.  Don't be afraid to season the dry mix AND egg mix.  Also, we changed the dry mix to bisquik which made the batter much lighter and fluffier  .  The idea of this recipe is great and the core is great, just needed some modifications.  Thanks!

A light, delicious onion ring!  My husband is gluten intolerant so I substituted gluten-free all purpose flour.  Also, I have found over years of deep frying professionally that if you add salt before you deep fry, the flour has a tendancy to fall off, so I left the salt until after they were fried.  Simple recipe, great taste, light and crisp--thanks.

Amazing - I was raised in the deep south and after following other suggestions, I found these to be better than any restaurant! Even my toughest critics couldn't stop raving about them. This is perhaps the best recipe on AllRecipes.com!

This is a wonderful recipe if you make a few of your own additions.  I did as a some of the other reviews suggested and used Bisquick instead of flour. I also added a bit more salt and pepper, and threw in some Louisiana Cajun Seasoning.  I also sliced the onions pretty thin - I like the more shoestring like onion rings. Oh my gosh, they were so so good. My husband, who doesn't even really like onion rings, ate himself silly. So did my 6 year old daughter. I can tell this will be a much requested recipe.

My husband found these a little bland, but they were great!  I've tried a few of the other onion ring recipes on here, but this was by far the best!  The batter stayed on the rings nicely when frying (the other recipes I tried were not nearly as cooperative! lol) I added a bit of garlic powder and dried parsley to the flour mixure, but next time I will add more.  Maybe some cajun spices or something to give it a bit of a kick!  Will definitely be making these again! :)

This was the recipe I have been searching for! I like the flaky onion rings vs. the cakey kind. The only thing I did differently was to add more spices. I added some season salt, garlic powder, onion powder and some cayenne pepper to give it a little kick. They were gobbled up fast! Even my 16 month old couldn't get enough, and he is a picky one!

I'll give it five stars even though I made some changes.  Great idea double dipping.  I added a little sugar to the flour and used a whole egg rather than just the white.  The onions were covered completely and were actually much prettier than those pictured but they didn't last long enough to take a picture!  Yummmmmy.

My hubby and I loved these onion rings! I did use Bisquick, instead of just flour, and also added Cajun Seasoning.  The only thing I would suggest is.......after making the flour mixture....take half of it and put in a baggy to use later...BECAUSE...after dipping in the liquid, then the flour mixture TWICE.....the flour mixture starts to gum up..so you can throw that and use the other half.....we will be making these again soon!  Very good!

Way to go Grandma! My husband loved this recipe - it's like something you'd get at a restaurant. Next time, I think I'll try replacing the white vinegar with natural apple-cider vinegar for extra tang. I don't have much experience with frying and did these in extra-virgin olive oil for a "healthier" version. I was happily surprised that there was no scorching at all with the lower-burning point oil.

Look no further......this is perfect!  I wouldn't change one single thing.  This method would work for almost any veggie/shrimp etc.  I pre heated the oven to hold them as they cooked (drained on paper towels), till all were done.  The impressive thing about this recipe is:  they stayed crisp and didn't get soggy before all were eaten.

I did what other reviewers suggested and put more seasonings and salt in it. I also cut it into thirds and used apple cider vinegar. About halfway through prep, I ran out of the dry ingredients, but it was pretty simple, so it was pretty easy to throw some more salt and flour in there. I'm on the lookout for my favorite onion ring recipe right now, and this one will definitely be on the top of the list. They came out with a great crunch, great texture and the batter didn't come off while it was being poked at in the oil. Great base recipe to add your touch or flavor to.

The batter was wonderful to work with -- it stayed on during the frying. After reading some reviews, I added almost a tsp. of cayenne to give it a kick. They were amazing and my husband told everyone that I rocked after I served these.  I rated it a four since it needed more seasoning. Thanks for the good recipe.

absolutely the best home made onion rings I have ever made. like a lot of the other reviewers, i seasoned the flour to my tastes, with seasoning salt and mediteranean herbs. very crispy coating with a nice texture to the onion underneath.

Super yummy. I altered the recipe so I could make it with one onion instead of three and it still turned out delicious. Also added a little italian seasoning for a more interesting taste. This was my first time frying onion rings and it was well worth it!

I followed the advice of several different reviewers and added a little sugar, more salt and pepper, and cayenne pepper to the flour mixture. In addition, I chopped up a few small jalapeno peppers and added them into the flour mixture. The red and green pieces of pepper stuck nicely onto the onions and added a neat visual affect as well as that little extra kick when the rings were bit into!

I tasted from the first batch and these were quite bland for our taste so added 1 tablespoon, yes, tablespoon of Cajun seasoning to the flour and it made a world of difference.  Drain on a rack with paper towel beneath for a crispier end result.

Excellent recipe.  My family loves it.  I do season the flour mixture with some season salt and garlic powder as other suggested.  Make sure you are ready to eat as soon as they are cooked.  They get soggy fast.  (They don't taste bad but the hot and crispy is the best)

In a word, spectacular. The rings taste like those that we love at a local restaurant, a pizza place of all places, called Johnny Sortinos (Omaha, NE). This is the recipe I used to break in the new deep fryer, which I received as a Christmas gift. A few of the rings were a bit too hard, which probably had something to do with the temperature of the grease. Do note that the seasoning of the flour is a huge factor on the quality of the flavor.

The closest thing to The Varsity onion rings. Not as greasy, but just as good. I think it's the vinegar and egg whites that give them the right texture. Very good!

These onion rings taste just like the onion rings I love from the Varsity in Atlanta. I now use the same batter for cauliflower and other vegetables too...especially on game day. It sneaks veggies into the empire of junk food for the fellas.

Okay-- not the healthiest food choice here but I have fond memories of all the local seafood restaurants we would enjoy growing up and onion rings would always be part of the meal.  These were excellent. Chef Junior added a pinch of cajun spice to the batter and it added a nice kick. Must be enjoyed piping hot! These got gobbled up quick.

Unfortuantly, I didn't care for this recipe at all. It was very bland and bready, instead of crispy. I'd advise, if someone does like the bready type of onion rings, add some more spices to this to make it less bland. It was my first time making onion rings, and I was pretty excited about it...luckily, while grocery shopping, I bought a onion ring batter mix just in case I didn't find a recipe I liked. Sorry, but I just didn't find this recipe to be very good.

I have used this recipe before and loved it! We get pre-sliced raw onions from a local BBQ place, and we never eat them, so I have started using them to make onion rings (no cutting the onion--what could be better???). I do add a sprinkling of Italian bread crumbs to the batter, but otherwise follow the recipe. Thanks so much for the post! Grandma + Southern = perfection! (: (: (:

These onion rings are very good!  Crispy with just the right amount of light, flakey batter.  I've always used the whole egg when making onion rings but the batter comes out heavier and can tend to get soggy.  Using just the egg whites makes the batter lighter and still crispy.  I have made this recipe using both a deep fryer and a skillet and both turned out equally good.  This is now my go-to recipe for onion rings!

These turned out great! It was the first time I had ever made onion rings and they were easy and everyone loved them. I only made a couple of changes. One change I made was to substitute buttermilk for regular milk, and the other change I made was when I forgot to add salt and pepper to the egg mixture. It still had plenty of salt and pepper taste for us. A tip I would offer is to follow the recipe regarding dipping into each mixture twice. Otherwise the crust is thin and they lack presentation quality. Thank you for sharing!

Excellent recipe for our family and we added a little cajun seasoning and they were a hit.  Similiar taste and texture when compared to the old "Tookies" restaurant in Seabrook, Tx.

Love them.  Don't double batter unless you double up on the onions too or you'll have a big hunk of breading and no onion flavor.

I liked these, but my boyfriend said they were just ok. We both agreed they could use some more flavor. Next time, I'll add more salt and pepper, and maybe some garlic powder and cayenne. I also had to use more than 2 cups of flour to coat all the onion rings.

Ilove onions but have never been a fan of onion rings. I had a ton of sliced onions left over from a picnick so decided to try this. They were great. My first batch were not as crispie as i would have liked( don't usually deep fry) so i lowered oil temp. and  let 2nd batch cook a little longer. They came out much better. Thank you and because i ate so many i am going on a nice long walk

Wonderful!!  These were the perfect onion rings.  The only changes I made was to add about a teaspoon of seasoned salt to the dry mixture and about 1/2 t to the wet.  I used a blended peanut/safflower oil and they were light and flavorful.  Definite keeper!

We love these onion rings.  Although I would double the flour and egg mixtures.  The recipe didn't make nearly enough to cover 3 large onions!  Thanks for the great recipe.

These were very good. Light and crispy. I cut the rings thin rather than thick. The batter was crispy and light, not a heavy thick breading. What a mess this made, but was very good and I only needed 1 large Texas Sweet onion for 3 of us. Now a keeper in my recipe file, thanks for sharing this!

My first attempt at onion rings--everyone raved.  I did have some difficulty in keeping the batter from clumping to my hands though.   Thanks for the recipe.

Hello, This is the 3rd onion ring recipe I've tried, this is the best! It is easy to make; double dipping will make the coating quite a bit thicker. I tried both and like single dipping; they are still totally coated but really crispy! Delicious!

Yummy! My first try at onion rings...I rarely fry any thing . These came out so nice, light and crispy, not greasy or spongey at all....lovely! I ran out of time doing them in batches so the last rings didn't get double-dipped...it was obvious, don't skip the double-dip =)!

These are soooo good...couldn't be better.  I did most of them in a single-dip instead of double-dip in the batter & flour and they were just as good.  Also, I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar and instead of white flour, I used half brown rice flour and half spelt flour.  I think next time, I'll use a smaller container for the flour, so it's easier to cover the rings w/ flour without handling them so much.  Overall, excellent recipe!  I highly recommend it!!

I was very pleased with this recipe. I thinly sliced my onion rings and used this recipe as my coating . It was so light and crisy. I will be using this recipe again. I added some cajun seasoning for spice.

The perfect onion ring. My husband called them "restaurant quality." For a super-light crust only pass them through the egg and flour mixtures once. Really good and very crispy either way.

This is the best onion ring recipe I've ever made! It's not thick beer batter but super crispy. I did add some season salt and I used sweet vidallia onions. So good!

instead of using salt & pepper with the flour mix, i used seasoning salt & pepper which was waaaaay better.. i ran out of canola oil so i used olive oil again which i won't do again, it wasn't bad but it wasn't the same.. they tasted just like the ones from the Varsity.

These were divine! Due to barley allergy, I used a blend of cornmeal and Arrowhead Mills white flour for the dry mix. I also added a packet of Splenda to the egg mix-this did not make it sweet, but added to the flavor. I sliced the onions thin, which made them light and crispy. I added some Old Bay to the dry mix, as well as a touch of basil. On the recommendation of another reviewer, I salted the rings after, instead of adding the salt to the mix. These onion rings are delicate and delicious and will be enjoyed frquently around here!

Easier than my other onion ring favorite recipe so this one wins, and the flavor is better.

This was the first onion ring recipe I have ever tried and they were sooo good. Light, crispy, and delicious! The only negative thing about this recipe is that mine came out very salty the first time, so I prepared the batter the same on my second try then I used sweet vidalia onions. The sweet onions tasted even better! Very easy too!

Great!  I added seasoning salt & garlic powder to the dry mix.  I also didn't have enough of the flour mixture, you could probably double it.  My husband (an onion ring fan) said they might have been the best onion rings he'd ever had.  A bit messy to make (especially towards the end when the flour is getting clumpy) but totally worth it.

This batter was so great! It was easy and really quick. Plus you can add any spice you want to the dry ingredients, like garlic or onion powder. I will use this all the time!

Absolutely wonderful recipe.  Creates a great tasting old fashioned onion ring, and it is super quick too!  You can have great onion rings without going to the fair and paying a small fortune.

Delicious!  These are wonderfully light and delicate.  For once, I didn't feel like I was eating mostly batter--it really lets the taste of the onions shine through.  My husband and son loved them--I will be making this recipe again and again!
