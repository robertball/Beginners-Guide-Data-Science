Excellent salad. Bacon and fruit together, ahhh. I didn't have any grapes, and added sliced dates and almonds. I made my own honey-mustard dressing with plain yogurt, dijon, honey, and salt & pepper. Turned out really good - also very pretty. :) Thanks for the recipe.

My family LOVED this recipe.  So fresh & easy...with the perfect mix of sweet, salty & crunchy - plus we added red onion, almonds & fresh flaky parmesean which rounded out the existing flavors.  Can hardly wait to have it again,thank you for sharing! :)

Pretty good.  I added cashews and peanuts, which added a nice crunch.  Not mind-blowing or anything, but a pleasant change of pace.
