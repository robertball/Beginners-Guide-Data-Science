When I make this, I omit the sour cream and mix in chopped onion and celery-delicious!

What I did was instead of pouring it over the ball was to make it into a ball then to make a well in the middle and pour the cocktail sauce into the middle... by the end of the night it was totally gone... thanks

Sorry, but this just didn't quite make it.
cream cheese and sour cream overpowered the expensive crab meat
it needed less of them and more of something else...like celery and onion.

This recipe turned out terribly. That much sour cream prevents the ball from taking form, and the coctail sauce overpowered any taste of crab. The crab should be lump to make it form a little more easily. Because I couldn't form it into a ball I made it a "spread" in a pan instead--and it still didn't taste good.

This recipe is, to be polite, lacking. DO NOT use sour cream, it ruins the entire project. Do double the crab, add the same quantity of tiny shrimp (canned) and make your own cocktail sauce to taste with horseraddish, worcestershire, lemon and ketchup. Add onion powder to taste, add paprika for color. Chill in saran wrap in the freezer until it holds shape, douse with cocktail sauce and serve with your favorite cracker. Great additions are diced onion and garlic. Truly a holiday treat!

My party guests loved this dip.  Like the other reviewers I did not use the Sour Cream and added more crab.

I thought it was a good basic dip. I didnt use cocktail sauce, I don't like it and I cut down the sour cream, and used plain greek yogurt in it' place because that what I had on hand, added the garlic and some Old Bay. I used it as a veggie dip. Very delish thanks!I would make this again as stated in recipe, I just had some crab in the freezer and was looking through recipes.
