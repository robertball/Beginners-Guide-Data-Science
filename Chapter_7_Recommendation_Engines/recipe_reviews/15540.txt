Good basics but I used 1 each green red and yellow pepper. I added a small can of stewed tomatoes after the peppers and onion sauteed and then tossed the cooked pasta into the same pan to let it absorb the olive oil flavor a bit. Tasted great and heated up well in the microwave the next day. Will make again.

This dish could use more flavor. I added red chili flakes and lots of salt and pepper and I used one each of red yellow and orange bell peppers. I found the pasta itself to be a bit dry (I used whole wheat) so I think next time I'll add some tomatoes or spaghetti sauce.

This a tasty simple pasta dish if you love peppers and onions like we do! I have made this several times and I always add some dried Italian seasoning salt and pepper. Crushed red pepper flakes is great in this too if you prefer some spiciness. I do add more olive oil but that's just personal preference. We love this topped with grated parmesan cheese sometimes I toss some in the vegetable mix as well. Thanks for sharing we really enjoy this:)

This was really good! The second time I made it I added some left over grilled chicken and fresh zucchini. I also added a bit more garlic and used less peppers. One of the best pastas I've ever made and the family loved it! Gotta have the grated parmesan on top though.

Very good & easy. For the noodles I stirred in some garlic dressing then added the sweet peppers. Was a hit! Ooop...I forgot to add some parmesan cheese on top as suggested by one reader.

I thought this was just perfect but Hubs thought it "needed something" (his taste buds must have been shot tonight). It was the perfect accompaniment to "Pork Marsala " also from this site. Normally I would have served the meat with just some pasta aglio e olio but this time I wanted something with a little more pizazz a little more colorful. I didn't measure precisely just cut chopped and added to taste tossing all at the end. Loved it.

I made mine with 1 yellow red and orange pepper and 2 green peppers. I also added cayenne pepper garlic salt italian seasoning crushed red pepper and salt. At the very end it seemed really dry so i added some chicken stock. It turned out very good after that and it had some kick to it!

This was such a great recipe! Instead of penne I used fettucine cuz I didn't have any penne on hand. I did add follow other's suggestions though. I added some italian seasoning and used garlic powder cuz I dind't have any garlic cloves. Also I added some stewed tomatoes to the peppers and added the pasta to let it absorb the flavors. I added marinated shrimps (recipe on allrecipes) after. It was a hit! My bf went for seconds and my mom requested it for Thanksgiving!

This is so good. I have made this twice now and I will be making it again and again. I used homemade whole wheat pasta and a can of diced tomatoes. The left overs are fantastic. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Followed recipe except used tri-color rigatoni and cut back to 2 yellow and 2 red pepper for rave reviews by all 7 in family. On the side added saut√©ed mushrooms and black olives since everyone didn't want these but these would be great in the pepper mix.

This dish was alright but lacked flavour. I took other reviewers' suggestions and added diced tomatoes Italian sausage and red pepper flakes. I still didn't have any wow factor.

I made this for dinner tonight. Didn't have fresh garlic. So I used McCormick California Style Garlic Salt with Parsley. I also oly had a half of a red pepper so I added orange peppers with the yellow & little bit of red. Before serving to my family I sprinkled fresh grated Parmesan cheese on the individual plates. I love how the cheese melted on top of the penne noodles.
