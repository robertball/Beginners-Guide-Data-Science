Brought this to an office holiday party and it was a BIG hit!  I liked that I could make it the night before and not worry about finding a way for it to arrive to the party "warm."

I used crawfish that had been cooked and cleaned as part of the packaging process, and that worked GREAT - made it even easier to make!

I thought it could use a touch more hot sauce, but that is more of a "taste" thing...

YUM!  This turned out great.  I suppose you could chop or shred the tails for a less lumpy consistency, but I personally LOVE a big chunk of crawdaddy on my cracker.  This is a keeper...Thanks for sharing!

I cut the recipe in half & added a lot more hot sauce & worcestershire. Only I used Louisiana Hot Sauce which is one of the mildest. I managed to get most of the crawfosh out whole (leftovers from a crawfish boil) so i gave them a rough chop & only sauteed them long enough to heat them a bit & get them well-buttered. The dip  was very well received but I don't know that I'll make it again using crawfish. I think I would prefer it w/ shrimp although that may be due to the fact that I had to shuck all the crawdads. LOL I jsut served it w/ saltines...thansk for the recipe KSharp01!

This was well-received at a recent party.  As others have mentioned, you need a lot more hot sauce than the recipe states.  I bet I put in close to 1/4 cup.  I also mixed in some Old Bay and sprinkled with a little cayenne pepper for color and a little extra heat.

We are in the Midwest and crawfish isn't standard fare around here, but I made this for a neighborhood party . I added quite a bit of lemon juice and garlic powder since it seemed to need "something" - maybe my store-bought frozen tails weren't the best quality, too, but nobody said it was good so I won't try that again.

I use shrimp whenever crawfish are out of season, and it is just as good. However, I use WAY more hot sauce than is called for (closer to 3-4 T). I figure if you're going to make a cajun dip it had better be a little spicy!

I made this dip for a group of ladies from my social club and they loved it! I added a few ingredients  and it turned out great. I added a fresno pepper but only included a few of the seeds when I saut√©ed with the green onions. I also added garlic and squeezed some fresh lemon on the crayfish before cooking. I also added a teaspoon of crab boil seasoning.

I liked the recipe, but wasn't able to let it sit overnight and meld the flavors unfortunately, so I'll have to make it again.
 
I added a quarter 1/4 teaspoon cayenne and I only had one lb. of crawfish so I substituted Shrimp for the other lb. and it worked out well.  it was very flavorful but could have used a little more zip.  It was probably my interupation that was faulty plus I was in a bid hurry.  I think I would add one to two minced garlic cloves in the next time.  Try it, simple but very good recipe.

I use a pound of crawfish tails and about a half a pound of chopped shrimp. And I substitute Worcestershire sauce with A-1 because my husband is allergic.

FANTASTIC dip!  I followed the recipe as stated, but changed the hot pepper sauce (I used Franks) to 1 tsp, since we like a little heat!  I served it with Triscuits.

I made this for a poker game, that had a New Orleans theme.  I bought the crawfish from the ONLY fresh(ish) seafood store in town.  They sold the Crawfish tails in a one pound bag, frozen, for $14.99.....SO this made for a VERY expensive dip.....but it was worth it :)  I would most definitely recommend this dip to someone who could get a great deal on Crawfish.  Everyone loved it and kept coming back for more.

Very good! It was a little expensive to make, as the crawfish tails can be hard to find around here. All in all worth it though.

Great! Had to follow wisdom others and either cut crawfish in half or double the rest.
