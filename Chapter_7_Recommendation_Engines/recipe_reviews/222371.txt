Very good.  We added about 1/4 c finely shredded hard cheese.  I would also suggest dusting your hands with flour to keep them from sticking to you.  The flavor was very nice, make sure to cook them slow but not too slow because they will burn.

This is the real deal!  This is the same recipe I have been cooking for years.  I found it in my grandmother's Swedish-English cookbook decades ago.  I had sworn myself to secrecy about divluging it but it really is too good not to share!  I do chill the meat mixture for a couple of hours before rolling them into balls.  A melon ball scoop works wonders for portioning.  My family of four enjoys these as a main course, so I always double the original recipe.  Have patience - making these is a true labor of love!

AKA “fly off the table” Swedish Meatballs
I made a double recipe of these meatballs as is.  That being said, they can be changed slightly at no taste cost if you are on a ketogenic diet: substitute bread crumbs for flax meal, half-and-half for heavy whipping cream and a pinch of stevia for the sugar.  Now back to the actual recipe.  I made these little puppies for New Year’s Eve.  My mother told me: “Wow, I haven’t had any of these in so long!  I used to make these all the time.”  Outcome?  My sister-in-law did not even get to eat one!  These morsels just disappeared in less than ten minutes.  I am not kidding.  I served these with habanero raspberry jam, a traditional tzatziki, and a sour cream and garlic dip.  A little tip:  The mixture is a little sticky so make sure to have a nice little bowl of water to dip your fingers from time to time.
Thank you Linda T, you made my dish the talk of the party!

Very good and they are just about always served this way in Sweden, but a true Swedish meatball would be made with Moose meat. And the salt can be cut back especially if using the pork.

Move over IKEA, I don't need your meatballs anymore. I made these using gluten free bread crumbs. At first, the mixture is really wet, don't panic. Keep mixing and let it rest a minute or two. It will firm up.  I have made four batches so far and love the outcome;  tender to the tooth but robust enough to not fall apart at the touch of a fork or tongs when handling. I use half the salt written. These freeze well too. I served them with blueberry habanero jam and Sriracha/sour cream. All delicious! Thank you for the recipe.

Very similar to mine, except I use less salt, more white pepper, soak bread instead of bread crumbs. Those of you who didn’t use Pork, do so next time -not authentic without it! (My mother added veal, too, but I don’t). 
And if you are adding Worcestershire, cheese or Italian spices, etc, they are definitely no longer Swedish! And no, we never added allspice, though I know some recipes call for it. Must be regional, I guess.

lovely , moist, & flavorful meatballs but
where's the Allspice ? I always thought Allspice was the spice ingredient needed to make this authentically Swedish .

I loved these.  They were so easy to make and just with regular things from the cabinet.  I only used beef for that was all I had.  I doubled the recipe and it took two and a half iron skillets.  Served them over angel hair pasta with a made-up sauce of mushroom soup, chicken broth, tamari, lemon juice and water, garnished with baby tomato halfs.  Delicious!    A single recipe would probably have been sufficient for the three of in the house as they're rich and filling.

Simple and great tasting recipe. People saying it was too salty probably used salted butter and cooked it in salted butter when browning. I did (lol) made it a bit salty so I would cut salt in half if using salted butter everywhere else. I freeze extras to add to pasta sauces another time.

Very good. Followed recipe exactly, but needed more breadcrumbs. I baked the meatballs in a 350 degree oven for 25 minutes instead of on the stove as I don't have a stove top pan big enough to hold 48 meatballs ;-) Next time I will use less salt.

Oh, man!  We loved these!  I followed the recipe using Progresso's Italian bread crumbs and only half the salt.  I didn't add the sugar, either, nor did I serve these with the typical lingonberry jam.  These are deliciously tender and,  as Buckwheat Queen said in her review, sturdy.  I did serve these with a little sour cream with sriracha mixed in, and that was perfect for us.  I have some left over for later this week, and I'll be very grateful for that!  My friends will be seeing these in their future!  Thanks, Linda!

I make it as the recipe dictates but with only half the salt. I have 3 kids aged 6 & under, who are fussy eaters & at any given meal only two will actually like what I put on the table. I make double portions, as it one of the few meals that EVERYONE in the family will eat. I have tried buying store bought but that gets rejected & I'm back to this "labor of love". A good substitute to lingonberry sauce (hard to find) is strawberry jam mixed with a little white vinegar & a pinch of salt

It's good as is, but IMO, not quite the family Swedish Meatballs I remember, which had considerably more spice - especially Nutmeg. Perhaps a pinch or two of Allspice too. I'll make it again but with those additions.

These small meatballs were OK, but definitely on the salty side. I say to cut the salt in half. Conversely, they were not sufficiently seasoned, as pepper is the only flavoring. Considering the large number of items of the ingredients list I expected a better final product and cooking result. The author also failed to mention to cook these meatballs on simmer or low heat only.
 I will stick with my 3 ingredient Hidden Valley Ranch recipe and simply add a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and half a package of Lipton onion soup or whatever similar product that I find in my cupboard (or increase it to full package if you like it more spicy.)

A simple easy recipe. Make extra and freeze.  Even found Lingonberry  jam and really like it paired with the meatballs.  Only change was I cut the salt in about half.  Easy to add extra if you wish.    Thanks for a great recipe!  Used this for samples at a farmers market event.

Very, very good. Even my mother, who does not like meatballs, loved these.

I did use Italian season bread crumbs because that's all I had and added onion and garlic granules and a pinch of nutmeg. I also used about a pound and a half of ground/minced beef and ended up needing a bit more bread crumbs but it was also humid (I live in Texas and it was Spring). All-in-all, "Make Again."

Between three people, we had leftovers and I swear they taste even better the next day. You could even let the meat rest in the fridge to let the spices blend.

I suggest trying with lingonberry jam/sauce from Ikea (maybe even cloudberry?) and/or sour cream mix. The sour cream mix I made, I just used the last of some sour cream, added a health amount of dill, dash of salt, onion and garlic granules, and a small splash of lemon juice. Mix and try not to let the dog lick it when taking a picture. Silly girl.

I will absolutely be making this again.

Tack så mycket for such a great recipe.

Delicious, tender and moist, these Swedish Meatballs were a hit.  My husband called it the perfect comfort food.  I made the recipe exactly as written, then made a sauce with flour, beef broth, and a little sour cream with the pan drippings.

I made these ahead for Christmas day, and they are very good.  I hope they hold up when serving them as they don't seem to be very firm, but they taste good.  I used considerably less salt based on the reviews I read, and I think they taste fine.  I would like a gravy or sauce to serve them in, so I may look around for a recipe to make for them.  Any suggestions for a sauce or gravy?

ok recipe.... I rolled them in flour.... browned them, and then covered them with 1/2 and1/2...bake at 275.....check in 45 minutes.... recover with cream and bake again... this process can take 2-3 hours...... drop in some BV  beefer upper.... remove balls and stir up the sauce, and serve them with mashed potatoes, using the sauce as gravy.......kids and old folks will swoon, and eat them all

These were soooo good. They didn’t even last that long. It was gobbled up in minutes!!! They taste just like ikea meatballs but better because they’re homemade! Thanks for sharing the recipe! Will make again!

I doubled the recipe (I cook for the week for my mom and I. ) I used Turkey instead of beef with the ground pork. I also used Stevia instead of sugar. The rest was the same. Oh, I put them in muffin tins in the oven at 425°f instead of stovetop frying. The result was super yummy! Less work too!

I did not change a thing since I'm new to the out of the box cooking world. We had family over that night and I ended up having to make another batch because they were floored by the taste. It was amazing and yes I will certainly make it again and again. Thank you for sharing your mother's recipe. It is a keeper.

Family loved this recipe! I did halve the salt. And baked them in the oven on a parchment lined sheet pan. @400 for about 20 minutes, turning them halfway through. Time is dependent on size. I used a small cookie scoop. ??

Way too salty. I cut the salt to 1/2 tsp, and they were plenty salty. I also thought there was too much liquid for the volume of bread crumbs. I cut it to 1/2 cup total, and it was enough. Add about 1/4 tsp allspice for that authentic Swedish Meatball flavor.

I'm being generous by giving this recipe 3 *s.  I should have listened to my inner voice the first time, which told me to add a couple of finely minced garlic cloves when sautéing the onions.  Also, several sprigs of minced flat leaf Italian parsley would add more flavor, as would a sprinkle of nutmeg.  I made them once again (my way) and they were delicious.

These meatballs reminded me of the ones my grandma used to make. My husband and I loved them! I will make them again and was so glad to find ones without a creamy sauce on them!! 
Thanks!  
From one Swede to another!

I made this dish as is, except I used all ground beef, like many others. I found it kind of bland, 
and for the amount of work meatballs are, I expected a little more "bang" for my effort. They were okay, but I won't make them again.

I did it by the recipe and it worked out quite well. Besides being a bit on the salty side (I recommend having cranberry sauce to provide a great contrast), the meatballs tasted the way Swedish meatballs should. Delish!

Made this recipe for our Family Christmas gathering this year and followed it exactly.  The meatballs were all gone in under 15 minutes and people kept asking me for more.  Definitely will make these again!

Thank you for the recipe!
