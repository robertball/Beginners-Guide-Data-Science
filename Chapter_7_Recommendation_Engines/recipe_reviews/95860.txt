delicious, but with made some adjustments to this recipe:  i doubled the amount of curry powder and apple, and increased the spinach, carrot, and onion.  I did not add the cooked lentils when i added the pumpkin etc as i think this would make it too mushy.  instead, i added it with the apple and spinach step.

Fantastic, I think if I made it exactly per instructions it would be *****+! I had lots of fresh pumpkin and was able to make this from mostly what I had in my cabinets and fridge--didn't have some of the ingredients but substituted courgette for the carrot, cinnamon for the cloves, and I didn't have curry powder (I upped the cumin). 
I cut down on the time needed by baking the pumpkin, pre-cooking the potatoes, using tinned lentils, using canned tomatoes instead of fresh, and frozen, thawed and drained spinach.
Next time I'll be sure to have all of the correct ingredients.  This is great with brown rice. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Fantastic!This coming from a person who cooks lentils every day without fail! I had no idea  one cud put all this in lentils:)) and it wud taste so good! And yes, I saute'd the onions, garlic and tomatoes in the pressure cooker, added the rest of the stuff (less water) and two whistles! I was done in 20 minutes:)

I like the idea of this, but it was way too much lentil in proportion to the rest of the ingredients. As a result, it was very bland and not at all pumpkiny. After tasting it, I added more spices (doubling them) and a bit of coconut milk, and still it was disappointing. I’d suggest using, at most, half the amount of lentils—maybe even less—and increasing the pumpkin.

This was a departure from my usual lentils, for me. I liked it a lot! My kids loved it too! I subbed spinach with kale, and a butternut squash for the pumpkin because that's what I had on hand. It will definitely get made again on our house. It is a great recipe to fiddle with for your own needs(like what's in the fridge), but also good the way it's written. The only major change I made was to add the cooked lentils in with the kale and apple, because I like my lentils to have a good texture still, but a very good recipe. Thank you!

I used sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin - and it worked perfectly.  The flavors worked very well together.  I wish I had read the reviews ahead of time and used more turmeric in the lentils - because they were a bit bland.  But adding a bit of salt helped.  Oh, and this dish just got better and better after a few days in the refrigerator!

I used butternut squash instead of pumpkin - but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  It was a very thick chunky stew and tasted good.  The apple chunks were really great - I think next time I'll add some more apples.  Maybe replace some potatoes with apples?  Also I think a splash of cream or coconut milk would really help this soup go from good to great.

Nice flavor, great use/mix of ingredients, and I love the slight sweetness of the apples.  I made this last night following the advice of others: doubled the spices, added an extra apple, and used 1/2c of brown/red lentils instead of 1c.  I used butternut squash instead of pumpkin as suggested by the author, which came out great.  The only problem was the lentils turned to mush and the consistency was more like dhal.  Next time I will cook the lentils for only 30 min (set aside uncovered), and then add the cooked lentils to the pot last, after the potatoes are done.  So essentially just combine the lentils with all the other ingredients just before serving.  I served this with basmati rice.

Delicious!  It did take quite a bit longer to prepare the dish than I expected, but I work slowly.  It was well worth the time in the end and the left-overs are great, too.

The recipe is a bit off.  Followed posted suggestions and reduced the lentils by half, doubled the spices and added another apple.  It still wasn't quite right -- maybe add golden raisins?!

Bland, bland, bland. I love all the vegetables and lentils that went into this but after it was all done, everything tasted the same - like murkey bean water with a hint of curry. 
Very disappointing.

Mine came out a little bit bland, but I take full responsibility for that: I may not have estimated the lentil-to-spice ratio correctly, as I was using a full bag of red lentils instead of the recommended amounts of red and brown.  Also, you may not need two kinds of lentils in there, but if you are picking between them, go with the brown.  Red lentils against the pumpkin and tomato make this the most orange food ever with the added randomness of spinach and green apples.  People ate it, but it was the most "left-over" dish I made for this dinner.

I made the recipe as written, and it was really great. It is very satisfying and flavorful. After making it, however, I did decide a little butter to make the sauce a little richer (about 3-4 Tb to the whole pot) and about 1/2 tsp cinnamon, which just suites my taste. But overall, a really great recipe.

OUTSTANDING! My fiance found this recipe accidentally, and decided it would make a perfect October treat. It can be hard to find interesting, flavorful and filling vegetarian dishes, and this one absolutely rose to the occassion! We both love cloves and curry, so we added a bit more to taste; we put in an extra apple and next time we may try the recipe with other winter squash - but otherwise no changes!

These ingredients play well together, but the missing "aha" ingredient that people are needing is ginger. Use fresh grated ginger and some dry ginger to give much more sparkle to this. If you are so inclined to take the extra time and energy, grind your cumin seeds, cloves, and black pepper together yourself in a coffee grinder or mortar and pestle. If you have coriander seeds, grind those fresh too, as they add much to the curry flavor. Curry powders are not created equally and even after a couple months of being open, they have lost a lot of their strength and WOW factor for cooking.  This is an excellent mixture to stuff whole squashes with for holiday meal presentations, it just needs a little experimentation and you will enjoy the results. If you add currants, a little chopped fresh cilantro and a sprinkle of cashews over the top, it becomes almost Middle Eastern in character.

I really wanted to love this recipe.  It has great bones, but it seems like it is missing an important spice...I just can't figure out which one.  I didn't have potatoes (used cauliflower) or pumpkin (used butternut squash), but followed the rest of the recipe exactly...until I tasted it.  It was incredibly bland...so I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the spices...better, but still not great.  I also added a can of coconut milk, and a can of chunk pineapple with the juice.  Again, better...but still missing something.

This was good...it just made a ton of food. As a single person, that's not usually my goal, but I could see it being a good recipe for a get-together. It was hard to evenly cook all the ingredients in the pot. If I make it again, I may skip some.

Excellent!  I followed other reviewers' recommendations and halved the lentils (used only brown as that's all I had), and also didn't cook them beforehand.  I just added the uncooked lentils and water with the other vegetables and everything cooked perfectly with a lot less hassle.

We really liked this recipe. I used 3 apples which was a great idea, only 1 kind of lentil & added vegetable bullion while cooking, & substituted cinnamon for cloves. I would recommend adding the tomatoes towards the end since they turned into mush. I used baby carrots & more pumpkin. I served this over brown rice but I may eat the leftovers plain. It turned out to be more like a hearty stew. Overall, a great recipe with lots of leftovers, time consuming, but very healthy meal!

This looked nice served up, and had some great ingredients.. but I agree with the many other reviewers who said it was bland and missing something. I added plenty of extra spices, and you could taste them, but still bland. Added more salt and still tasted like it was missing something vital. I like the ideas of adding coconut milk or raisins. My 7 year old wouldn't eat it, but the other kids did. No one really raved about it though.

A good recipe.  I liked the way the flavors of the curry, squash, and apples worked together.  I may reduce the amount of lentils if I make it in the future.

This was delicious! I had to make a few changes to speed up the process and account for missing pumpkin. Instead, I used two sweet potatoes and it turned out great.   I used 1 1/2 c. rd lentils and no brown as they cook faster (about 10 minutes).  At the same time, I steamed the yams, potatoes and carrots to make them soft as I cooked the lentils in a separate pot.   Taking the advice of other reviewers, I doubled the garlic and curry and added a few shakes of dried red peppers. The spices came out just right.  Great served over Bulgar or couscous.

This dish was really enjoyable and a great veggie option for dinner.  It was super filling and comforting for a cold winter night.  Per the recommendations of others, I doubled the spices and substituted butternut squash for the pumpkin.  In addition, although I made all the lentils, I didn't add them all to the final dish (I would recommend no more than 1.5 c total), and I added them at the end with the apples/spinach.  I also added an extra apple, but wouldn't do this in the future unless i chopped it really small (the bigger chunks were a little offputting in their sweetness).  I would also consider substituting the apple out for a few golden raisins.   Finally, I used cherry tomotoes instead of the whole because i had them on hand.  I'll make this again for sure.  It was a healthy and flavorful dish.

This CAN be a 4 star recipe...with some tweaking.  1) If you don't want mushy lentils, don't cook them first.  They can be started at the same time as the other pot. Then add them with the spinach.  2)Use 2 apples or you won't notice they're in there.  3) Rather bland SO...this is what I found...add way more salt, add 1.5+ tsp of red pepper flakes, and the juice of 2-3 limes.  4) Top with roasted sunflower seeds - give it a nice added texture.

I don't even like lentils and I loved this.  The entire family did.  Anyone who calls it bland didn't make it properly or something.  I suppose there are people out there who wouldn't like this but I don't know who they are.  Even my dedicated carnivore Dad had three servings!

I made this for my roommate for her birthday and it was definitely a hit.  I didn't have any cloves and I think that would have made the flavor a little better.  Also it wasn't quite as spicy as I normally prefer my curries to be so next time I'll add a bit more in terms of spices - perhaps cayanne?  Overall was a tasty and filling, good-for-you recipe!

My son is a vegetarian and I like to omit meat from my diet once or twice a week. I have lost 25 pounds by doing nothing else and walking. It was full of interesting flavor and full of great vitamins. Who can ask more of food??

I really liked it, but no one else in my family did. I added cumin, cinnamon, and increased the turmeric to the water when cooking the lentils because the other ratings said it was bland. It was still a little bland, but I liked it! Decreased lentils by 1/2 cup also and thought it was good.

It was healthful, but rather flavourless considering all the ingredients and spices in it. It wasn't disgusting, but it was lacking. We ended up adding a bit of harrissa to each serving to give it a little kick! This recipe also took quite a long time, but I think that was because there were too many useless steps. I followed the recipe exactly, but in the end I could have used one pot and just added things at different times to get the same results I'm sure. I likely won't bother with this recipe again. My husband love my other lentil dishes, so this recipe will be left out of my recipe box!

I really like this recipes.  I made adjustments just so I could work with what I had on hand such as using a delicata squash instead of pumpkin, but can't wait to try it with the pumpkin.  I think I also put extra apples into it.  Loved the apples in this recipe!

This is delicious and filling and perfect for the turn in the weather! I failed to recognize I was out of carrots so those were missing and I decided to use a Kabocha because it was right there in the produce area looking good. Otherwise, I fudged some of the proportions due to making a larger batch and simple preferences, but kept it pretty close. Very tasty dish will be repeated with great joy and frequency!

I bought a sugar pumpkin at the store today and could not wait to use it in something! I came across your soup recipe, and I started to cook it before checking that I had all of the ingredients... I was amazed at how well it turned out anyways!! I had no lentils on hand (which is rare!), so I used a combination of small red beans and also great northern beans. I also didn't have any stock, and instead of the tomatoes and broth, I used a large can of tomato puree. I also completely forgot to add the spinach, but it was still delish!

This was great!  I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions and cooked only 1 cup of lentils with the veggies (only used 5 cups of veggie broth) and served over quinoa.

I loved this and got great feedback from my guests.  I did add a lot more cumin about 2T more. Beware this makes a huge amount of food, it overflowed my pan.

I really liked this! It had a bite to it which I really liked. Next time I might cook the ingredients closer to the way the recipe said. I tried to save time& didn't! Lol! The only sub I had to make is to use canned spinach.

This is delicious and healthy! We used butternut squash and didn't put in the apple because we didn't have any. Tasted good and my 2, 4, and 6 year old all had seconds! Awesome recipe!

Great concept recipe, though I agree with previous reviewers that there was too much lentils. 1 1/2 cups total would be much better. Otherwise, really tasty and wonderfully unexpected.
