This is the closest recipe I could find to the one I lost but had made for years. The only difference I can remember is that I never added hot sauce, used canned mushrooms instead of fresh, beef stock or broth instead of consume and usually used top round cut into strips, which of course had to be simmered much longer.  Otherwise, too close to quibble about and delicious.  Thanks for posting.

Sooooo good!  I had to improvise with beef stock instead of Consommé and a squirt of Dijon mustard instead of worshestershire.  It came out perfectly, served it over egg noodles and I will definitely be making this again!

Nice easy recipe for stroganoff. I used stew meat and left out ketchup and hot sauce just because. The finished product was great

I'm super happy right now. My MIL made stroganoff for my husband for years, but she used ground beef and those individually pre-packaged stroganoff seasonings from the store. No onions, seasonings, literally nothing else except ground beef, sour cream and that dang packet.  I hated it. Husband wanted stroganoff all the time and asks me to make it, but I wanted to try something this time- like what my grandma used to make. He had never tried any other kind of stroganoff except his mom's. When I found this recipe, made it, and he tried it, he couldn't believe how good it was and requests THIS all the time now. The great thing is that I LOVE this too and I have no problem making this once a week! Thank you for saving me! 
**If he didn't like it, I would've continued to make it the other way-I'm just so glad he likes this one because he didn't know how I felt about the one his mom made because I didn't want to insult her. THANKS AGAIN!

Such an easy recipe for my first stroganoff! I used beef stock and a roux instead of beef consommé, and it turned out great!

Made this recipe for a crowd at our church so I may have adjusted the amounts, but this was quite the hit! It is definitely a keeper. I used a whole sirloin tip which turned out great! A good recipe for entertaining and impressing your guests.

I've made this several times with no changes to the recipe - a great dish!  I've even doubled it up to ensure lots of leftovers.  We always serve over rice.

I didn't add mushrooms as I am not a big fan. The rest I followed the recipe. I loved it. Not a big fan of beef stroganoff and I loved this recipe. I will definitely be making this again.

Very tasty!  I made a few changes though.  I used beef stock, about 2 cups all together, instead if the consomme and tomato paste rather than ketchup.  I also used Smart Balance as a butter substitue.

Leftover bacon wrapped filet mignon(can you believe such a thing?), I skipped the ketchup and tabascoe, sub red wine and sub greek plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  But awesome!  we paired with a side of sauteed carrots and leeks(also here on allrecipes).  Great combo!  Thanks for sharing:0)

This is a solid recipe, but doesn't really have that "wow" factor that makes it stand out from others.  My husband swore he could taste the ketchup in it and if I made this recipe again I would most likely cut back or sub something else for it.
