Turned out great.. our plums were mushy and sweet and needed to be used.  The first time I made this, I left the skins on, which gives the mousse a lovely mauve colour, however, they needed to be strained out and that was a lot of work.  So, seeing that they are so soft, I was able to remove the skins before cooking.  To get the colour, I poured a half cup of hot water over the skins/pits and drained it off  and after sitting for a half hour.  I used this to dissolve the gelatin.  
My husband is crazy about this dessert.  I'm glad for a way to use up so many plums at one time!

Rather than cooking on the stove, I cooked the plums on high for 3 minutes in the microwave.  To lighten a bit, I used Splenda granulated and fat-free evaporated milk.  It took about an hour for the plum mixture to start to thicken (not 30 minutes).  I whipped the milk for about 5 minutes, and it never really thickened.  Little confused that it says to "gently spoon the whipped milk into the plum mixture" and then the next step is to beat again with an electric mixer??  I just dumped the plum mixture into the whipped milk, and then beat it.  Not to worry, really, because it all came out good in the end.  In the future, I most likely will chop the plums rather than slice (beating the slices was sort of strange), but we liked this dessert.  For anybody following Weight Watchers Plus, the subs I made take this to a 2 point dessert.  And it's a nice one.  Thanks, Kellie C, for sharing your dessert.  This has been in my AR recipe box for nearly a year, and I'm glad I finally gave it a try.

I used these ingredients and did some of my own method. I took fresh plums and put them in boiling water for 3 minutes. Then I peeled, pitted and pureed them. I dissolved the gelatin in the hot plum water (for colour). Then continued following the recipe. I just folded in the thickened milk and it turned out great!

A great light, fruity dessert for summer. I cooked the plums much longer, removing the skins along the way, and used regular evaporated milk -- no fat means no texture when you whip it. I also chilled the bowl first, just like when you whip cream, to make it as light and airy as possible. Next time, I think I'll cut the lemon juice by half, it doesn't need that extra tartness and I want more of the plum flavor to come through. I may also try reducing some of the plum juice, or even use that instead of water for the gelatine.

Lovely tart taste of plums combined with light texture of the slightly sweet milky base.  Will definitely make again

This didn't turn out for me, maybe I didn't whip milk long enough. I might try it again.

I really was just expecting a so so kind of coffee cake. But, boy, was I wrong! This cake (kuchen) was absolutely delicious. I used plums off of my tree (I had a huge bumper crop) and I was so glad it turned out as good as it did. I thought it would be too sweet but the plums gave it a delicious tanginess. I0t would be good with ice cream, a cup of coffee or a glass of milk. I will definitely be making this again0

I think this has good potential, but my family did not prefer it. I think the biggest complaint was the skins.  Next time I try it I will check out some of the other reviewers ideas and definitely make sure they are peeled and pureed.
