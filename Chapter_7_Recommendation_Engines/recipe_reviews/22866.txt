These cookies were a big hit!  My husband said that they were the best that I have ever made!  and I make A-LOT of cookies!  They stay soft and the flavor is unbelievable! Looks like we found a new family favorite!  going to try it with vanilla pudding and milk chocolate chips this time!  I'm sure they'll be great! UPDATE!  the chocolate chip cookies with vanilla pudding were a big success on Christmas, they were all gone in a matter of minutes!  Hubby's begging for more now.. I better go get started!  lolThanks for a great recipe

Yum! I had no peanut butter chips, so I replaced 1/2 the butter with chunky peanut butter instead. Fantastic! The dough was super delicious; it tasted like Reese's Pieces. My only problem--and maybe this is because of my modification--was that there was WAY too much flour called for. I should have used about 1 1/2 cups. I had to knead in the next 1/2 cup of flour in and didn't even add the last 1/4 cup. The dough was very stiff--I rolled it into balls and smashed it. They didn't spread much at all. The cookies turned out tasty, but a little too dry. Next time I will use much less flour to make them drop cookies like the recipes said.

Really moist and chewy!! A few suggestions: 1. Use 1/2 cup stick margarine and 1/2 stick butter instead of 1 cup butter to keep them from getting flat.  2. Chill batter for at least 1 hour to overnight 3. Use 1 teaspoon baking soda instead of baking powder.  Excellent cookie recipe.

My kids and I made this together this morning. My son looked at the recipe and said "Mom, is there any way we can make this MORE chocolate-y?" and I said "Why not?". We cut back on the flour by a quarter cup and added a quarter cup of dutch-process cocoa powder. We also added half of a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. We used Reese's baking chips in this recipe. Absolutely perfect. We tasted a few right out of the oven and they were awesome. Adding the extra chocolate was an excellent idea on my son's part. The great thing about pudding cookies, too, is you don't have to worry about chilling the dough because the pudding thickens up the dough and adds stability so using all butter isn't really an issue. This is our new favorite cookie recipe.

Only 3 stars because of my mistake. DO NOT use sugar free pudding mix in this. Cookies turned out really nice looking but you definitely taste the artificial sweetener from the pudding in them. Will make again with the correct ingredients and update my review.

These are awesome! My husband got in a snit tonight because I yelled at him for finishing the peanut butter and not telling me.  He stormed out of the house and came back with peanut butter and peanut butter chips.  So I looked up a recipe that would require chips and voila!  While I was baking I asked him why he bought the chips.  He said he knew I was going to bake something and was trying to be helpful.  Men.  Sometimes they do get it right.  Anyway, these cookies are delicious. Will definitely put the recipe in my recipe box.  I wish they didn't require a full pound of butter because "a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!"  So I will save these for special occasions.

Tastes like a brownie cookie!  I followed recipe directions but replaced 1/4 cup of the flour with cocoa and added 1/2 tsp salt as other reviewers did to make this extra chocolatey.  They turned out delicious and soft with a great texture.  This is my new favorite cookie!

I loooove these!! As does my whole family.  It is the only cookie recipe I make often.  My husband says they are the best.  I usually mix up the pudding flavors each time and try different chips too.  I love using chocolate pudding with chocolate chips.  I also use butterscotch pudding and it almost tastes just like a really moist chocolate chip cookie!!  So glad I found this recipe. I have made it over and over, always great!!

This is a variation of one of the top chocolate chip cookie recipes on this site, and it makes great chocolate cookies too!  I added 3/4 tsp of salt, an extra 2 T of cocoa, and used a peanut butter and chocolate chip mix blend i found at the store.  My hubby thought these were the best chocolate cookies I've made to date.

These cookies went over so well I had to make another batch! The people i shared them with declared them the best ever...I highly recommend making them. I also switched baking powder to baking soda. When i pulled them out of the oven, they didn't look like they were done...but they were! Delicious!

I replaced 2 tablespoons of flour with 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa (for a more chocolaty taste). and I used 1/2 cup crisco and 1/2 cup butter instead of 1 cup butter (for less spreading). Used baking soda instead of baking powder like SAGGS123 recommended.

Oh.  My.  Goodness.  These are DELICIOUS! I could probably eat a whole batch myself.  I made a few changes out of necessity - I accidentally bought a 2.5oz package of chocolate pudding mix, so I added 5tsp cocoa powder (until it looked the right color), and used the entire bag of peanut butter chips.  I'm making these for my boss who just had surgery, and I don't think they'll last the day!

I really liked these cookies. I substituted the chocolate pudding for vanilla, as well as the peanut chips for left over Halloween chocolate.

Good recipe, but not quite enough chocolate flavoring, for my taste. So next time I think I might add, maybe another pack of pudding mix, or a little cocoa powder. And I love that they kept their shape and didn't spread!

It's a good cookie in general but for those that don't like cakey cookies, these are definitely cakey cookies.    THey are really light and not too sweet which is nice, I just am not a fan of cakey cookies.

Very disappointed in this recipe.  I had high hopes since it had so many stars.  After making them according to the recipe, I realized that many people gave it 5 stars but altered the recipe.  I found these cookies to lack sweetness and to have a strange flour like texture.  Even my daughter wouldn't eat them.

Made the recipe exactly as is. The husband liked them so much that he offered to do the dishes! The batter will be a little thick; that's ok. These taste like the cookie version of a pb cup. Thank you!!!

Be forewarned, the cookies do not change shape once they are in the oven. You may want to flatten them a bit so they look like a cookie. I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose white flour. They were good...but a bit odd looking.

These cookies are awesome!!!  One my most favorite cookies I have ever made.  My whole family has begged me over and over again to make these again.  The second time I made them I had to double recipe because the first time they were gone so fast.  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!!!

These are pretty good. I made banana pudding ones, some with mini chocolate chips and some with caramel bits. I rolled them into walnut-sized balls and baked them for 10 minutes. The texture could be a bit chewier but overall pretty good. Mine didn't flatten out on their own so I had to flatten them myself.

i just made these cookies today, i thought they were pretty good. However i used sugar free chocolate pudding not realizing it would make a big difference so the cookies were ok, but then i sprinkled powdered sugar on them which made them better. next time i will rememeber to use regualr chocolate pudding =)

Great balance of chocolate and peanut butter chips. I too used baking soda instead of powder. These cookies are soft and chewy.
Thanks for sharing.

We loved these cookies and will definitely make them again.  I had bought the small box of pudding mix, though, instead of the large, and discovered my mistake as I was making the batter, so added 4 big tablespoons of sweetened cocoa mix.  It seemed to work out fine, and I would do it again (maybe even a little more).

Really delicious, but they took nearly 18 minutes to bake!  Nowhere near the 8-10 the recipe suggests. Kept having to stick them back in.

Good cookies, I didn't have any peanut butter chips so I used 3/4 cup of peanut butter instead. The cookies had a good flavor but turned out really dry. The batter was delicious though!

I was short on time so I made these into bars. Used oil instead of butter, replaced 1/4 c. flour with cocoa for a richer chocolaty taste, and then used a mixture of vanilla pudding and chocolate pudding, as well as peanut butter chips and chocolate chips. I baked it for around 12 minutes. It was delish!!!!

I usually read the reviews before baking, but I was in a hurry and skipped that.  So I made a batch as is.  First mistake...I'm not big on milk chocolate...shoulda seen if there was a dark chocolate pudding. When I finished baking the first pan, I thought it was too sweet and a little grainy.  So before baking the next batch, I added some salt, cocoa powder and a spoonful of peanut butter. Plus, I smooshed them down into a flatter shape, since they definitely didn't spread out during baking.  The results were better, but I prefer a crisper cookie to the cake type. So these still weren't quite what I wanted.  Not bad, just not ones I'll likely make again.

This were good - and so easy.  I used chocolate pudding and chocolate chips since I couldn't find any peanut butter chips.  I added a bit of chunky peanut butter to the butter mixture and they still turned out nice and moist.

Fantastic cookies - quick and easy and came out very tasty!  A new favorite recipe for sure!  I used chocolate chips instead of peanut butter simply because they weren't available in my local grocery store.  I will be sure to buy some as soon as I see them.  I will be making this recipe with other types of chips and pudding as well.  It's that good!

yummy! followed the directions exactly-- except i used "fudge chocolate" flavored pudding. I dont know if that made a difference. I thought they were perfect, but my SO thought they could be richer.

The addition of instant pudding makes these cookies incredibly moist, and they raise very well. I mix up the ingredients a lot (different types of nuts/pudding/chips) to vary the flavor.

These were ok, but there was something missing.  I think that it should have had more of a chocolate taste.  We are a cookie family and there were definitly leftovers of these that I threw out.  I probably won't make them again.

Very moist for a chocolate cookie! Before when I've made chocolate cookies, they were too crunchy, but these stayed moist til they were gone - which wasn't long! I didn't have any peanut butter chips on hand, so i chopped some Reese's PB cups and put em in. They were delicious.  I also added a little cocoa as another reader suggested. WIll try this recipe with with other puddings and flavors!

WOW!!! These are soooooooo good.  Just made them and they are cooling.  Ate 2 warm.  Very yummy. The only thing I did different was add more peanut butter chips and that was because I like a lot of morsels in my cookies.  Can't wait to take them to work tomorrow.

These cookies are very good! My SO and his co-workers loved them, too. I followed the recipe except: added some cocoa, added 2 T. water because the batter seemed too stiff. My cookies didn't flatten at all. I think they would have looked better if they had. Next time, I'll add some nuts. There will definitely be a next time! I'll try other pudding and chip combos, too.

Yummy, quick and easy. Used 1/2 butter and 1/2 marg., 1 tsp. baking soda instead of baking powder and a little cocoa, as suggested by other reviewers. Excellent will definitely make again.

These cookies are too good.  The pudding gives them a unique flavor, and you just can't go wrong with peanut butter chips!
