I guess the other positive reviewers have never had real Italian Cream Cake.

I'm not one to be harsh on other people's recipes, but this one is not correct.

Problems:

First, it doesn't make anywhere near enough batter for three 9 inch cake pans.

Second, the cakes were impossible to free from the pans.  You have to use parchment for this recipe.

Third, the cakes do not rise.  Italian cream cake is NOT supposed to be this dense.  This was like a dry, greasy brownie.

Solutions:
1.  Use 1/2 tsp of salt, not 1 tsp of baking powder and, most importantly:  

2.  THE EGGS SHOULD BE SEPARATED.  Blend the yolks in with the butter, shortening, and sugar, but don't add the buttermilk until you add the SIFTED flour, alternating both in small batches.  

Once the batter is mixed, beat the remaining egg whites until stiff peaks form, then fold this mixture into the batter gently.  You may also add chopped nuts to the cake batter.

These solutions will then fill three PARCHMENT LINED 9-inch cake pans, and when baked at 325 for 25 minutes, will turn out a true light, springy version of Italian Cream Cake.

If you like the original recipe, that's great, but please, just don't call it "Italian Cream Cake."  Because it isn't.

I've made this cake twice now. The first time I followed the original recipe first and the cake was yummy. It was a bit dense however, so the second time I followed HJONES999 suggestions (except did not add the salt) and, OMGosh... It was sooo much better. The cake was light and dreamy! I would without a doubt make this cake again... over and over, but with the suggested changes. This cake rocks!!

Very good! This was the first made from scratch cake I ever made and it was awesome! The only thing i would do differently is sprinkle the nuts on top. The nuts mixed in with the icing made it hard to spread out without tearing the cake up.

I did not like this at all. I did not use coconut, and did not think it would matter, as other reviewers had done. This was a really greasy, oily cake. Perhaps the coconut would have absorbed some of the oil.----I'm changing my review. The next day, this cake was wonderful. I think it takes a while for all the flavors to settle. I had a piece an hour after I was finished frosting it--it didn't taste right. The day after, however, it was moist, flavorful and delicious. Four Stars!

Hi there,
I made this tonight. It was really good and much admired by the crowd.  I made the following changes:  I added 1/4 cup oil to the batter based on the "thick" comments I read on other reviews.  On the icing, I forgot that others said that it wouldn't cover the whole cake easily, so I doubled the icing recipe, except I only had 8 oz of cream cheese so I got it the right consistency by adding cream till it worked well instead of an extra thing of cream cheese.  The only thing I would do differently next time is possibly 1.5 the the recipe so that the 3 cake pans were fully loaded.  When completed, I cut it like the restaurants do, so the pieces in the middle were all yummy and perfect, but the the perimeter pieces were a little dried out as they were too thin and got a little more done.  It really was quite good.  

I found this review in the saved file, I just made it again on 8/26/08, again it was very good.  I would say though, about the negative ratings, as a cook it always bothers me when people take a recipe, remove ingredients and then give things a bad rating.  I know people who don't share their recipes for just this reason.  If you *do* get their recipes, they have one motto:  Make it exactly how it says in the instructions the first time, then after that do anything you want.  It's a soapbox, but it's only fair.

What a moist, rich, wonderful cake! I made this for a co-worker who was getting married. I don't eat cream cheese so I didn't try it, but everyone just RAVED about this cake.  There wasn't a slice left! Thanks for the recipe!

Truly is incredible!  The first time I made it, the cakes stuck to the pan (even after greasing and flouring it).  So the second time I used wax paper on the bottom of the pans, and it turned out great!  I LOVE the icing!

This is my SECOND review. Have made this cake somewhere around 7-8 times now. All in the past couple of months. WONDERFUL cake. Tried and then continued to use both in the cake as well as the frosing, vanilla butternut extract. Gives the cake a kick. Also, I doubled the frosting for increased amts. between layers and then only used 2 layers, freezing the third for the time. Made 2 at Thanksgiving and my family who are all chocoholic's were calling for this VANILLA recipe! Didn't give it to a sole! Love this cake! Thanks again.

This recipe was advanced for an amateur baker like myself.  I adore Italian Cream Cake, so I gathered every single ingredient and trudged forward.  I follwed the recipe precisely.  An hour and two loads of dirty dishes later, my masterpiece was complete.  This cake was a huge undertaking, but was so totally worth it.  My husband said it was the best thing I have ever made for him!  I've made it three times since and it has tasted the same every time! I love this recipe.

I doubled this recipe and made a 11 x 18 sheet cake.  There was a lot of batter and I even put some in a round cake pan.  The cake has a good flavor, especially with the creme cheese icing.

This recipe really is incredibly delicious.  I added a cup of chopped walnuts to the cake to make it a genuine Italian Cream Cake.  It was as good as cakes I have tasted from bakeries or at restaurants.  Everyone just loved it.

Sooo Good! This cake is dense, rich and yummy. I am a chocolate fiend, but this cake is now a favorite! I recommend that you let the cake sit at least 1/2 - 1 day before serving. It lets the cake flavors bloom. I worried the first time I made it because the layer edges were a tad hard and crispy like, but after frosting it and letting it sit, everything was moist and soft.  I did tweak the frosting it was too sweet for my tastes, I now omit the coconut, use 2x the cream cheese and only 1/2 to 2/3 of a 16 oz. box of powdered sugar (quantity depends on personal taste).

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday and it was so delicious.  I did make a few minor changes:  I used all butter flavored shortening instead of 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening, and I left out the nuts, coconut, and light cream in the frosting.  It seemed more delicate that way.  I didn't think there was enough batter for 3 layers, so I just made two.  This cake was moist, rich, and got rave reviews from everyone at our party.  In fact, I'm making another one today just for us because the other just went too fast!!

This cake was good but it could have been much better. Next time I'm using butter instead of shortening and tsp of almond extract.

I only bake 5 cakes a year and this recipe is good enough for each occasion.  Between my sister and me we have given this recipe out to a dozen friends in the last week.  I fixed it for my parents 62nd anniversary and didn't change a thing.  I am an avid all recipes browser and this is the first recipe I cared enough to write about.

Made this cake for a friend's birthday and everyone loved it!!  I mixed in the egg yolks first to the mixture then whipped up the whites and folded them in at the end (since that's what other recipes do).  Used milk instead of cream for the frosting.  Super easy and delicious!

325 instead of 350, definitely separate the yolks from the whites, and baking soda instead of baking powder. Do those 3 things and it's 5 stars. :)

This cake was a disaster unlike any I have experienced since my early cooking days.  I followed the directions and only greased the pans and I think that was the problem.  I used every trick in the book and I could not get the cakes out of the pans.  They fell totally apart and were not reparable.  I have to say however, that both the cakes and the frosting tasted wonderful.  Lesson learned; always grease and flour.

I decided to go with HJONES999 version, and THIS is how I remember it. Haven't had this in "years" and I can't wait to bring some to family and friends. I made this in 2 layers, and it's out of this world!

I followed HJONES999 recommendations and this cake was WONDERFUL.  It was moist and delicious.  A friend actually made it for my birthday cake and it was great.  I have since used the recipe several times for cupcakes... using no coconut to make a white cake and extra coconut and coconut flavoring along with lots of toasted coconut on top for coconut cupcakes.  Delicious!

This has been my "go to" cake recipe since the seventies with one difference - PECANS people!  Also, my recipe switches the buttermilk and egg whites, as HSJONES999 suggested, and has no addition to the buttermilk.

I followed the advice of user HJONES999 and separated the egg yolks from whites and carefully folded the whites in after forming stiff peaks from my electric beater. Also, I alternated between adding buttermilk and sifted flour instead of just mixing the two. Used 1/2 tsp. of salt and did not add in the baking powder. I lined my pans with parchment paper.

I didn't have light cream so I subbed in 1 tsp of half and half to get my icing to the correct consistency and it made just enough. The next time I make this recipe I will try to add in another quarter of the total amount of icing so the frosting is a little thicker. The layers are very thinly frosted and the top is covered but not as thick as I like it. I topped it off with crushed walnuts after reading another review that it could make the icing scratch the cakes.

It turned out lovely, I will be making this again.

I had never made a layer cake before this one, and it came out SO good! By some miracle, all of my layers came out perfectly flat, so the cake looked really nice when it was frosted. I brought it to work for 2 coworkers' birthdays, and everyone raved about it. One guy even offered to make me one of his famous tri-tips if I make him a bowl of the frosting! I did use some extra coconut in the frosting, since I wanted to get ride of the bag, and I topped the cake with some coconut for a garnish. Overall, very moist and bakery quality!!

This is a good, traditional Italian Cream Cake.  Watch the cooking time and reduce by 10-15 minutes or the cake will be very dry.  Recommend doubling the icing since it it a 3 layer cake

Perfect!  Can't keep my hands off this cake.  I made it in a 9 x 13" dish and baked it 45 min.    For company, I'd make the layers.   It's just the best cake!!!

This cake was awesome! Because of time constraints, I baked the cake on a Sunday and made the frosting and put it together on a Monday. The frosting is sweet, but it sets up so nicely on the cake and it complements it perfectly. It also tastes better after a day or two. I think the cake tasted best at the end of the week.   I made only a couple of small changes. I made the cake in two layers because I didn't have a third round pan available. There was plenty of frosting left over if I had wanted to make a third layer (in fact, the amount leftover after assembling the cake was the equivalent of about a container and a half of store bought frosting). I also left out walnuts (my husband has an allergy) and replaced them with slivered almonds. I left them out of the frosting mix itself. Instead, I toasted the almonds and used them on the outer sides of the cake. (I've posted pictures.) The results were fabulous, and I will be making this cake again and again.

This is a great recipe!  As other reviewers suggested I did separate the eggs and folded in the whipped whites at the end.  Also, the icing was a little too sweet for me so I'll probably cut back on the sugar next time.  One last note would be that I used sweetened flaked coconut for both the icing and cake and it worked out fine.  The cake was moist and wonderful.

This one was nice. It was SO moist, and so good! I did make some changes, though. I didn't want to use so much shortening, so I used a can of coconut milk instead. Additionally, I didn't have buttermilk, so waited to make this recipe when I knew I'd have some sour milk around (couple of days). I also left halved the amount of coconut. UNREAL flavor! UNREAL texture. So moist! This would be good with a touch of rum (or almond extract) in the frosting.

I will go against the grain here and say that this cake was just okay. The problem? It was too sweet (and I only used 3/4 the amount of sugar) and there was really nothing special about the taste. Coconut-lovers: If you still want to try this cake, I would suggest sprinkling the top with toasted coconut (brown 3/4 c. coconut flakes in 1 T. melted butter over low heat; drain on paper towel before sprinkling on cake) - this added to the flavor. Otherwise, skip this one if you don't like  anything too sweet and heavy.

This was delicious.  A tad dry, so I may add some sour cream to it next time, but really, really, really good.

This cake was absolutely delicious.  I made it for Thanksgiving this year and almost didn't get a slice.  I made it exactly as the recipe is written.  I actually am about to make another one after I finish this review.  You'll love this cake!!!  Give it a try!!

In response to CASAMORROW's request (below) for an "authentic Italian Cream Cake" recipe, try this one:
Italian Rum Pastry Cake
1 (18.25 ounce) box cake mix
1 small box regular chocolate pudding mix
1 small box regular vanilla pudding mix
Dark rum or Myers fruit rum
Whipping cream
Vanilla extract
Granulated sugar
Maraschino cherries (optional)
Chocolate sprinkles or finely chopped nuts

Bake the cake in two layers. Prepare COOKED pudding using whole milk.

After the cake has cooled, cut each layer in half. Soak the inside of the layers with rum, but do not over-soak.

When the pudding is cool, add the chocolate to one layer and the vanilla to the other layer. To fill the middle of the four layers, use whipped cream made with vanilla extract and granulated sugar. You can also add drained, halved maraschino cherries to the middle layer, if desired.

Use whipped cream to cover the top and sides of the cake. Decorate with pastry flowers or candied flowers, if desired. Decorate with chocolate sprinkles or nuts, if desired.

NOTE: While preparing each layer, keep all ingredients and cake layers not being used in the refrigerator, taking them from the refrigerator as you need to work with them.

Please excuse the rating/review......I confused this recipe with another....will leave the 5 star rating because I am sure it is just as good as the other because the ingredients are almost identical....except the other is a sponge cake which is put together a little differently.

This was a wonderful cake with the modifications.
My wife works at a restaraunt, I sent a large slice of cake to work with her. Well the owner stole most of the slice. Said he couldnt get enough.

Good but not incredible. I've never made a cake from scratch so that was fun, or icing for that matter! All in all it came out well, tasted good, but I believe my box cakes still had a better flavor. 
The icing was very good though! But I did put too much cream I think (the 2 tsps the recipe calls for) because my refrigerated icing slid off the sides a bit and made my cake top slide a little on the bottom cake (I only did 2 layers, there is NOT enough batter for three! Or icing!)

Also, I followed HJONES99's advice with the eggs and my cakes rose well. Although lopsided :/

I also lined the bottom with parchment and then nonstick sprayed the sides and bottom of the parchment and WAM cakes slid out by themselves!

Also omitted coconut as my husband and I are not fans. 

Sorry for the novel. Overall, good cake but not sure if I'll make again.

Believe it!  It is incredibly delicious.  I have been baking professionally for 10+ years, and this received rave reviews at my last gig.  It is moist, flavorful, and delicious.  I left out both the coconut and the pecans, because my client hates both!  And still, it was DELICIOUS.  Also, I used 1/2 cream cheese icing, and 1/2 buttercream for the purposes of easier decorating.  Anyhoo... GREAT cake!!!

Wow!  Great cake!  Took it to work and it was gone in a flash!  I typically have a high standard to live up to with them since they know I tend to cook well.  So when word got out it went like hotcakes.  I doubled the icing since I like more icing than recipes usually call for and put extra icing between the layers.  That's just my own personal preference though.  The folks at work thought that was a good move.

I've read posts that the cake was difficult to remove from the pans.  Sure, it didn't just pop out of the pan. But I lifted by one edge and then turned upside down and had no problem getting the cake out in one piece.  I used Wilton cake pans and sprayed with butter pam.

The family felt jipped because I didn't let them have any last night.  So now I'm off to make another cake.  Glad it was easy to make, too.

This cake was absolutely wonderful!  I made it in a 9x13 pan just to make it easier on myself.  I served it at a work staff meeting and got rave reviews from everyone! I will definately make this recipe again.

The frosting was very delicious; however, the cake in my opinion was good but a little heavier/denser than I like.  I made 1/2 the recipe and baked in an 8" square pan.

This cake is very good. I used butter instead of margarine, cake flour instead of all purpose flour, toasted coconut and toasted pecans. I doubled the frosting and added 1/2 cup of Coco Lopez cream of coconut. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

Excellent recipe - I followed the recipe EXCEPT I used a 9x13 pan (greased and floured) and it was wonderful.  Yes, it's dense, but this type of cake is, and I'm not a big fan of layered cakes, so everyone thought it was delicious.

I followed this recipe w/the changes according to HJONES999.  It turned out beautifully!  And very tasty!  My family loved it!  I did not however have to use parchment paper.  I greased and floured the pans and they did not stick at all.  I do however, have some very good non-stick 9" pans and I believe that helped :-)

made this using HJONES999 changes and did not have 3 pans and used 2 which took almost 45 minutes at 350 degrees to bake.     Very good had nothing but rave reviews, but will try this again after purchasing my 3rd pan in a couple of weeks for a dear friends birthday.    Thank you!

This was one of the most amazing tasting cakes I have ever tasted, and I didn't have any trouble making it. It turned out beautifully. The only change I made was instead of walnuts I used pecans, in the icing and the cake. It was incredible! One of the best creme cheese frostings I have ever tasted!

Made this for my husband's B-day & everyone loved it!  He wants me to make it for him every year now - not sure what I got myself into.  I tried not to eat any because I avoid sugar, but it called to me from the fridge in the middle of the night.  It was DELICIOUS!  I used light cream cheese & it still came out great.  Makes enough for 3 9" layers - it rises - but stuck to the pans (even though I used shortening on them).  I pounded on one & the middle crumbled out, leaving a donut-shaped cake stuck to the pan.  I finally got it out w/a spatula, smashed the middle back in & used it as the center layer.  Nobody could tell.  My mom suggested I cut circles of waxed paper to line the bottom of each pan, which I will do next time to prevent sticking.

I made this for Easter dessert and everyone that had it loved it.  I did flour and grease the pans and no problem removing the cakes.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.  I thought the nuts and coconut in the frosting made it look really different.  I made it the day before and kept it in the refrigerator.  It was perfect the next day.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband claims he doesn't like coconut - but this is his favorite cake.  Sometimes I spread vanilla pudding between the layers.  If not, I increase the frosting recipe.  This is a cake that I make for special family occasions because it is so impressive.

This is my very first cake from scratch, and It was awesome. I made it for my husband for our anniversary last week and he loved it.  Since I'm not a coconut eater I eliminated the coconut and the recipe was still great. Very delicious cake. Will make again.

I made this with the suggestion from the first reviewer. It was fantastic.i doubled the vanilla extract, added some lemon juice to the egg whites. I ground up the coconut in my ninja before putting into the batter so they weren't chunky. My husband says its taken the place of carrot cake as his favorite.6

It was ok. The frosting is really good. But the cake needs to be worked on.

meh. The instructions don't mention the need to beat the egg whites to stiff peaks before folding them in at the end. It's the only thing I changed the first time through... 
Passable, but I'll keep looking for that perfect recipe.

My family really enjoyed this cake recipe. But I do agree that this recipe doesn't produce quite enough batter to fill 3 cake pans. The flavor and texture was pleasing to us. I even wanted to use this recipe for my wedding cake!

This cake was a hit! So yummy, moist and flavor was great. This is a keeper and I will definitely be making this cake for other events. I do a lot of baking and was told by family members that this was their all time favorite cakes so far. Absolutely delicious!!!

THIS WAS A GREAT RECIPE. IT CAME OUT MOIST ANY DELICIOUS, AND I GOT RAVE REVIEWS. THE ONLY THING I DID DIFFERENTLY WAS INSTEAD OF USING CRISCO I USED CRISCO BUTTER BARS AND MARGARINE IN BOTH THE CAKE AND ICING AND CHOPPED WALNUTS...

Really great flavor...but very strange not cake-like conistency.  I have had good Italian cream cake before and this is very different.  It does taste good, though.

This rating is for the frosting only (I used a different cake recipe). I loved this frosting, it was fantastic. I will use again and again. I omitted the coconut when I made it and I added a bit more butter and powdered sugar to increase the amount of frosting. I also make a unique variation of this by adding almond and mint extract to it instead of vanilla, turned out very good.

This was really good.  I took suggestions and cooked about 5-10 minutes less than instructed. As with all cakes, baking pans should be lined with wax paper.  Icing is wonderful.

Awesome cake!!  I put all of the batter into one 9" round springform pan though...it didn't look like there would be enough batter for 3 pans.  Still turned out fantastic!!  For the icing, I cut the powdered sugar in half and it was still plenty sweet.  I used about 1.5 cups of chopped walnuts, and only sprinkled the coconut on top instead of mixing it in the icing.  I'll use this recipe again!

I made this cake as a mother's day present for my Mom. She requested "anything coconut". When I removed the cakes from the pans I tasted a small piece off the top.  The taste was divine, buttery coconut. I was very excited about what the finished product would taste like. When we finally cut into it and tried it, I was a bit disappointed. It seemed dry and missing something. My mother SAYS she loved it, but I think I'll try a different recipe next time. Someone suggested reducing the cooking time by 10 minutes. I wish I had read that before making the cake.

I used this recipe b/c I lost my original one at the grocery store!  I've made it for a church potluck and only brought home an empty cake plate.  The second time I packed my plate with half a slice left to take to my kids.  Needless to say everyone loved it.  Next time I will decrease the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. it was too sweet especially with the frosting.

When I made this it did not raise as my other cakes have. I thought it must not be that good. But when I took it to work it was a
hit, everyone wanted the recipe and are still talking about it. Pointer----- mix batter well.

I thought this was a great recipe.  It wasn't hard to make and I am FAR from an expert with baking.  I made it for a big family gathering last night and today they ate it all up and raved about it.  I will make this recipe again!

I made this cake as a birthday cake for my mother.  She loved it.  Everyone said the cake tasted more like candy than cake.  I did not make it a three layer cake but opted for the 2 layer approach.  My mothers new favorite cake of all-time.

Very good. I always butter the cake pans and coat with bread crumbs, instead of flour.  Have always done all my cakes this way and is very good.

This cake is amazing!! I made it EXACTLY as the recipe states and it was soooooooo moist and yummy. Everyone at home absolutely loved it and demolished it in record time.
The frosting was also delicious even though I used plain flaked coconut instead of sweetened. I am very tempted to make another batch of frosting JUST for me. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I have tried this recipe 3 times now, and though it is indeed "incredibly delicious", it never came out right. This cake doesn't rise correctly, nor does it separate from cake pans, or even cupcake wrappers very well at all. I assure you this was no error on my part because I make cakes all the time as a hobby. I greased and floured the cake pans before baking and it still stuck to the bottom. I did not enjoy this recipe and I am angry I wasted so many ingredients in my kitchen on it.

I'll start by saying, I've never eaten Italian Cream Cake, so I have no clue as to whether this is "authentic" as some of the reviewers are debating - however - I do make a lot of baked goods and I know if something is tasty or not.  This IS tasty.  I also dislike when people change recipes and then complain about them.  Having said that I have to admit, I had to change a couple of things because of ingredient snafoos.  One of my Five eggs had a bloody yolk when I cracked it open so I only had 4 left to use.  I replaced the liquid from the 1 missing egg with a 1/4 cup of coconut milk that I did happen to have on hand.  I also ran out of white sugar (I KNOw, it's been one of those days)so I had to use 1 and 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I baked it in two nine inch layers and they were done at just 20 minutes.  Even with my ingredient problems the cake was moist and good.  I'm giving it 5 stars just for being so adaptable.  I'm still a chocolate lover so this will never be a favorite for me but it was moist and flavorful - even better the next day.

Ok, this cake did not turn out that well the first time I made it.  It stuck to the pan and I have some very good Wilton cake pan. So, because I bake lots of cakes I expected more from this recipe.  It was for a client and I had to bake it over in which it turn out better.  I am use to sifting my flour and it does not cause for sifting and I noticed the diffference in the batter.  The icing is AWESOME! My client said the cake was AWESOME as well. So, I will give this cake 5 star! :-)

This is not a great recipe - the eggs need to be separated and the whites fluffed.  I made a three layer cake that should have been two.  I will find another recipe next time that suits my needs.

Beat the egg whites till fluffy (which is norm for me when preparing cake batter), otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The cake was still a tad dense, but the flavor was delicious.  Made 2 layers only.  Frosting delicious also, but I only used 2.5 cups of powdered sugar and it was sweet enough.  Overall, extremely pleased with the taste and appearance of the cake; the one drawback is that it was just a bit dense.  This drawback would NOT stop me from making it again, though :)

I made this recipe and I also made it with the changes suggested by HJONES999.  It turned out very light and fluffy.  I got rave reviews. I added too much light cream at first and got the icing a bit too runny but it was easily adjusted and I'm glad I thickened it up. I used chopped pecans in the cake and for the frosting I used pecans chopped up very fine and then topped it off with whole pecans spaced around the top.  I was VERY pleased with the outcome.  I would definitely make this cake again with confidence.

Wow, this cake was amazing. It only lasted about 2 days and I think even then everyone was holding back and not seem greedy. I will be making this cake again very soon.

Yummy cake! I used sweetene coconut for the cake batter and realized afterwards maybe it should have been unsweetened...  So I used unsweetned coconut for the frosting.  It was yummy cake  I separated eggs since I was looking for a ligt cake.  I think this cake would taste good even w/out cocout.

This was AMAZING. I cooked it for my dad for fathers day and everyone loved it. I made it just as the recipie says with just a few changes. First reduce the cooking time to 30 minutes otherwise it will burn. Also, since I didn't have enough cream cheese for a second batch of icing, in between the layers I put in a some pineapple topping for ice cream, that way there was something there, plus a little  bit of icing. This way I had plenty of icing for the top and sides of the cake. Otherwise, it was perfect!!!

I did a lot of research to make the perfect cake for my mother in laws birthday party.  Someone in the group hates chocolate, so I thought this might be a hit, (plus we are a group of italians).  After buying cream cheese, buttermilk, shortening, b/c I didn't have these items on hand. I headed into the kitchen for an hour making this cake.  We all sat down to eat it, and it was just a plain old yellow cake, with sugary icing.  I was better off using a boxed (gasp) cake.  And making my own icing.  What a let down, after so much research, time and money.

I loved this cake! I used 2 round cake pans instead of 3, and left out the walnuts and it came out great! It is very dense, but rich and tasty! I had to double the icing quantity to have enough for the filling and the outside of the cake. It came out looking like I bought it from a bakery, and tasted like it too! Very yummy!

I have never tried this cake before I doubled all the ingredients to make a 1/4 sheet cake I even had enough batter left over to make muffins. I also let the cake and some of the muffins sit over night and the taste was even better. The best cake I have had in a long time. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this cake for Easter and I have to tell you it is the most over the top cake I have ever tasted. Most people at the dinner I went to left half on their plates. It is just insanely rich and sweet. Would not make again although it did look beautiful.

I baked this cake today for my grandmothers birthday party tomorrow. I cut a small piece to taste and it was wonderful. I did make a few changes to the recipe though. I used butter flavored shortening instead of using both butter and shortening. I added finely ground walnuts to the cake batter along with the coconut and I used a little less sugar than what the recipe calls for. I also added at 1/4 tsp of salt to the batter and I used Vanilla Butternut flavoring. I did not use the frosting, because I had a request for a whipped cream frosting. I used the Cool Whip frosting recipe found on this site, but I used white chocolate pudding mix (mmmm tasty!!). I know this cake will be a hit at the party.
3/01/04 - I had to come back to say the cake was a hit. Everyone raved about the flavor and how it wasn't too sweet. There were a lot of older women there and a couple of them asked ME for the recipe. The cake was moist and flavorful. I already have a request for this cake at our next family gathering.

Delicious cake - I made it a day ahead of time for my son's second birthday and he loved it. Instead of regular shortening I used Spectrum trans-fat free shortening, and I made 2 layers instead of 3 (once the batter was divided three ways it looked like an impossibly small amount in each pan so I divided it in half instead). Also, the cakes didn't need to bake nearly as long as the recipe indicated, although that might be my oven. I omitted the coconut from the icing and added more half and half.  Greasing and flouring the pans is essential.  I'm giving it four stars because the texture of the cake was slightly spongy for my taste. Once the cake was frosted and sat in the frig for a day (thank you reviewers!) it was fine.

I must have done something wrong! I had such high hopes for this recipe and made it for the bottom tier of my wedding cake. I always bake a week in advance and freeze, maybe this cake just doesn't freeze well. It was very dry. Nobody commented on the taste of the cake which is a bad sign. This recipe has such raves that I will probably try it again to see if I can figure out what went wrong. I followed the recipe exactly.

This cake was delicious, and everyone liked it.  Two of the three layers fell a little during cooling - I was able to mask this with a bit of coconut dumped on top.  Very moist, great flavor.

I made this cake for an engagement party for my fiance and I -- everyone loved it!  It wasn't hard to make at all, although it took a little time.  We had no problem transporting it -- I stuck it in the fridge for 24 hours and it  helped it to "firm up" and tasted great.  I, too, doubled the frosting, so thanks for the advice! I also left the coconut out of the batter since some aren't so wild about coconut. Great recipe!

I made this for a ladies book club I am in.  They loved it.  It was also a hit with my husband and son (daughter doesn't eat nuts).  I personally thought the cake itself was a little too spongy (I was the only one who thought that, but I'm ultra critical when it comes to food!), but it was good.  The icing was, also.  One of the other reviews said the cake was too sweet.  I would have to agree, but it wasn't so much that it was offensive.  I WILL make this cake again.  I don't know what changes I'll make, but it would still be fine without changes.  And it was fairly fast to make, as far as a cake of this quality is concerned.  I found the time guidelines here to be very accurate.  Thank goodness, because I had less than an hour-and-a-half from start to serve.

If you want a memorable cake for an occasion, this is the one to make. Even people who swear they only want a sliver come back for a hunk of this stuff.  One caveat--I had a tough time getting it out of the pans, as the recipe just asks to grease pans. I'll use parchment next time.

5 stars with a few modifications a la HJONES999: definitely parchment paper on the bottom, and I greased the sides. Let the buttermilk stand after the soda's mixed in until it doubled in volume. Sifting flour was a must. I used baking powder (not salt) and it turned out okay, but will probably try the salt next time because I wonder if this was over leavened. Separated the eggs--that's a must.

I am a true Southern so I toasted 1/2 cup pecans, chopped, and put in the batter before folding in the beaten egg whites. Left walnuts out. Toasted another 1/2 cup to put in the layers.

I was surprised that the three layers were only 1 inch thick after baking and cooling, so the overall cake height after icing was only 4.5 in. It looked okay but definitely not 2 inch layers here. Again, thinking of substituting 1/2 tsp salt for the baking powder next time.

For decor, I kept the icing smooth and then layered the sweetened coconut and toasted pecans on top of it. This cake was for a Princess so went for full-white with the decor, o/w I'd have toasted the coconut in a heartbeat. It was a definite hit. Soft, rich, airy, and memorable. I will make it again.

This cake was great! I followed the recipe without changing anything and it came out great. The frosting was a favorite with the family. All of the ingredients came together with no problems at all. This is one of my favorite cakes now. I look forward to making this cake many more times.

Yes it is a good cake , but if you want an even better cake add 1 cup of drained crushed pineapple,and instead of 1 teas of vanilla, use 1/2 teas of vanilla and 1/2 teas of almond. Definately fills up 3 9" pans.I used Pam spray and also floured pans and had no trouble with  them sticking to the pan. I let them cool 5 min in pan and then removed them,cooled them on baking racks until ready to icing.Sometimes sitting your cake pan in ice water helps relieve the sticking in the pan problem.

Cake tasted great . . but, couldn't get it out of the greased & floured pans.  Do as HJONES999 recommends - use parchment paper.  Also, I tried to keep it (slightly) GF - used 1-1/2 c. Brown Rice Flour & 1/2c white (wheat) flour - had great texture/taste.

Very good recipe! Never made a cake like this before and I thought it turned out very well. I didn't have buttermilk so I soured my own and I soaked the layers of cake in a simple syrup/rum mixture before I iced it...also adding a little rum to the icing :)

I didn't have any nuts, but other than that, I made this recipe true to it's directions and it turned out great!  I love that it's dense and heavy...just how it should be.  Wonderful taste and the frosting was out of this world!

This was my first attempt at a fully homemade, old-fashioned type recipe. My husband loved it! The cake was so wonderful, dense and moist all at the same time. I didn't do a very good job of greasing/flousing or papering my pans...so they did stick. Luckily I covered my messy cakes with that wonderful icing AND I covered the entire cake in chopped walnuts to disguise my mistakes! Next time I will only make 2 layers and pay more attention to preparing the pans. Overall, I still loved it!

I never had tried Italian cream cake before. But I was looking for something different for a family gathering. I did make some differences in the recipe though... to try and make it a little healthier hehe. I used 2 eggs, and the rest were egg substitute. I used rice milk instead of buttermilk. Didn't add the coconut flakes, but put in coconut extract instead. Only had to bake it about 25 minutes. It turned out good! My family liked it alot. The frosting was yummy, I added 1/2 tsp. of coconut extract to that as well. So it had a light coconut flavoring along with the cake.

Outstanding cake. Instead of making this as a layer cake I made it a sheet cake (I know not correct for the purest among us but I'm more concerned with function & taste than with purestery). Was excellent. Right moisture content. Icing is beyond outstanding. Made this as birthday cake for my girlfriend's mother who is actually an educated homemaking teacher. She loved it.

Excellent!   However I increased the icing recipe by 1/2, as I didn't feel it made enough the first time.  I did not have any problems loosening the cakes from the pans as some others have - both times I have greased and floured my pans liberally.  I did not have to add the cream to the icing as it was the consistency was perfect without it.

This cake was good, but not wow. I made it in a 9x13 and cooked about 43 minutes. Heavy cake with not alot of flavor. A carrot cake would have been better with the frosting. If you don't like sweet frosting you won't like this. Frosting had good flavor and the kids loved it.

Tastes good but looked pretty bad.  I made it in two 10-inch pans instead of 3 9-inch, but I don't think that should make it fall apart.  Still, the icing saved it...the icing is very good, especially if you chill the iced cake overnight.  I followed the frosting and cake recipes exactly (aside from the pan size).  The cake was too hard to get out of the pans - do use parchment or flour the pans.  Also, the cake had a grainy and slightly lumpy texture.  I would suggest adding one egg at a time to the creamed butter, beating after each egg, and then adding the rest of the ingredients.  Adding everything at once (as the recipe suggests) probably messes up the texture.  The flavour is great...one person at the party did request the recipe!

I came across this while searching for a recipe like my Mom's from when I was a child.  It sounded right, but the icing has WAY too much butter in it.  I was like eating butter with a fork.  The search continues....

My husband has always talked about Italian Cream Cake.  I had never heard of it so I looked here.  This is the absolute best recipe.  It has been a HUGE hit at several events.  This recipe is now known as one of my "signature" recipes.  Thanks for sharing it.

This cake went over very well. My wife does not like cream cheese frosting and she even thought it was nice- though a little sweet. I think next time I make this I'll add about a tablespoon of fresh orange zest to the frosting to give it a little zest. The cake itself was VERY flavorful, very unique. This recipe would actually make a nice sheetcake for an affair. (Just remember to use parchment paper.)

Oh my gosh!  Our class made this for 75 people and they loved it!  We even sold extra slices which has never happened in the University's history!  This is a fabulous cake!  We used all name brand products and I think that really helped as well.

This cake took a lot of prep time and like someone else said, not worth the effort.  The result was good, but not superb.  No problems getting it out of the pan, nor was it too greasy or bland at any point. Tasted good on the first day as well as the third day. In fact, it turned out absolutely perfectly.  Just not worth the effort if you're expecting something spectacular.  3 and a 1/2 stars. Disappointing as I have been saving this recipe for a special occasion.

First review of site and WOW is all I can say.  Followed recipe, except mixing technique, made smooth cream cheese frosting and pressed toasted almonds on sides, toasted coconut on top for more attractive presentation.  Came out perfect and guests begged to take home - I let them as afraid if kept it, would eat the whole thing!  Try this recipe and you won't be disappointed.

As I've found with other cakes, this cake tasted better the day after it was baked and iced.  The first day it was good, the second day it was SCRUMPTIOUS!  The icing was great and its consistency was perfect just by following the recipe.

This cake was pretty yummy.  It didn't take near as long to bake though so watch out you don't overdo it.  I also think that next time I make it I won't add the coconut to the frosting but instead will press it on after I frost it.  It would be a much prettier cake that way.

This is a great cake! I only practiced it 2 times before submitting it in a fair...I got a blue ribbon-perfect marks! The only thing I changed is don't mix the coconut and nuts into the frosting, sprinkle on top of the frosting for a more presentable look :) good recipe Rory

I made this cake for a friend’s baby shower. We had a tea party theme and this cake looked beautiful and tasted absolutely wonderful. The guests asked where I purchased it and I was proud to say that I had made it. I toasted some extra coconut for the top.  Thanks for this recipe!!

This cake is very easy and quick to make. One of the best yellow cakes I've ever had as it is not too sweet, and had excellent texture. Keep the frosting on the sparse side because it is super-rich. A spectacular cake!

I only frosted between the layers (increase frosting recipe by half if you want to frost the sides) and topped it with a fan-sliced strawberry.  Very elegant and delicious!

I doubled the butter in the batter for increased moistness & flavor.

I made this cake for my husband's 40th surprise birthday party.  We had 40 people over.  I also had other cakes and desserts, but our guests are still talking about this one!  It truly was the winner.  Thank you Rory for sharing this one.  It was better than any store bought cake for sure.  Anna

Recipe is easy to follow and produces a great cake. I suggest lining you pans with parchment, because the coconut in the batter sticks to the pans.

This cake was excellent.  I made it according to the short video and it turned out beautifully.  I took it some visiting preachers and they loved it.  I have never made this kind of cake before and did not know what to expect but they assured me it tasted truly authentic.  Thank you so much for the recipe and I love the videos. ;-)

I made this cake for my daughter-in-law’s birthday as she said Italian Cream Cake was her favorite!!!  This recipe is fabulous as is!!!  I used black walnuts in my recipe as I love that black walnut flavor, and it could have been better!!!  Everyone was so-o pleased and she said it was the best she ever had!!!  It is a delicious recipe!

Followed recipe as-is 1st time, turned out ok, tasted best after it sat 3 days. Made again for my wedding following HJONES999 6/5/2005 review; however, for cake: doubled coconut and vanilla, used all butter (no shortening), added a dash of salt but kept baking soda (makes cakes rise; like this recipe, most buttermilk recipes use BOTH baking soda and baking powder). Doubled the recipe to completely fill 9” pans. Baked cake Wednesday wrapping pans in wet washcloth and foil at 325 until done, refrigerated. Iced Friday using doubled recipe (with walnuts and toasted coconut ON icing between layers and on sides rather than IN icing). Served Saturday. Was super moist, tasted fabulous and guests raved that they’d pay more for it than the best they’ve had from a restaurant or bakery

Followed suggestions regarding egg separation and alternating sifted flour and buttermilk mixture and it was a HIT! I’m the designated cake baker for family functions and I don’t think I’ve ever had every single person tell me it the was the best cake they’ve ever had!

I made this for a Christmas party.  It was a really big hit.  So delicious.  The picture looks like it has walnuts in the batter but the recipe does not indicate that.  So I left them out but I think it would have been even better with some in the cake itself.  Also I cooked the cake for 30 minutes  as the recipe indicated but it was a little too dry.  I would check it at 20 minutes especially if you have a convection oven.  Everyone has asked me for the recipe and I would definitely make it again.

MADE THIS BEFORE HOWEVER ANOTHER RECIPE.
CAME OUT GREAT.  WITH THIS ONE I NOTICED AFTER PUTTING THE  EGGS IN THAT THE SUBSTANCE WAS TO LIQUID.  THEN I NOTICED THAT I HAD PUT IN 5 EXTRA LARGE EGGS.  AS I ADDED THE COCONUT IT BEGAN TO LOOK TOO OILY FOR SOME REASON .  HOWEVER, I IMPROVISED A BIT, ALTHOUGH THE TEMP SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT 3 25 DEGREES,  AS IT WAS BROWNING  TOO QUICKLY AT 350 DEGREES.  I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN BUT WILL HAVE TO IMPROVISE A BIT.  I HAVE NOT TASTED IT AS IT IS FOR MY KIDS.  THEY WILL LET ME KNOW.  MAKE SURE YOU USE LARGE EGGS AND FRESH FLAKED COCONUT.  I THICKEND THE BATTER BY ADDING THE COCONUT IN THE MIX AND IN THE FROSTING.

Five Stars if you follow HJONES999 's notes.  Even the sibling who never pays me compliments, silently went back for thirds .  And this was my first adult attempt at making a cake.  A hit for holiday or general family gatherings.

I, like others, followed HJONES999 suggestions. I got a bit nervous to make this cake like its original recipe since I saw quite a few complaints as to how dense or off it came out.  Following HJONES' advice,  this cake is a definite winner.  Very good, light, flavorful cake.  I can't describe it.......it's just excellent and different than others I've made before

Bakery quality and presentation - this cake is outstanding! I was worried the coconut would be overwhelming, but its not. The cake is dense and moist, with a slightly crunchy texture, due to the coconut flakes. The cream cheese frosting is perfect, and the recipe makes enough to frost the entire cake generously. I don't care for nuts so I left them out; in my opinion, this drew more attention to the cake flavors. Also, because this cake is so rich and sweet, you can get away with smaller servings, if desired. 
The cake is easy to make but everyone will think you spent more time on it. I served it to dinner guests and they took home the leftovers! I chilled it before serving but that's a personal preference. I will definitely make this again and again.

I started to mix pecans into the batter & use cake flour instead of all-purpose flour.  It was thick & spongy &  did not taste like Italian cream cake that I have eaten & made in the past. I wished I had followed my gut & made changes,  but followed the recipe. Next time, I will go with my instincts & make the adjustments that HJONES999 suggested.

I made this cake and it does not make enough batter for the 3 cake pans.   It tasted okay but I would double receipe if I made it again so the cake layers would be bigger.

Loved this cake! SHHHH, better then my Italian family recipe. I did add extra walnuts to the batter , its awesome with or without the extra walnuts. Also, I mixed cake flour with the all purpose flour and it was really tender and soft.  1 problem , get ready for everyone to request this delicious cake again & again.  oxx

I made this cake for my sister's Bachelorette party and EVERYONE loved it! I did add chopped walnuts to the cake batter, and colored the tiers for a nice surprise of hot pink and turquoise. I doubled the recipe for both the cake and icing, but that was to make a 4 layered cake. The photo I posted, is only of the bottom 2 tiers. I ended up covering all 4 with a marshmallow fondant, which kept the cake nice and moist for 2 days before the party.  I would HIGHLY recommend using wax or parchment paper to line the bottom of the pan, as my 1st cake stuck to the pan and was very difficult to separate. This cake was DELICIOUS, so moist, icing so tasty, and I will absolutely be making this again!!!

The 5-star rating is with the following changes (thank you other reviewers!): 1) whip egg whites separately and fold in after other ingredients are mixed; 2) add buttermilk alternately with dry ingredients; 3) add 1 cup nuts to batter; 4) bake in 3 8-inch round pans at 325 degrees 25-30 minutes.  I generously greased and floured the cake pans and had no trouble with sticking.  Frosting was sufficient for the 2 layers I frosted (put the third in the freezer for later); definitely would've needed more  for all three layers.  And boy is that frosting delicious!  I sprinkled nuts on top for decoration and just because I love nuts.  We all loved the finished product, even my husband who's not a coconut fan, and most of us had seconds.  Next time I may try increasing the cake batter vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp but it was excellent as it was.  Also, I'd like to bake in a 9x13 pan as another reviewer suggested for convenience and ease in cutting smaller pieces, as this is a VERY rich cake.

Everyone LOVED this cake! I made it for my adult sons birthday and it was very well received. When I make it again (and I will) I will likely put either bavarian cream in the middle between layers or a fruit filling. With the frosting, I would eliminate the nuts and coconut and add those later.

I have made this cake several times. My husband brands it his favorite cake. My children love this cake also. I don't remember how many times I had to make this for birthday cakes. Love, love, love it.

This was absolutely delictable and so easy to make with not much effort or prep time required.  My family loved it despite the fact that I reduced the sugar by 40% of what the recipe called for.

I made the cake with the recipe as written, with the exception that I separated the eggs. I put the yolks into the batter then  beat the whites to stiff peaks , and folded them into the batter before pouring into the pans.   The moisture and texture of the cake was near perfect.  Two of my guests were semi pro bakers and each said that the cake and icing, together, were a winning combo.  As usual, I can always rely on Allrecipes.com for reliable recipes and reviews that are spot on.

Phenomenal!!!!  I used the Italian Butter Cream Frosting, rather than the one with this recipe.  A bit touchy but I stuck with it and came out perfect.

I haven't made a cake in a long time because they never seen to work out.  I took a chance on this one and it was easy to make and extremely delicious - a huge hit with my family. The only modification I made was to substitute pecans for walnuts as my hubby favors pecans.

I've made this cake so many times. It's my husband's birthday request every year. I add salt, almond extract, and butter extract. I whip the egg whites separately. I do this step first because you don't have to clean the stand mixer bowl in this order. Just transfer the whipped whites to another bowl once whipped. If you cream the fats first, you have to make sure the bowl is completely oil free, so the whites can whip up stiff. Less cleaning makes me happy. Put all the ingredients on the counter a few hours before you plan to get started.

Added nuts to the cake batter. Parchment paper in pans is necessary. I also added a smaller amount of nuts and coconut to a small portion of the icing for the inter layer filling, and left the rest of the icing smooth for frosting.

Oh my gosh! This cake is just as it is named....Incredible! I made this for my daughter's birthday (who is an excellent cook in her own right) and she was elated. I will make this again and again but, I did make a slight change. I didnt' put the walnuts in the batter, just used them for garnish on top. And I did an absolutely idiotic goof when making it. I inadvertently left out the buttermilk mixture, distributed the cake mix into the layer pans and had already been baking them for 9 minutes when I discovered my goof. I panicked..
jerked them out of the oven. They had started to bake around the edges and the mix was very warm. But I thought...
let's just see what happens if I scoop the mix back into the bowl, add the buttermilk and put the layers back in the oven. I really didn't want to start from scratch and make another cake so I sat in front of the oven fingers crossed.
The cake turned out perfectly and was raved about by my entire family.

No walnuts on hand and I live 20 miles from closest store so pecans were used to substitute.  I took the advice of others & omitted the nuts from the icing to make it easier to spread. I did sprinkle pecans on each layer before putting the next layer & a solid layer of pecans on the very top. Cake was moist, not dry. I am NOT a good cake baker but this cake was picture worthy & the friend who received it for her birthday request loved it. I did put parchment paper on each pan bottom and had no problems getting cakes out of the pans. They were thin layers but made an overall beautiful delicious cake.

I wasted a day and ingredients making this cake.  If I could give it no stars I would.  I made it exactly as the recipe and directions called for.  When done it was about 1/2" high if that, dense, greasy and not fluffy like an Italian Cream Cake is supposed to be.  I thought maybe my ingredients were old so I went to the store and bought new Baking Powder, new Baking Soda and even new Flour and made it a second time.  Same results.  Then I read H. Jones review, made it a third time following her directions and this worked.  Not as good as I've had before but at least it was edible.  thank you H. Jones for your Solution.  I had promised my neighbors I would bring Italian Cream Cake for dessert so I was persistent in getting something I could bring.

I think the recipe should state that when you add the baking soda to the buttermilk, it will GROW!  I wondered if I over-whisked it?!  (Maybe that's why they SUNK?) The video states to fold the buttermilk mixture in the end, but the recipe states to add it in Step 2.  I made this recipe for cupcakes & it makes 30 cupcakes.  Also, I didn't add the cream in the end because I piped the icing.  They tasted great, but, still wonder why they SUNK?!?

Great recipe!
  I toasted the walnuts and sprinkled them on top of the icing of one of the layers instead of adding them into the icing.  And I sprinkled the top with toasted coconut for decoration.  Great flavor, moist and all around good cake.

It's an interesting cake. It's almost as heavy as pound cake. It might be better as a bundt cake, but it is in NO way an Italian cake.  Also, whatever you want to call this cake, you might want to toast my coconut before adding to the mix of the cake or the cream fillings.

I used the ingredient ratio but prepared the batter differently and with organic ingredients.  I separated the eggs as in traditional Italian cream cake style. I alternated the buttermilk and flour.  I mixed in pecans and unsweetened coconut. I whipped egg whites to stiffs peaks and gently folded them into the batter. This was a delicious moist and fluffy cake!  Fluff comes from the beaten egg whites. Wonderful ratios though! Ty

This was the best cake I ever made. I used almonds instead of walnuts. Also half butter Crisci and other half real butter for shortening. Toasted sliced almonds and put them on top and sides of frosted cake. Ground almonds and lots of almond extract in batter. This cake was a hit!!!

The only changes I made was grinding down the pecans smaller. I have made it twice. Friends and family raved about it.  Yes, I would definitely make it again.

It was a very tasty cake.  As some have said, I separated the yolks and whites from the eggs and folded in the whites at the very end.  I also substituted the baking powder with the salt.  I think I will use the powder the next time to see what the difference it would make.  I did add 1 tsp of butter flavoring as well as the vanilla.  Made a scrumptious difference!  It was dense and a little dry.  Does anyone know how to make it moist?  Applesauce or veg. Oil perhaps.  I made the frosting, toasted the coconut, and used pecans.  After frosting the cake, I added the coconut and the nuts on top.  This will rate a lot of stars if I can find a way to moisten it up.  Btw, the coconut and ground pecans are in the cake also.  Mmm.....  it doesn't make 3 cakes, but works well with 2 cakes.

I changed the recipe, but by accident! I looked at the wrong recipe (frosting vs. cake) and I immediately freaked out because I  had left the cream cheese out of the cake (it's supposed to go into the frosting!). After a lot of anger at myself, I had to go to the store to get more cream cheese. My wife suggested I just bail and cut my losses but I wanted to see it through. So I completed the recipe, put it all together (I did leave 1 cup of confectioner's sugar out--thought it was sweet enough). It looked good, we packed the car and headed to our son's house and after spaghetti, meatballs, and garlic bread, cut into the Italian Cream cake. Everyone loved it and thought the mistake enhanced the cake.  Be daring and put some cream cheese in the cake batter, I think you'll love it!

I did make one change - I used Wilton 4 layer cake pans. I had NO problem making the batter stretch to fit the four layer pans. I did line the pans with parchment paper.
I also separated the egg yolks from the whites and whipped them up separately and added them last. 
I also lowered the oven temperature - and this is because my oven does bake hotter - not because of any other reviews. 
I have to wait until Christmas Eve to actually try this cake - but meanwhile I can tell you that my frosting DID make enough to cover four layers and all the side of the cake - even with four layers. 
The cake rose nicely - if anything it rose a little more than I needed!
I'll update later with the taste - but when I trimmed the edges to fit the cake plate for frosting - it tasted delicious and the frosting was very good! I did add just a little more half and half - I had no cream on hand.

I've always struggled and been envious of the ones who could make this cake.  I found this recipe and followed it precisely and whaddya know... it clicked for me.  My family ate the entire cake and now I have siblings asking me to make another one.. I won't give them my source, I'll make them hunt for it.  Until then I'm hoarding this lil secret weapon in the war of culinary siblings.  Score one for me!

I've never had Italian Cream cake before and a customer of mine ordered one.  I primarily make bundt cakes and this customer wanted a layer cake, so I pulled a recipe for an Italian Creme Bundt cake and this one.  I made the bundt cake recipe which called for Olive Oil instead of shortening which, to me, made more sense (it's an Italian cream cake, right?) I made this one and it didn't come our nearly as good as the bundt cake recipe. So, in my opinion, I would replace the shortening with olive oil, and do what HJONES999 suggested and separate the eggs and fold in the whipped egg whites last. I would also suggest adding 1 cup of chopped walnut and 1/2 cup of coconut flakes into the batter and not in the frosting.

Made this for Fathers Day as I have someone who loves Italian Cream Cake. Followed the change-ups suggested by HJONES999 and omitted the coconut(have someone who is allergic). The cake turned out great and was 95% gone that night.

This cake was easy to make and is tasting better after sitting overnight in the refrigerator.   I followed the recipe, except for separating the eggs and mixing the yolks in the early step with the butter and shortening, then whipping the whites and folding them in at the very end.   The cake texture is really nice, but lacks a bit in flavor.   I think either more vanilla or a little almond extract next time will give it a boost.    Delicious frosting, which could also be fun with some almond extract.   Wasn't enough frosting to fully frost 3 layers.   I was only able to do between the layers and on top.  Had to leave the sides bare, which was fine for me.

I made this cake for the first time yesterday, and it was surprisingly easy to make. I used three tin foil cake pans that I bought from the grocery store. I made the cake exactly as is and it turned out delicious, and moist. I looked at some reviews that suggested to double the frosting, however, instead of using 8 cups of confectioners sugar I only used 6 cups. Coupled with the sweetened coconut flakes, I figured it was sweet enough, and it turned out really yummy. I also sprinkled the chopped walnuts on top of the cake layers instead of mixing it in with the frosting. I will absolutely make this cake again!

This cake is delicious!!! My husband loved it! I tend to like whipped frosting better than buttercream because it's less sweet. This frosting is super sweet but the cake was fantastic! We also love coconut. Definitely worth it!

I haven't tasted the recipe yet but the way the recipe is put together is very confusing.  Also the recipe doesn't match the picture I just realized I didn't get the nuts in the cake maybe that's a miss in the instructions honestly don't know what's frosting and what's cake in the list of ingredients.

I made this with the changes suggested by HJONES999, with the exception of the salt instead of baking soda. Even after folding the whipped egg whites into the batter, it still didn't seem like enough to fill three 9 inch pans, so I only used two. It rose quite a lot and filled up the pans nicely. I baked at 325 for around 37 mins. The cake came out soft, moist, and delicious. The frosting was really good as well. I mixed the coconut into the frosting and sprinkled the walnuts on top. Thank you!

This is my first review on Allrecipes. I have used this recipe for years now and it is AMAZING! I don't care whether it's authentic Italian Cream cake or not.

Thanks so much Rory for my all time favorite cake.

Add 1/2 tsp salt to cake batter. Be sure and whip egg whites separately and fold in at the end. Maybe add nuts to cake batter as well as on frosting. It really sticks to pan so grease and flour pan and use waxed paper or liner as well. Only bake 20-25 min if using 3 9" pans on convection ( to keep tops flat).

Everybody loved this cake!  I made it last Saturday to bring to a friend's house who was hosting an Italian themed dinner party.  I made the recipe exactly as shown except I doubled the frosting recipe (and used most but not all of it).  It was a huge success!  Everybody kept raving about it and asked for the recipe.  I did not think it was too dense.  It was light, airy and delicious.  I will definitely make this cake again.

I made this recipe almost as it was written and it was AMAZING!!  I used a full cup of butter instead of the 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening.  It has even been requested that I make it again, only a week later.  
I did double the icing, as a few folks commented it was necessary, and ended up with enough leftover icing for another cake.  
Wonderful recipe, thank you!!

Made cake as stated I thought it came out good a little on the sweet side so I will lower the sugar on the frosting, the only thing I am still confused about is must it remain refrigerated or can I leave it out .

The flavor was great. Getting the cakes out of the pan in one piece was difficult. Even with parchment paper and greasing the sides of the pan the cakes came out in pieces. Will try it again and follow some of the other reviewer's suggestions.

Everyone loved it at dinner last night.  I too also made the adjustments as HJONES999  suggested.  For the frosting I doubled the recipe but only used a total of 3.5 cups of confectioners sugar and only 2tbls of light cream.  Turned out perfectly sweet for us.  This is definitely a keeper and one that I will make again.

I liked this cake overall, but it wasn't as moist as I had hoped.  I followed the directions separating the eggs, omitting the baking powder, and adding salt.  The icing was outstanding.  It saved the cake.

For the last three years I make this cake for my husband every Christmas.  He loves it so much that I have to make an additional one for the kids and our guest. The only change I make to this recipe is that I grind 1/2 cup of black walnuts and add it to the batter.  I usually make my own cream cheese icing rather than use the one with the recipe.

This is AWESOME!!!  My family loves it!  The only changes I make, which I think make it better is to use almond extract instead of vanilla.  And then I mix in chopped slivered almonds to the frosting!  yum!

There are no words for how moist and delicious this cake was. I made a few changes, I didnt add coconut to the batter(just on top of each layer). I added pecan to the batter and walnuts on top. I also used butter flavored shortening, butter & coconut flavorings.
THE BEST SCRATCH YELLOW CAKE I HAVE MADE SO FAR (AND THATS SAYING ALOT FOR ME).

The cake tasted great, but I had to make a couple of changes. I added 1 cup of chopped walnuts INSIDE the batter, and the icing needed more poweder sugar.  Then I added 1 cup of whole walnuts as decoration to the top of the cake.

AMAZING!!!!!  I used 100% seedless raspberry fruit spread for the filling and it so sets off the wonderful flavor of this cake! I didn't use the walnuts or coconut in the frosting and it was amazing too!  THANK YOU for posting this wonderful recipe!  The previous reviewer is right, this cake is even more incredible the next day!

I made the recipe exactly as printed for my husbands' birthday, except I left the coconut and walnuts out - he doesn't like either one but he loves cream cheese frosting.  It was really good that evening - everyone loved it. But the best was yet to come - the next morning as I was preparing his lunch for work, he requested a piece of cake in his lunch :0 After this wonderful cake sat in the fridge all night it fit it's name - "Incredibly Delicious" !!  The cream cheese frosting firmed up perfectly and it sliced beautifully and it was REALLY good cold!  Thank you so much for sharing!

I've made a lot of cakes from scratch and so many have been a disappointment.  Often too dry or tasteless.  This is a great cake. Moist and very flavorful.

The icing should receive six stars; however, the cake was average.  It was not what I expected for Italian Cream. I was looking for the bakery type cake and this just did not do it for me.  I am leaving it in my recipe collection, though.  I intend on trying it again with better results next time.  I first used this recipe in 2004.  FYI-do not double the icing.  The recipe will produce more than enough!

I made this last night for my husband's birthday party and I was a little nervous trying a new recipe a couple of hours before a big party but it was incredible!!!  I used a couple of 8" round Wilton pans (one deep, one normal) and I sprayed them heavily with Pam Baking spray to avoid the sticking other reviewers mentioned.  Other than that I didn't stray from the cake recipe.  It was moist and fluffy and they dropped right out of the pans perfectly.  I doubled the frosting recipe and it was the best frosting I've ever eaten!!!  The cake looked beautiful and after I let it all set in the fridge for about an hour it was perfect for serving.  There wasn't a piece left!!!

I will give this four stars because I changed the recipe and will admit that I could have made a mistake.  I made this twice in one day.  The first resulted in two flat layers.  The second attempt, I added extra flour.  I made it the way I make pound cake which turned out better.  
I change the recipe by using all butter, sour cream instead of buttermilk, and double the cream cheese in the frosting.  I was a tad disappointed but the flavor was good and it was pretty in the end.

This cake is moist and decadently rich.  It is for those occasions in which you aren't concerned about fat grams or calories...you just want something that thrills your taste buds!  This REALLY impresses company and family alike.  I have used this for many "wedding" cakes with much success and praise!!!

Oh. My. God.  This was absolute heaven! I have been wanting to make this for so long, but have put it off because my husband claims he doesn't like coconut.  So I made this for my mom, who is a coconut freak.  Long story short, EVERYONE LOVED THIS ONE - even my so-called coconut hating husband!  My two-year-old could not stop eating this one, and I'm sorry to say that I couldn't stop either!  Unbelievable.  Thanks a million for this one!

What a great cake!  I left out the walnuts because it was just too weird for me.  The cake was moist and the cream cheese frosting amazing on it.  I practically ate the entire cake!  It's a dense moist cake that freezes well too.  It's not a real Italian cream cake like the kind I used to get for my BD's from the Italian Bakery. Those cakes were made of milk sponge soaked in rum with vanilla and chocolate custard filling.  This makes a great BD cake too!  Mmm...

This is a very good cake. I made a few changes not with the ingredients, but more of the technique. It is better the next day, but this is NOT an authentic Italian Cream Cake. I'm still searching for the real thing. Too bad All Recipes doesn't have anything close to the "real" thing.

Cake was very good--dense and moist.  However, we found the frosting too sweet for our tastes.  Will try again, but will look for a different frosting.

Delicious! A big hit, everyone loved it. I would use a little less coconut next time. I'm not a big fan of it to begin with and I think it made it a bit too sweet, but otherwise, perfect.

Thank you Rory!  This is one of my favorite cakes, it is absolutely scrumptious.  I think most cakes taste better the day after they are made.

The frosting is what makes this cake!  Delicious!  The cake was very dense and heavy.  I was not overly impressed with the cake.  The flavor was okay but the texture was not what I wanted.  I may try again and add coconut extract to the batter.  It may have turned out the way it did because of my oven - burned the top and left the bottom barely cooked.

WAY too sweet. Cake wasn't particularly moist. I toasted both the nuts & the coconut for the frosting and put some in the frosting and pressed nuts into side withh toasted cocoanut on top as suggested here. Not worth the effort for a scratch cake.

I agree with other reviewers that this cake tastes better as it ages.  When I first tasted it after just icing it it was so bland and oily that I was disappointed because I had wanted to try this recipe for a long time.  However after it had sat overnight it tasted much better even though it still seemed to be missing something. I could not even taste the coconut or butter and I had even added a cup of chopped nuts (almonds and pecans) but I could not taste them either.  I loved the icing though and I am not even a big fan of cream cheese icing. But next time I will not mix the nuts into the icing but press some sliced almonds onto the outside of the cake.  I will also use fresh coconut, coconut flavoring, and sour cream instead of buttermilk in the cake . Hopefully this will perk up the flavor.

I made this for my boyfriend's Italian mother, and she complimented it as the "best cake." My boyfriend kept stalling on trying it because of the coconut, but he finally did and raved about how good it was! Great recipe!

Wow!  What a success!  I made this (in mass) for a spaghetti dinner fundraiser.  It definitely stole the show.  Since I had to feed so many people, I made it in three jelly roll pans, rather than 9 inch rounds.  (A double recipe fills three jelly rolls.)  One difficulty, though, was getting it out of the pan!  After several messy attempts (I made it nine times in one day!), I decided it was easiest to cut the cake in sections, remove one section at a time, and reassemble it.  Once I frosted it, no one could tell--not even me--that it had fell apart.  Thanks for a such a wonderful recipe.

Cake was dense and delicious. You couldn't tell there was coconut in the batter. The white frosting was interesting with coconut and walnuts but hard to cover the cake, and very sweet for my family. I also tried cake with a chocolate cream cheese frosting. That was less sweet and the two flavors and textures complemented each other.

Cake was delicious, but started falling apart when I took it from the baking pan.  However, I only greased then pan.  Perhaps if I had floured it as well, I would have had better luck?  Overall, a very yummy and worthwhile cake.  Everyone who tried it said it was delicious.

I tend to make a hot milk cake with coconut icing for special occasions, but decided to make my close friend at work be a 'guinea pig' when I made this cake for her birthday....it IS SUMPTUOUS! I admit it's the first time I've ever eaten uncooked batter....and we fought over who would get the icing spatula !

This cake got mixed reviews in my family. Some people LOVED it. I didn't really like the cake, it was a bit dry and flavorless next to the icing, I would cut down the baking time some. But it was a breeze to put together and I LOVED the icing.

Wow!  This was soooo good!  I made this for a class of eight-graders, but they didn't touch it on a long buffet line of desserts and breads.  Their loss! This cake is amazing.  I was glad to be able to bring back the whole cake-more for my family!  So fattening but SO good! This rich cake is worth ever calorie.

Took it to work and everyone loved it--even those who weren't coconut fans.  Watch the timing--I only needed to bake my layers for 20 minutes.  And next time I think I'll add some salt to the recipe.

The best! This cake is awesome. The cake is so good that it doesn't even need frosting. It tastes as great as it looks. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.
