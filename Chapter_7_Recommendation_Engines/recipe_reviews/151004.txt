This recipe is fabulous!  Another reviewer had made a comment about there not being enough of a banana taste to it, so I substituted one banana cream pudding and one french vanilla, instead of the two vanilla puddings.  It turned out wonderfully!  I topped it with whipped cream and chocolate shavings and it looked as good as it tasted!

Everyone really liked this pie, but the chocolate layer hardened way more than I anticipated.  It made it kinda difficult to cut into.  I used 2 small bananas just to cover the bottom layer.  I wish I had of added more though.  Overall, a very easy and yummy pie.

My entire family loved this pie, couldn't taste the banana as much as I would have liked, however delicious. Next time I'll add two bananas. This is a definite keeper!!

Excellent pie!! I did use one box of banana cream pudding and one vanilla as advised. The only mistake I made was not making two because it really went fast.

WOW was this good! Banana cream pie is my favorite dessert, and now this pie is the favorite dessert of everyone I made it for, including 3 kids. I used all lower-fat ingredients: light pie crust, fat free, sugar free pudding, skim milk, and light cool whip. I also added some chocolate shavings to the top...I have a feeling I'll be getting frequent requests for this one!
