Hubs and I were thinking of what we could have for a refreshing drink after doing some yard work. He mentioned an Arnold Palmer, which I had never heard of. He said golfers drink it. So, I looked it up on AR and sure enough, there it was! I made it using "Smooth Sweet Tea" and "Best Lemonade Ever," recipes also from this site. This was really good!  Light, refreshing and thirst quenching - no wonder it's so popular with golfers. Hubs said this tastes just like the stuff you get at the clubhouse!

An Arnold Palmer formula is very custom made depending on the tastes of the maker.  Some like more lemonade, some like more iced tea some like a lighter taste (more water) on either the tea or lemon.  Ideally an Arnold Palmer is a part tea and part lemonade.  I used green tea and old fashioned lemonade.  You can use any tea, pink or regular lemonade, home made or artificial.  THANKS

my son introduced me to this drink over Memorial day.  I love the taste--am going to look for the Hibiscus TAO tea.  This is very refreshing.

I made this with Orange Zinger tea and lemonade from concentrate. I served it with lemon juice ice cubes to up the lemon flavor. Good!

I have some unsweet tea I made of green tea with a little rasberry and black tea mixed. I made some lemonade out of fresh lemon juice, water, and Truvia. I thought it tasted exactly like the Arnold Palmer drinks from a can. The 50/50 ratio seems to be perfect as I have tried others. I tasted it because it is one of my brothers most purchased drinks. I will have to make it for him when he visits. Although, I don't care to much for the Arnold Palmer drink, what matters is it taste just like what my brother loves. Thanks

No decent version of an Arnold Palmer is bad! That said, Arnold himself suggests about 25-30% lemonade to 70-75% iced tea, There is a great 30 for 30 Film Short on the history of the Arnold Palmer.

I can't fairly give it a 5 because I changed the formula.  I taste-tested the 50-50 and I found it too sweet so followed closer to Arnold's original recipe of 70% iced tea and 30% lemonade...I made it 75% iced tea (Arizona Sweet Tea) and 25% lemonade (bottled Minute Maid).  It was the perfect mix for my (and hubby's) taste so that's what I'll be using for a neighborhood party this weekend.
