FABULOUS! I loved that it was not too sweet. Everyone does the red wine and juice. This one was different. I needed to bring something to a party that started with a S and this was perfect. Thank you

Loved this! I had white wine drinkers for brunch so tried it....Very simple recipe. The gin is a great touch btw.... it does sneak up on you. I added a bit more OJ , (actually by accident) but my guests didn't mind.  I will surely make this again. Served it with Flank steak fajitas and brown rice and black beans from this website. A great meal.

Very yummy! Everyone loved it!  We tried it with two different wines - a chardonnay and a sweeter one. The oak taste of the chardonnay was a bit overpowering, so would use a wine made in a metal tank, as opposed to a wood barrel.

great! the only thing i didnt have was the pomegranite seeds. didnt have time to soak fruits overnight, just for a few hours. tasted somewhat like sparkling grapefruit punch. a "dry" cocktail for those who don't like it sugary sweet. took it to a barbecue on a hot day. it was perfectly refreshing. not everyone liked it but those of us who did absolutely loved it. This one is one of my faves.

Made this last summer for my dear SO who drinks gin. Be careful it is yummy and yes, DANGEROUS! Lovely thirst quencher on a hot day. Making it for father's day treat this year. We called it White Lightening Sangria all summer after the one episode...Easy substitutions didn't hurt the recipe, or at least I didn't think so..I couldn't find frozen cranberry (who knows why?) But looked several places, so I used cran juice in place of the orange juice and frzn orange in place of the cran. Worked great. No pomegranate seeds so added in POM juice...Can't wait till Sunday!

This was ok. I'd probably think about making it again but next time would go easy on the lime slices. It initially had a grapefruity taste but I sweetened it with a bit of sugar and some 7UP. Didn't have tonic water or pomegrante. It does surely sneak up on you too! I think serving it with lots of ice helped calm down the initial bitey taste. Overall, with some tweeking, this could be a good party drink.
