This was a wonderful recipe!! I made it for a father's day dinner, and everyone absolutely loved it. The lemon-chive butter complimented the succulent sweet flavor of the lobster to a T. I made it with large lobster tail rather than the whole lobster (all I could find in my area), and it was delicious. I made the butter the day before to cut down on prep time, and seasoned the stuffed lobster with fresh ground pepper. You guys MUST try this recipe!
