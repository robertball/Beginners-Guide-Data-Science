I was a little surprised at the texture of my finished product for these cupcakes--I thought they'd be creamier than they turned out to be.  When they were done baking, they were standing up way above the liners and I wondered how I was going to put the sour cream topping on them, but they calmed down and made a perfect little dent for me to fill them (were mine not done enough?).  I was able to put two teaspoons of the sour cream onto each of the cupcakes using the ingredients called for.  I think I would cut the eggs to 4 and add more vanilla to the mix.  I liked that these came out gluten free for some of the people I was serving.  Thanks, Poppy127!

Mom has made these since I was a girl and they would DISAPPEAR at parties. One fun element missing here is the cookie in the bottom as a "crust" -- Mom always put one vanilla wafer, or you can use an Oreo. These sink on top as they cool and don't look very pretty so we always topped them with a bit of jam or pie filling or a bit of fruit.

I wanted a creamy, thick texture so I followed the previous suggestion of using 4 eggs instead of 5 eggs. The cheesecake cupcakes came out fabulously. I also placed a vanilla wafer at the bottom of the cupcake wrapper to work as a crust.

Love them. Only change- I would not fill them to an 1/8 of an inch from the top. This is too full. They look prettier if the are lower. They rise like mini souffles. I topped them with glazed raspberries. They were a hit at my party.

My hubby, who loves pastries but not if they are very sweet, called these "spectacularly good."  Several times.  I doubled the recipe for a big event but the only change I made was to substitute almond flavoring for the vanilla, as I do love almond and cherry together.  I live in Guatemala and most everyone loves cheesecake, but what is normally available here isn't all that great, in my opinion.  Should be fun to see how these little babies are received tomorrow.   ****Update:  Wow!!  I brought home a few crumbs, and requests for more in the future.  Don't hesitate to make these if you want an elegant and special dessert.  You will not regret them.
