These are the most addictive cookies.  I have made them several times now.  I like my shortbread to be on the softer side so instead of making them flat, I used a small ice cream scoop and left them in that shape.  Not only do they stay in the cute shape of a scoop of ice cream, they a soft and slightly chewy. (see my photo)  You do have to cook them slighty longer to get them to brown a little.  The first time I made these I used bar chocolate and chopped it into pieces.  This last time I used white chocolate chips and it was much easier and less of a mess.  I will make these again and again.

This is a great, easy recipe. It is 5 stars as is but try it with a 12 ounce bag of white chocolate chips and a 6 ounce bag of tart cherries. The white chocolate chips are easier and the whole bag is a plus. The tart cherries have a better texture and flavor in my opinion than the cranberries.

Wow! Soooo yummy!  I did bake them for about 20 min for them to brown a little more, very good! Definitely will be making them again and will be trying different mix-in's. Super simple recipe. I think you could even make these without the choco & cranberries just for a shortbread.  Will have to try that! Happy baking everyone!

I tried it without white chocolate (not having any immediately available at home) and added a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon. Came out great. Had to leave it cooking for maybe a minute longer than expected but that might just be my oven

I made these for a cookie swap (made 12 dozen)!  The only change I made was using white chocolate chips as several other mentioned.   I chilled the dough for a few hours before baking - formed the dough into several rectangular shaped "logs" and put them in plastic wrap in the refridgerator.  This made them easier to cut into more uniform size/shape since I was making them for a holiday cookie . Since mine were smaller (flat) I only had to bake them for 9-10 minutes.  The white chocolate and cranberry combo is a favorite of mine and is perfect for the holidays!  Great and simple recipe - fail proof.

These are my new "go to" favorites...although I used white chocolate chips.  I made them, last year, for a cookie exchange, and everyone loved them.  They're so easy to whip up and the colors are traditionally festive.

I actually got this recipe from a friend - have always loved them at her annual Christmas party but never had the recipe.  These are simply delicious - I made 3 batches for the holidays and plan to make some more this winter.  You can substitute any type of chocolate chip and any dried fruit to change up the cookies.  This is one of my favorite cookie recipes!

These were delicious!! Everyone loved them. Instead of baker's white chocolate, I just used white chocolate chips and sliced each one in half. Wasn't too much effort, and I thought the smaller white chocolate pieces would be better in a dry dough like this. Turned out great!!

These cookies are great.  They have a nice buttery flavor.  I also use white chocolate chips and that makes it easier.  I make these for a cookie swap and they are requested every year.

These cookies are DELICIOUS. If you like a sweeter cookie, try making them with dried cherries instead of cranberries (I like them both ways). Also, I use half salted and half unsalted butter.  Be sure to bake only until LIGHT golden brown if you want tender, melt-in-your-mouth shortbreads.

I, too, used the bag of white chocolate chips.  I made these cookies the same time as several other cookie recipes.  Because they didn't have the pizazz to the eye comparatively, I didn't try them for several days.  When I finally tried them, I ignored all the other cookies.  These were fantastic.  I will definately make them again and again.  Thank you for the recipe, it's now in my book of favorites.       Makes  5  dozen cookies

I always use the white chocolate chips and craisins when making this recipe. It's a constant hit anytime I make them to pass out at work. Mine never brown like the picture here, but overcooking makes them very dry. I pull them out at 12-14 minutes and let them cool and they are always perfect.

These aren't the most fabulous shortbread cookies I've ever tasted, but they're probably the best I've ever made personally!  I used dark chocolate chips instead of white chocolate and they're SOOOO tasty! :)  Not too crumbly either, which is a pleasant surprise.

The white chocolate really enhances the flavour of the buttery shortbread and the cranberries add a great flavour and texture.  These will be a Christmas cookie staple in our house.  One review said they were dry but shortbread are supposed to be dry!  Mine turned out to have a typical shortbread texture on the outside but a little bit buttery and moist on the inside.  They are soooo addictive.  Love 'em!

These were a HUGE hit!  So easy, very light and buttery.  I made 1 batch as written and 1 batch minus the chocolate and dried cranberry....I actually think I prefer the plain ones more!

This was my first time making a shortbread type cookie.  The recipe was very easy to follow. The cookies turned out great. They taste better once they have completely cooled.

Didn't have enough flour, so we substituted wheat flour to make up the difference. Delicious! Didn't miss the white flour. I just don't know if I would use all wheat flour next time.

I am always asked to make these for birthdays, events, holidays... and just anytime! they are simple but tasty. The tartness of the cranberries with the sweetness of the white chocolate are completely complementary.. and the butteriness of the shortbread makes these cookies addicting... esp. with a cup of coffee!
