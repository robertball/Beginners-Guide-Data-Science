Yuck! these cookies were horrible.  The cinnamon and cornflakes are gross together.  I would not recommend this to my worst enemy.  (well... maybe I would.)

I'm glad I ignored the prior reviews, I really liked these cookies.  I did substitute oat flakes cereal for the cornflakes.  The cereal was also a cinnamon flavor with raisins, but the recipe gets a big thumbs up from me.

The cornflakes kept getting stuck in my teeth when I ate them.  They would be great without any cornflakes or with a whole lot more.
