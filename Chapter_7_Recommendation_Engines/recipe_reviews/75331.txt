This is my favorite zucchini bread.  I make it with veggie or canola oil since I rarely have walnut oil.  It is high in protein and very moist.

Wow!  Let me tell you, my DH saw me making this and was very skeptical.  He was really thrown by the tofu and flax.  :)  I told him he wouldn't even notice it, but was a little nervous myself.  It turned out awesome!  I left out the walnuts b/c I don't like them.  And I didn't have walnut oil so I used half canola oil and half applesauce.

This is the best Zucchini Bread ever.  My 5 year old loves it and it is great for him.  It is ultra moist and no substitutions are necessary.  I have made this with walnut oil and I have also substituted the walnut oil with applesauce. Yum yum.

My son is 15 months old and is a VERY picky eater, he loves this bread. I didn't add walnuts and I substituted pear juice for pineapple. I also used veggie oil instead of almond oil.

I had high hopes for this recipe and was very disappointed when it didn't turn out.  I baked 1 loaf and 12 muffins and had to increase the bake time considerably before either was done.  Both the loaf and the muffins were very gummy in texture which made me think perhaps 3 eggs plus 1/2c flax was too much for the flour to handle?  Whatever the reason, my search for a healthful, flavorful zucchini bread continues.
