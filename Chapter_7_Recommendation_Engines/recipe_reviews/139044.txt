I think there was an  error in the measurement for the garlic salt, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.  Very quick and simple to make.  I reduced amount of garlic salt and it had a great flavor.  Especially the  fresh black pepper with the pork.

This was good. The salt needs to be reduced, per other people's reviews I did so. I also added a little bit of cumin. I'd make this again!

This was excellent.  I did not add any salt and added more oil when frying the pork.

Nice for a change and to use up some pork chops I had laying around.  Added avocado and onions and heated up the tortillas.  Tasted fresh and satisfying but not sure it will go on my regular rotation.

Loved the receipe. You can pretty much tinker with the receipe without spoiling it. I used mango peach salsa and low fat Lucerne shredded cheddar.

A quick and easy dinner item to prepare.  I used waaaaaay less salt than the recipe calls for.  In fact, I just sprinkled on all three of the dry ingredients.  Served it with 'Caramelized Onions and Potatoes' a personal recipe from AR.
