I used olive oil instead of butter, and added half an onion chopped and an Anaheim pepper, chopped. I substituted orzo for the crushed vermicelli. Sauteed it all for about ten minutes, then added the room temp broth and brought the whole thing to a boil. This will definitely be a regular menu item at my house.
