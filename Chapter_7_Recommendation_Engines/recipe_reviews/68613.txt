One of the easiest & most delicious burger recipes I've had in a long time. I also recommend adding Worcestershire sauce as well.

Delicious!  I added some worcestershire sauce and some bread crumbs and these burgers came out perfectly.  Will definitely fix again.

Delicious! Hubby raved about this burger. I followed the recipe as directed, but did take reviewers' recommendations and added a TBS of Worcestershire sauce. I used two cloves of fresh garlic and I think that made all the difference. I agree that the egg may not be necessary, and will try it w/o next time....and there will be a next time!

Pretty good. I left out the egg, just like my hamburgers like good ole burgers; I added some liquid smoke to give it a smoked flavor.

These hamburgers are great!!  I was searching for a good burger recipe because my kids will eat fast food burgers but not ones I'd cook at home!  (very frustrating!)  They both will eat these burgers, the only thing I do differently is garlic powder instead of minced.

I thought these were great! I used 2 lbs. of meat, 3TBS. of good quality steak sauce, 1 teas. of crushed garlic, 2 TBS. of Worstchesire, S&P, and 2 eggs. Mixed well with hands. Grilled on the grill and served on toasted rolls with lettuce, tomato,red onion, mayonaise and crumbled blue cheese. Terrific!

Very good burgers. We left out the egg - didn't find it necessary, added some worcestershire and used Heinz 57 vs. A1.

I liked the taste of steak sauce & onion.  But something told me not to add the egg.  I did & as expected it was the consistency of meatloaf.  I like my burger to be meaty not loafy.  Just a personal preference.

great recipe!  followed as directed except for only using the egg yolk, not the white, a tad bit more A1 sauce, and added about 1/2 tsp of Liquid Smoke.  resulted in a juicy and tasty hamburger!  will make again.

We made these last night and they were so good and juicy.  A couple changes we made were adding 1 TBSP. worcestershire sauce and for the egg, we just added the yolk and left out the egg white.  My kids didn't like the minced garlic, so I may do garlic powder next time like another reviewer did.

Mixed reviews here on these. 2 thumbs up. 1 thumbs down. My  husband doesn't really like sauces in general much less A1. It wasn't strong, but he would have preferred plain meat with S&P. I left the egg out. I cooked these stovetop, but I'm certain they would have been far tastier if we'd grilled them. Thanks, I had fun trying out a new burger!

I've made these on the grill as well as the skillet and they are really good! Love the flavor and very juicy. :) Definitely plan to use this as my hamburger recipe from now on!

I like to use the A1 Steak MARINADES instead of the steak sauce and its just as good.

These were a hit at my family's Friday night dinner! I made these twice. First I made the recipe as-is. The second time I added chopped onion and about 2 TB Worcester sauce. It's so simple and tasty.

A nice hamburger with few ingredients.  I had small hamburger buns, so we made smaller burgers.  I made the patties and then put a hole in the middle so they would not shrink and puff up while grilling.  We usually add more ingredients when making burgers, but this simple recipe had great flavor and tasted wonderful on a chilly Sunday night.  We dressed the burgers up with lettuce, tomato slices, cheese and slices of avocado.  Served these with corn on the cob and a tossed salad.

Good flavor, perfect cook time, nice and moist. I didn't have any issues with them falling apart on the grill. Maybe a little too much garlic, but I used fresh and may have misjudged how much I put in.

I liked the simplicity of these.  However, when I realized I didn't have any steak sauce, I substituted worchstershire sauce.  It was good, but I will be trying this again when I have steak sauce, 'cause that sounds even better!

Delicious hamburgers!  I omitted the egg because I don't think hamburgers need egg but also because my little one is allergic to them.  I didn't measure the garlic just crushed two medium cloves.  Used Heinz 57 for the steak sauce.  To top off the burgers I melted a good Gouda over them and spread some ranch dressing mixed with a little ketchup which added a little sweetness.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will definitely make these again!

Great idea adding the steak sauce.  My burger was very juicy and flavorful.  I didn't add the egg.  I might add mushrooms next time to enhance it a bit.  Thanks.

Fabulous burgers! I also added about 1tsp Worcestershire sauce and crumbled cheese in the mix. I noticed some reviewers left out the egg — I would not recommend doing that, the egg makes the burger a little less dense, creating a very a nice texture.

If I could give this recipe 4.5 stars I would.  I just had to make a few adjustments to it to make it perfect!  I followed the recipe and found the meat a bit bland.  I added about 1/2 tsp. onion powder and 1/2 tsp of salt and that did the trick.  I also followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added some bread crumbs.  It was a perfect pan-fried burger.

These are very tasty burgers. I used grass-fed beef which I prefer. It is a little leaner so the egg really helped make it moist. I didn't have A-I sauce so I used soy sauce instead. I made them on the stove top in a skillet and they came out great.

Outstanding! I did them in the grill and I think the A1 made the grill marks and browning better than plain burgers. Nice and moist as well. Unless you prefer the texture, I didn't find the egg necessary.

I did 3 pounds of hamburger, and added 2 eggs, 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce, a tablespoon of avocado oil, 2 tbsp of minced garlic and two tablespoons of A-1. Grilled low and slow, these were a huge hit at the bbq.

I've been looking at this recipe for awhile and finally decided to try the egg thing. We did grill ours, they held up fine on the grill but not as well as no egg. Tasted very good, but I think that was more the A1 sauce and garlic. While grilling a wee bit of salt and pepper just had to go on them. Always fun to try new burger recipes.

awesome! I did use instead of the steak sauce, Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet Vidalia Onion BBQ Sauce, came out excellent!  The minced garlic is a little repeative after a few times eating it though.

These were really delicious. I did add about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs after reading about how easily they fall apart but it didn't really help. They really did fall apart on the grill. But we scooped them up & threw them on buns & they tasted great anyhow! LOL

These were pretty good. I misread the recipe and used two tablespoons of garlic, but we love garlic so it worked out better that way. Couldn't taste the steak sauce though.

Awesome, as is. Don't have to change a thing (But I sometimes do, depending on mood.)  Salt & Pepper.  Worstershire.  Fresh herbs.  Practically perfect base recipe though.  Always turn out great!

I usually add worcestershire sauce for an additional kick.  Think I might try adding some Texas Pete for a more varied flavor the next time I make it. Hmmm....

One of my favorites.  The raw patties were super mushy and hard to work with because of the egg and steak sauce but they grilled wonderfully and tasted great.

Thank you for this recipe, was looking for a way to make burgers more tasty.  I did leave out the egg though and added some worcesterishire sauce.  They came out flavorful and juicy, did not fall apart at all.  This is now my go to recipe anytime we have burgers!

I followed the recipe exactly, and felt like the burgers were missing something. Maybe next time I will add some worcestershire sauce to add more flavor.

With adding the egg, I had to add bread crumbs, which made the burger not as good.  Next time, I'll omit the egg, because otherwise the taste of the burger was great!

I added a few things to the mix (although it would be fine on its own as written). I did as others by adding W.Sauce and breadcrumbs but I also included garlic powder rather than minced (didn't have any), some onion powder, oregano, parm cheese, black pepper and parsley flakes....not a lot of the above (personal preferance). Whats great is that you can add any seasoning you want to this recipe and it'll work.  FOR KIDS....I have a 2 yr old so I made mini-burgers, froze them individually along with dinner rolls for buns. So, in a quick fix I can pull one or two out and serve it with rice (or sweet potato fries) coupled with some veggies.

Really yummmmm!  Made just a few adjustments based upon others' suggestions.  Double burger as we like our burgers bigger than 1/4 pound.  Used ground round, 1 egg for the double batch, some worsteshire and onion powder.  They came out so good!  And so easy.

Very moist. I used worcestershire sauce so they were a little harder to keep together. Maybe next time I'll use BBQ sauce instead next time since no one in my house cares for A-1.

These were excellent! I made them for a cookout with friends. No leftovers!  The pickiest eater of the group said that it was the best burger she had ever had.  Per other suggestions, I omitted the egg and added 1 TBS worcestershire sauce and just a bit of onion powder.  Perfect!

My husband and I really enjoyed these burgers.  I love the fact that they only call for a few ingredients, which I always have on hand. Also they held together nicely on the grill.  Next time, I try a dash or two of worcestershire sauce, but very good just the way they were. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Very Good!  I did not have steak sauce, so I subbed in BBQ sauce and it was fine.  I topped the burgers with sauteed onions and cheddar cheese.  Delicous!  I will definitely make these again.

I literally can't believe this fuss  over a burger!!   Nothing to write home about.  Way more work for just another burger.  Too much unnecessary bread.in meat mixture..Eggs?  Ugh..Nothing about this was good.  But I appreciate that her family likes this.  Mine didnt.

I went to make this and realized I didn't have any steak sauce. Ended up substituting liquid smoke & Worcestershire sauce and added some Montreal steak seasoning. Absolutely delicious!

Favorite hamburgers!!!! I do add some Worcestershire sauce and Montreal steak seasoning instead of salt and pepper.
Moist! I grill on cast iron grilling skillet for 10 minutes.

Thank you for a tasty recipe!!

Really nice tasting burger considering how few ingredients it has. The secret to not having mushy burgers is to mix in the egg and then let it sit for a while. I did bake these as my barbeque is buried in snow right now.

Super easy and flavorful hamburger recipe. I wish i added more garlic but they were very moist and tasty as is. I also added a little bit of panko bread crumbs only because my hamburger seemed very moist. I made these into sliders and cooked on the grill. A huge hit with the family. The hubby eating four of them!  Thank you for an easy great tasting burger.

Absolutely delicious!  Like other reviewers I omitted the egg and added 1 TBSPN of worcester sauce, and also some salt and pepper.  This is great recipe for new chefs as it leaves a lot of room for variation.  Next time I think I'll add some grated onion.

My husband and I were looking for a recipe that made our burgers taste like a local restaurant's and this is it.  I followed some of the other reviews and didn't use the egg or garlic.  I added 1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce and approximately 1/2 tsp. liquid smoke.  Great recipe!!

This was great without the egg but adding a tsp of olive oil per pound of meat.  I also added 1 tsp of minced garlic and 1 tsp of Worcestershire.  Rubbed the grill with a raw potato and grilled for about 7 minutes on each side.  Don't forget the cheese a few minutes before removing.  Yummy

Awesome so glad I came across this recipe. I had the same problem as others my kids eat fast food burgers but won't eat mine at home. But they loved these and asked when we were having them again. I did add Worcester sauce and bread crumbs. Delicious!!!

Nice flavor!  Omitted the egg, used garlic powder and added the review recommended magic "W" sauce.  All four kids gobbled them up.  Made them into mini-sliders.  A hit without leftovers!

I make these hamburgers all the time and they are fantastic.  I usually add some crackers so they hold together a little better and change it to one tablespoon each of Worchestershire sauce and steak sauce.  Love it!

This recipe is delicious!  Using Worcestershire sauce made such a huge difference in the taste.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that to save my life, I can't keep the burgers whole.  They crumble at the slightest touch.  The first time I made the burgers, I figured it was because I put too many eggs (I used 2 eggs, for 1.5 lbs of meat).  This time I only used one, and they came out more crumbly than last time.  I'm not sure what I could possibly be doing wrong.  Next time, I'll try no eggs. Any suggestions?

I made them exactly as you wrote it.  My husband said they were the best burgers he ever had.  The egg made it moist.  I wouldn't recommend leaving it out.  Thank you!

Pretty sloppy made as suggested - i will definitely forget the egg next time.  It was moist and I liked that but needed more flavor - so will give it another try with seasoning and worchesteshire as suggested by many!!

I kicked it up a bit with some Tony's But it was very good on the Forman Grill.  Without the Tony's I found it to be a little to bland for my taste.

I followed this to the nth degree.  We ate them in various pieces.  I could not keep them together.   I did 3 balls, flattened them to about 3/4 thickness.  Did not work.  Taste was good.  Rating was just for taste.

We absolutely loved these hamburgers.  Very moist and tasty.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1 tbsp of Worcestshire and I also added a small amount of bread crumbs.  I used Ground Turkey instead of beef.  These hamburgers were delicious!

I didn't like these much.  I was wanting to try something different - but guess I really just like my burgers the old basic way - with lots of salt and pepper.

These were tasty! I think next time I'll add more Worcestershire sauce or more steak sauce for some extra flavor. Hubby and I added avocados, cheese and bacon for a little twist, but it makes a very tasty regardless of what you top it with! We'll definitely make these again.

Not bad, but not really outstanding, according to my family. I made them exactly according to the recipe, other than doubling everything because we had 4 teenagers eating with us. My daughter said she would have liked more of a sweet taste, like you get with barbecue sauce. Thanks!

I added a tablespoon or so of Worcestershire sauce. I also added some sharp cheddar cheese on top during the last couple minutes of grilling. Very moist, flavorful burger. Good recipe, but there appears to be a typo - if you cook it to 180 degrees it'd be a hockey puck! USDA recommends an internal temp of 160 for ground beef.

Yummy! Not dry at all, even when my husband overcooks them. I have made them twice so far and I do feel like they are missing something, but I don't know exactly what.  That's the reason for the 4 star rating.  I am going to try again using maybe some onion powder and/or worchestershire. Overall quick, easy, and delicious.

Great mix of ingredients. Great Burgers! I added hamburger seasoning and worcestershire sauce just because I like a lot of seasoning.

These burgers are great!  I added the Worcestershire like someone suggested.  The kids liked them without knowing what was in them.  Thanks!

Used with ground pork - used worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce, added a little ketchup, brown sugar and oatmeal also.  The more I write recipe reviews, the more I realize that I very rarely actually follow the recipe....

In any case, the boy approved of these.  :)

It was okay.  Kind of flavorless and dry.
