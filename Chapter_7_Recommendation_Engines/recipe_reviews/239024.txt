I followed the recipe exactly, but mine needed to cook 13 minutes to the cutting stage, and then, 25 minutes more.  The directions do not specify thickness, and I pressed mine out to about 3/4 inch thick.  This made a 12" circle, which is a bit large for a scone.  Next time, I will divide the dough in half to make two circles and smaller scones.  I liked the crunchy edges, and creating two smaller circles could give more crunch to the middle.  I feel that a single dough circle pressed out to a taller scone would have increased the cooking time even more.
