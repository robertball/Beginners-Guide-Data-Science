My oldest made one each for his brother and himself. My son already is a pro at making eggs in the microwave so he knew to spray his cereal bowl well with non-stick spray before cracking his egg into it. We didn't have mexican cheese blend, he used shredded sharp cheddar instead. Great "make on your own" beginning cook/kid breakfast plus this is easily adaptable to add in your own breakfast burrito favorites.

I loved this! I didn't use a microwave because ours is broken. I scrambled two eggs in a pan, put the eggs in a tortilla and topped with cheese and salsa. Simple and tasty!

Followed the directions as stated.  My review is the same as TxCin.  The egg took so long to set that the tortilla turned crisp and hard around the bowl and was soft on the bottom.  Could eat about a 1/3 of it.

We just made these.  Super easy and tasty.  This is something my preteen boys will love to make themselves for a healthy snack!  Thanks for the cool idea.

My 12-year-old daughter made this for her and her brother this morning.  I didnâ€™t taste it but they raved about how good it was.  She added a tad of salt and some pepper.  The egg needed a total of 1 min 20 seconds to cook.  Both of my children thought it was delicious.  This is an easy weekday meal that my daughter can prepare before school.

This was a cute idea and didn't dirty any dishes, but it didn't turn out well at all. I only had jumbo eggs and mine took a full minute for the egg to cook and then the tortilla was hard and stayed in the bowl shape and would not fold over. So the pic is what turned out. Ha ha sort of like a taco salad bowl only mine was a breakfast bowl. This was a cute idea but not practical and I won't make this again. Thanks anyway.

I didn't think it would be as awesome as it was.  This works great!  I agree with the other reviewer, it does stay in the shape of the bowl, but still it's just a little like a breakfast taco!  I'll make this again before work.

I had no idea you could even microwave eggs. But they come out perfect! This is such a simple idea, a huge time saver, and beats a poptart. I'll be using this recipe for a long time.
