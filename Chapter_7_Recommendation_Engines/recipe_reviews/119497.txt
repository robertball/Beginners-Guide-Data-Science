Great recipe. I didn't follow the cooking instructions though. I didn't see the point of cooking it in a microwave, so I just bake them in the oven at 400F, and cooked the sauce on the stove. I made it for a party, and everyone loved it.

These were pretty good. However, I baked the meatballs until 3/4 done then slow simmered them in the sauce. Microwaves are for heating leftovers...not cooking.

I made the sauce and used frozen meatballs to save time.  The kids loved them, the sauce is little on the sweet side, but very good.

This recipe was a huge hit at our XMAS/House Warming Party in December (I know... I'm slow on the draw to review this).   I went a little crazy and wrapped the meatballs in BACON!!!!!!  Hear me, people. Bacon makes these meatballs on par with the apple in the garden.

This was my first time trying this recipe. Fantastic! I baked the meatballs in the oven at 400 degrees, and added a few shakes of red wine vinegar to the sauce instead of using the cider vinegar. If you do decide to bake the meatballs in the oven, they do create a lot of grease (depending on how much fat is in the ground beef), so use a cookie sheet or stone with edges.

This was different, that's for sure. I doubled the meatball recipe, but kept the sauce ingredient amounts the same. I used low-carb bread and made homemade bread crumbs and added my own spices. I don't usually keep pre-made bread crumbs on hand. The sauce was REAL sweet, even when I added a little dijon mustard to cut it down a bit. The best part about this recipe was that the meatballs weren't mushy, like I've had problems with other meatball recipes. It was edible, but just not for us. NOTE: Next day, I ended up picking the meatballs out and using the sauce from Reunion Meatballs. I didn't want the meal to completely go to waste. I can't afford it.

I made this recipe this evening and it is delish! I baked them in the oven instead of using the microwave. The only thing I would change is next time I will decrease the ketchup. I took the advice of another reviewer and wrapped them in bacon before baking. I can't wait to make them for Christmas!!! This recipe is definately a keeper.

So delicious!  I served these as an appetizer on Christmas Night.  I would recommend baking them in the oven instead of in the microwave for a firmer outside and  more even bake.

Great idea, but needs serious tweaking.  I only added half the sugar, but even so it was over-the-top sickly sweet.  Meatballs were good, although I didn't cook them in the microwave and next time I would add garlic.  The sauce just needs rethinking.  With the sugar in the cranberry sauce, the sugar in the ketchup, and the additional sugar, it is more like a ground beef dessert.

Made this as written except I baked the meatballs and cooked the sauce on the stove-top... all I could tase was the ketchup!  Recipe definitely needs some tweaking.

Delicious! It was an instant hit out house. I did however bake the meatballs at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. I made the sauce on the stove and then sauteed the meatballs in the sauce.

these were good, but i was not wild about the sauce. It was too vinegary for my taste. I'd half the vinegar next time. However, my husband who likes tart and vinegary things thought they were excellent!

Just used the recipe for the sauce, not the meatballs, but it was excellent and very popular with our Christmas guests!

I used frozen meatballs in a crockpot and omitted ketchup, brown sugar, and onion. We had it over rice and it was delicious.Thanks.
