I have made many recipes from this site and never rated any before, but this one I must comment on.  Absolutely delicious!  So quick and easy, it's hard to believe it tastes so good -- and healthy too!  I doubled  the amount of balsamic, but not the brown sugar, and served it over yellow rice.  This will be a regular in our house!

Excellent!!!! I was skeptical at first about the amount of balsamic vinegar called for this dish. Then, after I read a few reviewers and some people said that they doubled the sauce, I decided to give it a try. I browned the chicken first and set aside, then sautéed the onions, garlic and vegetables (I only had green/red bell peppers and onions on hand), then all other ingredients along with ½ cup of chicken broth and added everything in my crockpot for a couple of hours. Served over Basmati brown rice.

Everyone enjoyed it (all adults). The only changes I made were: using boneless thighs (3 per person; thighs are tastier & moister), adding a couple of teaspoons of balsamic vinegar to the chicken as it was frying, as it looked anemic) & doubling the sauce (we all love sauce, next time I will triple it). Served it with basmati rice & green olive with chives baguette (sopped up the jus - no butter necessary). Will make it again soon.

I really liked this recipe.  The only reason I didn't give it a five-star is because I feel the chicken breast should be marinated in balsamic vinegar for at least 4 hours if not preferably overnight.  By doing this the chicken would be more tender and moist.  Besides having more flavor.

Wow this truly is an AMAZING dish! I absolutely loved it. Don't skimp on the garlic part; I believe that's what makes this recipe. Make it exactly as described and it will be great. I steamed the asparagus in my steamer instead of sauteing, then mixed it in. That's personal preference though, it lessens the time to cook the peppers as my wok was already full. Easy, healthy, and I will definitely be eating again. Thanks for sharing!

This was so tasty! I think I over-caramelized the balsamic, because it's suuper sticky, but I'll do it less next time.

I made this recipe when I wanted to try cooking asparagus for the first time. The dish is ABSOLUTELY delicious and very easy to make. I'm living in Japan and familiar ingredients can be hard to come by. This is a simple and tasty winner... I'll definitely make it again!

Have made this multiple times. Excellent. I triple the balsamic and brown sugar to make extra sauce. You will have to cook it longer though for it to reduce. I serve jasmine rice with it.

What a great healthy meal. The balsamic gives this dish such a nice flavor. I cut the chicken and vegis into bite sized pieces and cooked in a wok. Served with rice.

Last night I was browsing the AllRecipes site for a healthy chicken recipe simply to use up some extra veggies I had on hand, and also because I didn't want to stop at the store. So I came upon this recipe.  My husband and I love balsamic vinegar, so I figured this recipe would be "okay" and would at least fill our hungry bellies.  Was I ever wrong...  OMG - instead of "okay" it was wonderful. A real keeper! I didn't change anything about the recipe, EXCEPT that I used up the vegetables that I had on hand.  As I didn't have asparagus or a green pepper at home, I didn't use those.  I used one orange pepper, one red pepper and one yellow pepper.  I had fresh mushroom to use up, so I sliced up about a cup and a half of mushrooms and used those.  I also didn't have a red onion, but I had a large vidalia, so that sucker went into the veggie saute as well.  Oh, and since we love balsamic, I did double the sauce since I'd read other reviews that did the same.  Good thing I did -- my husband was dipping his bread into the leftover sauce, it's sooooooo good.  Funny, I came upon this recipe in an effort to simply "use up" extra peppers and mushrooms, and discovered a recipe that we will definitely be enjoying time and again in the future.  Thanks MellyBelly (and your Aunt Jules)!!!  :o)

Wow, what a great sauce!  I was hesitant at first about this combination of veggies. but DH and HS ate all of their meal!  It is a very colorful dish, and I think of it as chicken over a cooked salad (sometimes I get REAL tired of lettuce!).  Using the balsamic vinegar separately as a sauce/type glaze kept everything from getting too dark in color.  I will definitely do this again.  Next time I will use chicken cutlets, so they will cook faster.

A nice change of pace from traditional stir fry soy sauce based sauce. It was a bit sweet for my taste, but that is the nature of balsamic vinegar (and brown sugar, of course). I loved all of the fresh veggies. We are on a low sodium diet so I really appreciated that I didn't have to use any salt to flavor this dish. Thank you for the recipe!

I gave it four stars only because I adjusted ever so slightly, but 4 1/2 is probably closer. I didn't use spinach simply because it already had a lot of veggies in it.  The other point I would make is to double the amount of sauce because it was so yummy!  I happened to have a white balsamic with blueberry on hand.  Normally I have the standard which is what I would have used but this was devine!  I also used Splenda brown sugar blend instead of straight brown sugar.

I made half this recipe and was very impressed! This is practically a full meal in itself - there are a lot of veggies in this.  I had red, yellow, and orange bell peppers, so I used those – no green.  I did use the full amount of balsamic and brown sugar for my half recipe and it thickened into a nice, syrupy glaze that was dark and rich.  This is very colorful, and very delicious!  I would not hesitate to make this one again!  Thank you, MellyBelly (and Aunt Jules)!!

LOVED IT!!! My husband and I picked this for Our Date Night dinner....OMG it was sooooo worth it..We prepped the items together and cooked it together...the results were mouth watering!! The only thing I did differently was add about three more tablespoons of Brown Sugar in the Vinegar..the taste was soft and made it more as a sauce!! Thank You for posting!!!

Love all of the veggies! Good balance between the veg and protein. I made one change and cut the chicken into strips also. My other change was to add everything back to the pan after the balsamic step and tossed it in the sauce in the pan. I felt it needed a bit of a kick so I added some sambal oelek to my plate but hot peppers in oil would have worked as well or even Sriracha. Bonus points for a one pan dish! Thank you for sharing your recipe MellyBelly.

Just made this dish, and love the flavor that the sauce gives it.  I made more sauce than recipe called for, but you don't need much drizzled over to give a wonderful flavor.  I used the veggies as the bed to put the chicken on; YUM!  There are so many possibilities with this recipe as far as adding in veggies.  My sister-in-law made something like this and added in beets, which really absorbed the vinegar taste.  A great meal for gardeners looking for a great recipe to show-case their harvest!

AWESOME!  I left out the spinach but this is really good.  The chicken was very moist.  The pepper, onion, asparagus was yummy!  This is a keeper for sure.

Loved it! Left out the asparagus just because I didn’t have any, but it was delicious!!! I’ve made it so many times I can’t even count because my 7yo asks for it weekly (and takes the leftover chicken in her lunch for school!)

The recipe was easy enough to follow and the finished product delicious; I just wish I would have used smaller pieces of chicken because these breasts took 15 minutes each side in the oil and the splattering of oil/grease was EVERYWHERE so cleanup was more than I had planned for but the taste was great!

The sauce turned to a 'toffee' like consistency, not sure why.  Won't be making this again.

I loved this recipe! The only change I made was in the type and amount of the green pepper I added and that was simply because of what I had on hand. Will definitely make this a regular addition.

I subbed canned chicken for the breasts, skipped the asparagus and used red pepper and green onions. I'm more a savory than sweet toothed person, so I also added soy sauce to the glaze which gave it more of a teriyaki flavor. This would be perfect over rice.

Great!! Made this as instructed, minus the fact that I only had two red peppers, no green or yellow (I bet that is yummy!). Served over rice. There was not a lot of sauce (although enough for two of us), so I would probably double it next time just to have some extra. It would also be fine without the sauce. Quick and easy to make on a week night and healthy delicious!! The flavors are great together. Thanks for sharing.....will be making this again!

My first time cooking AND eating asparagus & peppers. LOVED IT! I don't like garlic at all so didn't add that or the onions and was still very pleased with this recipe. This recipe is a keeper!

Simply divine!  I can't believe more people haven't reviewed this!  It's become such a regular meal with my family that I double the amount of brown sugar and vinegar because the kids love the extra sauce!

This was delicious.  I omitted the spinach because my dad cannot have leafy greens and as other suggested I tripled the sauce because we are sauce people. It was yummy over the yellow rice and french style green beans I served with it. My ten year old loved it, if she loved it, it's definitely a keeper.

DELICIOUS!!! This will be a regular meal in my house. Everyone loved it. I did add mushrooms, added a lot more garlic (about a head and half) and tripled the sauce as suggested by other reviewers. I also seasoned the chicken breast’s with garlic powder and onion powder along with the salt and pepper and a spritz of balsamic on each breast.  OMG this is absolutely delicious!!!!

Cooking for two. Made it exactly as written. It was outstanding. Even my husband, who likes nothing new, loved it. Had a little leftover. The next day they were reheated, the chicken was sliced up, it was placed on a burrito with a little lettuce, rice and the peppers, drizzled with the sauce and made a great lunch. This recipe is in the "make regularly" file.

It came out well but you have to make sure that you cut your vegetables evenly and have a big enough skillet to cook them in. 10 minutes to cook the vegetables is a conservative estimate; it does need more time. According to my taste taster, you also need to add more salt, thyme and Herbs de Provence to enhance the flavor of the sauce. I will definitely be making this again!

i made this as directed mostly.  I substituted fresh green beans for the asparagus.  I ended up slicing the chicken into strips and mixed it with the vegetables.  I served it over rice pilaf.  The balsamic vinegar was really strong. I'm not sure if I'll make it again.

If you love peppers and onions, this is a great go-to chicken dish.  Loved it!

I will definitely make this again. I made it exactly as the recipe said. You do have to use a really large frying pan.

This is a very easy recipe to make and is delicious. A friend made this at a dinner I attended many years ago. It is a go to for me and my daughter calls it a “comfort food “. I follow the recipe exactly but when I know someone does not tolerate the onions I omit them and may use onion powder.

I did cook the spinach in a different pan than the other vegetables. once the spinach was cooked I put the vegetables in the same pan with the spinach. easy to fix and delicious.

I made this exactly as written, except I doubled the sauce recipe.  
Pros:  Lots of vegetables which we love.  I like chicken a bit on the dry side and this was.  Enough for six if served with rice.
Cons: A lot of work and I love to cook. Messy with all the sautéing so not a great company meal.  I love vinegar and even cooking down the sauce so there was something to put on the dish, it was too vinegary for me and I love balsamic vinegar.  I think with some tweaking, the recipe would be good, but not great.

Made it with organic scarlet kale instead of spinach and no red onion and it was excellent! My wife and I thought it tasted like something you'd get at an upscale restaurant. I placed it on a base of organic basmati rice, so I made 50% more balsamic vinegar mixture. I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious! I did not use the Balsamic vinegar (forgot) and it is still delicious! I sprinkled the brown sugar into the veggies as I stirred.

I used fresh green beans since I didn't have asparagus.  Smells delicious as it cooks .  Will be eating it tonight for dinner.

This sauce was far too sweet for our family.  We loved the veggies with the sauce, but with the chicken it was not a hit. The veggies were gone, but the chicken was only picked at by the meals conclusion.
