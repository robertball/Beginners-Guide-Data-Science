This came together quickly and the sesame oil gives it a nice flavor (I added a touch more than a tsp).  I was concerned when I toasted the noodles/seeds that the noodles weren't crisping, but they turned out just fine as they cooled.  I found the pineapple was a bit much for me, so I'd dice it a bit smaller if I make this again.  This keeps well, just keep the noodles/seeds separate and add at service.  I used one package of beef and one package of shrimp ramen.  THANKS for the recipe!

Used half apple cider vinegar and half rice wi e vinegar.  And used half olive oils and half peanut out.  Added mandarin oranges instead of pineapple.  Do delish!
