Very easy. I also used extra zest and the lemon juice to replace some water.

I made this for our Independence Day social. Everyone loved it. I made it in a 10 in pie plate. I had enough crumb mixture for crust, but had to double the filling part of recipe. I used juice of the lemons to replace an equal amount of water. I blended the filling mixture in a blender to make it smooth.

It was just OK.    wish I had added the 1/2 cup of juice from those lemons to replace a 1/2 cup of the water.   This recipe was very bland and and had zero "tang".

I had to add sugar in a cheese mix, but there is lot more cracker crumbs, than is needed.
The recipe is not good

I liked it! Of the three others, they said it needed more zest. It took awhile to mix until no crumps. next time I'll add lemon juice to the cup of water.  Why waste the lemons?

It was soooo easy!   And it was done quick!  Iâ€™m probably going to eat the whole pie myself. Beyond easy!
