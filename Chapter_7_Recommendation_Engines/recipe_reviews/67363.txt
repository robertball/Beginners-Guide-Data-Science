This recipie does take quite some time to prepare (it took my approx. 1 hour working by myself) - But it is so worth it!  It's absolutely delicious!  I was nervous at first about the amounts of all the herbs I was adding, but they work so nicely together, they blend well.  Kudos to Colleen - awesome dish!

This needs more flavor,  The tomato, chives, and pimento don't add a lot of flavor,  Maybe if we added more Garlic or more Basil or diced onion instead of chives it would of picked up the flavor.

Very good! I only had green pepper on hand, so I just used that. Very tasty appetizer...I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
