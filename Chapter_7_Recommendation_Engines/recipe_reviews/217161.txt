This was fantastic! I did have to add more milk since it was so thick. Next time I won't drain the veggies to maybe thin it out a little and keep that great flavor.

My whole family enjoyed this! The only change I will make next time is to use about 1/4 of the onion called for in the recipe.  Definitely a keeper! Oh and we used biscuits instead of English muffins since that's what I had on hand.  This recipe was a "jazzed up" version of the creamed eggs on toast I always enjoyed as a kid.  Thank you for this addition to my recipe box!

Loved this!  It was very thick, but soooo good over muffins!  I didn't have bell pepper so left it out.  MMMM!
