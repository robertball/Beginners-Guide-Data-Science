Okay everyone who does not know what BOILED CUSTARD IS:  If you know what egg nog is, boiled custard is that without the extra flavoring like rum, etc.  Of course its not a custard pie, custard is a form of "pudding".  Also, by "eggy", if you have chunks of egg, you are cooking too hot, and not stirring constantly, and not doing a sufficient job with the strainer.  I have noticed that it is good to strain it twice.  If you strain it when putting it in to its cooling pitcher, etc. thats gets the base of it out.  Then if you strain it again when it has been cooled, that takes the clumps that have joined then.  Then put it into the refrigerator and have happy holidays.  If you are fed up with making this stuff, just go buy it.  Now I'll tell you, not very many people carry Boiled Custard, but the brands I have seen are Sealtest, Southern Bell, and Deans.  Request it if you local grocer doesn't carry it.

Use egg yoke only. 6 Per Qt. of Milk. you want have to strain. while custard cooling; Beat egg whites, add some sugar to whites. Fold and blend into custard. You can use whip cream instead of egg whites if you like. This is an old Tennessee recipe that's 200 plus years old.

This is my aboslute favorite at Christmas. But I do it the way my great-grandmother did it. I just use the yolks when it's cooking and then when it's finished I whip the whites with some sugar, and then fold the whites into the custard while it's cooling. Then you don't have to strain it and you get good little chunks of meringue-like pieces.

This was so good! Rich and creamy! But if you're looking for that store-bought taste, this is not the recipe. I think it would be even better with a little extra vanilla. Maybe using the beaters on it after you strain it would also make it smoother. Will definitely make again and try these new ideas!

I just want to say how tickled pink I am with this boiled custard recipe!  I live in Turkey, and wanted the delicious flavor of the custard my southern grandmother and mother used to make.  Let me tell you, this hit the spot!  I am also delighted with the ease it can be made; no slaving over the stove like my mom did.  Even my Turkish babysitter is hooked on boiled custard now!  I now have a little bit of southern Christmas so far away; thanks again!

While this tasted good, it never coated the back of a spoon matter how long I cooked it. I ended having to add corn starch to get it to at least coat the back of a spoon.

I would most likely only give this recipe this rating for a number of reasons.First of all it has too much sugar.My family loves boiled custard that isn’t too sweet that means 11/2 cups sugar per gallon.Then there aren’t the right number of eggs.We use 4 whole eggs plus a yolk if needed per quart.That means16-20 eggs per gallon.Then there is not enough flavoring in this boiled custard ! A gallon of custard would require4teaspoons vanilla+1 1/2 teaspoon almond extract .We use 3/4 teaspoon vanilla+1/4 teaspoon almond extract to flavor a quart of custard).Then it must be strained.Also you could use up to 4 teaspoons cornstarch or 2-3 Tablespoons flour to help thicken the custard.This could be added with the sugar or blended carefully with a small amount of hot custard then strained into the pot.Thickning must be allowed time to cook and the mixture must be strained after it is added .The recipe must be cooked on low and this great of a quantity would take a very long time to cook.I would not advise cooking so large a batch all at once.
