My husband and I loved this meal enough that we will definitely get through all the leftovers! I made a few minor tweaks, mostly just based on personal preferences and what I had on hand:
-I seasoned the pork before I cooked it (in the crock pot) with onion powder, garlic powder, garlic salt and cumin. I would probably do this again.
-I used diced tomatoes with green chilies, about half a 10-ounce can, instead of just green chilies.
-I made my own cornbread instead of using a mix. It covered the top generously.
-I left off the cheese, and didn't miss it.
We'll be adding this to our rotation!

Made it my own by substituting red enchilada sauce with green; adding 2 fresh jalapeños and sautéed with onions lots of garlic, chipotle chili powder, cumin , s&p before adding to pork; omitting black olives and using a whole cans of white kernel corn and whole can of black beans.  I know a lot of subs and changes but made it perfect for our Texas tastes and will totally make again!

I really didn’t enjoy pulling pork for this recipe, but I did it anyway.  Next time I would chop up pork, chicken or use ground beef. This will be lunches/dinners for the next few days. Unless I decide to box some up for my local servers.

This was quick and easy to make with leftover pulled pork.
