I've actually been making a very similar recipe for about 18 years. It was actually taught to me by my landlord at the time. He was from Italy and this was one of his specialties. Unfortunately, tomatoes are lousy this time of year. I used good quality canned. I also tossed in some Italian seasoning. I served it over angel hair pasta, a favorite in my house.

Not bad, but needs some jazzing up.  A little weak in the flavor department.  I prepared this a little backwards from the recipe directions, first sauteeing the shrimp just briefly in olive oil, then adding the garlic, and finally the tomatoes, basically just long enough to heat them, not cook them to death.  To finish I added fresh chopped parsley (this definitely needed that punch of color) and swirled in some butter and some of the pasta cooking water to make a luscious, velvety sauce. Served this tossed with angel air pasta and garnished with a few piquant caper berries.

Didn't have tomatoes, so used ordinary pasta sauce instead. Excellent over pasta shells with small bits of broccolli

Made it as directed and found it pretty boring, so I threw in a whole bag of spinach. WOW! What a difference it made!

This was delicious!  I added fresh basil, chopped zucchini, crushed red pepper and a few other spices to the sauce, grilled the shrimp for a couple minutes and served with whole wheat linguine...excellent combination!

This was a big success with my family. Used frozen, pre-cooked, tail-off shrimp... thawed. Poured shrimp/tomato mixture into angel hair pasta, mixed & served.  Very easy and quick!!!!

Good recipe. To cut the acid of the tomatoes I added about a tablespoon of molasses. And I added a few more spices. Very quick and good.

Rating this a four, even though I ultimately had to add a bit more seasoning to create the sauce I wanted. But I really, really like this recipe with a few minor additions and will definitely make again! I used canned petite diced tomatoes and probably 7 garlic cloves because some were small. After the salt and cayenne and simmering a bit, I tasted and decided to add dry onion and basil. As the sauce simmered I added a bit of pasta water to keep it from drying out before the flavors had really blended. Delicious with the shrimp over angel hair pasta.

this was awesome!!! i will be making this again and again. lol but the only thing i did differently, was less tomatoes and added about a tbs of brown sugar, it added just the right amount of sweet with the spicy.

Agree with Nene but also add sliced mushrooms to jazz it up a little more. A little cayenne and chili powder on the shrimp prior to adding the shrimp is a nice touch also.

This come out surprisingly yummy! I needed a quick dinner and this was a life saver. i used extra seasonings that i like and seasoned to my taste. i used a chunky pasta sauce because i had no tomatos. i also used cumin instead of red pepper so i can have the kick without the fire. just wasn't in the mood for a really spicy dish. My finished product was a 5 star dish but with all the changes to this basic recipe it was more of a guide or idea for dinner and i took it from there i have to give it a 3 for being a great guide.

This is incredibly tasty for having such basic ingredients. I really enjoyed the simple flavors of this dish, it tasted so fresh and light. Next time I will add some fresh basil and maybe a little lemon juice.

This was a big hit.  A little spicy but I was heavy handed with the pepper and garlic.  Can't wait to make it this summer with garden tomatoes!

My husband and I really love this one.  We substitute the roma tomatoes whit our home canned stewed tomatoes with green pepper, onions, and celery.  That really gives it a great flavor.

Used the butter to sauté the garlic, used good quality jarred tomatoes, added parsley for colour, very pleased on how this dish turned out.  Simple, will make again.
