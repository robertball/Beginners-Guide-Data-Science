Excellent recipe w/some tweaking.  I used other reviewer's suggestions and used much less sugar, 1 cup and a couple tablespoons.  I also used half white, half whole wheat flour; a 15 oz can of pumpkin; 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil and I added a cup of chopped walnuts and DID NOT chop the cranberries, as I think it lessens the tartness.  Exellent muffins, VERY moist.

These muffins were fantastic! I didn't have any vegetable oil on hand, so I substituted melted butter and they came out just fine.  Also, I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I made my own using 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/4 t. ground ginger, 1/8 t. allspice, and 1/8 t. nutmeg.  I added 3/4 c. chopped walnuts to the recipe, as well as an extra pinch of salt.  The muffins were so delicious, especially right out of the oven with some melted butter.  Thanks for such a great recipe!  I will definitely be making these again!!

Excellent muffins!  I did make a couple of changes based on a couple of other reviews.  Instead of all white flour, I did 1 cup white, 1 cup ww and 1/4 cup wheat germ.  I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup, increased the pumpkin pie spice to 2 teaspoons and reduced the oil to 1/4 cup while adding 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce - YUMMY!  I did use fresh cranberries not chopped and I only found that I got 18 muffins total!  Thanks for sharing, I will definitely make these again!

Yummy!  I used dried cranberries instead, and it was perfect!  I really liked the contrast b/t the tartness of the cranberries and the sweetness of the pumpkin.  Definitely worth making!

wonderfu fall treat!! I also did 1c white, 1c ww, 1/4c wheat germ, and added 1/4c oat bran since I used a full can of pumpkin. I cut my berries in half and used 1 &1/4c.  I also used 1/4c applesauce, and 1/4c oil + 2tbl. aprox 1c sugar as well. I'm sure they are good as is, but mine turned out well. I did heat the oven to 400 but turned it down for most of the baking to 375 b/c my oven seems to burn everything!! I used paper liners as well.

I thought these turned out good. I used nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, allspice and ground cloves in place of the pumpkin pie spice. (1 teaspoon of each except 1-1/2 teaspoons cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves.) I also used half the sugar as recommended by other reviewers and I used 1 cup all purpose flour with 1 cup oat bran flour and 1/4 cup wheat germ. I also substituted applesauce for the oil. These turned out great and not too sweet, but I wish they would have raised a little more. I was also a little concerned if I used too much spices, but it was still a delicate flavor. (I think the cranberries set the spices off well.) I would make these again.

Very yummy!  I added chopped pecans in addition to cranberries.  I also used dried cranberries because that is what was available in stores--tasted yummy.  They were a little sweet, so next time I will add less sugar, or perhaps some orange zest.  I sprinkled them with powdered sugar after they cooled. They quickly disappeared when I brought them to work.  Would make again.

Very yummy and enjoyed by all ages.  I substitute 1/4 cup of the all purpose flour for wheat germ and I use 2 cups of whole cranberries.  I also substitute applesauce for the vegetable oil.

I made several modifications to this recipe and what I came up with was good but not great.  I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, 1 cup packed brown sugar instead of white sugar, 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, a splash of vanilla, 1.25 cups of plain lowfat yogurt instead of oil, 2 cups of frozen cranberries and 1 cup of walnuts.  The actual pumpkin muffin part was very moist and flavorful.  But I added to many cranberries for my taste and that is what lowered my rating for them.  One thing I noticed though is that they tasted better the next day rather than warm from the oven.

This is an excellent muffin recipe and is fairly versatile. I used 1.25 C each of whole wheat and white flour, reduced the amount of sugar to 1 C and added 1 C of apple sauce and 1 pound of blanched cranberries. I baked the muffins at 350F for 25 minutes. They came out great. I will definitely make these again. The only reason why I substituted apple sauce for pumpkin, is because I like using fresh, cooked pumpkin rather than canned. I did not have the time to cook any fresh pumpkin. I also cooked these muffins in large muffin sheets and that created about 1 dozen large muffins.

We all LOVED these, even the 3 kids!!!  I made them the night before and by morning all of the flavors had blended together beautifully.  I added a handful (maybe 3/4 cup?) of chopped walnuts and used craisins, since that's what I already had.  I think the texture of the cranberries and walnuts is what actually put it over the top.

Great basic recipe!!!  However, I tweaked them to make them a little healthier. I only used half the sugar, and the muffins were still really sweet.  I can't imagine using 2 whole cups of sugar!!!  I used whole wheat flour and added about 3 rounded tablespoons of ground flax to the dry ingredients.  I also used 1.5 cups of dried cranberries instead of fresh and added more spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and allspice) to the pumpkin pie spice.  Voila!!  Delish!!!

Big hit!  I too cut the sugar to 1 cup, and did 1/2 whole wheat flour, and they came out great! I didn't chop the cranberries, and they were definitely pockets of tartness, if you like that.  I only used the one cup of pumpkin, and it's annoying to have 1/2 a can left, so i might just make a 2nd batch!  The texture was very cakey and rich, but not greasy feeling ( i decided to leave the 1/2 cup oil as is to see how they came out)
My 7 year old loved them, and even the super picky teething 18 month old took a bite or too and he just doesn't do carbs.  So thumbs up all around!

These were wonderful.  I cut the sugar to 1 cup, used a whole can of pumpkin, and used twice the amount of pumpkin pie spice.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Very good muffins, nice and light unlike other pumpkin muffins I have tried. I used 1/2 cup left over homemade cranberry sauce instead of fresh and added 1 cup chopped apples too. I would have given this five stars but I think it needed a bit more spice. Next time I'll try adding a half teaspoon more.

I wasn't sure what to rate this recipe because I did make a few changes.  They were amazing though!  I used 1 1/4 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup of whole wheat.  I double the spices.  (I didn't have pumpkin pie spice but used cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger)  I only used 1 cup of white sugar and then added 1/2 cup of brown.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla.  After I put the batter in the muffin cups I mixed up a topping of 2 tbls of butter, 2 tbls flour, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tbls brown sugar and spooned it on top.  I took them to work the next day and everyone raved about them.  MMMMMMMMMmmmmm...

YUM!!!  Made exactly as written using fresh cranberies, they turned out wonderful.  I did only get 20, but I also filled mine a bit more full than 3/4 full.  I'll be making these again soon.

Delicious! I didn't chop the frozen cranberries.  I added pecans and orange zest to the mix. Then I covered it with an orange glaze. Next time, I will try it without the pecans.

Delish! My only minor alterations were using half a cup canned pumpkin and half a cup apple sauce instead of a whole cup canned pumpkin, because that's what I had on hand, and I used about 1 1/2-2 cups fresh cranberries, chopped. I left my first batch in the oven for 18 minutes and they were slightly overdone. I only cooked the second batch for 16, and those two minutes made a ton of difference. I also only got 18 muffins, not 24. Great recipe, though—will definitely make again (especially since the CSA has been sending us cranberries like crazy)!

These are great muffins!  I filled my muffin cups pretty full as I'm partial to the larger top muffins.  They are just beautiful!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using dried, sweetened cranberries since I could not locate anything else.  They were still very good.

I made these as mini-muffins (made about 30) and they turned out great!  I also used white whole wheat flour (King Arthur).  It gives all the nutrition of whole wheat and bakes like white flour.  I upped the spices a bit, since I like muffins spicy. I'll definitely make these again, perhaps adding some apple sauce to substitute for the oil.

These are a hit! My husband is a muffin addict and very discerning. I only made a dozen (they're a bit small) and by his request a second 2 dozen batch is baking right now. The smell of our home is incredible. I melted margarine because we were out of oil and it worked very well.

the muffins taste fantastic, however the temp seems to be up to high. my muffins were burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. perhaps 350/375 would be better. i will try again tomorrow..too frustrated to clean burnt pans and try again tonight.

These muffins were a hit at work.  They had a nice moist texture and then you hit a burst of cranberry...great!

Delish!  I made my own pumpkin pie spice, used high quality dried cranberries, and half whole wheat / half white flour.  Oh, and I topped the batter with chopped walnuts before cooking.  Perfectly balanced flavors.  I noticed a lot of other raters cut the sugar in half, but I chose to use the full 2 cups.  I didn't find the muffins too sweet.  I think the whole wheat flour really cuts the sweetnes, but I'll probably cut the sugar in half next time (just in case those other cooks are right :)  These muffins are yummy for any time of the year!

Yummy! Alterations: I used only half of the amount of sugar (2/3 c brown, 1/3 c white). I didn't use pumpkin spice but instead used 1/4 t of the following: ginger, cloves, nutmeg, mace and 1/2 t of cinnamon. I also added streusel topping (1/4 c sugar, 3 T flour, 1/2 t cinnamon, 2 T butter [cut into dry ingredients, NOT melted]). I also kept the cranberries whole.

Super yummy!  I used whole wheat pastry flour, halved the sugar, and used egg replacer to make them vegan.  I also didn't chop the cranberries because I like tart, gooey blobs of cranberry in my muffins.  :o)  They're a nice change from orange-cranberry muffins; I'll definitely make these again!

These are so good and so easy!  Both my kids (ages 2 & 8) LOVED these as well.  I used fresh cranberries chopped in my Pampered Chef Food Chopper and reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is a great recipe!  The combination of the pumpkin and the cranberries was delicious.  I made these for work and everyone loved them, they were very moist and didn't crumble apart like a regular muffin.

Loved these muffins!  I added an exta tsp of pumpkin pie spice, only 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1/2 cup chunky applesauce and 1/4 cup oil.  Tasted as good or better than any bakery muffin I've had in a while!

I originally found this same recipe in the breads but it sounded so good I made muffins from it.  I got 18 large muffins that were delicious.  I did not have the pumpkin pie spice so used the sub of 1 1/2tsp. cinnamon, 1/2tsp. ground ginger, 1/2tsp nutmeg.  I also used dried cranberries and walnuts.  Have a request to make them again, which I will today!

I must have done something wrong because these did not turn out good at all. I did the same modifications I saw on other reviews (dried cranberries, half white flour, half wheat and half the amount of sugar), and these were too dense and so dry and crumbly! After the first batch came out, I added some water to the remaining batter, and those muffins tasted better. I feel bad rating this low when I modified it, but it seems other people made the same changes, so I'm convinced it's the recipe. I'll be sticking to the wheat honey pumpkin muffins on this site.

Loved these, and so did everyone at my office! Found it a bit tedious cutting up fresh cranberries, but they really tasted phenomenal. Might use Craisins next time, but there will be a next time for these!

Let me start by saying I think I botched these because it was by far the stiffest dough I have made!  But it was soooo worth it!  We are trying to watch a little so we used Splenda Blend - only 1 cup per other reviewers - and it was delish, enough sweetness to offset the cranberries but not so much that you felt like you were eating a poptart :)  We also added about 3/4 cup chopped pecans.  I noticed with the Splenda Blend that it took only 15 minutes to bake.  Mine were a little ugly (could not smooth them on my life!  think it had to be the Splenda Blend???) Ugly or not - we are doing this one again and again - the flavor is really pretty great!

I must have done something wrong so I'm not giving this a lower rating. I couldn't eat these, but my boyfriend did.  The only modification I made was to split the sugar, half brown, half white.  There was no flavor (other than the tart cranberries), didn't even have a muffin consistency, very dense, stuck to the paper lining, and didn't raise up at all during baking.   I won't be trying this again.  I'll stick to the cranberry-pumpkin cookies on this site.

Very yummy! I added 1/4 cup of maple syrup and only 1 cup sugar. I used fresh cranberries (I think I'll use more than the 1 cup next time) and pumpkin seeds. I might have overdone it on the spices (cin, nutmeg, allspice, cloves) but they still turned out wonderful!

Very moist. Light pumpkin flavor, not too heavy with spice. I used dried sweetened cranberries and did not chop them. These turned out pretty sweet and very moist like I stated at the first. I made these for an event at work, and we only sampled 1, but sure wish I'd made a double batch and had some to leave here as well. Excellent muffins, Thanks Sue Ross!!!

Outstanding recipe!  Some of the best muffins I've ever made.  Would be even better with some toasted nuts added.  I subbed applesauce and yogurt for most of the oil and used 1 cup all purpose flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup wheat germ instead of all white flour to bulk up the nutritional content. I only got 18 muffins out of it.  Definitely a keeper!

I think these taste great, however, I had a bit of trouble with the temp on the oven.  I had to bake the muffins longer to cook through and therefore, they got browner than I'ld like. Might be a problem with my oven, but next time, I'm going to lower the temp to 375 and cook longer. I added Chocolate chips, a little more spice and used canned cranberries and they tasted great! Thanks for the yummy recipe.

This was a very tasty recipe. I think it was a tad too sweet so next time I will cut the sugar to one cup. Also, instead of one cup of chopped cranberries, I used two cups of whole cranberries. Just the perfect amount of tartness.

These muffins were missing a little more sweetness and could use more cranberries.  They were moist, but not as tasty as they could be.  Though the recipe does not indicate to use the '15 oz' can of pumpkin puree, I think it is meant to be implied.

I have made these muffins several times and they are excellent.  Also, I always follow the recipe as it is shown and they come out perfect every time. There's really no need to alter it, unless you you want to make them slightly more healthy by reducing the amount of sugar (since it uses 2 cups) or use a sugar substitute.  Either way, it's a wonderful recipe and I make these every fall!

These muffins are great the next day!  The cranberries really went well in the muffins.  i was craving raisins too, so I made two dozen muffins.. one dozen with cranberries, the second with raisins.  I added about 1/4 cup more pumpkin in the raisin muffins b/c I had some leftover.  I added a bit more pumpkin pie spice too.  They turned out so delicious!  oh, and both types were nice and moist.  Mmm!

The recipe is super easy. The muffins turned out great. I only got 1 dozen muffins even though the recipe says it makes 2.
Next time, I'm going to increase the pumpkin pie spice to 2 teaspoons and the cranberries to 2 cups because i found there wasn't enough. I also didn't chop the cranberries.

Very Good! I also changed this up a bit, 1/2 Whole Wheat Flour, applesauce in lieu of oil, was short on sugar, only had 3/4C so added 1/2C Brown sugar. Also, I used my own pumpkin puree(about 2C) and put White Choc Chips on the top. These are SO moist! Will definately make again, and again...

These muffins are delicious. I did make a few changes, though. I too replaced some of the flour with wheat germ, and cut the sugar down to 1 cup. The muffins are plenty sweet enough with just one cup, 2 would be way too much. I used craisins instead of cranberries and they worked just fine. I would have replaced the oil with applesauce, but I am out of applesauce currently. Overall, great recipe. :)

These muffins were very good....I used canned pumpkin left over from a pumpkin bread recipe. The cranberries were a nice addition.  I served them with whipped cream cheese for breakfast.

I really wanted to love this recipe!  Pumpkin and cranberries, two things I love, so it sounded delicious but I followed the recipe exactly and found the muffins didn't taste especially of pumpkin and the cranberries weren't evident in the least.  They tasted just like a very boring, sweet, nothing at all special, muffin.  I was really disappointed!

Love it! To make these a little heartier, I use half wheat flour and half white flour.  I also cut the sugar in half and use fresh pumpkin.  I like them spicier too so I use one Tablespoon of spice.  My 3-year old loves them too!

I used about double the pumpkin, 1 1/3 cup sugar, whole grain spelt flour -- instead of all purpose flour, and only 1/4 cup oil, and thought that a 5 star muffin.

Moist and sweet - my family and coworkers loved them. I followed the recipe exactly except for the cranberries. I had already made my own fresh cranberry juice, so I had boiled cranberries leftover. I used those, did not chop them.

I made this as is, except I lowered the temp to 375.  I made 12 in metal muffin pans, 6 in a silicone pan, and 24 in a mini-muffin pan.  The ones in the metal pans (regular and mini-sized) were done in 20 minutes.  The ones in the silicone pan took 30 minutes.  So, the difference in cooking temps and times might have something to do with the type of pan being used.  Hope that helps!  Oh, and they came out WONDERFULLY!  Seriously, sooooooo delicious!

These muffins were amazing! Like other reviewers, I made quite a few changes to the recipe, which made them a bit healthier and delicious! I used 1 cup of reg. sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar. Then I replaced the oil with applesauce to make them healthier. Instead of pumpkin spice I used allspice, and I used unchopped fresh cranberries. Finally, I added 1/2-3/4 cup of flaked sweetened coconut (this made them taste so good!) Enjoy!

I used 1 cup sugar like the other reviewers suggested. These were pretty good. Interesting combo of flavors for sure. Prob would be real good without the cranberries or with some glaze on top.

I made 2 versions- 1 with the whole amount of sugar (2 cups) and 1 with 1.5 cups sugar, 1/2 cup applesauce. The one with more sugar was better, IMO. I also added 2 Tbsp ground flaxmeal and used 1/2 whole wheat flour in place of white flour (both versions). Yummy muffins, my husband loved them.

I give the original recipe a 4, but I made a few changes that my family personally liked so its a 5! :)
I used 3/4 the amount of sugar, and added vanilla and the juice of half an orange.  
I doubled the original recipe and it did great! This is such a wodnderful addition to my holiday cooking, thanks so much for sharing!

Sooo delicious! now I must admit I made some substitutions. I used 1 c. oat flour and 1.25 c. brown rice flour for allpurpose flour(staying away from wheat products) and half and half brown sugar and splenda. The result is/was! mouthwatering delicate!

I made this recipe as written, except for using winter squash (in place of pumpkin), applesauce (instead of oil), and flaxseed meal/water (rather than eggs). The muffins turned out really well. However, I would agree with some of the other reviewers: Even though some of the cranberries were super-tart, I still found the muffins on the overly sweet side.

This recipe was very good. I cut the amt of sugar to 1 3/4 cups and since I did not have pumpkin spice,used 2tbsps of cinnamon and 1tsp of nutmeg. I also used a 15oz can of pumpkin. The muffins were very moist but still too sweet for my liking although everyone else found it just right. Will definitely make again with even less sugar.

Positively delicious!  I added whole cranberries and 15 oz. of home made pumpkin puree instead.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Very good, but even though I cut the sugar to 3/4, still too sweet for my taste -- next time I will try 1/2 the sugar.

This was a great recipie.  I have been looking for fall tasting recipies and these have a great flavor!  I would have never thought to put pumpkin and cranberries together, but they compliment eachother well!!
