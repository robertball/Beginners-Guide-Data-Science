These were just OK.  The vegetables were hardly cooked at all by the time the eggs were done.  I think it might be better to saute the veggies in the butter and then add the eggs.  The tarragon was a bit of an odd taste for us though.

I chose to saute the onion and pepper in the butter before adding the rest of the ingredients. Though we ate it, I can't say that we really liked the tarragon in the eggs. It's a pretty potent flavor and a teaspoon was quite a lot. This just wasn't for us.

Good recipe for scrambled eggs ruined, in my view, with the inclusion of tarragon. Dried tarragon no less.  Strong stuff.  Fresh chives and fresh dill is the way I chose to go.  Nice.   As for the vegetables, I cooked them first – all but the tomato which I sprinkled over the finished eggs upon serving.  Substitute another herb for the tarragon, preferably fresh, or leave it out completely,  and you’ll have some pretty darned good, 4-star scrambled eggs. Rating this recipe just as written, however, I’ll  give it three stars.

I've prepared this twice now.  Once exactly as presented, thus the 4 stars.  The second time I cut the tarragon in half and since I thought the egg to vegie ratio a little off, added two more eggs.  A little melted cheese toped it off for us.

i took out the terragon. just made sure to substitute the green bell pepper for red or orange one. my MIL= mothr in law doesnt like the greeen ones. anymew i cooked the bell pepper first just to make sure it was cooked enuf then added onion till they both cooked just right to my liking. then i added the other ingredients. minus the terragon ofc. we topped ours with cheese. made it evn better.
