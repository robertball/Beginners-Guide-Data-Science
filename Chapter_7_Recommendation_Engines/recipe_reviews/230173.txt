I actually thought this recipe was just ok.... it was a little bland so I added 1/4 c. of sugar and doubled the cherries. I accidentally only used 1 (8 oz.) tub of cool whip and I'm very glad I did since the recipe calls for 2.... it would have made for way too much cool whip which was already overpowering the dish. In the future, I'd also add a little more coconut since 1/2 of a 3.5 oz package is very little.... in fact, I couldn't even find a 3.5 oz package.... the extra coconut might help to sweeten it up more which will allow for less sugar to be added. After making the changes, the recipe was delicious and everyone gobbled it up!

I have made this salad several times.  In addition to what is shown above, I add 1 1/4 c. sour cream, 1/4 - 1/2 c. walnuts, and 1 tsp. orange extract to add a little more flavor.

This is the same salad my grandmother use to make. If you want to know what is missing Iâ€™ll tell you. Add 1-2 packets of orange jello mix. Then stir really good. Add pecans and walnuts. (Chopped) some coconut and large curd cottage cheese

Its bland because they left out the main ingredient!  You need 2 boxes of pistachio pudding mix.

Reminded be of a Ambrosia Fruit Salad my aunt used to make. My wife didn't care for the texture of the coconut but I liked it. I did add some peaches and overall I found it refreshing.
