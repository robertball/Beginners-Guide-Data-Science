This will be my new go-to recipe for corn muffins! These were very moist and sweet, just the way my family likes them.  I only used 3/4 c sugar and they were still very sweet. I served these along side a taco salad and they were a big hit.  Thanks for submitting this recipe!

I made the recipe just as stated. They are definitely sweet and don't have that gritty-corn-bread texture. The 1 TBS of baking powder is no a typo. If you want them to rise, you'll need to add that. Also, I made mine with paper liners. Yeah, don't do that. There's no grease in them so they stick to the paper liner.

I cannot say enough good about this recipe. We make them without the can of corn (just never have it) and bake it in an 8X8 pan for 38 minutes. It's honestly the best cornbread I have EVER had anywhere...and every single person who tries it agrees. We've also made muffins and put it in a 9X13 pan and just adjusted cooking time. Seriously can't go wrong.

Thanks, Bob, for this wonderful low fat muffin recipe!  Tried it last night and the muffins are delicious!  Not one drop of oil required!  I am impressed.  I used one large apple and put it in the blender with the eggs.  Turned out fluffy.  Also used frozen corn and put some corn in the blender to cream it a bit.  I only had 2/3 cup of sugar but added some agave syrup.  A bit sweet for my taste.  I will put in less sugar and perhaps a bit of agave (it is supposedly healthier).

I followed the recipe exactly and it made sweet, cake-like muffins. Very good.

The taste was good, I used cupcake liners & would not recommend that.  They stuck to the liners, so definitely heavily grease cup cake tins.  The flavor was sweet, but I think I will increase the salt to 1 teaspoon.  The creamed corn was a nice touch.  They do not rise much so fill almost to the top of the tin.

I cut the sugar in half as I didn't want them to be too sweet, and the taste was good. I will make these again!

I made this but with the following changes that I highly recommend:
1. Oven temp should be 400 degrees; 350 is much too low for muffins.
2. I only used 1/2 cup of sugar. I always top my corn muffins with honey butter (mix equal portions of honey and softened unsalted butter together), so I didn't want them to be too sweet. The 1/2 cup was perfect.
3. I did not put in the 2nd 1/2 cup of milk and these still came out incredibly moist.
Another change that I will try next time is to only use 1 egg. These muffins had a definite custardy consistency which I did enjoy, but I am curious to try them with 1 egg for a more cakey consistency next time.
Made with these adjustments, they were delicious! I'm actually thinking about including them on our Thanskgiving menu.

I made this exactly as written.  They are good but a tad too sweet for me.  I think next time I'll decrease the sugar by half.

These are hands down the best cornbread muffins I’ve ever had!  Delicious!!!  I did cut the white sugar to 3/4 cup yet I don’t think it made much of difference in taste. Always have lots of butter or honey butter on hand when you eat these little delights!  I did make them once with old baking powder and they definitely didn’t rise so light, delicate, and moist as previously.  Always use fresh or new baking powder with these muffins or you maybe disappointed.  Happy eating and thanks for the recipe!!

These were amazingly good!  I normally don't review any recipes that I change, but this is such a good recipe, I wanted to tell others! I didn't have any pumpkin, so I replaced it with crushed pineapple.  My husband is a diabetic, so I replaced the sugar with splenda.  Now I thought these muffins would loose the texture and be a little dry but they weren't!  The muffins turned out so moist and fluffy!  Next time I'm at the store, I'm buying pumpkin!

I made these with baking Splenda and pureed the corn a little more (we don't like chunky bits). The muffins were yummy and didn't need syrup at all. FYI for those making in a pampered chef individual serve pan, turn heat down between 300 and 325, and cook for less time (say 15-20 minutes).

OMG.  First time making these and used a popper muffin tin.  Let me tell you, had 4 already.  The smaller they are, the easier to pop them.  The only thing I did differently was use real corm, chopped up fine and did it that way.  Everything else, just like it says.  I did this in 4H and got 2nd place.  Presentation was my only fall.

I must have done something wrong because following the recipe exactly got me still not fully baked after 35 minutes :(

These are delicious!  I love that these are moist, slightly sweet but not too sweet.  I purchased a simlar muffin from a local grocery store and these are better.  I followed the recipe exactly and we'll definitely make again!  Oh, I didn't use muffin cups.  I simply sprayed baking spray and cooked for a little under 20 mins, but they had passed the toothpick test.

These are the best corn muffins we have ever eaten- at home or at a restaurant.  They are sweet and a little crumbly - just the way we like them.  Make sure you use paper liners because I learned the hard way - they will stick even to Teflon- we loved them any way - just had to dig them out!

These were good.  I made them in muffin papers and they stick in them.  Test doneness with a toothpick. Made 2 dozen, but they don't rise much so I might fill them more than 3/4 next time.
