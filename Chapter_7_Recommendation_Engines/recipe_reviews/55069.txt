I am only rating this so that no one else will make the mistake that I made. I am sure the author of the recipe meant well, but the advice about cooking at "200 degrees for four or five hours" does not work!!! The meat was not cooked; I had to throw it in the crock pot to finish it off. The marinade and sauce are delicious, but please do not cook it at 200 degrees; cook it at 325 degrees as the original idea states!!!!

At first I was a little intimidated by the number of ingredients but this recipe turned out to be easier than it looked.  This dish was great but I used an achiote oil made by heating, not boiling, the achiote seeds in sunflower oil on the stove for ten minutes.  This gives a great red colored oil and is easier to use than the paste.  The rest of the recipe remained the same.  This oil can also be used for the rice, just put a teaspoon in with the water!  I Will certainly make this again!

A bit different than other versions of this dish I have eaten, but really tasty nonetheless.  It is perhaps a bit on the tart side, and I may consider altering the lemon-orange juice ratio a bit the next time I make it.  I used the slow cooker method and the meat was moist and tender.  I thickened the roasting liquids (marinade) with a bit of cornstarch and water and this made a really delicious sauce to ladle on top of filled tortillas at the option of the diners.  I will definately be making this again.  It was a hit with my entire family, including my kids!

After a frustrating search around town for Achiote paste, I did a computer search and it led me right back to this web-site for a recipe to make your own!  This was delicious!  My kids loved it without the onion sauce.  My husband and I preferred it with it.  We both kept going back for just one more bite....  I served it in tortillas with homemade guacamole, but after one yummy wrap, we just ate it plain.  Thanks for a very different and wonderful recipe!  I will make this again and again -- a new family favorite!

I was most disappointed with this recipe.  Instead of the succulent and savory dish I know from Mexico, I got a bland, but tender pork roast.  The use of so much lemon juice gave the gravy an overpowering and identifiable citric taste, while leaving out essential elements.  Further research on the recipe has led me to include allspice and cinnamon and some garlic.  I see this recipe as absolutely unauthentic and boring.

The ingredients are so awesome but the flavors just didn't materialize.  We were disappointed but will try again and increase the seasonings.

Do not be intimidated by the Habaneros, it is actually not that spicy at the end and it needs the kick. I used a 5 pound pork butt roast w/bone.  I used 2/3 cup orange juice and 2/3 cup lemon juice, used heaping teaspoons of the spices, added minced garlic. Marinated it overnight and cooked it in crockpot. I used the meat in tacos, thickened the juices with cornstarch to spoon over the meat, topped it with chopped red onion,  guacamole and cheese.  It was heavenly!!! The flavors were fantastic.  A new delicious addition to my regular mexican recipes.

Delicious and tasty.  Made it in the slow cooker.  Required a bit of sugar and a fair bit of salt to even out the strong citrus and achiote tang.

It wasn't as flavorful as I'd hoped, but it's probably my own fault because 1. I substituted jalapenos for habaneros, fearing it would be too hot, 2. I forgot to marinate it, 3. I chose not to make and use the achiote, but instead put in the equivalent amount of loose spices (omitting the anatto because I didn't want to have to grind it).  It *was* very tasty in quesadillas, but as I say was just a bit too bland, even for my cooking group (which has a lot of families with preschoolers in it).

Following up the comment by Chynna-Destiny, she's right. When I BBQ a pork butt at about 220 degrees, it takes from 10 to 14 hours to get falling-off-the-bone cooked. Four hours at 200F will not get the job done. It's possible a 2-3 pound pork loin would cook in that short of a time.

Simply the best!  My husband is from Mexico and he's asked me to make this at least once a month from now on.  Due to lack of sour oranges, the taste is only slightly off, however using limes along with the orange juice helped quite a bit.  I made this in a slow cooker for 6hours on high and it came out perfect.  The rest of the sauce I reduced in a pot on the stove so we could use it in our tacos.  Amazing.  Thanks for sharing this one, it's a keeper.

This recipe was o.k., but was definitely missing something. I had a wonderful recipe from a friend in Mexico which I unfortunately lost. I'm still looking for a suitable replacement recipe.

Very authentic, I just added garlic and put it in a crock pot for about 8 hrs. I was unable find the achiote paste, so I purchased the whole seed.  Don't do it, try to find the paste, because I had to pound on those seeds with a hammer for hours. I make my in the crock pot.

Made this the other day and invited a couple of friends over to enjoy it with me and my boyfriend.  Used the exact ingredients specified in the recipe - achiote paste is easy to find in San Diego CA ;), marinated overnight, placed in a slow cooker on low the next morning then came home to a wonderful meal at the end of the workday!  Everyone LOVED it and agreed that it tasted just like the dish served at Casa Guadalajara in Old Town.  Served with Mexican rice, flour tortillas, mango salsa and lime slices.  Will definitely make again

This is a good recipe as is. However, if you replace 1/3 cup of the lime juice with a 1/3 cup of pineapple juice, in my opinion, its better. The pineapple juice gives a nice undertone of sweetness that plays well off of the mild heat of the habanero pepper. TIP: LET THIS MARINATE AT LEAST 8 HOURS. THE ACID IN THE FRUIT JUICES HELPS BREAK DOWN THE CONNECTIVE TISSUES IN THE MEAT.

Not spicy at all!  I didn't make the onions in vinegar.  My husband chopped the meat up to make tacos and it turned out great.

In a word: WOW. I am not usually a big fan of pork but this dish was too tasty to pass up. I only had boneless ribs on hand so I followed the marinade recipe and let cook all day in the crock pot. Served on corn tortillas with salsa & guacamole and a side of black beans. My prep and serving may not be authentic, but it was so good there was none left after dinner!

I used a spice mix with anchiote in it - just rubbed it all over the roast before putting it in the slow cooker.  I did not make the onions and vinegar mixture.  Maybe I'll try it next time.  The meat was delicious.  I used it in quesadillas - MMMMMM!

My whole family loved this.  We eat jalapenos,habaneros, and cayenne all the time, but I was glad I halved the habanero in this recipe.  It still had a little kick to it.  Next time I'll make the tortillas from scratch also.

This recipe was AMAZING. So simple and turned out delicious! I made a few adjustments...couldn't find achiote paste, but I found it powdered. So I mixed that with water and rubbed it on the pork.  I used 2/3 orange juice and 1/3 lemon juice. Also couldn't find habeneros so I used jalepenos instead. 

Cooked it in the slow cooker for 6 hours, then reduced the braising liquid a bit and poured it over the shredded pork. Served with home made corn tortillas, fresh cilantro and pickled red onions. I had the onions from another recipe so I used those instead of making a new batch, and just topped my tacos with it instead of pouring over all of the pork. It was juicy, savory, rich and FANTASTIC! Will definitely make this again.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I liked the marinade, but prefer to use a dry rub when roasting.  I did low and slow in the oven.  Pork was very tender, but was a little bland for me.  However... those onions we're great! I would've never made onions like this, and I can't believe how good they were.  When you combine them with the pork, it was very good.  Solid recipe... will use again, just with more spice.

This Yucatan style pork is so flavorful - and not too spicy hot for us!  I marinated the pork overnight and cooked it in the crock pot for 8 hours, then served it on corn or flour tortillas.  I never made the red vinegar sauce because it was plenty juicy already.  Yummy leftovers, too.

This was a good recipes.  But I think I did something wrong.  I know for sure it needed more salt.  I probably will make again but not in the near future.

I changed a lot. I made this keto-friendly, allergy-friendly, and in the slow cooker. I used boneless short ribs instead of pork. I can't eat onions so I used fennel instead. I put a layer of fennel on the bottom of the slow cooker with some olive oil, then put the prepared meat on top. Cooked on low for 8 hours. Before serving I simmered a bell pepper and more fennel in the red wine vinegar until the veg were soft and the vinegar reduced. I spooned that over each serving. We skipped the starches. It turned out beautifully.

I made this yesterday and it turned out better than I had expected. I added powdered garlic and ommitted cumin and coriander. The temperature and time didn't sound right so I increased both to 400 F and 3 hours. Despite this the meat didn't fall apart which was diappointing... Nonetheless the meat was tender and juicy and the flavors were there. I will continue making this dish but will research more because I think the technique needs to be perfected...

Awesome flavorful dish! However, I skipped the marinating step and just threw it all in the crock pot for 8hrs. Turned out perfect.

We had this wonderful dish in Mexico on our honeymoon and loved it.  This is just as I remember it.  I think the step that is missing from the recipe is, after pulling the pork apart, re-incorporate some of the juices left in the pan, not all of them, just to your liking.  The way we had it in Mexico was a sandwich.  The onions were red, but raw and on the side, as well as with sliced jalepenos.  So we put it on bread with the jalepenos and raw onion and it was exact.  I did mix some of the onions and red wine vinegar, but didn't care for it.

I made this twice. The first time was with the lemon juice, the second time with lime juice. The lemon juice was too tart, so use lime instead. Also, don't make the mistake I did. When gauging for a different portion size, don't forget to adapt times and seasonings to what you'll be doing. I had my friend try it (and she is from Mexico) and she loved it, saying that it was very similar to what she had at home.

We really enjoyed this. I ordered achiote paste and sour orange juice (instead of orange and lemon) on Amazon and it turned out great. Had a hard time spreading the paste though, so may try mixing it with some oil next time to make it easier. I used the slow cooker.

This recipe was really good. For those of you who said it was bland, I wonder if you paid attention to  it only being for 2 lbs of buttroast? Typically it's sold with more than that.

I made my own achiote paste using bon appetit's recipe; it took ˜5 mins! Also switch the ratio of orange-lemon juice (so 2/3 cp oj and 1/3 cp lemon juice). I recommend lime instead. I made this in the crockpot so I used smoked paprika instead of regular paprika and it was one of the best taco fillings I've ever had!

docked a point because that much lemon juice would be way too  tart, especially with vinegar sauce! I'll probably add an extra habanero as this wasn't spicy at all, suprisingly

I really liked it!!! I cooked it in a slow cooker wrapped on banana leaf and turned out exquisite. Served it with beans and vinegrete veggies.

Decent. Made this but changed the lemon/orange ratio after reading some reviews. Made my own marinade using fresh oranges and lemons in the Nutribullet. Used the slow cooker and cooked it on low for about 8 hours. Put the pork in tacos with some sour cream, guacamole, cheese and a habanero hot sauce. Beautiful.

I used a very lean pork sirloin roast cut into 1-2" cubes and cooked it at 325 F. for 3 hours, 2 of them covered, one uncovered. It came out tasty but very dry because the meat was so lean. The recipe needs a fattier shoulder roast. The recipe I followed is called "Cochinita Pibil, the easy way." I also followed the "Pickled Red Onions for Cochinita Pibli" recipe but substituted 2/3 cup orange juice and 1/3 cup lime juice for the liquids in that recipe and left out the Habanero chile pepper. The onions added a nice crunch and the liquid a nice flavour to the pork. I served them both over rice.

This was delicious.  I received a bunch of Seville oranges and then looked up what I could do with them.  This recipe came up.  I'm so glad it did, this was amazing.  My husband doesn't like pork, but this was so delicious and flavorful that he came back for seconds.  Yummy and so easy.
