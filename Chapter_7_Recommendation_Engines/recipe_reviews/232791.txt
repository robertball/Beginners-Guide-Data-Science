Instead of a leek, I used an onion, and replaced the chicken broth with turkey broth.  This has great flavor, with the gentle taste of mint being quite welcome!

In Columbia County, NY we have a bounty of sugar snap peas in the spring.  This is a great way to use them.  My suggestions: increase the mint by one leaf, use a medium mesh strainer to get out the strings that sometimes appear, season with Adobo instead of plain salt to give some extra depth of flavor.  Hot (with some homemade croutons) or cold with sour cream on top this is a winner.

Super easy! Substituted frozen peas for snap peas and it turned out great! Will definitely make again :)

really good. I preferred it hot to cold, but its good both ways. I had a really hard time straining it. When I used the finest mesh, it just wouldn't go through. When I used a larger mesh, too many strings made it through. But even with a few strings, it was great.

I'm starting to get tired of telling Chef John how great his recipes are, but he did it again. A light refreshing soup. Just a bit a spiciness and the tang of some fresh lemon juice in the sour cream and a little more on the soup. I did use fresh peas instead of snap peas. IF you use a Vitamix to blend the ingredients you don't need to strain BUT be careful blending/ chopping.  DONT overdo it and add too much air to the soup. It becomes more like whip than soup. Otherwise VERY Refreshing

I made it as written, but was a little sloppy with the cayenne  so it was spicy! Very good, and next time I'll use a bit less heat and a touch more mint. Very refreshing soup and used my CSA veggies in a creative way.

I didn't enjoy this soup at all.  The soup may be fine overall, I believe I just learned that I simply don't like cold snap pea soup.  I'll stick to making hot soups in the future.

I used onion instead of the leeks and topped it with sour cream.  Very yummy.  Today I'm trying the leftovers hot.

I made this but was on a liquid diet and could not wait for it to cool. It was so good. I did also have it cold and both were extremely good. It is good both ways.
