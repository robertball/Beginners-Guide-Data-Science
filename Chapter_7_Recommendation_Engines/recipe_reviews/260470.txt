This was great! I have the actual shaped  bowls to put my tortilla bread in. First time I used them! This was a great recipe and I just adjusted the timings and covered the tips from beginning.  I let it go for about 10-13 minutes in the shaped bowls (tips covered with tinfoil) and then removed the bowls and tin foil and turned upside down for another 8-11 min. Keep an eye.! Don’t get to distracted at the end! Lol I made this with red onion, lettuce, pulled pork, tomatoes, salsa, bbq corn , black beans, nacho shredded cheese , sour cream, and guacamole! Everyone loved it. Was pretty easy and something different for our house. Left over stuff made wraps for school/Work and
also  quesadillas!

I made per Chef John's directions but used an overturned Mason Jar for shaping/baking the tortilla shells. I love that I can now make these as I could live on them!

Chef John (my hero!).  I have not made these yet, but I am a Southern California woman who has been living in Europe for the last 30 years -- the last twenty of them in Sweden with my Swedish husband.  Through longing and necessity I have learned to prepare masses of varieties of (So Cal) Mexican Food.  We live in a beautiful small town on the east coast, which is located only one-hour away from Stockholm, Sweden's capital.  In any case, I have always loved Mexican salads served in these sorts of tortilla bowls, which are impossible to find in Sweden.  Not only that, the ONLY kind of tortillas available to me are flour tortillas.  You have just blessed my life enormously!  Thank you from the top to the bottom of my heart!  Also, since this is clearly a fan letter, I follow "Food Wishes" nearly religiously.  Love your puns and sense of humor and especially how you make recipes so accessible to the common cook.

Omg. I cant boil water but these were perfection. I can imagine sugar and cinnamon brushed on for a ice cream  bowl or even fresh fruit. Endless possibilities.

PERFECT!! This worked SO well! I'd like a little coarse salt sprinkled on before baking but my family isn't big on salt so I made them exactly as stated. They made the cutest little taco salads bowls. Can't wait to make again.

The shells came out hot but not crispy.  Everything else was delicious.

I only rated this a three because I have not made them yet. My question is can I make the shells up a day before? I would like to have them for a party and would need about 15 and don’t want to cook the shells the day of.

Worked well. Tried sample with the New Mexican style (thick) tortillas and it didn't work well, but after buying the thinner traditional style, it came out perfectly.  Will do again.
