I'm Guamanian & our family comes from Guam, so it was a nice surprise to see one of the rices listed on this site.  I've been making fried rice all my life and have never fed it to anyone who didnt die for the recipe.  A few tips though: before you cook your rice, wash it a few time to get the extra starch off, this will also help it from becoming mushy.  The best thing is to use leftover rice you've cooked the night before.  IT TRULY TAKES THE TASTE TO ANOTHER LEVEL, TRUST ME!!!  Also, we omit the snow peas and carrots and add slice white onion, and 2 -3 FRIED SCRAMBLED EGGS.  You wont believe the flavor!!!  Thank you Christine for rep.'n Guam in this recipe.  Hafa Adai!!

While I don't proclaim to be a " professional chef," we found this recipe to be quite tasty.  It absolutely amazes me how rude some people are....and it especially amazes me when they haven't even TRIED the recipe but base their opinions on the picture.  Thank you, Christine.  My husband and I really enjoyed this quick and tasty dish.

The way your fried rice turns out really depends on what kind of rice you are using. I try to stay away from the long grain or Jasmine rice when making this. I also like using left overs such has ham after the holidays.

I am going to rate this a 5 because this is "allrecipies" not "foodsnobrecipes"! This website can spark inspiration for "all". Everyone knows how hard it is to come by fresh ingriedients on Guam, it is VERY popular in the Hawaiian islands where I lived, BRAVO to them for using what they have made available to them. In these tough times I'm sure they are not the only ones relying on economic means... if it were pet food the FDA wouldnt allow it on the market. If this doesn't suit you by all means substitute some nice homemade Char siu like I do with leftovers otherwise give it a rest... please!

My parents had 2 tours on Guam before I was born, then one more when I was 10. My mom had made fried rice this way all of my life, and I never realized it was from Guam. 

I still make it this way today. We sometimes add leftover ham to this as well.

OK, for us this was a side dish to kalua pork. I used brown rice instead of white and frozen peas instead of pea pods, worked out just fine. Our autistic 8 YO gobbled up a plate and a half of it. Why not, it has all his favorite flavors- rice and bacon! This is also a good way to sneak in vegetables if you are liberal with the carrots and peas. I guess the principle is that if you smother anything in bacon fat my kids will eat it up with a smile!

It is also very common to use frozen mixed vegetables.  Top with several dashes of Tabasco and a fried egg.

When I lived on Guam, this became a favourite dish and still is, a bit dry, but the whole family loves it.It's different.
I do add shrimps,some prawns, and 2-3scrambled eggs chopped into small bits,as well as ham pieces.
Finedeni sauce (soy sauce with finely chopped onion) sprinkled over gives it some moisture.
We all love it

This is EXCELLENT! My new favorite fried rice recipe. I was skeptical because there aren't any "seasoniongs" (salt/pepper/etc.) but I resisted & didn't add any. Delicious! I guess the Spam & diced vegetables plus the soy sauce did the trick. I used 3c brown rice, as that's all I had already cooked. As per other reviewers, I added 3c cole slaw mix & diced scrambled egg at the end. I LOVE this rice! Did I say you should try it? Because you should!! And to think yesterday was the first time I'd heard of "Guam" fried rice or "Lumpias" (filling already done, just need to roll them now.) I couldn't cook at all if not for Allrecipes, it seems! I don't trust anything without a bunch of reviews & hints, and I love it! And I'd need a whole 'nuther page to regale Chef John...A big THANKS to this submitter and all the rest of this network - Hooray for home cooked meals!!

This was quite good.  I used the SPAM version.  I had to add maybe 2 tsps of oil to get a reasonable amount of "grease" to get the rice coated.  You could add a million things to this, but as is, it is quite tasty.  Kids liked it also.

Very good and simple fried rice. I used baby carrots that I cut in half then finely chopped so they would cook really fast. I used some bacon bits and canned peas. Turned out great!! Thanks.

This is just so easy to throw together and great for using up leftovers.  I think you could swap out any ingredients and use mushrooms, white onion, zuchini or whatever using whatever is in your fridge and it taste good.

I am half Guamanian and half Mexican and I have had this dish many times as a child. My Guamanian grandmother on my father's side taught my mother how to make it and it became one of my favorites. I have tried to recreate it from memory, but I haven't totally succeeded until now. This recipe was very helpful to let me know the order in which to do things. I used bacon, white and green onion, minced jalapenos, garlic, peas and eggs. It was just like how my mother used to make it and it was great! I also made a shrimp version with peanut oil for my pescetarian boyfriend and that turned out nicely too. ;)

YUM!!!  I made this with lite Spam and added a bit of canola oil to cook the veggies in.  Added the scrambled eggs that another reviewer suggested.  My kids added chopped up dill pickles (something we add to our Nasi Goreng also) and I added Sambal Oelek (red chilepepper paste) to mine.  We will definitely make this again!

I made this for my boys' lunch today using leftover rice from a couple days ago that I cooked with chicken broth. I left out the snow peas only because I didn't have any. They loved it! This is a comfort recipe for me only because this is something Mom used to make. Great for using up something you have in the back of your cupboard and leftover ingredients you have in your fridge.

We all loved this recipe.  I omitted the carrots and snow peas since I didn't have them, but it was really tasty.  This will be a favorite of my husbands I know.  Mine needed salt, since I went light on the soy sauce (you can overdo that in a hurry and then there's no turning back).  

I didn't drain the bacon grease completely and I'll probably drain it some more next time to about 1/4 of the grease.  

Overall, it was very good.

I had no green onions so used recipe with white onion and egg. Added chives. Used week old jasmine rice from fridge.Turned out very delicious! I was in Guam with the US Army Corps of Engineers for disaster relief following Super Typhoon Pongsona in Dec 2002 and this beat any fried rice I had during that duty!

Biba Chamorro! Here in the islands we love Fried Rice and there are so many versions you could make! My husband does not like peas or beans so frozen vegetable mix is out. Instead, I use carrots and bell pepper and sometimes cabbage. A little oyster sauce gives it a kick! Love this recipe! Thank so much.

I love fried rice and SPAM!!This was a great combo... I didn't have any onions or snow peas.. But I used the garlic, carrots and added thinly sliced cabbage..I also didn't have a lb of spam but about 1/ 4 of SPAM in my fridge that i used..I thought it was gonna be to salty from the SPAM and soy sauce but it wasn't at all.. I topped it off with a fried egg on top and served with lumpias..GREAT meal!!

This was pretty good and it made a huge pan full too. I added in some scrambled egg and used ham and petite peas. I didn't have any carrots. This was a little dry though and I had to add more oil to the rice. I only used a couple of T of low sodium soy instead. Leftovers will be even better! Thanks.

my mother in law makes this when we go visit so I wanted to try it. It came out much saltier than hers. Next time I think I'll use low sodium soy and spam. 

I also tried the shrimp idea but it made the whole dish taste too fishy. I'll stick to spam next time.

Close for sure.  Kikoman soy sauce is n absolute must. Missing the scrambled eggs.  Chamorro cooking is all about the building of depth of flavors and even the order things are prepared in.  I am sure this is great.

This was sooooo good.  I reduced the amount of everything since I was only cooking for two.  Used about 6 slices of bacon, 1 cup frozen peas and carrots (cooked in the microwave first) inrtead of sliced carrots and snow peas, and sprinkled soy sauce on to taste.  I might try it again mixing some soy sauce into the rice while it's still in the skillet, but it was fantastic as it was!

I was lucky enough to go visit my sister who is in the Air Force (almost 20 years of service) while she was stationed in Guam. I really enjoyed the eclectic cuisine while there. Just out of curiosity I thought I'd see if I could find the recipe. Bingo!! Love it!!

I gave this recipe three stars because it was just ok. I used bacon bits and had a weird flavor. I will use this recipe again and make a few changes!

This was soo good!! I halved the recipe because it seemed like too much and I was right. Half is plenty for 4 people. Maybe this dish is supposed to be a main course? Because I had it as a side dish with Guam chicken from this site. YUMM!

Made it last night following the recipe to the T and it was excellent!  I only added a few drops of sesame oil to give it my special touch.  Thank you for an excellent recipe

Made the recipe as written except we only used 3/4 lb of bacon (since it's hard to find actual full pound packages of bacon anymore) and 5 cups of rice. Still, while the flavor was OK, this is by far the oiliest fried rice I've ever had. Next time I'll probably drain the bacon grease (!) and use a bit of canola or peanut oil instead.

Very Tasty and with the flexibility to cater to individual tastes.  Additionally, I put finely chopped yellow squash, celery - used cubed ham in mine and it was so good.  Thanks Christine!

I made it as stated and just ate it up! Thanks to the reviewers for the tips; rinsing the rice to remove some starchiness, and adding just a little oil to the pan. Very tasty and needs no other seasoning. Thanks!

The husband and I love fried rice recipes. This one is great. I love spam, so it's perfect for me. The only thing I added was a little oil because the spam doesn't create enough grease in the pan to cook the veggies and rice in.

This was so good, a good combination of ingredients and just right on the soy sauce. The texture of the rice was perfect, not like the mush served in most restaurants.  I made half a recipe using Jalapeno Spam, I added a little vegetable oil because I didn't think the Spam would release enough oil to coat the rice. I also used chopped yellow onion in place of green. Will definitely make again soon. Thanks!

SPOILER ALERT! LOTS OF CHANGES COMING, IF YOU ARE A HATER, KEEP CLICKING, LOL! I  really, really liked this. The only reason I didn't love it, was  I wish I would have added garlic, {I forgot it, oops!} I missed the layer of root veggie flavor. . Also, I didn't add onion because my kid wouldn't eat it, and I missed that too!  Was worried that the soy sauce was too much, but it was spot on.  Just an  FYI, i totally did a different cooking method and  this recipe was very flexible and user friendly!  I followed the method for oven baked rice ( from this site), used raw rice that I toasted in the pan , and boiling home made chicken broth for the water. I reduced the water by half a cup to make room for the soy sauce. Then I baked it at  350* for 25 minutes or so.  My son really loves spam, sweet peas, carrots and corn, so that is what I used. Oh, how I wished I had celery, that would have rocked! Some colorful red peppers would be nice for flavor and also presentation, too.  I did not add egg as other reviewers suggested, but I am curious if I could have baked that into the rice. I will try that next time! To be fair, what I made was more of an Asian inspired rice pilaf, but I am a happy camper, so why not??? I would have never thought of using spam were it not for this recipe, so I am so grateful to Christine M. for posting this. We could be friends!   This recipe is such A KEEPER! Try it! As the recipe is written, it is a nice accompaniment to a spicier main dish.

Very good! My husband brought spam home from the store bc it was on sale and I had no idea what I was going to do with it.  I don't ever remember eating it before. This definitely hit the spot. I added a couple splashes of Tabasco as recommended by another reviewer and was very pleased. Thank you.

Very nice recipe, although I had to use dill instead of green onions and beans in tomato sauce instead of snow beans. Also added some sweet smoked paprika. Despite the changes, tastes great, thanks for sharing it.

Wonderful. For a healthier version, I used only a few strips of bacon (keeping the grease, though) and added shrimp. Serve with a spicy finadene (guam ponzu-type sauce). Yummy!
