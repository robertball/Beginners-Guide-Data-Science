At first I was disappointed with this recipe. It was mushy and it didn't really taste like meatloaf. However, my first impression was wrong. After setting in the refrigerator overnight I made a sandwich, with a little catsup on it and it was soooo good. It did taste like meatloaf & although it still wasn't firm enough, the next time I make it I am going to try adding a little extra bread crumbs or a few crushed saltines or maybe I just need to bake it a little longer.

I'm giving this 4 stars simply because once I made my own revisions, I ended up with a meal I will most certainly make again.  My changes?  I didn't have celery, so I left that out.  I sauteed the onion (a vidalia) along with the carrot (used 2), the fresh garlic, and some corn kernels.  I blended the egg with a third or so of the tofu and about a third of the breadcrumbs in the food processor.  I didn't want a perfectly blended texture, so by blending a portion and then mixing the rest of the ingredients by hand, I got a much more appetizing texture.  When the blended portion was mixed with the remainder of the ingredients, I stirred in the sauteed veggies and added a few hefty squirts of bbq sauce.  The loaf baked for about 30 minutes, then I topped it with the crushed tomatoes (left off the cheddar) and baked for 10-15 minutes more.  Came out excellent.  Ate it with rice and got 4 large servings.  Making it again this week!

I've never given an review, but felt compelled to this time since there was only one other.  This meatloaf turned out more like a tofu-loaf than a firm loaf.  After reading the only other review, I tried adding extra breadcrumbs and I added some rolled oats (approx 1 cup) but it still didn't do much for the texture.  I think the trick to this might be to forget the tofu and add something meaty like some chopped mushrooms and ground nuts.  I also baked it about 20 mins. longer than called for.  The taste was decent, it wasn't terrible, the ketchup I added to the top definitely helped.  Hope someone else has better luck.  I just think this recipe needs to be rewritten.  No tofu, more spices and more meaty stuff!!
