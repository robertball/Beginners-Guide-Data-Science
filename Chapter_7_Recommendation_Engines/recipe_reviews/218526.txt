I made these with just a couple of changes. I used Ritz crackers and topped the burgers with BBQ sauce instead of Miracle Whip. Cooked on the George Foreman grill and they turned out pretty good. They were very filling, but the meat was reminiscent of meatloaf, I guess because of the crushed crackers. I would make them again, but I would decrease or maybe even leave out the cracker crumbs.

I let my husband take over on this one, he didnt use any crackers or the egg in the beef mix. He cooked his own bacon and used texas pit bbq sauce. we didnt put any cheese on top, only in the middle with the bacon. Im not one for a super fattening meal but these were good. Hubby was over the moon!

I'm a "Low Carb" man and although I occasionally have bread and such... I wanted to try this burger with a bun.
It was great.  I did go light on the BBQ Sauce, though aside from that, it's easy to prepare and a tasty twist on a classic burger.  Also, this is affordable and able to make ahead of time for freezing and enjoying on a busy day.
Cheers!

The flavor was pretty good, but my burgers fell apart when we turned them over and it took awhile to assemble since I used real bacon.

These were really good burgers!  We topped them with fried onions and the usual burger toppings.

My family and I didn't like it.  We didn't the flavor of the bbq sauce or the miracle whip. Our burgers fell apart. We will not be making these again.

I followed this recipe almost exactly as it says and everything came out perfect. The only changes I made were not using the crackers and cooking the burgers on a skillet instead of a grill. The burgers were quite simple and easy to make.

These burgers were great! I didn't use the crackers or barbecue sauce but the burgers still turned out wonderful. I also cooked the burgers on the George Foreman grill. Maybe next time I will try them on the grill.

LOVE THEM! So delicious and easy to make. I heated the bbq sauce before adding to meat mixture and used 8 saltine crackers instead of 14 as instructed per some of the reviews I read about the burgers being reminiscent of meatloaf. I did not use miracle whip or onion- my boyfriend isn't a big fan of either. I used McCormik bacon bits and they were just okay, next time I'll use real bacon or add real bacon on top. Used the George Foreman, about 5 minutes did it for each burger, 6 minutes for larger burgers. I made 3 burgers by winging the quantities a bit.

Loved it. But i made a few changes... didnt use the crackers and added onions,green peppers,some salt and pepper,and a little seasoning salt to the meat, mixed it all together then pressed the patties out. I also used real thick cut bacon instead of the bacon bits.
