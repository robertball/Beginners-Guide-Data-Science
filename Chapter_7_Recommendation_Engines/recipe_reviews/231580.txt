Good when eaten warm right out of the oven, but not so much the next day.  Oven time was only 35 minutes.

My raison d'être was to find a use for half-a-dozen big old apples. When I saw the title I knew I'd also found meaning for some lonely freezer-burned tortillas. 
?Warmed the peeled apple chunks/slices on the stove with the cinnamon and HALF the sugar to get a nice juicy 
     thing going.
? Folded that into the cream cheese mixture.     
? Rolled up two regular-sized whole wheat tortillas. 
? Drizzled 2+ Tablespoons of the the hot/warm sauce over each.  
?Threw in toaster oven for 15 mins. @ usual setting for toast. Probably should have allowed the apple mix to cool 
     before adding it to the cream cheese but...
        • It was pure heaven. Absolutely Supreme. The sauce had caramelized into a deep, dark exquisitely gooey chew.
        • Knowing it was low in sugar, fat and calories made it taste extra yummy and delicious!    
        • Even better - knowing it was mostly pretty good for me! 
 ?? A definite keeper! 
Refriggerated the remaining Apples and CreamCheese Mix for another delicious dessert or tea-time snack tomorrow! Or maybe breakfast...

I just made this and it’s awesome!  The only thing I changed up is using a masher to break up the apple slices in the pie filling since I didn’t want any big chunks.  I did find it just a bit too sweet so I think I’ll cut back on the confectioners sugar next time.  This is definitely an easy recipe that could wow a crowd!

I loved this recipe. Made it for a family gathering, and it was a hit. Cooked a little less time than specified, about 40 minutes, watched until it browned nicely. Any longer and the sugar pour-over would be burnt. Keep an eye on it towards the end. The cream cheese mixed with apples made it creamy and nice. Just sweet enough. Added ice cream on top while still warm. Had leftovers, gobbled up next day. Another reviewer said next day, not so good, but we liked it both days. Maybe make sure the sugar mixture covered everything, then there would not be any crunchy edges. Will make this again!!

I found this very easy to put together and so beautiful after baking.  I took it to a potluck and cut each roll into smaller pieces.  What a huge hit!  No idea how it tasted the next day because there wasn't any left.

I was having company and was searching for an  easy dessert. This was simple, yet delicious!!  I had made cilantro lime chicken tacos in the crockpot for dinner. This was a great way to end a delicious meal. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Leftovers are just as good,  warmed in the microwave.  The recipe is perfect just as written...enjoy!!!

Wasn’t quite the taste I was looking for but will make it again and give it a second chance.  I would also cut back on the cooking time like other reviewers have suggested.

I made this recipe for New Year’s Eve party, it was a huge hit. 
I cut it in half and made 5 tortillas. It was plenty of food for 12 people with a few other desserts as well. I will definitely are this again. Did not change anything with the ingredients.

Just ok, the tortillas didn't bake up enough.  Would be better if the sweet and tartness of the apples was the main flavor, perhaps make more of the apple filling.

Very yummy. I used 3 cups homemade apple sauce instead of the pie filling because I had apples to use up. The filling was really runny, but worked well when cooked. The sauce was good. I like that it was thicker than the other apple enchilada recipe I make.

Yummy recipe, but it made way more filling than I expected. Way more than just a 13x9” pan. And they stuck to the bottom of the pans so that they were difficult to get out. They were very impressive for our little dinner party and I’d definitely make them again.

I did not have pie filling so I substituted 3 chopped gala apples which has less sugar too.  Then added 1/4 c half & half to sauce because I like more sauce. All turned out delicious.
