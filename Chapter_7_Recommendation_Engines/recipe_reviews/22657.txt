My family LOVES this recipe (all vegetarians/vegans) I do change quite a bit:  Make tofu part as directed ( I now use the vaccuum packed super-firm tofu and you don't need to drain it.  "Stuffing" is Awesome Sausage, Apple and Cranberry Stuffing from this site (I use tofurkey brand apple sage sausage and veggie broth).  Place stuffing on a 9x13" pan molded into a half sphere.  Cover this with the tofurkey mixture.  I use the maple glaze from the allrecipe called "Maple Roast Turkey" by Lipo.  The glaze is WONDERFUL!!!  I have made this the last 3 to 4 years at the holidays and have had to make a bigger batch as even the meat eaters are gobbling it down.  Best vegan gravy is Ann Gentry's Golden Gravy from her Real Food Daily cookbook.  Yum!

It was dry, no flavor and I had to use my ingenuity and redo this entire recipe.  I started by marinating the tofu overnight and adding many spices, added fresh parlsey to everything,(rubbed sage, powedered sage, garlic & onion powder, oregano, chives, marjoram, savory, salt and pepper and made a moist stuffing in accordance with the quantities you are asked to use in the recipe label and increased the margarine and liquid content by more than double in accordance; adding onions, celery and mushroom to stuffing and spices also.  Made a Vegan Gravy adding fresh parsley and all of the above spices and was added to stuffing and used as a sauce over the tofurkey.  It was a hit for 54 employees - some who have never tasted Tofu before.

WOW!  This recipe is wonderful for vegan and vegetarians at holiday time--especially Thanksgiving.  It looked and tasted great--my seriously VEGAN son was thrilled and impressed!  By doubling the tofu mixture, we were able to serve more; we just added a little extra oven time.  We used our usual stuffing recipe, but made with soy margarine as suggested and it seemed more traditional for us (we add finely diced celery, onions, mushrooms, apples and red peppers in iron skillet).  This seems fussy and complicated, but it is really simple.  This is much better than any store-bought version and is much cheaper, too! THANKS!

This was surprisingly good!  I was reading the reviews before I printed the recipe out and they got my hopes up.  But when I started making it I was like woah, this doesn't look anything like I pictured and I was just sure that the paper towel thing wasn't going to work.  But I kept going, if it didn't turn out oh well.  So when it was time to take it out of the fridge the paper towels came off just fine!  I was like wahoo, but will it taste ok because i was kinda having trouble with the stuffing.  I took ya'lls advice and changed the glaze, I used a cranberry glaze, the "turkey" turned out awesome, my mom and I were so pleased.  I highly recommend that u try it!

This was a really great recipe. Very delicious and flavourful. My first Thanksgiving since going vegetarian and I didn't even miss the turkey.

This is a really easy and great recipe.
I read some of the reviews before making this for my son who is vegan. BEWARE to those who are planning on using boxed stuffing mixes as recommended by some reviews.  Lots of them have added dried chicken or turkey for flavoring and most of them contain gelatin.  Check box ingredients first if staying vegan.

I've made this recipe for my boyfriend last Christmas, as well as his family - 3 out of which are vegetarian.  The recipe turned out great and they all enjoyed it.  As a meat-eater myself, I was slightly hesitant but it was pretty good.  Definitely a recipe I would recommend if you want to make that extra effort for your vegetarian friends and/or family.

Two suggestions:  1) Use extra firm tofu - a little harder to work with, but doesn't crack as much; and, 2) I simply use turkey Stove-Top stuffing, eliminating Step #2 (just prepare as it says on the box) - easier and tastes great!

This is becoming one of my favorite recipes and I've made it for two Thanksgivings in a row. It really is rather easy to make and non-vegetarians like it too!

I would give this ten stars if I could! It was surprisingly easy and really delicious. A must-try for all vegetarians and adventurous non-veggies.

The amount of water didn't seem to be enough for the dry stuffing.  Next time I'll use boxed stuffing mix instead.  The glaze and the tofu crust turned out really really yummy though.  I even used the same glaze for chicken marinate.  Will definitely make it again for my veggie friends and family.

Glaze was bland, tofu even more bland.  Glaze started to burn very quickly.

mmmmmm.. such a good recipe! My sister was bemoaning the fact that the store-bought Tofu-Turkey doesn't have a good taste.. and was very happy to taste that mine was so delicious! Though I got some funny looks because it looks like a brain from the outside.. once my non-vegan family tasted a bit of it, they were immediately surprised at the amazing taste. My mother even said that it tasted like real turkey!

This definitely passed the non-vegetarian test. Family loved it and it proved an alternative for vegetarian friends and family members. It was very easy to prepare. Instead of using the paper towels per the recipe i used cheesecloth. Adjusted the glaze just a bit as we do not eat mustard or barbeque sauce. There were no leftovers!

The flavor was very good. Next time I would drain the tofu for a while & try to squeeze out some of the liquid. It was very light, fluffy & a little too wet, almost like a ricotta cheese filling for lasagna. I found it difficult to prepare as a loaf and would probably just make a casserole with the stuffing on the bottom & tofu mixture on top. Delicious flavor though, I will make again for sure.

I didn't know it was possible to kill a bird made of tofu, but I did. Mine too, went flat in the oven. I froze the tofu over night, to make it firmer as well. I gave 2 stars because the glaze was good. I'll use it for something else..... maybe.

this recipe is fantastic!  i have been afraid to try a tofu "turkey" recipe, but i love this one!  i didn't have marjoram or savory, so i used some sage and poultry seasoning instead. also, you have to watch *carefully* when broiling. (i burned mine just a bit.)  i'm going to make this again just for fun!!

This is so easy to make, especially for someone who has never worked with tofu before.  Everyone at our buffet praised it, especially the meat eaters who didn't realize it was tofu but thought it was turkey breast!

i wish i could give this a higher rating. i was thankful for other reviewers, since it at least gave me a good place to start. i added poultry seasoning as well as thyme, sea salt, and pepper to the tofu; i actually made this twice, on thanksgiving and a few days later. both times i had to use firm tofu, and i'm not sure xtra firm would have made a difference. the mold worked very well, but i'd recommend leaving it to chill for as long as you can; two hours was just enough the first time and not quite enough the second time. the first time i used my cranberry sauce as glaze and the second time i used the bar-b-q sauce mix; the cranberry tasted better but the bar-b-q sauce looked better. i made my own stuffing as well, so that wasn't an issue. both times there were not leftovers, but i attribute that more to the flavor lended by the stuffing. the tofu itself was mushy and not very tasty (like i said, i spiced it up as much as i could, but was afraid to go too far and wreck the blending of flavors) and didn't look very appealing on the plate. the concept here is good, but falls flat in actuality.

I was so disappointed :-(  
I followed the directions for the turkey part and used my own stuffing recipe.  I did add poultry seasoning, sage, garlic powder, salt, and pepper  before forming the tofu and it tasted ok.  The problem came when I inverted it onto the baking sheet after it sat and drained for the 2 hrs.  It absolutly did not hold its shape and spread out, kind of became a tofu pancake.  I went ahead and baked it per the recipe.  Finally when it was finished in the oven it had the texture and consinsity of a wet sponge and honestly tasted way too bland.  It never left the kitchen. 
I may try again and let the tofu drain more, might give it another whirl for Christmas or I may just order a comercial one.

Fabulous! Loved this! Great flavor, and I am a bit of a flavor snob. I took one reviewer's suggestion and skipped Step 2, and just used a store bought stuffing. I used Strawberry All-Fruit rather than orange jam fro the glaze and it was great.  My only problem was that it cracked when I inverted it onto the baking sheet. I tried to mend the crack, and it only made it worse. I was thinking it was "mendable" like dough, but it really isn't. Once it's cracked, it's cracked. But it was still great and I will definitely make it again!

I made similar recipe last year but formed "turkey" legs and wings using extra tofu and a form for a tofurukey mold. I also made dressing from day-old bread and put it in the cavity of the tofurkey, and a little coming out of the butt-end, like you'd see in a real turkey. That end crisped-up very nicely in the oven. I set it on a bed of kale with orange twists and craberries surrounding. Served with a vegan gravy with sauted button mushrooms. This is very good with cranberry sauce.

This makes a nice substitute for turkey as long as you don't really expect it to taste like turkey.  Of course there are tastier vegetarian main dishes out there but this one looks more like turkey and goes well with the traditional fixings (mashed potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce, etc).  I may make it again for Thanksgiving but probably not on any other occasion.

My family got a kick out of this!  I may have to make a bigger one next Thanksgiving.  I made a different stuffing, because the one in this recipe was very close to my mom's recipe, and I wanted everyone to try the tofu...the method worked perfectly, and the glaze was a hit!

I was relly looking forward to this, red all teh reviews and followed advice. I even boiled my tofu in veggie soup and then blendarized before moulding it into shape. It did not taste very good (and I love tofu!) and I was a bit embarssed to have made for thanksgiving dinner. Would not make it again,

Didn't have a lot of the ingredients, so messed around with this recipe a bit. Interestingly, using regular tofu rather than extra firm didn't cause any 'brain-like' cracking and was incredibly moist. Had to change the paper towels every half hour though. My glaze ended up being grapefruit juice, soysauce and ketchup, which smelled weird, but made it exactly the color of real turkey skin. Heed all the warnings about burning fast on broil!!

Extremely good recipe. It may sound confusing but it's simple. I've been using this recipe for 3 years now for both Thanksgiving and Christmas to take to my family. I even have some die hard meat eaters who like it.

I made this for our family Thanksgiving. We were all very surprised that it tasted so good. This will definitely become a Thanksgiving tradition in our house!

Tried this for the first time today just to see what it would be like.  However when it cooked the tofu part just didn't seem as firm or "meaty" as I thought it would be. It came out similar to firm scrambled eggs.  Did I do something wrong? Or is this the way its supposed to be?  I would love for it to be more meatier. I'm thinking if I freeze the tofu first.  Also when I had the tofu mixture in the strainer with the paper towels, no liquid came from it at all.  Would love to get some feedback & thanks for the recipe!

Tastes like egg!!!!! I am a new vegetarian, and wanted to make something for the holidays. I chose this tofu "turkey" b/c it did not call for soy sauce as most recipes do. What a disappointment. It tasted like an egg. Maybe I'll make it when I feel like having a "quiche".

I love this recipe! I made it for the non-meat eaters in my family but as it turns out even the meat eaters enjoyed it. The only thing I would suggest is to not use as much dry stuffing. It made way to much. I was a little scared that it would not taste good because it had some strange ingerdients for the glaze but it was amazing.

I'd love to give a better review since others have loved it, but the only good thing about it was my mum's homemade stuffing inside of it. I'm a vegetarian and usually love tofu but next turkey dinner I'll just stick to stuffing, yams, mashed potatoes, and pumpkin pie.

Ps. It was perfectly shaped and looked great ...to bad the taste was bland.

Made this for my sis and a couple of friends who are vegetarian and they were very happy with it.  Will definitely keep on my menu for future thanksgivings.

Easy! I used gluten-free flour, subbed in vegan eggs, and used organic coconut sugar instead. (I also played a bit by adding 1/4 tsps of ginger powder and turmeric.) My meat-and-dairy family and friends loved it! (Had to bake it approx 15 minutes longer to get the middle fully cooked.) Enjoy!

I make it every Thanksgiving. I have vegetarians in the family. Everyone loves it. Tofu does not have a lot of flavor, that is why important to add spices. Everything comes together nicely. Planning to make it this year as well.

Pretty good! The tofu was bland, but I loved the technique.  It looked beautiful at the table and it was a lot of fun pretending we were carving a bird.
