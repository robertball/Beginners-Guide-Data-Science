Made these this morning and they were lovely with a soft center. I serve these with honey mustard dip on a bed of romaine. Also, it did not take long to clean up afterwards!! Cheers for posting this John. :)

Thanks Chef John. I like finding different meals that aren't common. When I saw your recipe I was inspired to make this; what could be better than eggs and deep fried sausage! Mine turned out perfect. I followed the instructions to the letter. I'll make these again for sure. I served mine with a Goat cheese Beet salad.

Chef John it right!  (As usual)  Having a soft center makes all the difference!  How lusciously sexy!  These are terrific!!!  Be sure to make the sauce as well, it enhances the flavor to a screaming sensation!

I followed the techniques used here, but used ingredients I had available. They turned out great! My Scottish boyfriend was impressed and was especially amazed that I managed to cook everything through and still have runny centers. This was my first time making (and eating!) scotch eggs. I will make these again for sure. The soft boiled eggs will generally peel better the colder they are. I added ice cubes to my cold water to help them get to room temperature fast. When peeling the eggs, just be gentle- a light hand is good. The colder they are the less likely they will come apart and, even if they do, as long as the middle dosent burst the egg can still be used. I even find peeling them submerged in the cold water a bit easier than on the counter.

Just went an extra minute on the egg part at my wifes request, wanted the yolks a little less runny. I made the dip with a honey Dijon and mayo with the cayenne. Bought an Italian style bread crumb that had some romano cheese in it. Great recipe, great results and great tasting, you never let me (us) down Chef John ;)

Made it again this time  8 eggs in more water on stove for 7 min then covered with fire off for 8 mins . Did not work out. The yolks were set. The sausage I used were white colored German ones which were tasteless. Use brown ones. Add some more chillies and condiments to make it tasty. Made the sausage  crust very thick this does not taste nice . Make it thin. 8/11/15

I make these all the time. Everyone here loves them. Breakfast in a bite! And the perfect hangover food. In the warmer months I cook them on the grill instead of frying or baking, gives them added smokiness.

Loved this recipe.  I made my own homemade sausages which I've gotten really good at.  And decided to make these scotch eggs. Wow, did they turn out delicious!!!! The soft boiled eggs really made it for me.  With the panko breading making it it crunchy, savory, and creamy.  This is a great anytime recipe!  You have got to try this one!

I saw this in a movie, and had to know what Scotch eggs were. A few hints:

1. Make the sausage super thin. As thin as possible.
2. Cook a few extra eggs. They are soft, so they break easily while peeling. For any extras that break, just serve them plain on toast.

Fantastic!  I have made these several times.  So good and his tips on the perfect soft boiled egg are so helpful!  I tried these last week using my new air fryer...wonderful!  I have changed them up using italian bread crumbs, regular, and panko.  Depending on your taste, all were incredible.  Will be on our plates Christmas morning.

Was very good but I will roll the sausage around the egg a little thinner next time because it took too long to cook when it was thicker

This is absolutely incredibly delicious!  Made this for brunch for Hubby and I.  Made as written except for the Italian sweet sausage, I used the Elk Breakfast Sausage we have in our game freezer. I served with Chef John’s wonderful Sauce he suggested in the video & an English Muffin.  Hubby was totally impressed with this dish, he made strange noises with every bite!!! Once again, Chef John knocks another recipe out of the park for us!! Tonight we are going to try Chef John’s Shrimp & Grits for dinner. Thanks for the wonderful recipes Chef John, keep ‘em coming!

A good recipe,  but I would find a low sodium sausage and add a little chives or green onion to the sausage to give a little more kick to the palate.

I've been making these for years, but always deep fried them rather than baked and used "hard boiled" eggs... today I decided to try baking them instead and was hoping to have the "molten centers" like Chef John... but while there was still some moistness to the yolk of the eggs they were done more on the hard boiled side then soft... but still very good.  To answer the question of on reviewer I found that by doing a doubling the flour, egg, then bread crumbs dipping it helped to prevent the meat from cracking open and showing the egg during the baking process. I made 4 of these this morning thinking I would have a couple of them for later this afternoon as a snack... but roommate loved them so well he ate three of them.... no left overs today :-)

I've always been too intimidated to make Scotch Eggs myself. They ARE a pain. I don't know if I have a delicate enough touch for them. That being said, I succeeded with this recipe after much bumbling, and the results were amazing. Thanks for another winner, Chef John!

I was skeptical on this recipe for a couple reasons, especially when the first egg proved difficult to peel. But the timing on both the soft boil and frying of the eggs was spot on! Just take your time when wrapping the eggs and be gentle rolling to coat and the results are great indeed. I didn't make the aioli because the yolk alone gave the creamy texture I wanted to contrast the crisp panko crust. Great set of instructions on this one chef John!

Egg steaming technique left me with eggs so soft they collapsed when I tried to peel them, making a huge mess. Not happy about that. There is maybe good reason to use boiled eggs for something like this.

My husband is still going on about this!  He said it didnt need a sauce, but great just plain.  Served it for a weekend breakfast with hash brown waffles. Now he wants it for dinner, so I will make it again with a side of asparagus and a tomato salad, maybe?  
UPDATE: I saw another recipe that used bacon wrapped around the sausage, no bread crumbs, and another using partially cooked bacon wrapped around sausage and then breadcrumbs.  Maybe next time.  Also:  if you need to reheat, do it in a very low oven.  Freezing not recommended, but will keep(before frying) several days.  
Note:  I didn't have a fryer or a temp. gauge but found out you can use a saucepan, as I did, and fry a cube of bread.  If it browns in about 1 minute, then you should be good to go.

We sold a LOT of these at the restaurant we owned. Always served with sausage gravy.  We called them Rooster Jewels to go along with our restaurant name. Try steaming newer eggs for easier peeling.

We halved the recipe to make 3 eggs which were more than enough to fill 2 adults. This was my first time having scotch eggs and definitely will not be my last time. We will make this same recipe again.

These were great with beer and other pub favorites served along side. We did use ranch and stone ground mustard to dip in.

I made these to the instructions and found them very tasty.  I rarely fry and decided to bake them and found them to be just as tasty.  I did find rolling my sausage in panko, then patting by hand, putting the iegg and closing sausage over the egg worked out perfectly and I had very little mess and not as many dishes win/win in my opinion.

Eggs were VERY hard to peel... I steamed another batch and this time used Chef's tip of pouring cold water in when they're done, and shaking the pot to crack them (which he gave in another video). That made a big difference in the peelability. The soft yolks are a nice touch. They are VERY heavy, one eggs with sides is enough for 1 person. They were a ton of work and I wouldn't make again, but they were fun to try.

We love these!  They take a bit of prep but well worth for a special bday breakfast or as a party appetizer that’s a notch up from deviled eggs.

l made these for my 2 grown boys. l served them with green & butter beans and Chef John's yummy, creamy mashed potatoes the younger of the two absolutely loved it the oldest he prefers the egg separate from the meat, but he loved the balls.
l used Pork mince, black pudding, sausage meat & spices. I did not eat the balls as I don't eat pork products. Thanks Chef John for both the scotch balls & the yummiest mash  
potatoes ever

These were fun to make and the BF loved them! I cut the recipe to two eggs, used half hot Italian sausage and half hot breakfast sausage and added finely chopped poblano with the other seasonings. I then air fried them because that's my new toy. ( another recipe on AR suggested 390* for 12 min turning 1/2 way...doing it this way, steaming the egg a bit less would have better/runny yolk  results) I served them with the mayo aioli per video.  Will do again!

Delicious! Easy. Only had 4 eggs but used the full recipe, made a bigger egg. Only negative, my egg yolk cooked fully. Next time I will try Chef John's method for boiling my eggs.  Family loved it. Will make again.

It came out well. I used jumbo sized eggs because that’s what I had at the time, but smaller would have been better. The cayenne was barely detectable but i followed the recipe precisely and I’m very happy with the end result.

Ok....so I didn't exactly follow the recipe but used all of Chef Johns techniques. However....the previous evening I made Chef Johns tomato sauce and his fabulous italian meatballs that everyone loves. I reserved some of the meat mixture to make  stuffed peppers or mushrooms the next day but when I came across his recipe for Scotch eggs and being Scottish and had never tried them (I know!!  Shame on me) I decided to use the meatball recipe  to make them and they were fabulous. I also used some of the tomato sauce for dipping as well as the mayo/dijon.....yummy!!!
Next time I'll make them following the recipe but with that Chef John......you just can't go wrong!

Despite not having the seasonings called for: nutmeg, dried mustard, and cayenne pepper, this came out EXCELLENT! I think as long as you get a good quality sausage, you will do fine with this recipe. It is the first time I make this and I liked it a lot. I might reduce the amount of coating (flour, sausage, and bread crumbs) as I had a lot of leftover from those. Will definitely make it again!

Normally I like Chef John's creations. I have made scotch eggs before that have turned out perfectly. These on the other hand were destined for failure right of the bat with his egg cooking method. Eggs were no where near done enough to peel. I ended up frustrated with broken, crushed raw eggs everywhere. Tried to salvage one or two only to have them completely crush and mix with he sausage instead of staying separate in the center. Maybe you can follow this recipe with your own eggs cooking skills. Do not use his

Fairly easy to make. Husband loved them.  They really need to be eaten immediately, doesn't reheat well.

OVO-VEGETARIAN VERSION: I replaced the sausage with Lightlife plant-based Gimme Lean Ground Sausage, so the only animal product in there was the eggs. I've tried this recipe both with and without real meat, and this version tasted great and was almost as good as it was with regular sausage (maybe just a tiny bit blander). I cooked these a little longer than the recommended 6 minutes.
