Very juicy and moist drumsticks. I let them marinate over night in the citrus flavors. 15 minutes on meat for my Instant Pot and natural release was perfect. Next time I think I will try making the leftover juices in the pot into a sauce with some cornstarch.

The chicken was very moist and cooked perfectly but did not absorb any of the marinade flavors with 10 hours and turning twice. I was disappointed because it smelled fantastic.
