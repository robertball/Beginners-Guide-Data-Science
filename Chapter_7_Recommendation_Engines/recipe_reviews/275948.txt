Excellent recipe! Bonus is that it is super simple. On the first batch I cooked it 4 minutes longer to get a good brown on it which resulted in overcooked fish. Shame on me. Don't make my mistake. This recipe is perfect as written and full of flavor. This is another great recipe from what has become one of my favorite recipe submitter's on this site. You really can't go wrong with one of her recipes. 5 stars all the way and thanks againFrackFamily5 CAâ€”>CT. Until next time...

Easy-peazy!  I bought the mahi-mahi because the recipe sounded so simple but when I made it, I sprinkled powdered garlic-sriracha (made by Weber spices - you know, the barbecue people) on it instead of the salt and pepper (for an extra kick). The outside had a nice crust from the air fryer and the inside was juicy and tasty! The browned butter was a nice touch! Will DEFINITELY make this again and again!!
