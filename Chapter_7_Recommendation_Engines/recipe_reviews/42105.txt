My family loves crab and I thought this was a winner.  It was just ok.  We are from the South, so maybe we just need to stick to potatoes, eggs, mayo and spicy brown mustard in our potato salad.  Will try later and make again.

I loved this recipe and so did my family.  The eggs made it so fluffy and tasty.  Will be making this one again.

This is EXCELLENT - I added a little dill, just because i love the stuff and ALWAYS use it potato salad. SO easy and delicious - this is now a standard in my home. Thanks!

This salad was just missing something. Plus,it was just too time consuming to peel the skins off while they were hot, unless there is some secret way of doing it, it took way to long peeling it off with my fingers.  I don't think it would have made a difference if I just peeled, chopped and boiled the potatoes instead. It was just OK for us and but we won't be making it again

Much better than the Hawaii plate lunch "macaroni salad"!  Thanks for putting the recipe passed down among Hawaii families in writing.  I do add about 1/2 cup of cooked salad macaroni and much more mayo.  Everytime I make it here in CA...people love it!!!

It was good, but I think there are better uses for crab. Would not make again.

I tried this salad at a pot luck and very much enjoyed it. I made it myself and it didn't taste nearly as good. Peeling the hot potatoes was very difficult and time consuming. I don't think I'll try this one again.

Not a bad tasting potato salad, if you like black olives (salt really brings out the flavor of) you may really enjoy this one, may try again with a bit more sugar.

Loved it!  I just left the potatoes skin on added some Hawaiian sea salt and it's always a big hit with family and friends.  Thank you.

Local families in Hawaii always make this at parties and it's always a hit.  You can also use imitation crabmeat (really, it's good) or 1 can tuna if you don't have crabmeat.  A tip I got from a friend is "shredding" 1/2 (or less) an onion and mix into salad.  I also use more mayo and add some macaroni.

I loved this recipe. I used the lump crab meat from the can..it made it more better than the imitation stuff. I had trouble with the potatoes though. Overall I liked it. People at the party did, too.

This was excellent!  After boiling my potatoes, I place them under cold water, and the skins come off pretty easily.  I have been craving crab this summer, so this is a nice change from the usual crab salad!
