Outstanding - as fine as what I had in Rome with fond memories! Couldn't help but put my own spin on this by dredging the chops in flour before browning them, adding fresh sage and minced garlic as well as the rosemary, and using white wine rather than red. Also, not wanting to make a trip to the grocery store for one portobello mushroom, I substituted dried porcini mushrooms. I served this with "Risotto alla Milanese," also from this site. Simply memorable!

Two words...Classy & Elegant!!! I found a bargain on veal chops at the local grocer, and couldn't wait to try this recipe. I feel that this recipe works perfectly for veal and maybe pork chops, but NOT on any form of steak. The rosemary gives the veal/sauce a nice woody/earthy flavor that could only be pulled off on  veal or pork. The flavor would be lost to a steak or red meat of any kind. We served it with garlic herb potato wedges, and my husband was in heaven!!!!

This was by far an incredible dish and easy to make in a short time.  I did make changes and take suggestions of others.  I dip the chops in flour that I zipped up with salt, pepper,  & garlic powder.  As I browned the chops ( in a out 3tbl butter & oil) I added scallions, onions, mushrooms, fresh Rosemary, black pepper & dried sage.  Added white cooking wine & chicken broth.  I also added 3 to 4 cloves of smashed garlic for flavor.  Put in the oven at 350 for about 35 minutes in my Dutch oven pan and served with couscous.  Amazing dish with gourmet flavors.

This recipe is fabulous just as it is. I have also modified the recipe by stuffing the Veal Chop with proccuetto, asiago cheese, and mozzerella. My friends and family loved it, made both ways.

Wasn't sure if this would be a big hit, but it was at our house.  It was so delicious!  Thought I was at a fancy restaurant eating at a gourmet italian restaurant.  We used pretty thick white veal loin chops and the rest of the recipe did not need much tweaking. I added a pinch sage and that was about it.  I didn't put garlic in it as I didn't want to compromise the taste with the rosemary and red wine.  Let me tell you I'll be inviting all my picky friends to dinner for this fine meal real soon. Thank you for posting it here.  Yum Yum!

This was excellent!  I did not have veal chops on hand, but I did have a good quality filet mignon that I used.  I cooked the steak until very pink, rmoved them and set them aside while I made the sauce and the sides, then returned them to the pan to get to a medium rare doneness.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes and salad.  My only mistake was that I seasoned the steak with salt and pepper before cooking, and it did make it a little salty.  No wonder the recipes says not to!  :) Will absolutely make again!

This recipe was something special. I usually just grill or broil veal chops - this was only a bit more work, but looked and tasted incredible. I did use dried instead of fresh rosemary, because that's what I had in the house.

Excellent recipe.  I actually ended up thickening up the sauce with some flour at the end, which gave it a bit more substance.

The veal ended up very tender and was excellent.

It was delicious. I added an asian flavoured chicken broth instead of plain and this added some depth to the flavours!  I will definitely make again.

Easy and tasty.  I can't believe someone called it "bland".  I served with a side salad, baked sweet potato, sliced tomatoes and  and cantaloupe with basil.  This one is saved to my recipes for future reference.

Outstanding recipe!  Just like in a fancy restaurant, only better, because I can make this anytime, at home!  I took the suggestions from Naples34102 and dredged the chops in flour, subbed in white wine instead of red, and used garlic and sage.  AMAZING!

Has potential.  Too much cooking for the veal even though I took it off aver 1 minute with the wine and 1 minute at the end as recommended.  Still was overdone. Rosemary and veal are always great together, but the portobello was almost unnoticeable.  Next time I think I'll stick to the basics and sear the veal without any simmering, topped with rosemary and either mint sauce or a thick beef reduction sauce.

We just loved this dish.   I did not have red wine so sub white and it worked great.  In error I used beef broth but it worked.   We enjoy onions with beef so I add one medium chopped up.  The sauce was not thickening up the way I like it so I mixed up some cornstarch with a little water and added  it worked perfectly.  will be making again.

I doubled the recipe and had WAY too much liquid.  It never boiled down, so I didn't have a sauce - just a pan full of liquid.  I was focused on that and didn't time the chops, which got over-done.  Next time, I'd only use about 1 3/4 cups broth, plus the wine, for 4 chops.  Good flavor, though.

Delicious!  Only wish we'd used fatter chops so there was more to eat!  Will definitely make again, probably add some shallots next time around.  Fresh Rosemary was awesome w/it.

Quick & easy dish. Took suggestions and added two garlic cloves, took chops out & covered with foil until sauce was ready. Placed chops back for 1 minute - served with angle hair pasta !

I just made this tonight.  I didn't have a portobello mushroom, so used a small can of mushrooms.  I also didn't have any red wine, but it was still just delicious!  Simple to make and delightful to eat!

Lots of flavor.  I did add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

Followed the recipe as it said, except I took the veal out after adding the wine and putting it on high(as not to overcook).  For those of you that had it to watery, have patience, put it high enough to boil and boil it down.  It will work.  Very nice taste!

Fantastic recipe!  Only addition was to add minced garlic with the rosemary and dredging the chops in a bit of flour on the second time making the recipe.  The small amount of flour from the dredging allowed the sauce to thicken more the second go around.  I paired it with gold and red gourmet small potatoes halved, sprinkled with garlic, rosemary, oregano, sage, and oven-roasted; and fresh tomatoes, onions, and mushrooms marinated in balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and basil.  Our whole family loved it!  Thanks for sharing this simple but elegant recipe!

ONe of the best recipes I've ever made. My husband actually said, "it was good." He's super picky. I will keep this one in my arsenal!Update: made this again. Really have to be careful or you will overcook the veal. Came out perfect this time when I took it out at the same time I added the red win and added it back in the last min and reheated each side about 30 sec. this one came out perfect, again! Still the best dinner I've made from this site.

This was my first time cooking veal.  The recipe was fast and easy using ingredients on hand.  I used dried rosemary and although the rosemary cooked for a while, it was still crunchy in the end; I will use fresh rosemary next time.  The red wine really never reduced, maybe you need to add flour or cornstarch in the end?  I loved the flavor of the mushrooms and rosemary.  It would even make a great side dish without the veal.  Will make again but I'll try to make the sauce thicker and use fresh rosemary.

This was delicious and so easy.  In fact, I am preparing to make it again tonight!  I took the veal off the heat, then added the mushrooms, and sauce ingredients, and added the veal back at the end.  I also served this topped with some carmelized red onions.  It went well with the purple meat :)

Sorry but we were disappointed with this recipe.  We thought it was very bland and for such an expensive type of meat, I was expecting something much more.  Thanks for letting us try

This recipe does not work with a lesser quality cut of meat.  None of my local stores had veal so I used a sirloin steak.  I don't know if the flavor was affected by the change in meat but it wasn't very tasty besides being tough. We were disappointed in this dish and will not make again.

I don’t know what went wrong. Pretty well followed the recipe to a “T”. Added some garlic and shallots. Had an old cast iron pot I used as a Dutch oven to let it simmer in. Was tough and very bland. Veal is a very mild flavour but I figured the wine, garlic etc would infuse some flavour. No such luck. My wife and I were both very disappointed. Hadn’t cooked veal in years so was really looking forward t this. Have to keep looking I guess.

I made a few adjustments. I omitted the broth, and threw in shitake mushrooms and onion, half and half. I added a few tablespoons of butter to caramelize the onions. The drippings were thickened with cornstarch...then I added the wine. The chops were set on top and kept warm. I wilted a bag of spinach with a few tablespoons of olive oil and garlic salt. It was a hit!

The most important contributions here are the step processes and the cooking times.  After that, I think one could feel confident to vary ingredients as they wish. For instance, it doesn't matter what kind of mushrooms you use, and you could substitute the rosemary with thyme, or sage.  And I used red wine because it was open but white would have been nice as well.
One big miss, in my opinion, is not including a thickening agent to the final sauce after the red wine is added. I added some Wondra flour and some butter) My chops are out after 10 minutes and resting under foil. And now I am looking at almost 2 cups of liquid that has to boil down.  Everything else is done; roasted veggies, orzo pasta. In hindsight, I would timed my sides differently. There wasn't even any time to put the chops back into the sauce, which by then is reduced and thick just how I want it- no more reduction needed. So I had to serve the chops without a second check for doneness. Lucky for me, they were medium after 3 minutes on each side, 10 minutes under simmer and out and covered for at least 10 more. Thanks for the help on this!

Delicious!! ?????? I added salt, pepper, garlic and some Sazon goya to the chops prior to browning them.  I also simmered some grape tomatoes and fresh spinach,  for the last couple of minutes ...in addition to the mushrooms.  Lastly I sautéed some green pepper, onion and more mushrooms and added them to the finished product. I served a small red potato cooked in my air fryer.  Yummy ??

This is such an easy and delicious recipe!  I've made it twice now, and the only thing I've done differently is use veal cutlet and season it with salt and ground pepper prior to cooking.  I like easy, and this is as easy and as good as it gets!

I thought that this recipe was just ok. The veal chops really didn’t have much taste at all. The taste was all in the sauce which was tasty BTW.  I think that I’d try it again and try it with chicken or pork tenderloin?  I’m not sure.

The liquid broth is really good.  I used shoulder chops, but next time i'm going to a butcher to get thick pieces of veal.  I'm going to try to make the reduction to top veal scalopini.

This is a great basic recipe, clear and simple. As always I read the reviews before I decide to try it or not. And, I used some of many reviews: a little of this, a little of that... I always find great tips in the reviews! What I don't understand is that some people say it was bland tasting. How can that be? Don't you taste your cookings while preparing? Isn't that obvious? How can you cook without tasting??? And then of course you ADD whatever you feel is missing.
So, I think this is a great recipe to start with and very easy. Add, change or substitute to your heart's desire. You will not be disappointed.

Absolutely fantastic! The only change I made was to use 2 tsp butter/2 tsp olive oil  to start and omit the tsp of olive oil at the end. So delicious...excited to make it again soon.

Awesome recipe! I did add some garlic and subbed 1/4 of a cup of pomegranate juice and 1/4th of a cup water in place of the wine.

OK. What did I do wrong? I followed the recipe to the letter, and wound up with tough old meat. It was like eating boiled mutton. Now, judging by the other comments - it must have been my fault - but I cannot think of anything I did differently. Did anyone else have a fail on this? I marked this 5 stars as I am sure its my fault they didn't turn out, not the recipe itself, but honestly, I couldn't eat it.

I added a little flour to thicken the sauce to a gravy... it wasn't bad but it's not very high on my list to repeat...

This is a grand dish. When I read some of the reviews about this dish being bland, I experimented. Removed the butter. Added 2cloves garlic with the olive oil. Browned on both sides and when adding portobello also added 1/4 cup dried porcini mushrooms to the stock, as well as 1 tbsp balsamic glaze. The red wine was a Chilean Cabernet. When cooked down, the sauce was rich, vibrant and suited the veal completely. Delicious! Will make this again for friends and family.

The sauce was extremely salty - probably should have used a low- or no-sodium chicken broth.  Also need to watch the veal chops carefully as they can easily overcook and be tough.

I made this with chicken. It was good although a tad on the bland side. i think thickening the sauce so it really stayed on would help.

I really liked this.  The grocer only had the thin veal chops so I just reduced the cooking time and left them out of the pan for a bit...and non alcoholic wine was just as nice for the sauce.  My Ol' man loved it too, thanks from both of us!

I just made this for my in-laws, my husband, and myself.  we all enjoyed it very much!  I substituted pork in place of veal chops, as my grocer did not have the veal.  It was interesting in that the wine turned the pork purple, but the taste was fantastic, particularly for the ease of preparation!
