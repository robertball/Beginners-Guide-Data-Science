I've been putting cayenne and cinnamon in my hot chocolate for years, but one other thing I add that makes it even more wonderful is about 1/8-1/4 tsp of ginger powder. Trust me...it's so delicious! Also, I don't use instant hot chocolate. I use about a cup and a half of milk, 2 tbls of cocoa powder and 2 tbls of sugar. I whisk it all together, along with the spices, over the stove. Just till blended and hot (don't boil it).

Delicious! Instead of instant cocoa I used 3 teaspoons regular cocoa and 3 teaspoons sugar, mixed in 1/2 dl of water.

I  added a shot of espresso. Too much cinnamon for me. More like a 1/4 teaspoon would be better.  I had some freshly opened cayenne so a pinch was nice and spicy. The older your pepper, the more you need. Don't recommend heating the milk to boiling point. It ruins the milk. I like to use almond milk for extra richness.

Yum!  I go to Mexico often and this is authentic!  I'd even suggest adding about 3 T boiling water to thin it out just a bit.  A real keeper.  I used Mexican cocoa instead of instant hot cocoa mix.  Tastes like it could ward off a cold, too!

This was a real treat! I used a tbsp of really good unsweetened cocoa powder and about 1 tsp superfine sugar in place of the prepared hot chocolate mix which made it even more delicious.  I even used skim milk and it was rich, creamy and satisfying, perfect for warming up after playing in the snow!  My daughter liked hers with just the cinnamon, and I probably went a little light on that in hers.

In the wintertime, I like to have a cup of hot chocolate before I go to bed at night. It's both warming and relaxing. I ran across this recipe and was apprehensive about the amount of cinnamon and the addition of cayenne. But I have seen so many cayenne/chocolate parings lately that I decided to try it. SO much better than plain hot chocolate! I WILL have this often -- thanks!

Don't let the cayenne scare you.  This hot chocolate tastes just like red hot cinnamon candy.  Or in my case, an Atomic Fire Ball because I use a BIG pinch of cayenne.

My entire family loved this. I was unsure at first but my hubby now believes this is his favorite hot drink. All three of the kids enjoyed it as well. It's a keeper. I made it just as recipe says.

Very good recipe! I made the servings for 2.  I only double the milk and cocoa mix (didn't use instant).  With 2 cups of milk; 6 tablespoons of cocoa... I used 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon and 1 pinch of cayenne pepper.  

It came out great.  It wasn't too much cinnamon and the right amount of pepper.  Me and roommate enjoyed.  I gave four stars for the amount of cinnamon recommended.  It should be 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.

I just made this for small tea cup sized portions. I didn't have cocoa mix on hand so I used cocoa and sugar as follows (again this is for small china tea cups 1 serving) 1 full tea cup milk, 1 teaspoon cocoa powder, 1 pinch cinnamon, 1 pinch red chili powder heated on lowest setting over gas stove for about 2-3 minutes or until almost at a boil! It really does taste like some of the hot cocoa I had in Mexico... I tried abuelita expecting similar things and was disappointed, this is perfect.  It has a robust complex flavor and goes well with marshmallow cream if you want a little extra sweetness. Whipped cream if you have it will be more complimenting.

I thought the cinnamon was going to be overpowering but it was a really tasty, tongue-tingling drink.  Good blend of flavors!  Sure warms you up!  Had to ding a star for instant hot chocolate mix because it has additives and other stuff in it.

My son and I made this and had mixed reviews. We'll try it again because we liked the flavour but found its richness made it unpalatable by the end of the mug. I'd up the milk to 1.5 cups. Despite adding a small amount of milk to the dry ingredients and stirring to ensure everything  was dissolved,  there were still lumps...I'd likely use a whisk and do it on the stove next time.

This was definitely spicy, and it became quite addictive while drinking. I only used 1/2 t of cinnamon; at first I thought that was too much, but I liked it the more I drank. My cocoa mix had milk in it, so I just used water.

The spices transform regular hot chocolate into a delicious drink with a nice kick. I enjoyed this different version and topped it with whipped cream. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I use cocoa and sugar instead of a mix. I use 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Mayan hot chocolate is the best hot chocolate I've ever tasted.

I used Starbucks dark hot chocolate and I prepared it by dissolving the hot cocoa in a shot of hot coffee and then added the cinnamon cayenne and a sprinkling of dryer ginger powder.i just eyeballed a the spices. I finished with some vanilla whipped cream. Amazing!! You'll be bored with regular packet hot cocoa for good!!

Oh my!  This is so good.  Love the slight texture and feel of the hot chocolate and the flavor it to die for.  I also tried this with ginger as suggested by another rater and yes, that is amazing too.  Both ways is a winner to me!
