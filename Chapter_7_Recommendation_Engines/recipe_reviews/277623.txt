Excellent as written! Honestly I thought cooking the chops in butter on the stove and then baking them for 25 minutes longer would result in completely over-cooked chops but they were perfect. The gravy took me longer than directed but I am gravy challenged so that might have been my fault. Regardless, the gravy was rich and flavorful and complimented the chops perfectly. Excellent recipe and 5 stars all the way!

Cook exactly as the recipe said. The sauce and mushrooms were delicious but the pork chops had no flavour.  Not even the sauce could help them

So I decided to double the (sauce) recipe since I usually always say, "I wish there was more sauce!"  and still only used 4 (somewhat large) bone-in pork chops.  Apparently doubling the sauce was not necessary; however,  I now have enough sauce to freeze so that next time I only need to brown and bake the pork chops.  The only changes made were not using white wine since I was out of it (just subbed with some beef broth). I do like my sauce pretty thick so I used more flour/broth mixture for thickening.  And, as I always do, added twice the amount of mushrooms...because you can never have enough mushrooms!

I loved this recipe. I did use a package of dry mushroom gravy with the wine and water, but no flour. Also I used a chicken boullion cube instead of broth! Will definitely make again! Wish I took a pix!

The mushroom gravy was excellent. I decided to overnight brine the chops in vegetable broth, brown sugar, kosher salt, black peppercorns, and ice and then grill them instead of baking. The brine added a great flavor to the chops and kept them moist during thg he grilling phase.

Not  what I thought. Maybe the beef bouillion cube would have made a difference? The gravy was thinner than I thought (I even cooked it longer). It was pretty good, but not 5 stars.
