This was so easy and tasted so good!  I couldn't find Chinese wheat noodles so I had to make a few small adjustments.  I served this with rice.  We don't care for bean sprouts so I used celery for the crunch.  Because I didn't use the noodles the sauce didn't self thicken so I mixed a half tsp of cornstarch in cold water and stirred that in.  The flavors blended perfectly and my son said no more take out.  Thanks, Ms Kingsley!

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  The ginger really makes a difference.  We added shiitake mushrooms, and some more vegetables and we loved it.  We will definitely make it again.

I followed the recipe - maybe added a bit more oyster sauce and it turned out really good - my hubby even liked it and he usually doesn't like my stirfrys - we had it over ramen noodles - and all I added extra was a small can of Chinese veggies -because I didn't have an fresh bean sprouts  - will be making this dish again!!

This recipe has become one of my favorites. I did make minor changes to my liking such as adding extra garlic and ginger for bold flavors along with assorted vegetables (carrots, bell pepper, broccoli, snap peas, and mushrooms). I also added half a teaspoon of sugar to bind the taste along with dash of red chili flakes for some kick. I tasted just like what you get from the take out and will continue to make more.

I made this for dinner yesterday and it was terrific!  My husband and 4 year old loved it. I wonder if you could substitute the noodles for white rice???
