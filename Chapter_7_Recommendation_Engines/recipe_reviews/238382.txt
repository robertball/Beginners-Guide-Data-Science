It came out great! I made it twice, the second time I substituted cardamom with a mixture of equal amounts of Nutmeg and Cinnamon. It tasted just as good!

This recipe is perfect as it is, I wouldnt change anything in it. I put 1tsp ground cardamom as I didnt had whole on hand. With nuts on top it's delicious

I made this at Christmas and I must admit I did not have any as I do not like anything flavoured with Rose Water (or flowery stuff in general). HOWEVER, those who ate it (including my hubby who IS a fan, said it was delicious!

One thing I did was pour it out of the pan through a strainer to ensure there were not clumps of anything before putting it in my ramekins and setting it - the final product was smooth as a baby's bum! :-)

Very tasty, but the preparation caused me a fair amount of distress because the mixture started to stick and burn at the bottom of the saucepan, leaving unpleasant chunks of stuff in the pudding. I strained the mixture after cooking (I don't know if it was as thick as it should have been). Regardless, it was well-flavored and delightful to eat after going through all that.
