This was a REALLY good dip for pita bread & pita chips, especially after sitting for an hour, so that flavors could meld. It would also be excellent as a sandwich spread. I used a mini food processor to get a creamy smooth texture, which I preferred to the small curds version. I tried it 3 ways: as written; with 1/3 less butter, and with yogurt instead of butter. The yogurt version's consistency was more liquid & lacked the rich taste of butter. It was still VERY good in its own right though. An excellent & healthy alternative for those who want/need to reduce butter consumption. The other 2 ways were so similar in taste & texture, that I'd make this again with only half the butter. We tasted it as recipe was written; all of us really liked the fresh herby taste. Later I added more cilantro & jalapeno for stronger flavor. I agree with Josephine that this could accompany a Greek meal, or any Middle Eastern meal, for that matter (especially if yogurt is used for some or all of the butter).

And the winner is... This is so different from what I susally make, my guests were pleasantly surprised. I reduced the amount of butter I used because of health reasons. That's the only change I made. We are definitely dill fans and the dill flavor was very refreshing. I don't do hot, so I made two versions. One as written with a mild amount of minced jalapeno pepper and the second dish had only a slight amount. Since more of the spicier version was eaten, I think my guests may have perferred the spicier one. I put the spread in the center of my Lazy Susan and around it I placed triangles and other shapes of a variety of very flavorful breads. I used Dill Rye, Sundried tomato & Basil bread, Smoked Swiss cheese bread. I had bread sticks, pita triangles, and several kinds of crackers. The spread has almost a summery, back yard taste. This certainly is a keeper for our family.

I made this with "Peppy's Pita Bread" and it was DELICIOUS! The taste was very refreshing for a warm spring day. My husband bought large curd cottage cheese so I had to add milk to make it less chuncky. Also, I only used 1/4 jalapeno because 4 and 1 year old were eating it too. Lastly, I added a squirt of lemon. Wonderful dish! Although its not Greek, I think this would be a lovely addition to my Greek themed meals. Thank you Traci B for sharing such a unique recipe. ***UPDATE*** Next time I'll try this with "Syrian Bread."

I didn't change a thing.  However unless I am entertaining next time I will cut it in half just for myself.  I don't care for Pita chips so I used the 2 x 2 inch deli breads.  I had pumpernickel, a light rye and whole wheat.  Fantastic Traci B.

This was so good. My boys really loved it. I only used half a jalapeno because I can't handle heat and didn't know if it would be too hot, it came out perfect for me. Also my store was out of pita bread and I didn't have time to make lavosh so I toasted some tortillas and served it with those and some Club crackers. Thanks for the recipe. I'll be making this again.

I can't believe I didn't leave a review when I made this!  I served this at a Christening party and it was very well received.  I had made whole wheat pita bread chips and the combination was excellent.  Thanks Traci.

I admit I had never heard of Jagic...until I hit this site looking for something new to try. I really loved it. I'm giving it 5 stars because I really enjoyed the flavor combos-exactly my taste. A keeper for me, thanks for sharing!

Note from Recipe Submitter:  The amounts in this recipe can be played with; this was submitted according to the traditional recipe my Mom has written but I like to "up" the dill and hot peppers.. I also pulse in a micro blender for a few seconds to give it a smoother apprearance.  :)

This is seriously delicious.  I added most of the herbs and the celery to the food processor, with the butter and cottage cheese.  I also did a hand mince on some of the onions and herbs.  That way the dip was a lovely pale green, and had little chunks of the ingredients.  I only used one and a half sticks of butter, and will probably only use one next time.  Thanks Traci B's Kitchen, so sharing something delicious and unique with all of us!

Delicious!  I think next time I might add another jalapeno but it was very good as written.  I also "creamed" the cottage cheese to remove the curds.  It was the hit of all the appetizers at Easter dinner.

I made this for chips--potato and tortilla for a get together with old friends. I blended up the cottage cheese and the butter, along with the jalapeno and herbs. I don't like the texture of cottage cheese too much, and wanted it to be more like a chip dip. It worked great, people were surprised that it was cottage cheese and butter. The first tastes that day were pleasant like having something very fresh, it was after you swallowed that the jalapeno pleasantly hit your taste buds. This made so much that I took it to another get together the next day were the jalapeno and other herbs it was more incorporated. The men folk loved it, and people did want to know what was in it.

Very, very tasty!  Made mine & ate with pita bread and next time looking forward to making lavosh as recommended.  The longer it sits, the better it gets.  Thanks Traci B for an excellent recipe!!  :)

This recipe makes a lot.  I had 20 guests, made 2 appetizers and still have one full cup leftover.  Also, I added seasoned salt...started with a light sprinkle then added 1/2 teas.  I also aded more dill and cilantro (my family loves cilantro).  Next time I will half the cottage cheege/butter and double or triple the dill, cilantro and jalepeno (which was barely noticeable)

Very very nice.  I made this up around lunch time but didn't serve with lunch; I let it sit in the fridge for awhile and served with dinner.  Bf thought it was a bit bland but I didn't really measure the spices--just tossed them in,  forgot the salt, and didn't put as much jalapeno (I'm not a huge fan)--so I am quite certain that's my fault, not the recipe's.  I really liked it all in all.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent.  I didn't have celery so I left that out, but otherwise made the exact recipe.  I served with both tortilla chips and bread...it was much better on the bread.

Thanks for the great recipe - Traci B.  This spread is quick and easy to make, not to mention delicious.  My daughter and I made this yesterday for the Recipe Group.  We thought we'd used 2% cottage cheese and go for the gusto, since there was already a cup of butter in the ingredients.  Prefer the pita chips, but will try with homemade lavosh ( the store bought isn't great).  I also think this would be nice with a platter of fresh veggies.  The recipe also said it served 20, for us it was 4 adults and 2 small children (lol).

Oh YUM!! This is going to be made over and over at my house.  I used dill that I had in the freezer because I couldn't wait until June (when I can get fresh dill)to try this recipe. All the flavors are sooooo good together!

Great recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and let it sit for about an hour. Served it with pita chips and lavash.
