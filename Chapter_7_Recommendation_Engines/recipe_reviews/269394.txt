A lovely, easy recipe, which I followed to the letter.   The Dijon is the key to this, I think.  Also, I believe that searing the salmon first acts as a sealant to keep it moist.  I wouldn’t skip this step.  As far as “dirtying a skillet” is concerned, most skillets are oven safe, so flip over that salmon, slather on the Dijon, press on the topping, and shove the whole thing in the oven.  Couldn’t be simpler or more delicious.  Thanks for posting.

Followed all ingredients and cooking directions. Since my fillets were various sizes, I adjusted the searing and baking time. Salmon turned out perfect and it was a hit!

OMG!!!  OMG!!!  This is wonderful.  I have used many recipes from this site, but this is only my second review.  The only change I made was to take the advice of the person who said to forget searing and just put olive oil on the skin side and then just bake.  No point in dirtying up a skillet.  Everything else was by the recipe.  Served with a side of asparagus and dinner salad.  This is the kind of meal you get at a 5 star restaurant.

I liked it, but I prefer fish to be a little less .... wet? juicy? If I make it again, I might skip the mustard so that it's a little more dry. Good flavor, though!!

Another salmon recipe that’s a hit with my husband.  Made the recipe as written, but only made  two servings.  I would double the topping for four servings.  The Dijon was a nice change of flavor.

Delicious! I would make double the topping amount for 4 salmon fillets. The recipe topping amount worked well for 2 fillets.

Really REALLY good as written. Don't be shy with dijon.  Used a large cast iron pan and skin came out really crispy and virtually no cleanup. Will definately make again

I used regular breadcrumbs not Panko crumbs. I would have put an additional tbsp of butter in the mixture. Overall, it was delicious and a real crowd pleaser.

Great recipe! I made it as written except I put the Dijon mustard on the salmon as needed to coat the top of it before I sprinkled on the topping.. so 2 tbs wasn’t enough.

Great recipe.   Using Dijon as the "glue" for the crumbs saves lots of calories too!   Will be making again for sure!

I made this for dinner this evening, and both my hubby and I loved it.  It is easy, quick to make, and delicious.  I made no changes and will definitely make it again.

What a wonderful thing to do to salmon!  I used a 1 pound salmon filet that I cooked for 15 minutes, but otherwise followed the recipe.  The flavor is magnificent.

The mustard, pistachio and parmesan all balance the flavor of the salmon and complement it.

For wine, I had a nice German Kabinett.  The slight sweetness of this elegant wine worked well with the flavors in the recipe.  German wines are a bit undiscovered, and do better with many entrées than do dry whites.

I’m not a fan of salmon, or most fish, but my 15 year old son is and I acknowledge the benefits of eating this fish. Needless to say there were no leftovers. I highly approve of this recipe and ate my portion and he had seconds.

Made this but baked it in the oven and doubled the amount of fish. Same temp and 8 minutes longer. Massaged skin side with EVOO and placed on foil to bake. Six adults and four little ones consumed nearly two fillets.. Excellent
