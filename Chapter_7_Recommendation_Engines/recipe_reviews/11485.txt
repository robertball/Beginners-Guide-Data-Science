This was a great way to get rid of some apple butter! The batter was very soft, and my cookies were a little flatter than I had hoped, but they tasted great. I only cooked them 8 minutes as 10 was too much, and this reciped yielded 13 dozen for me. I'm not sure I would lable this as nutritious, but certainly a great snack on a fall day. Not so great in the summer--I'll freeze them for some cooler weather.

I'm sorry but I can only give this two stars.  The taste wasn't bad, but I lightly greased my cookie sheets and they still stuck like mad.  Also, the cookies spread so thin they were almost like pancakes...so sad.

This was a nice, soft cookie. Thought the apple butter flavor could have been a little more intense. But they were still very good. I, also, added a little powder sugar drizzle after they cooled.

I thought these were excellent. I have to admit, I was a little bit skeptical when my dough was finished. It was very loose - more like a thick batter. I refrigerated my dough overnight and it firmed up nicely. I'd suggest using parchment paper with these. They come off the sheet beautifully. I used a small cookie scoop which made perfectly uniform-sized round cookies. These do spread - you'd have to expect this with any dough that includes fruit puree or butters. The edges of the finished cookies are slightly chewy and the cookies are soft, as promised. We really enjoyed these. They were a nice was to use up some homemade apple butter. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

I made the batter exactly following the recipe.  I baked this in a 9X13 cake pan and frosted with buttercream.  Absolutely delicious!  My husband said fantastic!  I baked at 350 degrees for about 45 min.

Old Fashioned, soft and spicy.  Not overly sweet in spite of all of the sugar.  I followed the recipe exactly and everyone enjoyed the cookies.  If I were to make these again, I would consider adding shredded apple or those dried fruit bits.

Not impressed. I made a half recipe. The only changes were some white sugar for the brown (didn't have enough), spicy tea for the coffee (used slightly more), raisins for the walnuts (plumped in the additional tea I used) and 1/4 cup more flour (to compensate for the extra liquid). I didn't have any major spreading or sticking issues (I greased my cookie sheets). I think the timing is a little off- start checking at 8 mins if you make TBspfuls of dough. These were cake-like with slightly crisp edges, though their flavour was bland and lacking. Not something I'd make again.

Someone gave me a jar of apple butter that I didn't want to waste even though I don't like it.  I also don't like nutmeg but my hubby loves cookies and I'm a rule follower so I made these cookies for him exactly as the recipe says.  We both loved them! The small amount of nutmeg gives them just a bit of zip. Though my husband generally prefers very thin, crisp cookies, he can't enough of these. Not sure if I'll make them again but this was definitely a very pleasant surprise!

Quite easy to make and very, very good. I put the coffee in my first batch but it seemed to curdle the batter so I started over and left it out. Didnâ€™t miss it at all.

Bottom just burnt and the top was soft and fluffy...like a muffin. I tried salvaging the recipe several different ways to no avail.

Made these and iced them with cream cheese frosting. Everyone love them.
