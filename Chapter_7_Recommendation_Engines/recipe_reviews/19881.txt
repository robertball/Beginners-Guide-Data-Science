Yummy. I had to cut this recipe way down in order to fit it into my ice cream maker. This tastes great, didn't take long to set, and has a good consistency. I really don't think it needs the maple flavor. I also think this would be great with the honey grapenuts. Think I'll try that next. I chilled the mixture for a day before I made the ice cream. That helps.

Very good! I used Lowfat milk, and it came out watery, but nevertheless a winner!

Like one of the reviewers, I cut the recipe down to fit into my ice cream maker. It came out a bit liquidy, but still firm enough to eat as ice cream :)  I also crushed cheerios and used them instead of the grape nuts. Oh, and I used maple syrup instead of extract which I thought made this pretty flavorful.  Topped with nuts!
