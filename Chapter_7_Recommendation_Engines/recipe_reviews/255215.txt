Okay so I used regular jumbo hamburger buns instead of fresh bread but these were still delicious. Extra napkin indeed! I should have paid more attention to the directions when it came time to assemble the burger because I had a heck of a time getting everything to stay on which was my own fault. I've always felt bacon and avocado pair well together  and the horseradish was an extra bonus. While eating my burger it dawned on me that a fried egg would pair well with the other ingredients and top the burger off nicely too. Regardless, this is good as written. Thanks for sharing!
