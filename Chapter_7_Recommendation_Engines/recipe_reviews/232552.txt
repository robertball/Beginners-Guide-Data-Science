Major crucial ingredient missing from this beef stew to be called Caldereta. Caldereta is a liver sauce based stew. So either sauté and mash beef liver into this stew or add a can of liver pâté. It changes everything for the better.

The Chorizo just melts into the tomato base and adds a ton of flavor.  Not your traditional beef stew, but it is great when you are bored of the same old stuff.  I threw this on top of steamed brown rice and it was awesome...everyone enjoyed it and it made a good leftover as well.

This was delicious! The family loved it and it was so worth the 2 hours it took. We decreased the amount of garlic, but it was so delicious. It was super hearty and pretty much a flavor punch.

5 stars for taste.  Potatoes took a long time to cook in the mixture.  Will cook them separately next time and add to the finished stew.

I love this Caldereta Filipino stew.  This taste better than Irish stew because it has more flavor.  Delicious!
