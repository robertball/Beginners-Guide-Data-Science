I prepared this in an instapot - the only thing i changed was the amount of time it cooked in the instapot.   I used all ingredients and the flavors were DELICIOUS!  My husband and kids loved it so much they're asking me to make it again.

Stayed strictly to the recipe. It turned out great! The only thing I will try next time is to reserve more of the sauce for dipping. Also my first shot at homemade tortillas...

I made it and it turned out great! The only thing I would add is to make sure its Mexican Oregano (you can get this in the ethnic spice aisle usually for 98 cents or so el guapo, etc. but it will just say "oregano"). I used canned tomatoes (fire roasted) to save time and they worked just as well. Thanks! Great recipe!
