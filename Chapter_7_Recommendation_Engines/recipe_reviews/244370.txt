I wish I had read the review before making the pizza. 18 ounces of barbecue sauce is entirely too much for a single pizza and 10 oz of chicken was entirely too little. It think it would be better if you reduced the barbecue by 1/2 and increased the chicken by 5 oz.

I  made two 15x10 pizzas,  doubling only  the crust, chicken and cheese.  I was able to use one onion, one red pepper, one can diced tomatoes and slightly less than one bottle of BBQ sauce for both (big) pizzas. I skipped the mushrooms and added fresh chopped cilantro to the top before baking.  I baked at 375 for approximately 17 minutes.   With these modifications,  this turned out really well and will probably make a reappearance in my dinner rotation. I  loved the addition of the chopped tomatoes in this.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!
