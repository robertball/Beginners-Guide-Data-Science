I've made this recipe before with several changes. I mix cream of chicken soup in with the stuffing to make it increadbly moist while baking, and also I wrap with raw bacon instead of having it already cooked. It helps add flavor, and it seems to hold everything together better! It's definatly not a calorie conscience meal but it's wonderful!!

We really liked this recipe.  It will be on our regular dinner rotation for sure.  I pounded the chicken and seasoned it with Emeril's Essence.  Once filled with stuffing and wrapped with bacon (which I did not pre-cook), I placed the chicken bundles in the slow cooker and cooked them on high for 2.5 hours while I took my son to football practice.  When we got home, they were cooked perfectly!  I put them under the broiler for 10 minutes to crisp the bacon.  The chicken was juicy and delicious.  I really like this recipe.

This was just ok for us.  The chicken didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked.  I also was afraid of it drying out, so I added a little chicken stock in the pan while baking.  It helped keep it moist, but I think I would like to tinker with the spices. Thanks for the post.

We enjoyed this dish last night for dinner!  I did check the internal temp to make sure everything was cooked thru!  Remember anything stuffed needs an internal temp of 165.  I thought the recipe was easy to assemble, and tasted great.  Next time I don't think I'll use any garlic powder.  I like garlic, but I just felt like it wasen't needed.

Pretty good... of course I used a couple of others ideas and used raw bacon to wrap, used cream of chicken soup in the stuffing, and used the slow cooker then crisped them up in the oven.  Like I said, pretty good, but probably will not be a regular on my menu.

I made this recipe for my family and it was a hit! Some of them do not like bacon so some of the chicken I wrapped them up with out the bacon, then dipped them in some flour, eggs and then panko bread crumbs and just cooked it in frying pan with oil to make it nice in crunchy before putting in the oven.  It was so good, I already have requests to make it again

HOLY SALTY!!!
This dish was tasty, but very salty. I followed the recipe, and it just wasn't what I was looking for. It was good, if you like chicken and stuffing. It was easy to make and bake, but was just off somehow. I haven't made it since, and I'm not sure I would again. I was a great concept, but not my cup of tea. 
Perhaps you will enjoy it.

What an easy recipe for a work night! My family really liked this and they were all impressed! I would suggest cooking the bacon in the microwave for only about 2 mins. so it doesn't get too crispy which will make it easier to work with. It cooks up well in the oven. Good taste. Thanks!

This was good, but more just due to the concept than the actual taste.  Not sure the stuffing was the tastiest thing I could have put in there.  I will look for a similar recipe with something else inside.

My family loved this. I made a couple of changes the second time I made it and like it better. I substituted boudin for the stuffing, used raw bacon, and marinated the breasts in grill mate garlic, herb wine marinate mix for an hour before baking. So simple!!!

even if you deviate a lil...i.e.  have problems following directions the ingredients mixed together taste very good and are a hit at my house...for a lil variation i used maple bacon and only half way cooked the bacon until wrapped.

I would have done this with chicken with some type of coating to keep it moist, however, I had tilapia on hand and the combo sounded so good. IT WAS!!!!  As per suggestion, I microwaved the bacon first, especially due to the fact that fish takes only minutes to cook and it came out incredibly delicious! Kids went wild! Thanks so much Karen!!

Not very impressive, overall it is very bland. If I were to ever try it again, I would put the garlic powder and pepper on the chicken before wrapping it.

My husband and anyone I have ever made this for LOVES this.  I just sprinkle the garlic salt and pepper on the chicken once it's all made up.  I also do smaller chicken portions.  but it's still AWESOME!!!  My mother-in-law said it looked like something you would make for the president. haha...  it did turn out really pretty too.  and I make chicken gravy with it, which my husband doesn't eat it with it, but i think it's better because it makes it more juicy..  a MUST try!!!

Made this recipe the other night for dinner guest, everybody loved it.  the only thing I changed is I made cornbread stuffing and sauteed 1/4 cup each of red onion and green pepper to add to stuffing.  Would definitely make again, next time with wild rice stuffing.

We all loved it--with the exception of my four year old who doesn't like stuffing. I did a few things a little differently. I adjusted the instructions on the stuffing package to the following:
I used 4 cups of Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned stuffing mix, 1/3 cup butter, 1 small onion finely diced, 1/2 cup finely diced celery, 2 cups chicken broth and 2 tbsp. ground sage. 
Then, I seasoned the chicken after putting it on the bacon--pepper and garlic powder. I peppered the outside as well, once wrapped in bacon, but no more garlic powder. I did not pre-cook the bacon. Next time I might; perhaps mine was thicker than commenters that recommended not cooking halfway first. I had to cook longer than the 40 minutes indicated in order to get the bacon done, but it took that long to cook the chicken, so perhaps it was perfect after all. It was very tasty!! My boys requested I make it again.

Good recipe! I wasn't sure how flavorful it would be so I also served it with chicken gravy and sides. Yummy and easy!
