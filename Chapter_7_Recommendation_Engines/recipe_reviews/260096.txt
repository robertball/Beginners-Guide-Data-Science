So delicious!  I made a different gingerbread cake that’s an old favourite but used the sauce recipe. I used all sugar - no stevia. The combination of the gingerbread, which isn’t too sweet, with the sauce that’s very sweet, was wonderful. Whipped cream without too much sugar was perfect to balance the heaviness of the cake. The sauce is to die for.
