This is actually one of my favorite recipes from Campbell's. I've never had cream sherry on hand, so even without that ingredient, I still love this soup. I usually add one can of drained oysters, which I chop up, I throw in a can of minced clams (juice and all), a good portion of salad shrimp, some chopped crab (imitation adds a certain sweetness to this recipes, which I love), and if I have the money to splurge, I'll throw in some nice bay scallops.  I cook that with the butter until everything is nice and hot, and then add in the soups, cream, and half and half (I didn't have cream once, and just used milk in place of it--it was 1% even--and it still turned out fine. I've never tried cutting out the half and half, though). I add a couple grinds of red pepper flakes, heat on medium low for about 10 minutes, and it's done!  My 6-year-old (he's a big seafood fan, like me) loves this with some Ritz or butter crackers.

It was really good. I only had 2 cups of half-and-half  so substituted the rest with the left over heavy cream.  I couldn't get enough of it.

Absolutely delicious.  I made the following adjustments which made preparation ridiculously easy: I used 2 cans of canned crab and 2 cans of small canned shrimp (no need to cook)  I put everything in a crockpot and added a pat of butter.  I didn't use heavy cream, just used half and half to make the consistency I wanted.  Turned crockpot on low for 2-3 hours.  Added a splash of Tabasco and omitted the sherry as I didn't think it would add much.

I absolutely love this recipe. My husband and I have made this several times but now we won't be able to make it anymore cause the store I get it at has said that Campbell's has discontinued it. Just like that 2 weeks ago it was in the store now it's gone...Really bummed. I'm still giving it 5 stars cause it was delicious!!

Really easy and delicious. I added diced potatoes and mushrooms instead of cream of mushroom. I'll definitely be making it again.
