This is an awesome recipe.  The only difference is I added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg to the mixture.  This was GREAT and tasted like something from a high end restaurant.

Creamy deliciousness with a nice pecan crunch.  I used half the amount of sugar and it was perfect for us.

I don't like nuts so i left them off, but man oh man are these potatoes good! Even without the nuts! And soooo easy! I prepared the whole thing the night before and baked it today. Perfect!

Since I have bad arthritis in my hands I bake potatos instead as they are to hard for me to peel. Have made this for years with just that one change.

Very very forgiving recipe. I can't use egg (allergy) and did a flax substitute. (Soak 1 TB flax seed in 3 TB water for 5 min, blend until smooth for 1 large egg.) Forgot the vanilla and milk. Oops. Used Penzey's baking spice because it was all I had. Despite butchering the recipe family still loved it, and the flax ended up lending a very pleasant flavor running in the background.

I have always loved my mother's sweet potatoes, but they will no longer be served, because this recipe is the best I've EVER tasted!  Thank you for such an easy, forgiving recipe that my whole family loves!!
