I made this for Thanksgiving. I used jalapeno cream cheese since I didn't have jalapenos. It turned out fantastic!

Really creamy and smooth with layers of flavor that you typically don’t find in mashed potatoes.  We’re about mid-range on spiciness, and in the future, I’ll add more jalapeno. The recipe didn’t say whether or not to peel the potatoes, but next time, I’ll probably just leave the skins on.  Think that’ll add more color to the dish.  Love mashed potatoes, and this is a good recipe!

We like Betty Cricker’s garlic jstant mashed potatoes (in the packet) so we used that for the mashed potatoes.... but we failed to consider the portion & thus the delicious cream cheese sour cream goodness mixture was a little much.  (AMAZING but so unhealthy.)  Next time we’ll cut that in half or make 2 packets of potatoes.

Made it with the skins left on the red potatoes. Otherwise no change. Mashed potatoes are awesome. Jalapeños just kick them up a few notches!

Followed this recipe but added an extra half jalapeño per the suggestions. Would not recommend. I guess it depends if you are using fresh jalapeño or slices and if they are hot or mild. I used fresh. 1.5 was too hot even for my spice lovers. I would say stick with the recipe as written or add a little at a time and add to taste.

I so wanted to love this, was so excited by the ingredients but I was quite disappointed at the result. I found it quite bland - my 2 year old loved it tho. I added a few ingredients to make more flavoursome for my partner & I, so all was not lost. 3 stars for a great base recipe though. Thank you.
