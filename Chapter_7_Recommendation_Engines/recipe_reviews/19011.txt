I make eclairs alot and for those who have a problem with the "shell"part not turning out....The recipe I have used for years (same ingredients and measurements for 12)calls for the ball of dough to cool for 5 mins. then beat in eggs one at a time. After putting on greased baking sheet; bake for 20-25 mins. at 400(golden brown), then cut a 1-inch long slit on side of each eclair. Reduce oven temp to 375 and bake for 10 more mins (this allows the inside to cook a little).Hope this helps. 
   Try filling with BAVARIAN CREME FILLING: 1 1/2 C. chilled whipped cream; 1 pkg. (8 oz) cream cheese, softened; 2/3 C. brown sugar; 1 t. vanilla; 1/8 t. salt...In a chilled bowl, beat cream untill stiff. Blend remaining ingredients & fold in cream.

My family went crazy about this recipe.  It was delicious.  My 8 year old grandson told me that he didn't want me to bake his birthday cake in Feb., he wanted these eclairs.  Easy to make too.

Made the shells first because how they came out would determine if the whole recipe was worth making. Not to my surpirse did the shells come out like garbage. Way too much butter for such a dinky amount of flour. First off the amount would have made maybe 6 tiny tiny shells which are bit sized! Second the dough never becomes shell like but stays doughy and soft. Very gross to look at and tasted like oily un-cooked dough. Horrible recipe! And a waste of ingredients!

I just made these today and theycame out perfect.  The only thing was that the cook time for the shells was much longer for me, I divided the recipe into 10 eclairs and baked them for about 30 minutes.

Well I'm perplexed. I tried this recipe because the positive reviews outweighed the negative ones. Unfortunately my experience was negative. I didn't want bite size eclairs so I made mine a little larger and baked them a few minutes longer. The dough turned out greasy and the centers were uncooked and eggy tasting. I wound up with 12 eclairs and enough filling for 12 more. I did give this two stars because at least they are edible. I'm an experienced baker but can't imagine what went wrong. Won't be making this again.

Wonderful recipe.  Everyone thought they were so delicious.  However, they either have to be refrigerated or eaten within three days, as the filling will spoil and take on a bad flavor.  (Found this out the hard way.)

These were great!!! I've never made eclairs before but they were delicious. They took about 2 hours to make but it was worth it! I made 11 big eclairs instead of 20 little ones. I would suggest making more chocolate topping though.

The filling is wonderful......but I had the problem with runny dough and of course it baked into a big pile of nothing. Beat the eggs in one by one like directed. If anyone could help me get the dough right I'd really like to try again!!

I didn't follow the filling. I used chocolate cream to fill and sifted icing sugar on top. Really nice...=)

This came out great.  The shells came out perfect, but when I cut them, they were a little soft inside, so i recommend opening them and letting them dry out in the oven for a little bit, or slitting the side half way through baking. The filling was unbelievably great!  I had alot left over, so we ate it by the spoonful.  Next time I will double the dough. Will definitely make again!

These eclairs are perfect.  I read the reviews, and made somee adjustments to the cream.  I made the pastry the same way, but did mini eclairs with a piping bag.  The cream I just added 2 small boxes of pudding, and 1/2 c powdered sugar.  I dipped them after cool in chocolate, and the used a piping bag to fill with cream. These were great, and so easy to make I did it with my daughter.

I'd never made Eclaires before, but I tried these ones and they were great. I'm not exactly sure why there were so many bad reviews, I have no pastry experience and they turned out fine for me. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because the recipe makes more than double as much filling as is needed for the number of pastries, so I had to make two batches. But they were great!

This is "the" classic eclair recipe. For anyone having trouble with the consistency of the dough, make sure you are following the directions carefully. When I was a kid, my cream puffs turned out like eggy pancakes too. I had failed to follow the directions. You MUST completely stir in each egg at a time. If you crack and add all the eggs and then stir, it will not work! Also, it seems to work better with metal saucepans. Teflon seems to make it too smooth.

I have made these several times.  I did not care for them too much, but I am not a big "Sweets" person.  My husband loves them and requests them quite often.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I thought this recipe had great flavor, and they were fairly easy to make. However, I have never made eclairs before and am not sure if they came out quite right. the recipe called for one 5 ounce pkg of vanilla instant pudding. I used 1 pkg at 1.5 ounces (which called for 3 cups of milk to make the pudding) and the other at 3.5 ounces (which called for 2 cupd milk)-yeah, I know, it looks backwards, but i promise thats what the packages said :) Anyway-following the directions in the recipe, I used both packages and only 2 cups of milk, and my filling came out pretty thick. So my question, is it supposed to have a thinner more pudding like consistancy, or one a little thicker?

I made these eclairs one morning, hoping for a nice treat for myself. What I got was something that tasted like an egg muffin. Why are we using 4 eggs for 1 cup of flour? I would not recommend this recipe to anyone, and I will not be making these again.

I made these french eclairs for my french class, and everybody loved it! I have to say, though, my first time making the eclairs, it was extremely time consuming. Also, my batter for the dough came out very liquidy and not very solid at all. i was not sure how the batter was supposed to look, so i just baked the eclairs as it was. unfortunately, the eclairs did not puff up. Also, i made way too much filling according to this recipe. The second time i made this however, i refridgerated the eclair dough and it came out solid, and puffed out just great! i have to say,although extremely time consuming and messy, the eclairs TASTED phenomenal. Another thing, though, about the filling, was that it took way too long to beat the cream until it was fluffy. i would suggest just buying some premade whipped cream if you are on a time crunch.

This  recipe was really easy and the puffs were light and delicate.  I didn't use the chocolate frosting, but instead I used black cherry pie  filling and it was fabulous! I recommend this as a wonderful dessert for company or just a special easy and delicious end to a meal!

The filling is delicious. I put it together in a blender and it was so fast to make. I wasn't sure 4 eggs would be enough moisture but it was. I piped the puff using a gallon bag and tamped down the tops with a bit of water on the tip of my finger to get a nice rounded top. When cooking, I did end up slitting them with a paring knife to dry them out on the inside after baking for about 20 minutes.

Um, no.  I followed the recipe and ended up with flat, rock-hard, little discs.  I had suspected this would be the case, so I had made four testers.  To the remaining gooey stuff in the bowl, I added a cup and a half of flour and ended up with more poofy tasteless things that could be called "shells"  The filling and the icing are good though, so I went with two stars instead of one. Gotta find a better shell recipe.

The filling was excellent. I used to make these with just the instant vanilla pudding. Adding the cream cheese made the consistency a lot thicker and so much better.
