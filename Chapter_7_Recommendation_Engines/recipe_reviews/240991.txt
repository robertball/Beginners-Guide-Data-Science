WOW, this is delicious! It's SPICY, but it was so tasty that I couldn't quit eating it, lol. Hubby LOVED it! I did 1/2 the cayenne, and am glad I did b/c I think it would've been too much spice for me, but that was my only change. Really great combination of flavors! I will be making this often~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was truly hot, but that is about all it was. Too much heat and not enough flavor. I did not alter the recipe and I will certainly not be making this again.

I made this hummus for a family cookout. I had never made my own hummus and was looking for a recipe that would be relatively simple but flavorful. I chose this recipe and doubled it, except I used half the amount of cayenne. Everyone loved it and it disappeared quickly. We used carrots and organic wheat crackers for dipping. This was definitely a hit and I will be making it again!

I was in the mood for Hummus today & had never made it, but this recipe gave me the encouragement.  
Of course I made a few changes... no tahini, so I added extra olive oil.  Less than half the cayenne, and it's still got some kick... but that might have to do with the fresh jalapeno I used (you never know how hot they are until they're mixed in!).  I also used the juice of a fresh lime instead of lemon.
And, I didn't even let it sit... just eating it straight out of the mixer!!  It's delicious :-)  Thanks for the recipe!!

My FACS class made 6 different types of hummus and this was their favorite.  This is very addicting.  Many students had to try it several times. (hint, hint)  Several teachers also tried it and asked for the recipe.  I will make this for family occasions!  Thank you for sharing.

We really enjoyed the jalapeno flavor of this hummus (great with cheddar flavored rice crisps to dip).  I did up the jalapeno slices a bit and used only 1/2 tsp chipotle pepper instead of cayenne to continue the jalapeno theme.

This is just a bit off the standard and definitely too hot. Decrease the cayenne substantially (I used 1/3 tea) and increase to taste.  I also peel the beans: they have a thin covering that does not process as well as the core.  You will find a MUCH creamier consistency.  Roll them gently in a towel or between your palms, then just pick off the coating. It is surprising what a difference it makes, it's not "labor intensive" but it does take a while making a quick recipe not so quick
