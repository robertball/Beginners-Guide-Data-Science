This was fine. It was easy and quick, which is a big plus. I will probably make it again, but it needs a little help. The fish tastes fine but the pasta needed some more flavor. I added some broth and basil with plenty of red pepper. It's a little bland otherwise. I only used 2 filets...I should have used 4! They are very small.

I used the Lemon Butter flavored fillets and they were delicious! I made this one night after work and it was ready in minutes. I added extra Parmesan and red pepper flakes to add more flavor.
