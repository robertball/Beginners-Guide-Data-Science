We were unable to put the cheese on the hot dogs due to dairy allergies with one of the kids. But these were loved by 3 of the 5 kids. Not to bad at all!

I haven't tried this myself but it went over very well with the kids! I substituted the celery salt with grated carrots and celery (a little bit more vegetable) added cheddar and Parmesan and substituted the barbecue sauce with ketchup (I hate BBQ so we don't have any). The kids scarfed it down and asked for more!

Dinner needed to be quick tonight so I whipped these up along with another type of hot dog. This was our favorite of the two. I just popped them in the toaster oven and this worked great. This was served with 'Hot Dog Roll Up' and 'Thin Spaghetti with Garlic Red Pepper and Olive Oil' both from AR. Thanks Marie for a quick and interesting way to prepare a hot dog.

Nice way to dress up hotdogs but a bit akward if you are serving with buns.

This Fantastic! My entire family loved them. I made a few changes... I didnt slice the hot dogs and left off the celery salt. Instead of baking them with BBQ sauce and cheese I just baked them and serv ed them plain. We will be making these from now on! They are the best
