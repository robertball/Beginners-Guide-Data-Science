This chicken recipe was really delicious and nutritious.  While making this, I actually considered skipping the cheese sauce, mostly, to cut down on the fat and calories but I changed my mind and I'm really glad I did.  I used aged cheddar to make it and it was worth every extra calorie my family ingested.  This sauce compliments the dish perfectly even if you don't use a lot.  I served it on the side so everyone could control their intake and that worked wonderfully.  Everyone loved it, including my 33 month old.  Not only will I make this again, I will serve it next time we have company over for dinner.

I made this recipe for my family, and some aspects were delicious, while others weren't. The best thing is that it was an easy recipe and it's a nice presentation.

I thought the idea of the spinach on top was a great idea, but I think next time, I will add more to it for flavor (i.e. garlic, basil, lemon, sun-dried tomatoes, something). 

I liked that the breaded chicken was not full of fat, since the recipe didn't call for eggs. I think that I may need to add more salt to the mix. Also, I always love to add parmesan to breading, to give it some zing, and didn't do so with this recipe.

The cheese recipe was bland at best. And cheddar wasn't a great choice. I think that if I made a cheese sauce again, it will be something that melts a little better like Monteray Jack and Colby. Quite frankly, we preferred a marinara sauce that I made the next day for the left over chicken over the cheese sauce.

All in all, the concept was great, and it presented beautifully. Just needed more in the flavor, which I think I can easily add next time. I will make this recipe again.

only 4 stars due to it being very fattening with all the butter needed. 
i used 8-10 breast tenderloins instead of breasts, took 35min to cook thoroughly. thought the nutmeg would make it taste weird, but it was a great flavor. upon other reviews, i added 1tbsp of minced garlic. served with egg noodles

This was delicious!  I made it without the sauce, and it was just perfect.  I will definitely be making this again.

It has good flavor.  I will pound the chicken breast to half inch next time so it is more tender, cook faster,  and the spinach on top won't become quite so crispy.  I reduced the recipe to four servings for the chicken part, but made all of the cheese sauce and mushrooms, (16 servings), so that we could have it over spiral noodles as a side.  I used colby jack cheese for the sauce, it is what I prefer.  I will make this again.

My family LOVED this recipe every one cleaned their plates.  he only prob was the spinach fell off the top of the chicken but I belive it was because i didn't drizzle the butter on top like she said to do, to save calories.  It didn't make a difference in the taste though. Absolutly wonderful dish, may become a family favorite, almost up there with my enchiladas.

This was pretty good. I actually cut the recipe-only used 4 chicken breasts--but kept the sauce the same and then served over noodles. My family liked it; even my husband (not much of a spinach man) and my 5-yr-old and 1-month-old both ate it well too. On a side note: Some day I'm going to learn to make a cheese sauce that's creamy...this was not that day ;)
