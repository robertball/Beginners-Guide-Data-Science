I have made kale chips in the oven for years but am now switching to the microwave!  I am giving 4 stars since I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I use an oil mister and spray the kale w/the oil and hand mix w/salt and whatever else I want for flavor.  It took 4 min to get it really crispy.   I used parchment paper on the rotating glass in my microwave since the kale stuck to the plate.

Easy and delicious. Very crispy without the hassle of baking.  I'd recommend tossing the kale pieces and olive oil together in a bowl for a more uniform coating.

I loved the idea of making these in the microwave, rather than heating up the oven. However, I did have an issue  with the chips flaring  up and sparking after only  about 1 minute.  I think I have a high wattage microwave, so  perhaps that was the issue. I would suggest you do be careful to watch as they cook. The chips were delicious and crisp. I may try these again with much more watching.

So the first batch I made was FABULOUS, I am not a huge kale fan and it was delicious.  I did add garlic salt and it was very tasty. The second batch, CAUGHT ON FIRE. There were literal flames, not sparks FLAMES.  I thought at first I left a fork or some mettle on the dish but when I pulled it out, after waiting a bit,  there was only kale, garlic salt, olive oil and some ash where I assume it caught on fire. So yah, this is a easy delicious recipe but be warned about the pyrotechnics.

These did not come out well. The kale actually did not taste as good as when they are baked, and I could not get them uniformly crisp. While the oven is more time consuming, it's worth it.

Very simple recipe. Ate Kale for the first time in my life. As suggested in the reviews, I've used the oven instead of the microven. I've used the fan/grill setting - resulted in crispy kale chips!

I just made these in the microwave and ate 2 batches as soon as they cooled enough to eat. I liked the idea of misting the with a olive oil mist, otherwise you can get too much oil on them and they are oily.  This is so healthy for you too. Make sure these do not overlap or they will not cook crisp. Using parchment paper is slick. I use parchment paper for almost all of my baking. I love my kale garden and can find so many ways to use it. I make a kale breakfast smoothies also in kale season.  Wished I could have fresh kale year-round. (-:

Wow! How simple! This is my 2nd time making kale chips, first time baked. This was just as good but a lot easier. Hubby likes them and he doesn't even like kale.

This is a great technique for kale chips! The microwave dries them out really well and makes them super crispy.

My first time making kale chips and tried it in the microwave instead of the stove for 3 minutes.  Boy did they come out terrific!  I'll be making my chips like this from now on.  I put grape seed oil instead of olive oil and used garlic salt and man o' man what a great taste!

I finally found a great kale chip recipe.  The kale stays green and if it's not totally crispy, it's easy to  add a minute of cook time.  I also tried something.  I nuked the kale for 1:30 mins and then sprinkled fresh parmmesan cheese  and continued cooking for one more minute.  Ate the whole batch!

Finally I made kale chips that were delicious! I've tried the oven many times and many ways with all types of kale and they're always chewy or slightly burnt. I lined my plate with parchment paper and it took me 3 minutes 20 seconds. I was checking them often though. They were perfect. The first plate was gone in just a few minutes.

Really easy & tasty too ! I tossed the leaves  in olive oil & sprinkled with black lava salt. Cook them in 30 second intervals to avoid flaming up & test for readiness as you go.

I was blown away that the microwave actually worked! These were awesome and so much faster. I had some kale that was about to go bad, and a little limp. I tossed it in a bowl with EVOO and garlic salt to make sure each leaf was evenly coated. I cooked them exactly 2 minutes in my microwave, and they were perfect. No burnt edges like the oven. Five +++ stars!

It lit my microwave on fire, I think it was because I added too much oil but they still came out fine.

@janeyann99> I agree with you completely.  Misting them keeps the chips from going limp. The driver they are going in the crisper they are coming out. The oil really only helps the salt stick and creates a bit of humidity to keep them from curling up to much. Parchment paper is key to keep them from sticking. Well done girl! For those of you who like a little heat, a dash or two of sriracha powder or any other spice you prefer never hurts either. I dont recommend using garlic powder tho. I found it to go bitter due to the long cooking time. And I agree ,it takes at least 4 mins on high to get a real good crisp out of them. I usually set mine for 5 mins. Make sure your pieces are dry on both sides before preparing. Enjoy the goodness!

I made one batch. Some turned out ok, but it wasn't crispy like baked ones usually are. It was fine I liked them I will use this method during the summer if I don't want to turn on the oven

Tasty but BEWARE! After 35secs in the microwave a piece of kale caught fire! 

But... It was so yummy I made a second round so it was worth the risk

I made this for the first time. Thought it would be horrible ( the way we think all healthy food should taste!). Will absolutely make it again. 

I'm making a batch in the oven to see the difference between the two methods. 

I've seen comments of kale bursting into flames in the microwave, so I adjusted my power setting to cook on 40% for 2 minutes.

This recipe for kale chips did not come out crispy like they do in the oven. Edible but you need to put them in the oven if you want them to crispy.

Make sure you are by the microwave just in case of flare ups, also best eaten the day they are made

first time I tried this it turned out great but I don't really know what kale chips are supposed to be like so I think they are OK think I'll put a little less salt on them I also added Parmesan cheese.
