I just made these cookies last night and they are almost gone already.  I followed one reviewer's suggestion of substituting the 1 1/4 cup brown sugar for 1 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup white sugar and then used a full cup of peanut butter and real butter instead of shortening.  I also baked the cookies at 350 like most people suggested for about 10 minutes.  I only made about 12 cookies from the batch (I like them pretty big) and I flattened the balls of dough out and pressed them with a fork before I baked them.  They are undoubtedly the best PB cookies I've ever had.  I'm making another batch tonight to share with my family!  Follow the substitutions and I GUARANTEE you won't be disappointed!!

As the daughter of a french pastry chef and the granddaughter of an old world cookie connoiseur, I'm trained in the art of seperating the immaculate cookie from the rubbish cookie. These, friends, are immaculate cookies. I made two batches- one regular, and one with chopped peanuts, and both are delicious.

The BEST peanut butter cookie EVER. I modified the recipe though. I used 1 c. brown sugar and 1/3 c. white sugar. Also, used 1 c. peanut butter and replaced 1/4 c. of the shortening with butter. So moist and chewy and DELISH!!! To the people that think they are dry, you are baking them too long...

Wow,having trouble typing, cause my hands are full of cookies.  Loved this recipe.  I replaced the shortening with a 1/2 cup of butter and also increased the peanut butter to 1 full cup. I've been trying to make peanut butter cookies for years and always found them hard and dry, these ones were soft and moist.  I will definitely be making these again. Thank you Carla for sharing this recipe with us.

Oh my goodness!! I am an avid cookie baker, and have never used that much vanilla in a recipe, and I know why!  Those were the most disgusting and revolting peanut butter cookies I have ever had the chance to taste.  My dog did not even like them!  If anyone is thinking about making the "Delicious Peanut Butter Cookies,"  know that they are anything BUT delicious.  I recommend using more peanut butter and much less vanilla!  Thank you and have a super day!

This is nearly identical to the recipe I have used for the past 10 years...1/2 a T. less vanilla, and always use butter flavor crisco...bake at 375 for 8 minutes and never over...cool for at least 5 minutes on the cookie sheet before transferring to a cooling rack. I have never had bad luck doing this, and the cookies never last 3 days in my household, with the recipe doubled.

Read some other reviews and decided to do 1/4 cup shortening and 1/4 butter, along with 1 cup packed brown sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar.  Lowered the cooking temp to 350.  And it looks like everyone was right!  BY FAR THE BEST CHEWY PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES EVER!

As is, these cookies are just OK. Use a whole cup of peanut butter. Turn the oven down to 350. Use less salt. Replace at least half, if not all of the shortening with butter. Flatten them with a fork, or something. Do these things, and you will have very *excellent* PB cookies. Some people just don't like vanilla; or that much vanilla. My family loves vanilla, and a whole tablespoon is a good thing in my opinion.

My daughter and I made these to sell at her lemonade stand during our family rummage.  We had neighbors, who stopped by, coming back for more!  We did add 1/4 cup more peanut butter.  Yumm!

I read carefully through the reviews before I made this recipe. A lot of the people increased the peanut butter to a full cup. I did this. I also used butter instead of shortening (I don't usually keep shortening on hand) and super chunky peanut butter, as I like a little texture in my peanut butter cookies. Delicious? Yes. I do believe that the full cup of peanut butter is a must. I did bake mine at 350* as others did and exactly ten minutes was good for me. I tried to pull the cookies off the sheet too soon and they broke up so I ended up letting the cookies sit on the sheet for a minute right out of the oven before taking them off the sheet to cool on the kitchen counter. Moist, flavorful, chewy and just yummy-----and this is coming from a peanut butter cookie hater. I'll make these again. Thanks to those who went before me and left their helpful hints!

This recipe is great. I did follow some of the other suggestions and used 1/2 cup of butter instead of shortening, 1 cup brown and 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of peanut butter. I also added some butterscotch chips that I had left over. Thanks for the recipe.

these were very tasty and easy to make. I followed the suggestion to use a whole cup of peanut butter instead of 2/3 cup, butter instead of shortening, and 1 cup light brown sugar + 1/4 cup regular sugar instead of 1 1/4 c light brown. I used all natural peanut butter- nothing added, just ground peanuts. The cookies are very good, not too sweet.  I used silpats and they lifted off perfectly after letting them cool 5 min.  Since I use convection bake I lowered the temp to 330 and baked them for 9-10 minutes. will definitely be making these again!

These are very delicious and moist.  I took other's suggestions and used an entire cup of peanut butter.  I chose not to substitute butter for the shortening.  Your cookies will spread and flatten more if you use butter, so be sure to chill the dough first if you make this substitution.  The flavor of this cookie is perfect.  You won't compromise on taste by sticking with shortening. Before baking I rolled in Muscavado Sugar(Sugar in the Raw).  This added nice touch.  I baked at 350 for 10 minutes and they were perfect.

A GREAT cookie.  I used 1 cup honey roasted peanut butter (it was all I had), substituted butter for crisco, and added a bag of Nestle peanut butter & chocolate chips.  My friends ate the dough before I could bake them all!

These cookies turned out awesome!  Although some of the previous reviews stated that they were a little tasteless, I did not think so at all. The only change I made is to add about 1/4C raw peanuts to the batter cause I used smooth peanut butter.  Will definately make again!

ABSOLUTELY the BEST peanut butter cookies I have ever baked!! Followed others with slight changes with the 1 cup of brown and 1/3 white sugar and 1 cup of peanut butter.  I only had margarine on hand so used that for the 1/2 cup of shortening. I cant wait to try it with real butter. I used about 3/4 tsp of vanilla.  When put onto cookie sheet I did press them with a fork and added a few chocolate chips to them. PLUS watch them closely while they cook you dont want to burn these ones!! These cookies are so moist and chewy a day or two later and their almost gone for a family of two.  WE LOVED THEM...SO GOOD!!

This is a good starter recipe. I agree with the other review's suggestions.  Must add another egg, use butter not shortening, flatten on pan, and bake at 350.  Then they turn into one of the most flavorful peanut butter cookies around.

Well, I am 13 and my brother came home from college, so I decided to find a new recipe! If you love peanut butter cookies, these are the best, my brother absolutely LOVED them! Thank you so much for the recipe! The only thing was I had to put them at 350°.

These cookies are GOOD.  They may be the BEST cookies I've ever had.  I'm not big on peanut butter, either.  Ouch!  They are unbelievable.  One note- they took much longer to cook.  After the first 8 minutes I cooked in 2 minute intervals for a total of about 16 minutes.  Hint: if they seem crumbly they need more time.  Also I used a full cup of natural crunchy peanut butter and, of course, substituted butter.  Thick, delicious, beyond moist- excellent flavor.  Do yourself a favor and try this recipe.  YUM!

Excellent Peanut Butter Cookie. I took the advice of other reviewers and only used 1/2 tbls. of vanilla. I made a Peanut Butter frosting and made these into sandwich cookies. The cookies alone were fantastic!

These are fabulous cookies! I will be using this recipe again. They are very moist and have a delicate peanut butter flavor. Very easy to make, I did make a few adjustments per other reviews I read. I used butter instead of shortening, 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/3 cup of white sugar, also used a full cup of peanut butter. I used a cookie scoop and made criss cross with a fork dipped in white sugar and baked at 350 for 9 1/2 minutes. This recipe made 3 dozen cookies. With these changes, the cookies are superb!

After following the recommendations of other reviewers, these turned out wonderful!  I replaced shortening with butter, used 1 c. of peanut butter (smooth, with a tablespoon of chunky added), 1 c. of light brown sugar and 1/3 c. white sugar, 2 eggs, 2 tbsp milk, 2 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 tsp salt.  I adjusted the temp to 350 degrees. I love peanut butter cookies and am so glad to have this great recipe!

These puppies went really fast once I set them on the table.  I doubled the peanut butter, and used chunky pb.  These cookies were a little bit too sweet to be eaten alone, but a couple fresh out of the oven with a glass of milk was just perfect.  Next time, I'll decrease sugar by a third.  Also, make sure that you make small spoonfuls of dough.  I did large tablespoonfuls, and my cookies were getting friendly with each other.

I like these cookies a lot! I'd definitely make them again.

I baked the cookies at 350F and found 8 minutes & 30 seconds to be the perfect baking time. I then let them sit for 3 minutes on the stovetop before transferring from cookie sheet to wire rack. 

I used 1/2 cup butter and the 1 cup brown sugar - 1/3 white sugar substitutions. I also added the suggested 1 tbsp honey and used 2 tsp vanilla. I divided the flour into 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup unbleached flour. (I use unbleached instead of all-purpose.) I also used natural ground peanut butter. I added 1/2 cup chopped peanuts. I also added 1 cup chocolate chips, but found that to be too many; I'd recommend trying 1/2 cup or 3/4 cup chocolate chips instead.

My huband is a peanut butter fanatic!  I just got through making these as a surprise for him for when he gets home from work.  I tried one and they are absolutely delicious!!! The best peanut butter cookie I've ever had! I did change a few things while making them though: I used self-rising flour instead of all purpose flour and left out the baking soda and I also used 1 full cup of peanut butter instead of the 3/4 cup.  They are so soft and flavorful! You've definately gotta try these!

Can't give five stars because I didn't follow the recipe as written but nevertheless my cookies turned out beautifully. What I did differently: 1) real, softened butter in place of the same amount of shortening 2) used one full cup of peanut butter 3) I used one very scant tablespoon vanilla -- maybe was more like a teaspoon and a half.  I used a heaping medium sized cookie scoop to form balls and rolled them in sugar before using fork to flatten slightly with crisscross pattern. Cooked on a silicone/silpat lined very good cookie sheet in newer convection oven at 340 degrees for about ten minutes each batch. They are beautiful top and bottom and still soft and chewy tonight, hours after making them. They have a nice peanut flavor and are rich tasting thanks to the butter. As mom would warn, don't eat too many of these in one sitting or you'll get an upset tummy (but therein lies the mark of a really good cookie). These made a few dozen, enough to send in a generous portion for my husband's coworkers to enjoy tomorrow. Thanks for the recipe inspiration. This is the best PB cookie recipe I've ever made and will become my go-to PB cookie recipe now.

If you like thick, soft and cakey cookies, this is the peanut butter cookie recipe for you.  I prefer mine a bit thinner, crispier and chewier, so will keep looking.  I thought the cookies had a nice flavor, however.  I used butter instead of shortening, and reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp because my butter was salted.  Also, as another reviewer noted, a tablespoon of vanilla seemed like an awful lot for this size batch of cookies, so I assumed it was a typo and just used 1 teaspoon, which was the perfect amount.

Very impressed!  These turned out as delicious as promised.  I used the shortening and also changed the brown sugar to 1 cup and used 1/4 cup of white sugar.  I baked them at 350 degrees for 8 minutes and let them cool about 5 minutes before transferring to the cooling rack.  They are melt in your mouth yummy!!!!  I also have to say I really like the vanilla flavor.  It adds alot to the taste of the cookie.

This is one of the best peanut butter cookie recipes that I use. I used butter for sure. I usually shy away from shortening. They are soft in the middle and have a nice crunch on the outside of them. I also melted some chocolate chips and dipped half of the cookie in the melted chocolate. Delish! It was a real crowd pleaser. Lastly instead of using a fork to press them down I used to pointy side of a meat tenderizer and I rolled the balls of dough in sugar before pressing.

This is a good recipe.  I personally like to roll the batter in sugar and press criss cross with a fork so I put the batter in the fridge to firm up some (about 2 hours) before rolling and baking.

These cookies WERE awesome. I used several suggestions and swapped out 1/4 of the shortening with butter and added peanut butter chips and heath toffee bits. I refrigerated overnight and baked for 16min in a convection oven at 325. I used a scoop and did not flatten the cookie. It did spread out perfectly by itself. Everyone loved them more than tollhouse chocolate chip cookies I made.  I noticed this recipe is the same as the Jif recipe exactly except the Jiff uses butter crisco.  I will be making these cookies again and again. NOTE if the dough is not cold it will be a thinner more spread out cookie.

This recipe wasn't anything like the peanut butter cookies I usually make. They were really fluffy, for once I had to flatten the dough before baking. I used crunchy peanut butter and added about 1/2 cup Heath Bar chips to the recipe so they had more flavor. But, if you don't like super sweet cookies you should find another addition like plain chocolate chips or nuts.

Great... simply the nice and chewy, delicious peanut butter cookie that pleases everyone!  I also took the advice of others and used 1 C PB rather than the 3/4.  Also to note, with the mention of the cookies being too flakey, I increased the flour by a couple TBSP and they were absolutely perfect, just what I was looking for! Thanx a million!

I love these cookies! The first one or two batches came out dry and crumbly, but after some alterations, came out perfect. I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of shortening, 1 full cup of peanut butter (peter pan), and 1 cup brown sugar and 1/3 white sugar. Delicious.

These are the best peanut butter cookies.  I have to make double batches 
and they still get eaten up within 24 hours!   Perfect amount of peanut taste 
and sweetness.  A real keeper!

I would give this recipe 5 stars except I didn't make it as written..with the few changes I made they are 5+ stars. The changes I made are as others suggested I used 1 c peanut butter ( I used chunky peanut butter) and it had great peanut flavor. I also only used 1 1/4 tsp of vanilla because like other reviewers I thought 1 tablespoon seemed like a lot. I used butter instead of shortening. I also cut the salt to 1 tsp because I used salted butter. Next time I will double the recipe because by the time everyone in the house got done eating them as they came out of the oven there was only about 2 dozen...definitely not enough. These cookies are great my friend told me the best peanut butter cookies she ever had!!! Will definitely make these again with the modifications the perfect peanut butter cookie!

Great cookie!  Used butter instead of shortening and cut down a little on the sugar.  I was afraid the yield would be too much but I only got 34 cookies instead of 4 dozen luckily.  Very soft, savory cookie.

This was by far the best peanut butter cookie I have ever made!  And it adapts very well to a gluten free diet when made with rice flour. Since I used salted butter (I had no shortening) and the peanut butter appeared to have salt in it already, I decreased the salt measurement to 1/2 tsp. Definitely a keeper - thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!

I thought these cookies were AWESOME.  I too, made a few mods to the recipe.  1 cup PB, 1 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar.  I also used butter instead of shortening.  Baked at 350 degrees for 8-10 mins.  They were very soft and chewy!  Excellent, excellent, excellent!!!

I first made these for my husband when we were dating because he loved PB cookies.  8 years later, I am still making them for him.  I don't smash them too flat and I am careful to pull them out before they are completely done so they stay nice and soft.  Sometimes I sprinkle them with finely chopped walnuts or peanuts to make them pretty.  This is a great recipe!

This is the same exact recipe as on the crisco sticks package. It's a good recipe but not enough peanut butter flavor. I usually up the PB to 1 cup and add an extra splash of vanilla. Watch the time on these cookies or they will be very crispy PB cookies. I always make one batch very crispy for my sister and father and one super soft for my huband. Will still look for a recipe with more PB flavor as I am a PB junkie.

Wow this is a really good cookie - I can't stop eating them.  I used the extra crunchy peanut butter so there were little bits of peanuts in the cookies, it added a nice crunch and burst of peanut flavor.

Delicious!  I followed others suggestions and used 1/2 C butter instead of shortening, I used a full cup of peanut butter and white sugar along with the brown sugar.  I also baked them for 10 minutes at 350 degrees.  They are wonderful.

Fabulous!!!  I followed recipe except, out of milk, I diluted heavy cream w/ water and my oven is a little slow so they took about 13 minutes but soooooo yummy~!The key is taking them out when they are just lightly browned/golden.  They are all puffed up and then as they cool on the pan they deflate and stay chewie w/ a perfect crumb!!  I bet if I followed suggestions like using butter and more peanut butter (and maybe a tad less vanilla)they'd be even better!!!  Bravo!!!!!!  FYI: I checked Crisco's recipe and it's the same and includes a full Tblsp. of vanilla. Update...full cup PB was 2 much.

I don't usually make Peanut Butter cookies, because every recipe I've ever tried is awful; dry and crumbly. This one makes a very moist cookie. Change: I did butter my air bake sheets, made the cookies lift off perfectly. Other than that, this recipe is perfect. Thank you for sharing, Carla.

I followed the recipe, but separated the dough in three sections. In the first, I put white chocolate chips and macadamia nut pieces.  In the second I added peanut butter chips and in the third I added coconut flakes, chocolate chips and almond pieces. Because I added so much to the recipe, I set the oven at 350 instead of 375 and baked the cookies for 8-10 minutes.  I found when baking them at 375, the bottoms burned just a bit. Cookies came out wonderfully.

These fat cookies were quite delicious.  I like mine a little chewier, so next time I may add a little more milk and sugar, but that's just me!  Great recipe.  Yum!

I am like the pickiest person on peanut butter cookie's, I made these and love them, my whole family is crazy about them. I used butter instead of shortening and for those of you who said these are lacking taste maybe it's the Peanut butter you are using, I only use Peter Pan, these are perfect cookies!

These are very good peanut butter cookies--the same as on the Crisco sticks package.  I used butter instead of shortening.

I love this recipe. I used butter instead of shortening and they did fine. I did not use quite all the milk and I rolled them in round balls and flattened them with a fork and the worked wonderful. The texture and taste is great. This is a keeper

Just made these cookies tonight and they taste great!! I made a slight adjustment like some of the reviews said, and they turned out perfect. 
I used real butter, 1Cup brown sugar and only a 1/4 Cup white sugar. I also used a whole Cup of peanut butter and I cooked them at 350 for 11 minutes. They were moist, not to crunchy in the center and the edges were a little crisp! They were great! Will make these again...

Made the modifications as some others said and We love these cookies!!  We use all butter and no shortening with 1 cup of peanut butter.  I have baked at both temps and they come out fine just have to watch or as I do.........cook by smell.  I have NEVER timed anything I bake!  I always can tell by smell.  Thanks for sharing!

These were so delicious I followed the recipe exactly and came out with bakery quality cookies. I've tried a couple of cookie recipes and they didn't taste as good as the packaged peanut butter cookie recipe. I know packaged cookies are not the best cookies ever. These cookies far surpassed my expectations. Much better than any recipe or packaged cookie I've tried. Thanks

Excellent.  Only changes was upping the Peanut Butter to 1 cup and rolling in sugar before baking.  The sugar gives a little crispness to the outside.

OMG!...These cookies taste great!  The directions for the recipe was simple to follow.  However, I did take the advice of previous reviewers and modified the following:  1 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup white sugar, 1 cup peanut butter, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, oven temp. 350, and finally substituted shortening for 1 stick of butter.  Additionaly for my personal taste, I added about 1-2 tsp of flax seed and honey.  The extra ingredients did not hinder taste, and was a succes with kids and family...will remake again soon!

I don't know how some of these recipes get such high reviews. I am an avid baker/cook and I am about to give up on this website! This is not a good recipe, my cookies were on the dry side and did not have a good peanut butter flavor.

I followed this recipe until I got to the milk. I did not have regular milk. Too late... I had vanilla silk soy milk so I used it.  The Best! Then I followed the recipe with regular milk. It was not the same. The vanilla soy made them taste better for some reason. I could not stop eating the cookies. This is the best PBC recipe. Try it with the vanilla soy. you would never use regular milk again... Promise!

I followed the recipe as is.  I don't know why people alter the recipe before they have even tried it.  If you change the recipe, don't review it.   Because you didn't make it.  But I digress...these cookies are very good.   They remind me of Keebler Softbatch.....Highly recommend.

Look no further for the best peanut butter cookie recipe!  I personally prefer a crispier texture and used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar. Also used 1/2 cup butter instead of shortening.  yummmmmmmm!!!

These are yummy!  I found they turn out better if you make rounded balls by hand (pack them) before putting on the baking sheet.  I used 1 cup brown sugar & 1/3 cup white sugar as recommended by other readers, and baked at 350 for 7 minutes so they're nice & moist!  I also used a fork to press a pattern in the top.  I used extra chunky peanut butter and that gave them a nice homemade/peanutty texture.

I halved the baking powder and salt, and they still came out delicious. We live at 7,000 ft.

Awesome cookies!  Didn't have shortening so I used butter.  They turned out fantastic and habit forming.

These were amazing! Followed the recipe exactly the first time as I always do and my boyfriend and I were very happy with the results. They also were great the next few days if you heated them up in the microwave for a few seconds and then had warm cookies with milk. Yum!

It was hard to stop eating the cookies long enough to write this review! I followed the previous suggestions and used 1 C Brown Sugar, 1/3 C White Sugar, 1 C Peanut Butter, and 1/2 Tbsp Vanilla, however, I kept the shortening (used Butter Flavor Crisco). I cooked on 350 for 10 minutes, and Oh. My. Goodness. I grabbed one while still warm just to test, and it melted in my mouth. I had several more! These are delicious, moist, chewy peanut butter cookies, just what I wanted. I had previously used the Joey's recipe from this site, but this is my new favorite Peanut Butter Cookie recipe.

Maybe I did something wrong  but  none of us liked these cookies.  They tasted too greasy  and not enough peanut butter flavor.  They do look  very nice but  no one wants to eat them.

In fairness, I made a few minor adjustments based on what I had on hand and some of the suggestions read here so this is more a commentary on my experience and not on Carla's submission.  Her's could very well be better... We really enjoyed them as I made them however.  Here are my modifications. I used butter instead of shortening.  3/4 cup Whole Wheat pastry flour (to TRY to make it a little better for us) and 1 cup regular flour (next time I will try all whole wheat pastry flour) I used 3 TBLSPNS Half & Half in place of milk and cut to 1/2 TBLSPN Vanilla. Dropped by Large spoonfuls & Baked @ 350 for about 12 min. My first batch and largest of the cookies were baked for about 10-11 min and they were almost too moist. I perfer a little tiny bit of crispness to the edge, so I made the rest SLIGHTLY smaller and baked for another min or 2.  YUM~

Almost there. I used alot of the suggestions, but still a tad shy of cookies I'm looking for. My 6 year old daughter absolutely loved them. Maybe it's just an age thing(??) Still a really nice recipe.

YUM!  These were soft and chewy.  I took the advice of others and substituted butter for shortening, lowered the temp to 350 for 10-11 minutes, and also added peanut butter chips.  I like mine a little underdone, and these were perfect!

These are appropriately named.  I accidentally discovered a way to make them even better.  I went to add in some chocolate chips, but I grabbed a bag of butterscotch chips instead and dumped them in before I noticed my mistake.  They gave the cookies a completely different taste.  The butterscotch chips are now my secret ingredient that makes everyone fall in love with these cookies.

Very good cookie.  I made per the recipe (which if you're going to rate it you should do-otherwise it's a different recipe) and they turned out great.  Soft and just right.  A definite keeper.

These peanut butter cookies are the best!  They are not bland at all and have a great peanut butter flavour.  Could depend on what brand you use?  I use Kraft extra creamy for these cookies.  The cookies are nice and moist and stay that way even when cooled.  Personally I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe!  Thanks for posting.

These tasted just like the cookies I remember having as a kid. They were soft and chewy. I dipped my fork in sugar and made the cris-cross before baking, flattening the dough to about 1/4 inch. I think I would like a stronger peanut butter flavor, so next time, I'll either use chunky peanut butter, chopped peanuts, or peanut butter chips. Thanks!

Made a good cookie, not to crumbly but nothing spectacular. I made some plain, then added chocolate chips to a few batches. Didn't spread enough when baking so make sure and smash them down pretty hard w/a fork.

to the last reviewer...not to worry...just stick a slice of bread into whatever kind of container you have if you want them a little softer...works every time.  They will be soft and stay that way.

I just baked these cookies, I have the second pan in the oven now. I took one reviewer's advice and cut down on the salt. I also used butter rather than shortening and the cookies are wonderful. I baked them 10 minutes and they came out soft, just the way I like cookies. I only had enough dough for 3 dozen so I must have made them a little larger than most.

The cookies turned out ok, but not fantastic.  I would make this recipie again, but using a bit less salt and baking soda.  Also, the batch I left in the oven for 8 minutes burned on the bottom.  6 minutes seemed to work better with my oven.

Well, after looking at the recipe,
thought that I would give it a go...
Ended up putting a full cup of peanut butter, because I couldn't smell the pb after initial amount, and still, they didn't taste like peanut butter.  

Eyebrow went up at the tbsp of vanilla, and tried it, ewwww....

Very wet dough, so I went ahead and added a cup of rolled oats *as I usually do for pb cookies*, and still were wet.  Let it sit in the fridge for and hour, still hard to drop, so I ended up forming them by rolling tablespoonfuls in powdered sugar, then putting it on the pan to mark with a fork. 
Well, without the oats, they spread like crazy, but since I added the oats, I put an extra egg in and omitted the milk. This last batch with the two eggs, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 cup of pb, and a cup of oats was moist and chewy.  They even held the mark.  Time consuming to roll them in the powdered sugar, but worth it.

Delicious!  I substituted 1/2 c butter so I wouldn't have to measure the shortening, then I went ahead and added extra peanut butter.  Check these after about 7 minutes to see if they're done.  Easy to make and super delicious!  Thanks for sharing your great recipe!!! :)

These were pretty good.  We used natural peanut butter and Fleishmann's stick margarine.  They were a little dry, but they did the trick!

I followed the recipe to the "T" with the exception of using butter instead of shortning and found the cookies to be okay but a little dry as they  crumbled easily.  The next time, I will add more peanut butter, a little more milk and leave out the baking soda.  The recipe as it is, is over rated in my honest opinion.

These are excellent cookies.  Very moist.  Be sure to take them out at the time indicated.  If you wait until you *think* they are done, they will get too hard.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!

I didn't care for this cookie.  I found it dry, crumbly, and lacking that traditional, real peanut butter cookie texture and flavor.  I'm going back to Betty Crocker.  Sorry!

I will use a little more peanut butter next time. I made half the batch with Reese's pieces. That added the peanut butter flavor I was looking for. I will definitely make these cookies again.

This was a easy recipe to follow, the ingredients are usually easy to find at hand for those last minute occasions, and the overall taste of the cookie is pretty good. I think this cookie has more potential-- perhaps experiment with the sweetness by adding white sugar with the brown sugar. Also, I think next time I will try to substitute butter for the shortening and see what happens. The recipe is definitely a keeper...but I think it could use a little something!

This is the best penut butter cookie I have ever had.  I had given up hope on them as they are usually hard, dry and pointless, eeven dipped in milk, but these rival any cookie I have ever had of any kind.  Crispy outside and fluffy inside- not cakey not crumbly or dry.  Wonderful, thankyou!  I used a fullc. of P.B. too.

Kids and everyone else LOVED this one, added 1/2 cup flour, and used 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening.....the key to good cookie making is to watch the first batch like a hawk, take them out when they are JUST brown on the edges, and then set your timer for 2 minutes on TO of the stove, then remove them. They came out perfect for me like this and I yielded about 5 dozen.

The recipe was EXACTLY what the name of it is...delicious!  I went online to get a simple and tasty peanut butter cookie recipe for my daughter and the first one I clicked on was the best.  I did substitute the shortening with canola oil and added more peanut butter, like the others mentioned and it was perfect.  As a matter of fact, I have a little stomach ache now.  (UGH!)  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't know what all the hype about this recipe is.  I tried it and was very disappointed.  It lacked flavor.  I even substituted butter for the shortening, what a waste of ingredients.  Maybe more peanut butter would help, but why do that when there are other pb cookie recipes that are better.  In order to save the cookie I spread pb on a cookie and sandwiched it with another one.

I tried these cookies over the weekend and was very pleased!!! I love peanut butter cookies, but it is hard to find that really good recipe.  Instead of the shortening I used butter and I used 1 cup of peanut butter instead of 3/4 c, to give it that extra taste.  They are very tasty!!!  I would recommend this recipe to everyone.  For those of you that don't know...when you put your cookies into a bag, also put a piece of bread...it will keep your cookies fresh and chewy!!!

I made these cookies tonight. We all loved them and they were very easy to make. I was a little worried before making them after reading some of the other reviews but made them anyway. The other folks that tried them and didn't like them must have been having a bad cookie night. These were WONDERFUL and they were gone in a matter of minutes. My husband said they were the" BEST HE HAD EVER EATEN." Thanks for the recipe.

These cookies were good. I didn't add the tablespoon of vanilla - I assumed it was a typo and changed it to a tsp. They are nice and soft. Not too peanut buttery tasting but tasty none the less. I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter cookies but had some pb in the cupboard I wanted to use up and was surprised that I actually liked them. My family of course loved them! I'd make them again..

These cookies called for way too much vanilla, so I added less and the end result was still too strong, so I added the recommended amount and they still tasted way too strong.

I made these cookies exactly as the recipe indicated. Was a bit surprised about the tablespoon of vanilla extract but thought I would give it a go. My son just loved them as they were soft and chewy. So often peanut butter cookies are on the dry side. Will Make them again!

I followed the instructions exactly except adding 1 cup peanut butter and they turned out very good. I may try again and sub butter for shortening but everything is perfect. If you like softer middle bake 10-11 min if you like crispy a little longer. I also made the criss cross pattern w/white sugar on fork before baking! I really don't understand some of the reviews that stated this recipe didn't work out or taste good. Everything is fine if you just follow the instructions.

Usually, I use peanut butter rather than shortening or butter to make the cookies extra peanut buttery.  This time, I did the same but I was using all natural peanut butter and the dough was too crumbly to use so, I added two more eggs, 3 more tablespoons of milk & 1/8 cup olive oil.  
The cookies are okay.  I think I'll go back to my old recipe ...

Delicious really describes these.  The only changes I made was to use real butter because I didn't have shortening on hand and I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  I followed the directions for the baking time and temp and they turned out picture perfect.  So easy to make and very, very good.  I will be using this recipe exclusively in the future.  These are like my mother used to make.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

My changes: Used butter instead of shortening, cut sugar and salt in half, and used whole wheat flour instead of white.

These cookies are definitely delicious!  I have used this recipe several times, and the cookies always come out soft and moist.  I like to add 2 tsp almond extract and some mini chocolate chips to mine.  They are so good!

These turned out great!  I used butter instead of shortening and a full cup of peanut butter, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. When I had enough left for one last tray, I mixed in some mini chocolate chips. 

The kids and my husband are very happy! Texture is just about right. I baked for 12 minutes.

heed reviewers warnings and use a full cup of PB and DO NOT leave in over longer than 10 min!!  You'll get a nice chewy, sweet, salty treat.  This made loads of cookies for me and they lasted all of 4 days!  A lot considering I live alone and had only one person over in that time.

great recipe.  I used only 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and used almond milk in place of regular to make them dairy free.  They are soft and delicious!!

I made this as a dessert for a family dinner. I used the chunky peanut butter and substituted half a cup of wheat flour for a/p regular flour.

The cookies were moist and very flavorful.  Thank you for the recipe.

Do not replace shortening with butter like other reviewers have suggested unless you want your cookies as flat and thin as a piece of paper. I altered this recipe before I made it, but it is a good base recipe. WAY too much vanilla for my fam. I increased peanut butter to 1 cup, for sugar 1 used 1 cup brown 1/3 c white, reduced the vanilla to 1 tsp and salt to 1/2 tsp. 5 stars the way I made them.

These are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever tasted! Nice and soft and don't crumble. I've made these a few times and I like to add miniature chocolate chips. I also don't flatten them like most people do with peanut butter cookies which I think makes them turn out better.

I made this recipe using the modifications suggested....using butter instead of shortening... 1 cup PB and added 1/2 sugar... I rolled the balls in sugar before baking for 10 min at 350.  People said they were the best Peanut Butter Cookies they ever had. :)

Very good.  Like many people, I used butter instead of shortening and 1 c brown sugar, 1/3 c white sugar.  I also added about 1/2 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Awesome!

I used a lot of suggestions from other reviewers to tweak these such as cinnamon and nutmeg.  And I used 1 cup dark brown sugar along with 1/3 cup granulated sugar.Also I refrigerated the dough for a half hour before forming the dough balls, I then rolled them in a cinnamon sugar mixture before baking. I baked them at 350 degrees F for 8 minutes in a convection oven. I don't know if they will stay soft because 3 of my grandchildren ate them all in a single afternoon, with help from thier Dad.

I made these cookies, only changing the shortening to butter since it was what I had on hand.  These are the BEST peanut butter cookies I have ever made, or tasted.
Thank you, I will definately be making them again!

very yummy and moist cookies.  I cooked them at 350 instead and they came out soft and chewy. I also substituted half of the crisco with butter.  i love the brown sugar and vanilla taste.  Perfect cookies. I also threw in a few chocolate chips too!  YUMMY!!

While this cookie tasted good, it lacked peanut butter flavor and tasted more like a sugar cookie. I won't make this one again.

Despite all the rave reviews, I wasn't impressed. I took the advice of others and upped the pb, lessened the vanilla, changed the sugar and shortening, and baked them at 350 for 12 minutes. I felt they still weren't very peanut buttery and tasted a little floury. My husband was the true tester, since he's an avid pb cookie fan. His response was "Eh, kind of bland, I've definitely had better." So, I will continue my search for an awesome pb cookie recipe.

These cookies were delicious! They reminded my mom of her aunt's Peanut Butter Kiss Cookies! We used the same exact recipe, except we took about a minute off of the cook time, and while they were still cooling, we stuck Hershey Kisses into the middle and stuck it back into the oven for about a minute. The hersheys will melt a little so they are gooey on the inside but they still keep their shape. These cookies were gone in about 2 days! Also, it's fun to take 2 cookies and mush the kisses together to make sandwich cookies! I am looking forward to using this recipe again!!!

I also followed the modified recipe, 1 C PB, less brown sugar and 1/3 C white sugar.  It still needs more peanut butter, but otherwise they were great.  Very easy recipe to follow.  The kids and husband liked them.

These are good cookies.  I chose them because they did not contain butter and I substituted the milk for soy milk as I have a daughter with "cows milk protein allergy".  The only other thing I changed was I added a full cup of peanut butter instead of the recommended 3/4 cup.  I'll keep this receipe for sure!  thanks!

This is a reasonably easy recipe to work with.  I took other people's recommendations and reduced the vanilla to only 1/2 a tablespoon.  I was also rather generous in measuring out the peanut butter.  The cookies turned out well.  The flavour is good, very peanut buttery.  The texture is soft, but I wish they could be more chewy.  As it is, they are soft but a little crumbly.  A friendly reminder to all - be sure to let the cookies cool on the baking sheet.  It helps the cookies to keep their shape while staying soft.  By the way, the cookies taste better on the second day :)

These cookies were great! I did sub. the shortning for butter, and I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 3/4 cup of white. I also added chocolate and peanut butter chips.The amount of vanilla was perfect for me. If yours didn't turn out good  I suggest you try the recipe again because they really are good.I also made them the way that the recipe states and without the chips those were very good also, I just needed some chocolate.

I picked this peanut butter recipe because of the use of crisco. My family is a fan of crisco-based cookies since they are nice and tender but with a nice crisp. Like other crisco-based cookies, they turned out great. I even dressed up half of the batch with some milk chocolate drizzled on top.

Good gracious! Lord be praised- these cookies are the very best. Really. Thank you good woman for sharing this with the rest of us. The world is better place when these cookies are on the counter. 
I added some Hershey's Special Dark chips to half of the batch, I needed some chocolate. Those are good too!

My family LOVED these cookies.  I did sub butter for the shortening, I hesitated to double the recipe the first time I tried it, but I can heartily recommend doubling it as it didn't seem to make the 4 dozen it stated. I used a standard size cookie scoop and it only made about 36.  Thanks for sharing such a tasty cookie.

Although these cookies have great flavor I found them a bit dry, even wit the suggested subitutions.  Now I live at altitude 9454 so given that might have something to do with it as well.  I added mini chocolate chips to the second batch and baked the for 8 minutes flat and they seemed to be better.  But over all good easy recipe.  Thanks

These really are delicious and the best! My daughter used this recipe in a church baking contest last summer and won first place!  We've been making these cookies ever since. The only changes we make is using Butter flavored Crisco, whole wheat flour and adding peanut butter/chocolate swirled chips. Yummy!! These never last long at our house!

I have been making these cookies since 2004 when I first found the recipe. All I have to say is a warning, if you make these for other people they will not leave you alone till you make more! I have ended up shipping cookies pretty much all year to friends and family that have moved away or I have moved away from. This is by far the best peanut butter cookie recipe and my husband is demanding more!

This is by far the best PB cookie I have ever made.  I used butter instead of the shortening and used 1 cup of peanut butter.  I also added 1 cup of chocolate chips.  This recipe was not dry at all.  Very moist in the middle.

Very good cookie!  Used other's suggestions and added an extra 1/4 cup of peanut butter and used butter instead of shortening but then had to add 1/4 cup flour.  The dough wouldn't hold together well otherwise.  I also added an extra splash of vanilla which I think made all the difference.  I baked the cookies at 350 for about 9 minutes which made them very soft but all the way done.  Excellent!

Awesome recipe! This is the first time I used this recipe and I totally love it ( so do my daughters and the neighbours :o) We shared some of the cookies out last night and everyone thought they were very delicious! We did make some changes to the recipe as well. We used 1/2c butter instead of shortening, 1 cup brown sugar instead of the 1 1/4c cup, 1 cup of crunchy peanut butter ( just because we had crunchy in the cupboard ), an extra wee bit of vanilla, and we baked them in a fan-forced oven @ 152ish C instead of the 190 stated. Also we found 8 mins was perfect for baking time.. bottoms looked great and none of them burned... VERY HAPPY! This is now a keeper recipe for me and my family for sure. THANKS for posting it :o)I think these would be nice with choc chips or peanut butter chips or even toffee bits, smiles!

These were very good! For the first batch, I just dropped rounded spoonfuls on the cookie sheet and flattened with a fork. They came out a little misshapen, so for the next batch I rolled them with my hands before flattening and they were much prettier. They tasted great, but next time I would use a little more sugar (I used all natural peanut butter).

This is a very strange recipe. I though I liked it when they came out of the oven, and I would have given them at least 4 stars, but after about 20 mins, I no longer liked the taste, so I will not be making this again

Soft, chewy cookie that had almost no flavor at all. If I were going to make them again I would add more peanut butter and also add peanut butter chips.

I got raves about these cookies. I cut out 1/4c of the sugar, used butter instead of shortening and added peanuts.

The consistency of these were great.  I  also put some chocolate chips in some for the kids and variety.

This cookies were great! I used stick margarine instead of shortening and cookies turned out soft inside and crispy outside, just the way I like my cookies. I'm giving only 4 star however, it was way too sweet for my taste. Will bake again with only half the sugar.

Cookies taste great; I used Peanut Butter & Co.'s White Chocolate Wonderful peanut butter.  However, I only got about 30 cookies out of the recipe.  Maybe it was the cookie scoop I used instead of "rounded teaspoons".  Still a keeper!

Followed the recipe exactly and they tasted salty and not sweet. 
Other reviews mentioned this, too, so I would cut about half of the salt out.

Found the dough a little dry, but they worked out.  I tended to underbake them a little, as they will bake more when left on the hot cookie sheet. My husband loves them!

This recipe was okay. My mum and siblings loved these cookies, but I wasn't really impressed with them. They were too crumbly and dense for my liking. I love peanut butter cookies, but I think the "oatmeal peanut butter cookie" recipe was a lot better.

I'm a 15 year old that loves to cook. I craved peanut butter cookies todayso I checked out this site, found this recipe. I had soo the ingredients so I made some. These cookies are seriously worth it! They're the best. Except, in the oven, I had to bake the cookies for 12-13 minutes instead of 8-10. They're wonderful though. Try this recipe! You won't regret it!

I halfed this recipe, used Blue Bonnet tub spread instead of shortening, and didn't discover I didn't have any vanilla extract until I was already in the middle of mixing things.  These cookies were so moist, chewy, and "delicious."  My husband and I both liked them.  They were so good in fact, I don't know what the vanilla would have added.

These are the best peanut butter cookies ever. This is the same recipe my family has used forever. They are soft and chewy. I do roll these in one inch balls and criss cross them with a fork dipped in sugar. Perfect everytime. No need to look further!!

Loved them! Deffinently the best peanut butter cookie recipe i have ever had. I replaced the milk with 2-3 tablespoons water and one table spoon of sour cream. I also used one cup brown sugar and a little over half a cup white sugar. I added  tiny, tiny bit more vanilla but one tablespoon is a good amount I'd say. I put in a cup of peanut butter instead as well.

This was really a dissappointment!! The cookie was bitter, not sweet at all.  The taste of the baking soda came thru more than the peanut butter. I wondered at a peanut butter cookie recipe that didn't contain regular sugar and now I know....won't try this one ever again.

Blech.  I really wish I had tried a different recipe, its been so long since I made peanut butter cookies that I really wasnt sure what kind of recipe I wanted so I just randomly picked one, this one had mixed reviews and I wish I had paid better attention.  These turned out crumbly, not very sweet or peanut buttery.  Not the best flavor or texture.

These peanut butter cookies were great and easy to make too! :) I think what needs to be added to the preparation of the cookies to make it a better is to roll the cookie dough into balls(after measuring out an approximate tablespoon) then taking a small salad fork and pushing the fork onto the cookie dough balls making the "signature" cross-hatch design on the top of each cookie.  It definitely came out a lot more round that way.  Also, I had to cut back on the baking time a bit since it made the bottoms of the cookies a bit darker than I wanted. Otherwise, awesome recipe!

I did not enjoy these cookies at all. I did not have shortening so I tried margerine instead, which may be part of the problem. They were not very sweet or very penut buttery. They overcooked really easily. Although the recipe says to drop in rounded spoonfulls, you really need to roll in balls and smash with a fork, like with traditional penut butter cookies. I was making these to take to an event, but they came out so bad that now I am going empty handed.

These cookies are delicious! The best thing is that they are very chewy, and stay that way for a few days! They make a lot, though (about 48!) but go away quickly.  I suggest making very small balls, though, to have lots of small ones instead of fewer big ones. Delicious!

These were really good but mine didn't flatten out so I flattened with a fork. Soft and full of flavour. I added more peanut butter and used golden crisco shortening with only 1 cup of sugar. Will make them again.....thanks Carla

I thought they were delicious! Thanks! I used 1/4 cup shortening and 1/4 cup butter and cut down on the brown sugar a bit and put in some regular sugar. They were really moist and good....

I've tried soooo many peanut butter cookie recipes, always too dry and crispy for my taste.  This recipe is moist and chewy...delicious!!  I even added white chocolate chips to the dough and they were GREAT!  Thanks so much!

Best peanut butter cookie recipe I've ever made. Very easy, turned out great. I added an extra Tbs. of milk because the dough seemed a little dry, but that could just be me. They're disappearing fast! :)

I tried this recipe using butter instead of shortening and also adding an additional 1/4 cup of p.b.  The flavor was great--certainly full of peanut butter.  But I had a problem with the cookies falling apart on me.  They turned out crumbly and dry.  Of course, it could have been that I didn't have a mixer.  I mixed and mixed by hand and killed the larger chunks with a fork.  But ultimately, I baked them anyway, albeit with the batter full of the big chunks of that blasted brown sugar that I finally gave up on and let live.  I'm not sure what this review says about the recipe, but certainly people can tell that I haven't a clue what *I'm* doing.

These are awesome!  The recipe is also on the back of the shortening sticks you can buy at the store.  Wonderful flavor, soft, chewy and just the right amount of peanut butter and all the spices you can taste in just one bite!

This is a great recipe, the cookies come out very tender and wonderful.  I had to raise the cooking time because at 10 minutes the cookies were too undercooked, but that might be my oven.  Overall, fabulous recipe.

I made these cookies because of the reviews it has received, let me tell you, you 
won't be sorry they are the best!!! I made the first batch just as the recipe called for and
then made a second batch which I added chopped peanuts about 3/4 cup & 1 cup of peant 
of reeses peanut butter chips and increased the peanut butter to 1 1/4 cups.  If you
like peanut butter you'll love these.

These cookies were "Da Bomb"!!!  It was really simple to make and they tasted just like homemade peanut butter cookies should.  I subsititued butter for the shortening though and I ran out of Brown sugar so I used granulated sugar for 3/4 cup measurement.  I am putting this one in my recipe box!!!

After reading the other reviews, I made a few adjs to the recipe and the cookies turned out excellent - substituted butter for the shortening, and added about a tbsp of honey (also, baked at 350 for 10 mins).  I used creamy pb, but next time I'll try crunchy.  Will definitely make this one again!

This recipe was great, however, i did substitute butter for shortening, and used fresh ground 100% Peanuts instead of the traditional jar peanut butter. It was quite peanut buttery, and good. They were eaten in three days.

This is a really good peanut butter cookie recipe.  It wasn't as greasy as some of the other PB cookie recipes I've tried, and holds its shape really well.  I added the cross marks on it using my fork.  The texture is really good, not too crunchy, not too soft, and has a good peanut butter flavor.  I'd like to try this with an old fashioned peanut butter and perhaps add a little chopped peanuts to the batter.

I just made these cookies for my husband and they are great! I do not even like peanut butter cookies but I like these. I looked at the other reviews and made the same modifications: 
-Use 1 cup of brown sugar
-Use 1/3 cup white sugar 
-Use 1 cup of peanut butter
-Use butter instead of shortening 
-Use a little less vanilla extract
I am very glad I read the reviews before making this. I would give this recipe 4 stars because it had to be modified. The best recipe actually came from the people that commented and not the one copied on here. I like when I can follow a recipe to a T and do not have to make modifications. That just makes the process more complicated. Thank you to all of you who went before me and found out how to make this recipe better so I could have great cookies!

I had to make a change as I did not have enough brown sugar so I used 1 C of brown sugar and 1/4 C white sugar. They were very moist. Yum!

This is named perfectly. I followed the recipe and it turned out wonderful. Just be sure to put your dough in the fridge while 1 batch is baking. Most cookie recipes do better if you do this, though, not just this one. Thank you for sharing

I made these cookies as well as 3 other peanut butter cookie recipes.  I had a blind taste test with  5 family and friends and these won hands down.  They are  not only tasty, they are soft and peanutty.

A good, cake-like cookie. I used butter Crisco shortening, so my cookies were a little more buttery than peanut buttery. I didn't use salt either. Next time, I'll use regular shortening and double the recipe.

This was the best peanut butter cookie recipe I have made in all recipes. The cookies had the perfect softness. I added chocolate chips and used butter flavored shortening. Next time I make them I might add some almond extract to give a little more peanut taste.

These were very good! I was shocked to see that someone rated them the worst ever. I am not sure what she did wrong but if you follow the recipe accurately, these are delicious! 1 Tablespoon of vanilla was necessary with the amount of flour and balancing out the saltiness of the PB. I added a pinch more salt, a pinch more brown sugar,  instead of using all light brown sugar, I used 1/2 c light brown sugar,  1/2 c dark brown sugar and for the remaining balance  I used  white sugar.  I also added a teaspoon of maple syrup and omitted one teaspoon of milk to compensate (1 tbsp = 3 tsp, FYI). I also used butter-flavored crisco as that was all I had in stock! Very delicious!

used 1 teaspoon rather than 1 tablespoon of vanilla as suggested by several raters. i found i needed to flatten the balls with a fork (which the cooked ones look like in the photo but it is not mentioned in the recipe) because the cookies weren't flattening by themselves. i also had to bake them longer than stated, even though i made them pretty small (2" across). but the finished product is delicious!!

I have to admit I go straight to the reviews even for 4 or 5 starred recipes. Hannah, your review was right-on! I was looking for a different recipe than the 1cup of sugar, peanut butter and 1 egg one and I've found it! The brown sugar in lieu of granulated white and the perfect amount of flour turned out the best peanut butter cookie I could have hoped for :) Thanks you for posting this great recipe!

Thanks to all for the reviews, I also used 1 stick of butter,1 cup of Skippy super chunky peanut butter, 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar and reduced the vanilla extract to 1 tsp.  I found baking at 375 for ten minutes on ungreased  cookie sheets worked perfectly.  This will be my go to receipe for PB cookies.  Thanks for posting!

Thanks to all the reviewers to ramp up this cookie recipe.  It will be my go-to PB cookie recipe! I took the advice of using 1/2 c. butter (I use it over shortening anyway) 1 cup PB, 1 cup brown + 1/3 cup white sugar, 1 tsp vanilla.  I chilled the dough for an hour, made the usual fork design on the cookies.  Baked for 10 minutes at 350.  Perfect!

By replacing the flour with 210 grams of  GF free flour mix* my family can  enjoy scrumptious cookies with a normal chocolate chip cookie texture.   We add chocolate chips.  *1:1:1 white rice flour, brown rice flour, and potato starch.

Delicious YES!!  I can only give this recipe 4 stars because I did follow other reviewer suggestions and made a few  changes. I used a full cup of peanut butter, a half cup of butter and a teaspoon and a half of vanilla. I added half a 12 oz package of white chocolate chips...AMAZING COOKIES!!

After a couple of minor tweaks, I can say these are the best peanut butter cookies I hav ever made!  I replaced the shortening with butter, and used a 1 1/4 cup peanut butter. Baked for 7 minutes.  Perfectly moist and chewy!

Reduced vanilla extract to 1 teaspoon only.  Maybe Australian vanilla essence is stronger than US extract but I thought 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract seemed way too much. Have tried many recipes - but these are by far the best. Great texture and flavor, my kids loved making these.

Absolutely delicious!  Best Peanut Butter cookie I have ever made.  Those that don't like them, must be baking them too long.  I baked mine 8 1/2 minutes and that was perfect.  Not too much vanilla either.  I put it, as I trusted the cook, and it was perfect!!!

I wanted to try a different peanut butter cookie recipe and decided on this one because of the ratings and most of the reviews.  I have a recipe that I have used for 35+ years but I am game to trying something different.   I agree with some other reviewers that this NOT a flavorful peanut butter cookie.  I followed the recipe except for adding an additonal 1/4 cup of peanut butter because

Yum!  I made these according to the recipe and they were fantastic!  I let the batter sit on the counter for a few hours and had to re-mix it with a little bit of extra milk to get it dough-like again, though.  That would not be needed if you bake them right away, I'm sure.  I doubled the recipe and it made 10 dozen.  We like them kind of small, so we measured .5 ounce balls and rolled them in a bit of sugar before pressing with fork for that traditional pb cookie look.

Was surprised that these cookies are not that good.  I bake all the time, but my kids didn't even like these.  Had a strong baking soda flavor, but were soft and chewy.  I'd pick another recipe.

My sister and I just made them and I've already had 2. They are so delicious just like the name says. As others have suggested, we turned down the heat to 350 degrees and substituted butter for the shortening. We also added a little more milk and a little less vanilla. Over all a wonderfull recipe, definatly going to do it again.

Delicious, just as the title says! I used 1/2 the amount of vanilla, chunky peanut butter, and for the flour I used 1/2 AP and 1/2 whole wheat. They are chewy, moist, perfect! Thank you!!

Very good! I did follow suggestions by others and Increased the Peanut Butter, and used 1/4 Cup shortening and 1/4 Cup butter instead of just the shortening. I also sprinkled sugar over the top of the cookies. DELICIOUS!!

I made these cookies last night.  They were great. They were soft and remain soft this morning! :-)  I did make some small changes...1/2 cup of butter instead of shortening, 1 cup of peanut butter instead of 3/4 cup.  Enjoy!

The modified version of this recipe is THE BEST!, the addition of white sugar and substitution of butter for the shortening. I did however use the Splenda Brown sugar (which uses half the amount) and it was still fantastic - no taste difference! Follow the modified version to a T with the change in temp and for 10 min and you'll have perfect cookies too! PS - when first out of the oven they may seem undercooked - they're not!

This is the first time I've ever modified a recipe.  Based on others' reviews, I upped the PB to 1 cup, but otherwise kept it the same, & it came out yummy!  I was a little scared as I can't ever seem to get PB cookies right!  I may use a little less baking soda next time too, but this is definitely a keeper!  Thank you!

This cookie was one of the 6 cookie recipes I selected to make for Christmas this year, and my first attempt at traditional peanut butter cookies. A few pointers - buy no salt peanut butter; this will help to regulate the recipe. I purchased a natural smooth peanut butter ("Teddy" brand) and despite it's good quality I found my results a little too salty, and a little oily tasting. Also, I dipped my cookie dough balls in granulated sugar before baking them, and I think this may have been their saving grace. Without that, they certainly would have been too salty and not sweet enough. I added slightly less salt and slightly less vanilla than the recipe called for. I will probably not use this recipe again, however I realize a huge part of making peanut butter cookies is the peanut butter you use, so perhaps I will give it one more chance with a different brand of no-salt peanut butter.

This is my go to peanut butter cookie recipe.  They are so easy to make and are crispy and delicious.  They are always well received. At Christmas time I just top them with a Hershey's kiss and they are always winners.

These cookies lacked peanut butter flavor, next time I will use more peanut butter as suggested. Also, they turned hard very fast, I may have slightly over-cooked them. I will continue to look for a peanut butter cookie recipe, do not think I will make these again.

Absolutely excellent!  I took others advice and used 1 c. of peanut butter and 1/2 c. of real butter.  They were divine!  Oh, I also used whipped peanut butter and I'm not sure if that made any difference in the final outcome but they're so soft and even days later they're melting in my mouth.  YUM!!

These really were delicious, but the receipt forgot to include the spoon size to drop by (I did rounded Tbs.), balled them and criss-crossed with moistened fork.  I also spaced about 1.5" between flattened cookies.

Yum, these were good!   I used other reviewers' advice and added extra peanut butter, cut back on vanilla and decreased oven temp to 350.    They were a bit crumbly while still warm but were fine after they completely cooled.    We enjoyed them.

These have to be some of the best peanut butter cookies I've ever eaten! I'm not usually a fan of PB cookies, but the boyfriend didn't want anything chocolatey so I decided to give these a try based on the reviews. I added a full cup of PB and never looked back.

These were good. I do wish they were a bit sweeter.  Maybe criss-cross the top with a fork dipped in sugar.  I will make them again for sure.  Thanks for the recipe.

I am so glad I found this recipe!  I tried to find a good peanut butter cookie but with low calorie and carb content.  This one was the best I could find.  I freeze the baked cookies and pull out when we want a snack or for company.  Everyone likes them! Thank you Allrecipes & Carla for this recipe.

I just made these according to the recipe and it yielded 3 doz small cookies. My brown sugar was a little dry... and I had to form the crumbly dough into balls. They are pretty good.

I used cake and pastry flour because that's all I had, and 1/3c white sugar as another poster said and these turned out fabulously! I didn't have enough left to share with the neighbors as planned so I'm making them again today!

I followed other's suggestions & used butter rather than shortening, 1 C brown sugar + 1/3 C white sugar & increased the PB to 1 full C.  And I reduced the temp to 350.  THe suggested time is 8-10 minutes - I baked them for 7 minutes & they still came out really dry. :o(  The flavor is good but the texture is just too dry & crumbly - almost powdery - like they turn to dust in your mouth when you take a bite.  It's a good tasting cookie if your oven's cooperative enough to keep them moist, I guess.  But for us this one just missed the mark.

I have this exact recipe that was given to me by my mother years ago. It is the only PB cookie recipe that I use. It is amazing. I've even won with this recipe at the county fair. It is my hubbys favorite cookie. I've tried this with about 6 different types of PB and have found Skippy creamy PB makes them taste the best.

I thought these were just OK.  The flavor is good - very peanut buttery, and they are very soft, almost fluffy cookies, but they fall apart extremely easily and just odn't have the moistness/chewiness I want in a peanut butter cookie!

Really Good recipe, not really peanut buttery, but enough - up it to 1 cup.  The vanilla is not too much in my opinion. I will use this recipe again.

These are amazing!! I first made them and it was missing something. Everyone asked me if I used enough sugar... then after looking at the recipe, it doesnt even call for sugar!!! So I made them again and after I forked them before I baked them, I sprinkled sugar ontop of each cookie... AMAZING!!!  I got so many compliments on them! I make them tiny and I got 6 1/2 dozen out of this recipe.

I used half shortening, half butter for flavor and increased the peanut butter to 1 cup.  I also split the dough in half and added chocolate chips to one half of the batter.  My husband took them to work and was told they were the best cookies his co-workers had ever eaten!  This recipe is a definite keeper.

This was really a dissappointment!! The cookie was not sweet at all. The taste of the baking soda came thru more than the peanut butter. I wondered at a peanut butter cookie recipe that didn't contain regular sugar and now I know. Although I also have to say this is the exact recipe on the JIF peanut butter site, not sure what went wrong. it was a soft not chewy cookie. I did follow others reviews and cut brown sugar to 1c. I recommend 1/2c. white sugar 3/4c brown sugar

These were definitely 5-STAR cookies, but I only rated the recipe 4 stars because I made a few changes based on others' reviews:  1) Used butter-flavor shortening, 2) Baked at 350 for 11 minutes, 3) Cut the brown sugar to 1 cup.  They baked perfectly and were a huge hit today at my office potluck - I got so many compliments!

Mixture of ingredients produced a fantastically tasty result. Following the advice of other reviewers, reduced the vanilla extract by half the amount (1 tbsp must really be a typo error). Cookies turned out very sweet, perhaps a bit too sweet for my liking but still that doesn't put me off from eating more. Still thought the vanilla extract might've been a bit too overpowering even given the reduced amount so will try reducing sugar and the vanilla the next time. Cookies disappeared very fast when offered to friends though :)

These are good and easy to make. The texture was great but it needs more of a peanutty taste. I think I will use crunchy peanut butter next time.

Surprisingly this recipe is the same like what I usually made.
The different is this one contains more peanut butter which I don't mind at all :-)
I must admit this peanut butter cookies are really delicious. I've made this cookies with my version several times now and I definitely will try this one too.
But for a mouth watering looking cookies I add 1/2 cup peanut (skinless peanut, toasted and crushed)and 1/2 cup chocolate chips.
sllluurrrp, my mouth has already watering, cannot wait to make this again.

My son and I made these cookies and it easy, fun and turned out great! I used crunchy peanut butter instead. I was also out of baking soda, so i made my own mix of baking powder and cream of tartar (2 parts cream of tartar to 1 part baking soda) as a substitute and texture came out wonderful. Definately be making these more often.

I am really enjoying these cookies.  I am not sure that it is the best recipe in the world, but they are so similar to the peanut butter cookies that I ate as a child, I have to give them at least four stars.  Be sure to not overcook these because they will be very dry.  I also topped each cookie with some leftover toffee chips that I had and I am glad I did.

I have never eaten many peanut butter cookies.  I didn't know for sure that I even liked peanut butter cookies until I tried these one night.  They are great!  The only change that I made was that I used 3/4 tbs. vanilla instead of the full tbs. that recipe calls for.  Remember to soft bake.                 gena

I made these cookies exactly following the instructions, and they are wonderful.  They are not the typical pressed peanut butter cookies with tons of peanut butter, but they are light and wonderful, and not overpoweringly rich.  I will definitely make them again.

These are probably my favorite peanut butter cookie.  I have been making these for years.  The only difference is I use the butter-flavored shortening.

I took the advice of others and increased the peanut butter and added white sugar.  I made these for a friend and he LOVED them.  We were at his place for about an hour and he had eaten at least a dozen of them.  I'm not a peanut butter fan but when I get the request for pb cookies..this'll be the recipe I use!

Not a good recipe, should be called vanilla cookies not peanut butter. Way too much vanilla and I have THE best vanilla 100% pure from Mexico that actually smells and taste great. I can't imagine what extract must make them taste like.

I followed the suggestions and used 1 cup peanut butter and 1 cup b. sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar.I also used margerine instead of shortening. These were pretty good. I took the cookies out of the oven [350 and only 10 min.] just before they started to brown on the edges. very moist. Thanks for sharing.

These were really good. I did change the recipe a bit, from other people's suggestions, and my own.
I used butter instead of shortening, only 1 cup of brown sugar, 1 cup of peanut butter, and all whole wheat four.
The end resuly was very yummy, soft and chewy cookies, that tasted even better a couple days after!

These cookies are the absolutely GREATEST peanut butter cookies ever!  I made these once for my oh-so-not-big-on-sweets husband, and he has told everyone about these cookies.  I have tried a few other recipes from this site for peanut butter cookies, but these are by far the best!  Don't change a thing, and thanks for sharing!

I made these for a church bake sale. I doubled the recipe and used home made peanut butter. My husband grabbed a bag of them before they made it out the door. He said they were the BEST peanut butter cookies I've ever baked. And I've baked alot of peanut butter cookies! He did actually let me try one. It was really good! I'll make them exctly the same way next time!

Doubled the batch and made the mistake of grabing the almond extract instead of the vanilla, so, added 1 almond and 1 vanilla. We loved them. My husband and I couldn't stop sneaking another one. Peanut Butter aren't my favorite cookie but they are now.

This cookie is perfect!  I have been looking for a long time for a peanut butter cookie with a high ratio of peanut butter.  These cookies are nicely crispy but still soft on the inside.  What a great cookie!!

I wanted to use up cashew butter that I had, so I used 1 cup instead of the peanut butter and used regular butter with 1 cup dark brown sugar. They were wonderful, very rich flavor and a nice soft texture.

These turned out great.  I used just over half a teaspoon of salt and it was plenty.  My husband likes not so sweet cookies, but I eat sweets rarely enough that I think the sweeter the better.  My compromise was that half of these got a quick roll in granulated sugar (make sure you shake off the excess) before I flattened them out with a fork.  Definitely a great peanut butter cookie recipe though, no matter where it came from!

This recipe (accidentally or not) is right off the back of the JIF jar, but okay.

very tasty! This is one of the best peanut butter cookie recipes. I used freshly ground honey peanut butter, and this turned out sweet and moist!

Fantastic!  I used the other reviewers' suggestions about substitutions and was very pleased.  I took these cookies to a poker game and came home with an empty tin!

Although this recipe delivers a very delicious cookie which tastes excellent, the cookies harden quickly. They become stale after a few hours.

I have made these cookies every year for the past 3 years and for the past 3 years, I always had lots of cookies left over...except for these!!! My family loves these cookies!  I, too, think they're delicious...not too sweet either.  I think they are best made with Peter Pan peanut butter.

Everyone in my house loved these cookies.  It was the best peanut butter cookie recipe I have worked with.  I even added peanut butter chips this year (previous years, I just followed the recipe) and it came out really good.  Keep it up with this recipe.

My daughters and their friends loved these. I wasn't quite so keen hence only 4 stars. I felt you couldn't really taste the peanut butter but they came out of the oven and just vanished! So will be making again thanks

I thought this recipe would be an awesome recipe because of all the remarks made on it. I'm sorry but it was an okay cookie for me...did not have the full peanut butter flavor I am looking for.  I will keep looking.  Thanks anyway.

I loove this recipe, I don't use any other recipe to make peanut butter cookies (My favorite!). Some modifications I think help further the yumminess is to put 1 cup peanut butter, and less salt.

Loved them! I left them in the drop shape instead of the traditional fork flattened peanut butter cookie, and they were moist and so good! Going to add chocolate chips to the next batch!

These are pretty good cookies.  I had to cook mine for 7 minutes or else the top got a little too brown.  Also, I sprinked a little cinnamon on the top of the cookies before cooking them, always a yummy extra!  I only got 36 cookies out of the recipe...don't know if I make my cookies a little on the large side or I ate to much dough:)

This recipe was great! I used chunky peanut butter instead and it tasted even better. The cookies ended up coming out slightly crispy on the outside but warm and soft on the inside. I will definetly use this recipe again!

I bake a lot of cookies and I like this one the best!  Even after I ran out of all-purpose flour and had to substitute in whole wheat flour it came out great.  They were quick and easy to bake.  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

These cookies are chewy goodness!  I used butter flavored shortning and added peanut butter morsels.  I did think that I made them wrong, but the batter is just loose.  I had to cook them just about 2 minutes longer than suggested.  They are delicious, just as stated!

I halved the recipe and put 1/2 cup of peanut butter, substituted a little butter for some of the shortening, slightly reduced the sugar. I baked for about 9 minuted and loved the texture, soft inside and slightly cripy on the edges. However, it was too sweet for my taste and a little too much peanut butter. I would halve the amount of sugar and use the amount of peanut butter in the recipe or only increase it slightly.

Very, very yummy. A little too soft, but they practically melted in my mouth, which is not such a bad thing... I baked them for 8 minutes at 375 degrees, and next time I'll try 9 minutes.
I substituted sweet unsalted butter for the shortening, and used a full cup of chunky peanut butter. It made 39 cookies. Next time I will double the recipe, because I know they'll go like lightning !

The only thing I did different was I used a whole cup of Peanut Butter, not 3/4 and it was awesome! They were very easy to make and I'll definately use this recipe again.  I find them a little flaky around the edges but very soft in the middle.  YUM! Thanks, this will be added to my recipe box :-)

I would have said only 3 stars with the recipe as is.  However, I added more peanut butter and it was really good.  I criss-crossed the top with a sugar coated fork also.  I think next time, I will substitute pet milk for added richness.

Yum, yum, yum!! These cookies were great and very easy to make. I had my 11 and 4 year olds help too and we loved the outcome. I found it easier to make small balls and then flatten them with a fork dipped in sugar.I am going to make a whole new batch to treat my husband and his fellow soldiers before the head out on a field exercise!

These cookies came out great--not too sweet or oily.  I added some mini M&Ms to some, some mini Reese's Pieces to others, and made a dozen "Blossoms" with Hershey Kisses.  Yum!  I do recommend flattening them out a bit before baking, though.  They don't spread out quite enough if you leave them in balls.

I've been searching for a peanut butter cookie recipe that turns out soft and chewy cookies, that have a great peanut butter taste, but are not overly rich.  This recipe hits the mark!  Thank you!

The end product was pretty good but, the cookies did not stay together very well. You had to be very gentle with them or they would crumble all over. I will probably make these ones again as the end result of them is worth it!.

Fantastic! Had to subsitute bread flour for the all-purpose flour and water for the milk and they still turned out GREAT! baked up really nicely at 350. But if you don't like brown sugar in your peanut butter cookies, you probably won't like em!

I liked the texture result of this recipe most of all.  They were a little crisp on the bottom and chewy in the middle, which I love in any cookie.  However as I went through the recipe I suspected that there was too much vanilla, baking soda, and too little flour.  An accomplished chef friend of mine really raved about them, and took some home to his family. If you like old fashioned tasting recipes this one is good because the brown sugar really brings out a molasses taste that reminded me of my great-grandmother's gingersnaps.  But if you want your cookies to taste like the gourmet bakery's down the street, this recipe is not for you.

They turned out great!  However, I put in one cup dark brown sugar and a third cup white sugar.  I also cut the salt by almost half and cut the vanilla by about a third.  I baked at 350 and I only used one egg.  Don't use two....one was perfect.  Enjoy!

These cookies turned out great!!!  They didn't burn or stick.  I baked them at a lower temperature then what was suggested.  I lowered the temperature to 350' cooking at 8 minutes.  I also used 3 tbsp of water instead of milk and a tbsp of molasses.  I increased the sugar amount to 1 and a half cups and I added a lot more peanut butter.  I also flatened the cookies with the universal fork technique.  The cookies turned out great even though I kinda changed somethings around.  Thanks for the receipe, I will definately use it again.

I am in the middle of baking these right now but i had to come and right this review. These cookies are pretty good i followed the suggestions of other reviews and put in 2 eggs(too much), white and brown sugar and less salt and vanilla. Over all they were really good, but i like the batter a little thiker because I like the  fork marks in the middle. I had to push the cookies down with my hand because the batter kept sticking to the fork.Thank you for the recipe Carla I will make these again.
                         *Beth

Unfortunately, these cookies did not work for me.  As other reviewers have stated, it lacked flavour (I had added extra peanut butter, too). Mine were ready in 7 minutes.

This recipe is the best peanutbutter cookie recipe I have tried in a long time.  I took a batch to a BBQ today and everyone wanted the recipe.  This is a five star recipe in our family.  A friend of mine used to bake cookies for Treats and she told me to use an ice cream scoop  to put the dough on the cookie sheet, it seems to work really well.

soooo good!!  My 5 yr old (who HATES pb) enjoyed helping me make (and eat!) these.  These super-peanut buttery, chewy cookies are my new favorite.  I can't find enough pb lovers to recommend them to.  Thanks!!

Very good texture. I did not use "light" brown sugar as the recipe calls for so the color of the cookies was darker than I would like (due to the dark brown sugar I used I guess). I added a 1/4 cup or so of chopped peanuts which I think adds a little something. The taste of these cookies was definitely pb but the overall taste didn't dazzle me like I thought it would per the good reviews. Maybe I expected too much. Next time I may sub butter for shortening. Maybe that will add to the dazzle factor!

Loved this! Nice pb taste, soft but not crumbly, just a wonderful cookie. Doesn't spread out like some do. Will make this again!

Makes a basic cookie, there's something lacking and I haven't yet figured out what it is. Defintiely easy enough to throw together in a hurry though.

I'm sure it's a really good recipe; we're just really bad cooks.
