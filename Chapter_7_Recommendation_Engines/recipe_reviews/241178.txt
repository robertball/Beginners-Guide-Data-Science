This recipe was just too sweet for my tastes. It needed some form of salt and also something sour to balance out the sweetness of the sauce. If I make this again I will probably add a teaspoon or so of soy sauce and a couple drops of toasted sesame oil. Also either a couple squeezes of lemon juice or a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar. The rum did give it a nice flavor.

Was really good. Ran out of maple syrup so used honey instead. Saved it in my favourits to use again. There is very little sauce but it was just enough since it is sweet. I recommend people trying it before dismissing it.

Alright I've done this before. Syrup goes with meat it's weird and I get it. But seriously three ingredients? It. All. Works! And very well! Hubby complained that the salmon I picked wasn't from the fresh place he prefers but he still ended up licking his plate (nope no manners over here when the food is this good!). We'll be rotating this into our regular weeks for SURE.

Salmon is a favorite and I have cooked it and dined on it many time. Hands down this is the best salmon I have ever made or cooked.

It’s a great combination of flavors, I like a bit of spice against my sweet, I add jalapeños to mine while marinating and then cook them either with the fish or in the sauce. Your choice

sauce was sweeter than I expected. the color and consistency was nothing like picture shown very thin and much lighter in color. I also baked it at 400 for only 15 minutes and it was well done. I used real maple syrup so I don't know if that made a difference. Overall I was not impressed.

This was quite good! Since other reviewers said that it was too sweet I added 1tbsp of soy sauce. It was still sweet but not overly so. I thought it paired very well with the salmon. I'll definitely try this again but I'll add Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce and see how that turns out.
