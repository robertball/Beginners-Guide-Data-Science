I, personally, have never used potatoes in my tuna casseroles (never thought to; DUH!) but my Daughter used this recipe as a base for a cooking class she's taking at our local CC. She "tweaked" it by using 4 cans of albacore tuna (it was on sale/50% off) rather than 3 and adding 1 Knorr's vegetable boullion cube to the "potato water". She added 1/2 stick of butter and 1 T. fresh chives to the potatoes when she "mashed" them (with our hand mixer) and tossed the tuna with 1/2 tsp. fresh dill, 1 tsp. ReaLemon, 1 stalk of celery (chopped fine), 1/2 medium zucchini, 2 carrots (she used our "vegetable peeler" to give them a "julienned" look) and some mushrooms (whatever I had in the refrigerator). Then she "layered" it: bottom layer - potatoes with parmesan cheese (all 3 T.); middle layer - the tuna mixture; top level - more of the potato mixture (no parmesan, but 3 slices of Mozzarella "folded" in). She TOPPED her "presentation" with 3 slices of Provolone (a little bit more of a "kick" but not overpowering) and baked it for 25-30 minutes. HER recipe made 2 "presentations", so she used 4 eggs, 3/4 cup of 2% milk and 1 cup of vegetable boullion (for moisture). My Daughter got an "A" for her assignment and I've been delegated to making no fewer than 6 of "her creations" for a Lenten "pot luck" at our Church. In brief: we felt this was a good basic recipe but only with her/our added "tweaks" would we give it 5 stars.

I used Chedder cheese in place of mozzarella, which I didn't have onhand.  It was sooo good, such a nice break from plain old tuna casserole.  My picky two year old even liked it!  I also threw some "three cheese breadcrumbs" on top before baking.

I wanted to try this recipe as a change from my famous tuna noodle casserole. After reading the other reviews, I decided to spice up this one by using sour cream instead of milk, adding a little butter and whipping cream, and sauteing both onions and carrots before adding them to the casserole. I also used just a dash of Morton's Nature's Seasons. Turned out great!

I have been making this for years, and just looked up the recipe again because I am making it today.  My changes: I use sweet onion that I dice and carmelize in butter first, use 50% more tuna, a mixture of jack and sharp chedder,a dash of cayenne, and double the parmesan. Delish!

Tuna? Potatos? What could be better than combining the two together.  This was very good and really easy to make.  I didn't have green onions on hand so I used French Fried Onions and it was really good.  I will make this again but I think I might add a little cheddar in place of some of the mozzerella cheese next time.  This one's a keeper.

I was excited to try this recipe...who could go wrong with tuna and potatoes... I found this to be very dry despite adding sour cream and extra cheese. However, the flavor was pretty good (I did add some mustard and spices as suggested by others) and my kids loved it. I'll probably play around with the recipe a bit to increase the moisture.

after reading the reviews, i decided to use this recipe 'n changed it a bit. I used 2 chopped green onions (so the food looks better and it gives it a bit of a crunchy taste). I used one cup of mozerella and one cup of cheddar cheese. i added my own spices..salt, pepper and steak spices. My brother and my sister loves it. but i don't...beacuse i'm not a big fan of wet mooshy food.

This is similar to a recipe that I make... try adding a spoonful of mustard to the mix and using mature cheddar for some added zing.

This recipe sounded good, but I was really disapponted. I used a shredded cheese blend and added some salt and pepper, but it was just too bland and really dry.

I like to try new ideas that I find on the web. Unfortunately I was not to pleased with the flavor of this recipe. I do agree with a different kind of cheese and a lot more of it, there would have been a lot more taste.

I enjoyed this dish very much!  I was looking for something to do with canned tuna, but not just another casserole because I'm not a big fan of baked pasta dishes.  This turned out great! 

I did find the recipe difficult to work with, though, because of the some of the measurements used.  I don't have a kitchen scale, so I had to estimate the amounts of potatoes and mozzarella (acutally, I used cheddar, like several other reviewers!).  Another drawback to this dish is that  it is quite time consuming to make.  It was worth  the time and effort, however!  Thanks, Adriana!

I am really sorry...but this was just not good at all.  Very dry and flavorless except for the taste of tuna.  It was edible (hence, 2 stars instead of 1)...but definitely not memorable.

I made this recipe tonight and there was no spice in the recipe.  I added salt and a pepper blend.  My husband thought it was still bland.  Next time we are adding Cheddar cheese and some peas.

I didn't find this recipe as appetizing as I had hoped.  It was almost like a shepard's pie.  Alot of mashed potatoes and not enough spice.  It was okay but not excellent.  More cheese would have helped the flavor I believe.

There needs to be more tuna and needs some other spice.  It is a fairly good basic recipe, but it needs a bit of tweaking.

I'm glad I read the other reviews before beginning this meal.  I knew to add more cheese, and flavoring.  I agree that 3 cans of tuna was not enough.  This meal was basically nothing more than baked mashed potatoes.

My husband, who usually is not too fond of tuna casseroles, really enjoyed this recipe and would like to have it again. However, it was not well-liked by my children, and was just okay to me.

The flavors are good and potatoes complement the tuna, but visually it is unappealing and the mashed potato texture doesn't feel like an entre.   Definitely serve it with something green.  Maybe leaving the potatoes very lumpy would help, and adding parboiled celery and carrots would make it more like a meat pie.

I have to agree with others who have commented on the blandness; this recipe could do with some extra zing.  Also, adding more cheese was definately a helpful tip, as I used about three times what was called for.

It was good but a couple of suggestions would be in order. 
Double the Tuna, add some heat either hot sauce or a couple of chillies, use cheddar or tasty cheese instead of mozzarella, triple the eggs,  add fresh herbs and garlic. 

I added garlic and Basil, tripled the eggs and doubled the tuna the first time me and my wife made it. We decided it needed different cheese and some heat. 

It was a good basic recipe and whipping the potatoes is a brilliant idea. Good luck in your cheffing endeavours.
