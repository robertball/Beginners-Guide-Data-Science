the direction said to cut the marshmallow in half to make two circles... however, my "eyes" kept slipping off because of the arc shape all around.  next time, rather than cutting length to length... i'll cut it from width to width forming only an arc at the top and flat surface at the bottom.  (overall, very very cute and 3 kids and husband enjoyed them.  thanks for the idea.)

These turned out cute! They were fun to make and pretty easy too! 
The only change I made was I used the peel licorice to make a red mouth.
 Make sure you put a little more batter in the muffin cups than usual so you have a nice round surface to make your frog on! 
Very cute idea- big hit with everyone!
I made them for "Leap Day" 2-29-2008. I look forward to making them again...in four years! :)

These are really cute and super easy to make.  I used the green sugar as called for in the ingredients on half of the cupcakes and used green sprinkles for the other half.  I changed the eyes on some with larger chocolate chip pieces and used various gummy candy for the mouth/lips for different "Frog" expressions!  Thanks.

My daughter's first grade class just finished a unit on the rainforest and as a fundraiser to buy 2 acres of rainforest land, the class decided to hold a bake sale.  These frogs were perfect and my daughter was so proud!
Instead of sprinkling green sugar on top of the frosting, I tinted the frosting a deeper shade of green because I thought sugar on top of sugar would be a little much.  I used most of an entire bottle of green food coloring.  The cut of the marshmallow is crucial!  Like the other user, my marshmallows kept sliding off, so I switched the direction of the cut and no longer had a problem.  (It's much easier to cut the marshmallows with scissors instead of a knife.) I used red decorator gel instead of tinting the leftover frosting pink/red.  The most time consuming part of the decorating is "glueing" on the chocolate chips; I used a toothpick and put the frosting right on the chip.  I baked the cupcakes the day before and it took me nearly an hour and a half just to decorate them, so while they're really cute, I wouldn't make them just to make them.

My son has already asked me when we can make these again. I used heavenly white cake and easiest, most delicious meringue buttercream frosting, both from this site. We made regular size and mini cupcakes because my son wanted to make mommy/daddy and baby frogs.

I made these cupcakes today to take to a picnic playdate tomorrow and they are very, very cute...and although they are 'easy' to make, don't confuse easy with 'not time consuming'.  The cupcakes took a long time to prepare (nearly 3 hours including time for the cupcakes to cool), but I think in the end, they will be well worth it - the kids will love them!

I used a yellow cake mix and my own buttercream frosting. I followed the rest of the instructions for the froggy assembly! Easy to make, very cute, however they do take a little bit of time. Well worth it though!

very good idea - i made cupcakes & frosting from scratch, but used the frog idea ... my 6-year-old loved decorating the frogs - she made them have all sorts of funny faces ... like previous reviews said, it is a bit time consuming, but well worth it

Too cute. My son is in pre-school and all the classes have animal names. He is in the frog class so when I saw this recipe I had to make it. All of the 4 year olds LOVED them as did their parents.

Everybody loved them! I did use pipe cleaners to attach the eyes and then I didn't have to worry about them falling off. I also did mini frogs and used the small marshmellows for the eyes.

Absolutely amazing! I made these for my fiance's birthday party (he has two pet frogs) And he loved them. I followed the recipe except I cut my marshmallows width wise which made it easier to place on the cup cakes.

Came out awesome! I made my own buttercream frosting and Colored Sugar recipe from this website. I cut the marshmallows in half, and then cut a the bottom of each eye so it would be flat and easily stay on the cupcake. Instead of sprinkling the sugar on top, I just dipped each cupcake in the sugar and the shoke some off for an even coat.

I made these for my son's birthday with his class.  I chose it because it looked easy but then got totally scared by the reviews.  I would never spend 1.5 to 3 hours decorating cupcakes!  These took me about 30 minutes for 12 cupcakes and would have taken less if my 1 year old had not dumped chili powder all through the breakfast room:)  I do decorate a lot of cakes for my family but I think if you stay organized you should not give up a day to make these..you HAVE to use scissors on the marshmallows.  I cut them in half then cut a base so that they sat flat on the cupcake.  I poked a hole in the sticky end with the scissors and pushed the point of the chocolate in and didn't even have to bother with frosting to make it stick since I pushed it in really well.  I used gel for the lips BUT, although that looked great, I noticed that the two cupcakes that were still around 12 hours later had bled everywhere and the gel was REALLY messy with the kids.  These were faster and easier than they were given credit for and I got a lot of compliments on them.

Cute idea but extremely time consuming and the frosting kept sliding off the cupcakes which meant the mouth and eyes did as well. I wouldn't mind spending the time if they at least stayed together once you got them done. Irritating since I followed the directions exactly as they were posted. Probably will never make them again.

These look great, kids went mad for them.  They weren't too hard to make but had a really professional look. I made a batch for a fundraiser and got an order for a dozen more!

These were sooo cute. The kids had so much fun making them. We didn't have the food coloring so we had to sprinkle lots of green sugar crystals but it did the job. The only problem we had is that the marshmallows (the eyes) kept rolling off the cupcake. Although the kids got a kick out of it,  I think next time I will take other reviewers advice and cut the marshmallows from a different angle making easier to keep the eyes on. But overall it's a fun activity to do with the kids, and of course, they're delicious.!

I love this idea. It's so cute and so easy. I would use brown icing for the mouths, otherwise they might not show up. For what it's worth, I ran out of decorator sugar at cupcake 12. I used the White Cake Frosting I recipe from the site.

So cute and worth the effort. My tips...1)put the green sugar in a dish, after you frost the cupcakes then turn them upside down and gently press the tops into the sugar.  You will then get nice coverage and a flatter surface to work on. 2)cut the marshmallows on the diagonal, lengthwise, so that you get a full round end on each piece.  It will then sit easily on the top of the cupcake.  Use scissors. 3) use dark chocolate morsels for the eyes, they really stand out.  4) don't skip making the frosting green, it looks better than white frosting. 4) I used a small tube of white decorating frosting to adhere the eyes to the marshmallows. I think this is easier than putting frosting on a toothpick and then onto the chocolate morsel.  I also used a small tube of black decorating frosting to draw on the nose and mouth.  This was a really fun project but does take some time.

I made my own frosting from a buttercream recipe here on allrecipes.  These frog cupcakes, I made today for my daughter's 4th birthday - Princess and the Frog theme. They were a big hit, I got so many compliments on how cute they were!  Warning, they are SOOO time consuming!!  I'm glad I did them, but be warned - make them early! Hahah. I used a gel-writing-icing that comes in its own tube so I didnt need to mess with the red food coloring.  I made the mouths different they were really cute ;)

My kids made these for our herp club (reptiles and amphibians).  We cut the marshmallows in half and used them "flat" so they would stay up for our drive.  They were a huge hit - everyone was talking about them!

I made this recipe for my son's preschool and it was a big hit!!  Instead of sending in all regular size cupcakes, I made 6 cupcakes in my 1/2 dozen pan.  I decorated two into frogs, these were the "teacher frogs" (the other 4 I left at home for my husband and other children).   I then baked the rest of the batter in mini muffin pans and these were the "student frogs".  This seemed to save time and the mini's were more than enough sugar/cupcake for 3 & 4 year olds!!

Very easy, and very cute.  I cut each marshmallow twice, widthwise and lengthwise, so I ended up using only 6, as each yielded 4 "eyeballs." I'm also unsure of this whole "glue the chocolate chip on with frosting thing"  I knew that would be a fiasco, so I just jabbed the pointy end of each chocolate chip into the marshmallow till it was attached... much easier and less time consuming.  I also didn't bother with the red food coloring, i just used brown and pink decorators icing to make the nostrils, mouth, and tongue.  Overall, the kids LOVED these and I would definitely make these again!!

Used my own cupcake & frosting recipe (time consuming, but way better than the boxed stuff!) and I took the suggestion of others and used scissors to cut the marshmellows. MUCH easier than with a knife! These are super cute, and a huge hit with kids.

So fun for a birthday party.  We wanted green cupcakes so we started with the white cake mix, added a box of pistachio flavored instant pudding and then drops of green food coloring until it was nice and green.  Store bought green frosting (a christmas issue) was used as well as the green sugar sprinkles.  after cutting the marshmallow in half we stuck the sticky side in the green sprinkles (don't frogs have green eyes?) and frosted the outer portion of the marshmallow.  The chocolate chips were stuck on with a dip into the frosting.  Different shaped red mouths finished them off.  Not a quick recipe, but worth the effort. Have fun with these!

So cute and easy - just time consuming on the decoration. I used the "Crazy Cake" recipe on this website for the cake and made "Marshmallow Icing". They were adorable.

I made these frogs for my son's 3 year birthday party and they turned out great. It does take a bit of time, but the end result if worth it. I recommend cutting the marshmallows into quarters for the eyes...this will make it much easier to attach them and seem more proportional all around. I also used red decorator icing for mouth. Super cute. FYI, your fingers will turn green and so with the mouths of the those who enjoy them : ).

Made these for my daughter's 2nd bday.  They were a huge hit!  I quartered the marshmallows as others suggested and used chocolate icing to make mouths and two little dots for noses.  Very cute in a cupcake tower.  Thanks for the idea.

Great! My 2 1/2 year old son and I made these for a fall treat. I think the green sugar is the "icing on the cake" so to speak. Without it, the frog wasn't as cute. However, the frogs don't look great for more than about a day or two. The marshmallow eyes start to droop and the sugar begins to bleed. You might try storing them in the fridge, but not sure that would extent their life anyways. For what ever reason, my son liked dipping the cupcakes in the sugar, but never at completed frog.  :)

I made these cupcakes last year for all the kids at our family do and they totally loved them. I didn't use the green decorator sugar because you really don't need it after colouring the icing. However you make them they will be a hit. I'm going to make them again soon.

I made these for my daughter's fourth birthday to take to school and they were so cute! I loved them! i did not sprinkle sugar on the cupcakes but did use them for the eyes. They are time consuming and when you have two kids with you in a craped kitchen they take literally 3 hours to make. I made the cupcakes earlier and i made frosting(grocery store frosting from this site) and they did not stay on as well as I had hoped but it was still ok. i think next time I will buy the artifical frosting from the store to make it a little easier on me! Now i seriously understand why moms take short cuts!!!!

After making 30+ of these babies, I found a way to speed up the tedious process of decorating these cupcakes.  First, cut the marshmallows in half as directed, since the round big eyes they create gives them visual appeal.  After rolling in green sugar, glue the chocolate eye on the "sticky" side using frosting.  Then, with one finger on the "unsticky" side and your thumb on the chocolate chip, place them FIRMLY on the frosting.  These were definitely worth the work involved - sooo cute!  My daughter helped by glueing on the chocolate chip.  We decorated some frogs with green sugar on the frosting (like instructed) and some without, and we decided that they were cuter without. Lastly, we used red Twizzlers "pull-n-peel" to make the mouth.

These were simple and easy and went very well with my son's classroom theme which was frogs!  I made about 80 in total and 20 of them were in ice cream cones.  They were a huge hit for all the kids in their classes!

I didn't actually eat one, but I imagine it would taste like any other cupcake.  I am giving it five stars because they are so cute.  They are extremely time consuming, I only made twelve and it took quite a while.  The only thing is I don't think these are good for kids to help with because of the food coloring (I am an adult and even my fingers are stained!) but they are precious and kids will love to eat them, but don't try to get these done in a hurry, they are quite a project.

Great, cute idea! To make your own green sugar (so you don't have to buy it) you can put sugar and one or two drops green food coloring (or one drop blue, one drop green) in a plastic bag the day before and mix it around. Once the food coloring is distributed evenly, leave it in the open bag overnight. In the morning, the sugar will have dried out and viola! Green sugar for a low price!

I cut the marshmallows at an angle (corner to corner) so that the eyes were more visible" from above.  Also, I had a hard time cutting the marshmallows with a regular knife, so I pulled out the electric carving knife and sliced them in minutes (be extra careful!).  You have to put the icing on thick or the marshmallows roll off the cupcake.

These cupcakes were super easy/quick, and cute!  We did opt to quarter the marshmallows as that worked better for the eyes.  I used white icing (not water) on the tops of the eyes before rolling in the green sugar.  It was a fun little project.

Used yellow cake mix and made my own powered sugar frosting.  For ease, I just bought a tube of chocolate frosting and used it to dot the eyeballs and draw the mouths - less hassle than sticking chocolate chips on marshmallows and separating the frosting. They are *very* cute and would be great for a young child's birthday party.   Tip:  Tear apart twizzlers and let it hang out of the mouth like a frog's tongue.  You could even add a raisin or chocolate chip at the end so it looks like a fly.  :D

Very cute cupcakes!  Made these for my daughter's 2nd birthday and yes, they are time consuming and tedious but well worth it.  I cut the marshmallows in half and then cut a little piece off the bottom to make them sit flat.  Used a mini pair of tongs for dipping the mallows in water and then coating w/ sugar.  That was the hardest part I think.  Putting the chocolate chip eyes and the mouths on was easy.

My granddaughter (age 9) and I made these cupcakes - she did most of the work, but I did have to put the chocolate chips on the marshmallow eyes - everybody loved them - we will probably make them again.

I've never had people rave about a dessert as much as this one. I made them for kids, but the adults are just as crazy about them.

My daughter LOVES frogs, so for Easter, we made these and bunny cupcakes. We used carrot cake, and cream cheese icing. For the eyes for the frogs, we cut 3 circles from 1 large marshmallow, and cut them in half moons, making 3 sets of eyes per mashmallow. Stayed in place real well. For the bunny ears, we cut a marshmallow longways, then cut it widthways, making 2 pairs of ears per marshmallow. Used mini choc. chips for frog pupils, pastel m&m's for bunny eyes, Twizzler red string licorice for mouths, and used cut pieces of Fruit Rollups for frog tongues and bunny noses. This will become a family favorite and tradition!

I have made this cupcake to send in for my son's first grade class as his birthday treat.  Everyone whom saw them were all amazed by how cute they were!  I posted the picture on my FB, and I got good comments:)  Thanks for the idea!

I made two dozen of these cupcakes for a graduation party, and they completely disappeared! The kids absolutely loved them, and in addition to being really cute they tasted great too. I will definitely be making these again!

What a hit! I did this for my son's 1st birthday and everyone absolutely loved it.  I cut out lily pads out of green paper and layed them all over the table then set the frogs on them.

I made these for my daughters preschool class and they were a big hit with the kids.  I made as is and sprinkled green jimmies all over as well.  I bought a few tubes of the different colored writing icing to make it easier to make the mouths and it worked perfect.  The red mouths looked the best.  Will make again in the future.

Very easy to make but a lot of work.  Took 3-4 hours to make but the results were great.  Patty and my co-workers thought it was very cute.

Thanks for such a fun and easy decorating design.  My daughter had a bake sale fundraiser, so I was looking for something eye-catching but easy.  I let my two daughters, 9 & 10, do all the decorating, and they were adorable!  They made both the frogs and pigs, and they were one of the first things to sell out.

These turned out so cute.  My son had just finished studying frogs in one of his classes, and the teacher told the kids to bring in something "unfrogettable".  He brought these, and everyone loved them!

A huge hit with the kids - and yes, they are a little time consuming to decorate, but well worth the effort.  I used little confetti hearts for a nose and string licorice for a smile!  A FUN recipe!!!

These were easy and delicious.  Of course you can pick any flavor cake you want, so we chose chocolate.  My 4 year-old niece went crazy when she saw them.  Brownie points for me.  :o)

very cute idea, thanks! I ended up using the perfectly chocolate cake recipe from the back of the cocoa box for the cupcakes. They made a nice flat surface to make the froggie heads on. I also used thin red licorice for the smile and two red hot's for the nose. Thank's!, they were well received!

I made these for my mom's bake sale, and they came out cute - time consuming - but cute. I probably won't make them again though (no bad reason I just won't)I did have a few problems with the marshmallows not standing up, but that was all. I used M&M's for the eyes, and made my colored sugar with the Colored Sugar recipe from this site so I wouldn't have to go buy some. Can't wait to hear how they sell.

I just made these for my 4 year old daughters preschool class.  Cute idea, but my problem was getting the marshmellows to say on.  Next time I will use the green icing as glue when putting them on.  The icing on the cupcake alone didn't hold some very well.  This is not a project for little kids to help with.  Pretty much to wrap it up, as these are very cute but a major pain in the rear.  But us moms do anything for our kids.

These were the cutest frogs!!  I cut the large marshmellow in fourths and worked great, so did using a toothpick to dip in the water and sugar.  Thank you so much for the great idea.

I made these last night. They came out perfect. I used others advice and cut marshmallows in quarters.. Tip-I stuck my finger on the sticky side of marshmallow as i dipped it in water then in sugar...worked like a charm. I prepared the marshmallows while cupcakes were baking and cooling. Saves alot of time!

This is a great recipe!  I had so much fun making it for my son's birthday party.  While it does take some time to assemble, it is worth it to see my son's excitement when he saw these finished cupcakes.  They were very easy to assemble (and i'm NOT a very creative person at all!).  I took the advice of other users and cut the marshmallows lengthwise with scissors and then dipped the top part of the marshmallow in a little bowl of water then rolled the wet marshmallow in the green sugar.  The water really helps the sugar stick.  I also used a little bit of frosting to "glue" the eyes to the marshmallow.  I used the recipe for Rick's buttercream frosting (on this site) and colored it green with Wilton's icing colors.  They look and taste so good!

I made these for my son's first birthday party.  A huge hit with all in attendance.  I could only find mini and jumbo marshmallows in my area, so I quartered the jumbo mallows.  Then I used a mini chocolate chip in the middle.  Thanks for such a great idea.

I made these several times now. For those of you who suggested using a toothpick to wet the marshmellows-that would take all day! I use little kids paint brush to wet the sides I need wet. Also, the same brush works awesome for painting the white icing right on the chocolate chip. PS. And I always cut the marshmellow in quarters, they don't slide off at all.

These were SUCH A HIT for the kids' fifth birthday!! I did use the mini marshmallows (Due to I can use up the leftover ones better than the big ones), and mini chocolate chips.  These weren't as bad or time consuming as expected from some of the reviews.  Actually, once you get into your groove, you can whip these out rather quickly.  (USE A LITTLE DOLLOP OF FROSTING TO ATTACH THE CHIP TO THE MARSHMALLOW!!) And, used red gel frosting for the mouths.  Awesome, Awesome, AWESOME!

My youngest son is obsessed with frogs, so I made these for his 6th birthday this weekend. They were a big hit.
I did have trouble with the marshmallow eyes wanting to slide off, and I used quite a bit of extra frosting heaped on in order to hold them in place. In the future I will trim the marshmallows to be semi-circles with flat bottoms, hopefully that will solve the problem. I also pushed the pointy end of the chocolate chip into the marshmallow to make the pupil, instead of using a dot of icing, as suggested in the how-to video. This was time consuming, and they looked as if they wanted to pop out (although none did) Next time I will use a food writer pen and just draw the pupil on.

So cute!  Made these for my son's third birthday to bring to preschool.  I was worried about the green sugar melting if I made them night before so I decided to bake them and frost them the night before and finish decorating the next morning (which at 5:00am I didn't think was such a great idea....).  They were so cute and the kids loved them.  I had a few left over and served them the next day and the sugar was still fine.  So go ahead and make them the day before.  Also, I used icing for the eyes as my son has a peanut allergy and every package of chocolate chips I could find was made in a plant that also processes peanuts...  They were still too cute!  Thanks for the recipe and idea.  Will definitely pass this on to others.

What a great idea!  I'm giving 5 stars for the decorating idea but used another cake recipe for the cupcakes (Lisa's chocolate chocolate chip cake recipe from this site).  These turned out so cute and was not difficult at all.  Thank you!

The Frog Cupcakes were a huge hit at my 2 year old son's birthday...the kids loved eating the face off & really enjoyed the eyes! After reading many reviews, I decided to make the cupcakes a day before & then decorate them the next day. My mom & sister helped me with decorating them & we did 36 cupcakes in less than 1 hour.  So easy & simple, but if you're doing a lot of cupcakes...get help!!!

This was not nearly as hard as other reviewers commented.  It took me about 1/2 hour to decorate with the help of my 2 year old. He loved the frogs for his birthday cupcakes.  Very easy, I used black decorator gel for the eyes instead of chocolate chips.

Used chocolate cake and cream cheese frosting. The foil baking cups are a cute touch. Cut the marshmallows in half length-wise, then again half-wise to make 4 half moon shapes per large marshmallow. Used scissors per another reviewers recommendation. Also used toothpicks to dip the marshmallows as suggested. Finally, I used a ziploc bag with the tip cut off to make the froggy smile, as well as to glue on the chocolate chips.

I made these for my son's 6th birthday for him to share with the Kindergarten class. Big hit!! Instead of using store bought icing as I don't like the flavor, I made my own buttercream icing and tinted with green food coloring.

Super cute! They were a hit at my son's birthday party. Make sure to put the green sprinkles on while the frosting is still wet, otherwise they don't stick, and only put enough frosting to cover the cupcake. If you put more, they eyes tend to melt off.

My frog cupcakes turned out so cute and were a hit. I used the vanilla frosting tinted with green food coloring. I then dipped the frosted cupcake in green sugar I bought from Kroger. Just beware that this will get messy when little kids eat them. My poor niece Hannah's lips, tongue, and teeth were green:)

I just used the recipe as inspiration for the decor - I made mini cupcakes, the eyes are mini marshmallows, I drew the pupils on the mini marshmallows using one of those black gourmet food writer pens and the mouths are dissected Twizzlers. Big hit!

Did a frog themed B-day for my Grandson. I made a 9 x 13 cake as a pond and put the frogs around it - Everybody loved it!

Thy come in different size. nd I colored my batter green......although my neighbor boys said the inside should be red....kids gotta love em
