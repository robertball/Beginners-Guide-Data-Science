I cheated a little and used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh (needed pizza sauce in a pinch and didn't have many ingredients).  This is AWESOME with the canned tomatoes, and I imagine it's even better with fresh - I will be using this again and again!

VERY TASTY!...but I accidently put in the wrong herb! I didn't know it until hubby said how GREAT the sauce tasted, and not to buy jarred sauce anymore. Told him I went and picked the basil out of *his* garden. I told him where I got the herb and he said I used MINT instead of BASIL!!! Guess it was a great mistake flavor-wise for my family. (See the mint in the photo)  However, I will make this again with the basil to see if it truly is a 5* recipe!

This is my favorite pizza sauce recipe to use with Jay's Signature Crust. I swear, I think the pizza was better than anything you get delivered or from a specialty pizzeria! YUM! You might not like how "runny" the sauce is - if that is a problem, add a little tomato paste after blending.

I used 6 whole Roma tomatoes and added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes- the whole tomatoes and the red pepper added what the original recipe lacked.

my friends and i loved the fresh taste of this sauce when we made homemade pizza!  i find a lot of tomato sauces are too sweet for my tastes, so i omitted the sugar and increased the amount of pepper to taste (i like a lot of pepper).  it tasted great!

This was simply delicious. It was so easy to make and turned out extremely flavorful and colorful as well. Use big, ripe tomatoes for the best results. Overall, I highly recommend this recipe!!

I loved this sauce and so did my kids, who are tough to please. 
I added a tablespoon of tomato paste and started off by sauteing the paste, olive oil, and all the spices (minus the fresh parsley) for just a minute and then added the tomatoes.  I then let it simmer together for a few minutes and added the chopped parsley last. 

 I used what I had in the pantry: canned tomatoes (1 can), dried basil (about a tsp.), and added a little extra sugar (about 1 tsp. total) and used an immersion blender to mix it all up.

What a great, fresh sauce! My man dipped his finger in and said it was amazing and that I should make it this way all the time now. And it was so easy :) I subbed dry basil for fresh but used a little more fresh parsley; this will be a great recipe to play around with to create different flavors! Thanks for a great recipe-

I didn't really like how this pizza sauce turned out.  If you do make this I would leave the cinnamon out.  We thought it ruined the whole sauce.

An excellent sauce but two problems: 
1) Far too salty, as several reviewers have noted. Cut the salt by half and you'll do very well.
2) Too watery. Recommend seeding the tomatoes. 
Otherwise, a delightful blend of fresh spices and tomato flavors. 
If you want the same old thick, standard pizza sauce, then order Pizza Hut. This sauce is a keeper!

Loved the idea of making my onw pizza sauce especially with all the ripe tomatoes I have in the garden.  For me there was just a little bit to much salt.  And since I like things spicy I added a little chili spice.  Overall I loved the recipe. Thanks. :0)

This was very good! I used petite diced tomatoes from a can in place of the fresh & threw it all in my slowcooker w/pre-cooked meatballs for subs(leaving the sauce chunky). I'll def be using this recipe again! Update:made again using fresh roma's & didn't care for it as a pizza sauce....tasted exactly like a local restaurant's salsa recipe, no kidding. Came out very watery & a funky pink color too. If I hadn't made this w/canned & liked it previously, I wouldn't bother with it again. This time around it would get 2 stars :(

I really enjoyed this recipe! I made my own dough using Jay's Signature Pizza Dough and using this sauce made the pizza taste so fresh! It's kind of like fresh salsa; this was a nice change to the regular takeout or canned sauces.

This sauce would make an excellent marinara for pasta--it's so fresh tasting! If I make this again, I would cut out some of the salt--I used the amount specified and it was way too salty. Also, as far as use for a pizza sauce, this wasn't quite what I was looking for--its flavor got kind of lost among the rest of the things on the pizza

Great pizza sauce!  Used a can of diced tomatoes since that was what I had on hand, two cloves of garlic and dried herbs.  Will be using again for sure.

This is a wonderful sauce! I love making my own pizza now. Even my hubby likes it and he can get picky about homemade food vs fast food. I don't think I like the fresh tomatoes in it though. I added brown sugar instead of white and it helped a bit. I might have to start using can though. :(

I had a bunch of home grown tomatoes and I was tired of blts. This recipe was just what I was looking for. It made the best pizza with Jay's pizza crust. Mabe next summer I will try canning some for later. I just didn't have the time this year.

This was a really great sauce! It was the first time I'd made my own, and I sort of had to guess at quantities because I wanted to use a jar of diced tomatoes from a farm share box, but it turned out really well and was SUPER EASY to make. I love the hint of cinnamon! Will definitely make this again.

Beware, this recipe calls for way too much salt! I think it would have been good with just a little salt. I ended up having to wipe off the sauce completely to make my pizza edible again. :(

So fresh and a little sweet, loved the recipe. I just kind of threw the ingredients in a food processor and hoped for the best. Didn't even measure the ingredients, delicious and easy.

Tasty but - as another reviewe mentioned - this is more like a pasta sauce than a thicker pizza sauce.  I added tomato paste to thicken, but it didn't help.

Very, very good!  I agree you should use BIG ripe tomatoes or adjust seasonings according.  (We had one large and one small tomato and seasoning was too intense.)  Also,  hubby wanted smaller chunks, so processed longer to accomodate (it was Father's Day afterall) and it came out rather soupy on pizza.  Make according to directions for a 5 star pizza sauce!

MMMMMMM! This is so good I could eat it out of the bowl. I used fresh tomatoes and basil from my garden. I didn't add any sugar because my tomatoes were very sweet. I also didn't add any cinnamon because I thought it sounded a little wierd for pizza sauce.

This is the first pizza sauce i ever tried with fresh tomatoes. I used Roma tomatoes and I did not have fresh spices so I used jars. I really like the consistency of this after I put it in the processor. The only thing I would change was the Cinnamon. I did not like the flavor of it in the sauce.  Otherwise, it was great and I will make again.

This was delicious and easy to make, and a nice change from the typical tomato sauce pizza covering. I will definitely make it again.

I though this was very tasty as is, but you can certainly do more/less to it. I added onion and hot pepper, and definitely altered all the other ingredients according to taste. I did not use sugar. I plan on cooking it up and using the leftover in some kind of pasta casserole deal.

Delicious, although texturally it reminded me more of a fresh salsa than the kind of tomato sauce I prefer on pizza. I blended in a little tomato paste and then it was the consistency I was looking for, while retaining the fresh flavor. I did use all fresh herbs, because I had them on hand, which really made the flavor shine.

love it! i was making a calzone and realized i didn't have any pizza sauce at home and looked and found this one - i had everything at home except for the ripe tomatoes so i just used a can of tomato sauce and left out the oil and it turned out perfectly other than i may have added a little too much cinnamon - be careful! lol

This was wonderful! I don't think we have every had better. I made no changes except I had no fresh, ripe tomatoes. I used some home canned, drained, and then proceeded as written. This has gone in my book of favorites. Used it with the breadmaker pizza dough.

I tried this sauce the other day when I decided to make an at home pizza. The sauce turned out super tasty! I was alittle scared of the cinnamon, but I have to say that the cinnamon was a great addition, it gave the sauce an extra layer of flavor. I added alittle canned crushed tomatoes, only cause the tomatoes I had on hand weren't extra ripe. All in all great recipe...will recomend to a friend!!

This was the first time I made pizza sauce from actual tomatoes from the garden, and I thought it turned out really good. I like it not so chunky, so I ended upblending it fairly smooth and then cooking it briefly on the stove and added some corn starch to thicken it up. I am using it for Chicago style deep dish pizza, and think it will be perfect!

I used about 1/3-1/2 off all the spices because I used dried spices. Tasty with a slight hint of cinnamon. Pizzaria-style sauce.

This is a great sauce. I usually cook it a little to help the dry herbs soften and flavors to mix well.

We enjoyed this sauce.  I made it as directed, but added a bit of tomato paste to thicken, and a little extra sugar.  It made enough for one pizza.  I enjoyed knowing that the sauce was homemade with tomatoes from my garden.  It was fresh tasting and very quick in the food processor.

This was wonderful!  I used a can of diced tomatoes and dried herbs.  It was still five stars!  It was a wonderful dipping sauce, then I pureed the leftovers for spaghetti sauce.  It was great, though I think a little better for pizza than spaghetti. My only advice is that it was a tad salty -- likely because of the canned rather than fresh tomatoes.  If I don't have fresh on hand next time, I'll just salt to taste at the end.  

Thanks!  This recipe was so easy and just what I've been looking for for years!!

This was a really interesting sauce. I used tomato sauce, 8 oz. can. instead of the tomatoes. The cinnamon gave this an odd flavor at first bite, but it seemed to work after all. I wasn't sure whether I liked the cinnamon part of not, it was simply different. No one here commented on the sauce at all, so I suppose they liked it then. Easy to do and really fast too. No cooking time required. I had enough for 2 pizzas and still used only half the sauce. Thanks for sharing this I might make this one again.

Great fresh taste you don't usually find in pizza sauce.  I added a tablespoon of tomato paste after reading the reviews.  It was definitely thick enough to spread.  My husband thought it might be better even thicker, so next time I'll try 2 tablespoons.  Thanks for the recipe!

Too runny! I suggest adding cornstarch or really, tomato paste. This stuff mightve been alright for spaghetti sauce, but for pizza, it's not thick enough.

This sauce is fantastic! I loved the taste and it went so well with my pizzas. Having it a bit chunky was great and I had to stop myself from eating it straight out of the food processor. I used ripe tomatoes from the farmer's markets which are intensely red on the inside and taste like REAL tomatoes grown in someone's yard. I will be using this recipe as a salsa dip in future as I know it would go with anything. Yum, Yum.

This sauce is perfectly awesome if you cook it down after blending. Brought it to a boil then simmered on low for an hour or so. It gets thicker and the flavors are richer. I did omit the cinnamon...seemed a bit odd.

Fresh tasting, good sauce. I will come back to this time and again. I did modify it somewhat; I used canned fire roasted tomatoes since fresh are not in season. I prepared in a saute pan, starting with the garlic in a bit of oil and adding the rest of the ingredients.

Very good and the kids loved it.  I think using tomatoes is key getting a fresh taste to the sauce.  I added an 8oz can of tomato paste to thicken and doubled the sugar.  Store bought crust, shredded mozzarella mixed with grated parmesan and you're ready to bake in 15 minutes. In the oven at 425 degrees for 10-12 minutes.

I thought the flavour of this sauce was really nice, but more of a pasta sauce than a pizza sauce. Might make again for pasta night.

This turned out perfect in a pinch, I had all the pizza fixins and no sauce. The one reviewer said it was a bit runny, so I put it through a fine mesh strainer. LOVED IT! No more jared sauce!

I love that this can be made totally from scratch, but it sort of had a huskier flavor thatn I expected. Maybe I added too much cinnamon, or that I used 1 TBS of Italian Seasoning instead of the tsp's of basil, parsley and oregano, since that's what I had on hand. I used my blender to make this, since I don't have a food proccesor. I liquified a little and then I pulsed it to break up the tomatoes, but still leave it chunky enough. To overcome the runniness that others talked about I sqeezed the juice out my tomatoes after cutting off the stems. It was an okay consistency once it baked, and I if my husband were homw when we ate it, I don't think he would have known the diiference. I will definately use this recipe again.

GOOD SAUCE.  I didn't have fresh basil though and I used a can of No Salt added tomatoes instead, which I drained somewhat.  Thanks , I'll be using this recipe again. I think it will also be nice on pasta.

I used half the salt and freeze-dried oregano and used it as a pasta sauce instead of pizza sauce. I think it would probably be delicious as a pizza sauce. I'm not sure about the cinnamon, but I think that a pizza crust and toppings would probably round out that flavor a bit more.

I chose this recipe because I didn't have to cook it and I was very happy with the result. Tomato variety matters! I used a couple handful of small, homegrown fresh Amish Roma and San Marzano tomatoes. I seeded them because I was worried about a runny sauce like others reported but I needn't have. Paste tomatoes naturally have less juicy bits. Texture was perfect, almost creamy and not like salsa at all, and I paired the sauce with Jay's crust. Our guests raved it was the best homemade pizza they've ever had. I had enough sauce to cover two 12ish inch pizzas.

My wife thought it was okay, but I didn't care for this sauce and neither did one of my kids. It tastes too much like raw tomatoes (because they are raw) for me. In the future I'd make a sauce that was cooked over the stove top for a decent amount of time.

Excellent basic sauce. I eliminated cinnamon and substituted red pepper flakes for the black pepper. I cooked the sauce for about 30 minutes to try to thicken, and I also ran the finished product through a food mill to remove the seeds and any remaining chunks, as we prefer a smooth pizza sauce. The flavor is wonderful!

I used it over store bought ravioli, and it was delicious! I omitted the cinnamon and didn't have parsley, so I am not sure how it'd be with those things in it.

I loved this recipe! Just perfect to put as a base for the pizza, under all the other ingredients.
