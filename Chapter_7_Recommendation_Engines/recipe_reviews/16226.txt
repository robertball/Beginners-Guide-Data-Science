This salad was divine! My fiance absolutely loved it! I found when that if you toast fresh bread pieces in warm olive oil mixed with minced garlic it adds a great flavor.

This salad was wonderful!  Very fresh tasting and flavorful.  I chopped all ingredients in food processor except for tomatoes and bread.  Did not measure salad ingredients (only dressing).  Ended up with a lot of salad so I doubled dressing.  My picky husband enjoyed this!  The next day I used the salad (minus bread) as a sauce.  I sauteed boneless, skinless chicken breast pieces; added salad and heated through and served over pasta.  Very tasty.  Will definitely make this again!

Excellent taste.  Very fresh!  I kept the bread and salad separate, then we spooned each into individual bowls and tossed.  This way, leftovers won't be a soggy mess.  We added salt and pepper.

My husband and I loved this salad.  The first time I made it I did not have thyme or red onion.  I made it anyway and we thought that was delicious.  When I had all the ingredients and tried it again it was out of this world.  We both loved it.  Mozzarella is a nice addition to this also.  I did toast the bread and used only half of what was called for.  I will make this over and over again this summer.

Wonderful flavor!!  I only used 8 slices of bread, 4 toasted and 4 not toasted to see which way we liked it.  We much preferred the untoasted bread.  Thanks for a great recipe.

It is a must to toast the bread - left out the thyme.  Oh so good.

This is a GREAT salad.  I minced the garlic and added it to the dressing.  I also mixed the vingar (I used red wine) with a teaspoon of prepared mustard before combining with the oil so it would combine better.  I would toast the bread in the oven next time first so it won't be so soggy.  I left out the cucumbers and used all tomatoes too.

Yummy!  Make sure the bread is nice & stale.  I had fresh bread that I had  to broil to dry it slightly.  The bread still seemed to soak up all the oil & vinegar too quickly.

Very yummy. A great beginning to a summer evening on the back deck. Rather than rubbing the garlic, I used several (eg. lots) garlic cloves. Don't forget to cut them in half and take out the bitter core. Well worth the effort. Place these in a bowl add the olive oil and whizz (my new culinary term :) with an immersion blender. Strain this mixture and you have an awesome garlic olive oil that will keep for several days in the fridge.  I also toasted after coating the crusty bread bits with some of the garlic oil. Added an awesome layer of extra flavour! Thanks Tamara for a really nice recipe!

Great way to use that loaf of store-bought french bread that didn't get used on day one!  A wonderful mix of flavors--bread and salad all in one dish!  Very yummy!

Very good flavor.  It was a one-dish meal.  Make sure you have lots of bread on hand, cos you'll want to dip it in the dressing.

I loved this recipe. I used a sourdough jaba?? Dont know what a jaba is but it was a longish football loaf. I semi-toasted on lowest setting. I did not have red onion either and used empire sweet. I combined balsamic and red wine vinegar (is this a big no-no? ....was delicious) I was also out of cucumber and finally I did not have a wooden bowl. I used my garlic press and rubbed all over bowl.  Yum Yum! I love tomato season!

This salad smells so good. i was worried about the basil being to strong, but it was sooo good. I didn't have quite 2 cups of basil so I ripped up just a little spinach. My husband got really excited about this salad. He has plans to serve it when we entertain. I also added some seasoned chicken.

I really liked this! Great way to use up the garden produce. I didn't have a red onion so I used a shallot. My bread was brand new so I toasted it. I also thought the basil amount would be overpowering so I just used what I thought looked good. Added Mozzarello Balls, yum! Thanks!

A little unusual to have stale bread in a salad, but this is quite good! Going to look for it in Italy this summer :) Very yummy - we added in feta cheese and some black olives which I suppose made the salad more Greek than Italian, but the flavours really improved. If not a salad, this could also make a good bruschetta recipe.

Outstanding!  The only change I made was I used fresh parsley instead of the thyme, since that's what I had growing in the garden.  I will definitely be making this salad every summer, when the basil and tomatoes are in season!

Unique salad with great flavors. I didn't have any fresh basil and used dried and it was still very good. I can only imagine what it would taste like with fresh basil.

I made this salad for a birthday party that had an italian theme going on.  Although I thought it was good enough with the ingredients given in the recipe I wanted to make it a little more interesting. So, I added to the existing recipe; sauteed chopped pancetta, also, chopped up some artichoke hearts and used shaved parmesan cheese, for the dressing I made garlic & rosemary infused olive oil and balsamic reduction so the bread wouldn't get soggy as the reduction is more like a syrup. Buon divertimento!

This salad is super easy and a hit with our family.  I didn't have 2 cups of basil, but used approx. 1 cup - everything I had in the garden.  Very fresh.  We used ciabatta bread and toasted it in the oven like other reviewers suggested.  If I added some beans and a little cheese on top, it would have been a complete meal.  There wasn't any left!

A delicious hit. I added a regular lettuce mix to make it last longer and it was still delicious. I also recommend keeping the dressing and bread separate until time to eat to avoid it getting soggy (I took this to a potluck, but also had leftovers).

I love this salad, it's so fresh and delicious-a nice change from the regular italian fare!  I added cannelini beans, shaved parmesan, and used fresh italian flat leaf parsley instead of thyme.  I also lightly toasted the bread chunks first so it wouldn't get mushy.  It was SO good, my guest and I both had seconds and kept exclaiming "this is fantastic!"

This is one of our favorite summer salads. The trick is to add the croutons at the last minute. Try adding a ball of fresh mozzarella. We make a meal of this and gazpacho soup as a starter. Wonderful when all the ingredients are summer-ripe.

Update: 8/6 (Bright light on this recipe. Used just the crusty part of the Italian bread,which I baked in the oven first. Added salad greens, julienned green pepper, shredded mozzarella and a sprinkle of parmesan. Mom added sliced black olives to hers, and I did use the red onion this time around. Outstanding!) Original review: 7/21  Well, I did change this considerably. I chopped up the veggies, omitted the onion (used more tomato), added the herbs (used half the basil) along with fresh oregano,  dried rosemary, S&P and marinated for about an hour. Served as a salad with a nice fresh loaf of crusty bread on the side, and it was quite nice. (was worried about soggy bread.) Thank you, Tamara.

this was just an ok salad, i found that the basil and the thyme were way too strong. to help fill up the salad bowl, i added some baby spinach. the bread and the dressing were great ideas.

I feel like I might of used too much bread, I used half of what the recipe called for but it still seemed like a lot but maybe that's just my personal taste.  This was a very good salad, I found after I let it sit in the fridge overnight it had a lot more flavor the next day.  I probably would use less balsamic vinegar as well.

Yummy!  What a nice change from a greens salad.  Just right for the Pork Cacciatore dish (from this site) that I made last night with homemade tomato spaghetti.  Loved it and so did all of the family!

This was a very fresh and wonderful recipe for a summer salad. However, I found that 1 lb of bread seemed to be too much and overpowered the ingredients. Next time I would use less bread.

This was quick and easy. I used 1/2 the loaf and that was plenty. I had corn and black bean salad from AR left over and I added it to this salad to use it up.  I sprinkled Dried basil and drizzled Olive oil lightly over the bread and tossed the bread to coat and set aside until dinner. I added the bread right before serving with 1/2 a bag of salad and the leftover corn and black bean salad. Light and refreshing. Will add grilled chicken next time to make a complete meal. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipie for company but ended up not serving it.  The balsamic vinegar made the cucumbers look brown, and the dressing is too oily.  I will make this again but use white wine vinegar instead of the balsamic, and will cut the amount of oil in half.

Not bad. Bread needed toasting - should have read the comments and done that in the 1st place - slightly stale bread is not appetizing. The rest of the salad reminded me of bruschetta, so next time I'll just toast bread slices and top them with the salad blend.

I gave this a 5, but made quite a bit of changes.  I sprayed my bread cubes with olive oil and toasted them until they were golden.  I didn't measure anything, just put in as much as I thought we would like.  For the dressing I used olive oil, balsamic vinegar, 3 cloves of garlic (was a bit too strong), and dried rosemary (did not have any thyme).  I put all this in my electric chopper and it made a great emulsified dressing.  I also only used about two bunches of basil chopped and subbed spinach for the rest.  We had it with pasta and loved it!!  I served the bread cubes on top of the salad so they would not get soggy.  Easy recipe and so easy to modify to your taste.  Will be a staple now that the weather is heating up.  Thanks!

This is my new favorite salad! I used a roasted garlic bread instead of the fresh garlic the first time.. and it was amazing! The second time I made it, I used a rosemary bread and fresh garlic.. and it was good too! I like this recipe, becuase you can play with the ingredients a little bit. Some fresh pepper on top was nice too!

I brought this salad to a baby shower of a friend who loves garlic and tomatoes.  I got raves and guests asked for the recipe.  I think this is a unique dish for most people and is sure to impress.  My caveat . . . I added about 2T of capers for added texture.

Loved this salad! It was easy to make and delicious to boot. However, I'm not much on all the basil that was in it so I simply used only 1.5 cups. I also added minced garlic to the salad. Made garlic chicken to place on top - it was delicious! It won my husband's vote and he is a picky eater so that is hard to do!

My favorite salad ever.  I use about 4x the amount of olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and no thyme.  I have also made this with all of the chopped up fruits/vegetables straight out of the freezer, and let them sit in the salad to thaw overnight.

I thought the basil flavor was way too strong.  If I made it again, I would use at least half spinach instead of all the basil.

I really liked this. I doubled the recipe. I used 2 whole cucumbers even tho it amounted to more than the 2 cups required by the double recipe. Wasn't too much. I cut the bread in cubes and toasted @ 400 degrees for 5-7 minutes. Til just starting to get crisp. I think the bread would have been really mushy otherwise. I didn't combine the bread cubes with the rest of the salad until just before serving. I did not need all the dressing the recipe called for. Need to add salt and pepper. Will make again for sure.

I used a loaf of italian bread I bought off of the clearance rack, making sure it was nice and stale before I used it. This was absolutely delicous. I did add fresh minced garlic to the dressing. I do suggest that if you make this salad, do use a quality balsamic. It makes all the difference in how well it turns out. Next time, I might add a cup or so of quartered baby bellas and up the dressing just a touch.

Quite delicious! Only issue (for vegetarians like my brother) is there was no real protein as a meal by itself. So we added some red kidney beans. The flavor was only slightly changed (they were canned ^_^) and a full meal could be had. All in all, excellent!

If you can't find rosemary bread, mash/mince some into oil or even butter, spread on plain French/Italian bread then toast.  And you simply MUST have some Kalamata olives on the side!!! To die for! I like the cold meat idea too.

Very Good!! I grilled my bread first and it made it crunchy on the sides and soft in the middle. Didn't have fresh thyme but used a little Italian blend seasoning instead. Will make again!!

Fantastic!!! I followed the recipe exactly but grilled up some chicken slices with thyme, garlic, and basil. Added that to the salad for some extra umph! And kept the bread seperate till serving so it wouldn't get too soggy from the liquids. It was DELICIOUS! Great recipe!

Very impressive salad. I cut the bread into chunks and drizzled with olive oil and garlic and baked on a cookie sheet for a few minutes. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, chopping all the veggies fine. Delicious. Next time im gonna try keeping the bread in slices and making a brucshetta with the salad. Maybe add some kind of cheese.

This was good. I toasted my bread in olive oil and garlic like one reveiwer suggested, because my bread was fresh. I don't think I have the greatest tasting olive oil, so with that I think I should have mixed maybe 1\2 and 1\2; olive oil and salsd oil, it might not have had such a bitter taste to it.

This is awesome.  A diner near where I used to work served something similar to this as a special once a month.  They would add some chunks of Mozzerella and some squash or zucchini as well.  Yummy.

Yum, this was really good!  I followed the recipe exactly with a couple of minor exceptions.  I cut the recipe in half, I added a squeeze of honey to my dressing to cut through the vinegary taste, I added S&P to the dressing and I omitted the thyme because I don't really like it.  I did toast the bread cubes lightly and the end result was really delicious, satisfying salad!

What a unique flavor! The second time I made it, I cut the olive oil to a teaspoon and added some more balsamic vinegar, plus cut the bread in half to save on calories. It was still wonderful--even my dad loved it!

Really good.  I had never made a bread salad before, but since my husband is a huge bread lover (and not a salad lover) I thought I'd give it a try.  Huge hit.  Thanks for the recipe.

This salad is awesome! We ate it as the main dish and couldn't have asked for a more refreshing and flavorful dinner. I did not make any changes other than adding a bit more balsamic vinegar. This is easy to make and most of the veggies came from our garden. I will definately make this over and over again.

I didn't measure anything except the oil and vinegar... next time I'll use less basil and more tomatoes.  Good and fresh and healthy... my only complaint is the serious garlic breath you're bound to get from the raw minced garlic. :)

Excellent flavors!!!I didn't have balsamic vinegar, so I used Paul Newmans Balsamic Italian dressing. It was delish with fresh veggies from  my garden. I did serve the bread on the side, toasted, as others stated. People ate it that way, if they wanted to toss all together they could.

This really was good!  Rachael Ray did something like this on her show and at first it didn't sound appealling to me, but I followed the advice of other reviewers and toasted my bread in the oven first to get it crisp.  Also rubbed the bread with garlic (since I wasn't using a wooden salad bowl) and even though it softened up in the salad, it still had some chewy/crunchy texture.  I also added other fresh herbs - rosemary and oregano - since I have pots of them on my deck.  Will make this again - maybe try different "artisan" bread in it next time.

The only reason I am not rating it higher is because me and my family can not stand the taste of raw onions. I also added shredded meat slices for my meat loving hubby and threw in a bit of parmesan cheese. I would definintely make this again

I substituted baby spinach for much of the basil. We don't have a garden and I sure as heck wasn't paying the grocery store's price on fresh basil! My family LOVED it, even my 3 year old!

This was wonderful! I didn't add as much basil as it called for and it was still very tasty. I brushed the bread with olive oil and garlic and toasted it for about ten minutes. I also waited to add the bread until right before I served it so the bread wouldn't get mushy. It tastes like brushetta (sp?) in a bowl!

This is a tasty salad. I made a vinegrette with some dijon, added arugula and spinach, and omitted the onion. Served with a small side of pasta, it's perfect for a summer meal.

This is a great salad even for those of us who don't like tomatoes or onions. I doubled the tomatoes, cucumbers, olive oil, vinegar, garlic (even though its raw), added some lemon zest (Just got a micro-plain!), and a little lemon juice but didn't use all the onion called for. Also added some mozzarella. Even without these changes a very good salad, but gave it a 4 because to make it better I changed so much. I also toasted the bread cubes in the oven for 10 min or so at 400, corners just turned slightly golden. I let the basil, garlic, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, vinegar, lemon zest and juice, and olive oil sit for a while to meld then poured over bread after about 1ish hour. (To make it easier I put the basil, onion, garlic, and oil into a food processor)

I lightly toasted the bread in a saute pan with some olive oil and garlic and waited  and didn't mix the bread until about 10 minutes prior to serving. I also mix the vinaigrette with a little bit of mustard, to bind it together, This was not enough dressing so we doubled it. Didn't have thyme so I used Italian parsley. I served this at bbq  IT WAS AMAZING!! will definitely make again.

Loved this!  I used a variety of small tomatoes from my garden in this.  For the bread I used a challah.  Very refreshing salad!

I made this salad for my husband and he absolutely loved it. I changed the recipe slightly by adding 2 cups of raw spinach, and after I tossed the salad, I sprinkled some fresh Parmigiano Reggiano all over it. I think next time I will bake the bread in the oven for a few minutes so the bread doesn't absorb too much of the oil/vinegar mixture. Overall a fresh salad that is perfect for the summer.

Made this last night.  Followed to a T and after reading reviews added some feta cheese and toasted the bread in a pan a little. Will definately add to my rotation! Got nothing but compliments! Thanks Tamara!

5 stars for you Tamara and your bread salad.  It was scrumptous.  And I didn't even make it with the freshest of veg.  My Roma tomatoes were starting to shrivel, I had 1/2 of an English cucumber left over.  I tossed it all together exactly as instructed with the exception of the dressing.  I used the vinegarette left over from the beet salad with goat cheese from this site (balsamic, OJ and Olive Oil).  Next time I will make this as soon as I get home from the farm stand.  The thyme was a little surprise and the basil went so very well with it.  Thanks so so much.  Simple but grand!

Delicious!! We added fresh mozzarella cheese balls and didn't have the fresh thyme, but it was great. I'll definitely make this again and try some of the other users suggestions.

This was very good and flavorful. The rosemary in the bread makes all the difference. I love the texture of the bread as it mixes with the dressing and juice from the veggies--slightly chewy and very substantial. Next time, I'll add more veggies; the bread-to-veggie ratio as prepared was a bit heavy for my taste.

I did make a few changes.  I cut my bread into cubes and toasted it in the oven on 400 for about 10 minutes.  I eliminated the thyme because I didn't have it on hand.  I used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic and I finely grated in some fresh parmesan reggiano cheese.  It had a good flavor, but even with toasting the bread it was still really really soggy before even putting the dressing on.  It was pretty much a flop.

Made this for a family dinner and they loved it.  I left the bread out as they did not want me to use it and it was still great.  Next time I may add a little more balsamic vinegar to enhance the flavor.

I changed it up to make the salad a little heartier by adding a little romain, mozzerella cheese, garbanzo beans and dried salami.  It was really good, but I really didn't care for the bread in it.  I toasted the bread like some reccommended as my bread wasn't really stale and it just hurt my mouth. I ended up taking the bread out and really enjoyed the salad. Maybe next time, I will not toast the bread.
I loved the basil in the salad.  I didn't have the thyme it called for but it was still good.

The Italian Bread Salad I made for dinner tonight was very similar to this one.  I was able to get fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, and red & green peppers from my sister's garden so everything was very fresh.  I added capers and kalamata olives to the salad, too.  This was our dinner, so I added a few more pieces of bread to the bowl.  (Probably too many, in looking back in hindsight.)  Leftovers should be good tomorrow, even if the bread is a bit mushy.  I'm so glad I tried this recipe!

I bought some expensive bread that was already stale, so had to find a recipe for it.  I was missing several ingredients: cukes, red onion and fresh herbs - it was still delicious.  I added extra garlic and extra tomato and made my own Italian dressing with Good Seasonings dressing mix. I also added a can of black beans (rinsed and drained). I'd love to try this again when I have all the ingredients.

I absolutely LOVE this salad. I usally get tired of salads, but I make this several times a week for a side salad with supper or for my noon-time lunch! I've also added green olives and sliced avacado to the salad and it tastes SUPER!

This was good, but for some reason not popular at the potluck I attended. It was not my favorite, but still pretty good. This is one of those recipes you have to eat at one sitting. Otherwise it gets pretty soggy.

Unfortunately this was not a hit.  No one ate much of it and I had a ton left over.  I think there was too much fresh basil, and the bread was kind of dry.  The only change I made was an addition of fresh mozzerella cubed.  Maybe if I had added slice salami or pepperoni it would have made it into a "sub salad" and been more appealing to everyone.  I probably won't make this again, too much effort for the disappointing result.

I made this with a cooking group awhile back. I really like the bread/balsamic vinegar combination. I think I will skip the salad part next time and just dip my bread in the vinegar and herbs. Thanks for the great idea!

I changed this a little. I cut my bread into slices, brushed it was a little butter, rubbed it with garlic and grilled it. I also added gorganzola cheese which really made a difference. This was so yummy, we were scraping the bowl!

We liked this, however I will definetly toast the bread first and rub with a little garlic.  I don't care for soggy bread.  I added fresh mozzerella and celery.

Very pretty, tasty, and simple.  The only thing I changed was the amount of bread.  I used about half of the bread called for.  I made the vegetable part ahead of time and added the bread just before serving.  I will be making this again and again.

This turned out to be 5 stars using the tips from others: I used bakery rosemary bread, sliced it up and brushed on a thin layer of garlic EVOO, then toasted in oven until very crispy. I then cut it into cubes. Yes I used 2cups of chopped fresh basil -wow. Finally, I swapped out the balsamic for Red Wine Vinegar, and added a clove of fresh garlic, minced. I brought this to a potluck and got raves!!

So Good!  However it took me longer than 10 min to make. I did have to substitute French Baguette Bread as the store was out of French bread.  Still awesome flavors!

I used my own recipe. Bread (anytype that has a hard crust and it doesnt need to be a touch stale),  tomatoes, red onion, cucumbers(optional) , either red wine or cider vinegar, olive oil, salt & pepper to taste. Sometimes I will add cheese(any that you have on hand. Chill for about 20-60 minutes. Stir before serving. Its great anytime for a side dish or just by itself.

This is a recipe I make often but change it up too.  I am not one who likes to throw out food.  I suggest using day old or a hearty artisan bread for this recipe.  I also often use Olive Garden Italian dressing but this dressing is great too.

This is one of the BEST recipes I've made on All recipes and that's saying something because this is my go-to site! I had Tomato Bread Salad at a local, nationally recognized restaurant and loved it. So when I saw it on this site, I knew I had to try it. This recipe was better than at the restaurant! I did add mozzarella pieces to the recipe, toasted the bread in olive oil, and eliminated the onion. My husband raved about it as well. Do not hesitate--this one is a keeper!

I made this amazing salad for our lovely dinner. I used two different kinds of fresh ciabatta but had to toast it for a few minutes to make them drier. I added a bit of salt and black pepper on the ingredients and put minced garlic in the dressing, as others recommended. And also used dried thyme instead of fresh one which still tasted so good. It was really easy to make and simple. I'd love to try it again!

In all our years of using All Recipes, I think this is the first time I've reviewed a 1 star on something. Usually we can doctor up or eat the food, but this time NO WAY.  We had to toss it out. There is nothing in this recipe that we don't like but it was bad.  The only thing I can think of is it calls for balsamic vinegar & just maybe it was supposed to by balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  If that isn't it I don't know, but it is getting removed from my list.

I didn't measure anything, and this came out delicious. It's gotta be pretty much foolproof. This is a keeper for hot summer nights with a good glass of Chianti.

Spectacular salad! I incorporated suggestion of adding halved fresh mozzarella balls in marinade. Purchased 2 basil plants to save $ on serious amount of basil needed. Cut bread quantity in half. Even my kids loved this salad loaded with veggies!  Thanks to ALL who take the time to write reviews and share your secret ingredients or tips. Your recipes, suggestions, and pictures make this my go-to website for planning special dinners!

Super good and easy! Wonderful on a hot evening on the patio. I cut it in 1/2 for 2. Used home grown basil and Roma tomatoes. Toasted focaccia cubes and doubled the dressing. Also added small cubes of pepper jack cheese. Winner all around and I will make again!

Loved the salad!  Fresh herbs and heirloom tomatoes out of the garden paired with a 1/2 loaf of cubed garlic focaccia that was well dried.  Excellent!  
The only thing I did different from the recipe was to add some fresh garlic chives

If you grill the bread on the BBQ &  let the edges get nice & brown it is delicious! Adds another flavor & dimension.

Wow.... This salad rocked this labor day Monday.  Started off early this morning.  Did the tomatoes, the cucumbers, then red onions.  Soaked that in the Olive oil and balsamic.  Then ran to Shop Rite and got the fresh Basil and Thyme.  The Fresh Basil is the key.  I actually did a double amount of the entire recipe, and with 10 folks, it was gone.  Everybody loved it.  I sorta cheated and used gourmet croutons... but that worked just fine as they were extra large.  Gave it some crunch.  I would recommend this recipe again.  In fact, two people asked if they could have it.  Alas I didn't take a picture... but an empty bowl pretty much says it all.

This was pretty good.  I am not a big fan of soggy bread to make sure that Italian bread is stale before you rip it up and throw it into the salad.  I would recommend doing that just before you serve it and the dressing goes on it.

I have made this several times but I use lettus with just a bit of the basil.   For me the basil would be too much so I add it to lettus and we eat this several times during the summer.

Wow this was amazing!  So different and so simple!  To avoid sogginess I made sure my bread was all the way dried out (like crutons) and kept all the prepared ingredients separate until the moment we sat down to the table.  Just dumped them all together at the last moment, tossed and served.  The only change I made was to omit the cucumber and add some chopped fresh mushrooms, flaked tuna, salt and fresh cracked pepper.  My favorite part was the whole leaves of basil.  The flavors went beautifully and I will make this often!

Very good! I did not put the bread into the salad but placed it next to it to use to dip/scoop the salad with. I also used leftover "garlic bubble ring" and toasted small pieces in the oven at 200 degrees to use for the salad.

Apart from omitting the thyme, I made this as written, and thought it was pretty good. My bread wasn't particularly soggy either. If I were to make it again, I would definitely throw in some mixed lettuce leaves; some pine nuts would be nice too. Thanks!

I am giving this a 4 because I changed it.  I didn't like the idea of soggy bread, so  toasted it first then drizzled it with EVOO and rubbed it with a garlic clove.  I didn't have enough basil so I added spinach, I didn't use onion.  We topped the mix on our plates with the bread and added the vinegaar and oil dressing.  All in all a good salad that we will have again.

Well, here's the scoop. Hubby gave this a one, Ash gave it a two and her boyfriend gave it a 3.5. Even though I placed the bread in the oven to get it very crispy and did not add it to the salad until the very last moment, the bread got soggy and that just sent my gang over the edge. According to them, without the bread it would have been a four. I for one, don't mind soggy bread in a nice garlicy oil, but I had to go with the majority on this one.
