I have been making this for a while and this is the best chicken (tortilla soup) recipe I have found. I have made adjustments and added 1 can black beans (rinsed) and 2 TBSP dry ranch dressing mix and 1 can Rotel. AMAZING.

What a great slow cooker soup!  My husband had three bowls of this.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, and made some additions to "veg it up".  I added a small zucchini and summer squash, halved and thinly sliced, and a can of rinsed black beans.  I used Rotel & just a little more chicken broth.  Doubled the cumin (LOVE the stuff) and added some Penzey's Bold Taco seasoning to the mix.  This was great!  Plenty of left-overs went in the freezer.  Sincere thanks for sharing your recipe, a keeper.

I love soup and this is so easy, and ready when I get off work. I don't like corn so substituted a can of black beans, rinsed and drained. Excellent!

I made small changes only for my tastes, not because the recipe needed to be changed. I used all organic canned products when I could, I added one can organic drained/rinsed black beans, and one can organic diced tomatoes. I like more garlic so I threw more in. I did not add the extra salt. This was good, but I think it needs a little somethin'-somethin'. A little lime juice? Cilantro? I can't put my finger on it. As it is, nice and easy adaptable soup to throw in what you like that saves both on the food and energy budgets. NOTE: This made enough for 6 smallish Tupperware containers for dinner at work this week.

This is so easy and so adaptable.  You can add any vegetables that you like or even pinto beans or rice.  A great one pot meal for families on the go.

FABULOUS!  My husband doesn't like spicy food and was hesitant to try it - but he loved it - and not too spicy at all!  My chicken tenderloins weren't defrosted in the morning yet, so I cooked all day - about 9-1/2 hrs - and chicken fell apart.  Other than that - followed recipe to the letter.  Served with shredded cheese, little sour cream and sprinkled corn chips over top.  Looking forward to finishing up the leftover today for lunch.  Will be a regular!

I liked the sound of this soup, but I didn't have time to make it in my crockpot.  Instead, I cubed the chicken breasts and put them in my pot with the chicken broth (plus 1 can of water), diced tomatoes, and enchilada sauce to simmer.  I omitted the green chiles because my husband doesn't like them.  I subbed some taco seasoning mix for the cumin, chili powder, salt, and black pepper.   I left the cilantro and corn out because I didn't have them on hand.  For toppings , we added shredded sharp ched. cheese and lowfat sour cream to our soup.  Even my husband who doesn't like any spicy foods loved this soup!  Way to go, AmberNPetty!

Awesome! My kids loved it and they are hard to please this days. I added the can of Rotel, black beans and chick peas. I also added the spicy ranch spice packet (3 teaspoons). These were all recommendations by other people on the site. Will make again!

AS IS, this recipe is very soup-like & spicy/HOT. It's a basic taco/tortilla-type soup recipe. My new fav. with a couple changes: DO NOT ADD PEPPER, especially if you're expecting kids to eat it. It had quite the kick without it! Definitely ADD BLACK BEANS. This soup seems to be missing something without it. I thoroughly enjoyed the CORN texture and will add TWO CANS next time which will help add the needed density to the soup. For FASTER COOKING: I put the chicken in the microwave for a few minutes until more whitened. I also sauteed the onion in butter in a frying pan until slightly browned and I COOKED this soup ON HIGH. I actually wasn't able to get to it, until 7 hours later. The chicken chunks fell apart nicely with poking it with a spatula. Surprisingly, the corn wasn't at all soggy. Oddly, the flavored changed to be more yummy after I broke up the chicken and it cooled a bit. Will make with CORN BREAD next time.

Here are a few tips to decrease (or increase) the heat. First the type of diced tomatoes make a HUGE difference. Rotel original w/diced green chiles is (IMO)kick your butt hot. So try Rotel diced tomatoes w/ lime and cilantro, instead to reduce heat but still keep a little. It has very little cilantro taste so you may want much more fresh cilantro added just before serving.Rotel MILD tomatoes are mild and BLAND. To give  more flavor but controll heat you could add some salsa...just pick your heat level. Bottom line, Taste The TOMATOES BEFORE ADDING  to crock pot. After awhile you will know which tomato brand you like.

I made this for our annual soup supper/buffet! It was really good. We received several compliments from those that tried it. It's got a nice little kick to it, but nothing too strong. I accidentally bought creamed corn, but it worked just fine. Thanks AMBERNPETTY!

Very tasty and, like all slow cooker recipes, very easy, too.  Only made a few minor changes due to what I had on hand.  Omitted the diced green chilies, cilantro, and was out of onion, so I used about 1 T of dried onions instead.  I also threw in a small can of sliced olives at the end (drained).  Yum!

This was an instant hit! I tweeked it a bit for my tastes. I used a can of rotel, a can of pinto beans, a can of black beans, the can of corn, chicken broth, & enchilada sauce. I also put the onion, minced garlic, cumin, & chilli powder. I omitted the cilantro & bay leaves because I don't care for the taste. I added an enchilada seasoning packet & some lime juice. I slow-cooked it for about 8 hours, & served it with tortilla chips, avocado, cheese & sour cream. My family devoured it!

This is an easy excellent tasting soup.  I mostly followed the recipe except I used an extra can of diced tomatoes with green chilies because I didn't have a can of green chilies.  Also, I added paprika and extra cumin but left out the chili powder.  The flavor was fantastic.  It would be great served with cornbread.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Delicious soup, easy and fuss free. I increased the amount of broth and adjusted the type of ingredients to lower the sodium, such as home canned tomatoes and broth, and frozen corn, although that's just personal preference. Thanks for the recipe, it was a hit with the whole family. Served with cornbread on the side and the suggested toppings of green onions and cheese, plus a little sour cream.

I really enjoyed this soup; light, yet filling (great if you are trying to shed a couple of pounds), and has a good spicy kick. I also liked the ease; just throw it in the slow cooker and let it go. I will definitely be making this again.

Really delicious. The recipe is so simple that you can add anything to it. For a little more spice, we add Jalapenos and some Cheyenne pepper. 

***However! If heat is something you can't handle, dial back on the chili powder and make sure that the canned ingredients you are adding are the /lowest/ heat you can get.

Great!  I think I'll add more green chilis next time, we like it spicy!  I also added a can of black beans this time.  Thinking maybe I'll add a can of condensed cheddar cheese soup too b/c we love cheese too!  Also, as my husband pointed out, this could be good with beef or pork too!

Soooo Good!  We're not tomato chunk fans, so I substituted a can of tomato paste and put in the corn with all liquid.  Also used black beans, like other reviewers.  Definitely a keeper!

This will be a new staple for us.  I did add black beans for more protein.  I had a package with 2 chicken breasts which worked fine - not sure what the weight was.  Thanks!

I made it exactly how the recipe instructed and it was a huge hit. I added tortilla chips to my bowl then poured the soup atop them.  I really enjoyed making and eating this dish. I will be making it again. I will add less chili powder and cumin next time but overall its a nice dish.

Great recipe!  I made it on the stovetop rather than a slow cooker.  Therefore, I was able to saute the onions and garlic in olive oil in order to enhance the flavor.  I also made this with stew beef and it was great.  I did thicken by adding some cornstarch mixed with cold water in the last twenty minutes of cooking.  Served with grated Pepperjack cheese.  Big hit with the entire family.

This is a terrific soup.  I changed it a bit by adding tomato sauce instead of chopped tomatoes as I do not like tomato chunks in soup.  I also replaced the corn with hominy.  If you like spicy soup, this one is for you!  If you're not into spicy, take down the heat by using less chili powder.  I'll definitely be making this one again!

We thought this was really good.  The only thing I added was 2 tablespoons of Ranch dressing mix (as others suggested).  I liked it by itself and with sour cream and cheese on top.

This was super good! I had been looking for a good, healthy chicken tortilla soup, and this was perfect. The only changes I made were I added, pinto beans, carrots, black beans, a jalapeno, I used veg stock instead of chicken.

This soup will go into my winter soup rotation. I used three fresh chilis diced and next time will add a 4th. I also used about a half a can more chicken broth because I had 1.5 pounds of chicken. I threw in a few frozen green beans that I needed to use up and next time will add more and/or will add pinto or black beans as other suggested. I served with a bit of shredded cheese, however, this soup really doesn't need anything extra! Great recipe!

Great base recipe!  Based on other reviews, I added Rotel tomatoes in addition to the diced tomatoes (too spicy for kids), leftover rice, black olives and some canned beans.  Topped with colby cheese and tortilla strips.  Delicious and hearty!

This is a great recipe and not just for the slow cooker. I mad one batch on the stove top too. Since I am not a fan of the red enchilada sauce I substituted a 15 oz can of Hatch medium green enchilada sauce. I also took the recommendation of others and added a can of rinsed black beans and an extra can of broth and a little more cumin and chili powder. One batch I made with two cans of chicken on the stove and the other with leftover meat I pulled off a rotisserie chicken in the slow cooker.

Super easy and doesn't require slow cooker. Didn't add tomatoes. Added a can of rinsed black beans. Sauteed onions and garlic first since I didn't use slow cooker. Husband liked the "bite".

The whole family loved it! Next time I'm going to double the recipe just so we can have left overs. The only adjustment I made is I didn't put as much chili powder but I wish I did..I only put half of the amount required but  it was not spicy at all even with the can of jalapenos I put in. Will definitely make again!!

This was very nice BUT - use fresh veg (easy to get hold of) and homemade broth/sauce (easy to make). 
So much tastier and much healthier.

If you are lazy, why not just get a can or two of Chicken Enchilada Soup and stick it in the slow cooker to heat up?

I've been making this since this time in 2015-- 2 years. I love it. It's better with organic ingredients. You can add Spanish rice, or quinoa to make it more filling. Im also trying to incorporate beans into my diet this year, so I bought 1 can of kidney beans, rinsed them, and added a few spoonfuls to my containers before putting them in the fridge for the week. I also add a bit of Turmeric spice seasoning.

Delicious! Next time I will use a little less chili powder and I used green enchilada sauce.

This is an excellent soup, just as listed...I made no changes.  Big hit at work.  I simply provide tortilla strips, goat cheese, avocado, and cilantro for garnish!

An easy week night recipe!  Crockpot meals can get "mediocre" after a while, but I always enjoy this soup. A great recipe to keep in the rotation!

This soup was so good. I followed the recipe, only substituting low and no salt versions of the broth, corn and tomatoes. It was a hit with the whole family. I will definitely be making this again.

I just made this today and it was absolutely delicious! I ended up using chicken thighs and I added 2 stalks of chopped celery because I had a lot on hand. Those were the only changes I made to the recipe. It's spicy, but topping it with shredded cheese and sour cream when serving it seemed to mellow out the heat. You could always skip the chili powder & green chiles if you want to make a milder version. I'll definitely be making this one again soon.

Made this today with a few minor changes. I also added a can of rinsed black beans, no corn due to allergies, the juice of one lime, extra cilantro and chili powder.  I served it with shredded pepper jack, sour cream, and extra lime juice.  I pan fried slices of cooked polenta in a little butter and olive oil until they were golden brown and served them on top of the soup for those who can eat corn. Amazing!!

What a great slow cooker recipe. It was a tad too spicy for my guy, (he likes his food very mild, it was perfect for me as written) so I will use half the green chilies for him.  Awesome topped with sour cream and shredded cheese.  Thank you so much for this great recipe!!!

So good. I would only change one or two things next time I make it.
1-maybe add more chicken like 1/2 pound more.
2- add cilantro at the end, it didn't add much flavour after slowcooking for 7 hours.

Easy, fast and delicious flavor. I love spicy food but used the mild enchilada sauce because they sometimes have too much chili powder for me. The recipe was plenty spicy and flavorful. I will make again for sure.

I used one raw chicken breast and one cooked leftover breast, and the result was still perfect! Very flavorful and filling.

My daughter and I have made this a few times over the past year.  My hubby had it for the first time in January.  He is not much of a soup person, but he went back for 2nds!  The only thing for the last time is I left it in the slow cooker a little longer and the liquid reduced a bit more than intended so I had more of a stew than a soup. But it was still fabulous!

I made this dish "as is" except I left off the salt and added extra cilantro. (I love that stuff!) Yummy! The hubby and the kiddos (ages 7 and 5) liked it too. I served it with sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese and some of those little Southwest (Santa Fe) Style tortilla strips that you find in the crouton isle. It's a keeper!

I really enjoyed how easy this recipe was. I used a can of pinto beans instead of the corn (I just don't think 'corn' when I think enchilada). I also added a small can of sliced black olives. I topped each bowl with some shredded cheese, crushed tortilla chips and a dollop of sour cream. I might leave the corn in next time.

I made this tonight using a can of rotel and no chili powder. It came out great. I served it on top of corn bread and garnished with sour cream, cheese and green onions. Even my three year old ate it.

This turned out really good!  I made rice on the side for family members who didn't want "soup" for dinner.  They just poured the soup over their rice and enjoyed it that way.  I will be making this again for sure.

Loved it but I must admit to using what I had I hand- thighs, corn, canned diced tomatoes, enchilada sauce, onion, garlic, chili powder, and 2t Penzey's fajita powder; skipped the green chilis, broth, cilantro, bay leaves and cumin. I wonder about even adding the broth the next time as the consistency was really good. We really enjoyed it.

I've been making some sort of Chicken Taco Soup in the crock pot for years.  This one has been declared the BEST by my husband.  Of course I loved it too. I did every short cut I could think of too.  I used previously cooked and frozen leftover chicken that I added at the last hour.  Used Green Ench sauce (and a bit of green salsa- loved this!).  I used frozen diced onions and green peppers and minced garlic.  Left out the cilantro b/c I didn't have it.  Light on the chili powder for the kids, and a bit of taco seasoning added.  Added black beans.  I served it with typical toppings, but I also added chopped avocado and that was AWESOME.  It took me like 10 minutes to dump it all together and that's my favorite part!

WOW!! I loved this soup!! I added a chopped jalepeno to it and it was just the perfect amount of heat. The next time I cook this I'm thinking of pouring it onto some cornbread to see how that goes!

DELICIOUS!!! My chicken breasts fell apart! My husband made some white rice and placed this over the top and he thought it was even better. I'm not a rice fan so I didn't try it. Will definately be making this more often!

This is a great recipe; however, i've never made it in the crockpot.  Instead of using corn, I use hominy, and wow -  what a flavor difference!  You can also use the Rotele green chili/tomato sauce vs. diced chilies & enchilada sauce.

I didn't have any enchilada sauce so I used 1 can pato jalepeno salsa, I also didn't have onion or cilantro so I left those out. I used 3 frozen chicken breast and only 1 bay leaf but added some southwest blend spice seasoning, some carrots and black beans rinsed and drained.  My husband and I loved it! It rivals our favorite chicken tortilla soup from a restaurant we frequent.  This will be a staple.

Had this for dinner tonight and must say it was fantastic! I modified as others by adding a can of black beans (rinsed and drained), can of Rotel with juices, and 3 tsp of fiesta ranch dry seasoning. I didn't use as much cilantro (not a big fan). Cooked on high for a few hours then low after separating the chicken. Also served the extra chicken in quesadillas! Excellent dipped in the soup! Definitely earned its 5 stars :)

Easiest, best tortilla soup.  I've been looking for a long time for the recipe that duplicated what I fell in love with when I first visited Mexico. This one duplicates the taste I remember & love the most. Personally, I puree the rotel before I put it in the crocpot.  I am not a fan of chunky tomatoes or peppers. :)

This recipe is fabulous and has a ton of flavor...I followed the recipe all most exact...I did use frozen corn, and I used one can each of green and red enchilada sauce.  I served it with sour cream, taco chips and parm cheese...it as soooo good!!! Will make this for years to come.

It was excellent, restaurant quality. I always like to make it per the original recipe, but had to change a couple of things due to someone not liking something or because I didn't have an item. I did not add corn nor cilantro, but added 1 can of small red beans in the beginning, then when I took the chicken out to shred I added another can but smashed them beforehand to slightly thicken the soup. I didn't have a regular size can of tomatoes so added a can of Rotel tomatoes w/green chilis. It was a little more spicy but we loved it.

I tried this recipe out today. I LOVED it! It had wonderful flavor to it and was extremely easy.  I used green chili enchilada sauce because I didn't pay close attention when I grabbed a can but it was still fantastic even with my mistake. I plan on making this time and time again :)

Mmmmmm, so yummy! We like our stuff with a kick and used Rotel diced tomatoes, which spiced it up just enough. This was a big hit in our house!

This soup was to die for!  Like others, I added 1 can rinsed black beans, 1 can Rotel (instead of green chilies alone), and juice from 1/2 a lime.  I also used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  I put the chicken in still frozen, and by the time I was home from work it was perfect.  After shredding I had to leave lid off crock pot so some of the juices would evaporate...served with tortilla chips, shredded cheese, and a bit of sour cream - YUM!  Everyone is already asking when we can make it next!

I had high expectations for this one based on the reviews and this recipe was just okay for me.  I would have liked it to be a little thicker and have a more flavor.

Wow. Loved this.  I left out the corn and cilantro, didn't have any, but added a can of rinsed black beans.  I also doubled the diced green chiles.  The chicken was put in the slow cooker still frozen.  Worked great!  I needed to add more chicken broth when heating up leftovers but that's fine.  Used the suggestion of tortilla chips for a topping and loved that.  Thanks for adding another fantastic soup to my arsenal!

Wow. Just WOW!  Made this for dinner the other night, and it came out awsome. I tasted the broth when it had another hour left, and it was a but too spicey, so I had to add another can of chicken broth. I may just take it easy on the chili powder next time.  Also, I added black beans, because they are awsome.

This soup got rave reviews at my house. I added serrano pepper to make it extra spicy, but it was still very flavorful as is. I was only able to get half of a bowl before it was gone.

Decent as is, but felt like it needed more to it, so I got black beans after the first time making it. Most recently added red pepper too, I think about a teaspoon of powder, to make it a little bit spicy (used medium enchilada sauce and chiles). I thawed 4 frozen chicken breasts when I made it.

I was skeptical due to all the cans but it is super tasty! I substituted garbanzo beans for corn (healthier) and increased garlic and chili. There is no need for extra salt due to that in canned products despite using salt-free tomatoes. Also I used thighs instead of breasts for more flavor.

This was delicious ! I took some of the reviewers suggestions - added sliced zucchini, a can of black beans and salsa verde instead of green chili’s. I also used boned chicken breasts and took the meat off after cooking, since boneless chicken tends to cook too fast in my slow cooker.

Amazing! Super easy. Easily doubles if you have a large crockpot. I add black beans, go heavy on the spices, and add oregano since I dislike cilantro. May need to add more broth if you make plenty for leftovers. Favorite of everyone.

Big hit, I added about 1/2 cup more of chicken broth and 2 TBSP of dry ranch mix. For toppings I use cheddar cheese, sour cream, a bit of lime and crushed tortilla chips for an added layer of texture and salt.

Super easy. I used rotisserie chicken - nearly the whole chicken. Added Rotel w/lime juice & cilantro, as well as black beans. Used 32 ounces of broth instead of 15, then felt free to add more corn, chicken, etc.   This resulted in about 8 good-sized servings.  Added shredded cheese, sour cream and broken tortilla chips - delicious!

This soup was super easy to make and tasty. The chicken was moist and simply fell apart. We added black beans and extra green chili peppers. We also used a can of  Rotel as others mentioned.

Easy Soup to make. I doubled the recipe (except for the onion) based on another review of it making 6 small servings since I needed to feed 4 teens and my husband. It made plenty. I did use chicken thighs that I diced before cooking instead of chicken breasts. I also used southwest corn since that is what I had on hand. The flavor of the soup will vary based on your enchilada sauce so use a good sauce. Hatch is my favorite. I topped with cheese, tortilla strips, homemade pico de gallo and sour cream. My boys loved it.

This is excellent. I doubled the garlic just because we love it and added black beans to add some more heartiness. We doubled the recipe and canned the leftovers. I did cook my frozen chicken in a pressure cooker separately just to save some time. Delicious!

This was very good and healthy.  I only added a can of black beans and an extra tablespoon of taco seasoning.  This is a crockpot keeper!  Added a little feta and avocado on top before serving..

This was a very simple and delicious meal. Made it as posted, but was sure to use MILD enchilada sauce, because I knew regular would have been too spicy for me.  I opted to make a side of rice and ladled the soup over the rice - it was perfect for us. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this just as the recipe said except I added a zucchini.  It would have been 5 stars without the zucchini, too, but.. the more vegetables, the better.  It pretty much blended in. I served with cheddar cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips. My husband loved it.

This is really good! I’ve also substituted and made it with beef broth and hamburger meat, just put the hamburger in towards the end.  I like fresh kidney or black beans as well.

I thought this was delicious. It had just the right amount of spice. The only variation I had to make was using garlic powder instead of garlic cloves, because I thought I had some cloves, but I was out. I served this topped with sour cream, cheese, and crushed corn chips! Amazing! It also freezes really well.

I will make it again!  It had good flavor and seems low calorie and healthful.  Next time I will either put tortilla strips on top or serve with a side of tortilla chips or maybe even chips and cheese.  My husband likes it with a regular tortilla, but I thought a little crunch would be good.  

I added the corn, green chili and onion about an hour before serving.   I was missing those ingredients when I turned the crock pot on.  I think the onion was a better consistency than if it cooked for 6 hours.

This soup is so easy and flavorful.  I made it for a group of 8 adults served with a variety of meats and cheeses, bread, and crackers.   It smelled yummy and everyone loved it.  Like other's on this site suggested, I added a can of Rotel.  I left out the green chiles for those who didn't like hot & spicy.  The soup had a nice kick but not too much heat.  I served with shredded cheese, sour cream, and diced green onions.

I didn't make any changes as it was my first time making it. Easy to make, very filling. I might add fewer green chili's next time because it was a little too spicy for me but fine for my husband.

This was really good and easy to make.  I used a can of tomatoes with green chilies included and omitted the red chili powder.  Next time will substitute black beans for the corn as suggested by a reviewer.

Absolutely delicious. Rather than using a slow cooker I just did it on top of the stove. I used cooked chicken breast,  & added a little more chicken stock.  Next time I will add a can of black beans as suggested by a few.  When serving I added scallions & shreeded Mexican cheese.

This was great and very easy to put together. I didn't have the green chiles and only had thighs. Still excellent! It had a nice bite that goes perfect with cheese and sour cream.

We loved it.
I left out the cilantro because of family preferences.
I doubled the recipe in every ingredient except the spices.
I thought it was delicious and the spices were just right.
My husband said it was a little too spicy for him, so I told him to add the sour cream, taco chips and cheese! YUM!

First things first..... I am not very much of a fan of soup.  But this was probably the best soup that I have ever tasted.  It was better and more flavorful than what I had in Cancun.  There were a few changes made due to ingredients being available and not available.  Equal part cayenne pepper was sub for the chili powder plus green bell pepper and a can of drained black beans added.  This will definitely be made again soon.

I have been making this recipe for over 5 years now, and it is a huge family favorite!  I add a can of black beans, drained, and use fresh chopped jalapeños instead of canned, and add 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper to up the heat.  Top it with southwest style tortilla strips, diced avocado, diced tomato, sour cream, and a squeeze of lime juice, and it gets rave reviews from absolutely everyone!  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Although this was a hearty soup, it was difficult to eat because of the shredded chicken.  I felt sloppy!  If I were to make it again, I'd cut up the chicken before putting it in the crockpot.  The flavor was okay, but I like a bit more zip to my food.  It's worth a try to see how you like it.

I loved this recipe.  I only used 3/4 lb of chicken and added a can of pinto beans for a little more hardiness.  It was delicious and will definitely make it again.

Fantastic flavors, easy recipe.  I made a few changes to the recipe.  I added an additional can of diced tomatoes, added 2 (14.5oz) cans of sliced carrots (or fresh), I only used 1/2 of the green chili to keep the heat mild/medium.  I would add an additional can of chicken stock or 2 cups of water.  I also used a 19oz can of Enchilada sauce and added 8oz of small sea shell noodles (put these in about 30 minutes before serving).  I didn't add sliced celery but will probably try that the next time.

This recipe was very good and uber easy!  I did add extra Cummin and a little extra chili powder just for my preference and my diced totmatoes also came with green chilis as well.  I also added a can of black beans as other reviewers did and the whole kernels of corn were fire roasted for a little extra flavor.  I served it with tortilla chips, sour cream and jalapeños from a jar as options.  Will definitely add this as a regular meal!!

This was a winner. My husband can't eat food that's is too spicy. I left out the green chiles. I did add black beans as suggested. Next time I may add fire roasted tomatoes. This soup did  have a bit of a kick, and was very flavorful. I used a mild enchilada sauce.  I served with tortilla strips.

This soup was delicious but there wasn't enough broth for me.  I added an extra can of chicken broth but still didn't seem like soup. Next time I'm adding more broth and more tomatoes.

I made this exactly as  written with the exception of the cilantro, which I didn't have on hand and don't care for in soups anyway.  Both my husband and I thought it was just okay.  Not as much flavor depth as I had hoped.  If I were to do it again I would reduce the amount of broth and increase the enchilada sauce.  Seasonings are about right.

We truly enjoyed this slow cooker soup!  I always folllow the exact directions the first time around .  I think that the low cooking makes a difference in how tender the chicken is.  The flavor was full bodied and spicy--could be to much for some folks.  I served this with garlic bread and a side salad.  Will keep as a winter go to recipe

This is great as is. Only thing I change is instead of a can of corn I use a cup of Trader Joe’s frozen roasted corn. Gives it a great flavor. So easy to make, a winter staple for sure.

If you don't want to use a crockpot, you can do this in big pot on stovetop also. It is basically a stew using chicken.

Excellent and made it AS-IS and rating it AS-IS.    Dec. 2017 Made it again and I did not have chicken, but I had a package of ground turkey in the freezer I needed to use up. Also good. Original review from Jan. 2017.

Followed Motomom's variant by adding black beans and ranch but not rotel; my family is not fond of heat.  All3 women thought it was still too spicy, though everyone really liked the flavor.  Next time will only add half the mild chiles to meet in the middle.  Will definitely have it again.

Very good - ideal for a cold winter's night.  As many reviewers suggested, I added a can of drained black beans and a can of rotel.  I accidentally added a bit to much chipotle chili - some vinegar helped with the heat.  We will have this again!

I added 2 tbsp of corn meal about 30 min before it was done to thicken it up a bit.  I used low-sodium corn, chicken broth and tomatoes and thought it was still a bit salty, will only use 1/2 tsp salt next time.  Super easy, my kids loved this.

I doubled the recipe and added a can of black beans and a can of pinto beans.  I also used one 14.5 oz can of fire roasted salsa-style diced tomatoes along with a 14.5 oz can of regular diced tomatoes.  I increased the enchilada sauce to a 28 oz can.  It was out of this world!

I like chunky soups so the first time I added a can of black beans and a can of garbanzo beans.  The second time I added 2 cans of black beans.  It was better with garbanzo beans.  Terrific recipe.

Delicious. I cooked it with dried cilantro and put fresh cilantro when I served it. I also used 1/2 tsp of Chipolte Chili Powder, and 1/2 tsp of regular chili powder. I also used fresh green chiles instead of canned.

Let me start by saying that I am probably the world's worst cook & I was able to make this. (Probably cause you just throw everything in the crockpot and let it do the work haha)
Super easy. I didn't have corn so I left that out. I plan on adding it next time. I also didn't have chili powder so I substituted with cayenne powder. One word- SPICY! Accidentally cut up two Serrano peppers and I think the recipe says one. Last, I don't care for onions so I left that out. 
This was delicious!! 
I used thin sliced chicken breasts and set the crockpot to 6 hours on HIGH. It was done in about 4 hours. So good!!

After reading other's suggestions, I increased the broth to 2 cans, added 1 can of black beans & 1 can of Ro-Tel.  I also added 1 can of hominy, and 1/4 of lime juice.  It was fantastic!  An instant family favorite!

Really delicious! I wanted to keep eating and eating it! Didn't have an onion so I just used onion powder. Added avocado and tortilla chips as toppings.

Came out perfect. The flavoring is spot on and not too powerful. The green chilies add the right amount of pop to the recipe. We sliced up avocado and cheese and topped it off with tortilla chips. Spent $24 in ingredients which came to $4 per meal per person. Wow!! ??

Excellent! Loved the way the chicken cooked in the crock pot. Easy to put together and delicious! I made a couple of changes...used fresh Hatch green chiles and didn't add salt. Nice hearty soup! It's a keeper!

It's very good soup. I add some veggies to make it a little healthier. I add carrots and zucchini and also a can of pinto beans. I also top it with avocado. I enjoy it.

Simple to make but can't give it five stars as I made a few changes.  I know the pepper would be too much so just added a dash and let everyone season to taste.  Also, I used "mild" sauce and added a can of pink beans.  I think the rating would have been a "3" if I followed the recipe exactly.

It was very tasty. I did add some chopped corn, red and green bell pepper just to add some veg hardiness.  I used a mild green enchilada sauce which gives it a nice spice but little ones can handle it. I put sour cream and spicy enchilada sauce out for anyone who wants to dollop into their own bowl.

Used 2 cans of Rotel, 1-1/2 lb. chicken, 4 cups broth. Still fit in a 3 qt. slow cooker. Sprinkled shredded cheese on each serving.

Family visited and it disappeared quickly. They can't believe grandpa is actually cooking; and it is good.

(edit): I now use Great Value Chili Ready Tomatoes(Walmart) instead of Rotel. One can will do it.

No bay leaf, and  left out the chile peppers.   I used this recipe to creatively find a use for leftover turkey.  Overall, better than the "sopa tortilla" at the local Mexican restaurant.

Winner! My husband said it was the best soup he's ever had!  I made a few small changes: simmered in a pot on the stove instead of using the crockpot (reduced time of course), doubled the chicken broth, used cut up celery leaves instead of cilantro, and added a can of brown beans.

Great recipe!

This was fabulous!  I made it on the stove instead of the crock pot.  I did not have a can of enchilada sauce so I made the "ten minute enchilada sauce" recipe from this site (just added the ingredients to the soup pot). Also, used frozen corn instead of  canned and added a can of drained black beans that I had in the frig (to use them up).  Soooo yummy! My daughter and her friends were over and all gave it 5 stars, as well as hubby!  Will def make again!

This was fun to make. Made the house smell great. Following this recipe was easy and not expensive. My family likes to have a starch included when eating soup. I steamed rice, and poured this soup over. Was very satisfying.

I made this soup tonight for the first time and it was GREAT!! Everyone in my house loved it and I will be making it again. I added Black Beans and Rotel instead of (a can of Tomatoes and a can of Green Chilies) and I did not use Bay Leaves. I doubled my recipe to feed my big family but I only added one can of the Enchilada Sauce. It was not spicy like others have said it was and trust me I would be the one to tell you if it was spicy I am very sensitive to spicy food. If you are looking for something different, easy, and very good TRY THIS!! LOVE IT!!

Delicious!!!
I  followed the recipe but used canned Tomatoes w/chillies since I didn't have chilles  & I added canned pinto beans. After shredding the chicken sprinkled it w/taco seasoning for more flavor it was delicious. Served w/lime Tortilla chips & a dollop of sour cream. 
This recipe is a keeper!!!

I usually use the full three pound bag of frozen chicken beasts.  Then I pull out about 1/2 the chicken and make up quesadillas. This works better for my teenagers who aren't full enough on this low fat soup alone. I also add more chicken broth and spices to make more soup. If it isn't spicy or flavorful enough at the end, you can throw in some salsa to get the flavor right. This is a very flexible, healthy recipe. We love it as an alternative to chili on cold evenings.

This is my family's favorite soup. I have kids that have a thing against chunks of tomatoes, so I add tomato sauce instead. Also, I add the rice from a Spanish rice box. Add the rice with about 2.5 hours left to get it the right tenderness.

This was by far one of the best soups I've ever had. None was left. Even my best friend loved it, and she is the pickiest eater I know! I added a jalapeño pepper to the soup and homemade taco seasoning. I will be making this again!

I have made this so many times and it is one of our favorites!  I make exactly as is only I always double or triple the recipe if we have leftovers or for a party.  I have made for several fundraiser "soup" suppers and it is ALWAYS one of the first crockpots to be gone!  I have omitted corn before only because I didn't have on hand and sometimes throw in more cilantro just because we love it but you don't have to change a thing and it is delicious!!!

This is good but I was hoping for a thicker more enchilada tasting soup.  Maybe more enchilada sauce?  Regardless this has nice flavor.  I added a little bit of cheese on top :)

I love this recipe and have made it several times. My favorite variations include replacing the corn with 1 cup of diced red bell pepper; adding in a can of 98% fat-free cream of chicken; and replacing the chicken breast with chicken thighs. Yum!

Really good and really easy. This would be too spicy for my elderly parents, but I know that just from reading the recipe. I added black beans and used chicken bouillon instead of broth because that's what I had on hand. We also added corn chips and grated cheese when serving. My family loved it!

I made this on the stove top. Started with sautéed onions and orange peppers. I used a can of Rotel instead of separate tomatoes and chilis. Used 2 cans of broth, an extra can each of diced tomatoes and crushed tomatoes. I added rotisserie chicken and sautéed zucchini towards the end. Also added extra spices to make if for the extra liquids. It turned out great!

Tastefully Wonderful!  I made it for my mom for Mother's Day and she loved it.  Like some others I used Rotel. Also I served the soup over tortilla chips.  An easy recipe that will be made again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

I make this soup once a month and take it to work every day for a week! Its high in protein with all the chicken, and its my favorite soup! I usually add extra cilantro, half the amount of cumin (not my favorite flavor), and then avocado slices to the bowls themselves. Cheese and tortilla chips definitely add even more to the soup but can be left off without losing much if you're trying to be health conscious. LOVE IT!

This was really tasty.  I followed the ingredients exactly and the only thing I changed was cooking (time crunch) which meant I cooked on high for 3 hours and then switched to low for another hour or so after that.  It tasted even better the day after, and for two people this was dinner for 4 days!  Thanks for sharing!

very tasty and super easy to make. followed the recipe almost exactly and it turned out wonderful. i'm not a huge fan of canned corn so i used about 2 cups frozen and it worked out great. i also had no fresh cilantro on hand so it was substituted with dried cilantro. my husband loved it and said that it is good enough to remain in our regular rotation.

This recipe was amazing! For the first time ever, my husband tried my meal and went back for seconds and then made sure to pack a lunch for himself at work so he could have it one more time! I have to agree it is spicy so if you do not like the spice just put a little bit it. It gives a lot of flavor! It was a very easy recipe for me to follow. I had to cook on high for 3.5 hrs because of time and it worked great!

This recipe is AMAZING.  I substitute hominy for the corn because we love hominy, add a can of rinsed black beans and instead of the seasoning, i add an envelope of taco seasoning and an envelope of ranch dressing seasoning mix.  Very very good!  We have it at least 3 times a month!!

This is fantastic!  I don't like many crock pot recipes, especially for chicken but this is a keeper.  I also added black beans, rotel, and ranch seasoning as per other reviews.  I had it with cheddar cheese, sour cream and chips.  It's delicious, but very spicy!  For kids, you may want to serve it over rice and with a lot of cheese to cut down on spice.  My son loved it with rice, cheddar and mozzarella cheese, in a taco shell.

A little spicy for my young boys, but my husband really liked this recipe.  Tried to make it less spicy by not adding the green chiles, still too much for my kids.  Added tortilla chips to served portions.

This recipe was AWESOME! Fast and easy. Also easy to tailor to the liking of your family. I noticed that the cook time was about half of what is indicated (on the low setting), but that may just be my crockpot. To make it extra filling, I added one can of black beans (undrained) at the same time I shredded and added the chicken back to the pot. My family are not a fans of onions so I only put 1/3 of an onion. Also used "hot" enchilada sauce which gave the soup just enough spice to be perfect! Will definitely make this soup again!!!

This was really good. I think I would add more chiles in order to increase the spiciness.

This is delicious and easy!  I love a lot of broth, so I doubled the enchilada sauce and the chicken broth.  It was a bit spicy, so I garnished with lime juice and cheddar cheese.
