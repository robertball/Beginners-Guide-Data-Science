This was delicious. I used hot sausage meat and "crumbled" it myself and also used light cream instead of whipping cream to save on some of the fat. Next time I will use a little less broccoli rabe, as it was a little too bitter for our taste.

Fantastic! Due to allergies, I had to use turkey sausage crumbles, and it was great. I used fat free half and half with a touch of cornstarch to thicken instead of the whipping cream to cut down on the calories, and meet my dietary needs. I toasted the pine nuts, and it added a wonderful flavor. Thanks for this great recipe!

Good with some additions, like onions and garlic with less whipping cream

Good for a quick meal.  Used JD turkey crumbles and subbed frozen peas for the broccoli.

I used Trader Joe's sausage and whole milk instead of cream, but otherwise followed the directions exactly. Maybe it was just the sausage that I used, but the sausage taste was totally overpowering.

Really good! I made a few modifications... I used egg noodles because that's what I had on hand! I added two cloves of minced garlic after all the ingredients were together in one pan, and I added about 1/2 C. of shredded Italian blend cheese. Will defnintely make this again!
