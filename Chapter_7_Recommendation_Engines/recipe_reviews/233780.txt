Very subtle flavors that blend well together. No strong taste of any of the spices. I've had homemade and store-bought nuts such as these, and they can be overpowering. I made a half batch to try, and they're really good. UPDATE:  I realized later that I used cumin instead of curry (and they're called 'curried'....hello). Anyway, they were still very good!

These are amazing. Great with the recipe as written but I add a teaspoon of ground mustard. It adds an interesting depth of flavor. Great for snacking, I keep them in the fridge through the holidays.

Completely addictive! They are great for finger food or on a salad. I have played around with different curries ... a like Penzeys curry now or if Iâ€™m looking for something spicy i will use 1/2 curry now and 1/2 hot curry. I stick with 1 tsp total. I LOVE curry and have a tendency to add too much:)

12.26.15   These nuts are much more savory than sweet, with the "candied" feature being subtle...the perfect complement to a Holiday cocktail or beer!   The amount of curry was spot on for us.  You could taste it , but it didn't overwhelm as curry can do.  Thoroughly enjoyed these easy-to-make pecans.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
