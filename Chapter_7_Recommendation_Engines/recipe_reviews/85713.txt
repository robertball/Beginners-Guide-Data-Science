I love Bacardi Mixers ~ I only drink frozen blended drinks and they definetly make some great mixes!  I decided to make this recipe into a kid friendly version for the kids.  I followed the directions to a "T" with the exception of omitting the Rum with Apple Juice and using only 4 cups of ice.  I used my smoothie machine to blend them and they came out perfect!  Everyone loved them...Kids & Adults alike :-) The only problem, if that is what you want to call it, is that they were too thick to drink out of straw, so I spooned them into glasses and put both a spoon/straw into each one.  Once the drink started to melt they could then use the straw.

The first reviewer was correct - you cannot drink this with a straw and it is NOT creamy.  Had I seen that comment I would not have made this.  Here I was left with a pitcher of something that was more like a dessert than a cocktail.  I ended up pouring it into a pitcher and put it in the fridge to melt down and made pina coladas.  I forgot it was in the fridge - I saw the whole pitcher of it in the fridge this morning - it's definitely melted down!!!!  Maybe I will play with it tonite to try and salvage it (hate wasting that good Rum).  Won't make this again - too many recipes out there to experiment with!

Delicious! I couldn't find the Barcardi Frozen drink mix at my grocery store, but regular liquid Strawberry Daquiri Mix substitutes perfectly!
