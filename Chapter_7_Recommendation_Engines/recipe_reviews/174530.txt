Great recipe, a very easy, quick meal on a cold night. I added green beans, pepper and used onion powder rather than an onion. I didn't add as much cheese either and it was wonderful!

This was really good. I doubled the meat and the chicken broth and added 5 small potatos and 1 Tsp of miced garlic. My super picky 4 yr old liked it and my husband is already asking when I am going to make it again.

Wow!  this is really good. My son gave it two thumbs up, and he is very picky.  I did add a dash of pepper and cumin. I couldn't find grated Swiss cheese so I used fresh grated paresean cheese. (Hope I spelled it right) and yummy!

It was good.  I added some black pepper for flavor.  It has the potential for a cajun touch if creole seasoning or hot sauces are added.  I served it with Ritz crackers and it was a hit.  Great for a cold night.

Excellent taste! I added 2 medium potatoes and cooked them with the sausage/carrot mixture. I also had to add a little salt and pepper to our taste. I cooked it for 10 min once chicken broth and milk were added, just to make sure potatoes and carrots are tender. Husband loved it!

This is a great soup.  My whole family loved it, including a tween & 2 teens.  I wanted the soup to be a little heartier so I added pre-cooked small cubed red potatos (6 large).  I added one extra can of chicken stock to offset the addition of potatoes. We will definitely add this to our favorite recipes.

I just made this soup, it's very bland, maybe with some spices it might be okay.

I had some leftover brats I wanted to use in a soup. Glad I picked this one! It was excellent. I did add a few extras. I cooked 1/4 off a red pepper in EVOO along with the carrots and sprinkled in basil, oregano and garlic pdr. Very good!

Love this recipe, especially on cold winter evenings! Changes made as suggested by other reviewers: 1 lb. chopped potatoes (added during carrot/onion cook in pan step), 2% milk instead of whole milk, 1 cup of sharp cheddar cheese instead of two cups.  As a heads up: soup was super thick when we reheated it for dinner the second day.  We added extra milk to get the soupy texture back.

Great recipe, we simply added a bit of black pepper and some italian seasonings. Paired this with a homemade bread roll recipe and I was lucky I got anything after the kids got to it.

This was okay.  Perhaps it's because I'm not a big meat eater, but I felt this had too much meat.  Next time I make it, I'll probably cut the meat in half and add more vegetables.  Another reviewer suggested adding potatoes, which I think would be very good.  Maybe even some broccoli.  All in all and good start as written, but needs fiddling with.

Had this for dinner last night. It was pretty good. I didn't follow the directions perfectly but was still pleased with the results. I think I"d prefer to cook the sausage alone and then cook the other veggies. I added 1 diced russet potato to hearty it up some for us. I also didn't have a can of chicken broth so I made some with bullion. I also had hot sausage on hand so I used that. I think I'd make it again. It was a nice change.

This soup turns out pretty greasy if you don't thoroughly drain and rinse the sausage and use lower-fat cheese. That said, it's hearty and flavorful and very cravable on cold winter days.

This made a pretty good soup base, I just didn't like the sausage in it. I don't think I will make this again.

This is a great basic recipe. I added an extra can of broth, 3 extra carrots, 2 new potatoes, dill, salt, pepper, and doubled the flour. I served it with a biscuit on top of the soup. Fantastic for those nights you want breakfast for dinner!

Simple to put together and very good to eat!  I used beef broth because that's what I had on hand.

I really wanted to like this soup, but after I stirred in the cheese, it took on a strange, grainy consistency that I did not like.
