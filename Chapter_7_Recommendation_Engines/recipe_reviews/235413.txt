I made this for the family, and they lost their minds! The only changes I made were that I used 2 cups of sharp white cheddar, 2 cups of mild cheddar, and 2 cups of Gouda cheese.  I also used whole wheat panko bread crumbs on top and I had more than enough crumbs left over. I also added a few cups of leftover ham that was in the fridge, which I browned well first.  I had no issues with the texture of the sauce; it was perfectly smooth and creamy. Be sure to stir constantly as you add the milk and while it's thickening.

This was a great creamy plain old fashioned macaroni and cheese.  The first time I made it I used whipping cream and sour cream in place of all the milk.  Wow... creamy, comforting and fattening.  I did not use garlic powder because even though I love it, it did not sound good in mac and cheese.  The amount of pepper is way off.  The baking time was way off.  It took nearly 45 minutes to get bubbly in the center.  After that I made it so much, using no ground mustard and less pepper 1/4-1/2 t until it tasted good to me.  I also used crushed corn flakes instead of bread crumbs on the top of the casserole and drizzled the whole thing with another 1/2 cup of melted butter.  Definitely use a larger pan if you have one.  This went right to the top of my largest oblong glass dish which is larger that 13x9.

Too much flour! The texture was PASTY!! Otherwise, a good recipe. Next time I will use less flour & really didn't need that much black pepper either. Especially when feeding this to little kids.

This mac & cheese was Delicious! Starting with a rue makes for a creamy sauce. I used the suggested 1 & 1/2 cups of panko on top. Next time, I will reduce the amount to 1 cup. I took a pole of my 6 guests as we were eating. Everyone gave this recipe "two thumbs up".

Just needs a little fixing. I did not like the amount of bread crumbs for sure. Definitely at least cut that amount in half. Another issue I had was the order of instructions. I would melt the butter then add milk, heat for a few minutes, then I would slowly stir in flour, mixed well, to avoid too much clumping in the mixture.

Very similar to the recipe I have been making or years. The only difference is I use white paper instead of black and mixture of different cheeses. A pinch of nut mage doesn't hurt either in it.

My family loves this recipe.  I did change the amount of cheese.  I use four cups of cheddar and one cup of mozzarella.  It is not runny at all. My kids can't get enough.

I think this is a really great recipe.  I have made it twice now.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly except that I used about a cup of heavy cream I had in the refrigerator and I didn't have ground mustard so I used @ 1 tsp of Gouldens.  The only only small problem I found with this recipe was that there is way too much cheese sauce.  Luckily last time I had some leftover pasta in the fridge so I added it in and the problem was solved.  My family devoured it!!  I made it again today for a BBQ by request.  I needed to double the recipe and ended up with too much sauce again even though I really tried to quarter it.(That's probably on me!!)  At any rate, I just made more pasta and now I have more for the party:)

Very good.  But I ended up with too much cheese sauce.  I never thought mac and cheese could be too creamy, but it was.

It was not creamy enough for me.  I prefer the recipes with cream soup in them as they make better leftovers. I am all about the leftovers!

Had to tweak the recipe a little because I had to serve it the next day and place it in a crockpot. I think it turned out to be pretty awesome.

Ground mustard was much too much. I also used sour cream and it made a good difference. I added a little extra butter and crumbled French's onion rings on top near the end of baking.

We made this with the modification of a few other reviewers by adding bacon bits and green chilies.  We added these ingredients because the sauce was very bland and boring and we were trying to dress it up.  There is not a nice texture to the sauce: maybe too much flour.  It's also possible that there is too much mustard powder.

I used the three cheeses recommended by user KELLYB73. The Sharp (Old Cheddar here in Canada), medium and Gouda. Also I added bacon I had baked up and cut in to little squares.
It was absolutely delicious, kids asked for some in their lunches and sent some over to my dad. 
Tonight’s was a test run for some dinner guests coming on Sunday.
It was my first cheese and mac casserole and it was a winner!! 
Thanks for sharing the recipe McCormick!

This is our GO TO mac and cheese recipe! We do add wostershire and nutmeg and decrease the black pepper and ground mustard as well to suit our family's tastebuds. I always make double and freeze one for a quick weeknight meal. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent!!  Best Mac and cheese I have ever made.  My wife loved it.  Because there only two of , I cut the recipe in half.  Still, there was enough for both of us to have leftovers twice.  Definitely will make again.  My wife insists I will.

Excellent flavor. I used brown rice pasta instead of wheat pasta. I sautéed  1 cup of finely diced red onion in the butter before adding the flour. Great for potluck suppers.

I liked this but mine turned out a bit too dry- and I also added a couple packages of frozen broccoli, cauliflower-carrot mix the wife wasnt too impressed with. I think next time I'll take the one reviewers advise and use a smaller but deeper pan.  Tasty though- I will try again!

This was surprisingly yummy! 
I did make 2 tiny changes. I only put in 4 cups of cheddar and I threw in a container of cream cheese that I had in the fridge.
My oldest son will not touch boxed mac and cheese, but he LOVES this!

I’ve made this a couple times with limited success. The seasonings are nice but it has way too much milk. Runny so I thickened it up. Also made too much cheese for the pasta. Made as directed.

I made it and really enjoyed it.  This was my first time making macaroni and cheese from scratch.  I think the next time on it, I will try adding some other cheeses like a little Parmesan cheese for taste.  Thank you for sharing this receptive.

It was a huge hit with my family! The ratios were almost perfect, but I added more garlic powder, as well as onion powder and cayenne powder. I also generously seasoned the panko. Will definitely make it again!

Great recipe!! I used 2 cups sharp cheddar, 2 cups Colby jack, and 2 cups Swiss. Also used 12 oz evaporated milk + 2 cups whole milk. Added Parmesan cheese to the bread crumb topping. Everything else kept the same. Was a hit at thanksgiving! Very tasty

Found it to have a little too much sauce.  Had made a half of the recipe, but forgot to half the garlic powder.  Only put 1 tsp mustard and 1/4 tsp pepper.

Perhaps if you use a different type of cheese it would taste better.  Family was disappointed, but still edible. Not worth the calories.

Not really that great. Too much flour and sticking with one type of cheese, just make it too bland.

Great recipe - my husband and son ate the whole thing.  As others suggested, I  cut back on the Panko. I  also used 1 cup of heavy cream and 3 cups of milk. I used sharp cheddar, Colby and mozzarella.   To say it was  a hit would be an understatement!  Awesome!!!

This is a good macaroni and cheese, creamy enough but it doesn't have enough kick for me. First time to use paprika but wasn't detectable enough to make a difference.

This was very good!  The only thing I did different was I used a mix of cheddar and cheddar jack cheese.  Yumm!  I will definitely make this again.

It wasn't that great. Maybe I made it wrong. I followed the directions but the end result was blah. It just seemed like it was missing something. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either.

This wasn't creamy at all.  I reduced the serving size to 4.  Way too dry.

My whole family this! The leftovers only last one day! I try to sneak some broccoli and/or cauliflower in it to make it a little healthier. Good comfort food!

So of course a recipe for me is a guideline.  Made this recipe with my brother  (PRE father's  day baking day!) And we tweaked this but it was amazing! 1st we doubled the batch..used penne rigatte pasta (what we had) the milk was 8 cups...but used 1 cup whipping cream 4 cups milk and 3 half and half..again what I had...cheese was a handful of cubed cheeses we had..the rest was American and taco blend cheese...Panko was substituted for Ritz crackers and with paprika we added some garlic powder  and parm cheese...like I said..tweaked but amazing..not dry and delicious! Will make again for sure!
