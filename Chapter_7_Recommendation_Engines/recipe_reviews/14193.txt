Very good.  I tried it with and without the mustard.  We preferred it without since I wanted more of a vinaigrette than a honey mustard taste.  Halved the recipe for 4 servings and added 1 tsp olive oil.  Used it on mixed greens with avocado slices, Mandarin oranges, and fine slivers of red onion.  A hit!  Thanks, Jen.

I followed the advice of others and added one tablespoon of light olive oil and used frozen orange juice concentrate instead of juice for added body and flavor. I also use this as an all-day marinade for grilled chicken.

Delicious melding of subtle flavors. Great for people watching fat and calories. The only property I didn't like about it was the fact that with no oil, it drips right off the spinach or lettuce pieces. If I made this again, I would have to add a small amount of oil. I think sesame would be wonderful with this.

For those of you who don't like the look of dressing made with balsamic vinegar, there is white balsamic vinegar.  It is sometimes hard to find, but that is what we use and what we prefer.
Hope this helps.

This is exactly the kind of dressing I was looking for on our summer salads - light and full of flavor.  My husband and I both loved it and ended up just eating salad for dinner instead of as the first course.  :)  I also added a little oil to help it stick.

For a healthy eating plan, we would be hard pressed to find a better flavored salad dressing.  This recipe is a perfect combination of ingredients, with each contributing something to the taste, which is something close to a taste explosion.  My only complaint is that without any oil, the dressing has a tendency to slide off the salad.  Still, giving up the fat calories is a worthwhile tradeoff.

If you add double the OJ, it makes a fantastic

Not bad for low fat  - if you're on a diet this is a good choice.  I added some poppy seeds and used an orange juice with some pulp.  I served this over mixed greens with thin sliced red onion and orange segments.

Loved the fact that this is minus the oil... I did tweek it a little to suit my own taste.  Just added a little more orange juice and a bit of sugar and poppy seeds. I used it on the Mandarin Almond Salad recipe(also on this site). Everyone loved it, I was even told that it was the best salad they had eaten their whole life!!

My husband is on a diet and loves to eat salads with salad dressing so it is a challenge to find a dressing that he like to eat. This one is great! Thanks!!!

This is a really nice, refreshing vinaigrette.  I added 1 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil and used sugar instead of honey.  I used regular orange juice (NOT concentrate).  Served it on a salad of romaine, spinach, clementines, almonds and feta cheese.  Very nice!

Very Good! Like some others I too added about 1 T of EVOO to help the dressing stick.  I also didn't have OJ so I just used a bit of OJ concentrate and water (didn't measure...just by eyeball!).  The dressing had just the right amount of tang vs. sweet.  I served it over spinach leaves, walnuts, and crumbled gorgonzola.  Yum!  Thanks for sharing.

This was okay. It was pretty runny and didn't stick to the salad (probably due to the lack of oil). But an OK low-fat dressing.

This is one excellent dressing!  I used 1/2 orange juice and 1/2 orange juice concentrate and left out the honey since the concentrate was sweet enough.  I used white balsamic vinegar and  added about a 1/4 cup of olive oil to make the dressing adhere to the lettuce.  I tossed this with romaine hearts and threw in a handful of pecans and a few shakes of parmesan cheese.  Absolutely delicious.  Thanks for sharing Jen.

tried this vinaigrette out for the first time at a dinner party, for a lettuce, manderine and roasted almond salad. The guests were a little wary of the dressing at first - it has a very unusual colour - but all admitted that it was one of the best dressings they had ever tasted.

Wonderful!  I added 1 Tbl. olive oil, as others suggested, and it did the trick of staying on the lettuce.  I also added a large pinch of orange peel spice to make it even more orangey.  Will definite make the same changes again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum!  A new way for my kids to eat their veggies!  Served it with a spinach salad with fresh raspberries and blueberries, and sunflower seeds.  The adults enjoyed feta too.  I did add a tiny bit of oil to make it stick, and sprinkled some ginger too.  I used a freshly squeezed orange for the juice.  Thank you!

The flavours of this vinaigrette were delicious and different, but I found it too acidic as written. Added about 2 tbsp olive oil and that smoothed it out nicely. Thanks!

This recipe is really delicious, fast, and simple! The mustard and orange combo is what really makes the flavor of this over the top; The perfect compliment to our spinach, Parmesan, almonds, cranberry, and orange slice salad. I also added a tablespoon of olive oil to the recipe, as per suggestions and it was perfect.  I would add only one tsp of honey and then add the other if you want after tasting because it is quite sweet with that and the orange juice, and depends on what you are putting it on.

Fabulous, light salad dressing.  I added 2 Tbs olive oil so the dressing would adhere to the salad better.  I used this on spinach salad with grilled chicken, mandarin oranges, bleu cheese crumbles and candied pecans--YUM.

I made this dressing twice so far. The first time I used balsamic vinegar, which was a stronger taste than what I wanted. The second time I used white vinegar for a more delicate flavor.

I love it.  I had it with green lettuce, blueberries, and orange.  I didn't have any chia seeds on hand so I added a little psyllium husk to make it thicker.  Thank you

This dressing is tasty! I made it in the Dijon mustard bottle with the last little bit of mustard left. Tart, tangy and terrific!

This was okay. I  didn't care too much for the orange juice taste on salad or the fact that it wouldn't stick. If I decide to make this again I will probably use it as a marinade. Thanks for the recipe!!

I followed the recipe exactly except I added a little bit of olive oil and used frozen orange juice concentrate.  It had a really nice, light balsamic flavor that went well with toasted almonds and feta cheese.  I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is amazing. The flavors are perfect together. Of course, because there is no fat in it, it will not stick to your salad lettuce and veggies- but this is normal with all natural non-fat dressings. The second time I made it I added sesame oil and it was even better. Just a teaspoon of the sesame oil makes a world of difference! Try it. If you like the ingredients alone, you will love them together in this dressing.

Excellent  dressing, especially if you're dieting.  I had honey bells and fresh squeezed one and doubled the recipe.  Absolutely delicious!!  Skip the calories and forget the olive oil.

Oh gosh this is my new favorite homemade dressing by far!!  I've made this twice, the second time I cut the honey in half and still found it had a great sweetness to it.  Next time I think I'll try without the honey all together, to see how that taste.  Love it!

This is a fabulously light citrus dressing.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and wouldn’t change a thing.  I love that it has no oil and I found the dressing clung to the salad greens quite well.   The dressing was full of flavor and the orange juice was just the right amount of citrus.  This was a nice change from our usual vinaigrette and I will be making this often.

This was delicious! I made it with OJ concentrate rather than diluted OJ as suggested in previous reviews. I made up a whole bottle and stuck it in the fridge so it is there when I want it. My new favorite!!

Just perfectly fit what I wanted! Didn't add any oil, trying to keep it as light as possible. Wonderful as is, even if I had to dip my lettuce into the dressing.

Very tangy.  You will definitely want to add 2 tablespooons or so of oil to help it stick to your salad.  I served it with endive, thinly sliced green apple, toasted pecans, and crumbled goat cheese--an excellent fall salad!

Added orange zest which bought our the orange taste more. Absolutely loved it. Served it on a salad of baby spinach, romaine lettuce, celery, spring onions, and orange segments. Accompanied by cold roast beef slices spread with creamed horseradish, rolled and cut into bite size pieces. 
Is going on my favourites list.

Wasn't til I was eating it before I realized there was no oil! I didn't even miss it. Lovely dressing that we enjoyed. Next time I will follow other reviewers ideas and include white balsamic and perhaps some chia seeds. UPDATE: white balsamic works wonderfully, in fact I think it tastes even better!

I made this with clementines (since I didn't have oranges on hand) and it was DELICIOUS. I definitely recommend use fresh-squeezed juice over bottled juice--the flavors are more complex.

I used it on a clementine/roasted asparagus/cashew salad and it was WONDERFUL. The olive oil I'd roasted the asparagus in helped the dressing stick to the salad.

This was very good, but the mustard flavor really came through more than I had hoped it would.  I'll make it again, but this time I'll add about half the mustard and a little olive oil instead.

Fantastic fat-free dressing! Tasty, refreshing! The only addition I made was to add a pinch of salt.

Pretty good. Not awesome, but I will definitely make it again. I think the only reason it wasn't awesomely good was because my balsamic wasn't the best.

This has a great flavor, but the fact that the recipe has no oil means it doesn't stick to the veggies very well and everything just settles to the bottom.  I made the recipe just as written, but after a few bites I added some oil (about 1 1/2 tsp. for my portion of salad) and that helped.  I really liked the flavors in this one and I'll be making it again for sure.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy and gult free salad dressing! I also used it to marinade chicken in and that was great.  I was out of balsamic vinegar though and used apple cider vinegar instead.

I enjoyed this very much and will definitely make it again.  I really like strong and very flavorable foods so next time I'll add a 1/2 tsp of sesame oil and some fresh minced garlic.  I think it would then be spectacular!  Served it over a spinach salad with mandarins, wonton chips, carrots and feta cheese.

This was tasty, I blended it in the blender to  make it creamier, but then it looked yucky because the color was brown-grey.  aside from that it was good!

this was awesome!  even without reading the other reviews, i added a few drops of sesame oil, and it was amazing. a little extra black pepper is also good in this recipe, and contrasts the sweet orange flavor well.  this is good chilled like suggested, or warm.  really good :)

I loved this dressing.

I added:

Minced onions
Minced Ginger
Olive oil
Orange Zest

I also used the freshly squeezed orange juice and i think that was the best decision of all.

It was a pretty good base dressing, but not enough kick for me.  I added a pinch of brown sugar, a little oil, crushed red pepper flakes and dry mustard powder to kick it up a bit.

There's a lot you can do with it, but as is, it was lacking.  I gave it a 4 regardless.

This was lovely! I used tangerines instead of oranges and added about a teaspoon of tangerine zest; I also added the olive oil as recommended by others. Even a friend who said she didn't like spinach salad, liked it with this dressing on it. :)

This was delicious.  Since I was going to add mandarin oranges to the salad, I used that juice.  Followed other suggestions and cut back on the dijon and added 1 tbsp of olive oil.  Turned out great.

Loved this dressing!  I used 5 Tablespoons of mandarine orange juice... because I had a bunch of them sitting around. I also substituted honey mustard in place of the Dijon mustard and used only about 1 teaspoon of it.  It turned out great.  We will be using this vinaigrette a lot this summer!

I would make this again. I used HALF the balsamic vinegar because I HATE it, and that cut the vinegar flavor (bringing out everything else).  3/5 stars only because I've had homemade citrus dressings in the past that were amazing, but they didn't contain any vinegar.

Very good, I did add a tablespoon of olive oil, and a little more honey. Good basic receipe that you can modify depending on the type of salad you are having.

I made one batch due to the low calorie and health perspective. I loved it so much I tripled the recipe. It is the BOMB! Only mod was added 2 T of EEOV to it. Had it on lettuce and also marinated tomatoes in it. would probably be a good marinade for chicken. YUMMY Thanks!

Very good and I like the fact that there is no oil in it. It was a little sweet for my taste, so I decreased the honey by half.

THis was so good and exactly what I was looking for.  I had a cayenne pepper honey and I used that in this and left out the pepper,  gave it a lot of zing.

Delish!  I forgot the pepper, but it was great without it! I'm going to try it with white balsamic next time.  Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe for dressing.  Easy to make - we had all ingredients for it on hand. We eat it with spinach, dried cranberries, feta cheese, and candied walnuts several times a week.

Added a tiny drizzle of avocado oil to help it cling to the greens and a small minced shallot, but it's also great as is.

I didn't like the overall flavour of this dressing.  Plus, I used OJ concentrate as per other posters' recommendations and it overpowered this vinaigrette.

This was very easy and delicious!  I added 1/2 serrano pepper (seeded and chopped) for 15 minutes while shaking and stirring and then strained the pepper pieces out.  Created a nice heat that could easily be adjusted!  VERY VERY GOOD will make over and over!

This is amazing! I used it on a pasta salad and added a bit of cilantro. Loved it and will use it for added flavor to a variety of recipes.

Loved it! I chose to omit the honey as well, but I added a capful of vanilla extract. It reminds me of the orange vinaigrette I get at a local restaurant, and tastes almost like a cremesicle!
I also used orange blossom honey (since that is what I had in my pantry), to keep the orange theme/flavors going.

This is phenomenal.  I use just a bit of olive oil cause I'm doing Weight Watchers, and its great that way too.  This is now the only dressing my husband wants me to make.

I just wasn't crazy about this, even though I thought I'd like it. I tried it on both asparagus and salad, and liked it better on asparagus - but not enough to make it again.

This was really good. I made it and used Wasabi mustard since I didnt have any other kind of hand. It definitely had a bit of a kick to it! Next time I will make with Dijon mustard and try it that way. (Although was pretty good how I made it!)
