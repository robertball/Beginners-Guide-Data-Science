This is a good cocktail, like most bars make it. The secret to an awesome Cosmo is using 1 tsp. of Roses Lime Juice instead of lime. It balances tart of cranberry. 
You can get Roses at most grocery stores.

This is really good. I have always liked cosmos, and wanted to make one myself...i felt like such a pro! One great variation is to use white cranberry juice, it looks very pretty, gaining only a very slight green color from the lime juice. Men seem to be more receptive to the "non-pink" drink as well! :o)

I loved this drink.....think I am addicted. I ran out of cranberry juice, but had raspberry-cranberry juice on hand....nice variation...raspberries, cranberries, limes and the orange cointreau. Will definitly be making more of these!

Very strong, but oh-so-smooth, and quite tasty (!!) so watch out. I made ice-cold pitchers of these for a party, rented cosmopolitan glasses and the women were wild about them. The men weren't too crazy about the idea of drinking pink drinks, so they stuck to the beer, though.

Fabulous drink!  I just love these, especially after a rough day.  The only thing I do different is to garnish with a lemon twist vs. a lime twist.

This is an amateur cosmo - it might as well be a Cape Cod with all of that cranberry juice. A real cosmo is barely pink - martini-style. The way this recipe is written it should just be served over ice - maybe add a splash of club soda.

Too sweet for me. If you really want to be knocked out (not literally I hope), try this: 1 ounce ginger-infused vodka (like Skyy), 1 ounce plain vodka, 1 ounce Cointreau, 1 ounce "Just Cranberry,"  1 ounce fresh lime juice and one-half ounce simple syrup. Put a couple of ice cubes in your shaker and shake well. Serve in a chilled glass. Beautiful color and taste. Works fine with all plain vodka too. Whatever you do, don't use the cranberry juice cocktail stuff. Use the real cranberry.

Very good - but definitely use the Rose's Lime instead of Lime Juice.  It's sweeter.  I can't afford cointreau either, so I just used triple sec.  Maybe with cointreau, the real lime juice is ok.  Grand Marnier would probably be great also - if you can afford $40 for a bottle or orange liquer.

Although this is a kind of martini, and I've drank a lot of cosmo's in the past, I found this mix really lacked something - so I changed it.  I added 1 1/2 oz of vodka, 1 oz of triple sec (I had no cointreau), and about 2.5 oz of cranberry juice, this was the perfect mix!!

I made the thrifty version using Roses Lime Juice, Raspberry vodka, and Triple Sec. They are oh so smooth poured into a frosted Martini glass. I'm afraid to have more than two.

This was my first attempt at making a cosmo at home.  Yum!!  I used triple sec instead of cointreau, Rose's sweetened lime juice, and cran-raspberry juice.  I rimmed the glass with sugar and garnished with a lime wheel.  Fantastic!  These will really sneak up on you, so I limit myself to one... or maybe two...

This is the classic cosmo recipe for sure, but I used new Smirnoff Cranberry vodka instead.  Makes the drink much better.

I brought this recipe on our annual girlfriend's weekend getaway and everybody agreed that it was the best Cosmopolitan we ever had. I used Absolute Citron vodka. Don't know if that made any difference but they were wonderful! Thanks,Goldie!

I'm a beer girl so this was my first attempt at making mixed drinks.  Made these for a bachelorette party and everyone LOVED them!!!  Even got compliments from a guest who is a bartender!  Made them virgin for a pregnant guest by substituting Sprite for vodka.

This is yummy! I didn't have cointreau, so I just omitted it.  If you are used to a sweeter drink, garnish the rim of the glass with sugar.  I will definitely make this again.

Goes from 4 to 5 stars if you only fill the glass halfway and pour champagne into the glass. Don't stir it. Yum.

Finally, someone that knows how to make a Cosmopolitan!  I use Raspberry Stoli's or if I don't have that on hand, Cran-Raspberry juice with a splash of Rose's Lime juice, just a personal preference thing.  But, this recipe is great just the way it is written.  Thank you!!

A little sweet for my taste as-is.  Using Cranberry/Raspberry juice and juice from a fresh lime (rather than reconstituted) gave it a very pleasing tartness to offset the sweetness.  After those modifications, it was a sure "5" star.

I thought this was perfect!  I hate ordering Cosmos at restaurants that don't know how to make them properly.  Never, ever, ever use Roses lime juice, as some suggested.  That is like using Sweet and Low instead of sugar in a recipe.  It tastes off and artificial.  Also, Cointreau is the best orange liquor.  Much better quality than Triple Sec.  I just wish I would have thought to freeze my martini glass ahead of time!

For extra flavor, cut lime in half and crush it with ice, (muddle) the remove rind, squeezing out all the juice.  Add rest of the ingredients and shake really well.  The colder the better.  Rub rim of glass with lime.  Put sugar on small plate then place glass rim side down and coat with the sugar.  Awesome!

LOVE this drink!  I also made a few changes, similar to the other reviewers.  I use Rose's lime juice (purchase at the grocery store to save money).  I substituted triple sec for the Cointreau because of cost.  I also used citrus vodka because it was what I had on hand.  Delicious!

These are deceivingly delicious...strong but you can't tell.  I had three and was tore up!  My husband didn't like them, he thought they tasted like grapefruit juice.  I will definitely make these again!

I set out to make this as written.  Then, I discovered our cranberry juice was so old it had gigantic "floaters" so I had to sub Ocean Spray Diet Sparkling Cranberry juice (which I prefer, anyway).  I'm not a fan of orange, nor do we stock cointreau, so I left it out.  Despite the blue appearance in my photo from the blue martini glass, this was a nice reddish drink.  I'm still going to stick to beer, but this was a nice change of pace.  I rimmed the glass w/raw sugar to add some texture.  Thanks for the recipe, Goldie!

Since I had never had one of these drinks in a bar/lounge, I wasn't really sure how to proceed.  allrecipes.com to the rescue!  Because of all the good input from "drinkers" on this site I tailored one to suit my taste.  Used Rose's lime juice, a splash of lemon juice and had to add a couple of pkts. of sweetner to balance it.  I've found using several pkts. of sweetner (yellow pkts.) is easier than making simple syrup.  Used the other ingredients as written.  Kinda' prissy drink but very tasty.  My DH said:  REAL men don't drink pink drinks!! ;o)  Thanx ya'll!

So I saw the SATC movie last night and so I had to try these! I'm a total light weight and like only a handful of drinks but am adding these to the (short) list! I recommend using a good quality vodka (I used ketel one)- that makes a huge difference! If you do you won't taste the alcohol. This mix made 2 (served in a martini glass). Chill your glasses, shake for at least a few seconds, and you will LOVE these! So pretty, and pretty tasty!!

I've always made this at home with the same ingredients just different measurements. These are definitely the best measurements. I've never had a better home-made cosmo! And I use Rose's lime juice instead of actual lime.

If using 100% cranberry juice, it's way too sour; if using cranberry drink it's ok. I also used Rose's Lime Juice instead of fresh lime juice. My niece said it tased just like what the bartenders make-which may be good or bad!

Not quite sweet enough for me (and I'm not really a girly drink kind of person), but I think if I used triple sec instead of contreau it would be perfect.

I've been using this recipe exactly as written for years now and I frequently compare it to cosmos I order when I'm out.  No others compare.  This is delicious.  It is a bit on the strong side - easily adjusted to taste with more cranberry cocktail.  The cointreau makes a difference, I believe. I think most bars make it with Triple Sec (cheaper) and that's the difference I'm tasting. Gotta go make a batch for our party tonight - our guests are in for a treat.  Thank you, Goldie!

Way too strong! I added extra cranberry juice and it still had such an odd flavor. I tried it with Rose's Lime Juice, regular lime, and even tried both. I ended up adding beer to this to cut the sweetness. Works like a charm with just about any cocktail, but I'll keep looking to find something that fits my tastes. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good recipe, I changed the portions a bit in order to make 2 drinks at a time.  Fill shaker 3/4 full of ice.  I used 2 oz vodka, 1 oz Triple Sec, the juice of one small lime or half of a large lime and added cranberry juice to tasate (almost to the top).

These are great! I just made it to test out before I have some friends over. I had Ciroc vodka on hand and also used Light Cranberry Juice. Next time I'll try the Roses Lime juice like others have suggested.
I definitely recommend using a quality vodka like Grey Goose or Kettle One - that makes all the difference!

This is a fantastic recipe for cosmos. I however prefer to use Rose's lime cordial instead of fresh lime juice. It really helps balance the cranberry juice. Yum!

Almost perfect, for my tastes. I add a tad more Cointreu and a bit less cranberry juice. You can mix it up with orange flavored vodka, if you prefer. That's very good. You can also use white cranberry juice, instead of the red. Yummy.

Loved this recipe!!! Made it for a special party. Only one guest thought it tasted like cough syrup! My 92 yr old mom loved it and she's not a vodka drinker!! She asked for it again! Thought it tasted just like you get at a bar. A bartender/liquor store employee told me I could use Triple Sec instead of cointreau and I did! Will make over and over again!!!  THANKS!!!!

A friend of mine made me a Cosmo.  I'd never had one before and thought it was too sweet.  So, I tried making my own using this recipe.  WOW!  I'm the one making the Cosmos now.

Best with lime rubbed around the rim of the glass and very little or no lime juice.  Extra cranberry juice is fine...

MAMASPICE LOVES HER SOME MARTINI'S!  Use premium Grey Goose Vodka (go wild and try the orange or lemon flavors) and Roses Lime juice.  Be sure to give the keys to someone else cause you won't be driving after a few of these!!  These and Dirty Martini's are THE BEST!

It was good; I made it both ways - once with the Rose’s Lime Cordial as one reviewer suggested, and once with fresh lime juice.  I preferred the version with the Lime Cordial, surprisingly!  I think next time I make it, I MAY use a half ounce more cranberry juice, but then it’s probably not a true Cosmopolitan.  Either way, nice cocktail for any time of the year!
