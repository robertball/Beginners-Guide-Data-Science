I really enjoyed this salad! It was my first time making an Israeli salad, and since I had some mint to use up, this was perfect!  I used about equal parts of tomato and cucumber since I didn't have 4 cucumbers.  I thought 2 cucumbers was a good ratio.  I also used half the black pepper (personal preference) and 1.5 tsp salt instead of 1 tbsp (that seemed like a lot!).  It was plenty salty with the reduced salt. I also don't think 1/2 cup of oil is necessary. Start with 1/4 cup and decide if you'd like more.  This salad creates a lot of liquid after it sits for a while.  I loved the hint of lemon and the parsley/mint combination. I'll be making this one again! With the tweaks I made, it's def a 5 star recipe.

Refreshing and light. Only used 2 cucumbers, 1/4 cup of olive oil and 3 tbsp of lemon juice. Otherwise, no changes. Just a note, make sure to whisk the the lemon juice and  olive oil together for a minute or two before pouring on salad.

Like a couple other reviewers, I decreased the salt to 1 teaspoon since I only used two cucumbers and that was plenty for my taste. I did not use garlic or onion since my guests do not eat either (but I love both). I also added an avocado sliced which was a nice addition to  make up for not using the onion. And also cut the oil to 1/4 cu as well. I will make this again with all the ingredients.  Thanks for this tasty recipe!

I made this recipe just how it said but the only thing I changed was the parsley. I used parsley flakes in place of fresh leaf parsley. Once the lemon (I used 1 1/2 lemons) incorporates with the tomato and cucumber juices, it really makes a difference. In my experience with cold salads, they all taste so much more amazing each day afterward because it has time to suck up all the juices and marinate within itself. yum! Definitely recommend this as a healthy meal alone for those watching their weight or as a perfect summer side dish with some Swai fish fillets broiled or grilled in a lemon pepper marinade.

Good salad. I'm not familiar with Israeli salad, but a ratio of one English cucumber to one Roma tomato would, I think, be a cucumber salad =) ... I scaled the recipe to two servings and used nearly equal amounts of English cuke and halved grape tomatoes (all I had). Nice light summertime salad.

Beautiful summer salad. I added extra lemon juice and ground lemon pepper for a bit more zing. Very tasty.

When I make a recipe the first time I typically will use the recipe unless something is really not to my taste.  I loved this recipe, it made me miss Israel and those fresh veggies.  However, it seems like WAY to much pepper and parsley...I will reduce that back tremendously next time I make this and use more lemon juice.

Very good I usually make this with romaine lettuce as a salad all the same ingredients minus the pepper the bell pepper and the garlic but this recipe here is very good better than the regular salad the garlic is great in it as I love garlic I added some garlic salt after tasting it and it needed more salt I figured it could use a little flavor too I also added green onion as I use that in my salad

Calgarygirl's comment was uncalled for.id  venture to say she hadn't  Even tried the Salad.. .  Great salad.  Cucumber to tomato ratio should be more proportionate in my opinion and experience.

It is so flavorful! We eat it with the Spiced Ground Lamb recipe or Chicken Schwarma and some tatziki sauce. I omit the mint but that’s just our family’s preference.

I used some small tomatoes and a cucumber from my garden, along with a nice red poblano pepper (seeded) instead of the bell pepper, because it was ready and waiting form the garden. Tastes nice, clean, and fresh, if a bit mild. Hoping to try again when my heirlooms are ready.

Made with fresh mint and parsley from the garden. My only regret was that the tomatoes are not quite grown yet... 
Whole family devoured it, even tipping the bowls to get the last bit of juice.
Added a bit of sumac powder to give a Lebanese twist, as per the fatoush suggestion of another reviewer.

Served  as a  side at   our  holiday bbq.   Made more than enough.  Very refreshing on  hot  day! I wish i had made it a few  hours ahead  or the night before, to give the flavors a  chance to strengthen.

Very tasty! I love cucumber salad and thought with was right on par. My one recommendation is to use curly parsley, specifically. I used Italian flat leaf (that's what I had already) and I think it was missing that more-herby taste that comes with it. Very good though and I didn't think there was too much liquid as the lots of olive oil is one of the tasty parts!

I liked this salad. It tastes especially good after marinating in the refrigerator for a couple of hours. It is a bit salty so I reduced the amount I add.

Made as written with the addition of red pepper as well as the green peppers called for and had some roasted garlic that I added.  Outstanding!  My mom made something similar when I was growing up. Perfect spring  / summer salad.  Plus I like it better the next ay after the flavors have had a chance to mingle.  A great way to enjoy home grown tomatoes too.  Enjoy!

This salad is delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and chopped the veggies in small cubes.  Love it, crunchy and refreshing!  I'll see how it holds up overnight.  If it's too soggy, I'll reserve the dressing until I serve it next time.  I'll definitely make it again.

This is a delicious and refreshing salad.  Made it according to the recipe, and my only change would be to use less salt next time.  Otherwise, it's perfect as is.

i used this recipe as inspiration for a salsa using what i had left in the fridge/on hand.. i cut this in half and used one regular cucumber.. didn't have any onion or mint so left those out.. i subbed cilantro for parsley and reduced the olive oil, salt, and pepper drastically.. seasoning to taste.. at this point this was a nice light salad but i wanted something more mexican so i added a few shakes of cumin, oregano, and onion powder.. very good.. ty for the recipe

Nice light salad. Great for summer. I am a salt fiend, so I did 1.5 tablespoons instead of just 1. Also, next time will be adding more tomatoes.

Very good! Olive oil, lemon juice, parsley and mint really made this salad tasty!
