I made this along with a bunch of other dishes for a party, and this was, by far, the standout of the evening!  The only adjustment I made to the recipe was simmering the figs, brown sugar, & vanilla in much more water than the two Tbsp. for about twenty minutes until it turned syrupy.  Then I refrigerated this overnight before using on the cheese the next day, letting the figs really absorb the syrup and soften.  Heavenly!

I have made this several times now and it is just wonderful. As a timesaver, I purchased fig jam from Williams-Sonoma and put this on top of the brie (rind removed throughout). Also, try it with pecans.

We thought this was delicious.  It was a great dinner - green salad, this, and French bread.  Mmmm.  A few thoughts - if your figs are very ripe, you don't need 10 minutes to soften them.  Whole, toasted almonds are divine in this.  And if you peel the rind off your cheese, it becomes a gooey dip.  Next time we'll leave the rind on so it stays a bit more in its' original form.

I decided to try this recipe and it was absolutely wonderful. Everyone loved it!! I cut each fig into 8 pieces and cut the almonds into halves. The cheese was done in less than 10 minutes. Next time I'll add more figs and make more syrup. It was really yummy!!

Delicious and a hit at the party.  I could not get fresh figs, used 1/2 pkg of dried about 8-12, increased the water to 4T and the vanilla to 1t.  Cooked the figs longer to soften.  Next time I'll try soaking the figs overnight.

This is an excellent recipe! I used a 20 oz. baby brie. I also cut the figs into eigths. I kept the almonds whole, but toasted them in the oven for about 15 minutes. Finally, instead of water crackers, I served the cheese with french bread. The result was visually gorgeous and tasted wonderful. Thank you for the recipe!

These were great after initially not liking this.  But, I stuck with it and reread some of the reviews to see what I needed to do to make it better.

1) Don't eat it with heavy crackers like Wasa- it messes up the flavor combination.  We used Honey Butter Ritz and that was much better.

2) Next time I'll chop up the figs because they hold together too much in just quarters and it's hard to spread on a cracker without getting a huge glob of fig.

3) Be sure to cook the figs, sugar, water, vanilla combo long enough to get it think and goopy.  It needs to blend well with each other.  

Very exotic tasting and fancy! We had it with Salmon and Wild Rice and it was a fabulous meal!

I only used half a wheel of cheese (camembert... because that what I had) but I made the full amount of syrup, upping the water to about 4 tbp. I made it a couple of hours ahead & let it sit, covered, on the stove until hubby came home. The almonds (I used slivered) got kinda soft & carmelized...I loved them! And the figs imparted such great flavor to teh simple syrup....be sure & make extra syrup! I served it w/ barely buttered, toasted french bread. Fabulous, easy  recipe....thanks for sharing Casandra!

We have a fig tree that is really producing this year.  After reading this recipe, I decided to try it.  My husband and I both loved it!  I'm not that crazy about figs but this was wonderful.  I did take other advice and make more syrup.  Can't wait to make this again for friends!  Awesome!

Just now made this. Fabulous!! I used half the sugar, may even cut it some more next time. I want to really taste the figs. Everything else was the same amounts. I also used goat cheese the sharp taste of the goat cheese with the sweet, WOW !! Also used pecans that I toasted. Spread the cheese and topped with the fig mixture on a multi-grain and rice cracker. TO DIE FOR!!

YUM!  Also great with goat cheese, if you don't have brie.  I made both side by side and the goat cheese seemed a little sweeter.

I made this for a wine tasting party I hosted and got great compliments. It was quick and easy. Used canned figs. I almost dumped the fig/brown sugar mixture because I got a big waft of throwup smell in the first 5 minutes of heating it on the stove. So glad I didn't - the weird smell went away and the end result was so much more complex, savory and elegant than the brie with raspberry combination. I gave the recipe out to the girls and plan to make again!

We LOVE this!! We always have an abundance of figs in late summer, so I use our own for this scrumptious brie - I don't change a thing. Also delicious with the almond/fig sauce on the brie then wrapped in puff pastry and baked.

So amazing.  I used dried figs (near the raisins at the store).  I cut off the tops of about ten and put them in simmering water for five minutes before proceeding with the recipe.  I thought they were better cut up in smaller pieces.  Maybe cut each fig into 6-8 pieces.  I also used slivered almonds and they were perfect.  This was really marvelous and everybody raved.  I also served the Avacado salsa recipe on this site by Barbara Vinson. People went crazy for it!

Excellent and easy appetizer. Looks very pretty on the table. I read a bunch of reviews and have come to decide that it's all about personal taste. I love Brie and I'm not a HUGE fan of sweet. So, I need to accomodate that. Others might really need the sweet (or love the sweet) to work with the richness of the cheese. I doubled the syrup as per other reviews. Really found it would have been fine without. I ended up tossing a bunch of the leftover figs and syrup. I'd probably use a little less brown sugar too.  It was really super sweet. A total hit regardless. The chums agree it was too sweet. I might try to throw some cranberries in next time to tone down the cavity factor. Worth perfecting to your own personal taste. If you like super sweet, double up and use lots of sugar. If not, keep it simple and perhaps look for a nice offset flavor to add.

I've made this twice for company and have received rave reviews.  Both times, I have used dried figs.  Same quantity, but diced.  I also use more water to help hydrate the figs.  (Sorry, I eyeballed it - probably about 4 tbsp total).  I also didn't bother toasting the almonds.  No one seemed to mind!

Tasted wonderful, was very easy to make and had nice presentation.  Served this appetizer at a wine appreciation party and it was a huge hit!  Many suggested this become my "signature dish" for future parties and I couldn't agree more!

I used walnuts instead of almonds, another great flavor combo.  This is very easy to make!  Make sure you have the figs prepared before starting the sugar, it melts pretty quickly.  I wasn't a fan of the brie but plan to make the topping to go over ice cream or custard.

Thank you for the recipe! I can't wait to try this! I tried a Baked Brie w/Brown Sugar @ a friend's a few wks ago and really wanted to try it. Found Brie @ the local grocer for 5.99 for 8oz wheele-and Camembert for 1.59 for 8oz (close to exp date). Got a loaf of French Bread for $0.90 and already have figs. Looking forward to chillin' in front of the TV tomorrow night w/the honey and nibbling this with a glass (or 2) of wine!

Wonderful!  Mid-August our fig tree produces so many figs we don't know what to do with them!  Each year when I make this I freeze small batches and defrost them when I need something special and different to serve to our guests.  Love it!

So good and so easy!  I couldn't find fresh figs and used dried instead.  I added enough water to cover the figs in a small saucepan and simmered until syrup-y.  Next time, I will cut the figs into smaller pieces since they seemed just a little too big.  Watch your cheese closely in the oven.  I baked too long and it melted.  No one complained as they scooped out the delicious gooey goodness.  Served with Ritz-type crackers.

* * WONDERFUL * *  I served it for a group of 12 people and it went down very well. The combination of flavors is fantastic. I couldn't get fresh figs, so I used the "semi-dry" ones that come in packets in the dried-fruit section of the grocery store. A definite keeper!

Yum! I made this for a ladies night out/wine event. Everyone loved it. I followed other's suggestions for additional syrup, but I think it made it too sweet. Next time, I'll follow the directions as written. Thanks for posting!

i saw fresh figs at the store and decided to make something with them for a party i'm going to. i just did a test run- i made a couple changes. i had to compensate for a gluten and nut free house, so i found udi's nut and gluten free granola instead of the nuts. but for my test run i also sprinkled some toasted sliced almonds on top as well as fresh orange zest and a little drizzle of honey- all on top of chevre goat cheese. the orange zest really livens it up and cuts into that sweet. i also cut down on some of the sugar.  trader joes makes the perfect cracker for this treat- raisin rosemary crisps. i think they might have just started carrying them. delish!  i'm going to omit the nuts, but keep the rest for the party and bake a brie wedge with it as well as spoon it over room temp goat cheese.

Love this recipe! I'm not a huge fan of brie but I can never get enough of it this way, I've even converted other non-brie fans with it.

This recipe sounded so good, but was entirely too sweet!  My guests would not eat it - several of them.  I was disappointed as I was really looking forward to a great recipe using fresh figs.

Guests and hubby like this.  Works better with dried figs than fig preserves.  Havn't been able to find fresh figs yet, but I look forward to using fresh figs.

I tried the recipe last night - I used a jar of fig conserve (about 4 oz) that had orange rind in it, toasted sliced almonds in a fry pan on top of the stove until just brown, put the conserve in to melt it, and then poured it on top of the brie.  It was perfect and everyone loved it, especially my husband.  I served it with water crackers, but did not like the combination - next time I will use something wholegrain.  We served another, slightly tart appetizer with it to cut some of the sweetness.

I had it as an appetizerand a desert, either is a hit. To keep the calories down I substitute sugar to canderel, and if in a hurry use a microwave. Just make sure to watch the cheese not to melt too much.

My husband was a bit leery, not a fruit person, but I made this and we both loved it. 
I used about ten figs thinly sliced, same amount of sugar, and rest of ingredients. I wouldn't want it any sweeter than it was. 
He just planted a fig tree for me, so it will be awhile before we can harvest any, my mom gets them from a neighbor. 
This is my first recipe and will need to collect more.
Thanks Casandra.

Wow, this was delicious and so easy! No fresh figs to be found at my grocery, either, so chopped up about 8 dried. Eventually added it to the sugar/water mixture on the stove along w/the vanilla as another reviewer suggested. Almost forgot about it, too. Thankfully, it didn't burn. Used about 3 TBSP water due to reviews but next time, I'll probably stick to the 2. Toasted a bunch of sliced almonds - didn't measure. Mixed in w/the rest, poured over my partially-peeled brie (went around the sides and somewhat scraped  the top and bottom, but not thoroughly) and baked as directed. Served with water crackers and it was delicious. All the attendees at my girls night loved it. Delish!

Delicious.  I recommend cutting all the rind off the top of the brie before pouring on the sauce.  I used slivered almonds and chopped the figs.

Wow, is this decadently rich and delicious! I used many more figs - probably 8 cut in small pieces and the half-cup brown sugar. Next time I'll use less sugar (probably 1/4 cup), as it was a bit too sweet for even my strong sweet tooth. I used almonds that I browned in some butter and added to the top. I ate it on French bread all by MYSELF - YES - I was totally decadent! :-)

AWESOME! Classy and delicious. I baked the brie for 10 minutes but that was too much and it melted (though the gooey cheese was scrumptious too), so I recommend checking it while it's in the oven. What am I going to do when the figs are out of season.Did anybody try using figs preserve or jam.

I couldn't find fresh figs so I used dried figs, that I had soaked and followed others tips and doubled sauce, way too sweet. It wound up over powering the brie instead of complimenting it. If I ever attempt again I will follow recipe exactly.

Great recipe.  I just picked a whole bunch of fresh mission figs off my tree and had friends over tonight.  We had the cheese w/ wine and it was a huge hit!  I wish the sauce would have been thicker but other than that it was wonderful.  It is a great recipe b/c the figs cook down so using the imperfect ones work well.  Delish!  Can't wait to make it again!

I didn't have brie, so I used camembert instead. We had it with toasted baguettes over our Sunday afternoon gathering. Everyone liked it. However, I'll add more water to make the fig more syrupy when I make it again.

It was a good recipe but I couldn't find cheese rounds at Trader Joe's only wedges and used that instead.  My fig mixture was so hot that it melted the brie too much which was still really yummy.

A wonderful way to have Brie. I loved it w/ the figs.  I baked this for 20 minutes so the brie was nice and warm and soft. I doubled everything in the recipe so there was tons of topping to go around.

I also used packaged figs but they were still soft and I cut them into tiny pieces, simmered in dark brown sugar, a little more water, added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg and toasted lmond slivers. Is the hit of my party. Served with those little tiny toasts from Trader Joes. YUM!

i'm a novice at baking brie but this recipe looked so nice i had to give it a try. my local markets only had canned or dried figs so i went with the canned california variety & used the syrup (instead of water) as recommended. my brie wheel only weighed 7 oz. which ended up being the perfect size for the two of us as this was part of our christmas brunch. overall the flavor was pretty good spread over water crackers. i followed another reviewer's suggestion of serving sliced pears with this recipe. i thought the pears somewhat complimented the dish however my boyfriend didn't & felt their taste clashed with the figs. thanks casandra!

I used a fig jam instead of the fresh figs. Unfortunatley the jam wasn't too tasty but the cheese and nuts combined were lovely. Next time I will either use the fresh figs or a jam which I know I like.

Enjoyed this with figs right off my tree.  It is a bit sweet and I think I may try without the vanilla next time to take the sweetness away and the Brie was till hard in the center so I’ll add more time or figure out how to test for softness better - but overall I will make again.

This was so good! I only had an 8oz round of Brie, made the topping as stated but using  3 or 4 extra figs. I used water crackers because I didn't want to alter the flavor of the cheese. We ate the last little bit of leftovers with lunch today and I think I prefer if fresh. Thank you for sharing, I will totally do this again!

I loved this!  So yummy!  It is a bit on the sweet side, but I have absolutely no problem with that.  Appetizer or Dessert (hehe)!

My husband and I have a fig tree on our property and I found a few recipes for figs and this one is a definite keeper!

Fantastic!!! Didnt change anything, except this was ready after 5 min in the oven... Guests asked for recipe naturally :) So easy to make... once you find the fresh figs. I finally found some at Whole Foods.

Used 1/2 c. water, 1/4 c. coconut sugar, appx. 4 c. quartered Celeste figs, dash of vanilla and finely chopped pecans rather than almonds.  Added about 1 inch square grated ginger and zest of one small orange.  YUMMY !!!!!!!  Sharing a cup with the friend who gave me the figs.  Saving rest for wild mushroom brie when hubby returns.

I have made this a couple of times and always a hit. My fiance LOVES this recipe. I used fresh figs when in season and the toasted almonds are a must! I did use dried figs once but it wasn't as good (too chewy).

This was delicious, but a little too sweet for my taste.  I would definitely make this again for a party, as it's a big hit with those who love sweets.

I had fresh figs out of my yard and needed a good recipe.  This is beyond good.  I can see where it would be excellend on a cold winters night, but figs have their own timetable.

I made this yesterday. I had a lot of figs that I need to use up. It was so good. I used water crackers but everyone kept getting the rice crackers off the other dip tray. The recipe didn’t say whole almond or chopped. I chopped mine. This is a keeper.

This was wonderful! I used dried figs and followed the advice of others to use a little more water.  I took it as an appetizer to our dinner group meeting and everyone raved about it - said if I would fix it each time we met I'd be nominated to bring appetizers all the time.

This is a wonderful recipe! Very easy. Who knew that figs could taste so good. I didn't make any modifications to the recipe. I took this to a wine tasting party and it was one of the first things gone!

This was a GREAT combo. I have a large fig bush and wanted a few recipes to use up some of the figs. My friends really enjoyed this. It would even be perfect at the holidays. I left the fig sauce to thicken in the pan and ate it with toasted bread. MMM MMM good.
