Excellent pizza!!  We eat it at least once a week sometimes twice.  I will occasionally grate some feta on top of the mozzarella however, the original recipe needs no improvement. Thanks!!

Last night I made something similar-made my own crust,adding fennel seed and garlic pepper to the dough. Baked it 6 minutes at 475. 
For the topping I mixed spinach, mushrooms, diced tomatoes, green peppers, onions, garlc, pesto and diced chicken. Then added grated provolone, mozzerella, pepperjack anf feta cheese. Baked another 10 minutes-viola!-Kitchen Magician

Easy and tasty...what more could you want?  Using english muffins and sauteed spinach makes a nice variation.

This was pretty good! Next time I'd try some kind of sauce to add a little more flavor, but I will definately try it again. My 4 year old didn't care for it very much, but the adults thought it was pretty good!

Very good.  I sauteed the mushrooms with fresh, pressed garlic before adding to pizza.  I like this so much better than tomato sauce pizza.  Thank you!

FANTASTIC! And, if you add tomatoes--even better. Wonderful flavor, and faster, fresher and better tasting than delivery pizza.

A nice combination of flavors, but go lightly on the sesame oil.  It's really strong!

Super recipe! I've been looking for a good pizza recipe without tomato sauce and this is it. The only changes made were adding salt and pepper, Italian seasoning and garlic powder. I also added extra mozzarella, sliced black olives and sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top. Next time I might add some ricotta cheese for added flavor.
I make two pizzas and they were both inhaled within 10 minutes. If you have someone in your family that cannot eat spicy food or tomatoes, this is a great alternative.

I didn't use oils but make a gourmet pizza like this with the fresh mushrooms and spinach, fresh garlic and lots of RICOTTA. A local pizza place does a "white pizza"  like that and it's unbelievable with that ricotta and (fresh broccoli too).

I thought this was pretty good. For the pre-baked crust I used one off the site and half baked it. I think sesame oil is really strong, so I cut that amount in half. I put the oil mixture on the half baked crust and it seemed really saturated after using half. I added the other toppings and then put the other half on top, because it was looking kind of dry. I thought the spinach and cheese cooked up well, but the mushrooms I thought seemed undercooked. I had even cut them quite a bit thinner than they came. I think I would have liked canned mushrooms with this one. That is what many pizza places use and it doesn't seem to affect the quality. I also think this may have been good with some red onion.

So yummy even my 3 year old daughter ate it. I used wholemeal lebanese bread or pita bread is also good. Then I put it in the oven on high to melt the cheese quickly and give it a bit of burn effect. It is very crispy and taste gourmet like woodfire pizza. I like that the filling are healthy for you. Thanks Allie.

Perfect with the Whole wheat and honey dough  on this site.  Also, sauteed mushrooms and spinach first in olive oil with garlic.  Added some chunks of Mojo rotisserie chicken.

This was super easy and delicious. I used fresh mushrooms saut√©ed in some of the extra oil that I didn't use on the pizza. Next time I will use either Alfredo or pesto sauce under the cheese. However, it is great as written!

this was awesome!!! i loved the oil based sauce, however my husband preferred sauce, so i just made some marina for him to dip it in, and all was forgiven. 

now for the recipe, this is what i did different, however the actual recipe is wonderful by itself. i prebaked my own crust with garlic and mozz cheese, and placed in fridge night before. next night, preheated the oven, used thawed frozen spinach, mozz/montarey jack cheese. then put shredded chicken sauteed with garlic and onions on top. we werent crazy about the mushrooms, so only put it on a small corner just to taste it. added some fresh minced garlic and sprinkled on top of everything else and a dash of oregano and mmmmmmmmmmmmm. it was so yummy and awesome the next day to!!! :D its the first pizza without the fatty taste, and its so good!! not to mention a great source of protien with the chicken! :D

This was good, but I did add some shakes of Italian spices to mine...might be a bit plain without them. We did these on the grill with some friends. I did put some plum tomato slices on mine and really liked the added tomato. My friend put pizza sauce on hers and that was very good too. It is fine without the tomato, but much better with it.

I omitted the sesame oil, and probably reduced the olive oil (didn't measure) and used more spinach.  I added some chopped, thinly sliced pancetta, a few shakes of Italian seasoning and a little grated parmesan.   Delicious!

I thought this was great, easy, comfort food. I did tear the spinach into smaller pieces. I also dipped it in Ranch dressing, really yummy. Could have used roasted garlic or parsley.

This is a really great recipe. I love mushrooms and spinach on pizza. I added some cooked chicken and also if you watch more sauce you can add a pesto pizza sauce or even alfredo sauce. This is good just the way it is though!

Pretty good. Next time I'll add some garlic as others have suggested, and some ground black pepper. Maybe some basil and oregano too. It makes WAY too much oil - 1/3 would be more than enough!!

This pizza is a regular meal at our house, at least once a month we do Allie's pizza for dinner. In fact I just put one in the oven tonight with the addition of a few sliced black olives when I realized I had never reviewed this recipe.  It's GREAT PIZZA for those who like a break from the tired old red sauce/pepperoni pizza once in awhile.  This is really good pizza using Boboli pizza crusts.  Highly recommend trying it "as written".

Oh, wow! I have been trying at least one pizza recipe a week for some time now and this is absolutely my favorite recipe so far! 

The real star of the show is the sesame oil. I used only 1 T. of olive oil whisked with 1 t. sesame oil rather than the full amount - and it was great!

YUMMY! I loved this as I love all mushrooms, but I don't believe I had ever eaten a pizza without some sort of sauce and I was a bit skeptical. But it was great. Will make again.

I've never met a mushroom I didn't like, so the only thing I did was mixed different types of mushrooms.  I had enochi, cremini and shitake.  This was great.  My son didn't like it because he hates mushrooms, but for the rest of the family magnificent...

This pizza was wonderful. I used a defrosted Boboli thin crust pizza that I had in the freezer and brushed only the olive oil over the top; used remainder of suggested ingredients along with fresh garlic, Italian seasoning, ranch dressing, sliced tomatoes, green onion, and sliced salami and roast beef I had for sandwich meat in the fridge. It was a fantastic dinner and there were no leftovers!

I omitted the oil because I wanted to go for a lower fat version and it was a little bland.  Next time I would add more garlic to compensate for the lack of oil.  Great recipe though, and without all the oil, it's pretty healthy!

I used only about a third of the oil mixture on my pizza and I still thought that the sesame oil tasted a little too strong.  My husband and kids seemed to enjoy it more than I did.  Would recommend using less sesame oil.  This recipe would be good with some spicy chicken chunks too.  I probably will try this recipe again but with a little tweaking.

Although I liked the nuttiness the sesame oil added, I found this pizza to be lacking flavour. My husband liked it, and since I love pizza, spinach and mushrooms I will try this again but with the addition of garlic and some seasonings. It's a good start, but I would prefer to add a little more flavour to it. Thanks for the idea!

Easier to call in for a pizza or buy a frozen one.  Not a bad recipe, but why bother when you can buy it?

A very tasty pizza! The sesame oil is the secret ingredient here that really makes a difference. My only additions were some saut√©ed garlic and onion, and chunks of feta on top.

I made this just as the recipe directed except I used garlic and basil oil with the olive oil instead of sesame.  I found there to be way too much oil for the pizza crust though.  Easily can cut the oil amount by 2/3.  My husband & I loved the pizza.  He commented that it was like a gormet pizza from a restaurant.  Will make again.

This was a nice change from tomato sauced pizza .  I used a regular pre- made crust , and found it to be a bit too thick .  Next time I will try a thinner crust .  I used half the oil mixture on the crust ,  and when it came out , brushed more on top .  Sprinkled with a little kosher salt .  Very good .  Thank you for sharing .

Yum !! We used a Boboli Whole Wheat crust and it was an excellent pair! I also omitted the sesame oil and put a nice healthy layer of garlic in with the olive oil. Super easy, quick, and great taste. Our side dish for this was a mixed greens salad with tons of veggies and a raspberry vinnaigrette. Perfect pairing! Great for a "team" dinner where the whole family can help make it!

This was SO GOOD!!!  I made it on a single serving whole wheat pizza crust.  I added a little Italian seasoning on the olive oil/sesame oil and some sliced garlic cloves on the cheese before adding the mushrooms.  I also used fresh mozzarella so I just added it thinly sliced instead of shredding.  Great pizza for mushroom lovers!

Good basic recipe but I had to add a few things to jazz it up. I added fresh spinach, garlic and purple onions. I had a small can of tomato sauce so I stirred in a little oregano and basil and poured it over the veggies before I topped it with the cheese. Overall good you just have to make it your own with the things you like.

A better version of this good basic recipe:  1. use naan bread insetad of pizza crust. this way you can feed however many you like, from 1 to 10!  2. use white truffle oil or garlic olive oil instead of the olive/sesame combo.  3. put some garlic salt and pepper on top.  4. after the 5 or so minutes it takes to finish this, drizzle a tiny bit more truffle oil and a little more garlic salt.   a delicious, simple, quick fix for a light meal!

Brilliant.... I loved it but hubby wants meat on it next time !!! One tip use about 6-8  frozen spinach balls, defrosted and spread on pizza base after oiling. Much easier than trying to keep the leaves in place. Lends itself to loads of adaptations and makes a change from tomato based.

As is, I give this recipe 3 stars. I did use a whole wheat crust. I thought there was too much oil if you use it all, just brush the crust one time well. Also, I thought this would benefit if there were a white sauce with some minced garlic added on the crust before you add the other ingredients.

This recipe will be a favorite at our dinner table from now on!!  I made one pizza exactly by the recipe and the second pizza I added a thin layer of basil pesto over the oil and also a half can of well drained petite diced garlic and olive oil flavored tomatoes.  Both pizzas were very good.  I also used the "Amazing Whole Wheat Pizza Crust" recipe from this website (using 100% whole wheat instead of the mix of white and whole wheat flour).  I have never been so happy with a homemade pizza!!

I am not a huge fan of pizza sauce, so this was a nice change of pace. I did add some sauteed garlic, but other than that followed the recipe as written. I used crimini mushrooms since that's what I had on hand.  Very good flavor. Thanks!

I gave this 5 stars because this is a great foundation for tasty pizza.  However, I used TOMATO SAUCE instead of oil.  It turned out fantastic, a regular dinner I make weekly.  To make it healthier get part skim cheese and use olives instead of mushrooms.  Also, look into making or buying your own dough.

This was excellent , even without the sesame oil, which I forgot to buy. Next time I'll try with that. I started with raw dough and guessed on the "prebaking" . I think I would bake at 375 or maybe 400 rather than 350.

If I am not mistaken, this is a style of pizza from Naples, and it is awesome. No marinara sauce, just good olive oil and screaming fresh vegetables. Do try it.

I used a Bibboli pizza crust, and I decreased the olive oil to 2 tablespoons from 3 tablespoons based on other reviews.  It wasn't too oily at all. In fact, it probably could have had the third tablespoon.  I'm not sure if other people were having a problem based on their crust or cheese (I used 2% cheese). 

The only other change I made was to add some fresh garlic on top.  The flavor was really good, and it was really cheesy.  Even my year-and-a-half old son ate half a piece, and I was happy he ate spinach.

I give this a 4 out of 5 because, even though it was a good pizza, I would have liked it better with tomato sauce.

I ended up putting an alfredo sauce on this as i was worried that it was going to be dry and I loved it like that. If we make it again in the future I think a nice addition would be tomatoes.

So delicious.  The sesame oil added great flavor.  Not overpowering at all.  Used fresh spinach, which really makes a difference.  May add some super thin sliced onions next time, but only out of personal preference.  This recipe needs no help at all.  Perfect just as it is.

Made again after a few months, using my own homemade dough, and love it just as much!  Would just cut the oil a little bit (maybe half), but other than that, this is great and easy to make.

Since I don't like pizza sauce, this is perfect.  I do, however, add some peeled, seeded & diced tomato to this. It is great.

In Italy, pizza is a very simple dish, not the huge pizza we have here that sometimes have a pound or more of cheese and meats on them. They might have a small amount of tomato sauce spread over the crust or sometimes they make a white pizza. I like the simplicity of this recipe. Just the flavors of spinach, oil, and mushrooms. I'm allergic to sesame, so just use all olive oil on it. If you want a little seasoning, add some salt and pepper, but not so much that it tastes salty. The idea is to let the ingredients shine.

This pizza was so delicious!  My husband loved it and even my picky toddler ate it, saying "mmmmmm" the whole time.  The sesame oil really gives it a kick.  I used a Boboli whole wheat crust, and the only thing I added to the recipe was a light sprinkle of garlic powder under the cheese.  It was divine.

Not bad for a healthy pizza! i used a whole wheat crust and part-skim mozz. cheese to make it even healthier. It was a little bland and I think next time I might add some pesto to the crust before I put the cheese on or maybe just a little bit of sauce

I liked the idea of a no-tomato-sauce pizza for a change, the combination of mushrooms and spinach (I love both!) and was excited to see what the sesame oil would do to the flavours. But the end result was only mediocre, I'm sorry to say. When I was putting it all together I noticed that there's nothing going on there in terms of spices and herbs, so I sprinkled it with garlic powder, because in my head spinach and garlic go hand in hand. Still, it came out fairly bland and dry. Not bad really, just nothing to rave about either. There's another one of these sitting in my fridge to be baked for dinner. Before it goes in, I'll be sure to add more garlic powder, SALT&PEPPER and a few herbs. Hope that makes it into a 4-star meal.

This was SOOO good!  Fresh mushrooms and fresh spinach really made this the best.  You could use frozen chopped spinach and canned mushrooms as well if you always want to have ingredients on hand to make this.  Recipe says to cook at 350 for 8-10 minutes, but thicker crust pizza will take about 20-25 on that temp.  I followed the 450 for 8-10 minutes that was on the pizza bread I bought and it came out crisp around the edges and soft in the middle just how I like it.

So yummy! I thought the sesame oil added great taste! I sauteed the spinach and mushrooms in olive oil with some garlic first, then put that on the crust. On top of the cheese I added a few extra chopped veggies from what I had fresh on hand. You can adjust and add whatever toppings you like.

It gets 5 stars, but I added two things otherwise it's probably be a 4-star. I made some fresh tomato from the garden earlier this week, so I spread some of that on before the mushrooms and cheese. Also, just mozzarella would be awfully dull alone on a pizza, so I would HIGHLY recommend adding some more of another type like gruyere or fontina. I used what I had in the fridge, which was some Cabot Tomato & Basil cheese. It rocked!

I've made this twice; once with ricotta and once as the recipe is written (minus the sesame oil).  It was a bit boring; I was expecting more since the reviews were so high.  I might try again, but saut√© the spinach with the mushrooms and garlic before.

This was awesome and so quick. I was looking for a quick Lenten recipe on a Friday. I only added black olives, parmesan, and Italian seasoning. I also didn't have sesame oil. Didn't miss it. Thanks for a great meatless recipe.

I liked this very much.  I sauteed the mushrooms first, otherwise they let out too much water into the pizza and make it soggy.  Instead of sesame oil I lightly sauteed some crushed garlic in the olive oil then spread it on the crust.  Very good.

Easy to throw together and decent results, yet for the cost of the ingredients it's worth going out for this kind of pizza.

added red sauce bc I feel like pizza isn't pizza without red sauce, also made my own crust, I think next time I'd used less mushrooms and used a prebought crust as suggested.

Fantastic!  So easy and fast, and though I was skeptical of the "no sauce" idea, it was fabulous.  I didn't use sesame oil b/y my husband is alergic to it, but what I noticed is that the flavor of the oil replaces the sauce flavor I'm used to.  I used a good quality olive oil.  I imagine w/ the sesame it would've been even better. One word of warning: the crust I bought had holes poked through it, so the oil of course soaked through to the counter...put your crust on a baking sheet first.  I followed the baking directions on the crust package, which were a bit different in time and temp than this recipe, but I figured I wanted my crust done right.  (The crust was a 2 pack, so this was the adult pizza and I made a cheese for the kids.) I also used canned mushrooms b/c it's all I had, and I added 1/2 of a diced fresh tomato.  Awesome!  This will become a regular on our need-dinner-quick-nights.

Way too much oil! It was so oily and greasy and yucky. I sauteed the mushrooms in sesame oil and used the entire olive oil on the crust and we had to throw it away. Am goin back to the store and gonna try again. Less oil, more garlic plus I added tomoatoes. The wheat crust is ok but kinda bland. Do not use all that oil. It looked so pretty but take my advice, less is more.

This is a very simple, light and delicious recipe. I had to substitute the olive oil with Wesson 'Best Blend' oil because that's all I had. Still good but next time I WILL have olive oil!

This is a good start to a great pizza, but ALOT needs to be added for flavor.  The feta on top is a great addition, and crushed red pepper with sauteed fresh garlic in an alfredo sauce I had on hand made a great base.  I then added the spinach, mushrooms, pizza cheese, artichoke hearts, tomato, and broccoli to boost the flavor.  Keep in mind this calls for an 8-inch pizza, but you really need a 12-inch.

THought it was pretty good.  Took the suggestion of others and sauteed the spinach with garlic and then did the same with the mushrooms.  I added tomato slices with the spinach layer and then I put feta on top of the mozzarella.  I thought it was good, but overall not sure that we are fans of spinach on our pizza.  Also, I did use shitake mushrooms, which were great.

I would suggest adding some cheese before spinach, otherwise the toppings are sliding off with the very first bite.

Sesame oil on pizza? Yuck!  No salt, pepper, spices of any kind... gobs of mozzerella... Zero flavor. What are all the high rating folks used to eating?  This is simply awful!

With the changes I made per others suggestions, the soup was great and very healthy.
