This is a great bread.  The only thing I would do differently is add more apples and don't cut them too small. Mine was lacking in apple chunks. I cut them way to small.

Didn't find it anything special. Just a sweet bread. The topping is messy as it doesn't adhere to the dough. The moment you touch the bread, a shower of topping ends of all over the table and the floor.

This bread is absolutely wonderful! The apple, cinnamon and chocolate flavors are perfectly matched. I made this exactly as the recipe called for, I wouldn't change a thing. This is a keeper and will be given as gifts for Christmas. Thanks,
Corwynn!

This was a great bread. I used half spelt flour, carob chips instead of semi-sweet, and almonds instead of walnuts. I will definitely make this again.

I really enjoyed this one...  Very good for the fall & winter seasons...  Goes good with a glass of warm apple cider...  I am not a "nut" fan so I made mine without and just loved it...  I also completely forgot about the crumb topping and it turned out just fine...  Next time I'll be sure to include that part of the recipe as I'm sure it would only make it better!  This one will be a sure bet around the holidays...

I have this recipe already in a cookbook I own, its a keeper for sure, I make about 4 loaves each time I make it, I keep one out for breakfast or a midmorning snack, wrap two up for the freezer and give 1 away to a friend, I like adding chopped pecans or walnuts and dried cranburys too,sweet, moist, simply excellent.

I am sitting here eating this bread as I write. We made it this afternoon and it's quite good. The combination of the soft apples and crunchy nuts is really great, plus ANYTHING with chocolate is great to me LOL!! Great way to use up that last apple or two that the kids won't eat because it has a little brown spot. I made a double batch and it made 3 loaves in 8 by 4 inch loaf pans. Gotta get some in the freezer before we eat it all!!

I make a lot of breads, but my husband REALLY liked this one.  I used mini chocolate chips because they were what I had on hand, and it turned out fab.

very good ... granny smith apples lend a nice tartness ... VERY sweet with the topping, i usually leave it off. i have also tried this with cocoa powder instead of chips ... in which case i add a little apple sauce to the batter for moisture and to strengthen the apple flavor against the cocoa powder.

I loved this recipe!!..although I didn't like the topping.  It didn't seem to go with the bread so I made my own:
1/4 cup butter, softened 
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 
1/2 cup brown sugar 
Mix and microwave until the butter is melted and then I drizzled it on top of the bread...oh my goodness...AMAZING!!..p.s.. also added more apples and choco chips than called for...so good.

I found the bread to be pretty dry, and in need of more apple chunks and choco.chips...
so for my second bread, i added about a half cup of vanilla yogurt, an extra half cup of apples, and a bit more chocolate then called for.
It turned out great! wonderful and addictive, and the smells coming out of the oven were heavenly!

This was good but not great.  For us, the apples and chocolate together just didn't do it.  Very buttery and moist, though.

i agree with one of the reviewers that said to add more than the called for two cups of apples.  it looked like alot when i cut them up, but the end result -- add a full cup more it wont be too much. othewise a nice breakfast bread.

This is a five star recipe.  It turned out great.  I used a Granny Smith apple and pecans instead of walnuts.  The rest was done to a "t".  Fantastic!

I made some changes: I substituted half the flour with wheat flour, added some oats and a sprinkle of flax meal, substituted 1/4 apple sauce for 1/4 margarine, and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/8 mollasses instead of white sugar. I'm sure I added a little bit more of the spices than called for.  I also added more apples and nuts cause I like "stuff". It came out good, but it lacked a little flavor. I think I might not skimp as much on the sugar next time.

Baking is definitely not my strong point but this came out absolutely amazing! I made it with half margarine/half butter, and half walnuts/half pecans. My apples of choice were Granny Smith and Pink Lady. We ate half a loaf with a couple of pots of coffee - so good! I'll definitely be making this again.

This was really good.  I brought it to a board meeting and it was a huge hit.  I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted sour cream instead.  I also used real butter instead of margarine.

This recipe is delicious. I made a few changes, I used Granny Smith apples, I used caramel chocolate swirl chips instead of semi sweet chips and pecans instead of walnuts to make Gourmet Caramel Apple Bread, like those gourmet caramel apples you get that are covered in caramel and chocolate and pecans.  It was delicious. It quickly disappeared at a family pot luck get together.

I omitted nuts inside the cake (not enough) and used white chocolate chips. Also used light brown sugar instead of white (ran out) and made up my own buttermilk (2 tbsp reg. milk + dash of vinegar). Didn't add all the flour as the batter was already thick looking (prob. abt 3-4 tbsp flour left). Results: wonderful smell while baking (my mother knew smethng was in the oven even when she was at the door) and still smelled great the next day each time I walk past it.  Half a loaf disappeared within 1/2hr out of oven.  Great recipe, moist and tender.  Will make again, with nuts cuz i think it'll complement the "mushy" apple.

Fantastic!  Everyone loved it, even though most initial reactions were "apples... and chocolate?"  All 8 people who tried the bread said it was incredible.  Can't get any better than that!

When I made the dough it seemed more like cookie dough in thickness.  It was so stiff I had to press it into the pan.  It came out the same way...very dense.   It tastes OK, but I wouldn't make it again.

Made this recipe with only one change, added more apples, as suggested. I thought it was OK, not a show stopper. Won't make again.

Excellent. Easy to make and very tasty. I used butter instead of margarine, no problem.

This. Bread. Is. Incredible.  I didn't have walnuts or chocolate chips, but it still came out delicious.  Tried it for the first time today, currently making loaves 3 and 4.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!!

This recipe is perfect. A lovely moist loaf. I did not have buttermilk and also substituted yogurt, it worked perfectly.  Just the right sweetness!

LOVED THIS! Per other comments, I left off the topping. I like to toast my quick breads in the toaster oven before snacking, and I could imagine that topping ending up all over. I added more apple, because I had apples that needed to be eaten. I added more chocolate chips, because chocolate chips! I used sour cream, because I didn't have buttermilk. Turned out delicious! I think I will try using brown sugar next time, because I prefer it. And, there will definitely be a next time and many more next times.

I found this to be just OK. I love a good apple bread, and I added extra apples as others suggested, but it still came out kind of dry and bland. Needs more spice in my opinion. My kids liked it. But I'm not in a hurry to make it again.

This was delicious...sweet and tart and simple!  Im not a big fan of sweet breads or sweets for that matter, but this was just right!  I took one reviewers advice and added a little more apple than the recipe asked for...i figured, what could it hurt :)  I also didnt add the entire amount of sprinkled topping...all that sugar just seemed like too much, though im sure folks with a sweet tooth would disagree.  Otherwise, i followed it to the letter, and it was great.  I usually make fudge for everyone for Christmas, but im thinking of making this bread instead....simple, inexpensive, and tasty!  I will make this often, and i plan to make it as a gift for friends for any occasion.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!
edited to add:  i didnt have any buttermilk today and didnt feel like making the "buttermilk from milk recipe" just for two tablespoons, so instead i added 2 Tablespoons of applesauce and it made the bread super moist.  :)
p.s. we are at 7200 feet and it cooked up nicely at the full 60 minutes.

This bread turned out delicious! I love the cinnamon sugar topping which turned into a nice delicate sugary crust. I didn't have buttermilk, so substituted milk with a little lemon juice which worked out well. I used 2/3 C. each of the walnuts and chocolate chips. Yum! Will definitely be making again soon.

My husband gave this bread a five, which is always a good sign!  I doubled the apples and chocolate chips and left out the nuts (due to allergies).  I can't wait to try this bread myself...(I have a loaf in the freezer!).

I am very surprised at the high ratings on this recipe. While the end result was good, I had to tweak the ingredients severely to achieve it. This batter was incerdibly DRY. Instead of butter I used half apple butter and half oil, but had to add another 1/2 cup of apple butter. I also increased the milk to 1/4 cup. Only after this was it workable. I also added another cup of apples into the ending batter.

I have to agree that this bread is a little plain and that the topping is messy, but I changed the recipe some so I can't complain much.
I left out the nuts (didn't have any) and was looking for something to fix a chocolate craving, so I added a tablespoon and a half of cocoa powder (and 3 oz. applesauce to compensate) to the mix. Don't do this guys, you couldn't taste it, and I think it might have competed with the spices. The spices of the batter and also the texture and rise of the cake WERE very good and yummy. I would suggest adding more chocolate chips or at least mini ones, but that depends on what you want.

I thought it was a little too sweet yet plain, needed something, don't know what. If I made it again, I'd cut the sugar and increase the choc chips, or at least use a really strong apple like a Granny Smith for that flavor. And I wouldn't bother with the sugar topping. Maybe a touch of caramel would be good in this cake, too.

I'm giving this a 4 because my mom and husband liked it, although I did not.  I thought it was bland, but they said they enjoyed the flavor of the chocolate and apples together.  Maybe I just didn't use a tart enough apple for my own taste!

This smelled wonderful while baking, but didn't seem to have much flavor.  I was hoping for more.  We threw out much of the loaf after nobody touched it for several days.  I tried the recipe because I had apples and buttermilk that needed to be used.  I will stick with my regular quick bread recipes in the future.  It wasn't worth the trouble.
