I would however make a few changes next time I make this.... somethings to consider when you make it.  I will use 1/2-1 tsp of cayenne-  2 full tsp is FAR over powering, even for my preference being for on the hot side.  I would also add ~1/4-1/2 cup of water during the cooking process.... I think it will help steam the veggies a bit (I like them a bit softer), and once it evaporates off will leave a nice consistency to the sauce.  As it was, I was afraid that the sauce was burning.  I would also sprinkle dish with chopped peanuts and more onion for some crunch.  Awesome recipe... will be using again.  Carrots were awesome in this by the way... :)

This was amazing!  My husband was unsure of tofu, I think  he had three servings. I made a few changes, cut back the cayenne to 1/2 tsp, and I did not have chili paste so I used chili sauce. After I made the sauce mixture I put the diced tofu in it marinate while I chopped up  other veggies. This is a must make!

Really good recipe.  However, I did skip the cayenne pepper.

Too hot!  Even with half the cayenne it was still way too hot.  I recommend 1/2 tsp or less for a spicy taste. (which is 1/4 of what the recipe calls for).   Also, add some vegetable broth or it will burn, even with high end non stick cookware.  Other that that, it is really good.  You could add some bamboo shoots and thinly sliced carrots.

This was quite spicy as written. My garlic chili sauce is potent, so I cut that way back the second time I made this, and I cut back on the cayenne.

There was not enough liquid in this recipe so the spices burnt. Also, we did not enjoy the flavor.

I made this as directed, but made my fianc√© chicken and this was SO delicious! Next time I will try adding other veggies like broccoli and carrots. Super easy and so good!

I used 1/2 the cayenne and it was still pretty spicy. Very good.

It is spicy!!!!  Next time I'll adjust- I like spicy but it was actually too spicy for me.  I also don't care for tofu so I omitted it.  I will make this again only with less spice!

Fantastic! I used fresh cayenne peppers. I added some "spiralized" carrots, squash and green zucchini. I used Sriracha and it really goes well in this dish. Thank you for the recipe.

Very spicy.  Needs something to cool the pepper down.  Next time may spend more time trying to sweetin it a bit.
