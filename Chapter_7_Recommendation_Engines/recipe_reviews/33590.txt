I cut this in half for two of us, and used half wild rice and half brown rice, subbed in slivered almonds for the water chestnuts (don't like w.c.'s), and left out the mushrooms (didn't have any) and salt (salt in butter and in low-sodium broth).  This was delicious, though a little over the top on the butter; would cut that in 1/2 next time.  I cooked the rices in the broth on the stovetop for 45 minutes, then transferred it to a small covered baking dish, with the rest of the ingredients I used, and baked for another 30 minutes.  Probably could have used another 15 minutes on the wild rice.  We enjoyed it though; it was a very nice accompaniment to the Grilled Pork Chops with Balsamic Carmelized Onions, and Pan Fried Asparagus we had tonight.  Thank you, Corwynn!

I had to cook this dish a lot longer than anticipated. I doubled the bake time ad still added a few more minutes. It was a good side dish, but nothing special- except to us wild rice lovers.

My family loved this recipe.  However, you need to reduce the chicken broth to 2 cups  NOT  2 cans.

Just tried this for the first time.   I enjoyed the wild rice/mushroom/water chestnut combo, but it lacked a little flavor in my book.   As with the other reviews, I found it took much longer to cook and 29 oz. of chicken stock was too much. I'd cut that back to at least 24 oz.  I will also cut back on the butter next time and substitute in some Z-Trim which I shoud have done this time reading the one review.   What I did when all was said and done and I wanted more flavor was sprinkle on some parmesan cheese.  That made it really tasty, I thought.  I'll bake some in next time and make the other adjustments mentioned.

I used the ingredients listed but changed the cooking routine cuz of time constraints. I cooked the wild rice (40 minutes) in chicken broth with butter and salt one afternoon. The next day, in a deep 12" fry pan, I sauteed the onion, mushrooms and water chestnuts in butter until soft, stirred in the cooked rice and heated through. I then put it in a casserole dish, into a 375 degree F oven for 30 minutes. I needed to add a bit more liquid at this point. This was a BIG hit at the potluck dinner!!!

I was looking for a way to use leftover already cooked wild rice when I found this recipe.  I sauted the onions & mushrooms (portabello) and then added the wild rice (cooked with veg. broth) & water chestnuts and heated through.  So my method was stovetop from start to finish...very quick & easy since the rice was cooked.  I really liked this dish and will definitely make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Based on the other reviews, I put in 29 oz of chicken broth, but added extra 1/4 cup of rice.  I used Pecans instead of water chestnuts and No mushrooms, only carmelized onions.  I baked for 1 1/2 hours in total.  My family really liked it and they are very picky.

I did alter it and make it into a dinner. Substitute DRIED PORCHINI MUSHROOMS and simmer them in the broth (2 Cups) at the beginning while saut√©ing the onion.  Mix all ingredients at the beginning.  Bake 45 minutes. Top with BONELESS CHICKEN BREASTS. Cover and Bake 45 minutes more.  Option: Sprinkle with SHREDDED PARMESAN and Brown at the end.  Let stand covered 15 minutes before serving.  We aren't wild rice connoisseurs but we used LUNDBERG WILD BLEND which is very rich.  I think the button mushrooms would have been overwhelmed.

This is a good recipe, however, the cooking times are based on real wild rice (harvested in lakes). Commercially grown, or paddy wild rice, takes more than twice as long to cook. Wild rice is varying shades of dull grey/brown. Commercial wild rice is nearly black & shiny.

It took the full 90 minutes to cook, but this recipe was totally worth it.  Great taste, I will definitely make again.

I was actually surprised by how much I liked this! I thought it might be blandish and need tweaking, but I ended up leaving it just as it was. I used a blend of wild rice, barley, brown rice and whatever-else that I bought in the bulk section of the grocery store and didn't really know what to do with. The only thing I changed about this recipe is to make the whole dang thing in a dutch oven and not mess up 3 pans (but I did end up messing up 2 because I pressed it into a ramekin to mold it for serving). Thanks for the recipe!.

Easy to make, and yes be patient for the cooking time. I didn't have the water chestnuts but next time I will def. add them as I am sure they taste wonderful in this. I finely chopped my MR's as I have someone in house who doesn't like MR's but didn't know they were in there.

Yummy side dish with a nutty flavor and crunch. I think it's missing something though, but not sure what, perhaps more than one type of rice or an additional veggie.

Easy to prepare, and I halved the recipe, which made 4 sizeable portions. Would recommend cutting large mushroom slices in half. I used slivered almonds per another's suggestion, and indeed found that the cook time was nearly 15 minutes longer to get the water to absorb.

Will make this again.

Pretty good recipe.  Definitely takes longer than 30 minutes.  At LEAST an hour.  I also felt like it needed "something" so I added some Parmesan cheese to the top for the last few minutes of baking.

I have made this several times, and the only thing I do a bit differently is use a butter spread (like Smart Balance Lite) instead of honest-to-goodness butter. It's always a huge hit.

This was really good but,like other reviewers, I had to cook it a lot longer than the recipe calls for.  I think it was at least an hour more!  But it was worth the wait! Thanks

Loved it and will be making again! I gave it 4 instead of 5 because I did use only 2 cups of chicken broth and didn't think it needed any more. Only using 2 cups made the timing and everything perfect. I only used 2 because of some of the other reviews and when I looked at the instructions for making the wild rice, it suggested using something like 1 & 3/4 cups water per cup of rice. The rice I used was good quality. Also, I thought the water chestnuts a were great idea! I served this with artichoke chicken.

As a main dish, I added 2 cups of chopped chicken.  I also added the seasoning mix that came with my wild rice instead of the salt, and it had a great flavor.  I would cut back on the broth too, especially if you're short on time to cook.  Very tasty recipe with good texture!

This ended up fabulous. I had to take it out of the oven and cook for at least another 20minutes on the stove to get the water to absorb but it was worth it. I used canned mushrooms and I think that is why it was watery at first.  served it with chicken Marsala.

I used this recipe as a base for what I made.  I cooked on the stovetop and not in the oven.  I also used boxed mix wild rice that had some seasonings added.  I liked it very much.

I leave out the mushrooms and butter and add chicken breasts.  Usually I cook 3-4 breasts in water, when done dump wild rice in (or long grain and wild rice), salt and pepper.  Depending on how much broth you have, this can be a great soup or casserole.  I chop scallions and sprinkle on top before serving.  I also steam broccoli florets and mix with the leftovers...yummy and nourishing.

This was pretty good. I think if I make this again, I will reduce the amount of butter, as it did seem a bit greasy to me. The only thing that I did differently was to add about a 1/4 cup of white rice to the wild rice 30 minutes into the baking process. Otherwise, it was worth a 4 star rating.

I really really liked this.  Wonderful buttery flavor.  I chopped my water chestnuts (liked that addition) and used just over 2 C broth.  Make sure you caramalize your  onions because that is where so much of the flavor comes from.  I had no issues with this not cooking in the 60 min. Will definitely make this one again.

Not bad but not really very different. Left out the water chestnuts as I didn't have any. Went pretty well with a stuffed chicken dish.

Doubled the recipe but not the butter and salt.  Used the butter in the oven dish, but saut√©ed onions and mushrooms in olive oil.  Timing for me was exactly as stated.  30 min  before the veggies are added and 30 min after.  Served with a turkey breast.  Skipped the chestnuts since I didn't have them.   Used  Lundberg Wild Rice Blend.  Everyone loved it.  Never had made rice in the oven before.  Was great to be able to just stick it in there for the last hour turkey was baking.  Was ready before turkey but was fine sitting out covered for a while.  Easy, moist and delicious!
