3.2.19  I think what I missed most in this was the Greek yogurt that you find in so many overnight oatmeal recipes.  There was quite a bit of milk in the bowl this morning, although the oats were plenty tender.   I did end up spooning some of the milk off, but I liked the delicate cinnamon flavor which often can be overpowering.  This was OK and I like the fact that itâ€™s low calorie, but I think my personal preference still includes the yogurt which makes the oatmeal creamier.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
