I am sorry SuperRebbetzin but I did not care for your recipe. I went to a lot of trouble to get the ingredients, spent quite a while cutting everything up and sorting and washing the beans. The result after cooking it last night was a dry, strange-tasting, brownish-black, gluey mixture. I am an experienced cook and followed you recipe exactly. Is there a mistake in the recipe? I have to mark a star but I wouldn't even give it one star.

perhaps the previous reviewer is just unfamiliar with cholent but cholent generally does turn brown and lose some of its distinct form. i sometimes like to add a pareve kishka to the recipe and then break it up and stir it in right before i serve

I based a vegetarian cholent off this recipe and it was a big hit. However, I omitted the sweet potatoes and added a little barley and rice to thicken it up. I think I've found a new fav. shabbos cholent recipe...

This is a kind of comfort food!  I loved the combination of the beans, barley, potatoes and onions!  I used pinto beans instead of the kidney beans, changed the ketchup and BBQ sauce to be tomato sauce, and omitted the brown sugar.  I didn't cook this all day, but cooked the beans and barley, then added the  rest of the ingredients; when the liquid had cooked in, the flavors had combined nicely!  I found  that the inventor of the Crock Potâ„¢ developed that with memories of his mother telling his grandmother's stories about cholent cooking all day, so I had to find out what cholent was! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

You gotta love cholent in the first place, but this is a great and easy recipe. I had chick peas and not white beans so I made that change. I also added a uncooked eggs in the shell to lay on top of the cholent mixture so they cook with the cholent. When done they come out a delicious brown inside and out and make a nice addition to your Shabbat lunch.

It was great! we were thrilled to find this recipe and try it out! My husband really liked it and the kids did too. I put it in the crockpot mid-friday afternoon and had for lunch on saturday. It was great, texture was good and flavor delicious.  I wasnt able to get the beets before making it, but am looking forward to trying it with some!

Perhaps it was the barbecue sauce (Jack Daniels Original), but this was a genuine disappointment... not a recipe that I ever plan to make again.

This came out fantastic!  I added a little more potatoes and some more water to even it out.  It came out just right and a delicious cholent!
Thank you so much for making my Shabbos so yummy!

This was fantastic! I did cut back on a few things since it seemed like overkill. I used a bit less ketchup, less salt, half the pepper  (and it was still a little spicy, but a good amount). The final result was great. Thanks!
