This is great! And so simple. I didn't have any walnuts, so I put 1/4 cup dry minced onion and some garlic powder in the cheese ball. About 15 minutes before serving, I took cheese out of frig to warm slightly. At serving time I pressed finely crushed corn tortilla chip crumbs onto the top and sides. It was a big hit at a church pitch-in.
