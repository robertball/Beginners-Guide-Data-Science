Very good!  I was quite pleased with how good these are!  I used chicken in the slow cooker cooked in chicken broth.  These turned out great! I even used whole wheat tortillas!  good little recipe!  thanks!

This was delicious! I will be making this again in the near future. I used Lawry’s fajita seasoning when cooking the chicken. This recipe is very flavorful.

So good! I made these using frozen fajita chicken already seasoned and only used the cream of chicken, tomatoes and green onions and it was wonderful. My boyfriend ate three! I’d say it was a success!

I have made this three times for my family. I really like it but they are just kinda meh about it. I think they would like it better if the tortillas got a little crispier. I haven't figured out how to do that yet.

Great recipe for a busy weeknight.  I used a store-bought rotisserie chicken, took all the meat off the bones, and cut it into fairly small chunks (made a bone broth with the skin and bones in the slow cooker too for another day).  I own those wonderful scalloped tortilla bowls so I used those to bake these in.  In lieu of the picante sauce, which I didn't have, I made the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce from allrecipes website. ( I used a can of Rotel Tomatoes with Chilies and tomato sauce in the enchilada sauce, so I cut down a bit on the water.)  I also used cheddar cheese instead of the Monterey Jack cheese since that is what I had on hand.  I served the taco bowls with lettuce, chopped tomatoes, sour cream, and extra cheese on the side for everyone to fix their enchilada bowl their own way.  My family loved this.  It's my step-son's new favorite dish.

I shredded the chicken and added a little extra salsa.  It was yummy and my kids loved it!  Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe to the exact and also kicked it up a bit by adding salsa on the top prior to cheese as well as more chilli powder and chopped jalapenos
