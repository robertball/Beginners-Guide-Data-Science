I made this last weekend, served it in a sourdough bread bowl and served it with sliced baguette.  It was the hit of the party!  I couldn't believe the crowd around it, at one point, guests got spoons and just ate globs of it.  One thing is that it is quite greasy.  There were pools of oil on the dip when I pulled it out of the oven and it seemed to separate further as it cooled.  I might try it with some spinach next time to cut the fat and richness.

This is the best artichoke dip for my taste as some of the ones with peppers are too hot.  I do add lots more garlic (6-8 cloves) and vary the cheese variety.  I just lay a paper towel on top when it comes out of the oven to soak up the grease.  Easy and tasty!!

I normally have my own recipe for artichoke dip,but I wanted to try something different.Although it smelled wonderful baking,it was a little too runny and oily for my taste.I even added spinach for color,but it looked unappealing,and disappointingly not as good as my own dip*LOL* sorry!

My husband didn't like the mayo so much.  So I did again with sour cream and he loved it, everyone one else did too.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  A friend suggested trying Romano cheese the second time to vary the taste.  Either way it is a success.

My friend made this dip for Thanksgiving and we all loved it. It was gone before all the appetizers were even set out! Try adding extra cheese- she put in mozzarella.

This recipe is a big hit!  All the ingredients can be kept on hand so you can
put it together at a moments notice.  It doesn't last long.

This dip was pretty good. I think it would benefit from some sour cream or cream cheese. I added lots of garlic. It was a little too greasy but still good.

IMO the single biggest problem with this recipe is that it’s like chopped artichokes swimming in oil.  I kept dabbing the dip with paper towels, it kept reducing in size, but as you dipped, it was just more liquid.  The taste is good, it has a nice tang, but we just couldn’t deal with all of the floating oil.  I’d give this a 4 for taste, but a 1 for eye appeal, so overall, I’m giving it a 3.  Sorry, this one just didn’t work for us, and I’m going back to my SIL’s recipe, which also is tastier and breaks down much better nutritionally.

This dip was great! I made it to take to a gathering with a lot of families figuring that it would be nice for the adults.  The kids tried it before they knew that it had artichokes in it (the horror!!).  It was hit and the doubled recipe was gone! The dip was really fast and easy to make. But, save this one for the days when you're ready to throw your diet out the window. It's worth it though!

I have to agree with some others who said the result is too greasy. I blotted the puddle on top 5 times with layered paper towels which seemed to help but as the dip was scooped out another puddle formed in the bottom. The flavor was good but I won’t make this one again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  I added an extra jar of artichoke hearts which made it more artichoke then mayonnaise tasting.  I also served it with Stacy's pita chips which was less filing then bread.

I used less mayo and added some chopped olives. It was great!! I also made pita chips to go with it and it was gone in 5 mins!!
