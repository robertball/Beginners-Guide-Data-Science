What a fun recipe! This turned out really good and is one I would definitely make again. The rich buttery flavor comes through and the cinnamon did not overpower. It reminded me of that famous cereal. I had more than half of the sugar/cinnamon left over so I'd reduce that next time. For now, it just gives me an excuse to go get another tube of crescent roll dough and make another batch!

I flipped mine over with a minute left and both sides turned out delicious!
