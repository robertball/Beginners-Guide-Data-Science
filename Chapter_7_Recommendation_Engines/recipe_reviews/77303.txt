My family and I are very picky about our cheesecake. Everyone I have made this cheesecake for has raved about it. It has now become the preferred choice for my friends and families holiday desert and birthday cake.

I use a packaged deep-dish crust, then use only fresh and organic ingredients. Fresh blueberry and raspberry with either white or milk chocolate is chosen by the person for whom I make it.

I leave out the lemon juice, and use 2   (8* oz) pkgs of cream cheese. (I believe the recipe has a typo that claims (3 oz) pkgs., and for milk choc toppings I use 1 oz white and 1 oz choc baking squares.

I have a small wire baking rack that a put the cheesecake on in a foil lined cookiesheet. After the 30-35 minutes, when the center is still a bit uncooked (it appears moist and wiggly), I turn off the oven and keep the door shut. I let it cool in there for about 2 hrs. this allows it to finish cooking and cooling without cracking.

I then make the topping and pour it in the middle of the cheesecake. Without touching the topping, I tip and roll the pan around letting it run to the edges of the crust as I turn, and it covers the top smoothly.

Refig. for at least 3 hrs, but overnight is best. The cake will be eatable for about 3 days, if kept in the fridge.

I made this for Valentine's day, and it was great!  I used fresh raspberries, baked it in an 8 in. springform pan, and made my own crust with graham cracker crumbs, butter, and a little sugar.  The chocolate glaze makes it so yummy and pretty!  The only suggestion I have is to make a smaller cake or take the leftovers to work, because if it sits in the fridge more than 2-3 days, the crust gets really soggy from the berries.

OMG!!!  Absolutly Wicked!  The best dessert I have ever made.  A small dolup of whipped cream (it doesn't need it, but it looks pretty) on each slice with one fresh rasberry and a sprig of mint on top make for a beautiful presentation to your guests.  I will continue to make year after year to serve after Thanksgiving.

This cheesecake is heavenly. Much of it is gone already, and I just made it last night! I only put about 1 tbsp of lemon juice in, because it tasted tart enough to me without the rest. Also, maybe I used more raspberries than was called for (more or less, I lined the bottom of the pie place with them), but I had entirely too much batter. That's a good thing though, I'll have enough to make another one! 

I made more of the chocolate sauce than was called for, and covered the surface of the cooled cake with, and then topped it with fresh raspberries. (I also used fresh raspberries for the cake part, too, and they turned out wonderful.) 

By the way, you really shouldn't mix fruit in with the batter of the cheesecake, because they tend to get lost in the mix. It's best to put them in a layer (as in this recipe) so that they are set apart.

Clearly an error in the ingredients list.  The cream cheese quantity should be 2 EIGHT OZ  rather than the listed 3 ounce.

I found the cake to be  of excellent quality, flavor and texture top notch.  The chocolate layer on the top adds that little extra something missing in so many cheesecake recipes. 

Using frozen raspberries is not a good idea as they leave soggy spots in the crust.  Mine were thawed and quite dry but still left the spots.  Fresh ones would be better suited, but hard to find at this time of year.  The whipped cream and raspberry garnish makes a great visual impact.  Our group loved this dessert.

Made this for dessert after Easter dinner.  It was pretty good, nice flavour, I think everyone enjoyed it, but in my opinion definitley use FRESH raspberries!!  I used frozen and they made the bottom of the crust kind of mushy.  Might make again.

First, the recipe is correct in calling for 2 3-oz packages cream cheese.  I originally found this recipe in an old cookbook, so I imagine cream cheese used to come in much smaller packages.  The first time I made it, though, I misread and used 2 8-oz packages, and it turned out fine but a little crumbly (and SO much higher in Calories!!!).  My family & I like it much better with what the recipe actually calls for.  :)  
Ok, now that that's out of the way, this cheesecake is AMAZING!  It's even better when you use a chocolate graham cracker crust, and EVEN better if you use an oreo crumb crust!  I'm trying it tomorrow with strawberries instead of raspberries (just what I have on hand); I'm sure it will still be delicious.

I made this last night and it looked gorgeous.Instead of putting the fruit on the base i made a sauce with it (10 oz of fruit, 3 tbs of sugar and 3 tbs of cornflour and 1/2 cup of water boiled for 5 mins) and dropped the fruit in layers through the mixture.I didnt want the base to go soggy.Unfortunately the base wasnt crisp as i hoped it would be, so nxt time i will bake it for 10 min before adding the mixture.Besides that the rest of it tastes lovely.Also used fresh straberries instead as thats all i could buy.

This has become a regular dish in our house. (not good for the waist line but great for the taste buds!)
I love it.
I used way too much chocolate the first time and it was overpowering... but that was my fault! hehe

This cheesecake was wonderful, truely delicious.  I hadnt made cheesecake much before but this one was really easy and seems to be becoming a regular feature of my cooking habits.  Wasn't sure about the chocolate sauce tho, possibly as I made it with dark chocolate which had a rather overpowering flavour.

I have been making this cheesecake for many years and am in grave danger if I even hint that I might not! I add some of the raspberry juice and some of the pulp to the chocolate glaze as well for more yummy raspberry flavor. And of course, more raspberries on the bottom! One of my favorite things about this cheesecake is that it only calls for a small amount of cream cheese. Most cheesecakes call for 3 or 4 8-oz packages!

Incredibly sweet, I took the advice of people saying to add extra flour and such, and instead of raspberries, I put in 1 cup of chocolate chips, and I didn't do the chocolate glaze. It still came out irresistible and tasty!

I will give this a five as it was a good recipe. But I used a frozen berry mix and It had more blueberries, and I don't care for them in a pie, etc So I did not like the bottom of the cheesecake. Next time I will use only raspberries or strawberries. The Chocolate topping was delicious.

The only fault I found with this cheese cake was the raspberries.  So we ate around the them.  But the rest of it was Soooo good!  I'm making it today without raspberries for thanksgiving.  May just use a raspberry or strawberry topping.

This was a nice surprise. I was worried about condensed milk to be overpowering but it was not. It definately does not have the texture of cheesecake I like but it was still very good. I used oreo crust and more fresh raspberries. Very nice combinaton of flavors.

This was a great cheesecake, but where I live cream cheese doesn't come in 3 oz. packages and the condensed milk doesn't come in a 14 oz. cans, after all the calculating it actually made 3 cakes. But with my family that's not a bad thing.

I used this and a recipe for white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, kind of mixed up the 2, but it turned out VERY GOOD!  I also recommend, if you have the time, making you own crust.  Definitely would've turned out better.
