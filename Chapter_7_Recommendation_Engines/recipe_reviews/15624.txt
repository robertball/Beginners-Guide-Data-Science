These muffins were indeed moist, but they certainly weren't sweet...in fact, they weren't sweet AT ALL--they were completely bland.  As to the moistness, I added kernels of corn as a variation; I wonder if that was what might have helped with the moistness (others who have reviewed this recipe have also complained about the lack of moistness).  The honey on its own is definitely not enough to sweeten them...I was wishing I would have added sugar as well.  This was my first attempt at homemade corn muffins, and I must say, I will NOT use this recipe again. =[

These corn muffins were pretty good.  I have found that alot of recipes are bland and dry.  This wasn't as dry as most, but not really moist either.  The honey helped to sweeten them slightly, but I don't feel they were as sweet as I would have liked.

These muffins had a light hint of honey, but like all cornbreads I've made, they were a little dry despite the note about the honey making them moist.

These muffins were very good.  My only criticism of them, is that they stuck to the muffin tin and were not easy to get out whole.  But they were delicious and enjoyed by all.

I increased the buttermilk to 1 cup, and baked in a loaf pan to maintain moisture. Baking time increased to about 1 hour, which resulted in a lovely golden brown crust. Sweetness could have been increased slightly, but overall a great recipe I will use again.

I think they were good.  Here in Texas we don't like sweet cornbread muffins.  We might add a T. or two, but that is it.  When unsweentened, they go good with any entree; whereas, sweet muffins do not.  We like the cornbread flavor.

Despite their billing, these muffins made according to this recipe are NOT moist nor are they sweet.  I will not make this recipe again, there are far better versions.

I tweaked this recipe a bit--didn't think it deserved the rather negative reviews it has gotten!  Used one egg, 1 cup buttermilk, 1/4 sugar rather than the honey.  This way we could serve them with honey, rather than having it as an ingredient.

I was disappointed.  The muffins were reasonably moist, but not sweet at all.  I hoped the honey and buttermilk would give them a richer, sweeter taste, but that didn't work.

I've never made Cornbread before and I did alter the recipe, but it was perfect with gumbo!  Here's what I changed: I didn't have buttermilk, so I used milk.  And I used Rye flour instead of all-purpose.  I didn't have honey, either, so I used 1/4 cup evaporated cane juice.  And I rarely use oiil, so I substituted 2 heaping tablespoons of applesauce for the oil.  I baked them for 20 minutes, but I would check on them before the 20 minute mark next time.    Overall, I think this is a good base recipe!  Next time I'll try to add corn kernals and maybe some chiles of come sort to spice it up, along with more applesauce for more moisture.

This recipe is a consistent stand-by. I substituted 1/4 cup Splenda for Baking instead of the honey. I also added 1/2 small sauteed onion, 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese, and 1 8-3/4 oz. can whole kernel corn to the wet mixture. It baked up nice and my husband loved it. I poured it into a 7.25 x 11.5 glass baking dish and it cooked up fine in the same amount of time. I sprinkled a few strands of the shredded cheddar cheese on top after baking and stuck it back into the cooling oven just to melt the cheese.

Nice texture, not too sweet or overly dry.  There were equally good crumbled up in chili or broccoli-cheese soup, and eaten alone with a little honey.  I'm not sure if this will become my standard cornbread recipe, but it's definitely a good one :-)

Really good cornbread...not too sweet or cake-like, great with chili.  I didn't have enough honey so I used agave nectar and it tasted great. Also baked it in a 13x9 pan for about 20-25 min

Great, except for the baking soda.  Maybe a half teaspon would be enough.  I like cornbread like this that is not too sweet.

WOW this is very good and so easy.  I substituted non-fat yogurt for buttermilk.  It makes 24 mini muffins plus 6 corn cob shaped muffins - cook for 10-15 min

when making cornbread, you have to remember, its not going to be moist like regular muffins...that being said, if you substitute 1/3 to 1/2 cup of butter for the oil, it should taste better. also i use 2tbsp of sugar instead of the honey...so i think you should either up the honey or sub it with sugar (dont use splenda or any aspartame based sweetener people. you can tell the difference. dont need to be health conscience 24 hours a day)

I did like these muffins, however they tasted more like cornbread than corn muffins becuase they did not have enough sweetness. I think that they would be really good with some jelly or honey drizzled on top to add some sweetness. I also used wheat flour instead so that it is more healthy. Overal, a keeper. I would make them again.

These are good, like the texture..Next time i make them i'll add 1 t of salt, i think that will perk up the flavor..I also used olive oil and it worked fine...

These muffins were too dry and not sweet enough... Plus, I would drastically reduce the amount of baking soda/powder.

Very bland, they looked like cornbread...but the taste just wasn't there at all.  Maybe some Splenda, or another sweetener and some more salt would help, I don't know.  My family did not approve, we fed the leftovers to the dogs.

The recipe was ok, but as already said, is a bit dry, and isn't so sweet. I recommend adding a can of corn to moisten and a bit more sugar for sweetness.

The cornbread did not have a strong corn flavor, probably because the recipe called for equal parts flout and corn meal.

I just tried this recipe in a whim and read the comments, so I made a few adjustments and did variations.  

Firstly seeing the complaints about the moisture, I soaked the cornmeal in milk first.  I didn't have buttermilk so I added a teaspoon of vinegar to some 2% and replaced the oil with melted butter.

I also didn't have honey so I replaced it with table syrup.  I saw the complaints about the lack of sweetness so I also added a tbsp of sugar but still found no hint of sweet.

My variation included jalapeno and green onion

Usually people make cornbread WAY TOO SWEET ! These are perfect! My family is from Kentucky and they make cornbread with buttermilk---that is why you need the soda---and they add very little sugar or sweetner IF ANY. We love our cornbread with beans and a good meal, not as a cake like most people make it these days. Grandpa used to get sorgum and put it on the cornbread as a dessert, and that is another reason we don't want the cornbread too sweet. One tip: heat the muffin tin with a bit of oil in the bottom before putting the mix into it, and they will get a bit crispy on the bottom.

Ugh these came out terrible!!!! Of course it's the night before Thanksgiving and my one job was cornbread muffins!! I couldn't find my usual recipe, opted for this one. They are burnt, not sweet AT ALL, and certainly not moist. I even took them out of the oven at 18 minutes (recipe says 20-25). Please do yourself a favor and skip this recipe!!!

This recipe was quick and easy to make. I did add salt and white sugar to the recipe! I also found they didn't need that long to cook. Mine were finished in 15 minutes at 375! Loved it!

Used 1/3C honey to add a little more sweetness (based off of prev. reviews) as well as almost a full cup of buttermilk for additional moistness. I don't like using a muffin pan, so baked in a greased 'wedge' (8-section) cast iron cornbread skillet and poured the rest into a greased cake pan and baked at 375 for about 20 minutes. DELICIOUS!

I had to use regular whole milk instead of buttermilk, which probably changed the taste a bit. They were good, but not the best I've ever had.

Add a stick of butter and use sugar not honey. Add about a palm full more sugar as well, almost 1/2 cup. If using non-stick, don't bake for more than 20 minutes, it will dry them out depending on your oven. Just a few suggestions!

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I grew up with cornbread made with Jiffy Mix - which I loved.  But, I had never made cornbread from scratch before and thought I'd give it a shot.  I thought that buttermilk and honey would make an interesting mix.  There wasn't much taste, and although the texture seemed dry - there was an odd "oily" aftertaste to them.  I think I'll find another recipe on this site or go back to the Jiffy Mix...

I found these muffins tasteless.  Maybe if the honey were increased or sugar added in addition to the honey it would help.
