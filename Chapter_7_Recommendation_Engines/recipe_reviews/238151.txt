Actually pretty good I added two cloves of minced garlic and put it on top of my backed salmon. I suggest adding more hot sauce for a bigger kick.

Pretty good recipe. Used 2 mangos instead of 3, half of a Visalia onion, and only one jalape√±o. Although I love cilantro, my mother-in-law hates it so I left that out. Added a bit of salt for a contrast to the sweetness. Pretty easy to make, just takes some time to dice everything up.

I liked this!  I scaled it down to use one mango and I'd grabbed a red onion instead of Vidalia.  I'm one of those cilantro haters, so I subbed dry parsley, but have no doubt it'd be delightful w/cilantro, if you like it.  I served it atop blackened tuna steaks and it worked quite well.  I'm excited to have the rest in the freezer for future use.  THANKS for the recipe!
