Great recipe!  I used this recipe for breadsticks based on the fact they are called “fluffy”, as my plan was to make a Bosco Stick or cheese filled breadstick.  I’m glad I used this recipe, I followed the instructions mostly except allowed 1 Hour for rise, then when broke into sticks, placed a mozzarella stick in the center of each and allowed 30 minutes for rising.  Oh MY word!  The BEST!  My family loves these!

I made this even easier and bought premade yeast dough from the store. To prep, I portioned it out the same as in this recipe (2 oz portions rolled into 7" sticks) and let it rise about 2 hours. That's the trick! Then brush with butter and sprinkle with garlic salt. Weekends perfect every time! I also added a lil parmesan at the end and it was super tasty!

I followed the ingredients 100 percent. I followed step one. After mixture was frothy I poured the liquid mixture in into my bread pan followed by step two putting the ingredients in to the bread maker. Set the machine to dough. Picked up at step 4 except I substituted a silicone mat for the Parchment paper. Followed steps 5,6,7. This recipe produced the best bread sticks I've ever made.  They taste just like olive gardens maybe even better.  Thank you luckoftheIrish

Amazing recipe!thank you! I made these a few times already and they're absolutely delicious. My husband asked to make them again today. The only thing I changed is that instead of garlic salt I used regular salt and then mixed it with butter and freshly squeezed garlic for the top coat. So yummy!! Thanks again!

Delicious! I don't think that these are as 'fluffy' as the name describes, but they are yummy none the less. I halved the recipe and needed to add a bit extra water, just to bring it to a nice, soft dough. Very easy to make and the whole family enjoyed them! Thanks for sharing. :)

We LOVED these...and we're picky about bread.  They take a long time, but that rising time is what makes them so fluffy and light!

Dough was a little sticky, I think because I used regular flour as I had no bread flour on hand, but I just added a little extra and these turned out very nicely! Might add a tiny bit more yeast next time and will definitely use the bread flour. Will make again, they are similar to the ones at Olive Garden!

If you can follow the recipe...using bread flour, they are soft warm wonderful bread sticks.  Even if you use a regular flour they are not as fluffy but still one of the tastiest bread sticks out there.  A very nice recipe.

Fantastic.  Light and fluffy.  I kneeded by hand and made no changes to the recipe and the bread was a big hit.

Love this easy recipe for tasty breadsticks from scratch. Worth the work to have fresh bread with dinner. I like the flavour better when I mix the garlic salt into the butter before brushing on the baked bread sticks.

It was one of the easiest things I’ve made and as a young cook the outcome was awesome. I only ended up making 4 because I didn’t let them set correctly meaning I used the wrong thing to cover them up. They are really delicious and my family was proud of me yet again for creating great bread.

Best ever. I made it and the bread was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. I was pleased with the ease of making  and following the recipe. I did not change anything.

I really enjoyed these and didnt think they were tough to make. Time to rise, yes, but not much else. I dont have a stand mixer so I kneaded by hand and still had a very soft light bread. Next time I will make sure I have some cheese sauce, the kids would have like to dip them!

delicious bread sticks, but they weren't ready quickly. Needed the entire 1 and 1/2 hours to rise each rise.

I've made this recipe four times and had to tweak it a lot to get it to work.
