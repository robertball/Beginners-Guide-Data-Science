Cliff, your dish is AMAZING! Made it again this morning for about five people and it was easy to do and received rave reviews. I love the tsaziki sauce and love that I can now make this from scratch. I used Italian sausage instead of breakfast sausage, because it is what I could quickly find at the grocerty store, and it was perfect as well in this dish. Also, I couldn't find pita bread, so I warmed some Naan bread on the grill, cut it in half, and used it as a replacement. The photo I'm uploading is without the egg because it was SO BEAUTIFUL.  BTW, I made both this dish and the other for my guests to judge between the two themselves while Dinner Spinner was on, and yours won as easily as it did during taping. GREAT JOB!!!

I saw this on the TV show Allrecipes Dinner Spinner, this past Saturday, and loved the ingredients used.  The greek breakfast pita is high in protein and love the greek yogurt sauce.  I've tried it with spinach, too.  Love the flavors how they meld together.  Always did like eggs over easy, so this was so perfect in every way! Thanks!

I loved this breakfast pita!   It was hearty, but, fresh with the spring mix, onion, & tomato.   I made with turkey sausage instead of regular pork sausage and used green onions instead of white.   I also added a sprinkle of feta cheese.   I typically do not like an egg unless the yoke is completely cooked, but, I cooked this over medium and it was very good.  The yoke mixed in with the greens and it became more of a dressing.  I can totally see myself making this again.  Thanks for the recipe, Cliff!

WOW, what a great explosion of flavors and textures! I used romaine instead of spring mix b/c that's what I had on hand. Also, I had a hard time splitting the pitas once they were fried, so I just cut on in half and used half for the base and half for the top., which worked out fine. I cannot get over how delicious this was...I LOVED it! I will def be making this again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

When I saw Cliff make this recipe I was very impressed by the mix of favors. This recipe has everything you need to start the day, greens, tomatoes, yogurt and more protein with the meat and the eggs. Oh! Man Cliff can flip an egg in a pan and makes amazing over easy eggs. I love the tzatziki sauce. I made it last weekend for my family and everybody loved it. It is simple and quick but very impressive you can even do it for a quick breakfast on the run. Great job Cliff!

This is a recipe I will make over and over again. It is loaded with protein, flavor, and color. The homemade tzatziki sauce really made the dish!

Thanks, Cliff, for our delicious lunch today!  When I first made the sauce, I thought, "WOW!  That's a lot of pepper!"  But it totally worked!  The flavors were very tasty, and we absolutely have full bellies!  I think next time I will cut down a little on the amount of ingredients and also make it open faced rather than in the pocket.  All of that aside, we are happy campers!  Thanks!

The combination of flavors and textures was fantastic. Not an everyday breakfast, but great for special occasions.
