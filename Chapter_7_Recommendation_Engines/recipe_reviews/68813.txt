DELICIOUS! I am a huge Thai food fan because of the complex flavors Thai dishes have. This was my first try at making Thai and I must say I was really impressed! It tasted robust and flavorful, was super easy to make. The ingredients were sort of difficult to find at a smaller supermarket, but I went to Cost Plus World Market and found the chile oil, oyster sauce, etc. Worth the hunt! I love that its all made in one pan - less clean up! I served over sticky rice. The only comment is that it came out very spicy when made as directed. I personally love spiciness, so does my boyfriend, but his mom couldn't eat it due to the heat. You can omit the hot peppers or use olive oil instead of chile oil to take it down a notch. I'll make again!

I've been looking for some easy and authentic Thai recipes and this was great! I didn't have oyster sauce so I used 3 tbsp fish sauce, added some cilantro with the basil, and squeezed some lime right before serving. Turned out great!

Loved this recipe (with modifictions). I don't like mushrooms, or oyster sauce. Left them out, but added green beans.

I thought this recipe was just OK due to saltiness.  I followed the directions pretty closely unlike many of the reviewers here.  The only change I made was to use garlic powder instead of garlic salt and I still found this recipe to be VERY salty. The salt comes from the oyster sauce, and 5 tablespoons is about half of a small bottle of it. Bottom line if you like your food very salty go for it but otherwise I'd reccomend trying some of the other reviewers' suggestions for cutting the salt.

Prepared with red pepper flakes (1 tsp) and thai chilli sauce w/ garlic (2 tsp) instead of chili oil and whole peppers.  1/2 tsp sugar and 2 tbsp oyster sauce.  No garlic salt (heard it would be too salty).   substituted some mushrooms and red bell peppers for onion (had none).  Nice flavor. Next time, make more saucy. perfect degree of spiciness.  

boyfriend was alarmed that I used up half his basil plant for this one meal.

This was absolutely soooo delish! And sooooo easy & quick. Perfect to make when you want something good but don't feel like cooking after coming home from a long day's work. I like my food strongly flavored so I did make some changes. I also took note of what other reviewers mentioned, I also wanted the dish to be saucy. Sooo I used:5 garlic cloves minced instead of the two suggested I didn't have chili oil or the money to buy it so I used olive oil (which I already had on hand) instead and added 1/2 teaspoon achiote powder to the oil for coloring and 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes for heat. I increased the sugar to 2 teaspoons because I added 1 cup of water and 1/2 cup of oyster sauce (instead of the 5 tablespoons suggested) to make it saucier. also added about 1 teaspoon of ginger powder. Forgot to mention, I also tossed in at the last moment for a crunch about 2 cups of green beans that had been halved. LOVED IT! I DEFINITELY WILL BE FORWARDING THE RECIPE TO FRIENDS AND THE BEST THING IS I DON'T HAVE TO COOK TOMORROW BECAUSE I HAVE A LITTLE LEFT OVER.

I used dried crushed pepper since I didn't have chili oil or any fresh hot peppers.  My plan was to use dried basil since I didn't have any fresh basil, but it tasted so good before I got to the adding basil part that I was afraid or ruining it with the dried basil.  I added fresh sweet pepper and sugar snap peas and it was great.  No leftovers.  I will definitely make again when I have fresh basil.

This meal is fantastic!  It's different from the same old chicken and is not too spicy for the non-spicy lover.  I had to buy a lot of items for this recipe, so I made adjustments where I could to save money.  I used olive oil instead of chili oil, and used about 1 and a half tsp dried basil (from a spice rack I already had) instead of fresh.  For the hot peppers, I wasn't sure what to buy, so I bought three small peppers that the produce man said were not too hot.  I cut out the insides and sliced into circles to make it pretty.  Also, I couldn't find oyster sauce, only "oyster-flavoured sauce" but it worked fine.  I used a small can of mushrooms too, because I hate having leftover mushrooms in the fridge that I know I'll never use, but that doesn't really matter all that much.  It turned out delicious, juicy, flavourful and not too spicy, although I did drink lots of water with it.  It has a wonderful kick.  Definitely serve with rice.  My hubby gave this five stars!

Nice recipe. This is my favourite Thai dish, and this was a great comparison. I used A LOT of basil and skipped the garlic salt (just used regular salt), as I like the flavour of real garlic. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good!   However, I found it to be very salty.  When I watered down the oyster sauce (about 2 Tbsp to the 5 Tbsp of sauce), I was much happier with the results.  Goes nicely with Thai noodles, too!

My boyfriend loved it, said it was one of the best dinners I ever made :) The only thing I didn't have was chili oil, so I added crushed red pepper to the olive oil I browned the garlic and peppers in. Served over rice noodles. I loved the fresh basil flavor and did not find it too salty, although I did not add salt and pepper. I have been commanded to make this one again, thanks for a great recipe! UPDATE: Made this again with sweet Vidalia onions and portobello mushrooms...superb!

Very delicious meal! I decided to cut the mushrooms from the recipe, and it still turned out great! I also added a bit of cayenne. (Gave it an even spicier flavor.) Thank you very much, I really enjoyed it!

Loved this! Didn't dare tell DH that I added oyster sauce, otherwise he wouldn't have eaten it. I've been collecting recipes that make use of fresh basil since we love it so much, and this really fits the bill!  I sauted the onion, mushrooms, and (a tiny habanero) pepper in the chili oil first, since that's what I usually do. Next I added the chicken and garlic so the garlic wouldn't burn. I used a little less oyster sauce than it called for (on the suggestion of others) and added about 1/2 cup water, 2 packets of Truvia, pepper, chopped broccoli, and green beans, since I had these on hand. After letting this cook for 3-4 minutes, I added 1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with a little cold water. After letting this simmer for a few minutes to thicken the sauce, I added the chopped basil. Served this over brown rice, and it was wonderful!

Awesome dish! Has a flavor similar to drunken noodles, minus the noddles. I added sugar snap peas in with the mushrroms and onions and substituted 3tbls. fish sauce plus 2 tbls. chicken broth for the oyster sauce and cut the garlic salt in half. Will definitely hold on to this recipe!

Making the recipe as is would be soooo salty! I only used 3 tablespoons oyster sauce and omitted the garlic salt and the flavor was wonderful.  I like a little more sweetness so I did up the sugar a little as well.  Otherwise, excellent recipe that I will make again.

I feel like a great Thai chef after having prepared this dish!  Some hints: 1) I left out the garlic salt so the dish wouldn't be too salty and it wasn't missing at all. 2)I added yellow bell peppers and can't imagine the dish without them. They were necessary. 3) I wanted SUPER spicy, so I used chopped green chile peppers in the chicken saute as specified AND I added some crushed red pepper flakes. It produced tears - perfect! Overall, excellent, simple recipe that you can easily modify for your specific tastes.

Great quick dinner.  I substituted 1 TBS of canola oil for the chili oil to bring the heat down and only added 4 TBS of oyster sauce to cut down on the salt.  End result was perfect.  Spicy, but not too hot.  Hubby added a bit of extra chili oil at the table to bring up the heat a little.  Would definitely make this again. Use lots of fresh whole basil leaves.

This tasted pretty good after a few tweaks:  added some fish sauce and lime juice.  I also made the recipe in a slightly different order than the printed recipe.  I stir-fried the chicken in chili oil until slightly browned, then added the mushrooms and onions.  When the onions were tender, I added the garlic, garlic salt, sugar, and pepper and the oyster sauce.  Threw in a good splash of fish sauce, and the juice of a lime:  sweet, salty, spicy, sour.  Turned out great and the hubby loved it.  Served with Thai cucumber salad from this website.  Thanks!

This was awesome. I made as written with the exception of using 2 dried chili peppers which I removed after cooking and using only 1/2 bunch of basil. It was really great.  I was OK with the amount of heat, but might replace 1/2 tbsp of the chili oil with regular oil next time just to dial it back a notch. Definitley don't overcook the chicken, as soon as it's white on all sides add the onion and sauce, everything will cook through by the time the onions are done.  I used 5 tbsp of oyster sauce and I didn't think it was oversalty at all but there are probably variations with different brands.

Great flavor but omitted the extra salt and it was still plenty salty.  Used jalapenos sliced the long way.  Next time I will add green beans!

I didn't use the garlic salt as per one reviewer and this came out sooo good.    We had it with Spinach and Buttermilk soup from this site.  I will definitly make this again.

I love this recipe!!! I made it last night and made no modifications. It was absolutely declicious. My boyfriend ate what was supposed to be leftovers for the next day! Don't be discouraged by the chili oil or the oyster sauce, which by the way, I had never used before. I will make this again and again and pass it on to my friends. Thank you for a great recipe!

Yummy! I loved this! It was just delicious over brown rice with a side of green beans. I too, like a saucier meal, so I followed the person who added 5 cloves of garlic, one cup of water, and 1/2 cup of oyster sauce - except I used fish sauce - I couldn't find oyster sauce. It was great! The only thing I forgot to do was add more chilis because I like mine really hot. It was still amazingly good though!

I made this last night.  Quick trip to the grocery store, no problem finding the chili oil or oyster sauce (oriental food section).  I used crimini mushrooms and walla walla (yellow) onions and fresh thai basil  and thai chilies (growing in my yard).  Let me say this, I was frankly shocked at how good this recipe was and how easy and quick it was to prepare.  Skill level- beginner.  Taste- awesome.  I read a lot of the reviews and I feel that if you try and swap out oyster sauce or fresh basil for something else, it just wont be as good.  Those are essential ingredients in Thai food.  Both of those items are readily available any time of the year in any grocery store.  So if you are going to use this recipe go to the store.  The oyster sauce bottle will make easily 5 recipes or more of this.  I fully intend to repeat this often and pinned it as well.   Totally awesome recipe.

Loved this!  Not only delish, but super easy and fast.  My husband, who is very picky about trying new dishes loved it!  I followed the recipe with minor changes. I seasoned the chicken pieces with the garlic salt and pepper before placing in wok. We love spicy, but I only used 2 red hot chilis and the heat was just right.I used 2 tsp. sugar to lower the saltiness and added 1/2 cup water to increase the sauce amount. I also used the entire carton of fresh mushrooms.

This was a fun recipe to make.  Whenever I have to take a knife to chicken I do when it is frozen or semi frozen -- it just makes it easier to cut.  Since this is a Thai dish I placed the still frozen chicken chunks into a bowl with one can of coconut water with pulp, and added a pinch of red pepper flakes and 1 tbs dried basil (I didn't have any fresh basil and the store was fresh out.).   I let the chicken soak while I prepped the rest of the vegetables.  Instead of hot peppers I used 6 mini peppers, 3 red, 2 yellow and 1 orange.  I upped the garlic to 5 gloves and nixed the garlic salt.  I used a bunch of scallions instead of a onion, and added a dozen baby carrots and 2 stalks of celery.  After I added the oyster sauce I poured in the reserved coconut water I used with the chicken and let it reduce at a simmer for about 20 minutes.  I served this on top of a bed of white rice and used a quarter of a lime to add a spritz of fresh lime juice.  The kids loved it and there were no leftovers.

Delicious!  Three of my favorite things: chicken, spice, and basil.  I did omit the oyster sauce, simply because I didn't have it on hand.  I also left out the mushrooms (because I hate them) and sugar (because it really doesn't need it).  I added broccoli, which sucked up all the juice, making it fabulous.  I did add a little bit of broth because I served it over jasmine rice, so I wanted the rice to pick up a little bit of liquid.  It was a fairly spicy, so those with spice intolerance may want to drop the chili oil to 1 Tbs or so (but it was perfect for us).  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious. It needed something green so I added asparagus and green beans...It asked for 3 hot chili peppers. I went to the store and bought three different peppers. It had a great kick to it...not for people who do not like it hot.

This was a very good recipe but to cut down on the salt I used garlic powder on the chicken. I added yellow and red pepper as well. I added 1/4 cup of low sodium chicken broth with the oyster sauce to make it saucier. I did not have chili oil or fresh chili pepper so I added 2 level tsps of Sambal Oelek -fresh ground chili paste to the oil and garlic. It worked well and was nice and warm but not too hot. Heat lovers could add more if you really like your lips to burn. Good recipe

I have family cooking nights at my house almost every week and this is by far one of my family's favorite recipes.  I followed this dish almost exactly and it was easy, spicy and healthy.  The only change I made was adding red and green bell peppers.  I will definitely make again and again!

Just Ok, wasn't a stand out. I was glad to find a recipe tho' to use up my garden's bounty of Thai basil.  It made the dish taste very unique.  Both my hubby and I agreed that using Italian Basil would not be the same effect as it would lose its Asian influence. To each his own.

DELICIOUS!!!!I've made this many times and have given the recipe to my son and my friends. It is so easy, so yummy! I always double it and make extra sauce, and I always add a little water and a small packet of G. Washingtons golden broth powder. We all love it, even my 16 year old son. Great recipe! Thanks! I also ALWAYS make the coconut rice from AR to go with this...so good!

This was very authentic.  The Thai basil is a little harder to find, but makes this dish wonderful.  I only switched the sugar for Splenda, and on Weight Watchers it works to about 4-5 Points per serving using 1 lb of chicken.  Thank you for sharing!

I completely left out the oyster sauce to keep it kosher- but it still tasted delicious. The key is absolutely to use fresh herbs. Dry basil flakes would just not cut it in this dish.

This was quite tasty.  I followed all the directions except 1) I reduced the quantity of oyster sauce (5 tablespoons is a LOT), 2) omitted the salt (the oyster sauce has a salty flavor), 3) I added two cups of haricot vert for extra vegetables, and 4) instead of using chili oil, I just used a 1/2 teaspoon of Sambal Oelek red chili paste with regular vegetable oil.  But the taste is great.  Very good recipe.

I thought this was excellent. I used 2 chopped serrano chile peppers instead of 3 as some people said it was too spicy. It was just perfect for me, a nice kick but not overpowering. Will definitely make again. It was a little salty so next time may use garlic powder instead.

AWESOME! My hubby and I felt like we were in a Thai restaurant. I did make subs like a few other -- fish sauce instead of oyster sauce, coconut oil to cook the chicken and sweet chili sauce instead of the chili oil, sugar and peppers.

YUM! I wasn't sure oyster sauce would be the right flavor in this dish, but IT IS! It tastes just like #9 at my favorite local Thai place (gai prig prow...I believe). I didn't have hot chiles, so I used chili garlic sauce (with the rooster...Sambal Oleck) and I added sliced red peppers onion and a can of bamboo shoots (to make it more like my favorite #9). It worked! This is on the repertoire for sure!

I think what really makes or breaks this dish is the oyster sauce and the basil you use.  I think that sweet basil pairs well with this dish and the brand of oyster sauce I used was Good Luck which I didn't think was the best.  I will try another brand next time.  I didn't have chili oil so I used vegetable oil which was fine.  I used 2 serrano chilies and 1 anaheim.  I like spicy and it was plenty spicy enough.  I almost threw in some Sriracha and I am glad I didn't.  Overall it was really good and I will be making it again.

This recipe is really too spicy for me, but it still is a good and tasty stir fry! I had to order the chili oil off of the internet, because my local grocery store does not sell it. I used Serrano chile peppers for the hot chile peppers, and served it over Basmati rice.

I really liked this one.  My DH said he could only taste the black pepper.  I only did 1 T of chili oil and 1 hot pepper because I have kids.  Next time I would put the 2 T's in and cut back on the black pepper a little to maybe half.  I used green onion instead of white because of a personal preference and I would have added a lot more basil to the dish.  I will make this again thanks for sharing.

This was delicious! My attempts at Thai food don't always result in much to talk about, but this was very good. We didn't have chili peppers so I added 1T crushed red pepper and ginger paste to the chicken which gave it a great flavor and a nice spice level. I also followed recommendations from previous readers to make it saucier and added 4T Oyster sauce (in hopes of it not being too salty) and 1 C water, then served in on rice noodles and it was great.

We really liked this recipe...even the SUPER picky boyfriend. I made the recipe exactly as directed with the following changes: No chili peppers but instead added 1-2 tablespoons of red pepper flakes, Added 4 cloves of garlic instead of 2, and added a touch more chili oil once the chicken was added. FOR SURE will make again.

This was excellent!  And really easy too.  I used thai chilli peppers, and only three, and it was very spicy!  So in the end, I added a bit of brown sugar while still in the pan to cut the heat and it was delicious.  Served over rice.  Will make again for sure.  Thanks!

Very good, and super easy. Tastes better than take out food too. Served it over oven roasted asparagus instead of rice.

I skipped the garlic salt after reading the reviews but otherwise followed the recipe quite closely. There is little sauce and personally I would have preferred more. This was an ok dish but I will not make it again as there are many Thai dishes that are just as easy to make but so much nicer.

I was initially apprehensive about the lack of ingredients for flavourings, but this was delicious. I added buk choy, orange and purple carrots and broccoli florets for added flavour and to pack it out a bit and served over Jasmine rice. I also included a few mint leaves as the basil flavour was a little underwhelming. So quick and so easy, this will become a regular for sure.

This was really good.  Just like from a restaurant.  I cut down the heat by a third for both the chili oil and the red peppers and I still think mine was a 3 star heat.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  Modified it based on preferences and availability of ingredients.  Used olive oil, omitted garlic salt (per other reviews), knocked the oyster sauce down to 4 tbsp, added sliced red bell pepper instead of onion, and sprinkled in some chili flakes to up the spice level.  Served with rice, and really enjoyed the balance of spice, and slight sweetness.  Thanks for a quick and tasty dish.

Very good! Eyeballed the measurements, skipped the garlic salt and used extra fresh garlic instead, and used five birds eye chillis because I wanted it pretty spicy. Used bone in chicken, and added added some water after adding all the ingredients except the basil. Covered and let it boil down to a nice gravy. I tasted this before adding the basil, and again after, the fresh basil really makes a difference.

The oyster sauce goes a long way so I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Verrrry good.  Basil makes a difference, and I add some spinach for an extra veggie boost. Yummy!

Great recipe, but I have a few tips. Prep time takes longer than 15 minutes.  Plan on 30, and you will be in the ballpark.  5 Tbsp of Oyster sauce, is slightly less than 1/3 cup.  Finally, I added some diced red pepper to give it some color.

This was super easy to make and tasty!! My hubby loved it. I didn't have chili oil and I wish I did. I added a cup of water as another reviewer stated to thin out the sauce and lower the saltiness. The dish wasn't as spicy as I was expecting so I added some Sriracha to kick it up a notch. I also added red & orange bell peppers, broccoli, and zucchini. I will definitely make this again!!  I also used brown rice. Next time I will try tofu.

I made it several times, esp. when I had guests and everyone loved it. You could go creative with the sauce and add 3tbs of oyster sauce and 2 tbs of sweet chillie or chillie garlic sauce for diversity in flavour.

Outstanding! Spicy and so Thai tasting!
We used regular olive oil instead of chili oil and used 3 serrano peppers and the spice level was perfect - nice and spicy. Will pass this one along to friends.

Wow, the flavor was great. I forgot to buy chile pepper so I left them out but this was still very spicy.Too spicy for my adult daughter but just right for her boyfriend and my husband.
 I will make again replacing some chili oil with olive oil. and put the chili oil on the table for those who want more spice.

Very good! It was pretty spicy, but the serrano pepper that I used was extremely hot so  I think that was why. Luckily I only used one and not 3 like the recipe called for. If you aren't ready for a lot of spice, I would check on the spice level of the peppers that you're using before using 3 of them. Otherwise, I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I was looking for a recipe to recreate my favorite meal from our local Thai restaurant. This was right on the money. I couldn't find the chiles, so I used a Thai chili sauce instead. Incredible!

Vegetarian here, so I made a few subs: 

I used Quorn (brand) "Chicken" Tenders  rather then real chicken and it turned out FANTASTIC. 
I also could not get any thai basil, so I used regular basil. I doubled up and used 2-3 large bunches of leaves. 
I also only had sesame flavored chili oil on hand, and used that. 
I quartered baby bella mushrooms and a quarter of a red pepper cut into thin strips as well as a hand full of snap peas. 
I omitted the the chills since I didn't want to run to the store.

I ended up serving it over thin green beans, and even my kids loved it, which is amazing since 7 and 10 year olds can be picky at times. 

Everything else I did per the recipe (well, except I added red pepper flakes once dished out so the kids wouldn't burn their lips from the spiciness)  and I must say it's a keeper. 

Thanks so much!

Loved it!  To make it a little less spicy I just halved the chili oil and replaced the other half with olive oil.  I also followed other comments and put in more fresh garlic and omitted the garlic salt.

This was pretty good, although sweeter than what I'm used to for basil chicken...next time I'd try it without the sugar.  I used chili garlic paste and vegetable oil instead of chili oil (couldn't find it at the grocery store).  And I had to use regular basil instead of Thai basil, but otherwise I followed the recipe.

This turned out great.  It actually ended up being close to the Basil Chicken we eat at our local Thai restaurant.  I did make a few changes.  First, I used ground chicken, as the restaurant we go to uses ground, not boneless.  I didn't have any chile peppers, but I did have a chile paste, so I used that in place.  Also, didn't have any thai basil, so used regular.  I was worried that it would ruin it.  It didnt' ruin it, but can definitley tell a difference between thai basil and the regular basil you buy from the store.  Oh, and I think that in order to achieve the truly authentic taste, fresh basil is a must, even if it's not thai basil.  Served with Jasmine rice.  It turned out spicier than I thought it would, using the chile paste, but I would still do it that way next time.  I was worried it might be too spicy for my daughter, but she liked it!  Mind you, I add cayenne pepper to almost everything I cook, so almost everything we eat has a little heat.  THis was definitley more than what my daughter is used to.  My husband and I love the spiciness.  Oh man, was this good.  Just writing this review has me wanting it again!

It was really good!  This was my first time using oyster sauce.  I only used 2 T.  After looking at various grocery stores, I finally found chili oil at Cost Plus World Market.  For the chili peppers I used seeded and deveined jalapenos. I halved the recipe and only used one jalapeno.  Not a fan of mushrooms so I used green bell pepper.  This was so easy to make. I chopped up all my ingredients beforehand so that it was easier to cook.  Definitely will be making this dish again....maybe add another jalapeno and another veggie.

OMG, this is my new favorite recipe.  My son made this using a 1/2 of a habanero and it about blew us away.  This was the best tasting meal I've ever had!

This was excellent. I only used 3 tablespoons of oyster sauce and added 2 big tablespoons of coconut milk right before taking off the heat.  Improves the texture! Habanero type hot sauce also works well if you need to substitute for actual peppers.

This recipe was DELICIOUS! Sweet and spicy, very easy to make, and better than the basil chicken I ordered from a local Thai place a few weeks ago! This is definitely going into the regular rotation.  Substitutions: 2 tablespoons chili oil (didn't have this so I used 1tsp Goya hot yellow pepper paste, few dashes of hot sauce, and olive oil) 2 cloves garlic (used 3-4) 3 hot chile peppers (couldn't find these, so I used one jalapeno pepper) 1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar (didn't have this so I used 1.5 tsp brown sugar) 1 teaspoon garlic salt (added 2 more cloves of garlic instead) 5 tablespoons oyster sauce (due to reviews about it being too salty, I only used 2.5 tbsp) 1 bunch fresh basil leaves (use a lot!)																																											I cooked fresh green beans separately and served it over that instead of rice.

This recipe was INCREDIBLE.  We followed it exactly (except, you know, dicing the garlic, peppers, mushrooms, and onions, which wasn't specified), and it was out of this world.  Definitely going into our recipe book!

I tried this with ground beef, but I added a small amount of peppers. It still came out really good! My daughters loved it and they are both really picky eaters!

We really like this recipe with beef, using a tender cut. I've followed a few suggestions: 3 T fish sauce instead of oyster sauce and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. When adding the basil, I turn off the heat, throw the basil in the pan and cover. I let that sit for 5-10 minutes, stirring now and then; that way it gets less leafy. Thank you for the recipe!

Very good!  Entirely too salty, though!  I haven't tried it, but would suspect, that adding an extra clove or two of garlic, eliminating the garlic salt and using 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of regular salt would achieve superior results.  I will definitely try this again!

Spicy and delicious...I used carribean hot peppers and it had a really nice, spicy flavor and was easy to prepare...did I mention it was spicy?!? Since my boyfriend and I like to set our mouths on fire at least 3 times a week, this one is a definite keeper!

This recipe is awesome!  I made it exactly as stated and had seconds...which is something that I never usually do.  I love this in the Thai restaurant but this is so good that it can more than meet any cravings I will have for this in the future.

Fantastic!  Just what I was looking for.  I used chili oil as instructed and 1-1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, slightly precooked fresh green beans, sliced red bell pepper, and large chunks of celery.  I, too, am a vegetarian and so used 3 tbsp Bragg's Liquid Amino instead of oyster sauce and 2 tbsp water.  Instead of chicken I coated and fried 1/2" slices of extra firm tofu in a seperate pan.  Served with Jasmine rice.  It didn't make enough leftovers for two and so will adjust for that next time I make this—which will be very soon!  Thanks so much, and happy new year!

Excellent dish. Added chopped cilantro (about a 1/4 cup) and the lime juice from 1/4 wedge of lime. Didn't have peppers so I added a little dried red pepper flakes and used dried basil instead of fresh. ONE WORD OF CAUTION - if you arent used to using the hot chili oil when you add the chicken it may atomize and/or smoke a bit in the kitchen and cause some breathing irritation. I made this in the fire station and cleared the kitchen with everyone coughing. Our ventilation fan does not keep up with the smoke/vapor production.

Wonderful and fast for a week night dinner.  I used chicken thighs and added chili sauce.  The second time I made it, I added fresh asparagus for a complete meal.  This has become one of my favorites.

Delicious! This recipe was a hit!!! I made a few modifications... since I didn't have chili oil or chili peppers, I used garlic chili paste instead, no onions & no mushrooms. I didn't use the full amount of oyster sauce, since I read from other reviews & I didn't want it too salty. I still have requests from friends to make it again!!!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  It's become my stand-by and I make a ton of it, mix it in with rice, and eat it left over for days.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't find it too salty and I follow the recipe almost exactly.  It's very spicy, which I really like, but if you don't like spicy quite as much, add more white rice.  I would HIGHLY recommend this recipe.

This was really good and really easy.  The one thing is I would change it to garlic  salt to taste.  It was SO salty that I ended up adding a can of coconut milk. The coconut milk made it really good too though.  I too used fish sauce instead of oyster sauce b/c I had it on hand.

My husband who generally doesn't like "bird" loved this!  I put some red pepper flakes in the oil (instead of the spicy peppers) and used some chili sauce as well. I also used chicken thighs instead of breast meat and substituted water chestnuts and some red bell pepper for the mushrooms because that was what I had on hand but I think the mushrooms would be scrumptious in this as well.

I was able to make this with ingredients I had on hand with no extra trips to the store!  The only substitution was 1 Tbsp. of chile sauce with garlic instead of the chile peppers.  I served over thai noodles.  As other reviewers stated I will make extra sauce next time.

This was so good! My husband and I really enjoyed this and both of us actually took the leftovers for lunch today. I had bought some hot chili oil from Chinatown and that had the crushed up red peppers already sitting in it. I used about a tbs of that paste instead of the chile peppers. I only used about 4 tbs of the oyster sauce since that is already plenty salty and I omitted the garlic salt. Other than that, I did exactly what the recipe stated. This totally reminds me of a dish found at a Thai restaurant. I'll definitely be making this again. thank you!

This was okay. I followed the directions with the exception of substituting green beans for mushrooms and served it over noodles because I didn't have any rice on hand. Neither my husband or myself were particularly wow'd by it. I actually enjoyed the leftovers the next day for lunch better than I had the night before.

This was tasty! I omitted the onion, simply because I didn't have one. Instead of chopping mushrooms, I used 2 whole ones, since I don't like them, but still like the flavour and was sharing this dish with someone that does like mushrooms. I LOVED THIS RECIPE. Delicious!

I thought this recipe was good but not complex in flavors.  I did omit the oyster sauce because I didn't have any and didn't want to run to the store just for this one item.  That may have been the ingredient that would have added more depth, otherwise it was good but didn't taste "authentic" to me.
I will definitely try it again with the oyster sauce just to see.

So good!!  The only change was to sub 1 teaspoon dried crushed red peppers.  I did not have whole chili peppers.  I did not think that the recipe was too salty.  I love it BUT very spicy.

5 star. Never cooked with oyster sauce before. Because of oyster sauce high sodium content, skipped the garlic salt and just added extra fresh garlic.

This recipe was great just as submitted. My 3 teenage boys also loved it. We served it over white rice and/or rice noodles. I will definitely be making this again.

The recipe is practically goof-proof. We’ve made this dish many times and it turns out great every time. Now we add edamame and peanuts for a protein boost. Enjoy!

Delicious!!! But I didn’t have all the ingredients but still came out great!  I didn’t have chili oil or the chili’s. I used a little olive oil , chili paste , and crushed red pepper. Also added chopped red bell peppers and ground chicken breasts in a food processor. I like it this way for lettuce wraps. But the oyster sauce, garlic and basil are a beautiful combination in this recipe. My husband loved it and said he would happily eat this 3 times a week!

I absolutely loved this recipe! It has a major kick and when I make it again, I will probably use a  pepper with a little less heat.  Instead of the rice, I made cauliflower rice and put the chicken on top. Was so good and will definitely make it again soon!

Love it! My only change was using garlic powder instead of garlic salt (because it's what I had). I don't think the garlic salt would have been too salty but it is great without it. I used 3 Anaheim chilies without seeds and the heat is perfect. Easily adjustable for personal preference and/or for whatever chilies are available at the market. 

I would definitely order this at a Thai restaurant and I am thrilled I made it myself!

Are you kidding me?! Complex. Spicy. Filling. Easy. I didn’t change a thing except for doubling the recipe. Yes. Yes. Yes. I found this recipe while searching “basil” because our plant is out of control. I will definitely make this a staple recipe. Thank you, Zfamily!

This one is a keeper. I used diced jalapeño peppers and a dash of red pepper flakes. Also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and increased the amount. Easy to prepare and good for a casual dinner. I had a group of girlfriends over and they loved it.

Used half the chili oil and removed seeds from jalapenos and it was still spicy (and I eat spicy) but delicious. I would absolutely make it again.

Liked it but it was very salty. Next time I make it I’ll use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I didn’t have oyster sauce so I subbed fish sauce. Also added fresh ginger. Great flavor! Served over rice.

Made it per the recipe, although I wasn't sure just what pepper to use. I had some long green hot peppers, so I sliced up just one of those. The fam loved it, but it wasn't quite hot enough for me. Good flavor, though!

Thanks for this delicious recipe!  My basil is doing great this year, and I was looking for new ways to use it.  I've come upon a winner!  Based on other reviewers, I made the following changes:  Instead of the hot chili peppers, I used 1/2 tsp. crushed red chiles, I added 1 tsp ginger powder, 1 cup water, and increased the oyster sauce to 1/2 cup.  Also, I was low on mushrooms, so added in sliced green pepper.  I think any veggie would be great in here.    I'll be making it again tonight for company.

Delicious.  However, this recipe is vague on several important points.  Such as how much fresh basil to use.  I put in two cups of unchopped leaves, slightly compressed.  The recipe could be improved by using a weight measurement.  Also, what does "3 peppers" mean?  I used about one Tsp of chopped Thai peppers, with most, but not all, of the seeds scraped out from the halved peppers.  Loved the dish in the end.

I would add more vegetables next time to balance the salty taste.  Noodles might be good too.  Maybe broccoli or zucchini would be good.

Great dish,easy to make and everyone loved it.  I cut back a bit on the chili oil, because I’m not a fan of the heat, it was great!  I love basil so there was plenty of that in this dish too.

This was really good. I ddn't have chilli oil so I used olive oil and 1 tsp red pepper flakes. I didn't add salt, I substituted 1tsp freeze dried garlic. Next time I will leave out the sugar. I served it over spinach.

This is a quick and easy recipe!  The flavor is fantastic and only has just a few ingredients!  I followed the exact recipe and I did not find it too spicy for my taste...the only thing different was unfortunately I did not have fresh basil on hand so I used  dry.  I will definitely make this again and again but next time I will use fresh basil.  It will put it over the top :)

Very tasty and quite spicy. Next time I will use 2 jalapeños and cut back on the garlic salt in which I used only 3/4 tsp. Next time 1/2 tsp. I substituted fish sauce for the oyster sauce and it tasted just fine. I added 2 cups fresh green beans per another gals suggestion and it completed the meal. Served this over jasmine rice. Nice meal!!

Well I nearly asphyxiated myself sautéing the garlic  and chili peppers. When I added the oyster sauce, the smell really got to me. But when it was time to eat, it was delicious.

We loved this!  Even my picky 14 year old, who claims to hate asian food, had seconds and wanted more.   I didn't add the hot peppers due to personal preference, and I used water chestnuts instead of mushrooms because that's what I had on hand.  Other than that, I made it exactly as written.  This is going into my "really good" folder in my recipes!

This was amazing! A slow, building heat that sneaks up on you. I was missing some things in the kitchen, so had to swap in 1 jalapeño, 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, 3/4 cayenne pepper. 3/16 cup dried basil. Rabbit instead of chicken. Garlic powder instead of salt.

My son tried making this and went "rogue," so the recipe he made was different - and very delicious.  Boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts (yum!).  No basil, no mushrooms.  Swapped out dark Asian sesame oil for chili oil.  Used serrano peppers.  Swapped out 3 TB fish oil + 2 TB water for the 5 TB oyster sauce.  Skipped the garlic salt and didn't miss it at all.

Excellent flavor combinations. As others have noted, it doesn't make sense to use garlic salt when fresh garlic is available, so I increased the amount of minced garlic and used just a touch of regular salt. Other than that, the only change was to add some sliced scallions (since I had some on hand that needed to be used up). Also, since I picked my basil fresh from the patio, I wasn't sure how much a "bunch" was - next time I'll add more than what I did today. But overall, served on top of some jasmine rice, this was very good.

i made several changes--some unintended---my market didn't have chili oil so i used hot chili garlic paste in organic olive oil.  the chili peppers i bought were not as hot as expected or advertised.  silver lining; all this worked to my advantage as my DH doesn't tolerate heat (although he is getting more acclimatized).  i marinated the chicken for 3 hours in lime juice, 3 garlic cloves & a tablespoon of red chili flakes soaked in oil, along with the blk pepper & rather than sugar i used maple syrup.  when heating the chili sauce/oil , i added the onions, the pseudo chili peppers & then 4 large pressed organic garlic cloves.  i used 3 tablespoons of organic oyster sauce (again DH doesn't like oysters or oyster sauce), with  half a lime squeezed, tamari & a tad more maple syrup & the mushrooms.  i served it with chinese green beans & nuts, & organic wild rice with portabella  mushrooms.  my DH had 3 helpings, so i assume he enjoyed it. ;-)  i haven't made thai for @ least years but as thai goes it was very good, but not quite stellar.  i'll try making it again---when i've chili oil & hot chili peppers.  thank you for submitting it.

great flavor! very spicy but not too much so. it was a little salty like the others said. next time I will leave out the garlic salt. I served it over jasmine rice which helped cut the spice. my husband even loved it. will definitely make this again!]

Loved it. It is especially good if you have basil available from your garden. I used about 2 cups of loosely packed basil. Yumm. 
Basil is easy to grow in a large flower pot on your patio and supplies endless basil all summer.

Made as written. Way way too salty. I enjoy spice but my family said it was too much heat for them. However, the flavor that wasn't overwhelmed by salt was nice. I would try this again but reduce the oyster sauce and omit the garlic salt.

I followed all instructions pretty closely except for using jalapeno peppers. The flavor was absolutely amazing but it ended up so spicy I had to get seconds of just rice to cool my mouth. Next time I know to use a little less pepper or just go with a different one all together.

I give this recipe 4 stars only because it is too hot made with 2 Tbs of chili oil and my family eats spicy food often.  I tame it down by adding 2 Tbs of canola oil and 1 tsp of chili oil which is still quite spicy.  I have also substituted with 2 Tbs of canola oil with 1/4 tsp of red pepper which also works very well.  With these adjustments, I rate this dish a 5 star!

It is far too salty. I didn't use the garlic salt, but the oyster sauce alone was too much. I added water, carrots, squash and bell pepper in an attempt to temper the salt, but I didn't have enough veggies.

I'm a huge fan of Thai food, and was thrilled that this turned out so well! I used one jalapeño with the seeds removed, and added red pepper flakes and siracha. I also omitted the mushrooms. It was almost too spicy, so next time I'll go a little lighter in the heat. I also think that next time, instead of rice, that I'll use rice noodles.

This is a very tasty recipe. I didn't have red chili peppers, so I used one jalapeño instead, also had to substitute sesame oil for chili oil. I used fresh basil from the garden and it was the key to this dish, so fragrant and flavorful. It is a quick and easy dish to make and tastes great, I'll definitely be making it again.

This was excellent. Very close to a favorite restaurant dish we love. The only thing I changed was I cooked the onion with the garlic and peppers. Yes it's spicy, just like we love it. Next time I make it I'll serve it over noodles.

LOVE this!  I love hot food and I used the chili oil, I dried thai chili and 1 jalapeño.  It was very spicy but I loved it.  I substituted yellow bell pepper for the mushrooms as that is my preference.  And I used only 3T of the oyster sauce.  I tried it with both sweet basil and thai basil and I enjoyed both quite a bit.  So good!!!  This will be a regular for me.

I love Thai food and this was right on.  I might try cutting the sugar in half next time just because I have cut most sugars out of my diet and this was a little sweeter than I have become accustom to. Also added twice the garlic just because I love garlic.

I always have a hard time finding Thai recipes to cook at home that actually taste really good, but this one fits the bill! I added more basil than it called for (personal preference), cooked the peppers whole and then removed them before serving, and added 1 extra tsp sugar. Served with rice. 6 sgs = 4 individual meals for our family (2 adults).

Yum! Replaced chili peppers with a teaspoon of pepper flakes and swapped the garlic salt for an extra minced garlic clove. Also stir fried rice noodles with the onions and mushroom - easy and delicious meal to prepare!

This made a lot of extra sauce, so next time I'm going to try tossing it with some of those extra-wide rice noodles that come with Thai Drunken Noodles, I think that would complement the dish perfectly. I left out the garlic salt and added an extra clove, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. We loved it, and did not find it too salty, and I'm pretty salt-sensitive. Maybe a good strategy is to start with two tablespoons of oyster sauce, then taste it frequently as you add more. My guess is that some oyster sauces are more salty than others.

This was delicious. If you like spicy food, this is for you. I did what everyone else seemed to do and up the garlic to 5 cloves, 1 cup of water and 1/2 c oyster sauce because I was planning on adding udon noodles at the end. Noodles sucked that juice right up. I also used those little frozen basil cubes you can find in the freezer section instead of fresh because the grocery store didn't have fresh. I used a little more than half the tray and it tastes great! I almost had to wear a mask cooking this because it was so spicy, I was coughing! Thanks for the great recipe.

Being that this was the first time I cooked Thai food, I was nervous. I cut out the chili oil and took out one pepper and it turned out to be perfectly spicy. Really, really delicious recipe. Can't wait to make it again!

Four stars with dry basil. I am guessing it'll be five with fresh. Nice flavor. I used 1/3 tsp garlic powder vs 1 tsp garlic salt to cut down on saltiness.

I have used this recipe a bunch of times and it is always a hit with family and guests.  I like to serve it over linguine.  I recommend using a lot of onion even if you are not a huge fan.  The taste of the onion is not heavy and it lends an excellent texture to the meal.  The 2 Tablespoons of Chili Oil make it very hot.  I use 1.5 T Chili Oil and 1.5 T Sesame Oil and 5 Thai Chilis.  The Sesame Oil adds a nutty taste that I enjoy.  I also use about 2.5 lbs of chicken and it finishes with a good amount of heat.  I think the flavor is also enhanced when you use Thai Basil.  If you can get it at an Asian Grocery Store or an International Market, I would recommend taking the time to do it.  Side note; Thai Basil really makes lasagna shine.  I always make the two dishes back to back.  

I was hesitant to use the oyster sauce at first but it does add a nice flavor to the finished product. I only use about 3 T though.

This recipe was fantastic! I couldn't believe the taste of this. It was a flavour explosion, literally in my mouth.
I also didn't add the chili oil and just used a good olive oil. I also tossed in cilantro as well as some lime juice at the end. MmmmmM

Everyone should try this. Here's a tip, use red onion!

Very good dish. It ended up not being spicy since I didn't use chili oil and just used 2 dried peppers. But that's okay for my family. They even said I could fix it again. :)

This is really tasty and quick and easy. I ran out of Oyster Sauce - used about 3.5 tbsp so I used some tips from other reviewers and added some water. I would have liked more oyster sauce but would still add some water. I used twice as much garlic and left out the garlic salt. I used lots of basil and served over rice vermicelli. I think I would prefer it with rice next time. Really good.

Despite being rather heavy on the onions, I really enjoyed this dish. I served it with jasmine rice. It was fragrant and tasty.

Sooo good. A bit too spicy for me but my husband loved it, eating the red Chile peppers whole. I had my warm green tea so that levelled the spicy. So excellent with the basil. Will definately make again.

I made this dish for dinner tonight, substituting tofu for the chicken, and I have to say it was pretty amazing. I did cut down the oyster sauce to roughly 2 Tbs instead of 5 and it was still a little too strong on its own, but perfect mixed into rice.

The basil really makes this delicious dish! I am gluten intolerant and my husband is allergic to shellfish, so I replaced the oyster sauce with  2tbs fish sauce, 2 tbs tamari, and 1 tbs honey. I also added sliced red peppers and green beans.  Excellent!

This recipe was great! A little on the spicy side though - I will use 1/2 chili oil, 1/2 olive oil in the future. (I ended up adding some brown sugar to combat the spiciness and it still tasted awesome.)

Also, I turned this into more of a stir fry and threw in some Sugar Snap Peas and Baby Carrots along with the Mushrooms. And I chopped some Cilantro with the Basil... Served with Coconut Rice instead of White Rice & it was FANTASTIC!

Best Thai food I ever tried at home!  I substituted serano peppers for the chili peppers (store didn't have any chili peppers) and it was excellent with the substitution.  If you like your food spicy this is for you!

Loved this recipe..definitely a keeper.  I used all of the ingredients except for the onion and mushrooms.  I added red bell pepper. I also omitted the garlic salt, and upped the cloves of garlic to 4.  Like other reviewers, I added a cup of water when adding the oyster sauce, to give more sauce and cut down on saltiness.  This definitely had some kick, but I also did not take the seeds out of the peppers.  I like my Thai food spicy.  I used rice noodles and this was outstanding!

Super tasty!!! But very spicy. I've never used some of the ingredients before and had to go on a hunt but well worth it it. I was a fool in thinking more chili oil would be a good idea, stay with the recipe or use less of the spicy stuff, or use olive oil !! Great as left overs as well. I replaced the basil with green onions, still great

Really good. Very close to a Thai rest near us. I upped the chiles a bit much the first time and it was almost too hot to eat. I also used about a cup of water and some corn starch to thicken it up at the end. We like some sauce for the rice so it was perfect for us.

Great recipe.  I couldn't find chili oil so I used 1 tbs. olive oil and 1 tbs. toasted sesame oil.  I used 4 tbs. oyster sauce to reduce sodium as other reviewers suggested, and it was perfect.  Had trouble finding peppers with enough heat, so added a little crushed red pepper.

This dish was phenomenal. I put all of the seeds from the chili peppers in, and it was a little too spicy for my taste, though I love spicy food. Next time, I would use just two chili peppers. I also omitted the mushrooms and added red and green bell peppers instead. Delicious!

This was very easy and very tasty.  And boy... they weren't kidding when they said spicy!  I used 3 peppers like the recipe suggested and it was a bit much. I think next time I'll use just 1 or maybe 2.  But, the flavor was great!

I'll admit I was a little dissapointed. I expected more after reading all the great reviews.  It was good.  I expected superb!  Adding the fresh basil added wonderful flavor & improved the dish. I did use chile paste plus veg. oil instead of chile oil.  Used one large pepper only.  My husband said it was good but not sure if he'll request  again.

I've made this twice now and I LOVE it!  This time I used ground turkey, the texture was different but much easier to make and still quite good.  I think I may even try to make this while camping this summer - my friends will be amazed!

Absolutely delicious! This turned out as good as the chili basil chicken at my local Thai restaurant. I did cut the oyster sauce back to 3T after reading others' reviews and I used bell peppers instead of mushrooms. I had jalapeno peppers and used only about half the amount in the recipe. It turned out plenty hot enough for everyone at the table. This recipe is definitely going into the regular rotation.

I was looking for a chicken and thai basil recipe and came across this one.  It was great.  The only changes I made were: olive oil and japaleno and serano peppers. I served it over rice noodles. It was as good as my husbands favorite selection at our neighborhood Thai restaurant.

This was great, very authentic, I used thai chili sauce instead of the chili oil and chili peppers, and it was great.

This dish was really good. I altered it a bit, but it was awesome! I didn't like the mushroom (not big on mushrooms). I added yellow bell pepper, yellow onion, and made it extra spicy for my spice level! Thanks! I give it two thumbs up!!!

Thank you! This was fantastic and fast! The recipe really lent itself well to the substitutions I needed to make; red pepper flakes  and hot chili sesame oil instead of chili peppers, a little fish sauce instead of oyster sauce. If I were going to make this again, I wonder... what KIND of hot chile pepper should I get?

This is a great recipe, it is easy to make and combines a lot of different flavors. Both my boyfriend and I agreed this should be added to favorites. I made a few modifications, I omitted the chilis as he is a bit of a weiner and cannot handle heat. I added half a fresh red pepper and a 1/2 a cups worth of bean sprouts as we had it in the fridge fresh.

I did not have the chili oil so I used olive oil instead.  Also did not have the hot chili peppers so I used jalapeno pepper instead.  I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  It turned out delicious with nice bite!  Would definitely make again using the chili oil and pepper!

Very good, but I used the thai sweet chili sauce instead of the oyster sauce (and omitted the sugar). I did not have chili oil or hot chilis so improvised with chili powder. I also added some water to create a sauce and served it over pasta. I definately will make it again, but might add some finely chopped tomato for more color. (Hint: don't eat this while breastfeeding! Woops, unhappy baby today!)

Excellent!  I took other reviewers suggestions and did the following: eliminated the oyster sauce and garlic salt and used a little fish sauce instead; added some broth, carrots, scallions and mushrooms.  Served it with brown rice for a hearty, healthy, and filling meal. Next time I might add some lime juice.

Very easy to make and good flavors, but I have to agree with a lot of other reviewers... very salty.  Cut down on fish sauce and no garlic salt needed!!  I would maybe add some vege/chicken broth to make a bit more saucy.  Chili oil and 2 serrano chile peppers gave just enough heat... any more peppers would have been too hot for my taste (but I'm a wimp!).  I would also add another onion to give more substance.

This was good, but I do think it needed more sauce and some more veggies other than the mushrooms and onions.. maybe water chestnuts and carrots? Anyway.. I also didn't add the full amoutnof peppers because I thought it would be too hot. Next time I'll add more.

I can't begin to say how great this recipe is but I'm going to try.  I was attempting to reproduce my favorite recipe from my favorite Thai restaurant, and I think I've come close.   I have made this twice in the last week.  The first time I didn't make it very spicy and it had a wonderful sweet flavor.  The second made my lips catch fire!  It was great both times.   Both times I did the following: I do not have chili oil, so I used 1 T sesame and 1 T olive oil.  A heaping tablespoon of minced garlic and skipped the garlic salt.  Definitely less than 1 tsp fresh black pepper (I get bored of grinding).  Did 3 T Vegetarian Mushroom Oyster Oil and 2 T Hoisin Sauce.  I also added a red bell pepper with the mushrooms/onion.  And I love basil so I did about 3/4 cup coarsely chopped basil leaves.   For the heat - the first time I added 1.5 tsps of a red pepper mix that I picked up from the above mentioned Thai restaurant.  The 2nd time I used the same amount of the red pepper mix but threw in a VERY HOT large red pepper, finely chopped.  My lips are still on fire and I want more.  Thanks!

This dish was delicious!  We served it for 5 people and the only alteration we made was adding 2 teaspoons of fish sauce and about 4-5 teaspoons of soy sauce in place of the oyster sauce.  WARNING:  We used habanero peppers (3 red ones).  They added a tasty kick to the dish, but my finger tips were on fire!  For those that have never experienced a similiar feeling, I will liken it to dipping your fingers into a boiling volcano. We tried vinegar, rubbing alcohol, and the only relief came from soaking my finger tips in a tub of cold sour cream. Upon removing my fingers, the horrific fire-like sensation lasted until the sleep aid kicked in-seriously.  All fingers were fine the next morning.  I will NEVER make the mistake of touching those again!

We loved this recipe, however we did make some adjustments. I added maybe one of the hot peppers rather than three. It was hot enough for me, I don't think I could have eaten it if I had added all three. I also added a little less than 5 tablespoons of oyster sauce because it is so strong.

This was delicious. Even my father, who highly prefers traditional Punjabi cuisine, enjoyed this chicken and had seconds. Note: I had to add a few tablespoons of water towards the end, as the chicken was not fully cooked and was beginning to stick to the pan. Also added a pinch more salt and cilantro for extra flavor. Marinating over night helped too. So easy! A definite keeper :) Thank you for this recipe.

Pretty good, not out of this world, i.m.o. My store was out of real oyster sauce, so I had to use "oyster-flavored sauce." Following other reviewers I used 3 T. and that was plenty.

Definitely adding this to the repertoire. It only needs 4 tbl of oyster sauce, other than that it's great as is. Very authentic flavor! I used a tsp of red pepper flake instead of the chile peppers (just me, being lazy) but it came out perfect.

Enjoyable recipe...I used a habenero pepper, and it definitly kicked it up.  It almost seemed the flavors had trouble meshing...kind of a spicy thai with italian flair...that being said, I will probably try it again.

My whole family loves this recipe and it is so easy to make. We like it much better without the addition of the basil though.

Loved it!  I didn't use the garlic salt either - just some powder.  I quartered my jalapenos.  Very hot and spicy!

Yum! Just like a restaurant! Made just a few changes: didn't add shrooms, used crushed red pepper & chili paste w/garlic instead of peppers, added 1/2c h20 to give it more sauce.  Served on jasmine rice w/eggrolls on side! also, steamed green beans & quick fried them in chili oil & garlic chili paste - very good! Will make again very soon!

This was a phenomenal, easy dish to prepare. I followed the recipe pretty closely and found it had great flavors. I used poblano peppers, which were not all that spicy; next time will use a spicier pepper, but it's good to know I can also make this for some family members who prefer milder food. I made some jasmine rice to serve with it; perfect combo. This is a definite one to make and experiment with again. Thank you!
