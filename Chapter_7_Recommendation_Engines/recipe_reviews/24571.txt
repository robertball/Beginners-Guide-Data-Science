I boiled the water before adding it to the brown sugar and this was FANTASTIC!!! I halved the recipe because of the mixed reviews but there was nothing wrong with this recipe at all.  I didn't find it any sweeter than french toast with syrup.  I added 1/4 tsp of vanilla to the carmel sauce after it cooked and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the egg mixture. Other than that, I didn't change anything and I ended up eating all four pieces myself ( I even ate one cold and it was GREAT!!!) If your brown sugar turns hard, if you add boiling water it will eventually disolve into a delicious carmel sauce.  Be patient and keep stirring...it's worth it!

I didn't read the reviews on this one before I made it, I just thought wow, that's not a bad idea and went to throw it together.  I suggest you read the reviews first.

I've never actually made caramel before, so I just followd the directions exactly...
     After I was done making the bread I put the brown sugar in the pan, over a medium heat.  It took quite a while to start melting, and before it reached the consistency I was waiting for it began to smell like it was burning.  When it was nearly all melted, I added the water (which was room temperature).  The sugar instantly hardenend (makes sense).  Obviously, there was no way to dip anything in this rock hard sheet of sugar that was floating in water, so I waited and stirred.  Pretty quickly, it began boiling and the sugar was slowly melting back into the water.  By now it definitely smelled funny.  I thought, maybe that's the way it's supposed to smell (remember, I've never made caramel before).  I continued cooking it until the sugar was basically all melted/combined with the water.  Then I dipped a piece of french toast in it and tasted it; It tasted funny, too.  
   In the end, we had french toast the old fashioned way last night, with syrup.  I think I should have read the reviews first, but regardless, seems like a lot of extra work for something that (aside from the burned taste) was not that great a substitute for good old-fashioned syrup.

I found the best way to make the carmel sauce was after cooking all the french toast,add another tbsp of butter to pan then add the brown sugar stirring constantly.  When it starts to melt ( in about a minute over medium heat, no higher) SLOWLY add the boiling water to the pan a little bit at a time.  You can even try to add small amt of extra butter to thicken it a little.  i ended up not using all of the water and just added what I needed to get it to the consistency I wanted.  When all of the sugar is melted, you can gently boil it for another minute.  The key is to keep the flame no higher than medium and stir constantly.

This was really good and very easy to clean up.  It only took a couple minutes to make (and eat)  I halfed the recipe.  I found no problem with making the caramel, unlike others that reviewed it.  It's a keeper.

Quite tasty. Not sure I did the carmel sauce right, it was kinda watery. But that's ok.. This was kinda of a lot of work (and pans) for breakfast. But that's not to say I won't make it again. Garnished with cool whip and cinnamon-sugar.

Simple, easy, and very good too. I loved the built in syrup idea. It didn't really "caramelize" though which is good because I had a recipe last week that did and made the worst mess on my dishes and I literally had to scrape the caramel sugar off those. But back to this recipe, the sugar syrup needs to cook a little more though on a lower heat as mine was starting to get a toasted sugar smell and it wasn't all melted yet. I ended up using quite a bit more butter than called for. I really enjoyed this and preferred this over the traditional maple syrup on plain french toast. Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic.  My family loved it.  I made stuffed french toast using strawberry flavored cream cheese between to slices of toast then caramelized it.  First time I had the pan too hot and the caramelizing didn't work so well.  I let the pan cool down a bit and it worked so much better.  Thank you for the recipe.

I love the idea of Caramelized French Toast, so first of all Kudos to he cook who came up with the idea. But to start, frying french toast in butter is not such a good thing unless you want really dark brown toast. High heat will turn your butter dark brown. I suggest a butter spray to "cook" the toast. Add your butter at the end when you add the brown sugar and then add only about a quarter cup of warm water, slowly! Your caramel topping will taste less burnt and more sweet and smooth. You could also add an eighth teaspoon of vanilla. Great winter recipe. Fast, easy to make, just use common sense.

Delicious!  What a great twist on french toast.  I was little worried that the recipe wasn't going to work for me with the caramel sauce, because the sugar wouldn't melt.  I had to add a little bit more butter (probably two tablespoons) to the pan and then the sugar started melting.  I did cook the sauce down for a few minutes before putting the french toast back in to thicken it up a bit.  And the only difference I did was to add less eggs, because we don't like our french toast so eggy.  This will be a definite keeper for Sunday breakfast.

Very good! followed directions, and read the reviews. for the caramel, used boiling water. After adding water, boiled it down for a couple minutes, removed from heat and let cool slightly, about 1-2 minutes, then dipped the french toast..got a better coating with the cooler, thicker caramel sauce.

I really wish I had read reviews before I made this. The caramel sauce DID NOT WORK. Had I stopped before I added the water it would have been fine. But I didn't, I decided to follow the recipe to the end and add the water (even tho I had a perfect sauce for drizzling) and the water caused my caramel to seize. Bummer. Maybe the original author can amend the recipe?  A beginner baker/cook could really get confused by this.

This was very easy and fast.  I used boiling water to add to the brown sugar and it worked just fine.  It always pays to read the recipe reviews before trying a new recipe - it pays off.  My husband liked this a lot, we were out of syrup so this made his morning.  I dusted a little powdered sugar for garnish and he ate it up.

i've tried doing a French toast this way since I was 12....but i wanted to add some cinnamon into the caramel because i think it's fancier and appealing to the taste buds. plus, cinnamon has a health benefit too!

I made this one morning for breakfast for my husband and my 5 year old daughter. Breakfast is our favorite meal and we love french toast. I was worried at first that this recipe may have been too sweet but it was DELICIOUS! I'm excited to make it again and my family LOVES it.

We had this for dinner tonight, along with scrambled eggs and bacon. We loved it. My husband proclaimed it "excellent". I cut 4 thick slices of a homemade loaf of white bread, and followed the recipe for making the french toast. 

I halved the recipe for the caramel sauce.
To make the sauce, I added about 1T of butter into the pan, let it melt down, then added 1/2c of brown sugar, and then 1/4c HOT water. After it had bubbled and thickened a bit, I added a little milk. It did not harden (it did not cook long enough to get to that stage) and it had the consistency of syrup. We poured some of the extra sauce over the french toast. Delicious! Thanks Anne!

Wow. One of the things I love about this website is finding easy and unique recipes. This is one of them! I made this for breakfast this morning and had two pieces. I could've easily eaten two more! Other family members told me this was the best french toast they have ever had. Thanks to other reviewers suggestions I also added hot water to the brown sugar, and turned the heat down to low when I added the sugar. Make sure you stir constantly because the sugar will burn! Also, adding hot water to the pan as soon as you are done cooking really does make clean up a snap! Thanks for a recipe I will use again and again!

Really good. Next time I will use only 1/2 c brown sugar because I had a lot of extra sauce. I dipped only one side of each piece and that was sweet enough for us.

Easy to make for a quick breakfast.  My wife made some fresh homemade bread last night and this proved good use for one loaf.  This is very rich tasting.  I added a little more butter to help the brown sugar with melting, not sure I did it perfectly.  I was waiting for the caramel color...it just gets a dark brown when it is done.  The family loved this, and my kids are picky eaters when it comes to new meals.  It's a keeper!

I just tried this recipe and it made a beautiful french toast but, I did not find it that flavorful. My first attempt at making the syrup was a miss; for the second attempt I remembered a technique of submerging the sugar in the suggested water amount and allowing it to boil in that fashion; I added Mexican cinnamon sticks during the boiling processes as well as a tsp. of vanilla. My family enjoyed more than I did.

My caramel sauce was thin - but I think perhaps less water, more butter would help that. Kids loved it. Messy, but delicious.

I just made this it was a big hit came out fine. Very easy. The caramel sauce was not too bad to make. I used boiling water as per the reviews. I cut slices from some left-over Italian rolls I bought yesterday for sandwiches, instead of using regular bread. Oh and I added a 1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon to the egg mixture.

Good start with recipe, but it could use more detail.  Caution regarding the carmel; burns very quickly...decreasing heat from medium would be helpful in directions.  Also, seems the amount of carmel is extensive in directions with full coating...pic shows carmel drizzle which seems more appropriate.

awesome!! i followed some of the reviewers suggestions, I added some cinnamon to the egg mixture, and I boiled the water before adding the sugar, and when that was done I added a few drops of vanilla ( the recipe was halved ) and it turned out great! it wasn't too sweet like some people were saying. definitely making this again! :)

REALLY, REALLY GOOD! Let me just say that I am not a big fan of French toast. I have tried several recipes, but have never really liked the taste. I tried this recipe today because my hubby was at work and I can experiment if it is only me eating :) Anyway, I followed the directions for the toast, adding a Tbsp. of cinnamon to the egg mixture. It tasted so good that I almost didn't make the sauce. - I did end up making it, but i think I messed it up a little. My brown sugar turned hard and then looked really dark brown after adding water. I don't know if that is the way it should look, but it tasted pretty good. I had to strain out the hard lumps of sugar to get the sauce, so that was kind of a hassle. I would ask that there be more specific directions to making the caramel sauce, but other than that, it is great. I will definitely make again (and perfect my sauce making). Thanks!

I loved this french toast, I thought it was delicious!  There should've been a bit more clarification in the directions about how to do the last step, but hey I worked it out and enjoyed it very much!! **UPDATE** I make this ALL the time now, I actually prefer this syrup over the normal store bought stuff.....and it's so easy to make, I can't be bothered getting the other syrup out of the cupboard!  Thanks soooo much for this new TNT recipe!!

WOW! Made this for Sunday morning brunch. I used a whole loaf of Sourdough bread and we only had a piece and a half left(we have decided however not to get our blood sugar tested today!). Made the caramel sauce, I just added a bit of vanilla to mine, it came out beautifully. (You can over work the sugar and it will seize and be grainy so maybe that is what happened to the other reviewers) I also added some sliced bananas, YUMMY sounds everywhere! Thanks for a great recipe!

Everybody loved this, but I gave one less star for the weird step with the caramel.  Per other suggestions, I added boiling water soon after the brown sugar, but still ended up with little caramel rocks!  I boiled it for a while, though, and just dipped the bread in the pan, then sprinkled the toffee "crisps" over the top.  We, too, used almond instead of vanilla and topped it all with whipped cream.  Everyone had extra helpings!

These were fantastic! If you've never made caramel, you should read some notes because it's easy to mess up. I made mine in a separate pan, cooking slow and low, while I cooked the toast. These were scrumptious!

Basically just french toast with caramel. I used half the amount of eggs and it turned out wonderfully! The caramel wasn't as easy as it sounded (mine turned out rather nicely but it had some gravel-like sugar left). I don't think the two go particularly well, but good effort.

I read several reviews 1st & then added both vanilla & cinnamon to the egg/milk mix. I also didn't use as much butter, added no salt & used egg whites only. It was a very sweet treat for breakfast. I also added the brown sugar to boiling water & added walnuts while carmelizing & just drizzled the nuts & suace over the toast. Was a quick & easy recipe. Definitely enjoyed.

Love it! We've had this french toast every sunday morning for a month. My husband begs me to make it! The people with the burned carmel might need to turn the heat down a little. I also add a little extra butter to the pan before adding the brown sugar....super yummy. Thanks for a great recipe that'll surly by a staple in our family for many years to come.

This is GREAT. HOWEVER i believe the writer should edit it and assist those who haven't had their coffee yet-since this is a breakfast dish ;P About the adding boiling water to the last stage-less of chance of burning mess. I did so with white sugar (didn't have brown) and it came out great!! I added a lil cinnamon to give it lil more flavor. This is a great way to have french toast if your missing maple syrup from you pantry-it's so delish and tasty you can go sans syrup. YUM.

We were running low on syrup so I wanted to try this. My husband said he would just use up the last of the syrup because he didn't want to try it. I asked him to just try it and is he glad he did! He thought it was awesome! We will definitely make this again soon! I made the french toast on a griddle and made the "syrup" in a saucepan. I melted 2 tablespoons butter over low heat and stirred about 3/4 cup brown sugar into the melted butter. I boiled about 1/2 cup water in a ramekin in the microwave and added the boiling water until it reached the consistency that I wanted. I just whisked in the water a little at a time and it turned out perfect! I did keep the heat at medium low. I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the eggs and I was going to add vanilla and milk but we didn't have milk so I added french vanilla coffee creamer. We used potato bread. I also added chopped pecans and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. This was an amazing breakfast! Thank you!

Hmm, not bad, but I like regular french toast with syrup better.  I took other reviewers' advice to use boiling water, but I still don't think the caramelization was right.  The sugar smelled (and tasted) kind of burnt before it even finished melting, and it still left hard pellets of sugar once I added the water.  I'm not sure how long you're supposed to cook it after adding the water...I went about 2 minutes and it still hadn't melted the pellets but I was getting worried about the burnt smell.  I cooked it over medium high heat (7) as the recipe recommended...maybe it needs a lower heat??  I thought it was ruined, but it still tasted ok so I guess it wasn't a total loss.  But it was a lot of work for something that was quite similar to (and not quite as good as) maple syrup.  Thanks anyway.

This was a great variation!  I used my own batter recipe and then put the french toast in the brown sugar/h20 mixture.  Took the advice of others and added my water super hot.  Also - be sure you wait until it thinkens a bit - otherwise you'll just make your french toast soggy.  We all loved it, and if you immediately soak the plates and pan in hot water, clean up will be a breeze!

Yes, it is much less of a mess than caramel rolls. No, we will no longer be buying maple syrup. My only suggestion is to try using hot water to add to the melted sugar, it is less likely to harden the sugar and allows for a smoother syrup. Tastes great! Thanks!

Some of the best french toast I've ever had. I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and added butter first and then the brown sugar followed by 1 cup of boiling water. Another suggestion I would make is to add more water than brown sugar, which is what I did and it came out to a perfect brown sugar glaze. Sprinkled with powdered sugar, fresh cut strawberries and bananas and it came out perfect. Thank you for the recipe.

Tasted really eggy, but that could have just been how I made it. The carmel tasted great, but make sure you add the water before it hardens too much. I forgot it and it got super sticky. But after I put the water in it was tasty.

Once I got this figured out, it was delicious. I burnt the caramel even though I used boiling water, like someone suggested. Once I did get it right, it was way too thin, even though I followed those directions too....I dipped the french toast in the thin mixture and then put it into another pan to heat & make a bit thicker. I just thought it was too difficult that early in the morning.

This is sooo much more of a hassle than cinammon rolls! I am a farely good cook and even my brown sugar burnt. I tried to boil the water like another rater suggested to save my brown sugar but it just turned into burnt brown sugar water that was pretty much black. I will definitely never make this again.

Even my picking husband loved it, without adding anything extra.  I did embellish on mine though ... I squeezed an orange wedge over the toast, and added sliced bananas and chopped walnuts.  I didn't have any whipped topping tough.  These went great the apple-brown sugar/maple sausage links.

I felt like French toast so I decided to try this new recipe for my fiancé. I added cinnamon to the egg mixture. I used less butter when frying the bread & most of the 4tbs in the caramelization process. I'm glad I read the reviews because boiling water made more sense & helped breakdown the sugar. You do have to watch the sugar because it can burn easy so I added the boiling water earlier leaving the sugar/butter on direct heat for only a short time. Overall a great meal, very filling, I used potato bread this time but next time may try a cinnamon swirl. My fiancé said it was the best he’d ever had because it was so different & didn’t need syrup although I did sprinkle w/ powdered sugar!

This recipe is probably, hands down, the best I have made for french toast! It is easy to follow and included ingredients that I already had. I used Cinnamon Swirl bread and it was amazing. The caramel part was a little tricky. Just let the brown sugar heat up, but not clump. Boil the water and then mix it in with the sugar. I mixed it for about 5-7 min to get my chunks out.But chunks or no chunks, best recipe yet!

The caramelization did not work for me. It turned hard & tasted aweful. My 7 year old, who loves brown sugar, wouldn't even eat it. I will not make again. Sorry.

The recipe directions should be revised.  The carmelization did not happen as described.  It must work for some, accoeding to the reviews, but not as written.  In reading the reviews of others, I will try this recipe with hot water the next time.  Otherwise, it will not be in my resipe box.

Carmelized french toast is very sweet and actually rather good.  However I personally feel it's a little to sugary for breakfast though it might be great for brunch.  I also found it a bit of a pain trying to get all the melted brown sugar off the frying pan.

It was ok.  With the brown sugar, it was too sweet.  Normally, we like to just use vanilla bean ice cream instead.

Very good. I used French bread and sliced them thick. Easy and quick to make. I did drizzle caramel sauce over the french toast instead of dipping.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  We really like almond, so I added some almond extract and cinnamon to the egg mixture.  I didn't read the directions carefully and still ended up with a great caramel sauce :-) After cooking all the toast, I melted 2T butter, added the brown sugar and water at the same time, let it cook down for a few minutes, and it was great!  No problems with it burning, hardening, or anything :-)  Great recipe! ...even though I did it wrong :-P

These are awesome, but the recipe has a flaw--when making the carmel sauce DO NOT wait until the brown sugar is entirely melted or when you add the water it turns to stone! If you add the water shortly after adding the brown sugar it turns out great. I dipped them in when it was still pretty liquid-y and it harded up on the plate. It was especially amazing with cinnamon bread! Tasted like carmel rolls! Three stars only because of the flaw in the instructions, otherwise a 5 - I will keep and make again when we have company.

Really tasty!  I poured the caramel into a spouted cup and we poured it over the French Toast like syrup.  YUM!  I did follow a previous suggestion and cooked the brown sugar in 2 Tab. butter.  Just as it almost melted and looked like it wanted to burn, I poured in boiling water.

This was very good.  Instead of regular sandwich bread, I chose to use french bread.  I also used a blend of creamer & milk, and then I drizzled caramel sauce on top of the french bread.  YUMMY!

Very good French Toast recipe.  I would change a few things next time. I would use less eggs 6 really is not necessary.  I would add cinnamon to the egg mixture.  I also added boiling water to the brown sugar mix (got this from a fellow reviewer). I did add cinnamon at this point.  Very good. My hubby told me to make sure I add this to the recipe box. I will make this again.

I am also not a french toast fan but this was nice. I was blessed to have read the reviews before attempting the recipe. And it help alot!!! My caramel sauce turn out perfect because of the tip to use boiling hot water and to control the heat by not having it up too high. My kids clean it out!!!!

I really like this recipe and I am not a lover of french toast. I was looking for something different to feed the family for breakfast and came across this recipe. One thing I notice is for a serving of 8 I was supposed to use 6 eggs that is too much. We wound up with 12 french toast (which we still devoured). For the caramel, I added the brown sugar and not fulling reading the directions, added half the water a few seconds later. But it turned out good because mine didn't turn hard. We will be enjoying this again very soon!

Tasted good, but the caramel sauce was too sticky to eat!  Directions say cook until sticky, but I think when it starts to bubble up it's about done!.. I let it simmer a couple more minutes and it was sticking to our teeth.. I drizzled over top of french toast!..

Yummy! Sweeter than my regular breakfast preferences, but if I'm in the mood for a sweet start, this is perfect! I'm glad I read the other reviews before I made this because I think that boiling water is crucial to making the caramel sauce.  In fact, I was having trouble getting the brown sugar to melt so I added the hot water before it was melted, and I had the perfect caramel sauce in less than 5 minutes. Other than boiling the water for the sugar-sauce, I made 2 minor changes: (1) I halved the recipe and (2) I added cinnamon to the egg mixture. I think it's also important to use butter as the recipe calls for: it adds a perfect dimension to the caramel sauce which neither shortening nor margerine would provide.

This is delicious and quite sweet; and it would be great with fruit (the tartness would pair nicely with the sweet sauce) and whipped cream.  This would also be a great desert served with fruit or ice cream!  Wow, imagine this sticky French Toast as a base for a scoop of ice cream, nuts, and hot fudge!

extremely good!  for a little different flavour, I also add a little drop of almond flavouring.  Definately need to go for a VERY long walk after these to burn off that extra calorie or two!  :)

I made this for my husband for father's day and we loved it. The carmelizing was a little off for me too. You have to control the tempurature. Next time I make it I will take the other advice of boiling the water first. I should've read the reviews first.  I might want to add cinamon and vanilla next time. The Brown sugar takes the place of maple syrup and you can sprinkle with powdered sugar. Yum! Still a good recipe.

This is absolutely the best french toast. I didnt change anything and it is great. I made this today for my family and everyone had great reviews. My husband likes his french toast very sweet and this hit the spot. This is definately a keeper in our household. Thanks for the great recipe. Lovada in Seattle.

This was fantastic!!  The key is using whole milk (or evaporated milk) and using real, unsalted butter!!!  This one's a keeper!!!

This french toast is delicious! This is the sort of meal you pay top dollar for in a restaurant. I did however mistakenly brown the butter before adding the sugar and the caramel sauce tasted a little burnt, so I recommend watching the butter very closely to ensure it doesn't over heat.

When I added the water I used cold water, so make sure you use hot water.  Even so I dipped the french toast into the carmel water and it still tasted great.  It was a great substitiute for syrup.  Even though my toast wasn't carmalized my fiance thought they were great!

Really good and does taste like a caramel rolls, without the hassle of using yeast and much quicker results. The clean-up required afterwards is well worth it!!!

i found this recipe when i had run out of maple syrup.  the french toast didn't even need syrup, they were sweet and my kids loved them.  i did need although more butter, after 2 slices the butter was gone in the skillet.  other than that, just remember to lower the heat when you add the brown sugar or else it starts to turn to candy.

This is a perfect start to your day.  I used challah bread that I had cut in one inch widths and made sure they were thoroughly soaked with the egg mixture.  Despite following the recipe and video, my sauce came out a little lumpy so I just buzzed it in the blender until smooth.  We loved this.  Thanks for sharing!

I often make French toast on weekends, so it was fun to change it up. Both my husband and my 23 yo son used the same word without hearing each others' comment - Amazing. I added a little  more butter to the pan with the brown sugar, and also tossed in some pecans that I had on hand. Oh, and I just happened to have some orange liqueur leftover from another recipe and this seemed like a good opportunity to use it up, so I mixed some of that in to the caramel sauce as well! Next time I make this I will also add some cinnamon to the sugar mixture. Everyone loved it, but my husband suggested that I save it for special occasions so they don't get spoiled and expect it every time.

I added pecans,vanilla & a little Butterscotch schnapps to the caramel as well as patience. I prepared it in a non-stick saucepan before making the french toast.  I took the suggestion from another review and boiled the water. Doing that cut the time.  If the brown sugar isn't cooked long enough, it can be very grainy.  It takes about 4-5 minutes to melt the brown sugar and butter (on low heat) to get a good caramel consistency.  When the french toast was done, I pour the pecan caramel sauce into the frying pan and coated the toast.  Served it with powdered sugar (I needed some leaves raked, so I figured a little more sugar would do the trick!)and whipped cream. Put some strawberries on the plate and voila, it was a big hit!

RE: carmel sauce. START with the brown sugar & butter only. When it starts to slightly bubble turn stove down & let it boil ever so gently & stir. That should be the end of any burning or any other problems. And of course what would it be without cinnamon, but not tooooo much.

Me and my daughter did this recipe just add it said EXCEPT we added the water (straight out the faucet) one spoon at a time and it didn't get hard or anything. That's the only thing o suggest is put the water in A LITTLE AT A TIME and it'll turn out great! Also Make sure u have enough butter in the pan and it shouldn't burn at all.

This is quite easy and yummy. My boyfriend wanted me to skip the caramelized sauce to save on calories.  It didn't take away the flavor. I did sneak in 1/8 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp vanilla and since I already had 1/2&1/2, I used 1/4 cup of that and 1% milk. Used lite syrup with the dish. Will make again.

WOW! I can't believe all the negative reviews on this AWSOME recipe! I am in no way a great cook, just dabble here n there. I added a bit of cinnamon to the egg mixture, and when I did the brown sugar part I added fresh cut strawberries just a couple minutes after starting the brown sugar. Let them soften together(maybe melting totally is the problem some have had) then added room temp water, and let simmer few minutes! Made me dream of opening a restaurant as soon as I tasted it! I didn't have any whipping cream but just imagined how much more AWSOME this French toast would have been! 

Thanks for sharing this AWSOME recipe!!!!

This was a big hit with my family! All of the kids are home from college and I was looking for something special to serve for our Saturday breakfast. Everyone said this was amazing and different from other french toast recipes we've tried in the past. Even the youngest who does not like french toast gave this one a thumbs up!

My problem was with the carmel. When i melted the sugar then added the water it turned into a hard ball. It did dissolve again but by then the sugar was burned. I tried again tried again on the sauce but this time I dissolved the sugar in the water first and then put it in the pan....that worked much better...

Oh I wish I had seen the reviews about boiling the water first! I just saw all the positive feedback and decided to give it a shot. My caramel sauce also ended semi-disastrous. I melted the sugar first and then added the water. My rational thought kept me from pouring the whole cup of water in, I added it slowly. But it still clumped up and became a little burned. Instead of having the REVIEWS with the right procedure, why doesn’t someone alter the original recipe for people like me?!

This recipe simply doesn't work as written.  I reduced the heat to melt the brown sugar, but it immediately clumped when I added the water.  By adding a bit more water, beating the clumps with the back of a spoon to break them apart, and slowly heating the mixture on low heat, I was able to dissolve the clumps.  We both found the taste to be disappointing since it tasted only of strong brown sugar.  The sauce was very sticky and unappealing, and the taste of the French toast itself was nothing special.  When I can't finish something I've made I have to give it one star.

I boiled my water before adding it to the brown sugar to prevent it from hardening, as other reviewers suggested.  Other than that, it was a good recipe.  Thanks

Warning: This recipe will drive your dentist up the wall! But I daresay it's worth it.
 Also, the instructions should be revised to add those helpful tips located in some of the reviews (ie. lower heat, add boiling water to sugar for smoother finish). Mine turned more into CANDIED French Toast rather caramelized. Other than that, the french toast was wonderfully sweet.

Aagghh... this made a sticky, gooey, super sweet mess out of breakfast and we loved it!  I think this was easy to make and it tasted great, but beware, you will probably need a tall glass of ice cold milk to go with this.  It was very rich and sweet.  I could only eat about half a piece.

This sure tasted like cinnamon rolls, but you must eat it fast as the sugar starts to harden immediately. I made sure to melt the brown sugar in a sauce pan and not the frying pan, as it will harden and crystallize. I will try this again!

Well, make sure your water added to the melted brown sugar is PIPING hot... mine wasn't and it hardened the brown sugar on contact.  No matter how much I heated it after that, I never got a good caramelizing mixture.  I'm disappointed, and probably won't try it again.

I made it. I read the other reviews. I added cinnamon to the eggs and milk mixture for the toast. I followed the reviews and added butter before the brown sugar and added the water boiling. With the cinnamon and the carmelized sugar it tasted like a cinnamon role. My husband loved it.

As per the reviews, I added boiling water when the brown sugar melted and it came out okay. But the first few slices of french toast soaked up all the caramel and there wasn't enough to go around.

Good.  I followed the tip of adding the brown sugar to hot water.   Also this was enough for an entire loaf of brioche bread from Trader Joe's.  There was actually leftover mixture still. Kids enjoyed it.

So good!! It tastes amazing and comes together pretty quick. My only complaint is that you really only need a fraction of these ingredients. Two eggs were plenty for 6 slices of bread though that could have something to do with using large eggs and standard grocery store bread.  My advice is to start with one or two eggs at a time; you can always add more! Same goes for the caramel sauce.  On that note, get the water in the pan IMMEDIATELY after dropping in the sugar to keep it from burning. Don't put the water in first though, because it will evaporate. Unless you start with the heat lower, but it's way quicker to use the same pan that's already hot. Anyway, this is about the fourth time I've used this recipe (obviously lol) and I keep coming back for more, so definitely give it a shot!

three words. DE-LIC-IOUS!

If you aren't worried about the health content when making this french toast, I recommend using a bit more butter than this recipe calls for. I started with the 2 tablespoons and added a tiny sliver of butter every 2-3 slices of toast. 

When doing the caramel sauce, allow the toast to simmer in the sauce(it will have a watery consistency) for a minute or two before flipping it so that the flavor soaks in to your break. 

Thanks for the awesome recipe! I will be making again!

The brown sugar syrup didn't turn out like I wanted it, but I will try again. I'm sure once I get the topping mastered this recipe will be 5 stars.

This is so delicious! I burned the caramel the first time. On my 2nd attempt, I melted butter, wisked  in half and half and the brown sugar and stirred for 7 minutes on medium heat. Easy and memorable; hanks for sharing!!

This was awesome, didn't even need the recipe once I read it!  Had to add more butter to the brown sugar to get it wet and melted then water and it turned out perfect!   This is definitely a new Christmas breakfast dish.  Used homemade bread also da best!

This was soooooooooo good!  All thumbs up here.  I will admit I had a Lil trouble with the Carmel,  but did figure it out.  And we'll worth it....  Will definitely make again.  I added vanilla and cinnamon to the egg mixture.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and thought it was delicious.  I do agree that making the caramel sauce was a little difficult as I have never made it that way.  I didn't get the brown sugar to melt as much as I think I was supposed to.  But the end result was little brown sugar pebbles which I thought added to the dish making the french toast a little crisp.  Very good!  I'm dreading cleaning the plan though!

We halved the recipe and followed the instructions exactly except for adding a little cinnamon to the dip. It was wonderful. Just don't turn up the flame on the sauce; barely boiling is the only way it works.

The french toast is wonderful but half the sauce crystalized on me, but it still had good flavor what didn't and with just half the sause we still had plenty. The sauce just taste like regular bottled syrup.

Loved this recipe even though i Burned the caramel sauce and couldn't use it. But the french toast came out great for my first time. Cant wait to try it again. I seriously wont screw the sauce again. I ran out of egg mixture so i could only do 6 slices. But it was still good with maple syrup

I love this recipe and plan to make it again soon.  The changes I made were adding 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamin to the egg mixture.  When making the caramel sauce, I heated 1 tbs of butter, then added the brown sugar.  After about 1 min, I slowly added boiling water and stirred constantly on medium heat for about 8 minutes.  Then I placed the bread in the sauce quickly coating both sides and put them on a warming plate til all were done.  The wife is not usually a fan of french toast but loved this and I did too.

well at first I thought it would be similar to the apple caramel we use on the pork chops, tho it was a little more sticky sweet. My kids thought it tasted just like syrup. I'd use less sugar perhaps....

I'm not sure if i did something wrong on this recipe but it was a complete DISASTER. I could not get the caramel to harden to save my life and it just turned into this runny syrupy concoction. I had just figured i did it wrong and i would try again next time, but when we took a bite into it, it just was not a very pleasant taste at all. Entirely too sweet and the taste just didn't mix with the toast at all. I can assure that i will not be trying this recipe again though.

The best and ready for company brunch! Only used half the eggs and milk for batter and added tsp. of vanilla extract. Will use almond extract suggestion next time if I have almonds on hand for topping. Used a small bagguette cut into eight pieces. Cooked these in two tbsp. of the butter and use the remaining butter in the sauce. Sauce cooked smoothly and perfectly with water from tap. Added water slowly and it began to steam immediately. Did add some pecans to finish.

I used a different French Toast recipe, I tend to like fluffier toast with flour, and some spices, but the carmelized part is EXCELLENT!
Who needs syrup?
