This is yummy.  We did ours frozen, in the blender, adding ice.

Yum yum yum! Thank you for this recipe. It is so good! We toasted coconut on the stove top, dipped our glasses in honey and the toasted coconut, did I say Yum?

It's definitely very tasty! I saw a recipe with coconut cream and I think this recipe would be better with that, but it's quite good as-is.

I accidentally got silver tequila instead of gold. Seems ok. I felt the need to add more coconut milk. I wasn't impressed as soon as I made it. It wasn't bad by any means!! Totally drinkable, but I think the citrus is a bit over done for a coconut-based margarita. The longer it sat in the fridge, the better it was. My second glass was a more blended flavor.

This was just ok.  I feel as if it was missing something.  I ended up adding more tequila (suaza silver) and more sour mix.  Don't think I'd make this again.
