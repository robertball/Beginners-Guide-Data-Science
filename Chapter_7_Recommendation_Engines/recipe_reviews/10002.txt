This is the worst cookie I have had. It was easy to make but as soon as I put them in the oven they flattened out like a pancake. Most cookies that I have had were nice and thick and these were not. I will not make them again.

A yummy fluffy peanut butter cake. I prefer to put a raisin ontop of each cookie before baking.

I made these for my kids as a treat after the first day of school and they all loved them. I substituted the shortening for butter. They came out pretty thin and it wouldn't hold the fork print for me. This was more annoying to me the kids didn't mind.

I was thrilled to find this! My mother in law who died a few years ago used to make these and they were my favorite peanut butter cookie. These are light thin and crispy. If you want a cakier cookie look elsewhere but these are just what I like. Will definitely make again.
