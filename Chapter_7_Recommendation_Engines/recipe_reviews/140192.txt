What a great way to get fruit, w/out a lot of extra added calories! I followed the recipe, pretty much as is (I even measured stuff!).  The only deviations I made were I did not have fresh mint, so I used a dash of mint extract, I left out the applesauce, and forgot to freeze the strawberries (I threw them in the ice in the freezer while I prepped everything and they actually got a little frozen).  The mint really makes this!  It's a little "frothy" in consistency; I may add some ice next time. I'd considered adding a little Captain Morgan to make it a grown up smoothie, but decided not to w/the frothiness.  I added some frozen grapes at service and I liked their addition.

Not only is it healthy it is delicious and beautiful! It looks like it has confetti in it, so light and refreshing. I used regular applesauce because we didn't have unsweetened. Still turned out great! Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

This was really good. I used green grapes instead of red since I had some already frozen, otherwise all the ingredients are as suggested. I did need to add the pineapple in w/ the applesauce,grapes & lime - there just wasn't quite enough to get things going in the blender. I added the stawberries & mint later, but decided to blend them smoother than suggested so we could use straws. Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked this and will make it again, but I could detect the applesauce - mostly texture-wise -  in it and that was the only thing I didn't like.  Maybe I'll try a little apple juice or pineapple juice next time, or blend in some unfrozen grapes.  Other than that, this was refreshing and tasty!  N*R

This was delicious!  I just made it for my mom and I, using mint extract instead of fresh mint leaves.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a really tasty mix of fruits, even though it sounds a bit odd. I left out the mint [couldn't find any]. I also, as I usually do, added a couple scoops of vanilla ice cream, it toned down the lime and thickened it up. The lime seems a bit strong and makes it somewhat tart, so if you don't like lime I would leave it out. I thought it was wonderful as is though.

Instead of grapes, I used frozen peach slices...apple juice mixed with plain yogurt instead of applesauce...a little honey to taste.  It did have a really appealing confetti appearance and tasted good too.  Love the mint flavor with the fresh fruit.  The second time I made it I used frozen red grapes, frozen blueberries, vanilla yogurt, apple juice, honey and mint.  I guess the fruit combinations you can choose to use are endless...

I gave this to my little friends and they thought the mixture was a little applesaucey and didn't like the mint in it. Me and my older friends loved it though.

I just made this smoothie and it is delicious! Instead of the applesauce, I used 1/4 cup yoplait light very vanilla and also placed a tea bag into 1/2 oz of water to substitute for the mint leaves. I wasn't left with the applesauce taste some persons complained about and it wasn't over bearingly mint; it was fantastic! Will make this again.
