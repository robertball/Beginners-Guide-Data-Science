These biscuits are quite good—light, fluffy, and tender—but just a smidge short of the biscuit nirvana I'm searching for. I will try making them again but topping them with butter.

I do think that the people who rated this recipe poorly likely used all-purpose flour instead of self-rising flour; self-rising flour contains both baking powder and salt, and a biscuit without salt would truly be wretched. If you don't have self-rising flour (as I didn't), use four cups of all-purpose flour, two teaspoons of salt, and two teaspoons of baking powder (in addition to the tablespoon that's already called for).

I used to bake biscuits for a fast food restaurant and I have some tips for those of you that have never made biscuits or that are struggling to get them right. 1. Never over-work your dough. Mix it only as much as you absolutely have to or it will be tough. 2. Don't add too much flour! flour can be affected greatly by the humidity in the air so what works today may not work tomorrow. Biscuit dough should NOT be easy to work with, it will be pretty sticky. If you add enough flour so that it is easy to work with your biscuits will be dry. 3. Your shortening should be left in small chunks (about the size of a pea) so that your biscuits will be flaky. You can substitute a little butter for part of the shortening to give a richer flavor but your biscuits won't raise as well.  4. Roll your biscuits to at least 1/2 in thickness (or more) to have nice high biscuits. When you cut them push straight down and straight back up. Twisting the cutter will cause your biscuits to raise unevenly. This is a good biscuit recipe, flaky and delicious but I'm still looking for the perfect flavor.

Great biscuits - easy to make, fluffy, and delicious! I cut the recipe in half, upped the sugar to 1 Tbsp. and used butter flavored shortening. I let the dough set in the fridge for a couple of hours to ensure the biscuits would rise high. I rolled out the dough on a lightly floured surface, cut out the biscuits and placed them onto parchment paper to bake. Instead of buttermilk, I brushed the tops with melted butter. These smell great and taste even better. What's great is the leftovers are perfect with breakfast the next day!

Great!  The reviewer who wrote the tip about using all-purpose flour instead of self-rising flour was right on!  That review said to use 4 cups of all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons of salt, and 2 teaspoons of baking powder (in addition to the tablespoon that's already called for).  That was perfect!  I had some guesswork with the temperature though.  I have dark, non-stick pans, which means that you lower the oven temperature 25 degrees, so I set it to 375.  The biscuits got VERY dark on the bottoms (almost burned), but the insides were still doughy.  On the second pan, I used parchment paper on the bottom of the pan, then raised the temperature to what the recipe called for - 400 degrees.  Perfect!  The bottoms weren't burned, and the dough was fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

All I can say about these are "WONDERFUL!"  I had been looking for a recipe that tasted like old fashioned biscuits and this was it. The only thing I changed was brushing the tops with butter instead of buttermilk. We loved the buttery salty taste on top of the biscuits. These rose beautifully. Looked like the ones on TV. Picture and taste perfect. OH and these freeze great! I tested them. I got to the cut dough part and froze individually on a sheet and put in bag. Then when I wanted a couple I just put directly in oven and baked as instructed. Yum!!!!
Thank Sandra for posting this recipe.

These biscuits are delicious!  I've tried many recipes to find the perfect texture and
these are the ones!  I used heavy cream instead of buttermilk.  I also let them sit on the
sheet pan for about a half hour before baking and that caused them to puff a little
and rise very nicely when baked.  Definitely a keeper.

These biscuits turned out very tender and flaky, but not very tasty, they needed salt and maybe baking soda.  My husband and I thought they tasted more like rolls than biscuits.  I don't think I'll make these again.

These biscuits are GREAT!  The only complaint I have is how sticky the dough is at the final stage.  It was just a little difficult to roll out.  I had to consistently sprinkle flour to keep from sticking.  Other then that little problem .. they are FANTASTIC!  To keep them moist ... they must be placed immediately after cooling in a storage container.  :)

I didn't have buttermilk so I used buttermilk powder.  They didn't turn out too good, way too sticky, but I think that is because of the buttermilk powder.  I ended up making drop biscuits and even though the dough was sticky, the biscuits were way too dry.  I will try these again and re-post soon.

These biscuits tasted okay, but I think I rolled them too thin. Also, I live in Denver, so I didn't know if I needed to take the altitude into account. First time I made homemade biscuits,I had fun making them!

We've used this recipe repeatedly now with good results.  I did not grow up around biscuits, so I am new to making them, and this worked well.  I've used all purpose flour w/ salt and baking powder, and self rising.  Both yeild decent results.  I like to let the dough rise for at least 30 min. in the bowl and then for another 10 in the pan after rolling and cutting, this yeilds much higher, lighter biscuits.

awesome recipe!  i have been looking for the pefect biscuit recipe for a while now, something to appease my craving when i can't get to the local cracker barrel.  IMPORTANT TIP----if you don't have self rising flour, add the additional 2 tsp baking powder and 2 tsp salt as recommended by some of the other reviewers.  i have a feeling this is why some people are not getting the proper results.  i did, however, omit the sugar.  didn't feel that was necessary since i'm making it savory purposes.  turned out great.  also, maybe b/c i used a whole milk buttermilk, there was a slight bit more tang than i'm used to.  i may just stick w/the plain old low fat buttermilk;  i just happened to have the whole milk kind on hand and it is much richer than low fat, i'm always tweaking my recipes.  also, for those who don't normally make their own biscuits from scratch biscuits-the dough is extremely sticky.  don't be afraid.  just dump about a cup of flour on your counter, turn out he dough, sprinkle more flour on top and knead about 10x.  make sure you flour your rolling pin and you'll have a perfect, soft dough to cut into.  i use a soup cn w/the ends cut out and it made about 12-13 biscuits.  i brushed the tops w/butter.  i may do that after baking next time instead of before.  in my oven, i baked for about 18min.  just keep an eye for browning.  all in all, quick, easy and delicious.  a keeper.  thanks.

I used this recipe for the biscuits topped with sausage gravy.  I would say that this recipe is worth saving, but there has to be something a bit better out there.  I did replace the self-rising flour with 4 cups flour, 2tsp salt, and 2tsp baking powder.  However next time I will bring the salt down to 1tsp as they were a bit salty.  They also had a slight "artificial flavor" using CRISCO as my shortening.  Perhaps I may be able to experiment with 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.  I will be keeping this recipe but still on the lookout for the "perfect" buttermilk biscuit recipe out there.  Thanks for sharing.

Last night I was looking for a simple recipe for biscuits and I found a winner.  I didn't have self-rising flour, so I used regular flour and added one cup of bisquick to it.  I also added a little extra sugar.  Be sure when you are rolling the dough out you don't roll it too thin, as your biscuits won't be as fluffy.  I also drizzled a little butter over the top before baking and they came out wonderful.  I was very pleased with them, as I have been known to bake hockey pucks.

I thought I might be disappointed with these since I’ve grown to like biscuits made with butter.  I wasn’t disappointed at all tho’ I did, however, brush them with melted butter and dill before baking, and again with melted butter once they came out of the oven. These were quite flavorful, light, fluffy, tall and tender. I don’t know what more you could ask for in a biscuit.  Oh – do not add salt.  Self-rising flour already contains it and these biscuits have just the right level of salt to enhance the flavor.

AWESOME, easy recipe! I took Evelyn in KC's advice since I don't have self-rising flour on hand and the biscuits were sensational! I did brush the tops with melted butter rather than buttermilk and my family is in agreement that this is a definite keep of a recipe. I will cut the salt down to 1 1/2 t next time I make this as they were just a tad bit salty...

These were really easy and delicious.  I don't keep self-rising flour around so I made my own (4 cups flour, 2 tsp. salt, 2 Tbsp. baking powder) then followed the directions, though I didn't brush them with buttermilk.  The were terrific.

Quick and easy. Very tasty. I used a 2-3/4" cutter and got 18 biscuits. They rose very nicely and took about 17 minutes to get lightly browned.

I've tried making buttermilk biscuit for several times, and this recipe is the best I've had so far. The texture was so soft and moist. I didn't roll out the dough cause I was in a hurry preparing dinner, instead I used a 1/3 cup to spoon out the dough and made it a drop-biscuit (instead of roll-out biscuit). Thanks for sharing this WONDERFUL recipe. Will make & bake again anytime soon!

I've searched for a long time for a buttermilk biscuit recipe that makes a biscuit that was fluffy and full of flavor. THIS IS IT! For those having trouble, I suggest kneading very lightly, as too much kneading makes them tough. Also, I knead and roll them out in all-purpose flour because the extra self-rising flour seems to give them an acidic taste. Good biscuits require practice and close attention to detail, but are far worth it, especially in comparison to the ones that plop out of a round tube.

I mix all dry ingredients then take out 1/2 cup to work in while I am rolling them out.  worked great still had leftover flour.  I flatten them out, then fold over and over.  The dough should be light and workable.  THats why you hold out the flour.  I had no problem with sticky dough..Put them touching on the pan and they will rise good.  I use an iron skillet.  I seperated the dough and added colby cheese chunks and a sprinkle of garlic to half..delicious.

Well now, these were just terrible.  I made them exactly as directed, and they were very pretty.  They also taste like fluffy balls of flour.  What a disappointment after such a nice presentation!  I got the "yuck face" all across the table, so I'm glad it was just family.  I would have been embarrassed to serve them to guests.

I have been trying for all ten years of my marriage to find a good recipe and this is it! Thanks for posting and thanks everyone for all the tips! Use shortening, self-rising flour, use buttermilk and don't over work. I love these and so does my family.

Amazing!! They were more moist than I had expected them to be, which made me nervous, but in the end, they really are delicious.

These were awesome biscuits!  Even the dough was tasty!  I didn't have the self-rising flour, so used extra baking powder and salt.  Very tasty.  My husband loved them too!  
  Next time, I will leave out about half the sugar, and flour the counter better.  The dough was insanely sticky, so I ended up just using my hands.  Very, very good.

The recipe is great! I, however, like to use 1/3 c shortening and 1/3 c butter,to keep the flakiness, but to add a buttery flavor! Wonderful and heavenly!!

I don't know what happened, but my dough turned out extremely sticky, so I made drop biscuits instead of using cutters. These took way longer than 15 minutes to bake, and  even with melted butter on the tops, I felt as if something were missing. They weren't bad, just not what I had imagined. I'll try again.

I thought these biscuits were fairly good.  They definitely needed some more salt.  Next time I make them, I will follow what previous reviewers said and brush them with salted butter instead of buttermilk.  On the positive, these were very light and fluffy biscuits that were also very easy to make.  I halved the recipe and had enough for my husband and I to eat them twice.

With a wheat insensitivity, I substitued the self-rising flour with a spelt flour (added Baking Powder and salt to make it self-rising).  Rolled out on floured surface.  Best biscuits ever.  Light and fluffy, very tasty.

you definately have to use self rising flour OR do as others have suggested with AP (add an extra 2 tsp salt, 2 tsp b powder) otherwise you will get bland gross biscuits as others have! Very light and fluffy, great with gravy! They were so sticky there was no way I could roll them so i just made drop biscuits. Thanks!

Do not make these biscuits.  You will eat too many of them and become large.  They're wonderful!

I used sifted whole spelt flour (very similar to whole wheat), 1/2 cup of butter and only needed 1 cup of buttermilk.

I rated the "Kid Friendly" five stars.  I'm 15.  Am I still a kid?

These biscuits are AWESOME!  I did as another reviewer suggested and added extra baking powder and salt to my regular all purpose flour mixture and they came out perfect.  I do not bother rolling them out, I just spoon in heap on to sheet.  They were dense but fluffy, and crispy on outside but moist on inside, just the recipe I was searching for.  Perfect to serve with creamed chipped beef or sausage gravy, or just with a pat of butter or just by themselves.  Thank you for posting!

WOW! I followed the advice for adding salt and extra baking powder as recommended and I cannot believe these.  So light and tasty.  Only thing I did different was to add melted butter on top when they came out of the oven.  This will be the only biscuit recipe I will ever use now. Thank-you.

I used all purpose flour (and the extra 2 tsp. baking powder), made them into drop biscuits (because the dough was very sticky), and brushed the tops with melted butter before cooking. The taste was fabulous, and the texture was light and fluffy. I will definitely make these again!

These tasted the part but the dough was way too sticky to roll out. Not sure if this was because we did 1/3 of the recipe. However, we prepared them as drop biscuits which worked out fine. Instead of using buttermilk, we followed the recommendation of other reviewers and brushed the tops with melted butter before baking.

These biscuits are pretty good but I wish that they were a bit drier in texture.  My non-biscuit liking son loves these though and that is saying alot!  I used all-purpose flour rather than self-rising so I did what one of the previous posters suggested by adding extra baking powder and salt to the recipe.

This is perfect for me!  I love homemade bread, and occasionally whip out the breadmaker, but I'm not much on making it from scratch.  I don't have the patience for rising, punching, rolling, punching, rising...This was quick, easy, and they are so light and fluffy.  DELICIOUS. It makes homemade bread a possibility for me.

Simple, light, and delicious!  I cut the biscuits with a can, which worked great.  I forgot to brush the tops with buttermilk, and they still turned out nicely.  But don't expect them to get very golden-- they can be totally white but done to perfection.

Don't make this recipe if you're just starting a diet.  These are wonderful!  And thanks to the others who reviewed this recipe and offered tips about the self rising flour and freezing.  Great info and idea.  Also, if you don't have buttermilk (which I never do),  place a Tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice in a liquid measuring cup, add enough milk to bring the liquid up to the one-cup line and let stand for five minutes. I like to mix onion and garlic powder with butter and brush the tops for a little extra flavor.

A few tips: Use stick margarine instead of shortening or lard. NEVER use any of those creamy tub margarine spreads ( they contain alot of water and aren't fit for baking purposes )

handle this dough as little as possible. too much gluten makes for a terrible biscuit.

I use a cast iron skillet in a 400 deg oven as they need to rise up..not out.

let them sit out at room temp about 20 - 30 minutes before baking. they will rise better.

Take the time to butter one up as soon as you get it out of the oven. enjoy it before serving the rest of them.

Great! The first batch was lacking.  I did not have self rising flour,but other than that followed it to the "T". Second time...success! I still didn't have self rising flour, but I used butter flavored shortening, and that made all the difference. Will make again, and again, and again. (if you liked these, try "J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits" on this site (yum!)

I just made these biscuits and think they are wonderful.  My husband says they are the best biscuits I have ever made.  I am wondering if the people who thought they were bland just used regular flour in place of the self rising flour.  Self rising flour has baking powder or soda and salt so they should turn out very good.  I thought they were perfect.  Thank-you very much for the recipe.

they looked good, but they were so bland! i had a feeling they would be, based on other reviews and the lack of salt in the recipe. i wonder if the recipe was supposed to call for salt instead of sugar...?

These were just ok.  They spread out, which surpised me, and that made them too thin.  The flavor is sort of bland too.

The biscuits had a great flavor, but mine didn't rise very well.  I don't know if I did something wrong, but I will try again because, although they weren't too "pretty" the taste was good.

My buttermilk went sour on me, so I tried regular milk.  They still tasted great & were very easy to make.  My 14 year old daughter ended up making them!

11.22.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/17283/buttermilk-biscuits-i/ ... 'Added cooked (ground) sausage, precooked weight about half pound. 'Made these & "Best Buttermilk Biscuits".  These are better than those, but to say they're better than best would be too much.  Kidding, kidding.  I'll try 'em again without the sausage to have a more fair review; but, when adding sausage, I'll add the whole pound. I forgot to brush with buttermilk, but I will next time.  'Sounds good.  These appear cobbled like the photo.  That's not a bad thing, just something I noticed compared to others.

Well, I know how to cook biscuits, but for some reason I'm forgetting stuff all the time or not putting the right ratio of flour to shortening. Or sometimes I forget the baking powder and baking soda too. So, listen I think you have to add a half cup of sugar to these 4 cups of flour. And if your flour is already salty or you are using baking soda don't add any more salt. Especially if you're using butter milk. Now if you're having taste issues you can use butter instead of shortening or lard(animal fat). That should give you the light buttery goodness you seek. Or you can brush with butter once you pull the biscuits out of the oven. And are you browning the biscuits. Don't just use the oven bake use the broil setting for 5minutes.  I gave it a five, because it has the ratios I need.

I suppose if I used self rising flower, they might have been better. I only had bisquick on hand and I really needed to use my buttermilk. (it was fresh that I had from making butter) I cut recipe in half and used 2tsp of baking powder b/c Bisquick already has a leavening agent in it. I used a whole tablespoon of sugar and a cup of buttermilk and followed the rest of the directions the same. I normally follow recipes as written before I review them, but in case youaree in a pinch like I was, then you should still get good results. It's still not quite what I am looking for in a biscuit, but better than any I have done so far. Oh and they taste even better with my fresh made whipped butter on top!

I'd give them 5 stars if they'd had risen more.  And I patted the dough to at least 3/4"-1" thick. The flavor, however, was great.  The bottoms were kind of crispy, but not in a bad way. I baked them on a silpat-type sheet, so they didn't stick.  As per other raters, I brushed the tops with melted butter and not buttermilk.  The inside of the biscuit was so light and delicious.  This was the first time I've ever made buttermilk biscuits (with real buttermilk),  and if I ever happen to have buttermilk on hand again, I'll try this recipe again.

I used the all-purpose flour suggestion of 4c. all purpose flour, 2t. salt, 2t. baking powder. I also used parchment paper and brushed the tops with unsalted butter. I may have overworked my dough, and letting it sit on parchment paper may have been a good idea as suggested, but they were absolutely delicious, especially with spricot preserves spread on top, as pictured :)

I like these rolls. They came out really really good the first time I made them. I think I may be keeping them in the oven too long now. I take them out when they are a bit golden, but next time I'll take them out a bit earlier.

Tried these this morning, husband loved them!  I did substitute bread flour for self-rising and added more baking powder and salt.  Someone mentioned having trouble with the bottoms burning...let me suggest using a baking stone, works great and no burning.  I'll definitely make these again, and next time I'm going to try butter-flavor shortening, I think some butter flavor is really the only thing these are lacking, but that's also a matter of personal taste.

This is a good basic biscuit recipe.  As other people have posted, I added 2 tsp. of salt and 2 tsp. of baking powder to all-purpose flour instead of using self-rising flour.  I also used butter in place of the shortening.  I froze about 2/3 of the biscuits before baking, so hopefully they turn out as nice as the fresh ones!

These biscuits were great! I live in China right now and don't have buttermilk available. I used a powdered buttermilk as a substitute. The dough was really wet and sticky, and I couldn't roll it out. So I just dropped them on the cookie sheet instead of rolling out the dough and cutting the biscuits. Maybe the dough was different due to my substitution but they still baked great and tasted wonderful! I'll use this one again for sure!

These were great.  I made  them on the small side and it made a whole cookie sheet.  They were very tasty and tender.  I substituted 1/2 butter for all of the shortening.  I will make these many more times.

Found this recipe last year.  I'm not a "Southern Cook" and had never had homemade biscuits before this.  Now my kids (teens and pre-teens) make these at least monthly, without any adult help.  They are perfect with our other new find, sausage gravy.  thanks!

These biscuits were excellent. I halved the recipe to make 9 biscuits, and they turned out great (though I did have to add a little flour, as the dough was a bit on the wet side). I will definitely be making these again.

The dough was nice to work with, but the biscuits did not rise well. They are not light & fluffy & are bland. Pioneer baking mix makes a better biscuit. Wouldn't make these again.

These were awesome!! I am usuallya bisquick gal bc its so easy but these are just as easy only better.  They did lack a little in flavour if you plan on using them with a butter/preserve mix but if using with gravy  they are awesome. A definate keeper that I will experiment with to add more flavour!

I was all excited about it until I ate it. No fluff just a taste of too much of something. Just alot of flour. No instructions on what size to make them or how much to need the dough. Thank God I new to put flour on the conter to roll out.
I won't make again.

These biscuits were very good! My family loved them! Adding the buttermilk to the top was a great option!! Biscuits were huge and flaky with a great taste! 

What I did differently: 
added teaspoon of salt, baked for an additional 5 minutes, broiled for 1 minute, I used lard instead of shortening and use half butter and half lard.

We really enjoyed these biscuits.  They were soft on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside.  Brushing the tops with buttermilk before baking was a great idea!  They were so tasty with some honey and butter slathered on them.

A very good recipe!
My family LOVES it-Even my dogs!
I also found a really fast self rising flour recipe for the biscuits. https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/149310/self-rising-flour/ 
I don't put the glaze of buttermilk on because they don't rise as well.

Really good flavor and texture, though took longer than 15 minutes to brown up.  Used honey instead of sugar.

The biscuits came out light, flaky, not dry at all.  But the taste lacks something, maybe salt.  It's a good starting point to make adjustments to your own taste.

I like this recipe for biscuits! We did not access to butter at the time these were made so it was great! However, I think I will cut back on the amount of buttermilk used in the recipe, once it was mixed in, the dough was a little too moist for a bread product, and I needed to add more flour (which I know is normal in any bread recipe).

A great recipe! If you haven't made biscuits much, the sticky dough will throw you off! Don't worry, it should be sticky! The stickier the dough, the better the finished product. Just wash your hands, you'll be fine!

I love to bake biscuits and have several recipes but decided to try out a new one. These biscuits were awful! They looked great and browned nicely but they did not have a good taste at all. My husband gave the thumbs down and so did I.

Way too much buttermilk in the miixture. The first batch was a useless heap. Tried again , reducing the buttermilk by 1/4 cup, better but still way to wet. Taste of baking soda is overpowering. My better half asked me NOT to make these again.

I liked the shape and size of the biscuits. They remind me of what my mother's biscuits looked like, but there is no flavor in these biscuits. It definately needs some salt. They might work good for biscuits and gravy or possibly for making a dressing for turkey, but not to just enjoy a biscuit.

These biscuits had no flavor what's so ever. They were lacking salt which made them flat in taste. I gave them one star because they did come out fluffy and tender. They look great but taste aweful. If you make this recipe make sure you add salt.

This is my all-time favorite biscuit recipe.  I prefer to use unsalted butter instead of the lard for nutritional reasons as well as using the site's recipe for self-rising flour and substituting with homemade baking powder made from baking soda and cream of tartar.  They freeze and cook well, if slightly flatter and domed.

This was a nightmare.  The dough was very sticky.  In order to roll it out, I had to add lots of flour to the sheet, and it still stuck like crazy.  The taste was nothing spectacular, the texture was dense, not light & fluffy.  Surely not a keeper for me.

Kind of powdery, but delicous all the same.

I made this with powdered buttermilk, and substituted butter for the shortening.  I ended up having to use a little extra flour for some reason.  But they turned out wonderfully.  I halved the batch and it made 13 - 3" biscuits.

My family loved these biscuits.  I am not great with rolls, so I was a bit nervous.  But, I followed the other user's comments about kneading the dough 10 times with flour on the counter and flour on the top, and on the rolling pin.  It worked beautifully.  Also, remember just to mix until moistened.  I wish I could find a roll recipe this easy because mine NEVER rise!  Thanks for sharing your recipe and thank to you the other reviewers!

These came out great. Made them for a brunch with the girls and they loved them! They were waiting for them to come out of the oven. The only con for this item is that I used quite a bit of flour when rolling out the dough. It was pretty sticky until I loaded it with flour while kneading. Otherwise, they were perfect.

I just finished this recipe and it was great. It took a little longer to brown, but it also made the outside kind of hard but when split apart it was nice and soft. I will try this again.

Sorry but I was really disappointed that they didn't taste good. I may have done something wrong, but I followed the recipe and was bummed by the outcome. It was bland and tasted like I was just eating dough. I'll try again though.

Very good biscuits! My husband really enjoys it when I make these on a Sunday morning. They're light and fluffy once cooked. I found the dough to be a little wet and just dropped it by spoonfuls on the baking sheet.

These were okay, but a little tougher than I like a biscuit.  Maybe I didn't prepare the dough correctly.  Thanks, though!

This was an okay buttermilk biscuit recipe, but the dough was way too wet.  I decreased the initial amount to 1 3/4 cups; probably 1 1/2 would be even better.  I also increased the baking temp to 450 since it took a long time to get them brown.

Very easy to make. I followed the advice given in changing over to all purpose flour, and it worked nicely.  Next time, I may add a touch of bacon grease to add just a little more flavor.  Very good taste and tender texture.

These biscuits were pretty good. I am no good at rolling dough so I made them as drop biscuits and it worked out fine. The flavor was just missing something though. Maybe next time I will jazz these up with herbs or spices.
