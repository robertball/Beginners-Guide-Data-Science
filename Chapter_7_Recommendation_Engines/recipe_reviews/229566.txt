I made this tonight and served it with a side of mashed potatoes.  It was just great!  The meat was cooked perfectly and was moist and delicious! The onlly thing I did differently was I added in some sliced peppers when I sauted the onions.  I had an array of yellow, green, and orange peppers and decided they would be a nice addition to the dish.  I was right.  But, if I hadn't already had them on hand, it would have been just as good I am certain.  Oh, and I didn't have any cornstarch on hand, so I made a roux of 2 Tbsp. flour and 2 Tbsp canola oil to thicken the gravy...perfection!  
This was the perfect cold-night meal!  I will definitely be making this again and again!  
On another note...the photo I am submitting for this dish was taken AFTER we had already dug into our meal!  My bad...I forgot to take it beforehand ;-)    Update..I made this again today.  I used Lipton onion soup mix, 1/2 in the meat mixture and half in the broth.  I didn't change the amount of onions, in fact, I MIGHT have put more in than was called for ;-)   I also added a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce into the roux I made before adding in the broth.  It was AMAZING!   I had made a mushroom risotto to accompany it along with some frozen peas.  It was a huge hit in my house yet again!

This was so great! Needed no tweaking, which I liked. Simple and awesome "comfort food". I had never tried this at home, only out a restaurant from time to time. Made last week with mashed potatos, making tonight over egg noodles. This is a winner:)

I cooked this Salisbury steak this evening and it was very quick and easy. The flavor and texture was wonderful. TIPS: I removed steaks from pan after browning - adding onions and mushrooms to saute. You can use one can of beef broth (14.5 oz) adding water to make the 16 ozs. Plenty of flavor. Then proceed with recipe as written.  Will make again soon.

This is an A+ recipe! I had a deprived childhood of only frozen dinner versions of salisbury steak. This steak had the same taste you want, only better and fresher and made from scratchiness. Not sure how to say that.... And the great things is that if you have fresh ground beef, then you probably have all the ingredients on hand. I took my first bite, and heard the ding ding ding ding from a game show. There's no need to read reviews to find ways to tweak the recipe. Cook it as is the first time; then do your own tweaks if your palette demands it.

As I looked over the recipe, I could see it cried out for seasoning – seasoned bread crumbs, Montreal Steak Seasoning and Worcestershire Sauce did the trick.  Good, homey dish.  I served this with Wild and Brown Rice, and Peas and Pancetta, both recipes also from this site.

Thank you ESKARINA!  I was in a rut with my weekday dinner rotation and was wondering how to use some ground beef I had.  This was perfect!!!  I dislike when people rate a recipe with so many changes that the original recipe is barely recognizable.  I did it as is with all the same ingredients and proportions.  HOWEVER the second time around, I felt that the recommendation in step #2 to remove the beef patties when they are browned, sauté the onions and mushrooms, put back the patties and then proceed with the rest of step #2, had the best outcome.  The salt and pepper quantities might changes with the type of broth that you use (i.e. its sodium content) but the salt to pepper proportion was just right for this dish.

excellent recipe.  I did change it up a little.   I caramelized the onions first and then set them aside.   I then browned the patties in the same pan.   I set them aside.  Then in the same pan I put some butter in and added flour and made a roux.  I then added the beef broth and made into a gravy.   I added backed in the onions and patties to cook.  It was excellent.

This was exactly the recipe that I was craving.  I haven't had this dish in years!  My wife loved it and asked me to make it again, and she usually likes a different style of cooking.  I made it with venison, but it would be great with ground turkey or ground beef.  I served it with a spinach salad, mashed potatoes, and green beens for an old-fashioned, comfort-food, delicious dinner.  I did remove the steaks and saute the onions and mushrooms a little prior to returning them to the pan and adding the broth.  Note that you could substitute beef bouillon for the broth by adding 1 tablespoon or 1 cube and a cup of water for each cup of broth.  When I make it again, I may add a splash or two of worcestershire sauce, but the recipe was great as is.  Add more or less onions or mushrooms to suit your taste.  Double the gravy to have plenty for mashed potatoes.  It is excellent and doesn't require condensed soup like most of the other similar recipes on this site.

Update (3 years after my first review):  I made this recipe with ground beef this time and was again pleased with the results.  I added a couple splashes of worcestershire sauce, but I followed the recipe other than that.  I read some of the negative reviews and noticed that some people complained about the consistency of the sauce - either complaining that it was too runny or jelly like.  When thickening the gravy, make sure to add the cornstarch mixture slowly while at a boil.  If your sauce was too runny, add a little

This is pretty darn tasty and we'll definitely be making it again.  I did mess with the technique just a little.  We fried the patties about 3-4 minutes on each side and then removed them from the pan.  Then we added the onions and about 3 minutes later added portabello mushrooms.  After another few minutes we added the beef broth and about 1/4 cup red wine.  We let that reduce for a couple minutes to get the alcohol to calm down and then added the water/cornstarch and patties back in.  Then we simmered it for about 15-20 minutes while we ate some salad.  It was moist and delicious and the gravy was amazing. We will definitely be making it again.

Ahh! Where has this recipe been all my life?! I've always loved salisbury steak but always had the frozen kind. I didn't know I could make it from scratch! And to my surprise it tasted just like I remember! Thank you for making the recipe simple to follow! Regardless of what my husband thinks, this recipe will be a household staple, if just for me! I skipped the mushrooms because of my husband. It would have been even more amazing with them, but this still was a homerun dish!

I followed this recipe as written and although I'd love to give it more stars...I can't.  : (  It just didn't have enough flavor.  Maybe if the mushrooms and onion were sauteed together first...maybe with a little red wine?  I don't know, I make no claims at being any sort of grand chef...but this was just ok.  It definitely falls in the comfort food category but needs more flavor.  Lipton soup?  Or maybe using french onion soup in place of the beef broth.  Actually, that's not a bad idea.

I prepared this recipe as the directions stated (I'm not yet a "freelancer" in the kitchen.) It was delicious! I'm pretty particular about my Salisbury Steak, too. My hubby enjoyed it as well. We served it with mashed potatoes. :)

I made this for the second time just a few days ago.  The first time I made it as written except I baked them in the oven.  Family loved them.  This time, I made the gravy using flour instead of cornstarch.  I liked that much better and the leftover gravy keeps a nice consistency for leftover warm ups.  When I make this next time, I will experiment a bit and add extra seasonings to the meat such as parsley and garlic.  This recipe is going to be part of the regular rotation in this house.

This recipe for Salisbury Steak is delicious. We served it with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Well within the diet plan we are on and yet tasty and filling. It also smells delicious both when cooking and when reheating the leftovers. I wouldn't change a thing.

Loved this!  Down to earth comfort food for the meat & potato crowd.  Followed the recipe eactly and it turned out delicious.  Added some peas to the mashed potatoes for left overs and it took me back to the 50's dinners I ate as a kid.  

Some comments here are very funny.  One 2 star reviewer stated it "tasted like meatloaf"  Well "DUH" it IS meatloaf in a brown mushroom gravy.

Great flavor and texture.  Yum!  I did find the gravy needed a bit more oomph, so I added 1 tsp. worchestershire and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, a bit of dried parsley, and s&p.  I also followed other reviewers' suggestions and sauteed the onion and mushrooms first.

I don't care for a cornstarch gravy, so after removing browned patties and grease, I cooked the onions and mushrooms in butter. I also added a little Worcestershire sauce, garlic and onion powder. Then added flour for a roux and then added broth (actually, I used beef consume which has a richer taste). Then add back beef patties and simmered gently to complete cooking the beef. Salt and pepper to taste.

We really enjoyed this meal - the gravy was great over mashed potatoes. A real comfort meal for sure!  Next time I'll use more mushrooms, though, because we really like mushrooms.  Hubby said this was way better than the frozen pre-made Salisbury steaks we've had in the past.  I agree and since this was so easy to make and I usually have all the ingredients on hand I will make this again.

My family loves Salisbury steak and this is a great recipe. The only change I really made was to add some garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce to the patties and Worcestershire sauce with the beef broth. Also, I sliced up the onions first and started them and the mushrooms sauteeing in a little olive oil while I mixed up the ground beef mixture and made the patties. Then I removed the onions and mushrooms to a plate while browning the patties. Delicious served with mashed potatoes.

We loved it! It was easier than I expected, very flavorful. I cut back on the onions for the gravy, used half an onion instead because my husband does not like onions and I do and he loved it. He's sitting here having seconds. This recipe will be a favorite for sure!!

I made half of this recipe for dinner last night.  I used 2 T. of beaten egg for the half egg I needed (I do this all the time and have never had a problem).  I increased the mushrooms, and at the end of simmering, I added a little browning and seasoning sauce to give the sauce a nice dark rich color.  While this was good, next time I would tweak it a bit.  I’d turn the heat down to medium – at medium high the patties started to burn a bit, no doubt due to the bread crumbs in the mix.  I would also thicken this with a roux of flour and butter to add a bit more richness.

Very easy to make and great comfort food!  Make sure you use good broth or beef stock for a meaty flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly and hubby loved it.  I always make the recipe as written before I add my own touches.  I might throw in some green bell pepper next time, but it doesn't really need a thing.  Thanks for this great recipe that has no "cream of" soup.  YUCK!

This is a great recipe !  We served it over yolk free egg noodles and with green beans.  Added Worcester, ketchup and dry mustard to beef broth.  So good.

Ahhhh. This is pure Southern comfort food! I followed the recipe exactly until the very end. I didn't use all of the cornstarch mixture...just enough to thicken the gravy to my liking. Tastes great served with mashed potatoes.

This is a great Salsbury recipe, but  when I think about Salsbury Steak I think of  a hearty Mushroom taste, in which this one does not have. So, I decided to take the stems from the mushrooms and boil in water til it has liquid reduced to down to about half. (use 2 cups h20) Substitute 1/2 the beef stock for this mushroom broth and you will surely be happy you did.

OMG this was SO good!  We are all fighting over the leftovers ! -which isn't much.  I didn't use quite as much onion as it called for and it turned out just heavenly!  Suggestion for working guys like me: make it on a weekend.  It does take up a fair amount of time and uses quite a few dishes, at least for me.  Super recipe! r-



2/2016: I just had to update with a bit of a funny story - some months later, ONE of my daughters was with me so I made the usual 4-patty recipe.  She is a tomboy and eats like one - which is great!  So, she ended up having her normal two patties (thumbs up), and I expected to have my ONE for dinner and my ONE for my lunch the next day.  Well, she decided to split a third patty with me cause she loves this like we all do (so she's up to 2 and 1/2 now, right?)  ...okay no prob.  So now I have ONE for myself left and 1/2 leftover.  No prob, right?  Well guess who shows up unexpectedly about that time and REMEMBERS this meal from before, but her big sister....   Nutshell:  I got 1/2 of a patty dinner with zero goose egg leftovers.    :(    lol!   (It's called being a parent)  -AND, thank you AGAIN for this great recipe.  I keep hoping, crossing fingers that someday perhaps I'll have leftovers for work!  (I'm a single dad, by the way, if you can't tell)

This is simply the most delicious low-calorie comfort food around.   I make it with ground chicken instead of ground beef to save on fat and calories even more and it's AMAZING!   The rich beef gravy is excellent over mashed potatoes on the side.   Don't change a thing!   The recipe is excellent as it stands.   Whether or not to saute the onions and mushrooms before the "simmer in broth" step is just personal preference.   Winner!

I have always made my salisbury steaks like this.  I do add Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix to my ground beef and gravy.  I sometimes omit the mushrooms but NEVER leave out the onions :o) Also I make my gravy with a roux, corn starch, while handy does not make for a great gravy.

Good basic recipe for an old-time standard meal.  I had to use two beef bouillon cubes dissolved in two cups boiling water, and seasoned bread crumbs, because that's what I had on hand.  I didn't have any mushrooms.  I omitted the salt, because bouillon is so salty.  I added a teaspoon of chopped garlic and a teaspoon of dried parsley (fresh would have been better) to the meat mixture, and used my hamburger press to make nicely-shaped patties.  I first browned the onions lightly in just a bit of bacon fat to give a little extra flavor.  I served it with plain rice and a side of veggies.  My adult Grandson really liked it, too!

First time making this and it was delicious! The only thing I'd do differently next time would be to have it with mashed potatoes (only had rice on hand)and maybe add some peppers as some have suggested in their reviews. This is an 'add' to the recipe box! :)

I have made this several times now and absolutely LOVE it!  The only slight change I made was that I didn't have beef broth and used beef bouillon instead.  I've made it both with and without mushrooms and it is excellent either way.  Probably the best Salisbury steak recipe I have come across.

I really enjoyed this recipe. As a kid, I loved those Salisbury steak TV dinners, and while this is much more fresh and delicious, it did have a slight taste and smell reminiscent of my childhood. I doubled the gravy and omitted the mushrooms, because I forgot, but it was still delicious and even better the following day.

I thought it needed a little more seasoning the first time I made it, but my hubby and I both really enjoyed it.  The second time I made it, I added a little garlic and some of my favorite seasoning blend that I like for ground beef.  I also added a little garlic powder to the broth mixture as well.  
I served over mashed potatoes.  It was very quick and easy to make.  I'll definitely make again.

I made this tonight and it was easy to make. I doubled the recipe. I did omit the salt since I knew that the beef broth would be salty. And I was right. Next time, low sodium beef broth is the best bet. I did cut up the steak and poured the gravy over it since it looked dry if you just poured over it. Other than that, it was pretty tasty.

My family loved this! Followed directions exactly, with the exception of making 6 patties out of 1lb of meat instead of 4. That makes each patty a little less than three ounces which was fine for my kids. My husband at 1 and a 1/2 and was satisfied. I didn't eat any because I am on a special diet but they all ate it, including my three children who are 7, 10, and 14. The only thing I would say is what another reviewer said-I would saute the mushrooms first before adding them raw. I will definitely be making this again and hopefully will be able to eat it also!

I only gave this recipe four stars because while it is easy to make and has the potential to be really good I thought it needed more flavor. I followed the recipe exactly this time but I plan to make it again adding liquid smoke and garlic to the patties.

Delicious!  We added 1/4t each of thyme, rosemary, and marojam, plus 1/2t parsley to the gravy and 1 crushed clove of garlic, a shredded carrot and a dash of Worcestershire to the meat patties before browning.  Next time I'd like to add a stalk of diced celery to the patties too. We browned the patties, took them out of the pan and drained the grease, sauteed the onions & mushrooms, then put the patties back in with the beef broth until it was time to add the cornstarch.  The gravy is amazing and made plenty.  What a great dinner!

So simple to make and tastes good. I did not have mushrooms on hand so I made it without.  I love mushrooms, so I will use them next time.  This will be a ground beef go to recipe in our house. Thanks for sharing! I have made this several times and have adjusted the cornstarch water combo down to 2 Tablespoons. That seems to work better for me. We are still enjoying this dish with and without the mushrooms.

EXCELLENT!!! This has got to be the best Salisbury Steaks I've had. I think what really made the difference was instead of using 2 cups of beef broth I boiled 2 cups of water and mixed with Lipton onion soup mix and used that as my broth base for the gravy. I also used Italian bread crumbs. Very, fast, easy, delicious recipe for after work.

I'm a beginner cook and this recipe was easy and very good.  My whole family loved it.  I used deer meat, which is what we use for almost everything and it turned out great!!!

I made this recipe tonight for dinner using ground bison and 3 cups of homemade beef broth for more gravy. I also used herb and garlic flavored bread crumbs. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Since there are 3 of us, I made 3 patties with the meat mixture. We all loved this Salisbury steak and the gravy, which was also used for mashed potatoes.  We had some gravy left over, so I froze it for later use instead of canned or jarred gravy from the store.  I do this with most of the gravies that I make. I will definitely be making this again. The only changes I will make next time is to add some Worcestershire sauce and steak seasoning. I made this recipe a second time, and this time I used less beef broth so we got less gravy. The first time I cooked the patties until almost cooked and they were a little dry. This time, I cooked the patties only until they were brown on both sides before I added the broth, onions, and mushrooms. This time the patties were much more moist. So it is best not to cook the patties too much as they will continue cooking in the broth/mushroom/onion mix. This way the patties are much more moist and tender. Will definitely be making this again.

Too bland.  I gave two stars because the sauce is good (basic, but good) but the meat patty is completely flavourless.

This was so good.  Will make again soon!  I used beef base instead of broth and didn't add the onion or mushrooms at the end just because my husband isn't a fan.  But my husband was glad we had leftovers which is rare for him.

This was a super-simple, super-delicious comfort food recipe.  Just like I remember from my childhood, but much better!  I'm allergic to wheat and didn't have any gluten free bread crumbs, so I made fresh ones from a slice of Udi's GF white bread and used all of them (about 1/2 cup).  That was the only thing I changed and the results were perfect. Served it over white rice because I had some leftover in the fridge. My family loved it.  Only problem was, I didn't make enough!  Next time I'll double the recipe and try it with the recommended mashed potatoes.

Good! I cooked the patties a little too long, I think.  They had a nice crust on each side, which is the way I like hamburgers, but for this recipe they should have been gently browned. As it was they reminded me of burgers with gravy. A dash or two of Worcestershire can't hurt.

A very nice Salisbury Steak recipe.  I took the suggestion to season it up a bit by using seasoned bread crumbs, 1T. Dale's Steak Seasoning, and 1/2T. Worcestershire Sauce, but then omitting the 1 t. salt.  The patties needed longer than 10 minutes to cook through and it took several minutes of boiling the onion/mushroom mixture in order for the mushrooms to cook before adding the cornstarch/water.  We served this with egg noodles, peas & carrots, and crescent rolls.  A nice comforting dinner on a cold late-March day.

This was easy to make. The flavour was good, but lacked something, just a bit bland.  I will make it again, but next time I will add some Worcestershire sauce and garlic and perhaps some other seasonings.

Loved this, really, really loved it.  Added some red peppers in place of the mushrooms because my family is picky!  LOL  Also added some extra seasonings to the gravy after tasting.  Little pepper and Lawrys if I remember right.

The salsbury steak as written would have been bland.  I subbed a tbs of mayo instead of an egg and I did not add the bread crumbs.  I added Worcestershire to the meat along with salt and pepper.   The sauce however was delicious.  I was skeptical about adding the mushrooms and onions without sautéing them but did it anyway.  Wow. The sauce was delicious, rich and thick. By just adding one TBS of cornstarch.

This was an instant favorite at our house, and I can hardly wait to make it again.  I used a very lean ground beef, and followed the recipe exactly as written.  It's hard to believe that just a handful of ingredients turned plain old ground beef into something so tasty.  I served it along with mashed potatoes and a green vegetable.  Simply terrific.

Frying the patties over medium heat for 10 minutes to brown on both sides is a typo.  I think she meant, fry patties over medium heat for about 2 minutes each side, to quickly sear the patties.

Delicious.  Made it according to directions sort of and it turned out great.  My husband loved it.  I did what another lady suggested and caramelized the onions and mushrooms first, then  removed them and browned the steak patties.  After they were browned on both sides I added the onions and mushrooms back in,  two tablespoons full of worcestershire sauce and the beef broth. I also added a full package of onion soup mix.   covered and cooked for about 10 minutes.  Served with potatoes mashed with buttermilk  and butter and green onions mixed in..

I don't know how this got such a high rating. As I was cooking I realised there was no seasoning at all. It's sorely lacking. Fortunately sauce is always easy to modify and it kind of saved the game with Worcestershire sauce, garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper and some steak seasoning. Even then, I won't be making it again. Total disappointment.

I would make this again in an instant! The flavor and texture of the meat and the gravy were spot on and my guys loved it! Next time I will decrease the onion and increase the mushroom measures a tad, but that is all I would change.

Great comfort food. Like others, I tweak slightly. I brown the burgers and take them out. Once the sauce is fully made, then I put them back in for 10-15 min. I add a bit of fresh thyme and it just punches it up a bit. I serve with mashed potatoes and a salad.  So good!

We loved this version of a classic.  I sauteed the onions and mushrooms separately, used more of both than called for and probably more Worcestershire.  A definite winner!!

This was delicious and so easy to make! I did two things differently:  1) I added a little milk to the burgers like I do when I make meatballs since it makes them more tender--probably 1/8 of a cup: and 2) I added more beef broth to the pan after I took out the beef patties and continued to cook the onions and mushrooms. The broth cooked up and I wanted to make sure there was enough gravy.  First time I've made Salisbury steak and it was a winner! Served it with mashed potatoes

My first time making a salisbury steak! This recipe was easy and delicious making it into the "add this to the rotation" list. I usually reduce the amount of salt in every recipe and increase the pepper. I also caramelized the onions as another reviewer did. Will definitely make this again and again.

I just made this for dinner, with few changes except for making a little extra gravy, because I had more mushrooms to use up. I did tweak the gravy  with a little more salt and pepper, tho next time I'll probably add a little Worcestershire sauce. I made a half batch, and the highest praise was when my husband walked by the leftover half patty I'd saved for myself for lunch tomorrow and offered to eat it. I'll be making this again in a couple of days with the leftover gravy, and it will go in the rotation. Thanks!

Very good and easy to prepare. I agree it needs some additional flavoring such as worcestershire and/or garlic powder.

Plate of heaven! I don't know why I've always thought Salisbury steaks would be complicated to make, but these were easy, moist, and tasted great!!! I followed through with other suggestions and used Italian bread crumbs, sauteed the onions first, and made a roux instead of cornstarch. Definitely adding these to my recipe book. Thank you!

A good comfort recipe as is but as several mentioned a bit lacking in flavor. But please do not add something packaged to a scratch recipe. If you want one made with canned soup there are plenty out there. The second time I made it, I added 1/2 teaspoon of thyme, a tbsp of Worcestershire sauce & one minced garlic and that put the flavor up to exactly where I wanted it but I left the star rating as I'd put it for the recipe. Also I found sauteing the mushrooms and onions for the gravy in the drippings before adding broth really improved that. None are large changes but I thought improved the original.

The only change I would make is to sauté the fresh mushrooms ahead of time in some butter and worscheshire. The butter will help add some richness to the sauce.

This was my first time making Salisbury Steak. The recipe was fantastic! The only thing I did somewhat differently was add a bit more breadcrumbs for binder. Everything was spot on and delicious. I served it with mashed potato and corn on the cob. I served sweet tea to add some sweetness to the line up. Will totally make this again and again!

Good recipe!!!  Made for a delicious dinner!  

I, like many cooks here, made some adjustments. I added some thyme to the patties and Worcestershire sauce to the gravy. I also only cooked the patties 1/2 way and allowed them to finish simmering in the sauce.  Great recipe!

Really, really good! I tripled the recipe for a homestyle meal to the extended family and everyone enjoyed it. My only change was to chop a large onion, not big slices, and decreased the cornstarch ratio to 1/4 cup for 6 cups broth and it was a perfect gravy texture. The video shows a very thick gravy as a result of 3 tbsp cornstarch per recipe, whereas I prefer a thinner gravy. I also used a good ground sirloin for the beef. Thank you :)

I made this tonight, and not only enjoyed the making of it, but thoroughly enjoyed the eating of it!  The only change I made was to use about 1 and 1/2 tsp of Montreal steak spice in place of the salt & pepper.  The gravy was excellent (and I'm not known for making good gravy, although I'm learning) and we enjoyed it over leftover mashed potatoes that I warmed in the oven.  Will definitely make this again. Might put more mushrooms in next time, since we all love them. Thanks for a great recipe!

Really, really good, even though I somehow used confectioner's sugar rather than cornstarch - it didn't thicken, and tasted oddly sweet! Probably be even better when made properly! I salvaged the remaining meat cakes by making another batch of gravy. Do use Portobello mushrooms; flavor is much superior to plain white mushrooms.

I loved that this recipe was a true "from-scratch" recipe without canned or boxed seasonings/soup mixes. I did add a bit of Worcestershire sauce and substituted 4C gluten-free breadcrumbs. The kids devoured it! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is a great receipe,  my mom has been doing this since the 60's the only difference is we use a can of Golden Mushroom soup with some beef broth.  Not regular mushroom soup but it has to be Golden Mushroom soup by campbells.  We also add worchestershire sauce and used seasoned bread crumbs if you don't doctor this it will be OK but sort of bland and boring.

Not to my liking. Too much onion and sauce wasn't thick enough by the recipe.

Tried this last night and I understand the raves! This was excellent and easy. I did it with the Quick and Easy Yorkshire Pudding recipe and knocked it out of the park. I wanted something to go with the YP as I rarely make roast beef, and this was it. Outstanding!!!

I first tried this recipe about a year ago and it continues to be one of our dinner favorites! i make it exactly as it is shown here, (minus the mushrooms  since I dont ever have them when I need them). It is an awesome dinner that the whole family loves! I cook it with mashed potatoes and corn.

I made this to a T and it was delicious. I found 3 tbsp cornstarch/water mixture was a little too much so I used about 2/3 the amount. Served with homemade simple mashed potatoes. I'll definitely make again.

Made this tonight and it was excellent. I followed the recipe except like other reviewers, I removed the patties, sauteed the onions and mushrooms in butter, added broth and added back the patties. Easy delicious meal, perfect with mashed potatoes.

Very very good. The gravy was excellent. I didn't have beef so used turkey and I was afraid it would be bland but it wasn't. Will make again for sure.

Excellent recipe. I was looking for a recipe that did not use canned cream of mushroom or cream of chicken soup.  So, I was really happy to find this recipe. It basically uses ingredients that you probably have at home. I didn't have any bread crumbs so I used saltine crackers instead. I did not add the teaspoon of salt to the meat. I just lightly salted with a salt shaker. Otherwise, I followed the directions pretty closely. And the directions are great. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe with us. This will be my "Forever Salisbury Steak" recipe.

The only thing I added was a bit of Worcestershire sauce to the gravy and the meat mixture, and it was absolutely delicious with mashed potatoes and garden peas. I appreciate the lack of canned soups etc. for a healthier meal as well-plus it's cheaper to make! Will make again and again!!

followed the recipe except cut out the extra salt. I have never made Salisbury steak before, but it was one of my husband's favorite dishes growing up. He said it was just like he remembered, and the kids loved it too! Super easy and quick.

Fantastic recipe. Taste was wonderful, writing this review while me and my wife enjoy it. Used ground venison instead of beef as we are both avid hunters. Never tried making Salisbury steak before but we will be making this every week. Thank you for such a fantastic recipe.

Had all ingredients in my kitchen.  Followed recipe to the tee.  However the broth I used was home made, which made this even better.  The ingredients to make the patties is perfect, they don't fall apart.  Will make again.

Salisbury Steak Haiku: "Needed more flavor. Should have followed the reviews. I made as written." I wouldn't say that we were disappointed in this meal, it was just on the bland spectrum, requiring more salt at the table, ketchup for my daughter, hot sauce for my husband, you get the idea. I wish I'd added Worchestsire as so many reviews did, or sauteed the mushrooms and onions separately, or added other seasoning. I will say this though - the meat was absolutely the most perfect done-ness and texture per following the instructions. We ate ours TV-dinner-style w/ mashed potatoes and peas, and the gravy sliding onto everything else on the plate was actually really tasty.

This is an excellent, simple, easy to make recipe. Followed the recipe pretty close except that only used half of a sliced onion and I used Elk instead of beef. To me, it seemed like more than enough onion and although completely changing the meat may seem like a HUGE change, elk and beef have similar flavors. The beef would have definantely added to the richess of the recipe as elk is very lean. Sorry, I have 200 lbs of elk and beef wasn't on sale! For a recipe I'd never made, I had dinner on the table in about a half an hour. Great, filling recipe. Highly reccomended.
Oh yeah, I also tossed in a minced clove of garlic to the meat mixture. Everythings better with garlic.

I just ate this and it was wonderful. I doubled the recipe because I used 1 lb. of hamburger and 1 lb.of hot Italian sausage. Also I made mashed potatoes and with the gravy it was delish. I will be making this again.

Perfect recipe!! Made it twice already and about to make it a 3rd time. Added a couple teaspoons of worcestershire sauce to the gravy then added the beef patties back in while simmering.  Perfectly tender! Served with white rice and a green veggie. I love this recipe because it's so simple, delicious, old fashioned and easy to double!!!

Yum! Perfect comfort food. My gravy needed a little extra seasoning, but other than that, a great recipe as is.

Sooo good!  I put onion soup mix in with the mince meat and also sauteed the onions and mushrooms before making the gravy.  Served with butter noodles and corn.  Comfort food at its best!

This was very good and easy to make; as always I add a bit more seasoning.  I used a little garlic and thyme to my gravy and add a tiny dash of hot pepper to my beef.  Served over pasta.  I love Salisbury Steak, it's a nice comfort dish.

This was a winner!  The only changes I made were adding a splash of Worcestershire sauce to the hamburger mix and about 1/4 c red wine to the sauce.  I did follow suggestion of other reviewers, removed patties from pan and sauteed the onions and mushrooms slightly before adding other sauce ingredients and returning patties to finish cooking. Served with salad, roasted asparagus, and rice. Very yummy. Will definitely be repeated.

I made this tonight for dinner, I did not adjust any of the ingredients, however I did the following: after browning the patties, I transferred the browned patties to a 2 1/2 qt. covered dish and then sautéed the onions and mushrooms in a little evoo and lightly seasoned with some pepper, once onions were transparent, I transferred to the top of the patties and then in the same frying pan heated the bullion/water mixture and added the thickened water/cornstarch mixture until it was a perfect gravy.  Baked for about 20 minutes covered at 325 in the oven.  Served with mashed potatoes and peas.  Delicious!!!!  Thanks for sharing

I have to agree with the review that there is not enough flavour--we like a lot of flavour in our food.  I think I will try adding some dried herb(oregano, basil, thyme) to the ground beef mixture--and maybe as was suggested by someone else---saute the mushrooms and onions together with a little red wine before adding to the beef and broth. Otherwise--a great quick weeknight meal, with potatoes any way or perhaps just some buttered egg noodles

Comfort food at its very finest! The only thing I did different was add a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic to the gravy, then cook it all in the crockpot on low for three or four hours.

This was amazing!!! We had 1.40 lbs ground beef so we just used more of each ingredient and made larger size patties. Finished off all of the leftovers in no time!! Served over mashed red potatoes. I didn't change a thing and was honestly surprised how delicious and flavorful it was with no tweaking the recipe! Thanks so much!!

Fantastic!  I removed the meat after browning and sautéed canned mushrooms with onions to make the gravy.  I also didn't have beef broth, so I used water and a bullion cube.  I also added a bit of Gravy Master to get a deeper gravy color.  Delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe, we will be enjoying this frequently with good 'ol mashed potatoes.

Simple and delicious! I actually used 1/2 ground chicken just for kicks and it was still great (but would for sure be better with all beef). One tiny tweak that made a big difference: Italian flavored breadcrumbs. The only other thing I did a little differently was: after frying and removing the steaks I used the pan to fry the onions and mushrooms (in those yummy browned bits) and only then added the broth mixed with cornstarch and reduced it to a gravy. (I had made my steaks thinner so they cooked fully as I fried them.) Even my ground-meat-and-mashed-potatoes hating husband loved it! Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and found the bread crumbs and egg gave  the meat a mushy texture, more like a meatloaf. The gravy was too thin for my taste. Adding flour and a little more salt made it taste better. Mushrooms really didn't add much flavor, I probably would leave them out next time.

This was GREAT. Even my picky 7yr old ate it. Didn't change a thing. Meat turned out perfect. It was so easy I will never buy frozen Salisbury steak again. This gets put in my recipe book. Will definitely make a again.

Great recipe!  I tripled it, family of 6 and lunch leftovers, and it came out fantastic!  No problems with patties sticking together.  I am going to try to make it Paleo by finding a good sub for the breadcrumbs.  Good Eats!!  The only change I will make next time is more seasoning in the meat mixture.  Served with Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans.

This was fantastic!  I added 1 packet of onion soup mix to the hamburger and excluded the salt and pepper, that's it!  Hoping for leftovers, but that didn't happen.  I will be making this EASY recipe again!

I made this last night and it was a huge hit! To make it a bit more tasty I added a packet of onion soup mix which gave the meat plenty of flavoring...other than that everything else the same. I made fluffy mashed potatoes and roasted squash, quinoa salad w/lime vinaigrette. The onion mushroom sauce from the Salisbury steak on the mashed potatoes was absolutely delish and the steaks were so juicy and tender.

Really Tasty!  Will make again!!  I used liberal amounts of Worcestershire Sauce both in the formation of the patties and the sauce itself.  I also added extra pepper (i didn't measure) nad minced garlic to the patties.  I think bits of chopped up bacon inside the patties would also be good, but I didn't try that because I thought of it too late.

This is my first time making Salisbury Steak, and honestly, it turned out DELICIOUS!!! Although the recipe called for one cup of mushrooms, I added two cups instead-because I LOVE mushrooms that much!! I served the Salisbury Steak with baked macaroni and cheese, and to me, this recipe is a comfort classic!! It was a huge hit between myself and my sister, and we're always trying to find creative ways to make dinner more interesting. This recipe is one of them.

pretty good. i used only a 1/2 tsp of salt because i thought a whole tsp seemed like way too much, but then found myself wishing it had a bit more when we ate dinner. i'll probably split the difference next time and use 3/4 tsp. i also used an entire 8-oz. basket of mushrooms as we really like them. i added a small amount of garlic with the mushrooms and onions to increase the depth of flavor in the sauce. i'm thinking that next time i might also add some worcestershire sauce and/or a little red wine. as a basic recipe this is fine, but it needs some tweaking to make it really good.

Perfection! i followed the recipe exactly as instructed and it turned out perfect! however we are only 2 people so i froze the other 2 patties without frying them for next time, and the gravy was so good we ended up finishing it all. so next time i will just defrost the 2 patties in the fridge over night and make a new batch of gravy.

can't wait to have this again. i think this will be one of those things where i will always have a few patties in the freezer as making the gravy is so easy and quick. i also had it with rice

Grew up on this kind of "Hungery Man" frozen dinners. My wife won't do the "TV Dinner" style food so I made these for my wife and she "LOVED THEM".!! Easy one pan, and I'm making them again tonight.. Together with peas and sticky rice.

Made this tonight as I had a thawed out pound of ground beef and some baby Bella mushrooms that needed to be used and WOW!  The only three small changes I made was to use 1/2 packet of Lipton onion soup mix in the ground beef mixture instead of chopped onion and then I  added a splash of Worcester sauce and 1/2 tsp of Montreal steak seasoning to the beef.  It was awesome-reminded me of having the Swanson TV dinners as a kid, but only better cause it was fresh and homemade.  Will be adding this to our regular rotation (•?•)

So I made this for dinner tonight and it turned out great. I followed the directions exactly and the timing was pretty spot on. I will definitely be making this again but I may add a bit more black pepper but all in all a fantastic quick meal when you sick of the traditional beef dishes.

This was a great change of pace after Christmas/New Year's!  I followed the directions exactly, except I used green onions in the ground beef mixture and added a few splashes of Worchester.  Cooking times were spot-on, turned out perfectly!

Very tasty!  I used a beef, pork and veal meatloaf mix. I used yellow onion for the meat mixture and a red onion for the gravy. Two cloves of garlic in the meat mix.

I made this and it turned out perfectly!  I doubled the recipe and made plain gravy as well as the mushroom, so there was a choice.  I served over rice.  It was delicious!

As written is how I prepared it. I wasn't knocked out of my socks. But don't get me wrong - I could see this as being served at a function for work - or a putluck dinner party. It would please most people.

The prep was minimal, the cook, easy. Lots of steps, though..

  In the end, I'd add some Worcestershire, throw 3 times as much pepper and some extra salt, as well. Also put it over rice or pasta.

  Fine, as far as getting a meal on the table. I f you want something fancy or really flavorful - this isn't for that.

I was craving Salisbury Steak but wanted to make it all from scratch like most recipes I make. It turned out perfectly and my boyfriend couldn’t get enough of it! The first time, I made it with mashed potatoes and corn and the second time over egg noodles. Both were amazing!!

I make this pretty often and it's good as is, but very plain. I feel that every component of this dish needs a lot more seasoning but that's a personal preference. I always liberally season my beef and add minced garlic to it. Also, depending on my schedule I will make this a few hours before dinner time and put it all in a roasting pan, cover with foil and when I'm ready to start dinner pop it in the oven at 350 for a half hour or so. I think it helps all of the flavors blend together as well.

This hit all of the yummy and childhood and comfort food markers. It was easy to make and very delicious. I will make this again and again. 
I served it over buttered herb noodles with green beans. 
For a variation I may add more mushrooms and increase the gravy amount.

I added just a dash of soy sauce to darken the gravy and a few extra mushrooms. We thought it was delicious and will definitely add it to our list of keepers!

This was great.  Only modification I made was I took out the meat and put aside, then put in mushrooms and onions.  After those had cooked a bit I put about 2tbsp flour and then the broth.  When it got thick, I put the beef back in and let it cook a little longer.

We never had the TV dinner type, and my Mom pretty much made them taste like sawdust. Thank you, Krystal Wetter, for a clearly written recipe.  I could see the amazing potential for our family right off!   

I Added garlic, more pepper,  oregano,  thyme, marjoram, za'atar, 1 pinch of red pepper flakes,doubled the onion, used 1 cup of mushroom water (from dried mushrooms) and 1 cup homemade, grass-fed beef stock, splash of Worcestershire, 2 Tbsp Coconut Aminos, and 1 Tablespoon Asian fish sauce.  I also let the steaks 'rest for about 45 minutes before starting the cooking.   Used Krystal's very clear instructions.  Hit this one out of the park!

This recipe is awesome!  I can usually tell by looking at the ingredients whether or not I might change or adjust it, but this recipe required NO changes!  It’s perfect the way it is.  Nice and simple and easy to prepare. Since I live in Thailand it can be difficult to find many ingredients for Western food which is why I love this recipe.  All the ingredients were readily available, with the beef broth being the trickiest, but thankfully our store had Knor beef bouillon cubes which worked great. Thanks for an awesome recipe and bringing a little bit of my old home to my new home!

I added garlic powder and onion powder along with the other spices and a little yellow mustard to the patties. After browning the Salisbury steak I set them aside and sauteed the onions and mushrooms. Once they were cooked, I added a heaping tablespoon of flour to them and browned it a bit. Then added the broth, gave it a few good stirs to incorporate the flour and broth. Added the Salisbury steaks back to the pan and let it simmer until the broth was thickened to a nice gravy consistency.  It was fabulous! Served it with mashed potatoes. I will Definitely make this again. So quick and easy comfort food meal on a cold night!!

I took another reviewer's advice and caramelized the mushrooms and onions before browning the patties.  Then made a roux with the broth and made gravy before adding teh meat, onions & mushrooms.  I also added some steak seasoning to the meat.  Served with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts.  Delish!

Definitely will make again. The only change that I made is my thing—I make a beef broth flour slurry to thicken the gravy and always add a bit of soup base to give depth to the gravy.

Next time, I’ll sauté the onions and mushrooms first, then add the meat patties. Brown them, then add the beef broth. 

These are just my cooking methods though. Recipe is great as it stands.

I replaced 1 cup of beef broth with a can of condensed French onion soup and only used 1/2 of a large onion, sliced.  That was plenty.   I did make the mistake of using canned mushrooms since I didn't have fresh.  Won't do that again, they were rubbery.  But all in all, it was delicious.   I'll definitely make it again

It was pretty good but the gravy was a little bland the patty was great I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and a couple splashes worstecher. If I make it again I will pan fry the onion and mushroom a little more before adding in the beef broth to build up that flavor. I served over egg noodles which was  a perfect pairing

I made as instructed, however gravy not as thick or as brown as I would have liked. Flavor was spot on. I will try again with some tweeks.

Easy and flavorful - a definitely improvement over the cheap frozen Salisbury steaks my husband likes (and I don't).  He doesn't often tell me something is good when I try a new recipe, but he did on this one.  It's definitely going into my regular rotation, with a side of  mashed potatoes and vegetable or salad.  I did add a couple of teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce to the meat and think I'll tweak it a little more next time.

Have made several times, both with and without mushrooms (fresh or canned).  Family seems to enjoy prefer recipe without mushrooms.  I usually make extra gravy (topping for potatoes).  We always enjoy it.  I recommend using leaner meat, 85% or leaner, if possible, to minimize fat to be drained and for better flavor.

I made this recipe tonight for dinner. The only addition, like another reviewer, was to add some Montreal Steak Seasoning and Onion soup mix, about 2 TBLS, each to the hamburger.  I always make my hamburgers this way as I prefer a nicely seasoned burger. I prepared everything else the same. The amount of beef broth to cornstarch and water was perfect and the consistency of the gravy was very good. I only made four patties, we had two tonight and have leftovers for tomorrow, which makes my husband very happy, as he LOVED this recipe. Thanks for the perfect recipe.

Delicious comfort food! I followed the recipe ingredients, but did saute the onion and mushrooms then added the broth. It came out great!  The sauce was just right and there was plenty. I served it over egg noodles. I will definitely make this again.

I have finally found a simplistic Salisbury Steak recipe that is now one of my favorites...
As I am learning to thicken sauces, I find that adding a bit more liquid to the corn starch prior to pouring it in the pan will help produce an even textured brown gravy with little to no lumps...Other than that, very simple to put together....
Thank you....

This was a great recipe.  I only made a couple of changes.  I mixed a 1/2 package of onion soup mix into the ground meat which hit the spot and made it very tasty.  I did not have mushrooms so I  added black pepper plus some onion powder into the gravy.  I used a lot less corn starch, only added enough to make it as thick as I liked it.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and it was really quick and easy to make.

Very simple to make and the Salisbury Steak patties are quite tasty. Only reason I gave it only 4 stars was that I found the gravy to be a bit bland. I added a package of Pioneer Brown Gravy to it, as well as a good amount of pepper, and that seemed to make up the discrepancy. Nice recipe; thanks!

I don't think I can ever make a recipe EXACTLY as written.  For the most part I did this one.  I used all of her ingredients added Worcestershire Sauce to the meat and sautéed the onions and mushrooms in the meat drippings after I seared the patties.  Fantastic meal served over egg noodles.

I love Salisbury steak and usually I just get the freezer kind and bake it but this recipe is so delicious and easy that I will NEVER eat frozen Salisbury steak again. Using this recipe it was even faster than the freezer kind. The gravy was so delicious and flavorful. This is definitely a new favorite recipe for me

I made it with vegetable broth, so it wasn't quite as good as I think it would be with   beef broth.  I was going to add some Kitchen Bouquet, but I was out.  I think that would add depth to the sauce.

So delicious! I added the dry onion soup mix, fresh mushrooms and baked at 350 for 30 minutes after browning the patties. Oh and don't forget  to add some worcestershire in the cornstarch mix.

Turned out really good. Great flavor. I did use a can of French onion soup to help make the gravy because I wound up putting the onion in the meat mixture, I didn’t see any directions on using some of the onion for the gravy. I like onion but that was to much for the one pound of meat. Made mashed potatoes and fresh green beans to go with it.

The flavor and amount of veggies were AMAZING.  The only issue was the consistency of the gravy....it was a little gelatinous    and off-putting. I woud appreciate any suggestions of how to make a smoother (Mom's) gravy!

My family enjoyed this.  My son who has refused to eat salisbury steak for years inhaled this and said to make it again.  I added garlic to the gravy because we love it and a little bit of packaged gravy mix to thicken it but otherwise followed the recipe.

Fantastic recipe! My family LOVED it! 
Made it per the recipe except I added a bit of Montreal Steak Seasoning to the gravy, We served it over mashed potatoes with a side of buttered carrots.  This will definitely be made again in this house!

One of my Favs as a kid (way back when....) Nice alternative to Meat Loaf. Quick and easy to prepare. I used 2 cups of mushrooms, otherwise followed the recipe. Served with mashed and Brussel sprouts. The gravy is the game changer, so make lots. This may just replace the meat loaf for now in our house!

This was exactly what I was looking for in a Saisbury steak. It was enough like those frozen dinners to satisfy my craving but fresher, heartier and sans mystery ingredients. I made it exactly as written except I removed the steaks after browning and sauteed the onions & mushrooms on their own before returning them to the pan to finish cooking. I also added a splash of Worcestershire as I love that flavor with beef & mushrooms. Served with mashed potatoes & corn it was the perfect comfort food for a chilly evening.

I may have not read the recipe correctly, just need to remember to place the patties back in the gravy to simmer and cook for a bit - helps tremendously. Lol

Came out kind of bland. I'll definitely be tweaking the seasoning next time, maybe adding some Worcestershire or Maggi. All in all, though pretty good.

Absolutely delicious! Can't wait to make it again. Even my son who's a super picky eater, ate his whole plate and asked for more!

Easy comfort food. I made half the batch as meatballs because my kids are more likely to eat things in meatball form ;)

I gave this dish 5 stars because we like it well enough the first time that I made it again!  With mashed potatoes and a good green-bean side dish, with a Mandarin-Orange Jello for dessert, this is one of the best  meals to eat.  With the orange and green from the jello and green beans to the white, fluffy, mashed potatoes, brown meat and gravy, and tanned roll, it is a very colorful and textural meal.  Delicious and good enough for company too!  Oh, don't forget the rolls so you can clean your plate!   And, be sure to have whipped cream for your jello!

Followed recipe exactly using 85% lean grass fed beef.  Great comfort food, reminded me of childhood.   The only adjustment I would make going forward  is adding more mushroom.   Noteworthy:  if you don't use cornstarch often for thickening, mix it slowly with boiling water (water first), to avoid clumping.

I actually doubled the recipe, and the only problem I had was that I had to cook the  patties in two batches! Everything fit in the larger pan to finish, and it was delicious! No adjustments on the ingredients, other than doubling them.

So easy to make!!! And my boyfriend loved it!! Definitely a keeper! I followed the suggestions from one that added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and a1 teaspoon of Worcestershire! No need to sauté onions and mushrooms first! I got this recipe from Allrecipes magazine!

Wow! My family raved about this. Added garlic powder, Worcester & parsley to the gravy too. Would reduce the broth to 1 cup & reduce onions in patties but this the first meal in awhile that got 5 star reviews at my house. Thanks for making me a rock star!!

I had all ingredients...made it up browned and refrigerated the patties; and made gravy separately for eating day after tomorrow. Smells delicious. Took advice from others added more seasoning and more onions and mushrooms cause I had them. Will make fresh mashed to go with and a green salad. Helps me to cook ahead for use during a busy  work week when I have no imagination :).

Turned out terribly. The gravy was too lumpy and the breading sticks to everything so you have to keep reapplying it. Will look for a different recipe for next time.

It was a hit. My boo said it was the best thing he had ever eaten. You could of sworn the gray was made by a professional chef. I was wary at first since you do not drain the fat off. It all came together. I did not change anything other than adding more pepper, that is just personal preference, and a splash of Worcestershire sauce to the gravy.  As someone else suggested I wanted to make it according to the recipe before revising the recipe.

Fantastic recipe!  Super easy to make.  Made as is and it was delicious.  My husband asks for me to make this all the time.   Reminds me of the foil TV dinners but much tastier since it’s made from scratch!

Delicious! Followed a reviewer’s recommendation and took the patties out while I did an initial cook on the onions and mushrooms. Also added a splash of Worcestershire to the final gravy.  Served with mashed potatoes and peas. Perfect meal.

Great recipe. Paired it with egg noodles and mixed vegetables. Reminded me of the frozen kind I had as a child but fresh!  Only change was to add garlic (love garlic) and taking patties out to sauté mushrooms and onions before adding stock.

Hubs, "This is delicious!"  What more can I say?  Served it with peas and mashed potatoes.  Doubled the gravy.  Can't wait for lunch tomorrow!

Thanks for the recipe!

My only change,  at the end, l added the burgers and put everything into the oven over a low heat, and let everything blend for a few hours.  Loved it.

This was so good. I added a pack of Lipton mushroom and onion soup mix in with the beef mixture and only put in half an onion for the gravy mix and thought it was perfect. Definately will be making this again.

Made it exactly as written and hubby said it's one to repeat.  He loved the gravy.  My comment is that 1# of ground beef makes 4 very small patties so I made just 3 of them but that's our personal opinion.

I doubled the recipe and added a little more onion and mushroom then required but other then that I did not make any changes. It came out GREAT. It was my first time making Salisbury steak and I will be making this gobs of times in the future. The only issue I had was with the cornstarch. That was a little tricky to me but I got it. Great Recipe. Cant wait to make it again!

I made this tonight for myself and two sons. The meal was extremely easy and quick to make,  and an absolute hit all around!! I followed the recipe except , I removed the patties and sauteed the onions and mushrooms, then returned the patties to the pan. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans. I will be making this again, thank you for the recipe!!!!

I would give this a 5 star rating but I did make a few tweaks:

Instead of 1/3 a cup of bread crumbs, I used a half cup.  
I also used 3 cups of beef broth because I prefer more gravy.

I also cook my patties 100% through, remove them, then saute my onions and mushrooms, then make my gravy.. once my corn starch has been added and my gravy is thickened, I add the patties back to the pan.

The Salisbury steak turned out great.  I used ground turkey instead of beef but it was wonderful.

One of the easiest 'from scratch' versions of this recipe. I added some Worcester's sauce to liven up the gravy as it simmered and served with some German egg noodles instead of potatoes. Definitely will be putting this dinner in to rotation!

Hands down a perfect recipe!!  I've never been good at making gravy though so I use 2 pkgs dry gravy mix ( one onion & 1 brown ) instead & it's perfect every time.  Fast weeknight meal & also have made this for company to rave reviews!!

Pretty good. Didn't add the onion to the meat mix because there was so much onion in the gravy. But it was still pretty good. I will probably make this again.

I have made this recipe several times and my husband & I absolutely LOVE it. I don't change a thing to the recipe except I sometimes leave the onions out of the gravy. But I was trying to come up with something different for our Super bowl party and decided to make this into Salisbury steak meatballs. OMG! There was nothing left! I got rave reviews! I used a cookie scoop, put them on parchment paper and baked them at 325* until done (15-20 mins). I made the gravy separately and added the meatballs just prior to serving. Serve then over egg noodles or mashed potatoes and enjoy the accolades!

MADE THIS FIRST TIME.  IDK WHY cause I'm not a trained chef, but this tastes great.  Must be the recipe.  Easy, and I will serve this to guests in the future.  Didn't have any beef broth so used chix stock instead.  Too lazy to make mashed potatoes so I peel ed and cubed a giant russet and nuked it for 7 minutes.  Then just mixed the cubed potato  with  the sauce.  Perfect . I Cr 13:8a, Love never fails !

Very delicious as is.  We did use bison meat instead of ground beef but I know that if we would of used ground beef it would of been just as good. I do recommend making the patties on the thinner side for better flavor and faster cooking.

Hubby and I really enjoyed this good old fashion truck stop favorite.  The only changes I made because of what I had available, were seasoned bread crumbs and canned mushrooms, yes, organic canned mushrooms.  Forgive me, but fresh mushroom don't keep very long and if you drain the mushrooms really well and saute them up,    they work in a pinch.  I used flour, 3 T., to thicken up the gravy by adding after I browned the hamburgers and it turned out perfect for us.

a bisquick recipe for Salisbury steak has been my go-to for years. NEWS FLASH!!! It has just been replaced by this one! It was amazing! I used a 95% lean ground beef and served it with mashed potatoes. No changes are needed. It's absolutely perfect as written!

Simple and delicious! Comfort food on a weeknight! I was thinking the steaks might taste like meatloaf but not at all, the gravy really soaks into the steaks. We are not big onion fans but the gravy with the onions pair perfectly together.

I love this recipe. I do feel as though more than 1 tbsp of oil is needed, the onions burn fairly quickly when sliced thin. If you want gravy to pour over the top, then definitely double the gravy recipe. Most of the patties soak up the gravy by the end of the cooking time.

Update: Made this a second time using store bought beef broth instead of Better than Bouillon and it was relatively flavorless.

This recipe was excellent. I only had two tablespoons of corn starch so I adjusted the water to two tablespoons as well. I also reduced the salt. This is a ‘make again’ recipe.

I’ve made this before exactly as directed and it was amazing. Today I made it with an equal amount of quinoa subbed for the bread crumbs as I am gluten sensitive. And it still came out delicious!! Didn’t affect the texture at all! I was skeptical of the lack of herbs and spices, but it didn’t need it at all! I did add some sautéed garlic, and I sautéed the chopped onions as well. I intended to sauté the onions for the gravy but forgotten do it before the meat and didn’t wanna dirty another pan. Next time I will though- they were good enough but I think the flavor and texture would have been better if I had sautéed them first. Overall excellent recipe!! Thank you!!!

This turned out great. The only thing I did different was to take the patties out and sweat the onions and mushrooms for a few minutes because I thought they might not be done enough. That was probably not necessary but I’m kinda particular. I wouldn’t change a thing but if I was I might throw I sprig or two of thyme while the gravy cooks the meat through. This recipe just doesn’t need to be messed with in my opinion.

This was a huge hit with my boyfriend. It was delicious, hearty, and the perfect weekend dinner. I took the advice of a few others and added a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce. We'll be making this again and again.

I made this recipe using ground turkey and it was great. I added a little powdered garlic to the meat and a drizzle of heavy cream to make it moist.

I made this tonight and I'm quite pleased. Very easy and very tasty too. I like that it's low carb as well. I added the onion to the meat mixture, but not to the gravy. (Just a little too much onion for me). Otherwise, I made it exactly as written. I'm glad I doubled the recipe, because it was a big hit! I've added this to my favorites.

Pretty darned good!  I doubled the recipe and cooked it in our large oblong electric frying pan.  Served as suggested with mashed potatoes and green beans.  I thought it was a little light on salt.  And so filling!  Next time I will not make them so thick, so it will take more pans.

I cooked the mushrooms and sauce in a separate pan and added about 1/2 tsp of steak seasoning to the sauce (my beef broth was low sodium and it needed a little extra flavor).  Very big hit with my family and so easy, definitely a keeper!

This was a popular dish last night!  I've never done Salisbury steak since I think of onions when it comes to mind and my hubby hates them. But, this recipe inspired me to try it.  I just replaced onion for mini yellow/red/orange peppers and it was delicious!  Only thing I didn't like was the corn starch- I could taste it a bit and may use flour instead next time.  Otherwise the recipe was a hit!!

We followed the recipe as instructed. The gravy turned out a little on the thick side so I think next time we will keep the beef broth out and add some as needed. All & all it was very good, and we will make it again.

Tasted okay.  Meat was fine but far too many onions (I do like onions) and gravy was bland.  Next time I would cut onion in half and use canned or powdered beef gravy mix.  Might add some seasoning to the beef too.

When adding cornstarch and water at end, you might want to use a whisk.  Found it took longer than a minute to thicken.  Might as well make this with 2 lbs of meat while you've got all the ingredients out, then freeze extras. 2nd TRY: really had a problem blending the cornstarch, ended up with white specks throughout.

This is a very simple and tasty comfort food.  I've made it three times.  The only thing I do differently , is use dried onion instead of fresh, mixed with the meat.  

I have a knack for making things backwards and have to find ways to fix it.  If you make the mushroom/onion/broth first, just put the cooked mixture in a large measuring cup (I had a 4cup).  Clean out the pan, fry the patties, remove the grease, then add the broth mixture back into the pan.  Easy fix.

This recipe is great with potatoes and corn (or peas).

Pretty good, I would make again.

 I didn't have breadcrumbs so used large flake oatmeal instead and less onions as our family doesn't LOVE them. I also added garlic to the meat mixture before I cooked it. Next time I would add more mushrooms and not add salt to the meat prior to cooking as it seemed salty.

The flavor was great, the texture was a bit like meatloaf rather than salisbury steak.  I would probably eliminate the bread crumbs and egg and go for the plain patty style.    Otherwise everyone really enjoyed it.  I do have to agree that it lacked flavor but that is an easy fix.  Definitely needed some salt.  I will try adding a little Worcestershire sauce next time.  What I really liked about it was that it made plenty of gravy for leftovers!  It was still delicious!
Thanks for sharing!

The only change I made was not to use mushrooms. It turned out great. My wife was skeptical but loved it.

This was ok but nothing that blew my mind. I know Salisbury steak is pretty basic. If you are just looking for a solid Salisbury steak recipe this is it. It was just a little to plain tasting for me.

This was so good.  I will  never buy frozen salisbury steak again.  My husband love it too.  The only thing I did was add garlic powder to the hamburger meat plus the onion.  Followed the recipe as is and had it over mashed potatoes.  It was the best and a nice change.  I will make this again next month.  Thanks for sharing.

Great flavor, I would recommend removing 3/4th of the onions before adding cornstarch or it's just too oniony.

This recipe was better than I expected. I'm always improvising this for that but with this I only added diced red pepper. I served it with the gravy on the side and a side of steamed rice. It was amazing! Everyone loved it.

Can't give anything a 5. Nothing is perfect BUT this is an excellent recipe. With mashed potatoes, the sauce compliments well when poured over them. Add more onions, used bella mushrooms (add more mushroom as well) both cook down in the sauce. Also, do not drain hamburger grease, cook all together with sauce ingredients . Add an additional teaspoon of starch to thicken more. I cooked the meat in the sauce with onion and shrooms. Excellent outcome! Filling too. Added asparagus spears (potato peel the stalks for removal of fibrous material)  What a combo!

I’ve made this recipe a few times and my family and I love it! It turns out perfect every time. I’ve served it with egg noodles but the favorite side per request of the fam is mashed potatoes and green beans with onion and bacon. This has now become a staple in my house and I get request for it from the kids at lest a few time during the colder months. I have no issues with their request when it’s so easy and so so delicious. Thanks so much for this recipe!

I made this and followed the comments suggestions of adding Worcestershire to the meat mix and instead of cornstarch and water I added 1/2 cup water and 1 packet of McCormick brown gravy mix. It was really good and will make again.

I made two batches of this so I had enough for the next day. Turn out it tastes amazing fresh out of the oven and reheated as well!!!!  I used cream of mushroom on one of the batches but I preferred the original recipe.

What a delicious change from the usual , an old favourite years ago .
Only change I made was using a gravy thickener instead of roux to make gravy and a dash of Worcester sauce .
Comfort food at its best!

It tasted really good. Served with mashers. My husband liked it too. Definitely will go into rotation. The only is was that the meat was a little tough. Maybe because I used a lean 7% fat.

Great recipe!  I doubled it to feed more people.  I am a  total Californian and Salisbury Steak is not  a common thing here but I truly enjoyed this dish.  I did add garlic and seasoning to the meat mixture. Served over  white rie. Thumbs up!

My husband loved it! It was good to me just not my favorite type of meal. I would definitely us less chopped onions in the meat mix. I did add fresh mushrooms to the gravy, which was good. I'd also leave out the onions in the gravy, too many for me. I'd probably cook it again for my husband. It was pretty quick and easy to make.

Excellent! I add add dried parsley and Italian seasoning to the beef, and extra mushrooms and onions because I like them.

Very good recipe. I make this frequently and occasionally omit the mushrooms if I don't have any - it's great with or without.

Delicious! I made very few changes. I added garlic salt in meat mixture, omitted mushrooms (hubs hates them), added red bell peppers to the gravy because I had it, and used flour/oil because I couldn't find my corn starch. My 4&6yo devoured it and my husband is asking for me to double and make again tomorrow! Will def make the rotation!! Served with some leftover mashed potatoes and fresh sautéed green beans. ??????

This was really good following the tips of Tracey Ferrari Posner. Even my 12 yo inhaled it and he hates mushrooms and onions. I did omit the egg due to allergies and used angus ground beef and fresh mushrooms, not canned. Cracked peppercorn and a higher end beef broth that dilutes. It was very tasty. Will try it with the dry onion mix next time if the sodium is low. Served up with mashed potatoes and corn for the kids and a salad for me. Thanks for the share :)

I make this a lot! Tastes like the frozen kind, that we had as a treat, when I was little. Now, that stuff tastes like dog food. I had to learn how to make it from scratch. Thanks!!

This was the best Salisbury steak I have ever made. I loved the flavor of the meat and the gravy. My kids felt it was a little to onion-y for them but that is what I loved. I did omit the mushrooms because we are not a mushroom loving group here but I am sure it would be just as delicious with them. Thank you for a great recipe!

It was 9/10 perfect following the recipe exactly. The meat was so soft and perfectly tender. I'd reduce the beef broth to 1.5 cups, but I also live in a very high humidity climate. Definitely making it again!

Yes I used  one packet Lipton onion soup mix and 1 packet mushroom gravy, I caramelized the onions and mushroom in olive oil and butter with a bit of pink salt and black pepper, then added a cup of white wine and simmered for 10 min then added the beef broth, water and gravy and soup mix.   1/2 of soup mix went in the meat patty mix.

This dish was a huge hit in my house, actually both my husband and my father in law both asking the next day when I would be making it again next. I did take the advice from some of the previous reviews to remove the patties before adding in the beef stock. I then mixed the beef stock, mushrooms and onions, which I partially cooked before adding, etc to complete the gravy mixture and added the patties back to the pan and simmered everything together :)

The sauce is really good. My wife's not a big meat eater and said I could give her that sauce on toast and she'd be happy. Next time I think I'd saute the onion and mushrooms a little before adding them into the sauce and meat. They didn't cook down so I had to cook the sauce a lot longer after removing the meat. I'll make it again.

Made as directed. Only thing I found was after I added the cornstarch/water mix, the sauce thickened up a little too much and I need to add a bit more liquid to thin it back a bit. Taste was wonderful. Easy to make. Thank you.

I made this exactly as written and got rave reviews.  It was terrific!  Used canned mushrooms, as fresh weren't exactly specified in the recipe.  We really enjoyed this and put this recipe on our list of "frequent favorites" to make again.  Very easy and tasty.  Fail proof, too.

Made this tonight and it was an absolute hit! My husband, grandson, sister and brother and nieces and nephew loved it and went back for more. The pot was clean. I followed it to the tee except in the broth mixture I added lil garlic powder and an envelope of onion mix and about a tbsp sugar.

Made this tonight and was a bit disappointed with it. I made the recipe as written, but the gravy was bland. My husband & kids ate it and liked it, but there was something that was missing. Perhaps as someone else suggested, it needed Worcestershire sauce. The meat was great. Not sure if I'll make it again unless I decide how to improve the gravy.

Great recipe! Looking for some comfort food, here it is! Cook the recipe as is, or you can modify the recipe to meet a low-carb diet.  The recipe still turned out perfectly.  I served it with mashed-cauliflower garlic mash instead of potatoes! I have to admit, this turned out so delicious, I also loved it!

This was very easy to make and it turned out great with no changes to the recipe.  The gravy is delicious. I served it the first night with mashed potatoes and the second night with egg noodles.  If I tweak it at all, I will probably add a bit of A-1 or Worcestershire sauce just to give it a little kick.

I made this and it turned out great, but I did make changes therefore I can not rate it a 5.  I added a little worchester sauce to the gravy and I split a packet of dry onion soup mix 50/50 between the gravy and the patties.  Thanks for the recipe.

I will definitely make this again.  It didn't need any add-ins!  It was perfect by itself; of course using great venison burger may have contributed to the lovely taste!

First attempt at making salisbury steak. The recipe is simple enough and figured I would give it a try. I used crimini mushrooms quartered and double what is required. I was pretty disappointed with the gravy until I added a fair amount of salt and pepper. This really relies on a good broth so make sure you choose wisely. As for the steak, I was shocked at the flavor it seemed to have and definitely hit the comforting spot. I think there are some minor enhancements to the gravy but I would not change a thing on the steak!

For us two, dinner is always a big deal and is the main "come together" meal in our home. You can have whatever for breakfast and lunch, but DINNER is set in stone and will always be something delicious. I prepared and served this recipe last night. Oh my, comfort food at it's best! I did not have bread crumbs and substituted the same amount with old-fashioned oatmeal. Also chopped the onion in small bits as I do not like to deals with rings of anything. Simmered in the thickened gravy on low temp for about an hour while sides (white rice and spinach) and dessert (apple dumplings) were being prepared. Will definitely be making this again and again!

The only difference from my recipe to the one listed above is I added Pepperidge farm cornbread stuffing mix instead of breadcrumbs . I also had to triple the recipe because I have four grown men in my home that I have to feed . They all loved it and told me great job ! Two days in a row from my cooking dry spell !

Loved this dish but...I added 1T Worcestershire sauce to the meat mix to punch it up, along with salt, pepper and a dollop of Worcestershire to the gravy. Otherwise, it's a keeper.

Good recipe, although I made some changes. used ground lean turkey, omitted onions from patties, replaced plain bread crumbs for herb flavored dry stuffing, seasoned with onion and garlic powder in addition to s&p and used packet of brown gravy instead of making homemade gravy. Still yummy. I made some mashed potatoes on the side. very easy and good recipe to have on hand when money is tight. :)

Execellent recipie, season to your personal preference and its perfect. I severed it over rice, best salisbury steaks ive ever tried! Since didnt have breadcrumbs i substituted for crushed crackers in the meat mixture, also when i was making the gravy, since i didnt have cornstarch.  i made a rou with butter and flour in a separate pan and mixed that into the broth/onion/mushroom mix to thickin gravy in place of the cornstarch. I would definitely recommend this recipe! the "steaks" stay together perfectly and where nice and moist. And the onion mushroom ratio for the gravy is spot on

Made per recipe. Delicious and comes together quickly with ingredients already on hand. Good for a weekday meal served with a vegetable or salad and mashed potatoes. Makes ample gravy.

I added Lipton Onion mushroom soup mix as another rater suggested,  half to the beef and half to the gravy, and some Worcestershire into the thickener.  I also added red and orange peppers to the onions and mushrooms.  I sauteed the veggies first before adding the broth.  The patties were very tasty, but I found the gravy somewhat bland.  Needs something to give it a little more zing - soy sauce maybe?

Whether this turns out or not entirely depends on the broth you use. Bland, flavorless, colorless as other comments say, just means you used crappy broth. I omit breadcrumbs and thicken the sauce with whatever flour/starch I have on hand. 

I thought this recipe would be bland but I find it full of flavor as is.

Always a great hit in this house, I labeled it as a 4 Star because of the amount of onions it calls for inside the meat. It’s just WAY too much and overpowers the flavor!

Was delicious. I did add a clove of garlic to the meat mix. Did the patties in the oven for 20 mins and then added them to the thickened sauce and simmered on low on the stove top for 10 minutes. It's a make again for me

This was wonderful!  I didn't use any onion. Instead, used fresh mushrooms saluted in a couple teaspoons of butter, 2 cups broth and a smudge of wine with the cornstarch. We will have this again!

I followed it pretty much as directed, might have had extra onions and more pepper (we like lots of pepper in our house) and it turned out awesome!  The next time I prepare I will probably add garlic in some way to it.  A great alternative to ground sirloin that was super easy for a weeknight dinner!

Made as written but doubled the recipe and served over egg noodles.  Preparation was much faster than the recipe I usually follow.  It was good, but next time I will double or triple the mushrooms and add a splash of Worcestershire or Sherry to the gravy.  When I'm pressed for time I will try just browning crumbled ground meat instead of making the patties.  Also, I will try adding egg noodles while it simmers to make it a one pot meal.

Easy and family loved it my Grandkids 4 and 6 and their parents. I did cook onions and mushrooms and added garlic cause we love garlic, but was flavorful and tender.

With a little tweaking in the seasoning dept this is definitely comfort food. I cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp and that's plenty. I add 2 cloves of garlic run through a rasp, 1 Tb of steak sauce, 1/2 tsp of fresh thyme leaves. I double the amount of gravy because we like to have mashed potatoes along with these and we like lots of gravy. One nice thing about this is that we're having it again the next night and except for what ever fresh vegetable I'm fixing, the meat and potatoes are already cooked.

This was excellent. I only added garlic to the meat and gravy. Wonderful with mashed potatoes. Will certainly add this to my recipes as a regular meal.

Delish!!   The only thing I added was a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, which I add to all recipes when using ground meat!

Will make again.

I followed the recipe as written, it was the best Salisbury steak I've ever made. My son and daughter in law agreed too. Thanks for sharing this.

I tried this recipe originally because it was the only not listing canned mushroom soup.  This recipe is very good!  I've made as written several times, I now add 2 cloves of minced garlic to the meat mix and use cold milk to mix up the corn starch instead of water.  It makes the gravy a bit creamier.

I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, then after browning the patties, I removed them from the pan and browned the onions and mushrooms and removed them from the pan. I next made a quick roux of flour and butter and added the beef broth (Better Than Bouillon). Once the broth started to thicken, I added the patties and mushrooms/onions. I served this over my quick homemade mashed potatoes and had an incredibly happy SO! very tasty!

We thought this was very tasty.  I omitted the mushrooms because we don't like them. And, I didn't have an onion so substituted dry onion soup. We served it over pasta and had the leftovers the next day.

made this tonight!!! it was great. i did tweak it a little. used italian seasoning & italian bread crumbs for the ground beef instead of salt & pepper. browned the outside of the patties in the pan & popped it in the oven for about 20 minutes to finish off while i made the sauce. the last time i made a salisbury steak recipe, i used pre-made hamburger patties. No flavor at all!!! i eyeballed every ingredient because i cook for a really big family & i dont have the time to measure everything out!!! everything came out really good!!! saving this to the books!!! thank you for the recipe!!!

I doubled the recipe and used a lb of ground pork in addition to the ground beef (just because I had it in the fridge leftover from another recipe).  I added some finely chopped onions to the meat mix and made them smaller (2 lbs of meat made 10 patties).  My husband said this was the best meal he's had in a while.  We took it for leftovers at work and he said it was just as good the next day.  He's already told me to keep this one in the rotation.  He said the gravy is the best he's ever had.

Made it, family loved it.  Sauteed the onion and mushroom a bit before adding the broth because I prefer the flavor.   Added wine because I like to cook with it and found it needed nothing else.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

I am not a huge mushroom fan but my hubby likes them. I will say this is the best Salisbury steak I've ever had and to top it off I made it from scratch!??

I made this and served it with mashed red potatoes and steamed green beans.  The gravy lacked flavor and was not good.  I had to resort to packaged brown gravy mix.  Would have to rethink the gravy if doing again.

Made this for dinner and my husband loved it! I didn't have beef broth so I used beef onion soup and I also added minced garlic and bell peppers this was so good! Will be making it again soon.

Made this last night for supper.  Not hard to make.  Added a little extra pepper, a dab of Worcestershire Sauce, and some random steak seasoning I found in the spice rack.  Pretty tasty.  Served with Mashed Potatoes and mixed veggies.  Good chance I will make this again!

I had ground beef, and I was tired of making my usual meatloaf, so I looked for a Salisbury steak recipe.  There were quite a few recipes to choose from, but I selected this one for a couple of reasons:  1)  The ingredients were all familiar and in my pantry, 2)  It didn't use canned soup for the gravy.  While I think it needs a little more seasoning (salt, garlic, maybe a little red wine?), it was really good as is.  I can see this gravy becoming a staple item in my house.  The instructions were really easy to follow, and everything came out exactly right.   My husband said it reminded him of eating TV dinners in his childhood in the best way possible.  We give it four thumbs up!!

This is comfort/kid food the way it should be. Simple, yet good. I didn't find it under spiced myself, but I liked it best when I mixed it with mashed potatoes (I used the recipe for suzy's mashed reds).

Great.  I caramelized the chopped onions before adding to the meat and before adding to the beef broth. I also added a couple of swigs of Worcester sauce. I use a brown gravy packet instead of using corn starch. Brings extra flavor.

Instead of using salt and pepper I decided to use Montreal steak seasoning. I didn't care for adding breadcrumbs or egg to the mixture. I served it with mashed potatoes and vegetables.

Not only is this a great recipe, but I have a picky 5 year old at home I am unable to get to eat, and he absolutely LOVES this and asks for it for dinner!!!  I highly recommend trying this recipe, especially for other Moms with picky eaters! Of course, Moms please note: I told him it was a SpongeBob krabby patty!

I made this with hardly any changes! All I did was add salt to the sauce (bc I used no sodium beef broth) and then I added chopped jalapenos to the patties. I will for sure make this again and I even recommended to coworkers. YUM!

Made this recipe exactly as written (minus the mushrooms since I don't like them) twice now. The second time I used an 85/15 ground chuck.  They were so much more flavorful than when I used lean ground round. Highly recommend it.

This recipe was easy & delish! Now my 6 year old doesn't like mushrooms or onions so I made a separate gravy to give to him. (1 cup of beef broth, bring to a boil, add in 1&1/2 tbsp of constrach & water mixed) & he loved it! So easy to make

Very good! My family loved it. I added a little more spice (touch of garlic and more pepper)and a lot more mushrooms. Next time I would switch out the cornstarch for flour. But overall GREAT!! We licked our plates clean

I made a few changes to this and it was EXCELLENT!  I added 1/4 tsp. smoked paprika to the meat mixture. After I browned the patties in a Dutch oven, I removed them from the pan, sautéed the onions for a few minutes, added a8 oz. sliced Crimini mushrooms, then 2 cloves of chopped garlic. When the mushrooms were about done, I added 2 Tbsp. tomato paste and browned the whole mixture, then deglazed the pan with 1/4 C Merlot. I reduced that until the wine was almost gone, then added the rest of the ingredients, put the patties back in and simmered covered for about 1/2 hour. I again removed the patties and added the cornstarch slurry, made a gravy, and put the patties back in to serve.

Great taste! Doubled the recipe for 8. Took advice of other reviewers and removed patties before boiling broth mixture. Because I didn't have a large enough pan to hold all 8 patties and sauce I baked them (covered with foil) in a glass 9x13 dish for 10 min at 425 degrees. Moved to serving dish and poured the broth back in same stovetop pan to make the gravy. Turned out wonderfully. Thanks.

Will definitely make again! Cooked recipe exactly as stated, only doubled it all except for the corn starch, used only what the recipe called for, and used Montreal Steak seasoning in the meat mixture - 1T/lb of beef, and maybe a Tbsp or two of Worsteshire. Very quick, easy, and delicious!

Freaking YUM!!!!!!!  The only change I made was adoing a pinch of salt to the gravy at the end.  This was easy, low calorie, and DELICIOUS.  It will be one of our staple foods around here!

Great stuff. Make sure you use a slightly fatty ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat) for a tastier bit. If its too lean it has no flavor.

Super easy to make. Loved the texture of the sauce. I did add some montreal steak seasoning and  worcestershire sauce , as suggested and omitted the mushrooms. 
I never had the luxury of eating homemade salisbury steak only microwaved meals growing up, boy was I deprived. 
This is a great meal, hope to make it a tad healthier next time. Maybe mixing up some ingredients, to a light option.

I tweaked, but this recipe deserves the spotlight for being an awesome base recipe.  It only needed about 2 tsp of cornstarch for thickening. I cut the salt, and added garlic powder & a little Italian seasoning. I ran out of eggs at breakfast, so without an egg, I decided to substitute about a 1/4 cup mayo.  Since mayo is zippy, I cut the salt to a 1/2 tsp.  I had chopped green onions in the freezer, so those were the onions I used.  I didn't use as much onion as the recipe called for ( 1/4 c in the meat, & about 1/3 c for the gravy).  The crumbs on hand were Panko & instead of beef broth, I keep "Better than Bouillon" beef base in the fridge--I used about a tsp & added water as needed, a bit at a time.  I made many smaller patties with the pound of beef & let them simmer after browning. I did add Worcestershire before simmering (couple of splashes), per other reviewer suggestions. The broth in the meat seemed bland at that point, so I removed the patties, added the corn starch, and sprinkled in garlic powder (not quite an 1/8 tsp).  It still needed something, & since other reviewers added Lipton soup mix, which I didn't have, I added about about 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning. I didn't have any mushrooms, so they were left out & weren't missed.  It turned out really great :-)  I'm keeping my version with mayo instead of egg.  I don't think  the type of onion mattered, & I'm sure fresh garlic rather than garlic powder would have been better....next time.

Enjoyed it very much.  Never made it before.  I used seasoned bread crumbs and approx 3/4 tablespoon of onion soup mix with the bread crumbs.  I used a can of low salt/ fat cream of mushroom soup with the 2 cups of beef broth.  At the end I added 1.5 tspoon of soya sauce for a bit more floor colour and flavour.  The structure of the recipe is perfect, but all like to make each recipe our own.  Thank you for an excellent foundation recipe

We had to double the recipe because we have so many children. We all liked it. Turned out pretty good. It just seems like its missing a little seasoning and can't quite put a finger on it. Overall it was pretty good. We will make this again in the future.

This was very easy to make, and tasty!  I used a little Marsala wine to dissolve the corn starch for the gravy, and added a dash of Worchestershire sauce and thyme leaves.  Next time I'll use more mushrooms, and  saute them with the onions to add a little more savory flavor after browning the patties in the skillet.  I also think I'll pat the meat a little thinner - they drew up into giant meatballs this time.   Served with mashed potatoes and peas - our household favorite combo.  Will definitely make this again!

Great recipe! Added a dash of Worcestershire sauce and garlic to hamburger mix. Sautéed the mushroom and onion prior to adding broth and corn starch mixture and added patties to simmer for 15 minutes. Served with mashed potato and sautéed spinach. Brown & serve rolls were perfect for cleaning up the gravy!  Perfect easy cold weather meal. It's a keeper -thanks for sharing!

I wanted to try something different with ground meat, I followed this recipe exactly but was very disappointed with the result. My husband said it was like eating soggy hamburgers! The texture  was unpleasant and it wasn't as flavorful as I'd expected. I won't be making this again

Let me start by saying that I hate to see a recipe rated based on changes that the cook made. I gave this recipe 5 stars because I think the base recipe is great as is. That being said, I did make alterations based on my personal preferences. I used seasoned salt and seasoned bread crumbs, and I added fresh garlic, garlic powder, and onion powder to the meat mixture. I also sauteed the onions and mushrooms. This was a hit at our house. My picky 6 year old said I should have a cooking show, and my teenager who is not a fan of salisbury steak had seconds. I doubled the recipe and it was still quick and easy. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!
The burgers looked a little lacking in terms of spice. So here what I did: I had halved the recipe, so to that I added half a finely chopped habanero pepper (without seeds), fresh oregano, and fresh basil, both finely chopped. 

I left the sauce at the end going for a few minutes to get it thick. This recipe was great!

I loved this dish and am so pleased with the way it turned out. So many Salisbury steak recipes call for ketchup and this one does not which is why I decided to try it. I'm glad I did and have added it to my dinner rotation.

I liked the fact that the recipe didn't call for cream or powdered soups. However it was a bit bland even though I used seasoned bread crumbs. And added Worcester and garlic to the gravy.  Will use more seasoning, maybe Montreal seasoning, next time. Update: Montreal seasoning worked well with garlic and spices to the meat! I salute the onions then cook my patties. Sometimes I make the patties and freeze for an easier weekday meal.

This turned great except when it came to adding the corn starch. I'm not what was the issues as I've used corn starch in the past to thicken sauces. It kept cooking instantly into clumps. 

Anyway I used ground turkey and prepared everything the night before so it was easy and quick. Will definitely make again soon.

I had 1 1/4 pound of meat so used it all. Made 5 patties and then used 3 cups broth to 4.5 T cornstarch w 4.5 T water. Easy and something differently. Good!

Delicious! This was my first time making salsbury steaks and my husband and daughter are both extremely picky eaters. Both of them gobbled this up immediately! Only thing I changed was lowering the amount of onions since my husband isn't a huge onion fan. 

Overall, I highly recommend this recipe! Much better than school cafeteria salsbury steak :p

I made this last night and it was delicious! I didn't use onions at all but it still had a lot of flavor. When I put the corn starch mixture in, it seemed to congeal in some places, though. I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but it still tasted great. I will definitely make this again!

This tasted fairly good.  Only thing is....wasn't enough gravy for us.  I even made a little extra.  The steaks were a bit dry so we had to pour extra on top.  I think I'll make it again but I'll double on the gravy.

I added Montreal Steak Spice to the meat mixture, thankfully, as they would have been flavourless without.  Easy recipe that is basic, fast, and good.  I will make it again, but I will add more seasonings to the sauce as well from now on.

This is a family favorite!! The wife was amazed the first time I made this, following the recipe exactly less the mushrooms. Even the SUPER picky 12 year old loved it. Served it with egg noodles and mashed potatoes, been in the monthly rotation for a couple years now.

Love this recipe. I will say that the onion is a bit over what was needed. Next time I will use a small onion for the slices rather then a large onion. Other then that even my picky eaters loved it. I served it with green bean and mushroom medley (from allrecipes) and mashed potatoes. I used the gravy over the mashed potatoes and it was a wonderful compliment to them.

I've never made this before, having only tried the frozen version as a child. I did alter it a little, because I have a hard time following instructions :) I browned the patties, then put them in a foil lined baking dish. When they were all finished I put the broth (2c water and 2 bullion cubes) along with onions and mushrooms in the skillet, simmered it for about ten minutes, then added 2 tbsp cornstarch/water mix. After it thickened a little I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes since my skillets aren't large enough to do it as the recipe says. It came out lovely! My hubby actually said it was delicious (rather his joking "it's terrible") Thank you so much for this. Which I can use as a solid base. Will definitely make it again.

I added extra water because 3 TB of corn starch really thickened this sauce.  I also added 2 TB worcestershire sauce.  Excellent recipe and one for the recipe box for sure.

The only change I made was to saute the onions & mushrooms before adding them to the broth, but I should have tweaked a bit more.  Even with the onions caramelized a little bit to help flavor the broth, I still thought it was plain.  I can't imagine if the veggies had just been boiled in the broth.  Next time I will season the gravy with a little black pepper, and probably a few other things (garlic, Worcestershire, herbs...haven't decided yet).  This recipe is beautiful in the fact that it isn't based on things like onion soup mix or cream of condensed soups, and without too much tweaking I'm sure I'll have a "keeper" recipe.

Made this with mashed potatoes and peas and it's awesome. The only things I did different was to use Italian bread crumbs and added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the ground meat. Going to try adding venison this fall.

Will definitely make again.  The meat was incredibly tender and tasty, although I did add garlic to meat mixture.  I also sauteed peppers and onions, then added the broth and patties to finish up.  Will make the gravy a bit creamier the next time.

I've made this twice with excellent results and comments. I like the addition of garlic and a splash of Worcestershire, but even the original is wonderfully flavorful. The meat is tender, tasty,  and not dry.  It is in my regular rotation now.

I don't know where that picture came from with the original recipe, but the gravy does NOT turn out like that.  It's almost clear, and has ZERO flavor.  And that was AFTER I added soy sauce and worcestire.  Guess I won't be making this one again.  :(

I made this tonight and it was very good. I typically don't modify on the first try but my SO hates onions.  So I used just 1 Tbs dried minced onion in the meat mixture and doubled the mushrooms.  He and I both liked it, the toddler doesn't get a vote.

This is my favorite Salisbury steak recipe.  I've made it a few times. Today I made it with ground turkey. I used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs. I fry as little as possible, I was making Macaroni and cheese, since the oven was on I mixed this all up and baked it 350 for 30 minutes. Delicious!

Cooked exactly per recipe.  It was fine.  However, my family felt it tasted like salisbury steak from the frozen section.  It left much to be desired for me.

Delicious!  I added an envelope of onion soup mix to the beef, and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans for a good ol' homemade comfort meal.  This will be a regular!!  Thanks!

I had saved this recipe to my box a few months ago but thought it would be a lot of work. Nope! Very easy, very tasty, and the gravy is fantastic!  The only change I made was to sauté the onions and mushrooms before adding the broth and simmering. Excellent recipe!

This recipe was very good, I bumped up the seasonings on the meat and added red wine to deglaze the braiser and the dish turned out super tasty! Planning on making this again.

Very good, just the way it should be. It was prepared as written with the exception of removing the patties, sauteing the mushroom and onion in the pan and then continuing with the making of the gravy and adding the patties back in to simmer. The rest as written. The recipe as written seems a little lacking but I always prepare as written first. There are no changes necessary, however, some that use less salt in their diet may find it a little salty. It was fine for me but I usually salt my food on the plate and I didn't have to with this recipe. It also barely makes enough gravy (if you have a gravy hog in the house) once thickened so I will probably increase the liquid a bit next time. I always serve this on egg noodles.

I made this for my parents since we had some mushrooms that needed to be used. Whereas the beef patty was good, the sauce was lacking in flavor. I was really hoping to like this dish, but it came up a little short. Won't be making again.

I used Angus ground round and the gravy was super yummy!! This recipe is a good week night meal. When preparing for people that see onions and mushrooms and emedintly not like it I suggest using an emulsifier for the gravy.

I used minced onions rather than chopping up a partial one. Midway through making this I realized I didn't have beef broth so I found a can of condensed French Onion Soup in the pantry. It worked perfectly.

I love this quick recipe! I make it with 90/10 ground chuck. I used the recipe as is, except that I added some garlic powder and I had no mushrooms. We both loved it.  I freeze these loafs individually for lunches or when I need a quick dinner. I make a note on the vacuum bag to make the Mushroom gravy to go with it.

I made this but used stock instead of broth and a little garlic powder in the meat mixture. This was   great and easy to prepare, my family loved it. I am so tired of trying to find simple things for dinner and love it when I come across a good recipe like this one.

I made this the other night when I had company for dinner.  It was really delicious and had a very similar taste to the salisbury steak I remember from growing up.  I served it with mac and cheese and a salad and I received rave reviews!

My son who is pretty picky when trying new foods took one bite and loved it!  I made the recipe as written, but with two changes, I used McCormick's steak seasoning instead of salt and pepper and I added 1 clove of garlic to the meat mixture.  It was delish!  Thank you for posting.

I made this and was so disappointed given the high overall rating for this recipe. Only my husband liked it. It needed lots of additional seasoning. The gravy -- thickened with corn starch -- is jelly like.   It took much longer to  make than the recipe states. To cook through the beef patties.   And decided the mushrooms and onion would taste better if sautéed first.   If you try the recipe -- I would only use extra lean ground beef. I used lean ground beef and found that the  fat melted into the sauce  giving the dish a greasy taste and mouthfeel. 

I would be careful in making this recipe from a food safety standpoint. When  broth is added, some of the meat is still raw (my patties browned but had cracks exposing raw meat).  So the liquid for the gravy is now contaminated with bacteria from the raw meat.  I let it boil for awhile to make sure bacteria in broth was killed. . And also used a meat  thermometer  to measure the internal temperature of the meat to ensure it was  safe to eat.   Simmering less than fully cooked ground meat patties on a broth on a low temperature as suggested is risky business!

VERY GOOD as written other than we like having our mushrooms and onions softer...so once we took patties out to keep warm, cooked them about 10 additional minutes than recipe specified (covered lid)  before adding cornstarch and water.  Again, great recipe!  Thanks for posting!

I made this last night and my husband, a picky eater, LOVED it.  The only thing I did differently was that I added a spash of Cabernet Sauvignon.  Perfection.

WOW! this is amazing! I don't know if I've ever given a recipe 5 stars but this deserves TEN stars! I grew up with frozen salisberry steak and was excited to try this recipe. I only made a few changes which only enhanced the flavor. 1. I hate the taste of raw onions, so I sautéed the onions that went into beef mixture. 2. my breadcrumbs were pre-seasoned. 3. I added garlic powder to mixture 4. I added a few drops of worch sauce. no major changes but seriously this was a great meal!! thanks for the recipe!!

Great family dinner!  I grated the onion in the meat mixture and I made the roux as another suggested.  This was perfect with mashed potatoes.

Awesome! Will make this again. I used the ingredients as listed. Tastes great as is. Before I added the beef broth, I took out the patties and fry the onions and mushrooms a little. Then put everything back in and simmered. I will never buy them Encore meals again. Thanks!!!

This was an awesome and definitely a keeper.  I did not change anything as I love to try recipes just like they are so that the creator gets an honest opinion and rating.  I do not plan to change anything in the future, I love this recipe just he way it is. Thank you for sharing Eskarina :)

Great recipe! I used frozen hamburger patties since I didn't want to split my 1lb of ground beef into 5ths for my family of 5, but otherwise followed the recipe. The family all said they wanted it again, which is the best way to tell if they liked it.

Tried this last night.  Wish I added some seasonings like Worcester sauce or even red wine.  Meat was tender but with little flavor. Gravy was not too bad tho. Will try again but will spice it up a bit.

I used ground turkey. This recipe was easy to follow and tasty. I added extra onions to my gravy and added some can milk to make it creamier. Served with some creamy homemade mashed potatoes.  Delicious!!

I made this for lunch it is definately a keeper...I, too, used the whole 8 oz box of mushrooms as I had nothing else to use them in and didn't want them to go to waste...After I browned the patties,I added the mushrooms and onions and 2 cups of boullion  and let them cook until the patties were done. Then, I took them out and let the mushrooms and onions simmer until tender...Then, I added 6 tbls of brown gravy mix....Came out perfect...Put the patties back in to heat them through....Served them with mashed potatoes and lima beans...I have a couple salisbury steak recipes, but this is less labor intensive and more flavorful than the others...BTW I added an extra 1/3 cup of bread crumbs as I didn't think the mixture would hold together when cooking..

I thought that the patties staying together was going to be a problem and ,unfortunately I was right.  I could deal with this minor problem, but I found that these were just REALLY bland, next to no flavor.  Followed the recipe exactly as written.

Made this the other night never having made salisbury steak before but decided to tweak it a bit for the likes of my family. I added chopped bell peppers to the meat mixture as well as just a little more seasoning. I also decidded to bake the steaks while making the gravy on the stovetop and used a meatloaf meat mix(pork,veal,beef) for added flavor and tenderness. Was a huge hit and will be making again. I apologize i forgot to take a pic.

I like my mushrooms and onions caramelized, so I browned the mushrooms in a little butter first and removed them from the pan. Then I browned the onion and removed it. Then I added the patties. I found 3 tablespoons of cornstarch was too much, and made the gravy too thick, so I will cut that back to one next time. It was a little too salty (probably from the beef broth) so I'll cut back the amount of salt I add to the beef, next time. I added a teaspoon of soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce (which added even more salt), and a couple of tablespoons of red wine to the gravy, to boost flavor. It was very good, in spite of the saltiness.

Made this tonight...my husband absolutely loved it.  I would have given it a 5 stars but I did tweak just a hair by adding a splash of worcestershire sauce.  I don't know that it really needed it...It was GREAT!!!!

We enjoyed this dinner - the gravy/sauce was especially tasty, with a little Worcestershire sauce added. We liked it best the first time I served it - it took longer than I expected for us to finish the leftovers. Served with Smashed Potatoes from this site.

OMG!!!! That's by far the best Salisbury steak recipe I've tried! It was so easy & came out heavenly-and I'm a vegetarian! The gravy was amazing & my boys are demanding I make this at least once a week!

The recipe was good with one exception. The gravy barely changed  with the prescribed amount of corn starch; so, I added a mixture of flour and corn starch with broth from the pan. A couple of dashes of pepper. I used sweet onion. Next time, I plan to use the broth for the thickening mixture instead of water and decrease the salt. Canned beef broth seems a little too salty.

I made this yesterday and it was awesome! The only difference was that instead of fresh onions in the meat, I used dried minced onions and added a bit of onion powder to the meat, also, omitted the mushrooms because he doesn't like them. I used fresh sliced onions as called for in the gravy, the gravy was perfect! This recipe is a keeper!
