This is wonderful! The liquid smoke is the secret. I added a little sour cream also. I made it into a ball and rolled in nuts for texture. This cleaned up right away, will make a double batch next time.

I followed the recipe to the letter. I found it to be delicious and a lot cheaper than buying smoked salmon dip in the fish market or the store.   I also like the fact that if you want you can jazz this up with more herbs and spices if you choose to do so. This is a definite winner for an appetizer while watching my Pistons, Lions, Red Wings, and Tigers. Oh and we cannot forget about THEE Michigan Wolverines!!!!!

I used canned salmon removing the bones and skin as well as low fat cream cheese. I added more liquid smoke because it like it smoky and spreadable.

This was very good.  Next time I will add more horseradish and some garlic.

Easy, cheap and good. I have made this several times for parties and it is always loved by all. The ingredients are ones many already have in their home so it is cheap and quick to pull together. Must let it rest for a few hours for the ball to set. I roll it in cracker crumbs, paprika, and parsley...and at holiday time I roll it in dried cranberries. This is a keeper

This was good, but I do think 'something' is missing. May try this again and play around w/ it a bit when I have more time. Thanks for sharing. :)
