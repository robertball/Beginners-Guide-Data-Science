I used Diet Coke and added a small splash of fat free half-n-half. Good but very sweet. When I made a second one, I doubled the amount of Diet Coke. The half-n-half helped cut the sweetness.

Whoa Nelly! This is sweeetttt. I tried it half coffee liqueur (homemade from this site) and half coke, and then I made another one with the same amount of liqueur and twice as much cola. I liked it much better with twice as much cola. Not something I would serve company but a good way to use up the liqueur!

This was pretty good. It grows on you the more you drink it. Next time I'll try it with a little more cola though.

Never thought of it til I saw this, I tried it and well, turned out fantastic!  Maybe next time I'll use Mexican Coca Cola since its less sweet.
