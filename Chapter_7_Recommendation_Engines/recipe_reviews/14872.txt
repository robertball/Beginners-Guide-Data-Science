Delicious as written, I'm sure, but made 3 changes based on ingredients on hand:
Used half cheddar, half pepper jack.
Subbed mild green chilis for jalapenos.
Left out hot pepper sauce.

This was the first appetizer finished, and there were many recipe requests.  Many thanks, Ingrid!

Great recipe!  I increased the cheese by one cup, used diced chilies instead of jalapenos and melted it all togehter in the microwave. Everyone loves this appetizer!

I had a layer of grease on top of minethat did not melt. While the flavors were good, the consistency was not.
