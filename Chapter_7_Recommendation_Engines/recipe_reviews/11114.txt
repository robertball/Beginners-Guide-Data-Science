dough is the same ratio as the rugalach II, the filling uses almonds and lemon zest instead.  the baking temp is better here, it will not burn the jam if overfilled.  also i roll this in a rectangle rather than a circle, spread the filling then cut the "triangles" using a pastry cutter in a "zig zag" fashion across the short side of the rectangle.  also i fine grind my almonds, toast then measure, then mix using an electric blending wand.  it makes for a more homogenous filling.  finally, bake on parchment paper, nothing sticks to that, and the product bakes to a more uniform color.

Delicious recipe and not too hard to make even though there are several steps.
One thing that the recipe did not make clear is which nuts to use inside and which to use outside.  I used the toasted ones inside since the baking would toast the untoasted ones on the outside.  Also, 1/2 cup of jam is plenty for the filling.  20 minutes was the perfect baking time in my oven.

Great taste, but VERY time-intensive.  I used a food processor to cut the butter and cream cheese into the flour to speed up the preparation time.

perfect cookie for guests. Followed directions exactly (which is something I mistakenly don't do!!) and was extremely pleased with  the result. Makes me want to keep on baking. Success breeds success!

These are a lot of fun to make, and they taste great! My sister and family has been begging me ever since I made them for Christmas to make them again. I make one batch, and it's always gone in three or four hours.

My daughter recommended this recipe highly.  I too, give it a 5* rating.  Many other traditional Rugalach fillings can be used as well.  What a treat!

These are my secret weapon over the holidays.  The dough freezes well, and once you get the hang of rolling out the dough, you can actually make them fairly quickly.  Hint: try mini chocolate chips and rasberry preserves.  delish.

These wonderful cookies are the closest thing to my Austrian grandmother's (Oma) recipe. In addition to the apricot, she would also use a prune and an all nut filling. I hear Christmas bells when I think of little treats! Thanks Bonnie!

A lot of the filling ran out of the cookie when baked. I sprinkled with confectioners sugar to try to make them look a little better. They did taste wonderful though. I found them to be very delicate and had to leave them on the parchment paper for a while as not to break from moving. I baked for about 13 min. They tasted better several hours later than right out of the oven. Thanks Bonnie

I love this recipe but do not like Apricot or the lemon in them, SO I use the basic pastry recipe, substituted Rasberry Jam- you can use seedless or seeded.   I find the seeded Jams Ooze less our of the cookie. I omit the almonds in one of my batches since my kids don't like the nuts. (it makes them easier to roll)
After I roll the cookie I roll the it prior to baking in Demerara Washed Raw Cane Sugar which gives the cookie that sweetness with a little crunch.  Everyone seems to rave over that little extra step.   As with one other reviewer here... I ALWAYS bake on parchment with these cookies or if you can use a silpat mat if you have- the cookies lift right off of the paper.

I loved this cookie.  Doubling the recipe was a must, and next time I would add a little sugar to the pastry to insure a little sweeter flavor.

These are really tasty, although they're a bit of work. I don't think as much filling is needed, since a lot of it squeezed out when I was rolling the cookies, and more of it oozed out and burned on the parchment while baking. The almonds should be very finely chopped, as these are little cookies! I also cut the rounds with a pizza cutters as suggested in another review, and it worked very well. I'll try this again! Thanks!

This is absolutely delicious.  It's best to bake them on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet because the filling does ooze out during baking.   This will save you a lot of clean up time.   I omit the lemon rind because I find it distracting. If you use a food processor to make the dough it is lightning fast.  Make extra and keep it in the freezer.

the dough, which i believe is an integral part of a ruggulach recipem was not very good. because it did not call for any sugar or spices, it was somewhat tart and did not have a very good flavour, nor was it melt-in-your-mouth. i suppose the type of apricot jam you use also plays amajor role in the success of this recipe. i used E.D. Smith and was not impressed. also, the length of time to which the dough needed to be refrigerated was not specified. perhaps that also affects the quality of the pastry, but we'll never know.

I made 2 batches of these about a week and a half ago and froze them.  I baked them today and you were right.  They were very good.  Plan to do again.  Thanks! :-)))))

I've just taken these out of the oven and wanted to rate them before I forgot. This is the first time I've made Rugelach, and I've never tasted one, so all of this is based on having no idea what they should actually be like. The recipe was simple to make, and the end result is tasty. The dough has a nice tangy flavor to it, and the filling is sweet and tart. I didn't read the directions well enough, so I ended up mixing the jelly with the nuts and sugar, this meant I had to get them off the pan quick, or they'd get welded there. I'm not sure if it'll be different if I do the jam separate, as called for. I'll try to remember to update when I make them for a family gathering in a few days time. The dough was easier to work with on a floured counter than on a mat made to keep dough from sticking. Once it starts to get warm under your fingers it doesn't want to hold its shape, so work fast. All in all, I'm very happy with it, and I feel like you could fill it with a billion different things. My kids love crescent rolls for breakfast, so it's cool to know that I can make this dough up in a snap!

Didn't have success with these.  The dough was really hard to deal with.  Had to flour the counter and freeze it.  When baking, the apricot preserve came out.    I had plenty of preserve  and almond left so I don't think I used too much.  Tastes pretty good except dough tastes a little raw.  This isn't a recipe for beginners like myself.  I'll certainly use barely any filling next. time.  I took a pic of my disaster.
