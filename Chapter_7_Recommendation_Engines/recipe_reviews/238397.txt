A nice fresh side dish with 4 mins in the microwave, that works for me!  I used some sweet organic carrots which got a little punch of tartness from the cranberries and little spice from the cinnamon.  The carrots were so sweet that I'll probably cut back on the brown sugar next time.  Followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of substituting vegetable broth (open box in the fridge) for the chicken.  Mine were cooked perfectly in just 4 minutes, so watch your time because you certainly don't want them to turn to mush.  Thanks myvallie for a great new carrot side dish!

Great idea! I opted to steam carrots on stovetop instead of microwaving and used fresh cranberries instead of dried. This is a keeper and going on our Thanksgiving menu next year. Thanks!

This was very good, easy and kid friendly.  I baked it in the oven, since I was using it for the main dish anyway. Delicious!

I made it at Thanksgiving and Christmas. Everyone loved it. After Thanksgiving I took what was left over (enough for one serving) added some chicken broth and cooked the carrots to soft. Then I blended it and ate it as soup. It was delicious.

We had a last minute, big group for Christmas.  I opted for simple and fast.  I parcooked a double batch of already peeled small whole carrots, in the microwave  I then added a double batch of the other ingredients and finished microwaving.. The result was a beautiful, sweet side dish the everyone thought was wonderful.  Thank You for sharing.  This will stay in our favorites of quick, simple but fancy side dishes.

Followed the recipe exactly, and cooked the entire thing in the microwave. The end result is as pretty as the photo and tastes great. So easy. Will make this again and again.

Delicious, a nice change. The cranberries go well with the carrots. I recommend decreasing the amount of sugar. I needed to cook it longer than given directions.

I halved the recipe and it was perfect for 3-4 people. Boiled the carrots in the broth then drained some into the mixture with cranberries. Added this back into the pot with the carrots and viola!

Excellent!  Replaced chicken (don't eat animals) broth with plain water & it was still excellent!  Great way to get immune-boosting carrots & cranberries (to fight a cold &/or flu).

This was a hit at our Thanksgiving meal and even those who donâ€™t ordinarily like cooked carrots loved it.  This will be a regular at our holiday meals.  Thanks for the recipe!

the carrots remained hard after microwaving for 15 minutes, perhaps a fault of the carrots? Baked  the whole thing in the oven for 1/2 hour after that, and the sauce was like water and did not soak into the carrots and berries at all. 

Will try again with stovetop cooked carrots, make the sauce separately and thicken and then pour over the top and bake.
