Very good and you can get creative with it. I used M&M's and peanut butter in place of the butterscotch. I added about 1/2 cup more of potato chips. I spread the mix out on parchment paper and put in the freezer to firm. Then broke it up into chunks.

My aunt found this recipe years ago and it's ALWAYS a hit when you take to parties. Salt, grease and chocolate all rolled into one! I half the recipe as it makes a lot. I like to have guests guess what the ingredients are...makes for interesting conversation as they can never figure out what the "crunchies" are. I put them in mini-cupcake cups. It's tedious, but it's easy for guests to handle. I'll have to try dropping them on waxed paper.

I've tried making chocolate covered potato chips before and they just didn't turn out...but these were FABULOUS!!! I think the butterscotch is the secret ingredient! So easy to remember the recipe, too :-)

We really enjoyed these, made quite a huge amount but each cookie is a small chocolate bar and they vanish just as fast!

These are to die for!!! I used 1 cup of almonds instead of the peanuts and man, are they addictive!! I kept them in a ziploc bag in the freezer and ate them right out of the bag, usually still frozen. Thank you so much for this easy recipe.

These were disappointing to me.  The flavor is excellent, but I won’t be making them again.  At room temperature, these are really messy to eat and chocolate melts all over your fingers – not exactly something I’d want to serve at a party where they’d be sitting out.  If you store them in the refrigerator and eat them straight from the fridge, they’re fine.  If you do make these, here's a little tip: 2 1/2 oz. of chips = 1 cup crushed.  A little digital scale really helps.

My co-workers request this from me regularly.  The potato chips and peanuts are a great together and offer a nice blend of salt to the sweet of the coating.  A sweet treat anytime.

These were pretty good, recipe was really easy. I followed the recipe exactly, but would like to try it with some changes (different-flavored chips or different add-ins.) Mine didn't set up until I put them in the refrigerator and at room temperature were pretty gooey and melty.

yummy, I had these at a new years party a few years ago and finally found the recipe. I used alldress chips and didn't add the peanuts. I'm sure any chip flavour can be used as long as there rippled

Been making these for 40+ years, love them. Have developed a peanut allergy, but also awesome with almonds, walnuts or pecan, we always used Corn Flakes instead of potato chips.  One of our favorite Christmas versions is with one cup of dried cherries and 1 cup of chopped pecans instead of 2 cups of nuts. Really anything goes is you keep the ratios the same.

Very yummy! Used Reece's peanut butter chocolate chips instead of butterscotch. Turned out very well, so melt in your mouth!

-I don't reccomend using flavored potato chips

-These are how I "snagged" my guy. He got some from his landlord, and told me if I could make them he'd marry me. I promptly logged on and searched. 
Now I make them every year on our anniversary.

Plan to make this using 1/2 cup more of potato chips. Spread the mix out on parchment paper and put in the freezer to firm. Then break up into chunks.

Tasted like a sugar-fest in the mouth and not in a good way... Hubby couldn't eat them either.  There was a reason I liked these when I was nine.  Yet, I'll still try to recapture the glory of childhood and try to mature them a bit.  Next time I'm going to add 1 1/2 c. marshmellows for texture.  I'll use less butterscotch (by half maybe?) and make up for it by using bittersweet chips.   They were just too sweet.  Great crunch & the marshmellows add new texture.

The entire batch will go in a few minutes!  My daughter won 1st prize for these cookies in an all-county no-bake cookie contest.
