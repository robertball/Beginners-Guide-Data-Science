I really missed the smokey flavor that I'm use to in Baba Ghanoush. I thought it was on the bland side. Here are two ways I found that can add additional flavor. The first way is to just grill or saute slices or the eggplant before blending. Make sure you cook it until it is a dark brown. The other way (best) is to bake the whole eggplant with skin and all until the outside is chard. Then remove the skin and blend. The fist gives a light smokey flavor and the second method gives a full smokey flavor that just adds so much to the recipe.

Perfect traditional recipe!  This tastes just like the baba ghanoush at my favorite lebanese restaurant, where the owners are FROM Lebanon, where Baba Ghanoush comes from.  :)  Only thing I'd add is maybe some chopped parsley and pine nuts to garnish!

Increased the Tahini to 3 tbls, reduced the olive oil to 1/6 cup, and used 1 tsp garlic. Pureed in a blender, it was creamy with a hint of garlic. Awesome.

I made this exactly as stated. The garlic was overwhelming. I think next time I would try only 1/2 of what is called for. I could not get around the garlic taste (and I love garlic) so sadly I  had to toss it. I gave it a 3 star beccause I think if adjusted right it may be good. I am a big fan of hummus and white bean dip and the concept here is the same.

So easy and very good. But, like a previous reviewer, the garlic was overwhelming. And I love garlic! I will make this again but cook the garlic slightly in the olive oil.

I made this recipe this afternonn with our fresh eggplant!  It is delicious, I did after skimming over the reviews add a few drops of liquid smoke to the eggplant when I microwaved it and let it cool.  It added a nice subtle flavor.  Thanks for sharing it's my first attempt to make this!

This was a tad too tangy or maybe bitter for our liking.  I would make it again next time I had an eggplant to use up, either scraping out the eggplant seeds and/or using less lemon juice.

Made exactly as stated and the garlic was much too much.  I was disappointed.  I kept adding more salt to cut the garlic flavor.  No one in my family would eat it.

Yum.  Didn't have tahini so I used tsp peanut butter and about two Tablespoons of sesame oil.  Probably would be better with tahini but yummy just the same.

These are all good recipes. I don't like the "smoky" taste, so I never roast/char the eggplant first. I cut the raw eggplant  in big thick slices, peel off the skin, and microwave the eggplant (in covered casserole, bit of water) until soft. Let cool completely, drain, and proceed with recipe, in blender.

If you a problem with too much garlic or lemon use homemade tahini paste (toast seeds in a 400 degree oven for 5 minutes.  Place in VitaMix or food processor with 1/4 c sesame oil, salt to taste, process till smooth).  Add more of this tahini to level out flavors.  However, I love Mediterranean food for the garlic-lemon flavors so I found this to be awesome.  I have been attempting to incorporate more Mediterranean foods in our diet and I love what it does for us!

Great recipe for me because I dislike having to roast or burn the eggplant on a flame.

Loved this recipe!  A lot of readers say the garlic is too much, but if you're a garlic lover like me, it was perfect!  A great way to use up my eggplants from the garden!

NOM.  I don't bother peeling the eggplant, though.

This was my first try at Baba Ghanoush and I think it is fantastic!  I added a bit more garlic.
