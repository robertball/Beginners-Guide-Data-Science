Well, this certainly was different for me. I have never made a sweet salsa but I found I liked this one with certain things. This one we served with dipping crackers and chips plus I served it with some BBQ'ed pork chops and chicken and everyone really liked it. When I plated the pork chops, I just made a trail of salsa across the chops and on to the plate and it made a very attractive presentation. I did the same way with the chicken and I also had some salsa in a dish for those who wanted more or some with dippers. Like usual, I made two batches. One exactly as written and the second one I changed slightly to accomadate personal tastes. I added less hot pepper, half the vinegar, and less mint. I can't do hot peppers so I didn't try the hot one but the ones who did said it was great. They would have never thought of mixing hot peppers with strawberries but they said it sure works. As for the toned down version, I though it was very good. It reminded me of summer and back yard BBQ's and picnics. Yes, I will prepare the Strawberry Salsa again. My family has ordered it.

A friend served this with Blue Corn Chips and it was wonderful.  She said she left out the mint all together and used only about half of the peppers.  It was really yummy.   Went very well with the wine that she served ... a very pleasant way to enjoy a summer eve.

Right after making this, my son wanted to add honey.  After sitting overnight, the flavors melded so that a sweetener was not needed. Colorful and palette pleasing!  We will be making this again!

This was an interesting experience. I've never had strawberry salsa so I was not sure what to expect. Or what to do with it really. So I served it with cinnamon pita chips and crackers. There is a lot going on here flavor wise. I liked it with the cinnamon chips the best. The cilantro and mint seemed to be battling each other for first place in the flavor. I really liked the strawberries and the vinegar. I think if I make it again I will probably cut the cilantro down to 1 T. My kids all really enjoyed it as a snack. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a light, mild, refreshing salsa.  If you are looking for a sweet fruit salsa, this is probably not the recipe you want.  The strawberries really soak up the balsamic and take on a more savory taste, still a tad sweet, but not like a mango or pineapple salsa.  I prepared as written with the exception of using fine diced red onion for the green.  I drizzled a little EVOO on to keep it together and refrigerated overnight.  What a pretty presentation.  I enjoyed trying this recipe, thanks Miss Betty!

Sorry, but this recipe wasn't a hit in my household.  Everyone liked the strawberry, tomato, green onion combo, but it ended there.  Would try again but wouldn't use the cilantro or mint.  I found a recipe that was fairly similar, using balsamic vinegar, liquid honey, pepper, and basil.  Will try this again using these ingredients, because I think it would be quite nice with a grilled chicken breast.

I loved this salsa, so fun, different, refreshing!  My husband thought it was weird...strawberries??  He is such a traditionalist, ha-ha...  So, hooray, more for me.  I followed the directions exactly except for the mint, which I left out because I simply don't like it.  Oh, and I used canned jalapenos because I don't like handling raw hot peppers... haven't learned how without crying, ha-ha...  Because mine were canned, I doubled the amount, otherwise I could barely taste them.  This was all even better the next day.  Thanks you Betty for such a fantastic recipe and idea!

This turned out really good, although it was a little bland for my taste. It wasn't sweet at all - I was expecting it to taste a lot sweeter and a lot like the creamy fruit dips. My friends loved it though - and they couldn't get enough!I will definitely make it again, but I might play with it next time, to see if I can add some more flavor to it!

Wow!  This was really good.  I did use a bit less of the jalapeno peppers (personal taste) but it was still really great.  Good to make for a crowd to use as an appetizer.  Thanks for sharing!

This was incredible!  Would also be good with potato pancakes, maybe crackers with cream cheese.  Probably a lot more other uses - but also great with just plain tortilla chips.  It was a huge hit with everyone who tried it.  What a wonderfully surprising use for strawberries - especially if you get a batch that don't seem to have "perfect" strawberry flavor yet early in the season.  I didn't have mint, so omitted it; and I used jarred jalapeno slices.  Also used Passion Fruit Balsamic from Gourmet Country.  Excellent!

This isn't one of my favourites, there was to many flavours happening. I found the cilantro to be overwhelming. We had this on cinnamon pita chips,however I think it would be better on chicken.

I made this today at my job and sampled it out to the customers who all loved it. It's something that caught people off guard because of the mint and cilantro combo. I will be adding this one to my recipe box.

Think the mint should be omitted
