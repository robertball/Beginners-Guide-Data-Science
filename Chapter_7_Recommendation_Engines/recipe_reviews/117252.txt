This was an instant hit in our home.  It's tough to get my 16-year-old to take a moment for breakfast, but he stops in his tracks as soon as he sees this loaf on the table.  I could probably do this with frozen dough, but I enjoy the breadmaking.  The only thing I change is to add more meat, about 1.5 pounds sausage total, and place slices of provolone on the dough before topping with the meat/cheese mixture.  Mmmmmm!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used frozen bread dough because I don't have a bread maker. It worked well! Let it rise, roll, let rise, fill with mixture, let rise and then bake! It was delicious! My family asks for it time and time again. I use Cider House Sausage and Swiss Cheese for my own twist on this and there's never any leftovers.

I love this recipe. I have taken it to the office and given it as Christmas gifts. It is very easy to make and never lasts long. Teenagers can eat a whole loaf by themselves.

My mom used to make a version of this.  She added chopped spinach (frozen, then thawed and drained). It really adds flavor and a vegetable! She used the frozen Rhodes dough too.  Whole wheat is great!

This was pretty easy and came out well. A flexible recipe - I made it vegetarian simply by using vegetarian sausage. I also used smoked gouda rather than prov. because that is what I had around. Left out garlic powder too. Thanks for the recipe!

Tried this for the first time. The dough turned out perfect - although I used weight instead of measuring cups for the flour. I've made meat breads before, but not with sausage. The only changes I made were to add about 2 tsp each of basil and oregano to the cheese mixture, and to use 1 1/2 cups of an Italian 5 cheese blend. Served it with marinara sauce and salad. Dinner was well loved by all! Might try using Italian sausage next time, but with the addition of the herbs, the flavor was all there! It's a keeper!

This turned out really well.  I used cheddar (which is what I had on hand), and cooked minced garlic and onion with the sausage instead of adding garlic powder.  It reheated well the next day, too.

I loved this!!!  I made a few changes.  One was accidental...i misread the teaspoons on the butter and addded 4 tablespoons instead.  i loved how the bread tasted.  i'm glad i made that mistake =)I added half a green pepper (chopped) and 5 green onions (chopped).  I used monteray jack and swiss cheese.  I sauted the onions and peppers with the sausage.  When I rolled the dough out, i put the sausage on first, then the cheese (i mixed the garlic and peper with the cheese).  I loved it!!  definately will be making this again.  you can add a lot of things to your taste, mushrooms, different peppers, different seasonings, cheeses, you could even add seasonings and flavors to the bread too.  i can't wait to experiment with it!

Reminded me of a Hot Pocket, but a good one.  I added a green pepper, 1/2 an onion, and minced garlic.  Also used smoked gouda...Yummy.  We had mozzarella, but I wanted to use the cheese I already had opened.  The gouda was really really good in there.  Also I braided the bread instead of rolling the dough to make it prettier.  I think it would be even better with some diced tomatoes too, but I add tomatoes to everything.  Didn't use all the filling because of the added veggies, but am saving for omelets.  Thanks for the recipe!

First, I must confess I cheated by using store bought refrigerated bread but it was really good.  One thing I loved is how filling it was, we still have half left.  I used spicy sausage, just our preference and I also added mushrooms when I cooked the sausage.

Kids LOVED it! Friends raved. Added sautee'd mushroom, onion, and garlic. Didn't have provolone; used cheddar instead. Of course, added extra because we are a "cheesy" family.
