I found this recipe fun and relatively easy other than it being time consuming.  I did choose to make the pizza dough as opposed to buying the premade dough.  Also, I added onions, olives, more garlic and cheese to taste and served with an Alfredo sauce as well as a marinara.  The whole family loved it and thought it was from a local pizza place!

Despite some of the negative reviews, I liked this recipe. I baked the bottom crust for just a couple minutes because I was afraid it would be soggy. Then I put a thin layer of tomato sauce before adding the potato/broccoli mixture. I also added butter to the potato/broccoli mixture and used Italian Seasoning instead of all the individual spices. I used a fork to seal the edges since the bottom crust was already slightly cooked, so had to press down harder. It cooked up nicely and my family liked it.

This pizza makes a fantastic stomach-filler, though a little on the bland side.  Maybe a little bit of extra garlic or salt and pepper.

Recipe is time consuming.  Flavor is flat.  Pizza dough on bottom doesn't cook well.

This was pretty good, but I think maybe the title is a little misleading.  It's not cheesy like pizza, which I was expecting.  I also added a little pesto and sun dried tomatoes to the recipe, and used more cheese, but I wish I had used more.  My boyfriend loved it though!

Not too bad with more cheese and garlic than the recipe calls for. I used store-bought pre-baked pizza crusts, added the filling and baked for several minutes.

Despite the negative reviews and the low star rating, I gave this recipe a try.  I’m pleased to say my family REALLY enjoyed it.  My husband does not enjoy ‘meatless’ meals and he commented twice that this was a good dinner.  To me, I heard “Oh, yea, you can make this one again!”  I didn’t have quite a pound of broccoli, so I roughly chopped an onion and added it to the last 5 minutes of the boiling potatoes.  That worked perfectly.  I used two Pillsbury® Pizza Crusts and spread it out to the edges on a large pizza (16”) pan.  I debated pre-baking the bottom crust, but chose not to and the bottom crust baked up just fine.  I did not have Monterey Jack cheese, but did have Pepperjack Cheese, so I used 2 cups of it in this recipe.  This made a very big pizza – and I cut 8 very large pieces.  This was served with ‘Marilyn’s Special Salad’ from AR, and we had a very enjoyable dinner.

Very bland and disappointing. The potatoes made the pie too heavy and didn't mesh well with the broccoli. I think mushroom and onion would make better ingredients than the potatoes for sure.

Thought this was very bland, it needed something. The crust I had came out very hard on top and the bottom was raw.
