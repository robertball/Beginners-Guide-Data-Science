I cooked it the 4 hours on low and it was no where near done. Turned it on high to speed it up and the edges inside burned. The cake never set, it was kind of fudgy. Couldn't taste the cherries and it was just mild in chocolate in flavor. Definitely won't make again.

The directions do not indicate where the pudding mix fits in.  I would guess that it is blended with the cake mix, eggs, water and sour cream?
Haven't made it yet, but it sounds delicious and easy!!
