I've been using this pie crust recipe for decades.  I no longer experiment with other recipes because nothing compares to this recipe my grandma always used.  If I'm making four or more pies at a time, I use my food processor.  My lard is always kept in the fridge, and before I begin, I place a glass of water in the freezer.  (Cold ingredients ensure a more workable dough.)  I briefly pulse the flour, lard, and salt to form pea-sized balls.  I add between 4 and 6 T. of ice water, depending on humidity, until a ball forms.  (A slightly sticky dough is easier to work with than one that's too dry.)  Work quickly!  Do not overwork the dough or allow the ingredients to warm to room temp!  I bake the bottom crust for a few minutes before adding the filling.  I've been told on many occasions, "This is the best pie I've ever had in my life!" 
****I often skip refrigerating the dough if I'm making one or two pies and have no problems.

I have been using this same one for over 50 years. my mom always had me make the pies,she said mine came out better than hers.  I noticed there wasn't any temperature or
time listed. For people new to this might be helpful.

Went looking for a lard crust recipe to compare it to my Grandmothers recipe that I've had for forever... this is exactly the same and I've always thought my grandmothers crust was very flaky and delicious. So this confirms that the recipe I've relied on for many years is still the perfect crust recipe!

Like others, I've been using this recipe for 40ish years and my Mom used it for decades more with the only difference being we made three times this recipe (6 c flour, 1 lb lard - there are 2 cups lard in a pound so 6/3 cups, 1 tbsp salt or a little less, but also 5 teaspoons brown sugar). It would be premixed and stored in the cupboard. When she needed a pie crust, she would measure out 2 cups for a two-crust pie and add enough water to bring the dough together - somewhere between 3 and 5 tbsp for 2 cups mix. No refrigeration Always ready Always delicious. Always flaky. I'm going to keep my extra in the fridge this time as I don't make pies as often. Waiting for my apple pie now.

This is a basic recipe since time began.  If you can't make this come out great then you better stick to the store bought.

Never had any luck making pie crusts, but this one turned out great and definitely my new favorite.  I used a cheese grater to shred the lard and just stirred it with a spoon.  I did add more than the 5 tablespoons of ice water and also added a touch of sugar.  But the first time I had a flaky crust.

I'm so glad to find this recipe.  It is the recipe that I have used for years, but lost.  Heavy on the lard, yes, but we don't eat pie often enough to matter.

I have been baking for over 50 years and have had rave reviews from my mom's pie crust recipe and my number #1 favorite pastry pie crust from Southern Living recipe book.  But when I tried this recipe, it was a nightmare trying to roll out.  It kept falling apart.  For the bottom pie crust, I spent  most of my time  patching it together.  When I made the top pie crust, I had to keep sprinkling with flour and folding and rolling.  It was far too time intensive to say the least.   The pie came out flaky.  After testing the crust ,  I can already tell  from  past experience with  pie crusts that it will fall apart when slicing.

This is the original pie crust my Great Grandma use to make.  The trick is to make sure you get non hydrogenated leaf lard.  Lard with non of the chemicals such as BHA, propyl gallate and citric acid.  Lard is fantastic fat with no trans fats and actually healthier than butter or other fats.  It makes for a perfectly  flaky.

This was a good base to start with. I just subbed the AP flour with the wheat free blend I use when baking for my husband. I think it turned out to be one of the best pie crusts I have ever made.

It was far to dry and would not even come close to forming dough, even with twice as much water added.

Measurements should always be given by weight.

Delicious old-fashioned crust. Savory, flakey,  bakes nicely golden, and it's easy to do. I used Merrill Snowcap Manteca.

Hard as a rock, not fluffy or flakey and followed the recipe too. Going to go back to the food processor style.
I've never been good with pie crust manually. Does it require special flour? How much needing?
