This is a very good sweet bread!  Contrary to the earlier reviewers' negative comments, I think this type of sweetbread is supposed to be rather dense, which is exactly the appeal.  If you bake all 6 at the same time, however, increase bake time to 45-50 minutes at sea level, and rotate the pans between shelves halfway through to avoid burning the inside crust.  Also, while I, too, found that the dough didn't rise nearly as much as expected, it did rise to a perfect level during baking.  Hang with this recipe and you'll get a perfectly delicious sweet bread!!

There must be amisprint on this recipe, it never stiffened up, I could have poured it into the pans.  I have made this before so I know what to expect and this was not it.

I have been making Portuguese sweet bread for 30 years and was looking for a recepie that was less dense.  This one got a 5 for flavor and texture but a 3 for instructions.  It took far longer to rise and cook than indicated.  The full recipe is not for whimps...it is a LOT of dough to handle.  I put some in mini loaf pans to give away...big hit!  This will be my go-to recipe.

Don't complain. Look at the recipe -- sugar and eggs at that amount slow down the rise time. You can either let it rise longer or add a tbsp of yeast to the ingredients. You'll have a lighter loaf. Otherwise, if you like denser, give it some time to rise. Overall, excellent recipe for such a very sweet bread.

I LOVED THIS! I made this bread for my high school grad party, and this was the main attraction!! This recipe made 6 loaves, and in less than 24 hours, all the loaves were gone. I read that people who reviewed had trouble getting the dough to rise, so I decided to add one extra package of yeast. The results were wonderful! This is an easy recipe and great for parties. I HIGHLY recommend this.

I don't know if yeast I used was just bad, but I made this recipe for Easter, and the dough never rose.  The bread ended up being more like a loaf cake or a spice cake/bread consistancy.  I wouldn't recommend using this recipe if you want a fluffy sweet bread.

I made this recipe with the help of my son Jett.  This is the real deal Portuguese Sweet Bread.   It's a heavier,  sweet bread,  with a light,  fragrant taste.   I tried this just in time for Portuguese Day.  I'm definitely using this recipe,  along with my own recipe for Portuguese Bean Soup and malasadas.

This recipe was alright but I'm still looking for a recipe that has a true sweetbread flavor.

This recipe seems like it doesn't have enough sugar in it...? It has no vanilla or lemon flavoring and doesn't result in a fluffy, full loaf as I expected it would. Perhaps it could be tweaked to become what I expected but I would like to come by a true, old world sweetbread recipe.

Very good! I scaled down the recipe to make about 20 rolls and added the grated zest of half an orange. I used less sugar to my own personal taste. Will make this recipe again! Thank you, John!

Made a few times for Easter. As with another reviewer, i have family from the Azores and was looking for a recipe that matched my grandmother's bread. This is the closest I've found. It make a lot of bread! I half the recipe and have learned that it cooks best when split into 4 loaves and for closer to 40 min. I start it the night before do the first rise, punch it down, then second rise over night, finally shape and third rise in the morning. I also add some vanilla and almond extract and a quarter cup of orange juice.

I make this at Mother's Day for my wife.  I usually make one loaf and the rest rolls. The loaf makes great French toast the next morning. So far I have cut the recipe in half and thirds with equally great success.

Anxious to try! Fond memories of my G-Grandmother (sao Miguel,Azores-Hawaii-USA) making this bread. She would place the huge bowl of dough on the dryer to rise & the aroma would be throughout the house even b4 baking!

this bread was awesome, i did have some problems but had i went through some reviews before hand i think i would have figured out why, 1. it didn't rise, being that theres so much sugar and eggs i should have added a lil more yeast or let it sit longer. overall i'm not taking it to Thanksgiving dinner since MINE did not rise, but hey it makes a great breakfast bread with sausage and egg... i will be trying this again! thanks

The bread was undercooked in the middle.  The flavor was fantastic, however.  Still managed to goble it up.

I have made 2 half recipes of this & neither have risen at all until in the oven.  The flavor is great & the texture is not bad, but it does not rise at all for me, even when sitting for up to 8 hours before I give up, make it into rolls & bake it.
