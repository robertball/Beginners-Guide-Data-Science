I was so excited to make this drink, but it was a huge disappointment.  This was absolutely terrible.  My husband did not enjoy it, either.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The problem was the Smirnoff white grape vodka.  It tasted exactly like childrens chewable grape tylenol.  The flavor was really strong, and wasn't masked by the other components of the drink.  If grape tylenol is a flavor you enjoy, then I guess this is the drink for you.  I will say that squeezing the lemon in at the end is the only thing that made this drink even remotely tolerable.  I might some day give this recipe one more chance using a NON-flavored vodka, but I will NEVER make this drink as the recipe indicates.

On our last girls night get together, I brought the makings for this drink. Even my non-drinker friend had 3 of these. Thanks for the recipe.

I love this drink!  I think the flavors are fantastic.  I typically use Sierra Mist Free and lime instead of lemon.  And maybe a dash more vodka. ;o)  This does not taste like children's chewable tylenol at all, are you kidding me?!  It is pretty sweet, but it's definitely one of my favorites when I'm in the mood for a "girly" drink!
