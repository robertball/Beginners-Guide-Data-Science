2.17.16 Looking at the nutritional info it s a given that these cornbread muffins break down skinny but unfortunately the flavor also is skinny. From a presentation point of view I didn t like the way the top of the muffin collapsed. I also wasn t crazy about the dense texture since I m used to a lighter cornbread. It s OK. Shantelle thanks for sharing your recipe.

Meh. Not a ton of flavor and the flavor it did have seemed hollow. I'd rather eat something with more calories with more flavor and a more robust taste.
