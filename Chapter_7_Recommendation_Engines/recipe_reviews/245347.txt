I've had sumac and pomegranate molasses in my cupboard for some time, wanting to do Something with them, so I was happy to see this recipe. I found the bitterness of the lemon combined with the bitterness of the sumac and the tartness of the pomegranate as well the vinegar a bit overwhelming. I added about a tablespoon of sugar to round out the flavour. It also seemed a bit lax for a salad dressing to not have olive oil, so I added about 1/3c. These two additions really pulled out the flavours of the ingredients, combined with the nuttiness of the arugula and sweetness of the walnuts made it a very tasty salad. I think adding some finely crumbled goat cheese would also bring the salad to another level. Next time I might omit the vinegar since there is so much lemon juice, as it might not be needed. But then again, Maybe perhaps this salad is meant to be very bitter and sour, so if that's what one is looking for it will taste just that. If not, it's a good start for further tweaking.
