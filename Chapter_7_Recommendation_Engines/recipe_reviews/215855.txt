I recently made this recipe for a few friends and my boyfriend and it turned out great!  I doubled the recipe for 6 people.  I did make a few changes, I added 3 cups of fresh spinach and 1/2 cup of fresh green onions to the sauce (I used 40 ounces of sauce I had at home).  I also substituted a can of Rotel for the can of diced tomatoes.  I had the top layer be cheese and I covered it with tin foil for the first 15 minutes and then cooked it uncovered for the remaining 15 minutes to let the cheese brown.  My friends asked for the recipe and my boyfriend said to make it again soon!

Really easy and really good. What I really like about this recipe is that even if you are not a natural cook you can easily tweak this recipe to your own tastes to make it even better. 
For us, I use the canned diced tomatoes with garlic and basil. I also cook half a chopped onion with the ground beef.  Next time I make this, I will do even more (maybe add some red pepper flakes in with the ground beef and onion) to make it even better.

This was a very quick and easy recipe!  I loved how it turned out . . . Although, I didn't have any ground beef so I just did without it but it still was delicious!

We loved this! I did add a clove of minced garlic and about 2Tbl Italian seasoning to the beef when browning it. It just added a nice extra boost to the sauce. I also waited until the last 15min to add the top layer of cheese so it didn't get overly crispy. Very yummy!

I was very happy with this recipe!  I did alter it a bit by adding chooped onion, garlic & mushrooms to the ground beef. I also added fresh basil in the layers. I didn't have Monteray Jack, but I did however have grated Parmesan...I actually doubled the amount of cheese, and put it under the broiler after I removed the foil for a few minutes to make the cheese nice and brown...Mmmmmmmmmmmmm...Will make this again!

A family favorite!!!  I like to add some mushrooms to the sauce and a bit of garlic. But lemme tell you... ease and cheese are always good at our house.  Plus my two year old can eat it herself!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!
