This is a great eggplant recipe.  Instead of frying, I baked them.  I added 1 tsp seasoned salt, and 1/2 tsp tumeric to the coating.  I also brushed the pieces with olive oil, then coated them.  I placed them on a baking sheet lined with parcement paper.  400 degrees fo about 30-40 minutes, turning at the halfway point.

YUM! This is the best. I played around with this recipe a little and came up with the following. I mixed the cornmeal with some whole wheat flour, added chili powder, garlic salt and oregano. I dipped the eggplant slices in better than eggs then in the dry mixture. I baked these on a well oiled cookie sheet until done. If you cut these slices thick enough, they don't taste dry at all. The thicker ones were moist on the inside and nicely cruncy on the outside. I am so glad eggplant is on sale right now so I can make this again next week.

This is outstanding. Even people who normally do not like eggplant will enjoy these. The only change that I made was to spray them with olive oil PAM type spray and bake until done rather then fry them. Kayswv

I grilled the eggplant instead of frying it-it was not bad. To help the breading stick to the eggplant, I dipped it into eggbeaters. I served with a horseradish sauce which gave it a good zing.

These were quite good but I did change the seasoning a bit.  Hubby and I aren't great fans of oregano so I added garlic power and parsley and cut the chili powder in half.  It suited our taste very well and I will make these again using those seasonings as well as dipping in egg mixture to help the coating stick better.  I sliced my eggplant thick and served it with spaghetti as a side.

This is a simple but tasty preparation that I'll definitely make again. I cut the eggplant thick -- about 3/4 inch. I also cooked some zucchini the same way, cut in third lengthwise (they were small zucchinis). I added some garlic powder to the cornmeal mix, and I baked instead of frying the vegetables. I cooked at 400 for about 40 minutes, using plenty of oil and flipping halfway through. I'm very satisfied with these; they go great with the stuffed shells I made for dinner.

We Grilled them and followed the recipe to a T. No flavor, not enough seasoning, should have used olive oil or egg to make the seasoning stick. Should not have used cornmeal at all on the grill. Fried it may have been ok, but the idea of using this recipe on the grill is completely bogus. sorry

Sadly, I did not like this at all.  Eggplant really soaks up oil (I probably should have thought of that earlier). So, in the end each piece was so saturated with oil that you could barely taste the eggplant.  And with a recipe that calls for a quart of oil you're in for many, many unneeded calories.   Sorry, it was a flop for me.

saved it by putting tomatoes, cheese and fresh basil with a quick shot under the broiler.  Will definitely not make again.

I usually use bread crumbs but the cornmeal gave it an interesting flavor with a crisper coating.

this recipe was a big ole mess. i baked as others suggested. total disaster. the eggplant was mushy and the breading just tasted raw/hard. it would have been a total loss if i hadn't made a bruschetta to go on top. the juices from the bruschetta actually blended with the eggplant to make it palatable. in conclusion: stay away!

This is a great recipe.  I embellished the recipe by brushing  them with olive oil and used Panko bread crumbs instead of cornmeal and baked  on parchment paper @ 400 for 20 minutes, turning after 10.  Delicious.

Excellent recipe. I did not find these oily at all, and would recommend keeping the heat med-high to avoid that. They could use a little more salt, and I am not a big salt "adder" normally, so you could just add later to taste. I also used 1/2 panko and 1/2 cornmeal, and the texture was even better than just plain cornmeal. Beefing up the oregano and chili powder helps a little with the overall taste.

These eggplants do taste very good and are very easy to make. Unfortunately, if you worry about your weight,they are not the healthiest option.  They absorb a lot of oil and feel like a sponge full of fat when you eat them.

This had a very nice smoky flavor when we grilled it... however, it was a bit dry.  That was easily fixed by serving it with a little chipotle mayo.

I followed the breading recipe except I added an egg. I baked half and fried half, I loved the baked ones they were so good. Hubby however said the baked ones were too mushy, he liked the fried ones better. Thanks for a great recipe!

The cornmeal added a great crunch to the outside of this fried eggplant.  I had eggplant leftover from another recipe and was unsure what to do with it.  This was a perfect "snack" for me and I ate the rounds with salsa for an added kick of spice.  In addition to the chili powder and oregano, I added some adobo seasoned salt blend with a bit of turmeric to lend a nice golden color to the crust.  I will definitely make this again.

Really good.  Instead of plain cornmeal I used Martha White Mexican Cornbread Mix, and fried in small amount of olive oil.  Even my kids liked it.

We tried these grilled - did not enjoy them.  Was a bit deceived in that the description said grilled, yet there was no instruction on timing on the grill.  We won't be doing this again.

This is a good recipe. I baked the eggplant in the oven based on reviews from other cooks.  I added a little turmeric, smoked paprika and cayenne to the coating/mix. It needs more seasonings for our taste. I would make this again.

I used panko instead of cornmeal. The flavor was good but you definitely need eggs to make the breading stick. Also, as others mentioned the eggplant really soaked up the oil when fried.

I used olive oil, instead of veggie oil. I added flour and not just cornmeal and seasoning salt instead of chilli powder and oregano.  It was a hit.  I also caramelized an onion and served them with that on top as a side to spaghetti and marinara.  So tasty.  Hubby and I couldn't get enough, but the kids were too nervous about the egg part of eggplant.

Try again using the normal recipe.  But I stole inspiration from here and soaked & pressed my eggplant, seasoned with chili powder, salt and oregano (go light on the salt) and pan fried in some butter and olive oil.  Was very good.  Next time peal most of the rind away.

I love this recipe however,I sometimes change it up by just slicing the eggplant and dipping the slices in egg then bread crumbs and fry them with salt and pepper and its just as good. you can also sprinkle a little bit of shredded cheese on it or put fete and tomatoes slides its a yummy and healthy meal. the kids I care for and my little siblings love them.
