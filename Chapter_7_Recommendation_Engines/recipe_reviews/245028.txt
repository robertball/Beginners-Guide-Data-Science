This is a gorgeous, flavourful dessert! It's also easy to prepare ahead of time so you aren't rushed.

I had to use vanilla bean paste (15 ml or 1 T = 1 vanilla pod) but it's the next best thing.

Excellent! I brought them to a dinner party and everyone loved them. I used only 1 cup of sugar and it was plenty.

Your method of removing seeds wastes fruit. I sliced ready to eat pear lengthwise and easily removed seeds AND stem.

This was so delicious! Very sweet! I might cut back on the sugar next time and see what the difference is. I added two extra cups of water and a few extra pears. Didnâ€™t seem to change the recipe at all. The recipe is easy to follow and wonderful! I just melted chocolate chips to use for the chocolate. Soooooo good!!!

I made some slight modifications and it was delicious.  I used vanilla extract rather than the vanilla bean and I used caramel instead of chocolate.  Fantastic!
