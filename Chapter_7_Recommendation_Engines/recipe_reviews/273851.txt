Good and very easy. I used a lot of paprika and also sprinkled some garlic powder on them.

This is simple enough to make, but needs more seasonings. The lemon, paprika, and salt on its own isn’t enough. Even the addition of a little black pepper won’t improve it. Maybe add some oregano and garlic might help.

Made these last night for dinner and they were excellent for being so simple! I did double the paprika to give it more flavor but that was the only change I made. 25 minutes was the perfect time for  me.
