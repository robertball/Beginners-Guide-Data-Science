The meat came out fanstastic! The cooking time was spot on. Very tender. I would have given it five stars except if you follow the recipe to the letter, I found the meat incredibly spicy! My wife is the spice lover in the family (eats jalepeno slices out of the jar) and she couldn't eat it right out of the smoker. I had to scrape off all the visible rub to make it edible for us. I will definitely cook this again, but I will use a quarter of the cayenne or I might try one brisket without the cayenne all together. With that said, if you love the heat, this recipe is perfect!! It would make an awesome spicy soft taco or wrap.

This was my first time to smoke or even cook brisket.  The recipe was easy enough and my family loved it.  My wife is especially sensitive to spicier foods but she had no complaints about it being too hot.  I did follow the recipe.  I used about a 12 lb brisket and had more than enough spice rub for the meat.  I was only able to rub down the meat and refrigerate for 12 hrs instead of the recommended 24 hrs and my smoking time was also less by a couple of hours.  I used pecan for my smoking wood.  I will definitely use this again.  Thanks for making me look good.

I’m fine with the rub and smoke time.  Note,  smoke will only get into the meat for 4-6 hours.  You’re just adding bark after that.  Before wrapping,  add a can of beef broth.  Pull at at temp of 198-204.  Rest in a cooler with towels across the top of the tinfoiled brisket fir 2.5 -4 hours.  Resting a brisket is a huge part of how juicy it will be.

I loved the rub.  I used a smaller piece of meat so have lots left over for next time.  Because my meat was smaller I should have adjusted the time.  I felt it was a little dry.  So I will monitor the time next time.  Which is today.

I cut the cayenne pepper in 1/2 and used chipotle and it was still very hot.  The next time I make it I will only use the chipotle and see how that works.

I used a burboun smoked black pepper but used all other ingredients. By far the best smoked brisket going. This and a dark, heavy, smoky red and you're in heaven!

Made this yesterday and could not be happier. Also added oregano and dried mustard. Cooking time was a bit shorter since I used a 6.5lb brisket. Moist, tender and delicious!

We made this recipe for our July 4th bbq and it was really simple and turned out great.  Our first time using a new smoker and it couldn't have been better.

I followed the instructions to a T, except used half the cayenne pepper. Still was too overpowering. Will try a variant of this rub another time.

Just a couple of suggestions... Don't soak the wood. Use chunks rather than chips and add additional chucks as needed for the first 4 hours. Lastly, don't use the Texas Crutch method to overcome the stall. Doing so may cause the bark to become soggy; instead, increase the temp to 300 or simply leave it at 220 and power through.

This is my third round with this recipe. I used prime cut the first time and choice cut the last two times. Both cuts turn out a very moist and delicious brisket. This last time; I cut most everything in the rub recipe, except the sugars and the salt, by 1/3. I do like the full heat, but others do not appreciate it as much. No matter; the end result has always been a very flavorful brisket that was complemented by all. Cutting the rub recipe really makes a such a difference for us that it’ll likely be our go to from now on.

Love, love, LOVE this recipe! Huge hit with everyone... however,  I lessened the spice since we have a few in the family that don't like hot. This has become my go-to!

Was disappointed with the doneness (too well done, based on temps in the recipe) and not near enough "smoke". Rub was just OK as well.

I used my own home-made rub, onion powder, paprika, etc.  and smoked for eight hours with pecan and hickory wood. It was great. I would refer this to anyone who wants to try smoking brisket in the Texas manner
