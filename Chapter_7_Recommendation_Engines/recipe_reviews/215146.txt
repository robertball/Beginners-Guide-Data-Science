I MAKE THIS WAY TOO OFTEN. It's SO good that it's almost addicting! A great way to use leftover plums. 1 cup of all-purpose flour is fine if you don't have whole wheat - it worked for me!

I tried this with gala apples, but the apples came out pretty dry, shriveled and flavorless. Will experiment with other apples.

I tried this with nectarines too - delicious! I dipped each nectarine slice in some honey before I placed them on the dough then added the cinnamon and sugar. They came out beautifully golden and sweet!

I used more plums than called for and will use even more for my next bake - probably 5 or 6 med. I added a tsp or so of vanilla for some added flavour.  I will make again with more vanilla and more cinnamon.  Great quick dessert.

Was very simple to make. Only change I made was using 1 cup all-purpose flour since I don't have whole wheat flour on hand. The only negative was that the flavor wasn't as sweet as I was hoping. Maybe more sugar would make it better? Took a picture as well and will add that to the recipe.

Dad loved this, he is the plum guy in the family. But the last plums we bought were not as sweet as he liked so I tried this recipe. Very easy recipe, things you would already have in your pantry, I did add a 1 teaspoon of vanilla and used 1/2 brown sugar instead of all white. Probably sprinkled a little extra on top too. Would make it again.

I only had six small plum and was finding it very difficult to find a recipe to suit, when I came across this one. It tasted fabulous and was very easy to make. I know some people have made this recipe with just plain flour, but I would urge you to use the whole wheat flour. It gives the cake an almost nutty flavor and a bit more texture. The only thing I changed, was to add more sugar to my plums as they weren't particularly sweet. My whole family loved it. Thank you

Fantasic.  I used about 2x the plums, cut into cubes, and pressed all the way down into the batter.  Rave reviews and so easy.

I had some very over ripe nectarines, so after some searching, I found this recipe. I used 1 cup of ap flour since I did not have any whole wheat, and I added a tsp. of vanilla to the batter. I put this in a solid bottom tart pan, and it baked up beautifully, even though I thought there would not be enough batter. Only change I would make is to not put 1 tsp. of cinnamon on top of the cake before baking as I found that was too much. I would instead just do a quick shake of cinnamon straight from the bottle over all the fruit. My family loved it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for desert.  I'll be sure to try it with some plums from my backyard once they ripen up since it's such an easy and delicious recipe to prepare.

This was a wonderful way to use the over abundant plums from our tree! I added a tsp of cinnamon, a half tsp each of ginger and nutmeg, and a quarter tsp each of allspice and ground cloves to the dry ingredients. Scrumptious!

The only thing I changed was to substitute coconut oil for the butter.  My son has a dairy allergy, and butter substitutes don't always bake well.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was FABULOUS.  So much easier than making a pastry crust and everyone in my family loved it.  Only complaint I had was that it was a little salty, so I may cut back the salt a bit next time.  Because I definitely plan to make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! Made it vegan by substituting coconut oil for butter, and chia seeds/water for eggs.

Made it twice,  once as directed.  Second  with more plums, quartered and a scant  1/3-1/2 c. of a crumble crust since we like more plums.  Pan size is important.  Delicious!   Nicely sized for a two people.  It kept well refrigerated for a few days.

My family could not have enough of this tart, so I made it time and a half. It fit perfectly in a 13x9 pan this way.

Made two and gave them away.  Both parties said they loved it !!!  One German friend said it was reminiscent of what her mother used to make.

This recipe is so good & easy! I made it twice with plums, and just put a batch in the oven with mixed frozen berries. The only change I made was to put some  fruit into the bottom of the pan as well as on top of  the batter. Be sure to use at least half whole wheat flour because it adds so much flavor and texture.

I've probably made this five times already. It is so easy and so delicious, especially warm with vanilla ice cream on top. I've used mostly pears, but I think it's best with plums. And I've only used all purpose flour since I never seem to have any whole wheat flour around whilst making this tart. When I make it with pears it seems to take only 30 minutes in the oven. When I made it with plums it took 45 minutes and I had to use a foil tent 30 min in to prevent burning.

I ended up using coconut oil in place of butter because I was out. Same amount. Worked great.
