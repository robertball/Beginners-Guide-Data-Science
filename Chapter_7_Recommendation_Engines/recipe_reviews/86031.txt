This stuff is seriously awesome as a spread! I do however only use 2 Tbsp. of oregano and add fresh garlic vs. garlic powder. You can add this to hot cooked pasta, spread over fresh bread, melt over grilled corn, or top off grilled potatoes or grilled veggies. I use it a lot for garlic bread. When I do that I add fresh minced garlic, about a couple of cloves and 1/2 tsp. of olive oil. I bake the bread at 425 for 10 to 12 minutes or stick it under the broiler and watch it closely.

Very yummy. I used Italian seasoning instead of parsley and oregano. Also increased the garlic a little. Very tasty when spread on bread and put under the broiler for a couple mins :)

I followed this recipe as is. Very overwhelming. Perhaps would have been more successful dramatically decreasing the oregano.

Easy to prepare. I used fresh oregano. Also I used it as a spread on french bread and broiled it for a few minutes. Everyone said the bread was the best part of the meal!

All the dry herbs in this ended up making it almost gritty tasting when I slathered it on bread.  I think I'd using it for cooking, but not on bread again.

I cut way back on the oregano and added lots more of the garlic powder. A few minutes under the broiler and you've got some great bread. Thanks so much!

this was delicious.  Quick and easy.  I spread it on italian bread and popped in in the oven for a few minutes.  I cut the oregano in half however.

I read all these reviews and everyone said use less oregano.  Unless they are seeing a different recipe it only calls for 1/2 teaspoon.  I made it as written and loved it!  Thanks for sharing!!! I think I will find many uses for the herb butter.
