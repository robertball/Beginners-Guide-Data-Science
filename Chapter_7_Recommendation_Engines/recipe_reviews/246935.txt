This is a great substitute for people who don't eat eggs but also for anyone who has found themselves without eggs and in need of a pancake, muffin, or cookie. This also adds some necessary nutrition to your meal. Try adding this to your soup or stew to thicken it! Thank you for the recipe.

this works very well, good for baking when u realize at the last minute that you don't have enough eggs...
