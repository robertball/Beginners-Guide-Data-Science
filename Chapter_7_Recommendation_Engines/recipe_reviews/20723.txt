I buy the cheapest beef I can find, pound it out really thin and cut it into strips about 1 1/2" wide and 8-9" long. Put the strips into a ziploc with this marinade overnight and put the strips onto wooden skewers soaked in olive oil the next day. Place them on the grill and there has NEVER been enough! These things go like you wouldn't believe!

This marinade is excellent. I used this to broil steaks two weeks ago. When I told my husband we were having steak tonight, he told me to use "that marinade you used a couple weeks ago". Awesome! It was good using the original recipe, but tonight I played around with it to make it my own. I added 1/2 tsp more garlic (using garlic powder since I don't have any fresh garlic), 1/2 tsp ginger, a squeeze of lime juice, a dash of pepper, a dash of onion powder, a tsp of worcestershire sauce, a dash of pineapple juice, a tablespoon of cornstarch for thickening, and a dash of Franks red hot sauce. Excellent!

Very good recipe! Add a little less sguar though. I added a dash of groudn black pepper and a table soon of lime juice for a tangy flavor and it worked great! Add a tablesppon or so of cornstartch and mix very well till all clumps are disovled and then coat whatever you want to marinade. This will thicken the sauce up a bit when you cook the food which is what a good teriyaki sauce does.

This is good! I added some ginger, not because I anticipated that it needed any, but because I LOVE ginger. It is really easy and I will definitely use it again. I used reduced sodium soy sauce, because I was afraid that it would be too salty with regular. I was also nervous about the cinnamon, because it seemed out of place in a teriyaki sauce, but it did give nice flavor. I used this marinade to make Amber's Sesame chicken.

An excellent Teriyaki Marinade.  I replaced the 1/3c of water with beer (helps tenderize the meat, and the alcohol evaporates during cooking) and added a spritz of lemon juice to balance out the flavour.  I will certainly make it again.

SUPERB!!  I used this on boneless center-cut pork chops and added a little lemon juice and a couple dashes of pepper, as others suggested. Marinated for 6+ hrs and threw them on the grill. Simply outstanding. Keep the cinnamon, it makes them different!  Try this!

This was very yummy Joanne. My family loves teriyaki chicken, and since I had some relatives visiting, I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to try out this recipe.  I went ahead and used the cinnamon (despite previous reviewers) and added a little ground ginger as well.  Excellent results! The cinnamon adds a little hint of something "different". We used this on chicken tenders and threw them on the grill.  I made coconut rice to go along with this.  Good recipe.

They did have a lot of flavor, I just didn't appreciate it and neither did my husband. If I make this again I will leave out the cinnamon.

I substituted garlic for the cinnamon, and also added a pinch (1/4 tsp.) of ground ginger. This marinade made my grilled shrimp finger lickin' good. I'll definitely use this one again!

A definite winner!!  Do use the cinnamon; it gives a different zing than the usual ginger in a teriyaki marinade.  I thought the Asian Barbequed Steak on this site was the best marinade I have ever used (and still do, please do yourself a favor and try it for a wonderful marinade), but this was almost as good. Thanks for a great recipe.

Delicious and easy!  I added 2 large cloves of garlic (minced) to the marinade before marinading boneless chicken breasts for 3 hours.  The biggest compliment came from my son who said the chicken tasted "just like the chicken at Chinese restaurants!"

Used this on wings.  Very easy - very good.  Here's a tip on cooking the wings that I got from a take-out place at Hampton Beach.  After marinading the chicken for 24 hours, flash fry in deep fryer for 1 minute.  Remove and then either bake or warm on the grill.

We LOVE Terryaki in our house and I am forever trying to find one that is like what we used to get when we were in College. Well this is INCREDIBLE, I have even taken it and created a sauce out of it to cook in... it is a wonderful recipe, so easy and simple I could kick myself! THANK YOU! Also great with extra garlic in it.. hehe

Easy and tasty.  Simple to scale down for just 2 people.  I used the marinade on chicken and served with an asian style rice for a simple weeknight meal.

This was great! The cinnamon was hard to blend in but I love cinnamon. Watch the meat closely on the grill because with the brown sugar it can burn easily.
Thanks!

Marinaded a sirloin overnight.  Good and easy recipe, but will cut the cinnamon in half, and maybe add a dash or 2 of worcheshire.

This is the "best" marinade I have ever tried! The first time I used it for baked chicken breasts and my husband loved them. Most recently, I used it on butterfly pork chops stuffed with wild rice.  After marinating overnight, I stuffed the pork chops and baked for 45 minutes. The marinade even flavored the rice! Great for anything from baked to grilled.  Thanks for this versatile and yummy recipe.

I made this as written with pork chops, marinated it for about 5 hours and it came out delicious. I definitely wouldn't get rid of the cinnamon. I read some of the other reviews and I may play around with the recipe just to see how it turns out. I will probably try adding ginger (not substituting anything) and maybe cornstarch. I also think this would taste very good on shrimp, I'll have to try that one next time.

This is an AMAZING marinade!!  Just used it to marinate two pieces of fish.  Kept the recipe as is, marinated for only an hour in the 'fridge, and baked the two filets at 400 degrees for 30 min.  Tender and tasty, and full of flavor.  Can only imagine how EXTRA flavorful a good cut of steak or chicken breast would be using this and grilling over the open flame... Can't wait to give it a try!!

Wonderful! Granted I used this more as a base for a marinade (I added more garlic, water, soy sauce, mustard powder, ginger, teriyaki sauce (from the bottle), and brought to a boil), but it came out fantastic!

We used this marinade for chicken kebabs and were fabulously impressed with how they turned out.  Easy to make, minimal ingredients and no exotic ingredients called for.  Marinated chicken (cut into chunks) for about 3 hours and it came out moist and deliciously full of flavor.  I did add about 1/4 tsp of ground ginger as well, and would certainly recommend that addition.  We will definitely be using this one again!

This recipe was actually very good.  I marinaded some chicken over night in it.  What surprised me is I am not a big cinnamon eater.  I hate the way it smells and I usually dislike most dishes with cinnamon.  However, this recipe did not have an overpower cinnamon taste...for any of you cinnamon haters like myself, just give this a try once and you will not be disappointed.  Very easy and quick...did not have to slave over the stove at all.  Threw in some fresh veggies and rice to complete the meal.  REALLY good...5 stars.

Not overly impressed with this recipe...I used boneless pork loin chops and marinated them overnight, and they still didn't taste of anything---they weren't bad, they just weren't...well, teriyaki-y!  Unfortunately, I've got chicken breasts in the freezer in this marinade, so it gets a second chance, but I don't think I'll use it again unless the chicken turns out spectacularly.

Great marinade. Easy to follow and mix. I added 1 doubled the batch and added 1 tsp worchester sauce, 1/2 tsp ginger and finely chopped green onions. It made enough for a family-size package of pork chops..Thanks!

We all enjoyed this marinade on our pork steaks, which we grilled. Made exactly to recipe and enjoyed every bite. We allowed our pork to marinade in a ziploc bag approximately 6 hours, changing the bags position every so often. Thanks for sharing! My mouth is starting to water just thinking about this meal. I will try this on beef also.

Great for marinating chicken breasts overnight!  I decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, substituted ginger for cinnamon, and increased the garlic to 1 1/2 tsp.  Simple and delicious!

This is delicious!!  It is so simple to make, and the taste is wonderful!  I also used ginger instead of cinnamon.  I have used this on many different meats, and it is always a big hit!   My husband and children ask for this quite often!  Thanks for this terrific recipe!

This marinade is the BEST! I marinaded some boneless chicken breast overnight and the next day around 5 I grilled them on my GF grill. They were so moist and juicy and so full of flavor that we could not stop eating them. I will be using this marinade all the time. THANK YOU!

This is the very best marinade I've ever tried. My family couldn't stop raving over this. I marinated pork and steak (for kabobs).  I also used ginger instead, and also added extra garlic.
I also added mushroom and onion pieces to the marinade about 1 hour before grilling. This has become a new family favorite for us.  Thank you for a great recipe!!!!

This was very good.  I used it on boneless, skinless chicken breasts and then grilled them.  They were very moist!  The chicken was very good the next day cold on a salad.  As per other suggestions, I used ginger instead of cinnamon.  Next time I will try it on beef.  Thanks!

This is truly the best marinade EVER!  I love that I do not have to add any oil to it meaning less flare up on the grill and overall healthier... The longer you let this marinade, the better it is!

The cinnamon overwhelmed this marinade and I feel it was just a weird flavor that ended up overwhelming the dish.  I even added more soy sauce to try and dilute it but cinnamon is a tough flavor to mellow.  Maybe a dash of cinnamon would be ok but not half a teaspoon.

I think this marinade is fabulous!!  I have made it with and without the Cinnamon ... I don't really notice much of a difference personally.  I have only used it on steaks so far... I may try it on Chicken soon!  So good!

Hard to believe that something so simple could taste so good. The cinnamon makes all of the difference. I sometimes replace it with 5-spice powder to give it a bit more complexity

I made this as a marinade for pork chops the other day and it was a huge hit! My husband is not a fan of pork chops, but he loved these!! I only let them marinade for a few hours though and I think next time I will definately let them sit over night, the flavor had not sunk in enough for my taste, but a great recipe all the same!

the reason i give this as many as three stars is because i thickened it with cornstarch and used it as a sauce on noodles, so my review may be slightly unfair. but i agree with one reviewer; the cinnamon ruins it. my husband said it was too "cinnamony" and he ate more of it than me.

Followed the recipe, and it was too sweet for our taste (on chicken). I could see it on pork skewers on the grill, so we will give it another shot when summer comes around. I'm giving 4 stars, because if you like sweet, this is a good recipe.

This is a great marinade.  I used it for Chicken Stir-Fry.  I made the marinade and used half of it to marinade a pound of boneless chicken breast that I had cut into bite size pieces.  I took the other half of the marinade and heated it, adding a slurry of 1 Tbl corn starch with 1 Tbl water to thicken the marinade to make a glaze.  After I stir-fried the chicken and a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables, I added the teriyaki glaze.  It was so delicious.  My husband loved it.  The cinnamon in the marinade is that one ingredient that makes the difference.  This will become a regular addition in our house.

This is great.  One of our favorite dinners is flank steak marinaded with this sauce.  Then just broil for 6 to 8 minutes on each side, let rest for a few minutes, and cut on the diagonal.  Really yummy.

My husbands hates teriyaki.  In fact, he calls it teriyucki.  I marinated chicken in this marinade, and he loved it.  I didn't think I would like the cinnamon, but it's great!!  I marinated a rib eye steak overnight, but didn't end up cooking it the next day, so it marinated overnight 2 days.  When I cooked it, it was incredible!  It tasted just like the teriyaki steak you got in a chinese restaurant.

I used this marinade on chicken and then grilled it and it was awesome. It gave the chicken a great flavor. I also soaked some button mushrooms in the marinade (as someone else suggested) and they were delish!

This recipe was set at 5 stars when I found it, and it definitely deserves every single one of them!  I added ginger like one of the other users and I tripled the recipe to make sure it would soak in well, soaked 4 lbs. of pork cubes for a good 6 hours and made shishkabobs.  They turned out wonderful.

I maybe should have marinaded the chicken drumsticks for more than the 2 hours.  They did have good flavor but could have been a little more intense.  Be careful, they burn easily on the grill, I cooked them on the warmer racks above the main one.

Due to circumstances beyond my control, I ended up marinating my boneless pork chops for 48 hours.  Very tender.  If they'd been a bit more flavorful, this would be a five star recipe.

This is yummy.  I've made it twice at family request.  The first time, with cinnamon, the second time with cinnamon and ginger.  Both were hits.  Don't let the funky cinnamon/meat smell scare you off...this is crowd pleasing stuff!

This is exactly what the name says it is, but it should also include best tasting also.  I have used this so many times on different types of meat and the flavor is great.  I do not use the cinnamon though, I increase the garlic to 1 1/2 teaspoons.

I tried this since it had so many high ratings.  I didn't have ginger, so I didn't try the other reviewers' suggestions of substituting ginger for cinnamon.  I wish I had.  The cinnamon was gross to me.  It smelled like an apple pie as it cooked and did not taste appetizing at all.  I couldn't even eat it.  My husband thought it was ok and ate it -- but he only had cut up veggies for lunch ;)  My suggestion is to use something other than cinnamon and doctor this a little bit.

I MARINATED STEAKS IN THIS SAUCE FOR 6 HOURS.  MY HUSBAND, (WHO IS A SAUCE FREAK) DID NOT WANT TO DIP HIS STEAK IN ANYTHING.  HE LOVED IT AND SO DID I.  THE CINNAMON IS THE SECRET INGREDIENT. YUM! THANK YOU SO MUCH..  I WILL DEFINATELY BE MAKING THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN.

Great marinade!  I let beef skewers sit overnight and then BBQ'd them.  I even used chuck steak which can be tough, but the marinade really helped tenderize them.  The skewers had great flavor. . . the cinnamon really gives it an extra kick.  Can't wait to try this on chicken!

Excellent!  I did have enough time to marinade for 2 hours and it was still great.  I grilled it on the forman, so fast and easy!  I would recommend making broccoli and rice or couscous with it to make it a meal!

As with most of the other reviewers, I substitued the cinnamon for ginger.  With that chance, it was fantastic - I used it for salmon, and dumped the rest over my rice.  It works on anything!

This marinade was very tastey.  I must confess, the cinnamon didn't sound good to me so I added 1 1/2 tablespoon worcestershire sauce instead and it turned out great.

Wow what a great marinade. I did switch the cinnamon with ginger and it was great. My kids (4 and 1 yrs.) loved it. It worked great on the BBQ and didn't burn easily like others do.

This was very quick and easy. I found the cinnamon taste a little odd for Teriyaki so when I made this again I substituted ground ginger and it was SO much better. A matter of taste I suppose however it had more of the teriyaki taste when I adjusted the recipe for my family's taste.
It is a great marinade for chicken and chops!

I tried this to go along with Anniversary Chicken on this site, and it was really good.  I did find the cinnamon content to be way too high for my taste, so I lessened it and added more soy sauce.  I also added more garlic to bring out a little more flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great marinade and is a dead ringer for the taste of my local Chinese food restaurant beef teriyaki... I added 1/2 the juice and skin from a clementine orange  to the mix.  Then I boiled the mixture and then let cool before using.  It’s a long extra step but in my opinion well worth the effort!

I made it at 11 am and let it sit until around 5 pm, my aunt, mother, and father all loved it. It was a little too sweet for me (mostly because I added to much brown sugar) but ill definitely make it again now that my family loves it!

I was looking for a different way to cook up some steaks and decided to stir fry them with some vegetables and serve it over rice.  I went to google for a quick marinade and found this.  It was delicious.  I couldn't marinade it for 2 hours like the recipe suggests, more like 15 minutes at best, but the meat did stew with the sauce in the wok for a while, added the vegetables, covered it to let it steam and voila, a new feather in my cap.  Thank you for posting this.

This was a fair substitute, especially since I was out of ginger & craving teriyaki. As is, I give it 3 stars. Wasn’t sweet enough for my taste, so I added some honey, then a splash each of rice wine vinegar & lemon juice for balance. Brought up to 3 1/2 stars.

I would not suggest this sauce to anyone specifically due to the cinnamon. It was an unpleasant and unwelcome flavor that didn't fit in with the dish. Other than that this is a decent base to a recipe and with a few extra additions (rice/Apple cider vinegar, ginger, red pepper flakes, sirracha, lime juice) could be pretty good.

I think that the cinnamon is an error.....I used ginger in place of cinnamon and it is way better.  Cinnamon just doesn't fit.

I personally don't like cinnamon and was sceptical having it in a Teriyaki marinade. It had a very strong cinnamon smell. This marinade is freaking amazing. I used it to marinade pork chops that I cut up and used in my fried rice. The best by far.  Leave the cinnamon! It makes the while marinade! Will make this for other types of meat.

I doubled the recipe and left out the ginger and cinnamon. I added 1 tsp of corn starch per recipe (so 2 tsps in this case). I would ad 3 - 4 tsps or a tbsp and then more if needed. I cut a steak into thin slices and marinated it, then served the beef with teriyaki over steamed rice and broccoli. My teenagers liked it too. Will definitely make it again! It was quick, easy, and really tasty!

Easiest Teriyaki Marinade Haiku: "Used this on chicken, marinated eight hours. Tasted just okay." Prepared this exactly as written and used it boneless chicken breasts that I grilled on George Foreman. I was surprised that it wasn't all that flavorful, especially for what should've been a tasty blend of ingredients, although I am seeing several reviews mentioning additions of other things, such as lime, ginger, beer ... I suppose if I made it again, I'd jazz it up more.

I'm allergic to soy, so I used equal parts South River Miso chickpea tamari and Coconut Aminos instead of the soy sauce. Added minced ginger instead of cinnamon, and used beef broth instead of water. Skipped the sugar. Placed pork chops in it overnight, and they came out amazing. I boiled the marinade for 10 minutes then used it to make stir fry veggies with soft noodles. Perfect meal.

I have to say this recipe was really easy to make and the taste was so amazing! My bf loved it and also my sister,The cinnamon works belive me! If you like Cinnamon dont be afraid to use it, cause the taste is fantastic! I didnt have enough time to make dinner so i only marinated the meat for aprox 1 hour, had to cut the meat into slices, and it was just wonderful! Doing this recipe again soon!

I'm not the biggest fan of pork, but I tried this on bone in pork chops.  LOVED !!  I've also tried on boneless skinless chicken breast, and salmon.  delicious. 
I add some ground ginger, some Worchesteshire, and of course more garlic.
a really fantastic marinade

I did take other reviewers suggestion and left out the cinnamon.  It was the easiest and best ever. Put the chicken in it in the morning and grilled it that evening - delicious!!  Hubby couldn't get enough.

Tasty and simple. I'm saving this one. Made it exactly to the recipe and my wife liked it so much she suggested having guests for dinner using this recipe. We cut up a pork tenderloin and used it for kabobs with red bell peppers, mushrooms and zucchini. Marinated the meat for a for about six hours using 1/2 the mixture and the veggies for about 1/2 hour using the remainder and grilled for about 12 minutes turning after 5 minutes and again 4 minutes later.  Next time I use this recipe I might add a 1/4 tsp of cayenne for a little kick and adding onions to the kabob mix. Also, I will use 1/3 of the mix for the meat marinade and 2/3 for the veggies as there is about twice as much veg to meat. We will try this with chicken and pork chops also.

I cut the recipe in half. I tried the marinade before adding it to the beef and it was extremely salty. I dumped some of it out and poured in water and added more sugar and a few squirts of lime juice. I put in ginger instead of cinnamon. It seemed to do that trick. I loved the sauce. It did burn my pan up pretty badly when I fried my steak, though.
REALLY good otherwise.

It was one of the best marinades I've ever had on any piece of meat. Instead of using soy sauce, I used teriyaki to start with. I also put in a pinch of pepper. I will be making this one again soon enough.

Sorry but we weren't fans on this! One of the reviews I read said that it wasn't too sweet but my boyfriend and I thought it was WAY too sweet. It was like eating candied pork. In all fairness, if you DO like very sweet meat, it marinates well and grilled beautifully (thats why I gave two stars instead of one). Thanks for the recipe, it was worth a shot! That's the fun in cooking! :)

I made this for my boyfriend cause he loves teriyaki. I made it as written, marinated chicken for 2 hours and grilled it. He found it way too sweet. I liked it, but I felt like it needed a little something extra that I couldn't put my finger on. After reading over the reviews again I may try to add some ginger and see if that is what I needed.

I would give it more stars but it was way to sweet and almost (emphasis on almost) defeats the purpose of dessert.  If you don't want it that sweet, cut the sugar by half.

I did add a 1/4 t of ground ginger and for the garlic I pressed 1 clove.  This was super easy and the ingredients are always on hand at my house so, we will be having it often!  Everyone enjoyed it and it is a great way to doctor up cheep steak.  We used it with grilled chicken breasts and steak and both had fantastic flavor!

Really easy and really good!  Only had time to marinate pork chops for about 45 minutes (poked with fork to help), still great on the grill!

Threw in some crushed pineapple, sliced green onions, minced onion and a little ginger. Used for chicken kabobs and am smitten with the flavor.

Didn't seem to exactly permeate through the chicken after marinading for 3 hours so I will try again but let it sit for longer.  The outside tasted great. Broiled the chicken breasts and then thinly sliced and mixed in with some toasted sesame seeds and asian style noodles, delectable ha.

My husband said it was good, but it was a little bland. The meat marinaded for longer than the desired time, but still didn't seem like it was enough.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe and I followed it to a tee.  It wasn't thick like other teriyaki and when I was cooking my chicken all I could smell was cinnamon.  It smelt like I was baking dessert.  It was too sweet overall, if I ever make this again I am cutting out the cinnamon.  I had high hopes for this one and it doesn't wasn't that good.

Love this marinade. I made it with boneless chicken breasts and almost followed the recipe to a tee. I added an extra tbs. of brown sugar just so it wouldn't be to salty. I also sprinkled some paprika on the top while it marinated. I marinated for 2 hours and cooked on the grill at med-hi heat and served with honey roasted potatoes.

Very nice marinade! I used garlic powder because I just wasn't in the mood to chop garlic. I also added some fresh ground pepper. The pork chops were grilled and came out with a very nice flavor..not overpowering at all like some teriyaki marinades! Will keep this one in my recipe box!

This was fantastic!  Definitely restaurant quality marinade!  Will make with better quality meat next time.  I used a little less brown sugar and half the cinnamon.  I added 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and chopped green onion.  Also added Asian-style vegetable medley and served it over brown rice.  Yummy!!!

Was looking for a quick and easy marinade and decided to try this.  Used my indoor grill pan and the chicken was very juicy and didn't burn as I thought it might because of the brown sugar.  I've also used this marinade for rib eye steak.  The cinnamon adds a subtle flavor that's good but I would recommend using only half or even less of what the recipe calls for.

EXCELLENT RECIPE!!  I marinaded boneless, skinless chicken thighs overnight, and then grilled them on our outdoor gas grill - the result was wonderfully moist and flavorful chicken!  I think the cinnamon is the "Star" of this recipe.  I followed the recipe as it was written, but did add a tablespoon of worchestershire as another reader had suggested.  The result was perfection, and no more buying expensive bottled marinades!  This recipe was made with things I always have on hand - thanks to Joanne for sharing!

This marinade was very good, i actually used it as a base for Terriyaki beef stirfry. I did add a few things to the base though, 1 tbsp of cornstarch, 1 tsp of seasame oil, and doubled the recipe, It came out absolutely perfect. thank you :-)

This was super easy but I did not care for the cinnamon taste. I made it on GF grill and I think the smell was bad in my house - I would try this again but would use ginger. My hubby said it was ok but he did not like the cinnamon taste and thought it was to sweet.

This marinade was good, but not the best of the best.  the biggest problem was a lack of flavor, which would most likely be fixed with more time to marinate.  The flavor that is there is very good, but next time I will put it in marinade in the morning so it has all day to sit.  I also added as per a previous review some ginger and worcestershire sauce that added a lot.

This was super easy. I never measure ingredients, I just "eye ball" it, and this came out great. I added ginger and used Splenda brown sugar, but other than that I made no changes.  I marinated two steaks in one bag and tofu and portabello mushrooms in another: all came out great.

I used this recipe to marinade button-sized mushrooms for six hours before grilling them.  They were wonderful - very juicy and flavorful!  The cinnamon in this recipe was a little strange, but I don't think I will leave it out next time.  I will, however, try adding fresh ginger, as some of you have suggested.

Wow, this was so easy and soooo good. I left out the cinnamon since my dh hates it and added a lot more fresh garlic. We marinated the chicken we used it on for a couple hours and broiled it. I had no idea teriyaki sauce could be so easy!

This was good, but we thought it was a little too salty. Next time I will not use as much soy sauce. I used it with pork chops. I will try it again with chicken.Thankyou!

I didn't really care for this recipe.  The cinnamon gave the chicken an odd aftertaste and I won't make it again.  I followed the ingredients exactly and used the chopped up chicken to make kabobs.  I left the chicken in the marinade for about six hours.  It tasted strong, just not a taste I cared for.  My husband said he really liked it.

This was pretty good and very easy to throw together.  The only thing I'll change next time is letting my chicken marinade in it overnight for better flavor.

WOW!  My family was very impressed with the flavor this gave our chicken thighs last night!  I would suggest grilling it as recommended because cooking it in the oven with the marinade leaves the meat floating in its fat wheras if it had been broiled or grilled, it would have lost most of it.  We will keep this in our repetoir for sure!  (I got an A cooking this in my Food Preparation class ;-))

This was okay, but I don't think I will be adding it to my regular rotation.  I used flank steak, smothering it in onions and mushrooms that I sauteed in the drippings.

I took someone's suggestion of adding 1 T cornstarch to make a lovely thick sauce, but it ended up making a black gloppy mess in my grill pan.

I think I prefer my teriyaki sauces sweeter as opposed to salty, like this one.

This was a tasty marinade. I did decide to use ginger instead of cinnamon. I also suggest marinating overnight. I marinated chicken for about 5 hours, and although it had a nice, mild flavor, I think it would have been stronger if I had marinated it overnight.

I used this marinade for steak.  I marinated it all day and it came out delicious.  One of the first marinades that I have made from scratch that really keeps its taste.  I added a little hot sauce to the mix to kick it up a bit.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I marinated chicken  overnight and they were delicious.  I will no longer use the bottled teriyaki marinade, this is better and uses ingredients I always have on hand.  Only change I made was to replace the cinnamon with ginger, and I'm glad I did.

Delicious! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and marinated them 24 hours then grilled. The only changes I made were: used ginger instead of cinnamon and added a dash of pineapple juice to the marinade.

This was awesome done with pork tenerloin on the grill.  I also used ginger instead of cinnamon.  Maybe if I feel brave, I'll try the cinnamon sometime.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe isn't that good like the other reviewers say it is. The cinnamon should be ignored in this recipe and it'll probably taste a bit better.  But still no one liked it in my family there's better recipes out their, just gotta keep searching.
