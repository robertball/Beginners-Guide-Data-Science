These bars came out very tasty.  The recipe was different but easy enough to follow. The only thing I'll do differently next time is use a smaller baking dish. I think bars will be even tastier.

This was a hit. I used margarine instead of shortening. It was great.

My mom has been making these for years! They are fantastic and remind me of my childhood. The only thing we do differently is omit the nuts.We also like to mix some powdered sugar with a little milk or lemon juice and drizzle the glaze over the bars.... soooo wonderful!

I reduced and changed the sugar to 1/4 c. dark brown sugar, and then added 1/4 c. blackstrap molasses.  I substituted slivered almonds for walnuts.  Next time I probably wouldn't soak the raisins in apple juice.  It reduces their chewiness.
