These were a hit as-is and were really easy to make -- as long as you plan ahead for the cooking time, it's a snap!  Thanks for a great recipe.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that we like a little more seasoning; next time we'll add cayenne pepper (or hot sauce) or maybe some Italian herbs.  Also, I only had 12-oz ramekins, so we ended up with a fairly flat serving -- a circle of ham topped with a "pancake" of egg/spinach -- which turned out PERFECTLY for serving on top of a piece of toast!

These were perfect for a light breakfast.  We love spinach and eggs so it was the perfect combination.  Will definitely make this one again.
