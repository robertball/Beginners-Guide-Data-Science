5 star for taste and ease and this recipe is easily lightened up for less fat and calories.    A very good tasting salad.  I made this once as directed and a second time 'lightened up".  Like most salads all the fat and calories come from the dressing.  So I just lightened up the dressing and voila!  Same great taste and only a fraction of the calories.  Lightened up version -   chicken: I did not use limeade concentrate to coat the chicken.  I just used straight, squeezed lime juice.    dressing:  2 tablespoons of sugar, and only 1/4 c of oil leaving the remaining ingredients for the dressing intact.  Then to compensate for the liquid I removed, I added some lime juice mixed with water.  I blended all ingredients together for a wonderful salad dressing with much less calories.  Just a small drizzle of dressing is all that is needed.  salad:  to save a few more calories, I only used about an 1/8 cup of pecans and crushed them up, then dusted them on top of the salad.    This is a very good recipe as is, but there was not much difference in taste once it was lightened.

Delicious salad! You don't use all the dressing - I had a lot left over. If you don't use all the dressing, you won't have all those calories and fat. It makes me angry to see all these bad reviews by people who didn't make the recipe just because they didn't take the time to carefully read it.  I hope Allrecipes will remove those reviews and put in a comment about the amount of dressing being too much. I plan on making the salad again to use up the dressing I had left.

We loved this! Each component was excellent on its own; put together it was superb! I made it as written, although  instead of using limeade, I simply reduced some lime juice with a pinch of sugar. I chose to halve the dressing, which was perfect for the salad quantity. (If you make the full amount of dressing, it is equally delicious on other salads, of course.) I used organic chicken breasts which were much smaller than the regular grocery store's chicken breasts. Two of us made a meal out of this, & had enough greens leftover for one more serving (i.e., 3 people could make a meal of this). ~ Bravo, Larkspur!

Exceptional!!  Salads aren't normally a mainstay for dinner in our family - but I believe our customs are about to change based on the "delicious-ness" of this salad.  All the components of the salad worked in such perfect harmony.  I've not used raw sugar snap peas before in my meals, so was skeptical, but they were such a perfect complement to the other salad ingredients.  I could literally go on and on about how delicious this was - but I won't. :)  Here are some notes:  (1) I did not have limeade concentrate and would not buy any just to use 3T, so I replaced the concentrate with 2 1/2 Tbsp lime juice, 1/2 Tbsp lemon juice, and 1 1/2 tsp sugar; (2)I halved the dressing recipe.  The conversion turned out well and the amount more than plenty for our needs.  I did not have dried minced onion and prefer the taste of fresh onion, so I used approximately 1/4 cup finely chopped onion in the dressing; (3) I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil; and (4) I mistakenly added all the dressing ingredients in the blender at once, rather than slowly adding in the oil and stirring in the poppy seeds at the end.  I don't know if following the instructions would have made a difference or not, but it saved me time and was absolutely wonderful!  Enjoy!

I love this recipe...I did make one change though which is why I only gave it 4 stars...I put sugar and cinnamon on the pecans and baked them in the oven before adding them to the salad...really made this salad phenominal!

Great as it was written but I also added a thin sliced red onion to give it a "pop".

I really liked this salad.  It is nice to have something different.  It is very fresh and bright tasting.  I did use glazed pecans for the pecans since that is what I had on hand. Next time, I will toast the pecans with a brown sugar, worcestshire, and tabasco glaze.  The spiciness will contrast with the sweetness in this salad very well.  I will aslo add some red onion because I am a red onion fan. I must say that as far as my house goes, I think this recipe is appropriate for a more adult palate.  Three of my four children did not like it, but the youngest one (7 years old) really liked it.

I found the marinade made the chicken a bit sweet so I cut down on the sugar in the dressing.  Not terrible, but also not sure if I would use this particular recipe again.

This is so good! Really an exceptional dish because everything goes so well together. I wanted to make the chicken a little more versatile so my guests could put it on the spinach or on croissants, so after the chicken cooled I chopped it up in the food processor, then incorporated a mixture of lime juice & mayonnaise to moisten it up. It was great!

Awesome salad!! I added mango chunks and rinsed red kidney beans and sugar coated the pecans in a pan before adding to salad. I also used lime juice with a bit of sugar for the chicken breasts. One thing I would do different next time is to add a bit of salt to the chicken because they came out quited bland. Maybe the limade concentrate helps this. Thanks for the great recipe!  It's a keeper!

Too sweet. i even decreased the amt of sugar in the dressing and it was still way too sweet for me. All I could taste was sugar it was worse than eating a candy bar.

Great blend of flavors and easy to make! We regularly eat this salad as a main dish meal. We like to toast the pecans first and sometimes add thin slices of red onion and a sprinkling of crumbled feta cheese.

I used asparagus and mushrooms along with the rest of the hot ingredients. Instead of strawberries I used blueberrys.  I also ran out of cooking oil 1/4 cup and sesame oil. So dont know what the original tasted but this turned out real good!!!

great salad!  I added strawberries to the dressing.  I left out the peas.  I added craisins and mandarin oranges.  Basically, it was this recipe combined with another recipe I took the parts that looked the best to me.  I'm not creative so I need these recipes to get me started!!
