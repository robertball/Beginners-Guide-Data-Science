My family is Czech, so I make these often. I use softened butter instead of shortening. Using bread flour instead of AP makes for a lighter, flakier kolache. After you put the yeast in with the milk you need to let it sit atleast 10 minutes until it starts to foam. Also the milk temp should be close to 110 degrees (2 min in the micro is what it takes for me). Too hot and you kill the yeast, not hot enough it will not activate. Add about 3 cups of flour, form a ball, then take it out of the bowl and work the rest of the flour in on the counter. Add additional flour if necessary, but it should still be a little sticky. The reviewer that said this is a batter did something terribly wrong. This is a bread dough type of consistency. Don't "flatten the balls". Instead take your thumb and index fingers on both hands and push the dough out from the center. This will create a deep well with tall sides so that the filling doesn't ooze out. Then I brush mine with melted butter and fill with about a tablespoon or 2 of cherry pie filling (or whatever you like). I am impatient on the 2nd rise, so I place the kolaches in the oven with it on low (170 degrees) for 20 minutes. That will make the second rise go much faster. Then preheat the oven to 375 and bake for about 15 minutes. Should be light golden.  I get the best results with an airbake cookie sheet. Dark colored ones will burn the bottoms of the Kolache. This recipe makes about 40 kolaches, not 72. I get 12 per cookie sheet.

Kolaces (or Kolaches) are big where I live in Central Texas, due to the large Czech population... and they're one of the many reasons we native Texans are glad so many Czechs call Texas home!  Kolaces are perfect for any occasion - my favorite filling is sweet cream cheese - to DIE for.   This is a great basic recipe!

Awesome kolache recipe...seems like everyone who lives in my area thinks that a kolache is a sausage link wrapped in a bisquit.....do not use anything except for a metal pan...i used glass and a baking stone and it took forever to cook on there....the metal worked the best...if u use the metal pan only bake it for 12 min. otherwise they will burn

This recipe rates up there with the best of kolaches. Something I especially like about this one is the suggestion of leaving the kolache flat with a center indention filled with preserves. They are beautiful served on a tray this way, and you can see what you are getting. My personal preferences are strawberry, apricot, & blackberry, but the choices are limitless! Ummmmm, good!

Just like my grandma used to make! I was trying to find her recipe but was unable to find it since she passed away. Thank you for this recipe. It has brought many happy memories to my family! I used apple, almond, mixed nut, and cherry fillings and then topped it with a powdered sugar icing. Very very good!

These turned out great!  I made them with peach, blueberry, and apricot preserves.  The dough was a little sticky, but a bit of flour on my hands fixed this.  They were so delicious!  Great recipe.

Good basic recipe!  I substituted butter for the shortening and used lemon and apple pie fillings.
I did not flatten them out prior to baking as I wanted a deep "well" for the fillings.  They did puff up quite a bit in the oven!

I made these for my sons Czech Republic project at school.  They had a nice taste and texture.  Not too sweet.  I had to add extra flour though to form a ball.  I have never had these so I was surprised how big they were.  I made exactly what the recipe called for and some where close to 3 inches wide.  Wow!

Fabulous!
This recipe is simple, easy, and not too time consuming, other than waiting for the buns to raise.  My niece (age 4) ate so many of these at Christmas, I thought she would burst! I used apricot, raspberry, and poppy seed fillings.  This is a keeper recipe!!

These were great!!They are like the ones I get at the kolache shop in Houston,Tx. I did these like they do there. I took the dough and spread it out all most square with some flour because the dough is rather sticky and just cut squares with a pizza cutter. For the filling I used comstock pie filling and added the strudsel topping. They were wonderful and my husband raved about them.

These are really good!  I had never had them before so I have nothing to compare them to but my husband loved them also. I made a sweet cream cheese filling (8 oz pkg cream cheese & 1/2 cup powdered sugar) and made 3 different fillings/toppings; just cream cheese, just raspberry preserves and 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 raspberry preserves.  My husband and I both liked the cream cheese/raspberry ones the best.

This is probably the 6th time I've made this recipe and I learn more each time. I now just put all the ingredients in the bowl of my stand mixer(make sure you beat the eggs and yolks first), use milk that is closer to 125 degrees and use the dough hook. It makes the dough more consistent. The dough is still sticky so use gloves. Be sure to brush with shortening.

I tried this recipe because I couldn’t find my usual recipe for kolaches.  I admit I made some minor changes when making this.  Because the yield is considerable, I cut the recipe by a fourth.  I didn’t use shortening but used butter in the mixture for added richness and an egg wash for a beautiful sheen on the kolaches.  The dough was too sticky so I added additional flour to make it more manageable.  I chose peach jam, orange marmalade and cream cheese for the fillings which worked out wonderfully.  While this was a good recipe, it wasn’t quite as good as my usual recipe so I’m back on the hunt to find it.

I made these for my bf who's Czech and has only been in this country for 5 years. I was trying to surprise him so I wouldn't let him in the kitchen while I was making them but as soon as they were done he walks in the kitchen and goes " Kolache!" Needles to say, he devoured them and enjoyed them very much. I also cut in half ( only me and him) and also found that I had to add 3/4 more flour

These are good. To me they taste kind of like a biscuit with jelly on top. It didnt "wow" me, but everyone in my family enjoyed them, especially my father who LOVES raspberry so he ate up all the ones with raspberry preserves.

This is not the kolache I am looking for..this is a batter and the kolaches I enjoy here in Texas are a dough. I made it per recipe and it was not good to me.More of a teacake batter that you had to pour off a spoon, the preserves seeped out the bottom while cooking. A big mess.

Awesome recipe. I have my own variations and use different things. Since fruit preserves can be a little expensive depending on where you are I use pie filling. Apple and Cherry are a big hit in my house. I also do a sweet cream cheese, as well as a sausage and cheese. It is a big hit every time I make them and the recipe can make so many that I have to share them! My neighbors now love kolaches!

Made the recipe this weekend and they were a big hit.  I didn't roll them - just put them on the cookie sheet - about a tablespoon and a half and put the filling in the middle.  They puffed up and after they cooled I made a powdered sugar frosting and drizzled it on them.  I will make them again!  Thanks for the recipe.

I've been experimenting with Kolache or Kolacky recipes for 2 days.  It seems to me this is just a typical sweet dough.  And this is a huge recipe!  I should have down-sized it.  I was overwhelmed with how much dough I ended up with.  The recipe was easy to follow, the dough rose nicely, and was easy to handle.  I filled them with cherry and apricot, and then dusted them with powdered sugar.  They were ok.  Nothing real spectacular.  Kind of like a small danish.  Not real sweet though.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  A friend used to bring in kolaches to work, but never shared her "secret recipe."  So I've been searching for a comparable one.  This one isn't it.  The dough was not light and fluffy and the first batch burned after 12 minutes.  I'll keep looking.

This is a good Kolace recipe but the original ones czechs make -the dough is rolled and and they look like little pigs in a blanket. A lot of Central Texans do not pronounce them right but I am so glad they keep the czech pastries, food and culture alive. This recipe I really like because it is easier than all the rolling.

They tasted great but I wasn't prepared for how large they would get while baking. I had to go back and make the holes larger in the second batch because the fruit was bubbling over. None the less, they tasted great!

This was OK. I was not as crazy about it as others have been. Followed recipe but felt the bread was too "bready", maybe not soft enough for kolaches. I frze some of them and they do freeze well.

This week I have made this recipe twice and I'm working on a third. All the Kolaches were edible but  the first attempt didn't meet my expectations. The Kolaches (1st attempt) were too bready and I followed the recipe to the letter. The second attempt was better but I changed the recipe. Instead of 1/3 cup of sugar I added 1/2 cup; I also mixed the yeast with warm milk (110 degrees) all the required eggs, sugar and salt, stirring just enough to mix and break the eggs but not beating them.  When the yeast dissolved I added the bread flour 1/2 cup at a time. The dough (2nd time) was a little sticky but after I let it rise it was easier to handle. The 2nd attempt was more what I expected. I'm making a 3rd attempt to see if I can make them even more delicate. As a child I remember Kolaches being sweet and delicate we couldn't stop eating them. We were so lucky our neighbor was Czech. I going to keep trying I want my grand children to enjoy the sweet tasty experience too.

These were wonderful! I am too from Iowa and have very strong "Viking" roots. My entire family history comes from Norway and a little from Denmark.

Looking for recipe I tasted on polish village. This recipe didn’t fill that desire for flavor. The dough tastes more like dry biscuit

Would give 5 stars but instructions are poorly written and should say after adding warm milk to yeast to let sit for 10 minutes for yeast to activate. I made as instructions say and didn’t wait, just kept adding ingredients and mixed and the dough didn’t rise well, I ended up making a new batch after reading some reviews of recipe.
