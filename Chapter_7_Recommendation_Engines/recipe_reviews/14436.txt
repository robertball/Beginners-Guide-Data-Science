Well Chloe, you struct the right note with my family! They loved this. I didn't have nectarines so added bananas instead. If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll notice that I have somewhat of a celery fetish......so MY portion contained celery, too. Thanks, we all loved this.

This was a quick and easy recipe that turned out to be very delicious. It is extremely easy to vary the recipe. I added bananas and honey dew. I also sprinkled on some coconut and used vanilla yogurt instead of plain. Great for summer picnics!!

We liked this and I keep ingredients on hand so that I am prepared when I am asked to bring a fruit salad to a gathering. I did add more fruit. I think you could double the fruit and there would be enough "sauce" for all of it.

I had to change up one of the ingredients only because nectarines are hard to find this time of year. I used a large Honey Crisp apple, green seedless grapes and two peaches, as mine were a little on the smaller side. I used greek yogurt as well. Everyone loved this fruit salad, especially me. The orange juice mixed with the yogurt made the perfect "dressing" for the salad. My fruit was all perfectly sweet enough which played off the sour bite and creaminess of the greek yogurt. NO LEFTOVERS.

I mixed plain nonfat yogurt with it.  The orange juice gives it a bit of a sour taste.  I may add just a little Splenda next time.

This is a delicious fruit salad and can have so many variations and combinations of fruit.  I mixed the orange juice and yogurt together along with 2 packets of Splenda and poured over the fruit.

Okay....  Now this is just good.  I took it to a friend's house and she combined the vanilla yogurt with the fruit.  She then used the mixture as a SALAD DRESSING!!  WOW  So good!  Make sure you use a good quality orange juice.

As a muslim family we are observing the fasting month currently and I am always looking for light desserts for the evening. This turned out delicious! I used an orange/mango juice and served with fruit cocktail yoghurt that had it's own fruit chunks. It was divine, thanks for an easy, healthy dessert option :)

This is a great after school snack for the kids...I have my granddaughter, and grandson working together making it.  The fun thing for them is to put the final touch of a dallop of whip cream on top...they ask for this all the time.  You can almost use whatever fruits you have on hand that go TOGETHER. Plus, my holiday tables always have a fruit salad on them especially for the grandkids. :o)

I used mandarin oranges instead of regular and substituted Orange Cream yogurt for the plain since I didn't have either.

I just made this and it is wonderful...the only thing I did different was left off the orange juice, used vanilla low-fat yogurt, added bananna since I didn't have the nectarine and put in a dab of sugar free cool whip.....perfect!!

No idea how I made it aged 43 without having made a fruit salad, but I did. This was the perfect recipe for a newbie and my family loved it. Thanks so much for sharing!
