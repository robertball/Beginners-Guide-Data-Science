The amount of spinach in this scared me at first but this ended up being absolutely fantastic, though I did add two red chilis to the food processor when making the garlic/ginger paste. I ended up using 2 chilis, 3 cloves of garlic, and a 1-inch segment of ginger and just dumping it all in instead of using a teaspoon, and I think that was the right call. Overall, pretty  delicious.
