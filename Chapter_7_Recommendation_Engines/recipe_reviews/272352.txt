I didn't have beer so I used apple juice. It still came out quite tasty and tender.

Made as written and this turned out good. This is almost identical to my own IP corned beef on this site. The only difference is the brown sugar. While I didn't taste the brown sugar, this did set up to a more slice-able beef. Not sure if that was the sugar or the fact I let it rest longer than suggested? Regardless, cook time is spot on. Good recipe!
