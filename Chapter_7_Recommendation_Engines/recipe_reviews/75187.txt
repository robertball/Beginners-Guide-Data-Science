This is very quick to make.   I didn't have any corn and I only had frozen lima beans - but it all worked.   It's comfort food - tastes great.  I cut the recipe in half and it was more than enough for the two of us with some leftovers for lunch.

This was pretty good. I didn't know what to make of it because it is definately not a soup but it does have a stew like consitency. I put it in bowls and served with biscuits and my family really liked it.

Good as is, but better with more seasonings. I added 1/2 t each dry marjoram and tarragon and 1 t minced garlic at the end and they perked up the flavor. I might add more of all three next time or add a couple teaspoons of dry dill instead. 

Frozen limas worked well; I eliminated the initial 15 minutes of simmering of the limas by themselves.

I actually made this in the slow cooker for 9 hours on slow. I followed the recipe exactly as described.  I added the milk and cornstarch during the last 30 minutes. Great recipes. The whole family loved it. I will be making again soon.

Cooking as I type. Had a ham steak that I needed to use .  It was 1 pound, so I diced up about half of it. Had only frozen baby beans.  Rather than fresh tomatoes, I'm using a can of diced.   Added 3 cloves of minced garlic. Everything is in the pot now except the cornstarch and ham.  Using coarse freshly ground pepper.  Tastes great so far.  Update to follow. Thanks for the recipe!  Update:  turned out great!  Made a lot, so I'll be freezing some.  Very hearty.

A great meal for a chilly, rainy day.  I serve this with cornbread.  My husband loves those big lima beans!  I start with dried lima beans, soak and cook them, then follow recipe.  Very flexible, add more seasonings if you wish, or enjoy the simple goodness of this homey recipe!

I have never cooked Lima beans freshly picked before now! These were fresh from the farm and I made the recipe exactly as described. My husband loved them and so did I. This is definitely a keeper for us!

Ended up throwing it away. Takes way longer than recipe called for to get Lima beans done. Ended up burning. Nothing about this recipe worked out.

This recipe turned out delicious! I did make some modifications that I thought kicked up the flavors, like substituting chicken stock for water, and some cream cheese instead of milk, as a reviewer suggested. I also add marjoram, and used halved grape tomatoes, and no corn, and since this was going to be an entree for us, I used about a pound and a half of smoked ham from a ham roast and used frozen lima beans. Sauteeing all the veggies first in some smoked bacon fat added nice carmelized flavors. I will definitely make this again!

I used frozen baby limas since I couldnt find any fresh ones, and substituted chopped green bell pepper for the celery.  Also added 1/2 cup of white wine and the ham in with the veggies so everything could absorb the ham flavor.  Cooked it all for 2 hours.  Yum.  My husband always said he hates lima beans, but wants to have this recipe on a regular basis.
Addendum-can also skip the ham and serve this as a side dish to a baked ham.  Then make soup with hambone and leftovers.

This was very quick and yummy. I used frozen beans, omitted the corn and tomato, added a little jalapeño and cayenne, and used chopped green onions instead of parsley as a garnish. Perhaps most importantly, I replaced the milk and cornstarch mixture with a couple ounces of low fat cream cheese.
