Great!  Use two cups of each of the cheeses and put pretzels on top of the soup as a garnish.

I made this soup tonight and had been thinking about this recipe all week.  It was still runny after I added extra flour and let it simmer for almost 30 min.  I used extra cheese to thicken it up.. 2 cups of somked gouda and 2 cups of chedar.  I am hopeing it thickens up over the night for tomorow.  Tasted good but I just didnt like the texture.

I was so sad about this recipe! I thought it had very little flavor and I even increased each cheese to 2 cups as other reviewers suggested.  It was floavorless & thin.  Nothing like other Beer and Gouda Soups I have had.  I don't think there is anyway to save this recipe.

I really wanted to love this soup ... but it turned out thin and not too flavorful.  I added extra cheese, bacon, and more seasonings but wasn't too impressed with the final result.  Maybe a stout beer would work better?  Won't bother with this one again.

This is SUPER tasty & a huge crowd pleaser that includes kiddos! I try not to modify recipes out of respect for the creator. However, I did one modification. I made the roux first because it made for a thicker soup than compared to the first time I made it. Super yummy!

I blend the soup in the vitamix so that the onions aren't present. My kids don't like the texture if it isn't smooth (before adding cheese). I made more rue with a full stick of butter and 3/4 c of flour as the first time never really thickened. I would use smoked gouda (I got from costco) and don't skimp on the cheddar (get 3yr aged or better), for the best flavor. Next time we'll use a better beer (barrel aged or hoppy we think will add to the complexion)

Great recipe! Like others, I used 2 cups of each cheese, but for extra thickness I also doubled the roux. I also opted to add smoked paprika to the garnish. Absolutely delicious!

This was very gouda! ;-) Recommend using whole milk and be sure to reduce this quite a bit before adding the cheese. I'm not sure how long it took but it was probably close to 30 minutes; it's ready for the cheese when the soup coats the back of the spoon and holds it's shape after running your finger through; well worth the time! Served with home made bread, buttered and toasted.

Added twice the cheese to get a good consistency and texture.
