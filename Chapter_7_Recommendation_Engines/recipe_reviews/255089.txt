Delicious! I could not find whole wheat pastry flour, so I searched the web and found to substitute 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 cake flour, which worked out perfectly! I cut mine out into heart shapes, and the family loved them. They really do have just the right amount of sweetness. I do think next time I will add more cranberries and pecans, though, b/c I was wanting more of both of those in there, lol. I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Yum!  Nice and crusty on the outside.  I made mine lemon-cran instead of pecan-cran, and sprinkled some coarse sugar on top.

I made these today. I couldn't find the pastry flour, so I used ground whole wheat flour and it worked perfectly. My husband loves them, and our son is picking some up later.
