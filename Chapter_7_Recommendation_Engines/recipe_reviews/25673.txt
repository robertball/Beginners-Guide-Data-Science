What caught my eye about this recipe was the minimal ingredients and total ease of preparation.  Well, we all know that what is worth keeping, is worth working for.  Ground beef has no place in a stew and no amount of pepper, chili sauce or spices can save this dish.  I'm sorry, but we did not care for this.

This is a tasty oven casserole made with ground beef without browning. I scaled for four servings and will serve two with a nice meal to reheat.

A bit bland and I even added garlic, salt, and pepper and still it was lacking. I did love that this could be popped into then oven and didn't need my constant stirring though.

It's a good base but you've really got to add some flavour. I added bay leaves, thyme, salt, pepper, and Lowrey's in addition to some green beans. I boiled the green beans in tomato juice, salt and pepper until it was cooked then added all the veggies and let it simmer for an hour or so. It's pretty tasty with the flavor enchancements, I am having it with toast right now :)

This recipe makes a very bland stew, as previously stated. I used it as a guideline however, & improved upon it tenfold! I added a can of corn, a can of green beans, & 2 handfuls of fresh green beans, trimmed & snapped. I put an even layer of garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, salt, Tony's, & Lawry's across the top & I added 1 can of Campbell's tomato soup, 2 tbs of minced garlic, & an extra carrot, along w/about 1/4 of an onion, chopped very fine. I only put 2 potatoes, because 4 was too much. I also cooked it on the stove instead of in the oven, bringing it to a boil & then letting it simmer until all the veggies were tender & the meat was fully cooked. It was FANTASTIC. If I could figure out how to add a recipe, I'd add this one for sure!
