I have been making Lemon Meringue pies for many years, trying different recipes, following the "directions" to top the pie with meringue when the filling was hot...and you know what? Topping the pie when it's hot is the WORST possible suggestion EVER!!!!  It will always weep if you do this...ALWAYS. FINALLY I figured out a fool proof way to get the meringue NOT to weep: Allow the filling to cool at room temperature until completely cooled and firm.  And NEVER put the pie in the fridge.  Once it's cooled, make your meringue.  Be sure to have the meringue cover the pie to the crust completely and then place it in the oven at 350 degrees (immediately) for 10-15 minutes or until the meringue is brown (careful, keep a close eye on it, because the meringue can go from "brown" to "black" very quickly--especially if you are someone who likes to have "peaks" in your meringue.)  Now, once the pie comes out of the oven let it cool completely at ROOM TEMPERATURE...NEVER place a Lemon Meringue Pie in the fridge UNLESS you want it to weep and get all watery.  I don't know where this urban legend about covering a hot filling with meringue started, but it's WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!!!!!

Excellent flavor; I also used slightly less sugar than the recipe states for a little more intense lemon flavor.  I don't think I'd made a lemon meringue pie before and I was extremely pleased with the way this one turned out; I will definitely use this recipe again!

Some notes to prevent shrinkage of the meringue and "weeping" (extra moisture under the meringue.  (These tips are from a section on preparing meringue in one of my cookbooks.)  Don't let the lemon filling cool too much; instead of putting it in the refrigerator til lukewarm, after preparing it make the meringue and spoon the designated amount of meringue into the hot/very warm lemon mixture.  Spoon the filling into the baked pie crust, and cover with the remaining meringue while still very warm.  Make sure to spread the meringue well, to the edges, touching the crusts.  These steps should prevent the meringue from shrinking away from the crust and getting soggy underneath!

This was delicious!  As a previous reviewer stated about meringue, don't follow the directions to let the lemon custard cool before putting on the meringue.  To achieve a perfect seal, you must add meringue while the filling is still warm.  Use the "Meringue II" recipe from this site -- it's a perfect meringue recipe.  Everyone who ate this wanted a second piece.  The consistency was awesome.

This pie was amazing!  I actually have a ponderosa lemon tree (it gets lemons the size of grapefruits) and my first lemon was ripe.  I wanted to make something using it and found this recipe.  Everything turned out perfectly, I did add a small bit more of the cornstarch as suggested in other reviews, and if I would change anything, I would put a cup of sugar, instead of a cup and a half, in the filling mixture.  It came out a bit sweet.  But I would definitely recommend this recipe otherwise as it is....it turned out great, and I WILL be making this again!

Look no further for an awesome Lemon Merangue Pie.  I read the reviews before I made this, but decided not to alter the original recipe at all and it turned out wonderful!  My husband liked it, too!

This waS VERY GOOD, HOWEVER I EXPERIENCED SOME OF THE SAME PROBLEMS AS FAR AS THE RUNNYNESS(IS THAT A WORD?) ANYWAY, DESPITE THAT IT WAS REALLY GOOD. tHE SECOND TIME I MADE IT I LET THE FILLING COOL COMPLETELY HOPING THIS WOULD CREATE LESS "JUICE" IF YOU WILL AND IT DID BUT IT WASNT AS FIRM AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED, I THINK I'LL ADD A LITTLE MORE CORNSTARCH NEXT TIME. oVERALL THE TASTE WAS EXCELLENT!

Everyone at my work said this was a wonderful restaurant tasting pie. The only problem I had was were it says mix cornstarch and 1/3 cup water to make a smooth paste. There was no such thing as a smooth paste with 1/2 cup cornstarch and 1/3 cup water, it was concrete so I just added some of the boiling sugar/water mixture to try and make it a smooth paste. I did add a little yellow food coloring for the color. I will definitely make this again.

I made this over the weekend for my daughters' best friends birthday, as it's her favorite. I took MARIAHAN'S advice and did not cool the sugar mixture before adding the rest of the ingredients. I had no separation problems and the texture was perfect. Not rubbery or chalky. I did need to add two extra egg whites as there didn't seem to be enough meringue for the top of the pie. I like my meringue pies high and "peaky". I also cut back on the sugar a bit and added more lemon juice. My only slight problem was when I cut into it. There was a small amount of liquid on the pie plate, just under the crust. I don't know if this is a typical or if it was because the pie had to travel 45 minutes to it's final destination. It was still somewhat warm when we left the house. Other than that, everyone absolutely loved it. Thanks Rhonda!

This was my 1st lemon meringue pie in 25yrs. The recipe was easy and my pie turned out beautiful. This pie is so good that I could eat the whole thing. My family loved it.

Made this pie with my twelve year old niece... recipe was pretty easy to follow even though I was completely intimidated.  All of the lemon meringue connoisseurs were LOVING this pie.  A little too tart for my niece, but we're pretty sure her taste was spoiled by "fake" lemon meringue pie.  We decided to try this again without the zest and see if she would like it more.  I have never liked the lemon part of Lemon Meringue, but tried this and was amazed at how delicious it was!

So, I make a lemon meringue pie every year for my husband's birthday.  This year I was looking for a slightly different twist to the old lemon meringue pie and when I found this one I had to try it.  Well, it was wonderful and the hubby loved it!  In my opinion, the filling comes out to be almost a cream like one and was just wonderful.  And just as a side note, while making the filling you may question the sugar quantity, but in the end once you add the meringue to it the sweetness is all balanced out.  This recipe is definitely now a favorite in our house and will be made again for birthdays to come!

The first time I made this pie the filling tasted like eggs because I didn't really know how long to cook the sugar/cornstarch/water mixture after tempering in the egg. The recipe just said to let it come to a boil again after incorporating all the egg. I had to throw the whole pie away. On my second try, I cooked the mixture over low/medium heat while constantly stirring for almost 10 minutes. And it got this very tart, lemony sweet flavor to it with a perfect consistency. The meringue wept a bit on both tries. But it was minimal and the 2nd pie was a hit. And now I know how to make a lemon meringue. Thanks.

This pie was very good. The one suggestion I would make is to add sugar to meringue last, it will help it stand in peaks quicker!

First time I made this is was delicious but didn't set up well.  I will use more cornstarch next time 3/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup.  Also like more meringue on top so I'll use 8 egg whites instead of 4. Loved the flavor.

Our family swooned over this pie at Memorial Day, calling it the best lemon pie ever.  It's not hard to make--I had always been intimidated by lemon meringue, but if you read the recipe through, follow the directions, and get your things together before you start, and you'll do fine.  Remember to cool the filling and the crust before you put them together--that way your crust won't get soggy.

I have not made a lemon pie in years.  My sister-in-law is the lemon pie maker but this beat any of hers and I was so proud to serve it!  The Meringue turned out beautiful and did not shrink at all.

Followed this recipe TO THE LETTER. Was rewarded with a gloopy, gloppy lemon Thanksgiving soup! Had some misgivings about folding some of the meringue into the filling and I wonder if this is where this recipe failed for us. Wasted perfectly good Meyer lemons from my little tree. Will not be making this again.

This recipe is not tart enough for my taste. I reduced the sugar to 1-1/4 cups, and substituted 1/2 cup lemon juice for the 1/3 cup water when mixing with the corn starch. I also added a 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar to the meringue to stabilize it.

I just made this for the first time.  I have not had a homemade lemon meringue pie since my Grams passed away.  I've asked people to make me one and they always tell me it's too hard.  Well I will tell you what I am NOT a baker by any stretch of the imagination but I followed the recipe as written and was surprised how EASY it really is. The meringue turned out AWESOME!!!! And the filling tastes just like Gram's....just waiting for this fool to cool down so I can dive in....this one's for you Grandma, miss ya!

Makes an excellent lemon meringue pie.  I never thought I would be able to make a tasty lemon meringue pie entirely from scratch, but with this recipe I can.  It is the perfect blend of sweet and tart.

A wonderful dessert.  I followed the advice of previous posters & did not cool the filling in the refrigerator prior to assembling the pie.  I also added a little extra lemon juice so it was extra-tangy.  My dad pronounced it "Perfect!"

Excellent recipe.  I also did not refrigerate the filling and had no trouble with the meringue.    I only made one minor change - only because I like a high top meringue - I simply added two additional egg whites before beating.  The extra egg whites will give you more than enough for a beautiful Meringue top with lots of peaks!  I had never made a Lemon Meringue Pie where part of the meringue was added to the filling,  It was wonderful and added more volume to fill a 9" pie crust perfectly.  I have never had so many compliments on a pie - Well worth the effort.  I will make this again and again!

This is a good recipe! I only gave 4 stars because I didn't add the extra 1/3 cup of water which would indicate why other reviewers had to add more cornstarch. I reduced the sugar as my personal preference and added 1/4 tsp. cream of tartar to the egg whites. I also spread the meringue on the filling when it's still very warm to cook the bottom. Other than my personal changes, this recipe is better than most! I would recommend watching the video of How To Make Lemon Meringue Pie for anyone who's confused. It really helps!

This was great. When it says gradually add corn starch mixture, do it slowly.  The corn starch hardened into clumps and I had to re-do it!

My first meringue ever and it was perfect! I like the tart lemon taste so I cut the sugar down to 1 cup--perfect!! It was before bedtime but I couldn't resist, I had to get another piece! Look no further-this is the one!

This recipe is very tasty and the custard part held together much better than other recipes I have used.   The portions were generous and I ended up with filling for 1.5 pies, so ended up making a small second pie for my guests to take home.

I tried this recipe and the filling was very good.  However, when you refrigerate this pie, it separates and is watery. If I did something wrong, please let me know. My daughter likes the filing and ate it right from the pot.

Absolutely delicious.  The only change I did was keeping the meringue out of the lemon filling. I used it all on top of the pie. I prefer to have a lot of meringue & did not miss any in the filling, otherwise, everything was the same.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Have to admit I didn't add quite as much meringue to the lemon filling as instructed, and it came out wonderfully. Flavor, texture, everything perfect. Would make this again in a heartbeat!

I have tried many Lemon Meringue Pie recipes and always find them to be too eggy, too sweet, or not lemony enough.  This pie was PERFECT!

Delicious filling! H/e, as many have said, the meringue didn't come out great @ all. It refused to peak, but it did taste good. Next time I'll use a meringue recipe that includes cream of tartar to create peaks.

The filling was good but tart. 1/2 a cup of lemon juice is too tart for my taste. Next time I will reduce to 1/3 of cup and dilute with water. I also used another recipe for the meringue. It is called Meringue II.

Amazing pie! This was my first attempt at a lemon meringue pie and eryone loved it! *I* thought it may need a little bit more lemon juice, but nobody else agreed with me. I did add about 1/2 tsp. of cream of tartar to the egg whites when they were whipping just because I didn't want to have any issues with the meringue not staying puffy. But this recipe definitely gets 2 thumbs up!

Made a pie for my Dad for Father's Day, and this was my first time making a lemon meringue pie.  I decided to use this recipe since there were so many raving reviews.  Each one of those rave reviewers was absolutely correct!  My pie came out beautifully, was sooo delicious, and my Dad loved it!  The only change I made was in using a little less sugar in the lemon filling.  Thank you, Rhonda, for the recipe!

I loved this pie, Was enough filling for 1 small pirex dish pie and enough for 2 little containers for pudding for lunch, so plenty for a regular pie, 9" size.  I wish I read other reviews sooner, would have cut back maybe 1/4 C sugar on filling, next time, have made lemon meringue pie many times and never heard of stirring in egg whites into the filling, what a great idea, also, in reviews they say prevent weeping by cooling filling before putting topping on, I agree, again, I should have read reviews first, but I agree with that. But pie was delish, high, and pretty. I made a crisco crust and had enough left for a small pie shell that I froze, so I used that, but a store bought crust would work nicely as well, less work and mess.  I would make this again. One large lemon grated was plenty to add, need not measure that part, but I did measure the lemon juice. Just lovin those 5 star recipes.

This is a REALLY delicious pie!!  I only thing I had trouble with is when I mixed the cornstarch mixture into the sugar mixture, I had all these cornstarch balls which I never took out...ooops!  So when I ate the pie I had all these jelly like balls..kind of gross but it did taste wonderful!  I probably should of SLOWLY poured the mixture little by little, mixing it well before the next addition...oh well, I'll try that next time!

I'm very new to baking and found this recipe to be easy and yummy!! I'd never made a Lemon Meringue pie before. The only thing I did differently was I didn't put the filling in the fridge to cool, I set it aside while I made the meringue. This is a great recipe for beginners like me, don't be afraid of it like I was.

I found the pie to be lip smacking and have had so many compliments every time I make it.  The only advice I can give is to add 3 - 4 drops of lemon juice to the meringue before spooning over the filling and baking.  It keeps the meringue from collapsing afterwards.  Great recipe!

First time baking Lemon Meringue Pie,
Tried this on Wednesday. Boyfriend loved it. Read comments and agree with the loosness of filling. Baked another one today(Friday)and used more cornstarch. Also used 6 egg whites for meringue. I like things over the top. I will be ready to wow friends on Thanksgiving day.

I made this meringue following the recipe exactly and after 20 minutes of beating, it sill wouldn't form stiff peaks. I  called my sister-in-law. She told me the eggs have to be room temp. and instead of 1/4 t. salt, use 1/4 cream of tarter. My Second and third pies turned out fantastic. The pie was wonderful and the meringue was tall firm peaks after 5 mins. of beating.

Great !!!! Easy to make and even easier to eat ;-)
Will double the meringue next time - it was enough to cover the filling, but the layer wasn't thick enough for me.....
Another keeper - thanks.

Greatly simplified construction technique, much simpler than most traditional lemon meringue pies.  The filling was not as lemony as I like.

Texture is a little more rubbery than I would prefer, with a slightly chalky aftertaste.  I would try increasing the lemon juice and possibly reducing the cornstarch somewhat.  For a smoother texture, I'd like to cook the cornstarch mixture a little more, but that would involve a double boiler and take away from the simplicity of the recipe.

A beautiful pie, the lemon filling is much less stodgy than other recipes I have tried and is very fresh tasting. I will stick with this one and stop my search for the best pie.

I actually followed this recipe exactly when it came to ingredients except I used 3/4 cup of cornstarch.  However,  I did let the lemon mixture chill completely before adding  the meringue to it. Then continued as the recipe stated. This pie surprised me because my lemon mixture almost looked lumpy from the cornstarch but tasted amazing. But after I cooked it and served a slice the texture was amazing. I used my own crust recipe I got from this site it's Ruth's crust. Absolutely a must!!! The crust wasn't the best presentation but it was my fault but the end flavor was on point and even past my expectations.  Fantastic.

Just made two for our chruch bake sale.  Custard tasted great before adding the meringue and even better with it.  Sweet and tart tasting.  I must have purchased shallow pie crusts, because I had over 1 1/2 cups of the custard left over.  Using a box of premaded tartlet shells, I made a dozen more mini lemon merinque pie tartlets.  
Made the Lemnon Merinque Pie II on this web-site last week for a birthday pie gift.  Very unhappy with that recipe and it's results. 
Lemon Merinque III is the perfect recipe for a lemon reminque pie in my opinion.

My Dad told me the only thing he wanted for a Christmas treat was a lemon meringue pie made completely from scratch like my grandmother made when he was a child, so I found this recipe. I read the reviews on it, and as most people did, I only used a cup of sugar as opposed to the cup and a half it calls for. I put the meringue on while the custard was still hot and let it set on my counter to slowly cool. I experienced NO weeping, and when I cut into the pie, once it was completely cooled to room temperature, it wasn't watery at all. This was absolutely amazing. I put a bit of the lemon zest in the meringue as well as my Grandmother used to make hers like that, and my Dad said it was pretty darn close, but Grandmother's was a tad bit sweeter, so next time I will do 1 1/4 cup of sugar. Over all, this recipe was amazing and I am SO thankful I could put a smile on my Dad's face and know that one bite took him back to memories of his childhood. Thank you to the Author!!

This really should be called THE BEST EVER lemon meringue pie! I find lemon meringue pies a bit intimidating to make, but this was really easy and delicious!  It is the only LMP recipe I will ever use.

This was my first go at making a lemon meringue pie.  It turned out very runny and the filling was a pudding rather than the more clear gelatin I was expecting.  Regardless, it got eaten up at Thanksgiving, nobody seemed to mind that it ran into the other pie they had on their plates a bit ;)

This is the best Lemon Meringue Pie I've ever eaten. After acknowledging the controversy regarding the directions, I decided to make the pie exactly according to the recipe. I may have put a little too much of the meringue into the lemon mixture (I didn't actually measure the 3/4 cup it called for), but it still came out perfect.

Success the first time!  Made this pie today for the first time and it turned out perfectly.  I combined the sugar, water, And cornstarch paste (added a little extra cornstrach), mixed well, stirring constantly brought the mixture to a boil.  This way I was able to avoid any lumps.  Very good recipe, will make again.

great pie! It was my first time making meringue, and it came out great. It does take some multi-tasking and prep work (mixing the cornstarch before starting to make the filling helps, etc.) since timing is everything.

This was the first meringue I have made, and it turned out excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Two things that would have been helpful to me....when it says to heat and stir until thick and clear...a newby like me wondered how clear is clear...mine looked like clear caulking.  The other thing was the meringue beating to stiff peaks...literally, the peaks would stand up on their own, you don't have to force them.  However, if you don't beat them quite long enough the meringue will still be okay, it just won't fluff up as high.  This was a beautiful, delicious pie.

Great recipe.  Make sure the crust and filling are at room temperature before you put the meringue on, or you will get the "weeping effect".  Still tastes great, though.

Superb! An instant favorite!!  I followed the directions as is except for decreasing the amount of sugar and adding one more egg white for the meringue.  It turned out fantastic!  I did have a bit of trouble with a little bit of liquid under the crust on the bottom but over all it turned out great!  My grandparents LOVED it and I will definitely be making this pie again.  Thanks!!

I made this last night, had never made a meringue (or quite possibly a pie) in my life.  This was easy, the directions were easy to follow and the pie couldn't have come out better.  Well, that's not entirely true.  I didn't have fresh lemon peel so I had to use dried...apparently they had been sitting next to cloves too long and the lemon filling has a spiced clove taste now.  But, that is of no fault to the recipe.  I am making another one tonight with fresh lemon peel.  Also, I had no idea how long to beat the eggs to make a meringue, it took quite a while but I couldn't believe that I actually made a stiff meringue!

I have never made an easier, more delicious lemon pie in all my baking years!  I only had yolks left over from a white cake, so did not make the topping.  But it was devine with whipped cream.  This will be the only lemon pie recipe in my recipe box.

Absolutely perfect! I added a little more lemon juice and zest. It took just over 20mins for the meringue to brown evenly. One of the best LMPs I have ever tasted. Thanks so much, Rhonda!

The best!! The filling set up beautifully-perfect texture, not all all runny or too stiff. Plenty of meringue, too. I did cut down the sugar by 1/4 cup because we like a tart lemon pie and it was perfect.

I've made lemon meringue pies for years from the recipe on the back of the corn starch box, with varied success. However I was really pleased with the extra touches in this pie and it turned out beautifully. I have to say beautiful because we didn't cut into it at the party I took it to so I didn't taste it once it was assembled! But it looked good and the custard was good when I sampled it during cooking. I liked this method of creating the custard more than the "throw everything in the pot and boil" version, it's harder to mess up or burn this way. Only change is that since you add some of the meringue to the custard, it doesn't leave much for the top, so I'd use 5 egg whites instead of 4. I also use a graham cracker crust, which is how my mom has always made it.

As this was my first attempt and this is my fiance's favorite dessert, I did do a bit of research.  For preference, I used only one cup of sugar and 3/4 of a cup of lemon juice and extra lemon zest. I found that it was very important to let the filling cool to room tempurature prior to topping with meringue and then cool again before putting it in the refridgerator.
This was excellent, deliciously tart and my fiance says that he has never had better.

This is a great tasting pie. I only made a few adjustments. Instead on 11/2 cup of sugar I used 1 cup, I doubled the lemon juice,lemon zest and substituted cream of tartar in the meringue. Fantastic pie!

I have ALWAYS been afraid of making meringe but I have to perfect a lemon meringue pie for my mom by Thanksgiving. This one was very yummy (had the make your mouth pucker factor!) and the meringue was great.  I might have been able to whip it longer but was afraid to.

Great flavor.  Using anothers review, used brown sugar when I ran out of white.  This turned the filling brown--not very attractive.  Used half the sugar, and the flavor was great. Meringue did not seal and then read later that the filling needs to be hot.  This is important!  Overall, great flavor.

I have made this recipe twice for my boyfriend, and he LOVED it both times. It is his favorite kind of pie. He hid it from his roommates ;-)

The meringue is wonderful, turns a lovely smores golden brown at the peaks. The filling is also great, just make sure you keep stirring it so you don't scald bits of it like I did on my first try.

If you follow the recipe and keep a careful eye while making/baking it, it will turn out perfect!

My husband actually made this pie. He has probably made 3 things in his life, and although it was harder for him, he did a great job.  It tasted Great!

I made this pie, and though I liked the flavor, the  filling was watery and didn't hold. I'm not sure why this happened. I used my mother's electric stove and maybe the temperature of 325 wasn't sufficient, or maybe I should have followed the advice of some reviews; not to refrigerate the filling.

I will try this again in my own home to see.

Very lemony, but a tad too sweet for me.  Next time, I will cut the sugar a little.  Very nice consistancy.

Absolutely perfect.  Added whip cream instead of meringue ( can't stand that stuff). Have been craving a lemon pie for months and this just hit the spot. Am keeping this recipe.

My boyfriend loves lemon merengue pie but had not had it home made yet. I looked up the recipe and came out amazing. My only problem is that when I cut into it, it falls apart and I really wish it wouldn't. It may be something I'm doing wrong but it doesn't matter because it's delicious

Works out perfectly! You might want to add more lemon juice and/or rind if you like strong lemon taste. I added 2 small limes (juice and rind) and used less sugar to make the lemon custard. This increased the contrast with the sweet meringue crust....yummie!

Awesome!!!!! Very temperamental tricky little pie to make! But I got it perfect on the third go around! lolol It's a great recipe if you can figure everything out right. Like room temp egg whites for the meringue.Use cream of tartar in meringue as well.Cool water when mixing cornstarch slowly with a fork.Add it slowly while stirring into hot sugar mixture. I didn't put it on high heat either.Just enough heat to bring to a soft boil.Then adding all the other ingredients and mixed well on soft boil until well blended.Removed from heat and chilled in fridge to luke warm.Just some things I learned along the way.??

This pie was delicious following the recipe exactly as is.  I think it is important to cook the sugar/cornstarch mixture till clear and the filling must be allowed to cool before adding meringue.  If you do that I don't see any reason to change the ingrediants or their quantities.  The filling was perfect-tart and sweet but not too much of either.  My boyfriend loved it so much he had it for breakfast today.  Thank you for posting this recipe!  Next time I have to bring a dessert I am bringing this pie.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was okay..It was a little too sweet for me. I messed up the meringue, though that was my own fault not the recipe. Overall this recipe tasted a bit like lemon bars. I will probably find another lemon meringue pie recipe next time I want some.

First time trying to make a meringue, but it turned out well! I followed the advice of not putting the pie in the fridge at all, but found it was a little watery. I don't know what exactly went wrong, but it was still a big hit with the family. I'll probably try it again!

Great recipe! I use it every year. Just don't make it in a hurry and rush the cooling down of the pie and certainly don't cool it in the fridge. It will get soggy if you do.

Great recipe but my lemon curd always comes out too soft.  Since I usually make two batch and double up the recipe, could this be affecting the consistency of the curd.

This pie turned out great.  My first time making lemon meringue and loved it!  I used gram crumb instead of a regular pie crust, the sides got a bit soft but was still full of lemony goodness. Will for sure make this pie again.

My first lemon meringue. I should have let the base sit or cool longer (i am guessing, i did about 15 on counter) because the the bottom came our runny. I did not use the fridge after the previous freak out but i think I think it might have helped.  Would love some input because it still tasted great. Overall the flavors worked perfect and people finished it just need some help on timing and texture.

This pie was extremly difficult to make, it took two of us to watch everything, and even then we were floundering. And with all our effort, we did not care for this. There should at least be a warning on here.

A wonderful recipe for filling! It is definately worth making it this way vs. the lemon Jell-o recipe.  I added a lot of extra lemon zest to make it very tasty!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Ooooh My Goooodness!!! I have 3 words to say...Fan-tas-tic!!! I can't tell you enough how PERFECT this pie turned out. I'm just in all. My grandmother loves Lemon Meringue Pie and I made it for her 83rd birthday and you know what...she cried and said it was the best she ever tasted. Thank you for sharing your recipe and I will pass it on to everyone I know.

I have made this for my boyfriend twice now. He loves it and it's one of his favorites. Make sure you take the time to mix the meringue though or it turns into a sticky mess.

This was my third attempt at pie, my first at Lemon Meringue.  The recipe was nice and easy, although it didn't produce a lot of the meringue topping.  It did come out tasting wonderful though!  I'll definitely be making it again!

I've made this pie three times in the last week after reading ALL the reviews.  The only thing I didn't do was mix the meringue with the actual lemon filling.  The only thing the original poster leaves out is that you MUST MUST MUST get a really good seal between the lemon and meringue layers.  Get that meringue all the way over the crust.  It is a really tasty pretty pie!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I followed the directions exactly.  I didn't change a thing, and it turned out beautifully!  Best meringue pie I've ever had, and it was actually a lot easier to make than I thought it would be.

I made this pie on Saturday for Easter Sunday with family.  As I was making it I almost chucked the entire thing because when I added the cornstarch mixture to the sugar mix a lot of my cornstarch went lumpy.  Needless to say, I was not impressed but I trodded along, picking out the larger white lumps.  I followed the recipe exactly, adding 1/4 tsp lemon extract (which it probably didn't need).  I let the filling cool completely at room temp before putting it in the pie shell.  Then I made the meringue which turned out lovely.  It made a lot of meringue but I used it all, spreading it over the entire pie, including the crust (as some reviewers suggested).  I  did not put the pie in the fridge at all.  It did not weep and was very tasty - full of nice lemon flavour.  I was glad I persevered instead of tossing it.  Oh, yes, I forgot to add some of the meringue to the filling but it didn't really seem to matter.  Thanks for a lovely addition to our Easter desserts.

This was my first lemon meringue pie, so I have to give it 5 stars for coming out so great for a novice.    Read reviews beforehand and did reduce sugar from 1.5 cups to 1.25, but next time would cut back to 1 cup.  I have a sweet tooth, but prefer desserts on the moderately-sweet side.    I also added more lemon - and it turned out great.

Tasted nice, and easy to make. Minor complaints: Could use more meringue topping, and was hoping the fillng would set more. But otherwise, incredible recipe!

ok, so...I love lemon but meringue not so much. I did the recipe as instructed, no changes. I put them in small tartlets, I put the meringue on all except mine...EVERYONE loved it. The meringue didn't weep,i've done it before and it did...I don't know what the difference was,if someone figures it out please post :)it's a keeper!

I tried to make this pie from a BH&G cookbook and every time it was a flop! I found this recipe and wow! It was wonderful! It looked right, tasted right and was super easy. I paired it with the meringuell recipe by suggestion and I love it 5 stars!

Great taste and look and a lot easier than I thought it would be. I would have given it a five if my cooking skills were better because this was my fist time making it and I did get the watery/weeping that some had mentioned. I would pass this recipe along if anyone asked.

Very yummy, but doesn't keep very long so make sure you eat it within 24 hours because it starts to prespire. Also, if you have never made meringue before, make sure you use room temperature eggs and possibly look up directions beforehand, because my first time making this i made that mistake!

This made the best lemon filling I have ever made. It was very thick and had just the right amount of tartness. The way the recipe is written also cuts down on the possiblity of cooking your eggs yolks in the hot mixture and ending up with bits of egg in the filling. I did not mix the meringue and the filling at the end - I just put all the meringue on top as I prefer a traditional pie. I also cut back on the sugar (as per the other reviewers) and used 1 1/4 cup. All in all, a great lemon meringue pie!

Very good and very easy!! I made it for my mother  (with her guidance!) who has been a pie baker for over 60 years and she highly approved! Her suggestion for the meringue was to make sure the edges were 'sealed' with the crust before baking. I also increased the amount of lemon juice without problems since the cornstarch mixture was very thick

Liked the end part of the recipe about how to cook the meringue. TO BE HONEST I LOVE WHEN MY MERINGUE WEEPS. I THINK IT LOOKS VERY PRETTY. I HAVE LIKED IT THAT WAY SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL MANY YEARS AGO. I AM ALWAYS A BIT SAD WHEN MY MERINGUE DOES NOT WEEP :) JUST A THOUGHT

The lemon flavor was excellent. The only issue I have is I find the pie is weeping or so I'm told that is the term. Does anyone have a cure for this or does yours do this? Other than that, I will make this pie over and over.

My dad loves this kind of pie and I was very nervous making the meringue, but it turned out alright.  It wasn't as fluffy as others I have seen, but it browned very nicely.  I will definately use this one again.

I really enjoyed making this pie. My husband said it was even better after a sitting a few days. The only suggestion I have, is for people to make sure not to take the water/sugar mixture off the stove until it is completely mixed with the corn starch/water mixture. I had to start over because I got lumps. Oh and stir, stir, stir. Otherwise, it is a great and easy recipe!!

I made this pie without any measuring cups, just eyeballing everything and it turned out anyways. I had no trouble with runny filling and it was quite attractive after making peaks and baking.

I have had to make this pie twice in the past 48 hours because my family thinks this is the best lemone meringue pie ever.  I have to agree, and it really is simple.  The only change I made was making twice as much meringue.

Makes a really tasty lemon pie, a little sweet, but not overly so. I didn't mix the meringue with the "lukewarm" filling though... I put the meringue on top of the hot filling so it helps the meringue cook. Easy to prepare, easy to follow directions. The meringue wasn't my usual recipe, (I'd never used salt in meringue before) but this turned out well. Highly recommended!

This was sooo delicious!  I have made lemon meringue pies before, but folding the meringue into the lemon filling gives it a whole new, light texture.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  My husband said it was the best lemon meringue pie he's ever had, and he's very particular so that was quite a compliment.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This pie was amazing. I made it for my mother for her birthday without the meringue on top(she does not like that part) and it was still a great hit. My five year old son has asked for it for Christmas this year.

I made this pie for my Dad for Fathers Day, and I have to say it was great.  I stressed a little when I started, because this was my first lemon Meringue pie, but it turned out really nice. However I changed a couple of things. I didn't use a full 1/2 cup of cornstarch, I only filled the cup 1/4 of the way then added 1/4 of flour then mixed it with the water.  I also added a little more lemon juice.  I also added an extra egg white to the meringue. It whipped up great with my kitchenaid standmixer. Dad wanted to know what I did different with the meringue because his always weeps. And he's baked longer than I have.  Well my parents loved it. Dad wants me to show him how to make it again. Thanks very very much for the great recipe.

I should start by saying that I have never made a pie before, but that I am a seasoned cook who can follow recipes to the letter, although I usually don't use recipes in my cooking.

The meringue was perfectly tasty and not too sweet like some.. I will definitely use Rhonda's recipe for meringue again, although I added 2 egg whites for extra meringue. Thank you, Rhonda! 

The lemon filling, however, was not to my taste at all. IMHO, it was the most sickeningly sweet "food" I had ever tasted. I also had added extra lemon to it along the way, to no avail.

Also, and this part could be the novice in me, the cornstarch clumped up in the sugar mixture (yes, I had the cs in a "smooth paste" before I added it gradually). And once it clumped up, there was nothing I could do but to pull out the clumps. It was an awful experience, and of course, after the oven time, the filling "fell" and melted.

I will need more practice, but I think I will only keep the part of this recipe for the meringue. Thank you.

Great taste.  First time making a lemon meringue pie and I was pleasantly suprised how easy it was.  (almost)  Of course I did have some problems.  I had on a crust protector so the crust would not burn.  Forgot how sticky the meringue can be and of course when I went to take the protector off the crust, the meringue started coming off with it.  It took two of us to get it off without losing the meringue and I ended up breaking off a piece of the crust.  Oh well, learning experience.  It still turned out great.  Made for my mother-in-laws birthday and everyone loved it.  Next time I would probably double up on the meringue because that seems to be everyone's favorite part in my house.  Thanks

This was my first ever lemon meringue pie. While it was easy to make, I found that it turned out kinda salty-tasting. I don't know why because I followed the directions very closely but otherwise a very good pie.

I printed this recipe and didn't have any hints
written on it from past reviews so made as written.  It was really lacking in lemon flavor
so I doubled the amount of lemon zest.  Next time
I will cut back on the sugar.  I partially baked
the crust and would recommend that as it tends to
seep the longer it sets and the crust gets soggy.
The meringue was barely sufficient to cover a 9"
pie, but it was very good and brought lots of 
compliments.

This recipe was really easy to prepare.  I decided to prepare it at the last minute, and had all the ingredients on hand.  My kids loved helping me in the kitchen and they loved eating the pie even more!  Did I mention that the pie was delicious?

This was a big hit w my family. Everyone loved it. Everything  was going smoothly until I had to add the cornstarch ‘paste’ to the sugar/water mixture. I ended up having clumps in the mixture so I threw it out and started over. Instead of adding a cornstarch‘paste’ to the sugar/water mixture, I made it thinner by adding more water to the cornstarch (1/2 CS and about 1/2 water) to make it thinner and slowly added to the sugar/water mixture. No clumps this time and the consistency was perfect. My merange wouldn’t fluff so I ended up using cool whip. Plus I don’t like the idea of mixing raw egg w the filling. It still was so good!!!

We love lemon meringue pie in our house, and I was going to take this to a housewarming party for my husband's best friend. Glad we tried it first. It wasn't nearly as good as I was hoping, though it wasn't too bad.

I reduced the amount of sugar and it still wasn't tart enough. I will be increasing the lemon juice next time I make it. I will be cooling the filling to room temperature without putting it in the fridge next time to hopefully stop the pool of liquid in the bottom of the pie tin. I used six egg whites for the meringue and skipped the part that said to fold some into the lemon mixture. 

I'm probably going to use eight egg whites next time because we love a lot of meringue on our pie and there just wasn't enough. I also substituted the salt in the meringue for cream of tartar. I'll add more zest to the lemon mixture, and might even add a touch more corn starch to thicken it up just a bit more.

I followed the recipe exactly. The filling didn’t set. It was very firm when I added to the cooled pie crust. The meringue went all the way to the crust. Has anyone else had this problem?

Great recipe, a few steps I've never done before (adding whipped egg whites to the lemon filling) really kicked up the flavor.

I followed this recipe directly.  I used the juice of two large lemons & also put a few drops of juice is the meringue.  This was my first attempt at ever making a Lemon Meringue pie & it was DELICIOUS.  I've read all the suggestions about when to put on the meringue.  I didn't cool the pie.  after making the lemon mixture, I made the meringue & added it as directed to the filling & then after filing the crust added the meringue making sure I covered the entire top the pie.  The result was an amazing pie.

This is the best lemon pie.  I think adding the meringue to the filling does it.  Followed recipient exactly.  Made this in our camper with lemons picked from the tree outside our camper door.

I have made this recipe a dozen times, and it always comes out perfect.  You must use fresh lemons for the best lemon flavor, and I have doubled the butter at times which makes the filling more rich.

Tasted great but it came out runny. If anyone can tell me what I might have done wrong, I'd love to know. When I poured the lemon filling into the pie shell, it was the consistency of pudding so I thought it would set up nicely.

I tried following the directions to the T -- it came out a little runny after cooling- did not cover with plastic wrap or anything else to let cool or store.  The 4 egg whites  for the meringue was a bit skimpy or the sugar  prevented  it from expanding? --It was yummy, I have a lemon BUSH and lots of lemons to use so will try again, maybe cook the pudding part a little longer or add more cornstarch ? any suggestions?

Very good, and easy enough to make for my first time! Didn't alter the recipe much except for the fact that we didn't have lemons :( so I used three tablespoons of lemon juice we had on hand, and a little bit more instead of lemon zest. It did weep a bit, so next time I won't be putting it in the fridge. Just keep in mind that the mixture I made had enough for a normal sized pie and a smaller pie, but that was a lot of pie nonetheless. I will be making this again!!

we did twice for this pie, first time we failed. the top is liquid, because we didn't stir the egg white to cream form.
the second time we stir the egg white to cream form.and we have completely followed the recipe, the pie we made looks good but the inside was not solid. And the bottom of the pie was not solid too, i think we put too much oil in it.  But the pie taste pretty good, the inside just like candy, the top just like pudding.  teacher told us we should add one egg that we can make the liquid become solid.

Flavor is terrific. I did have some water in the bottom of the pan. Read that water is almost always cause by meringue.  Recommended fix was to stabilize meringue by adding cream of tartar and not beat so much.  I will certainly give it a try next time.

This pie turned out beautiful and delicious.  I didn't add the lemon zest to it because I don't have a zester yet, but it was great even without it.  I will be keeping this recipe.

Only change I made was not put the lemon mixture in the refrigerator.  I read a few of the reviews and its was to cool or not to cool.  I decided that I would let it sit with a pan of cold water under it while i made the meringue.   It came out AMAZING!  Although it states to let it cool for an hour before serving, we were taken by how delicious it was when chilled.  This is certainly one I am keeping and making again and again.

I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and it was perfect. I followed Jamie Oliver technique with the lemons by rolling the lemons on a hard surface until they are soft. I had enough juice from the 2 lemons to make the pie. My family loved it.

I've made this recipe twice using a Graham cracker crust. It's a very easy pie and the only other change I made was to add a half tsp of lemon extract to the lemon mixture when it was luke warm. It's a big hit with friends and family. I will be making this often.

Meringue sweated within 1 hour after applying to the pie and baking. The filling was to acid-eddy for us. The 2 tsp of rind/oil and 1/2 cup juice was to much. Suggest using much less. The meringue is better if using Cream of Tarter with simple syrup instead of raw sugar. Simple syrup will not weep later.

To cool or not to cool that is the question. I had luke warm filling and no weeping. I didn't put it in the refrigerator, I simply removed it from heat for about 10 to 15 minutes. This pie is fantastic! Must have patience, I cooled the pie after baking it for almost two hours. Definitely worth the wait.

I love this pie. And so does my youngest son. He requests lemon merengue pie every year instead of the usual birthday cake. Last year I made this pie and he was walzing  around the kitchen, pie held overhead in one hand  when he tripped over the sleeping cat and fell face first. His pride was a little hurt but the pie remained intact; held high above on his open hand, We laughed so hard. No one including cat was injured in the making of this birthday event. The pie was delicious and my son vowed it was the best pie he'd ever tasted

This was one of the easiest pies that I've ever made and my husband couldn't stop raving about it! I didn't have any lemon zest so I used approximately 2 1/2 teaspoons of lemon peel and he said the taste was perfect (just in case someone else needs a substitute).

A wonderful pie!  I used a Pillsbury ready to make crust.  

I've made this twice, both times using a 9 inch glass pie plate.  The first time I made it, the pie was very shallow...only about 2 - 3 inches of filling and not much meringue.

The 2nd time I made it, I doubled the recipe and added a pinch more lemon zest.  It was the BEST!  With the meringue, the pie was about 8 inches thick and beautiful!

The flavor is wonderful, but the recipe  was lacking in instructions.  What temperature  am I supposed to bake this at? There are also two measures  of salt here, I assumed what goes in which piece as I went along.  Would have been better with a little more direction.

I did make it and it turned out pretty good. Next time I will follow the recipe letter by letter. My mistake was that one tiny drop of egg yolk inadvertanly got mixed with my Meringue. After the 10mins for browning in the cool oven my tip is to turn oven off and leave pie in oven overnight. Never put in fridge after.

The lemon filling, overall ok. Lets move on to the terrible part, the meringue, it was like biting into foam, like crispy, stale, foam of some kind! I guess meringue sorta always hates me, even though i follow the recipe like my life depends on it!

This recipe was awesome. Their is one problem I want to point out. When adding the meringue use your judgement, a lot of meringue makes the lemon part really fluffy. I like my lemon smoother. Overall this was a great recipe.

I doubled the Lemon juice and zest and only added a small dollop of miraunge to the filling. This made the pie super lemony and sour. Personally, I like it that way, but if you don't like sour then you should not make these modifications. I loved this recipe and so did my entire family. You don't have to smother the whole top in miraunge: you can just add a small dollop or none at all. This will defiantly become a new family favorite. PS: When the recipie says that the water and sugar mixture should become clear, it really means foggy and the consistency of glue. It takes 15 minutes to beat miraunge, so if you have a kitchen aid, use it!

Turned out great!  I made sure to continue cooking the full mixture for about 60 seconds before removing it from heat.  I live at high altitude and that seems to help things setup properly.

Excellent pie, perfect amount  of lemon flavor. The only changes I will make next time is to double the meringue and refrigerate it. The lemon pudding was not completely congealed after the recommended hour await time.

We don't like meringue .  The filling completely filled my crust. So if  I had added half the  meringue more filling than  room in my pie plate. The lemon filling tastes excellent. I used butter in it.

I mixed the cornstarch with the sugar and salt before adding all the water.  I brought this to a boil to thicken and then added the rest of the ingredients.  I did not put any of the meringue in the filling!  That would have made the filling soft.  The filling has absolutely fantastic flavour and set nice and firm.

You can't go wrong with this pie.  It is a household favorite.  Such a wonderful lemon flavor.  The lemon zest is a must!  I like that this pie isn't too sweet.  Every time I have made it, it sets up perfectly.  Yum, yum, yum.

Best lemon pie ever! Followed recipe exactly. It set up peefectly even without refrigerating. Give it a few hours to set and you are good to go. I have made this several times now and everyone loves it. Adding the meringue to the filling makes it creamy and delicious!

made as follows but with the exception of addition just a 1/2-1 tsp lemon extract- as I like my lemon with a bit of a pep-- was the first time I've had lemon meringue turn out nearly so well- will be making again! 
also of note- my meringue took a bit longer in the oven.
I also followed one reviewer and did not refrigerate my pie whatsoever- at any point in time-- let the filling cool before placing meringue on top as well.

This was a wonderful tasting pie. All the girls at work loved it. Great texture and taste. I'll make more meringue next time though. I followed the directions exactly. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing. I want to give this 5 stars but the sight won't let me choose..

Fabulous!!  Followed exactly.  Didn't have time to look at reviews first.  Made way more filling than was needed for the pie crust which was suppose to be deep crust...Made 7 tarts with leftover filling.  Also had enough topping for tarts!!!  Perfect, thanks

I loved the filling portion of this pie.  It was the right amount of tart vs sweet.  The only thing that I omitted was the lemon zest, as I did not have it.  The only reason that I did not give this recipe 5 stars was for the meringue.  It calls for salt and I questioned it while I was whipping my egg whites.  I should have followed my instincts and not used it.  The salt ruins the flavor of the meringue.  I would definitely make this pie again, sans salt!!  Thanks for the recipe.

The filing was pretty good. But the meringue was pretty nasty. I ended up scraping off the top and remaking it with a different recipe.

I love it! It's fantastic! I never would have thought to put the meringue in the filling, but it's amazing.

Disappointing; tasted store bought. 
I went through a lot of work hoping for a nice homemade pie but it was a flop. The lemon filling was overly sweet and had a sticky taste. Texturally it was fine but it was dense and heavy. I'd prefer a lighter, creamier filling. The meringue turned out okay. It had some defects but more as a result of my inexperience with meringue as a topping than the recipe, although more detailed instructions would be nice.

I had never made meringue before and though it wasn't perfect it was still delicious the first time. I've made it three times now and my last pie was perfect. Chill the meringue mixing bowl and make sure eggs are room temperature before mixing. I used 1/2 cup less sugar in the pie filling and it was still sweet and yummy. I also used a graham cracker pie crust instead of a traditional crust and put it in the freezer to set before adding pie filling. Have ingredients ready before starting cooking because there are a lot of steps. This recipe will most certainly be a friends and family favorite for years to come.

My grandson wanted to make a lemon meringue pie. Never making one before, it was a challenge for both of us. We tried two different recipes for a family gathering and this recipe won... hands down. Even my husband (who doesn't like L.M. pie, liked it!..love folding in the meringue to the lemon filling! Nice a creamy. Next time will add a bit more zest. Added 2 extra egg whites for meringue to make sure I had enough(Idid)...and to compensate for the smaller eggs in the "Real" world of todays egg sizes! Nice recipe!! Will make again..

Really good pie, I used half the sugar and it was really good. I made my own crust and made the filling. While I cooled it i made the meringue and spread it evenly. Brown the peaks a little and It was nice and tasty! I suggest eating it the same day, like if your having guest over or for a party since I don't think it was the same the next day, it was kind of runny probably from being in the fridge overnight.

I made this pie for Mothers Day. I followed the recipe exactly for the filling and meringue. This was a Wonderful Pie.... My cousin said it tasted just like her Mothers Lemon Pie, which was a great compliment. Wanted to bring some home,but it was Gone.  I can't wait to make this again. We have to have company or I would eat it all !!

I made this for one of our Easter dinner deserts.  I have never made a lemon pie from scratch so was a bit nervous.  I read through the reviews and decided to make some changes in the receipe.  Firstly, I did add more cornstarch then called for, from 1/2 cup to 1 cup and played  with the water a bit.  I left the sugar the same but did not add the lemon zest.  I also used about 6 or 7 egg whites for the merangue AND used a bit of cream of tartar when mixing the merangue.  OMG this pie turned out delicious!!  Creamy, lemony and a wonderful merangue on top!!  I did not end up putting the lemon mix in the fridge to cool, just forgot, but it was fine.  I made another tried and true pie I always make just in case this was a flop but this lemon pie was devoured!!  Will absolutely make again, with the changes, of course

I knew it was a hit when Mom said "This is better then what my Mom use to make" I did use a different Meringue recipe but pie recipe it self is delicious beyond words! Never made a Lemon Meringue pie before and I found this recipe easy to follow and understand with end results being absolutely great!

So far so good! I put it in the oven a few minutes ago to brown. A note about the cornstarch issues people were having. It will not form a paste. Mine was thickened but not a paste. It came out fine. I did exactly like it said in the instructions. As long as you cook the filling properly it WILL thicken. You can't rush it and you absolutely must make sure it is clear before you add the yolk and lemon juice. The meringue was very pretty and I am hoping it sealed properly.

Best Lemon Meringue!  This was my first attempt at a meringue and it was easy AND tasty.  It has the added touch of folding in some of the meringue into the filling.  You can play with the amount, and make the lemon filling more or less tangy by adding more or less meringue.

This was very good! I used graham cracker crust but next time I will use a frozen or homemade crust, I think that will be better for a cream pie. We didn't have a pie server so the pieces kind of fell apart when we went to put them on a plate, but it tasted great! I actually used a meringue from a different recipe that I heard so many good things about. I think it was Meringue II.  I left out the lemon zest only b/c I didn't want to go through all that trouble for 2 tsp of it, and I don't think it would have made much of a difference.  Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe ruined my meringue - what had started off as glossy, stiff peaks became an unstable, wet mess once the cornstarch mix was added. Moreover, the recipe does not give you guidelines as to what the outcome of adding the conrstarch mix should be. I'd made meringues in the past successfully without all this cornstarch nonsense, but because this was the first time I was making it for a pie, I figured I'd follow the 'allrecipes' guidelines. Big mistake. I would never recommend this to anybody, and I will chance making the pie in the future using the old fashioned sugar + eggwhites only method. The worst part? My meringue came out looking almost exactly like the pie in the pic posted with this recipe -argh!

Love this recipe! Followed the directions as written, with one exeption. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract to the filling. I did have some problems with my meringue, but that's not unusual for me. I always seem too have problems with my meringue. My brother in law suggested that I add cream of tartar to the meringue to stabilize it. I'll probably try that next time.

This was the first time I have ever attempted to make this kind of a pie and although it has lots of steps it was actually pretty easy to make.  I read a lot of the reviews before I made it and I found some tips from other to be helpful.  First I only used 1 and 1/4 cups sugar as another had suggested and I think it had just the right tangy/sweet mixture that I was looking for.  Secondly another reviewer mentioned that the cornstarch/water mixture didn't make a smooth paste.  I had the same experience so I did what they suggested and added some of the hot sugar water mixture to it before pouring it and it really helped.  Some reviewers said there wasn't enough meringue, but I had plenty.  I served this in 8 individual ramekins for a party and everyone loved it.  Lots of dirty dishes in the end but well worth the effort!

tasted delicious!!  i had problems with the custard being too runny and wouldn't stay on the crust.  i also made the rookie mistake of putting the meringue on when it was hot AND putting it in the fridge (since I've never made one and followed directions exactly...)

I'm not as accomplished as others who commented. I tried this recipe on a whim. The pie had a great flavor but both my wife and I thought it was a little "rich".  We both thought the butter was a little too much....BUT, overall, it was a good pie.

I LOVE lemon meringue pie.. but not this one. I also love everything super sweet so I thought this would work perfectly. I am not a fan of the meringue IN the filling.... every bite I took my piece I just couldn't figure out what was wrong with this.. but there's something.

I followed the "Meringue" recipe and followed the Grandma's Lemon Meringue Pie for filling.   Came out Excellent - and as prior reviewer mentioned when blending the egg whites... You CAN NOT cut  the blender off until desired shape of meringue is made or the eggs whites WILL go flat.  So better if using a mixer, but if using a hand held blender (as I did) be aware that it takes at least 15 minutes before the meringue starts to foam, but worth it in the end.

My friend always complains when she goes out that restaurants do not make real meringue.  So we made her this pie for Thanksgiving.  She loved it and it was so easy to make.  I loved it and would make it again!

This was the first lemon meringue pie I ever made. I have never tasted one better. The tang from the fresh squeezed lemons was GREAT!(I did add a little extra) The meringue was perfect.

This was the best tasting pie ever!  I just have a hard time getting meringue to peak, but it still was awesome.  It also was a little runny, maybe it should have cooked longer.  It didnt matter though, it was gone in two days, thanks to me eating most of it. Lemon Meringue is my absolute favorite but never found a recipe I liked until this one. Even I could do it!  Maybe better next time!

I gotta say, Im no cook and I found your instructions very easy to follow (though it did take me a while to realise that cornstarch is cornflour over here).  This made a BEAUTIFULL pie, so yummy.  I did add a tad more cornstarch and a tad less sugar (as others have suggested) and I can not imagine adding the full amount of sugar, it would have been too sweet.  I could not get my egg whites into 'stiff peaks' although this is likely my error, as it is the first time i have tried, therefore it took twice as long to 'cook'.  Thsnk You for this wonderful recipie, I will use it time and again.

A great one! I did use less sugar as others had suggested and the tartness was perfect. I didn't put the pie in the refridgerator as suggested and had no trouble with the meringue. Try this one!

This pie was DELICIOUS!! I'm glad I doubled the recipe, everybody loved it!  This was the first time I ever attempted a lemon meringue pie and I succeeded after trial and error with the meringue part.   If there are beginners like me out there, make sure that your eggs are at room temperature before starting this recipe and you don't get a drop of yolk in your egg white because your meringue will not form peaks.  This is what happened to me and I ended up wasting eggs due to this. But it was worth it in the end when the meringue turned out perfectly!  One thing I would do differently next time, is not mixing in the meringue in the lemon part as it loses its bright yellow appeal.

This got rave reviews from my family.  If you prefer a more tart pie, this isn't the one for you, but if you like a smooth lemon taste you'll love it.  I'd never made a lemon meringue pie, and I have to admit this turned out beautifully.  Thanks for sharing!

Seriously Good! This was the best! I had never made a meringue pie where you added the meringue to the filling. I would like a bit more meringue on top- next time I may add an extra egg white or two- just to have more on top.  Definitely a keeper!

This had a really good flavor to it and was no different to make than a coconut or chocolate pie.  I have never used salt in my meringue so I omitted that, and didn't have any lemon zest on hand,  otherwise made exactly as indicated.  Really pleased with the flavor.

I made this pie for my husband and mother-in-law for Thanksgiving. Neither of them has ever had a cream pie before as they are from Denmark. They were floored! One pie turned those Danes into true pie lovers. I've promised to make it again soon for them. It was a very simple recipe to follow and turned out perfect, not to mention one of the best pies I've ever turned out of my oven! Thanks!

Delicious.  I put a little more meringue in the filling itself (approx. 1 1/4 cups) and it came out beautifully. Also, spoon the meringue on when the filling is still warm, and be certain that the meringue fully covers the filling and touches the edge of the crust, this will prevent weeping and shrinking.  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

i made this pie several days ago and it's still sitting in the fridge half-eaten. it was much to sweet and tart (i've been told it hurts to swallow.)

I was pretty impressed with this recipe.  I had never made a lemon meringue pie before but hubby wanted one, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I left out the zest just because I didn't think we would like the texture it added to the filling.  Other than that, kept everything in the filling the same.  I didn't use this meringue recipe though.  That's why I held back a star.  I used the recipe Meringue II from this site simply because of the issues other's raised about this meringue.  I didn't have any problems with that one.  So, I recommend this filling with that meringue.

I don't give the maximum number of stars often..but this one really deserves it.  I omitted the zest because I didn't have any fresh lemons (only bottled lemon juice) and it was simply delicious.  It's not an overpowering lemon pie but has a nice zip (even without the zest) and is nice and sweet. I'll make this again...even for my mother-in-law who is the Queen of lemon meringue pies.

This came out very good.  I had a little trouble with the meringue getting stiff but the taste was very good.

This recipe is great!  I made three pies for Thanksgiving dinner for about 70 people.  I have been named the official lemon meringue pie maker from now on.  The only thing I did differently, was to pour the filling into the pie shell while hot, and not mix any into the meringue.  Excellent recipe!

I found this recipe very "First-Time" friendly. Although the filling was just a little too sweet.  My suggestion is to cut down on the sugar.
