I make lunch for my aging father 2-3 times a week.  I try something new each time to keep him interested in eating.  My father isn't very verbal so I don't expect much thanks although I know deep down he appreciates my effort.  With that being said, I dropped this meal off and left to do errands.  Imagine my surprise when I returned to find a hand-written note from Dad telling me it was "Very good baby girl!" (yes it had an exclamation point)

I didn't change a thing and now every other Saturday is now known as "Satay Saturday" per my Dad's request.  Thanks Chef John.

These burgers were delicious. I ate mine as lettuce wraps! They did remind me of chicken satay which I happen to love. I added red onion to my slaw, used chunky peanut butter and did add some salt. I love most of chef johns recipes and this one is a keeper!

These burgers were delicious. Make the peanut sauce just before serving as a chemical reaction occurs and the spread got very thick and was quite difficult to spread, but still tasted great. I didn't add any extra salt as the soy sauce was sufficient.

Amazing spin on the summer burger theme. Made exactly as directed, not too hot even for my wife.  We made this twice within a few weeks, we both thought it was well worth coming back to that soon.  Chef John has some great recipes, this is one of my favorites.

These burgers are a delicious, healthier version of comfort food. I used 1/2 ground chicken and 1/2 ground turkey to decrease the cost. I also added an egg to bind the meat mixture. I needed a side dish, so I searched allrecipes and found Asian Cucumber and Peanut Salad (submitted by tammyn316). The two dishes paired perfectly!

I used ground turkey instead of ground chicken, but I don't feel that made much difference in the finished product.  I felt the flavors just weren't there.  If a recipe has 19-20 ingredients, you would expect it to have more flavors than this one.  I even added the extra salt and cayenne pepper!  Actually, there are times when too many ingredients mask one another...I think this may have been the case with these burgers, the slaw and the peanut spread.  It didn't taste anything like satay, which I love. Not planning to make this one again.  Sorry Chef John.  :-(

Delicious! My husband and I both loved this. We didn't have any fresh basil or cilantro, but that didn't matter - I used a couple shakes of dried basil and skipped the cilantro (though I'll try it next time with fresh). I used jarred jalapeno peppers cut fine. For the Asian hot sauce, I used Sriracha. We'll double the recipe next time to have more leftovers. Wonderful combination of flavors.

O.M.G. the family just never knows what culinary delight is going to be on the table next and this was no exception! Divine!  Made no changes, although I did use low sodium soy and added a scant  1/2 tsp of salt to the  chicken mix.  I made this earlier in the day and chilling it made the patties go together very nicely. This will be a new regular in our house.  Chinese cabbage salad was my side with Coconut rice pudding (also by Chef John) for dessert, which helped use up the rest of the Coconut milk.  It was great too.

I made this with the Chef John Peanut Butter dipping Sauce.  I also made "buns" with Crumpets -- using the King Arthur Flour recipe (google it).  I don't think I've seen the family consume a dinner so fast.  It was really really good.

Definitely a keeper.  My family loved this recipe.  I tripled the peanut butter spread  part of the recipe because my family likes spreads on their burgers and ate them on sourdough rounds rather than hamburger buns.

What a fantastic change for a burger. I am not sure you can call food refreshing,  but that is what comes to mind. Didn’t change a thing. Have made this on a few occasions and each time the tastebuds enjoy the different flavors one would never expect in a burger. Thanks again Chef John for providing recipes inexperienced home cooks like myself can follow and enjoy. The videos are always help me understand the cooking instructions better and the dry sense of humor makes it all the more enjoyable.

Loved this! Was missing a few things in the cupboard so used greek yogurt instead of coconut milk and white wine vinegar instead of rice vinegar and it was still amazing. Will make it again for sure!

it took a little time having three different steps but well worth it.  I added a little bit of sweetener to the satay sauce as well as the slaw marinade.  To make it low carb, I ate it on a bed of chopped salad mix topped with the slaw, burgers and satay sauce- it was awesome!

For being multiple steps and a fairly long 
Iist of ingredients, I was somewhat unimpressed. I didn’t have any Asian chili sauce and maybe that’s what was missing, if not that it was definitely in want of salt. Not bad, but I won’t make it again.

Loved it!  I didn't have hamburger buns, so I shaped the meat mixture into sort of a flat hot dog shape, cooked it, then rolled it in Asian rice paper like a spring roll.  I put the carrot/cucumber slaw inside and rolled it up tight.  It made it really easy to eat and dip in the peanut sauce and the flavor was out of this world.  Really great and pretty straightforward.  I also added chopped mint to the meat mixture which added to the flavor. Thanks, John, for this recipe.  It's a winner no mater how you shape it. Next time I might make it into meatballs and toss the peanut sauce with some pasta and the slaw on top.

My family loves this recipe. It is always a win, even with pickiness! The ONLY change I make is omitting the fish sauce because my daughter would freak out (I love fish sauce).  We eat this with no bun and a big Asian-inspired salad on the side--lettuce, pea pods, oranges, green onion, almonds, and crunchy noodles. I should have taken a picture! The burgers are so pretty with a smear of peanut sauce, a pile of the carrot mixture, and some cilantro. YUM! Low carb and full of flavor. Also, if you like to cook Asian food, you would already have most of the ingredients in the fridge and pantry. We use ground turkey,  by the way...only because I think it has more flavor than chicken.

My husband and I made this tonight and it was beautiful. We followed recipe exact except for chunky peanut butter instead of creamy. It meant we just had to add more of the chilli sauce and lime to balance it. We will make this again. Thank you once again, Chef John, for creating a wonderful dish!

Absolutely delicious! I was in the need to find a new way make a ground chicken burger!  I loved everything about the flavors! I did add a bit more sambal to the peanut butter spread! I also needed a substitute for the fish sauce...( it is not sold in my neck of the woods) so I used a splash of soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce! It was delicious!  Also to the slaw I added thin sliced red onion....the slaw with cilantro on top gave it a refreshing taste! We ate them before I was able to snap a pic!

Very well received by my family. The cucumber/carrot relish is the best part - don't skip the fish sauce! Followed the recipe except: used purchased peanut sauce, which I already had on hand, and added thinly sliced green onions and some extra chopped jalapeno and cilantro to the ground chicken (in place of the basil).
