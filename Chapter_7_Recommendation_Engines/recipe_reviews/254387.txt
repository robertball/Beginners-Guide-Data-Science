This was a tasty recipe.. however I think some of the measurements in the recipe are off.  I think 2 zucchini with 20 ounces of cheese (goat plus the parm) would be overkill. I looked at the recipe submitter's photo on his personal recipe and it shows a sprinkle of parm, not a 12 ounce layer... so I used a sprinkle and a little less goat cheese.  I used turkey bacon as well.  This was a very nice recipe with those modifications.

This was really good! I didn't use as much parmesan cheese as the recipe asked for, and I had pizza sauce on hand so used that in place of tomato sauce. I also used fresh chopped herbs. Definitely a keeper!!

This was a winner in my house. It was something different for sure and we really enjoyed it! I substituted cream cheese for goat cheese and used Krakus lunchmeat ham because those are what I had. I also just sprinkled the parmesan on. It turned out excellent and hubby told me to add it to the rotation!

Great recipe!  My husband is a 'meat and potatoes' kind of guy, and he loved this!  I did follow other reviewers' advice, and just gave a (generous) sprinkle of Parmesan on the top.
