This is my recipe but looks like AR edited it.  I don't use tomatoes (can't stand them) - the actual recipe is 3 cans of diced potatoes.  This makes it more southern style and helps to bring out the BBQ Brunswick flavor.  I always serve it with Sweet Cornbread.

This was pretty darned good.  It's a pleasure to be the first to review it.  One of the great things about the AR site is the  search capacity when you want to use certain ingredients.  I had some cooked pork and this was one of the recipes that popped up.  I happened to have a few fresh picked green beans so I added them in and I used a fresh tomato. I will be making this again.  Quick, easy, tasty.

Our family loves Brunswick stew and are very picky southerners about our chow. With that said, I made this stew per the recipe and it was easy and VERY GOOD! We cooked our own pork butt in a slow cooker for 20 hours. Iâ€™m sure that helped. The whole family loved it!!!

Second year in a row making this Brunswick stew and it was GREAT!  I substituted canned white meat chicken and used smoked pork from a Boston butt that a co-worker made for me and threw in the bone too, low simmer about 2 1/2 hours for more flavor.  My added ingredient.....brown sugar.

Making it right now - tastes pretty good, but from the photo I was not expecting such a heavy ketchup/tomato sauce base.  Guess I'm used to a more creamy base, but so far so good!
Follow up - it turned out very good, and even better next day.  My husband loved it, but I would leave out the ketchup next time as it was a touch too sweet for me.

I made this and it was delicious.  I left out the chicken and added some celery.
