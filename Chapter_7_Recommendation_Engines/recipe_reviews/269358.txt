It's wonderful to have such a super simple recipe for a quick, flexible dessert with broad appeal.  I made mine with regular honey graham crackers and lemons.  Chef John was right, it took exactly 1 1/2 lemons to have precisely 1/4 c of juice. I put fresh blackberries on top - delicious with the lemon!  Everyone loved it.  I'm looking forward to trying it with lime, along with other fruits on top.  This would also make an excellent filling for most any type of fruit tart.

I thought this was amazing-- reminded me of key lime pie (although I did make it with lemons).  The gingerbread crust was a bit harder than I would have liked--maybe too much butter? The lemon filling was so wonderful.  When I tasted it while cooking I was disappointed, but after it cooled in refrigerator all flavors came together.  I made it for Christmas dinner and it was a hit. I liked that I could assemble it early in the day (or the night before) .
Addendum 1/2020-- Ok , the reason that the crust was so hard the first time I made this was that I mis-read the amount of butter in the recipe.  I made it again this year (using 1/2 gingersnaps and 1/2 graham crackers) and the correct amount of butter and the crust was perfect.  It was again , a Christmas dinner dessert hit
