The flavor on this is wonderful.  I used Andouille sausage instead of the smoked sausage so I reduced the Cajun spices by a half teaspoon.  All the vegies on this too makes this dish very interesting.  My family loved this even the picky ones!  The sauce is way too thin however.  Next time I will try making a thicker sauce by taking half the butter and garlic, adding a tablespoon of flour and sauteeing for 2 minutes, then adding fat-free half&half instead of milk, stirring constantly until thickened and then adding the parmesan cheese.  Then I'll add it all to the vegies/meat.  Hope this works!

I'm sure as written this recipe is great, so I gave it five stars even though I had to tweak based on what I had on hand. The version I made came out FANTASTIC! Here are my edits for those who also need to tweak...

Substitutions based on what I had: Penne for fettuccine, Polska Kielbasa (entire package) for smoked sausage, omitted shrimp (would have been great addition, but I didn't have any), diced yellow onions for green onions, 4oz can of mushrooms stems & pieces, and used the Cajun Spice Mix recipe on here in place of pre-mixed cajun seasoning.

Cooking variations: I was using an entire package of kielbasa, so there was no need to add any butter when cooking the meat/veggies. While the sausage and veggies were cooking I made a roux (per other's suggestions) with 2 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp flour, then added the milk and parm cheese to the roux to make a nice thick sauce. Added wine, spices, chicken, and pasta to veggies. Stirred in cream sauce once chicken was heated and VIOLA! GREAT MEAL!! 

Definitely going to make this one again! Using a full package of kielbasa brought the number of servings up to about 6-7.

Great recipe, except each time I make it, I forget that the sauce ends up too watery and runny for my liking.  Typically I end up adding a slight roux to thicken the sauce.  Next time I'm going to try either less milk or use yogurt instead.  But overall an awesome, delicious meal with perfect spices!  Thanks for sharing! :)

Yum! This was fabulous. Loved all the veggies and it smelled so good while cooking. I did have to change the recipe just a bit. I left out the shrimp due to allergies, I know its a big part of the recipe but I really wanted to try it anyway. So I added a bit more chicken and sausage to make up for the shrimp. I cooked the chicken in a bit of olive oil and seasoned with the Cajun spice. I finished the pasta in the sauce so I had no problem with it being to thin. Great recipe. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was super good.  If I could give it 4.5 stars, I would.  Made it mostly as written, just added a bit more sausage and garlic.  Yes, the sauce is runny because there isn't any thickening agent added to it, but that wasn't a problem for us.  Tossed the pasta in the pan with all the other stuffs and it absorbed some of the sauce, but there was still plenty left.  If you want the sauce thicker, add some rue.  I bet it'd be just as good with it as it is without.  
Overall, a real winner (husband was still talking about it this morning).

This dish is a miracle in your mouth the savory flavors evaporate in your mouth and the Pinot Grigio bought an exquisite blast of joy and complete orgasmic touch to your tastes, I used half and half instead of milk and added so many sausages it was thick. I did add two and a half tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken. This recipe is truly beautiful. I also seasoned my chicken breast and cooked in the over prior, mind blowing recipe.

Really good and flavorful. I added a roux of two tablespoons butter and two tablespoons flour at step 5 and it was still a thin sauce. I think I will use a penne noodle next time. The fettuccine and the thin sauce made it a little too messy to eat.

I did take some liberties with his recipe based on what I had.  Used chicken thighs, canned tomato, left out the shrimp and subbed sherry for the white wine.  It was very good though!  Next time I will definitely use the shrimp, but I will leave out the broccoli (kids and I liked it, but hubby didn't.). This would also be tasty over rice or orzo.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It's like a Jambalaya Pasta! I have a household of 7, so making meals everyone enjoys is  near impossible. This dish, however, had the approval of 6.5 out of 7, & everyone finished their serving. The .5 is one child (10ys) liking the dish, but said it was a little too spicy. FYI, our age ranges are 8-17yrs & two adults. I did have to make some changes based on what I had. 

I doubled the recipe for all of us, but I also used a whole pound of Kielbasa & cut back on the butter due to the kielbasa's rendered fat, made rice instead of linguini, Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning instead of Cajun seasoning (but added a little Cayenne & Paprika), omitted the mushrooms but used mushroom stock (kids hate mushroom texture, but I like the flavor!), was careful about extra salt, used a whole onion vs green onions, & about 7-8 Garlic cloves - we love garlic. 

I agree with other reviewers re: runny sauce (even before the mushroom stock it was runny). I did thicken w/cornstarch, but rice also helps sop it up better than macaroni would. However, if you thicken the sauce I think linguini/spaghetti/etc. is the way to go!

I had to alter the recipe so my review isn't really true as written, but it goes to show others that it is easily adaptable, still true to the flavors & still delicious! 

I made this 2wks ago & was asked to make it again tonight, which NEVER happens. This time I'll make a roux to thicken the sauce and serve w/the linguini; I expect it will be fabulous.

This recipe turned out great, I didn't do Cajun because my child has to eat as well. I used penne pasta instead and shrimp in place of the chicken.

Good, not sure it really needed the wine. Might leave it, the wine, out next time & see if it makes  it more creamy.

I liked the taste but thought the sauce was too thin.  I added some flour at the end, but should have been added sooner.  I also added an additional teaspoon of Cajun spice and used a whole cutup Kielbasa as the only meat.

Very tasty. I followed exactly except no chicken, didn't have any and did reduce milk to 1/4 cup and put flour in the milk. Then added more milk at the end until it was the right texture for me.  Highly recommend.

We doubled recipe and used sweet Italian Sausage instead of smoked sausage but I think next time we might use Andouille sausage....and we added more mushrooms as we like mushrooms.  It was a very good recipe!

We loved this recipe.  Omitted the mushrooms because, well, I just don't like them.  Used 1/2-n-1/2 instead of milk.  Other than that, followed the recIpe as written.  It will be made again.

My husband does not like anything hot.  I cut the hot pepper way down (less than half) and he still found it too hot.  It did not stop him from eating it, however.  If I make it again, I will have to cut the heat down a bit more.  Very good

I added a couple of tablespoons of flour at the end to thicken the sauce. I used hot Italian sausage and therefore about half the amount of cajun spice. It was delicious!

This is my husband's account and my first time reviewing a recipe but I am so excited about this one that I had to review it. The disclaimer, however,  is that I was not able to make it according to the directions because I did not have everything. I used pepperoni and sausage links because I had those ready, no shrimp, forgot about the mushrooms, used grape tomatoes and tortellini for the pasta. I followed the rest of the recipe however and based on the snitches that I just had its pretty dang awesome. Its 5 stars based on what I just made and because its a great base recipe to adjust as needed.

Really delicious and so easy to make.  I had left over chicken from chicken tacos the night before and it worked perfectly for the "cooked chicken."  I didn't have green onions so I used yellow onion instead.  I would make this again!

Excellent! I used just smoked sausage for the meat, varied the veggies by what I had in the fridge and used the 'Creole Seasoning Blend by JOSLYN' I found on this site. Even the kids loved it!

Great recipe!  Very flavorful.  I didn't have a problem with the sauce being too runny.  I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh as the roma tomatoes aren't very flavorful this time of year.  I drained the juice and used about a 1/4 cup of the juice and 1/2 cup of the diced tomatoes adding them with the wine etc. I used cayenne pepper to taste instead of black pepper as we like this dish spicy! Thanks for a wonderful recipe that doesn't take forever to put together :)
