I just wanted to update my previous review, because I have notice that some reviews say that it is not chocolatey enough for them - I have made this cake at least 20 times since November and everyone says how rich and chocolatey it is.  It is moist and easy to prepare.  Some reviews also have had problems with the cakes sticking - I have been using Wilton's Cake Release and it works awesome there is not even a crumb lost.  Just thought I would put another two cents in.  Don't be afraid to try this recipe everyone who has tried my 20+ cakes has asked me for the recipe.

Sublime. The best chocolate cake I have ever made. I scale the recipe down (9 serves) and this makes 2x9 in round layers, or enough for 26-28 cupcakes.

Follow the instructions and don't muck around with the ingredients. This cake is best the way it is. I thought stirring in the cup of boiling water would ruin the batter, but it did not (although the batter is fairly thin after the water goes in). The taste and texture of this cake is as good as the other reviews claim.

For cupcakes, bake around 15-20 minutes, but definitely test using a toothpick. I didn't use the frosting recipe, but used my own buttercream, and it was great. But if your frosting is too stiff, you might have a problem with the cake crumbling/tearing while you frost it.

This cake is sublime in every way!  The three layers bake up beautifully and the recipe for the frosting makes more than enough to frost all three and sides!  The addition of the sour cream adds a very subtle tang to the chocolate and it's beyond belief.  My husband felt priviledged just to lick the beaters!  What a cake, what a presentation!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful creation and I enjoyed reading Sandy's story!  PS  Make sure you grease generously your cake pans.  I think next time I'll use Pam which might work better.

If you're looking for a cake that holds together well, is moist, plenty chocolaty and ices easily for great presentation, then this is the cake for you!  I made this exactly as directed for my husbands 55th Birthday and it was definately gorgeous to look at and well received over all.  The temperature and cooking time were perfect and when serving guests I would NOT change a thing, however, we found the texture was a smidge too dense for our personal liking and I will be eliminating an egg next time around.  Thank you for sharing.

***five stars all around.  Great cake and the icing is fabulous.  I make alot of different types of chocolate cakes and icings and this is top.  Rich and decadent.  The only subs were for the sour cream portions in the cake and icing..i do half sour cream and half heavy cream.  Richer taste..just what I like.  My cake pans actually overflowed in the oven so don't fill your pans up too high.  The cake rises quite a bit.  Wil make again and again.  Chocolate cake tastes better with age so let it sit for a day for a true flavor.  THANKS!

I have to start out by saying I'm reviewing the CAKE not the frosting.  I have not tried Sandy's frosting.  However, this cake has quickly become the staple chocolate cake for my family!  I've been asked to make it for family gatherings because everyone loves it!  It's super chocolaty, moist, dense yet not too dense.  It's the perfect combination in a cake!  It layers very well without falling apart. I followed directions exactly and had NO problems!The only adjustment I made was cook time.  I take it out 5 mins earlier than recommended (due to my old oven!) If you have not found the perfect chocolate cake, PLEASE give this one a try!

Thank-you Sandy for your fabulously delicious chocolate cake recipe!  I served this velvety creation from heaven at a dinner party and received many compliments.  Those who initially refused dessert gave in to temptation after hearing the exclamations of the first samplers.  The feasters at this Eastern Canada dinner were also delighted to hear about you and your cake's history.  I used Pam and flour on the cake pans and those rich, moist cakes came out beautifully when done.  At 35 minutes, the cakes were still liquidy and I ended up baking them for another 20 minutes.  At this point, they were perfect.  This is a recipe to hand down the generations!

For someone who has NEVER made anything from scratch, this cake was so easy.  It came out delicious.  I was nervous when I saw how thin the batter was, but it worked.  I followed the baking and cooling times exactly. I recommend using only butter for the frosting because I used margarine one time and it came out really runny.  I definitly recommend this recipe.

I will make this every chance I can!  It was moist and light and rich at the same time; the cake is so good you could probably serve it with just a dusting of confectioners sugar--but the frosting is wonderful.  It was a fairly easy recipe with impressive results.  I used parchment paper to line the pans, and it came out beautifully.  Thank you Sandy for sharing it!

This cake is great! I made it for my husband and I for dessert for valentines day (and a few days after) and it has kept wonderfully in the fridge.  It is a very dense rich cake, so a little goes a long way.  I didn't do a thing different to the cake except using lined and greased cake pans.  The frosting I made 2 minor amendments to: Only used dark chocolate and added about 1/3 cup dark cocoa after the 5 cups of icing sugar were in - I tasted it and it was very sweet, but still too "wet".  The cocoa pulled back the sweetness big time and made the frosting super-chocolatey.  Also had to put the frosting in the fridge for half an hour to firm up before using it (but I did made this cake on a very hot day - about 35C). Served this on my big cake stand with rose petals scattered on and around it and it looked amazing!

This was my first attempt at making a cake from scratch.  I have to say I was NOT disappointed!  Instead of baking it in cake form, however, I used the recipe to make 45 cupcakes for my son's first birthday party.  Yep.  45.  I read a review saying the recipe makes 26-28 cupcakes, and so thought I'd just follow the directions as written.  In hindsight, I should have cut it in half, but now we have lots of yummy cupcakes to munch on and share! I prepared the recipe exactly as written, except that I spooned the batter into lined cupcake pans, filling each cup about 2/3 full.  I baked the cupcakes at 350 for 15 minutes, and they turned out incredibly moist.  I also prepared the frosting exactly as written, and there was just enough to liberally spread over each cupcake.  Yep!  All 45!  And I piled it on!  I didn't have to scrimp on the frosting at all, and even had a tiny bit left in the bowl, which my husband appreciated!  The cake itself was light, moist, fluffy, and absolutely delicious.  The frosting was also scrumptious . . . not too rich, just the right amount of sweet.  The end result was perfect!  I will definitely be making this again, but am going to try doing an actual cake next time!
Update 4/1/2011: I just made this as a cake and followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't have quite enough sour cream for both the cake AND frosting. I made up the difference with some cream cheese I had on hand. End result, PERFECT! Everyone raved about it! This is a keeper!

My son could not have been more happy when I made this cake for his 8th birthday.  He is a chocolate lover and loved this cake.  I did take Mis7up's idea by using the Kit Kat bars around the edge and filling the top with M&M's.  I kept this cake a secret from my son, and when it was brough out, his eyes were as big as golfballs.  The cake was beautiful, and more importantly, delicious!!!  Will use this recipe again and again when I need a chocolate cake.

I was looking for a chocolate cake recipe when I misplaced my mom's recipe. When reading the ingred. I thought brown sugar in cake? I also thought the cake will be runny and as I poured in the water is was soupy. I thought to not pour  all that water in but I did.  All 3 layers rose beautifully. I used White Frosting II to frost it. My son's birthday was coming up and this was his request. I had to double the recipe for the frosting to cover all 3 layers. Let me tell you that was a tall cake! My son, 18yr, cut the first piece. When I took my first bite it was very moist and chocolately. I'm so glad I misplaced my mom's recipe!! Thank you Sandra for sharing this recipe. Think I'll let my mom's recipe be misplaced for a while! Next time I'll try the chocolate frostng.

I'm giving this 4 stars b/c the cake was DELICIOUS, but the icing tasted terrible with 1 cup of sour cream.  Next time, I'll probably reduce to 1/4 or 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Cake was a perfect texture - dense, yet light and fluffy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good, but not quite as chocolatey tasting as I was hoping and a little too dense.  I did use a different icing than the one with this recipe, so I can't speak for how the frosting tastes.

Rating CAKE only, not the frosting.  I am a Duncan Hines box girl.  I just hadn't found a from scratch recipe (and I've tried a bunch) that was as flavorful and moist as my beloved DH...until now. Lisa D raves about this cake on the RE, so I finally decided to give it a whirl and boy am I glad!  This will become my new go to chocolate cake recipe!   The first time I made it, I used my hand mixer; the second time, my KA and it was MUCH easier that way (though it wasn't *hard* the other way).  I have to admit, I was a little nervous until I got to the add water step (which is the very last step)!  FYI-you can get away w/using this to fill an 11X15 sheet cake pan (it's a little on the thin side, but still *doable*).  Both times I've made it, I've covered it w/fondant, so I don't have a good picture yet...guess that means I need to make some cupcakes soon...

An excellent cake.  I increased the amount of batter in each pan and made only two layers.  With two thicker layers as opposed to three thinner layers, you will need to increase the baking time about 5 minutes.

Five stars for this cake recipe. I'd never made a cake before but figured I'd try one for my girls' birthday party. This one was well recommended and looked simple enough. I followed the recipe exactly, made no changes. I was a bit hesitant to add the water since the batter looked good before the water but I did it anyway. It didn't make the batter runny like I thought and it's actually a necessary part of the recipe I believe. I was in a crunch for time so I didn't get to make this frosting which disappointed me. I really wanted to try it. Guess next time I'll have to, because there will definitely be a next time.

Finally a perfect cake recipe!! I have been searching for so long for a killer scratch chocolate cake recipe and now my search is over. This cake is sooo amazing, especially when paired with "Rich Chocolate Frosting" from this website! I made exactly as directed, only I took it out of the oven a couple of minutes early. FANTASTIC! My husband had to go lay down after eating a piece, saying he had to think about how good it was. A perfect cake!

Wow, this cake is so good! My husband brought it to work and everybody loved it. His boss took a little piece at lunch, then came back later and took a HUGE piece. I will make this again right before my husband's job review...mwahahaha.

Follow it EXACTLY like the recipe says.  Using plenty of Pam and flour is crucial. I also then add parchment paper.  I have made this twice this week alone.  By far the best chocolate cake I have ever had.  We didn't try the frosting since we preferred white frosting.  We made this for my cousin's birthday and made regular buttercreme frosting with a tsp of coconut.  Fantastic cake!  Sooo moist.  You won't be sorry.

WOW! I love making things from scratch and this is by far the greatest! I made this yesterday for Valentine's Day - my husband couldn't stop talking about it! I normally only eat a little of things I bake, but this time, I took a rather big piece and loved every minute of it...so moist and chocolatey!! I did half the recipe for the cake and the frosting and made it in 2 9 in. pans rather than 3 and it didn't make a difference still really really good....I am definitely keeping this recipe and making it again.

WOW...I can say this cake is fantastic.  Easy to make, all around awesome.  I have been a long time subscriber to Cooks Illustrated and tried their "Best Chocolate Cake " recipe last year.   Not only did this cake recipe beat the Cook's recipe, it didnt use every pan in my kitchen and took half the time to make.  A definite      keeper.

I made mini cupcakes that tasted really great.  These are covered in ganache and whipped chocolate frosting.  They are tiny!  That is a candy holder cupcake paper.  The Candy Lips are for Valentines day.

Cake is delicious but none of us were at all fond of the icing, the sour cream flavor is quite prominent - just personal taste I guess.  I would make the cake again, just use my own chocolate or mocha icing recipe.

This cake is super delish amazing! I wish I could give it more stars. Only change I made was I added 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. I also didn't make the frosting, because I decorated this cake like a pig. Amazing cake! Will for sure make again.

Not super-chocolatey but chocolatey enough. The crumb and texture is GREAT. I made the recipe for 9 servings and got 12 cupcakes and an 8" cake out of it. Not too light, and not dense. I think the chocolate flavour should intensify the day after. (Didn't make the frosting.)

I followed the recipe exactly except I used coffee instead of the boiling water. The cake turned out nice and was moist. The layers were easy to work with and the icing came together great. I am usually a boxed cake mix kind of girl so this is saying a lot! far as that goes, it could be rated a 5.  That said, the cake was so rich and sweet that it was not a big hit. We all felt sugar sick after eating it. I don't think I will make this again. If I do venture to do this again, I would have to use less icing or a different recipe. The icing is delicious but I think it is what sent the cake over on the sugar meter for us!

I made this cake following the recipe exactly except for scaling it down to 9 servings and pouring it into 2 cake pans instead of 3.   I found scaling it down made the perfect amount of cake.  I put chocolate pudding between the layers and I used duncan hines icing b/c I was in a rush.  It was very moist and tasty cake.  I will definitely make it again.

Perfect...or at least just what I was looking for!  I made mini cupcakes and dipped them in a basic ganache then frosted with the "Chocolate Fudge Buttercream" recipe on this site.  I tried 2 other recipes but this one was just right.

Just what I have been searching for. This cake is not too moist, not too dry. It is tender and has a deep chocolate flavor. I added about 6 oz. of strong black coffee to the batter (replacing some of the water), because coffee does so much to bring out the depth of chocolate. My new go-to chocolate cake.

I made this for my dad's birthday and he is practically a baking pro himself (he bakes cakes for all sorts of occasions)--he said it was delicious. And everyone else loved it too. I didn't use the frosting included, but a frosting mix from Trader Joe's, which was perfect and saved a bit of time and effort.

Thank you so much for sharing such a great recipe. And just a note... this was the second cake I have ever made in my life so ANYONE can make this. Just follow the recipe!

This recipe is the BEST, I saw it on the back cover of my Taste of Home magazine, but never tried it. The reason I love this site so much is because you can read the reviews and I NEVER bother making a recipe that does not have at least 10 good reviews and that is 10 in a row. This is the best chocolate cake I think I've had so far on this site. I thought the last one I made was good, but no where near as good as this one. I even added a sml. package of chocolate pudding, don't know if that made it more moist but just thought I'd try it since they put it in some cake mixes, I thought it wouldn't hurt anything. I didn't make all three layers just 2, and made cupcakes with it, my kid's wanted cupcakes. This one is a keeper for me!! Thanks Sandy, I enjoyed your story, I think I've told it to like 3 people now.

Thank you, so much Sandy, for the recipe. My teenager wanted to bake a cake for her dad from scratch and she tried your recipe. We did have an awful time getting the cake out of the pans;but that was most likely because we used "Pam" spray and flour instead of shortening (like most cake bakers), I know do.(?)  Even though it looked like a very dark chocolate cake,the flavor was more of a milk chocolate with brown sugar undertones. It had a wonderful denseness that was clearly what made this a cake contest winner. We did not try this frosting recipe but used a pre made.Also, this cake was even better the next day!

Wonderful cake!  I used bakers joy cooking spray in my round pans, then lined with parchment rounds and gave another quick spray.  They released wonderfully.  I went for layering two cakes instead of three, keeping one for home.  I used the "sturdy whipped cream" frosting to frost my layer cake.  In between I put macerated strawberries with sugar and vanilla that were well drained.  Topped with decorative strawberries.  It was so good!  Cake was gone in no time!  Cake has a nice rich chocolate flavor.  Thanks!

I reviewed this a long time ago but I thought I'd update, since then I've made it probably a dozen times.  This is easily the best cake I've ever made, it's great as cupcakes or in cake form.  It's SO incredibly moist and chocolatey.  I'm always messing with recipes, but this one is so perfect I always make it as is.  I get SO many compliments on it.  For the people who said it's not super chocolatey, I'm thinking maybe they either cooked it too long (dryness always detracts from taste) or used low-quality cocoa powder. I've made it with regular Hershey's and it's definitely great, but it's noticeably better (as anything would be) with high-quality cocoa (Scharffen Berger is easily available around here and also delicious).  I like it best with a nice fluffy peanut butter frosting.  Today I'm making it with oreo cream cheese frosting for my mother-in-law's birthday.  I will never use another chocolate cake recipe... I can't rave enough about it! Just try it, you'll understand : )

This really is a fantastic cake and icing. I made it in a 13x9 pan and it turned out so good! I would definitely make this again and serve to guests anytime. Very rich and satisfies ANY chocolate craving.
The cake is dense and decadent. It would be good with vanilla ice cream and no frosting or dollops of lightly sweetened whipped cream.
The icing fooled me. The powdered sugar & sour cream mixture seemed soupy to me, but after adding the melted chocolates and mixing with mixer, it turns into this wonderful, fluffy, beautiful chocolate frosting.
Really an outstanding cake all around.

This was WONDERFUL!  SO moist, just the right sweetness of the cake and the frosting.  I didn't have 3 wire racks that were larger than the cake to turn the cake out on.  Only had two and they came out perfectly but the third one (which then became the bottom) fell off the smaller-than-the-pan one on one side.  I was a little short of the 1 cup sour cream for the frosting but just added some evaporated milk that I needed to use up until it was the right consistency to spread nicely.  THE only chocolate cake recipe that I'll use now.

Extremely delicious and easy!  The batter is thin but turns into a very light and moist cake.  I made cupcakes.  Fill the cups halfway for cakes just right for frosting (perfectly level with the top of the liner).  My batch of 12 servings, the original recipe, made 48 cupcakes.

This recipes is insane! I love making this, and although I have not been very successful with homemade cakes before, it turned out soooo good. I used with Rick's Buttercream frosting, from this site, and it was delish!

This was, by far, the best chocolate cake I have ever had, thank you Sandy!  I have made this multiple times for family and friends who all rave about it.  Half of the butter can be substituted with applesauce so a bit healthier of a recipe and still taste just as delicious!

Turned out perfect and delicious.  I have two round pans and two springform pans, all the same size, and so I had to mix and match the pan type to do the three layers.  I found that the springform pans performed better since the cake is so moist and lovely that even with a well-greased cake pan, a chunk broke off coming out of the pan.

Let me start by saying that I LOVE to bake and do so very frequently. This is the BEST chocolate cake recipe ever!!!   The cake itself is soooo delicious that you could eat it without the icing.....but the icing is out of this world as well.   The cake is moist, fluffy and very chocolately.  The icing is chocolately delicious without being overpowering.    Sandy,Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  My whole family is raving about it!   I don't feel compelled to rate recipes very often, but just had to post my kudos for this one.    Thanks again!!!!

Excellent moistness with light texture.  The perfect cake crumb!  Very nice recipe, not overly sweet or strongly chocolate; which I happen to like anyway.  It matched with the frosting perfectly.  This was very good.  I did follow recipe directions and beat well after each egg addition.

I only made the cake, not the frosting, so my review is based on that.  The taste of the cake was amazing, but I had problems getting it out of the pan even though I generously greased it with crisco.

Followed recipe, cake came out perfect. I did over cook a little next time I will do 30 minutes instead of 35. Cake was not as moist as I wanted, but I do believe that was from over baking. Icing was very rich, its was good to have enough to cover the cake plus. Next time I am going to change the chocolate to milk chocolate for icing, so it will loose some of the dark chocolate taste. Very good recipe thanks for sharing.

Cake just doesn't get any better than this, and I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this recipe.  I've made it at least a dozen times now, and it is legendary among my friends, family and coworkers.  It's dense without being heavy, rich without being cloying, and perfectly sweet and chocolatey.  I don't change a thing, and wouldn't dream of using another icing.  As other reviewers have mentioned, you really don't have to trim the tops of the layers.  It bakes up just right, and is truly delicious.

This recipe makes a very impressive-looking cake. My three layers baked up beautifully, very even. The frosting was easy to spread as well. That being said, it's a very "filling" cake. My guests all commented on it, many couldn't finish their serving. It's definitely a cake where a little slice goes a long way. I've made Too Much Chocolate Cake from this site many times and my family all agreed that we prefer it over this one. Not that this is not a good cake, we just prefer the other. I'm glad I tried it, though! Thanks, Sandy!

I made such a mess of this recipe and it still came out incredible.  First, I only have 2 9" pans so I used those, plus one 8" pan, planning to frost that 8" as a little cake separately and to make a 2 layer cake with the two 9" layers.  I put all the pans on one rack, even though I know my oven is hotter in the back but, I planned on turning them around during cooking so they'd bake evenly... and then I forgot. The two 9" layers were burnt and lopsided on one side. The 8" was perfect.  I cut the two 9" layers in half and put the 2 good halves together and shaved the tops off to make it flat. Then I made the frosting but, I sat down to check email after making the frosting and before frosting the cake (now an 8" layer on top of pieced together 9" layer) and on the shaved top part, it was just a mess trying to spread the frosting that had gotten so thick while sitting so I ended up opening a can of cherry pastry filling and spread that between the 2 layers. I did manage to get the frosting, that was thickening by the moment due to the real chocolate, to cover the whole outside of the cake but it looked awful. I realized I had quite a bit of frosting left in the bowl and it had turned pretty solid soooooo, I scraped it out of the mixing bowl and into a large glass measuring cup and microwaved it until it was liquid again. Then I poured it over the cake and it was PERFECT. I call it my Lava Cake. It got rave reviews and I thought it was great too. Thank you, Sandy!

OH YUM!  This was a PHENOMENAL chocolate cake...somewhat dense, but not too much with an excellent chocolate flavour.  I scaled it down to 9 for our smaller dinner party and baked it in a bundt pan instead of 9in pans (took around mins in my pan) .  Turned out beautifully - frosted with Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze...mmmm!!

I am giving this cake 5 stars, despite one issue with it. The flavor is fantastic- the brown sugar adds a caramel flavor to the background. The texture is perfect- light and delicate, but not completely lacking like with a box cake. The one problem I had was that I used part of the batter to make cupcakes and they didn't turn out. I filled lined cups 3/4 of the way and they rose over the top and spread and were completely flat in the middle. But, this happens to me with every cupcake attempt, so I'm not convinced that it's by fault of the recipe. I am making a filled cake with this, so I put the batter into a floured 8" spring form pan (so I can hollow it out for my crazy scheme) and it obviously takes longer to bake that way. The batter does rise A LOT (I left about 3" head space in the pan and it still overflowed) during baking, so just be aware if you choose to do something other than the 3 layers called for. I do think this may become my standard recipe, though. The cake itself is outstanding. I really think that my problems are because I don't understand cake (like the nuances of it), not by any fault of the recipe itself.

BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE!  This is the chocolate cake I have been looking for.  Made this cake for my husband's birthday and everyone loved it.  I did a two layer cake which was nice and high, and looked great. Used the remaining batter for a one layer cake, with butter cream icing, and I found that flouring and greasing the pan along with parchment paper works much better and the cake just drops out of the pan --no sticking.  This will be my favorite recipe for chocolate cake.  Thank you Sandy.

what a fiasco!  Obviously, I did something wrong.  The batter rose over the pans in the oven and messed up the entire oven. Could using jumbo eggs make that much difference?  Sorry to bring the score down but what a disappointment!

I've made many chocolate cakes before, but my family says that this is the best chocolate cake EVER!  Half-way through the recipe, I realized that I was out of cocoa, so I melted ~8oz of dark chocolate and added it to the wet ingredients.  I doubled the amount of unsweetened chocolate in the frosting because I thought it was too sweet otherwise.  Top each slice with some pressurized whipped cream, and it'll look like you bought it from a bakery!!

This is the best cake I've ever made. The frosting is the perfect texture and spreads very well. Next time I think I will try using milk chocolate in place of the semi-sweet. I also brushed each layer of the cake with a mixture of 2 parts Torani Vanilla Syrum to 1 part water. My mother-in-law taught me this trick, it's the perfect way to keep a cake moist and delicious. ENJOY!!!!!

It was very moist but it didn't have that chocolate flavor. It was more like a red velvet cake. If you tasted it with your eyes closed- you'd have no idea it was chocolate.

Very moist and delicious.  I used a dark chocolate cocoa powder which contrasted very well with the sweet chocolatey frosting.  Will definitely make again.

I've made this cake 3 times since trying it out last Christmas and everyone loves it.  It's a huge cake and very rich and filling so it goes a long way.  Question for all you bakers out there....Because of the sour cream in the frosting I've refrigerated the cake each time which takes a lot of fridg room.  Does anyone make it and not refrigerate it??

This cake was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  The cake was moist and just right in texture.  This is not a light and fluffy cake, but it isn't too heavy either. Just right!  
I did not make the frosting this time.  I think it sounds wonderful though! I decided to add a salted caramel frosting and then drizzled the remaining caramel and melted chocolate over the finished cake.  It was beautiful and so yummy.  

This is definitely my new favorite chocolate cake recipe!

I made this cake with a different frosting.  The cake is not dense; it is light like cake mix cakes.  It has good flavor and baked nicely.  I was worried when I added the water but eventually it mixed in.  Thanks for sharing Sandy.

I was asked to make a chocolate cake for a house warming party and to my chagrin I was out of chocolate cake mix.  In searching for recipes from scratch I tumbled across this one and I'm so glad I did!  I had to double the recipe and didn't want to open another bag of brown sugar for two cups but I had about 2 cups of applesauce left in a jar so I dumped it in.  I also only had about half of the sour cream I needed but I dumped that in and it still turned out fantastic despite the changes I made!  I will have to try it again when I have everything I need because the things I skimped on could only make it better!

Cake was very dense and chewy when done. It also lacked the moistness that makes a good chocolate cake. I was very disappointed in this cake especially since so many have it rave reviews!! I will def NOT be making this cake ever again

Very Good and Moist! Even better when undercooked I took it out a few minutes before it was done because the middle was sinking in and then i froze it and it was VERY moist it was almost like eating fudge or brownies. Every time I make this cake I get compliments on it!

Delicious!!  Very moist.  Not an extremely sweet or chocolatey cake, which I like.  The batter was extremely liquidy and was worried when I put it in the oven, but they came out fantastic!

AMAZING FROSTING!!! I used this frosting recipe, but did not use the cake recipe. For the cake I used the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe (submitted by Denise). The combination of that cake with this frosting is out of this world!!!! My family went wild over this cake. My husband keeps begging me to make it again!! Just a note, I did the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" in two 9" round cake pans. SUPERB!

My search is over - this is the best chocolate cake EVER!! I had tried 3 other from scratch chocolate cake recipes but this one is it for me.  I only made the cake part and frosted it with the frosting I make for red velvet cake.  PERFECT.  Thank you for sharing this!

The cake is amazing!  However, i am giving it a 4 star rating because of the frosting.  It turned out really good but it is a little (a LOT) to much. Would make the cake again but not the frosting.

Wow.....
I halved the recipe, and got 21 cupcakes out of it (filled 4/5 of the way up) at 350 for 15 minutes. Followed recipe exactly, except for using weak coffee instead of water. Also, I make my own brown sugar, and I make it very, very dark, which I think only added to the depth of flavor.

I wasn't going to try them until the party I made them for tomorrow, but one of them came out all crooked and ugly, so I thought I'd give it a taste.

OH MY GOD.
WOW.
This cake is amazingly delicious. The best, lightest, fluffiest texture, perfect crumb, so moist but not dense... Not overly sweet. Just enough chocolate that it's not too rich to eat a full slice. Holy .

MAKE THESE RIGHT NOW.
It is taking every ounce of willpower I have to not go grab another one while they are still warm...

FIRST time baking a cake from scratch! What an enjoyable experience, from bowl to mouth. I'm tempted to never make a chocolate cake from any other recipe but this one. The fam LOVED it! It was very rich, just the way we like it! ;-)

I made this for my son's birthday last week.  It wasn't my favorite cake ever, but it wasn't terrible.  It burnt very quickly for me, and I pulled it out about 8-10 minutes early!  I trimmed the burnt edges and bottom off and other than being a bit on the dry side, the flavor was nice, and the texture was PERFECT.  I used cake flour instead of all-purpose, so don't know if that's what gave it such a nice soft crumb or not.  The frosting was absolutely delicious, and I'm not a frosting person.  I was worried about how runny it was at first, but somehow when you add the chocolate/butter, it thickens right up and whips up nice and fluffy.  Just perfect.  All in all, I might try a different cake recipe next time, but I will come back to this frosting again and again!  If I do try the cake again, I will keep a MUCH closer eye on it, since I think the burnt edges are really what brought it down to 4 stars for me.

This was GREAT cake!  My family gobbled this right up!  5 stars would be for the cake alone but the frosting was 4 stars.  We did not care for it as it is and I had to adjust it.  I will definitely make the cake again but use a different frosting.

One word for this cake: AWESOME!  My husband is a huge chocolate lover and I made this for him to take to a work potluck.  It was gone in minutes.  He snagged a piece for me and brought it home and it was delish!  This is my new chocolate cake recipe.  I was nervous about the frosting since I've never made it with sour cream but it was the best frosting I've ever had.

Followed exact recipe for the cake and it was moist, not too light/too heavy, and had a rich chocolately flavor.  I only have two cake pans so I made 12 cupcakes with the rest.  I greased the pan with non-stick cooking spray and it worked beautifully.  THANK YOU for posting this recipe.  My 11 yr old daughter said that it was better than cake that you make from a box.  Just what I was looking for.

Moist chocolate cake that always turns out - I haven't tried the frosting but the cake is awesome.  I like to add some instant coffee to the boiling water for a darker flavor.   I've made 8 inch cakes, 9 inch cakes, and about 42 cupcakes with the recipe.

Very good cake! I am not sure about the sour cream in the frosting, it gave it a bit of twang, for a lack of better words. It wasn't bad, but I may leave it out or use cream cheese if I make it again! Other than that, it was perfect!

I made this cake for a co-workers Birthday and it's the bomb, It's the most moist cake ever, and not to sweet which is great I plan on making this again for Thanksgiving. I got a little nervous at the end of the recipe you add 1 1/3 cups boiling water to the batter it makes the batter very thin but it works like a charm, I highly reccomend this one.

I have made this cake 3 times in the last 3 months. It is beautiful and delicious. My bf LOVES chocolate and this is his favorite dessert. This 3rd time I filled it with raspberry filling between the layers and it looks amazing. (I haven't tasted it yet) I scaled the recipe down for 9 servings and I still used 3 cake pans (the full recipe was to tall for my glass cake pan.)

The only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is because I only had about 2c. of the packed brown sugar (possibly less) and used about 1 1/2c. of white sugar, I had to use sour milk instead of sour cream, and I did not have any powdered sugar on hand so I could not make the frosting:( I used Satiny Chocolate Glaze instead. My mom (I'm almost15) said she will never by a boxed cake again! I think a key think is to make sure you whip the living daylights out of the butter and sugar. The cakes came easily off the pans because I buttered, then sprayed with cooking spray, and then dusted them with the coco/flour mixture. I also sifted the dry ingredients. Thank you!

Delicious!! This recipe is awesome..I didn't change a thing other than to scale down the recipe to 9 servings so I could make a 2 layer cake instead of 3. My cake came out light, fluffy and not overly sweet. The brown sugar gave a nice rich flavor without being heavy. I also liked that this cake had no oil and the only fat came from the sour cream. The frosting I used was not the recipe that came with the cake, it was a basic chocolate frosting made with butter, cocoa and sugar.  Thank-you for sharing this recipe..it was so easy and straightforward but tastes like a fancy bakery cake! No more boxed cake mix for me!

This was a very yummy cake. Only thing was that mine didnt cook anything like as fast as the recipe said. Maybe my unusual oven, but in any respect the cake still turned out yum. Lots of compliments

This is an absolutely fantastic cake with a lovely moist texture.  I add two tablespoons of strong instant coffee to the hot water in the cake batter, and one tablespoon of coffee dissolved in a small amount of hot water to the melted chocolate before mixing the icing.  This adds a beautiful mocha flavour!

This came out fantastic. I'm a decent baker, but my chocolate cakes have all come out to mixed results. I went with this recipe for its simplicity, and it works! Thanks for all the reviews about the batter. I really did worry it was too thin, but nope, came out perfect in the recommended time. This is a keeper.  Didn't try the frost, though. Went with a vanilla buttercream.  This cake would be perfect for whoopie pies.

This cake was a HUGE hit at a co-worker's birthday party; I had to cut tiny slices because I invited about 20 people to partake (me and my big mouth!). It's the BEST chocolate thing to wrap your lips around, and everyone raved. The frosting is incredible - we thought we died and went to Heaven! I had no problem putting it together, but I baked the cake one night and frosted it the next, so it had a little time to set up. Thanks a million from a bunch of chocoholics!

Really really good.  I made it for my daughters birthday and she declared me the best mommy ever.  I ended up having to add another cup to cup and a half of powdered sugar to the frosting to get it to come together.  It was crazy hot and humid (and after baking all day the house was warm) and I'm pretty sure that's why it needed the extra powdered sugar.  It's not an overly sickly sweet cake which made it even better.

I thought this cake & THIS frosting came out excellent. I seem to be in the minority here in that I made this cake with THIS recipe's frosting, and they were both great. I was hoping for more of a devil's food type color (and flavor) to this cake which I did not get, but probably could if I used a better brand of cocoa (I used Nestle). The frosting was incredible, really out of this world. It's a sour cream ganache, essentially, that you whip with your mixer after it solidifies (and you must keep whipping it to keep it soft, it hardens as any frosting using real chocolate will do). I don't know if I'll use this particular cake recipe again (although it tasted great, and was easy to slice in half into layers) but I will DEFINITELY be using this tender, rich, truffle-like frosting again for other cakes (and sandwich cookies!) Thanks for the recipe, Sandy!

I made this cake the other night thankfully for only my husband before I was going to try it out on guests......needless to say, mine tasted AWESOME but.....it did NOT look like the picture.  I couldn't get the layers to stay put! One thing, is I used a different cake icing and added toasted coconut to 1/2 the icing.  It did taste amazing though so I will try again.  VERY VERY moist.

I baked this cake and used the frosting listed this week.  It came out so lovely and the three layers rose beautifully.  It was really tasty the first night, but after refrigerating overnight and for the rest of the week, it was downright addicting!  The refrigeration made the rich chocolate taste stand out.  We absolutely love it and it will be my new "favorite" chocolate cake recipe.

This is BY FAR the best chocolate cake ever. My mom tasted a bite tonight, and after her eyes rolled back in her head said that this beat out her favorite chocolate cake recipe that she's had forever. The chocolate cake by itself was good, but with this frosting was transformed into the most amazing cake ever! I made it for my grandpa's 80th birthday party for 20 people. EVERYONE RAVED!:)

Best chocolate cake recipe ever!  My boyfriend is begging me to make this cake again.  My recipe addition ... spray the cake pans with a baking spray and then sugar them instead of flouring them.

Amazing recipe.  I have made it twice now with rave reviews.  I used the filling from "Chocolate-Covered OREO Cookie Cake" to add to this great recipe.

Thanks for the great recipe.

I was very disappointed with this recipe, particularly the frosting. I read the reviews and was not sure about the frosting, but went ahoead and made it and was sorry I did. The cake is good, it was not great, but good enough, but the frosting was totally not my taste at all. Very fudgey with a very sweet, but tangy strange taste. I had never had frosting with sour cream so maybe it tasted good just not to me, but unless you are sure, I would be wary of this frosting. I love sweets, but could not eat my piece of this.

I just made this cake for the first time and the taste is WONDERFUL.  It's very thick and moist.  However, baking at 350 my cakes were done (clean toothpick in the center) after only 20 minutes as opposed to 35!  This may very well be due to a problem with the oven (which is electric) itself, so I suggest sticking to the recipe - maybe just check on the cake often.  I'll definitely use this again.

This was my first cake/frosting from scratch, and I was quite nervous.  I blended everything as directed, but was puzzled when the cake rose right over the edges of the pans.  I retraced my cake-making steps, scanned previous posts, and this is what I came up with.  I accidently  purchased 8 inch pans.  Therefore, the cakes took substantially longer to cook, and overflowed a little.  Because I had to cook them so long, a crust developed on the top of the cake.  I solved this by removing the top 1/2 inch of each of the cakes and iced them as usual.  The cake was well received by all, and the problems that I had with it were my own fault.  This recipe is quite good.  It worked very well, and the frosting was perfect, both in taste and consistancy--perhaps a touch too sweet, but of course that could just be me.  Those who had problems with the cakes either not cooking in the alotted time, or overflowing, I think must have done what I did.  Still, the best cake I've ever made.  And everyone loved it.

The cake was the best I've ever had however the frosting wasn't that great. The frosting had an odd tang because of the sour cream.  Even though I love sour cream I didn't care for this frosting but I will make the cake again. I've made this as a sheet cake using the chocolate Ganache frosting on this website and gotten rave reviews and also as cupcakes using the Whipped cream cream cheese frosting also on this website and again received rave reviews with many requests for recipes. This is easily my go-to chocolate cake recipe when I want to impress. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.

I made this for my husband's birthday, a very good moist cake. I halved the recipe and made it in a springform pan.I used Rick's Buttercream recipe on this site to frost. Tasted even better the next day!

I have made again and substituted hot coffee for boiling water, frosted with Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe that other reviewers had recommended, I used half mlk and half coffee in the frosting.
It was to die for, I wish I could give more stars!

This is amazing! It's very rich and creamy. The icing is very good, but a little too sugary. It's great for birthdays and fund-raisers. I would diffidently make it again! :)

So delicious! I usually don't care much for chocolate cakes or chocolate frosting, but my roommate requested a chocolate cake for her birthday and I thought I'd give this recipe a try. It was a huge hit! Everyone loved the cake, and someone even told me it was as good as the chocolate cake at a local specialty bakery (which was really saying something). Definitely a keeper. The one change I did make was to add about a cup more powdered sugar than was called for - the frosting was not stiff enough before that.

This is an excellent chocolate cake.  The cake has a dense consistency and much better than the airy box cake mixes.  I used sifted whole wheat flour in place of white flour.  Everyone loved the cake and had no idea I used whole wheat flour.

I love everything about this cake. I used Pam and the cakes came out of the pans easily and perfectly level. The taste and texture of the cake is super. It would taste wonderful with or without frosting. I did make it with frosting though since I wanted it to look pretty for guests. I was a bit short on the confectioner's sugar since 1 box only has 3 3/4 cups but it tasted sweet enough for me and all of my guests. My fiance said that it's the best chocolate cake I have ever made.

This is the best chocolate cake that I have ever had. My family had a recipe that was handed down for many years which used burnt coffee in it, but this one has replaced it by far. I made for a gathering one time and everyone could not believe how good it was. One of the people there was my sister and she even through out the family recipe and replaced it with this one. The only suggestion that I have for this one is that when you icing the cake, use long skewers to hold the three layers in place and then remove them to finish it off.

Good but very sweet! i'm not a huge fan of cake so i judge my ratings for cake on the other guests. My boyfriend usually loves cake and he said it was very good but too sweet. My dad said the same thing. That said it is a very good recipe to start with. My suggestion would be to decrease the sugar to 2 cups. 3 is way too many. Maybe a cup less powdered sugar too, but i'm not sure how that would work texture wise. I'll make it again but i'm going to try to make it less sweet.

I made this for my husband's birthday, he loves chocolate and this was perfect.  I thought it was very rich and I loved the frosting. I had read the reviews and was suprised at how very chocolate this tasted - some reviewers felt it didn't have enough chocolate taste, but I disagree. In fact it was a little too much chocolate for me, I'm not a big chocolate fan.  But, since it was my husband's birthday and he LOVES chocolate it was perfect.  I will make this one again, everyone liked it. I followed the directions exactly and the only change I would make is on how I managed the frosting.  I would put more frosting in the middle layers of the cake, I wasn't sure if I'd have enough for the top of the cake, so I skimped a little on the middle.  I ended up having leftover frosting.   Thanks for this great recipe!

Made this today for my husband's birthday (the world's biggest chocolate cake connoiseur)...and my mom showed up, the second biggest...this one is right up there!  Thanks to all the comments here, I wasn't surrised at the watery batter...and I put extra shortening on the pans so it wouldn't stick.  The frosting is fantastic and the cake was extra moist.  It was chocolatey enough!  Make sure to have a big gallon of milk on hand!
Thank you Sandy...it's an award winner in my family!

I halved the recipe and baked in two 9-inch round pans for 25 minutes.  I didn't have enough butter for the frosting so I topped with the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting found here on AllRecipes.  YUM!!!  This is a definite keeper.  Thank you for sharing!

This cake is delicious! Instead of using baking cocoa, I had to use Perugina's Cocoa with Amaro scent. It lent the cake a deep richness and exquisite dark chocolate perfume to this cake! I found that I had to bake the cake about 10 minutes or so longer than the indicated time, but it could be my oven.. toothpick test your cake to see when it's ready. Also, it's practically impossible to get sour cream in Rome, so I used a plain yogurt substitute instead. It's delightful even with the substitute, and the only difference maybe that the yogurt makes it a little more moist, which I rather like! Perfect to pair with coffee.

Wonderful cake that everyone loved. I must say that I had some difficulty removing the cakes from the pans since it was so moist, so be careful to grease and flour well your molds and may be wait a little bit longer than 10 minutes before removing them from the pans. If I would have made the icing separately, I would have rated it 3 stars but when spread on the cake it fitted nicely.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfectly. One note on this, though, is that there is definitely enough batter for 3 layers, even two big ones doesn't use it all. . . After reading everyone else's reviews I have to put in a plug for the frosting - I really love it and so does everyone else I serve it to. It's different than buttercream, but it compliments the cake wonderfully.

I made this cake for New Year's Eve and it was a hit.  I only made one variation.  Instead of using 3/4 cup of reg. cocoa powder, I used 1/4 cup reg. and 1/2 cup of the Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder. I iced between the layers with Bavarian Cream and and iced the top and sides of the cake with chocolate ganache.

I was not a chocolate cake fan until I tried this recipe for my brother-in-laws birthday. It was a hit. All family members loved it. Brilliant recipe Sandy! It's my Go TO chocolate cake, so as I am about to use the recipe yet again, I thought I should at least submit a review as it I have been using it for 3 years now :-)I haven't tried your frosting yet but hope to do so one day.

*** Cake Rating Only***

This will now be my go to chocolate cake. The texture, moistness and flavor is the best I have tasted. I have made and rated the top 3 cakes on this site. This one is the best of them all. 

I only made two changes and that was to increase (by accident) the vanilla extract to 2 teaspoons and used some weak coffee I brewed in my french press instead of the plain boiled water. 

I lowered the recipe level from 12 to 9 (since I was only making cupcakes) and baked them for 19 minutes. It made about 30 cupcakes. 30 super perfect chocolate cupcakes!

Thank you SOOOOOOO much for sharing this recipe with us!

I've made this cake twice now. It is delicious and moist! a bit time consuming but well worth it. I was able to make 3 dozen cupcakes and fill two 6inch square cake pans. The 2nd time I filled four 9 inch round cake pans but if you want thicker layers I'd do three pans.

Amazingly delicious chocolate cake! I am a cupcake person myself, and so I only used the actual 'cake' recipe, not the icing. The recipe made delicious, moist, chocolaty cupcakes, but it made a LOT of them. The first time I made this recipe, I ended up with 45 cupcakes, and I only needed 24 (eep!). It's a very very good, high-quality chocolate cake recipe, but if you're using it to make cupcakes, half or quarter it!

This is a fabulous, rich, moist cake.  I made it for my father-in-law's 90th birthday. There wasn't a crumb left and everyone asked for the recipe.  I frosted mine with decorator buttercream so I don't know how the frosting is.

I made this cake for my step daughters mother, she wanted me to make her a chocolate mint cake with chocolate mint icing. I just added peppermint extract and it was awesome. Tasted like an Andys mint. I have made this cake other times too and every time it was excellent.

It was very chocolatey. I didn't have sour cream or plain yogurt on hand, so used milk + vinegar. For some reason the centre didn't settle well, but still tasty anyhow. I will try again with sourcream next time. ---- Edit: I used sour cream and didn't change much in taste, but the texture was better. This might be my "go-to" chocolate cake/cupcake recipe! I always use coffee instead of water to bring out the chocolate flavour more, and use applesauce instead of oil or butter. Very tasty and much, much lower fat!

Really terrific chocolate cake. Good taste that is both rich and subtle at the same time. Not greasy (and for those with reflux I found this didn't repeat on me much). Plan to make again. Made enough for a 2 layer cake and then some.

This cake is AWESOME!!!  I've made it several times but as a fondant cake.  Everyone is pleasantly surprised that there is a luscious chocolate cake under the fondant.  I also used strong coffee instead of boiling water which gave the cake a richer taste.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

To Cool for ONLY ten minutes before removing to cooling rack is ENTIRELY inaccurate! .... I've only dabbled in one layer cakes, so this was my first run at a two layer cake (I reduced to two layers and some cupcakes, so I didn't take on the full three for my first run) and ten minutes is a joke. Totally ruined the shape. Luckily my guests aren't picky so we still enjoyed the chocolate cake disaster. The good part is it is absolutely delicious! I know next time to let it cool much longer to maintain the shape. Also, I did not use the icing recipe, as I have my own that's lighter. Definitely a great chocolate taste and very moist!

I followed this recipe exactly and got a really dense sponge. It just tasted like eating a chocolate flavored kitchen sponge. I made the frosting and it looked a little too runny but i frosted the cake anyway and it ended up hardening like sugar cookie frosting. I don't know if that's what it was supposed to be like? My kids love chocolate anything, but after one bite they wouldn't eat anymore! The only redeeming quality was that the flavor of the cake itself was just right.

The cake was moist enough but the frosting got hard too quick. I don't like fudge so it was too much for me. It seemed to get better as the days went on. It lasted 3 days.  My husband loved it, though.

Very good. Needed the icing though. The cake is dense and flavorful but not as chocolatey as I had hoped for on its own. With the icing it was a perfect combination.

I made this cake into cupcakes for my friends birthday and they were a hit! I forgot to put into the boiling water into the mix but it didn't ruin the cupcakes. I used my own icing recipe. And I'm already getting demands for more cake. I baked the cupcakes for about 20 mins instead of 35 mins and it baked perfectly. I'll for sure be using this cake recipe again

This is a great recipe ! I tried making it once for my niece's birthday and i halved everything the recipe called for because I wanted to make a two tiered cake. I ended up with quite a decent sized 7inch two-tiered cake which was enough as we were gonna eat this after dinner. It tasted great and my little niece came back for seconds and was still asking for the cake the following day. I followed the recipe exactly other than the sugar content. I halved the amount of sugar it asked for as my parents didn't like sweets. This recipe is a keeper for me ! Will be making it again for my Chinese New Year party this weekend.

This cake is great. It's very rich and kind of dense. The frosting is very rich, so spread it kind of thin. In the future I would use less frosting than the recipe calls for. We also found that this cake is better if refrigerated, as it makes it kind of fudgy.

HORRIBLE CAKE DO NOT MAKE.  It was OK just it was super dense and not a fluffy cake at all of what the picture looks like. It was chewy and dense and it was not what a great chocolate cake should taste like!! Do not waste your time on this cake!!!!!

I think this is the best chocolate cake that I have ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly, and used a high quality cocoa powder, and it came out rich, moist, and very chocolatey.  I was a bit skeptical of the icing with so much sour cream, and I agree with other reviews that it was tangy, but it had a wonderful consistency and the flavor worked perfectly with the richness of the cake.  I made this as a birthday cake for a party of 9, and everyone raved about it, and 4 of them even told me it was by far the best chocolate cake they have ever had.  Great job Sandy, and thanks for sharing your prized cake recipe!

This was my first try at making a chocolate cake. It turned out really well. I didn't use the icing but the cake was gone in less than 2 days! My family loved it. The cake is moist, soft and so delicious. Thanks!

This is a very good cake, not an intense chocolate flavor. But it is very dense and moist. I kept one layer of this cake on a covered cake dish for over a week and it did not dry out. I didn't use frosting on it, but it might benefit from a ganache, and not frosting

This cake was moist and delicious. I used the cake and frosting to make cake pops for Thanksgiving. Prior to mashing up the cake I ate a slice, and it was divine. It made for stellar cake pops! Just mash the cake up, mix frosting in with it, and cover in chocolate.

I made this exactly as written. Yum!! The cake is incredibly moist and the icing is a great match. It is very rich and goes great with a glass of ice cold milk. I think I'll take this to Christmas dinner at my sister's this year.

It is a beautiful cake, but I do not have anything big enough to transport it in. Should I ever get it to the birthday party, I will let you know how it taste. 

I did not care for the taste of the frosting and the cake was not as moist as my other chocolate cake recipes.

UPDATE: It is now just over 8 years later (2020) and this is still my one and only chocolate cake recipe that I use. I make it exactly as is and it is perfectly moist and delicious every single time. I do have some issues when using it for cupcakes, they tend to sink and stick to the papers. 

I only made the cake but it was amazing!!!! I did not have any problems with it sticking to the pan, I just used normal non stick spray but did not flour the pan and had no problems. I used buttercream frosting and doubled this recipe to make a barbie doll cake. Perfect and the birthday girl loved it!

Oh my gosh, this cake was absolutely perfect! The cake didn't rise as high as I had wanted, but it was still very moist and rich. The batter was very liquidty after I added the water, and was worried it wouldn't rise, but it definitely turned out well. The frosting was great, some people said it was a little sweet, but I thought it was perfect! Thx for the great recipe! I wouldn't change a thing! I'm definitely using this for my christmas party!

I made this into cupcakes (it makes about 46-48!). I thought it would have more of a chocolatey taste, with the use of the brown sugar, but they don't have the intense, rich flavor I was looking for. I even used double-brewed coffee in place of the water (you can't taste the coffee - it enhances the chocolate flavor). Nice texture, though. The frosting will hopefully add sweetness. Next time, I'd use half brown/half white sugar.

My Mother was having her 87th birthday and she told me she wanted to have a chocolate cake!  Our family has lots of family receipes but I wanted something different- I searched and searched the internet looking for all kinds of cakes and found this one.  Thank you Sandy!  This was such a big hit with all of my 5 out of 6 family members and my Mama.  So smooth and yummy- gotta be the sour cream and the dark brown sugar.  I will make again for Christmas- so worth the time and the smiles on everyones faces.  Loved Sandy's story of the fair.  I can see why you won the blue ribbon!  Thanks!

Absolutely delish. I made cupcakes for my daughters birthday with this batter. It made 36 cupcakes. Cooked for 20 min's. They were purfect. I also piped in some marshamallow cream before frosting. Tasted like I bought them from a bakery.This one is definately a keeper that I will use again and again.

This cake was awesome! I made it for my husbands birthday and he requested that I add gran marnier of all things. So I used half a cup of gran marnier in replace of 1/2 worth of the boiling water and it was great! Very chocolately and easy to make. Will definately keep this recipe for the future.

This recipe made a wonderful cake for my son's 3rd birthday party! I used both the cake and frosting recipes with great success. I used a peanut butter frosting as filling between the layers, and used the chocolate frosting for the entire outside of the cake. One change I made to help with the consistency of the frosting: After I melted the butter and chocolate, I let it sit for a half-hour before combining with the other ingredients. It made a very nice, thick frosting. In hindsight, I should have cut the powdered sugar back to 4 cups. It was just a bit too sweet with 5 cups.

AWESOME!  I added a bit more cocoa than it called for based on previous reviews.  Also I used up misc.chocolate, dark dove bites, and other left-over choc. chips, etc. in the frosting.  It was really good. I will be using this receipe a lot!

BY FAR THIS IS THE VERY BEST chocolate cake and frosting I have ever had!  I see why you won 1st Place.  I had one problem and that was my cake rounds stuck to the pan, I oiled and floured them.  Any good suggestions?  Even with that I patched it together and it was STILL THE BEST CAKE.  MY HUSBAND WANTED SECONDS AND HE NEVER DOES THAT!!!! : ) sent to drivemsdazy@yahoo.com.

OMG!! This cake was soooo goooood it made my head spin!  I followed directions almost exactly.  I didn't have enough of regular chocolate coco powder I substitued about a 1/4 with dark chocolate powder.  Also I didn't use the frosting with this recipe.  I made a fudge frosting instead.  The batter was very running but baked nicely.  If you are ever in the need for comfort food.... this is it!

Excellent recipe, moist and not too chocolaty. The only change I made was using vanilla yogourt instead of sour cream and it came out wonderfully. As the other reviewers mentioned adding the water may go against your better judgement but trust Sandy!!I made it for my son's 2nd birthday and everyone loved it, a store bought cake was along side this one and people wanted seconds of mine..Thank you Sandy!!

HOLY MOLY!!!!  What a spectacular cake!  I'd just about given up on making cakes from scratch as they always tend to taste to "dry" for my liking.  Not this one.  Moist and chocolately thru and thru.  The only real trouble I had was keeping my fiance and kids out of the batter and the frosting.  Be sure to line the bottom of the pans with parchment paper and sticking becomes a non-issue.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Sandy.  You definitely deserved to win!

First time I made it, I made cupcakes and they were great with differant frosting, second time I made a cake with the frosting. I did not care for the sour cream tang at all, maybe just a taste thing and the cake didn't taste very chocalatey, I might have to keep looking

Add a small box of instant chocolate pudding w/ the dry ingredients and this makes the BEST chocolate cake ever. However, it only makes two 9" rounds, not three.

Made this cake last night and it was good.  Nothing wrong with it but it still wasn't exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm looking for a very dark, rich, moist cake.  To me, it seemed like a lot of work to end up tasting like most other chocolate cakes, nothing wrong, but nothing extra special either.  Maybe it was me.

Made this for Easter Sunday lunch.   It was a huge hit.   Turned out perfectly.  Thank you for a wonderful cake recipe.  The icing ingredients were great too.  There actually was enough to fill the inside and cover the top and sides of cake.  I have tried many recipes were there just wasn't enough.
Thanks again.

Update:
!It came out ok! I was amazed, almost an hour later, the cake came out fine! When the middle finally set, I took it out and let it cool. I just took it out of the pan and it's still moist around the edges. I wasn't expecting it to still be perfect! Tastes ok, I still prefer my usual chocolate cake recipe, but this one is definitely more moist. I used a different frosting so I can't say anything about the frosting in the recipe. I do recommend people to try this recipe.
---------------
:( I just tried to make this, and it turned into a huge waste of time. It's still in the oven (it's been about 45 mins) and the middle is still soupy. I followed the recipe exactly, and never had a problem with my oven temp. I'm sure it would have been great if it turned out right, but the way it's going, by the time the middle finishes backing, the edges will be burnt.

I have been baking for over 25 years and was not impressed with the recipe.  This cake is fair.  I should have listened to my 11 year old son who told me to bake my regular cake.  I use the recipe off the back of the Hershey's can of Cocoa.  It is more moist than this cake.  Also, we did not care for the frosting.  It was too sweet and had a tang to it.  My daughter didn't even finish her piece of cake.

Delicious cake but with some major flaws. First, the cake fell in the middle - for my 9" layers and some cupcakes I made with the recipe. Second, I cannot get this cake to come out of the pan! I greased and floured the pans but those layers are staying in. I've made this cake twice now, in different ovens, and I've had the same issues. If you want a beautiful cake, try another recipe.

I have made this cake twice. Both times I have followed the recipe and timings precisely to the T. If you decide to make this cake, don't even think about changing a thing. Why would you mess with perfection? This lady did not win a competition of over 65 other cakes for nothing. It is easy to make, is moist and super chocolaty and tastes divine. It makes a really big impression and is a winner all round. Anyone who says anything went wrong, either did not follow the extremely simple instructions or is daft. I cannot say enough good things about this cake, it is medal worthy. I've added a photo of the one I just made.

I also made this cake for chocolate lover daughter's birthday.  I made just as the recipe is written, and it turned out fabulous.  The cake was very moist with a very rich chocolate flavour and the icing was also perfect for us as we don't care for overly rich, over sweet frostings.  I had several requests for the recipe which I guess says it all!

I halved the recipe and did TWO 9 inch pans and cooked for 25 minutes.  It was a dry cake.  I would never make it again.

This tasted good but I didnt think it was exceptional by any means. Followed recipe as written. I used it because it was a really thick dense cake great for my fondant covering. I thought the frosting was really bitter - much prefer a cream cheese frosting as well as the "black Magic Cake" from this site.

I'm not sure if this is the "best" chocolate cake recipe, but it was good especially the next day after being refrigerated overnight.  I made this for my son's birthday and the kids only ate 1/2 of their slices. . .I don't think they liked the frosting and that's usually their favorite part of a cake.

Mmm, delicious! I made this cake with several friends in college, and though none of us are highly experienced cooks it turned out fantastically! I did see a review saying the frosting was too sweet, and so we added four or so cups of sugar instead of five, which worked just fine.

OMG, OMG, OMG!!! Sandy this is serious cake. I don't think anyone will find a more moist, rich, delicious cake. My father loves this cake, and he grew up with a mother that was an excellent baker. My friends LOVE this cake. Don't make any changes to this recipe. It all works together Perfectly!

Perfection. I've made this cake several times now and it becoming a "Most Requested" among my friends and family. I have had it stick to the baking pan so I always make sure to use parchment or wax paper to line my baking pans. I use the recipe for Rich Chocolate Frosting with it (cut frosting recipe in half). Wonderful combination. Thank you, Sandy!

I loved this. Made it for a birthday (only my second attempt at birthday cake--the first time I made one, it was pretty dry) and got rave reviews! I followed another reviewer's advice and cut to 9 servings to make 2 layers instead of three. Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter. Put some Hershey's Hugs in the food processor to chop them up and sprinkled them on top. It is very sweet, but I quite liked it. The sour cream does something very nice for the icing and the cake itself stayed nice and moist. Thanks Sandy!

THIS CAKE WAS AMAZING! I following the recipe exactly and baked it for 35 minutes. I did not use the icing recipe and instead used the recipe for Rich Chocolate Frosting and it was by far the BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER!

I made this cake for my Dad's B-Day and it was a hit!  Great for chocolate lovers!  I added 1/4 cup of cocoa and a little extra confectioner's sugar to the frosting to dry it up a bit since it seemed a little too wet and I didn't want it to slide down the cake. Next time I will try cutting back the sour cream a bit also if its warm outside because I could see it melting. It had a good flavor though, and the cake itself was perfect!   5 stars!

Made this cake for Valentines day for my husband. It was a high beautiful cake. Plenty of batter for 3 layers and plenty of frosting for three layers. When I asked my husband what he thought  he told me it was BY FAR the best cake he had ever eaten. I made it exactly as written and had no problems with it.  It certainly is an award winner. This is certainly a special occassion cake.

The cake and frosting are wonderful!  The frosting needs to be kept in the fridge, b/c of the sour cream, which makes the cake a little too firm, but still yummy!  Next time I'll make the cake/frosting just before serving or use another frosting recipe

Sandy I have to say this is some cake! I was afraid it wouldn't turn out as well as it did-am at camp + have todeal with a HOT oven! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is quite labor intensive in my opinion! The cake and frosting are both DELICIOUS! Didn't spare any calories on this one...no wonder it's a winner! Thanks for the post.

This cake is so incredible!!! I've made it many many times and always get so many compliments and requests for more! Made it one year for my boyfriend's birthday and instead of frosting on the inside, I put mint chocolate chip between the layers. AMAZING is all I can say! It's a great cake with the frosting too, but you might want to scale it down a bit - there's always SO much frosting left, and I really pile it on! Awesome cake overall,

This is, simply put, the best chocolate cake recipe I've ever used. My family fell in love with the cake the first time I made it, and now it's requested at everyone's birthday party for their cake.  To make this even better, in between each layer, I spread a layer of raspberry jam. It adds a fantastic flavor to the already delicious moist taste of the cake.

Awesome! Was very moist and very delicious, doesnt need any change in recipe at all.Real chocolholics can actually add a bit more of (two or three)sweetened chocolate square to have even richer a taste of chocolate.Use good quality cocoa powder.I had never tried chocolate cake with brown sugar but adventure was worth it.Oh yeah! Review is only for cake ,as I dint try frosting.

I baked 2 8 inch cakes and 6 cupcakes - the layers baked beautifully and smell so delicious, although I have yet to try the cake because it is for Mother's Day. I filled the pans about 3/4 full - this was just the right amount. I greased the pans with Pam and used a little flour on the bottom and had no trouble removing the cakes from the pan after 10 minutes. I used Rich Chocolate Frosting for the outside and a raspberry jam pie filling for the middle, as per my Mom's favourite tastes. I will edit my review after it is tasted on Sunday :) Thanks Sandy!

First, thanks so much to Sandy for sharing this receipe! It is the best chocolate cake I have ever baked and everyone I served it to said it was the best they had ever eaten. I don't know how anyone could give it less than 5 stars. I would give it more if I could. The cake is moist and chocolately and the frosting has just the right amount of sweetness. The only mistake I made was using only 2 9" pans because I didn't have 3. I should have scaled back the receipe when I did this because it caused a bit of spillover in the oven. I used Pam spray for baking and the cake didn't stick at all. Try it, you'll like it!

The cake itself was delicious! Very chocolately, almost brownie-like, but when paired with the very sweet very thick frosting (we dubbed it fudge) it was a little too much. I will definitely try it again, this time with a buttercream frosting, and I think the combination will be just perfect. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this cake for my bf and he simply loved it.. he loved the presentation of the cake as well.. The cake was moist and delicious however u should follow the recipe closely.. I only used semi sweet chocolate chips for the frosting and didn't use unsweetened chocolate so my frosting ended up a little too sweet.. But it was a lovely experience baking it :)

Okay everyone, this is THE chocolate cake.  I've made it I don't know how many times already, and I always get rave reviews.  There is nothing like this in a box.  It is dense, full of flavor, moist, and simply perfect.  The kind you would get in a high quality bakery.  I haven't changed a thing in the recipe.  I just don't use the sour cream frosting because I find it too tangy.  I use buttercream frosting for this one, only using real butter.  I also use it to make a quick version of Black Forest Cake.  Bake up two 8-inch round cakes (I don't use all the batter for two cakes of this size, and I weigh the batter so both will be of same quantity), freeze them, then fill the cake with a thin layer of cherry pie filling, then frost the cake with buttercream, then add more of the remaining cherries on top.  Pipe icing on the sides for an easy finish, and decorate with more rosettes of frosting on top.

I needed to use up some cocoa so I set out to make cupcakes. This recipe had been in my box for a few months now. All I can say is wow! Why did I wait so long to try this recipe? These cupcakes turned out so good and moist. I was scared for a minute, because I tried one while it was still warm - ICK! I could taste nothing but baking soda. After cooling though, they were delicious and the baking soda taste went away. So yeah, make these but wait till they're cool to sample. Oh, I didn't make the frosting so I'm giving 4 stars. I frosted with "Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting" from this site. YUMMY!

Delicious!  I was looking for a moist chocolate cake and this definitely filled the bill.  I didn't have any problems with the cake sticking, but I did line the bottoms of my pans with parchment.  I made two round cakes and 12 cupcakes with this recipe.  The frosting is a semi-sweet flavor- if you like a milk chocolate taste, this is not the recipe for you.

I've made this twice, once exactly as written and once using "Rich chocolate Frosting". Both times it was fabulous. My husband and I prefer the Rich chocolate Frosting with this cake. The cake, hands down, is the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted. The complaints about the "middle sinking/falling" I don't understand, since both times it came out completely perfect when baked for 35 minutes. It is a lot of work, but
it is worth the effort, no store bought mix (even doctored up) compares. Thanks Sandy!

Very yummy. Moist with a great chocolate flavor. I used boiling coffee instead of water and frosted with German chocolate coconut-pecan frosting.

I made this as cupcakes for my brother's graduation party and frosted them with vanilla frosting. Everyone loved them; very moist. After all what wouldn't be moist after 2 sticks of butter, over a cup of sour cream and 4 eggs? It is a great recipe, don't get me wrong, but it's about as close as you can get to serving heart disease in edible form.

Maybe I did something wrong but this was okay. I give it a 4 stars because the cake was light and fluffy. I didn't care for the frosting as my family and I could taste the cocoa in it. I followed the recipe exactly.

I've been looking for a really good choc cake for a while and this one is excellent.  FYI, in my haste I forgot to add the water however it still turned out lovely and moist so I think I will continue to make it that way.

Great cake!  I made this for a friend's graduation party and it was great.  It was easy to make and looked gorgeous.  The layers were perfectly flat.  I was a little worried about the frosting because I've had chocolate frosting with sour cream in it and didn't like it but this frosting was incredible.  I had a little leftover and brought it in to work the next day and everyone ate it with pretzels.  My dad isn't a chocolate lover but ate a piece and said it was super moist.  Awesome!

I have made this recipe since I found it about 20 times.(I have had a 12 year old boy help me do this into cupcakes...it isn't hard to make!) I have four almost grown children, their friends, my husband and my two syblings and their spouses who can't get enough of it.  THIS CAKE IS IMPRESSIVE, just by looks alone and is requested at all family gatherings we have now.  It is moist, chocolaty, and everything a three layer chocolate cake should be, including rich.  Wonderful, Wonderful recipe!!!

This recipe is awesome. My mother made this cake for me at my birthday party, and all of my friends and family loved it.My father, who doesn't eat cake at all, said that this cake was literally addicting. I used the oreo cake filling, instead of this one, because I couldn't decide which cake I wanted to make for my party. I LOVE THIS CAKE!!

Okay I am giving this a 3 bc the cake part amazing so moist and fudgy yummy made the house smell delicious.  The frosting reminding me of grocery store bakery frosting yuck!  To sugary this cake me and 5 others agreed a fudgie frosting less sugar more something.  I will use this website to locate the perfect frosting.  But a 5 for the cake awesome. The cake is also a great way to use up cocoa powder since it uses quite a bit.  i only really use cocoa powder around christmas time always a new one so if you are trying to use it up make this cake you surely will not be disappointed.

My 15 year old son made this for me for my birthday.  It was absolutely the best chocolate cake I've had.  The cake is very moist and the icing went perfectly with it.  My other two sons have already made a request for this cake on their birthday and I will make this again and again!

This cake was fabulous!  My kids ate it up!  Yes, there is a slight tangy taste to the frosting due to the sour cream, so if you're not into that, just find a different frosting recipe.  My layers never flattened like the previous poster, they stayed high and fabulous until I frosted them the following day.  And it made plenty of frosting for the cake, decorations AND a few cupcakes from the left over cake batter.  I would definitely make this cake again!

I thought this cake was going to be fantastic based on the ingredients and the reviews.  I usually love sour cream but I think this was a little overboard.  I probably wouldn't make this frosting again.  It was too sour.  Also I'm not sure what I did wrong but the cake fell a lot after it cooled and was frosted.  If you like a lot of frosting and your making a double layer I would double the frosting.

The cake itself is very good and easy to make, but the frosting ruined it.  The frosting is just awful, it is bitter and sour and not very chocolatey at all.  Make the cake but use a different frosting recipe.

This is the best chocolate cake I've ever made.  I've made it several times and it comes out perfect every time.  Usually I make cupcakes and fill them and don't need frosting.  I recently made it for my daughter's 2nd birthday as a layer cake with the same cupcake filling and everyone went back for more.  It was a shaped cake and this recipe held up wonderfully to all the cutting and tweaking I did!  Thank you Sandy for the Wonderful recipe.

What a wonderfully moist cake!  I made it into cupcakes for a baby shower filling paper lined muffin tins 2/3 full and baking for 17-19 minutes - they turned out great!  Instead of using the regular chocolate for the frosting I substituted white chocolate (I wanted to be able to color it to match the shower colors) and I think it added a nice twist.  I will definitely use this again!

I am 14 years old and this was the first cake i have ever made and the 4th baking thing i have ever done. I was pretty nervous because I was baking this for my two twin brothers and my dad's birthday party (we did a 3 in one party) It was incredibly easy and it tasted amazing! I got many compliments on it and I would definatly recomend it to others, beginners or accomplished bakers. It was moist, chocolatey, but not overpowering at all. Very good!

I only used the cake recipe, but it was excellent!  I feel like a lot of from-scratch cake recipes end up being too dry, but this was wonderful.  My husband commmented that this was the best chocolate cake he had ever eaten, and I'd have to agree!  I'm not a huge super-chocolatey fan, so I used a vanilla buttercream to fill the layers and lightly frost the outside.  Then I made a chocolate ganache that ran over the top and sides, and shaved white chocolate on top.  I will absolutely be making the cake again.  I think I'd better go have another piece right now!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday, and took the leftovers to work. It was such a big hit! It even had the doctors complimenting! What a rich, wonderful cake, and attractive as well. I did increase the baking cocoa to 1 cup in the cake, and used 2 cups of semi-sweet cho. chips in the frosting, replacing the chocolate squares. This cake recipe is a saver.

Very good.  Quantity of ingredients was high and it was a lot of work.  Guess you don't mind that much if you are making a 3 layer chocolate cake from scratch though.  Three layers is a little much for me.  I was sooo full after just one piece.  Next time I'd cut the recipe by 1/3 and make just 2 layers.  
I made the icing a little different though, since I didn't have all the ingredients for this.  
Overall, it was very good... very moist.

This cake was absolutely AMAZING! I was scared about making my own frosting, but it was a very simple recipe with incredible results. It stayed perfectly moist for a long time too. Longer if we hadn't eaten it so fast.

Oh my God!!! This is a fantastic cake. Perfect in every way, you don't need to change a thing. I have searched forever for a cake frosting that I like, and I got better, I LOVE this frosting. The cake is so moist and fluffy and baked up like a dream. No more searching, this the ONE recipe I will always come back to. THANK YOU!

Three words...OH MY GOD!!!

This is an absolutely wonderful cake!!!!  I made this cake for Valentines day (08), it is the first cake I have made, completely from scratch, that is moist, and tastes great.  Most chocolate cakes with chocolate icing are to sweet, but the sour cream in this one makes it perfect.  I am generally not a baker but this turned out so well that I listed a picture of it.  I did dress it up a litte, I put chocolate shavings and fanned strawberriesIon the top. One of my husbands friends said that is was almost to pretty to eat, ALMOST.  My husband and a few of his friends had about 3/4 of the cake devoured in about 15 minutes, and a few of them said that they usually don't eat chocolate cake!!

Thank you so much for sharing such a wonderful recipe with us.

For those of you thinking of trying this recipe, GO FOR IT, trust me you won't regret it.

I thought this cake was excellent.  It was very moist and the sour cream gives it a nice taste.  I made this as a sheet cake and if I was using a reg 9x13 pan, I would have needed two pans.  Next time I will half the recipe to make a single sheet cake.  I used Ricks ricks buttercream icing and it paired really nicley.  Will make this again.

LOVE IT!!

I absolutely love this recipe.  It looks like it came from a bakery and tastes like it too.  The sour cream makes it so delicious.  I made the cake and froze it.  I made the frosting the next day and frosted the cake.  Less crumbs while frosting that way.  YUMMO!  I made it again three weeks later for another event.  It was a hit both times.

I might have baked this too long because it didn't seem as moist as the other reviewers.  I usually use a boxed cake mix recipe with added sour cream and espresso which seems to taste as good and is much easier to make.

best cake in the world!!!!!
I added 3 oz. of finely grated dark chocolate to the batter to get that extra rich chocolate flavor.  I took it to the inlaws for a party and every one loved it!!!!!  It really is the best cake ive ever had!!!!!
However, the frosting was way to sweet:(  i ended up using half the recipe along with about a half cup of crisco half a bag of melted ghiradelli 60% cacao chocolate chips and some espresso powder to get it away from tooth achingly sweet. next time i will save myself the hassle and just reduce the sugar and add the espresso powder for some bite.

I Have to say I was a bit skeptical, because I have already tried so many recipes that claim to be true chocolate fudge cake but never seem to be what I had in mind. HOWEVER, I am more then happy to say that this recipe was definitely NOT a let down! It truly is the best chocolate fudge cake I have ever had, and if it hadn't been eaten so quickly I would have provided a picture. The recipe is quite generous, I had to cut it down a bit but it still made a large sized two layer cake. Also I had to use creme fraiche instead of sour cream, as it is hard to come by over here. But it worked just as well! Thank you Sandy, for sharing such a wonderful recipe! It made me fall in love with baking again! :)

I can't stop nibbling at this cake! Because there are only two of us, I halved the recipe and it made one 9 inch cake and nine cupcakes. I have a feeling all the cupcakes will be gone by the end of the night...try this recipe!

this is a fantastic cake! It is moist and delicious. I heard from other reviews that the frosting was very sweet, so I iced between the layers with it, and iced the outside with homemade whipped cream. It was absolutly delicious!!! 
5 and a half stars at least!

Thanks Sandy.  This cake is not only fantastic in taste, but its appearance is beautiful.  Served this over the holidays and everyone who had a taste fell in love with it and wanted the recipe.  I followed instructions exactly except used parchment paper on the bottom of cake pans and chopped pecans between the layers along with the frosting.  Also placed whole pecan halfs for decoration on finished cake.  Just beautiful.

I loused this up from beginning to end but it still made us go YUM.  I have a "Perfect Chocolate Cake" recipe but this is far better and much easier.  I forgot the baking soda when I made this so had to do it all over and that left me short of sour cream for the frosting so I used a chocolate ganache instead.  I split and filled the layers with  Raspberry White Chocolate Mouse from this site. Skipped that raspberry sauce and made a coulis instead to drizzle over the whole thing.  Would use the mousse again for this but just serve on the side of the cake instead as after just a few minutes out of the fridge the cake started to slide. I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa.

Since some reviewers said it wasn't chocolatey enough, (and I like it really chocolatey) I added a tad more cocoa powder and a teaspoon of instant coffee powder. I was surprised at how runny the batter was. It dripped a little out the bottom of my springform pans. The cakes didn't rise much, and were a bit sunken in the middle, but I'm not sure whether that was the recipe or my fault. It tasted fantastic, and was super moist. I think if I make it again I'll reduce the sugar, leave off the icing, and just dust it with a bit of powdered sugar, as it was really, really sweet. Even my sugar-loving kids couldn't handle much of it.

This chocolate cake was excellent. The sour cream did add the pefect tang to the chocolate. The frosting was not too sweet. The cake was very very moist. I would recommend this recipe.

Thank you for the first perfect cake recipe I have ever found!  So rich, moist, beautiful, I could go on...
The batter looks wonderful baked in a jumbo muffin tray so that the finished mini-cakes can be turned over and frosted for personal desserts as well!

absolutely fantastic, everyone loved it!  I thought it had just the right amount of chocolate and everyone else who ate it agreed.  I didn't use the frosting, just the cake recipe.  I filled it with raspberry preserves and frosted with a vanilla frosting.  Fabulous!!

WOW...I made this cake for 17 family members on Thanksgiving. It was my first cake ever but I decided to give it a try. I personally DO NOT like chocolate cakes they are always dry. One right after another just raved and raved about the cake. My daughter had 5 slices and as soon as she woke up the next day she begged for more. At this point I never even tried it. I had to try what everyone was going nuts about. OMG!!! now I want another cake (only one little slice left were all fighting over) it was fantastic. Everyone wants me to make them thier own cake. It's so moist and fugdy. It truly is amazing and sooooo easy. I think it's impossible to mess up if "I" can make it. No one has ever liked something I've made so much before. Thank you SANDY! You have brought a big smile to alot of people.

I made this cake the day before thanksgiving, and was dissappointed with the frosting.  The cake itself was great; very moist.  Had to add more chocolate to the batter about 1/4 cp. to give it more chocolate flavor. When I drizzled it on the cake, it had a tang to it I didn't like.  When I ate a piece, it didn't compliment it at all. Next time, I'll use the recipe for chocolate frosting from the back of the Hershey's cocoa box.

Made this last night, making a special trip to the store to buy the "third" cake pan just for this recipe!  Glad I did, it was worth it and looks spectacular.  As one other reviewer stated, I regret skimping a little when frosting in between the layers.  I was thinking that I might run out of frosting.  I had leftovers.  Still tastes awesome though.  Very spongey.  I suggest mixing in the hot water with a wire whisk, it blends in easier. LOVE IT.

Made this for my husband's birthday (he is a chocoholic) and he loved it, he ate it for three days.  He is requesting it for his homecoming dinner (he's been away on business for three months now).  Originally, I used it with traditional store bought chocolate but next time am planning to use callebaut or valrhona chocolate bars and powder - that should make it exquisite.  Will definitely update and post a pic of the next cake.

If I could have given this 4.5 stars, I would have. Overall I thought this recipe was good, just not anything extraordinary. The cake just tasted like a normal chocolate cake to me, but the frosting was very very good. The addition of the sour cream into the frosting gave it a little "tang" which I thought was delicious. The only alteration I made was a made it a two layer cake (I only had to 9 inch pans!)..Oh and I accidently dumped the dry ingredients one by one into the wet mixture, stirred that, then added the sour cream. I dont know if that affected the overall taste of the cake or not (?) Overall, I dont know if I will be making this again..

I made this cake for my Mother-in-laws birthday. I used a heart shaped cake pan, and ended up with 4 layers. Inbetween the layers I put a layer of those chocolate mint thins when the cake was warm so they could melt slightly before putting the next layer on top.

This is by FAR the most delicious chocolate cake I've ever made, even without the mint, and I've made ALOT.

Very good: tender and moist.  I like to use coffee instead of water and bittersweet chocolate instead of unsweetened. Didn't use this icing recipe, however.  It melts in your mouth.

This was one of the better chocolate cake's I've made, however, we decided it needed something more to put it over the top. Hubby thought fudge would do the trick, while I think sliced strawberries would make it phenomenal. Very good though. 
FYI, I bought a 16oz sour cream so when I made the frosting I only had a little more than a third of a cup to use. It still tasted great and had a good consistancy. I also used two Hershey's Dark Chocolate bars for the semi'sweet chocolate.

Fantastic cake!  Rich, moist, dense, chocolatey...  I made it exactly as directed, and the cake turned out great.  For the frosting, I used 4 squares of unsweetened chocolate and 2 squares semi-sweet, and it was still plenty sweet... Next time, I'll use all unsweetened chocolate, because the frosting was a bit of a sugar overload.

You have to LOVE chocolate, but this is by far the best cake! Super moist! I didn't like the icing out of the bowl, way to sweet, but once on the cake it was very good.

This was the BEST cake.  Very rich but not too sweet.  I added a bit of Kahlua to the frosting...Yummm.  Also, I ran out of sour cream but substituted a bit of plain yogurt.  It made the icing a bit runny, but once cool it was perfect.  Must serve with ice cream!

Made a two layer cake and five-ish large cupcakes with this recipe. Frosted the cake with  combo of Hershey's Frosting (off the back of the can) and bought some triple chocolate fudge chunk frosting. My aunt loved it. With the cupcakes we put 3 musketeers in the center. They were really good and gone in about two seconds.

This cake is absolutely decadent!  I made it for my husband's birthday and he always wants chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and he devoured it.    I am not a chocoholic like my husband is, but I have also fallen in love with it when I have my occasional chocolate cravings.    It is fabulous - thanks so much for sharing!

Sandy, I am your biggest fan.  I got your recipe out of a Taste of Home cookbook a friend gave to me and your cake is unbelievable.  Everyone who has tried it loves it.  It was remarked to me that anything "this good has to be illegal". The best! Fantastic!

I agree that there was not enough chocolate taste-I even used high-quality cocoa in the batter. Even after refrigeration, the frosting was a little runny.

What a fantastic cake! I've done a bit of baking, but mostly bread and cheesecakes, so this was my first regular flour cake, and a layer one at that. I think I baked it a little less than 35 minutes. I used Hershey's dark chocolate powder as well, because I really like dark chocolate, and it was great. The frosting was delicious as well. I didn't ace the layering and frosting on the first try, but this was just a test cake for family to eat, so the presentation didn't really matter. I will definitely be using this again and again and again....

Not enough chocolate taste for me! Not a bad cake as a whole, it was somewhat moist and baked up well, but if you closed your eyes and took a bite you wouldn't even know it was chocolate!!!

I made this cake for about 200 people (at the request of my mom) and it was a hit.  Everyone loved it!!! I'm new at baking so it was even more impressive.  I received quite a few "This is the best cake I ever had" comments.  Because I was baking for such a big group I started baking a couple of days in advance, I wrapped the cakes up and kept them in the fridge, they were still wonderfully moist and delicious.

This is one of my favorite cakes to make!  It is wonderful . I am planning to make it for my adult twin daughters next week!  I do add hot brewed coffee for the boiling water...other than that I go right by the recipe.  I make chocolate shavings to garnish the top and it is a beautiful cake.

The cake is moist but I would cut back on the flour next time and add a little more cocoa instead to get a richer chocolate taste. 
The frosting is different, tangy. 
Cut recipe in half and bake 3x 6" layers.

Just made this cake for the 10th time. It never goes wrong. We make a double layer cake with a dozen cupcakes each time. Use our own frosting depending on the flavor the kids are craving. Delicious.

This is a good basic moist chocolate cake.  Easy to make with basic ingredients.  The icing on the other hand needs to be followed precisely.  I decided to use yogurt instead of sour cream.  MAJOR mistake!  I have a huge bowl of runny icing which will require each person to drizzle on their individual piece.  I am assuming if the frosting recipe is followed exactly you may have good results.  This is why I give it a 4 instead of 5.

Followed this recipe exactly and it looked great coming out of the oven I was so excited for family to eat it based on all the positive reviews, but I was hugely disappointed by the taste.  Don't know how this was rated so highly.  It is a dry cake and lacked a good chocolate taste.  Will not make again.

This is the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten.  It is moist and choclately and it pairs really well with the frosting.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated (using butter) and it came out perfectly.  In fact, I have made it 3 times now and each time it has met all expectations.  People even request it now for family events!

This cake is excellent but not the typical chocolate cake you might expect. I was surprised by the taste at first since it was not overwhelmingly sweet but my family absolutely loved it.

Have made it and it is the best tasting chocolate cake. It is moist and lots of chocolate flavor w/o it being sweet. I always get tons of compliment and recipe request for it. I live 10,000ft above sea level so it is a challenge to make this. You have to have a great oven that can retain constant heat (my husband have a 5-star stove). Turn off the convection. Other than that, I just bake them in two separate 9-in round pans and followed the recipe. I used a different frosting. It was too sweet and grainy for me. I used this one: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/rich-chocolate-frosting-2/detail.aspx
That frosting just taste like a chocolate truffle.

This cake is amazing. But I didn't use the frosting. So no review on that. However, every time I make the cake, there are always compliments.

This is the fluffiest, most moist and most delicious chocolate cake I've ever tasted, not just made.  Just melts in your mouth.  I haven't made the frosting though since I'm not a fan of frosting, but the cake was fantastic.

I really enjoyed the texture of this cake.  It was very easy to work with.  I wasn't knocked out by the chocolate flavor - I would not describe it as "rich" by any means - but one can always up the chocolate quotient with mix ins.  This cake can stand up to it.

This review is just based on the cake:
Very good! The brown sugar must add something to the cake because it has a wonderful flavor. I'm usually unimpressed my most chocolate cake recipes, because they just don't taste right very often, but this one has definitely got the right idea! Next time I may add more cocoa to get an even deeper chocolate flavor, but I really liked the taste of this cake. Will definitely try again!

This was a delicious chocolate cake! I used a premade frosting because I was short on ingredients, but the cake itself was moist with the perfect crumb texture in my opinion.

This was my first time making a cake from scratch, and it turned out great.  The cake itself is really good.  It's nice and moist and tastes great.  However, the frosting is extremely sweet, so I would recommend only taking small pieces if you use this frosting.  I have a huge sweet tooth, and even I had a hard time finishing my piece because of the frosting.

OMG WOW!!! I am a full-time baker/cake decorator and therefore usually immune to cake, but even I couldnt keep my hands out of this one! I reduced the serving size to 9 which easily filled a 9x13 pan. The only change I made was to sub 1 cup buttermilk + 1/3 cup butter (microwave 30 sec and mix) for the sour cream.
Baked in a glass pan even the edges came out soft and fluffy and cutting it was a dream. It was dense but still moist and fluffy and this will definitely become my go-to chocolate cake for shaped cakes! 
thank you so much for sharing!!

Tasted slightly flat to me, I will add 1/4 tsp. more salt next time.  I might also try with extra dark cocoa.  There will definately be a next time...the texture was divine!
I followed the recipe exactly, you're really onto something here Sandy.  Thanks for sharing!

This cake SHOULD NOT be ruined with frosting.  I PROMISE that it is moist, dense yet spongy, and perfectly sweet  by itself -- simply incredible.  I bake it in a tube pan with the 9-serving alterations and bake for 50 minutes instead of 35 (required for a tube pan). You will thank yourself for taking the time to bake this.  The frosting recipe is only okay -- again I PROMISE!!!!

This cake has a really good flavor, however, it's very delicate to make and every time I make it, I get different results. It either comes out wonderful and fluffy OR it comes out very dense, almost like a brownie. Can't figure out why. One time I used exact same ingredients and baked them in two different pans one after another because both won't fit in my oven on the same rack. One layer came out wonderful, another layer was very dense. The frosting is wonderful, though!

Everyone who has EVER, and I mean ever tried this cake when I make it LOVES it! Even if they say "well I really don't like chocolate, or cake, or chocolate cake." (I know, who knew those people existed!)  I do use hot coffee in place of boiling water, really sets off the chocolate flavor, but does not give a true coffee flavor (some may be able to taste it, but not many).  This is a favorite among family, friends, and co-workers.

This cake should get way more love than it has, even though it's gotten a lot of love. It is so amazing and velvety and soft. God. I love it. I wish I were eating a piece right now. 

This is one of maybe 7 or 10 recipes that I would not change AT ALL. It's so moist and beautiful. Truly an amazing cake. Thank you so much for sharing it, Sandy!

Cake was ok, using hershey chocolate bar might of tasted better.  Didn't care for the frosting, ready made would of been better.

Big Hit with the family. Keep in mind this is not a light fluffy cake - this is a rich, rather dense cake with a marvelous crumb and moist texture. It was so nice to find a recipe that doesn't rely on coffee to give it the deep chocolate flavor imparted by the cocoa. (Ya THINK?) I did make frosting but served it separately because this cake really doesn't need it! This is our "go to" chocolate cake recipe with no modifications.

Simple triple layered chocolate cake... what more do you want?  In terms of the cake sticking to the pan, I used parchment paper, oil, and flour, and I had no issues getting it out of the pan after the allotted cool off time.  For the frosting, some reviewers stated it was too sweet, the easiest way to tailor the frosting to your liking is to adjust how much powdered sugar you add.  I only added four cups instead of the five, and everybody loved it.

I love to make things from scratch and this cake came out wonderful! Be sure to coat the pans extra heavy! I used glass pyrex pans and 2 stuck while the last one came out smoothly after i super duper coated it with real butter and flour. for the recipe- I used Swans cake flour instead of normal flour.  It came out light and fluffy and moist! Wasnt crazy about the icing- a little too sweet- so I made a marshmallow icing instead- but since i already made the choc icing i used that in the layers and the marshmallow icing for the outside of the cake.  I used Rachel Rays Recipe and used 1/2 the sugar it called for, for a less sweetness. The cake is very sweet within itself so I think it needs a mild tasting icing to compliment it- The cake turned out delicious- In fact, Im making it again tomorrow! I read a review on here that used Cannoli Filling- So i will try using this to layer the cakes then use the rest of the marshmallow icing on top

Wonderful recipe!  I resized this for 9 servings to fit my two 9 inch rounds.  They dropped beautifully out of the pans and were so level, I didn't need to shave any off at all for layering them.  I made this cake with Cream Cheese Frosting ll from allrecipes instead of the chocolate frosting.  SO yummy!  This will be my standby chocolate cake recipe from now on.

Very moist, chocolately cake. Will definitely make again. 

The frosting is VERY sweet, a little too much for my taste, and I found that making a raspberry sauce and adding it on top of the frosting made the cake absolutely perfect. I've gotten requests to make the cake for others already!

This cake is simply orgasmic! Light and fluffy with a rich taste. The kind of cocoa you use will also make a BIG difference, I used a fair trade organic cocoa that has a full chocolate taste, Fry's cocoa is not real cocoa in my books. Try also using melted dark chocolate. I used dark brown sugar instead of a light brown sugar and only put 1 tsp of vanilla. This made for a more balanced aroma. Way to go Sandra!!! and thank you for sharing it with the world! This is my Valentine's cake and all time cake!

This is the first time I've ever made cake from scratch. I made it for my husband's birthday. We all loved it. My husband usually only takes a small sliver of cake at parties. He tried this and went back for more. The cake is so moist and the frosting tastes like pudding made from hot chocolate. Yummm!!!!

Best chocolate cake I've had in a very long time. Frosting was very good also, not over sweet as most frostings or icings can be. Cake is moist and dense, but light to.

This cake is perfect!  I made it for a family gathering this past weekend and everyone just loved it.  I followed another person's review and only made half of the recipe and found it was more than enough for a bunt cake, I baked it for 50mins and it was perfect, just perfect!  Thank you!

This review is for the cake only.....Exceptional!!!! I followed Sandy's recipe without any variations. So rich and moist...I literally just served this for Thanksgiving dessert and the 5 stars speak for themselves. I've seen the reviews about the cake sticking to the pan. I did not have that problem..I used Baker's Joy and allowed the cake to completely cool in pan. Because of the reviews regarding the frosting, I chose to use Wilton's Chocolate Butter Cream Frosting with this splendid cake..It was an absolute masterpiece....I will continue to make this cake over and over again. Thanks Sandy for sharing this!!!!!

Amazing! My favorite chocolate cake recipe yet. Moist and decadent. I think the key is really creaming the butter/sugar. The only adjustment I made was from 1T baking soda to 2tbaking soda and 1t baking powder. The cocoa I had was a blend of dutch and regular. Google it if you're not sure!!

Thanks!

Reviewing cake only, used the almost professional buttercream. Would give the cake a ten if i could. Will add chocolate chips to the batter next time for little surprises.

This cake is oh sooo good! It has a rich chocolate taste, and the texture is just moist and delicious. I made this cake twice. Since I had Dutch processed cocoa, i was a bit concerned, because it's alkalinized, so I was about to omit the baking soda altogether, but i couldn't leave it be, so i substituted it for baking powder- wrong move! the cake didn't rise. So the second time around i had the same Dutch processed cocoa and added baking soda, and it rose to perfection! Moral of the story, follow the recipe ;)

This is an awesome recipe.I modified it a bit by adding 2 small mashed bananas and substituting the sour cream with unsweetened yoghurt.I replaced the frosting with chocolate made from good cocoa and orange juice cooked with granulated sugar(syrup).Then a sprinkle of sesame seeds on to finish.It was a hit!
Thanks Sandy!!!

I am in love! Made this for my 5 year old's birthday. I haven't even eaten any of the cake (but I made cupcakes and had one of those, so same difference.) The party is tomorrow and I think it will be a hit! I used a different frosting recipe because I didn't have enough sour cream. It's delicious nonetheless.

The cake was so good. Very moist and great flavor. The icing however left we wanting something more.  I will make the cake again but will look for a new icing recipe.

This is a really good chocolate cake recipe!  It's really light, tastes like milk chocolate and not super rich.  I made cupcakes out of the recipe and frosted them with the Peanut Butter Frosting recipe.  They were topped off with a mini Reese PB cup.  These taste just like a PB cup...  They were a hit for my son on his 12th birthday!

I made this recipe into cupcakes and decided not to frost them.  I thought the texture of the cake was sublime and, for the most part, the flavor was wonderful too.  My only complaint is that I was missing richness coming from the chocolate flavor.
Next time I make this recipe (and yes it was good enough to make again) I think I'm going to add 1 cup of cocoa powder, which also may mean adding either more sour cream of more boiling water.  I haven't quite figured the exact ratios yet, but I'll get back to you!

This cake is amazing!  I have made this cake over and over again with great reviews.  Everyone counts on me to bring this cake to the party.  The quality of the chocolate/cocoa you use will effect the taste of the cake.  I strictly use dark/good quality chocolate and it is fantastic.  Don't overcook it or it will be dry.

This is the best chocolate cake ever. I am so picky about cake but this one gets my seal of approval. I sometimes try it with vanilla frosting instead.

I'm not a professional baker, by any stretch of the imagination, but I do enjoy baking and have some knack for it. Because of that, my cousin asked me to make the cake for her wedding and the only instruction I had to go on was she wanted chocolate. I made this cake along with a few others, including a classic chocolate from some fancy-shmancy baker's recipe book, and this was unanimously everyone's favorite.  We've nicknamed it the "Chocolate Cookie Cake" and my cousin could not be more excited that this will be her cake on her wedding day.  I'm using a hazelnut whipped cream frosting I made up instead of the recipe listed here and the only change I made to the cake recipe was to eliminate the salt altogether (including using unsalted butter) due to dietary restrictions, but other than that, it was moist, rich, and filled with chocolatey goodness.  So incredibly happy I found this recipe!!  I originally intended to make a "death by chocolate" cake but it got screwed up the day of the tasting and I didn't have all the ingredients I needed to remake it so I had to scramble to find another recipe just based on what I had at home. THANK GOD I did because that's how I found this!!  Everything happens for a reason, right?

I've made this a few times, and I keep coming back to it because it's hands down the best chocolate cake I've ever made. Re: cake not releasing - go back and review your basic greasing/flouring skills. It may help to do this in addition to using a non-stick pan. The only alteration I've made is to use Dutch-processed cocoa powder from Penzey's... it produces a richer flavor without the bitterness from regular cocoa. I also use their bourbon vanilla, Kerrygold unsalted Irish butter, and King Arthur unbleached cake flour. And love. Any recipe you make just comes out better if you put a little love behind it.

I've just used this recipe to make cupcakes. What can I say? It was delish! I followed the recipe exactly, baked them for about 15-17 minutes, and it worked really well! They came out moist, chocolatey and dense! Will keep using this!

I made this for my sons 2nd birthday party. It was easy to make a day ahead, super moist. I used a shaped cake pan so I ended up with enough batter left over to make 6 large cupcakes. I didnt have semisweet chocolate so I used gharadelli double chocolate baking chocolate in the frosting. On the cake did a layer of peanut butter under the frosting. The cupcakes without the peanut butter were chocolaty but it wasnt a strong choc taste that I was expecting, the PB really brought out the choc flavor.

I didn't try the frosting, however the cake itself was excellent AND easy.  Like others have mentioned, the batter *is* really runny, but it bakes to be extremely moist and stays delicious for a couple of days.  We used chocolate fudge buttercream on these for cupcakes - they baked for ~22 minutes.

AMAZING!!!!!!    Best cake I have ever had! Everyone loved how rich, moist and chocolatey it was. We were about  a quarter cup short on sour cream, so we used some plain yougurt instead. Other wise would not change a thing.

This is the best chocolate cake I have ever made, and possibly the best I've ever tasted. Everyone who tries it loves it, and many have asked for the recipe, often adding in, "IF you're willing to share." This cake never fails to get rave reviews no matter where I take it. The frosting recipe given here is very nice, but I think we actually prefer to use the Wilton Chocolate Buttercream recipe found on the Wilton website.

Just used this as a birthday cake. It was a huge hit! And then I decided to try some myself, and wow, easily the best cake I can ever remember eating. Also, it's so simple to make, even without a mixer (need a strong forearm). Thank you for sharing this recipe Sandy!

The cake is very moist and tasty.  The icing however has a little sour taste to it.  I may well make the cake again, but will try a different icing.

This is the best from-scratch cake I have ever made, and I have made too many from-scratch cakes to count.  This is BETTER than the best boxed cake mix.  The only trouble I had was getting it out of the pan.  I'm going shopping in a couple days and I plan to pick up some Baker's Joy - it has never failed me in the past.
Thank you, Sandy!

This cake turned out fabulous!   For those folks that have problem with the cake sticking, it's worth it to invest in Wilton's Cake Release.   You can buy a bottle of it at almost any craft store or decorette shop that carries cake supplies.

Best sour cream chocolate cake ever!!!  This will not disappoint. I used cake flour for an even smoother texture and got rave reviews.

Excellent cake.  Three layers impresses everyone.  And the cake and frosting compliment each other very well.  I've made this many times.  Thanks Sandy!

This cake was absolutely fantastic! I did everything the recipe said, except I did add a few shakes of coca powder to the frosting.  I also used Hershey's Special Dark Baking Cocoa.  The cake also improves as the flavors settle over a few days.  My husband said it was the best birthday cake he's ever had!!

This chocolate cake was simply amazing. I cut the recipe down to 9 servings and still got three cake layers. Instead of frosting, I made a cherry filling to separate the three layers and frosted with a chocolate recipe found elsewhere on this site.   The cake has a wonderful chocolate aroma and a beautiful texture. My husband thought it was very rich, and I agree, but it's that delicious richness that makes you go back to it again and again and crave it after it is all gone. This will definitely be my new go-to chocolate cake. I can't wait to make it for company...

AMAZING....I have 2 amazing chocolate cake recipes now... but I will be using this one more because its the cake my husband and I luv...fudgey and delicious... and because it's 3 amazing layers of chocolatey goodness.... soo the only this I did differently was use 1\2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup whipping cream in the frosting because i ran out of sour cream. I also added 3/4 c. of cocoa in the frosting and only used 4 c. icing sugar... tastes wonderful.... THis is a great recipe.... thanks sandy.

Every time I make it, it is exactly what chocolate cake should be. So much better than a box.  I have not tried the frosting, but the cake is superb!  This is the only chocolate cake recipe I use now.

by far the best chocolate cake i have tried so far on this site. i made three layers they all were perfect.(no huge humps) i think the key to this cake being nice and fluffy or fudgy and dense is to make sure you beat your cake after each egg addition until it is nice and fluffy. frosting was great.

I didn't make the frosting for this, but only because I didn't want to have to refrigerate the cake (no room right now!) so I used store bought frosting.  The frosting sounds really good though!  I'm not a chocolate lover, and the cake was plenty chocolate for me.  However, everyone seemed to enjoy.  Everyone wanted HUGE slices of this, so not everyone finished theirs, but everyone seemed to enjoy it so it counts as a winner in my book.  Bf's sister in law told me I could send her baked goods anytime.  :o)  I decorated  with strawberries and they were a good complement to the chocolate. Thanks for the recipe!

The cake itself was about 8 stars.  Perfect chocolate cake in every way.  The icing was just way too sweet, even for me.  I will make the cake again next time I need a chocolate cake, but use a different frosting recipe, perhaps a buttercream.

I was very excited to try this cake and while the texture came out very light, for some odd reason it tasted kinda artificial to me. Which is very bizarre. I have made many chocolate cakes and unfortunately I probably won't be making this one again.  For me, it was just ok, nothing more. Certainly not the kind I would feel good serving.

Very, very tasty! This was my first three-layer cake and it was a success! Though the frosting was a little tangy for my taste (perhaps due to the sour cream), everyone thought it complimented the cake wonderfully. I was a little short on frosting but I did manage to cover the entire cake. Next time I'll probably 1 1/2 the frosting recipe. Topped it with chopped semisweet chocolate chunks and curls.

i made cupcakes out of the batter. turned out very fluffy. i didn't have confectioner's sugar so i used regular sugar and the icing turned out crunchy. if you like fluffy cake, you'll like this. i prefer more moist cakes.

Excellent recipe! I reduced the serving size to 9 servings. I was able to bake in in 9x13 dish (about 35 minutes). Used a different frosting recipe from this website. Cake was still very moist the next day.

This is an awesome recipe that my sister found and has now become a family favourite! The first time she made it she forgot to add the water and it came out like scrumptious brownies....but with the water, its one of the most divine chocolate cakes we've had!

This is the most wonderously delicious chocolate cake that I have ever tasted.  I know it's a little thing, I mean, in the grand scheme of things, chocolate cakes aren't very significant, but I really think that you have enriched the world in this little way! Thank you so much for your generosity in sharing it with us! :)

I don't get to eat this cake, since I'm giving it away.  But, I nibbled a piece and the flavor was perfect - chocolate-y and moist.  But, the thing I was most impressed about was the look of it.  All three of my rounds were PERFECT - no hump in the middle, no breaking when taking out of the pan - and my oven is not known for greatness!  Good job Sandy!  I'm using Rick's Buttercream and Plastic Chocolate to decorate.

OK cake but not the best I have ever made.  It was terrible trying to get it out of the pans (I used butter and flour on the pans) however I used 2 9x9" pans, so perhaps that made the difference.  Besides that it was a nice cake but didn't have the depth of flavor that I like in a chocolate cake.

This is now my "go to" recipe for chocolate cake.  By far, the best cake that I've ever had.  I did not change anything about this recipe, it is perfect the way it is.

I bake cakes as a side job and this is my go to recipe! It is moist days later!! I used to have this recipe in my Hershey chocolate coverlover book and was exicted to find it again!! People always ask me if this is a deluxe professional cake mix becuase it is so light and moist! Love this ... change nothing.. ok add a little vanilla :)

I love this recipe and use it all the time for Birthday and Wedding cakes...The only change I always make is to substitute Strong Hot Coffee for the water. The coffee really helps intensify the chocolate flavor. Sometimes for a little extra flair I use ready made vanilla or chocolate cream cheese filling between the layers...peanut butter mousse filling is very good too... Great recipe it really deserves more than 5 stars..

Awesome awesome awesome recipe!  This is my first review on allrecipes, and i am on this site evryday-- this cake is that good!  I used coffee instead of the water, and did 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup heavy cream.  Other than that left everything as is, and it was phenomenal.  Planning on making this for my grandma's 70th birthday cake.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This was fantastic, my husband request this for his birthday now..I've made it for my 5 year old.  I was nervous with the boiling water part, but everything turned out great.  I put the cake in the fridge to let it sit so it wouldn't mold fast in florida; but you shouldn't.  Let it sit at room temperature a couple days then move it to the fridge. Cake harden in the fridge.

As many of the other reviews indicated this is indeed a very moist cake. It's not too sweet and has a great chocolaty flavour. I think it is best served a day or two after baking. Frosted with chocolate buttercream...DELICIOUS!!

I read through the reviews and decided to make the cake exactly as directed.  I made the frosting while the cakes were baking and freaked out when I tasted it, quite sour and not typical, but since I was out of powdered sugar I carried on.  You do have to beat the frosting for a while to get it to thicken up enough.  I finished making the cake and it sat in the fridge overnight for a birthday party the next day and the flavors had mellowed and combined with the cake very nicely.  That strong sour taste alone disapears and compliments the chocolate once all put together.  It is a dense cake, but everyone at the party enjoyed it.  I'll keep making my choc. cake from Epicurious for those that like a lighter crumb chocolate cake, but for the real chocoholics, this is a keeper.

The frosting is to die for! However, the cake seemed only average for the amount of time and energy it takes. I will definitely keep the frosting recipe and go back to my Hershey's Deep Dark Chocolate Cake.

I gave this cake a 5 star because the cake itself was really really good. The frosting I did not care for, nor did most of the people who tried it. For the cake I only had 1 cup of sour cream and it still ended up being super moist and delicious.

Very good cake. Looks and tasted like the cake came from a high end pastry shop. Cake and frosting our not overly sweet so some children may say it tastes weird. Adults appreciate the unique taste more than children.

One of my co-workers made this cake for a holiday party and everyone RAVED about it, including me and made sure to grab seconds!! I asked where the recipe was from and I'm so glad I have it now so I can make it at home. This cake was soooooo good!! The cake itself and the icing. YUM! I would recommend this recipe to anyone who is a fan of chocolate cake.  Thank you for sharing! :-)

I first made this cake at my sons birthday party last year and it was a HUGE success. It was so moist and yummy! Since then our family has requested this cake when they visit and at my other 2 kids' parties. I use this recipe anytime I need a an awesome chocolate cake for a special event and it has not failed me yet. The recipe doubles well too. I had to double it for my sons b-day cake b/c I was cutting the Autobot symbol out of a 16" round cake pan. I had enough batter for that cake and another small (maybe 6"?)pan. I adjusted the cooking time to accomodate the larger pan, it worked perfectly and released from the pan with no problems. Haven't tried the frosting yet though, each time I have made this I have decorated the cake for a theme, will make it one day for just us so I can try it.

MMMMMMMM  I made this cake in a 10x15 (bigger than the typical 9x13) sheet-cake pan (layer cakes intimidate me) and used some of the suggestions made by other reviewers: I substituted coffee for the boiling water and  upped the cocoa by a quarter-cup (bringing it to a full cup).  I was put off by the soupy nature of the batter when i poured it into the pan, but the cake rose just fine (although not very high in the center).  I ended up leaving it in the oven for an extra ten minutes (and it probably could've used another ten).  I didn't alter the frosting recipe at all, and it made a somewhat thick layer across the top of my cooled cake.  All in all, a very chocolatey, moist cake -- a hit at an office party today marking the departure of a dear colleague who had requested a chocolate cake (he took the leftovers home).

I can't say this chocolate cake was out of this world...  Just like any other chocolate cake.  I made cup cakes that I dressed up for fall.  Topped with orange colored frosting that I sprinkled toasted coconut on and a candy corn pumpkin.  Very Cute!

This is a really wonderful cake.  Made it for my husbands birthday recently, he loved the cake, although not too fond of the icing.  The icing is too sour.  Next time I will try another icing, maybe butter creme with this cake.  Thanks for a great cake recipe.

This is by far one of my absolute favorite recipes. I have made this over and over again because my family and friends love it!  This cake is so good, you can eat it without the frosting (which we have also done)!  I often put chocolate chips in it and make different types of frostings for it.  It is delightful with a white, orange flavored frosting! I also half the recipe sometimes in order to make a smaller cake because it sure does make a lot of cake.

For my first baked-from-scratch cake, this turned out excellent! I took the advice of substituting the water with coffee, which really brought out the rich flavors. The subtle sour cream flavor in the frosting also added a nice touch. This will definitely be my go-to birthday cake recipe!

This recipe is wonderful. I didn't have sour cream so substituted a plain yogurt. For the icing, I didn't have all the ingredients so instead used the Rich Chocolate Frosting recommended by another reviewer. My husband was crazy about this cake. After all these years, we've found our chocolate cake recipe. This is it. I doubt that I'll try another.

the cake is awesome. If you make it just as the directions say you get a wonderfully chocolate cake that is slightly dense and very moist. My only complaint was the frosting. Everyone felt that it was just to sour. Next time I will use a chocolate buttercream.

This recipe makes about 40 cupcakes.  Before putting them in the oven I let them rest about 15 minutes (after pouring them into the paper cups) because this produces a higher, fluffier cupcake.

Terrific recipe!  And the frosting is great too!

This cake is perfect and wonderful... On occasion I play around with ratio of unsweetened chocolate vs. semisweet for the frosting, and also the amount of vanilla I use in both the cake and the frosting.  This is my favorite cake to bake and certainly the most satisfying.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

Easily 5 stars for this cake recipe. It is the one and only from scratch chocolate cake recipe I need. I made it as cupcakes and as a 13"x9" cake and it hasn't let me down.

I made this cake for my mother's birthday earlier this month and I have to say this is the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted! I used cool whip between the layer and a chocolate gonach on top and everyone thought I had bought the cake from a bakery and pulling a fast one on them! lol This is a big keeper. Thank you!!!

Wish I could have given this more than 5 stars because it was great!  Do not know what happen to those that said it was dry as mine turned out very moist.  I did not use the frosting as I did not think I would like the sour cream in it; instead I used the Rich Chocolate Frosting (real butter, powdered sugar, milk...) and it was yummy.  I made the 3 layers plus a couple cupcakes.  I froze the cake for the coming weekend, ate the cupcakes and now can't wait for more.

I made this cake about a year ago for my husbands birthday.  This is the first cake I have ever made completely from scratch before.  It was great and very rich!  His family of chocolate lovers loved it too!

Delicious.  Very dense and rich...but the perfect moist cake  I made this for when my in-laws came to visit...they all loved, even my husband liked it (and he's not a chocolate fan)  Thought the sour cream was weird...but gives the frosting a fantastic flavor!  One of my favorites now...

i have baked this cake twice in  2 weeks with rave reviews.  I altered it slightly:  1) I used special dark cocoa 2) after baking it the first time and having the overflow problem like so many others, I spread it over 4 pan which made perfect layers and no mess 3) I used maybe half the amount of hot water  4)I added a "secret" ingredient to both the cake and frosting: a few dashes of cinnamon; it's not enough to register in the flavor, but adds a nice complexity and depth.

hands down the best chocolate cake recipe.  Always grease and flour the pans before baking.  Any spot that does not have flour may stick! I have tried every recipe out there and this is the best.

Very good ! This is my first made from scratch cake I've ever made or even tasted for that matter. It was really good although I've only had store brought cake so I'm not sure how cake is really suppose to taste. This was really moist but dense. My hubby thought it was brownies at first. Is that how it is suppose to be or did I go wrong somewhere lol.

This cake is beautiful and easy. I'm not sure I like the semisweet chocolate in the icing, but that's just an opinion. It does go nicely with the not-to-sweet cake. Thanks for the recipe!

On taste alone this would be a five star, no doubt.  My problem was that the recipe rises quite tall, but then the middle falls deep down, making it impossible to use as a cake.  I even tried it as cupcakes, but the same thing happened--a deep well in the middle.  If someone can help me remedy this I would be very appreciative.

This cake was just your average chocolate cake. It's not worth the slaving away in the kitchen, you might as well go buy a store cake. It needs a lot more chocolate flavor - I would suggest using semisweet chocolate chips for moisture and flavor. Yum!

Just Decadent! It was my first attempt at a chocolate cake. It came out moist, not light and airy, almost a Fudgy flavor, I got so many complements on this Cake! The three layers came out so perfectly from the pans! I didn't make the icing on this recipe, I used a peanut butter icing on mine. The cake was just sublime!

The cake was excellent but I thought the frosting was too heavy for this cake.  A lighte frosting would have been better.  I thought I was going to go into sugar shock with this.

Wow! This is a little more time consuming than some other cakes but it is well worth the effort. It is so moist, dense, and delicious. I did not change a thing and it was great. The best part was the icing and I was surprised with the addition of sour cream. This is now one of my favorite frostings, with or without the chocolate because it has the perfect amount of sweetness and goes well with anything.

The frosting was great - not too sweet with a bit of tang from the sour cream.  The cake was dry - I wonder what I did wrong?  Baked up nicely though - no high domes which makes frosting easier.

Mmmm this cake was so good!  I cut the recipe in half and used two squares of unsweetened chocolate in place of the cocoa.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan for about 25 minutes.  I did not try the frosting but used a butter cream frosting from this site.  The only problem that I had was that the cake came out kind of 'wet' but maybe that is because I put the frosting on while it was still hot (next time I will be patient!).  Will definitely make this again.

Update - made again as cupcakes (still using the unsweetened chocolate).  I let them cool completely before adding the frosting this time and they turned out perfect.

I baked this in two 9x13 pans and filled it with vanilla pudding and strawberries. It worked really well; I made vanilla pudding from the box (with less milk to make it thicker) and mixed it with dices strawberries and spread it in the center before putting on the second layer and frosting the entire thing. The cake was still good and moist, even when a change in circumstances resulted in the cake sitting out for most of the day, then overnight in the fridge. The next afternoon it was still delicious.

This cake was FANTASTIC!  It had a rich chocolate flavor, moist and dense.  The recipe calls for 9 inch pans, I only had 8 inch.  I was able to make four layers instead of three.  What I did was make a two layer cake because three layers would not fit in my cake saver.  I froze the other two layers for later use, two cakes for the work of one.  I also frosted it with a peanut butter frosting because that’s my favorite flavor combination.

This is the best chocolate cake I've ever made.  I made no changes to the ingredients and the cake came out perfect.  It is dense, but a little light.  The taste is unbeliveable when combined with the "Rich Chocolate Frosting" recipe from this website.  I recently made this for a church dinner and it was a hit.  The only change I did do was to bake it in a 9X13 pan.  It did rise quite a bit, so be careful.  I actually had enough batter left to make 4 "tester" cupcakes.

Best chocolate cake ever.  I have made this at least 10 times.   A winner every time.   Some reviewers have had a problem with this super moist cake sticking to the pan. I use very high quality cake pans and never have any sticking. If you bake a lot of cakes, they are worth the investment.

The cake was delicious. Follow the directions accordily. The cake was a hit. I made it for a food day at work and they love it. It was so GOOD that i had to make it again. The only diffence was the first time I made it on total electrial stove and the second time gas stove. Big Difference!! The cake didn't rise as high and it taste different. Total electrical is the way to go. GREAT RECIPE !!!

this is a really great cake. flavour, texture and presentation. anyway, i made the mistake of not putting parchment paper at the bottom of the pan the first two rounds. so one of my layers fell apart and the other had a gaping hole in it. =(. but good thing the last layer turned out perfect. =). can't give it 5 yet cos i stuffed it in the fridge and am not really sure whether it'll turn hard! (i live in a really hot country, not wise to let the frosting melt in this kind of weather) im quite worried cos it's for a birthday celebration tmr. so any idea if i can put it in the fridge? haha.

I wanted to make cupcakes with this recipe.  The batter was delicious but I had to throw all the cupcakes away!  They sunk in the middle and were so crusty/crunchy on the edges.  Maybe I will try again if I am making a regular round cake.

Super good recipe!  Made 24 cupcakes - topped with my own vanilla buttercream.  I did cut down on the sugar, but after tasting them, will definitely put the full amount into the mix. 
Very moist and super chocolatey (if that's a word? ha!) Will keep this as my staple "from scratch" chocolate cake recipe!

Wow...as I sit here eating my second slice, I cannot stop raving about how light and moist this cake is!!  I used to use another chocolate cake recipe I had found on this site - it was a good one and my hubby always requested it - until he tried this today.  I believe this is now our new favorite!  I'm not a big fan of the icing - it's a little too sour cream-y for me - but the cake is amazing!!

Simply delicious!  I've never made a cake that called for sour cream before, but it was perfect.  Everyone says it was the best cake I ever made.  I wouldn't change a thing!

Wow.  I don't like cake, typically.  I made this because I saw the ratings were high and needed a cake from scratch for a potty training reward.  Yes, we have potty parties in our family.  But I digress.  

I greased the pans and floured them as I always do and they came out perfectly (which is rare for me).  I think the key factor was cooking the cake a little extra time.  The kids distracted me when the timer went off, so I'd say it was about 5 minutes longer in a convection oven.  When I pulled the cakes out, I thought initially that they were burned.  Maybe, but I can't be sure.  But I think a little extra oven time improves the structural integrity.

I boiled the water in the microwave, but I made sure time didn't elapse between boiling and pouring into the batter.  That might solve one of the previous reviewer's questions.

The frosting though is a little tricky.  The part about letting the chocolate and butter cool (and the cakes, obviously) is pretty key.  The warmer the frosting gets, the less stable it is.  And mine just barely held together.  Next time I will keep the sour cream and the powdered sugar in the fridge while melting the chocolate, just to keep things as cool as possible.   But the taste is OUT OF THIS WORLD!  It's so rich, so not for the faint of heart.  

THIS CAKE PLEASES.

Deeelicious! I used two big layers and filled with bavarian cream and strawberries, then frosted with the recipe's frosting. The frosting is heavenly, i could just eat it by itself!

As a novice cake decorator I bring in a lot of cakes into work – about 1 per week. When I brought this chocolate cake in with a simple chocolate frosting I received rave reviews. After adding the boiling water the batter seems WAY too runny but magically it all works out. Based on how many people loved it, I think this will be my chocolate cake recipe forever.

Absolutely the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever found and I have been looking a long time!  I have made it a dozen times and never had any problems.  I did not make the frosting as I have already found a perfect frosting.

Great cake and frosting! Tasted like a box mix only better and all homemade ingredients. The frosting was very homemade tasting. I added 1/2 tsp. of lemon juice to give it a little contrast and loved it. The cake was very moist and fluffy, just loved the flavor.I made this for my son's first birthday and it was wonderful and everybody loved it! Thank-you!

I teach food and nutrition to high school students.  One of my classes made this recipe (omiting the icing)and it was the best cake I have ever eaten.  Moist, wonderful chocolate flavor, light and fluffy, just amazing!  However, the next class' results were just awful!  Watered down, flour tasting, bland.  UGH!!  I did adjust the second classes recipe (it is a smaller class)so, that may have had something to do with it.  However, my first class added the 1 1/3 cup of water to a pot to boil then added it to the batter and my second class microwaved a bowl of water then measured the amount they needed.  The results were a watered down mess that didnt rise.  I, personally, think that was the cause.

This is the first cake I've made from scratch and it turned out beautifully. I made this for my Grandma for her birthday. Finished making the cake moments before we left for her house and it held up very well. Next time I make this I'll be a little more liberal when applying the frosting. It was a little thin between the layers and I had a cup of frosting left over. My husband who doesn't eat cake had a huge piece. That's saying a lot! I've never seen people ask if they can take some of the cake home with them and it happened that night. It was really good. Thank you Sandy for sharing!

WOW!! This cake is outstanding. It's dense and extremely moist, and holds a ton of chocolate flavor. I made it for my mother in law's birthday, and even those who claimed they didn't like cake LOVED this cake. Will absolutely add this to my recipe collection. Thank you!

I made cupcakes out of this and they were pretty good. They were a little eggy. Also lacking in flavor a little, but the extremely chocolatey frosting made up for that. The batter looked so good until I added the water (wierd!!) - then it was liquidey. Maybe next time I'll try without the water.

The cake is very good and moist, bakes evenly although the flavor isn't that compelling.  The frosting is amazing, though.  However, be warned: using standard ingredients called for in this recipe, the total cake is about 10,000 calories - so eat small portions!  Also consider using low-fat sour cream, using 3/4 of the frosting ingredients or only making two layers, since moderation might be difficult because of how tasty it is!

This is truly a 5 star recipe because I made a mistake and forgot the boiling water and the cake STILL came out great!! I know by remembering the water this cake can only get better! The frosting was alright; I think I would prefer a more milk chocolate taste so I'm going to tweek the frosting recipe next time. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is an absolutely fabulous cake! DEFINATELY a keeper. Made exactly per recipe. Done in 25 minutes in my convection oven. Very moist - and surprisingly still moist (and perhaps even tastier) 5 days later. Makes just the right amount of frosting, too. Only  (and minor) problem was some sticking to the pan - even though abundantly greased and floured.

Great Recipes better than store bought. I used to buy a devils food and choc fudge icing when was in the USA and could make a iced cake for about $3 but not in OZ for both would cost over $8 and i love to make and decorate cakes this is great and cost effective, Thanks

I can see why this cake won!  It is my new favorite chocolate cake.  The marriage of the brown sugar and chocolate are almost sinful!  I didn't make the frosting for this cake but I will try it on another cake.  I madean 11x15 cake and it was almost to the top of the pan.  I was so excited to see so much batter!  Thank you for sharing this gem.

Baking time was not long enough in my oven, and I didn't realize this since my two children were running around while I was cooking, so unfortunately, one layer was complete mush.  Next time I will have to cook it longer, but for now, I have no dessert to take to my dinner party.

I made cupcakes using this recipe (and since this is a 3 layer cake recipe, it made plenty of cupcakes!) and thought the cake itself was really good.  I didn't care much for the frosting, mine came out a tad too liquidy (maybe I did something wrong).  I gave this 4 stars because the recipe was easy to follow and produced a moist and chocolately cake.  Definitely give this one a try.

I chose this cake for my oldest son's 18th birthday.  I made all three layers and let the cake and the icing cool before frosting the cake.  I asked the Lord to help me with it.  It is by far the best cake I have ever made.  It is moist, delicious.  Wow!!!!!!!!  Thanks so much for sending in this recipe.  Usually, I substitute low fat sour cream.  I did not do that for this recipe.

Thanks again!!

This cake was good but not great. Personally, I thought the icing was a little bitter, maybe due to the sour cream. 

The cake itself was good but it would've been better with a chocolate buttercream icing.

i really do try to reserve 5 stars for recipes that absolutely blow me away, but this was very good. i think the cook time was actually a bit much, but that could absolutely just be my oven. the cake was light but moist, and not so rich that you couldn't enjoy a good piece. my husband (long reputed to be the pickiest man on the planet, and not someone who likes sweets) claims this is the best chocolate cake he ever had. i'm the chocoholic, and while i wouldn't go that far, i did enjoy it. for the record, i used a different frosting. thanks sandy! ****UPDATE: i made this again, with the frosting as listed. i'm not sure what i might have done differently the first time, but i followed the recipe exactly and the cook time was right on ... had my best friend over and we all agreed this is the best chocolate cake we have ever had. i will always make this when we get a hankering! 5 stars!

This cake was very yummy!!!  However, after trying the "One Bowl Choc Cake" recipe off here, I think that one's my favorite.  It's so simple and delicious, it's hard to beat it.

Very delicious. My whole family loved it. We totally blew our diets on this one. Couldn't stop eating it. I took the advice of others and made it a double layer and made cupcakes with the leftover batter.  Mmmmmm.

I first saw this recipe in a cookbook and made it for my boyfriend, who's a chocolate fanatic, on Christmas. I'm not a huge chocolate fan and this was a lot of chocolate, but it was very good and I couldn't get enough. The cake was nice and moist. The icing could have been a tad bit better but overall it was the best chocolate cake recipe I'd ever made.

The cake was amazing and so moist... but the frosting was gross. Next time I will use a different recipe for the frosting, a cream cheese frosting would go great with this cake.

I took one bite and it was PURE EXSTASY!
I made this for our dessert on valentines day and it was truly amazing. I really followed the recipe to a T. I couldn't find unsweetened chocolate in the store so used 60% cocoa chocolate and less sugar for the frosting. It was perfect. I asked my boyfriend what his favorite part of the meal was and he said "the chocolate cake!"....Over the STEAK!!

very yummy cake, BUT - it did stick a little to pan & even though i read reviews, i did not line with parchment. i will next time. also, frosting was a little thick? don't know if it's because i mixed light & regular sour cream, but next time i might thin it a little with milk. otherwise, delicious chocolate cake!

My family really enjoyed this cake!  When I first made the frosting, my young nephew and I weren't too sure about the flavor due to the sour cream, but I went ahead and frosted the cake since the reviews were so good.  I then put it in the frid to chill overnight.  

Well, when the cake was passed around the next day, I knew I had a winner.  The smiles went from ear-to-ear.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

First of all,thank you for that excellent recipe.I made that cake for my wedding anniversary a week ago and my husband was proud of me even after 8 years of marriage.
I did two different things.First, I added chocolate sandwich cookie crumbs in my cake batter(It was an idea from the recipe"Oreo cookie cake II").I mixed the cookie crumbs with the chocolate chips ,the flour,and the margarine and I put that mix in my cake batter.
Also,for the frosting I made the cream cheese frosting II.I'd like to post a photo of my cake;it's too bad that I can't post the flavour of it.it was soooooooo good!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I  don't know how I didn't end up with a five star cake! I followed the recipe exactly, except I took it out of the oven five mins early. The cake was not very moist and the icing was way too sweet.

Great cake!  I was a little apprehensive to add all that water but the cake came out perfect, very moist.  I ended up using three 9-inch cake pans (I hate trying to cut layers!) I had 2 silicone and one non-stick metal pan. I greased and floured all of them but the cake still stuck to the metal non-stick.  I found no advantage to silicone bakeware until this recipe!  Also, when making the frosting I found it was too runny to frost the cake with but stiffened up nicely after being refrigerated for a few hours.

This cake is absolutely delectable! The only thing I would adjust is cook time from 35 minutes to about 50.  This cake is rich but has a nice flavor from the sour cream to curb it.

I got amazing reviews when I served it last night. I liked how the recipe had an interesting history. The cake was so pretty, it was a conversation piece all night! Vanilla Ice cream goes perfect with it because it is so rich! As someone else mentioned, make sure you buy enough sour cream for both the cake and the icing because the average,larger sized container (500 ml) is about 1/3 cup less than the recipe indicates. Thanks Sandy!

Yum!  This is a very simple recipe for a very tasty cake.     The only potential issue is that this recipe makes a LOT of cake, so make sure you have enough pans available to bake it all!

This must be the BEST chocolate cake i've ever tasted. At frist i was worried about the frosting, it seemed too thin, but after i iced the cake and let in sit overnight it was fine. Not the best tasting frosting, but it went well with cake. This will be the only chocolate cake i will ever make! THANK YOU

A very delicious chocolate cake. My only problem was that the three layers were hard to get stacked (and make them stay). I followed the recipe exactly and the cake was very moist!

This is the first scratch chocolate cake I have made that was moist and tasted wonderful.  I made it for a friend's birthday but did not use the chocolate frosting recipe.  Did a traditional buttercream.  We are not big on frosting so next time I make it will serve it warm with vanilla ice cream on side and drizzle carmel and/or hot fudge over the top.  Our favorite restaurant does this and we love it.  Except this cake is fair superior to what they serve. I have only used box mixes but am a convert.  This cake is awesome!!!

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful chocolate cake.  I have finally found a chocolate non-mix cake to use for birthdays, to go along with the yellow one I found on allrecipes.com, and this cake is moist as well as sinfully good.  Thanks for sharing it!

This is the best chocolate cake I have ever had!  My family agrees.  Very moist and had a great chocolate taste.  The balance of semisweet/unsweetened chocolate for the frosting was a fantastic compliment to the cake.  Loved it and would highly recommend it!  I'll be making it for the holidays.

I made this for my Husbands Birthday and he loved it!  Out of this world.  We had a friend of his over and he wanted to pay me to make the Birthday cakes for the office.  We have a small family and can't (or could and shouldn't) eat it all, so wrapped up several plates for the neighbors.  One wanted to pay me for another one too.  Really, so good!  Sandy's anything is good for me!

This cake was FANTASTIC!!  I made it for my mothers 55th birthday and it turned out PERFECT!!!  I ddi everything exactly as the recipe called for and was over-joyed at the results.  You can spend $50-60 at a bakery on a cake that is not half as good or pretty.  TRULY AMAZING!!

Hi all, I am all the way from New Zealand, & this recipe is sooo gooood if you LOVE a good chocolate cake with an extra kick than look no further as this is so simple to make & is just so divine! I have tried a million recipes for choc cake & they never deliver, there either too dry or not chocolaty enough. I have made this cake twice now & they compliments just keep rolling. The only thing i would change is the name from Chocolate cake to what it truely is (!! CHOCOLATE FUDGY CAKE!!)

This was truly a great cake. very moist and delicious. It did lack a bit of taste, but I think it would have been perfect if I had added a bit of coffee granules to the water. The frosting was not amazing, not everyone liked it much. It would however be the perfect cake base to black forest cake! I am sure it would come out even better than the bakery black forest!

This is the best cake ever. Make it exactly as the recipe says - you'll never go back to cake from a box again. For those who say it is not chocolatey enough... I don't know how that could be! I find it very rich, chocolatey, and moist, and the sour cream gives it a unique taste that people rave about.

Very moist, nice flavor. Sour cream gave it a bit of a tang. I don't usually like frosting, but this was quite good--worth the extra effort. However, the cake was really rich; I got way more than 12 servings, because pieces need to be sliced thin.

Yummy! Moist, rich, dense and delicious. Definitely not a light and airy cake.

I didn't make the frosting since I was experimenting with a Nutella frosting but the cake was amazing! It's been in my fridge for four days now and the cake is still moist and delicious. I will keep this at the top of my list.

I only made two 9-inch layers and a few cupcakes. Maybe next time I'll try using a lighter frosting or a fruit layer.

You must try this!!!!!

This cake was terrific! I doubled the recipe and made it in 2 half sheet pans. It was very moist, dense, and chocolaty! Yum!! I did not use the frosting because I needed white frosting for the cake I was making, so I used a white chocolate frosting. Also I filled it with a chocolate-raspberry ganache. I served it to over 20 people and it received raves from everyone, kids and grown-ups alike!! I will use this again! I also had several requests for the recipe, which I will pass on. Thanks Sandy!

Wanted to use up some sour cream so I tried this recipe one night. Cake was very moist but definitely not chocolatey enough! And I added an extra 1/3 cup of good quality cocoa after reading the other reviews. Definitely needs the frosting to up the chocolate taste. Will keep looking for a stand-alone moist chocolate cake.

This was an absolutely  amazing chocolate cake. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out moist, chocolatly, and an absolute hit. Originally, the cake wasn't for me, but rather for a friend who asked me to make a cake for her husband's birthday. I was more than pleased to oblige, but I wanted something a bit more unique. In came this recipe and though I was a bit doubtful at first (the boiled water was a startling addition), I made it dutifully, had a taste of the crumbs (very good), frosted it (I admit, I used frosting from the can since I can't make good chocolate frosting to save my life!) and gave it to my friend. A couple days later, I get RAVE reviews from everyone who had a taste of the cake. So good in fact that I baked it a second time for another friend's birthday and even MORE rave reviews. People just could not get enough of this cake, even with the not-so-fresh frosting. I finally had a slice for my own at the second birthday party and I have to say, even with all the gourmet cake shops I've gone to, this is one of the best recipes!

I don't even know how to say it, but it was absolutely mor than delicious.  Didn't have sour cream so I didn't use it.  Used another frosting recipe that I actually ended up using soymilk in place of regular. I also used organic ingredients and a blend of regular and dutch cocoa.  This cake was gone by day two so I know that next time I will have to double the batch so that it can be shared.  This will be used as much as possible and maybe with the sour cream also.

I made this cake for my husbands 42nd birthday, it came out delicious! i will make this one again for sure, this is a keeper. The cake was rich and the frosting was creamy and chocolaty.
