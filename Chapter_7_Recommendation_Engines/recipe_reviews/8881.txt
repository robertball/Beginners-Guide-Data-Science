This was just okay.  It was pretty much just a big enchilada, IMO.  One recommendation I have is to put a spoonful of sauce on the bottom of the pan before putting down the first layer of tortillas.  I didn't, and the bottom layer was tough as shoe leather.

Teriffic recipe!! I would recommend not to deviate from the corn tortillas.  Using flour ones seem to turn out a little mushy.  It's even more delicious when topped with your favorite peppers, lettuce, tomatoes and/or sour cream! Will make again and again!!

My only change would be More Layers. My old world Italian Mother-in-Law couldn't believe how good and light this recipe was - she wants me to make it again.

I made this last night and my husband & I loved it. Instead of cooking the chicken I used canned chicken to quicken the setup time and it was great.

This is a very tasty dish that can be assembled ahead of time.  The recipe calls for it to be topped with a whole pound of cheddar cheese, but much less is needed.  My kids did not the texture of the corn tortillas after they had been baked in the casserole  sort of soggy.  But people who like chicken enchiladas will like this "lasagne."

Great with chicken, but I used it with hot sausage for non chicken lovers.  It is great with more heat added to it.  Have served to company with guacamole or green salad with pears or cranberries-- good combination and easy to make ahead.

Easy and tastes even better than expected. Add more salsa and some red pepper for a more Southwestern flair.

Great dish! We only added about 1.5 onion and we love the suggestion of adding black beans and even corn to the mix b4 layering. And, at least (1) 4oz can of green chiles. We'd probably add 2 bcz we love them so much. We also like the idea of adding cilantro and sour cream on top. YUM!

Great twist on Lasagana.  It is a great basic recipie that you can add to. I have fixed it twice once with chicken and once with ground turkey.  The second time I added lots of veggies (corn, mushrooms, broccoli, spinach) too.  It was great both ways.  I have also added cottage cheese and or ricotta depending on what I had on hand.  Great lasagna with just the right amount of bite.  I will be making this often.

This is an easy recipe to make.  I loved that I had all the ingredients on hand and did not have to go shopping.  I baked skinless/boneless chicken breasts and then chopped them.  I added about 1/2 t. of salt.  I sprayed my casserole dish with olive oil before adding the first layer of corn tortillas.  Removed from oven and allowed it to cool for about five minutes.  Once it was cool, sliced it into beautiful servings and served on a bed of shredded lettuce accompanied with sour cream and homemade salsa. I also served with a side of jalapeno peppers for those that preferred a little more warmth!  Thanks for sharing! It is a keeper for us!

This was a good dish overall. I did change a few things like added green pepper, corn, and way less onion. Two onions is way to much. Also needs more chcken. This is a fairly expenisve recipe unless you already keep these items on hand, like I do. The tortillas became mushy and melded with the rest of the dish, so it seemed like all the extra work was really for nothing. Next time I am going to make the tortillas very crispy and not bake nearly as long to see if this fixes the problem. I really did not see why you would need to bake this dish for an entire hour when all the ingredients were already cooked so next time I will not do so. I also covered this dish, thank goodness or the top would have been a burnt mess. This is a great base recipe it just needs a bit of tweaking to make it spectacular. I am going to try this a few times until I get it just right for my family. The taste was good though, and overall worth it.

This is a great use of "stuff around the house".  Just as good with leftover turkey as chicken.  Try it in a round spring-form pan that fits the tortillas you have.   Let it sit about 10 minutes after taking it out of the oven, then removes sides and cut into wedges.  I cut the recipe to about 2/3 for the spring-form version but you could leave it "as is" and just add another layer or two.   Thanks for a great recipe - the hollow legged teens like it too!

This recipe was just okay. I didn't have jalapenos, so i added a little bit of hot sauce for a kick. It had flavor just not enough for my families tongue. Also, it would probably be good with some corn thrown in. If I ever try this recipe again, I'm gonna try it with corn. I did however add a little spicy BBQ sauce as a topping and it did give it a better flavor. But just made as the original recipe is not the greatest :( You definitely have to add your own style and flavors to make it your own and what taste good to you.

I followed the recipe exactly, but it wasn't as spicy as promised. Next time I'll probably use two whole jalepenos to get the spice we want. Overall it was good and the family enjoyed it - a do again.

My family enjoyed this. I used hot pepper Jack cheese (8 oz brick shredded) instead of mozzarella and shredded an 8 oz brick of cheddar. I didn't have any minced garlic so I used garlic powder. I also added a package of dry taco seasoning mix. This was nice with a dollop of sour cream on the side. I will be making this again.

This worked out great.  Following suggestions, I soaked the CORN tortillas in some chicken broth, made my own salsa and put a layer on the bottom, used some leftover (homemade) spaghetti sauce w/out the added tomato sauce, baked 35 min-removed-added more cheddar on top/black olives, then baked another 10.  Also put fresh cilantro on top.  This is a new favorite in my LARGE house!

Not so much a lasagna with defined layers as it is an enchilada casserole.  The tortillas do mush up but not in an icky way.  I would go easy on the basil/oregano. I ended up using a lot less.  THis is a great recipe idea and easy to change it up to the ingredients you have on hand.  This time I made it with ro-tel and crushed tomatoes instead of using tomato sauce.  Tasty!

Wow!  This was really good.  Listen to the other reviewers and make sure you use corn tortillas.  It just wouldn't be the same any other way.

I made this for a group of friends which included a guy I was interested in. He was so wooed by the dinner that he asked me out and we've been together since. Now that we are living together he has often asked me to make this dish again. Considering how picky he is, I'd say this dish is a winner

This is a tasty mexican casserole. Since you only use a partial jar of pasta sauce, I put some in the bottom of the casserole dish and the remainder on the top after layering. (just before the cheddar) Once you make this, you will be inspired to add your own flare as this is a very versitile delicious dish. Thanks Mike for sharing.

Basic. Tasted just as you would expect. Used mix of mozz and mexi blend cheese. Seasoned chicken first w/ southwest seasoning, garlic power, seasoning salt, pepper, and chili powder. Added red bell pepper and corn.

Excellent flavors. Agree with other reviewers moisten the bottom tortilla layers. Also I increased the jalapenos and substituted one additional cup of salsa for the second can of tomato sauce. Simmered for 30 mins to enhance.

This was a good recipe with some tweaking. First, I used shredded chicken instead of chopped because my family enjoys that better. I also used olive oil in the skillet because I try to avoid butter when possible. Instead of jalapenos, I used a can of diced green chilies. I wasn't quite clear in the directions if it called for 2 or 3 layers of the ingredients, but my 9x13 would only hold two layers and it turned out just fine. I also used one cup of spaghetti sauce and 1 can of diced tomatoes because I wanted to have some chunks of tomato in it. And in the end, I only used about half the cheese it calls for and it was still REALLY cheesy. As another review said I put down some of the tomato sauce mixture in the bottom of the pan so the tortillas didn't get over cooked and that worked great. My family ended up wanting to eat this served in a flour tortilla so I topped it with olives, fresh tomato, cilantro and lite sour cream. All in all, a good base recipe with some tweaking to your liking.

Funny, when I brought the dish out to the table, my daughter commented that I hadn't made "lasagna" in a while. I used leftover pork roast for this to which I mixed in a can of bean and bacon soup. I made my own enchilada sauce and  used up every scrap of leftover cheese in the fridge; cheddar, swiss and mozarella. Delicious and easy. Thanks so much Mike!

My wife and I love any food with a little spice to it.  I did a few things differant on this recipe to add some extra flavor.  

First off I rolled the chicken breasts in chili powder and then grilled them till they had black edges on my grill.  I put some mesquite wood on the grill to add a little smoke flavor.  I used two whole jalepenos to add the extra spice.  I used one can of tomatoe sauce and one can of whole tomatoes.

Next time I make this I am going to add a few extra tortillas, but will also need to add some water so that it doesn't end up all dry.   

This is one of the better recipes I have used off of this website.

This was one of the most delicious meals we've had in a long time.  I loaded up on all of the spices, added more jalapenos, used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and put the sauce on the bottom of the pan.  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!

The corn tortilla's turned to mush. The flavor was good - just like enchilladas, but I won't make this again. Next time, we'll just go with plain ole chicken enchilladas.

I gave this recipe a 5 as it has a great deal of potential, my husband and I put this together this evening and found it to be very good.  You can add all sorts of items to this recipe to even make it better.  I did not find it dry at all, I used flour tortillas and ortega green chilis versus jalapenos

I added 1 can of drained and rinsed black beans to this recipe for additional southwestern flavor and thought it was great. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was because the consistency was a bit strange.

I made this dish for dinner tonight.  Definately a keeper.  The sauce was absolutely delicous, but the corn tortillas I used completely mushed up during the baking process.  They were almost completely blended into the sauce. I ended up putting some dry tortillas under lasagna. They became soft, but not mushy,in no time. (Maybe next time I'll cook the chicken/cheese/sauce mix seperately. Then do the layering on the plates? Hmmm...) Also, I used only half of the cheese and it was nice and gooey. Any extra would have been a mess.

This recipe was great! I used pre-cooked chicken breast strips because I was short for time. I think they are made by Tyson. Instead of using 2 cups of spaghetti sauce and tomato sauce...I just used a whole jar of spaghetti sauce and one can of tomato sauce to avoid wasting the remaining spaghetti sauce in the jar.

My family loves this dish!! I always want to keep some for leftovers so I can bring it to work the next day but it's gone in one sitting. I haven't changed the recipe one bit, except for putting sauce down in the pan first before the first layer of tortillas. This is a yummy, cheesy, dish!!

I substituted grated parmesan for half of the moz. cheese.  I didn't have jal. peppers so I used a whole (4oz) can of chopped green chiles instead.  My family absolutely loved it.  I could see it being served in a mexican restaurant.  Don't skimp on the cheese!

Love this!  We can our own sauses so I used those.  I added black beans and used lasagna noodles instead, tortillas cook up mushy.  Next time I`m gonna add corn and more jelapenos cause we like it hot.

This recipe is very good and my family loved it. It is a change from the usual lasagna. I then made it for my sister and they loved it too. Spice it up the way you like it. I used provolone cheese instead of cheddar and it was very tasty.

Very good and easy recipe that used up the leftovers in the fridge.  The boys didn't love it, but all three ate it!  Will make it again, and didn't change anything.

I made this for a company party and everyone loved it.  I liked the southwestern flavor the salsa gave this dish and it was a good change of pace from the ordinary lasagna.  We will definitely be making this again.

I didn't give five stars only because I changed it quite a bit...I had to omit the jalapeños and used chopped green chilies instead for a little less heat. I also added sliced black olives. But the biggest change was using ground beef in place of chicken, and threw in some taco seasoning. I layered the sauce and cheese with ten inch corn tortillas in a glass pie plate. To serve I cut like pie servings with a dollop of sour cream on top.

I made this for my ships crew and they loved it! I modified the base recipe by adding 1 1/2 chopped bell pepper, a can of black beans, an extra cup of chicken, and taco seasoning. I also cut the onions in half. The extra's made for a very hearty sauce which made for a very hearty lasagna! 

I will definitely make this again!

Excellent recipe!  I didn't have any jalapenos, so I used a 4-oz can of chopped green chiles instead.  Added about 1 1/2 cups of cooked rice and a 14.5 oz can of corn, drained, as well.  As another reviewer stated, I recommend putting a bit of sauce on the bottom of the pan before laying down any tortillas; it keeps the tortillas soft and prevents them from sticking.  DO NOT substitute flour tortillas for the corn tortillas either;  the corn tortillas are terrific in this recipe, even if you don't normally like them!

This was a very good alternative to both lasagna and enchiladas.  I added more salsa though, due to the casserole drying out during cooking.  I also agree that a layer of sauce before the first layer of tortillas would help with keeping them moist.   A great casserole that pleased even my pickiest eater.  This recipe will be a keeper in my kitchen.

I just don't "get" this one.  There was a sweetness that I couldn't identify (maybe from the jarred spaghetti sauce?) and even though the chicken mixture seemed well seasoned before assembly, the finished product needed salt.  I added some pinto beans, which thankfully added some texture -- the cooked chicken stews into a fine shred, which would be fine if there was some texture built into the recipe elsewhere.  It was good enough, but not at all great -- and not one that I'll make again.

Not bad at all!  We did use flour tortillas (personal preference) and lined the bottom of pan with thin layer of tomota sauce to prevent sticking and the tortillas from hardening.  Loved the unique twist.  I'd give it 4.5 if I could!!!

Delicious! Tortillas do mush up a bit but kept a great flavor. Would use less cheese though. You could easily play with the ingredients to make this dish more or less spicy. Topped with sourcream & cilantro makes it even more delicious. Will definetly make this dish again!

I made this just as it is written, it was good but the texture of the corn tortias gave it a funny taste that most of my family was not to crazy about. I would make it again but just without the tortias shells.

I liked this, but next time I'll add black beans and green peppers because it needs some veggies. I used  1.5  large flour whole wheat tortillas per layer. I cooked the chicken in water in a crockpot to avoid the butter and save time. This is good, I will definitely make it again with my additions.

This is a good base recipe upon which to build and customize.  My version has less onion, 2 diced bell peppers and an extra jalapeño.  To keep tortillas from getting mushy, lightly fry them like you would for traditional enchiladas, or if you're looking to cut out grease, heat tortillas on a comal until they are lightly toasted on both sides.
I used a mix of shredded mozzarella and shredded Mexican blend cheese between layers. 
60 minutes is too long to bake.  25-30 minutes is perfect.
I am putting corn in there next time!

Great basic recipe.  No tomato sauce on hand so added extra salsa and spaghetti sauce in its place.  Added 1 TBL of Penzey's Chili 3000 spice and 1 tsp of cumin to amp up Mexican flavor.  Omitted basil since pasta sauce was "tomato basil".  Did extra layers to use more tortillas.  Used reduced fat Mexican cheese blend throughout and on top.  About 20 oz of cheese total.  Be sure to cover the casserole while baking until the last 10 min.  I forgot to cover and cheese was over cooked.  Also, I used 2 lb of ground chicken since it cooks faster, added the spices, jalapeño pepper, garlic and onion while cooking chicken, then drained the liquid before adding sauce.  Added 1 can drained black beans.

I liked it coming out of the oven but when I had it for leftovers I didn't enjoy it as much. I just couldn't get past eating spaghetti sauce with tortillas. I don't think I'll be making this again.

This was good when made as is. I would make a few changes next time, and there will be a next time. I would lightly toast the tortillas before putting in to help keep them from getting so mushy. I would also cut back on the tomato sauce. It was a little too soupy for my liking. Lastly, more jalapeño, but I like my foods spicy.

I made this exactly as written the first time and fell in love! I did make a few changes the second time...just to suit my own taste. I used a deep 9x9 pan and added a couple layers. I used some salsa on the bottom, added a can of Mexican corn (well drained), omitted the basil and oregano, and added dry taco seasoning in their place. I made this with five layers, alternating crunchy corn taco shells (broken in half so they laid flat) for two of the layers and used regular corn tortillas for the other three layers. I also used Kraft Mexican Taco shredded cheese for all the layers instead of mozzarella. This has become a regular weekly recipe...and it's great to take for lunch the next day!

My family really liked this. It is very tasty. I used the corn tortillas as the recipe suggested. The lasagna is a little mashup so I would add two things: a can of black beans mixed in with the chicken and then some crumbled tortilla chips on top. I think these two things would give it a little more texture and add some crunch. Otherwise, this is very tasty!

My husband made this and it was AMAZING! He did cut down on the cheddar and ran out of spaghetti sauce so he used more salsa -turned out great!

It's good but not my favorite. Makes enough to feed 8-10, depending on appetite. Tasty but as much work as regular lasagna, and I'd rather have enchiladas or Italian lasagna. I put in about a tablespoon of minced jalapeño, and was not too hot. Probably could put a whole small one. The onion I had was strong so only used one but two would have been fine.

This was really good. Good flavors. I would only make a couple changes and that would be lessen the onion amount and I I added 1 can of black beans and 1 small can of corn.

I followed the recipe almost exactly.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I thought it could use a little more chicken.  I used the 3 cups as called for but think it would have been tastier with 4 cups.  I did increase the basil and oregano by an additional teaspoon each.  No where on the recipe did I see black olives but we like them and I had a can so I added them to each layer.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This is so good, my family loved it..!! It's simple, you can prepare ahead of time, then throw in the oven. This is also a great dish to make if you are taking someone a dinner. I will definitely make it again.

This is a sensational recipe that drew raves!  I omitted the jalepenos and followed a couple of reviewers' assembly recommendations:  a) Spread a thin layer of sauce on bottom as the first layer and b) made more layers.  This will absolutely be a regular meal in our household!

This is fabulous, I loved it!  It has a very subtle sweetness that I'm guessing may be from the corn tortillas, but I don't know for sure.  All I know is...I like it very much and will be making it again!

Wonderful!  I didn't have quite enough chicken and it seemed to me that there was a LOT of sauce in the filling, so I put some leftover cooked rice (1-2 c. maybe?) in to kind of bulk up the filling.  I also added a can of chopped green chiles, and instead of layering the mozzarella, I just put it in with the filling.  This made quite a LOT of filling with the addition of the rice, so I made one 8x8 casserole and froze another.  This got an A+ from Hubby and kids!  I'll definitely make it again.

A Tip to make this easier to get out of the pan, tear up the tortillas rather than lay the whole tortillas down.  By tearing them into peices, you aviod a struggle, and it falling apart when you go to serve.  Also to avoid the "tough as shoe leather" bottom layer of tortillas, I soak mine in chicken broth for just a minute before laying them down.  Don't soak too long, just a minute to two is fine. Good luck! ;)

This was fine. For my own tastes, I might use a little more salsa and chili flavors, and not so much tomato.  I also strongly recommend the sour cream on the side.  Very nice "texmex" flavors.

Very Good. A few changes since I wanted to used what I had on hand. I just used one can of tomato sauce and 1 can of diced tomatoes as well as not having and salsa so I cooked the chicken in cumin, and mixed the italian herbs in with the sauce. I really liked this though. thanks for posting.

nice toasted cheese layer on top. I cooked the tortillas crispy to see if that would keep them from being soggy, but it didn't.  Great anyway! i used green chiles instead of japelenos b/c it's what i had.  No leftovers. baked 45 minutes.

This is a fantastic recipe. I did make a few adjustments. 1)I poached the chicken first then shredded. 2)1 can of tomato sauce was 1.5 cups and the 2nd can I had was just as big so I improvised by using 1 cup of Southwestern Salsa and didn't add the fresh salsa. 3)I added a can of black beans. I think I might add corn next time as well. 

Super easy, super fun, super yummy. I highly recommend!

I've had dishes similar to this.  This was OK but nothing spectabular, and perhaps a bit on the dry side.  It made a decent dinner but not sure worth a repeat.
