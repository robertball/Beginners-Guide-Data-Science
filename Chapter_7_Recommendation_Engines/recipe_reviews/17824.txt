I've made this twice and it worked well both times, but the pockets formed better when I rolled the dough thinner.  I also tried it with about 1/3 wheat flour and with a soy-flour mix, and both were great.  I enjoy mine as sandwiches, with hummus, or just dipped in olive oil.

Wonderful Pita bread!  This was better than Pappy's, puffed up very nicely and had a great flavor.  Was easy to roll out as well.  I added 2tbsp of light (in flavor) olive oil to the dough.

Pretty good!  The only thing I was a little off about was that they took a while to soften up but they made great pockets and taste great!  Once I had divided the dough, I kneaded each piece for another 2 minutes before rolling out and I think that may have helped them puff better.

I learned how to make pocket bread when I married my husband. His father's family was from Lebanon. The dough is basically the same although they put sugar in the dough. When we make bread a 10 pound bag of flour is used and we make about 150 loaves. I notice that people are having difficulty with the pockets forming. We divide the dough into balls , cover and let rise again.  We then roll on a floured board (using cracked wheat) pretty thin. Using this method  you should have very few fail to rise.

This was a great recipe. I used 4 cups whole wheat pastry flour and 2 cups all purpose flour. I rolled these in the traditional circles and they puffed up beautifully. Everyone was impressed.

Sorry, this did not work for me and I've been cooking/baking for 50+ years.  None of them puffed up as others I've made.  I'll go back to my old recipe that works.  I had to try it and followed directions to the T as I do when trying a new recipe but it was a mess and too much time and money to try again.

This pocket bread turned out pretty good. The pockets formed well, and it was easy to make. It was a little too bland for my *personal* taste, however I think that was just personal preference. Next time I will try adding a little honey just to suit my own taste. Overall a pretty good recipe that can be easily modified to meet one's own personal taste.

This bread reminded me of Indian fry bread, without the fat! Nice bready taste, and good texture. I do think, though, the breads need to be rolled out a little thinner to get a less dense bread for easier folding. But this is a great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

These pocket breads, which I made with half whole wheat flour, turned out nice and soft. They didn't, however, have much of a "pocket." That's ok though. They were still good.

Loved how the bread turned out, but I had to add an extra tsp or so of water because the dough was so dry. It really didn't DOUBLE in size but maybe it wasn't hot enough? I added a Tbsp of agave nectar to keep it vegan and add just a touch of sweetness. Again, thank you for the recipe! I am still excited about it. :)

I cut this down to 10 servings ( something  I like about your website).  I did 3 cups of wheat and 1.25 cups of all purpose.  Also added some agave to the yeast and cut the salt in half. Best pita's I've ever made, tho they all did not pop, but they are still good tasting and better yet fits in with my clean eating.

Mine didn't puff up and create pockets, but the taste was incredible. I did flip them 3-4 minutes into baking, which is probably why they didn't pocket. I covered them with a damp kitchen towel after baking for a few minutes to help soften them.

having never made pita bread before, I found this recipe very easy to follow.  I did make a few changes: I did not have bread flour, so I used all purpose and cut it down to 5 cups.  the dough seemed tough when finished, but was quite workable after rising.  I rolled mine out quite thin after the first few didn't puff much.  I got a nice puff from the rest when they were thinner.  I think in the future I will use 4 cups of flour to start and go from there.  Nice flavour and a great addition to my sugar free diet!

This did not work for me.  I have to be fair, I'm not an experienced cook so when I saw there were only 4 ingredients I thought I could tackle this.  It calls for 6 cups of flour but I could only manage to get about 4 cups into the dough.  No matter how hard I tried it wouldn't take any more flour then that.  It puffed up better when I rolled it out really thin but it still just didn't turn out the way I had hoped.  :-(

This was great!  Better than any pocket bread I can get in our local store.  After the two hour rise, I had to knead the dough for about 4 minutes, and that helped.  Delicious!

Love love love this recipe. Perfect just the way it is. If you want a chewier pocket, leave the dough a little thicker, makes a perfect scoop for your favorite dips!

Way too much salt and cook time is not nearly long enough.  The first time I made this bread it was like eating doughy salt.  I cut the salt in 1/2 and cooked the bread almost twice as long to get a decent pocket and color.  After those adjustments it was alright.

so much fun for me and my 7 year old son to make our own pita!  These came together very smoothly, and out of a double batch we only had three that didn't puff up properly (those were the ones my son rolled out, surprise!).  Letting them rest between making them into balls and rolling them out made them much better.  I did change out for 1/3 whole wheat flour, very good.

I used this recipe as a "starter".  I agree with other members that thinner is better than thicker.  I used whole wheat and rice flour and my family thought they were perfect.  I will use this recipe again.

First time I ever tried to make these.  I did exactly as the recipe said.  They tasted great but strangely only half of them puffed up.  Can't figure that one out.  Will definitely try again.

I've tried this twice and both times the dough was a gluey, gloppy mess, impossible to work with and went straight into the trash.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but there is not enough flour or something in this recipe.

These turned out very good, i think next time i will add a bit more salt to the mixture, because they turned out kinda bland. I rolled them out as circles, that seemed to make a decent pocket. I also agree with some of the other reviews, roll them thinner that it says and the pocket will form much better.

Made it exactly as written except that I rolled them into rounds a bit thinner than instructed. They puffed up beautifully and were delicious with homemade falafel. I think next time I will try them with half whole wheat and half white flour to add a bit more flavour/health content to them. And there will be a next time for sure!

My family loves these, I have to make them at least once every two weeks or so. My daughter will just eat them as is but, I like to make chicken salad and stuff the pocket bread with that. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! I never liked pita bread or anything like that but, this is perfect.

This turned out wonderfully, was easy to make, my kids love it just as a snack after dinner. It made more than 16 pieces as I guess i made them smaller than was called for but no complaints about that either.

Nice and easy!
Takes a while to make because of the dough's resting times, but  it puffs up and nice to fill with veggies and other items of your preference.
Enjoy... we did!
