We loved this, but I made a couple tiny changes - used white wine vinegar and white balsamic vinegar, subbed honey for the agave and reduced it to 1 tsp.  I also used red onion and left it in slices (easier for picky eaters to remove), and I have an assortment of heirloom cherry-sized tomatoes, so I just halved them.  Pretty, colorful and delicious!  We could have this every night!

I liked this salad a lot. I had to do some variations- didn't have champagne vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar instead. Also used roma tomatoes instead of heirloom. It did have a strong vinegar taste, but I really liked this and so did my husband.

I used 2 large cucumbers instead of one large and two small. I used what tomatoes and onion I had on hand--which was 2 romas and a purple onion.  I used white wine vinegar.  I thought the onion and the vinegar flavor over whelmed the taste of the tomato and the cucumber but over all it was pretty good.  I think this would work better as a part of a larger salad involving some lettuce and grilled chicken to round out a meal.  After the flavors meld and the juices start to come out, there is a great dressing that shouldn't go to waste!

A nice refreshing summer salad.  The longer this recipe can marinade, the better it gets.  The flavors of this salad come together really well.  Thanks Pinkmonkey19 for sharing.

I’m lucky. My husband and I own an oil and vinegar store. I had champagne vinegar and used a Picual EVO and a garlic infused white balsamic. Awesome after an hour and I’m looking forward to lunch tomorrow. Needed more salt in my opinion but I’m a good quality saltaholic

Wonderful salad.  I do a little less sweetener and more tomatoes.  Sometimes also switch and do red onions. Love it.  Thanks!

Delicious! I had a champagne pear vinegar on hand I used. Definitely leave time for e salad to sit in the marinade, overnight if you can. Extremely easy to make and very tasty to boot. Will definitely make again.
