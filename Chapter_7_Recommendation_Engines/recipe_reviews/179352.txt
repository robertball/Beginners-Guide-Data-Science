Haha. Some really hated this recipe. Some thought it was 'bland'. Well, duh. If you treat this as more than a concept recipe, you are probably going to be disappointed. After all, who eats PLAIN cheeseburgers? (My little cousin, but that's besides the point.) I dressed this as I would my regular burgers. Layers were: hamburger (seasoned with garlic and onion powder), crumbled bacon, raw onions (mm, crunchy), chopped dill pickles (trust me), cheese, homemade buttermilk biscuit (dough that I had in the fridge). When it was cooked, I plated it on top of whole leaf lettuce, would have added tomatoes if I had 'em, and thousand island dressing. It was tasty, casserole-y, and cheeseburger-y. Get out there and experiment. Recipes are not set in stone. (Unless it is creme brulee, I'm pretty sure that's set in stone somewhere... in France.) Thanks for a good start to a decent supper.

I have been making this since I first saw it on the Bisquick box. Like other reviewers, I add more seasoning to the beef, such as a pack of taco or chili mix. I also add a can of black beans and a small can of chopped green chilies to the meat mixture. I also use a combination of shredded cheeses and put a layer of diced tomatoes in between the meat and the cheese. This is a very easy and quick meal.

I make this about once a month and my kids just love it. I am always seeking to find what can be added and one of mine and my husbands favorites is a can of mushrooms, green pepper and swiss cheese. I have to make two for my large family and make one with American cheese, bacon, tomato, and onion, and when it comes out of the oven top with shredded lettuce. This is my children's favorite way. I love this dinner served with season curly fires or tater tots. I also make the morning of  and keep refrigerated until cooked. This is a GREAT and healthy dinner to make on  a snap. Just Love It.

Quick, easy, and very adaptable.  I used ground turkey and browned it with a half package of onion soup mix, along with the onions.  I also mixed cheddar and mozzarella cheeses. Great for a last minute rush meal!

 **UPDATE**  Just for the heck of it, I tried this again tonight w/ sloppy joe mix in the meat...  Mmmmm, an equally delish. variety!!!

My mother used to make this all the time and she would do the same, add this here, there , to our liking.  She would also use other bisquick recipes too.  Very helpful to a single widowed mom of two small children, it was a keeper for her tight schedule, better than fast food, or boxed dinners!  TY for reposting this as this is fond memories and surely be served at my table!

I forgot the first rule of recipe tryout: Read reviews first! I made this exactly as written except I added a couple of minced garlic cloves. I should have used a little salt, although I don't salt anything any more. I whisked the Bisquick with milk & eggs & it was very runny. Finished dish was a little bland, improved with ketchup &, while the Bisquick did creep into all the nooks & crannies, it tasted under-cooked. The second time I made this I cut the milk to 1/3 C. & added 3 eggs. I also placed 1/2 ground beef in pie pan, added the cheese then remaining meat. Baked it for 20 minutes, added more cheese to the top & returned it to oven to finish. I also added salt this time. Perfection! This is now in my permanent rotation of meals.

Fool-proof and tasty.  I cut down the onions by half and chopped them finely to make the recipe more kid friendly, and then squirted a layer of ketchup between the burger and cheese layer which gave it a very nice flavor.  I'm giving it five stars not because it's exceptional, but because it's tastes good and is VERY easy to make.

This was very easy and fairly quick to put together. We really enjoyed it. If you like spicy or hot you'll need to add something to 'spice' it up. We're not much of spicy food people so this fit the bill for us.

This is very easy to make and tasty.  I cooked my ground beef with onions and garlic.  I added worcstershire sauce and seasoned salt for taste.  I intended to add a layer of ketchup between the beef and the cheese but forgot.  I think it would've added to it.  Otherwise, it is very easy and tasty.

Very easy and economical. I added fresh garlic & a jalapeno minced while cooking beef.
I added about 2 tbls. of taco seasoning on top of meat before I spread the cheese.
Added worcheshire sauce to bisquick mixture.
Served it with a can of refried beans.
Good meal......

My family loved this. They said it was better the first night than the second, but still, this was a hit. But I did add green peppers into the meat with the sautéed onions. I added hamburger grilling seasoning, A1 sauce and a dash of garlic powder into the meat for some flavor. When building the pie, I layered Bisquick liquid, seasoned meat, peppers, onions, cheese, ketchup, mustard, pickle relish, sliced tomatoes, then the rest of the Bisquick, and three slices of cheese on the very top for color (and disguise of the sliced tomato underneath.) It was almost like a quiche with no eggs. I'll be making this again, no doubt. This got me in the mood to make a Shepard's pie!

I used ground turkey and seasoned it with all the usual suspects; seasoned salt, pepper, italian seasoning, onion powder, cumin, and a little paprika. Then instead of making the crust a pancake batter consistency, I turned it into biscuit dough (omit the eggs, less milk) and spread it as the top layer. Baked as usual, set out condiments for everyone to customize.

I was asked by all members of the fmaily not to make this again.  It was okay but very unflavorful (if that is a word?).  I added extra cheese and about 1/4 of a jar of pasta sauce to the meat since it was in the fridge and needed to be used and I was hoping it would jazz it up a bit-not really...I have had good luck with other impossible pies in the past but this one won't be made again...sorry.

I think my mom was making this when I was a kid! Tonight I served it to my picky college student and she liked it. Next time I'll try the taco seasoning idea and maybe pepper jack for the cheese.

I made mine a little different.  I added cooked bacon, sautéed onions, garlic,  on red onion to the ground beef mixture.  I also added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sace and steak sauce. Then a few dashes of garlic powder, Pampered Chef dijon mustard seasoning and Pampered Chef Applewood Barbecue seasoning to the mixture.   It added so much flavor.   My fiancé asked me to make the dish every night.  I paired it with a salad and green beans.

This was yummy. I did add some garlic, a few shots of Worcestershire sauce and a couple of squirts of ketchup as the ground beef cooked. I then added a swirl of ketchup as others suggested in between the cheese and ground beef. Delicious with a side salad of lettuce, tomato, cukes and Thousand Island Dressing.

Super easy, fast comfort food! Great for my picky eater! This was the first casserole type dish my son was willing to try (he didn't like foods on his plate to touch each other), I think because it had the word "cheeseburger" in its name ;)  I double the amount of  Bisquick which makes it less "eggy".  Also, I add a teaspoon or so  Worcestershire sauce and a shake or two Tabasco sauce to the burger.  It makes the whole family happy.

I gave this an OK because, like others said, it is bland. But what we didn't like was the way the cheese sat on top of it and cooked to a yucky layer of baked cheddar cheese.  I think if you mixed the cheese with the meat it would have been better.  Or if you added the items the other reviewers suggest it according to your own tastes it would be improved greatly. Out of my husband, me and my two boys, only my husband liked it.  I would NOT make it again following the directions as written.

I’ll make it again, but will flavor the beef more.  I liked the idea of a taco seasoning packet from another reviewer, or I might just do more onion and lots of garlic.  Chili powder?  I don’t know.  I think I’d like it with corn in it, but my family overruled me on that one.

I made this for my family tonight and we loved it!!! I did make some changes because of reading the reviews... First I seasoned the ground beef with seasoning salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper I then drained the meat then added the onion along with chopped bacon, ketchup, and cheese to the meat and it turned out very good!! This one is a keeper!!

This recipe is a great base.  Don't just use it as is, but season and add veggies and other ingredients as you like. In my house, we usually use ground turkey, and we really love to make a "taco/tex-mex" version with green peppers, garlic, chili powder, cumin, coriander, cayenne and black pepper.  I've also snuck veggies in there to create a balanced one-dish meal...just reduce the amount of milk you use a little bit if you add wet veggies.  It's a fave every time in our house!

Tried this recipe tonight and it was surprisingly easy and good - after reading all the reviews and tweaking it in all the assorted ways mentioned.  I cut the egg down to 1 and used 3/4 cup of Bisquick. It was like a deconstructed cheeseburger. This is definitely a keeper!

I took Nobody's girl's review and followed her suggestions as well as added a couple of my own spices and we really enjoyed ours! When cooking the meat, I realized I didn't have a fresh onion so I just used dehydrated onion flakes. I added garlic powder, old bay seasoning, seasoned salt, and pepper. After that I added the cheese, and some diced pickles on top. Next was the bisquick mix, eggs, and milk. It turned out really well. The pickles truly do make it!

Really good just needed a little extra seasoning. I added pepper with the salt and onion and garlic powder to taste. To the meat mixture after it was cooked. Then I mixed ketchup in the meat as well to make it more like a cheeseburger! Kids loved it!

This was good and easy to make.  Since it is a "cheeseburger pie", you can put ketchup on top.  That adds some flavor.  The kids love it!

I will not be making this again. I think the Taco Pie on this site would have a lot more flavor than this recipe. Also, I made this in a casserole dish instead of a pie pan, and I think the pie pan would work better so that the "bread" topping would be thicker. I thought it was a really eggy topping, so I would add a little bit more bisquik. I also added a can of corn. Definitely needs some work to taste better.

This recipe is great, kids love it. Takes about 15 minutes to make. Actually really tasty considering the few ingredients. Comes out like a pie, cut into triangles, serve with fresh sliced tomatoes and a biscuit, great meal

For what it's worth, here's one more review! :-)
I read a ton of reviews on how bland and flavorless this was so I  took suggestions of others and added a scattered layer of thinly sliced dill pickles. I also added garlic and a half envelope of dry onion soup mix to the ground beef.  Bottom line, maybe my taste buds were expecting the wonderful flavor of another recipe on this site that is a big hit with my family (bacon cheeseburger upside down pizza) so I was a bit disappointed with my first 'bland' bite.  Nothing I added to the beef was evident in helping with flavor, however, the first small piece I ate that had pickles was much tastier.  So on that note I would definitely add more pickles next time.   The second piece I ate I added mustard and ketchup and this helped make it more enjoyable, like a hamburger.  This is very much just that, a plain hamburger with cheese.  It was good but I think I'd just as soon cook some hamburgers, add cheese and eat them on a bun like normal instead!  :-)

Great Base recipe!  i needed to use up some veggies so I added fresh mushrooms, celery and spinach, also garlic and a little bit of onion soup mix (about tablespoon) for flavour..  Had to use a larger pan and 1 more egg  - 9 x 9 glass - turned out great!

I used a 9" regular pie pan and the filling came right to the edge, so I put a foil covered cookie sheet under it, as a precaution.  I used exactly the ingredients as stated, except only 1/2 chopped onion.  Most of the batter, ended up rising up over the edges of the pan and dripped onto the foil.  Maybe that is why it didn't taste very good and had a strange texture.  Should have taken a picture.  Would really have been unhappy if it had been all over the oven floor.  If I would be dumb enough to try this again, I will use a 10" deep dish pie pan.

I make this recipe at home, but I add sliced tomatoes on top, about 4-5 roma tomatoes usually works well.  Adds alot more flavor to the pie.  I also use Paula Deans house seasoning blend instead of just salt.

I made this last night and all 5 of us loved it, only made a few changes...
1. I added 2 garlic gloves
2. I used Season salt instead of table
3.  After I drained the meat I added BBQ sauce to the meat mixture...

This will be a regular in our house, my 5 year old who normaly wont eat meat loved it and told me it was a keeper

This was ok.  I made the meat with taco seasoning and served the dish with salsa.  It was simple to make - but it didn't wow me.  My 5 year didn't care for it but my husband and I thought it was ok with salsa on the side.

Big Bis Quick fan. Must be my WT roots showing. :-)

I make this recipe but add cooked and drained frozen spinach. This makes it an all-food-groups meal that even my picky almost-two-year-old will eat with gusto.

So easy! And tasty! I added garlic to the onions and then salt and pepper on the beef as it browned. After I took it out of the oven, I topped it with diced tomatoes and pickles, along with a drizzle of both mustard and ketchup.  It’s going in the make it again file for sure!

I added in spices to the ground beef while browning.  (Salt Pepper Worcestershire sauce Grill Mates hamburger seasoning and Lawrys ) 
Also mixed sharp and mild cheddar cheese to top meat before adding the Bisquick mix. 
Family loved it and will definitely make again.

This recipe has potential, but like others said, it is a bit boring.  I would have liked it a LOT in the 70's, but since then we've been eating more foods with a lot of spices.  We added garlic powder, celery salt, and chili powder, but I guess we didn't add enough to make it a 5-star recipe.  My husband thinks it could use some vegetables, but otherwise liked it. My son said he would eat it again, but wouldn't be anxious for me to make it again soon....needed more "flavor".  So, for families who don't like spice, I would say that this recipe is for you.  For us...not so much.

I wouldn’t say I hated it. But it’s nothing to really brag about. It was okay.... I’m willing to give this one more shot, but going to add more cheese and maybe play with some of the spices to liven up the flavor. Cause it is severely lacking something.

My family loves this!  I can remember my mom making this and I've continued the "tradition"!
I do alter this recipie slightly. I season with season all (omitting the salt), chopped garlic and onion powder in addition to the other ingredients while Browning the meat.  I also add in a can of diced tomatoes (juice and all!) Right before the meat is done. 
A little extra cheese and yum!

This recipe, as written, has good bones, but really needs a boost of flavor, in my opinion.. so, today, since my family loves green chile cheeseburgers, I decided to step this up by layering a good amount of green chile salsa between the beef/onion and the cheese layers. I thought about adding taco seasoning to the meat, but didn’t this time. I’m glad I didn’t. It was perfect with just the salsa - the salsa gave this recipe the kick I was looking for & tasted so much like a green chile cheeseburger, I was flabbergasted! I served it with additional salsa, diced tomatoes, sour cream & chopped fresh cilantro. My family loved it.

It tasted great, came out looking awesome but it didn't hold itself together very well. I might use more bisquick next time. Excellent base recipe though!

My family loves this recipe! Here are the changes I made to it that makes it so delicious: first of all I add a lot of garlic and I cook that with he ground beef and onion. After I drain my meat, I add lots of Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and some chili powder. Then I cook the rest as the recipe says. I serve his with white country gravy and it is amazing! Definitely a great easy weeknight dinner and my whole family loves it. We never have leftovers

I’ve eaten this for years and it’s really good as it is.  I have added green chili’s and Mexican corn for a Mexican version and a little extra cheese.  Serve it with lettuce, tomatoes, salsa and sour cream.

I found this recipe and used it for our Community Dinner. We serve 100+ so it needed to be adjusted. The serving adjustment was spot on! Reading the reviews I did spice up the meat, ketchup & A1 worked great! We will definitely keep this one!

Could use a little more seasoning (maybe I'll try steak salt next time), but so easy and tasty! Subbing sausage for hamburger would be an awesome breakfast pie.

On yeah!  I shook in some garlic powder, added a dash of Worcestershire, and the kids loved it!  Then I made another , starting with about a quarter pound smoked salmon with pepper.  Then I sauteed a red pepper with a quarter pound of baby spinach.  I layered in those veg with  half cup of loosely packed green onion.  I used southwestern style egg beaters and whole milk and it was AWESOME!!!  I used sharp cheddar on both.  And Jiffy baking mix.  For another option, fill the pie pan with raw broccoli, then microwave the broccoli and proceed!  I also put bacon bits in that one.

I would definitely make this again. I put BBQ sauce with the meat. I topped with shredded cheese, chopped pickles and bacon. When it came to the baking mix, I used 3/4 cup and one egg like another reviewer suggested. Super delicious!

Exactly how my grandmother made it. One of my favorites! I season the beef and onions with mrs dash southwest chipotle, like we do on our burgers, and mix the cheese into the meat before adding the top bisquick mix. I also added cheese to the bisquick mix because never too much in my opinion. Top with ketchup

I followed the recipe using ground round, and my family really liked it!  The only comment they made was that there wasn't enough cheese.  Since it was already cooked, they just added cheese on top of their serving and microwaved it for a few seconds.  This is a definite repeat recipe for our family!

I made some changes. I added 1/2 cup of mayo and cooked bacon to the burger mix  to make it more creamy and savory. I also used cheese slices until the top was fully covered and used my homemade bisquick mix.  I have had this in the past without any changes and it was also a little dry but still good.

This is so easy, and so delicious!  My husband asks for this every year for his birthday dinner!  I usually make it with a combination of ground beef and mild Italian sausage....it's the ultimate comfort food.  Also great for potlucks!

I give this 5 stars because you can use your imagination and add so much to it . I chopped up pickles and diced tomatoes to it with a little Heinz 57 . Next time I might add bacon and a little bbq sauce .  You can make this dish however you like your burgers , the sky is the limit . Don’t be scared just do it !

It is truly impossibly easy - and so tasty!  Great for a quick, throw-together dinner with just a few ingredients.  The kids will love it, too.  

We serve ours with a side of pickles and ketchup.

Okay, honestly if you follow the recipe it does taste gross and bland, However, to make it tasty and loved by my family, I ramp it up. Instead of ground beef I use a combination of hot sausage and regular sausage.  In addition to cheddar cheese I add Ramona  cheese and sometimes Mozzarella cheese. Then I go a step further and add either a can of Veg-All or frozen vegetables.  Made this way, it's a die for recipe and for that last 15 years  my family has been using this recipe as a base for something totally awesome.  Remember, Recipe's are made for the masses. Be creative!

Based on the ingredients used, it was missing something. Pretty bland. Ended up throwing it out.  I'll try pancakes before I write Bisquick off.

This was a great recipe I used to use up 4 hamburgers left over from a cook out. I just crumbled the already cooked meat in with the cooked onion. Very yummy.

I used to make this years ago when the kids were young and yes it was a little blahhh. So now I took advice of a previous reviewer and sauteed the meat and onions seperately, added hamburger seasoning from McMormick, layered crumbled bacon and about 4 chopped slices of dill pickeles. Then I added 2 different cheeses and topped with bisquick mixture. Added some sliced tomatoes on top of the batter and baked. Wallaaa!
Very Good and super quick!!!

I make this on occasion and it's pretty good, quick and simple.  While no one raves about it, everyone eats it without complaint.  The only thing I do differently is season the meat like I was making a meatloaf--I add ketchup and some Worcestershire, garlic powder and Montreal steak seasoning. That's it.

This is a terrific recipe to add your own flair to! Want a little spice? Add some! Want it little extra flavor? Make it with sausage instead of ground beef! Endless possibilities! My granddaughter loves to come up with ideas to "make it a little different" each time.  It's an easy recipe to work with!

This was a really nice and easy recipe for a beginner at cooking (despite my age) to make.  

Like many reviewers here, I followed the advice that simply beef and onions were not enough.  I used vidallia onions, and also cut up a garlic dill pickle, and a small tomato, and drizzled the beef mixture with mustard (I did not have ketchup as some other reviewers drizzled or flat out put a bit of it on) .. It came out really well, I added pepper and garlic to the beef mixture also.

I will make this again, I also went a bit heavier on the sharp cheddar cheese I used.  The recipe filled my 9.5" Glass pie dish perfectly to the hilt, especially with the extra veggies and cheese that I used.

I call it Mexican Tourtière.  I add spicy salsa to the meat, and change the cheese for spicy Mexican type cheese instead of regular cheddar cheese.  EVERYONE who has tasted it always wants the recipe.  It's a winner!

This is such an easy recipe. To make it healthier and add more flavor, I used ground turkey instead of beef, added 1/2 cup extra cheese, 1tsp garlic and crumbled 4 slices of cooked chicken or turkey bacon.

My mom used to make this for us on snow days.  It's one of the first meals I learned to cook as a kid.  As written, it's a great recipe for picky eaters.   Just like  a basic cheeseburger, you can soup it up anyway you like.  Tonight I'm doing a riff on barbecue bacon cheeseburgers.  :)

Instead of using an entire white onion, I used half of a small white onion, and it worked better for me.  Also seasoned with salt and pepper, and a little bit of garlic salt.  Instead of the cheese on the recipe, I use fiesta blend cheese (not the taco blend with seasoning), and I add as much cheese as my heart's content.  It's a very easy go-to recipe that I can make without  batting an eye.

I browned my meat and diced onions in a cast iron skillet to save a step from putting it into a baking dish.  I added some seasonings to our liking.

Hubby ate half at dinner... he said it's a keeper!

This recipe hit the spot.  I used lean ground turkey instead of beef, but otherwise followed the recipe.  You could easily adapt the recipe to suit your own tastes, or just take it like it is - very simple and quick to put on the table and everyone ate it and enjoyed it.  Love to have fast and easy recipes that taste great and can be tweaked to meet your personal tastes!  Thank you!

I really wanted to like this recipe but i found it too eggy and i hate eggs. my husband loved it and said it was like a quiche. I added cumin and chili powder and Mexican-blend cheese. I suggest using cumin instead of a taco packet so that there will be less salt in your dish. I liked the flavors but i could not get over the egginess of the dish.

Going back 3 generations, my family uses ground sausage instead of hambuger and serves it for breakfast.  MUCH more flavorful because sausage is already seasoned and you don't have to add anything extra to doctor it up.  It's a staple breakfast at every camping trip.

I really wanted to like this, but even with spicing it up, this was an incredibly bland recipe. 1/2 teaspoon is no where near enough salt, and the topping is basically a pancake that absorbs all of the cheese. This is a pile of ground beef with a pancake on top of it.

This is a quick prep meal that my kids love.  Sometimes I change it up by adding taco seasoning and salsa to meat and use a cornbread mix with creamed corn as the crust for a taco pie.  Easy and my picky eaters love it.

This isn't exactly gourmet food...but it's an easy, quick dinner when you have a family. I add a can of condensed cheddar cheese soup to the meat and also some chopped dill pickles. I've also added chopped tomatoes and bacon on occasion.

Very easy to make, and the kids liked it, but my husband and myself didn't care for it at all. The texture was weird, and even with adding garlic and some spices, it was still bland.

This recipe was ok. It was really easy as the recipe states but it wasn't all that good.  It was like an egg bake. I would suggest using half a pould of hamburger and what else would be good is sausage.  Top with katcup.
