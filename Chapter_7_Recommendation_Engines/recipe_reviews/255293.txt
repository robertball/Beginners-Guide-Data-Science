Very good! I mixed 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 sup sour cream. Used about 4 cloves of roasted garlic (mashed). Dijon mustard. And added 1/2 tsp of smoked paprika. Yum!

I've used this sauce on just about everything, within reason! The base can be adjusted based on the planned dish, I dig this with fish,  fried wontons and assorted shell fish. I have even tried it on burgers. It is very versatile, awesome recipe!

Delicious! Great combo of flavors...I used yellow mustard b/c the recipe didn't specify, and that worked great. This is super versatile too. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was such a hit! I added a bit of garlic powder to up the taste of garlic- but was so good!

Complimented Chef Johnâ€™s Crab Cakes perfectly! I added one pinch of Cayenne but otherwise made no adjustments. Very good!

Simple and delicious.  Complements fish quite well.  I used Dijon mustard and half sour cream/ half mayonnaise.  Make ahead to allow the flavours to fuse.
