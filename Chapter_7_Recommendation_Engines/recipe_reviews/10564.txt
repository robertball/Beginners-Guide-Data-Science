These cookies are absolutely to die for!  I have tried alot of good and excellent cookies before but I can't even describe the sensation these gave my mouth.  INCREDIBLE!!!!  Thank you so much for dragging this recipe card out to share with everyone.  I did however make a few changes only because I don't keep lard in my house.  I used 2 cups of margarine instead of 1 cup of margarine and 1 cup of lard.  I cooked them for 12 minutes instead of 20.  My children went nuts for them.

I made this and it was SooOOOooo good.  My kids helped me roll the dough into balls, and in the sugar, and we had a great time.  Also, these cookies keep very well in the freezer.  If you are thinking about substituting margarine for the butter that is called for in this recipe, DON'T.  I tried making these for my sister in-law that has a milk alergy, but the turned out terribly when margarine was used (twice).

AWESOME!  My Grandma used to make these, I thought it was a secret family recipe until now :)  These are addicting. I rolled the dough in balls, dipped them in water,then sugar, did a criss/cross with a fork and then sprinkled red and green sugar for a festive holiday look.  Highly recommended!

Yummy, these are really good. These are a crunchy, terrific flavoured, nutty cookie. I made these up as part of my "care packages" too share with my family but must admit, I have eaten so many of them, they didn't get as many as planned. This will be a keeper, make again, and again recipe in my home. Thank you for sharing!

This is one awesome cookie! I'm making them to take to the Christmas pagent at church and I'll be proud to take them.  I didn't take the time to chill them and they still turned out excellent. They are soft too, which I appreciate.

Loved this recipe! We discovered when you make them bigger, about the size of two walnuts, then bake them for just 15 minutes, they remained soft and chewy. Also, I only used 4 cups of flour, the dough was getting too stiff. I love Vanilla, so added two teaspoons. We will make this one again and again, maybe for Christmas in July too!

I used the conversion to change the amount to 3 doz. enstead of 8 doz.  Something must have been wrong.  The cookies were very cake like and NO flavor.

The cookies were easy, but I was disappointed in them.  They weren't the best tasting cookie.
