Saw this on ARTV. Just had to make it. Love the crust flavor. Subbed in a little bit of pecans with the almonds. Good flavor on the filling, even with the dreaded tofu, LOL! Tastes like a chocolate pudding pie. The crust crumbled for me trying to get it out of the pan, still tasted great all mixed in with the filling. I microwaved the chips to melt, worked fine. Just 45 seconds and stir, less time at the end. I had extra filling left over, I would suggest a deeper pie plate as the crust was thick in my shallow 9". In the video she says to only cook it 10 minutes and didn't cool it before she put the filling in. Try it, you'll like it! Thanks for the recipe.

This turned out very rich. It was a little too rich for my husbands tastes. No one guessed that it had tofu in it.

This is so good and it is so easy to make!!  No anti-tofu people will ever even know it is in there.

This was extremely easy recipe and the finished product was delicious.  I used a pre-made graham cracker crust due to laziness and soft tofu instead of silken because the store was out of it.
If I did not make this myself, I would not know that it was tofu.  I also like that the recipe did not call for any added sugar.

This was great!  I made it exactly as the recipe said and I couldn't wait to eat it after tasting the filling.  It was even better the second day when it was completely cold.  I'm planning to try this again with a mint Newman O's crust and mint extract rather than vanilla in the filling.

Used 8" spring form pan, full crust recipe and half the filling recipe cuz I only had 1 package  of tofu. Only bake crust for 10 minutes. SOOOOOOOO GOOD! Semisweet chocolate amazing! Almonds in crust OMG! This is an easy, elegant, decadent dessert with no apologies or excuses. Could garnish with any number of fruit, nut or other flavors and create a totally different experience. I could seriously eat the whole tart/pie!

I had one package of tofu, so I cut the recipe in half. I had a prepared graham crust to use up, and it was very delicious, you can't tell it's Tofu! Thank you!

It turned out really rich tasting! The flavour was too much for me. The vanilla extract was really noticeable and gave it an alcohol like taste(not good).

Really liked this recipe. I like dark chocolate, so I subbed 2cups dark, 1cup semisweet. I liked it, but bf thought it was a bit bitter. So I made a peanut butter topping with just peanut butter, semisweet chocolate, and whipping cream blended quite thick. Spread it on top then topped it off with chopped (food processor) honey roasted and reg roasted almonds. It was SOOOO GOOD!!!
