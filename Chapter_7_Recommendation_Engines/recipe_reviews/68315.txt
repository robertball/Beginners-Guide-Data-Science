Someone mistakenly gave us a bag of raw peanuts that he thought were roasted.  What to do with nasty, raw peanuts?  Allrecipes to the rescue!  My peanuts only took about 13 minutes to roast.  Warm, fresh roasted peanuts--yum! I might even consider deliberately buying raw peanuts in the future.

Good recipe! It's best to stir once during roasting so that all peanuts are evenly roasted. Thanks!

Quick, easy way to roast some peanuts.  The package of raw peanuts only had a recipe for boiling 'em.  Thanks for sharing this, they were at hit at work.

Worked great, but you really do have to watch them closely towards the end or they'll burn.

I tried it but did not find the taste to be anything special... just a little better than raw

The aroma of fresh roasted peanuts brings back childhood memories. Great taste after 12 minutes and stirring halfway through the roasting time. Make sure you don't judge when they are done by the color of the shell.

I think the warning about the suddenness should be stronger. The color of the peanuts wasn't a reliable indicator, as there was variation between the initial brownness and rate of color change between peanuts. I baked some raw peanuts in my oven for 15 minutes and found that they were overdone and tasted burnt. I tried another batch for 12 minutes with the same disappointing results. Finally, I did a systematic experiment where I removed a peanut to taste at exactly 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 minutes. I found that 8 and 9 minute peanuts were underdone, 11 and 12 minute peanuts were overdone, and the 10 minute peanuts were just right. It's that sensitive!

I used a 13x9 pan because it was what was available and it worked for about a pound of nuts. I also added spices to mine: Webster Garlic and Herb seasoning, Cayenne Pepper and a touch of salt. I made them for my husband, the spice fiend in our home, and he loves it!
