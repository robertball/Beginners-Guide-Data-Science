Hearty and delicious soup! I used smoked scamorza cheese instead of cheddar and left out the rosemary, still a very nice soup. It has a creamy texture and a smokey flavour from the pancetta, cheese and roasted cauliflower it is a warm night by the fire in a bowl! Thank you Lora for your recipe.

I was going to rate this 5-stars even before I realized I forgot to add the cheese! The cheese made it even better. It was also very salty, and I realized I had used broth instead of stock. Definitely don't make that mistake - the cheese and pancetta provide plenty of salt. I will definitely be making this again (the right way)!

Followed to to a tee. Just delicious. Put some homemade croutons on top. A full meal. Was a hit with everyone. Thanks for a relatively easy, tasty soup.

Great! I used brociflower instead of cauliflower and added a little heavy cream at the end. Great recipe!
