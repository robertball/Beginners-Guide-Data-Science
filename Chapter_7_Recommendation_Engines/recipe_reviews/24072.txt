What they didn't tell you is that when you whisk the syrup and gelatin together, use a big bowl! It said use a small saucepan for the syrup and a small bowl to warm the gelatin and then whisk together when it was time. What they don't tell you is that it explodes!! For the first time candy maker, this would have been a helpful hint. I'll definitly try this recipe again, because I really want to learn to make marshmallows, but I'll wait till another day.

Wonderful recipe!  A little messy but way worth the time.  I suggest four indispensable tools to tackle this recipe: a medium to large non-stick saucepan, a candy thermometer, a non-stick silicone-coated spoon or spatula and a good standing-electric mixer. I used a decent 3-quart non-stick saucepan to heat the simple syrup mixture.  It worked wonders, especially after adding the softened gelatin.  The cooled substance causes the syrup to foam substantially.  The larger saucepan accomodated well.  (Hint: a package of unflavored gelatin equals the amount needed for the recipe.) The trick to keeping the syrup and gelatin from separating is to mix it thoroughly before setting it aside.  My 5-quart KitchenAid helped to whip the whites into the beautiful marshmallow fluff.  Won't say it can't be done with a hand mixer, but I'd try half a batch at a time and recruit another set of hands to help pour the syrup/gelatin mixture into the soft-peaked egg whites.  

I just recently learned what a See's Candies Scotch Kiss is (marshmallow wrapped in soft caramel).  This recipe produces marshmallows quite similar in texture and taste (soft/light and not too sweet).  I used the Caramels by Barbara recipe to envelope the marshmallows.  YUM!  I WILL make these for Christmas!!!  :-)

The flavor of this recipe is worth 5 stars but the instructions are worth 2-3 stars... Thank goodness for some other reviews.  I hope the following details are helpful for others.
It is easy when you break it down – Start with the sugar mixture.  While the sugar is boiling to temperature, then work on the gelatin.  While the gelatin melts, then work on the egg whites.  Don’t forget to check the sugar syrup intermittently since once it reaches 245, it will quickly go to 260.  Also this is much easier to do in a stand mixer than with a hand mixer.  The amount of “fluff” is a lot.

*Sugar syrup – Use a large saucepan or small stock pot. It will make it easier to add the gelatin mixture later.  It takes about 15 minutes to get the syrup to temperature over medium/medium-high heat.
  
*Blooming the gelatin - Put 3/4 cup of COLD water in a small saucepan and sprinkle each tablespoon (or envelope) of gelatin over the water slowly in an even layer.  Let rest for 3-5 minutes.  Place the saucepan over low heat and stir until the gelatin mixture is totally liquid.  Keep over low heat if this liquefies before the syrup is ready.

*Egg whites – Once gelatin is liquid, put whites in bowl Beat until soft peaks form.  Turn off mixer while finishing the sugar-gelatin mixture.  Turn the mixer back on to low speed before adding the sugar mixture in a steady stream.  (It may be easier to transfer the sugar-gelatin mixture to a large measuring cup before beginning to pour. I have an 8-cup one tha

My sister and I decided to make this recipe to see what all the hype was with homemade marshmallows.  We planned on making it strictly according to the recipe, but once we realized how involved it was (for marshmallows, anyway), we decided to skip the vanilla and go with the peppermint and red food coloring idea.  The results were fantastic.  Now we wonder why they don't sell peppermint marshmallows in the store.  It tastes great by itself or with hot chocolate or a latte.  I did use a large bowl when mixing the syrup and gelatin (the other reviewers were right-it really does explode like a science experiment!)  And the hot water really does help with cutting and clean up.  This recipe, in peppermint form, is a keeper.  Too much trouble in the regular version, I think.

This recipe is AMAZING! These tase exactly like Peeps! Instead of putting the marshmallows in a pan, I put the pixture into a plastic bag, cut a hole in the corner and piped out different shapes. It was so much fun! I will make these again!

This was soooo fun!!  I will note that when you combine the sugar mixture with the gelatin, it explands quite a bit.  Just make sure your pan is large enough for that.  I added 3/4 tsp of peppermint extract to the sugar mixture after mixing with the gelatin.  I also added a swirl of red food coloring at the end, and a few crushed peppermints to the top.  I cut these and put them into clear bags and gave as gifts with cocoa.  Beautiful presentation for the holidays or Valentine's Day, yummy recipe!  I will agree with some of the others that the cutting was quite labor intensive...and messy, messy.  Use powdered sugar and a warm knife.

The final product is wonderful...especially if instead of vanilla you add peppermint extract, or caramel flavoring. I have only one complaint the recipe didn't warn us that when you add the warm gelatin mixture to the hot sugar mixture it GROWS ALOT. Do NOT use a small saucepan or you'll be scraping sugar boogers off of everything when the pan bubbles over.

This will be our second year in a row to make this recipe (a holiday treat!).  If peppermint extract is substituted for vanilla extract, and if a tiny bit of red food coloring is swirled through the mixture with a butter knife before it sets, a delightful and colorful result ensues, perfect for dressing up a hot cocoa for a special occasion.

I love this recipe! We used kosher gelatin. It was so good to finally have kosher marshmallows so the kids could enjoy smores around the campfire. All our friends abandoned their storebought jet-puff marshmallows to try ours, they loved them too. Fun to make, easy to clean up and great flavor.

Very nice marshmallow recipe. Having made marshmallows before, I have a couple of suggestions: 1. After blooming the gelatin, you can actually microwave it into a liquid (be careful not to burn it!) so pouring the syrup into it goes more smoothly. 2. To make a nice flat surface of marshmallow to work with, instead of dusting the pan with conf. sugar, lightly coat it with cooking spray, then put a layer of plastic wrap on it to line the pan, and coat the plastic wrap with cooking spray again. You can easily pour the marshmallow into this pan. Then cut another piece of plastic big enough to cover the marshmallow and before putting it on the marshmallow, spray that with cooking spray and put the sprayed side down on the marshmallow surface. This way, you can use your hands to flatten out the surface evenly and after letting it set up, you can just pull the plastic out of the pan and flip the marshmallow out of the greased pan. THEN you can dust it with confectioners sugar.

This is the best recipe for Easter! I made them and took them to a party, when I came back they were gone in about 2 minutes. I was very suprised! Afterward when everyone found out that I made them I was asked by at least 20 or 30 people for the recipe! I will definatly use this recipe again!!!!

We used brown rice syrup instead of corn syrup because we have a little one with a corn allergy. She's never had marshmallows before. They turned out FABULOUS!!! Texture and taste was perfect, almost exactly like store bought Peeps. YUM!!! Thanks!!!

Worked out perfectly. But you have the instructions backwards. Fluff the egg whites. Then dissolve the gelatin. Then make the syrup.

I used the exact ingredients. I put my gelatin in a bowl without heating it, to the side.  I could not get my sugar to 250 so I made do when it leveled off at 200.  It looked perfect so maybe it was a thermometer issue.  When my syrup was ready, I plopped the gelatin into my egg whites in the mixer, then slowly poured in the very hot syrup. I didn't wait for it to cool.  It worked great.  I used vanilla.    What I really want to add to these great reviews is that you can feel free to roll your cut marshmallows in quite a bit of confectioners sugar. I was worried they would taste like blocks of confectioners sugar, but after one and two days, they only seem to get better. The confectioners sugar is absorbed, makes the cut marshmallows very easy to handle, and only tastes like a light coating of sugar, like what you can taste on the outside of Peeps (only not that strong).      Also, the half of my batch that I rolled in crushed candy cane, looked wet and sticky the next morning.  I had to roll those in confectioners sugar too.  It would have been best to roll them in a mixture of candy cane and confectioners sugar the first time.    They do taste great and I will use this recipe again soon.  People seemed happy to receive them as gifts because most people wouldn't go to the trouble to make them, but are curious to taste them homemade style.

Wow. I really needed kosher marshmallows, so I tried a "professional" recipe out of a cookbook and it was a horrendous flop (white gummi worms, anyone?). Still, necessity is the mother of motivation if nothing else, so I decided to brave this one. PERFECTION. Use a candy thermometer and get a pair of extra hands to keep the eggs whipping or use a standing mixer; those are the only extra tips I used. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I was freaking out because it's a hot, humid day here, but that didn't have any negative effect. Yay!

This is good standard recipe but I have to agree with others that if you're going to do the work you definitely should be making them flavored.  As is I'm sure this makes good plain marshmallows but with some additions it made great specialty marshmallows.  I'm very grateful for the reviews made here because I wouldn't have known to use a big pan...thank you.   I tried the cappuccino idea out and it was amazing.  Just mixed together unsweetended cocoa powder, instant espresso, cinnamon, vanilla and boiling water .  Once I combined the syrup, gelatin and egg whites together I added the cappuccino mix.  Keep in mind this will thin out the marshmallow mix so you'll have to whip it for longer.  I probably left my mixer on medium for 3-4 minutes and the consistency thickened up perfectly.  Just make sure it looks like something you'd have to spread out (not pour) into the dish...similar to a brownie batter.  I can't wait to try other variations like pumpkin spice or white chocolate.  It's not a difficult process but it requires some time and cleanup.  Still worth it in my book.

I love to experiment with recipes. Since joining Allrecipes I have had more fun making and baking things that I was always was curious about. This recipe has satisfied the closet chemist in Me and the candy maker fantasy, at onetime . I impressed Myself! Thank You Emily!

These are great!  This is my first time making any candy and it turned out okay.  I didn't have a candy thermometer so I dropped a droplet of sugar into cold water to see if it formed a rigid ball and when it did, it was around 15 minutes.  Mine wasn't as stiff as I thought it would be and I think it's because I didn't beat it long enough at the end.  The instructions didn't say how long to beat it for.  And I put mine ina 9x13 pan and it was like a quarter of an inch thick.  I'll definitely try it again.

I split the difference here, it could be 5 stars for flavor, but 3 stars for vague directions...I didn't read the reviews  first, so was completely unprepared for the "explosion" in the tiny saucepan I was using...oops!  turned out ok though, didn't overflow...I was worried about the syrup, as I had no idea how long it would take to reach the correct temp, it took about 15 minutes, some timing guidelines would have been helpful...I also didn't really know how long to beat the mixture for at the end, and I think I stopped too soon, as I tried to make peeps, but they ended up as a flat blob of marshmellow, I tried to wait a bit until they cooled and might hold their shape, but they didn't...still flat blobs..  I gave up the peeps idea and poured into a sugared pan, and they turned out really great.  They taste like marshmellows, only fresher...I'll certainly try these again with a few adjustments.  We're going to roast some over a campfire tonight, can't wait!

Just made these and I have to say that at the beginning of the process I thought I was going to have to chalk this one up as one of those recipes that sounds good but doesn't live up to the hype...., I'm happy to say, that these turned out really well.  Like other reviewers have said, once you have these, you won't want to go back to the store bought marshmallows!  A couple of things I noted for the next time I make them:  4T of unflavored gelatin = 5 envelopes of Knox; get your water simmering, so  once you add the Knox to your 1/2 c water, you can set that on top right away - otherwise it gets a little clumpy - which, by the way, does dissolve once it warms up; the vanilla you use makes a big difference in taste, and finally, work fast when getting the final product into your pan - waiting even a minute or two makes it a bit harder to spread.  Fun recipe that tastes great!  Will be giving these with gourmet hot chocolate and vintage looking mugs for Christmas gifts.  Thanks for sharing!!

The recipe is 5 stars by itself, but the directions are a little unclear, and I made some boo-boos on my own. First mistake was using the egg whites from a carton!!! I was being lazy, and I paid for it. Second mistake was not beating the egg whites long enough. A few more mistakes, and I get something runny (but it still tastes good!) So I'll let it set overnight and see how it turns out.  but I'll try my darnedest to get mine as perfect as the ones in the pictures! I'm using a frog mold to get the Peppermint Toads from Harry Potter! I used different recipes in the past, but they always worked out...

I made these for Easter and dipped them in mint milk chocolate. Delicious!!! They were not difficult to make and everyone enjoyed them. My daughter likes to put them in the freezer for awhile before eating. Someone said, "why would you make marshmallows?" Just like trying something new/different. They were a success!

I used a mixture of toasted coconut and confectioner's sugar to coat the marshmallows - very tasty!  Be careful when adding the gelatin mixture to the hot syrup mixture.  I must have added it too quickly (in too small a pot) because the whole thing started to overflow.  Next time, I'd do this part over the sink.

Yep! This is the one. I doubled the batch, used parchment paper in a 13x9 pan and when they were set I pulled the whole thing out onto the counter to cut. I used all purpose flour to keep them from sticking while cutting and they turned out perfect! Love me some (kosher!) mallows :)  Another hint: do yourself a favor and start the gelatin 20 min before the syrup so it's all ready at the same time. Also when you have the finished product ready to go into pans you can throw in your butter and Rice Krispies, press that into the pan and there you have some RK treats!

This is the first marshmallow recipe I've used with egg whites, so I was curious to see how it came out versus the sugar/gelatin only version. I thought the amount of gelatin was too high, so I cut it down to one packet per cup of sugar and it turned out perfectly. These were much lighter than my previous ones and they kept their volume. They also weren't crazy sweet, with is what I like. I plan on making these again.

I just couldn't waite to make these.  My husband loves peeps.  He said these were really great.  They do taste good, but I couldn't get them to look like peeps.  I tried putting some into a plastic bag to pipe out.  That didn't work at all.  I ended up useing a spoon and my finger.  I will be trying again.  I don't have a themomature but I thought it was easy to make.  Wish I could have made them into shapes though.

These didn't turn out quite the way I expected - I think after reading some reviews I will add more flavoring next time. Also they were VERY difficult to cut, perhaps piping them out is the best answer. I'll likely try again but after reading more into other recipes.

Great recipe, an easy to follow way to make home-made marshmallows but I think there was a little too much vanilla involved.  Slightly overbearing.  Otherwise, a keeper.

FIRSTLY, ONLY COMBINE THE SUGAR MIXTURE AND GELATIN IN A LARGE BOWL OR PAN. I am not an experienced candy maker so I did not know that it would EXPLODE. I completely ruined the first batch. After that, everything worked great and I will make these again. These are phenomenal. I made these for my work Christmas Cookie Boxes and everyone loved them and couldn't believe they were homemade. I would love to try the swirl design in the picture but maybe after a few successful batches. I will certainly be making these again. I am only giving it less stars because of the lack of warning about mixing methods.

This recipe is great.  However, I dusted the pan with cornstarch rather than powdered sugar, as that's what the manufacturers use, and it costs less.  For Easter, I filled an oblong pan about half full of cornstarch, then used a plastic Easter egg to make impressions in the cornstarch.  Then I put the marshmallow into the impressions.  After it set up, I dipped the marshmallow eggs in chocolate, and added icing decorations after the chocolate set up.  Voila!  Marshmallow Easter eggs!  I used an extra large oblong pan, and a medium sized plastic egg.  I had room in the pan to make 12 eggs, and had marshmallow left over, which I put into a square pan.

The ingredients were good, but the order of doing things was off.  (That's the only reason for the 3 stars)  I made the first batch in the order it was written, but it was very stressful.  My syrup was done way before my eggs so it had to just sit there. It got kinda clumpy so it didn't pour well into the eggs.  The second time I made it, I changed the order.  I started my eggs, then I started the geletin, then I started the sugar mixture.  This was smoother going.  The eggs were done before my syrup mixture so the syrup poured into the eggs nice and smooth.  Also, just a yummy tip for those who want something a little different. Instead of vanilla, I bought flavoring to add to it.  I did cheesecake flavor and they were so yummy!!  Thanks for the recipe.

I found that if you let the syrup mixture cool for a few minutes before you add the gelatin it doesn't foam over the smaller pan. The marshmallows were the exact same! :D

I used this recipe to make chocolate covered eggs for Easter. The marshmallow part was relatively easy to make, but not easy enough to make my own marshmallows rather than buy them from the store! I used a pastry bag with no tip to make marshmallow shapes with the mixture before it hardened. This was not very easy, and the mixture hardened before I could turn all of it into eggs. After letting them sit overnight, I dusted them with a little powdered sugar and then dipped the eggs in chocolate coating. They tasted just like the marshmallow eggs from the store! My family really loved them, and they looked and tasted great. Thanks for sharing!

I did not care for this recipe at all. The gelatin doesn't mix in with the egg whites, and it leaves the marshmallow in chunks.  We tried to make easter chicks out of them, and they wouldn't shape.  The sugar wouldn't even stick to them.  We almost ruined our mixer trying to make them the stuff got so hard.

This recipe makes fantastic marshmallows!  The directions are a little vague, but after working out the kinks, I can make marshmallows in about half an hour in any flavor possible. Make sure to add the gelatin mix very slowly and whisk into the sugar syrup. To mix it up a little bit, add 1/4 c. Cocoa powder, 1 tsp almond extract, or peppermint extract.

Very good. SO when I made them there was no "explosion" or "expansion" of the sugar/gelatin mixture. I was worried it wouldn't work but when I mixed it with the egg whites it worked great. At first it took a while in my kitchenaid mixer to get the egg white/sugar/gelatin mixture to form stiff peaks but it did "grow" in size. I got a doulble batch from this one recipe. Double meaning I made 2 8x8 pans with leftovers! My husband a three year old liked the marshmallow cream. I made one batch as the recipe called for and the other batch peppermint. It only took me 30 minutes. I will definently make again!

Still cooling, but I snuck a taste or two while they were still hot and it was really yummy!  I have some leftover yellow food coloring and banana flavoring, so I may add those next time.

These are so fun! I thought the directions worked just fine as written, although I did use a large saucepan. I made the "peppermint" variation others suggested, and it was great. Also, the second time I made them I greased the pan instead of using confectioners sugar. The 10x sugar got very hard and clumpy when I used it the first time.

Awesome!!! so exciting to make my own marshmallows!! :D  I would say to pour the gelatin into the syrup very slowly and carefully because at first it will bubble up really high - just keep whisking it until it settles & then pour the rest of the gelatin in.  Thank you!!

I just made them!  I didn't have any problem or explosions.  I spent some time prepping: First I mixed the sugar, syrup and water and just put it is a large nonstick saucepan on the stove. Next I mixed the gelatin and water in the top of a double boiler and set it on the stove. Then I beat the 2 egg whites like the recipe suggested. After all of that I boiled the syrup mixture and heated the water in the double boiler to dissolve the gelatin.  I also used a candy thermometer for the syrup mixture.  I don't have a standing mixer, so I poured the gelatin/syrup into a smaller more manageable container and slowly added it to the egg whites.  I had to beat it for quite a while on high, but it came out great!  I also used peppermint and little vanilla.  Finally I mixed a little food coloring into it! :)

This first time I made this the marshmallows didn't turn out. But that was my fault because I didn't mix the marshmallows long enough and I didn't have a candy thermometer. I strongly recommend buying a candy thermometer to make this recipe.  The second time I made these they turned out wonderfully. Everybody devoured these marshmallows.  This recipe would be great for making your own marshmallow chicks at easter.

I can see why Emily is famous.  Our family does not eat pork products, so homemade marshmallows are the only way for us to enjoy them.  I get beef gelatin at Akins.  And let me tell you, Sa'mores made from these marshmallows are to die for! Oh yeah, they are the best for hot chocolate too!  I can just imagine "Peeps", moon pies, rocky road ice cream...I have to go make another batch.

I tried this recipe 3 times, following the instructions to a T and taking the advice of the reviewers here, yet still when I had left them overnight they were just a goopy mess in the morning. Very disappointing, I was planning on cutting them up and giving them as gifts today, but now I have to make a last minute run to the store to buy something instead.

The kids and I loved this recipe.  We used my favorite vanilla from Cozumel, Mexico and it took on that great flavor.  We colored sugar by adding a few drops of food coloring to about 3/4 cup of regular sugar in a sandwich sized zip lock bag.  We used the colored sugar to coat our "Peeps".

Great recipe!  To prep the pan, I grease it with butter, line it with foil, grease the foil, then coat liberally with powdered sugar!  Works GREAT!

I used a 9 X 13 pan too... and just cut them in squares and tossed in powdered sugar.  Yums!

I'm giving these as christmas gifts this year and they are super easy and even more tasty! I only let them sit for 2 hours, and cut them out with mini cookie cutters and they turned out fine. After cutting, however, I let them sit for probably 4-5 hours, just so they harden slightly. That way they don't stick to eachother.

Okay all you Mounds Bar lovers, here's a fun tip with your homemade marshmallows. Allow your marshmallows to "age" for 24 hours. Make sure they are nicely coated on all sides with powered sugar (shake of excess).  You'll need a cup each of chocolate chips and flaked sweetened coconut.  Melt some dark chocolate chips (about a cup for 1 minute on high in microwave, stir,  and heat a few seconds longer if chips aren't melting when stirred.) Take a cookie sheet and cover with waxed paper, set aside. Take one marshmallow, and with the slightly cooled chocolate spread all sides except the bottom. A small spoon works fine for this. Set this on the lined cookie sheet and immediately sprinkle and pat coconut on all the chocolate covered surfaces. Do the same with the remaining chocolate and coconut.  Let these sit for a couple of hours for chocolate to "set up". This only makes about 6 (I cut my marshmallows into 2 inch squares prior to all of this). Just repeat the process if you want more. Work in small batches to keep the chocolate at the right temperature. These are fabulous alone or served on top of a hot brownie and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. So easy, and so incredible!!

This recipe was a disaster for me!  It definitely was NOT easy.  It created quite a mess.  I first reviewed this in 2003.  Now there are so many reviews to read perhaps I could find my mistake. After seeing the beautiful pictures, I'm going to have to give this another try.   It was a rainy  day, perhaps that was a problem.

this recipe was just horrible.  the ggs white separated from the gelatin and i had clear at the bottom and white meringue on the top.  took a bite of it and the consistency and taste was disgusting.  i'm done trying to make marshmallows.  too much work and not that great.  i don't know how the previous reviewers did it.

Read the reviews first!!!!  I did the recipe a bit backwards due to some previous reviews and it worked out perfectly.  I started the sugar mixture out cooking, then bloomed the gelatine and placed that over the simmering pot of water in a LARGE metal mixing bowl. (the size you would use for a cake)  Then while both mixtures were doing their respective things, I started the egg whites.  They took a few minutes and I actually had a few minutes more to wait until the sugar reached the right temperature.  Other reviewers were right, the sugar takes about 15 minutes and mine never got to 250, I stopped waiting for it at 240.  I poured the SUGAR mixture INTO the gelatine mixture, no problem with the explosion problems, I used a small saucepan for the sugar mixture.  I did the trick with greasing the pan, then lining it with plastic wrap and greasing that again.  Covered all with a greased plastic top also and Voila!, all seems great.  I checked them a few minutes ago, 30 minutes after putting them in the pan and they seem like light, fluffy, softly jelled marshmallows.  Nothing tough and chewy looking yet, just fluffy and pretty.  Has that texture right now of the Coconut jello at the Hawaiian restaurants.  My plan is to cut them  into candy sized squares, dip all but one side in melted caramel and then dark chocolate. *** I only beat them for about 5 minutes after adding all together so I hope  I didn't under beat them, they got thicker, yes, but not overly thick.

These were a disaster, but a tasty disaster that ended up ok after all.  I completely burned the first batch, due to my brand new candy thermometer which was 60 degrees off.  Go figure.  I knew I should have calibrated that thing...  Second batch went much better just using the cold water test.  Unfortunately I was interrupted in the middle by my 2 month old, so after breaking for a quick feeding, my gelatin mixture was already beginning to set up.  I tried to pour it into my egg white mixture anyways, but "pouring" was sort of a joke by this point, so it was more like gloppy spoonfuls that got pulled up into the spinning mechanism of my KA mixer.  Glop got EVERYWHERE.  And I do mean EVERYWHERE.  My husband essentially had to partially dismantle my mixer to get it clean.  I don't know how I actually got ENOUGH of the glop into the egg mixture to actually make these work, but somehow I must've!  These were fantastic in cocoa and I also used them to make an AWESOME homemade peppermint mocha. (Made peppermint mallows instead of vanilla).  My kids were eating them by the spoonful.  Even I enjoyed them, and I actually hate marshmallows.  So, despite the disasters, call me crazy, but I'm making another batch today.  Only thing I'll change is to cut the peppermint extract to 1/2 tsp.  One full tsp was just a little too strong for my tastes.  Next project: Hot chocolate on a stick with a homemade peppermint marshmallow in between two chocolate blocks.

Very easy and fun to make. I made the pepermint and then cut them into star shapes. Kids and adults get a big kick out of them. Even people who claim "ooh, I'm not a fan of marshallows." love them.

Great tasting marshmallows.  I mixed the icing sugar with a little corn starch to keep it flowing better (it's a bit warm here so it tends to clump).  I just used a saucepan and heated it gently for the gelatin and it worked fine.  I didn't have too much of a problem with the syrup and gelatin bubbling, I used a big pot and let it sit for a minute before I whisked the gelatin in.  The only hard part was trying to whisk egg whites and syrup together with a hand mixer (good workout)  I also let mine sit overnight before cutting

These were perfect.  I made them as written, but put the mixture in a 13x9, not a 9x9.  I'm glad I did.  I was able to cut many marshmallows for cocoa.  I am looking forward to making this with peppermint extract next.  Great recipe!

These are awesome! They are so easy and fun! We colored them Christmas colors. I did not find any problem cutting them, I just used a sharp knife and it was fine. We buttered and then powdered sugared our pan because the sugar didn't stick otherwise. And yeah, don't use a small pan or it will explode! I use a medium one and it just barely fit without making a mess. Awesome recipe!

I have never tried making homemade marshmallows before so this was a real test.  I thought they were good but sticky and hard to work with .  Next time I will use the cornstarch tip because I seem to be using a lot of powdered sugar to keep them from sticking together and now they seem a little too sweet.  I crushed some candy canes in the food processor and dusted the marshmallows with them then after cutting I shook the sticky marshmallows in a bag with some more candy cane and powdered sugar.  They looked beautiful and tasted great!  Definitely going to make again and try a few alterations.

Fantastic!! Directions are very clear and if followed will turn out perfection. I used peppermint extract instead of vanilla and dipped some of mine in chocolate for an extra treat. I used Knox brand gelatin and the amount called for in the recipe was an entire box which is 4 packets. These are much more expensive to make than store bought but they taste better and the extra bonus is me, my oldest son, and granpa had a blast in the kitchen making these. I would highly suggest this recipe for some mega fun in the kitchen!!!

This is the best marshmallow recipe I've tried and I'll definitely stick with it. I did add a pinch of salt to the hot mixture while it was whipping, and I used 1 tbsp. of clear vanilla. These were HEAVENLY to make s'mores with. HEAVENLY. Nothing like storebought - light and creamy and barely sticky. I know the recipe says to let them sit overnight, but mine are always mostly set in about 30 minutes, and I'm able to cut them within two hours.

This is a great recipe. But you should have a Kitchen Aid mixer, I don't, the fluff climbed up my beaters.I made the marshmallows, then the chewy caramel from this site. I layered some caramel over the marshmallow, sprinkled some nuts on, then dipped in almond bark. YUM!

So very yummy! This was my first time attempting marshmallows so I read the reviews and then followed the recipe with one sub. I didn't have unflavored gelatin, so I used a package of sugar free strawberry jello. By the other reviews I was expecting this to take awhile,but I think from prep to clean-up took 30 minutes tops! I did use my stand mixer which moved things along. I would deff. recommend this recipe and will be making again!

WONDERFUL, perfect, fluffy marshmallows! Thank you so much for this great recipe.  My kids loved making these.  We will be making them for years to come to go with our homemade Christmas hot cocoa!  One note:  Be sure to follow the recipe carefully and whip until the mixture is very stiff in the last step.  I am going to try adding peppermint extract and a little green color next time.  :)

This Recipe is GREAT! A word of advice though. If you don't want the simple syrup and gel to foam everywhere, wisk in a tiny bit of the gelitin until the foam disappears THEN wisk in the rest. NO MESS! I added 2 tsp of vanilla for extra pop. The family loved them. With everything in front of you in the store you get the idea that homemade is hard but they are not, I dont think I'll be buying Marshmallows again!

I made this homemade marshmallow to replace a marshmallow topping for s'mores pie that used 5 egg whites, because I didn't have that many.  Despite some difficulty getting the gelatine to dissolve, it ended up making a LOT of tasty marshmallow.  I added extra vanilla, because I really like it.  In the end, I only have one small warning - beware of the extreme stickyness!  I've found that it's easier to cut the marshmallow if you run a sharp knife under hot water then dry it off (otherwise the marshmallow will stick to it and you will NEVER get it off cleanly)

I made these once and they didn't work but I think that was my fault the second time I made them they were perfect! I've had them for a bit of time and they're still good. They make a really nice melted top for hot chocolate.

This was a fun recipe and it turned out great.  I'm very glad that I had a stand mixer though because it took at least 10 minutes for the egg white mixture to get hard.  I did add peppermint extract - wow - be careful!  I used 1/2 tsp and it was way too much.  Next time I will also make them in a bigger pan so that they aren't so thick.

These were excellent. Very good recipe. I followed directions exactly and also used the knife in hot water trick. I had read another suggestion stating you would use one packet of gelatin, I used FOUR (that is in one box) to equal 4 Tablespoons of gelatin. I also had to add a touch more hot water to the gelatin to make it dissolve. These are very good, and not as tough to make as you may think. I did make mine on a clear day and I would definitly suggest that to anyone making them. Happy eating!

I tried this recipe as a first foray into candy making.  The results were very good and my family really enjoyed the marshmallows.  I used 1/2 tsp peppermint extract instead of vanilla. This was added when beating the final mixture.  I found some tips in the reviews helpful:  
- Do the egg whites first, then the gelatin, then the sugar mixture.
- Use a pizza cutter to cut the finished product
- Use a stand mixer if you have one
- I lined the pan with plastic wrap coated with non-stick spray.  The marshmallows fell right out.
- Using a mixture of 1 part powdered sugar and 1 part cornstarch to coat the marshmallows eliminates stickiness.
I found the comments about the sugar mixture foaming up when the gelatin is added to be exaggerated somewhat.  It does foam up but only for a moment.  A medium saucepan is fine.  Use caution when beating the final mixture, if it gets too stiff it becomes difficult to pour and spread in the pan.  It did spread but the tops of my marshmallows were "mountainous" instead of smooth.  Next time I will pour into pan when the mixture still drips slowly from the beater blade.

Tip: instead of cutting - use mini-cupcake pan instead! Worked perfectly to have rounded marshmallows, which separate very easily - merely tug gently to separate. Also, I filled the cups with nonpareils (rainbow) which worked just as well as confectionery sugar and made for some pretty marshmallows.

Sorry, did not like these at all.  Extremely moist and while the set up just fine, they tend to be more like a thick mousse rather than marshmallow.  I also made a different recipe right after this with 3/4 cup of light corn syrup and no egg white and it came out perfect!!  Going with the other one as my favorite.

This is a great recipe! I am glad I read other reviews first, though, as the larger pan recommendation for mixing the sugar and gelatin mix was really important! I got a little confused with the word 'stiff' in the instructions for the consistency for the final mixing. It made me think it would be more like a cookie dough or something. It actually is more like a very thick frosting - or, more appropriately, marshmallow creme!! ;^D    Well worth the effort - I will definitely make these again. Next time, I'll try peppermint.

This made a big gooey mess. However, after reading a bunch of different marshmallow recipes, I think I found my error. Marthacrocker13's review while very helpful, also lead me astray. The most common gelatin packets that I found have about half a tablespoon of gelatin in it. This recipe calls for 4 tablespoons so I fell quite a bit short on gelatin. Most of the recipes I've read call anywhere for 3-4 packets of gelatin for the amount of sugar used in this recipe so if I did 4 tablespoons it may be too much gelatin but I don't really know since I've not tried it.   The next time I do this recipe, I will probably use 3 packets of gelatin and only a cup of water though. But I will try it again, because I am curious as to the difference egg whites make to marshmallow. The recipe that did work for me didn't use them.  This recipe could be greatly improved by the author including a note regarding how many gelatin packets to use, since it is a common way to buy gelatin. If I had gotten it to work, I would have given the recipe a 4 since its for marshmallow's and  not something more complex.

My son, Nathan, helped to make this recipe.  He couldn't wait to see how it was going to puff up.  Be prepared to take extra time to get it up to the right temperature, he did wait patiently.  It also takes quite awhile to whip it to a stiff peak.  That was a fun term to explain to him.  Finally, they were ready to put into the pan.  Now only 8 more hours to wait.  Well, first thing this morning he cut into them.  His expert opinion, "Mom, their awesome, they are better then the real ones!"  Then I tried them, I definitely agree with him.  I loved the vanilla taste and can't wait to try them in hot chocolate.  Mmmm!  We want to try them again with peppermint.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Fantastic! Used simple hand mixer and did not have a thermometer so I dropped a bit off the spoon into cold water and when it hits the bottom use your finger and move the syrup mixture a bit to see if it forms a firm ball. Use big bowl for the egg as you will be combining the syrup and gelatin mixture into it and you will be mixing it so it will need the room.

These didn't last for even an hour! I dusted them in cinnamin and sugar after cooled. I took the other half and dunked them in melted caramel...wow...these are to die for!!

Whenever making candy you have to make sure your sugar is dissolved. Don't boil too long or too short otherwise it just won't work.

OH MY GOODNESS!!! Who ever thought you could make marshmallows from scratch!!! What fun!! Take heed to all the advice for using a LARGE sauce pan as the sugar-mix does expand significantly when you add the gelatin. But don't worry!  If you're prepared for it, it'll be fine. I made these with my 3 daughters and 3 friends. We were all really impressed! What an impressive science experiment. I can't say I'll give up completely on store bought marshmallows, simply because of convenience, but I'll definitely make these again, just for the fun of it. Thanks HBIC!!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it unfortunately didn't turn out- It never solidified (it stayed the consistency of frosting) and it had an odd aftertaste. It's not the best candy, but it would make an nice frosting or filling for a cake.

This was a fun recipe.  I told the kids it was more like a science experiment than baking!  We had a great time making it and were surprised to find that it tasted just like marshmallows you buy in the store.  We rolled ours in powdered sugar as others have suggested.  That kept them from sticking to each other after being cut.  Great for fondue dipping!  I appreciate this recipe since it doesn't have all the chemical perserves that store bought marshmallows have.  We are planning on making these again when all the cousins come to visit for Thanksgiving.

I got adventurous with this recipe and used Jello and Knox for more flavored variety. I used the new Mango flavor. Mmmm... FYI- one small box of Jello is equal to one 1-TBSP package of Knox. I used 3 packages of Jello to 1 package of Knox and the flavor is a bit strong! I would suggest 2 small boxes of Jello to 2 1-Tbsp packages of Knox. Also, the flavor of Jello you choose shouldn't change your marshmallow color at all. As I said, 3 packages of Mango Jello and they're still white! Be sure to really whip the mallow mixture before you try to pipe for peeps. You should see the mixture starting to ball up in your Kitchen Aid - otherwise you'll get flat Easter Eggs. But still tasty!

Pretty straightforward recipe (I always check reviews anyway).  I had so much fun making this...  Yes it's messy, and sticky, but it's marshmallows!  :)  who ever heard of homemade marshmallows...  wish I'd thought of kosher gelatin.  Sometime I'll use this for rice crispy treats.  I made these into s'more cupcakes.

The instructions in this recipe fails. This was my third time making marshmallows and wanted to try something different so I have this recipe a go. I ended up with chunks of sugar/gelatin. The instructions just aren't clear. When I add the gelatin to the heated sugar and I add it immediately to the egg whites? Do I wait for the eruption to die down? Do I stir the sugar/water/syrup mixture while waiting for it to come to temp or do I leave it alone? With some tweaking I think the results could be great but I'm not even going to bother and just try a different recipe.

These are really great, but they don't always set up as firm as I would like, but don't be afraid to try them and play around with the flavor.  We have made all kinds including peppermint, chocolate, vanilla bean, caramel, etc.  What great christmas presents with some homemade hot chocolate.

Just tried this recipe for the first time, for my stepchildren, who are vegetarian, but who are dying to try marshmallows.I used vegan gelatin instead (couldn't find agar agar anywhere; I bought "Natural Desserts' unflavored jel dessert").
I had read all the previous reviews, and i took a reviewer's idea to take the steps backwards -preparing the eggs first, then the gelatin, then the syrup, and when that was done, mix with the gelatin, and finish by adding that to the eggs. Worked like a charm. 
I was disappointed though, at the last step, to NOT see the whole thing "exploding", "expanding", etc... like others have. I had prepared myself for it (used my big KitchenAid bowl for it), and was expected to see it, but it didn't happen. So I wonder if i've done something wrong (I did follow the recipe exactly; the only thing different was the vegan gelatin, so , maybe that changed something? Anyways, at least i didn't have any mess to clean up! :D
Right now the marshmallows are still resting. I did taste some off the spatula that i used for spreading the "paste" into the dish, and it tasted really fine, really like a marshmallow that you let melt in your mouth. I'm still waiting to see them dried though. 
About the drying process, has anyone tried putting them in a warm oven? I was wondering whether that would help or not... 
PS: it's been 8 hours, and there's a crust on top, but underneath, it's still marshmallow mush... :( Is it linked to the vegan gelatin? To the "non-exploding

Yeah, I definitely have to agree with the other reviewers who said that it would have been nice to know that the gelatin/candy mixture EXPLODES when you combine it.  Unfortunately, I read the reviews too late.  I literally just ran to my computer to find out what I did wrong, and voila, the first review told me all I needed to know.  I only hope that what remains in the "small saucepan" is salveagable.  Anybody volunteer to come over and clean my stove?

Yummy! 2 tips that will help any marshmallow recipe: 1. use 1/2 cup of the water called for to dissolve your gelatin. Before heating the sugar mixture, put the gelatin and 1/2cup COLD water together in your mixer and let it dissolve. Must be COLD water, that's the trick. #2 When you begin the final mixing, start on low or medium-low. The mixture will thicken as it cools and you can gradually turn up the speed to ultra-high without flinging it out of the bowl.

Excellent in hot chocolate!  Be prepared for the intensely bad smell of the boiling gelatin.  I will only make this on special occasions because the effort needed is great in comparison to buying a simple bag.

I made these as a Christmas treat, and they are DELICIOUS!  I also found them quite easy to make.  I found that they were set after only a few hours in the fridge.  I cut them into squares and rolled them in toasted coconut - YUM!

Thanks for the great recipe - I will definitely make them again!

While these marshmallows taste good, I found them to be quite sticky and difficulty to handle.  I made them the same evening that I made my own recipe for marshmallow peeps.  The taste was almost identical, but the peeps were softer and easier to handle.  The peeps may take a little longer to set up before they are ready to be cut.  I also like the fact that the peeps recipe takes less gelatin, making them cheaper to make.

Surprisingly easy to make, though a little messy. I think I overbeat mine or just let them sit too long before piping them into "chicks" for easter, so by the time I was half done the fluff was unmanageably stiff and I had to spread it in a pan. However the final result was tasty and the consistency was fine. I'll make them again, now that I know a little better how the recipe goes.

These were the most fun, most awesome, most yummiest thing I've ever made!  Even though I messed up the recipe (I added the gelatin too quickly/too soon, and it overflowed all over the stovetop) it still solidified and I had a delightful time making shapes out of the goo and decorating them.

These are the best!! This recipe is a lifesaver for our family. We cannot have food dye in our diet, and there are no longer commercially available bags of marshmallow without blue dye. I will be trying them out with a rice crispy treat recipe next!

A very thoughtful friend gave me a box of handcut marshmallows from Williams-Sonoma this past December since she know's I'm a marshmallow addict.  I went to reorder them from the W-S website but hesitated when I saw the price.  Of course, I checked out All-Recipes and found Emily's recipe.  Well, I tried it right away and have to say I wouldn't change a thing.  These were easy, taste wonderful (use REAL vanilla!) and very impressive for a minimal amount of work.  Not only do I love them and the oos and aahs I get from my adult friends, but my 7 and 8 year-old both love them and have their friends jealous and asking for them whenever they come over to play.  Way to go Emily....this one's a keeper~

I don't know why some people have experienced so many problems with this recipe.  The only thing I can think of is that marshmallow is a candy and must be made on a dry day. Nor should they be made while anything is producing steam on the stove (makes the kitchen humid).  I used this recipe and the marshmallows were perfect.  People could not believe I had done this myself.  Very, very good

I made 3 double batches of this recipe (mind you, following the tips of using a large pan for cooking the sugar mixture then adding the gelatin mixture in slowly and using my kitchenade mixer to do the mixing..... Big help).  I made regular first (turned out perfect and SO GOOD), caramel 2nd which I only did because I goofed and didn't double the gelatin, used a 1/4 cup less water in the sugar mixture and cooked the sugar mixture on to high of a temp - all by accident.  It had a caramelized flavor going on due to my mistakes and so I added some caramel extract and went with it. Besides the huge mess the sugar/gelatin mixture made when going into the egg whites due to it hardening as I poured it and so it didn't make the marshmallow fluff like combo the first batch did, they still turned out good.  They were much more dense than the light and fluffy 1st batch.  The last batch went fine. I only had 6 tablespoons of gelatin left and so that is what I used in the last doubled batch.  I added mint extract and green food coloring. The also turned out great. All 3 had wonderful flavor. I will be making them again and will try experimenting with other flavors too.  I would stick with the exact measurements recommended in the recipe after all this.  They really did turn out the best.  One other tip.... Lined my pan with wax paper and then put the powder sugar all around it. That made it very easy to pull the marshmallows out and place on a cutting board to slice into squares.  Enjoy!!

I loved this recipe and is the BEST tasting marshmellow I've done!  I like adding flavors to my  recipe is I tried this one with a little raspberry flavoring.  It was so delicious and was the perfect shade of light pink for valentines day.

This is a very good homemade marshmallow. I didn't need/want a lot so I quartered the recipe using one whole egg white. Also I don't like using corn syrup so I omitted it.  Everything turned out fine.  Four stars because, I found it easy to make and the directions adequate but this isn't a knock your socks off recipe so it doesn't get 5 stars.   Next time I will try piping the creme into ropes which I will cut for small mini Marshmallows. and I've always wanted to try peppermint...I've heard it is amazing.

I think I messed them up.  I poured the gelatin liquid into the syrup and didn't see any explosion... Maybe I poured them together too fast because sugar clumps formed on the corners of the pan.  I ended up scooping out the sugar clumps and continuing anyways.  It still tastes good like marshmallows even with this weird mistake.  Was I supposed to pour the syrup into the gelatin instead?? Or maybe just pour the gelatin a lot slower.  I'm going to try some other flavorings next time.

I haven't used this reciepe but the ingredients are nearly identical to one I have used.  The results were fantastic, if the process was a bit messy.  I 1/2 dipped mine in milk and dark chocolates.  They were greeted with rave reviews.  One note: the batter keeps climbing up the beaters. It was a challenge to keep the mix in the bowl while whipping.

I made homemade peeps and they didn't turn out as well as I expected.  The marshmallow was too soft to hold the beak peeks!  They were still cute but the directions provided by allrecipes staff aren't very good and the main picture they show is very different than the step by step directions that show you how to make a very different little chick.

I'd definitely say it tastes like marshmallows... but the consistency just isn't fluffy or light enough in my opinion. These came out very very chewy. Interesting concept.. but I wasn't very "wow"-ed.

Wonderful recipe!  Everyone was so impressed with these homemade marshmallows.   They were just like store bought only better!  Not really that difficult either.  I rolled each marshmallow generously in powdered sugar after I cut them. Clean up was easy with lots of really hot water.

Great recipe!  I had never made marshmallows before, but these weren't hard at all.  One tip:  when you cut them, keep rinsing your knife with hot water.. helps to keep them from sticking to the knife.  Would recommend this one!

This was a simple but time consuming recipe.  Marshmallows are almost impossible to find in Holland so I didn't have a choice but to make them.  It really impressed my American friends and taste just like the real thing.  Next time I will have to work on the presentation though.

I was pleased--I cook and bake a lot, but candy is an area I mess up a lot. So I kind of expected a disaster. But they turned out like I imagine they were supposed to. I guess it's not something I would do very often, as they're not THAT special, but for an occasional novelty item, they're good.

Really hard to make. I had to make it twice for it to work. If you egg whites aren't REALLY white after beating, than keep beating. This is the mistake that I made and in the end, my marshmallows came out liqudey

Cool recipe, but when it was cooling there was some kind of separation between the gelatin and the marshmallow. I'm not sure if it was me or the recipe, but it tasted great anyway!

Love the taste, but there are a few more things people should know before they start cooking:

For step 4 (whipping the egg whites & then all ingredients):
If you have it, use a stand mixer instead of a hand mixer.  It will be somewhat easier to control pouring the syrup into the egg whites.  I never got to a "stiff" peak, but the mixture did get gelatinous anyway.

For step 3, the last sentence (combine gelatin mix & syrup):
Plan to place the container in a place easy to clean up BEFORE combining, because it may bubble over the container & cleaning up strings of sugar/gelatin from all surfaces is horrible!

I was looking for a way to show off my new stand mixer, and this was it!  One of the reasons I love AllRecipes is for the reviews, so thank you to everyone who shared tips like using a larger pan.  I am a novice cook, so I truly appreciate advice like that.  These turned out beautifully.  I made graham crackers to go with them, and everyone at work gets a truly homemade s'more tomorrow.  Thanks for the recipe and the reviews, y'all.

Great recipe, but had to look around for better instructions before I began. I used regular Jello instead of gelatin, it worked amazingly! I omitted the vanilla, but it could have gone in and added some depth to the strawberry jello. I also used a piping bag with no tip to make pretty pink piles of marshmallow on four sugar-dusted, parchment lined cookie sheets. I will be making these again!

I read the reviews and wasn't sure if this will turn out good but I wanted to do something with my kids.  I followed the recipe exactly as it stated and it was not only fun but it turned out great. Much better than store bought.  In addition, my kids were licking the spoons since it tasted so good (before it even set).

GREAT!  They turned out very well!
The hardest part was cutting them up though.  I rolled each one in confectioners' sugar so that they wouldn't stick together, and I used the idea of cleaning the knife with hot water.  Tasty and actually rather easy.

Were very good! Mine took longer to dry out, more like 2 days. But that's because I used honey for the sugar!

Love this recipe but I will use it in the future for really just marshmallows. I did what other said and used peppermint flavor instead of vanilla and added some red food coloring.  Next time I will use vanilla and no food coloring.  I will also put some powered sugar on top. I think it takes one time to make it and then I will be better with the timing next time.  Planning to make it this weekend for my daughter and her friends (hot chocolate with a round cut out piece of this delicious marshmallow).

I tried to make homemade marshmallows before, and it always ended up in a sticky mess! These actually hold together nicely, and taste much better than store-bought ones! They are also great for s'mores!

I have made these marshmallows twice, another recipe one.  the egg whites make a significant difference. marshmallows are very easy to make if you have a candy thermometer and a good stand mixer. I decorated with colored sugars for Independence day. what a hit!
delicious and easy, my kind of recipe!

This was a fun project, but it's not better than store-bought marshmallows.  Actually, I prefer store-bought.  I followed the instructions given by reviewers, which were clearer than the original recipe's instructions.  I separated out part of the marshmallow and added peppermint extract instead of vanilla, but I didn't really care for that, either.  The marshmallow mixture was sticky and hard to get into nice marshmallow shapes.  However, I could imagine doing this again if I were making a recipe that called for melted marshmallows, like rice crispy treats, and I felt like making it more of a cooking event than the quick melt-and-stir rice crispy treat process.

Very easy to make. I was expecting something very complicated after reading all the other reviews, but thankfully it was pretty straightforward. 

I used dark corn syrup instead because that's what I had at home. 

I didn't have a thermometer, so just used the cold water method to test. Admittedly, it was tricky. I never got a solid ball but a rather jelly like strands and bubbles. 

I misread the last step, and got a more liquidy mixture rather than the foamy one in the video, so I just beat it for another 15 minutes or so until it got very thick. 

I left it out at room temperature -9 degrees here right now!- to set, and after 2 hours it looked ready. Just to be safe, I let it stay overnight.

Simple tip: use mini muffin pan or ice cube trays dusted with powdered sugar to mold Marshmallows, when firm they plop right out with no cutting needed.

I ended up using this before my marshmallows were set, because I only needed it for a review I had been making. it made quite a bit more creme than I expected, but I won't complain lol this was so simple and fantastic taste! will definitely be using it again!
