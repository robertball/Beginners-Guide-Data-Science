How could anyone take this recipe, make it and then rave about how good it tastes. I do not know what part of the counrty Angela or anyone who gave this a good review are located but in Maryland putting the words crab and imitation in the same sentence is taboo. Although her recipe has the makings for a good dip I strongly recommend using REAL fresh crab meat ( from the Maryland Chesapeake Bay if you can ) and see the difference. Would anyone eat an imitation Filet Mignon?

double or more the crab used in the orginal recipe. The orginal amount was scant and did not give the dip enough  flavor or texture. More than doubling the meat will allow the spread to hold together and spread better. 
I added quite a bit my tabasco and a dash of red pepper to give it a zing.  The basic recipe is great, only ajustments to the amount of meat were necessary.

Made this exactly as in recipe, but I used one can of Starkist Crabmeat along with the 1/2 lb of imitation crabmeat. I am serving this dip at a Super Bowl Party, and will put mini pumpernickle bread slices and tortilla chips for dipping.  I think the shredded cheddar cheese should be cut in half, because I taste more cheese than crabmeat, and I did add extra hot sauce.  Overall, a delicious, easy dip, that I think is fantasticly easy to whip up.  I am certain all the people at the party will be enjoying this one.

This dip is awesome! Prepare it the day before because the flavor is much better when it chills overnight. I added a Tblsp. of sugar to sweeten the lemon juice a little, and I added more hot sauce to zip up the flavor. Very tasty!

There just wasn't enough crab in this dip, so we doubled the amount, and served with tortilla chips. Added extra Tabasco sauce as well, for without these additions it would be rather bland. Great reviews though with the additions, I will definitely be keeping this one!

I had a ton of crab so I doubled the recipe for a pool party.  I was concerned about the large amount of dip but the entire bowl was gone by the end of the party!  Everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.  This one has a permanent home in the recipe box!

I was told this was the most delicious crab dip ever.  It was very quick and easy, and very tasty.  I substituted two 6-oz. cans of crab meat for the imitation.  Will definitely keep as a standard party dip.

I made this recipe, minus the hot pepper sauce because my husband doesn't like hot stuff.    Went over really well, had a friend request I bring it over to their house again.    Will make this dip again and again.

I made this recipe for our Thanksgiving appetizer table.  It was great.  I did add (1) extra cream cheese, because I increase the crab meat, using 1 lb (we love crab meat).  I used fresh picked claw meat and it was well worth the extra $$.  I did omit the cheddar cheese, because I didn't want to take away from the taste of the crab meat.  I also seasoned with Old Bay seasoning.  My family loved it.  I also think it would be good using canned crab or shrimp, if you were in a pinch and fresh was not available.  Also, I use fat free cream cheese and fat free sour cream and it didn't make a difference in the taste.

This was a great recipe and I do not even like crab dip. I made this for a party but never send out anything I do not taste...so...everyone raved about it and asked for a recipe. One change I made was to grate some radish into the dip and also I served this on belgian endive boats which was a huge hit and gave it a bit more oniony flavor which people enjoyed.

Loved it, had it for our Valentine's party and everyone loved it and they were right, people asked for the recipe!  I did add more hot sauce and also added 1 tsp of garlic powder and 2 tsps of sugar.  YUMMO!

I made this dip for an office pot luck.  I had to give it to about 10 people!  My husband loves it and asks me to make it whenever guests come over.

This time it ended up a tad runny. I'm not sure what happened. I've never had problems with dips before including this one. I assume I mismeasured something somehow. The three times I've made it before it was a perfect consistency. The flavor is just great and everyone always loves it. Thankfully I only made it for us at home this time and didn't embarass myself in front of others! This is an often requested dip for tailgates and parties. Thanks so much for a great dip recipe! :)

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone liked it. I, however, was a little disappointed. Probably because as is, the recipe is pretty bland. I had to add quite a bit of seasoning to make this taste yummy. Also, 5 drops of hot sauce didn't do anything to this dip. It wasn't zippy at all. This is what I did to make it a little better: less lemon juice, a small amount of salt, a small amount of dried basil, some pepper and garlic powder, and more hot sauce. It still wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but it saved the dip (and all the money I spent on the crab!) and people ate most of it. Overall, a good base but definitely needs some additions!

Thanks so much for this recipe!  I made it for my son's 2nd birthday party ("Under the Sea" theme), and it was a HUGE hit. I received several recipe requests, and everyone raved.  I added a little more crab, and I also added some salad shrip.  To equal this out, I also had to add some more sour cream.  But regardless, it was gone by the end of the day.

I have made this crab dip several times and it is excellent.  Everyone asks for the recipe.  The last time I made it I added too much crab and it was a little dry, next time I will use the amount called for.

I made this for a party recently, and forgot to add the sour cream...it was still awesome!  It was the first thing gone from the table.  I do usually add more hot sauce, and red pepper flakes to spice it up.  I love this dip!

Great start, but many different tastes lead to much customization.  For our group, I dropped the onions, halved the sour cream (to thicken), added 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt, and dolloped in heavily (15-20 drops) with the hot pepper sauce.  And we love it!

I had to add a lot to this to make it work - four cloves garlic, salt and pepper and another can of crab, plus double the hot sauce. Then it worked!

I used real crab meat thinking this would be better with the real thing.  I struggled to give this dish some flavor.  I put it in the frig hoping the flavor will come to life if it sits. If not, I won't make this again.

This was super good!  I left out the onions and celery and used reduced fat cream cheese, reduced fat shredded cheese, and fat free sour cream.  I added almost a pound of crab and at least 10 drops or more of hot sauce (I just kept adding more until I thought it seemed right).  It was excellent with Triscuits.

We bought some krab that my husband didn't care to eat plain (as he usually does), so he asked me to make him a dip. This was good! I halved the ingredients except for the krab, which I kept around the half-pound, and I used yellow onion as it's what I had. I added some salt and pepper, and used both cheddar and  pepper-jack cheeses for an extra kick. He seems to enjoy it! I added more hot sauce (maybe 8 or 10 drops), and he said you notice it more after you've eaten the dip. Thanks for the recipe!

I used a 6-ounce can of crab meat and a small quantity of  salad-sized shrimp.  The results were disappointing and bland even after I doubled or tripled the amount of hot pepper sauce called for.

Felt the receipe was to lemony - added a lot more hot sauce to make it a spicy shrimp dip - everyone at the party loved it.  Also, used fresh shrimp in place of imitation crab.   Will make it again.

I had some imitation crab I wanted to make a dip with and came across this recipe. I also wanted a cold dip with simple ingredients.  This recipe did not disappoint, although I didn't have the same ingredients and didn't want to run to the store. So the substitutions I had on hand were, for the cheese, I had dill havarti , Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, white onion instead of green, and I also used salt, pepper, valentina hot sauce and worchestershire. I'm sure this recipe would be just as good with a sharp cheddar. I plan on using this recipe again for a quick easy dip. we ate it with tortilla chips and crackers . thanks for posting!

This recipe is ok. it's a great starter. I made it buy the original recipe of the first time and decided I was going to change it up to get it more zest and flavor.
 I doubled the crab with real crab. I added:
1tsp Worcestershire sauce
1.5tbsp prepared horseradish
1/4tsp pepper
these added huge flavor with a pleasant zip

I made this for a New Year's Eve party and used 2 cans of white crab meat (I just couldn't see using imitation crab in a crab dip). Then I split the recipe in half, making half with the hot sauce, and to the other I added a little seafood seasoning. Both were very bland. I added more hot sauce (Louisiana style) and more than 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and that brought it to just enough flavor to be served. I paired it with celery and cocktail rye bread. I can't really recommend this recipe as written. Next time I will try a hot crab dip, as I think heat may bring out the crab flavor.

We have made this crab dip for every party we've had over the past year, and it's ALWAYS a hit! We usually double the hot sauce and add a little lemon for extra taste.

Sorry... this was very bland.  I tried adding more hot sauce... more cheese... more onion.  Next time I will cut the lemon juice and maybe try horseradish.  Disappointing.

I use this as a recipe base often.  It reminds me of a friends recipe I always loved.  Added  old bay (lots) and white wine!!  Taste, and if it doesnt' taste good enough, add more wine!!  
Use imitation crab meat and the rest of the recipe as listed.  Tastes great if made a day in advance.

This is your ol grannies book club recipe, way too much lemon, sour cream, cream cheese. wheres the crab ?   Ditch the onions and celery. add twice as much real crab meat, add a few tablespoons of spice, etc.

Delicious! I used reduced fat cream cheese and lite sour cream and it was still very thick and creamy. Served with ritz type crackers, but they crumbled. Probably better with stronger cracker or veggies.

Blah & bland! This is the most boring, bland & unnappealing crab recipe I've ever tasted. In fact, I'm surprised by all the good reviews. There's practically no seasonings, it doesn't call for enough crab, & it just tastes like sour cream. I tried adding more crab, hot sauce, worcestershire, garlic, salt, pepper, etc. to no avail - still bland. I'll keep looking for something better.

This turned out pretty bland.  Tasted like sour cream.  I added chili sauce to give it some taste and it was better.  I probably won't make this again.
