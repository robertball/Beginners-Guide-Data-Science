This is so yummy! I made a few changes though...I didn't have cream sherry, so I omitted it, and I added some roughly chopped walnuts in the layers on top of the toasted coconut...it was so good, I have made it a couple of times...it is easy, quick, looks (and tastes) good.

Super simple recipe to make. I buy fresh berries when they are in season and this is my go to recipe for them. I hardly ever remember to add the sherry though. Chill the mixing bowl before whipping the cream and it will go much faster!

I scaled this down to 4 servings and made them into "mini" trifles. They turned out so cute, and they are delicious! I have never heard of cream sherry before, so I used a bit of regular sherry. I also had a small bit of strawberry sauce left in my fridge that I just tossed in with the berries to use it up. Nice summer dessert!
