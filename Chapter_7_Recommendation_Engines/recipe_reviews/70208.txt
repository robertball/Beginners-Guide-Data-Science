I tried this per the recipe first and it was ok.  I prefer a less "sweet" flavor.  I made the following changes for the second batch to suit our personal tastes.  The changes I made were - 1 1/2 cups frozen fresh peas - put into the pot with the macaroni, just before I drained it.  Then ran everything under cold water in a strainer to cool it quickly.  I sliced several green onions and added diced dill pickle.  I used only 2/3 cup mayo thinned with a little dill pickle juice and mixed in a teaspoon of minced garlic from a jar - this made the "dressing" creamier.  In addition to the sprinkle of paprika, I added a sprinkle of dried dill and cracked black pepper.  I refrigerated it for 4 hours and the flavor was wonderful.  Next time I will add some shredded or diced cheddar cheese to it as well.  Thank you for the basics Peach822, it's a great stepping off point.

This is one of the best tuna salad recipes I have ever tried. We have a farm and I feed everyone a large lunch everyday.  When teenage boys gobble it up you know you have a real winner....

My husband hates macaroni salad. My family loves the one I make and they ask me to make it at every family function. I decided that I would try something new to make for my husband so he might finally decide he likes mac salad.

It took every ounce of energy for me to not take a big bowl for myself and eat it right there and then.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. I realized I only had a little bit of relish left, so I decided to dice up a pickle. I filled each TBLS with the finely diced pickle and then filled the rest of the spoon with the pickle juice. I did this twice, the recipe called for 2 TBLS of relish.

I decided to add 2 diced eggs to the salad and I boiled 4 more and made deviled eggs as a garnish.


I had to add a litte more mayo and I think the reason is because I had a 16oz box of macaroni. I guessed at the 12oz measurement, but I may have been over a little bit.

This recipe is perfect. I can't wait for my hubby to try it tomorrow. I think this might be one that he finally likes :)

I will post again tomorrow and give his opinion. I think it is absolutely delicious.


*edited to add... My husband LOVED IT!  I finally asked him what he thought. "I like it. It's pretty good." That's a 5 star rating coming from him.

I promised to make this mac salad from now on.

He hates Macaroni salad so if he liked it, well you decide from there. BTW everyone else raved about it. It was really good. This is gonna be my signature mac salad from now on.

We enjoy this salad and use it for work lunches during the week.  we have found that we prefer it without the egg, but with a chopped green apple mixed in.

This recipe is okay, but needs some additions to make it great. I doubled up on the onion, celery and tuna. I also added corn instead of peas since I didn't have any. We couldn't taste the relish, so I added some cubed pickles and it was great!

Wonderful. I left out the pickle relish, and doubled up on the tuna, and celery.
I always use frozen peas, since since they are thawed by serving time. I also added sugar, and lawry's seasoning salt,
to my liking. Served on a bed of lettuce
and this can be served as a main entre.

Very simple and yummy recipe.  I used 2 cups of macaroni (instead of 4 cups as the recipe calls for), 8 oz of tuna (so I eat more protein, less carbs), 1/2 cup of mayo (instead of 1 cup), left out the celery and eggs (didn't have any), and chopped up bread & butter pickles as I didn't have any relish.  Seems to be filling, low calorie, and low budget, and low on time needed.

Amelia's Tuna Macaroni Salad Haiku: "I liked this okay. But my guests didn't eat it. I didn't change much." I thought this was a pretty tasty tuna macs, but I definitely used frozen peas in place of canned, skipped the egg, and garnished w/ curry over paprika. (I love curry on tuna mac!) Not sure why my BBQ guests didn't go for it, but I've enjoyed the leftovers (w/ additional scoops of mayo, b/c it dries out easily.)

I made this macaroni salad and it was delicious! However, I don't like too much mayo, so I cut it down to 3/4 cup and it was perfect! I also substituted dill pickle relish and added some lemon juice.  The paprika was a nice touch! Thanks!

This is the recipe I grew up with from as far back as I can remember. We use 2-3 cans of tuna these days, and always serve it with buttered warm Jiffy Mix cornbread and sliced tomatoes. A regular during hot Florida summers.

I made this recipe for a small cook out we were having with friends. I really love this recipe. The only thing I would change is I would use frozen peas, thawed, in place of the canned peas. Canned peas tend to be a little on the mushy side. But it was a really good, easy, simple and economical salad. Everyone liked it. Very easy to add to if you want more veggies. Next time I'm going to try adding some sweet red bell pepper to it. YUM!

I have been making this salad for years but i add a few extras. I use everything listed in the salad and I add 1 bell pepper and chop up sharp cheddar cheese from the block(very small pieces) or just use the  shredded(much easier). Making from your recipe is much easier and tastes great.

This was really good pasta salad!  I added about a tablespoon of dill, and I used medium shells instead of elbows.  I also added a dash of lemon juice. I brought it to a party and got tons of compliments!  Try it..you'll love it!

A good starting point, seems to need something. I think as someone else suggested, dill weed would be a nice addition. Basically a good recipe, but a little on the bland side.

I LOVE this salad. I make it now regularly for take to work for my lunch.  My hubby is not a macaroni salad fan at all so this works out wonderfully. I didn't think anyone could make better tuna macaroni salad then my mother did but this comes really really close. I've made it twice with different variations each time, never have used the peas simply because I don't have them in the house yet.  I use about 4 green onions instead of sweet only out of personal preference and do not use eggs.  The salad doesn't suffer for the lack of eggs.  This last time I made it I used 2 cans of tuna and added a tablespoon of dijon.  Not sure if I like the dijon all that much but the point is, this recipe is either as is or as a starting off point to add or not add according to your personal preference.

The receipe is great for those nights you don't have time for a whole lot of cooking. However, I use 2 cans of tuna,elbow macaroni, finely diced onions & Green pepper,mayo and Hellmans sandwich spread. Serve with crackers or children will love with Fried chicken.

This recipe is a sure hit at BBQs, parties, and other warm weather social events. I am not a cook. I found this recipe to the easiest and tastiest macaroni/tuna salad that I have ever tried. My husband certainly enjoyed it.

I enjoyed this salad, but found that if you add some western dressing (no specific amount just as much as you like) it gives it a little something "extra".

I've made this two or three times and we really enjoy it. I always use frozen peas (I run them under hot water for a minute first). I also put in about 1/4 tsp. dried dill weed. It really adds a nice flavor.

I do not usually give bad reviews, but after letting this sit in the refrigerator over night to let the flavors settle and mix together, this salad was DRY! I took it to my parents house for Father's Day, and I left it there for my very unpicky father to finish off, otherwise I was going to throw it out. If I made this again I would add more mayo the next day just before serving.

Wonderful recipe as is! Just like Mama's. I used frozen peas and cooked them with the pasta... I made too much!! So after the 3rd day I added cream of mushroom soup to the bowl  another can of drained tuna and some grated cheddar cheese. Mixed it up and topped with breadcrumbs. baked 30 mins it was awesome...kinds a two for 1 thanks so much for sharing!

Great homemade recipe! I used finely chopped kosher dill because I'm not a fan of relish but that's just a preference so I'm still giving it 5 stars. Didn't change anything else.

This was good, but nothing too special. Followed the recipe exactly, but used frozen peas instead. We added an extra can of tuna, because the ratio seemed off.

Ok so I don't eat salads like this because of allergies, but like to make them for hubby etc. I didn't have onion or the peas, so I followed directions except those 2 items, I did add some chopped Roma tomato that my husband loves, took it to a BBQ last night with 5 other adults came home with an empty bowl!! Oh and I did add 2 TBSP of mustard for my hubby as well!

We loved this salad. I have been making a tuna/macaroni salad for awhile now and it was good. I found this and decided to try it. My family enjoyed it. I left out the peas only because no one but me likes them, I also didn't have celery so I used celery seed and I left out the eggs. I plan on making this again and except for the peas I will make it like its suppose to be made. Thanks for a great recipe!

very good basic recipe.  I used 3 cans of tuna for all that macaroni, though.  used canned sweet baby peas, but only about half an 8oz can.  this could be my go-to tunamac recipe...we'll see.

This is delicious I like Hellmann’s mayonnaise and peas in  mine and my husband likes miracle whip and sweet pickle relish so I’ve mixed half miracle whip and half Helmanns and it’s the best macaroni salad I ever made !! don’t forget to use the chopped eggs when you’re mixing the mayonnaise and tuna with the celery and onions also ??makes for a very creamy ‘sauce’ so to speak.

Doubled this recipe yesterday. I have just one bowlfull left. It's good. But I think I'll add bits of cheese and a bit more mayo next time. Not quite what I used to make.

I made this recipe using a 12 oz box tri-colored rotini noodles and 2 cans tuna fish.  I don't care for straight mayo so I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 light Miracle whip thinned with some sweet pickle juice and added extra pickle relish.  It was still a little too dry so I added additional mayo/Miracle Whip to my liking.  This recipe made alot which I shared with my neighbor.  She called me the next day and asked for the recipe!!
Great for lunches and quick summer suppers!!  I think I'll keep this recipe and make it again.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. My mother used to make a similar salad. I used frozen baby peas. I cooked them briefly with the macaroni for the last two minutes. My family enjoyed this salad with barbequed chicken. Yum!

This is a very easy salad to make to bring to a picnic, or just at home for your own family. I omitted the peas, but everything else was the same. i think the pickle relish is the trick that makes it different from other salads. This salad is a favorite in my house all year long!

I used green olives instead of peas, as my mom did. The olives gives it a little more of a salty, but not too salty taste and adds more color with the pimentos. Greet memories, great taste.

No changes to this recipe, other than I just add ingredients, never measure anything out but I used 1 12oz and 1 5oz can of tuna and instead of canned peas I used frozen like some of the others here!

This is SO good! I made some changes based off what I had handy. I omitted onions,celery and sweet relish and instead added dill pickles, dill weed, garlic powder and lots of pepper! I was told this is the new side I’m assigned to make at all family functions!

I previously stated that this was easy to make and yummy, but I made a few changes to the recipe.  I used frozen peas (don't like canned food), added more onion, and did not use relish.  I chopped the eggs up into pieces and used more paprika than they recommended.

I substituted frozen peas instead of canned peas. I made it twice, once with shrimp and one with canned tuna. It was delish.

This is a dish served all the time in our family,  family reunions, picnics, cookouts, goes great as a side for sloppy joes and potato chips.  I never tried it with the pickle relish(will try that next time),  I make mine with miracle whip and canned peas, my sister with Hellmans and frozen peas, my Mom she likes to add diced apples to hers sometimes for the extra crunch.  A trick my Mom taught me is to put the boiled eggs in a bowl and mix them with the mayo.  and always add the canned peas last otherwise they can get mushy.

Delicious recipe, perfect as is - no changes needed.  Tweak all you want, but a bit of chopped red sweet pepper is all I've ever added.  I don't bother with the boiled and quartered eggs (strictly optional) and I will admit to sprinkling Old Bay Seasoning on it instead of paprika ;-)

I've been making tuna salad for years. It's a summer staple. However, instead of mayo, we use low fat miracle whip and we don't add the pickle relish. One of my favorite dishes!

Yeah, this tastes like Grandma's. If I were making it for just me, I'd leave out the peas and substitute an equal quantity of chopped green pepper, and I might add a half teaspoon of celery seed and a full tablespoon of dill pickle relish, but it's nice.

I use miracle whip in place of mayo to give an extra kick. Also, I live in Maryland so I never make this without Old Bay seasoning.  I don't like peas so they never make their way into my salad.

I make something very similar and quite honestly I preferred it. I don't use eggs, relish or peas. I add green or red pepper, scallions, parsley, dill (light on the dill) and mayo to taste. I also use twice the amount of tuna. Sometimes cherry tomatoes cut in half and deseeded. Not the salad dressing variety but real mayo. I have made this for parties, office functions, my family, etc. and it is very well received.

This salad was a great dish. Tasted better the day after. I used 1/2 the mayo and also only about 1/2 the pasta, and two cans of tuna. I like my salad with lots of goodies and not just all noodles.
Will be making this again!

Great adaptable easy recipe. If your taste is different you can change it up. I made it with shells and frozen peas (cooked)which is what I had on hand. Pleased a small group, would make it again as is.

This is a great starter recipe!  Like others, I added 1 more can of tuna, a whole medium red onion, about a tsp. of dill pickle juice and it was a hit!  Thanks!

There's just something about Tuna and Macaroni Salad once the weather turns nice. I love it. I actually prefer this salad at room temp as soon as it's mixed. No chilling for this girl.  I generally skip the peas.

My family and I aren't big fans of peas, so I put corn instead and didn't add relish and it came out very good. I also added two flavoured cans of tuna in separate bowls (Spicy Thai Chili and Lemon & Pepper to be exact) and it made the dishes pop nicely

I was in such a hurry, I put more than the required amount of onion, I used a vidalia onion and only one egg. I'm not a fan of egg in a macaroni salad, so I cut it into fine pieces. I tasted it before putting it in my fridge for overnight to chill and it was very tasty!! As all macaroni salads that I have made, it will need more mayo in the morning after most of it has absorbed into the noodles. Would make again, but would make other changes to it.

My whole family loves it when I make this. As with everything, I tailor it to our tastes. I don't add onions or I use green onions. I use frozen peas and cook them with the pasta. I like to chop up some sweet pickles instead of / or with the relish. I add some cubed cheese. I sometimes add the paprika and sometimes the egg. It depends on our mood. Even when we don't have the time to chill it, it still tastes  good.

This recipe is delicious. Have made it several times over and everyone loves it. I use frozen peas and chill them instead of the canned peas...that's the only change. Wonderful!

This recipe is a bit bland so I made changes and it turned out great! I didn't but if you want a healthier version use non-fat greek yogurt, it is a great substitute for some of the mayo or miracle whip. I also used frozen peas, as it gives a more fresh clean taste. I also added yellow mustard, mustard powder, and onion powder. I eliminated the relish and just used scallions.

Now this is a classic macaroni salad. I had never tried relish in mine before, but a good idea for a change. I  added cucumbers, and extra onions for the onion lover in me.

This was very close to the recipe I remember as a kid.  I don't know what else my mother put into the salad, but this had all the right basics.  My family ate it up and smiled.  Thanks!

This was a great basic recipe. It seemed a little bland when I first tasted it, so I added dill weed (about 1 tsp), extra pepper, 3 Tbls dijon mustard, about 2 tsp lemon juice and I chopped up the egg whites and stirred them into the salad.
With these adjustments, the salad was really good and got rave reviews at the holiday picnic!
