Hi Di:) Wow! Believe me it's not often I get something I made called "bland " lol. That's OK; I'll admit this rice recipe doesn't have a great deal of "kick" on its own; it's not supposed to. Then again a lot of the meats I serve tend to have a lot of herbal-spicy goodliness going on in them and in order to not overpower my guests I serve this as a counterpoint. Absolutely there are times I also add a bit of dried red pepper flakes or even lots of roasted garlic to this recipe -- but it's flexible that way. Thanks for your review:)

This rice was not great. It was definitly lacking in flavour and needed something to give it a kick. I will try it again but will add some spices like garlic flaked peppers or chili flakes to give it a kick. Otherwise it is pretty boring and bland.

Delicious!! I made it as a side dish to a venison roast. I made a few changes. I used a garlic oil I had on hand and added some frozen chopped spinach to it while cooking. I also used brown rice which required some extra water while cooking and took about twice as long to cook. My 3 yr old and 5 yr old really enjoyed it especially the 3 yr old who came back for a heaping seconds! Thanks! I will be keeping this one!

Exactly what I was looking for - something with a little more pizazz than just plain rice but not something too bold when I already had a rather spicy meat I wanted this to accompany. This had the interest and character I was looking for the perfect foil for the star of the show which was "Cajun Barbecued Chicken " also from this site. Aside from preparing this with the more standard ratio of 2:1 broth to rice I prepared this as written and couldn't have been more pleased.

Although I like spicy my husband and son are more bland types so this recipe was perfect! It's a great way to use up extra tomatoes and you can always spice it up if you like!

Great with my spicy chicken enchiladas I paired this with a spinach/tomato salad topped with guacamole sauce. Easy and great tasting. A family favorite. Thanks Magpie

Loved this! Made it with tomatoes from a local farm served with tenderloin. I think this may be really good as a the rice for a stuffed pepper?? May try that next time. Thumbs up from my picky vegetarian daughter!

I made this with the basil and garlic chicken recipe for my parents. It was delicious they loved it! At first I thought there were way too many tomatoes but it turned out perfect. Easy quick and delicious dinner!

Perfecto! This is very similar to a rice dish that I make regularly. It's delicious! I find that it lends itself to easy and quick variations and is a fabulous side. So easy to adapt to various tastes! I use half brown and half white rice I do add a bit more chicken broth then and cook a tad longer - Exellent recipe Easy on time easy to put together and easy on the budget!

Read the other reviews and added a little more flavor w/garlic cumin and jalapenos and used vegtable broth. A note to Newbie- I hope you know that chicken broth isn't vegetarian! You said your picky veg daughter liked it!

My husband loved this rice dish. It was super easy to make. I used a couple of leaves of fresh basil instead of dried. It worked out great.

Needs salt. Maybe only a teaspoon but definitely needs salt.
