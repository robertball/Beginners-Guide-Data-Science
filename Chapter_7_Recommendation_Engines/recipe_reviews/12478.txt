Just the recipe I was looking for. My changes: Used a graham craker crust, and "whipped"  a regular 8 Oz. block of cream cheese. Added, an oatmeal cookie crumb topping because I had a few stale cookies around. Delcious and I like the fact that it uses gelatin instead of pudding or condensed milk, the cream cheese (which I didn't use low fat)was enough dairy calories in this pie. My jello was tropical pineapple , so it had kind of a tropical summery tang.

I make this everytime there is a potluck at work and the only thing I change is switch out the pineapple geletin for orange and it tastes great!  Yes, there is a lot of filling left over but I put it into dessert cups and enjoy it at home because there is never any pie left over.

I am a college student and decided to make this pie as my contribution to my
family's Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone loved it and said it was a great alternative
to the usual holiday desserts. It was so cheap and easy to make. I used a no 
bake graham cracker crust and it was wonderful. I will definately be making this
again, perhaps with different types of fruit to experiment. Thanks for the great
recipe!!

This recipe is wonderful.  If you use the smaller pie shells and make 2 receipe's, you can make 3 pies.  This is great for taking to Church socials.  Everyone who has tried it has enjoyed it.  You can make it less sweet by using only 8 oz of no sugar cool whip instead of 12 oz.  It tastes just as good.

Made this last night  and is the easiest pie I ever made. I gave it 4 stars only because the crushed pineapple in it made the consistency with little lumps all in it. Next time I will try and use the cut pineapple that is not such small pieces. Also I couldn't find pineapple jello so I used strawberry. Was delicious.

Everyone seemed to really rate this recipe high, but, we just weren't a big fan of it.  The filling of the pie tasted very artificial to us.  The artificial flavor was definitely coming from the pineapple jello.   It may just be my family's personal taste.  I think if I made this with orange jello and some mandarin oranges or even switched out with strawberry jello we would have liked it better.  Something about the pineapple jello flavor profile just skewed the taste for us.

I made this for a dinner party, and the hostess asked for the recipe!  It was a hit!  Very fluffy and perfect for summer.  Not overpoweringly sweet, but decievingly rich, so cut small slices.  I made my own graham cracker crust, and the filling was the perfect amount for the 9-inch pie plate I used.  A great summer recipe, and it requires so few ingredients!  Thanks for sharing!

Made this exactly as written.  There was enough filling for two deep dish pie crusts, and everyone raved about it!  It would be delicious in graham cracker crusts too.  Very quick and easy.

I had been craving a pineapple cream pie for weeks. Then I came across this recipe! I modified it with a graham cracker crust and only used a 3oz island pineapple jello, but it was exactly what I wanted, which was a cheesecake-like texture and taste without the baking. Not too sweet and not to sour. This is a great pot luck dessert that can be altered for berries instead of pineapple. I loved it!

The one change I made was since I am not fond of either regular pie crust or graham cracker crusts I used a premade chocolate cookie crust instead. The filling made 2 pies since those crusts are smaller. I think next time I will try using the shortbread crust instead. But overall very tasty, and simple.

The first time I made this I could not find pineapple gelatin so I used canned mandarin oranges & orange jello.  It was too much for 1 pie so just used the rest as a dip for vanilla wafers or graham sticks.  It was a hit!

The first time I made this, I had to use strawberry jello because I didn't have pineapple. For the whipped topping, I found this stuff called coco whip, which is made with coconut oil and sugar instead of hydrogenated fat and high fructose corn syrup. It added a lovely coconut note with the pineapple! Both times came out absolutely delicious! I love how easy this is! I also used a block of cream cheese instead of the whipped cream cheese, but I imagine it would have been even easier that way. One thing to keep in mind is that a single recipe filled two 9" premade pie crusts for me, plus two small jello molds, probably 1/3 cup each. The second time I made this, I did a double recipe, used pineapple jello, and it filled the two pie crusts, plus 10 little jello molds to the brim. Definitely not a drawback though! :-)

I made this for the second time and realize I used 8 oz cream cheese and 8 oz whipped topping the first time I made it.  It was so good, I'll just keep making it the same way in the future.  

Like others, I used a store-bought graham cracker crust to save time.  Since the recipe makes so much filling, I used the larger crust that says "2 extra slices" and it fit perfectly.

I could not find pineapple jello so I used Orange flavor. Pie is delicious.

I used a store bought a graham cracker crust. Recipe is enough filling for 2 pies.

Easy, fast and delicious! This recipe makes two deep dish pies, so it was perfect. It was a big hit with my family. I followed the recipe and didn't make any changes.

This was good!  I used pineapple cream cheese since it was on sale.  I also used a graham cracker crust and berry blue jello.  The kids loved it!  And I did have some extra that I put in sundae dishes and we ate with a spoon.
