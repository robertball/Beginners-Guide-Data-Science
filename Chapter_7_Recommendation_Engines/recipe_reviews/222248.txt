These were amazing!  Even my little boys ate it and asked for more.  I omitted mushrooms and peppers so the kids wouldn't complain of CHUNKS and ran the barley through a food processor briefly and pulsed the black beans a few times to give a smoother patty.  Though I only had one egg, they held together on oiled foil on the grill with the use of some cooking spray.  I threw in some liquid smoke and Worcestershire sauce and used a smoked cheddar cheese to bump up the grill flavor.  Delicious!

I thought this was an awesome recipe! I added jalapenos to spice things up a little bit and enjoyed mine with some local BBQ sauce. I read others were having problems with the burgers falling apart so I baked the burgers at 350 until cooked through and than threw them into the fridge until I wanted to heat them up again on the grill!

I have tried this recipe and really liked it.  I did do a few things different. I made them into meatballs.  I baked them in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, I did spray them with olive oil so the brown a little. I plan on making them for lunch for the Center were I cook at.  I will let you know how it went over.

To get burgers to stick together, perhaps don't rinse the black beans and lightly coat patties with flour. Provecho!

we couldn't make this as a burger. had to do it as a sort of a meatloaf, only without the meat. by the time it was done it was stuffing, directions on the barley need to be more clear because we did the measurements exactly and ended up with a bunch of leftover barley that is now being frozen for other uses, which are yet to be determined.

This was really good, however the prep time took a lot longer than 15 minutes. I took the advice of another review and did not rinse the beans. I also drained any excess liquid from the barley. I cooked the patties for about 15 minutes on each side at 400 degrees which helped dry them out and keep their shape. I used cilantro instead of the parsley and added crushed red pepper for a kick. All in all pretty tasty when topped with cheese and Dijon mustard.

Very good flavor for a veggie-burger (which I usually avoid like the plague).
I followed the recipe as posted and had some problems with the patties falling apart.
Even after I oiled the foil, the patties stuck and fell apart when flipping them.
Maybe Pam spray or a cooler grill would have helped...
Anyway, they made for some excellent hash.

These are tasty. I fed it to mushroom haters and they had no clue! Meat lovers said it was as good if not better than a burger. It's very important to let them set up before flipping on the grill. I pulse stuff in food processor because I have picky eaters.

I think I will make it again, but I would add more seasoning, perhaps season salt to up the flavor.

Good burgers!  I did make some changes:  omitted the mushrooms and used instead 1 full red pepper, 1/2 a jalapeno & 1 tbsp taco seasoning.  I first pan fried the burgers in the skillet which did not work well (the burgers were falling apart).  Then I tried baking the rest of them in the oven at 400 degrees for 15 mins.  I tried to turn them over, but they were sticking to the foil and so I left them.  I would definitely recommend baking instead of pan frying!  I waited until the burgers cooled from the oven, and they released from the tin foil, were solid and kept their shape.  Success!  Today I'll see how they reheat and may try freezing them to reheat for later use.  I will be making these again and with the addition of spices they were very flavorful!  

Hint:  make the burgers smaller than you would normally, because they are very hearty and filling.  I made 5 patties out of the mixture, and they were too much for sandwiches (I almost couldn't finish them).  Next time I'll make 6-7 patties.

This was very good, but as I find with all the veggie burgers I've tried, it's a bit bland. I like the idea of adding jalape√±os to spice it up. Overall, though, this is a great recipe especially for the texture, which all my kids loved. Thank you! I will be making this again.
