This was not good. I have been cooking indian food for 20 yrs and this was way off. There was no sauce, and it needed more spice. And where is the salt? I had to save it. I quickly sauteed ginger and garlic in oil and stirred the mixture into it, add a finely chopped tomato. I added a 3/4 tsp of salt, more garam masala, 1/2 cup water, cooked for 10 minutes. Then added 1/2 cup of half and half and cooked for another few minutes on low. It was superb this way.

WOW was this good - just a terrific recipe.  Beware though that separating curds from the liquid is not easy and if you haven't done it before you should allow a little more time for that part.

I used another paneer recipe, but used this curry recipe. While the flavor of the curry was good, the consistency of the curry was off. It turned out like seasoned mixed vegetables, instead of a saucy stewy curry.
Will probably be looking for other curry recipes or try to improve upon this one.

I loved the curry in this recipe, but used the paneer recipe submitted by amibould instead.  Using buttermilk instead of lemon juice is amazing!!!  Use that paneer with this sauce, and you will love it.

I made paneer using a different recipe. I wanted something with more sauce so I added half of a small can of crushed tomatoes and increased the spices about 1 1/2 tsp each and added ground cumin and coriander. Omitted the chili pwd, just added a dash of cayenne. Didn't have corn or fresh coriander. Turned out wonderful!

I've made the paneer twice, with friends, and it's so much fun. Seeing milk turn into cheese is very, very exciting. We've used raw milk from the farmers' market, and it's been the most gorgeous buttercream color. Part of the leftover whey can go into the sauce--it's delicious.

This is a great dish once you get the hang of it.  I had a hard time with the cheese (paneer)the first time I made it. You need to keep adding lemon juice until you can see huge curds seperate from the liquid.  If you are unsure, you haven't added enough lemon juice.  I doubled the amounts of all the spices, since it is a little bland otherwise, but overall this is a keeper recipe that I will make again and again.

Very tasty dish.  I deep fried the cubed paneer as a friend from India said it would make it more authentic.

Very good dish, but find a recipe for Matar gravy and make extra.  Dish was dry without gravy, much better with.

Delicious!  I added about 5 ounces of plain yogurt and a dash extra of garam masala for the spice and it had a nice sauce that went a long way.

I followed a lot of reviewers' suggestions and subbed in Amibould's paneer recipe for the one in this one, and it still didn't save this dish. The seasoning is off and the result was dry and bland. Not making this one again. On a positive note - the other paneer recipe was really good...
