The first batch I made of this soup was nectar for the gods! I followed the recipe but left out the sherry. 
I liked it so much, I made a second batch last weekend but this time I tried to increase the yield by making some adjustments on the liquids and used a whole small onion . This batch was good but I  was disappointed because it wasn't as good as the first batch. Next time I  will make the original recipe again and make a second batch if I want more soup to freeze. 
Excellent recipe for my Instant Pot.  Thank you.

3.30.19  Shopped at Aldi today, and they had white mushrooms on sale for $.99/8-oz pkg, so three packages went into my cart for a Friday night soup and sandwich evening.    Followed the directions to the letter, and then made a few adjustments (personal preference here).  I wanted a thicker, creamier consistency, so I did add additional flour (Wondra®) mixed with more sherry (love sherry in mushroom soup).  Next time, I’ll use baby bella/cremini mushrooms for a bit bolder flavor, but this was not the least bit shabby made with less expensive white mushrooms.  Smooth, creamy, with a delicate flavor, and the thyme was the perfect herb for this soup.  So very, very easy.  This soup is good enough to serve to guests.  I’m always on the lookout for Instant Pot® recipes, and this is a good one…SAVED!!

It's a very safe soup. It's nice. It's soothing. It's just not inspirational. The  soup is one dimensional. It's missing something and I can't figure out what. It's kind of like what you'd get on a cruise.  At the end of the meal you'll know you had a soup but it could've been anything. If you happen to come up with an idea of what it lacks, comment. I'd curious what you came up with...

I only made half the recipe because I didn't have enough mushrooms and I used a mix of shitake and others like cremini and white.  My husband and I both loved it.  I will be making it again.

It turned out fantastic, just like what you'd get at a restaurant.  The only edit was half the thyme and used a low sodium chicken broth and the dish was salty enough. Will do this again!

Restaurant quality. Amazing.  The only thing I changed was using reduced sodium chicken broth because that is all I had. Also used a bit more garlic because I am a garlic addict. The taste was phenomenal and just what I needed on a cold and windy New England winter day.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very luxurious soup that could be found at a nice restaurant - just toast some bread for a giant crouton to put in the middle. Garnish. Maybe a dollop of creme fraiche. The only downside is that it’s not very filling. I would prefer more mushrooms. It works as a first course as it is though - an appetizer - that promises a great meal is coming soon.

Second time I’ve made this soup and it is sooooo delicious. I used a medley of mushrooms, from oyster to lions mane. I will definitely make it again and again. I also used the leftovers to make a scrumptious Beef Stroganoff. So, so good.

I made it exactly as directed except I didn’t have sherry, so added a different cooking wine, and I added a variety of mushrooms. It was excellent! My 14 year old gobbled it up, and even the leftovers the following evening were delicious.

I would suggest cutting the thyme in half. It was good but the thyme overpowered the rest.

Of course this is easy in the iInstantPot. I like my soup a little more creamy so next time I will use heavy cream instead of half and half which is what I had on hand. I'll see if that increases the thickness. Overall it is a pleasant soup.

I made changes based on ingredients in my fridge/pantry. 
Exchanged apple cider vinegar for the sherry (next time I’d use a 1/4 cup instead of the 1/2. Also used half and half instead of heavy cream because I had it. 
Finally, I had 1.5 lens of mushrooms so I used all white. 
Family still loved it and I’ll make it again. But less vinegary!

I used balsamic vinegar instead of  Worcestershire sauce as I didn't have any on hand, and fresh Thyme. I also added 1lb of Italian sausage. It turned out awesome and has been added to my favorites list to be made again in the near future! Next time I will make sure to have  Worcestershire sauce on hand. I love finding great new recipes for making in my instant pot!

Really easy and flavorful. I used fresh thyme and white wine instead of sherry. Garnished with fresh parsley and additional fresh thyme.

Yes, we added 1 1/2 cups diced potatoes and 1/2 cup finely chopped carrots.  It looked beautiful and tasted wonderful.  Ours was not so creamy, but we liked it that way.
