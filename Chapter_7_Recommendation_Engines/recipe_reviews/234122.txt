This is a great soup! I used hot Italian ground sausage instead of the pork and also added some diced red peppers and mushrooms to it. I also served it over some brown rice, which added some heartiness to it. Yum!

I added carrot, used sweet italian (from deli) and hot sausage, spinach, doubled the recipe for freezing, used Italian style diced tomatoes no salt added, one can of drained northern white beans and chopped red, yellow, and orange small peppers, added fresh pressed garlic. It turned our delicious, next time I will add little mushroom. Hearty and scrumptious! 
I always add a tablespoon of Turmeric to my soups and chili.

I have been loving a variation of this!  I've never made zuvchini soup prior to finding this recipe and I've been missing out!  I've made it a little different each time, but it's been good each way!  I likely don't put as much celery in as it calls for.  I also have added green cabbage each time, and love it!  I've done about 1/3 head of cabbage each time so it works out to be about equal parts zucchini and cabbage.  I added potatoes and rutabega when I wanted it more hearty for my husband.  I substitute 1 tbsp minced garlic for the garlic salt.  The sausage has enough salt so I don't add any.  Everyone has thoroughly enjoyed this dish, even those who aren't into healthy eating!  I made it with a couple big spoons of salsa once when I didn't have any tomatoes.  It was good that way too!

This soup  was delicious and easy to make! I was hesitant to make a hot soup in the summer, but I used fresh tomatoes from our garden,as the diced tomatoes, and prepared it outside on our grill. We also used our homemade goat soft cheese, as a topper, instead of cheddar cheese. Summer spectacular!

Excellent soup. Great flavor. Added potatoes so it was a bit more hearty. Will make again.

Very good. Used 5 mild Italian sausages, added 1/3 can Rotel for some kick.  Will add mushrooms next time I think as well as carrots.  Also, to make it thicker a can of refried beans would work well.

This was simple, quick to put together and so tasty! I used both sweet Italian sausage and the hot Italian sausage, and added some chopped fresh kale for extra veggies. Fantastic!

Easy and tasty soup. I used yellow squash, fresh tomatoes and added some cayenne pepper for flavor. I topped with an Italian blend cheese instead of cheddar.

Delicious soup!.  I added a pinch of red pepper flakes for a bit of heat.  Great way to use up zucchini from the garden.
