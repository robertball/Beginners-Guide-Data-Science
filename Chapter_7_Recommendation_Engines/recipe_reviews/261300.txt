Marvelous, absolutely marvelous!  Just a bit sticky making into balls, but worth it.  I put 53 on parchment lined sheets.  First batch cooked 10 min, 2nd cooked for 11 min which was better in my oven.  Perfect mix of chocolate & the twangy raspberry powder.

These were very tasty. In case you're wondering how much of the freeze-dried raspberries to buy, I found 1.25 ounces of freeze-dried raspberries was enough for the 1 1/2 cups.

I think this needs double acting baking powder, since you have to let it rest.  I found these to be too dense, I did not roll in raspberry powder as I accidentally threw it out.  They are just ok.  Work to result ratio is too high

We enjoyed these. I made them as directed, we thought they had a good chocolate flavor and a bit of tang from the raspberries countered the sweet cookie nicely.

This recipe was incredible! I used freeze dried strawberries because that's what I found. The strawberry flavor wasn't strong, and I'll probably use more freeze dried strawberries next time without crushing all of it. But I will definitely make these again!

I really wanted to like this recipe, they looked so pretty in the magazine. Living in Vermont, I had to mail order the freeze dried raspberries! This dough was really dry! I hoped when I put it in the refrigerator that it would settle down and the flour would absorb the little liquid there was. But alas, the next day when I took out the dough, it was a mass that crumbled like beach sand when I tried to touch it. I managed to make two test cookies, baked them, and they were extremely dry and unpleasant, and the raspberry flavor was masked by the strong chocolate. Perhaps there was too much cocoa powder (and no, I did not use Dutch processed), or just not enough liquid. What I will do is make my regular chocolate crinkle cookie recipe and roll in some of the expensive raspberry powder I created!
