This is a great recipe liked  by both gf and non-gf eaters.  The only change I made was to sub flax seed for the xanthan gum...just personal preference.. and baked in a bar pan. It made a wonderful replacement for pumpkin bars.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good bread - think non gf people would enjoy it too.  I enjoy cinnamon, so used more, about 3 tsp.   I didn't have xanthan gum in my gf flour mixture, so added in a bit of ground flaxseed.

This was really good.  Could use some more spice, but it's very moist and delicious.  I will definitely be making this again!

Overall really good bread.  I gave it 4 stars too as is a little dry.    I may add a little oil or fat to this if I make it again.

I made this last week  and am just starting to use some gluten free recipes simply because I have come to realize that I feel better, and less bloated when I swap out some baked goods especially with gluten free recipes, and everything I have made so far, is really good. Thanks for the recipe. I'll make it again and again.

I used to have an awesome recipe for pumpkin cookies but I haven’t been able to find it for a long time. This recipe is the closest I’ve gotten to that same flavor and texture. I made muffins instead of bread... baked them for 20 mins. They’re so delicious!! Thanks for the great recipe!

I wasn't too happy with this recipe.  It was on the dry side.
