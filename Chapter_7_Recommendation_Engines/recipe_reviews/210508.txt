This was really good. Even my lentil-phobic family members gave this recipe a thumbs up, which surprised me.  The balance of simple but bold flavors works.  I've never eaten the dish anywhere else, so I cannot comment on its authenticity, but I can tell you it's very tasty and makes a satisfying dinner paired with roti or naan.
