This is a solid recipe that produces nice moist not too sweet muffins. I would not normally grate and then measure the zucchini but I did this time.  I grated one average sized zucchini and it came to a bit less than 2 cups.  My container of lemon yogurt was only 6 oz so I added another 2 oz of plain greek yogurt.  I will try making these next time using applesauce and oil beaten with the egg instead of the butter.  I am glad I made these.  Thanks for a nice easy recipe.  UPDATE:  I meant to say that these don't rise really high so don't be afraid to fill your muffin cups - there was some batter left over after making 12  regular muffins.

I made these to take on a roadtrip and they are wonderful. I used 3 T. butter and 3 T. oil instead of all butter and they turned out fine. Great way to use all that zucchini. Seems like most recipes for baked goods call for 2 cups zucchini so I've been shredding it and wringing the moisture out in a clean dishcloth, then freezing in 2 cup portions.

Excellent way to use up all that zucchini from the garden.   I used two cups of grated zucchini and followed the recipe as written.  These are super moist and a nice change from regular zucchini bread.

I made these muffins as the recipe called and they were great. The second time I made them I made a quite a few substitutions to make them sugar-free.
6 tbsp of plain goat yoghurt (instead of lemon yoghurt), 2 tbsp of lemon juice, 6 tbsp apple sauce and 1/8 cup of oil (instead of butter), 1/4 cup of honey (instead of sugar) and 2 tbsp of lemon rind.
Baked at 365F for 20 min.
I also skipped the glaze to keep them sugar-free.

They browed easily but I found the middle to be a bit too wet. 

Next I will try reducing yoghurt and apple sauce to 5 tbsp each and baking at 350F for 35 min.

Excellent recipe.  The only change I made was to add an extra teaspoon of baking powder to make them puff up a little more.  I also left out the glaze and they were amazing.

Sorry, but this recipe is bad.  #1 it doesn't tell you how much zuchinni to add.  They come in various sizes.  I followed the recipe to a T, Measurements are vital.  Maybe 1/2 C. would have been alright.

I think these are my new favorite muffins!!! I had a ton of shredded zucchini in the freezer from last years garden and needed to use it up to make room for this years. So it looks like i'll be making this recipe a few more times. My changes were whole wheat flour instead of ap, organic cane sugar instead of white, and instead of butter i used 5 tablespoons of my homemade applesauce and 1/8 cup of flaxseed oil. I also didn't bother with the glaze and they were great!!!

I LOVE this recipe.  I have made it several times.  I do cook the glaze a little bit longer and it makes a beautiful shiny top on the muffins.  One time I added blackberries, another time I added blueberries, and one time with no fruit added.  My family and friends LOVE when I cook these.

Love the flavor.  I had to use vanilla yogurt from a large container so I measured in a cup and stirred in about a teaspoon of unsweetened lemon Koolaid powder.  I also used yellow zucchini to keep the lovely yellow color.  I only wish they had risen just a bit, they were very moist nearly custardy and oh so good.  I am trying them with the addition of baking powder to see if that will be as good and puff them up a little just for the look of it.  thank you for another good zucchini recipe.

Forget a muffin, these are more like a breakfast cupcake! Delicious, super soft and moist. Even with a well greased pan, I was scared they would break apart, but they came out great. I didn't have lemon yogurt, so I just used vanilla. I doubled the zest and the baking powder and shredded about 1-1.5 cups of zucchini. I didn't even bother with the glaze after tasting the batter. I knew they were going to be great without it and they were!

This recipe is just weird. I have never heard of melting butter for a baking recipe. The muffins seemed more like a German kuchen or cake. But not quite. I like the idea of the lemon and zucchini, but the texture was definitely not muffin consistency. Good idea, but gonna keep looking for a more bread like recipe.

These are more like cupcakes than muffins. I didn't bother with the lemon-sugar glaze as I found the base "muffin" way too sweet. If I make it again, I'll add some oats and reduce the sugar considerably.

This is the ONLY recipe I will use from now on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I omitted the butter because I try to go as low fat as possible and it turned out great!! In place of the butter I added just enough milk to make it a little more liquidy.  I shop at a tiny grocery which only had Pineapple greek yogurt which was fine. I love the batter!! It is the nicest batter I have seen!! I think the combination of the baking soda and lemon juice makes the batter super airy. That reaction between the two really adds a lot of air to the batter. Sometimes I add some kind of fruit to it like blueberries, dates etc which is really good too! I will keep this recipe the same but I will also tweak it and see what happens if I add more liquid...hoping to make a cake batter with it too!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this!!!!!!

This made a moist, lemony muffin, but they didn’t rise as I would have liked.

I made it Gluten Free by using 1 cup of Tapioca Starch, Potato Starch, and Rice Flour. The 3/4 cup of flour was Almond. My zucchini was large so I measured out only 2 cups of shredded zucchini. The recipe works fine but when I took it out of the oven, they deflated and had craters in the middle. Also, I was able to make 15 muffins in normal sized tins. Overall, a good taste but not the best look.

I loved this recipe.  I did switch the butter out for oil though (personal preference), and an extra baking powder as suggested by another review.  After reading others comments about them not rising,  I was surprised to see they had even risen beautifully and were light and fluffy.  Taste yummy too.  I didn't add the lemon drizzle, they didn't need it.  Yummy without. Again personal prefence.

I don't mind that the recipe has no specific amount of zucchini to add because I add as much as I want.  I doubled this recipe and doubled the lemon used in the mix and didn't make the glaze.  They are amazing.  My kids won't stop eating them.  We made them in the mini tin, extra yummy.  FYI I added approximately 3 cups zucchini to this doubled recipe.  :)

These had a good flavor.  I really loved the sauce that you drizzle on them.  However, mine didn't rise well.  Maybe because of the amount of zucchini I added that threw off the wet/dry ratio?  They ended up like wet sponges.  Not to waste, I had to freeze some because I was the only one who would them.

Delicious! I was out of baking soda so substituted Bisquick for the flour & baking soda. You would never know they had a vegetable in them!
Also used plain yogurt & fresh lemon juice with zest.

I love this recipe. I used 2 cups of zucchini and the only thing I changed was using vanilla Greek yogurt instead of lemon. And the only reason is because its all I had on hand. I didn't make the glaze and the muffins were sweet enough without it. I will make these again. Even my hubby liked them.

I used 1 cup shredded zucchini and Greek low fat lemon yogurt.  I also used canola oil instead of butter to lighten it up just a bit. And at the end I added fresh blueberries.  My family love this and no one knows it contains zucchini!

These muffins are wonderful! A nice change from the traditional zucchini muffin recipes.   My husband said this recipe is a keeper, and I plan to make them again.   I used oranges instead of lemons, because I had some oranges I needed to use up. Thank you, Kim!

Great recipe!  I sneak veggies in to almost every recipe for my picky toddler so I made the following variations: cut sugar down to 1/2 cup, added 1 more zucchini, cut butter in 1/2.  They are so sweet and flavourful, I don't even put the glaze on it! Good job :)

These muffins are very good!!  When a muffin is still moist the next day and tastes just as good as when it came out of the oven, then that is a good muffin.  I am now looking to take that base recipe and create a blueberry muffin.

Love these! I used whole wheat flour instead of AP to keep it healthier. Also, the store I went to had no lemon yogurt, so I grabbed lime. They came out perfectly! So moist, delicious and even TODDLER APPROVED!

SUPER moist and yummy!  Other reviewers said that they measured out 2 cups of zucchini...I finely shredded 2 smaller zucchini and it came out to about 1-1/4 cups and worked well

Awesome recipe! I doubled the baking powder and added about 1/2 tsp. of lemon extract because I love a very strong lemon flavor. For the glaze I mixed the lemon juice with powdered sugar and dipped the muffin tops in it. Will definitely make again!

I used sugar free vanilla yogurt and made up the difference with 3 ounces of ff yogurt.
Added extra lemon juice since I didn't use lemon yogurt.
Everyone loved them, they were more like a lemon bread pudding. Wonderful.

I used a gluten free muffin mix as a base and substituted oil in stead of butter.  They turned out great.  Love them, delicious, light, fluffy.   I could have eaten the whole pan of them!  (but controlled myself

This recipe is very simple.  I followed the directions as written.  It was a big it with my family.  I couldn't get enough to eat.  You can really taste the lemon flavor in the glaze, which was my favorite part of this muffin.  I will definitely make this again only the next time use a larger zucchini. I truly recommend this recipe to make these lovely muffins.

I used bottom of container (older) plain yoghurt and no lemon zest.  Just lemon juice and about 8 drops of doTERRA lemon essential oil (which is from the zest).
Delish!!!!

These are sooooooooooOOOOOoooooo good!!!  Like many others, I made them without the glaze to keep sugar content down, and used about 1/4 cup less sugar to start, as well as low fat sour cream in place of yogurt.  I also eliminated salt -- darned diet restrictions!! -- but they were rich, moist, plenty sweet and really delicious.  For added crunch I tossed in a handful of poppy seeds.  Yes, I know, how can I rate a recipe if I make changes?   It is called experience, for those who don't understand.  The base is sound, and the additions or subtractions, based on experience and trial and error, help me to know if the recipe is worth doing or not.  Do I have disasters?  You bet!!  But I know the difference between my disaster and the recipe.  Try it as written the first time, then, based on what you learn, adapt it to your tastes.  Next time, I will add more zest, as I like it a bit more citrusy, and cut back some of the oil.  Great recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing it.

These muffins were easy to make, and were a big hit with my family.  The recipe calls for "a zucchini", and taking the advice of another reviewer, I used two cups. It was just the right amount. I will be making these again!

I love making breads and muffins with zucchini.  It's a nice way to use up the zucchini from the garden.  This muffin recipe was quite good.  I had to substitute the lemon yogurt with sour cream and 1 tsp. of lemon extract because I did not have the yogurt.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I have made these 2 times and they are terrific! Grated  Zucchinis which yielded 2 Cups & used 8 oz  Sour Cream instead of yogurt. I doubled fresh Lemon Juice  as well as the Baking Soda as suggested by some others. I used 4 TBS Butter & 2 TBS Oil I spooned the batter into my paper lined tins which I filled to the top. Very Moist & So Delish!!!!

I make muffins all the time so I was excited to try a new recipe. They were very flat and stuck to the muffin papers so there were only two or three bites in each muffin.  And they were very, very bland.

These were so good right from the oven! My yogurt (plain) was only 6 ounces so I just added the entire stick of butter instead of  6 Tablespoons and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. I also added about 1/2 cup of carrot shreds because I had them. I just put on a simple powder sugar-lemon juice glaze and it was perfect. Not so sweet so they made a wonderful breakfast. Try them, you'll like them!

OMG these are so amazing! I used gluten free flour, and cannot even tell the difference. I can barely taste the zucchini, but the lemon is just amazing. Since i grown my own zucchini i wasn't sure what one zucchini should look like, since mine are monstrosities! I added about a cup and a half. I wasn't exactly being precise but it turned out fantastic.
Good way to sneak some veggies in a kid for sure, you know if i actually let the kids eats these muffins. THEY ARE AMAZING!!!

These were really good muffins! I had to change it up a bit because of what I had on hand. I used 4 cups Robin Hood Omega 3 Whole Wheat and Flax flour, 3/4 cups each white and brown sugar, 2 eggs, 3 cups pureed zucchini, 4 tsps baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tbsp vanilla, 1 cup vanilla yogurt, 1 lemon zested and juiced and 3/4 cup melted butter. It made 22 large muffins with my #50 scoop, baked at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. I skipped the glaze, it didn't need it, a very flavourful muffin.

Dynamite!  Made as written except added 2 Tbs. sour cream since only had 6 oz. container of yogurt, used 4 Tbs. butter plus 2 Tbs. vegetable oil instead of all butter, and added extra teaspoon of baking powder as others suggested.  Absolutely delicious, light and fluffy.  I think next time I will add 1/2 cup more zucchini (only used 1 c. this time) and I will try a powdered sugar and lemon juice/zest icing glaze to compare.  Will definitely make again.  My boyfriend loves any kind of goody with lemon.

I made the batter before I remembered I don't have muffin tins anymore so I made bread instead. It was done in about 50 minutes. The bread is good but the glaze didn't when. I can't quite figure out what I did wrong.

A-Maz-ing!  I followed the recipe with no major changes. My zucchini grated to about 2 cups. Next time I will add a little bit more zucchini for my taste. Quick, easy and delicious. It's a new favorite!

I did modify it a bit, not to change the flavor, but to substitute ingredients: Used sprouted wheat flour instead of AP, subbed 1/4 cup xylitol and 2 and 3/4 tbsp stevia for the sugar, I didn't have lemon yogurt, so I used plain yogurt (minus 1 tbsp) and doubled the lemon zest and lemon juice. I also finely shredded my zucchini. These were delicious with a slightly crispy exterior and really moist dense interior. They are slightly sweet; just perfect for us so we didn't make a glaze. My 22 month old loves them. I can't wait to make them again!

I have made this recipe 2x in the past week.  Once as muffins, once as bread.  Both times, moist, not too sweet and delicious.  I brought it to my office today (bread) and people are raving about it.  I use 2x of shredded zucchini per batch.  I have not included the glaze yet, but next time will try it. Big hit in my book.

Very lemony.Poking the muffins with a toothpick causes the glaze to soak in. Delicious. I substituted all purpose gluten free flour.

I love the muffin, but not the glaze, as the glaze really does make the muffin.  It wasn't really a glaze, as more a liquid.  I followed the recipe to a t, so that's my review!  Make it, change it to suit your needs!

Love the concept.  Next time instead of this glaze, I'll make a powdered sugar/lemon juice glaze just to drizzle on top.  This one was kind of thin and watery--got all over the outside of the muffin papers.  It didn't really seep into the toothpick size holes.  But, when I made a bigger hole to put it in, the middle of the muffin was a little soggy.

Doubled the amount of baking soda as others suggested and didn't even bother with the glaze and they are wonderfully light and just moist enough.  Great taste and definitely a keeper!  Also was very generous with filling the tins, and actually had leftover batter to do about 10 more in a mini-muffiin pan (using two cups of grated zucchini).  Thanks so much for sharing.

A very tasty unique recipe.  Everyone loved them.  I made a few minor changes...my lemon yogurt was 6 oz. so I made up the difference with buttermilk.  Used 2 cups shredded zucchini.  Used confectioner's sugar instead of regular for glaze.  And I highly recommend using the glaze.  I felt it made the lemon flavor really pop.  Next time I make them I'm going to use my mini muffin pan.  A great addition to a brunch.
