I used Honeycrisp apples - this is such a light and refreshing salad.   Loved it!

We liked this a lot though I did use more cucumber and less apple. That's just how the size of my food worked out, it wasn't a well thought-out plan or anything. Tasted great, thanks!

A great summertime recipe. This easy to make recipe is spot on for those summer picnics. The raspberry vinaigrette adds the perfect touch. I recommend to only add the raspberry vinaigrette when ready to eat the salad.

I've made this for Easter Dinner. It is delicious. Light and refreshing. I'll be making this all summer for a quick lunch.
