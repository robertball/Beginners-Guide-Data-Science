These were pretty good. I did add more seasoning to the pork. I liked the bacon and cheese combo but you really have to move fast which is tricky. I recommended cooking the bacon in a separate skillet as the chops are cooking so that they get done at the same time.

I made this for me and my husband the other night and we absolutely loved it. We don't eat pork chops or bacon often and I'm glad we chose this way to eat it this time.

You really have to be fast! But it's simple and good. Not much more you could ask for. This is a simple idea and it'll only turn out as good as you are skilled as a chef. Or at porchops ^.^

Very good and a hit with the kids. I salted the first side against the pan with olive oil, then seasoned the raw tops as instructed and with more salt. Flipped over, added cracked pepper to the cooked tops, and when it was nearly cooked through I added the cheese and (precooked) bacon before putting the lid on. Turned out great, and the cheese that spilled over the edge and toasted against the pan was tasty.

Came out good. Made it a suggested, next time might add a bit more spice. I used a good cheddar and covered the pan to melt the cheese then added an unsalted bacon. Might use a pepper jack next time we make it.

Absolutely loved this.  My kids who are super picky ate it so quick.
