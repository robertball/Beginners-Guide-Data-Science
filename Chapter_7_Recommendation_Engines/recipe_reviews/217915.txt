Fabulous!  I substituted yogurt for the buttermilk and it still turned out moist and… well… amazing. Thank you! UPDATE: I am surprised that some people have been having difficulty with this recipe.  The baking time for me was perfect.  It is worth noting that the recipe is Ree Drummonds (The Pioneer Woman) and step-by-step instructions can be found on her website.

My little secret is to add some cream cheese and lime or lemon juice to the icing. MMM!
A little less sweet, and a lot more creamy goodness!

The cake tasted veryy delicious!!! I did google ree drummonds after reading another review here and found step by step instructions with pictures. This was my first time making a cake and I was very delighted with the result.

A couple of things:

I thought the icing was a little too sweet even though I didn't use all of the icing I made. I did end up cutting the amount of sugar in the cake by a 1/4 cup. (I thought this was just right)

After reading one of the reviews, I decided to put the butter/coffee mixture in an ice bath for it to cool until the butter began to solidify again (i'm not sure what the purpose of this was).

The baking time, however, was almost twice as long. I checked it periodically and took it out of the oven when the toothpick came clean.

Nonetheless, people were impressed.

I'm giving this one 1 star only because the ingredients seem to be way off. There's far too much liquid and not enough binding agents to get this cake to actually turn out. I baked this cake for 90 minutes in a large springform pan and it still wasn't fully cooked. The outer edge was baked enough that we could try it and it does taste good. It just really needs an ingredient adjustment.

https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/217915/coffee-cake-literally/ ... 10.20.12 ... Other than increasing the salt to half teaspoon, I followed the recipe - Unusual for me. :D  Very good!  It was kinda low though using 9" pans.  'Done in 25.  This cake came out of the pan better than any cake I can remember.  It was beautiful.  The frosting does to need to have the sweetness cut some.  Maybe subbing buttermilk for the heavy cream?  Adding sour or cream cheese as others did?  Oh, it's good.  Just remember to have cake with it instead of the frosting knife alone.  :)

Perhaps the key to this cake is to let the coffee and butter mixture cool until it starts to solidify again. I did not do this, and my completed batter was liquid, so in my alarm I added half a cup of flour. I was surprised when the cake actually baked through in 50 minutes (n a bundt pan). It was a tasty cake, but it was quite heavy with a stodgy middle. Maybe this was because I'd added the extra flour. My only other variation was substituting yoghurt for buttermilk. Pity. I really wanted this recipe to work.

It was alright, the cake took a lot longer than stated in the recipe to bake. I cut down on the sugar but still found it overwhelmingly sweet. I've found nicer coffee cake recipes that have used less butter, so I won't make this one again

Very unique cake. Frosting is outstanding. Instructions seem a bit innacurate. I had to bake them twice as long as instructed.

I made this for my birthday cake and we really enjoyed it! The only change I made was subbing yogurt for buttermilk, and I only made a half recipe/one layer. I baked in my convection oven at 325 and it took exactly 20 minutes. It was a bit more caffeinated than I expected, my son kinda looped out on me :) but very tasty, thanks ern for sharing your recipe!

I made this for my husband who loves coming home to the smell of baked goods. I had to modify it to match the ingredients I had on hand, but it turned out amazing. I used fresh coffee in place of the instant coffee with boiling water and almond milk instead of the buttermilk. I also skipped on the icing and made a glaze with powdered sugar and almond milk instead to drizzle on top of the slices. 
I cooked it in a 9x13 pan for about 35 min., cut it into squares, drizzled them with the glaze, and served. It was a nice touch for dessert, breakfast the next morning, and as a drop-in gift for the neighbors. 
I am going to make it again this weekend, but instead I am going to mix coffee with the powdered sugar instead of almond milk for the glaze.
Happy Baking!

Yumm!!! I did mine with vanilla yogurt in place of buttermilk and a couple tsps of instant coffee mixed with cool whip for the icing because it's what I had lol. It turned out great though! And my husband liked that it wasn't as sweet with the cool whip. I did have to cook it almost twice as long as the recipe says but omg irrelevant because this is deeeeelish :)

I made the cake as is, and it was not good at all.  I ended up taking this idea, and using my fav chocolate cake recipe (subbing flour for the cocoa) with 1c of strong coffee and it was far better.

I followed the recipe exactly, and I can't rate it highly enough. The texture is wonderful, it's light and moist and the coffee flavor and sweetness is just right. I made cupcakes and wanted to be quite generous with the frosting, so I increased the quantity of that by about a third which provided enough to cover the 24 cupcakes that the cake batter produced. A delicious recipe that I have already used more than once and will definitely use again.

The batter seemed really runny. I baked it extra long and it turned out ok. 
Next time I think I will use a little less liquid.
It needs to bake longer than the instructions. I made the mistake of checking it too early and that caused the center of it to drop.
The frosting could possibly use a little extra coffee flavor although it seems to intensify as it sits. It is very sweet. I might try adding a little cream cheese to the frosting.
It isn't a recipe that will get raves but I think it is tasty as a little different option.

We looooves it! Can't believe there aren't more people making this fairly simple and easy recipe that has the best coffee kick ever. Remember to wait for the butter/ coffee to cool completely before you mix, that's all.

it wen horrible. made for a birthday cake for someone I love. more than 2 hours to cook, and was all transparent and didn't rise. I really don't know how people made it, I'm only a teen but normally I'm a fantastic cook. also this is measured in cups. I'm in the UK with grams. this is not accurate because according the table it is measured differently depending on what it is. I'm sorry, but it was dreadful to watch it fail. nice taste, just looks appealing. sorry

Absolutely delicious!!

I substituted decaf coffee crystals and my tasters said they couldn't tell the difference.

My attempt was edible but too solid. The recipe is too sweet for me and in hindsight, I would have chosen confectionary sugar instead of regular one since it was too crunchy. I gave it away and my watchmen and women loved it. I would retry it with (less) confectionary sugar and more vanilla or rum flavor because the taste was great.

I followed the recipe exactly except I used another poster's trick of substituting plain (fat-free Greek) yoghurt instead of buttermilk.   I had never before seen the technique of mixing the baking soda with the buttermilk (or in my case yoghurt) which reacts to create an aerated foamy mixture which greatly lightens up the wet mix at the last step!  What a revelation for me!  The result was a very moist but light cake that was absolutely delicious.   I will be making this again.

Oh my word... if only I could rate it a 10. This cake was fantastic! It was all gone within 24 hours. Super moist and it was like having a sweetened cup of coffee. The only adjustments that I had to make was to increase the cook time about 10 minutes (used a 9x13 glass dish), and added a bit more coffee to the frosting. Our family likes strong coffee. Everyone of us (there are 3) really enjoyed this cake. Fantastic recipe and a keeper for sure. Thanks!

Very tasty cake! I cut down 1/2 to 1/3 of the sugar and the cake is still a bit too sweet - especially the frosting. I used half the amount of everything for the frosting suggested in the receipt and it's already enough to cover the whole cake.  Like everyone else, I had to bake it for much longer than suggested (50 mins maybe) or else the centre of the cake would still be liquid. Perhaps that's why the receipe suggested us to cook it in two cake tin. I just used one and therefore the cake is much thicker. Anyway, the cake is really yummy and everyone loves it! Thank you!

This recipe is perfect. Just follow all the ingredients and the steps. But next time I would add more coffee so it will taste more.

1. I substituted the buttermilk into 1/2 cup of milk and 1 tbs of lemon juice and let it sit for 2-3 minutes.

2. I need 45 minutes until the cake was ready in the oven.

3. I made sour cream frosting with this recipe http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Sour-Cream-Chocolate-Frosting/Detail.aspx . I used 6 tbs of sugar and it was too sweet. I think you should reduce the amount of sugar if you want to use the original recipe of the frosting for this coffee-cake. It is way too-sweet.

I would definitely make this cake with this recipe again in the future

SERIOUSLY the most moist, flavorful cake I have ever made!  The coffee flavor isn't over-powering... it's almost a caramel-type flavor.  The frosting is EXCELLENT and I topped it with mini milk choc chips and chopped pecans.

The flavor of the cake batter was rich and packed a punch - exactly what coffee cake should be. The frosting was a tad sweet, will cut down if I make it again next time. The cake didn't really rise so came out a little dense, not sure if that's meant to be that way? Overall, still a good traditional coffee cake recipe. 4 stars.

I had my doubts about this recipe at first but I just rolled my sleeves and made it today. I followed the recipe strictly and halved it because I wanted to make just one 8" round. It smelled like a welcoming coffee café. The color was perfect mocha, tasted divine. The texture was fluffy, moist and soft. It's not really spongy and that's how I wanted it to be. Reminded me of my visits to grandma.

My daughter is a huge coffee lover so asked for a coffee flavored birthday cake. So glad I found this recipe for her. I used dark chocolate frosting instead (per her request) and she loved it! This recipe made her day and made me super mum of the year. Thanks so much for sharing!

I have made this many times. I always increase the amount of instant coffee to 9 tablespoons because I like a strong coffee flavor. I also never make the frosting because I find the cake sweet enough. I love eating it for breakfast.
