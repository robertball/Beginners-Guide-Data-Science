Wow, this made so much food! We made some changes to the dish, and it was amazing! We only baked it for 35 minutes because the cheese on top was getting overdone on 350 degrees F. We used turkey instead of sausage and added 2 cloves of garlic and a half cup of yellow onion to spice up the turkey. Also we used 1 jar of Emmeril's "Roasted Red Pepper" sauce in addition to one jar of the marinara.  Using only 3 cups of cheese instead of 4 made us feel better about the high fat content. But we used italian cheese instead of just plain mozzarella. It was excellent, and now we have food for days!

This truly is the Best Ziti Ever.  It makes an enormous amount of food, so this would be great to take to a pot luck dinner or just to serve a large family.  The smell while it was cooking was absolutely divine.  I felt like I was at an Italian restaurant.  This dish is restaurant quality.  I didn't change a thing.  It is perfect just the way it is.  Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe.

Like others, I found this recipe made waaaaay more than I thought it would. I'm really glad I cut it in half, as there are only two of us :). I added some sauteed mushrooms to the sausage layers. I also mixed fresh basil in with the ricotta, and used oregano and marjoram instead of italian seasoning (I didn't have any). We both love anything with ricotta cheese, and the cheese was definitely a star in this dish. Even though it has pasta in it, I found that the leftovers were very good, not dry at all. It froze nicely, too. A delicious alternative to lasagna, I'll make this again for sure!

This dish definitely gets five stars for taste!  Remember though that it takes MANY dirty pans and dishes (ie pasta, sauce, saute- three different pans)  to make this.  BUT - it could be done well in advance and then popped in the over since everything is cooked already and you are just reheating.

This is a great recipe.  I skiped the step to heat up the sauce, it was not needed and I didn't want to dirty another pan.  The left overs were great the next day too!  Highly recommend!

Rating again....GREAT! Family still loves it, and made it for the masses...awesome! Thanks again for a fab recipe!


Yum!!!!!!!!  I fed numerous neighbor kids...the family, and a couple of other neighbors that stopped by for a glass of wine...wow.  I did add a whole chopped onion, some mushrooms, and some garlic (about 3 cloves)...this IS the recipe...I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and will do so next time too!  I'm making that when the in-laws come next week...thanks SO much!!!!!

I really liked this recipe, and it was awesome the next day too!  What I did was instead of layering everything I mixed it all together and added 3 eggs (lightly beaten)on top and then added the cheese.  The eggs give it an excellent flavour!  Thanks for this great recipe!

Tasty! I made a healthier version using whole wheat pasta, low fat ricotta and shredded chicken rather than sausage. I also added parmesan to the mozzarella for a little more flavor and turned the broiler on during the last 2 minutes so the cheese on top browned nicely.

I used elbow macaroni (sorry--that was all I had), I made my own marinara sauce and used my own homemade italian seasoning. Because I'm really trying to stretch the amount of food we have on hand for leftovers, I sauteed some onion, garlic and a good amount of fresh sliced mushrooms and added it to the marinara with the italian sausage. Because we can't afford ricotta, I used "trim" cottage cheese. We loved it. Very good. The personal touches really made a simple dish shine AND we have enough leftovers for at least one more family meal, maybe even a lunch, too.

I actually omitted the sausage from this recipe, spiced it up a bit more (garlic powder and Mrs. Dash) and I received amazing reviews from an extremely picky family.

I don't believe in changing a recipe and then rating it....Having said that, this recipe was very, very good just as it's posted.  If I was a young cook and followed the directions, I, and my friends would be in heaven.  This recipe got rave reviews from my family and we will most definitely be making this one again.  Thank you for a very easy and user friendly version of lasagna.

Very good and relatively easy to make. I used Trader Joe's Italian chicken sausage with red wine and cheese, which was awesome. I used slightly less mozzerella, and I didn't have italiain seasoning, so I just threw in some basil and oregano, but didn't sprinkle any on top. My 2 year old and husband enjoyed this.

The basic recipe is good but I kicked it up a bit. For the sausage mixture I used 1/2 lb sweet sausage, 1/2 link hot sausage, 1/2 lb mixed beef,veal & pork, 1 lge onion chopped, 2 cloves garlic, sliced mushrooms and seasonings.
To the Ricotta I added 1 egg more garlic and Italian seasoning.
There is also no need to heat the marinara before baking if you buy a good one.
Total: 2 pots, 1 bowl, cutting board, knife and 2 spoons.
Results: excellent & easy

I have to respect the comments from other reviewers when they say this makes a "LOT"!  They were not kidding. I put mine in 2 containers; one 8 x 8 for Hubby and me and still had more than enough for a 9 x 11 to give to my daughter who has 5 kids. They loved it and so did we. A salad, crusty bread and this recipe create a lovely meal! Many thanks for sharing!!! Had more than enough leftover for Honey to take to work. Apparently, he shared it with coworker who had forgotten their lunch. Coworker wants recipe!! Yikes!

Okay, so seriously this is the best ziti I've ever dreamt of making!  How awesome is it that this is also the first I've ever attempted!  :D  *proud moment*  I followed the recipe method to the T, with the exception of adding some onion and garlic to the sausage as it cooked.  I'm still not sure how I fit it all into a 9x13.  I had my doubts, but I kept smushing it as I went and it all somehow fit in...and didn't even boil over.  My husband, a big Italian food critic, loved it!!!  Thank you!!!

This was really delicious, but I had to keep correcting my family when they referred to is as "lasagna" instead of ziti!  The only thing I did differently was to "doctor up" the jarred marinara sauce by sauteing fresh minced garlic, finely chopped onion, green pepper & mushrooms in the saucepan before adding the sauce & basil.  I also threw in about 2 T. of grated Parmesan cheese. I let the sauce simmer about 20 minutes while I prepared the rest of the ingredients, then assembled & baked as directed.

Ziti is one of my favorite Italian dishes and this was a great tasting, easy version.  Just be forewarned that it does make A LOT, so if you want to, put it in smaller dishes and freeze some of it.

Recipe is "okay" the way it is written but a few sight adjustments will make this simple dish really good.  First, cook pasta only about 5 minutes and let the sauce (yes you will need more than what is called for here) soak into and finish cooking the pasta in the oven. Use 4-5 cups of a good sauce.  Use 15oz Ricotta and add 2 Tablespoons of Olive Oil (go ahead and put the basil here instead of the sauce)and add about 1/3 cup parmesan to the mixture, forget the Italian seasoning expecially if you are using a good seasoned sauce.  Increase mozzarella to taste but be sure to sprinkle the top with about 1/4 cup parmesan too.  For those that complained about using several pots, simply use the pasta pot to cook the sausage after you have dumped the pasta out, then put the sausage aside and heat your sauce in that same pot.  Still find it a bit bland?  Add about 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes to the sausage while browning.  And yes, a pound of pasta, pound of sausage, over 3 cups of cheeses, plus several cups of sauce layered into a 9X13 pan is definitely going to make more than 4 serving...LOL...just read the recipes and do the math.

Everyone in the family loved this ziti.  We even fought over the leftovers (which were also very good).  The only thing I did different from the recipe was to mix the marinara in with the cooked sausage to save the mess.  It worked just fine.

I made this recipe twice...once with spaghetti sauce and it was good. The second time I made it with Bertollis Red Wine Marinara Sauce. I also didnt precook the noodles I just added 3/4 cup water - and we still had the BEST Ziti Ever! And yess it does make alot...about 18 servings! But it reheats well.

After all my mother was Italian and it is a no no to use jar sauce. You can but the real italian resturants don't and is worth the extra effort to make your own!
 
This was fantastic. I made my own gravy (sauce) from scratch with olive oil,garlic, fresh basil,ground black pepper, little fresh oregano, fresh basil from the garden, 1/4 cup  red wine (chianti) crushed tomatoes. locatelli cheese and tomatoe paste (I don't like jar sauce)then I followed all the instructions except I used half pound of semolina ziti and a half pound of whole wheat penne cooked ala dente (9 minutes). I also used 1 full pound of ricotta, plus sharp provolene, grated romano, locotelli and 1lb mozzarella and cooked 1 hour at 350. My sausauge was real italian with fennel. and on the top more 4 cheese and a lot of fresh basil fron the garden. Turned out fantastic! We always serve this with a mixture of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, oregano, fresh garlic & garlic powder. a little hot pepper, salt , fresh ground pepper and fresh tomatoes cut in quaters and fresh italian bread for dipping in the oil mixture. Served with red wine we like Chianti.

Excellent! I used the Italian Cheeses rather than Mozerella, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. I halved the ingredients since I only needed to feed 4. Assembled it yesterday so only had to put it in the oven when we got in from church. Will make it again! Thanks!!

Update-have made this several times now. But today for some reason I layered it in a deeper square pan, and when I finished, I realized I hadn't put in the sausage!! I mixed it all together & it still was wonderful!

I've never made anything like this before, using the ricotta was so nice.  Of course anyone can change the recipe to make it low fat, but what's the point?  Just dont eat 2nds !  It's fantastic as is, and yes we put away several containers in the freezer - I'm always happy to have fabulous left overs later.

My family loves this recipe and co-workers want it. I made slight changes to it. Instead of 2 jars of sauce I used 1. I also added an Italian cheese blend along with the mozzarella. I would recommend to anyone A+++

This was AWESOME! I didn't heat the sauce first and I omitted the basil and pepper, but everyone loved it! It fills a 9x13 to the top, so you may want to put a cookie sheet on the rack below it (I had a tiny bit bubble over from the sauce). I will definitely make this again.

I mixed together the meat, basil, sauce, and pasta. Poured half in a buttered casserole dish, layered the ricotta with Italian seasoning over that, then half the mozzarella cheese, the rest of the pasta/sauce mixture, and the rest of the mozzarella on top.  Pretty good.

Amazing!  I would not change a thing only recommend you somewhat under cook the ziti-it will soften in the oven.  Loved it and will make it again.

Not the best ziti ever in my opinion! Reminded me more of lasagna than a traditional ziti. I think it needs a little more sauce.

We loved this!  I always alter recipes to be a little more healthy, thus I used whole wheat penne, chicken sausage, 1/2 the amount of mozzarella and cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  One tip I picked up from another recipe is to blend an egg into the cottage cheese (used my stick blender for this) and I also added a box of frozen spinach (defrosted with water pushed out).  I sprinkled the italian seasoning on top.  Plenty of food, so the second half is in the freezer for another night.

Made this tonight for dinner and it was a HUGE hit! I made with 1/4 lb italian sausage and 1/2 lb ground beef. I made my own sauce of tomatoe sauce, crushed tomatoes, tomatoe paste, basil, oregano, sugar and garlic. I diced some pepperoni and added to the mix. I was out of mozz cheese, so I substituted colby jack cheese and topped with whole pepperoni. My kids raved and raved. My 6 year old son complained the whole time I was fixing dinner, saying he wouldn't eat it...He scarfed it down and asked for seconds!! I served it with French Herb Bread from this site. Definitely a keeper...Thanks so much for sharing!

I made this recipe, but modified it because I was just being REALLY lazy and kind cheap :) I halved the recipe since everyone said it made so much food.  I halved it and we still had enough left overs for a couple dinners! First, ground beef was cheaper at the store than sausage so I used that and threw in a little Italian seasoning.  I just used jar sauce.  I also threw in some sliced pepperoni, because that is what my botfriend likes.  The only thing I will do next time is drain the ricotta a bit more and perhaps stir in and egg.  But this is a GREAT recipe.  Like Lasanga, but MUCH easier and much cheaper!  I will definately make this agian

Good and easy. We didn't bother layering, just set aside about 1/2 the cheese and mixed everything. After putting it into the pan we covered it with the rest of the cheese. Very good and was a crowd pleaser at the family Christmas potluck.

This is a good recipe. I customized it a bit by adding chopping and adding a whole tomato and 6 oz of spinach. My husband devoured it and hes not a huge vegetable fan. Hey, I got to sneak them in when I can!

Quickly becoming one of the family's favorite dishes.  The only change I recommend is to soften the ricotta so it is easier to evenly distribute in the dish.

This recipe is delicious! I did not heat the sauce in advance, I just poured it into the pan straight from the jar. I used spicy Italian sausage and it turned out well if you like crushed red pepper. The recipe does make quite a bit. I will make this dish again.

This was fabulous! I used penne instead if ziti and it worked just as well. I combined the cooked sausage with the sauce to elimate the extra steps and pans. I also used more ricotta. This was delicious!

This makes an enormous amount of food.  I would say easily serves 8.  I added more ricotta and less mozzeralla cheese.  I used Spicy sausage and spicy marinara sauce to pull more flavor.

I am  giving this 4.5 stars because I made this using the sauce from Worlds Best Lasagna (elswhere on this site) rather than pre-made jarred sauce. 
I also added red wine instead of water in that recipe and reduced the sugar.
Additionally, I made a few minor adjutments to the recipe: I added 2T fresh italian parsley, finely shredded romano cheese, and an egg to the ricotta.
And I used Ronzoni Smart Taste Penne Rigate. (It has 3 times the fiber and tastes like regular).
It was a huge hit! I think (like most of us who alter a recipe) that with the alterations it is a ***** recipe.  I  want to try it next time with hot italian sausage.
Please note: This serves way more than 4! (Unless they are huge very very hungary men). More like 8-10 with a salad and bread.  I divided up the leftovers and placed them in the freezer.
Thank you for the recipe!

This dish was really good! To my surprise my mother loved it which was really amazing because she doesn't even like italian sausage.

This was delicious and very easy to make. I like that you can make it ahead of time and pop it in the oven when you're ready. Will make again and again.

I just made this tonight and it was delicious! Only thing I did different was add a little hamburger meat and used spicy Italian sausage.   It made so much.   I will definitely make this recipe again.

My son was craving the baked ziti he had while living in an Italian neighborhood in New Jersey.  He gave this recipe two thumbs up!  It's so quick and easy, with few ingredients but it's a really good comfort food dish.  I've prepared this recipe many times, often when I have dinner guests on short notice, and it always gets rave reviews.  We like it best with spicy Italian sausage and fresh basil in the layers with the dried basil on top.

All my kids liked it, including the 5 year old who normally only eats pb & j!  Very good, even though I only had 2 cups of Italian Blend cheese on hand to use in place of the mozzarella and used the whole container (15 oz) of Ricotta.  

I also simmered the sauce, basil and sausage together after draining the meat, which saved a pan and made layering simple.  

Thanks for a family pleasing recipe!

This was by far the best tasting simple pasta dish we've ever had.  The only thing we did different was add an extra pound of sausage.  The recipe makes quite a bit, great for a potluck or having friends over.

My friends love when I make this. I use the entire container of ricotta (15oz) and 1 jar of Prego's fresh mushrooms sauce. Also, I only use about half a box of noodles.

I really enjoyed this ziti. It almost overflowed from my baking dish so next time I will probably add a little less of everything. I also think I would exclude the ricotta, it didn't do much for the dish. Overall, very very yummy! I had leftovers for days.

Very good!  Due to a limited amount of time, I mixed all the ingredients together and baked it like a casserole.  I used store bought spaghetti sauce instead of marinara sauce and still added the seasonings.  Baked it for only 25 min and it was great!

My wife and my best friend said it was amazingly good, and it was the first time I had ever attempted this dish. Thank you for posting this!  The only change I made was that I minced 1 garlic clove in and added 1 oz. of thinly sliced baby portabella mushrooms.   Other than those 2 additions, I followed your instructions to a winning dish.

Great base recipe!  I omitted the mozarella, added more rosemary and red pepper flakes, and subbed cottage cheese for the ricotta.  Very flavorful recipe with all the herbs.

First time I have ever made this dish and my family loved it! After reading the other reviews I cut the recipe in half and still had a small container left over. This was after feeding 3 adults & 1 child. My picky husband asked me to keep this recipe on hand!

My family and I enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have ziti so I used whole grain penne and half a jar of Prego Traditional Spaghetti Sauce. Also sauted minced fresh garlic in with the Italian sausage.... mmmm the kitchen smelled great and the taste of the recipe was equal.

First time making ziti and it was a hit all around from my 5 yr old to the company we had over.  I made it meatless and added some parmesan cheese to the top.  I didn't didn't heat up the sauce or put the basil/Italian seasoning on the top as I didn't feel it was needed.  I can't wait to make it again!

I wouldn't say this was the best ziti ever, however, it is good.  Nothing that stands out... just a regular ole pasta dish.  It could have everything to do with the sauce.  It was a little on the bland side.  I had to add salt and olive oil to my bowl.

This was very good. I used hot Italian sausage and Bertolli's 5 Cheese spaghetti sauce. I usually use Prego, but it wasn't on sale. The next time I make this I will add an egg to the ricotta for easier spreading. I doubled the recipe and fed about 16-20 people. Definitely a keeper in my recipe book.

This recipe was great! Half was gone the first day, the rest gone after school the next day. I think I actually prefer making this to lasagna.. I ended up having to make some mods. to use up what I had. ~Used the rest of World's Best Pasta Sauce [which ended up being a lot less..] so did not need to prepare the meat,16oz sour cream rather than ricotta [saw it used in other ziti recipes]]an as much cheese as I could throw on. I actually chose this recipe cause it didn't call for provolone [something else I would have had to sub]. Would make again in a heartbeat!! Muchas gracias

This turned out very delicious.  Nothing like the dried out baked ziti I have had every other time.  My kids would prefer ground beef used instead as it gives a milder flavor.

This amount fed my family of 8 for dinner and lunch the next day! Everyone loves it. Tried it using homemade marinara and found it wasn't cost efficient. Love this recipe! We have it once a month!

Great, but it needs a little more spice.  I will add red pepper flakes to the meat next time.

This was delicious and easy.  I used hot italian sausage and Sargento's Mozzerella and Provolone mix shredded cheese.  Soooo good!

This is a really tasty and easy dish.  Yes, be prepared to have a lot of ziti to finish off. Might take a few days.  The only change I made is I used 1/2 lb sweet Italian sausage and 1/2 lb ground beef. Only because I thought my picky girls and husband would notice the sausage and complain but the didn't even know the difference. I am making this again soon for a houseful of guests. Serve with garlic bread and a salad and that's all you need.

This recipe does make a lot!  If I make it again, I think I would cut down on the pasta, and increase the ricotta cheese.

Excellent dish!  We are very busy during the week and this dish was perfect for us!  So easy to make and very few ingredients which was easy on the wallet!  Kids loved it and even asked for seconds.  Didn't change a thing and we appreciated the leftovers!

This was very, very good! I did not heat the sauce (felt it was not necessary), and I did not have any Italian seasoning, so I used Italian salad dressing (I've always used plain ricotta in recipes, so the Italian seasoning was a great idea to add flavor-thanks for the useful tip!).  Also, I mixed the Basil in the ricotta cheese instead of in the sauce.

Followed this recipe pretty much to a T and it turned out to be quite good.  I halved it and had more than enough for my husband, myself, our 4 year old son AND leftovers.  The ricotta is, for me, what gives this dish its yummy factor.  Next time, I would probably use half sausage, half ground beef or I may even omit the meat and use spinach instead.  Thanks.

This was good, I added cilantro to the marinara while it was on the stove. This gave it a little extra flavor. I think that next time I may add some onions and garlic also.  I only cooked for about 30 minutes. Very good dish, I look forward to leftovers tomorrow!

This was so delicious! Super easy to make. I too left out the sausage and it was wonderful. I didn't have to add one thing. I will definately be making this one again!! Instead of heating the marinara sauce separate I just mixed it with the hot noodles. Works just as good with one less step!

Yum!  This was a great pasta dish, and very easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was excellent!  It makes WAY more than 4 servings, so you can cut the recipe in half, and still easily serve four hungry people.  Especially if you serve it with a salad and some garlic bread.  I will making this one again and again!  Thanks!! :)

I made this when I had dinner for some friends and they loved it.  They actually said it was the "best ziti ever".  The only things I changed were that I added some chopped onion with the sausage and I used our favorite sauce instead of marinara. I will definitely be making it again!

It is 5 stars for me, but I changed some things.  I used turkey Italian sausage, 12 oz ricotta and 1/4 cup cottage cheese, I also used 2 cups mozzarella and 1/2 cup cheddar, I added parmesan to the top.  SOOOOOO GOOD!

I like the fact that you can make a refridgerate this recipe a head of time. It's good if you want a nice dinner but don't have the time to make it fresh. Although next time I may half the pasta and double the meat.

This is just a poor recipe, and I can only guess that those who like it have not been exposed to much quality Italian food. The ingredients are all out of proportion--too much pasta, way too much sauce, too little cheese and sausage. And it makes 6-8 servings, not 4. The baked ziti recipe found on most ziti boxes is far superior to this--just add sausage to the standard recipe, and you're good to go.

Definitely a keeper!  Made this tonight in 2 - 8x8 baking  dishes.  I made the recipe with the following tweaks:  added 1 egg , some  fresh grated parm cheese and fresh basil to ricotta.  Used Fusili (curly shaped pasta)  just one jar of marinara (unheated).  Omitted the Italian seasoning.   Had some prepared frozen meatballs and  put 9 meatballs (18 total)  on top of each 8x8 baking dish and pushed them under the cheese (it was an after-thought but worked great).   Easy to put together and my husband LOVES it (told me to  make it again).  :)

Easy and tasty! Makes a lot, reheats beautifully. My sauce came in glass jars so I just opened them up and  microwaved in the jar until heated somewhat, to speed up cooking of the casserole, saving a pan.

I was disappointed! It tasted fine, but lacked so much flavor! I never change the recipe the first time I make something, and this was no exception, but if I do make this again, I will be adding a LOT in the way of spice. All in all, I thought it was a rather boring dish.

Easy to prep and very tasty. I'm a garlicy / spicy person so I seasoned the mixture with garlic and some Italian seasonings, and used hot sausage. Everyone had seconds.

This ziti is perfect. I am a vegetarian, so I substitute ground beef with Morning Star ground beef crumbles. The recipe makes a lot, but I always make it as is because it reheats really well. Best leftovers ever.

We really liked this.  I made it as written, except I used 15 oz of ricotta.  I would not use less.  I also used fresh basil from my garden.  I divided the recipe and froze a small portion.  However, next time I would divide it in half. Half would be sufficient for us for a meal.

Made this the first time exactly as the recipe directed. I liked it but felt it could use some garlic for a little extra flavor. Since we love mushrooms I will also add some. Overall, this is really a good casserole that I will use many more times.

OMG - so good. The ricotta made me think of lasagna. I made one slight change by using hot turkey Italian sausage.  I will make this again.

We eat a lot of varied Italian foods and our family was very disappointed after reading all the rave reviews.  Dry despite the 48oz of sauce (and I prefer less sauce as a rule) and devoid of flavor. My college aged son and I perused many ziti recipes and zeroed in on this one r/t revues.  Onto the ziti recipe with provolone and or the mixed Italian cheeses.

This recipe is very good. Like everyone who enjoys to cook, I made little changes to make it my own, but this recipe will stand on it own. This makes a huge amount; it freezes well. There are only two of us, so we had dinner, then froze the rest for a quick meal here and there. It was nice to have something other than a plain old sandwich for lunch at work.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  My family absolutely loved it.  I used ground beef instead of sausage and changed the serving size.  This is something that I will make again and again.

Outstanding, exactly what I was hoping for.  Had family over and was nervous for making it the first time since they all have different tastes. Everyone loved it including me.  Definitely a keeper, will be adding this to my favorites.  I found a recipe here Best Marinara Yet, now I always make my sauce by this recipe(plus add 1 can tomato paste).  I always read the reviews which make this site unique and the best. So I took the advice and used Turkey Italian Sausage instead, sauteed 1 diced onion, 2 cloves chopped garlic, and 1/2 a red pepper with the sausage.  I also added a light coat of shredded parmesan cheese. Served with a garden salad and Garlic Bread.  Could not be more pleased.  Thank you very much!

Very good Ziti, make sure you dont add any extra pasta, it will dry it out especially when your reheating left overs. I like it creamy and cheesy and usually cook ziti, and lasagna then let it cool then reheat it again to serve. The flavor is always better second time around.

Could have used more sauce for my taste; a bit dry.  Will make note of that and do next time.Did like the addition of ricotta; never used in baked ziti before.  I did add cayenne because we like hot foods.  Thanks for a good recipe.

The title says it all!! I made it plain and with no meat as I was serving a crowd of 12, one of which was vegetarian but next time when I make it for myself and the hubby, I'll add all the vegies we love like mushrooms, onion, bell pepper and also more spices and italian sausage! Nice, fast, easy and flexible! Certainly a crowd pleaser! Thanks!

Turned out amazing!! Works best with fresh Italian sausage from your local butcher. Also, sprinkle the basil on top of the cheese right before baking. Adds a great flavor surprise.

Enjoyed this recipe the first day.  Made two batches.  In one I followed the recipe and in the second I substituted the meat with raw zucchini thinly sliced (for my vegetarian daughter).  Both recipes were a hit with the kids the first day but they did not enjoy it reheated on a second day.  My suggestion, just make enough for one day.

I make this all the time and people rave about it.  The only thing I do differently is I use Sweet Italian Sausage and Sweet Basil Sauce so that I don't need to put basil in the sauce and warm it up.  It helps with time.  I have even layered differently.  You just can't mess this up!

This was excellent. I made it for a group of five and people were having second and third helpings. There really isn't that much left over today, about 5 servings. I followed the recipe for the most part but I was missing basil. I used wheat penne pasta with garlic & cheese sausage. I also added some sauted onions & garlic with the sausage. Spiced it up with white pepper, onion powder, & red pepper flakes. I used extra cheese and I did not heat my sauce first. I cooked it for the full amouont of time. To prevent the cheese from burning I used tin foil and removed during the last 15 minutes.

This recipe is quick and easy and the ingredients are simple yet the recipe can easily be modified to your taste by adding other ingredients and spices.   My kids age 15,6,2, and 1 LOVED IT!!  I also think this recipe would make a good cover dish.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made this recipe last night and I regret not sauteing a large onion and some garlic, to add to the mixture.  We definiately missed those flavors. Also, more flavorful sausage would have helped.

My kids LOVED this recipe!  They are currently arguing about how many stars to give it - now it is up to 100!

This is delicious. I made several substitutions: rigatoni in place of ziti (only because the store was out of ziti!); lean turkey meat for sausage; part-skim ricotta; an Italian blend of cheeses (instead of only using mozzarella); 2 cloves of garlic; and half a green pepper. This is a hearty dish! I'm going to have leftovers for a couple of nights!

Love this recipe! I included it in my 'buffet table foods' for our Family Holiday Gathering last year.  Will definitely use it again.  For years Lasagna was in its place, but this beats that in ease of making and the taste was just as good.  No one complained that the Lasagna was missing as they had in the past when it was replace with another pasta dish.

The whole family really enjoyed this. I am a little embarrased to say that I didn't use ziti pasta, thought I had some but didn't. I added half a container of cottage cheese to the ricotta cheese mixture, I'm glad that I did because the recipe only calls for 12 oz of ricotta. My container was 15 oz and I added atleast 8 oz of cottage cheese and I could have used more of the mixture. I used italian seasoning II from this site. Great meal will make again. Thank you.

This was so good, we really enjoyed it.  I bought a huge can of Hunts sauce, found the sausage on sale for 99 cents and the cheese was on sale also so it turned out to be a really inexpensive meal.  I'll probably have to freeze half because it makes so much.  I threw in half a red diced red onion just because it was on its last legs and I wanted to use it up.  Very yummy meal and this will be my go to ziti recipe from now on!!!

Very good!  I used whole wheat pasta and italian turkey sausage.  I mixed the pasta, sausage, and marinara together.  I added carmelized onions and garlic to the ricotta.  I placed one layer of the meat/marinara mixture on the bottom of the dish, then added all of the ricotta/onion mixture, a layer of cheese, a second layer of marina/meat mixture, and topped it with more cheese.  Tres bien!

If I could give it 4 1/2 stars I would..I think the flavor would be slightly better with a homemade sauce versus the jar sauce.  Also, the spices perhaps could use a bit of tweeking..but all in all everyone loved it and made tons for leftovers..even better the second and third days.

This recipe makes a lot of food and was very easy to make! It tasted pretty good, too! My boyfriend loved it!! I couldn't find ricotta in a 12oz size, so I bought the 15oz. I also used 12oz of shredded mozzarella and 4oz of shredded sharp cheddar cheese because I love cheddar! I think the next time I make this, I will find a more flavorful marinara sauce or add extra spices!

I used a flavored marinara which I will not do next time.  Sticking with a plain marinara is best.

Delicious! I made it vegetarian with Gimme Lean fake sausage rather than real sausage, and it was pretty good that way, but of course most meat substitutes are less flavorful (in my experience of cooking for my vegetarian roommate). So I added some red pepper flakes to give it a little more kick, which helped a lot. Once I added real sausage to what I was eating, though, it made a huge difference! Good with fake sausage, but even yummier with real sausage!  And yes, it does make a TON of food - we'll be eating it for a week straight.

Not enough cheese. I was dry. And layering the ingredients made it very un-uniform, some taste here, no taster there. I'd combine the ingredients first, then spread sauce over the top.

This was excellent! Due to other reviewers comments on quantity, I halved some of the ingredients since it's just me and my husband. Used 12 oz of pasta, only 1 jar of spaghetti sauce (we dont care for marinara), but still used 1 lb of sausage and a full container of ricotta and mozzarella. Baked in a large oval Corningware instead of 9x13. I also included some grated parmesan in the ricotta mixture, as well as some on top. It really turned out wonderful and is soooo much easier than making lasagna! I will definitely make this again.

This was ok, but seemed dry.  There was not enough sauce for me.  Maybe I will make again with a my own homemade marinara sauce and I will definitely add more.

Lives up to the name!  I made an oval 9x13 dish and a 8x8 dish to freeze.  Used ground turkey and fat free ricotta cheese and Prego traditional pasta sauce.  Used Barilla whole grain penne pasta and my husband and 19 month old loved every bite! Served with Pillsbury italian bread.Yumm-o!

I made this over the weekend along with another recipe from here for my 34 year old daughter's birthday. She loves Italian food and said her dinner was better than Maggiano's, an Italian restauant in Richmond, VA. That was a great compliment to me and the recipe. Thanks so much! My young grandchildren loved this and at times they are picky eaters, ages 3&2. This dish served 8 people. I will be using this recipe again. I used Bertoli's spaghetti sauce, didn't have time to make my homemade and it was delicious! Thanks for the recipe!!! You made my Italian family dinner a hit!!

Number of servings would actually be more like 10-12.  This would also affect the nutrition summary of course (thank God!).  Very yummy but 'dirties' quite a few pots, pans, bowls, etc.  No problem; I asked my adult children to clean up afterward and they did.  Yeahhh!

this was so tasty! i really liked the flavors. i had fresh basil and roma tomatoes from my garden to use in the jarred sauce. i use ragu traditional. no kidding about the amount!!! i didn't read the reviews first and this would have fed 10 with leftovers. it almost wouldn't fit in my 9x13 but it didn't run over at all which was nice.
i had no sausage so used frozen meatballs.
next time i'd use about 12 oz. noodles and 15 oz ricotta. is versatile, could add mushrooms etc. if wanted.

This is VERY good and pretty easy too!  I added a little more spice but over all, it was wonderful.

I'm not sure how this serves just 4 people....unless they are three-hundred pound linebackers!!  Definitely cut it in half or even half of that!

This is pretty good but, as usual, I made substitutions. I didn't have sausage so used hamburger, substituted cottage cheese in lieu of ricotta cheese and used only one jar of Ragu sauce, which made it too moist, even then. Also, added some minced and sauted onions and garlic. I'll have more than enough to share with several of my neighbors who aren't vegans and some to freeze.

This dish is a large meal!  Especially for the 4 of us.  I should have cooked the pasta to al-dente instead of the time amount for the pasta, because 45 minutes later my noodles were over cooked and the dish was a little on the dry side.

This was an okay ziti recipe, although next time I plan on trying a new recipe.  I combined the advice of several reviewers - used a combo. of ground beef and Italian sausage, added minced garlic and onion to the meat sauce and topped it with Parmesean cheese.  I didn't care for the Italian seasoning sprinkled on top...the seasoning stood out too much.

I have five picky children and a picky husband, and only one of the children didn't want seconds. This recipe was DELICIOUS! I didn't change anything (I used a little less sauce than called for, but not much). Be sure to use a large baking dish...mine almost wasn't big enough. This would be a great recipe to take to a potluck...it does make a lot, but I'll make the same amount next time...the kids and hubby will eat most of it :).

I have never had Zita before and will not make it again.  I found it lacking in flavor though it did look really good.  I used Ragu, italian sausage, and everything else that the recipe called for.  I thought it would taste more like lasania.

We loved this recipe and had the leftovers again tonight. I added some diced onion in with the sausage while it was browning. Also, threw in some diced proscuitto. Added more ricotta and didn't even bother to measure the mozzarella. Great tasting meal. Cannot wait to make this again.

This was the quickest, easiest, tastiest pasta bake.  My husband made 4 trays of it for our wedding reception and there was only 1 left and everyone was fighting over who would take it home.  A big hit...thank you.

I love this but with a few changes.  One bottle of sauce I found to be plenty as another reviewer also stated and I omitted the Italian seasoning in the ricotta and mixed in an egg and added fresh garlic to the sauce.  It was very good even with Turkey Italian sausage and reduced fat ricotta and mozzarella.  I have made this twice now and it's become a favorite.  I also found it makes 8 servings, not 4. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good. One jar of sauce is plenty, I added minced onion and garlic to the sausage when I sauteed it. Even the kids liked it. This will be something I make regularly. I also sub'd with fat free mozarella cheese and low fat ricotta. It was still really good.  Thanks.

This recipe was excellent! It was easy to make,even a picky eater here liked it. I did add a large can of diced tomatoes, just because we like those. I think it would have been ok without them. Also I mixed the cheeses together and simply put them in together.I used 1/2 lb. ground Italian sausage and 1/2 lb. ground beef(what I had). I will make this again soon. Definitely a favorite!!

Very good!  I changed a few things.  Instead of two jars of tomato sauce, I only used 1 1/2 cans in the ziti and served the rest on the side in case I wanted to spoon a little more on my plate.  I also used turkey italian sausage (my fiance doesn't like pork) and added a thick layer of mozzarella on top, sprinkled parmesan over it, and topped with parsley.  It was deliciious!

I really enjoyed this dish but it didn't say what to do with the sausage after saying to crumble it and set it aside,so I almost forgot about it.  I just added it to the sauce and it tasted fine.  I couldn't get my kids to eat it but they are picky 2 and 4 year olds.

Recipe is spot on! Don't budget or skimp on ingredients. Whole milk cheese,  brand name.  Raos marinara sauce.  It can get expensive but there's no substitute to quality ingredients

I made this last week for my husband and 2 adult sons. It was “just okay” according to them. It was a little bland but that may have been the brand of marinara sauce that I used. I did add 1/2 pound of ground beef with the sausage because my family thinks it is not a meal without meat. I will probably make it again but try a few changes of ingredients.

This was OK. I would recommend cooking for much less time, as approximately 30 minutes in the cheese was melted and burned at the edges.  In my opinion, there was too much Italian seasoning, but my parents thought it was good.

Thank You for this recipe!! I love the Italian Sausage in this recipe. I have always mixed the Italian Sausage with Ground Beef in Ziti and Spaghetti. I have since stopped using Ground Beef all together and just use Italian Sausage. This is a fantastic recipe and I wouldn't change anything.

Very few ingredients which made it so convenient and it was super delicious!  I used only about a 3/4 C of mozzarella so it wouldnt get too greasy!

This is a great ziti recipe! Everyone liked it, even my  Asian wife who is picky when it comes to pasta dishes. It will definitely be added to our rotation.

I love baked Ziti! I have made this many times and I don't think I would make any changes to it. It's a nice meal to make on any day. My kids like it too which is a bonus! :) :) This is a VERY good food!

Changed only the type of sauce and it was so good, I had very little to take home after a pot luck of a few people! I think it depends on the sauce you use whether the taste is good. I used 1 jar  of tomato and basil and 1 jar of olive oil and garlic - Bertolli. Also, if you like the hot sausage you may want to try that. I prefer the mild so the taste was perfect! I have made it three times now and always get rave reviews!

There isn’t much room to change ziti recipes as I find them all similar    I did find it not necessary to preheat the sauce   I would say that this recipe makes enough for 10 vs the stated 8 servings

Mixed ricotta with sour cream. Boiled the noodles and gave them one minute less on the stove so they were slightlly undercooked when they went into the pan. Covered it in foil and baked 40 min. Added some fennel seeds. Perfect!

I teach Nursing and this is one of my "go-to" recipes for the Pot-Lucks my students have a few times a year! It's delicious, moist and the flavor is wonderful! I double the recipe to feed them all and it's always completely gone. I do however add  more of the spices called for when I double the recipe! Feeds a lot of people and I always have people asking for the recipe. Thanks for sharing it!

Fantastic ziti! I'm not a bit ziti fan but was looking for a new recipe I could pull together for my family. Makes a huge amount and is great for leftovers. I also recommend for potluck or party - it will go a long way!

I used a combination of ground mild Italian sausage & ground Italian turkey sausage. I added cracked pepper & garlic to add a little more flavor (after reading reviews). I also added Mexican blend cheese to the mozzarella. It was very flavorful & made enough so that after dinner I was able to freeze 2 meals. It freezes very well.

I made this with ground turkey (cooked with salt, pepper, and basil for flavor) instead of sausage and whole wheat pasta (personal preferences) and mixed it all instead of layering and then topped with the cheese and spices at the end. It turned out great!

Very tasty. The thing I would change next time is make sure to use a large yellow onion instead of the enormous one I used making the dish too oniony. 

Maybe it should be measured by cups of instead of a single onion. I also don't think I used the proper amount of sauce as I read the instructions to mean a total of 24oz. Still am not sure which is correct. 

I'd also add a little more Italian sausage next time. Really good considering all the mistakes I made along the way.

my family loved this recipe. I had leftover bison meat, so I added that into the sauce, included a whole yellow diced onion, and thinly sliced the sausage. Because I didn't have all the spices except garlic, I salted the sauce layer. Next time, I will add a small amount of red wine just for flavoring. Even without, recipe is easy to make and delicious with salad and crusty bread.

Always a favorite. I get rid of compliments from friends and family. Also a great mask to make ahead and freeze.  I double the amount of spaghetti sauce used and it comes out perfect. It also makes 2 9x13 pans for me.

I was really excited to try this recipe, but I was so disappointed. The ricotta didn't mix/cook well, and I didn't feel there was enough sauce, mozzarella, or sausage. Too much Ziti. Very disappointing.

Delicious!!! Kids && husband loved it!! Used 1 1/2 boxes of ziti, 2lbs beef, 1 lb ground mild   Italian sausage, 32 oz of ricotta cheese. Shredded mozzarella & provolone mix, shredded sharp cheddar and seasoned meat before cooking. Other than that everything else was the same lol. I loved layering every ingredient instead of mixing them. Tasted much better ?? ?????? ??

This was really, really good. My dad used to always make this when I was little, but he would put the noodles in raw and let them cook in the oven. I like this version better. It is faster and still delicious! It benefits to use a high quality tomato sauce. It makes it that much better. Great recipe:)

We didn't care for it.  Too dry, to plain.  We even used Hot Italian Sausage and an extra 1/2 cup of water.  Not for us.

Fab!  Instead of using "off the shelf" marinara I made my own basil marinara sauce. Everything else was the same.   I mixed the sausage into the sauce after browning it and added all spices to the sauce.  It DOES make A LOT!  That is what freezer containers are for!

This was okay, but did not wow me.  The ricotta was a little bit much and I didn't think it had a ton of flavor.

Great recipe! EASY to make. The only change I made was to add a cup of sour cream to the ricotta.  It turned out fantastic! Does make a lot of Ziti.

By far the best Ziti as the title says. I made my own version using no meat as I'm a vegetarian. I used Cheddar cheese instead of Mozzarella, I got great reviews from my family on this, a most make again meal.

This recipe was huge!  I made it with whole wheat pasta and I made a homemade marinara (tomato sauce, water, garlic, and a variety of herbs) rather than using store bought marinara.  It turned out great!

I wouldn't go so far as to say "best ever", but good enough... sauce is too bland... needs a little jazzing up.  I used Pre-cooked meatballs from Costco in mine... the meatballs were the best part.  Will probably make again, but not without modifying.

this was very very good! i used extra lean hamburger instead of sausage (i'm sure it tastes way better with the sausage, but we are trying to cut fat out of our diet) but everything else i followed exactly. my kids loved it!

Really good.  And like almost every other review mentions, it makes a ton.  I made one pan this evening and froze the rest.  So for two people, I think this recipe makes 7 or 8 meals.  Can't beat that!  I didn't have italian seasoning so used basil, oregano, and a garlic mix instead (lots of garlic for me).  I mixed the sausage in with the ricotta but had a little difficulty spreading the mixture over the pasta; it tended to clump rather than spread evenly.  It all turned out fine after baking.  Personally, I think it could have used a little more sauce so perhaps I will adjust the proportions next time (i.e. slightly less pasta). I really liked the browned cheese so I'd recommend the original oven time of 40-45 minutes.  This goes very nicely with red Zinfandel and italian bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was an amazing ziti, but it could be much easier if you just layer everything in the pan and then bake it. There were so many dishes!!! Also, there's no way this will cook for 45 mins without burning the cheese. I left it in for 20 and it was fine.

Me and my boyfriend loved this recipe. We couldn´t find italian sausage though so we used danish sausage instead which tasted good. Also, I made the recipe just for two but there were a whole lot of leftovers.

This was so good!  Everyone is right - it does make A LOT!  I used ground beef instead of sausage and added a cut up onion and garlic to the meat while browning.  I also used a tomato sauce with mushrooms and garlic.  I ended with mozz. cheese instead of sauce.  Also, added some italian spices to the meat. Wound up cooking for 35 minutes.

I used turkey sausage, whole wheat pasta and 2% cheese. It turned out great.  My husband, 3 year old and 1.5 year old ate it up!  It does make a TON.  I might think about reducing it to 1/2 next time.  I might freeze some.

Very good!  I used Hot Turkey Sausage and used 1.5 lbs of it.  My house almost always believes the meat should be doubled in recipes.  I agree with another reviewer that you don't need to heat the marinara sauce.  Also used the broiler for the last two minutes to give a great color.

This recipe is great!  I did make a few changes.  I added fresh garlic to the sauce and I use spicy country sausage.  All my friend go back for seconds and thirds!  Enjoy!

Very good flavor, but my pasta absorbed the sauce a little too much, it got dried out.  I wouldn't put in the whole pound of pasta the next time I made this.  Otherwise, Great!

It was very easy and made a lot of food! Very moist! I omitted the sausage because my family doesn't like it, but it was still very good anyway.  Next time I will be putting in meatballs.

I made this dish last night for supper and it was ok.  I halved the ingredients and it was more than enough to serve 4 people. The only change I made was to saute a small onion along with 2 chopped cloves of garlic along with the sausage.  If I were to make this dish again, I would increase the amount of ricotta cheese as we found the flavour was lost amongst the other stronger flavours.

Thanks for the great recipe. This was so easy and really tasty. I omitted the ricotta and added italian olives and fresh parm. I took it to a birthday bbq and even the kids ate it.

I liked the ziti recipe, but I had to give it more color so I added broccoli in the mix and a few eggs to keep it moist.  The ziti was awesome!

this was a very good recipe.  instead of crumbled sausage, i used sweet italian links.  i changed the serving size for 8 adults and wound up with 2 pans, or enough food for a large football team, and that was with seconds for most of us!  the only thing i would change would be adding another jar of sauce.  it wasn't terribly dry, but i like sauce.

SO GOOD!!! I made this baked ziti using my own gravy (spagetti sauce) and leftover pasta - and my roommate said it was the best dinner i've ever made! I followed the directions almost exactly - i thought it added extra flavor when frying the sausage with onions and garlic cloves - also make sure to cut your sausage into real small pieces.  It didnt come out dry at all & mine was plenty spicy b/c I make my gravy with a lot of red pepper flakes!  You cant really go wrong, just follow the recipe and make sure to use plenty of sauce and LOTS OF CHEESE!!! (italian seasoning on top of the mozzeralla - great touch!!!)

This was pretty good.  I used my homemade sausage spaghetti sauce and didn't do additional sausage.  I wasn't sure how much sauce I had, but it was probably a little over one jar and it worked well- could have used a little more but I think 2 jars would be too much.  I used a bag of Trader Joe's whole wheat penne and lowfat riccotta (15 oz).  It was hard to spread the ricotta so I just put it on in small dabs and tried to do it evenly.  And the other reviewers are right- this is more like 6-8 servings, NOT 4!

Baked ziti is one of those classic meals and this is a basic, but good version of it. I made it to show my boyfriend its wonders and he loves it. I used medium shell pasta the first time and have used ground turkey instead of the sausage every time. Easy to prepare and makes for good leftovers.
