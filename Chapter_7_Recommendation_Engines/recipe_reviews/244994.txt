I made this from fresh sweet potatoes cut long pieces. I did not measure the margarine I put in. I just spread enough to keep the sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg (not as the much as the sugar or cinnamon)in place as I added it.  I did this in layers. The time was perfect but when I added  the marshmallows I let them stay a bit too long and they completed melted throughout the pot by it still came out delicious.

I've made these every year using a conventional stove, but this year there's a limited amount of oven space at our friend's house so I decided to use a slow cooker. I always get rave reviews on my yams, but my secret is I add chopped pecans... They add great flavor and break up the mushy consistency!

These simple sweet potatoes turned out great! I could go half on the marshmallow and still be happy. These are definitely for someone that prefers a sweet sweet potato. Will make again for sure.

This was excellent and perfect for making during the busy day on Thanksgiving recently. I was amazed that the youngest of my guests (age 5 -10) loved it and ate something they swore they hated. The marshmallows were the allure; the taste had them eating seconds!

Made it with 3 fresh yams (peeled and sliced) and skipped the marshmallows. It was the favorite side dish for all! Will be making again, and not just on Thanksgiving.

To me, it tastes just like my Grandmother made it, right from the oven, only I used my Slow Cooker/Crock Pot (7 qt) ! It's super easy & it frees-up my oven for more for other items. I'm so happy I came across this recipe! It is now the only one I use when I fix Candied Sweet Potatoes/Yams!! :) 

**My advice is to use a "Slow-Cooker Plastic Liner"! By using that, clean-up is a breeze!!  I've got a big Family & this recipe is perfect!!
