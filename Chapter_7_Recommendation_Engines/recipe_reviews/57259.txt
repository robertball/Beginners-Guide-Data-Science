I make something similar to this, but it is way to sweet for adults this way, I cut it with more water and then make it nice and spicey by adding some ground cinnamon and even a little cayenne pepper, some allspice makes a nice addition as well. I love using the slow cooker to make it, the best idea ever! The house smells so good for hours after it's all gone.

This must be a mistake- 60 cloves and 2 whole oranges in 3 1/2 cups of water?  It must have been a typo- 3 1/2 quarts or liters sounds a bit more realistic

My recipe: 2 quarts of apple cider (or 1 bottle of apple juice), 2 cinnamon sticks, 5-10 cloves, and if its an adult party, 2 cups of Captain Morgan's- throw it in the slow cooker so you don't have to tend to it, creates a nice aroma throughout the house

I like this recipe because I am able to get all of the ingredients where I live.  We don't have apple juice concentrate, so I just fill my slow cooker with apple juice and then add the rest oranges, cloves, and cinnamon.  We think it's very tasty, and it makes the house smell good.

This recipe did not yield the quantity i expected nor the flavor. Had to cook an extra long time to get hte cinnamon flavor into the mix and by then there was only 1/2 a gallon even though i doubled the ingredients.
