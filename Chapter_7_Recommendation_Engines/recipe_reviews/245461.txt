Delicious, easy recipe. I put all of the potatoes in one foil packet making sure there was an air hole in the top to allow steam to escape and put it on the grill instead of the oven.  Then I topped it with white cheddar (you could just use your favorite) and the herbs. Great use of fingerling potatoes and no mess using the foil!

Very tasty. My guys want me to make it again. I did leave the cheese off half the recipe because of a dairy allergy and used olive oil instead of butter. I liked the fresh herbs.

Oh yeah these are awesome. My husband usually roasts them open faced, and I find they're dry every time. This recipe keeps the moisture in. Then they toast perfectly on broil with the cheese. I used asiago and mozzarella cheese for extra gooeyness
