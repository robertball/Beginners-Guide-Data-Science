This was a very good recipe.  There is a strong lemon flavor, but it was not overpowering.  I followed the recipe to the letter for the most part, but when I was getting ready to cook the chicken, I realized that I forgot to put the oregano in the brine.  Oops!  

When the cooking time was done, the chicken looked a little too white for me and since I like crisp skin, I decided to broil the chicken.  I broiled it for about 5 minutes and I achieved what I wanted.

To keep my carb count down, I substituted one tablespoon of corn starch for the flour in the sauce.  

Armando, my better half (?) rated this recipe a 9 out of ten.  He does not rate very many meals this high.  All in all, a very good dinner that will grace my kitchen table again.

Awesome and easy recipe! My family lived the flavor and the easy mushroom gravy can easily be used for other meats. We served this with garlic mashed potatoes and a vegetable. Will definitely make again.

Perfect! Easy and flavorful! Great recipe to serve when expecting company for dinner!
One  Suggestion:  Toward the end of baking, if you move the lemon slices that have been covering the chicken thighs (keep them with the chicken in the baking dish, but not on top), then baste each thigh with the pan juices and bake another five minutes or so, you end up with rich golden brown crispy skin that not only looks better, but tastes better too!

(Because I'm on a low sodium diet, I omitted the salt entirely, used a little more garlic powder than the recipe called for (I didn't have "rosemary garlic seasoning" so I used rosemary and garlic powder combined) and marinated the chicken overnight. Between the lemon juice , seasoning, herbs, and long marinating time, it still had enough flavor (for me at least) without even needing the salt.)

I made this exactly per the recipe, and it was good. It was lemony, but not overpowering, and the other spices were fine too.  Just no wow factor, and while satisfying, I would not say that it's delicious.  I discarded the marinade, as indicated.  There was no indication of whether to bake covered or uncovered, so I covered my baking pan with aluminum foil.  There was about a half cup of liquid pan drippings when it was done, and I made the mistake of using the pan drippings to steam the kale in my vegetable side dish... this made the kale way to salty and lemony, and ruined it (I was able to salvage it by rinsing it and reheating it in the microwave, but it wasn't edible without doing this).  So I recommend making sure you drain the chicken well and throw out the pan drippings.  And if you don't cook covered, you likely won't have any pan drippings and all that salt that doesn't wash off the chicken will likely make it too salty, so it probably either needs to be baked covered or have some water added to insure there is sufficient liquid to remove some of the salt from the chicken.  While good enough to enjoy once, this recipe just isn't one that merits trying again.

We made this tonight, it was very good, a little heavy on the salt though so you may want to use half the amount.

Absolutely great recipe. I didn't have onion powder so I added minced onion. I wonder if shallots would have been a better choice. I'll for sure make thins again.

I made it exactly as written and it was very good.  The next time I will probably reduce the amount of oregano as I personally do not care for its flavor and would rather not "taste" the oregano in a dish.  You can make the chicken without the mushroom gravy and it has a unique flavor.  The addition of the gravy completely changes the flavor of the chicken.  The mushroom gravy is so good you might want to eat it with a spoon.

Pretty tasty... the lemon makes to taste fresh. I used much less salt and butter than suggested, and added spinach to the sauce as it was thickening for extra veggies. I also broiled it for 4 minutes so the skin would turn golden (also made the lemons on top nice and charred). makes a great light meal!
