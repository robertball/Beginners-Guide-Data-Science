These were so great.  My husband loves his mothers potato pancakes,  but will never let me make them for him because he's such a health nut.  Sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes and plain yogurt instead of sour cream make these even better than the regular ones for us.  The cilantro and lime really add a nice flavor that I never would have thought of.  Will continue to make these always.  Thanks!

My processor is broken so I grated the potato and just chopped the onion by hand, just like making a regular potato pancake. The sauce complements the pancakes well. I found it hard to shape the pancakes, but I might have used too much potato...I ended up adding another egg to the mixture.

The yogurt sauce is great! It works well with either cilantro or mint.  The sweet potato pancakes are really like sweet potato hash browns, and taste wonderful!

These didn't have that much flavor. The sauce wasn't good either. Just tasted like plain yogurt.
