Very good. Customizable easy and delish.

Notes on batter frying.  let the flour rest in the batter at least 20 minutes in the fridge. Half the comments about bland and floury probably are eliminated by letting it rest - almost any time you add a fat or liquid to flour you want to let it set. (and baking powder, not Soda - PLEASE)

MAKER SURE to get the excess batter off, let it drain, shake it...whatever. Batter is not like flour-egg-flour. It'll be too much if you just batter it and drop it into the fryer. If you want season either season the batter (not the dredging flour) or sprinkle you Paul Prudhomme or what have you IMMEDIATELY after it comes out of the oil and no one will say bland again (that way you can also season separately for kids and adults). 

I used thighs because chix breats have no flavour and it worked fine. If the chicken isn't cooking, wrap it in foil and bake for 5-10 minutes...it'll be just fine.

Great and easy recipe for batter fried that can be changed for your taste

The recipe was very easy to follow and was easier to cook.  The only problem was that the batter was bland so I had to spice it up a bit with salt, pepper, more beer and garlic powder.  I will use this recipe again and try different things with it.  Thanks for sharing:)

I like a light batter, and while this one was not quite light enough, I just added a bit more beer to make the batter the consistency I wanted and it worked well.  I also added some Montreal STEAK seasoning to my second batch, which brought the flavor of the chicken out.

This is unfortunately a recipe which I'm rating on this site with which I was not impressed.  I had high expectations for this and it turned out anything but what I expected.  The "beer" part of it seemed inviting, however it was a LOT of MESSY work and after frying, the coating came out very dry and bland.  The coating wouldn't cook through for the life of it so it took a really long time.  It quickly became a leftover to the next day and at that point when I microwaved it, it just became soggy and gross so I had to throw it out... Not really worth the hassle with the mess, when I could have made another chicken recipe faster, better tasting and generally more worth my time :-(.... Don't think I'll be trying this again.

I have been using this recipe for a few months and it is something both my husband and I enjoy and the leftover batter is just enough for a side of fried mushrooms.  However, we always add salt, pepper, and a little garlic powder to the 1/2 cup of flour used for dredging, and usually end up using about 3/4ths of a cup of beer.

If I made this recipe again I would add at least salt if not pepper to the flour.  The flavor was kind of bland.  The batter was not crunchy but I think that was me not the recipe.  I think the oil has to be the right temp. to get it crunchy.  I would make it again and try different temp's for the oil.

I took the advice of other reviewers and added seasoning. I added Cajun seasoning to both the batter and to the flour mixture. They were really really good. I made these for my picky kids and they totally loved them as did my DH who kept coming in to get more ;)

This recipe was not at all what I thought it would be.  It did not turn out crispy. It was more like soft bread.  It turned out to be a wonderful golden color making you think it would be nice and crispy.  My temperature setting for the oil was accurate and fried for the proper amount of time.  The taste was like eating paper.  There was no taste.  I could add a large amount of seasonings, but I don't think that I will be making this again for fear of wasting more flour, , seasonings, eggs, and beer.  I will stick to my mother's secret method of frying chicken.  It has some wonderful flavors!

I used this batter for shrimp in my Fry Daddy with the additions of garlic and onion powders and cayenne pepper. A nice Asian dipping sauce helped to make this a great appetizer! Thanks Nathan!

I have made this twice and it is great.  However, I did add some hot wing powder to the dredging flour.  Wow!

I am a 15 year old male who loves to cook. I made this recipe (along with baked potatoes and Green Beans) for my family and it was a hit. We had a guest over and he had to take the recipe home to his wife. I went ahead and used a whole can of beer and I let the better set in the fridge for about 15 minutes well I prepared everything else. I also added Garlic Powder and Crushed Red Pepper. The only complaint I have is the amount of oil this recipe calls for. I doubled everything, and I still only needed 2 cups of oil, so I don't see how the original recipe would ever need 3 cups!

the base recipe is perfect. it makes perfect beer battered chicken, but i read that it was bland, so i always add seasonings that i like- to the chicken when in strips, to the flour to dip chicken in, as well as the batter for some kick- i add cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and some seasoning salt. I also add a bit more beer, maybe more like 2/3c than 1/2c.

love this recipe!  i did add more beer to it.  This recipe will come out the way you make it come out if you buy a cheap beer it will not be as flavorful.  I've made this with Sam Adam's beer and also Harpoons IPA.  They have the same batter consistancy as Chinese chicken fingers.  theyre verrry good!

The chicken was very bland.  I had to dip it in barbecue sauce or soy sauce to add flavor.  It was also very messy.

Love this recipe! I have a hard time believing anyone would think these strips would magically season themselves with Flour, Beer, Eggs & baking powder!?! However for the batter texture it was awesome!I can't love this recipe enough! I do add a bit more beer to the batter and I do agree with letting it sit while prepping other food for at least 20-30 minutes. I suppose it should be written in that seasoning your chicken & batter are a given. This recipe can be kicked up or toned down. Honestly any way you could imagine :) We have made it with BBQ rubs, buffalo seasoning, Parm added before batter the list goes on & on. Thanks for sharing!!!!

This was a very easy to follow recipe. However it was bland but i felt it still had a good taste to it. It was just missing something.. So on the remaining batter i added seasoning of my choice and it was really good.

The batter turned out great! The only thing i would change is that it needs seasoning. My husband and I both enjoyed this and he is in the restaurant business. Will will try this again, only kicking it up with some cajun spice. Nice recipe Nathan.

I really have mixed feelings about this recipe. On one hand, it is a good basic recipe which can be easily modified with different seasonings and ingredients, and it is also easy to prepare. However, I felt it was too messy and time consuming and wasn't good enough to replace frozen chicken tenders. I used a combination of beers and also added ALOT of additional seasoning. The taste and consistency of the batter was good, but it made a colossal mess of my deep fryer and took forever. I won't use this recipe again.

Easy recipe! Good results, used old bay and Honey in the batter.  Use a strong beer, light beer leaves no flavor. We used this recipe for catfish, excellent!!!

THIS RECIPE WAS DELICIOUS! I WAS SHOCKED BECAUSE I DO NOT LIKE THE TASTE OF BEER, BUT IT SOMEHOW GAVE A GOOD FLAVOR TO THE CHICKEN. EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY LIKED IT. I DID SPRINKLE THE CHICKEN WITH GARLIC POWDER AND SEASONING SALT FOR AN EXTRA BAM! THANKS NATHAN FOR THE RECIPE. I THINK IT WILL BE A FAVORITE!

Unfortunately, I did not care for this recipe.  It lacked something, was too greasy for my taste, and was time consuming and messy.  On the brighter side, my husband and 5 year old thought it was ok.  Will probably not make this one again.

Quite delicious! I made a few changes: I'm using up leftover turkey & I substituted leftover wine for the beer. And, seeing that turkey tends toward the bland, I put half a teaspoon of salt, ditto paprika, a shake of black pepper &  a dash of Tabasco sauce in the mix. It was light, crisp & delectable: my son wants me to make it again!

as SMPARSONS related....let batter rest....also i like to soak my chicken in salt water for a min of 2 hrs--overnight....this way the chicken can soak up some flavor and also i believe this "cleans" it a little better then just rinsing

This batter is to heavy as is, I thinned it down with more beer in the batter. Added some seasonnings of my own, that made it good.

Real good. Used more beer though, batter was way too thick as per the recipe. Used a deep fryer to fry - 15 mins/basket. Definitely use it again :)

Great fun for the kids.  I put chicken breast sliced into chunks onto bamboo skewers and used the beer batter.  Everyone loved it.

Yes, the method is perfect but I think you drank too much of the beer before you prepared it.  For anyone like me who prefers a crispier portion, try double the beer.  Otherwise a great submission!

I made this the other night but zoned the dredging in flour before battering part.  Also, I added Tabasco and Goya Garlic and Pepper seasoning to the batter. Since I did the beer batter thing on a whim, I had already sliced the chicken into smaller strips and sprinkled with a dry packet of Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing mix and let it sit in the fridge for 8 hours.  It was amazing. On a side note, we are import drinkers so we used a full cup of Molson Golden...yum!

while the beer batter will taste like beer it will never be a beer batter per say depending on the type of beer. victoria bitter or any other cultivated yeast beer will give a greater beer flavour and instant batter but is not correct. coopers brand or sediment beer brewed using live yeasts will enhance the batter and give a much more unique flavour, althought this will take time to set, up to 3-4 hours in a cool dry place. but like we chefs say 'always sacrifice time for flavour'

It needs something to give it some kick.  I haven't quite figured it out but I'm open to suggestions.  Another suggested marinating the chicken.  I love the idea of the beer battered concept, just needs some spice.

I started using this recipe a few months ago but just now getting around to writing a review! :) I use this recipe at least once every two weeks to make sweet and sour chicken. It is excellent! (The sauce I use is Uncle Bill's Sweet and Sour Sauce from this website also)I have a deep fryer and it makes this very quick and simple to make. The chicken tastes really great with the sauce, but it also tastes great on its own. :)

I really liked this recipe.  I did not find it in any way bland.  Probably because it doesn't take much to know if something is going to be too bland for your taste just by looking at the recipe.  I used 1 cup of liquid, a few generous dashes of garlic powder, two dashes of tobasco, and voila...perfect.  I also didn't find the cooking process messy because I us a small deep fryer for this sort of thing.  I put the batter bowl right next to the fryer for no dripping.  It was very easy clean up.  Don't let the bland reviewers discourage you.  Just add some of your fave seasonings, and the tobasco was a great touch.

Fantastic!!  This is the first time I've tried this kind of recipe and it came out restaurant quality!  I used more beer to thin the batter out a little, added some spices, and followed everything that SMPARSONS said on 1/13/05.  Oh, I also only used 1 cup of oil instead of 3.  I don't know if it made it any healthier, but at least I didn't use all that oil needlessly.  Great, thanks!!

I liked this recipe, but found the batter to be very bland.  So I used a pale ale, and a bunch of spices (seasoning salt, pepper, garlic powder, poultry seasoning, red pepper).  Now it's kickin.

I took the advice of one of the other commentors and allowed the battered chicken to rest in flour for 20 minutes in the fridge; they were easy to handle and came out with a thick delicious breading.  I did think the chicken itself was a little bland and next time I will season the chicken before I do the batter dip.

This turned out well. A couple of things we changed was the amount of beer, we upped it to 1c, we also added 2 tablespoons of Old Bay to the liquid batter and just for good measure we added a little Old Bay to the dry flour too. It was good except our beer choice was a little strong but I think it made it better, if I use the same beer I might scale it back to 3/4c. If you do use this as directed it will be bland it needs spice there is just too much FLOUR and flour is bland without anything in it. Also the kind of beer makes a huge DIFFERENCE. I'm sure using something like Pabst is going to make the batter bitter and most wont like it, so its worth getting a higher grade beer not some cheep stuff just because you are cooking with it. Use a beer you like if you like beer, which I don't but I like the beer we got. It was a little oily but what do you expect you are frying in fat, thus the invention called paper towels. I have a bad stomach and can't take much grease but this was tasty, I know I'm going to pay for it though it was worth it. Also you need to keep the oil at a lower temp if you are stove top cooking as it will burn and the inside will not cook all the way through. Cooking at a lower temp is almost always the key to stop things from burning. This might have turned out better in a deep fryer.

This was good, but (I agree) a bit bland and flour-y.  I did what another use suggested and let the ingredients sit in the fridge together, it just comes down to the fact that something is just OFF in this recipe and I can't right it.

this was incredibly bland. I felt like I was making biscuits, not fried chicken. The batter with 1/2 cup beer was SO THICK that it ended up burning before cooking the chicken. After adding almost the whole bottle to make the batter somewhat usable, it still turned out bland and soggy. Not making again.

I used Drakes batter instead of making my own.  After I deep fried the chicken, I heated one stick of butter and two cups of Franks hot sauce then coated the chicken with it.  I also made some in honey bar-b-que sauce.  They are delicious and the whole family loves them!!

Really good. Received rave reviews from my parents. I added some salt, pepper, southwest chiptole seasoning and a tad bit of fresh orange juice to the batter. Would be great batter for fresh fish as well. Great recipe!

Even seasoning up the batter with seasoned salt, garlic salt, black pepper, and onion powder left it a little bland.  The crust got hard in the oil and soggy once it was drained.  For the record, I used water instead of beer, so that could be part of it, but I was looking for more of a restaurant-style chicken tender batter.

Was a very good batter, I do agree it was bland and I did let is sit awhile before using.  All it needed was some black pepper and onion to spice it up.  Thanks!

I liked it! I did add a lot of seasonings and I also added a little hot sauce to the batter like someone had suggested. I think the only thing that this recipe needs is a really good dipping sauce...i served it with sweet & sour sauce and ranch mixed with a little hot sauce. It was good but I think it needs a sauce that will bring out the flavor of the chicken and beer...But all in all I loved the recipe and so did my family!!! thanks.

I've been looking for a recipe like this ... battered chicken tenders like you get at Chili's, not just the breadcrumb kind I had been making at home. And this is it as far as texture! This is good, but as other reviewers said, it definitely needs salt and other seasonings. I put probably a full teaspoon of Lawry's season salt in the flour, but it still wasn't enough. Next time I'll try some in the batter. I floured the chicken in a zip lock bag (easy!), and I had to add at LEAST another half cup, if not more, of liquid to the batter. (I added some water as well as more beer.) After that, it was much easier to cook. It was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. However, a little hard to judge when the chicken is fully cooked. Thanks, Nathan!

I've only made this dish once and I followed instructions exactly the way it was posted. After spending so much time and trouble cooking it, I was not happy with the end result. It was no better than regular breaded chicken. I suggest to anyone who is planning on using this recipe to either marinate the chicken in herbs and adding spices to the batter. Otherwise you'll just end up as disappointed as I was.

We weren't thrilled with this batter at all.  I let the batter rest for about 40 minutes before using it and there was absolutely no flavour to it, even though I added additional spice (some cayenne, seasoning salt etc).  I forgot to flour the chicken before dipping it in the batter, and it turned out just fine...none of the batter fell off. This dish was bland and boring, so I won't be making it again.

This recipe tasted absolutely wonderful.  It was a really nice way to do chicken since I eat it like 3 times a week.  I did forget to cut the chicken into strips, and it still tasted wonderful.  Definetly a winner.  I will be making this again and again.

Pretty quick and easy. Need to add LOTS of spice for the flavor to really come out. My daughter loved it and the breading wasn't very thick. Will use it again.

This recipe was very frustrating.  The batter was extremely thick making it hard to fully cook the chicken.  My husband ended up picking away at the outside to eat the chicken inside...I'll pass on this.

Great recipe, highly reccommend this. The only thing I added was a teaspoon of Paprika and a teaspoon of Lawry's seasoning salt. I had a feeling it would be bland without seasoning (several of the reviewers were commenting on that). This really made a difference. It was delicious!

although this sounds like it would be great it fell a little short for me.i am going to try this again with some tony's cajun seasoning mixed in. i found it to be just too bland and the batter was too mushy not crunchy at all. me being a southern girl i like big flavors and if its fried chicken of any kind i think it should be crunchy. i did try to thicken the batter with a little four but that didn't work well.i think this a great idea but definately not for pickey people like me.

This was just okay for me. Others liked it more than I did, so I gave it four stars instead of three. It really was bland, despite seasoning as soon as I removed it from the oil. If I make this again, I will season the chicken, the flour, and the batter. I did let the batter rest about 30 min. before using.

I followed the recipe almost exactly except i added a whole can of beer and let it sit in the fridge for 30 minutes.  This recipe still turned out very very bland.  I probally wont make it again.

I just made this for my family and I have a picky 2 yr old.  Wow!  I took into consideration the beer amount as some have posted, but otherwise left the recipe untouched and I was not dissappointed.  Yeah, it was a little bland, but I just put a bit of kosher salt on the cooked chicken and served with honey mustard!  Let me say it again, my 2 yr old ate it!

Good recipe!  The texture was perfect.  It needed some spice in the batter, however.  Next time I'll add some seasoning.

This recipe was awesome--easy and delicious, especially after my 12-year-old decided to dump all the chicken pieces into the batter at once and coat them that way.  I was doing them one at a time and laying the batter on a little thick.  Crisp & yummy--will definitely make again!!

This recipe is just too bland. Per previous reviewers, I added pretty much every seasoning I had and it's still missing something.  Will check back to see if anyone comes up with the answer to add some pizzazz...

I've used this recipe twice now..the first time I made it to the tee, and it was BLAH! The second time I made it, I followed everyones advice on putting season in the batter. I still thought it was BLAH. it does have good texture but tastes blah. I might have to stay with the good old Drakes mix from the store. sorry

I found the coating was thick and hard to work with, and also did not have very much taste. Will probably not make again.

Everyone liked this recipe very much.  It was a little messy overall, I suggest putting the flour in a ziplock bag and shaking the chicken with it - to coat it. Like everyone else, I addes tons of spices - I basically just went through the spice cabinet and added anything that seemed like it would help, lol. I would definately make this again :)

The chicken turned out great. It was very crispy, only thing was it was a little bland. I added a teaspoon of salt and pepper, but it still didnt have the flavoring I was looking for. So maybe I'll add some spices next time. But this is the recipe for chicken I have been looking form but unable to find.

This recipe was pretty good.  I did take others suggestions to add spices (garlic salt and italian seasoning) to the dredge flour.  I also added some salt to the badder.  I ended up adding the whole can of beer, but could have added a little less.  The badder could have used more flavoring in it but once they were done, I salted the chicken and then it was fine.  I also, try as I might to make this a little less bad for me by using half whole wheat flour for the badder and then all whole wheat flour for the dredge.

Letting the flour mixture set in the fridge for 20 min is a really good idea. I recommend honey mustard dressing as a dipping sauce.

My Mom always whisked an egg white & put in it. Not beaten a whole egg. The egg white makes it a bit more airy where as the whole egg makes it heavier. Plus I seasoned the batter with whatever seasoning I like.

Because I don't drink beer, I just substituted the beer for water and I added 1 teaspoon of salt to the mixture for flavour. Turned out amazing!

Easy to make but tastes kind of bland. It would be nice if there was a dipping sauce recipe to go with it.

I thought this recipe was easy.  I did add some spices into the batter as other reviews said it was bland and I like my food to be flavored.  I added garlic powder, adobo, italian season and cayenne pepper.  I also served it with sweet n sour dipping sauce which made it even better.  Thanks for the recipe I will be making this again.

I added salt and pepper and this recipe was still not what I expected it to be.  Too bland and took too long to get completely done.  I won't be making this again.

Good jumping off point for some beer battered chicken. One easy modification took it from thick doughy pancake breading to light and airy. DOUBLE THE BEER!

No seasoning but coats the chicken well. This could be a great start. I might try cornmeal next time instead of flour.

I let it sit in fridge for 30 minuets like a comment recommended and it was still very bland and really thick. Do not put this chicken in a basket fryer! The badder fell through the grates and fried onto it with the chicken! It was a mess and not worth it for the quality. Won't be trying this again!

I made this tonight. I'm an amateur cook and I was able to pull it off fairly well. Nice texture to the batter. I did notice comments that suggested that the batter was a bit bland, so I poured in a packet of onion soup mix. Turned out yummy.

It's a little bland. I'll make it again but will definitely try to find some additives for the batter that lend some more flavor.

Followed suggestions of other reviewers by adding seasoned salt to the flour and batter mixture, also a light dusting of seasoned salt after they are cooked. A garlic salit/pepper blend works well

This was pretty good. I did add salt, and garlic salt for flavor. I tried it on one piece without extra seasoning but it was pretty bland. I also added more beer as I like a thinner consistancy. Super easy to mix. Fast and my kids loved it!!

Tasty and easy. I did season the flour with cayenne, garlic, onion, and salt. Also added the seasons to the beer batter with the addition of hot sauce.

Basically add another 30 minutes to it. Yes it is crispy but is is also bland and the batter is too thick. I had to add more beer but still bland! Make sure to add some spices to the batter for flavor!!!

Very good and not too hard. They don't heat up the best in the microwave so I would recommend reheating in the oven.

I made this for the first time ever and my husband devoured it!  I did add a little garlic and onion powder along with season salt to the batter.  I let the batter set in the fridge for about an hour (as previously suggested by another reviewer) and then added paprika and parmesan cheese to the dredging flour.  Cooked up nice and crisp with a nice flavor.  Chicken was nice and juicy.  
I will definitely be making this again.

Was not crispy at all, much like chicken rapped in a pancake. I was extremely disappointed. I don't know if I did something wrong but followed to a T except added some pepper. Very flavorless and soft.

Very little flavor - too much batter.

I do not recommend using Sam Adams Cherry Wheat.  I am going to try this again with a different beer I am sure it will turn out better

This is a good recipe.  I added lemon pepper seasoning and garlic salt to the dry flour mix. You definitely want to shake, rake or something to get some of the batter off as it "puffs" up when it cooks.

the recipe is great! The only problem is you might want to cook the chicken first before you fire it it will go quicker.

The batter for this was horrible, no taste at all , very bland. I was not happy with this at all.

I tried this on whole chicken breasts and it didn't work so well. The crust tasted very floury. I may try it again on chicken strips. I also agree that it might be good on a fish filet.

I rated this as a 4 since my husband liked it even though I did not.  I just didn't like the texture and thought it was bland.

Liked very much. Very simple. The batter was thick but didn't seem heavy after eating, actually light. Probably because I used vegetable oil. Was a little bland but will add spices next time. I have heard that adding cornstarch makes it crispier. Will try that next time and let you know how it works out.

Good texture and easy to make.  It's a little bland, but that's nothing a few spices can't cure.

Perhaps with fish this recipe would have worked better. Although the chicken was tender, the outside was bland and I felt like I was drinking a beer that had the texture of fried chicken.

Thanks Nathan. This was the best beer batter for coating. But it was bland. I will use it again and again adding spices.

We would have liked it better if it had been a lighter batter. It's pretty heavy and thick, even though we thinned it out a bit. We added salt, pepper, onion salt, garlic and celery salt - it was still kind of bland! Maybe some dry soup mix would help flavor it (for those of us who shy away from spicy add-ins like cayenne or chili powder). It was very easy, but we probably won't make this one again, I'll look for something lighter.

Delicious recipe, I decided to make chicken strips instead and it ended up being mostly batter, not enough chicken. If I make this again I'll leave the chicken breasts whole
