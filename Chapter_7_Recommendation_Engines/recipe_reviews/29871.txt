I was a little leery in trying a recipe that only one person had rated so far, but I took my chance.  This is also the first time I made stuffing that was not Stove Top, not to mention that I did it for an Easter party.  EVERYONE like it and took some home with them.  I did use just 1/2 an onion.  My husband said this is a keeper.

Although, the flavor of this dish was lovely, it was a little drier than I would have liked. I recommend adding some chicken stock or butter to make it a little more moist.

This stuffing is so good!  It smells so yummy when I'm cooking it that I can hardly wait to start eating it!  I made it for my in-laws for Thanksgiving and they loved it (even the ones that don't care for oysters).  I've made this a couple times and I find that using a cornbread mix that is not too sweet tastes better.  I also chopped up the oysters into small pieces before cooking them in.  Hands down, the best tasting stuffing I've ever had!

I love oysters and oyster dressing but this dish tastes and smells overwhelmingly fishy.  Also, the combination with cornbread and spicey sausage sounds interesting but does not work...   I would not chose to make it again, but if I did, I would use one can oysters instead of two and not use the oyster liquid but chicken broth instead.

we too LOVED this recipe. wouldn't change a thing. even the brother-in-law who professed to hate oysters enjoyed it. the synergy between the oysters, the spicy sausage and the cornbread was perfection.

I really enjoyed this!  Since I had never tried oysters in dressing before, and I didn't know if everyone coming to dinner would appreciate them, I only used one can.  Everything else combined beautifully, and my guests enjoyed this.  The inclusion of mashed sweet potato was a nice surprise.

This dish was absolutely delicious.  The sweet potatoe gives just a hint of sweetness to the dressing which is refreshing.  We devoured it over thanksgiving.  I think you could actually make this as a main course with some greenbeans or other vegetable.   We'll definitely be making this again.

Oyster stuffing was new to me and my family.  I thought it was all right.  I just prefer the standard cornbread stuffing. However, my family in general was unimpressed.  It is a very colorful dish if you're looking for something eye-catching.

this was just ok...I've never had oyster dressing before so I didn't know exactly what to expect. It wasn't really fishy, but it was rather bland.  I wouldn't make again.

This was my first try at oyster stuffing, and it turned out great!  Even my brother in law, who is very critical over how oysters are done, said it was delicious.  I did not cook the oysters long enough, so I turned the temperature to low and covered - I think the steam helped it to stay very moist.  I will definitely make this again!

This is my go-to dressing recipe now. Excellent texture, color, and taste. Husband is very picky about dressing, but likes this recipe.  I'm now required to make it every thanksgiving.  It's simple to make, so also good for Sunday dinner year-round.

We have this every thanksgiving dinner. Cajun style with spices is the better taste we have experimented and do use spices.

I decided to try this with my family who all love seafood.  It was a great hit!  We served it with our turducken!  We all loved it but I think I will have to update after I make it for my husband's family who are not as adventuous. :)

This was my first time making cornbread dressing with oysters. My cornbread mix was a little on the sweet side. I would make it again using a more savory cornbread mix. So flavorful and delicious.
