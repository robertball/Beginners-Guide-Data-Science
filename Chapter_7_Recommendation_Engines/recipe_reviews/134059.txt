I made this as directed with hot turkey sausage, but did make one small substitution:  1 c diced tomatoes instead of the grape tomatoes since I didn't have any on hand.  I enjoyed this and will make it again.  I used a leaner turkey sausage.  Since the recipe doesn't call for any oil or cooking spray when you brown the sausage or the cook the garlic/onions/peppers, I assumed it was because I was supposed to cook the vegetables in the fat that cooked out of the sausage.  I had no cooked-out fat, so I added a small amount of olive oil to the skillet instead.  This worked out well for me.  In the future, I might grill the sausage outdoors, then slice and add to the vegetable mixture at the end.  Thanks, tiffschrie!

YUM! We all loved this. I used kielbasa but this would be just as good with any type of sausage you prefer. I also used a can of diced tomato because it's all I had, and I didn't have any pimento (I thought I did when I chose this recipe) but I used everything else as how it's written. However because it was kielbasa and didn't need to brown as raw sausage needs to I started everything in the skillet at the same time as I started the rice. I used brown basmati so that takes a while to cook - and everything was so delicious and we will definitely be making this regularly!! Yum!

This is a great recipe, and very quick to throw together if you use whole grain minute rice. The rice takes 5 minutes to cook and tastes great :). I used red peppers because its what I have on hand.

Great wholesome meal. Instead of pomento, I used green olives with pomento and it was wonderful!!!

This is an excellent recipe...especially if you're not too confident in your cooking skills.  It's fast, easy and delicious.  Try adding yellow bell peppers to the mix.  It turned out great for me.

Simple recipe I was able to use with ingredients I had on hand. I didn't add pimento because I didn't have it and used red peppers, but it was still delicious.

This seems to be a pretty forgiving recipe for cooks who are bad at measuring and following directions like me. I ended up using spicy chicken sausage, and used both green and red pepper slices. For the grape tomatoes, I cut them in half. I also chopped up some leftover parsley I had and tossed it in, but I used a lot of red pepper and Cajun spice so I couldn't really tell.

Loved using the brown rice.  Used polish keilbasa for the sausage.  Added jalapenos for some kick.  Really liked this recipe a lot!
