I make these using around 2 cups Biquick, the garlic and cheese with just enough milk to moisten. After they are done I poke holes in the top of each with a large fork like the ones you use to lift a roast and brush on the melted butter. I also add a bit of garlic powder to butter also. I don't use the hot pepper. Very similar to Red Lobster's and great with chili or soup.

Excellent biscuits, but believe it or not, I did not detect the heat from the red pepper flakes.  I will increase the amount of red pepper flakes to 3/4 teaspoon next time to see if that does the trick.  I was out of cheddar cheese and mozarella cheese tasted fine in this recipe.  These biscuits go with so many things, including just about any comfort food.  I served them with "Scrumptious Salisbury Steak in Mushroom Gravy," from the allrecipes.com website.

Very good.  I added a pinch of cayenne pepper for a bit more kick.  My guests gobbled them up.  Very quick and easy - will make again.

My family prefers them without the red peppers.  They are wonderful with pasta and seafood!

These come together very quickly.  I opened a new jar of pepper flakes and we could definitely taste the heat. Didn't change anything.  A good weeknight bread.

I did not detect the pepper as well & will add more next time.  I was out of cheddar & used 1/2 packet Easy Mac dry cheese mix :)Should've used whole packet.  Added parmesan to melted garlic/butter & brushed on.  Tasted wonderful!  Served with spaghetti & salad.  Thanks for a versatile recipe!

Very good! I used buttermilk instead of regular milk. We really enjoyed the zing of the pepper flakes along with the subtle garlic flavor. These went great with our soup and salad tonight. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)
