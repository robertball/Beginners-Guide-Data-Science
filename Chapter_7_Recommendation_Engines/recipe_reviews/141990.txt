I used this as a base recipe and loved it.  Mushrooms were great, I didn't measure anything but know that I used the full cup of white wine or more.  Didn't use the anchovy.  I added prosciutto, artichoke, calamata olives, dried tomatoes in oil and added some of that oil, did more like 3 tbs chopped garlic and 3 scallions chopped.  Put over thin spaghetti...  I added some goat cheese to mine and loved it.  My husband added thin slices of a hard italian cheese.  Will definitely make it again.

Very easy, excellent taste. Great side dish for any number of things. I served it with baked chicken.  I didn't have anchovy stuffed olives so I used green olives but will make it next time as written. I only used one 14 oz can of tomatoes and served it over 1/2 pound of angel hair pasta. I used the quantities of all other ingredients as written. Nice and garlicy.

This IS a fantastic recipe!  I just happened to have most of the ingredients in my pantry so made it during the Superbowl game.  I used olives stuffed with blue cheese instead of anchovy and cut the capers in half which gave it the perfect brine-iness.   I roasted some peppers, zucchini and onions with sweet italian peppers on the side and served it with an italian-style salad and garlic bread.  YUMMY!!!

A very tasty and EASY sauce recipe, however, it was quite salty and I didn't even use the anchove stuffed olives. 
I think that grilled chicken would be a good addition.

This was good, but a rather strange combination of flavors.  Used fettucine as I could not find the pappardelle.  Will not be making this very often.

I thought this was really good and very flavorful.  I will definitely make it again.  I added a cup of evaporated milk and 2 tsp. of corn starch to make the sauce creamy and just a little bit thicker.  It was very good, but I felt it still needed something additional like a flavorful cheese added on top.  I had mozzarella and used that, which was good, but think I'll try feta for next time.  Make sure the wine you use is one that you really like the flavor of because that flavor comes through strong and can dominate the dish.
