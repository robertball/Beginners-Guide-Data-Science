I added pretzels, cheese crackers, and bagel bits with the cereal.  Also put in a tsp. of ceyenne pepper.  Very addictive.  It freezes well, so I made 4 batches, stuck them in the freeze and have a quick snack for company.

I gave this 2 stars because if you don't add anything other than the cereal & taco season, it is BLAH!  By the time other ingredients are added, you may have well just bought a bag of chex mix...

This recipe is fast and easy and tastes yummy.  The first time I made it I only used the corn cereal.  The second time I made it I used equal parts of corn cereal, cheezits, and pretzels.  Wow!  No one can just eat a handful.  It is truely addictive.

Yummy!  I didn't think it could be as good as traditional party mix in just 10 minutes, but it is!!  I have made it with half the mix too, and it was still very tasty.  I also add pretzels.

Very easy and delish, would try adding cheddar cheese crackers and small pretzels for more added flavors!

Good to munch on while we played cards.  I did make some changes, however.  Added bagel bits and tiny pretzels and cut back on cereal squares.  Also I added some cumin, chili powder and garlic powder to the butter mixture.  I baked in 250 deg. oven for an hour.  My whole family loved it!

Yummy!! I added a tsp each of garlic, cumin, & chili powder for extra flavor. Also baked at 250 for 1 hour, like traditional chex mix. Nice change!!
