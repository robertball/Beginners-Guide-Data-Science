These were really good.  I ended up doing a one to one ratio of Italian Sausage and beef since we cut back the number of servings.   We cooked them on the grill and served them on King Hawaiian rolls.  Yummy.  We will make them again.

Had these last night for supper and loved them. Mixed all the meat together so I can't tell you exactly what the ratio was but no one complained. We used the Johnsonville Sweet Italian Sausage. Served them with provolone and marinara sauce on potato rolls.

Yum! I added some spicy mustard to these and some medium cheddar and they were delicious. I would make these again and again. I feel like these would be perfect for any party, as long as it was a house full of meat-eaters.

Ours looked very plain, but to be honest, a pictures was as far as the buns got. No one ate them on the bread! They were ok but not something we'd eat on a regular basis. They tasted more like a breakfast patty. They were good though.

These were yum! I used equal ratios of sausage and ground turkey(93%).  For a good burger while you need the fat from the 80/20 you also need something a bit leaner to mix in. This helps your burgers keep their shape. Too much fat and you will end up with hockey pucks because the burgers shrink. We topped these with cheese and "normal" burger toppings and paired with some Ore Ida sweet potato fries to round out the meal.

I liked the combination of sausage and beef, and I served them on little wheat Hawaiin rolls-they were good

These were wonderful! I live Johnsonville because there sausage tastes so much better than all the others. I followed the recipe as directed and use 80/20 chuck because that's the best ratio for locking in a juicy burger. Will be making these sliders again. Thank you.

These were really good and I can't wait to try them on the grill!  I added cheddar and lettuce along with a little mayo.  I served them on rolls I made, but next time I'll be sure to have them with squishy, soft rolls rather than the heavier ones I used.  C'mon summer.....I want these on the grill.

We really enjoyed Johnsonville's Italian Sausage Sliders. Quick, easy and tasty. Doesn't get much better than that on a busy weeknight! I used Sweet Italian Sausage links because that's all I could find in my area. Yum!

These were absolutely delicious and super easy.  I'm not a big hamburger fan, and this really elevated the hamburger so that I actually enjoyed it.  We topped them with grilled button mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, pickle, ketchup and mayo as desired by each individual,and served them on oat rolls.  Hubby said he might prefer a 50/50 ground beef to sausage mixture, but I liked them just the way they were.  Thanks, Johnsonville for such a great way to bump up the flavor of my burgers!

Fabulous! Added salt and pepper to the meat, but otherwise followed the recipe. Went to a really good grocery store for the fresh, brioche dinner rolls. Perfect bread for sliders. I would definitely use this recipe again, as the sausage/hamburger combination is really flavorful. My friends really enjoyed!

We enjoyed these cooked on the grill and served with potato salad and baked beans.   Next time I will try equal portions of ground beef and Italian sausage.  This recipe did make 8 patties, and I can see making this into a breakfast sandwich using the recipe's 2 to 1 ratio of sausage to ground beef with a slice of cheese on either a slider bun or an English muffin.*****UPDATE 3.10.13--Such a versatile recipe.  Had as a breakfast sandwich today, and it was as good as the sliders last night.

Another great recipe by Johnsonville!  I added an egg, freshly shredded parmesan cheese, and a dash of Worcestershire sauce.  Can't wait to try it again!

These were fantastic. I was surprised they were so quick to make. I've never done sliders because I thought they would take to long. But I had dinner on the table in 40 minutes. Which is great for a busy night. I cooked them on the griddle then finished them in the oven while my fries were baking. Kids loved these and my husband really really loved them. I didn't add any extra seasoning. The Johnsonville sausage takes care of all the flavoring :) Will make these again.

Based on the suggestions from other reviewers I did a 50/50 ratio of Johnsonville sausage and ground beef.   The first burger my husband and I tried with typical burger toppings tomato, lettuce, onion, & pickles.  They were good , but, I thought they had a very strong sausage flavor to me that didn't seem to work with those toppings.  The second burger we tried with mozzarella and some marinara.  That burger was fabulous!   I would definitely recommend, but, experiment with your toppings to see what you like.

These are absolutely fantastic - and SO EASY! The Johnsonville sausage really adds great flavor to the meat and makes a perfect burger or slider. We topped with traditional burger toppings - easy to make your own, add your favorite toppings and enjoy these! Yumm!!

This is such an easy recipe, and the sausage gives these sliders extra flavor. I topped them with pepper jack cheese and grilled onions and then let each person add the condiments of choice. I served them with OreIda Zesty french fries. We would prefer the ratio the other way around with more ground beef than sausage, and I will make them that way next time.

These were absolutely perfect. Add whatever you like on them. These are even good with just the meat and slider bun. Paired with Ore-Ida® Zesty Twirls® makes the perfect meal.

These were great and so easy to make. I used Johnsonville® All Natural Ground Italian Sausage(mild). These were very flavorful... no need to add additional seasoning. I enjoyed mine with a little mild cheddar. Yummy!

Yet another fantastic recipe that the kids enjoyed eating!  No need to add additional seasonings to the meat, the 3-minute-per-side rule was pretty accurate, and overall, what a quick, simple, yet flavorful meal, especially when paired with the "Honey Wheat Sandwich Rolls" from this site!
