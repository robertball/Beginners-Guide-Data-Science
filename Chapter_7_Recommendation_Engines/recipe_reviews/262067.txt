Easy peasy. Turned out pretty good though I used canned mushrooms and cube of chicken bullion. 
Added ground thyme. A good At home Sunday Comfort meal!

I added some thin-sliced steak and used minced garlic from a jar.  My elderly mother has a hard time managing long noodles, so I substituted bow ties. She came back for seconds which is high praise.

Easy and quick to make.  I followed the recipe except cut back on the mushrooms.  I added salt and some beef flavoring and extra onion.  Tasty!

This was really good and so easy to make.  I didn't use the wine but added worchestershire sauce.  Super quick.

Made exactly as stated.   Very bland.  SO really didn't like it and said "does this taste like stroganoff to you?"

My husband and I both liked this. I used a little extra hamburger meat and therefore more garlic, flour, etc.  Iâ€™m looking forward to my leftovers tomorrow!

Made as written and this turned out good. I actually made another similar recipe on the same night. It used red wine instead of white wine. I liked this recipe better. It had a lot more flavor. The one thing I did like better about the other recipe was the addition of peas and carrots in the noodles.
