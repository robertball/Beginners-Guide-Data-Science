I followed the recipe exactly like written and it was a little bland.  It has great potential and I will try it again with more spices - oregano, basil and maybe even some italian seasoning.  I found the panko bread crumbs in the spice & baking needs section of our grocery store (they are japanese - which I didn't know and are a nice twist).

I used canned peeled tomatoes and I added spices like garlic powder and Italian seasoning. This would have been a bit better if I took the time to bake or pan fry breaded zucchini slices before putting them together in the casserole.
