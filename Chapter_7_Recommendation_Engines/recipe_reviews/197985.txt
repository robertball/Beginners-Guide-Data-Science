Warning: This stuff is highly addictive! My store didn't have chocolate chex so i used all rice chex and drizzled both white and semi-sweet melted chocolate over the top. I also added mini-pretzels for some extra salty/sweet flavor. I started chowing down even before i got the chocolate on it though - just the caramel part is awesome! I made this for christmas gifts for coworkers but i'm going to have to make a second batch just for me!

This stuff is to die for if you love carmel.  I make it with 1/2 rice and 1/2 corn chex cereal and do not use the white chocolate glaze.  Sometimes I add some cinnamon for a slight variation.  Can't hardly keep the stuff in the house!!  HIGHLY RECOMEND.

So. Addictive. I used corn Chex because our store does not carry fancy-flavored Chex, and after doing an all Chex batch I did one where I added popcorn and pecans. It was amazing. I also added some cinnamon and the pecans kind of roasted and became like those cinnamon roasted pecans at the fair. Delish.

Love this stuff. I could not find chocolate chex so I used a combination of corn, rice and wheat. I also added 2 cups of pecans and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Next time I will add a full teaspoon of cinnamon for a little more spiciness.This stuff is too addictive...but in a good way:)

This is very good, but looked in three stores and unable to find chocolate chex. So I used cinnamin chex and added cocoa powder.  Yummy...

Delicious and easy! I didn't have chocolate chex, so I used regular rice chex and popcorn. I added in some coconut. Didn't have any vanilla baking chips, but it was still so yummy. I also use this as a super simple carmel corn recipe with popcorn alone. So easy and delicious

Really good base recipe.  I used 1/2 Chocolate Chex and 1/2 Rice Chex.  I used chocolate chips instead of vanilla chips, and wish that I would have either just thrown the whole chips in after the mix was done microwaving, or eliminated them entirely, as it did not drizzle well.  I think this snack would be great if I added some pretzels next time, as I love sweet and salty flavors.

OMG- we got some of this as a Christmas present and it is so addicting I had to beg for the recipe!!!  I could NOT for the life of me find Chocolate Chex anywhere, so I used regular rice chex.  The caramel ALONE is enough to make me eat an entire batch of this stuff!!  I then drizzled equal amounts of white chocolate (couldn't find vanilla) and semi-sweet chocolate chips over the whole batch.  This stuff is TO DIE FOR YUMMY!
*note* I do not use corn syrup, so sub'd with agave nectar.  worked great!

I couldn't find chocolate chex so I used rice as some other reviews stated.  I found this to be very boring. Maybe it would be better with the chocolate chex.
