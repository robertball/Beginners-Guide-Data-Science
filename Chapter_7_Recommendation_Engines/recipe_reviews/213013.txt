I've been making this recipe for 25+ years and it is always a big hit.  Altho we don't like it with the pineapple, we just leave it out.   They just disappear as quick as you put them out.  Try this, you won't be disappointed!

I made this recipe and it was much different from what im used to. I normally use teriyaki sauce instead of soy and vinegar. I like it much better without the pineapple. Ill stick to my old  recipe.

Glad I made it.  I'm always on the lookout for new chicken liver recipes that aren't fried or a pate.  This one did not disappoint.  Although I omitted the pineapple, I made as directed and it was great.

I marinated the liver for 1 hour prior to cooking.  Yummy, yummy and so easy!
