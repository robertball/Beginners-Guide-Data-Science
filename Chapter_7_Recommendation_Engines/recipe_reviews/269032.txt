I was super excited about this recipe, but did not have any luck when I made them. Maybe I used Brie that was not the right type or something, but the cheese just melted when I tried it. I even continued per the directions and it just became super crispy. It made for some great cheese crisps though! Do you have any suggestions for a specific type of Brie that worked for you?

Not sure why they're called puffs because in the video they're actually crisps.

I had no success in getting the Brie to puff. Like others, it just melted.  Disappointing.

The Brie did not puff up, just melted into a puddle of oil.  Donâ€™t wasted expensive Brie making these.  Brie might do better in the oven, but will only make crisps (just as Parmesan does).
