This is a great recipe, I added grilled chicken breast to it to make it a little more filling.  I also added more garlic cloves because I love garlic.

This was easy and very good.  My picky 3 year old loved it!  I added a little extra olive oil before adding the cheese at the end.

I thought this was really boring; I could hardly taste the garlic.
