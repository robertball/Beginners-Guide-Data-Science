Just finished eating these pork chops. The pesto/feta stuffing was great! But I saw other reviews and only used a 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes in the rub. The rub was STILL very hot! I love spicy foods but the heat on the outside of the chop just overpowered the delicious stuffing inside. All I tasted was the spicy rub. It would be better as 2 separate recipes. If I make these again I would either use a thinner chop with just the rub and no stuffing if i'm in the mood for spicy; or omit the rub and just stuff it with the stuffing recipe and brush the outside with some of the pesto. I'd also substitute something for the pine nuts. They didnt seem to add much to the flavor for the amount of money it costs for them.

This was wonderful!  I used a boneless pork chop, flattened it with a meat mallet, rolled it around stuffing and then secured with toothpicks.  I should have reduced the baking time going this route, but everyone still loved it.  I served it with the Gourmet Mushroom Risotto and some asparagus.  I look forward to making it again.

This was great. I used walnut instead of pine nut. Turned out great. The cook time was a little off for me, but my chops were a little small. Over all a great recipe. I'll make it again.

I am frequently looking online for various things to try cooking to give me inspiration on how I can challenge my cooking style. I have never written a review before as I feel the previous reviews often sum up my thoughts. But this required one. While the reviews for this recipe do just that, I had to come on and state what a phenomenal recipe this just is. It had me literally licking my plate at the end wondering when I could make them again.
My fiance said that she would be very happy had she received this dish at our favorite restaurant that we always go to in DC. This is a huge complement as she never dares to compare anything to this restaurant. 

Based off the previous reviews I did reduce my crushed red pepper to ~1/3 Tsp. But it all has to do with your tolerance and desires to spice. Anyways, GREAT RECIPE. Will be making it again soon. Thank you.

I made this for guests the other day and it was a huge hit.  I omitted the pine nuts because I didn't want to go to the store and these were still amazing.  Pesto and feta were made for pork.  You will not be disappointed.

Didn't change a thing. This was so good. The flavors in the stuffing were delicious, and the outside coating was perfect. My husband loved it. I am always looking for different ways to make pork, and will be making this a lot. Cooking time was right on. Nothing I would change.

While the stuffing was a great tasting combination, the seasoning was way too hot and really over-powered the stuffing.  The other thing is, the vinegar left no taste, seeing it just ran right off.  I'm going to try this again another time with half the pepper and red peppers, and use a balsamic "glaze".

The cook time is off, I made these a few times and couldn't seem to get them to not be super dry.. Also, brushing with balsamic vin will not create a glaze, you'd have to make a reduction and brush that on.

I made a variation last night that was amazing. I used chicken instead of pork: I marinated the chicken overnight in a 1:1 olive oil:balsamic vin marinade. I doubled the stuffing and did the dry rub according to the recipe. I cooked the chicken for 25 mins at 375, covered them in foil and let them sit about 10 mins before serving. It was delicious.

Wow!  This is one of the best recipes I've tried on this site.  Amazing combination of flavours.  I changed a few things, as per other comments.  Used a thin, boneless chop, pounded it, rolled stuffing inside, held with toothpick, reduced chile peppers and seared on stove top in butter before putting in oven.  Delicious!!  Thank you for sharing.

I choose not to use any nuts out of respect for the nut intolerant. Turned out great. Only 3 of us sooo We may have to use the toothpicks to fight to the death over last pork chop.

I won a lot of pork chops at a meat draw, and liked the looks of this recipe. I also saw a recipe for Cajun Stuffed Pork Chops at another site and used the idea of tying two pork chops together with the stuffing in the middle (cooking for six). Otherwise I followed this recipe pretty closely. Omitted pine nuts because of an allergy problem here. Also put a few sliced onions under the chops and added a little white wine to the pan. The bottom of the two chops came out very tender and juicy, the top chops not so much. Will remember to turn the chops over to cook in the juices so both are tender and juicy.

Watch your time on this, mine were perfectly cooked at 28 minutes; when served, it was 145 degrees F, just pink in the center of the meat.  If I were to do anything differently, I'd add the balsamic a little sooner and allow the balsamic to glaze more, since that particular flavor is important to this recipe.  Wanted to put the chops in a honey-brine marinade earlier in the day which would have helped tenderize the chop, but time got away from me.  They were a little chewy, but still full of flavor.

Amazeballs! Couldn't find the bone in chops, so I got some without the bone. They weren't thick enough to make the pocket, so I rolled them up and secured with toothpicks as others suggested. I omitted the red pepper flakes, because I don't like heat. Served with couscous and grilled zucchini/squash that I put a coat of olive oil and salt/pepper on. Phenomenal, and done in 45 min. Boyfriend demanded it be added to the weekly rotation.

This was delicious! My mom hates pork and she thought she was eating chicken it was so good! I didn't have pine nuts so I substituted with pecans and that was delicious.

My hubby and I enjoyed this. He said it was a "home run." The only change we both agreed to was 1/4 instead of 1/2t. red pepper. I also forgot to put the balsamic vinegar on and then back in oven so I just used a spash on the chops and mixed it with some of the warm stuffing that oozed out.

These were absolutely delicious!  I went a bit heavy on the red pepper flakes because we like things spicy, and served with wild rice and sauted snow peas.  I will definitely make this again.

This was amazing. Flavor was great. I put all the spices/feta/pesto in a plastic bag with the meat and marianated it for about an hour. I then pan fried them in olive oil using a meat thermometer. I only used 1/4 tsp of the red pepper flakes.

I loved it, although, I did overcook it somewhat. Would go for less then 45 min of cook time next time....but it will vary depending on the thickness of the chops. Hubby didn't care for them, but he can be a fuss, and son is highly allergic to pine nuts!

Made this exactly how the recipe said and it turned out great! Of course the timing in the oven was off, but that is to be expected. My wife also loved this recipe and we will be doing it again soon!.

Great recipe.  I substituted walnuts for pine nuts like others.  I had goat cheese at home so I substituted it for feta which worked.  I served it on the side with Parmesan broccoli and rice.

I used different spices on the outside of the chops.  Namely, a maple and sage rub that I had.  I will make this again.... lots of flavor.

I gave it 3 stars because I really liked the stuffing. As others have stated, the cook time was waaaaay too long.  The chops were dry.  The seasoning on the outside was too strong and didn't seem to meld.  Lastly, the balsamic didn't seem to do anything.  It just ran off when I brushed it on.  I put a balsamic glaze on them when they were served and that helped.

Recipe was delicious Only part of the recipe that seems strange is to bake a 1 1/2 inch pork chop for 40 minutes.  Then brush with balsamic and bake 5 minutes later.  Even if you check with a meat thermometer, at best you pull the chops at 145 degrees. I find that 160 degrees is just cooked a bit too long leaving the pork chops dry.

Made as the recipe called for - probably will cut down on the pepper (both black and the pepper flakes) but it was delicious!!  Served with a side of garlic and olive oil pasta.

Would have been better without the spicy rub seasoning;  As written, too many flavors competing and overpowering pork chop.

Amazing.  Added more pine nuts and my husband said they were the best pork chops he ever ate.  He doesn't like pork so that is a big deal.

Really good, followed recipe to the 'T'. Next time I'm going to add dried cranberries to the stuffing, thinking it will really make the recipe a 5 star rating.

This was a great recipe, but I made some slight modifications! First, I had boneless pork chops instead of bone in.  I forgot to pick up some feta, and didn't have any on hand.  And I didn't use the red pepper or balsamic vinegar.  I had to cook an additional 12 minutes because I had some thick cuts of meat.  Aside from those changes, they came out delicious.  Nice and moist and packed with flavor.  It was so good that I didn't miss the feta at all.

Mine came out too dry. Should have read the tip and covered with foil.

They were good. I'd try again with the added step.

This is very tasty & I will be making it again, also for special occasions. I added a small amount of frozen spinach to the pesto stuffing.  The herb rub is delicious.  I make my own pesto with home grown fresh basil.

Made it as stated except for pine nuts as I didn't have any.   I doubled the amount of stuffing as after mixing the described amount it didn't look like enough to stuff 4 boneless pork chops.  They turned out really, really good, but the meat was a little over-done.  Next time I'll cut the cooking time back by 10 or 15 minutes.

I had high hopes based on others reviews. I would increase the stuffing and decrease the rub and definitely decrease the cooking time. I like juicy pork chops and only cooked 30 minutes at 375 and they were still super dry. Would reduce heat to 350 and really watch the temp on cooking these. Overcooked pork is too chewy no matter how good the flavor. I’ll try again with adjustments though because I think the flavor combination is a good one.

Made this recipe to a tee except used boneless pork chops.  This recipe is a keeper!  SO easy and SO good.  Some said the outer seasoning was too hot, but we loved it as is.  

I am going to try and make it "Whole 30" and wondering what i could use in place of the feta?  I am getting recipes in line for doing Whole 30 in January.  Any ideas out there?

Extremely tasty pork chops!  Will definitely do it again.  Next time, though, I think I will cook them a little less.  They were a tad on the dry side.

Amazing meal for those who are following the Keto Diet.  This recipe is delicious and has almost no carbs (only 4).  Instead of Feta cheese I used shredded mozzarella and parmesan cheeses with the pesto and the pork chop was excellent.

I only had thick cut boneless chops so I used them. It was good. The next day I sliced the pork and used it in a spinach salad with feta cheese and craisens. The porks flavor improved the next day. I loved it cold!

I made this exactly as printed except I used pork tenderloin pounded to about 1/2" and omitted the pine nuts.  After browning the stuffed rolls of tenderloin, I made a simple sauce from the pan residue to pour over the pork after it was cooked in the oven.  Delicious!  Served it with perogies, sour cream, pickled beets and stuffed tomatoes.

OMG fantastic and easy. I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used boneless chops and an Italian seasoning mix I had from a favorite restaurant that was very similar to this mix. I also used a balsamic glaze. My boys -- dad and sons -- devoured it. I was lucky to get a quarter chop away from them. Oh, and I did not have pine nuts on hand. Didn't miss them but might be a nice addition the next time I make, which will likely be next week.

I used a small pork roast cooking half way through then removed from oven and cut about 3/4 of the through stuffing it with the fresh basil pesto and crumbled queso fresco.  Super moist!  Excellent.  My husband said it was the BEST pork dish he ever ate!

I really liked this so I made it again but this second time I made it better by marinading the meat over night in Balsamic and a light shake of garlic salt. When making the stuffing I doubled it adding some cream cheese with the feta... the pork chop was a thick bone in chop that I had cut a deep and wide pocket into. After stuffing the chop and securing with toothpicks. 
I then breaded the chop in ground pork rind dust. This makes it keto. Then a quick fry in a pan that can go in the oven. I used coconut oil. The quick fry then into the oven until done. It was rich and wonderful. I could not eat the whole thing but hubby had no problem. I plan on using this stuffing on chicken. Very good.

Very good recipe, but the rub was so strong it detracted from the pesto filling. I have a large garden and herb garden. so maybe my fresh herbs were stronger than dried. I make pesto with garlic, fresh basil and English walnuts, so I left out the pine nuts, also didn't think the heat from red pepper was necessary. If you garden, try making pesto with different basil varieties. I grow lemon basil, licorice basil, chocolate basil, and dark opal basil to name a few. Subtle flavor changes in homemade pesto like this can really bring out the flavors in this dish.

I had a good experience with this recipe, though a did change a few things. I did not add the red pepper flakes, and I used pecans instead of pine nuts in the stuffing. I also seared the chops in equal parts butter and olive oil after adding the rub but before I added the stuffing.

Good recipe for a simple meal that won't fail to impress. I made the pesto fresh, substituted the pine nuts for walnuts, and omitted the basalmic. The mix of the feta and pesto in the filling is so tasty and it keeps the meat moist. Savory and herby flavors make for a satisfying meal.

I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Went to a meat market  that has high grade meat.  Purchased the pork chops exactly as the recipe called for.  Followed the recipe exactly.  The prescribed time stated 40 minutes baking time, I cut this back to 35, basted with the balsamic vinegar and continued to bake for the additional 5 minutes.  They weren't that tender, would I make them again, probably not.  So very disappointed.  Was hoping for a new recipe to add to my private recipes ( 3  scrap books full from friend and collections throughout  the years, if I don't like them I don't keep them)   I doubt I will make this again.  Nice flavor, but not very tender.  I've been cooking for 50 years and love cooking recipes, have a collection of over 500 cookbooks and each one there is at least one recipe that I make, if there are none, I give them away.  If I've tasted a recipe from a friend and liked then it goes in my collection.  If not, out it goes, unfortunately, I doubt this will be added.

Will definitely make this again - we loved it.  My pork chops weren't thick enough to properly create a pocket, so I just put the stuffing on top - worked just fine.  (Now that I've seen the suggestion about flattening boneless chops and rolling around the stuffing, I will likely do that next time.

Plan to try again using chicken - I suspect that will taste really good as well.

We LOVED this!!!!  Only change I made was to add some diced sundried tomatoes to the filling.

Made it with chicken breasts instead of pork chops this time.  Left out the pine nuts as they didn't really add any flavor and they are pricey--but I did miss the chewy texture of them--so next time I will add some finely diced almonds.

All proportions (other than pork) need to be doubled. Also I found the stuffing needing some bread crumbs (Italian) with an egg.

Super simple recipe! I seared the pork before putting in the oven and swapped Parmesan for the feta. Used all the spices suggested. Served with Parmesan roasted Brussels sprouts and apple sauce. Great dinner!

Really tasty. I made it with boneless chops, just the normal 3/4 thickness and used a sharp knife to make a pocket.  Baking time was about 30 minutes. I omitted the red pepper to avoid spiciness reported in other reviews. Disappointed with the "balsamic glaze" as the balsamic ran off and puddled in the pan and didn't thicken in the pork chop juices.  May use a bottled balsamic reduction we love next time and may make more stuffing.

I made this yesterday (12/25/2016).  I bought 2 large (2 inches thick)  boneless pork chops at the meat counter; one pork chop would have been enough for the two of us.  This was easy to prepare and had the advantage that the pork chops could be stuffed ahead of time.  The stuffing filled our two pork chops.  Even though they were about 2 inches thick, they still were ready in about 40 minutes.    I was pleased with this recipe; it was easy, but had the look of something more complicated.  We didn't  the rub was too hot.

This was really very good.  The only problem I had was probably of my own making...they were too dry.   My pork chops were probably not as thick as called for, so they dried out too much.  The flavor however, was amazing.  A few nights later we had them...with some gravy that I happened to have.  This was the perfect solution!
I will make them again...and will check them periodically as they cook.

This was an amazing recipe. I found the amount of red pepper flakes to have a great kick, but if you're more sensitive to spices, I would recommend reducing the amount of spice. The only thing I did different was use boneless pork, which turned out great. It was a little thicker than what the recipe wanted, but it turned out great.

Decided to make this after receiving the AR magazine. The flavors were great and I really enjoyed the stuffed pork. I followed th recipe exactly using a jar basil pesto which gave it a strange flavor. I'll definitely make this again using homemade basil pesto instead.

I didn't measure anything.  Also, I used pecans instead of pine nuts, and I added dried cranberries to the stuffing.  I also added a bit of orange marmalade on top of each chop.  Took a little longer to bake than the recipe stated.  Family raved!

We loved it! We accidentally glazed it pre-cooking with Balsamic, and decided to do it again afterwards. The meat was tender, moist and the stuffing was excellent! We are eating this again!

Good enough to become a regular at our table. Two notes: I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I used balsamic glaze - it was too strong so I won't do that again; also, this recipe would work well with boneless chicken breasts.

Next time, reduce cooking time by at least 5 minutes, maybe 10. Just a tad dry. But extremely tasty served with cesear salad and steamed carrots.  No real challenge making this recipe either. Simple and easy.

These are good! My only modification if that can be called as such was that I added a bit of olive oil to the rub because it seemed too dry to me. I unfortunately could not add the red pepper flakes as I can not eat spicy stuff. Also, I had to leave out the balsamic as I discovered way too late that I did not have this particular vinegar at home. Despite this short coming, the chops came out juicy and tender soft. I also lined the pan with non-stick foil and covered it with aluminum foil for the first 20 minutes of the cooking time to avoid the possibility of the chops drying out.  I also broiled them for 3 to 5 minutes per side to brown them a bit as I had no vinegar to caramelize. Still, they were juicy and delicious. As a side, I made orzo and mixed it with the same pesto I used for the recipe. The combination was perfect and by itself I WILL make this recipe again.

Excellent flavors. Tends to be a little dry. Next time, I would by fattier meat or roast with a small amount of oil in bottom of baking dish.

My husband and. I made this recipe, WITHOUT reading the reviews.  Definitely should cut down on the red pepper flakes if you are not into real hot  We only did two chops but made the same amount of stuffing.  That was delicious, however, we agreed we should have cut down on the cooking time by at least five minutes.  It was dry (but tender). But we will definitely make this again, very easy and tasty!

I'm not a fan of feta, so i substituted a Mexican cheese.  I may try asiago.  Very good, easy to make, and the family liked everything.  Next time, I will shorten cooking time as the chops were a little overdone after 40 minutes.

Really enjoyed these.  I used boneless pork chops and cut the pockets with a fish fillet knife.  I mixed a little olive oil with the seasonings before putting them on the pork chops so they would adhere better.  After the first initial baking, I removed the pork chops from the pan and added the balsamic vinegar to the pan drippings and reduced it before pouring them over the chops.  Then returned them to the oven for about 10 more minutes.  Mucho perfecto!!

Unbelievably good!  
After reading the reviews, I made a few changes....no red pepper!  I also used a whole boneless loin from Sam's to cut thick chops from.  Since I adore everything in the stuffing,  I made a double batch, stuffed 6 chops, seasoned the outsides, then stood them UP in the pan, the bottom fat layer making a perfect "standing layer".   This kept all the stuffing in and it puffed up beautifully!  To make the glaze layer, I reduce the balsamic on the stove top and then brushed it on the finish product, both sides and top. 
This is an impressive yet simple recipe worthy of a dinner party yet great for Saturday dinner with my family during college football on TV!

Husband loved it. Whisked EVOO & balsamic vinegar w/ 4-5 drops liquid smoke & brushed inside & out. Doubled cheese & pesto, kept spices tru 2 recipe. Thin coating of oil on foil lined pan, then thin onion layer & vegetable broth. Covered tightly w/ foil & baked at 200 for about 10 hrs. Flipped 1/2 way through fall off the bone tender. Yay ; )

I picked this recipe because it had all these different flavors going on.  WOW!!  Fantastic!!  Only one comment, 45 minute baking time is a bit to long for our taste.  I would pull the chops at 135 and let carryover cooking take over.  Otherwise, a keeper in my recipe box!

We didn't care for the combination of the pesto and the rub.  Too much going on!!  I agree that each by itself would be worth a try with the chops.  And the balsamic vinegar added another dimension that really didn't go with either of the flavor combinations.

I thought we would love this recipe.  I probably will never make again.  We love pesto, pine nuts and feta, but the combination with the pork chops was not appealing to us at all.  I gave two stars because my husband and 10 year old son ate it without complaining. Sorry.

Tasted excellent but the pork was way over cooked at the time suggested.  Next  time I will do half the time and check it.

It's hard to find things that my boyfriend and I can agree on for dinner. I made this one night without asking him, fingers crossed. We both loved it!! I didn't do the balsamic glaze, but it was still delicious. This one will be out on the dinner rotation.

We don't do spicy, so I didn't use red pepper flakes.  I also didn't use the pine nuts or pesto.  Everything else was exactly as is and we really enjoyed it!

These were so good!  I was very impressed by the flavors that worked together very well!  I didn't have any pine nuts and didn't feel like spending the money on them, so I just left them out.  But it was delicious even without them.  Excellent recipe!!

I was so excited to try this recipe, as our family loves pesto and feta cheese, and are always looking for a new way to cook pork chops. Only changes I made to the recipe was to increase the garlic (always), but kept to the recipe as shown. Sadly, the filling all oozed out, the pork chops were dry, and they tasted more like vinegar.  I will try this recipe again, but make sure I secure the chops better, and perhaps lessen the temp. of the oven, or cover the chops better, to increase moistness.  I'm wondering if an egg mixed in the feta cheese-pesto mixture would help it stay in the pork chop...

Put ONLY a dash of the red pepper flakes because the pepper gives it enough heat. I made it with 4 cheese and pesto stuffed boneless chops and used a light balsamic for the glaze. Superb! All who ate it enjoyed it including my teenage son.

Very Yummy. I did not use the spicy rub on top because I have little kids. I just used salt and pepper and the balsamic vinegar at the end!

I loved this recipe.  Great Job!  I made some changes because our tastes are different, and wow the result was awesome.  

I used cashews instead of pine nuts, same portion.
I didn't use pepper flakes, but substituted red pepper for a small kick.

I used regular pork-chops you would find anywhere.  I beat them silly with a hammer to thin them out.  stuffed them and used toothpicks to seal the meat.  I did everything else as you describe.  

Fantastic addition.  Thank you :D

Made it exactly as written. The stuffing was really really amazing!! It could easily be used on Chicken too. It wasn't an easy dish and it didn't really come together as one, that well, in my opinion... hubby missed dinner and ate it as leftovers the next day and raved... better the next day? I won't make it as written again but definitely will use the recipe in pieces.

Moist, tasty chops were the star of our dinner party.  So easy to make ahead, slip into the oven and serve with steamed vegies and roasted potatoes after cocktail hour.  No worries for the host and rave reviews from the guests. Followed recipe exactly, and happy that I did.

Nice change from breaded stuffing. I substituted walnuts for the pine nuts and added fresh chopped spinach. The stuffing mix was so good I made more and added it to brown rice. Yum
