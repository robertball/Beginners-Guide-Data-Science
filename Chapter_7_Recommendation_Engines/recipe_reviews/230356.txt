I used oat groats, so my cooking time was a little longer than stated.  I subbed chia seeds for the flax, and topped my cereal with pecans instead of walnuts.  I loved my breakfast this morning!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this this morning and I thought it was o.k.  I think it would be better with a little brown sugar or maybe even a little more banana to sweeten it up a little.  I'll try it again with one or the other.  (I didn't have time to add anything to it this morning.)

3 Tbsp honey perked it up some but it lacked enough cocoa flavor for me. Perhaps I should have doubled all the spices or the suggestion of serving with maple syrup and blueberries should be written into recipe. It's an incredibly healthy recipe though.

I made this recipe this morning. The cocoa taste with the steel-cut oats texture was really interesting. It needed a little sweetness, so my wife and I added a packet of Stevia and some blueberries. That sweetened it nicely. Overall, I think we will do this recipe again, but not too often.

Wasn't sure about this at first, but the more I ate, the more I liked it! Making it for the second time this morning. Makes enough for at least two breakfasts, just reheat in the microwave! Thanks for a quick and easy (and filling!) recipe!
