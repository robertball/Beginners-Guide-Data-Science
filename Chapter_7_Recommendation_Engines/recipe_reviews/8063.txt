Ok guys - I have a suggestion.  I've been using this recipe for a couple of years since our son is allergic to red dye (which ironically, is in almost all commercially prepared yellow cake mixes).  I have made the basic yellow cake and also the pineapple upside down cake version.  DO NOT use the shortening - use oil instead, and you will get a much lighter cake which is not dry and dense.  I have tried it with shortening and with the oil, and hands down, the oil version wins.  I also increased the milk to 1 1/2 cups instead of 1 cup (or 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup pineapple juice if using the upside down cake version).  VERY good with the tweaked changes, so I'm going ahead and giving it 5 stars.  Hope this helps.  :o)

I'm giving this 4 stars because of the adjustments I made.  I just tried the white cake variation, except I used oil instead of shortening and I used cake flour instead of all-purpose.  I recommend using cake flour as I makes it more fluffy and tender.  If you're going to use all-purpose, sift it, then measure it out.  This takes care of the density problem some reviewers have had.  Also, I didn't follow the directions.  When making cakes, you don't want to disturb the flour too much, otherwise it forms gluten strands which toughens the cake, and it comes out to be more like a bread.  Here's what I did:  In a large bowl, combine oil milk and vanilla.  In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. In a small bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks are formed (room temperature is best). Gradually add flour mixture to wet ingredients until just blended.  Fold in egg whites and pour the batter into the dish immediately.  Mine baked for about 30-35 minutes.  Combining the ingredients that way made it come out tall, fluffy, tender, moist, and full of flavor!

I'm a cake decorator, and I've been using this cake mix recipe for years.  It is the absolute best tasting cake in any of it's flavor variations.  Anyone who had trouble with this recipe either 1) didn't have fresh baking powder or 2) didn't realize that from scratch cakes do NOT look and taste like boxed mixes (and that's a GOOD thing).  I recommend using butter flavor shortening and only use real vanilla.

I've been using this recipe for nearly a year; I can't believe it's taken me this long to rate it...I use it as a base for almost every cake I make; I've made variations with chocolate, peppermint, cardamom, rum, fresh raspberries...pretty much everything comes out perfect.  To some of the reviewers who have had trouble with the cake being dense, try beating it slightly longer than specified...also I usually make the white cake and beat the whites separately as suggested, that makes it fluffier.  I also usually cook it in a loaf pan, but if you're using a flatter pan (13x9) I find it's better to lower the temperature somewhat to prevent the edges burning. A great basic recipe, though, and it's even low-fat!

Before I baked this Cake I read the reviews and found them very helpful...First I used 2 Cups of sugar and instead of milk I used 1 1/2 Cups of flavored coffee creamer.. I know this sounds really odd but it makes the cake soooo Moist and flavorful..Use any flavor you would like trust me you will NOT be dissapointed..When I bake cakes I use my judgement on cooking time and just insert a toothpick or knife in the middle to jugde doneness.. This recipe is really good if you make it your own

Delicious and easy.  I made a lemon cake variation.  I used the yellow cake recipe, but instead of 1 cup of milk I used 2/3 cup of milk and 1/3 cup of lemon juice.  Family loved it.

Delicious!  I used the yellow cake recipe.  I tweaked it a little. I add 1 package of vanilla pudding and increased the eggs to 3.  I also added 1/3 cup sour cream.  I also did half butter and half butter flavored shortening.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent...I made the yellow cake, and as per past reviews I used Cake flour, skipped the shortening and used oil, also added an extra half cup of milk...the mix looked watery, however, it baked up perfectly. Baked at 350 for 20 minutes, than reduced to 325 until done with a clean knife result!!! Very moist in our opinion...not like the boxed cake, but for scratch it is wonderful. Iced with chocolate icing!!!!

I've always had a weakness for sweets, especially cakes (probably because growing up my nanny was a professional cake decorator!) Having mixes on hand isn't always convenient. Besides, wouldn't you rather give people you love something special, made entirely from scratch (short of milling the flour!) that's variable and wholesome? This recipe allows for reasonable variance without sacrificing that "home-made from a box" type of familiarity yet is better because YOU made it. You always knew you could! Simply SIMPLE and delightfully DELICIOUS! Not a complaint to be found. Janet, with something so straightforward and honestly good you ought to have named it An Honest Cake.

I made this cake twice in a week. The first time was the basic yellow cake. Followed the recipe exactly....it was good but not great. Thought a little more sugar would have been good. Second time tried the chocolate version with a few changes...added 2 cups of white sugar & replaced the milk with buttermilk & sifted the flour, sugar, baking powder & cocoa together twice. Loved the chocolate cake a whole lot more!! Next time will follow these changes for the yellow cake too. All in all a good recipe....way better than the boxed one! Thanks for sharing.

I had to make a LOT of changes so this recipe is only getting stars because 1) it's pretty simple/easy 2) the baking time and temperature are accurate.   That said, I had to change many of the ingredients (added an extra 1/2 cup of milk, an extra cup of sugar, an extra egg, one extra tsp. extract, used cake flour, and used 1/2 cup oil instead of shortening). With these changes, the cake had a better texture and flavor.   Also, I mixed the wet ingredients THEN mixed in the dry until everything just came together. If you over mix, the texture won't be right.

This cake turned out super moist and fluffy (I made 2 of them).They were not dense at all. I find creaming the butter and sugar first easier them just throwing the first 5 ingredients together but other then that, the cake tastes great. The trick is to not over mix the batter.

This is a great and versatile recipe.  I used oil rather than margarine, since I find using oil makes for a lighter less dense cake.  I have made this recipe using an extra  1/2 cup of milk as some reviewers have suggested and sometimes using the amount specified.  Tastes great either way.  This is the procedure I follow to make this recipe nice and simple: First measure and sift the dry ingredients. In a seperate bowl measure and mix wet ingredients.  Finally add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients until well combined.  Pour and bake according to directions.   I have used this recipe to make white cake, yellow cake and chocolate cake.  Each cake turned out yummy and easy to make.

I made the yellow cake variation of this recipe for the "Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough + Cupcake = The BEST Cupcake. Ever." recipe, and I bumped the milk up to 1 and a 1/2 cups, just cause it seemed too small of an amount compared to how much milk/oil I usually have to add to other cakes that I make. I baked my cupcakes for 16-18 minutes and they were AMAZING!!! Definitely a keeper. Oh, and I also used cake flour instead of all purpose.

This is my go-to recipe for cake. Its perfect for people who bake simple cakes frequently, but prefer to control the ingredients. These cakes are nearly as easy as from the box, but without the chemicals.

The first time I..mean umm.."somebody" made this cake it did NOT rise at all.  Some idiot wasn't paying attention and used cornstarch instead of baking powder. The second cake was wonderful seeing as how the same idiot paid a bit more attention.  On a different note.. I just submitted a formula to the 3M corporation for a durable rubber floor mat....

I have found this recipe very useful; I can make a full size cake, but easily make an 8" cake or even make a quarter sized cake without any difficulty (for a small, individual birthday cake).  I make this mix up and store it in an air tight container, and then measure out what I need - I mix all the dry ingredients together and then measure 4 1/4 C dry ingredients to the others listed in this recipe for a full size cake.  You can start cutting it back from there, if you want to downsize the recipe.  And, I used this recipe to make a tres leches cake - it was perfect (baked the cake in a 13x9 pan and after removing from the oven, I poked holes all over with a cake tester and then poured over a mixture of 1 can coco lopez/cream of coconut mixed with 1 1/4 C fat free half and half).  Let it sit in the frig over night and then I sprinkled with toasted coconut and served with slightly sweetened fresh whipped cream.  Fabulous!   I will say, I made it with shortening first, and now make it with the same amount of canola oil, it's just easier and tastes the same or better.  This is simply a very versatile recipe.

Some other posters suggested to add oil instead of shortening, I couldn't agree more.  I've made it both ways, hands down, use the oil!

I'm an avid cupcake baker and would love to open my own shop one day, but I've always made my cupcakes from boxed mixes. I decided to do a trial run with these and bake my very first batch of cupcakes from scratch!  I followed the recommendations from other reviewers and used 2 cups of sugar and an extra half a cup of milk.  I also used vegetable oil instead of the shortening and doubled the vanilla.  I separated the egg whites and beat them until they formed stiff peaks, then added back in the whipped yolks along with the rest of the wet ingredients and whipped them all together and then added the dry ingredients gradually bit by bit and just beat each bit until the dry ingredients were mixed together and there were no lumps - only about a minute.  The batter was quite liquidy, but cooked up just fine.  I made cupcakes and baked them for about 23 mins.  These cupcakes were very nice and had a great vanilla flavor - overall I think this recipe was fabulous, but perhaps it left just a little floury texture on my teeth after I'd eaten one, but after I ate a second one covered in a nice vanilla butter cream icing the feeling had gone away.  I would definitely make this recipe again, and would love to try it in different flavor.

This recipe was pretty good.  It was easy, but I did make a few changes based off of other reviews (with the changes this cake is great).  I used oil instead of shortening (1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons), I reduced the sugar, and I added a package of instant vanilla pudding in with the flour.  The cake came out super moist and the pudding mix completely took care of the lack of flavor that others pointed out.  I will make this again and I recommend this to anyone looking for a simple yellow cake.

Definitely the best yellow cake recipe I have found on this site.  I made a few variations that helped make it more moist and less dense.  I increased the milk from 1 cup to 1.5 cups and substituted 1/2 butter and 1/2 oil for the shortening.  Also, do not skip sifting the flour!  Overall, a very delicious cake recipe that works on its own or as a base for another type of cake!

After trying this recipe completely as is im surprised that it got 41/2 stars? I knew what to expect by the way the ingredients are put together but I always try the recipes just like they are written first. It was a bit bland like other reviews said but I knew it would be by the sugar ratio. And it did come out a bit dense but I knew that too because of adding the sugar to the dry then just dumping in eggs with the wet. 
This is a 5 star recipe if I tweak it like others did. But I'm not rating my version of this recipe.
Even as is the cake is not dry or bad tasting.
But if you know how to whip the whites and add more flavor this is a keeper.

We currently live in Switzerland and to buy an American cake mix costs over $6.00 a box.  So, what a wonderful surprise this recipe is.  I have just made the white cake mix (1/2 recipe since there are only 2 of us) and I couldn't wait for my husband to come home so I tried it.  It is wonderfully moist and light (I beat the egg white before adding to the recipe) and it tastes just like the white cake mixes out of the box.  I can't believe it was this easy!  It did take longer to bake than the recipe called for but this could be due to our oven (not the best) and/or I used a Pampered Chef stone...those usually increase baking time a bit.  I also used margarine as shortening is also horribly expensive over here.  I will be making the white cake recipe over and over again...and, if the other recipes work as well as this, may never have to buy another box.  Janet, you may have put Pillsbury and Betty Crocker out of business!  Thank you!

goodbye boxed cake mix! I made the chocolate version. Only change I made was to use canola oil instead of shortening. It tasted like it came from a bakery...fresh, perfectly dense, yet moist. I made 6 jumbo cupcakes (Wilton's 6- 2 piece cupcake pan) and just put frosting between the layers & on top cause the sides didn't need to be "hidden" by the delicious tasting cake! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Made the yellow cake tonight. Holy ! Delicious, light and fluffy, great texture and taste. Blows boxed cakes out of the water. This is my new go-to cake recipe. I used butter instead of shortening (not a fan of shortening really).

As the recipe is written, it's not very good. The cake was dense and tough. However, it was so fast to make!  With some changes, it was phenominal. I didn't think it would turn out, but it did.  You must sift the flour before measuring, or only use 2 cups instead of 2 1/3 cups. So it might be a problem in our American measuring system which go by volume and not by actual mass.

This recipe turned out great for me. I did make the suggested alteration adding an additional 1/2 cup milk, 1 cup sugar, and 1 egg. I also used oil instead of shortning. The cake had great flavor and texture. It was also a tight enough crumb to hold up well to stacking and frosting. It didn't fall apart or leave a big crump mess in my frosting. I will use this recipe again!

This is it.  I can stop looking. I gave it a 5star because of the suggestions and I feel guilty about that because I didn't rate the original recipe.  But I'm telling you, REPLACE the shortening with oil!!  I also followed the suggestion of adding instant pudding (French vanilla)and an extra egg as well as 1/2 c milk and 1/2 c sugar.  I'm telling you,  the batter alone made my toes curl.  I also added nearly a cup of sour cream and that was a mistake.  The oil and pudding was enough because the amount of sour cream made it too moist.  At the very least don't add so much sour cream. I told my son to do a toothpick check and he takes what he calls the "wobbly" cake completely out, and turns the oven off to check with a toothpick.  Grrrr.  I did have to increase the cooking time.  The cake was good yesterday, I'm sure it will be even better today.  I made it as a layer cake with chocolate cream cheese frosting.  Thanks for a winner.

DRY! I made the white cake version and it was dry as can be.  Pretty tasteless, my 6 year old grand daughter said it tasted like "cookie powder" which is flour.  Sorry, won't try these again.

I was making a cake using a box mix and after taking the cake out of the pan I destroyed it.  It was too late to run to the store so I used this recipe and I have to say I will never use a box mix again.  I also like how you can "tweak" it to make different kinds.

This recipe was okay the first time I tried it, exactly by the recipe. A bit dry, though. The next time I took one members suggestion about replacing the shortening entirely with oil, that was much, much better. Added a bit more milk as well. The result was YUMMY!

Well, it was a hit on Thanksgiving.  I used the spice variation in 9x13, split and made a 2-layer cake and filled and iced with the Cinnamon Coffee Frosting (this site).  I used the butter flavor Crisco rather than oil, and I noted that the longer I beat it, the lighter and fluffier the batter became.  I can't wait to try the other variations.  So many people have become accustomed to the taste of the cake mixes and often cannot appreciate the taste of scratch cake.  So far, this one is a keeper for me.  Thanks for sharing!

i'm really not sure why this recipe got such good reviews. the cake was completely dense, and my partner said it tasted like a pancake. i made the yellow cake mix. 
it didn't bake well at all (it took forever for the middle to be done) and the flavor really wasn't that good.
i used the suggestions to beat the eggs beforehand but this really didn't help in making the cake any fluffier.
i've made cakes from scratch before so i'm not really sure what happened with this one. i'd love to be able to taste the cakes that turned out for everyone to see if it was just mine that didn't.
but i would never make this cake again, sorry!. we threw almost the entire thing away. white cake from a box tastes better. and i usually hate giving bad reviews.

This has been my go to recipe for three years now.  My first cake came out a little rough, but a lot of practice, patience, and butter, I've been creating wonder and delicious cakes.  
Recently, I've being adding Greek yogurt in to my milk, and olive oil with to my butter (I do not believe in shorting and I absolutely refuse to ever use margarine.) Neither takes away or changes the flavor of the cake, and the yogurt helps with make the cake moist.

I followed this recipe exactly for yellow and chocolate cakes, with the exception of using oil instead of shortening based on previous reviews.  It still ended up terribly dry.  The cocoa did not do much but change batter color, and the yellow cake not bad, but not very flavorful.  If I try this recipe again, I'll have to make quite a few adjustments to get it right.

This cake gets a one star rating for the taste.  I followed some recommendations and substituted oil and added 1 1/2 cups of milk, however, this still tasted horrible.  It was very similar to a pancake and was not sweet enough.  I even went back to the recipe thinking I must have done something wrong, but no, this cake was just plain inedible.

This is a great recipe! I did replace 1 cup butter for the shortening. (I just prefer butter) and it was fabulous!! My chocolate cake didn't come out as dark as the picture and it may be a little weak, so next time I might try adding more cocoa powder. But a great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

this is my first really bad review...i love to bake and i have baked plenty of cakes found on this site, but this recipe was a complete disaster.  I followed suggestions that other people made---used oil instead of shortening, increased milk, and used new baking powder.  i even used cake flour and was very careful not to over mix.  i will have to agree with one that said it tasted like sugar dough and one who commented on the texture being like cornbread.  i'm glad it worked for some people, wish it worked for me....but i definitely won't use this recipe again.

Not bad, but not what I was hoping for. I used applesauce in place of the shortening (I do the same w/ boxed cake mix) and I used almond extract in place of the vanilla. The flavor was good but I like my cake to be light and fluffy, this turned out more dense and bread like. I was careful not to over mix the flour in, I folded it in w/ the wet ingredients until just mixed. The amount of liquid is about the same as boxed mix but there is only a cup and a half of dry ingredients in the boxed stuff, so next time I make this I will only use 1 1/2 cups of flour and cut back on the sugar a bit... I think the whole 2 1/3 cups of flour resulted in a denser cake and I didn't like it, it didn't taste like cake should taste to me because of the density, even w/ frosting! As is, I wouldn't make again. Ill try it w/ the changes I mentioned though and hopefully it will turn out better.

I made the chocolate version of this cake because, at 7 months pregnant, I have been craving chocolate cake and was NOT disappointed! I took the advice of others and used veg. oil instead of shortening and sifted the flour and other dry ingredients twice. I also tossed in some instant vanilla pudding to the mix just to see what it would do. (I know store bought cakes advertise putting pudding mix in their batter so I figured, "why not?")  This cake is my pride and joy! I have never baked a cake from scratch but, once paired with the Creamy Chocolate Frosting from this site and a glass of ice cold milk, I feel confident serving it to others. It will take a dire situation to push me to buy boxed cake mix again! I can't wait to try other variations of this recipe!

So glad I found this recipe for my first from-scratch cake!  The only thing I did was add a 1/2 cup milk as per many other reviews.  It is so delicious and I have already used it twice in a week!  I will never make a box cake again.

I've been using this recipe for about 4 years now and I love it. I wanted to have control over the ingredients. I follow Janet's directions but add in some of the comments from reviews (such as adding more milk, using oil or butter in place of shortening, combining ingredients in separate bowls and then gradually together, beating the egg whites) I usually make the white cake for birthdays and Easter cupcakes. Thank you Janet for providing this good recipe! And thank you reviewers for the tips you've left. I'm rather inexperienced so it helps to know what changes I can make.

Wow! Very good and very versatile!! I took the advice of a reviewer and did it with oil instead of butter/shortening, and it was truly delicious. I topped with powdered sugar, and for some, I dropped in a Hershey's Kiss. Simply lovely.... but seriously, use oil.

I was looking for a cake recipe that i could make from scratch and get a box mix type of flavour and texture, but as other reviewers i have to agree its not like the box mixes at all. I used oil and increased the milk to 1 1/2 cups.. 
the result...
the cake rose beautifully, was golden brown on the outside and white on the inside

flavour= fresh out of the oven it tasted like flour, oil and eggs, kind of sticky although when i checked to see if it was done the toothpick came out clean... 2 days later, the flavour was MUCH better, not at all like it was the first day.

texture= very soft and moist

in the end i think if i ever make this again i will make it a day or two before i need it coz it really changes the flavour to resemble a box cake to some extent.

I guess I will give this 4 stars because I used another user's recommendations. I made the white cake, but used oil instead of shortening (I NEVER use shortening as it's just an abomination). I mixed the wet ingredients in one bowl, sifted the dry ingredients into another bowl, and whisked the egg whites in a 3rd smaller bowl. I then folded the dry mix into the wet mix, and then folded the eggs into that mixture once all flour was wet. The batter made 15 cupcakes. They were fluffy, moist, and very vanilla-y, unlike a box mix that tastes extra sugary sweet.

The first time I made it, it came out very dense, but flavorful. I tried again immediately after and realized I had accidentally added too much flour the first time (I was using a cup that was 2/3 cup, with 1/3 cup marker but filled it to 2/3) . The second time it came out perfect! I had also used up the last of my 2% milk on the first try, so I used almond milk on the second and it turned out great!

This was my first real success at making a cake from scratch. I can't wait to experiment with the flavor!

The first time I used this recipe I made the yellow cake just as the recipe was written. I wasn't impressed.  The cake was very rubbery and dense.  I decided to try this recipe again with a few modifications.  I made the chocolate version using cake flour, 1 1/4 c milk, oil instead of shortening and beat the eggs whites separately folding them in at the end.  The cake texture came out a little, but not much better.  And the chocolate flavor was barely detectable.  As this is probably the only from scratch cake mix on this site I will keep on making modifications until the cake texture and taste is to my liking because I cannot stand the boxed stuff.  Good start to work with though.

This was absolutely great. The only reason it didn't get the 5 stars was because I followed other suggestions and used 2 cups sugar and 1.5 cups of milk, as well as substituting oil for the shortening.

AWESOME!!!! I made the yellow cake version and used it in a pineapple upsided down cake recipe. I tweaked it a bit as per the other reviewers' suggestions.  I used oil instead of shortening, I sifted my flour and I made sure not to "play around" with the flour too much while mixing it in with the eggs , milk etc. Also, because I was using the cake in a pineapple upsided down cake recipe, I used 1 cup of milk and a 1/2 cup of pineapple juice. The result was a  delicious moist cake!!!

Wonderful homemade cake recipe. As other reviewers suggested I sifted the flour for the white cake recipe, subbed oil for the shortening, and I folded in beaten egg whites last. Thank you.

I've made the spice cake and the chocolate version of this so far, using the recommended oil and extra milk. The spice cake is wonderful. The chocolate could use a bit more cocoa powder (maybe even twice as much) but it was still good.

I just made this cake and it is so good. Perfect density. It will be my yellow cake recipe from now on. Used unsalted butter in place of shortening. It is important to sift the dry ingredients at least once. Twice is better. Once all ingredients are in bowl mix for 3-4 minutes as suggested with mixer for a smooth batter.

This is a great basic recipe. I did follow the tips by the user "family jeans" and used oil instead of shortning and also added the xtra 1/2 cup of liquid. It was the best pineapple upside down cake I have ever made. My family of four ate the entire thing in one evening. Great tips, Family Jeans.

I made the chocolate version of this cake.. it turned out dry and tasteless. I bake all the time and this is the first time I have ever had to throw away a cake. I should have known by the look of the batter that it needed more cocoa, but I followed the recipe as written. Will not make this cake again.

Thank you from Norway!!!We used this for our five-layer wedding cake (Norway is very expensive and we made our own).We started with the basic mix (white), second layer became yellow, third layer became chocolate, fourth layer became spice, and the fifth we added fruit.We covered it with glaze and jam made from our garden.It was simply spectacular!

Thank you for posting this recipe!  We have allergies to dyes and preservatives which pretty much cuts out all box mixed cakes.  I just tried the yellow cake recipe (I did use oil instead of shortening and added 1 tsp. of hazlenut flavoring).  It is so good.  My sons helped me put the recipe together and have been virtually orbiting our kitchen waiting for the go ahead to dig in!  It is a recipe I will probably print and place on my fridge for frequent use!  Thanks again from a mom who wants to "let them eat cake!"

I finally found my white and yellow cake recipes! I used oil instead of shortening, but thats just a personal preference.The cakes are light and fluffy with just enough density for decorating and shaping. Thanks!

Baked about 45 min in 9"x9" cake pan. I didn't taste the cake on its own 'cos I wanted to do more to it. Cut the cake in half and spread strawberry filling(heat 2C crushed strawberries, 1/4C sugar, 4tblsp jelly crystals and 2tblsp lemon juice). For the topping, I whipped 300 ml whipping cream, add it a package of already whipped cream cheese and 1/2C icing sugar.

This is the best homemade yellow cake I've made!  I have tried other recipes and they just come out to dense...BUT  I tried what one other review said about subing in oil instead of shortening and using 1 1/2 cups of milk instead of just 1 cup and WOW this cake is just so soft and lovely!  It's not too soft that it's hard to decorate- but it's JUST right.  Thanks so much fo a keeper in my reciped box!  :)

Wow! What a great recipe! My kids and I made the spice version on a rainy Sunday afternoon. I read some of the other posts that said it might be dry, so I used 1/4 more milk, all butter (no shortening), and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. We frosted it while it was still warm from the oven. "Mmmmm" is all anyone said. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks, Janet!

Made the white cake for a block party and got rave reviews.Very simple and almost fool proof. Be sure to whip the egg whites until soft peaks form and GENTLY fold in to avoid overmixing,other wise it won't turn out light and fluffy.Paired well with chocolate buttercream frosting

Yes He is, the cake mix is the first I've tried from scratch. With a few variations of my own it turned out absolutely wonderful! :) The tips I would add is , lower the heat on the oven to 325 and add ten minutes to cooking time. Use cake flour plus add 4 Tblsp. ,cut in the shortening with your hands, it seems to blend    better..Definitely whip the egg whites for about two minutes on med-high before adding to mixture. Plus I added a 1/2 a tsp. Almond extract for more flavor. Delicious, I won't ever need to use box mixes again! Thank you Janet for submitting this cake recipe! Our family of six Loves it!

Has a little too much sugar for my taste and the height of the cake using the 9x12 pan was only about 1 1/4" high which might be a little shallow for some.

This is a very good recipe. If you want it moister go for an extra egg. Plus I found if making chocolate cake mix, baking soda seems to make it better. Use hot h2o to bloom the cp.

I made this in a bundt pan twice in one day (chocolate variation) for my two girls' birthday parties this weekend. I may never make a box mix cake again, although I have to make note of my changes to both directions and ratios. 

In a large bowl, I sifted flour, 1/3 c cocoa and baking powder together with salt. In mixing bowl I blended oil (instead of shortening), sugar, 1-1/4 c milk, and 1/4 c creme de cacao. In a small bowl I whipped the eggs to a froth. 

After slowly adding flour mixture to oil mixture just until blended, I folded the frothy eggs into the batter and turned the whole thing into the greased and floured bundt pan. Baked at 325 for 40 minutes, it came out moist and bursting with personality. 

I'm hoping the birthday party guests don't eat all of it, because kids can't possibly appreciate this as much as I will, after the end of the second party with a glass of champagne.

I did not have a box cake mix on hand and really wanted to make a cake for our St Patty's Day dinner.  This recipe worked great!  I used egg whites, half Spenda for sugar, half applesause & half oil for the shortening called for.  I also added 1/2 cup of amaretto and subbed almond extract for vanilla to make an amaretto cake.  I baked in a bundt pan for 50 minutes (bit too long), and used a drizzle for frosting.  This worked just as great as a box cake - thanks for saving me in a pinch!

I just baked the cupcakes using yellow cake recipe.  I added extra 1/2 cup of milk and used oil instead of shorting like other reviewers had suggested.  I cut down 1/4 cup of sugar and added 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips into the batter.  I put all the dry ingredients and whisked them together then made a well in the middle and pour all wet ingredients except eggs and beat them till incorporate then put eggs one by one beat them each time till smooth.  It came out nice and moist!  I iced them with chocolate whipped cream mix-in crushed Oreo cookies.  It was not too sweet, just the way we like it:)

Recipe as written needs to be modified. I added a 1/2 a cup of liquid (milk,water juice) to recipe, used oil and whipped egg whites seperately and then folded it together. You can also add one package of pudding mix to make it extra moist. It is quite good. For those who don't like the taste this is not a box mix, it is a real cake. If you want that texture you have to use a lot of chemicals to get it. But for those attempting to avoid mixes this is a nice cake. I've tried the yellow and white versions. Both are very nice. Feel free to add sprinkles for a confetti look. Enjoy!

This is a wonderful recipe. I used the Yellow Cake directions but I added a package of instant banana pudding. I made to cakes out of it in order to make the Banana Flips I also found on this site.

I used the white cake recipe without changing anything.  The cupcakes turn out moist and light.  In order to get the light/fluffy consistency, the egg whites need to be folded in.  I will try the yellow cake next time.

I just made a plain yellow cake, I used oil instead of shortening  and doubled the vanilla. Turned out really good, its fairly dense yet fluffy. Its a great easy recipe with ingredients that are typically always in the cupboard! I will definitely try some of the variations of this recipe :)

Very good cake.  A little heavier than most which I like.  Stands up good to frosting.

5 stars for ease.  5 stars on time.   4 stars of flexibility and customization.   3 stars on texture. 2 stars on taste.   Used oil and 25% more milk for a moist cake.   Rose very well.  Iced very well.  Held up to handling (9" round pan).   But the tatse was similar to a store cake.

I made the pineapple upside down version with the yellow cake mix and took it to a family gathering.  Everyone loved it and it was still moist two days later (it made a lot!)  Thanks for sharing all the basic recipes - I brought English recipes to Canada with me but they don't work without modifications because the flour in Canada is different (coarser or finer, not sure which) so the basics are a great addition to my cookbook.  Thanks!

I don't find yellow cake mix where I live, so now I can still make all other recipies that mention it on this site :) The yellow mix I tried turned out quite heavy but I don't know if that is the way it should turn out. But anyhow, thanks again for sharing!

Excellent basic yellow cake recipe. Great texture and flavor. Used butter instead of shortening. Made about 15 muffins. Refer to the photo to see how nicely it rose into dome on top.

Very light and tasty...will cut back on the sugar the next time I make this recipe as it was a bit sweet for my taste. I used oil instead of shortening as suggested and I added about 1/4 cup more milk too. I made cupcakes (24) which baked with a dome top that was perfect for a poured fondant recipe I found here on allrecipes.

I really appreciate this recipe for scratch cake.  My husband is on a low sodium diet.  When I make something from scratch, I use low sodium baking powder.  It really lowers the sodium count for recipes.  Thanks Linda/Mi

Made this as a pineapple upside down cake and it turned out extremely well...the only change I made was to use butter instead of shorting. Will definitely be making this again.

This turned out to be ok for me. I followed the directions as they stated. Mine came out a little dry. Maybe I baked it to long. I baked it for 35mins. I'll give it another try and bake it for less time and see if it makes a difference.

Made 2 cakes: one yellow, one chocolate variation.    I wish I had known this would be so horrible and not wasted my hard earned money on ingredients just so the entire thing could be thrown in the trash.    I did eat one forkful just to see if it really tastes like cornbread, and yes, it tastes like a mediocre version of cornbread. Very dense, not much of a "cake". I do not recommend this recipe.

i find that in any recipe if it calls for shortening i use butter instead and use half of the amout called for and the other half oil and it comes out moist and slightly buttery without being over powering and so fluffy!!

This is a great recipe.  I have used it twice now to make the yellow cake mix. I made cupcakes and the Irish cream cake.  Came out well both times and I subbed butter for the shortening.

hey peps i luv this rec. ive made it into a coconut cake as well. instead of the milk i used coconut milk and added coconut extract instead of vanilla. im not a fan of putting in shredded coconut into the cake so i toasted it and put it around the outside of the cake after frosting it with a whipped cream chesse frosting a friend of mine gave me. it is really good and i agree with the oil instead of shortening for the lighter cake. if you are wanting to carve the cake i would go with the shortening it holds up better to all the ..... massacring you gotta do lol. good luck and great eats

I was looking for a pineapple upside down cake recipe to use a fresh pineapple we recieved as a gift. So many of the recipes on this site call for cake mix. I don't like to use packaged foods because of the chemicals in them (I'm allergic to food coloring) so I searched for a homemade yellow cake recipe and came across this one. And fortunately, it had the directions for pineapple upside down cake here. The only thing I changed was the method of mixing things. I mixed all the dry ingredients together. I used a combination of half melted butter and half vegetable oil for the shortening, mixed that with the other wet ingredients then mixed all of that with the dry. This was super delicious. I will definitely be using this scratch cake in other recipes that call for cake mix.

I used the yellow version for cupcakes. Baked at exactly 25 minutes, they turned out delicious and fluffy. The outside had just the right crunch to it. I double-sifted the dry ingredients since I didn't have cake flour and the flour I did have was stiff.  I have attempted the spice cake recipe, but my cake collapsed in the middle after baking it.

I made cupcakes. My husband couldn't stop eating them. I used 1 1/2 c milk and 2 c sugar and oil instead of shortening. I unfortunately do not own a sifter, but they came out really good. I am going to make another batch right now.

Loved it, was truly easy and yummy. I love the fact that I'm in charge of the ingredients. I made them into cupcakes and baked them for around 18 minutes in a 350F oven. They turned out lovely and moist. However next time, I might add more than the amount of cocoa to make the chocolate cake mix.

This cake was fantastic. I am living at 12000 ft, and it is difficult to get cakes to do what I want. I used the oil for shortening substitution (since I am unable to get shortening where I live) and the additional milk. I also cut back a little on the sugar, don't know how much exactly, added a packet of vanilla pudding mix, and about 10 crushed Oreo cookies. I frosted it with an impromptu frosting of melted marshmallows mixed with a bit of melted semisweet chocolate  and a smidge of milk. It was a hit with all the students here at Tibet University, and also with the restaurant staff where we were having a birthday party. I will definitely be using this recipe in the future.

I have followed the tweaks suggested earlier:  swap oil for shortening, increase milk to 1 1/2c.  I have also added a box of pudding mix to mine and it made for a very moist cake.  In one version I made pistachio using pistachio pudding and subs almond extract for vanilla.  Also, I have made a divine lemon cake with this recipe by subs. lemon extract for vanilla and adding vanilla pudding.  It is a delicious cake, much better than boxed mixes.  The texture reminds me of my delicious wedding cake.  MMMMMMMMM!!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!  I recieve compliments whenever I make it!!

I came across this recipe while searching for an easy pineapple upside down cake recipe. I am so glad to find these easy substitutions for boxed cake mixes.  My grandson is allergic to artificial flavorings, dyes and preservatives in processed foods.  Now I can make a cake that he can eat and without a lot of fuss!!

This was great!!  I live in South Korea and can not get shortening so I used the substitute of oil.  It worked great!  I also have a slightly bigger pan than a 9 x 13 so  I upped the servings to 36.  The cake rose wonderfully and tasted delicious.  I added cinnamon plus from pampered chef.  It gave it a nice light spiced taste.  Next time I will only bake it 30 minutes.  It got slightly over done on the bottom and edges.  Thanks so much!! Feb 08:  I just made this cake again tonight.  I have just found out my daughter is allergic to milk and always looking at ways to make things with out milk.  Well, I used the basic cake recipe, left out the eggs and milk and added Sprite for the liquid.  It turned out wonderful! Again I used oil and not shortening.  Wonderful!

Excellent.  Great homemade taste.  For those that are having problems with the texture, you can use cake flour instead of regular.  It will make it more fluffy, like a boxed cake mix.

Great recipe and excellent sub for mixes. I make cakes to sell and this one is the first one I've used that is moist enough. I used the oil that was suggested in one of the reviews and it's perfect. The standard recipe doesn't really make enough batter so I upped the ingredients to 30 servings (using 3 eggs) and that is perfect.

I used the recipe for the white cake and I didn't like it at all.  I used oil instead of shortening like somebody else suggested.  But the cake didn't taste sweet at all (and I made sure to use the right amount of sugar).  The batter tasted a lot like flour.  And cake tasted a lot like a pancake.

Really light scratch cake.  Most of the scratch cakes I've made have come out heavier.  It's not especially sweet, but with frosting it's perfect.  I can't wait to try the variations.  This is the recipe I'm using from now on.

Since I was making this as a birthday cake, I doubled the recipe so that it would make 2 layers.  For the filling, I used pineapple (2 cans of pineapple tossed in the food processor, simmered with a bit of sugar, then strained).  And topped it off with a vanilla-cream cheese frosting (store bought, because I ran out of confectioners sugar).  Everyone loved it!!!  Would definately use again and try different variations!!!  Thanks Janet!!!

I used this recipe to make a cake mix for the Yummy Pumpkin Cheesecake Bars recipe on here, so I didn't actually make the cake.  However, the mix worked perfectly well in the recipe and tasted great.  It was very easy, too, and I'm saving this to my recipe box for when I next need a cake mix but have no mix in the house.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was a very simple and good recipe.  I did use oil instead of shortening because I had none in the house but it still worked out quite well.  My main concern with mixes is the moistness so I did add an extra egg.

I am puzzled by some of the reviews here.  Why would anyone want a cake that tastes like a cake mix?  The only good cake mix is a dead one.  Is the goal to make an inedible cake???!!!

Terrific base recipe. I baked the yellow cake today to take to a church function and it was a huge hit. I used 1/2 cup softened butter instead of shortening and added 1 cup of sour cream to the mixture and baked in a bundt pan at 325 for 50 minutes. The cake was so moist it was falling apart! I also made an orange glaze and drizzled over the entire cake. This recipe is so much better (and cheaper) than buying box cake mixes and it takes no time to make!

Excellent recipe! The cake has none of that "boxed" flavor.  However, like others, I too, have tweaked it! My advise is: Place flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl and use a whisk to "sift".  In your mixer bowl place sugar and 1/2 cup sweetened applesauce (this might help the sweetness problem others are having) and mix until sugar is well blended.  Add eggs 1 at a time and use 3 eggs.  With mixer running add flour mixture alternating with milk mixing well after each addition ending with flour mixture. I bake it in a bundt pan for 50-60 minutes.  My variations:  Orange cake add 1/2 cup orange juice and an extra 1/2 cup flour.  Lemon cake same as orange.  I made the spice cake and added 3 grated carrots to the batter.  I add all kinds of fruit, chopped apples, or cherries, or whatever is in season.  Nuts and/or mini chocolate chips are great too.  Hope this helps others.

I was so excited to make this cake from reading the reviews. I did a trial with it yesterday before my sons 1st birthday. The top came out hard and the bottom was very soft and I didn't find it to have much flavor. I followed the directions exactly and didn't even go the full time limit. I was very disappointed. I made the yellow cake first. I also tried the chocolate cake and the same thing happened. Glad I did not try this for my sons party.

I made the yellow cake version yesterday to make cupcakes, they were so good.  The recipe was is very simple to follow; however I did make some changes and I do have some suggestions.  I used one extra egg and also added about 1/3 cup of sour cream. I also added a little more sugar, the next time I will make it an even 2 cups of white sugar. When adding the ingredients to each other combine the dry ingredients in one bowl and the wet in the other and mix well.  Next you want to slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry.  I also recommend the eggs and milk being at room temp before mixing.

I made the adjustments to the recipe using oil instead of shortening and used the 1 and half cups of milk and the cake turned out beautiful.  It smelled wonderful while baking and tastes great with chocolate frosting.  I will use this recipe again.

Followed the advice of increasing the milk to 1 1/2 cups and using oil instead of shortening.  It came out very moist.  No more box mix, I finally found a great recipe.

I've been making the yellow cake variation with oil instead of shortening for months now.  This is an excellent recipe that has featured in many birthdays and bakesales.  It's easy to dress up and down with different frostings.  We like it as a two layer cake with preserves in the middle and cream cheese frosting.

Very simple directions to follow.  So easy that the kids were able to help.  Only thing I did different was I split the batter between to 9inch round pans which altered the cooking time some.  And coated it with yummy chocolate buttercream on the yellow cake.

Love this recipe.  Made the white cake for my hubby and daughter and they raved about it.  I love that it would be a great recipe for me to use to cut and create a great cake for my daughter's birthday.  It is sugary and sweet.

This recipe was delicious with  some variations mentioned by other reviewers.  I used melted butter instead of shortening, reduced the sugar to 1 1/3 c. and used 1 1/2 c. milk.  The crumb of the cake was moist and firm.  I am so excited to try the chocolate and white variation.

Cooking time didn't work for me. Could be my pan? It took approximately 35 minutes. Great tasting though, so four stars!

Absolutely the BEST cake I've ever made!!!  I followed the prior suggestions of using oil instead of shortening, and increasing the milk to 1 1/2 C.  I made mine almond flavored by using 1/2 tsp of almond extract, with 1/2 tsp vanilla, instead of the 1 tsp vanilla.  I don't have a sifter so I made sure to avoid packing down the dry ingredients and mixed them loosely with a fork. My fiance and I both raved about it and I can't wait to try the other variations, playing around with new flavors!

Super good.  I used all organic ingredients, and it came out lovely and fairly wholesome.  I whipped my eggs and then folded them into the other ingredients.  Thanks for sharing, Janet.

I used this recipe to make white cake. It was good, but very dense. You may want to add a little water.

Definitely have to mix the wet ingredients first, add the sugar, then the other dry ingredients.  Then it's a great recipe.

Fantastic! Exactly what a homemade/from scratch cake should be.  I've made it with shortening and with oil both are great (oil is a bit lighter).

Okay, I read all the reviews that said "more flavor", and after making the chocolate variety (w/ the oil sub.) and the texture being great but it not being chocolatey at all...  I thought -they can't all be wrong- so I increased the sugar to 2 c. and WHAT A MESS!  The whole thing went FLAT and it was like a sugar cookie topped cake and the middle was too moist!  My suggestion (and my husbands) kick up the flavor DON'T touch the rest of the recipe (oh, except for the oil sub. - that's a keeper! )

Excellent cake! I did modify it based on David's Yellow Cake, but it isn't enough to rate this any lower. I added substituted 1/3 cups of flour for wheat fine flour for wholesomeness. I used 1 full cup of butter so that it was moist and to perhaps minimize the egg flavor. I used 4 eggs and 1 yolk because it's supposed to be yellow cake, not white. Plus I didn't want to waste the whites (David's Yellow cake calls for 8 yolks only, but many people used 4 eggs instead). I also used 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla. It was delicious, moist, and didn't stink like eggs.

I baked the yellow cake according to the directions but used oil instead of shortening and I used 1 1/4c milk. It looked beautiful! It rose nicely and looked professional, BUT it tasted like a Glorified Cornbread. :( I will NOT make it again. I will be going by the store tonight to buy a box mix...

Followed directions exactly and wound up with a crumbly "cake" that tasted like sweetened cornbread.  I'll keep trying using other reviews - may end up being a great base recipe.

Not edible!  This is by far the worst cake I have ever made.  What a waste of ingredients!  It turned out dry and tastes very doughy.  Sure glad I sampled it before I put icing on it and served it to anyone!

This is a really good recipe!!. I used oil instead of shortening, 3 eggs, 1 1/2 cups milk, 2 cups of sugar and since we really like chocolate cake, I increased the cocoa powder to 3/4 of a cup! I baked it in two 8 inch round cake pans for 25 minutes. I used a german chocolate frosting from this site. Delicious!!

i've only tried the yellow cake, but don't worry, i won't be trying any of the variations. i made this cake several times thinking it was something *i* was doing wrong, and even tried some the modifications suggested by other reviewers. this cake, as is, is way too sweet and DRY DRY DRY.

Don't overmix the batter, this goes for quick bread, drop biscuits, cake mixes...if you overmix, you'll get a peak or a little "break" on top, stop mixing Before you think you're done, there should still be a few lumps in the batter, just scrape up (or fold) from the bottom while mixing to make sure all the flour in the bottom is incorporated =) Hope this helps.

Thanks to VirginiaJ for recommending not to overmix. I mixed it less than the recipe calls for and it domed nicely, not like a volcano this time! I also made more changes based on other reviews and it turned out much moister and with better texture. The changes are: use oil instead of shortening, increase milk to 1.5 cups, increase sugar to 2 cups, and use three eggs. I'm going to stick with this version now!

I made the yellow cake following the advice of other users.  I increased the milk to 1 1/2 cups and used canola oil instead of shortening.  it turned out moist and wonderful!  I also frosted it with the Almost Professional Buttercream Icing from this site.  It is great.  I give it 5 stars with these modifications.

Very good. I used the one for a yellow cake and the recipe called for unsweetened applesauce in place of shortening or oil. This is perfect to be used in place of boxed mixes.

great recipe. very simple. I did some minor changes to it by adding one extra egg for a more tender cake. 1/2 cup extra of sugar and my choice of liquid. I also used oil which will keep your cake moist (1/2 cup). I did lemon cupcake with these new addition as well as i substituted 1/2 cup of my liquid for lemon juice and added the zest of 1 lemon to my sugar and creamed it b4 adding my oil. hope this helps sum1 out.... happy baking!!!

This was very good, a nice option instead of a mix, which I don't like to use. I used butter instead of shortening, 3 eggs as per other reviews and 1 tbsp not tsp of vanilla because I love vanilla and I wanted a nice vanilla taste. Everyone devoured the cake!

I added 1/2 C sour cream and blended with oil separately 1/2 C half n half took advice from reviewer and used oil instead of shortening really sifted the flour w/baking soda well and separated the egg whites from the yolks (put the yolks in with the oil) and folded the fluffed egg whites in last After greasing a 9 x 13 pan with butter I dusted it with cinnamon and brown sugar. My kids, my husband were in a very happy place. Making it again today!

This is a good basic recipe, I've made it a dozen time, using the chocolate cake, yellow cake and pinapple upside down cake.  It turns out pretty good. I usually use this recipe in a recipe that calls for a cake mix and just adjust the liquid ingredents.

Absolutely gorgeous! I don't like the idea of cake mix, so this recipe comes in handy, with variation. I baked a yellow cake, I used butter, and reduced half the amount of butter, maybe that was why my batter was thick (I should have added some oil). But the cake turned out very nice! Can't wait to try the white cake ^^

ok, here's my review...i tried the white and yellow cake 3 times, and i think that last time was my last. the first time i made this cake, it seemed really good. it was the yellow version and it came out moist, but had a bit of an aftertaste to it (im assuming from the baking powder) the second time i made this cake i used the white version and substituted butter for the shortening. bad idea...it sunk in and after cooking it for longer than expected it came out very dense and almost like a pound cake consistency. this last time i made it, it tasted sooo much like cornbread. i guess i just haven't had much luck with the yellow and white version of this recipe.

I used this recipe in place of a butter cake mix for a banana cake recipe. (I was beside myself that I didn't have a boxed cake mix....until I found this recipe.) Just what I needed. Thank you.

I used the oil substitution recommendation, and while the texture was fine, the flavor was pretty blah. Frosting hides it well enough, but it just lacked any kind of flavor. Even using my best Mexican vanilla.

I've done this recipe twice.  I'm notorious for my cookie and cake inventions, but wanted to try to have a staple cake batter for carving.     The first time (without an extra egg as suggested) The middle didn't rise. And EVERY ingredient I have is fresh.  The second time- with the third egg- it rose and baked nicely (mind you I'm following the top v. of the recipe). But even still (I added some kahlua and some sour cream for moisture) it was DRY DRY DRY. Amazing taste with my envisioned Kahlua/Irish Cream frosting cake---but just not up to par. It's going to take a LOT of tweaking to get the right consistency, moisture, and texture I'm looking for in my cakes.

Good base recipe.  I've been using the yellow cake directions and adding extra ingredients like blueberries or oranges (current faves) and spices to switch 'em up.  The fruit flesh adds dietary fiber, and also reduces the amount of fats needed to moisten the cake.  I like butter best, and replace the shortening in this recipe with it.  TIP: easy way to "cut in" butter without the expensive butter cutter tool... use a frozen stick and grate it on a cheese shredder.

Sorry, but it's really not good as is!!! At first, you obviously need 1 more egg... You totally need to sift your flour before you measure it, as someone noticed. Also, for me, there is too much fat! I did use butter instead of shortening, it's not helpful - cake is so heavy!!! And I added like 1/2 extra cup of milk, cause batter was too thick. Without any changes cake is dense and heavy, and even with some tricks it's kinda like that...

This came out very well, so much better than a commercial mix from a box.  I made the modifications from a previous review; used oil instead of shortening and increased the milk.  I also used cake flour.

This cake is definitely moist and delicious, but a little too dense for my liking.  I used butter so maybe I'll try using cooking oil next time around to lighten the texture a bit.  My hubby and kids loved it, though.  I'm going to attempt to make crumb cake from this recipe as the taste and density is similar to the one from a popular coffee shop (hubby's favorite dessert).  Thanks for sharing.

I literally just got done baking this fabulous cake and had to run down to give it the 5 stars it deserves.  I'm the type that has to have lots of frosting but I haven't even frosted it yet and already we'd eaten half of it.   I made the white cake version and added pink food coloring for my sister's baby shower.  I made some changes, I didn't have shortening so I used 1/2 cup butter and added and extra 1/2 cups of milk because it looked to thick.  I also reduced the temp to 325 and baked in two square pans for 25 mins.  They turned out perfect.  I will forever use this recipe and can't wait to try the pineapple upside down version.  That's my husbands favorite.

I'll NEVER buy another cake mix,EVER. This was so moist and wonderful. I did use margarine instead of shortning as I don't buy it. BUT the margarine worked great.

I used this to make 2 9' poke cakes, using sugar free jello. The family fell in love with it. No cake has ever went faster in this house!

For those of you who thought it was dense try this: Cream margarine and sugar together first until VERY creamy, then beat in each egg(I used 3) individually, beating well. Then add vanilla, baking powder and salt. Add the milk and flour in thre installments beating well between each. This is how my Grandma swore to ALWAYS make a cake, so I listen because NO one cooks like Grandma did...

I think people are forgetting that homemade cake is very rarely as fluffy and light as commercially prepared mixes (i don't even want to think about what they do to those mixes to achieve that effect) and that the flavors are much cleaner without being overwhelmingly sweet or chemically tasting.  That said, this cake is incredibly easy to make, but I have to admit that I tweaked it a bit.  I followed a suggestion from one of the reviewers and used oil instead of shortening.  I also added about 1/3 cup of walnut liqueur to the batter to give it an extra something.  I mixed all the dry ingredients and then added the wet ingredients to the same bowl (no other dishes to dirty), mixed and was done!  The cake turned out dense, but NOT dry!  Next time i might add some applesauce to give it a little more volume.  All in all, a great, simple, and quick recipe for when you need something quick and delicious.  UPDATE**** IF you don't want a dense cake, use the extra half cup of liquid, as suggested by one of the reviewers.  YUMMY!!!  UPDATE #2:  Use 2and1/4 cups flour, 1/2 cup oil, and 1.5 cups buttermilk.  Best results this way.

I made the chocolate version of this recipe. It was pretty good. I used cocoa instead of the bakers chocolate though and my cocoa wasnt fresh so I don't think it had the "oomp" that it could have. However, let me say that the flavor was very rich. The cake was good and is absolutley a keeper. I will probably "tweak" it a bit eventually but this is still a great cake.

I thought this was very good!  For simplicity I used oil, especially since others said that was good.  I didn't make any other changes.  I was making cupcakes, and filled them 1/2 to 2/3 full, baked 15-20 minutes and they were perfect.  I frosted them with "butter cream frosting II". Yummy!!  So mutch better than a mix.

I tried the chocolate variation and my cake came out fluffly, not too sweet with a very "bread" flavor not cakey flavor.  it was good.  I used store bought chocolate frosting on it and it balanced out just right since the flavor of the cake itself is not too intense.  Mine took about 10 minutes longer to cook in the center and the edges were a tad crispy but still good.  I'll make again just keeping a closer eye on the time so that I dont over cook it.  With baking it's important to make sure your measurements are EXACT and you follow the recipe as stated.  I think that's what some of the bad reviews are really about...people not following directions and messing with the measurements.  The batter seemed thick to me but the cake density was fine once baked.

This was a great!! I made cupcakes out of this yellow cake mix and it was wonderful, not sure why everyones having a problem. i followed the directions perfectly with just alittle extra milk(since it was just a tad to thick). It almost looked like a cookie mix but with alittle more milk it turned thinner . I baked them at 350 for about 10 mins, just let them lightly brown, any longer and they will become hard. Make sure you take them out of the pan as soon as possible to avoid any further cooking. Perfect Cupcakes, nice firm tops and soft middles! thanks for the recipe!

Wow, was I disappointed. I love to bake and thought I would try this. Lots of time and wasted ingredients. Maybe I'm just too used to box mixes but this was not good. I usually prefer scratch baking but not with this recipe.

Yum! I made the yellow cake variation, and it was really white, which is ok. But the cake was so delicious! Sifting sugar really makes a difference! I love it.

I used the recommendation to substitute the shortening with oil and increase the milk amount.  It was WAY too moist.  At the 30 minute mark, the top was browning but the center was still completely liquid.  I reduced the temperature, covered the cake and baked for another 30 minutes.  The cake looked horrible, but it did have a good taste.  I covered it with icing and the guests were none the wiser.  I will try the cake again, but not with both of those changes.

I made the white cake and added the egg whites separately as suggested. The cake tasted like dough and was very dense...was not very good. This recipe needs to be tweaked. I would not follow the recipe as listed again.

I followed this recipe exactly as written
and it was perfect. I started reading the reviews while the cake was in the oven and became scared. I think all of those other people are just horrible bakers. Those people need to check thier skills instead of critisizing this recipe. 5 stars!!!!

I made the white cake and to me it had a cornmeal kind of taste to it. I think I'll keep looking for a more tasty recipe.

I used this recipe for a strawberry shortcake and it was really good and moist. I used oil instead of shortening and didn't have cake flour so I subbed 7/8 cup ap flour w/ two Tablspoons of cornstarch for every cup of cake flour. This is the best made from scratch cake recipe that I have tried.

this is great! If you whip the egg whites for the white cake version, the cake (an the batter) turn out deliciously light with a rich flavor.

Fairly dense, I made the white cake. Kind of like a very sweet quickbread. I used 1/3c buttermilk with 2/3milk. I wouldn't use this as a cake recipe again. However, increase the sugar, and cut the cake in half horizontally. Then put on the bottom half a layer of whippedcream/strawberries, and finish it off with the top half. A sort of 'shortcake'

Thank you!  I recently moved out of the country and needed a recipe that had ingredients I could find and made a cake that tasted like home. This recipe offered both.  I had to cook it for over an hour before it was done but I think it is a problem with my oven not the ricipe.

I used this recipe to make pineapple upside down cake.  I used all butter for the shortning and added the reserved juice from the crushed pineapple to the mix.  It made a lovely dense cake with a fine grain.

I tried the recipe for yellow cake. I added chocolate chips and used a buttercream frosting with chocolate swirls, because that is my husband's favorite. I usually use the box stuff, but didn't have a box on hand. This tasted just like a biscuit. A buscuit with frosting. It was really bad. I'm definately NOT going to use this recipe again

Amazing cake!  I halved the recipe and made one 8 inch round cake.  I used all butter instead of shortening.  Cut in the butter with my hands too.  I also used Splenda for Baking instead of all sugar.  The batter seemed really dense, but the cake turned out sweet and relatively moist.  Next time, I'll add a bit more milk and some cocoa to half the batter.

I will never buy another box of cake mix. Over the last 3 weeks, I have baked 3 different cake recipes looking for the perfect one for my daughter's first birthday. I had not found one I liked. I decided to chance it and go with the white variation (I had not tried this recipe yet) and it was moist and yummy. Everyone enjoyed the cake and commented how good it was. I added a little almond extract (as I do to all my cakes) and it was heavenly.

My family LOVED this recipe!  I needed cupcakes for my daughter's birthday and I wanted to make them from scratch so I found this recipe and it was great! I made the yellow cake version.  I kept the oven temperature the same but lowered the cook time to 20 minutes and then watched them and the cupcakes took about 22 minutes in my oven.  A recipe from scratch couldn't be simpler!  Loved them!

I've used only the White cake version, everytime it turned out great. I only use it with cakes that require the cake mix as a base, never for a plain white cake. Simple, and easy storage in the fridge. I substitute the milk with its equivalent in dry milk powder if necessary (e.g. when recipe requires juice in place of water to be added to packaged cake mix)

This was the easiest cake i've ever made!  I first tried the pineapple upside-down cake and it was fantastic.  Then I made a slab cake and decorated it for my son's Birthday.  Everyone raved about it.  I do use margarine instead of shortening.  Excellent cake.

I'm sorry, but I thought this was really bad.  I added an extra 1/2 cup sugar because others said it wasn't very sweet.  So...it was sweet enough, but I hated the texture - I even added some oil to make it more moist.  But it came out kinda icky.  I'm always looking for a good yellow cake recipe...but this isn't it!  Sorry!

Tried the basic yellow version - very dry and blah. The edges were way overdone but the middle wouldn't "spring back" so I just took it out. No one liked it. Must've done something wrong but not willing to try it again.

I can't say enough of how much I love the recipe for the Pineapple Upside Down Cake. It is my favorite recipe and have made it quite a bit, I even made it for my neighbor who told me it was her favorite. She and her husband loved it, she said her husband almost licked the plate =) 

It is so soft and just melts in your mouth, delicious!

This recipe was quick alright but it was not good at all.  I bake cakes all the time and found this one to be very very heavy, tasteless, and just gross.  My kids hated it. I will never ever bake this cake again.

YUM, YUM, YUM!  I made this during a couple of commercials last night and served it warm to my husband with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup.  His response?  MMMMMMMM ....  He loved the "crust" of the cake.  I loved the flavor.  It did take about 45 minutes to cook, but otherwise, the yellow cake directions were right on track.  We'll be making this one often!

I am glad I found this recipe, as this is the one I used to make my children's birthday cake in June. Made a chocolate cake, made sure to read reviews and I am glad I did. After reading over the recipe and reading reviews, I changed up the ingredients as another reviewer suggested and the cake that was the end result was much lighter in color compared to box mixes. However it smelled like heaven, it smelled nothing like box mixes and certainly did not taste like one either. It was moist, crumbled just enough and my kids and family enjoyed it. I will not be buying box mixes again unless for some reason I have too. I definitely recommend this recipe but also recommend reading reviews first. They come in handy.

Easy recipe and  great taste!  Just remember it's not a mix with preservatives, so you want to eat it much quicker.  That shouldn't be hard to do - this is a very good, dense cake :)

this is the first time I made a cake from scratch. I really enjoyed it however, the recipe is asking for too much sugar. If you dont want it too sweet, 2/3 of sugar will do.  I substituted the sugar with cane sugar also. You can use 2% milk  if it is too lumpy add another half cup. Enjoy!

Overall, pretty straight forward  & I had all the ingredients on hand.  I read from another reviewer who's been making this for years to substitute oil, but I wanted to make this as stated before I tried that method.  I melted my shortening to avoid any lumps (not making a biscuit here :) ) Note to self, next time cool shortening slightly before adding to room temperature egg, otherwise, it will slightly cook the egg. Haha!  I made the chocolate cake & the only complaint I had was that when I went to frost it, my top layer (made 2 layers)  started falling apart which I had to add extra frosting to make up for my error.  I baked it for 25 minutes. I may try & cook it longer next time (an extra 3 minutes or so) to make it firmer for frosting cakes.

I followed recommendations and used oil and cake flour. It came out much to dense. The only thing I could think of as to why was maybe stirring it a tad to much. I know better than over stirring so if I did it was not much over. I will try again and be more careful. I was lucky in using cake with strawberry purée and white chocolate cream. It seemed like I purposely made it that way because strawberry short cake is usually dense. I was lucky that's all.

I made this cake and poured over strawberries, raspberries that had been sauteed in butter and brown sugar. It's kind of like an upside down cake. I usually use a boxed yellow cake but didn't have one. This was much better as it is thicker than boxed and absorbed the fruit and juice without becoming soggy or underdone. The flavor was delicious. I changed nothing in the basic recipe. Excellent texture.
I do thin it with a little more milk when not pouring over butter, brown sugar and fruit.
I have also used coconut oil as my shortening. I melt butter when using it as shortening. Best cake ever and easy. Tonight's my first chocolate cake.

It's a super spongy and delish cake. I made the regular yellow following the exact recipe. My boys loved it but to me it tasted too much like muffins. I might modify the original recipe a bit by substituting/modifying a few ingredients to give it a more cake like taste and airy texture as this was a bit dense  for me. I'll definitely try the other variations. Other than that, it was easy and yummy. Definitely making it again! No more cake box mixes for us!

I changed it a bit its super good. I used oil and a cup in a half of milk. I made the pineapple upside down cake came out perfect. I always use crushed pineapple makes it look a bit modern and pretty.

Tasted cakelike, but not like traditional Yellow Cake Mix. Cake was disappointingly heavy; no fluff whatsoever! Will try again though using the 1 cup Milk as oppose to 1 1/2 suggestested in reviews.

Super simple and great to play with! I used it as the base for a lemon-poppyseed cake and it turned out divine! Best part is you can sift together the dry ingredients and then store them for later use. It's my own easy, convenient cake mix, without the fear of soy or dairy lurking within the batter.

Absolutely love this recipe!!! One recipe made 4 dozen mini cupcakes, they tasted amazing!! Everyone loved them! And not to mention they have the perfect amount of density. Not too heavy but heavy enough that people will eat 1 or 2 mini cupcakes and be satisfied!!! Very Very happy!!!

This is a lovely cake recipe.  Every time I have baked it the results have been delicious--including multiple variations.  It is never like boxed cake mixes, thank goodness.

WOW I cant believe my cake worked !!! Im so shocked ... My cakes never work out not even the boxed ones.. Im glad this one worked cuz its my birthday and I baked it for me and the family !! First I sprayed my pan with nonstick spray then mixed 1 stick of melted butter with 2/3 cups of brown sugar and poured onto the bottom of the pan..topped the sugar/butter mixture with pineapple rings..then I thought I messed up the cake batter beacuse I thought I added only a 1 tsp of baking powder instead of a 1 tablespoon either way it looks so good.. I did however use 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup of pineapple juice in place of the 1 cup of milk.. 1 stick of real butter instead of shorting.. 3 eggs instead of 2..mixed the dry .. then the wet.. then combined both dry and wet..then into the mixture I added a smashed over ripe banana.. set the cake mixture asside...and wow it looks so beautiful I cant believe I baked that!! gonna run to the store pickup some cherries and place cherries in the pineapple rings.. Because this came out so good I I created a password and userid now im a member !! LOL added this to my Recipe Box I love this !! Thanks so much..

I followed this recipe to a "T" for the yellow cake, except that I added 1 beaten egg white and I mixed dry and wet ingredients separately and then gently mixed them right before baking.  I baked it all in a single round cake pan and it came out beautifully- most tasty cake ever!!!  WAY better than boxed mix!!  :)

This was very easy to make and was really good. My husband doesnt want me to use cake mixes anymore, he wants the cake from scratch. It was dense but it was still good. I made the homemade peanut butter frosting from this site with the white cake and it was awesome awesome awesome!!

I made the chocolate variation of this cake, it was the most flavorless homemade chocolate cake I've ever had. I upped the cocoa and used oil instead of the shortening, so that I would have a moister cake. I had to smother it in chocolate ganache to give it flavor (chocolate ganache makes everything better) I'll never make this again.

This was excellent, although if I were to ever make one cake out of this I would use 3 eggs.  I also used butter flavored shortening, and was so pleased with the results that I will stick with that next time, too.  The reason I suggest 3 eggs is that my 6 year old wanted to make "chocolate, vanilla and strawberry" cupcakes with the baking set she got today that included a mini-muffin pan.  So, we split the dry batter (flour, baking powder, sugar and shortening) three ways:  added a heaping tbsp. of cocoa for the chocolate; about 2 tsp strawberry gelatin (we used the kind with sugar - if using sugar free, you would obviously reduce the amount) for the strawberry and left the plain as is for vanilla.  Added one egg, 1 tsp vanilla and close to 1/2 cup milk to each batch.  Seriously, the best-tasting, moistest homemade cupcakes I have ever made.  And so easy, my daughter could do most of it herself!  We actually beat everything by hand until the batters were a smooth, pourable consistency.  We got twelve mini-cupcakes of each flavor, plus had enough batter to make a 6" vanilla, chocolate & strawberry marble cake (for Dad!)  So my advice - use three eggs, a little more vanilla, butter-flavored shortening and probably closer to 1 3/4 cup milk total.  Tastes nothing like a box mix, but a great homemade (and EASY!) cake recipe!

This wasn't exactly what I was looking for. It had a dry taste and texture. Wasn't as fluffy of a cake that I would have liked. Sorry, maybe I will try again later and see how it turns out.

Followed the recipe except for substituting oil for the shortening, raw in the middle, tasted like flour will try again with shortening.  I have been problems with baking white cakes lately due to high humidity.  This time i used a different oven just in case.

Good recipe, I used it to make a yellow shaped cake and it rose nicely. I did as one reviewer suggested and changed shortening for oil and increased the milk.  Perfect for when you don't want to or don't have time to get a cake mix.

needed 1 1/2 cups milk, use softened butter instead of shortening (cut to 1/2 tsp salt if using salted butter) comes out perfect every time. often sub extracts, i love lemon.  sooo much better than a box. for pineapple upside down: use as much juice as you can get out of the can and add milk to equal 1 1/2 cups, my entire family requests this cake often. i make this one in my cast iron skillet.

Turned out fantastic!  Kids loved it and it was super easy to make. I did the white cake version and after reading some reviews, substituted the veg oil. It was my first ever cake from scratch, and I will never use a box again! Soo much better!

i made this as the chocolate cake. I did not care for this. No chocolate flavor, it actually didn't taste good and it had a sugar crust like it wasnt mixed right, which i know it was , I did it in my kitchen aid. It baked up very wierd. I added more milk then the recipe called for since the mix was very thick. I wont make this again

I followed this recipe to the letter and I did not like it.  The cake was dry.  It was easily broken as you cut it; it crumbled.  It tasted like cornbread instead of cake.  There was a cake aftertaste however.  I was thoroughly embarrassed at the consistency.  If it was not for our awesome, moist icing, my guests may not have eaten the cake.  I noticed that the individuals before made adjustments to the recipe, and I feel that they may have really been necessary.

Looks like I'm the odd baker out.  While this recipe IS easy and quick, the end result lacks a from-scratch texture and flavor.  I followed the recipe for the base cake mix as written the first time and substituted oil for the shortening the second time.  Both times the baked cakes looked divine.... but even after brushing with a simple syrup and frosting with a chocolate buttercream, the cakes were just fair.  Thanks to Janet, though, for the submission.

This is great.  I made the yellow/pineapple upside down cake.  Did everything according to recipe, except I used tequilla mix instead of milk and I used five 8-0z pineapple cans to bake.  I have a lot of tequilla mix because I am losing weight so not drinking right now.  As for sweets, I find that a little is better than none and much much better than a lot.  I am a 70 year-old bachlor having fun learning to cook from scratch.  I have finally learned that if you want to lose and maintain weight loss, you need to knowm what you are eating and how much.  Sorry, didn't mean to get up on a soap box.

I tried the yellow cake, I've been searching for a yellow cake recipe similar to the box cake mix since I am currently living in a third world country and have no access to box cake mix. This recipe was as close as I've gotten. The consistency was very good but I can't say the same about the taste. Any suggestions on how to make it taste less floury and more cakey? Any suggestions will be appreciated! I followed the reviewers suggestions adding 1/2 cup oil instead of shortening and 1/2 more milk.

Moist and amazing.  I made this once with olive oil which was really good, and a second time with just a few tablespoons of oil and the rest applesauce...Still amazing and less fat.

I made the white version-sifted the dry TWICE, and beat the egg whites as recommended, used Crisco and followed EXACTLY---corn bread texture, taste OK but none of kids at it the party ate it ---I should have used a mix--safer!!

Used this recipe to make some cupcakes and got positive responses from everyone. Used the suggestions and added more milk and used oil instead of shortening. Texture turned out great. I kind of messed up on the egg whites in the beginning but after adding a tbsp. of sugar and 1/8 tsp. of cream and tartar it stiffened correctly. Will try this recipe out again. :)

I'll never buy a boxed mix again!  No reason to!  This recipe is super easy and super delicious.  I used these for cupcakes and they came out soft, light and moist.  The were the perfect consistency and taste.  I tried just the vanilla cake mix, the next time I'll try the variations.  Very pleased with this recipe.

We made the chocolate version.  We are grateful to another reviewer for the oil substitution.  It makes a big difference..the cake was so fluffy!  This was amazingly easy.  I will never buy another cake mix again.

This is a great base recipe.  The yellow mix is fabulous; very fluffy and moist.  I tried the chocolate and I was disappointed.  It needs more cocoa.  My husband didn't even know it was chocolate.  I have been looking for something that I could use in replace of store bought cake mixes and this is definitely it.  It just needs a tweak or two to make it work for me.  No more chemically enhanced cake mixes for me!

I followed the directions and they came out tasting like cornbread!! I have no idea what the heck I did wrong. So, for cornbread it's pretty good but for cake mix it was pretty gross. Did the yellow cake version.

I made this with the suggestions of using oil and more milk and the texture was light and fluffy.  The yellow cake had no flavor.  Great texture, but without the icing this would have tasted like air.

This cake got such good reviews overall that I had to try it. I live overseas and don't have any cake mixes available. I made the chocolate version, following quantities exactly but replacing shortening with oil and mixing first dry, then wet, dry into wet and then eggs (as rec'd by so many reviews).   It was the most tasteless cake I've ever had.   It's a good thing I found a yummy icing recipe.

I was not impressed.  I don't use cake mixes from boxes and I am constantly searching for a good yellow cake from scratch...in my opinion this is not it.  The hunt is still on. I was willing to even give it 2 stars because taste is relative. Too heavy, poor flavor.

The best cake I have ever made!!  Wonderful, and easy!  I did the yellow cake recipe, and doubled it to fit into my 9" round pans.  I didnt know how long to cook them, but the original time was 35 min.  I think?  But, they took a LOT longer, I think check them at 35 min. and put them on for another 10 min.

I just baked a cake for my wife for valentines day.  I used this for the white cake and store-bought mix for the strawberry layer.  I have a three layer cake (heart shaped) with this recipe for the top and bottom layer.  This batter was sort of runny and gelatinous.  It was not as sticky as the store-bought mix.  When it rose in the oven, it did so evenly.  The store-bought mix was NOT an even rise si I had to trim it.  I used Smart Balance oil instead of shortening and dumped in more sugar than what it called for.  The cake was light and fluffy and the crunchy edges were awesome.  I cut those off before frosting.  This recipe is not too much bother and is worth the extra effort for avoiding partially hydrogenated oils.

Wonderful recipe for a basic cake. I will never buy a box of cake mix again in my life. A few changes I made based on other reviews: I used 1 1/3 cup milk and 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice for a yellow cake. I used canola oil instead of shortening and 3 egg whites. It was AMAZING. It makes a simple base for a birthday cake but the effort is what makes it delicious. I topped it with 7 minute frosting and shredded coconut. It's even better the second or third day if there are any leftovers.

so, my brother's birthday is tomorrow, and i figured i would make this cake for him. i did the white cake first, and it was great to work with, except that it didn't rise at all...which was a little dissapointing.  but then i made the chocolate version, and i doubled it so it would rise, its turning out beautiful right now.  all together, a wonderful recipe!  "you can't go wrong with cake mix!"

Thanks for the previous reviews... I just made this cake and used the extra 1/2 cup of milk and oil instead of shortening. It was DELICIOUS!!! I glazed it with the "Hard Chocolate Glaze" recipe found on this website. Everybody loved it!!! THANKS!!!

I used the yellow cake recipe to make a "poke cake" for my daughter's birthday (made by mixing jello mix and boiling water, then pouring over the cake that has been poked with a fork).  The cake held up well with the poured jello over it, and was very tasty using Cool Whip as a frosting.  The whole family loved it!  It did take longer to bake than the recipe indicates.

I used 1/2 cup vegetable oil instead of crisco, 1 1/3 cup milk, only 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and this came out fluffy and so good!!

I followed the recipe as written and took it to Christmas dinner - it got rave reviews.  I even made it dairy free by using soy milk.  This will be the recipe for my son's 1st birthday cake next month.  We can't use box mixes because of the milk.  Love this!

This is a nice simple recipe. I followed another viewer's recommendation and used oil. Once the batter was in the pan I added slices of thinly peeled apple (in rows). I then sprinkled with cinnamon and added brown sugar, then baked for about 40 minutes. It makes a great apple coffee cake.

Very tasty cake! I've made the yellow cake and the chocolate cake, and both were delicious. Very different consistency and taste from box cake, but in a good way.

Yum,never made a yellow cake from scratch.it was nice and sweet,I added extra baking soda and sifted my flour.I did follow others reviews and whipped up my egg whites then folded them in.made for a moist tender cake. I will be making this again the only think I would change is I would add fresh vanilla bean to enhance the flavor.

This wasn't very good.  I made the Yellow cake mix variation.  Turned out very dry was hard to even make it through this cake.  I think it needs butter or something.  I don't think I'll be trying this one again though.

I used the white cake variation. I halved the recipe and used brown sugar instead of the white becuase I didn't have any. I think using brown sugar messed up my cake becuase it was very very sweet.The cake rose alright.Even if I used white sugar I don't think the cake would have been that good because it didn't really have any taste. With some more variations this cake could have tasted better.

TERRIBLE CAKE, GREAT CORNBREAD add less sugar if you want cornbread though, and do 1.5 milk and, use oil its better than shortening in this case (shortening was a disaster) good luck!!!

Great cake, very moist.  I used oil instead of shortening.  I added the juice and pulp of one orange, used 2/3 cup of pineapple juice, 2/3 cup milk and about 1/2 cup of pineapple chunks.  The batter was very watery, but it came out well.  With these additions I was able to make 18 muffins.  Topped with an orange butter-cream frosting, these were awesome.

Great recipe!  Used it for my mom's 50th birthday cake.  Not quite as dense as some people wrote.  Very moist!  My tweaks:  Add 1/2 cup more milk Add 1/2 cup more sugar Add 1 extra egg Add 1/4 cup shortening or 1/4 cup oil OR don't use shortening, use 1/2 cup oil instead

I thought this recipe was WONFERFUL!!!! I LOVE yellow cake, and I thought it tasted devine! It smelled so good before I cooked it that I was tempted to eat the batter itself. Of course, my lovely oven kept turning off(it does that constantly) so it took me longer to cook it than expected, no surprise. I think that it was worth it in the end.

Not quite as light as the box rivals, but really versatile, easy, and tasty. I'll be using this again. DH's favorite cake (yellow) is no longer imported here; I think it has to do with the dye. Anyway, this will be great under my fudge frosting.

I was not as happy with this recipe as I thought I would be. I found the cake to be too dense and I felt it left an oily coating on the tongue. I tried several of the variations with the same results.   I do recommend the Up-Side Down Pineapple Cake version. The denser cake does compliment the pineapple coating.

Made as is with the exception of using vegetable oil and not shortening because I don't like it. Had a cornbread consistency. Maybe I'll try this recipe again but increasing the milk to 1 1/2 cups like other reviewers suggested. Also, I made 1 plain yellow cupcake, 1 plain white cupcake, and 1 marble cupcake using "Black Magic Cake."

This sounds like what I've been looking for to replace a cake mix -- does anyone know if I could add a package of instant pudding mix -- like the cake mixes with pudding. I'm planning to poke holes in the top and then pour a topping of coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk and coconut -- make the sweetened condensed milk from scratch -- easy -- again, we can control the ingredients -- if I add the pudding mix, do I increase the milk?? Thanks if anyone has a suggestion on this.

I'm on the search for a recipe to replace the store mixes I run to, and this one isn't cutting it. I whipped it for several minutes but it was still too dense for my liking and wasn't very sweet. I might give it one more try with oil instead of shortening, as one reviewer suggested.

I made the spice cake variation. It was horrible really dry even using oil instead of shortening. I added about 1/4c extra milk and doubled the spices, but it came out dry and bland. Will not be making this cake again.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe. Very little flavor and an almost dry consistancy. I gave it 3 stars for the way it rised- at least it had a nice crown on it. Also, the chocolate version of it tasted better then the vanilla. I'm begining to think that cakes from scratch are just not that great in general.

Great simple recipe. I tried the upside down pinapple cake, turned out wonderful and everyone raved about it. I went with other reviewer and used oil, almost 2 cups of sugar and added 1/2 cup of pinapple juice. Definately do again.

I have tried making this recipe twice now. I have been unhappy with the results both times. I first tried the chocolate cake. It came out a sort of beige color and was very bland and dry. No one in my family even recognized that it was supposed to be chocolate. I next tried the yellow cake and it tastes just like corn bread. I love corn bread, but not with chocolate frosting! I followed the recipe exactly with the yellow cake and substituted oil for the shortening with the chocolate. It was easy to make and it did rise ok, that's the only reason I'm giving it two stars. I think I’m going to have to keep looking for a scratch cake recipe.

I'd give this a solid 4 stars. It's a good base recipe, but I strongly advise following the other reviews: bump up the number of eggs by 1, use oil rather than shortening, and increase the amount of milk and sugar to 1.5 C and 2 C, respectively. This was the first time I'd ever made a cake from scratch, so I did a trial run, as I was making it for my mother's birthday. It was sensitive (I dropped a pyrex measuring cup while it was baking, aaugh!) and it came out a bit dry. So on the second run, I added 1/3 C of sour cream and it made for a much lighter and more moist cake. Both times, it took longer to bake than specified. This is a decent beginning recipe, so thank you for sharing.

I made the yellow cake recipe and it came out very moist and soft. I made a few changes as someone else suggested: 1 1/2 cups of milk and used oil instead of shortening and it worked out excellent. Made it for my husband's birthday and for a family gathering and everyone raved about it. It was easy, simple and quick which I loved!!

I've been using this recipes for the past few months and I'm pretty happy with it. I need to stress that it is a very basic recipe. I made it as is the first time and it was really dry. I now make sure that I add a package of pudding to every batter and it really makes a big difference. I also don't use shortening, just a combo of oil and applesause(more applesauce) to keep it lower in fat.

I have to say...I wasn't a big fan of how this cake turned out.  I'm a HUGE cake eater too.  Weird!  I followed the directions exactly and used a stand up mixer, but it just wasn't pleasing to me.  I'm giving it a three because it could've been my fault for screwing it up.

I made the yellow cake using oil instead of shortening, increased milk and sugar half cup, used three eggs (as reviewers suggested) and a box of vanilla pudding mix and it was really good!  I have been testing all kinds of yellow cake recipes and this one is the best yet! Next time i might try a little sour cream instead of the pudding and add more vanilla.

This made the best lemon cake I have ever eaten!  There was no artificial taste to it unlike a commercial box cake. I used the directions for a yellow cake (including the vanilla extract) but it turned out pale enough to pass for a white cake.  I used regular unbleached white flour and sifted it several times before and after the addition of the dry ingredients. I followed the suggestion to substitute 1/3c. lemon juice for 1/3c. of the milk. I also added the extra 1/2c. milk and the cake was moist until the last bite.  I substituted olive oil for the shortening and the cake texture was tender with just the right crumble. I also added the extra 1/2c. sugar that was suggested; this balanced the extra tartness of the lemon juice. I made two 9-in cake rounds and they rose beautifully. I had no problem removing them from the pans. Of course, I used the old-fashioned method of oiling the pans and then fitting wax paper cutouts in the bottom of the pans. I used a 7-minute Frosting with the addition of 1 tsp. lemon extract (as well as the 1 tsp. vanilla extract it calls for) to frost the cake. The lemon flavor of the frosting did not overwhelm the cake itself. This cake recipe is a keeper! I look forward to trying all the other variations as well.

I gave this 4 stars because I made a few changes. I made the yellow cake recipe. It failed the first few times I tried it. It collapsed once and wouldn't cook through the second time. Then I used meg's suggestions from below about sifting the flour first (which basically takes the required amount of flour down to 2 cups if it's not sifted) and mixing the dry ingredients in one bowl, the wet, except the eggs, in another, then slowly adding the dry mixture in only whisking until just moist and then folding in the eggs. I also substituted apple sauce for the oil/shortening and now I got a good cake out of it.

Phenomenal, providing you follow FAMILYJEANS' advice. (Oil instead of shortening, and increasing the liquid, in my case 1/2 cup juice).  I made it for the Pineapple Upside Down cake (Using MINI PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CAKES).  Had some extra batter, so I made 12 mini-muffins, topped with maraschino cherries.  Light, fluffy and absolutely perfect.  Why on earth would anyone use a box mix - EVER - when this is easy, fast & delicious?

This cake is wonderful! I followed other reviewers and used 1/2 oil in lieu of shortening with 1 1/4 milk. It was not too sweet of a cake and I loved using only one bowl. My bf loves this with the Chocolate Fudge Buttercream icing from this site, and he hates sweets! Thank you for this great recipe.

I hate to do this.  This cake was dense which I have read is normal for a cake made from scratch.  The taste was a combination of cornbread and shortcake.  It wasn't fluffy and it didn't rise hardly at all.  It wasn't terrible to eat but I added custard and strawberries to the middle since the cake was so bland.

I've tried this recipe several times now... using several of the variations. I have to tell you though, this recipe is missing something. It's neither moist nor is it mouthwatering. I substituted the shortening for oil and that helped. I'm very disappointed though as I wanted a good "from scratch" recipe. This isn't it. Another problem is that there is a subtle after taste to it. I think it's from the baking powder. I reduced the called for baking powder in subsequent cakes, but even in the chocolate cake I could taste it a little. I think of all of them the chocolate or spice cakes have a beter taste than the yellow or white. Another problem I have with this cake is the texture. Because it's not moist it has a sort of gummy or chewy texture instead of a nice light taste. My first bite felt like a letdown after the work of making a cake from scratch. I really wanted this cake to work. I think that in a pinch I might use it again, but would probably look elsewhere. On the plus side, I think this recipe allows you to claim a cake as your own... from start to finish everything you put into this cake is at your discretion. You can alter the taste depending on the flavorings you add or detract. I just wish I could get a better texture from it. I may try it one more time and see if I can figure out a way to get rid of that chewy texture.

a good easy recipe - i decided to try it after i read all the reviews with people really loving it or really hating it. i made the spice cake version with 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger & 1/4 tsp cloves...it turned out really good. i did substitute oil f or the shortening as i didn't have any in the house & i baked it in a 8x8 pan so it would be "taller" & aside from taking more time baking because of the pan i used, i really like this recipe & will use it in the future = )

I made this cake for a girlfriend's bridal shower and I received nothing but rave reviews.  I followed one reviewer by adding 1/2 c more sugar and substituting the shortening for vegetable oil which ended in a very moist and delicious cake.  I also added 1/4t lemon extract and the zest of one large lemon.....SO GOOD!!

I thought this was very good. And a very good idea, too, having a generic sort of cake recipe like this. I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8-inch square pan. I did the spice cake and added 1 tsp each cinnamon and allspice. I used 2 eggs and 1/3 cup milk because I wanted it more eggy. I also just eyeballed the shortening, using what was left of my crisco. It was a bit more than 1/4 cup, I think. I used a bit more sugar, too, reading one of the reviews but that made it a touch too sweet. It baked up with a nice crumb, a light and tender cake. I wouldn't say it was dry, but I was hoping for a moister cake. I will definately use this again. Next time, I'm going to add some applesauce to the spice cake and I think that'll be perfect. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper for sure.

I have been searching for a basic recipe such as this, and I finally found it!  So, last night I prepared the yellow cake version (with some small changes for high altitude baking) for the pineapple upside down cake, and to my suprise my family ate the whole thing. It was delicious!  Can't wait to try the chocolate version.  Thanks!!!

I've made this 3 times now and I think I'm done trying. This last time, I made yellow cake cupcakes and one batch was overdone so I get how people say cornbread flavour but that didn't happen to the "good" batch. Even though one batch was alright I have tasted better from scratch cake recipes so I'll keep looking. The other times I made a yellow cake and pineapple upside down cake. None of them were eaten all up before they went stale so that why I only gave 3 stars: they are edible but not delicious.
I think it boils down to a recipe that is so easy to mess up somehow but if you get it right on they are pretty good.

WOW! This recipe ir so easy and so good! I made the chocolate first, today I made yellow. I will only buy box cake mix now in case I run out of flour or sugar! Very tender cakes! I also used this cake mix when I made cake balls from this site.

I used the white cake option and it was pretty tasty, although I wanted it for a layer cake and it was very fragile and didn't hold up well to slicing through to make the layers.  When I try again for a layer cake I would make two recipes and bake in 2 pans.  It was a very moist cake.

I made the white cake version and was very pleased with it. I used butter instead of shortening, and 1/2 tsp each of vanilla and almond flavoring.
I combined all the dry ingredients in the mixing bowl with a whisk, then added the other ingredients (including melted and cooled butter). Made 24 cupcakes, with tender texture and excellent flavor. I am very happy to have this recipe for reference.

I really loved this cake recipe.  I was bored one night and decided since I had all of the ingredients to make a cake with my 3 year old.  It was easy to make, and so declicious and fluffy.  I used oil instead of shortening, I am never buying store bought cake again!

My new favorite cake recipe!  I used the shortening, plus a 1/4 cup vegetable oil, which made this my moistest scratch cake to date.  I also had to use a little more milk than the recipe called for, but just these little changes made this the best cake ever. Bravo!

I have made this recipe a few times and it came out well.  For valentines day I added 3/4 cup of strawberry jam and some red dye to make mini strawberry cupcakes, which I frosted with a pink strawberry icing.

I'm not really sure how this recipe got such good reviews. I know how to make a cake, and I know that they're not supposed to come out as dry as sawdust, and only 1 inch high. I had to stack the two rounds to make a regular sized cake. I used gooey frosting and a filling, and it still tasted fairly bland. Since I was using a spice cake version I think that is really saying something. I will definately be deleting this one out of my recipe box. I've no use for sad nasty cake recipes.

I made the Chocolate variation.  My ingredients were all fresh except the cocoa.  It was dry and denser than I expected - I'll probably try again and add some applesauce. . .*** UPDATE:  Much better - I made the Pineapple Upside Down Cake variation and it was wonderful!  I added cherries, used more milk as others suggested and added 1/4 cup pineapple juice.  I also used twice the brown sugar for our own personal taste.

I made the yellow cake, with a little bit of cinnamon added for extra flavor. This is a great tasting cake, but it fell in the middle, just like for some of the other cooks. My oven stinks (seems like it cooks at a diff. temp every time I turn it on!), so it could be that. I did beat it a little bit longer to add air for "lightness" but just got a crumbly texture. Next time I'll try the water bath when I cook it.

I needed a white cake box mix to make a cookie recipe (Can't Leave Alone Bars on this site), and since I didn't have a box mix on hand, I used this recipe instead (used all dry ingredients plus 1 tbl milk and 1 tsp vanilla to equal one white cake box mix).  It worked out great for me in that instance, but if I were using it for a cookie recipe again, I'd cut the baking powder in half (but leave it alone for just a cake.)  

Thanks for sharing!  Just what I was looking for!!

Great recipe. I substituted extra virgin, extra light olive oil and increase the milk by 1/4 cup. This base works great with splenda substitute. I made the white cake and used it for strawberry short cake. Everyone loved it!

I made the yellow cake this weekend. My family did not like it at all. The kids wouldn't even it. They said that it was bland and had no flavor. It was also dense and not moist. I followed some of the reviewers' suggestions like using oil instead of shortening, increasing the milk to 1 1/2 cups instead of 1 cup, and beating the mix longer. I will never make this again.

I made the pineapple upside-down cake variation of the recipe. It was really good and easy to make. I used someone elses suggestion and used 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of pineapple juice, also vegetable oil in place of shortening. The cake isn't as fluffy as box mixes, but it's still very good.

I use the yellow and white cake recipe for my base cakes. However I do use the vegetable oil instead of the shortening. After I have mixed and before putting in a pan I always look up other recipes to add to the base I suggest Pistachio Cake II, Orange Cake, or any other recipe in which uses store bought cakes.

I like making things from scratch (you know what you are eating).  This recipe worked EXACTLY the way I needed it to.  I omitted the shortening and used butter instead.  Thanks so much for submitting!  Five Stars!

I tried the chocolate..it was a lot more dense than I was hoping. Not like a cake mix. The recipe on the back of the cocoa box is much more 'cake mix-like', which is what I ended up using instead after trying a few others. :]

Wow! We were out of cake mix (for my dad's birthday) and I didn't have time to run to the store, so I looked online for a cake-from-scratch recipe. This was one of the first ones I found and it is GREAT. My parents even said it was better than the boxed cake mix. Thanks!!

My family really loved this cake.  I've made the yellow cake twice now.  The second time I used it as a base for strawberry shortcake.  It was perfect.  I don't comment very often, but this one was just right for us.  Now if I forget to "buy the mix" I'm all set anyway.  Yumm!!

Made the pineapple upside down cake.  Please... with all that ooey gooey sweetness how can a cake be bad??  In all honesty though the yellow cake alone was not all that great, maybe 3.5 stars.  The taste was good but it was more like a pound cake or doughnut-like texture.  Not at all like the fluffy boxed version.  Like i said, the pineapple is what made this cake and i think for the dollar or two it costs for a box, i'd probably just go with that next time but i'd definitely follow the pineapple variation, cuz it was GOOD!

I wasn't very happy with this recipe (I made the yellow cake). I didn't think it was sweet enough and it turned out kinda dry (I like super moist cake). Sorry but this one just didn't do it for me.

I used canola oil instead of shortening, and made chocolate, yellow and spice cupcakes. They came out the perfect consistency, and they all tasted very good. One batch of batter made 21 cupcakes.

I was spooked by some of the reviews on this recipe so I tried a couple of the suggestions: Subbing oil for the shortening, upping the milk and sugar, and I added some lemon juice for lemon cake...It could have been me, but this was just okay. I'm used to homemade cakes, so I know the flavor is different than the box, and that's a good thing. It came out dense, and tasting like a very sweet bread. Both the texture and flavor were off. Not cake-like. I'm probably not going to be experimenting with this recipe for awhile, but when I do, I'll try cake flour instead of all-purpose. Any other suggestions would be welcome, thanks.

This cake recipe is simply mediocre...I made the cake one night, following the yellow cake recipe exactly, and it turned out just okay.  The edges were crisp while the center was barely done, and the taste was nothing amazing, but it was edible.  The next day I decided to try again, this time using 1 tablespoon of vanilla and a lot of almond extract for flavoring, and a little more sugar...the almond fixed the flavor problem, but it still did not cook well in the middle.  Overall, this cake will do if you're in a pinch--you're definitely going to want to ice it or serve with some fruit or something for extra flavor.

I have made the pineapple cake recipe 4 times, and the vanilla cake twice. Each time had excellent results. Very moist. Also, I substituted canola oil because I didn't have shortening. Cakes were terrific. This is a keeper. Thank you!

Tried Yellow Cake variation with oil substitute for shortening.  Very nice texture.  Edges over-browned.  The taste of the cake is rather bland, though.  maybe more sugar?  Frosting fixes it...

This was, excuse the pun, a piece of cake.  I made the white cake, with the beaten egg whites option and it came out fantastic.  My husband, who before I married him only ate box cakes, said that it was one of the best cakes he has eaten.  I highly recomend this recipe.

This is a good basic recipe. If you are looking for a "box-like" cake mix, this is not it. If you bake for 30 mins you should not have any problems at all.
It's pretty much what a "from scratch" cake tastes like. It is much drier than the box.

I'm only giving this recipe 3 stars because I had to follow the reviewers and substituted oil for the shortening in this recipe and the cake didn't come out looking as I hoped it would. I have to admit the cake taste is very good but it wasn't as light as I would have like it to be. Overall not a bad recipe, just need to make your own adjustments...I tried the vanilla version and used chocolate buttercream frosting on it...I may try the chocolate version and give this recipe a 2nd try.

I made this cake using the spice variation with a walnut icing and sprinkled walnuts on top for a bicentenniel celebration dinner and the people went "wild" over it.  It didn't matter to them whether the cake was "high", they just went back for a second (or third) slice.  I also love the receipe converter as I made a total of 4 of these cakes and it worked really good for serving a crowd.

Wonderful recipe! I love making everything from scratch and i get so frusterated when recipes call for cake mixes because i never buy them! This tasted great and amazingly fast. I also used oil instead of shortening and it turned out great!!! Thank you!

I have been thinking about finding a recipe for cakes from scratch for a while and was finally forced into it because my standard brand add milk ingredients to there cake mixes and I am allergic - I used soy milk and a butter substitute in this recipe.

I used 1 1/2 c liquid, separated my eggs and whipped the whites to firm peaks and folded them into the batter after mixing that a total of 7 minutes (2 on slow, 5 on high). I cooked it on 325F for what turned into 50 minutes.

The cake came out a pale yellow and rose fairly decently. I don't consider it dry but light and it was a littlle dense. The taste was subtle. 

Overall I think it is a good base and will be doing some more experimenting with this recipe and its variations.

I used this to make cupcakes and they turned out fine. I subbed the milk for Buttermilk.  I think I am so used to box cake which is why I didnt love this cake.

This was fantastic, I was sitting here desperatly needing a piece of cake (7months pregnant!!) but didn't have a mix, so I tried this and it was wonderful. I used Cake and Pastry flour and added 4tbsp more. Best of all it was a huge hit with my 2year old, I won't be buying cake mixes again!! Thankyou!

This made a reasonably good version of Black Russian Cake. The crumb wasn't as fine as when I use boxed cake mix, perhaps due to the regular all-purpose flour. But if I ever want a boxed mix, and am again trapped inside due to bad weather, this is it. Will keep it on hand.

I thought this was such a good idea, but the recipe itself is lacking something. I tried both the spice cake and pineapple upside-down cake variations, and thought they were a little dry and tasteless.

Quick and easy recipe to prepare, however, it isn't a great tasting cake.  I tried the white cake version with separately beaten egg whites and it tasted kind of off.  It did, however, make a high cake.  I also tried the chocolate version and it tasted bland.

Definatly won't try this again. I bake cakes all the time and this recipe was one of the worst. The edges baked and were done too quickly while the middle baked much slower.  No volume, Too sweet, No taste and 'very' dry.

I tried baking this cake in a glass pan which was most likely the reason why I had trouble with it.  The edges browned to almost a burn and the center of the cake was not yet done.  I did finish baking the cake so I could at least get an idea of its taste.  It has a good flavor (at least the non burnt center part did) and I will try baking it again in a metal pan.  Overall it's an easy good tasting cake.  Operator error was my downfall...

I am not sure if this should be a 3 or 4 star. It is a great recipe as far as easy (and everything tastes better than a box). But I think butter would greatly improve the flavor. Also, while we got good cupcakes from this, I am pretty sure next time I will use the standard cake method or creaming the butter and sugar, then alternating wet and dry ingredients. I do love that this is from scratch (a real recipe) and I like the variations.

This recipe yields a perfect cake. It's as firm as a box mix & simply delicious. I followed the suggestions of using oil instead of shortening & the additional milk. I also added a heaping dollop of sour cream. I'll be using this recipe for a long time.

I needed a cake mix to make a  pineapple upside down cake so decided to try this.  I used butter instead of shortening and a mix of coconut milk and pineapple juice for the liquid.  I had extra batter so I used a couple of small individual size loaf pans.  I chose this out of the numerous recipes I searched because it called for less sugar.  Even so I believe next time I will cut the amount of sugar.  The mix was excellent for the pineapple upside down cake and the extra cake was great.  The plain cake with no icing would be perfect with berries or fruit and cream.  I will keep this recipe handy to use instead of box mixes.

In the past I always have used a cake mix because I live in a city at 3000 feet and could not get cake recipes to work. I was very impressed with this yellow cake recipe. I added the package of pudding mix, used cake flour, used 3 eggs and oil, and increased the milk to 1 1/2 cups, as others suggested. The cake rose beautifully and tasted great.

I made it as is, Except that I used oil instead of shortening and sifted dry ingredients.  The cake is a little dense, but the taste is delicious. I would not add anymore sugar and next time I will add the additional 1/2 cup of milk so the cake won't be as dense.

I made this cake with butter flavor shortening, 3/4 c milk and 1/4 c pineapple juice. I  didn't notice the pineapple upside down variation till I had already melted my butter and added the pineapple and brown sugar. put it in an 8x11 pan by mistake. Even though it was thick, it was very moist and yummy. It did crack when I  took it out of the pan. next time I'll use the correct size pan. My husband and I both think it's delicious, much better than boxed for sure. Will be making this again. If I had had a yellow cake mix I wouldn't have tried this. So glad I did!

Good idea in theory, but wasn't impressed. Even after reading other reviews, I decided to try the original yellow cake recipe before making many adjustments, except in cupcake form. I did adjust the cook time slightly to accommodate the smaller size and used oil instead of shortening, based on previous baking experiences. It isn't quite as sweet as I was expecting, but I liked that because I often make very sweet icings. Unfortunately, it was very dense, almost pound cake-like. And it stuck to my cupcake wrappers. They peeled away in tiny pieces! I would expect it to badly stick to pans, even after flouring. I'm not sure I'd make this again, but if I did, I would certainly add more milk, as other reviewers suggested. 

Also tried the chocolate version, and it was more dense than the yellow cake.

My cake is cooking currently and it smells and looks amazing. The only problem is that I just realized that I misread the variations for the white cake and instead of using only 3 egg whites I used 3 egg whites and 2 whole eggs! I misread what she wrote. I hope this doesn't mess up my cake lol. I added extra milk an extra half teaspoon of vanilla. And I reduce the sugar to 1 and 1/4 cup. also I used oil instead of shortening.  with all these changes I can only give 4 stars. *update*so I tried it today and it tastes exactly like a pound cake was a little bit less sugar so I just sprinkle some powdered sugar on top and it tastes great. Too bad I messed up the recipe I just wanted a plane in white cake.

I have tried both the yellow and the chocolate variations.  Both turned out great! This yellow cake has become my go-to need a cake in a pinch recipe and living in a country where hospitality is paramount, that is really saying something! Thanks for the easy to follow recipe featuring simple ingredients which are truly available just about anywhere!

Yum - made with 1.5 cups milk.  Otherwise just as written for the chocolate variety.  Yummy.  Not dense, no problems.  And best of all simple with standard ingredients.

i am revising this recipe down to 1 3/4 cup flour, and replacing shortening with 3/4 cup unsalted butter. also a dash more vanilla and a sprinkle more sugar. 
so... if you are DEAD set on using this recipe listed above, please be cautious of your flour... :)

I made the Yellow cake, took the suggestion from another review to use oil and 1 1/c cups of milk, and it turned out great. I've mad a few cakes from scratch, and this one was the best so far. I think however the cake it self needed a little more sugar, but everybody else seemd to think it was fine.

Awesome Recipe.  This cakes tastes like it came from the bakery!  Reminds me of a European recipe or wedding cake. It is a denser cake but comes out delish!  I made no changes to this recipe and it made a beautiful birthday cake!  Can't wait to try out some variations, i.e. lemon, or chocolate.  thank you very much!

I made this recipe today [yellow cake with organge extract] but I made one important change: the way the batter is mixed. I hate to cut in and thought there might be a way to avoid it.  Here is the streamlined version: Wisk together/stir together/sift flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder in a large mixing bowl.  Make a well in the center and add shortening, milk, extract, and eggs. Mix on low for 1 minute, scraping bowl as needed. Increase mixer speed to high and beat two minutes longer, scraping bowl down as needed. Pour into prepared pan and bake. The cake was light,moist, and tasty.  Adding more or even double the extract is not a bad idea; my cake was very lightly orange flavored.  I read a number of reviews and have some suggestions for those of you who had trouble with this recipe:
1.  Check your baking powder. Is it outdated? Also shake your baking powder before measuring it or it may not leaven correctly.
2. Time yourself when mixing.  You may think you've mixed the batter for 2 minutes, but have you really?
Try this recipe--you may never open another box of  cake mix!

THIS WAS SO GOOOOD!!!! MY family loved it.  I did as the directions said for yellow cake.  Because I saw the blended batter a little thick I added 3/4 cup of pear juice (I was originally going to add the pineapple for upside down pineapple cake but I only had canned pears.)  DELICIOUS!! I cooked it for 35-38 minutes. Thanks!

As mnay have already pointed out this is a great base recipe on its own, however for a tastier and less dense versions changes are best . For me, I used the cake flour and sifted it along with some of the dry ingredients. I increases the sugar by half a cup which I added to the dry, the remaining sugar I creamed with 1/2 butter and 1/2 cup of oil. I then added 3 eggs and 1 tsp of pure vanilla. The I added the wet to the dry and folded them together, just adding enough milk to get the right consistency, definentialy not a cup of milk, 1/3 at the most. note the consistency was smooth and on the runny side. turned out great

i gave 4 stars because i put my own spin to this. i did 3 substitutions all the same amount though. i traded the shortning for butter, vanilla extract for almond extract and white sugar to brown sugar. turned out amazing and ohhhhh so yummy! it's got a great sweetness to it, especially if you're not the biggest frosting fan like me.

For Independence Day, we decided to make a cake -independent from a box! (we also forgot to buy cake mix and my kiddos were begging for a cake)

We made the yellow cake, substituting Saffron oil for the shortening and added a bit more milk (soy milk, actually).  The cake fit in one 9" pan and needed about 33 mins in my electric oven (I lowered the heat to 325 after 28 mins)

Topped it off with icing from scratch (no-egg butter cream, which was awesome) and it was  huge hit.  Denser than the typical box cake, but delicious!  We're never going back to the box!!

I am completely aware that this is my fault and in no means the recipe, but I made the lemon cake variation and it was not good at all. all I tasted was the baking powder. I am sadly known for my cakes tasting like baking powder or baking soda. I don't know what I am doing wrong. I even put half the amount of what was called for.

It was not to my expectation during the 1st try, though my friends commented that it was still nice. However, for the 2nd time, I did what 1 of the reviews mentioned, and add the dry mixture to the wet mixture instead of the other way round. The cake turned out much better than before!

oh man, LUSH! I used oil instead of shortening (without converting g to ml), a shot of rum and a squirt lemonjuice;   I put all the "wet" ingredients together and quirled them and in another bowl sifted all the dry ingredients together - combine, mix and mine had to stay in the oven a little longer than 30mins ...crunchy outside but FLUFFY inside.  I cut the crunchy top off of this one (still got eaten on the side) and spread apricot jam on the soft top, banana slices, a little chocolatey stuff, banana slices and cover with rest of chocolatey stuff.. quite sweet. delicious though :)

Made the chocolate recipe and got 72 mini cupcakes.  Used 1/3 cup instead of 1/4 cup cocoa powder, but I shouldn't have because I also added 1 cup mini chocolate chips and it was a little much.  Did as another reviewer said and used oil instead of shortening, but only because I don't like using shortening.  Topped it off with a cream cheese frosting and it was perfection!

I don't know how anyone can give this recipe less than five stars. This is the most moist cake I've ever made. I do use oil instead of shortening, and I usually make the yellow cake. It's WONDERFUL!! Also, very quick and easy to make. You'll never be able to go back to boxed mixes after trying this recipe. Thanks so much.

I made the pineapple upside down cake variation and it turned out great.... EVEN though i had to scale down the recipe and made only half. hardly any cake recipes can stand being cut in half and still come out fluffy and moist as well as perfectly risen! its a keeper

I made the yellow cake and it was awesome , very fluffy and moist . I think it`s unfair to compare this with the cake mix , this cake has a fresh taste without too much sugar . I used oil instead of shortening and 1 1/2 cup milk (as recommended by other reviewer) . the second time I`ll try to make an orange cake by adding 1 cup of milk + 1/2 cup orange juice + orange peel , and I`m going to update this. thank you for the this nice recipe

Awesome I used one of the suggestions instead of shortening use oil worked very well. So much better than using a box.  I made the white cake and the spice cake and layered it with banana pudding for my son's bday party.  It was a hit everyone liked it.  Not so good on decorating though but my 2 year old didn't care about that he liked the cake very much.

This cake turned out great!!  I have baked lots of different cookies from scratch but this was my first cake and I was quite proud!!  After reading the reviews I did as others suggested and used oil instead of shortening, added an extra 1/2 cup of milk, 1 extra egg, and I also used a pack of chocolate pudding mix.  My husband and I both don't love anything too chocolatey, and this fit our needs!  If you are a chocolate lover, I would suggest either adding more cocoa, more sugar or maybe even some semi-sweet or milk chocolate morsels.  Next time I make this cake (or cupcakes since that is what I did this time) I will add more sugar as reviewers suggested.  THANKS JANET!

Very disappointing. Made 1 exactly as stated in the recipe and it was flat, dense and absolutely tasteless. Tried it again and tweaked it as stated in the reviews.  I will stick with my tried and true Company's Coming cottage cake recipe. I am sorry I wasted my time and ingredients.

I thought this turned out really good.  I did make a few changes... I used flavored coffee creamer instead of milk, used 2 cups sugar, and used oil instead of shortening. I did mine as cupcakes, which are going to be turned into mini ice cream cakes, and they are sweet enough that I personally don't think they need any frosting on them.

so this is definately a good basic cake mix. I also used oil instead of shortening and it came out much more moist that way. Also the suggestion made to beat the eggs with sugar until they form peaks then folding them in helps. And of course guys and gals don't be afraid of lumps when making a cake they are in fact your friend!

This was the first time I used this recipe and will definitely be the last.It was simple to make, but wasn't very tasty, even though i added a bit of extra vanilla, and hint of cinnamon. Not to mention it took about 15 minutes longer to cook then the recipe stated. Also it was VERY well done on the outsides and not cooked in the middle by the 25 minute mark.

I was surprised at my first attempt to make a cake from scratch how easy it was. I used the recipe as stated for the white cake and it turned out perfect- I was making a layered fondant cake so it was a good texture for cutting in half to add the filling. My roommates were hovering over me while I trimmed the cake and eating the scraps which they said were absolutely delicious! I will use this recipe and its variations in the future

I tried this as a yellow cake.  Something wasn't right.  Maybe it was the shortening?  Not sure, I doubt we'll use this one again.

This cake required some alterations from the beginning, and after making it with them, I wish that I had amde a few more.  I made with all-purpose flour that I sifted, subbed in veg. oil for the shortening, and increased the milk to 1 1/2 C., upped the sugar to 2 C., and added an extra egg yolk (I was going for yellow).  The consistancy of the cake (or in my case cupcakes) was perfect.  Light and fluffy.  The flavor was still bland, and was lacking.  The color was also still very white.  I am looking for an excellent cupcake recipe, and this just isn't it.  I will keep tweaking, it's not a bad starting point.

If you are looking for cornbread recipes, look no further. Although this recipe claims to be cake, it takes like cornbread. Good cornbread- I'll give you that. But quite honestly, I was looking for cake. If you are looking for cake and have stopped at this recipe, I highly recommend that you KEEP LOOKING.

As others suggested, subbed oil for shortening, cake flour for regular, and increased milk by 1/2 cup.  Made a darned good cake!  This will be my new all purpose cake mix recipe.

I have used this recipe for about a year now and even substitute Splenda for the sugar for my Mother-In-Law which is diabetic. (FYI: If you use Splenda, add about 1/4C more of milk) We just love it. We do use butter instead of oil as others have suggested. All out, a great recipe.

Have made this recipe many times, either as a sheet cake or cupcakes, and it turns out great every time.  The only change I make is to use canola oil in place of the shortening.  I'm not comfortable with the ingredients in box mixes, and I've had trouble with other cake recipes, but this one is easy and always works for me.

Oh my gosh! this was the best ever!!! I used this recipe to make a rhubarb upside down cake for my husband's 50th birthday. I usually use a cake mix, but don't think I will ever do that again!! I followed the directions for the pineapple upside down cake and used 2 cups of rhubarb instead of pineapple. I added an extra 1/2 cup of milk like other reviewers suggested. I cut back on the sugar too. Everyone at his party raved about it! It really was awesome and I don't care for fruity stuff. Can't wait to try this again.

I bake and cook almost everything from scratch.  I understand the importance of proper measuring and freshness of ingredients and I did not care for this recipe! To much flour not enough sugar and were it reads cut shortening till crumbs form.  I found there not to be enough shortening for crumbs to form.  Even while baking it smelled like bread.  I strongly don't recommend.

This will be my standard cake recipe! So easy and way better than boxed cake. However, I did follow the suggestions above - 1 1/2 cups milk and sunflower oil instead of shortening. Also, I used a flour combination that promised to create a tender cake and it worked: Substitute all the flour for this ratio, 2 parts flour to one part corn starch. An allrecipes user suggested this on another cake recipe and it worked beautifully. [I think for this particular recipe I used 1 1/2 cups flour and 3/4 cup corn starch, which is a little less than called for but it was great.]

I made the yellow cake variation, and used this recipe to make cupcakes.  I'm not sure why a lot of people said the cake is dry.  I found mine to be very moist.  Though I did consider using oil instead of the shortening (as a lot of people recommended), I stuck to the recipe, and I'm glad I did.  I did use butter-flavor shortening, as that's all I had.  I hate using boxed cake mixes, so I'm always looking for good home-made cake recipes.  This, for sure, worked for me and produced a very good yellow cake.  No complaints here!  Thanks Janet!

this was so good!!! i even messed up and put baking soda instead of powder in it and it still tasted great. I did put oil instead of shortening after reading everyone's comments. I liked it! I will definitely be trying this again. Hopefully I'll get it right. I can't imagine it tasting any better! [I paired it with the "grocery store frosting" on this webstite] it was so wonderful!

I made a birthday cake for my dad's 53rd birthday. The cake was dry within hours and I didn't forget a single thing! Someone on this site suggest substituting OIL for SHORTENING and adding extra milk. I think I will try that. Because if I do it this way my cake will be a brick within hours.

I just made this recipe into White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cupcakes!  Thank you to everyone for all the ways to create variations.  I swapped the shortening for oil, used three eggs, whipped the egg whites...added 9 oz of premier white chips and 4 ounces of chopped macadamia nuts. They are divine! I could not have made them if it was not for this recipe! Thanks Janet!

I really didn't care for it and neither did my husband. I made the white cake for cupcakes. I did as other reviewers suggested and used oil instead of shortening and added more sugar and milk. My cupcakes came out way too packy. They were not fluffy at all. It wasn't dry though, which alot of other reviewers mentioned. I gave this recipes 3 stars because they weren't inedible, but I will probably never make this again. I think box mix would've been way better.

This is the best homemade yellow cake recipe I have ever used.  Per some previous reviews I replaced the shortening with oil and increased the sugar to 2 cups.  It was REALLY good!!!!!  Will definitely try again.

i used the yellow cake mix option to make mini pineapple upside down cakes.  i took the suggestions to use oil instead of shortening and an additional 1/2 cup of milk.  very easy, delicious and moist.  i really have no reason to ever buy a cake mix in a box again.  i hope to try the other variations listed here also.  thanks so much for the post!

Followed the yellow cake recipe. Not bad at all. Not as sweet as I wanted. There was something off, but with a little frosting and sprinkles it tasted fine. Overall, I'll be keeping this in my recipe box just in case I don't find a better recipe.

I am not sure if i did anything wrong in making this recipe but it turned out horribly. It could of possibly been b/c i used butter shortening..but i doubt it...i followed the recipe exactly...it just might of been an error on my part somewhere. I'm going to try it again and see if it turns out the same way. Best of luck to everyone else who tries this recipe.

I hate doing this but after I caught both my mother and my oldest daughter giving each other funny looks I had to ask them what was the matter with the cake.  "Nothing" they both replied, "nothing but  a glass of water or anything wet could help wash down this dry cake".  They did say it in a nice way but I was shocked!  Then my husband said he agreed but was afraid to say anything to me!  Utter mortification!  I followed the recipe as written and read all the reviews from other members so I that I couldn't go wrong.  Sorry, but I will definitely not be making this cake again.

The flavor of this is wonderful.  I attemtped to make a pineapple upside down cake and used this recipe, following the instructions in the 1st review.  It tastes wonderful and is nice and moist but I had a huge problem with it not getting done in the middle.  After baking it a bit longer, I finally scooped out the gooey raw part from the middle and put it back in the oven all by itself so as not to dry the rest of the cake out.  The outside part was perfectly cooked, my middle just wouldnt get done.  My oven is not completely reliable, so I will blame this on my oven, not the recipe.  After the middle part finally got done, I just dumped the whole thing in a pan and will cover it up with whipped cream.  Looks pretty bad, but tastes really good.  I will make this again.

I chose this recipe b/c it looked easy and had decent reviews. I am not sure why it had such good reviews! I followed the chocolate cake variation to the T, and it was just not good. 2 stars because it was edible- but it was so dry and crumbly and flavorless. Most certainly will NOT make this again.

I have to say I really like this recipe. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the end result came out more like a pound cake. I wanted my cake to come out more lighter and fluffy. Oh I also used oil instead of shortening. Though my cake did not come out as light and fluffy as I wanted I will just use this recipe for pound cake.

I loved this recipe! I used the yellow cake variation. I didnt have a few things though.. like the sugar, instead i used about a cup of kool-aid mix(the kind that has sugar mixed in) & a squeez of honey, also some french vanilla creamer. I also used baking soda instead of powder. And I did use oil instead of shortning... But over all I am very happy with my results, me and my husband just moved and its his birthday today, I was worried I wouldnt be able to make him a cake or anything, but this worked perfectly.. its just kinda has a fruit punch taste, its interesting but still really yummy. I made cupcakes so in the next batch im using white chocolate chips and I might try using cherries in another!

This was my first attempt at making cake from scratch.  I took reviewers suggestions and substituted oil, and increased milk and sugar by 1/2 cup; cooked for 30-35 mins.  I made the chocolate version.  It rose beautifully and texture was nice (between dense and fluffy).  Looks great, but the taste is too bready/floury, so it definitely needs frosting to cover it up.  I like how versatile it is in that you can make different variations.

I made the yellow variation per the recipe the first time. The second time I made changes as suggested by another reviewer. I increased the milk a half cup and used canola oil in place of shortening. The 2nd time was awesome, they came out light and fluffy. With the changes this recipe becomes 5 stars easily!

It was alright. However it left something to be desired and cake mix would've actually been a better option for taste.  Try the Simple White Cake w/ and additional 1/4- 1/2 cup milk, and beating/whipping at every stage for a true homemade cake.

What an easy mix from scratch! I follow some advice and used oil instead and upped the milk to 1.5cps. I also added almond extract and poppy seeds and made them into almond poppy seed cupcakes, for a fast brkfst. Rated it a "****" because I haven't tasted them yet.

Okay, to be fair I would give it 3.5 stars. This is an ok cake. I did the suggestion of the vegetable oil for the shortening and upped the milk a 1/2 cup. This is a very basic recipe that will yield you a somewhat dense okay moist cake...not a fine crumb and not light and fluffy. Almost like a quick bread recipe in texture. It would work good as a pineapple upside down cake I think. If you're looking for a cake for a special occasion...this IS NOT IT. =)

Used reviewers suggestions by adding 1 1/2 cups milk, used cake flour, and oil instead of shortening. It is moist and very easy. I do wish it had a little more flavor. Definitely not perfect, but it is good. And better the next day.

Easy recipe, love 1 bowl.  As usual,  wish I had read the reviews before giving this a try!  Found cake to be a bit bland and lacking moisture (but not too dry), will sub oil & add extra egg next time as many have suggested.  Thanks for the recipe!

I took the suggestion from ATTENDEDKARMA 0n 10/30/05 and used flavored coffee creamer for the milk I made Choc,choc chip hazelnut cupcakes I sifted all dry ingredients twice,used 3 eggs1/2 Cups milk 1tsp vannila 2 C sugar. I should have used less because of the sugar in the coffee creamer and 1/8 tsp salt  I made these into cupcakes-baked @350*convection for 22-25 min.  They are light fluffy moist-delicious and worthy of 5 stars oh yes,1/2 c veg oil

This is a great recipe, not only because of how great it tastes, but how easy it is.  I make the yellow cake, and it turns out fantastic every time.  I do substitute oil for the shortening, because I usually try to avoid shortening if I can.  I have also substituted water for the milk when looking to make a non-dairy cake, and it still turned out great.  Overall, a simple, delicious recipe. Thanks!

We have several allergies to deal with so store cake mixes don't work for us. I just substitute egg replacer and soy milk and it works very well- this is our recipe of choice  for birthday cakes

I've tried the yellow and chocolate recipes and they are great. I used the yellow cake recipe for Pineapple Upside Cake and it came out very moist. I used the chocolate variation but added fudge and cherry topping in the batter to make cherry chocolate cake and it came moist , even now four days later.

This is an excellent recipe with its variations. I made the pineapple upside down cake which was my first upside down cake. I did change the shortening to Crisco butter flavor and my cake was so fluffy which I was really surprised. The best thing about this recipe was not all that creaming butter and sugar. This cake was a breeze. I will be using it quite often.

I was not very impressed with these recipes, they need a lot of tweaking. For some reason the yellow cake mix tasted more like cornbread cake than regular yellow cake mix. The chocolate variation did not have the grainy cornbread consistency but probably would taste better if chocolate chips were mixed into the batter to make it richer.

I made the basic yellow cake recipe and it was AMAZING. It turned out perfect and moist- just like the box cakes for a whole lot less money and with a whole lot fewer preservatives. I loved it! 
Next time, I'll try to make it somewhat healthy by subbing some of the oil.

I followed the directions exactly and this was the most wonderful, moist, a tiny bit dense cake I've ever tasted.  I don't think I'll ever use a box cake again.  I used it to make the pineapple upside down cake on this site and it couldn't have been any better.

Oh my goodness, where has this recipe been all my life?  I hate to think that I've been wasting my money on cake mixes when this was within reach.  I tried the white version and it turned out beautiful and tastes even better.  I didn't make any alteration and it was still perfection.

Using some of the suggested alterations (oil in lieu of shortening; bit more milk and sugar) I have to give this five stars. I wanted to make the 'Banana Upside Down Cake'  from this web site, but had no box-cake mix. So naturally I ended up with this recipe. I baked it up in a Large Round Stoneware deep dish baker. It took about 15 mins longer than the recipe called for but I'm not sure if that's due to the stoneware or the Banana-pecan-butter-brown sugar-heaven at the bottom. Anyhow, Good recipe... moist and dense; how "Cake" ought to be!! Thanks for the recipe and the suggestions!!

I just made this cake (the chocolate version) and I had my first piece.  It is incredibly yummy!  I used the suggestions of others and substituted oil for the shortening and increased the milk to 1 1/2 cups.  It was very moist and dense.  Not crumbly at all.  I don't have a sifter so I mixed all the powders together really well with a fork.  I will definitely be making this again!

Like others, I substituted oil for the shortening, and was very, very pleased with the result.  Big ol' dome-y yellow cakes perfect for layering, and totally delicious.

This recipe is a great base to start from.  I think the consensus is oil instead of crisco or butter and a little extra milk doesn't hurt. I have to say though, I did the white cake as the recipe suggested and it was a perfect density for poking and brushing the layer with grand marnier. I would definitely recommend sticking to the recipe if you plan on adding moist centers.  I added this to my recipe box instantly. Happy cooking!

Made the chocolate recipe when I ran out of cake mixes in the middle of creating my youngest son's birthday cake. I needed something quick since the pan I was using needed to be fuller. This mix was easy and quick. I can't rate the texture since I swirled it with a box white cake but we couldn't tell which was which. I may never buy a box mix again.

I've made this cake dozens of time, usually with either oil or butter (whichever is more convenient) and think it's a fabulous recipe.

But recently since I happened to have shortening on hand when I made it, I used that since it is in the original recipe.  I was actually a little disappointed with the cake texture and immediately went back to oil the next time around since it gives it the best texture (moist and not too dense or gummy) in my opinion.

Overall, this is my favorite cake recipe and the one I consistently turn to when I need to bake.

It was a great recipe.  I did not use shortening.  I used oil. I only use shortening in pastry. Other than that it turned out great. Thanks.  I had a hard time finding the recipe on this site.  Wish the title was changed.  The search function on this site didn't find it, but google found out when I gave up and went looking elsewhere.

WOW! This is a great recipe! I just took the cake out of the oven and my little helpers (2 & 6) think it is yummy! We havent even frosted it yet! We made the yellow recipe and the cake rose great...nice golden brown only baked for 25 min just right. After I let it cool a quick minute we cut into it and it was moist and very tasty! NO CORNBREAD HERE!!!

This cake is so very delicious! If you're expecting the same loft that you get from a boxed cake then you'll be disappointed as this cake is more dense. But I prefer it for it's simple ingredients (no fake stuff in this one) and wonderful taste. Plus it's much easier to decorate a cake that's more dense- I made it into a bunny cake for Easter. I did substitute butter for the shortening because I never have that in the house and it turned out just fine.

I have tried a few of these cake mixes.  They are awesome.  Yes they are a little more dense than your box cake but.....I have had no difficulty at all slicing the layers in half to make a 4 layer cake.  Everyone is always impressed!  I have filled the layers with strawberries, bananas, custard....the denseness of these cakes holds up very well.  Try making layers out of a box cake which is too light and airy. Box cake mixes---history!

I think this is a good basic recipe, but I'm going to try changing a few things the next time I try it.  My yellow cake fluffed up just fine and did have a good texture, but did come out a bit dense and flour-tasting.  I'm planning to try the spice variation next time and I think that'll help.  I used oil instead of shortening, but I think I'll try using butter with the next one to add to the flavor a bit.  I'm also going to try adding more milk as others have suggested, too.

Texture was great, I beat it longer than specified. I made the yellow cake version. I know other reviewers have said homemade cake batter shouldn't taste like the boxed mixes but the flavor was just, strange. Cornbread is the only way I can describe it.

This was ok. I liked the texture but as far as the taste it was not that great. I guess that is why you frost it. I will try the choc. next to see if it is any better. I hope so.

Thank goodness I used a great icing recipe. I used the Wedding Cake Icing recipe from this site which saved this cake. I made the yellow cake recipe and must say it tasted like CORN BREAD. I was not really that impressed and it slightly sunk in the middle. Several other people from the party said they like it...but I don't see myself making it again.

I used the yellow cake recipe instead of a box cake mix to make a rum cake (also from this site).  It was delicious!  I used butter instead of shortening (no trans fat).

I made the pineapple upside down cake. It came out moist and fluffy. I replaced the shortening with 3/4 cup applesauce. I initially added 1/2 cup applesauce, but the flour didnt crumble like the recipe stated, so I upped it to 3/4 cup.

Surprisingly very good and not hard to make at all...  Of course, it is a little more dense than boxed mix and doesn't stay soft quite as long, but all in all, very good.  I made the yellow cake...

I used this recipe to make my first ever scratch cake and used the chocolate variation.  IT IS SO GOOD!  It is a different texture than a box mix, but not at all in a bad way, it has much more substance so you can actually taste the flavor and the cake. 
The only drawback is that i would have liked a richer flavor to the chocolate.  It still tastes great though and I will use this again.

I made the yellow cake tonight and it was great.  I used canola oil in place of shortening.  I may never buy another cake mix again.

I was dared by a friend to make a cake from scratch. I chose this recipe, but I wasn't optimistic that I could do it. However, it wasn't difficult, and the cake -- oh, my gosh! I never though a cake could taste this good. I feel as if I've been in a cake slumber all my life, and this one woke me up to the possibilities!

I had never made cake from scratch prior to trying out this recipe. I'm very happy with the way it turned out, but I don't think it's the best cake out there. It's a little too sweet, so next time I'm going to try lemon extract instead of vanilla. It looked beautiful poured into my rose cupcake pan, though!

This was okay to me . Maybe it was something I did but the cake was a little too firm for my taste. I just like my cakes fluffier I guess.

I will be using this recipe from now on, since one of the major brand of boxed cake mixes has transfats in it. I made the chocolate version. I added 1 & 1/4 c. milk, 1/3 c. cocoa, 1 pkg. instant chocolate pudding, 1/2 canola oil (could have use 1/2 c. applesauce) and 1 c. sugar. I baked it in a bundt pan for 38 minutes. Very, very good!!

Okay, I read the reviews before I made this cake, and really dislike the fact that people give a bad review on something that they themselves tweek a little.  I tried this recipe, and it is alright. It is even better when you add frosting.  I thought it tasted an awful lot like johnny cake.  Even my husband asked me if it was made with corn meal.  He said he had to take a second piece to make sure.  He liked it more than I did, but overall it is not too bad.  I am probably too used to the box mix. Also, why don't you heat your milk when adding shortening.  It works as well as oil.

I made this exactly like the recipe except I made it into cupcakes. They were so good. This will be my only recipe now for cakes. I plan on using some of the suggestions that were made also. Thank you for a great recipe. 
I just made the chocolate. Wow I just love this recipe!

This was ok.  Not great, but better than nothing.  I used oil instead of the shortening and I used 1/2 cup of half n half in addition to the 1 cup milk.  I still think a box cake is better.

I made two cakes from scratch from your recipe and they both came out very dry.  Next time I will add cream cheese to the mixture to give it the moisture it needs.  I will try again.

Well, I had to try this recipe out w/some subs based on what I had in the house since things are tight.  I used 1 egg but made up for it with a 1/3 cup mayonaise and 1 tablespoon flaxseed ground up.  I always try to throw flaxseed into my breads and cakes so that the family is eating healthy despite themselves.  I also used 1/2 margarine and 1/2 olive oil instead of the shortening.  I used powdered sugar instead of granulated and I used sour cream instead of milk.  I decided to try the chocolate version so I added some cocoa mix w/those mini marshmallows in it.  The cake was beautiful and moist and fluffy but a bit on the bland side.  I will try it again with a closer stance to the original ingrediants.

Frosting:  I used powdered sugar, sour cream, margarine and cocoa mix.  Its the most creative I have ever been in the kitchen when things are tight.

OK - my tweaks - 1/2 c. butter, 3 eggs, 1 1/4 c. milk, didn't have vanilla, 1/2 c. sour cream, added 1 package cook & serve vanilla pudding and 1c. coconut. Creamed butter, sugar and eggs, then alternated dry ingredients and milk/sour cream. Frosted w/ coconut buttercream frosting. Baked at 350 for 50 minutes. Perfect! Light, fluffy, no too sweet.

Well, I wouldn't have tried this recipe if it wasn't for everyone's suggestions.  So, I took the advice and used oil instead of shortening.  Then, because I wanted the flavor, I also added the vanilla instant pudding.  But here's where I got adventurous:  I didn't have any baking powder, so I used the internet to find the substitution of baking soda plus plain yogurt.  I added that, plus 1 cup of extra milk for creaminess.  The cupcakes cooked up quickly.  They're moist, but they need the icing for some flavor.  I used the majority of the batter in a shaped pumpkin pan.  It's not dense, or dry; it just doesn't have much flavor.  I probably will keep looking for a recipe that has more flavor.

I reduced the sugar quite a bit...and my cake turned out SALTY!!!! And so I checked my other cake recipes and others do NOT have SALT inside of them!! I think I will try reducing the salt next time to maybe 1/2tsp or even 1/4tsp! My "cake" tasted like sort of salty pancakes... :(

I followed the suggestions of others and used oil instead of shortening. I also used cake flour (a.k.a. soft wheat).  The cake was light and moist and didn't taste like preservatives which is a plus in my book!  It could be a little sweeter but than again I don't mind cutting back on my sugar either.  I WILL be making this recipe from now on.

I made the white cake variation twice - once with oil and once with shortening.  Each time it came out dense, not really moist and disappointing.  As for the flavor adding almond extract makes all the differnce. I must be doing something wrong since everyone raves about it so I'll try again.

Eh, not too good.  I think I'm going to stick with my old standby, the Hershey's Chocolate Cake on the back of the cocoa box...replace the cocoa with flour to make yellow cake.  And for white cake I use the recipes from this website.  Sorry, I don't like giving bad reviews.  This just didn't taste very good!

I love this cake!  I made the yellow,and,like one person suggested, I used oil instead of shortning, and it turned out great.  I also made the white version whith oil, beat the egg whites seprately first, and then baked it in two 9 in. round cake pans.  I made this one for my husband for our anniversary, and he thought it was sooo good.  I'm going to use this recipe all the time!

Really good and very easy!  Nice flavor and texture.  I used butter crisco instead of regular shortening. I did have to bake it longer than suggested though.

It was just ok. I used oil instead of shortening and the cake is moist, but there's something missing.  Maybe it needs more flavoring?  Or maybe I should've whipped the egg whites separate from the rest of the batter then folded them in to make the cake lighter?  I think this could work better with some tweaking, but for now I'll just need to look for another recipe.

I have only tried the chocolate cake mix from this recipe and it turned out excellent.  Taste was great, too.  I will definitely try the other variations.

WE loved it! I exchanged 1 stick butter for the oil. It had a great consistency, so I could slice it in half lengthwise, fill with whipped cream and peaches, top with other half, and poke it so it would soak up on a 3 milk mixture I like to add to my cakes ( 1can evaporated, 1 can condensed and 1 can table cream), so it was a great "3 Leches Cake" base. YUM!

It was an easy and quick recipes. I made the yellow cake in the recipes. I follow the suggestions of others and added 1/2 cup milk to the batter. I should of used the oil, instead of shortening (I saw the suggestion after putting in the shortening). It was still a bit dry. The cake needs more vanilla, since it tasted a bit like corn muffins rather than yellow cake. It also had a bitter after taste to it, and i follow other people's suggestion. I will probably not make this again or at lease not the yellow cake.

I made the chocolate version of this cake. It had good flavor, but the cake did not keep well. By the second day it was far too hard to be enjoyed by anyone. I will not try this recipe again.

Very good - I will make it again.
I added cocoa, white choc chips and coconut and it was yummy.  It was dense, but way better than a cake from a mix.

The cake was okay, but like others, mine came out really dense. Normally we finish off cake pretty quickly, but I ended up throwing away about half of this one. I made the white cake variation. My mother said to try cake flour but I'm mot going to be able to do that for a while. Maybe then I'll give it a try. (:

turned out ok. but would recommend that the temperature be reduced to 160C. turned out light and fluffy. Have used this as a base for our rhum cake. very versatile recipe. As a base for other cake recipes, this simplifies the guesswork. very good

I used the dry ingredients and the vanilla as a base for the Screwdriver Cake on this site.  It was very convienent and saved me a bit of money and time going to the store.  It's a cheap substitute for most recipes calling for cake mix.

I have only made the yellow cake version and it had a very good flavor, however, I found the cake to be very dry. I also had to cook it a little longer than the recipe called for but that could be because every oven cooks differently or because I used the baking strips.  Again, I really loved the flavor so I plan on trying some of the variations in the reviews to help make it more moist. If anyone knows other ways to make the batter more moist I would love to hear them.

I make this as a white cake all the time.  My family loves it!!  It best when the egg whites are beaten before they are added.  It makes the cake lighter.

I made the yellow cake version, but thought the cake was very bland.  It was only saved by the ButterCream frosting recipe that is also here at allrecipes.com, which was VERY sweet.  Sorry, but I think I will keep looking for a cake recipe.

It was quick, easy, and delicious! I made it as a brthday cake for my cousins,and they were asking for extra slices (they usually don't like the way cakes taste).

The taste of the cake is good.  I made the basic yellow cake.  The cake didn't raise that well and took a long time to bake.  The edges got done quickly while the middle just didn't want to cook.  At first I tried to make cup cakes with this and I know now that it's a big mistake.  After they were done and cooled, I tried to take them out of the paper and it was almost impossible.  I won't try this recipe again.  Oh well :)

I was scrambling to find a recipe after I botched up a boxed mix.  Only I could mess that up.  This recipe was so easy and so good. since I somehow didn't mess it up it's a definate keeper for me.  I did find it to be a very dense cake, almost like a bread, but it was good for me!  Oh, I made the yellow version.  Yummy!!

This was very easy to make and it is very delicious. My family enjoyed the yellow cake, plain without any frosting. It didn't last long on the table. I can't wait to try the other variations

This makes a very dense, but very tasty cake--I used the chocolate option, and it turned out well!

I wanted to make a homemade cake for my son's birthday and I saw this one.  It was excellent, to say the least.  Everyone at his party loved it.  I have also made the pineapple version and it was just as wonderful!  I will use this from now on, no more store bought cakes for me.  Thanks for sharing.  Candie

Love the versatility of this recipe!  Don't be afraid to experiment with it!  I made the white version with almond instead of vanilla, try it with a fudge-like frosting.
