I used the ingredients and amounts in the recipe except for using two chicken breasts. I pounded them lightly to make for equal thickness and an instant-read thermometer reached 180 degrees in about 3 minutes per side. I sweated the onion sliced very thin in the remaining butter for a couple minutes before adding anything else to the skillet. Made the onion a bit sweeter and a little easier to digest. For the mustard I used half Grey Poupon Country Style and half Mister Mustard an extra-pungent Dijon-style product. Next time I'll probably forego the Mister Mustard and use just a bit less mustard overall -- The mustard's piquancy was quite pronounced though pretty well balanced by the sweetness of the applesauce. Next time I think I'll also increase the amount of wine and cream to maybe 1/3 cup each. Reason: The sauce though very tasty became quite thick and really ceased to be "saucy". I'd like it somewhat thinner. The walnuts added a really nice crunchy texture. I wouldn't hesitate to make this for company!

Pretty good! Definately use a red onion it gives a little bit of sweet to offset the strong mustard! I used dijon mustard and it was still quite pungent. Maybe using less mustard and somehow incorporating bacon would make this a 5star but as is a great 4 star. Thanks!

Made this for supper the other night and already had the chicken cooking when I realized I didn't have any applesauce. I used peanut butter instead and hoped for the best. It still turned out pretty good but I can imagine it with the applesauce mellow and sweet. I also added a small can of sliced mushrooms to it. I will make it again with or without the applesauce!

I've been looking to add a little excitement to chicken and thought this recipe was outstanding. The only change I made was to leave out the walnuts as I'm not a fan. Thanks for sharing I will make this again.

This was really good. Slightly sweet from the onion but also savory. The sauce was thicker than I thought it would be - a nice consistency.

This is so good! Great flavor. My husband loves chicken w/ apple or mustard and this combines both of those very well.

I made 2 small changes - I lightly coated the chicken in flour to help it brown and create a nice visual contrast with the sauce and I changed the fat to half butter half olive oil. I then doubled the recipe and served it to some old friends who were practically licking the plate! Will definitely make this again!

I used some red and yellow onion I had already cleaned in the fridge used milk in lieu of the half&half and left out the walnuts. I S&P'd my chicken and roasted it in the oven then did the sauce separately and topped the chicken with it while serving with rice. The fam and I didn't care for it but a lingering neighbour liked it alot. It's alright but not for us.
