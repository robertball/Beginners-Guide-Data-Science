I had all the ingredients on hand, and decided to give it a whirl (no pun intended). I use a vitamix and for this reason didn't bother chopping the kale. This is bursting with berry flavor so you don't even know there are green (gasp) veggies in it! The cocoa powder is not so detectable. I would suggest the maple syrup can be passed - the smoothie will get sweetness from the berries anyways. I've added this to my recipe box and will remake it but for my own preference will be using reduced calorie/sugar apple juice, and will omit the maple syrup...possibly replace it with agave syrup. Thanks for posting!

I make a lot of smoothies. Usually my husband and I both like the recipe, sometimes I like it and he doesn't and vice-versa. This time neither of us liked it. He thought it was bitter. I thought it was anticlimactic.  It is fiber filled though.
