I made this bread twice in the last week; that's how good it is. I added walnuts and raisins because I am a nut lover. I found that it was a too sweet for my liking so the second one I made I reduced white sugar to 1/2 cup. Next time I make it I will take out the white sugar altogether because it was still sweeter than I like. Maybe it was the raisins I added.
An absolutely great recipe

My husband said this tasted more like banana bread - which works for us, b/c I'm not sure I could've gotten him or the kids to eat zucchini bread.  ;)  But it's a great recipe to use up the extra zucchini from the garden that we can all eat - my son is allergic to dairy and eggs.  The only change I did was to sprinkle cinnamon sugar on the top before baking to give it a crispy crust.

Delicious!  I substituted some carrot and green apple for part of the zucchini and baked in muffins.  Turned out awesome!

I followed the ingredients and directions exactly but the loaves turned out to be solid, wet bricks.  Looked great when I took them out of the oven but then sank.  I threw all of them in the garbage. As I've said, I followed the directions to the tee -- but if three people gave this recipe 5 stars, I'm thinking that I screwed up somewhere.  Help!!!!!

I thought this was delicious! I cut the sugar down by about 1/3 and I would prob reduce it even further next time. Great way to eat fruit and veggies in a delicious bread!

I read the review about the bread coming out to wet, so I made sure to drain the zucchini really well.  When I first took the bread out of the oven, it looked and smelled great.  When I cut it the next morning, it was really wet and dense.  I had to throw it away.

Great recipe! I halved the recipe, and used applesauce in place of bananas, and it came out great with 60 minutes baking time. I may have used too much applesauce, the batter seemed too wet, so I added 1/4 cup additional flour.

Excellent, moist delicious zucchini bread. I used chopped walnuts in mine and actually used 4 C zucchini therefore I had to bake it a little longer than it said, but it was really really good and very moist.

I was making this this evening for my daughters preschool (vegan is a necessity). I am a trained pastry chef and baker. I am also a professional caterer. I have only had this happen once in my career of 20 years. They are wet and flat! I would like to figure out what is wrong with this recipe. And fix it. I am very sorry to give you this rating on such a wonderful idea. I followed it to a T.

My 1st ever vegan bread and it was great!  Sweet, dense, and moist as others have said, but scrumptious!  I might cut back on the sugar and oil as others have done on the next round.  I halved the recipe and did not pack the zucchini to measure it.  The zucchini is very wet, so I'm thinking if you add too much zucchini, you will get the result others found and end up with a wet, heavy loaf.  Mine did surprisingly well :-)

I tried this recipe a few years ago and absolutely love it!  This is a moist bread and absolutely delicious.  I'm actually looking forward to make this again for Lenten Fast where I follow a vegan diet.  

The only difference in how I prepared it is that I had SHREDDED the zucchini (as you would mozzarella for pizza).  I did not grate it. Perhaps I ended up using less zucchini as a result of shredding?  I did not pack it in the measuring cup.  For those that find it to be a wet brick, perhaps that is the cause.

The whole family and a bunch of coworkers loved it. (I also used the same size pyrex pans)

Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Happy Baking!

Followed directions exactly...baked an extra long time to try to get the wet out - couldn't hack it.  The bread was super dense, wet and gross.  This was my first failed banana-type bread ever.  Sorry - wanted to like it.

Substitute more apple sauce for oil. This was amazingly tasty and moist (I hate that word, but still...)
