To give it 5 stars, add cumin.  You can also layer this in a pyrex dish and bake at 350 for 45 minutes.

Awesome! I was suprised at how good and creamy this was. If you are looking for a lower cal/fat alternative, use light sourcream. The cream and soup make a suprisingly cheesesy consistency. Leave the cheese out altogether or sprinkle it on after its done and you've tasted it. You will be suprised. You dont even need the cheese. I used a can of tomatoes with the green chilies inside w/ lemon, then chopped up a tiny bit of green chile for added bite. (If you dont like spice, skip added chile). Used 1/4 tsp. garlic power instead of garlic clove and cilantro cause I had some.

This is my families new favorite dinner.  I used Pilgrim Prides Eat Well Stay Healthy lime chicken breast.  They are precooked so you simply heat them up in the mircowave and chop them up.  I also substituted Rotel, drained, for the green chili's and used jalapeno sour cream dip for 1/2 the sour cream and added a can of black beans, drained.  The tortillals will get mushy if you leave it in the crock pot too long.

This was okay, but I don't think I'll make it again.  It's a lot of food; it filled my 6-quart slow coooker.  It was easy enough to make, but there wasn't anything special or unique about it.  

The recipe didn't specify what size tortilla to use, so I used soft taco size.  Seven on each layer was far, far too much.  I ended up with hard, dry tortilla layered between soupy cheese.  
Also, the combination of sour cream, cream of chicken soup, and chicken needs something to kick it up.  One 7-ounce jar of chiles is not enough.  I added 3 tablespoons of hot chili garlic sauce, and that made it more distinctive.

Also, the recipe specified 15 chicken thighs, but not the amount of chicken breasts.  I used four large breast, and that was not enough; I couldn't taste the chicken around all the tortillas.

If I were to make this again, I would half everything, use 4 chicken breasts, and add some mixed vegatables.  Over 800 calories a serving is a lot, and I personally don't think it's worth it.

This is a great recipe, but it needs a little added zip.  The first time I made it, I used pepper jack cheese and offered diners jalapeno peppers and taco sauce on the side.  The second time I made it, I put in about 2/3 of a jar of Mrs. Renfros Green Chile sauce.  I made it for a church potluck and it was a hit!  Definitely a keeper in our house, with the added help.

I loved this recipe.  I ended up cooking it in the oven instead of the crockpot and I used corn tortillas because my family likes the corn texture better.  This is almost like a recipe I used to make, but the addition of the sour cream makes it much better.

My fiancee actually wanted to eat this 2 nights in a row! That NEVER happens! When we were making this, we left out half of the tortillas because it seemed like to much- DON'T! I wish I's put all of them in, and will do so next time. And the time after that, and the time after that... I'll be making this again.

A great "throw together" dinner!  Like other reviewers, I spiced it up, adding chili powder, cumin, and habanero. I did not have any black beans on hand, so I added a can of "Grillin'Beans" (the Santa Fe style), which worked out well. I cooked it on high for only an hour and half.The final result was a tasty cross between a flavorful rib-sticking, creamy chunky soup and a Mexican stew.  I plan to experiment with adding more liquids as I think it has the potential to be a great tortilla soup!

I give this 5 stars, my hubby and I devoured it.  I did make some changes.  What I made fit into a 9x13 casserole dish.  Boiled 4 boneless chicken breasts, then cut them in half and shredded with two forks.  In a bowl combined 4oz cream cheese, one 10oz can cream of chicken soup, 8oz of sour cream (gradually add sour cream to cream cheese then add other ingredients), half a packet of taco seasoning, shredded chicken and two cups of cooked minute rice (precook rice so it won't absorb the soup mixture).  Used the pizza cutter to cut tortillas into bite size pieces.  Lined dishes with half of pieces topped with half of mixture, sprinkled with some taco sauce and covered with half of cheese, and repeated this one more time ending with cheese.  Baked at 350F for 30 min.  Excellent!!! A recipe we will be making over and over.

We loved this. It served 5 adults and a couple kids. I have more of a narrow and tall slow cooker and I made three layers instead of two and I used a few less tortillas. I also used chicken breasts...I would probably use about 5 next time. I also added a little taco seasoning to the chicken.

Love it!  Love it!  Love it!  It has become a favorite at home and a request for any pot-luck I go to.  I have made it straight from the recipe and other times I have made some substitutions. Either way it is a hit.  Got to love a crock-pot recipe that goes against the grain of just meat and veggies!

I've been making a similar dish in a casserole pan for years and we love it in our house. One easy thing to do with the tortillas we've discovered is to put them on a cutting board and cut them into smaller peices with a pizza cutter. It's faster than tearing them by hand.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I was pleasently surprised that the tortillas were not soggy.  I didn't use Monterey Jack cheese, and will have to next time as I believe that it would have added to the flavor.  This is definetly a keeper in my house.  Thank you.

This was a good base for a chicken enchilada casserole in the crockpot.  I used rotisserie chicken to save time.  I also added taco seasoning to the sour cream, as well as cumin and chili powder to the chicken mixture.  Next time, I think I'll had some chipotle and adobe sauce for some much needed "heat".  I also found this recipe to be SUPER salty, so next time, I'll be sure to use low-sodium soup and 2% cheese.  This was in the crockpot for 5+ hours and it still tasted fine - - not soggy.  BTW:  As written, this would feed an army, so be sure to scale it down if cooking for less than 10.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Trista5.

I thought this was a great recipe! I used cut up chicken breast, diced tomatoes w/ green chiles instead of just green chiles, and a can of sweet corn. I didn't add the tortillas to the slow cooker since they get soggy however I used the tortillas at the end filling them w/ the mixture. My husband and in-laws loved this recipe, I look forward to making it again.

I added black beans and cumin, but it still lacked flavor. It wasn't soggy at all and very tasty, just a little bland. It also makes a huge dish so be careful if you only have 2-3 to feed, leftovers will last a long time!

I used a different ammount of chicken.. I used 6 skinless boneless chicken breasts, betweeen 10-12 oz of Sour Cream, only 16 oz of Cream of Chicken soup and about 6-7 Small Corn Tortillas and about 1/2 can of the 7oz Green Chile Peppers. My family loved it it fed 6 Adults and 1 child.. plus a little left over, I served it with Rice & Beans. Its great an some of my family does not like the food to be spicy so it was just perfect.

So I did a couple things differently. See I made a quite similar casserole in the oven using tortilla chips instead of flour tortillas, adding a packet of taco seasoning to the sour cream/cream of chicken/green chili mixture. I did layer the mixtures w/ chicken and cheese between tortillas and top w/ green onions, I thought I had a can of black olives but I didn't, I love black olives, so I am sad I didn't have them, but I loved this recipe. I live along and cook for 1, and I ate on this for days, almost finished it myself. As far as the oven version of this, if you're interested in making it, use the same ingredients, layer the chips on the bottom, then spread the soup mixture on top, I like to chunk up some velveta on top of that, cover w/ a thinner (than the bottom) layer of chips and then top w/ lots of shredded cheese. Bake at 350 for about 20 minutes until the peaked areas are browning and it's bubbly, and you're good to go.

I like trying out recipes on unsuspecting friends.  I made this for an office luncheon, and it turned out well.  I did follow others' suggestions to add some spice to chicken meat, and also added some black beans and corn.  It made a lot!!  I used 9 chicken breast halves instead of thighs.

Good Recipe, but I needed to add more spices. I know that they were trying to stick with the white theme, but I just had to add black beans!

We use large (burrito size) tortillas and I only cut up 10, and didn't use all of those. This recipe probably should specify tortilla size. With only 3adults this recipe has gone far, 2ate for lunch next day 2for dinner day after that, and I think there is still some hidden in back. 
Want to try Colby-Jack cheese next time and maybe a smidge of taco seasoning next time but no complaints. Everybody loved it & the kids were mad they had made other plans bc they wanted to stay for dinner after a sniff and a glimpse  :D

This recipes was ok.  Nothing special.  I made it exactly as the recipe called except for scaling down the ingreiants to make less servings.  While the taste was good, it was somewhat bland.  It's a good starter recipe.  If I made it again, I would ad some taco seasoning to the chicken and maybe some  diced tomatoes.  Also I will agree with another review in that it honestly doesn't need the cheese.  The soup/sour cream mixture was good.  I honestly didn't even taste the cheese much, so I don't think I would have missed it.

Great base recipe. Added pkg of enchilada seasoning and w/sour cream drained of excess liquid, added big splash enchilada sauce. Corn tortillas allow for more enchilada sauce. Like to add onions also.   Great for football get together!

This was very good. I baked it in the oven instead of the crock pot. To reduce the fat and calories,  I used reduced fat soup, fat free greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and reduced the amount of cheese. I also added some taco seasoning.

This was really good!  I added chicken taco seasoning to the sour cream and chicken soup mixture.  Unfortunately, I didn't have enough tortillas (forgot to check) so I made the chicken mix in the slow cooker and made burritos out of it.  Yum, Yum, YUM!  I will be making this again and will make sure I have enough tortillas next time!

I have to say, I followed this to a tee and it was a big disappointment. First visually it just is not appealing which and it is definately lacking in the flavor department. Made it for my whole family and no one liked it, even my husband who pretty much likes anything. If you are considering on attempting this recipe, I urge you to read the other reviews and follow their suggestions. I have never rated a recipe as low as this, but I have never been as disappointed. Again...read the reviews and take their advice and suggestions. Good Luck!

Not a fan.  It did end up soggy even after I used corn tortillas.  I think it would have better if I used tortillas chips or fry them up first.  I think I would have used more cheese like it asked and maybe enchilads sauce.  I won't make this again.

This was a great recipe! I didn't quite have all the ingredients it called for so I added some of my own. I put way more cheese than it calls for because we love cheese, I also added tomatoes, and El Pato brand tomato sauce to give it a little kick. I left out the cream of chicken soup to let the other flavors be stronger. I cooked it on high for 4 hours and it was perfect for that evening!

Not enough meat for my husband who loves his protein.  I was not a big fan either.  Maybe it would have been better cooked in the oven as one reader suggested and using corn tortillas instead of the flour, they were soggy.  It was just too soupy.

Delicious but I changed everything to fat-free (sour cream, condensed soup), except the cheese, and suffered no loss in taste and it was much healthier.  Served with green salad tossed with verde salsa and apple cider vinegar.

YUMMY!!! New family fav. Made this last week, only change I made was using white corn tortillas as opposed to the flour. Now, I boo-booed and forgot to plug in my slow-cooker. By the time I realized my mistake, it was too late to expect it for dinner that evening, so I put in the fridge for the next evening's meal. Held over well. Would most definitely recommend!!

5 stars for easy prep,  I took this into work and got rave reviews.  I thought it could use a little more zip.  I may add some cumin or something else next time I try it.  All in all -- Great recipe, all my co-workers asked me to forward it to them.

This dish was a hit for the whole family. Even my picky daughter ate it. I did change the recipe a bit though. Since some people said the tortillas got too soggy I decided to bake it. I split the entire recipe except I used the entire amount of green chiles. If you like things spicier you may want to add something to spice it up. It is very mild (which I like) Also for the chicken I cooked them in a pan with oil, garlic, salt, and pepper.

I loved it.  My husband loved it.  And anything that we both love is bound to be a keeper.  I only drizzled a little salsa (leftover from a taco dinner kit) over the top of the cheese for a little more flavor.  I also used a Mexican cheese combo.  But the tortilla didn't burn or get too dry or too soggy--just perfect.  Thanks!

This was a great recipe. I did read the reviews and added some salsa and cilantro to the soup ingredients, this gave added flavor. I put all the ingredients into the crockpot the night before and was very pleased that the tortillas were not mushy.
I am going to made this again and again.

I made this when my hubby was out of town.  My teenager LOVED it!  I split the recipe in half, but he'd have eaten more if it was available!  Definitely a comfort food! 4 stars is only because my hubby didn't get to taste it!I exchanges 2 bnls breasts for the chicken and used just 7 of the tortillas. Cheddar is good mixed w/ the monterey Jack as well!

A little less soup and some extra diced chili peppers would make this much better. I used low carb tortillas and it was pretty good.

For this recipe I substituted some garlic powder for the garlic, and dumped in way to much.  Other that an over-powering garlicy flavor, this was a pretty good dish.  My tortillas were not mushy, they actually retained their consistancy fairly well.  I might add some cheddar next time, for color as well as flavor.

This was an easy recipe that turned out great. I added a little more cheese (who doesn’t love extra melted cheese on enchiladas?). I cooked it for 3 1/2 hours and I would recommend letting it sit for about 10 minutes to get a little structure to it otherwise it will be a little “soupy.” I will be putting this into rotation. Bon a petit!

I halved it, added dried onion, garlic, and cumin. I also used fat free soup, and extra sharp cheese.  I put it in th oven for 35-40 min because of time. It was great and kids loved it. It's just 3 of us, so I have the perfect amount left for 2 lunches for me this week. Next time I'll try the crockpot!

Sprinkle with red pepper flakes and serve with (or even over!) tortilla chips, YUM! cheesy chickeny goodness. 

instead of layering it i just tore up the tortillas into strips and mixed it in.

Did not like this.  I thought there was too much soup and not enough tortilla.  My husband liked it more than I did, but I didn't even want any leftovers.  I think some sort of red sauce would have added some acidity and more depth.

Excellent recipe!  I did not have tortillas so I mixed all the other ingredients together, added 1t. ground cumin, 1t. chili powder and let it cook in the crock pot.  Smelled wonderful and when it was finished I added a little corn starch to thicken and served it over wide egg noodles.  Everyone loved it and asked me to make it again!

I sauteed a chopped onion with the garlic, then browned the chicken before adding to the slow cooker. I also substituted Campbell's Southwest Style Pepper Jack Soup for the cream of chicken soup, decreased the green chile peppers to 4 oz & left out the black olives. This had loads of flavor & was even better as leftovers the next day for lunch!

Easy to assemble and pretty good flavor.  I may add some seasonings if I make it again.  I loved the creamy texture but craved more flavor.  I took this to a pot luck and everyone enjoyed it.  I didn't bring a bit home.

I actually changed up this recipe a bit the last time I made it.  I found a chicken chile verde soup and used it instead of the jalapenos and cream of chicken soup.  It gives it a more mellow flavor and cuts down prep time even more.

I made this last evening.  I've never had a more tasteful meal with a Latin flare.  I did add two-7oz. cans of green chilies with diced tomatoes into it and added extra shredded cheddar as a topping to complete my casserole, but otherwise the original recipe was great!  And yes, I will make this again for my family again soon.  Thank you for the recipe!  LMB

Very good recipe. I took some of the suggestions from others. I used four large chicken breasts added a small amount of corn, small amount of rice, a large can of creme of chicken and a small can of creme of corn. I also added two small cans of green chilies and hot taco seasoning. 

Baked it at 350 for 45 minutes and it was delicious. will make again.

No leftovers with THIS recipe!  I used about 2/3 package of the rotisserie chicken already packed from Costco.  Added 1/2 jar Trader Joe’s Salsa verde along with one can diced green chilis.  Substituted one can of cream of mushroom soup,  along with the one can of cream of chicken. (10 oz.)

This was my first crock pot dish that wasn't velveeta queso. I was very excited to make it. I left out the olives because my husband thinks they are the devil. And added the cumin recommended by another reviewer (which I think really helped it.) 

I will probably make again but at more green chiles and maybe some thing else to add some color to it, though I'm not sure what yet.. tomatoes? peppers? I accidentlly used all white cheese and it came out looking extra white which wasn't very appetizing to me.  

My 1 year old loved it  and my husband said he liked it. Though sometimes I think he just likes not having to worry about what is for dinner. ha.


Updated: I made it again and this time I marinated the chicken before cooking it and didn't boil it but rather let it simmer with some extra peppers and green chiles. I also used additional peppers in the crock pot. I went with tricolored pre-chopped but still fresh and the color and taste was much improved. 

Marinade was made from lime juice, cumin, garlic, EVOO , salt and pepper and a teeny dash of cayenne. I didn't want it to be too hot for our son. It was all just kind of on the fly so I don't know how much of anything I used bit it tastes great.

This came out pretty tasty. I halved the recipe and added a dash of cumin as suggested by other reviewers. I put this together in a 9" x 11" baking dish and cooked it in a 350 degree  oven for 45 minutes.

I make this regularly, my family loves it. The  improvements I suggest are using precooked fajita chicken (I use 1 lb) and adding a can of drained black beans. I add about 1/2 cup milk to thin the sauce a little, and prefer to leave the olives off.  I also put a little sauce on the bottom of the crockpot before laying the tortillas.

i also agree with putting it in the oven. the chicken is already cooked so 30-40 minutes in the oven would do.

Only made half quantity as not too many of us.  White Chicken is a misnomer as thighs were used but they are my favourite part anyhow.  Had several cans of whole pitted olives so chose not to slice them and mixed some in with the creamy layer.  As well, added some jalepeno peppers to the mixture.

This was super simple and really good! I did add about 1 teaspoon each of cumin and chili powder to add a bit extra flavor. I would definitely make this again, as this was a great meal to pop in the crock pot early in the day and taste great!

Made it in the slow cooker, and followed all directions. It was mushy. The tortillas became slimy layers of goopy dough. The chicken was tough. It needs substance: beans, rice, tomatoes, onion, etc. It needs spices. The meat was tough because the instructions say to pre-cook the thighs, and they would have been better slow-cooked instead.

I added a bit of cumin & salt to the chicken mixture and baked this in a glass baking dish sprayed with Pam for 40 minutes or so. I've made this twice now and my son really likes it. Could also work as a dip without the flour tortillas. Thanks for sharing!

Could be 5 star with some changes. 

First, boiled chicken doesn't impart much flavor. cut into strips and cook it up with some onion and garlic or just blacken all sides then chop it up. 

Second, seasoning?! Cumin, cayenne, season salt, onion powder, garlic powder - yes please. 

Third, you should never use flour tortillas for a baked (or slow cooked) dish - it results in soggy tortillas which are very unpleasant. Use corn tortillas and it will be far far better - even corn tortilla chips would be better than flour tortillas.

These changes could make this into a far better dish.

Edit: If you are lazy like me chopping up some pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from Kroger works well too! Easier than cooking it yourself and if you get the right flavor its a winner.

I love this recipe! A few adjustments I  made: I boil chicken in seasoned water (salt, or whatever you prefer), if not, the chicken is bland. And instead of using flour tortillas I use corn tortillas.  Gives it a reminiscent taste of tamales!

Made this quite a few times and rarely make it the same way twice. But what I found was a great change, is using restaurant style tortilla chips. Delicious with a little crunch between layers! And I add a bit of medium salsa to the sour cream/chicken mixture.

Amazing! I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1 1/2 cups sour cream and 1/2 cup cream cheese. I also baked it in a 13x9 pan and used corn tortillas because we liked them better. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it. Used cream of celery and added fresh spinach. Great used as a dip  as well. Simply left out flour tortillas. A new favorite!

I did this recipe in my Ninja slow cooker and placed frozen chicken breasts on top of 1/2 the tortilla's and layered as shown on the recipe.  I also added 1/4 cup of taco seasoning to the sour cream mixture.  I cooked this for 9.5 hours on low, stirred when I got home from work and added the olives and scallions and a thin layer of thunder jack cheese.  This meal was a favorite with the family!

I've tried making these in both the crock pot and the oven.  Both are excellent!  I use pepperjack cheese.  My family calls these "pepperjack enchiladas."

I added in some extra chili's, some salsa & some hot sauce, and cut the sour cream in half.  It was very good!  My husband had it for dinner and enjoyed the left overs the next day.

I read all the reviews and spiced the recipe up with salsa, cumin, jalapeno pepper (1/2), chili/lime spice and black beans.  Taste was great but it was a mushy mess.  Okay for just us but wouldn't serve it to guests.

This is my hubby's favorite dish!  This recipe makes ALOT of food. I do change it a little... I leave out the green chiles and put in 1/2 cup hot salsa instead.  I add in extra black olives, onions, and poultry seasoning.  I also try and get Sargento's Mexican Cheese with dried jalepenos... hard to find but wonderful!  I serve this with spanish rice.

This recipe made alot more than my slow cooker could handle. I only used about 1/2 of the chicken breasts (they were pretty big ones) & I shreaded the chicken instead of cutting it. I made my slow cooker & had enough stuff left over for regular enchiladas the next day. I also took 3rd in a casserole cookoff :)Thanks for the great recipe

This was very good!  The garlic added a nice flavor.  I did modify some to reduce fat/calories, by using plain yogurt, 2 (10 oz.) cans of Healthy Requests  Campbells, and less olives and cheese.  I only used 3 jumbo tortillas, and it would have been good with more.  Next time I will try using even less cheese, as it really does taste cheesy!  I would be happy to serve this at a potluck or for company.

This was OK. It was pretty mushy and didn't have as much flavor as I'd hoped. I think it has potential, and if I make it again, I'll probably reduce the amount of soup and add some veggies to give it some texture.

This wasn't our favorite.  I used the Chile Verde Soup in place of cream of chicken, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I added diced green chiles too and I thought it still needed more flavor.  he tortillas on the bottom layer were dried out and nearly burnt, even though I only cooked it 4 hours on low.

I liked it a lot and my picky husband gave it a thumbs-up.  I used a regular size can of soup and less sour cream and put it in a 9 x 9 pan. Cooked it in 350 degree oven for 45 minutes and it was perfect. I'm sure I will make this again.

Gloppy mess from the slow cooker so took much of it out and baked it with crushed tortilla chips for about 25 minutes.  Had company here so was kind of put off by having to punt to make this look like a casserole dish.  Flavor, however, was good.  Was saved by making lots of appetizers from this site: stuffed jalapeños & artichoke/spinach dip-both excellent.

I used canned chunk chicken and shortened the prep time considerably.  I chose it because I needed a bland meal for my sensitive gut, but my family could add whatever they wanted to spice it up.

Enchiladas are my favorite Mexican food.  This recipe was great and easy to make.  I did vary the recipe a little by adding mushrooms.  I also mixed everything together and layered with the tortillas.  I also added sour cream on top of the finished product.  Great meal and easy to fix.

This is sooooo good. Comfort food all the way. However, take a good look at the ingredients...the measurements are crazy. This is what I did. Three bags of Tyson cooked chicken. Two cans of cream of chicken soup, Two pints of sour cream. A bag and a half of cheese. Two cans of chilis and one of the black olives. Delicious!

We found that the tortillas went to the bottom and got burned. So We switched to rice. Otherwise a great main dish. There very little leftovers.

The only thing we changed was baking it in the oven. It was fantastic and a big hit at the dinner table. I will definitely make it again.

Family loved it. I rolled the chicken ingredients into flour tortillas and put in the oven for 30-40 min. Also added 
4 oz cream cheese  and fiesta seasoning. I Will be making this again.

I started preparing this too late to use crock pot, but was delicious following directions but layered in a deep casserole dish and baked at 375 for 45 minutes and cooled for 10 mins. Before it was completely devoured by my family. I will definitely fix this again and again and vary ingredients. I’ll add black beans next time and fresh cilantro and maybe jalapeños. SOooo good!!

This was very good, with the modifications I made:  Corn tortillas rather than flour (12 of them), rotisserie chicken rather than cooking my own, bottom and top layers of the chicken & soup mixture (4, with 3 layers of tortillas), and to the chicken soup-mixture I added:  1/2 jar of tomatillo salsa (rather than the diced green chiles), a can of Ro-Tel, 1 T. chili powder, and 1 1/2 t. cumin.  For the cheese, I used 1/2 jack and 1/2 pepper jack.  I garnished with green onions and cherry tomatoes.  It was a little soupy, but delicious.

Outstanding Green  Chicken Enchilada casserole! Substituted  a full rotisserie chicken minus the skin & bones, and shredded. Used tip from other All Recipe members using Mrs. Renfro’s Salsa Green Hot, and using Jalapeño Pepper Jack cheese and adding cumin to taste. Sprayed my pans liberally with non- stick coating before layering in two casserole dishes. Topped with black olives. Covered both dishes with non-stick aluminum foil. Froze one dish for later, baked the other for 45 mins at 350 degrees, took off foil, baked another 15 minutes. Perfection!

Added chopped onion. Mine was too creamy and starchy. The tortillas were unnecessary. Feel like it should be served over broccoli or another healthy vegetable to cut the thickness of the sauce and add better nutrition.

Loved it with these changes:  Instead of 16 oz sour cream, add 8 oz Sr cream and 4 oz cream cheese. I sprinkled garlic powder instead of garlic cloves.  I used Mexican blend cheese instead of Monterey Jack.  Added 1/4 tsp cumin.  Doubled the green chili’s.

I made this last night.  After reading reviews, I did make a few changes.  I boiled the chicken in water to which I added cumin, coriander, chili powder, and red pepper flakes.  Put in a few bay leaves.  I let it simmer 30 min. and let the chicken cool in the broth. Then shredded the chicken.  the chicken was soooo tasty and full of flavor, which seemed to be lacking per reviews.  I layered the chicken and spread the sour cream mixture over it (I added some salsa verde to the sour cream).  I used flour tortillas on the bottom and corn tortillas on the second layer.  Baked in a 9x13 dish in oven.  I know this sounds like a lot of changes, but it was absolutely delicious.  I did cut recipe in half.  Everyone raved about it.

What a great AND EASY recipe!   I browned ground beef 
in my air fryer instead of using chicken.  Then layered as
directed in my crockpot.  A total hit!

Will definitely not make this again. I followed the recipe as written, except for cutting all ingredients in half, and it was so terrible. It came out as a gooey, mushy white mess; it was like eating sour cream and cheesy chicken soup with chunks of tortillas that were the consistency of glue. I'll stick to cooking traditional enchiladas and never try them in the slow cooker again.

LOVE this recipe!! Was a big hit at our potluck!! Super easy to prepare and great tasting. I substituted cooking the thighs and breasts by cutting up a whole rotisserie chicken that was already cooked. I used less than 1 package of the tortillas as well. Everything else was spot on! I will definitely make this again and have already shared the recipe. Thank you!!

Very cheesy and delicious. I forgot the chives (oops!), but no one even missed them. I did season the chicken and added salsa to the soup mixture. Plenty of leftovers and even better the following day!

Good recipe, but I took suggestions from other reviews and altered it a bit. I used 8 chicken breasts, 2 cans cream of chicken soup, 8 oz sour cream, 7oz can of green  chiles, and 3 cups of MJack cheese mixed with 1 cup of cheddar. I also added Chicken Enchilada Soup mix for flavor. I used Homemade Gourmet, but I would think a packet from the grocery store would work. 

Boiled the chicken in chicken stock with onions, garlic, and carrots for flavor and I shredded it rather than cubing it. In a bowl I combined the soup, SCream, Chiles and 4 heaping TB of the enchilada soup mix. 

I used an oval crock pot. I was able to layer 2 whole tortillas in the bottom and I used a third tortilla torn in half to fill in the 'gaps' around the edges. I layered chicken mixture and then cheese. I did this 2 more times, making a total of 3 layers and ending with cheese. In total I used 9 tortillas.

Family loved this!

Extremely delicious casserole! Next time I plan to make with homemade cream of chicken so as to avoid all of the nasty ingredients in the cream soup! ;) I am sure it will be just as good or even better that way though.

It was almost better as a dip and my husband actually ate it with tortilla chips. I used 3 chicken breasts which was WAY too little. Maybe 6 would be better. I used half the amount of sour cream and it was too much. I used 2.5 regular sized cans of soup, which I also thought was too much. I used only 2 c of cheese, which was ok, and I used about 6 tortillas, which I thought was too little, but my husband didn't like them in it at all. If you try this recipe, add small amounts of sour cream and soup at a time until the consistency is what you like. Had I used more chicken, maybe the rest would have been a decent consistency. I wouldn't make this again.

I didn't even put all of the soup in that the recipe called for and it was still extremely runny. A little bland and just seemed like it was lacking something. won't be making again.

I made for my husband and I (but made for 3 servings wanted left overs). It came out delicious but soupy. I let it sit so that it could absorb and it did the tortilla was soggy as I had read some of the comments so I grilled the tortilla before thinking it would not come out soggy and it did. I added for extra flavor Knorr chicken spice and also I grilled the chicken and added spices before I cut tasted very good. I really liked it. Next time I will try with red sauce. My husband said it was good and I am glad he liked it because that will be his lunch for tomorrow. Hehe. Thanks!

I thought this was good, my husband who likes spicy did not.  A few things I had to edit, I did not use 15 chicken breasts but 7 and I only used 5 tortillas and not 15.  I also did not think boiling the chicken was a good idea, some of the pieces were chewy and overdone after they cooked in the crockpot.  I would grill or pan fry to leave them slightly undone in the center so they don't over cook. Next time I think I will add another can of chilis and maybe some spicy Rotel tomatoes.  I put some Salsa verde on it and it seasoned it pretty well.

the only thing I'd rate down to 4 stars is for haviing to cook the chicken first-i'd rather just throw everything in to the slow cooker- just the taste is outstanding! 5 stars for taste!

This was a surprisingly delicious meal. I'm going to be cutting the amount of tortillas to six, it was too much tortilla and I only used ten. The sauce is fantastic!! I used extra chives and olives. If you like spicy foods this would be great to add fresh jalapeños too.  I will be making this again. I loved it!!

Gave this recipe a try as is, forgot the garlic though and it was a hit with the family. Made a smaller version but next time it will be large enough for leftovers. The family gave it a thumbs up!

This was not what I expected, I could tell by the amount of soup and sour cream that this was going to come out soupy, and I was so right. Flavor wasn't bad but this is not an Enchilada Casserole more of an Enchilada chowder if you will. My boys were not excited about this dish at all and the one that loves enchilada casseroles wanted to know why I didn't make my usual.  This will not be something I will ever make again.

It is okay. The tortillas got really soggy, it was a very soupy consistency and not a lot of flavor. Kids liked it, and I'll eat the leftovers. Did fix quickly, which is a nice feature. And I added corn which helped add a little flavor. Not sure what I'd do differently.

Really like this with a few adjustments: used low-fat sour cream, added 1 can of Rotel (drained) and baked in the oven instead-decided last minute to make it. Next time we plan to use it as a filling in the tortillas and may add some cream cheese!

A great turn in a different direction for slow cooking! It was easy to make it just made TOO much we thought.. my fiance and I ate on it for days.  I added some jalapenos to the sauce and we topped it with sour cream and salsa when we ate it. I also did 1/2 monterey jack cheese and 1/2 medium cheddar. I'm for sure making this again, just maybe making less of it :)

I really liked this recipe but couldn't give it a 5 because I had to doctor it to get it tasting the way I wanted. I added an onion and a few cloves of garlic to the slow-cooker with everything else.  In addition, I added some cumin and chipotle chile powder to give it some more flavor.  Once I made these additions it was pretty tasty!

Very good!!!  Makes A LOT!! My sister made this for Mexican night at my request - she used low-fat soup, baked the chicken ahead of time with a jalapeno-lime seasoning. Very very good!!!  SuperBowl party worthy!!

This recipe was okay for me and my family. There seemed to be tons of chicken and nothing else. The green chile flavor was good but it seemed like this recipe was missing something.

I love any food that has a Mexican flair, so for me it was great. The kids weren't so excited. They picked their way thru it. But then my sister came over and loved it, as well as her kids really enjoyed it.

Everyone at the party enjoyed it. The recipe filled a 6 quart crock-pot.
I cooked it 2 ½ hours and it didn’t burn.  Next time I will add more garlic, onion and a packet of fajita mix for more flavor. Slightly bland.
