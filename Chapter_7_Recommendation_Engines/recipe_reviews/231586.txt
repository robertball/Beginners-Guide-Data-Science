No wonder this is a family favorite Sudie B - this is an excellent apple crisp that in my mind is just right as is. No tweaking necessary - that means no changes at all.  I particularly like the "butterscotchy" flavor the brown sugar and butter contribute, and if you use a sweet apple, as I did, the lemon juice is necessary to tame that down a bit.  I couldn't be more pleased to give this a 5-star rating.

I LOVE apple crisp and this was no exception! It quickly became a "family favorite" in this house. It's staightforward recipe that produces a delicious result with the perfect balance of apples to topping. I served this warm with vanilla ice cream and whipped topping - YUM! Thank for a great recipe Sudie B!

This recipe results in a perfect, classic apple crisp. Nothing needs to be "tweaked", added, subtracted or substituted. I took this apple crisp to a senior's centre party at which I volunteered, and it disappeared within minutes. Anyone who wanted second was disappointed. Lovely recipe. Sudie. Thanks.

This is delicious as is - no changes needed.  Next time I'll add some chopped walnuts to the topping for a little extra crunch but otherwise a definite keeper.

Made this for Recipe Group. I halved the recipe and made an 8x8 pan. Very easy, simple to put together, with an excellent crispy crunchy topping. Best eaten warm, the same day or the next. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! It was a little too salty for my taste so I would only use 1/2 tsp salt the next time. I used room temperature butter which made my topping clump instead of crumble! But all in all it was very good and I would definitely make it again!!

Recipe Group Selection:  27, September 2014 ~ I made a 3-serving size of this for my husband.  He enjoyed it best warmed with a big helping of homemade whipped topping.  It is very quick to put together with ingredients I usually have on hand.

Excellent - will definitely make again! To make it gluten and dairy free, I replaced the flour with cornstarch and the butter with shortening and it was still delicious. I used a little less shortening than was called for with butter.

When my sister was pregnant she was trying to reduce her sugar intake so I began making this recipe (instead of "Apple Crisp II" from this site, which is my usual go-to). This recipe is perfect as written. It is not as sweet at other apple crisp recipes but is very tasty! Best served warm with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. I have used a few extra apples (9 granny smith) with same amount of topping, its perfect. I also bake for 45+ min, not 30, otherwise apples will still be crunchy.

I made this with fresh apples from the farmers market.  They were the holiday variety - nature's sweet tart! I cut them in to large slices as I like a more "al dente" apple crisp. Otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter. This was phenomenal. My guests raved, my house smelled amazing, and my younger son helped me bake it. That easy, that delicious. Will be making this every chance I get!

Perfect Apple Crisp! Delicious warm with vanilla ice cream. The topping crisped up perfectly and the timing of the recipe and mixture of all the flavors were on target. I agree this recipe needs no adjustments, however for my own personal preference I added some chopped pecans to the topping. Thanks for a wonderful Fall Favorite recipe.

I have to agree with the other reviewers, this recipe is excellent.  I was doubtful whether the amount of apples would be enough, but it covered the 9x13 pan with a nice thick layer.  I used a variety of apples and the sweetness was fine, though I may reduce the brown sugar to 1 cup the next time.  I made the recipe as stated, except I left off the 2 T of butter used to dot the apples before the crumbs are set.

Very good! Perfect sweetness with a little salt flavor. Apples nice and tender at 30 min....let it bake another 5 for more tenderness. Made recipe with ingredients exactly as listed.

It is still crumbly looking rather than crisp when it is finished, so I couldn't decide if it was done. But WOW, it's delicious! It even stays crispy for a couple days afterward. My husband's favorite. I will continue to use this recipe.

Perfect apple crisp!  The first time I followed the recipe exactly. The second time, I had only four large Macintosh apples so I used a 9 inch square pan and the full amount of topping.  Great either way!

I made this apple crisp today and it was delicious, but if and when I make it again I will cut the salt in half.  It was a little too salty for my taste.  Most recipes call for a pinch of salt so I wondered why a whole teaspoon full of salt, and when I tasted it I could definitely taste the salt.

Absolutely delicious.  I didn't mean to make any changes, but realized after I had all the apples cut up that I was short on butter.  I mixed about three tablespoons of coconut oil in as a substitute (in addition to the butter I had on hand), and my family raved about it.  They loved both the taste, and the smell while it was cooking.  (I used a combination of Honeycrisp and Granny Smith apples.)

Yes, very good basic apple crisp as is.  I cut down the brown sugar - but I generally reduce the sweetness on everything.   A keeper.

This was delicious! I made it for my coworkers and barely got a picture because everyone was ready to devour it. It smelled SO GOOD while baking, and after. To save time, I didn't peel the apples and chopped them--it turned out fine. I served it with caramel ice cream (hello, Fall!) and it was loved by everyone. Simple and tasty, I'll definitely make this again.

A basic, classic apple crisp. Absolutely fine as is. I used apples from a neighbor's tree so not sure about the variety or the weight. I filled the pan about half way with apple slices and then topped. I would have preferred a bit more oatmeal in the topping and will experiment with more oatmeal and less flour next time. This is a very easy and quick dessert with ingredients I almost always have on hand!

Came out soggy.  Used 4 Granny Smith apples.  Should've used Gala.  Probably won't make again.

This was very good ... and easy. I used five large granny smiths, added a handful of chopped pecans to the topping, and cut back on the brown sugar just a tad. The recipe didn't need these changes -- I just like nuts and things not too sweet. I made the mistake of cutting my apples too thin, so the consistency was like homemade apple sauce under the topping, but that kinda worked.

Loved this recipe. I made it exactly as described using Cortland apples. The apples turned out just right after 30 minutes - melt in my mouth. And the crumble was perfect. I like this recipe because the salt and lemon juice add a little more umph than my old recipe without. And there's less butter called for in this recipe. Less fat = more apple crumble in my belly. Love!

I made this recipe for our department luncheon dessert and it got rave reviews! I followed the directions exactly and it turned out delicious. I used Granny Smith apples as per the Cook's note. Very simple and easy recipe. It didn't take too long to bake also. This is a keeper! It's stored in the Recipe Box for future use!

So easy to make and so good. I wasn't sure how much 3 pounds was so I used about 8 1/2cups sliced cortland apples and it seemed just right to me. I will definitely make this again!

The lemon juice brightens the flavor of the apples and the topping, with the perfect amount of brown sugar, is exceptional. I added extra cinnamon, 2 tsp., and would add even more next time. Excellent apple crisp!

I saw the 5 stars on this apple crisp and decided I would bake one. Well, 30 minutes was not enough time, even at high altitude. I ended up baking the crisp for an hour. I must have used the wrong type of apples because I had to add apple juice to the apples in order for them to bake properly. Oh well, back to my own trustworthy apple crisp recipe. I don't know how this recipe was rated with 5 stars.  I give it one star for the pretty picture and how it was presented in a dessert glass.

It was simple and good, but dry unless you actually serve ice cream over it.  The butter and topping didn't create a form together...not sure why not but it still tastes good. Not at all what I was expecting though.

Oh, my-y-y-y-y...!  This was a delicious treat for Fathers' Day!  It could be brunch, but I made it for dessert, and the name is certainly accurate.  My family, especially my husband, loved it.  I served with a garnish of whipped cream, but ice cream would be yummy, too.  Thanks for posting!

I made the Apple crisp with no changes. I also made rhubarb crisp using this recipe for the crumb mixture. I used 5 cups chopped rhubarb mixed with 1 egg beaten slightly, 1-1/2 cups white sugar, 2 Tbsp flour and 1/4 tsp mace spooning out the rhubarb mixture in the bottom of the greased pan. Cook as directed. Very tasty!

To reduce sugar, instead of 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar, I used 1 cup of sucralose sweetener (e.g. Splenda, for baking) plus 1/2 cup brown sugar.
Found can add nuts or dried cranberries for change of pace.  All delicious!

Quintessential Crisp! SO Good! I had to add more butter to the topping, it was looking kind of dry on top  . I also used lime juice because I didn't have lemon juice ( I have done this before and it actually works great) andI used Penzey's apple pie seasoning about 2 teaspoons instead of cinnamon.
thank you for sharing!

I used golden delicious apples and coconut palm sugar.  It makes 8 -10 generous servings and everyone loved it.  I did bake it for 50 minutes to thoroughly cook the apples and get the topping crisp. Just watch it doesn't burn around the edges during the last few minutes.

This is hands down the best apple crisp! I admit I added walnuts and a bit of nutmeg, but everything else was added as stated. Boy oh boy was this a hit. My family and I can't stop eating this dish! I will certainly make this again!

I used Rainier Honeycrisp apples which I thought worked perfectly, not too sweet. I baked mine for 35 minutes and it turned out perfect. Nice crunch on the topping and the apples were just soft enough.

10 23 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/231586/family-favorite-apple-crisp/ ... Pretty yummy!  It was a bit too sweet even though I reduced sugar to 1c.  Butter-tasting, not too much; but with butter being butter, I may reduce that a bit, too.  I was surprised it only took 30 minutes.  I was expecting  "pie time".  Nice  ... E, indirectly, said too much topping; but thumbs up.  :)  I used Grannies & a couple pears.  It wasn't a problem for us, but a li'l 411, by the end of day two, the top was soft.

Nice topping, but I must have used the wrong kind of apples (granny smith) or  sliced them too thinly because in the allotted baking time they became mush.

I have never been able to make good apple crisp. This was so simple and awesome. I was worried about not adding sugar or any flavoring to the apples. While it turned out delicious and I will make it again and follow the recipe as is! Thank you for the recipe. Yummy!

This Apple crisp is so wonderful! It was just a bit too salty so I would maybe cut the salt in half for next time and I bet it will be perfect!! Thanks so much for sharing!   -Nellie
