When I make carbonara, I always add about a cup of chopped yellow onion to the bacon as it fries. That combination is delicious. I also use chicken broth instead of pasta water, as it adds more flavor, and only add the cheese at the end, along with about 1/2 cup of chopped fresh parsley.

Surprisingly, I've never had spaghetti alla carbonara before. So, I don't have anything to compare this to. I know where I can buy pancetta at but it was too far away and I was feeling lazy. So, I used thick bacon. I, like chef John in the video, used whole wheat spaghetti. I enjoyed this simple dish even though I messed up a little and my cream curdled a bit. I didn't lower my heat as low as I should have and I didn't constantly stir. So, do as Chef John said!!! :o)

Very easy, simple ingredients, great to see the video also.  I added a little diced onion with the bacon and seared cubed chicken tenderloins with the pasta; it tasted just like a nearby restaurant's carbonara.  Wasn't too sure about adding the pasta water, but it was a great tip; made the sauce just the right consistency!  Perfect amount for two people.  Thanks for the recipe!

Spaghetti alla Carbonara is not difficult to make and requires just a few simple, but standard, required ingredients.  It really does not vary much from one recipe to the next.  This recipe is a fundamental, basic reference recipe.  I find it a little easier to mix the (room temperature) egg and cheese in a bowl and then add the cooked pasta to that mixture (rather than the other way around).  I stir in the cooked meat, be it guanciale, pancetta or bacon, at the end.  Add a little of the pasta cooking water if the sauce seems a little dry – the dish should be creamy, but not swimming in sauce.   I just returned from Italy, where I was lucky enough to enjoy this pasta dish with guanciale, which comes from the jowls of the pig.  I admit it sounded unappealing when I first tried it years ago, but only because it was unfamiliar.  It is the best and by comparison neither pancetta nor bacon measure up.  Unfortunately, it is hard to find here in the states. In its absence I’ve used pancetta, as I did tonight, other times bacon, and I have to say that if I can’t have this with guanciale I prefer bacon over the pancetta.  I found this recipe a little heavy on the cheese for my taste, so I backed off on it by about one-third.  Nothing innovative about this recipe – but because this is a classic dish, it shouldn’t be.

I'm half Italian and have been living here for over 28 years. So I can fully guarantee that the above recipe is correct. Hence the 5 stars. However there is a small cooking trick that we do here in Italy to make sure that the sauce is creamy and that the eggs don't curdle. First we only use the yellow of the eggs inorder to make the egg taste not so strong (you may use the whole egg if you want). Second you should beat the egg and mix a part of the grated cheese together and then add a couple of spoonfools of the pasta water while the pasta is boiling to this mixture. The pasta water will help make this mixture creamy. When you add the egg mixture it should be done on either a very low heat or even better off the stove. If necessary add extra pasta water. All the rest remains the same... ingredients ect... hope this helps it works for me now my pasta is never dry

I'm a cooking novice so I was intimidated at first. However, the video and instructions help more than you'll know. I was nervous about the sauce and about the whole prep, but it was really easy to make and beautiful to look at. I served it with some steamed broccoli and it was a hit. The only thing I did different was that I used thick-cut bacon since I'm on a college budget, but I thought it turned out really well. Apparently so did my family.

I have never made this before and I think I made a big mistake by upping the servings to 8. There was waaay too much pasta to stir as instructed. Definately don't try to up the servings so much as I did! The people I made it for enjoyed it, but personally I wish I would have stuck with the actual recipe amt.

Okay...this is very easy.  I add alter mine, as reviewing other comments, added a medium onion diced and 3-4 minced garlic gloves, and used non-smoked bacon.  I did just used freshly grated parmigian cheese.  I also doubled the recipe, I would not in the future double the water...  It turned out creamy and yummy... please note... do NOT skimp on the ground black pepper... the result is fantastic as is!!!  I can see using leftover chicken instead of the bacon, or even left over steak... I will definitely be making this again!!!

Whenever I see a recipe for Spaghetti alla Carbonara with cream added, I know immediately that the cook had never tasted the real thing, a Roman specialty.  Thank you Chef John for this perfect, authentic recipe.

This was easy to make - I worried about getting the sauce right, but stirring continuously while pouring in the egg mixture is all it takes to make it work. I used bacon, and I didn't have any romano so I just doubled the parmesan. Also, after cooking the bacon, I skimmed off all but about 2 teaspoons of the bacon fat. I enjoyed the pasta, and would make it again, but next time I might add some asparagus or grape tomatoes - it seemed a little plain.

Carbonara is my all time favorite pasta dish!  I've always been afraid to try it because I thought the recipe was complicated.  I got this recipe via email "recipe of the day" and thought I'd try it.  I had to use pancetta because I couldn't find guanciale.  I also used linguine noodles because I prefer them.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  It was super easy to make and incredibly delicious!  I seriously almost ate all of it myself.  The peppery taste is incredible.  Don't skimp on that and use fresh ground if possible!  I thought the whole cup of water would be too much, but it's not.  It made a delicious creamy sauce.  I'm not sure how this will reheat.  I have a feeling the sauce will separate.  I'm going to try though because throwing the left overs out would be a sin.  Seriously, this recipe is awesome!  I loved this dish and will definitely make it again now that I know how!  If you love carbonara, definitely try this.  If you don't love carbonara, you will after you make this!!!

Being a vegan put a crimp in this recipe. But I worked with it and it came out really good. So if there are vegans listening, just replace the cheese with nutritional yeast, replace the guanciale with vegan bacon bits and the two eggs with the Vegg (2tsps of The Vegg powder and 1/2 cup of water). Comes out very good!

I just love all chef Johns recipes and videos. I used pancetta and added peas. I also made my own pasta. Husband loved this and so did I . It's a quick and easy dish.....I think I'll go with bacon next time I feel it needed the salter flavor bacon has.

Another nice rendition of Spaghetti Alla Carbonara by Chef John. I couldn't find guanciale (the authentic meat for carbonara) anywhere so I used pancetta instead. I also added a bit of minced garlic and shallots to the sauté pan of the pancetta. Magnifico!

Not impressed. Followed the recipe exactly and it was flavorless, so I added garlic, salt, sauteed onions, even a bit of red pepper flakes. Nothing helped. Definitely will not make again.

Oh My Yummy!!! I had to use bacon cause that's what I had available, besides my mother is Italian and she said just use bacon.I cut it up of course but YEP it'll definitely be a do over. Never would have thought of putting the Parmesan cheese in with the eggs and that was smart. I used Pecorino because that's what I had. Thanks for posting this recipe.

for some reason, despite following the directions and watching the video, my pasta did not have a creamy, smooth sauce.  It was almost like scrambled eggs with the pasta.  I am sure the problem is in my technique.  It was also very peppery.

Thank you , Chef John!  I used 8 oz (approx)turkey bacon and all parmesan cheese (it's what I had on hand, and I didn't want to go to market).  I doubled everything, using organic whole wheat spaghetti, to serve 4. My 2  sons and my bf all asked when I was making this again!  I had 1 small bowl left (for lunch today) but somebody raided the fridge last night and it's ALL GONE!  A REAL WINNER! I guess you could add other ingredients, BUT WHY? This is so simple and delicious!

Tried this for the first time tonight.  All three of us enjoyed it!  Husband kept saying how good it was.  

~~I meant to double the recipe.  Doubled all the sauce ingredients.  Boiled the entire box of spaghetti (16 oz), intending to hold out about 4 oz for something else.  But I accidentally put the entire amount of spaghetti back in, and didn't realize it until I was adding the egg/cheese mixture.  Luckily I had extra pasta water, so added that.  Turned out just fine.  

~~Next time I will set my eggs out on the counter earlier.  I had a moment of slight panic when first adding the egg/cheese mixture.  It looked like some of the egg might be setting up/scrambling, rather than thickening into a sauce.  I started stirring like crazy, and it all worked out.  But I think warmer eggs would keep that from happening. ~~07/07/17 Update . . . I've made this several times.  We enjoy it very much, but I've noticed that I seem to end up with too much thin sauce.  I think in the future I should hold back on maybe half the pasta water & judge whether or not it is needed to loosen the sauce a bit.  We really like this recipe -- such a nice alternative to spaghetti with a tomato sauce.

Husband loved it. I liked it. But I did use pancetta and I realize now that I would much prefer bacon. I will make again using bacon.

Just made this for dinner. I'd never had it anywhere else so I wasn't sure what to expect, mainly because of the egg thing but, it was nothing to be afraid of. I followed the recipe as is and it was great. I recommend it!

I made this two nights ago and it was amazing! We'd never had it before but the ingredient list was temptingly simple. It was easiest for me to ladle out a cup of water from the pasta pot before draining, like in the video. I used pancetta (from the deli) since we couldn't find guanciale, and personally we really enjoyed it and I wouldn't necessarily see a reason to use bacon instead, but I might have to try it just to see. For the two of us plus leftovers, I adjusted the recipe ingredients to use about 9oz of spaghetti and then I just eyeballed out "about half" the container, this way I used exactly 3 XL eggs. My parm was also blended with romano and came from the kraft shaker, but I grated up fresh romano for the rest, and since it is kind of strong I went a bit light for our personal tastes. This is a terrific recipe, but since we love mushrooms and red bell peppers, I think they might be a perfect addition to the next batch! I'm gonna make it when people visit :P

EXCELLENT!!! A must try, I used bacon and doubled the egg and cheese because I used a whole box of whole wheat spaghetti noodles. Other than that, I stayed true to the recipe and it was EXCELLENT!!
Thanks Chef John!! another great one :)

This was my first attempt at Carbonara - of any kind: authentic or not! While I found this recipe very easy to make, I did find it quite salty. I used 4 oz of pancetta which is a very salty cured meat, though it did add a lot of flavor. Next time, I'll see if I can find guanciale or will use less pancetta. I have a feeling I'll be drinking a lot of water in about an hour or so. Regardless, the egg mixture did create a nice creamy sauce.

I used pancetta, and this turned out great. I've never had actual Carbonara before and was a little freaked about raw egg, but it was comforting and very filling.

I prepared this recipe as written with the exceptions that I was short a little pancetta so I made up the difference with some prosciutto. I used Parmesan and some picante aged provolone to replace the Romano cheese.  Authentic Italian carbonara does not use cream. The dish received good reviews. All of the Chef John recipes I have made were accurate and delicious.

I made this exactly as written and used Pancetta as recommended by the Chef.  It was nothing special.  Taste was blah, with the only real flavor coming from the pepper, making for a pretty one-dimensional dish.

Thank you chef John for a carbonara recipe without cream. My mom used to make this when I was a kid and I loved it. Unfortunately I didn't get the recipe from her before she died and I have been looking for one like hers. Most recipes I have found use cream and I know my mom did not. Anyway I made Chef Johns recipe but added a couple things like peas, onions and garlic. I also used pancetta for the meat which I believe is very similar to guanciale. Everyone in my family loved it. Give stars.

This is amazing. I find you cannot go wrong with a Chef John recipe other than one thing. A matter of taste I understand, but whenever Chef John calls for pepper ( be it fresh ground or red pepper flakes ) I 1/2 what is called for. In the past whenever red pepper flakes called for I have done this. For this recipe I made as is but again too much pepper for me. Making again tonight with 1/2 the pepper.  Keep them coming Chef John, I love making your dishes, but again just for my taste I will 1/2 the pepper ( of any sort ) called for! :)

Used slab bacon from the farmers market. A bit less pepper & added chopped parsley. Love the stirring trick. Perfectly cream. Such an easy, weeknight pantry meal.

I make this often - my 13 y.o. is not a fan of tomato sauce.  I double the recipe for 4 servings, but we like a bit more sauce, so I sometimes add a bit of chicken stock and/or white wine, after cooking the bacon (which, btw, I like to add a bit of crushed garlic to, once the bacon is nearly done), especially since I usually use turkey bacon and there is not much fat in the pan. (I'd rather not add too much butter to make up for it).  If I don't have stock or wine on hand, I always need to add more of the reserved pasta water.

Surprising!   With so few ingredients, I just didn't see that this was going to be so good.   I have a tried and true cream based pasta carbonara sauce that we all just love.   I was curious about this recipe since it's entirely different, and knowing that, I didn't expect one to replace the other.   This is a lighter, but still flavorful dish that is completely different.   The dosage of pepper is very distinct and the egg mixture does make a nice cream sauce, despite my hesitation that it would.   Will definitely keep this recipe and do like that it's about 2/3rds the calories per serving of my other pasta carbonara recipe.

I'm in Shanghai, China and this was a real winner. Easy, flavorful, and unique when servd to Chinese (my wife). I will say that the pancetta or guanciale was not viable based on availability and price. So I used 'French Labon'. Basically unsmoked bacon chunks. Worked perfectly. Also if you up the recipe servings, I recommend sticking with 1 cup to 1 1/2 cups of pasta water. I made an adjustment to 6 servings and it called for 3 cups. I just felt that was too much... I think I was right on target at 1 1/2 cups. I added a bit of garlic powder and doubled the parmigiana cheese. I had no Romano. Again it was great. Enjoy!

I was looking for a recipe that used spaghetti noodles, but no gluten, no garlic and minimal dairy. This was perfect and my guests loved it! I used gluten-free spaghetti and the carbonara sauce was tasty and well-bodied without any garlic. I added some ham in place of the pork called for and topped with basil. Thanks for the footnotes too; very helpful. This recipe is a definite keeper!

Turned out great! Very peppery. I followed the instructions in the recipe, the only difference is I added some chicken, mushrooms, and sliced green olives, so I added some cooking time. I cooked the bacon first, then set it aside and cooked the chicken and other stuff while the pasta cooked.

I used uncured bacon because that's what I had.  Even with that, this was very good.  I will find Pancetta next time and maybe back off on the pepper just a bit for my taste.  Having said that, it was very, very good.

I will definitely make this again. I just used regular bacon, I would probably put less in though next time.

I made this recipe with what I had on hand,  just bacon, bagged parmesan cheese. I have to admit I was a little intimidated about not accidentally scrambling the eggs, but I did it correctly.  I did add some onion with bacon just because I half of one to use up.

way too much pepper it was all I could taste, I made it this time with smoked pork jowl.  I made it once before with bacon and much less pepper it was really good.  This time was actually hot from the pepper.  I can eat pretty hot food, the overwhelming pepper taste killed it for me.  Next time I'll use about 1/3 of the pepper.

This was a fantastic meal. I made some small adjustments: instead of guanciale, pancetta or bacon, I used smoked sausage. It came out real good. I didn't have the Peccorino-Reggiano cheese and used regular Parmesan cheese instead. The sauce came out a bit watery from leftover pasta water and didn't make it a bit. But I would make it again with the bacon and the Peccorino cheese.

Very tasty. The only thing I did different is just use the yolks. I always have leftovers to microwave for lunch. Without the white they don't get that scrambled egg texture.

I wanted to use up some nice prosciutto that I had on hand, so I rendered that with some onion and garlic (as other reviewers suggested).  I added reserved pasta water to the pan like chef John suggested, but I also whisked about a half cup of the pasta water in with the eggs &cheese as another reviewer suggested.  (It made sense to me to temper the eggs a bit to help avoid scrambling them in the final step).  I then added the pasta to the sautéed ingredients & slowly added the egg mixture.  It was a little runny at first, but I kept stirring it over very low heat until the excess water evaporated.  The results were fantastic!  Very tasty, Chef John.  Thank you!

I used bacon... (2 cups) with an entire box of Rotini noodles. 
So upped the other ingredients accordingly.. then added whipping cream, white wine, onion, mushroom and of course garlic. I also used chicken broth instead of "pasta water"... 

My fam said it was restaurant worthy...

I have made this several times now and sometimes it would be perfect and other times it would be grainy. Looked as if there was curdled milk in it.  Took me a few times to realize what it was.  You CANNOT use the container of parmeson cheese.  You know what one I mean, it's on the shelf around the jars of spaghetti. It doesn't melt. You must use fresh parm and fresh romano.  When done right, this is delicious, fast and easy. Oh, and I also use bacon just because I ususally have it on hand.  Sometimes I will wilt spinach into it.  Nobody really even notices.  Thanks Chef John

This is one of those dishes I treat myself to when I crave comfort food. Rich creamy, eggy goodness with bacon no less!!! What's not to love. My wife is not as enamored with it as I am but it is awesome. I will tell you I actually use WAY more bacon and cheese that the original recipe and in my world....you can't use to much.  I like to crisp up several extra strips and crumble it up right on top before I serve it.........

We are a family of four so I doubled the recipe. Sautéed yellow onions in EVO first about 10 minutes then added frozen shredded chicken, seasoned with cracked pepper,  then added jamón serrano, then pre cooked thick bacon from breakfast morning to make it more hearty for the hubby.  I also boiled pasta in low sodium chicken broth and a bit of water.  Added some salt to the chicken broth but not too much as the jamón and bacon is salty enough for our taste. I used the spaghetti pot to mix up the rest off the recipe and the egg and cheese mixture thickened up perfectly with the broth reserve. This was loved by my entire family which is a rarity. I will definitely be making this simple yet delicious dish again. Try it, you will not be disappointed.

Oh, boy!   This recipe turned out great for me!  I was going to add some onion and garlic to the bacon - yes, I used 2  strips of bacon - but got side-tracked.  I did take another lady's suggestion to use only the egg yolks and a few Tblsps. of water to the egg and cheese mixture.  Next time I'll try to add some onion and garlic.  Will definitely make this again.

This was just “okay” as far as Chef John recipes go. First off - who on earth adds OIL to the pan to cook bacon (or guanciale)?! I did as advised and predictably wound up with several spoonfuls of oil and fat I had to trash before adding the pasta water. Yuck.

I enjoyed this meal.  I had a half pound of guanciale left, so I doubled the recipe to keep the proportions the same.  It turned out pretty good!  The only change I made was to reduce the amount of pepper since I'm not a huge fan of pepper.

Made in a pinch with bacon and half the amount of parmesan and reggiano. Can't wait to try with the full amount of cheese! 

Used HALF the amount of pepper and it was peppery enough!!

Chef John and all his fans, I apologize for what I did to this recipe, but I’m poor, and had to “make do”. Chef John is my favorite, but we’re going through a tough time and managing by using our freezer goods. I know there are others in my positions, soooo, here’s what I did....

This is basically the way I've made this for years. My recipe was given to me by an Italian and has A LOT of black pepper in it, hence the name; as you said. I could never understand having those recipes  with a little pepper in them. I've tried a few with that and the creamy sauce, and they are just not as good.

It is good. I used prosciutto instead. Do not use salt. The salt in the pasta water and prosciutto and cheese is enough. Trust me

This was so easy to make and wonderful flavor!   After reading some reviews I did set aside a little bit of the pasta since some said it was too much.   Glad I did.  I also mixed the eggs and parmesan cheese together before adding to the pasta like one person recommended (thank you).  Hit with the family.  Never made before but I will again!

This was so good and quick and inexpensive.  Made enough for 2 servings. I did make some changes. Used 6 slices thick sliced smoked bacon instead of guanciale. Added 1/4 cup diced sweet onions and 2 tbsp diced red bell pepper to the bacon. Didn't have romano or fresh parmesan so I used 1/4 cup grated parmesan. I also added a little milk for extra creaminess. At the end, I did constantly stir over low heat the entire pasta dish to make sure the egg was cooked enough (personal preference). Also only used one egg. Will definitely make again. Next time I'll try it with fresh parmesan and romano. Yummmm.

This recipe is a very tasty and a great alternative to a red sauce. I did add some diced garlic and sliced mushrooms with the pancetta. This was the first time I tried this recipe and used caution with the black peppy by only using a very generous  grind of fresh mixed pepper corns to the pancetta. I only added 3/4 of the cup of water to the sauce to get the consistency that I liked. I garnished each serving with an additional grid of fresh pepper corns, chopped fresh Italian parsley and good parma cheese. I will definitely make this again.

Made it according to the video recipe and it was DELICIOUS! I think I overcooked the pancetta a bit. Next time I will remove i from the heat a bit sooner, but I will definitely make it again. Such a fancy seeming dish, but very easy to make.

This turned out to be a crowd favorite. I followed the recipe but I did add extra cheese and a touch of heavy cream to give it a finish.  I got lots of compliments.

First time, I made exactly according to recipe.  I was really nervous about sauce and wasn't perfect until I read review which beat eggs and cheese together and added a little hot pasta water and added to pasta mixture off heat. Wonderful.  Since then, I've added bacon with onion and garlic softened in tiny amount of bacon drippings.  Also green peas and Italian parsley for garnish.   I'm now a hero to family and friends.  THANKS!

Very nice, simple, and I had most of the ingredients on hand.  My only changes were to add some diced onions, and I used pancetta instead of bacon.  I also used a little white wine to deglaze the pan after the pancetta and onions.  I've never tried a Chef John recipe I didn't like.

Very good.  Happy to know how to make something so creamy without all the cream calories. Only suggestion I have is to serve it immediately because if it sits too long it gets very thick. Next time I serve it I will wait until after the salads are finished to mix the  pasta with the mixture.

Yum. I made this the other night for my husband, and his best friends. They think I'm a good cook (eh) so I don't really believe them when they rave, but that night I did. It turned out really well, even though I used regular bacon. I added chicken strips to the dish that I had floured and fried in bacon grease. Not the healthiest meal, but when I want to throw caution to the wind again, I'm making this.

This was exceptional and so easy. I substituted left over pork belly (Chef Johns recipe) and it really added a richness and flavor layer to the dish.

I upped the portions to 6 but found out 2 tablespoons of pepper was way too much. The flavor was amazing otherwise. Will definitely make again.... with less pepper!

After having this pasta for the first time in Rome this summer, I was enamored with the flavors and had to try it myself.  This recipe with video seemed to echo what I remember and so tried it. My husband and I were delighted with the results !  To replicate my first meal this is what I did differently:  Since I couldn't find guanciale I used thick cut bacon.  Make sure you use the leaner parts --and we used more than specified because we love bacon.   I also added 1/4 cup chopped vidalia onion  and 1/3 c baby bella mushrooms which I sauteed first and removed from pan...then added it to the bacon after bacon was cooked.   The rest was exactly as Chef John's recipe and it was wonderful!  Oh also used home-made linguine from our local Italian grocery store...which made it extra authentic...cooked al dente of course. Oh and if you want a little extra sauce, maybe add a little more spaghetti water.  Very creamy without cream.  Not difficult to make....it's just all in the timing.    It had the amazing taste just like the little local Italian restaurant we ate at in Rome.  Bon appetit !

This was my first time making Spaghetti alla Carbonara.  It helped to view the video beforehand, also to read the reviews.  I made it as per the recipe except I added a handful of finely chopped kale.  I also tempered the eggs with a little of the pasta water, but I don't think that was really necessary.  Easy to make and delicious.  My husband particularly liked it - he told me that black pepper helps to reduce triglycerides.  Wow - yummy and healthy too!
UPDATE:  Made this again and added small cauliflower florets and 1/4 cup diced tomato. Even more healthy, and again, yummy.  :)

Love, Love, Love! Tonight I only had medium eggs so I just added an extra yolk and it came out terrific! I also only use Pecorino Romano (Locatelli) as it's my favorite and pancetta as that's all I can find in my neck of the woods. Everyone loves it. It's a go-to recipe in my house.

This is amazing! I had to use bacon which was still fantastic, and I added a little diced onion in with that. Also added a bit of fresh oregano and basil at the end. I suggest doubling the recipe, it is so good you are going to want to eat all of this yourself

I made this as called for and as I was put the cup of reserved water in I new it was going to be too much.  I read the comments and haven't seen any other complaints but mine came out too watery.  I will try using the full 12 ounces of Spaghetti next time or adding the water as I mix the egg mixture in.  Didn't have the flavor issue some others had at all.

Tastes like a million dollar chef recipe, but is super simple to make. Most people have only had the red sauce spaghetti and meatballs, and are pleasantly surprised if you serve them this.

This recipe is modification friendly. I always add ripe olives, capers and a good flavored sausage. You can add Canadian bacon If you prefer, or regular ham. If people don't like this dish, they don't have taste buds -- It is quite luscious.

This is the second time I've made this - first, without the pasta water and second, with. It's delicious either way - I really enjoy watching Chef John's YouTube cooking classes - everything he prepares looks delicious and everything is uncomplicated!

Thank you for this recipe!  I tasted authentic carbonara while on a trip to Italy and I ordered it at least 6 times while I was there.  No matter where I ordered it from Rome to Milan, it was made just like this recipe.  When I got home, however, I have never been able to get it in a restaurant where it was as good.  In the US, they like to add a cream sauce that frankly ruins the dish!  I think of it as "bacon and eggs pasta".  Yummy!

I don't care for this dish, but the GF loves it... so I make it all the time. Some tips: if you boil the pasta in less water it's more starchy and helps the sauce, but he sure to stir the pasta enough to prevent sticking. I doubled this recipe once and wasn't happy with the results, don't know what happened. You can add a lot of cheese to it, I actually never measure the cheese. Go easy on the pepper. We've made it with pancetta and bacon, and actually prefer it with bacon. Go easy on the pasta water, I fill my 2c measuring cup before straining the pasta. Then add ~0.5c, adding more just if needed. I have made it with 3 eggs for a little more sauce, it was alright.

The best Carbonara ever...the secret is the black pepper and pasta water. I have made this with Serrano ham when it has been in the fridge.
No cream! thank heavens.......truly delicious!

I added a chopped medium onion to the bacon after 5 minutes. Also added two Tbls Heavy Cream to the egg and cheese mixture.  It was fantastic. I also added extra bacon.  :)

I made this many times now. This is my gold recipe for two hungry people. 

8 Oz Spaghetti 
500 g Bacon
1 medium large onion 
4 eggs
1 Cup Parmigiana grated 
1/4 Cup Heavy cream
2 cloves garlic
Lots of black pepper

I've always been intimidated to make Carbonara but after watching the video I thought, "Well, I can do that!". ;)  So, I followed the instructions to a tee and the dish turned out beautifully!  I used smoked bacon and the smokiness was a little strong as Chef John mentioned in the video, so next time I'll either use less bacon or try to find the Italian-type.  Regardless, it was absolutely DELICIOUS and hubby-approved so a definite keeper. Thanks for a fantastic recipe Chef John! :)

We used bacon because it's what we had and it still turned out great, albeit a little smoky. The mix of pecorino and Parmesan cheese is so delicious! Chef John does it again!

I made it just as the recipe suggested. Not sure what I did wrong, but mine came out sorta chunky!  At first I thought it was the cheese conglomerating together, but actually I think the egg scrambled!  It tasted good, but it definitely was NOT creamy!  Any suggestions on how to avoid scrambling the egg mixture when you add it?

Whoa, Mama, was this good! I also used onion with the bacon, and it gave a nice touch. Didn't have pecorino cheese handy, so I used straight parm-reggiano.  So glad I learned how to do this kind of sauce with egg instead of cream, as it provides a lower-calorie alternative. Big fan of Chef John's, and as always he makes it easy. Thanks, Chef John!

Absolutely, delicious!   My only change:  As a garlic lover, after the pancetta was slightly crisp I added 2 minced cloves for a quick sauté. All else was made according to Chef John's instructions, and my husband and I loved the results!  Thank you for another great recipe!

I will be trying this recipe again, because the flavor was there, but it was soupy and didn't at all resemble the photo.  I double checked the recipe when I had all this sauce.  It did indeed call for 1 cup pasta water, next time, I will add a little at a time, or just 1/4 cup or so.  I only added 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and it was more than spicy enough with that small amount.  I guess it depends on the amount of heat that you like.  As I said flavor was great, otherwise.  My husband enjoyed it very much, I just would have preferred it to be drier.

Used bacon. Didn't start with as much pepper as the recipe called for but ended up adding probably as much if not more when we ate it. Delicious! Not a low-calorie dish but quick and easy comfort food on a cold night. Served with thin whole wheat spaghetti.

This recipe was good/okay.  It was a decent meal, but not on par with Buca di Beppo or what I've had in Europe.  Nice try, but I'm still looking for a great carbonara recipe.

Wonderful dish. The video helped a lot also. Added chicken and peas to it (also like adding veges to dishes since my young boys will eat them!) and my husband loved it too. I doubled the pasta but did 3 eggs and eyeballed the water (which I added to the egg mixture to help "cook" it) and it was about 1 cup water that I used. Also I did about 4 oz bacon and about 3-4 oz of pancetta.

Wonderful, followed the recipe and really love pasta, and not so much red sauces!!  This is the best sauce, cause butter and cheese alfredo sauces are not the best for me, I love them, but dont need all the calories!!!

I've always wanted to try carbonara and I am SO happy I did with this recipe. So simple to make and great flavor. Key is the fresh ground black pepper and plenty of it. Love it. Great for a late night snake or late breakfast on a Saturday afternoon.

This was a pretty good basic recipe--everyone liked it (me, Daddy, and the 3 1/2-year-old!), and it is a GREAT way to use up eggs without feeling like you're eating eggs. I only made one change--added some thinly sliced onion (one smallish onion's worth) that I sauteed in the bacon fat--and it was lovely even though I did not give my sauce quite enough time to thicken. I would recommend using the hot pasta water to temper the eggs first if you're having trouble not curdling them. Next time we're also going to try adding greens of some kind, and in the summer will probably drop in some fresh tomato as well.

Overall, very good, very kid-friendly, and fairly easy, though you do have to understand how to avoid curdling egg mixes as you heat them.

This was a great recipe although I wasn't a huge fan of meat.  I will probably make it next time without it.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is super tasty and easy and also just because I love Chef John!  Love him, love him, love him!  Try all his recipes!  His Caramel Chicken is great too...and his Pan Seared Mushrooms with Beef Tenderloin...all of it is amazing!

I have been wanting to make this for some time. Glad I did. I watched the video and saw that he used alot of pepper which agrees with me. Add a little white wine if you like,I did and it was a good addition. Be sure to use the one cup of pasta water.It is definately absorbed in the process. It is a great break from spaghetti.

Best and easiest Carbonara I've ever made...and most authentic! I followed the recipe exactly...except I doubled it. I used pancetta and bacon mixed, and I can't think of one way to improve this recipe. One note, use a large enough Dutch oven to allow easy tossing of all the ingredients at the end when allowing the sauce to thicken. Will make this comforting dish over and over. I love Chef John's recipes!

Really enjoyed this recipe! I subbed bacon & regular old grated parmesan & doubled for 4.  Thought the pasta water to deglaze the bacon pan was genius - a nice sauce without cream. Definitely a do-again recipe. Thank you Chef John !

Made EXACTLY as chef John suggested.  Right down to the pancetta and whole wheat barilla pasta.  The video is the best! Tasted light and creamy, just like I was expecting.  Licked my plate clean!
Update: Subbed chicken in for bacon and definitely needed bacon!  Good as a "creamy pasta" for dairy allergy son!

I loved this recipe! I added the yellow onion as recommended by some. I could not find the guanciale, so I used 3 oz. of Pancetta and some bacon. It was delicious!! My hubby wants me to cook it again!!!

This recipe is great and easy!  I used plain bacon and only parmesan cheese and it was still wonderful.  Very useful recipe.

My wife and I really liked it, but it was way too peppery as is, and my wife loves spicy food. Next time I'll make it with half the pepper.

This was quick easy meal that the family loved.  All I had on hand was regular bacon and parmesan cheese, but other than that I followed the recipe as directed and added some frozen peas at the end.  I will definitely be making this one again. Thank You Chef John.

I followed the recipe to a tee and it turned out fabulous the very first time!  Didn't have guanciale, but I did have thick bacon.  But don't skimp on the cheese - get the good stuff.  I think that made all the difference.

I followed the recipe for four people but actually fed 6 people.  Instead of guanciale I used thick bacon the same way.  I set browned chicken strips over top of each serving,  sprinkled cheese and added cherry tomatoe slices and a fresh basil leaf.  Beautiful!!

This was received very well by my family.  I'll definitely make it again.  I also used onion, about half an onion chopped small.  Unfortunately I only had regular smoked bacon but it still was tasty.  The rest of the ingredients were as directed.

Very easy and quickly recipe.  My only compliant was the pancetta, it had a bit of an off taste, I purchased it from an Italian grocer and had high hopes, maybe next time I'll try another vendor.
