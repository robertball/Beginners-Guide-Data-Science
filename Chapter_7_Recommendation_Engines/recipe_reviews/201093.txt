This was good. I like the eel sauce at my local sushi bar, it is thicker than this recipe, so I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. It was perfect.

I took some of the suggestions from other reviewers. I added 1/4 c. low sodium soy sauce, 1/4 c. reg. soy sauce, 1/2 c white sugar, 1/2 c. mirin, 1/4 tsp dashin, 1tsp corn starch. It turned out great!

This recipe is a keeper!! It was nice and thick after it cools a little. I prefer the regular soy sauce because it has a deeper flavor then the low sodium. Thanks for the recipe.** I just made it again and added 1/4 teaspoon of crumbled bonito flakes and it was scrumptious!!**

At least as good, if not better than the stuff at my local sushi shop, even though I had no eel bones to stew with it.

Outstanding!!!! Left in the freezer for 15 minutes after making it, so it can become thicker like they serve at my husband's and I local restaurant we go to.

This was very yumm!!! I didn't have to add cornstarch at all. The sauce is thickened perfectly as it cooled down. I served it with vegetarian sushi and onigiri tuna for dinner and this morning with breakfast sushi roll. Next time i'll be making this again with some dashi stock.

This turned out great! I didn't have any Japanese sweet wine so I used a Chardonnay I had in the fridge haha! It it will turned out pretty darn good. The reviewers that said it wasn't thick enough didn't let it cook long enough... you need to boil it until it's the texture you like!

Found that cornstarch isn't necessary to thicken as other reviewers noted...just let it cook long enough and it thickens up quite nicely -- and then more so as it cools. Fantastic flavor, made the poke bowls I used it in delicious!!

This sauce was awesome!! I made it for a shrimp tempura roll and it came out excellent. My sauce did come out pretty thick, next time I would probably thin the final product down a little bit to make it easier for dipping/pouring. Definitely will make again!

I love Eel Sauce at every sushi joint I go to. I didn’t realize it was this easy to make though! I put it on a lot of stuff. It’s great on fish, steak, burgers, pork and even bacon (candied bacon with this sauce).

I have a few recipes for eel sauce but I make this one because I prefer getting the thickness from reducing as opposed to using a cornstarch slurry. I did alter it by borrowing from other recipes the idea of adding some dashi granules as opposed to dashi stock or leaving it out altogether. truly 5 star!!!!!

I love this recipe this is the first time I've made it and it turned out almost perfectly the only thing I changed was I added about a teaspoon and a half more soy sauce and it gave it a tangyer  flavor I was looking for I also let it caramelize  a little bit so it was sticker I poured it over cream cheese and it made a delectable smooth creamy and tangy sauce that I put over my shish kabobs my noodles my Sushi basically everything it tastes amazing

I just made this, and it was delicious! I did not have mirin, so I used marsala instead. I also added some corn starch to thicken a bit. Came out just like my favorite sushi restaurant. I used this on Panko fried chicken. Delish!

So, I didnt have mirin, so I made that (1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup water, 4tsp rice vinegar, pinch salt) then used this recipie to make the sauce... simmered it a bit longer and got it thicker that way... turned out a touch sweet, but went great with the crab/cucumber/asparagus/cucumber rolls I made before I realized I was out of Unagi

I cooked it on medium heat and let it boil for several  minutes to cook down the liquid.  It became foamy and started to smell like it was beginning to burn. It didn’t look or smell right. I started again-this time I let it just simmer, not boil, and cooked it for  45 minutes and it turned out perfect. Simmering is the key to a good result!

Pretty good. Though, the mirin flavor was a bit too strong for my taste. I'll try out what others suggests next time. I used low-sodium soy sauce. I might put less mirin next time lol. Thanks for sharing!

Tried it the way the recipe directed and was very good. 
Also made a batch with ~literally~ some BBQd Unagi blended in it with a bit of cornstarch. Then strained/squeezed through fine cloth. Amazing.

A little thin for my liking, but still tasty! I tried again and I recommend using honey instead of sugar! Goes great in fried rice!

Awesome.  I added some cornstarch to thicken it a bit.  Otherwise- the perfect sauce
