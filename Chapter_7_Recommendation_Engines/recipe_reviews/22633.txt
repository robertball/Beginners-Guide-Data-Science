I've been toasting pumpkins seeds for many years using this method - with only minor changes.  First, I do not rinse the seeds at all - just get the big hunks of pumpkin and strings out - a little pumpkin on the seeds gives it flavor!  Second, I spray my cookie sheet and seeds with Pam.  Third, I've never measured the salt, just sprinkle salt as if you were salting fries to your own taste.  (You can always add more after they're out of the oven)  Fourth, I prefer a little cooler oven - 300 - and just wait until they smell fantastic and just barely golden brown.  (45 mins to an hour) Turn the oven off and let them stay in the oven another 45 mins or so.  Mmmmm.....

Our pumpkin seeds turned out perfect!  However, we did boil them first in heavily salted water until they all turned grey (about 20 minutes) then spread them on a cookie sheet, drizzled some olive oil over them and sprinkled about 1 T of sea salt.  We stirred the seeds every 10-15 minutes to prevent burning - they'll get too brown fast so watch them!

Try this recipe with cinnamon, sugar, and salt.  The salty-sweet mix is excellent!  Also, instead of cooking oil, I used non-fat cooking spray to make it lighter.  That worked just fine!

I followed the directions exactly and burnt the seeds. I'd suggest a lower temp or a shorter time.

Pumpkin seeds SEEM like a no brainer, but they aren't.  Mine always turned out funky.  I used this recipe, however, and they were great!  Of course I rinsed the seeds well and dried them first.  I also used butter flavored cooking spray with mine.    A+

Excellent and easy. I sprayed vegetable oil on them and I used sea salt which gives a robust salty taste. I say it took 20 mins. for the seeds to brown.

Very tasty!  I made three kinds of seeds last night, my husband & I rated these #2, our 12 year old #3, & our 11 year old #1.  I used butter flavored pam cooking spray vs. the oil.  Thanks Onemina!

These turned out good. I like them fresh out of the oven. I used olive oil cooking spray instead of drizzling oil over them. Also, mine only took 20 minutes to toast. They started getting dark very quickly. Thanks Onemina for a quick and yummy recipe!

This recipe seemed really good, but my oven roasted them to a dark brown in 10min! Am I doing something wrong? They'd be unidentifiable little black smears if I left them in for 45min!

Awesome. Love toasted pumpkin seeds and this basic salted recipe is great. Once my seeds are rinsed and in the strainer I pat them dry as best I can (they will stick to the paper towel) then take 1 Tablespoon of Olive Oil and toss them around while still in the strainer then when coated I turn them out onto a foiled lined baking sheet and sprinkle with sea salt according to taste. I slowed the oven down to 300 and toasted till golden and crisp about 45 minutes or so. My husband who never had toasted pumpkin seeds loved them and thought they tasted like popcorn.

I've never toasted pumpkin seeds before, but I thought this recipe was really good.  I followed earlier advice to boil the seeds in a strong salt solution and then let them sit out over night.  I cooked them at the recommended temperature for about 20 minutes and then turned the oven off and left them in while I did errands.  They turned out great!

I made a few changes as well, as directed by PW on her site.  I baked these at 250 for an hour.  We also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  These were a total hit with my 8yo.  Which is good 'cause we made 4 pumpkins' worth of seeds.  :P

this is a good starter recipe. I used butter flavored cooking spray, salt, onion powder, and garlic salt. I put the oven at 315 degrees and cooked them for 30 minutes, flipping them over about twice in between. Any more than 315 and 30 min and they would have burned.

I kicked the heat up to 350 and used 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter instead of oil. Put cajun seasoning in the butter and stirred in the pumpkin seeds. I only baked mine for 15-20 minutes and stired them once. They turned out delightful!

Toasted pumpkin seeds are hard to mess up - and this recipe is okay, we just found the seeds to be WAAAYYY too salty!!  I am a salt lover - but I think half the amount of salt called for is more than enough.

Finally!  A recipe where the pumpkin seeds turned out perfectly.  The only disappointment is that the pumpkin didn't have that many seeds.  I actually used my toaster oven and only had to bake them for just under 30 minutes.  This is definitely a keeper.

My seeds tasted quite burnt, but I think it was the pumpkin pie spice I put on them that burned rather than the seeds themselves.  Still, I'd recommend checking the seeds after 35 min.

Instead of regular salt, I added seasoned salt to give it a little something extra.  Mine also cooked a bit quicker, but it was the third thing I was baking that day.

Just plain great! I can never seem to roast enough pumpkin seeds. I devour them. ONEMINA, this recipe is so easy and yummy. For one of the "roastings" I used 'Gayelord Hauser's SPIKE' seasoning, a mix of about 36 different spices. On another Japanese Tamari. And as with others who reviewed, I had to cut the roasting time down. Many thanks.

this recipe turned out great.  i had to half everything because i didn't have enough seeds.  and i didn't use all the recommended salt.  just sprinkled it on to my taste.  and used olive oil instead. turned out fantastic.  we ate them right off the pan as soon as they got out!

I did this recipe and added cinnamon. I mixed 2 cups of pumpkin seeds with 3 teaspoons of melted butter, then i used half of the mixture to make this recipe. I added salt and cinnamon by eye. It was better than I expected.

I've been making pumpkin seeds for years like this and love it!! I do not measure anything and just put enough salt for my taste. This is a definite must try if you've never made pumpkin seeds before. It is my favorite part about Halloween!

These were great! I sprayed them with vegetable oil spray and I did lower the temp to 275 degrees for 45 minutes. Then I shut off the oven and left them in another 15 minutes. They were nice and crispy and flavorful.

Best recipe I've used to date! They turned out salted evenly and not oily like other recipes I've used. My kids fought over them!

Mine took 20 minutes at most.  Also, I think the salt was too much.  I'll try again with less salt.

Perfect basic recipe. I used this to start and then added Cajun spices as the author suggests. Received rave reviews from my family and co-workers.

Toasted Pumpkin Seeds Haiku: "Rinse & dry seeds first? No mention of that is here. Basic crunchy seeds!" This is pretty much my goof-proof pumpkin seed recipe. Nothing wrong with basic oily, salty snack, but sometimes it's fun to jazz it up sugary or spicy style too. Other than rinsing the slime and strings off the seeds and laying them flat on a dishtowel to dry, I can't complain about this recipe.

These came out perfect.  Because our oven runs hot, I did them at 300 for about 20 minutes.  I kept an eye on them because I have burned pumpkin seeds in the past.  Love when you take them out of the oven and they snap, crackle and pop as they are cooling.

This is exactly the way I always make them. I like to toast them until they are pretty dark , because pumpkin seeds tend to be pretty tough. There is a trick to eating them too! I always eat just a very few at a time, if you try to chew alot the fibers will make them hard to chew. These are my favorite fall snack food, a big pumpkin will give you loads of them !

I made this for the first time and I love them. I also did not rinse them and just removed the large chunk the pumpkin which I think gave it a great overall flavor with the salt was delicious. I used olive oil and Rosemary. Wish I could have the snack year round!
