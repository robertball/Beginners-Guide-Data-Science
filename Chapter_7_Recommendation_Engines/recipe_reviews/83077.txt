I read everyone's reviews and decided to be the wise man and not just the smart man...errr woman.  so i combined two recipes i found on here and the meal came out perfect.  the taste was extraordinary.  i added 8 tbs of brown sugar to the meat as it was browing then i added cajun seasonin (4tbs), garlic and onion powder( 2 tsp each).  it really was great.  
but without these ingredients. this meal would have gotten maybe a 3.

This recipe was SUPER easy and REALLY yummy!  I added about half a can of cream of celery to thicken it up a little.  There were a ton of leftovers, so the next day i put them in a pie plate, covered it with bisquick, and made an awesome pot pie!

Great dish for a week night so quick and easy! This makes a ton of food there will be left-overs. Remember the pepper it does need that little kick.

I'll give this a rating of barely 3 stars. It was really nothing special, in my opinion. So boring, in fact, that it verges on being worse than average. It was very bland - salt and pepper don't suffice to make it tasty. Maybe kids would like this more than adults like myself.
Also, what kind of huge skillet is used for this dish? After browning my ground beef, I could see that I needed a stockpot to cook up the large amount of ingredients for this dish. Other than changing the cookware, I made this recipe by the book, and I won't make it again.

I thought this was great and I will probably make into a pot pie tomorrow.  I follwed the tips given by "stacey smith" and that is what made it so good!  By the way, yes, a skillet would be waaay too small to make this in.  Oh and I also used fresh potatoes and thinly sliced them.

This was a good starter recipe. I added in some squash and zucchini, 1/2 cup milk, and served over rice. I also used all frozen our fresh veggies. I'm not big on canned veggies.

I read the reviews and than I made this my own, I browned the hamburger with brown sugar (thanks to the lady who came up with that idea!!)about 6tsp and I also used garlic salt lots of pepper, red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, sage, white pepper, garlic powder, and thyme. I also cut up half an onion and cooked it with the hamburger, I drained it and put one can cream of mushroom, corn, & sliced potatoes. Instead of peas I used green beans. I also put in a half a jar of salsa and 2 tsp of mustard. It was spicy and really yummy!!

I used leftovers from another recipe (Creamy Potato Lasagna sans broccoli) instead of the canned potatoes and I really think it made this dish. I also omitted peas because we don't care for them. Hubby didn't like the corn in it but I don't mind it. Recipe as is would probably be a little bland but adding your own seasonings to it would perk it up. I probably wouldn't make this with regular potatoes since I used the potatoes from the above mentioned recipe.

This is delicious. The only thing I changed was I used 2 cans of green beans instead of green peas because Becky doesn’t like peas. Awesome. As good as a green bean casserole and easy to make. Quick too. I’ll be making it again.

This is quick and easy!! I left out a can of potatoes and added a cream of celery from one of the other reviews! I love it and it’s super tasty. I seasoned my meat while browning it and used Total Seasoning.

I loved it. I did make some adjustments. I added some garlic while browning the meat and added some garlic powder and s&p. This recipe doesn't really need too much changes I think.

I made a version of this using only 1# ground beef and added a can of sliced mushrooms and 1/2 C milk & 1can of green beans instead of the corn & peas & frozen diced potatoes instead of the canned.  My husband loved it.

I added the brown sugar, onion and garlic while browning the ground beef.  This has virtually no flavor- I was generous with 3 stars.  My son said to only make it again if we go camping- we won't.  It is not horrible just bland.  Easy to make.

Awesome dinner. Very tasty and filling, and really easy to make. Classic "comfort food" at it's best. I will definitely be making this again. Stuck to the recipe as it was, and everyone loved it. 5 Stars!

I came searching for this recipe. I used to make it, and we all LOVED it! I called it Slop, because it looks just awful. Tastes great, though. I agree with those who said it really needs the pepper. I like to add a little red pepper, too. Oh, and I've made it with just green beans if that's all I had, and that's always really good, too.
