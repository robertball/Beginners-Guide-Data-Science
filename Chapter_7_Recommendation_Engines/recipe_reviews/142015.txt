Beef stroganoff is one of my husband's favorite dishes and this is very good (maybe I could've used this as "bait" to snag him a bit earlier had I known). I partially froze sirloin vs. tenderloin (cheaper) to cut it thin and then let that marinate in red wine, garlic, and Worchesterchire for two hours before cooking. I cooked that then plated it.  I used a vidalia onion (about 3/4 cup), portabella mushrooms and sauteed them in little garlic. I also added 1 Tbsp. of Worchestershire for a flavor boost. I reserved a bit of the broth to mix with 2 Tbsp. of cornstarch vs. 3 tsp. to thicken then added the sour cream with 3 oz. cream cheese. I served it over egg noodles - YUM!

I give this recipe 4 stars only because it has to be cooked differently than stated in the recipe, unless you like your meat raw.  I like my beef rare, but with the cooking outlined the way it is, it would be impossible to have the meat adequately cooked.

I sauted the beef as stated in the recipe, but instead of removing it from the pan then returning it at the end, I simply left it in and just added the other ingredients to the beef.

I found this very tasty and there were no left overs in my house, which speaks volumes.  I gauge recipes by whether my husband or kids take seconds.  My husband took seconds, and my kids took seconds thirds and fourths.

I used a bit more Shallots than called for, and I would definitely stick with shallots and not substitute onions.

This recipe was great.  I disagree with other reviewers with respect to cooking time.  When using tenderloin/filet you do NOT want to over cook the meat.  One inch cubes will brown quickly over medium high heat.  If you over cook the meat it will loose tenderness.  The flavor was wonderful!  My husband loved it too.  Thanks for the recipe - I'll make it again and again!

There is no flavor at all unless you add a ton of salt.  It was very watery, needs to be way thicker.  Also, the recipe has you brown the meat and never has you come back to finish cooking it, only has you warm it back up so essentially you're eating raw meat.  I do like that this recipe uses sirloin instead of hamburger meat but it really lacked any flavor.  I think hamburger helper is better than this.  Sorry!

Great recipe. Other reviewers commented on it being too bland, so I seasoned the tenderloin with salt, pepper and garlic powder before searing it on high heat. I cooked 3 cloves of garlic with an onion, and increased the Dijon mustard to two Tablespoons.  It was fabulous and no shortage of flavors!

What a great recipe! A snap to make and the result was elegant enough to make me feel like an accomplished chef. My meat-and-potatoes teenage boys loved this, as did my husband. I'll definitely make this one again. Thanks, Simply American!

Our family of four loved this dish.  The sauce is tasty, but not overpowering, so the flavors of the meat, mushrooms, and shallots really come through. We all agreed...this one's a keeper!

WOW.  Fabulous!  I used a high quality steak for the beef and followed the recipe exactly except for taking care to salt and pepper my steak while tenderizing it (before cutting it into bite sized pieces) and then through out the cooking process I added S&P as I saw fit.  Hubby told me he's so glad he married a woman who knows how to cook.  I served it over wide egg noodles.  YUM!!!

I thought this was great - tasted fresh and unlike the stroganoff made from canned soup like I grew up with. I used a little less beef broth because I like it a bit thicker. Wouldn't want more corn starch, would give it an off taste.

This is delicious. It's worth trying to use the tenderloin, as the finished product is much classier than stroganoff made with ground beef. I was tempted to replace the shallots with onions, but I'm glad I didn't; shallots give this dish such a rich, distinct flavor. I felt confident serving this dish to guests.

This was absolutely fantastic! My BOYFRIEND certainly died and went to heaven for this one! The only changes I made were adding about 1/4 cup of cream cheese and instead of Dijon mustard I used dry powdered mustard. Scrumptious! I will be making this again as soon as possible.

Oh my!  My son laughed at the name, then after he had it, he said, "You are right- this IS boyfriend bait!".  He is 11 by the way.  This recipe is great, I think it is the mustard/sour cream mix that makes it so good.  I actually started making it and realized I had no mushrooms, so I omitted them, and had no cornstarch, but 3tablespoons flour worked fine.  Great recipe that will be made repeatedly at my house!

Absolutely delicious!  This recipe is aptly name as my DH raved and raved. I could tell it was the first recipe to really wow him in a long time.  And it was so easy to make!  The shallots make the sauce-- IMHO you should NOT substitute onion.

this one is a keeper! my old recipe was lacking, so I tried out this one and it is perfectly creamy, and the addition of dijon mustard really adds dimension to the flavor. the only thing I did different was use onion instead of shallots & no mushrooms. it cooked up quickly and will definitely replace my old recipe. thanks for posting this one!

We thought this recipe was pretty good. I made this on a Sunday night, but it is quick enough that it would make a good weeknight meal too. We didn't think that it had a ton of flavor, and it seemed to be missing something, but I'm not sure what. My four year old ate most of his serving, kind of reluctantly, but I do think he liked it. And my 1 year old scarfed this down as if he hadn't eaten in a week! This might be his favorite thing that he has tried so far. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!

Excellent comfort food. Instead of shallots, I use one chopped onion and a couple cloves of garlic. I also add quite a bit of fresh ground black pepper. I like it best over mashed potatoes but my boys like it over buttered egg noodles.

This recipe is easy and actually very good.  I added a few things to fit our taste buds a little better such as, garlic salt, Worcestershire sauce, etc.  Excellent for rainy weekends :)

yummy! I loved this!! I love stroganoff! I also tried this with ground beef and it was great. The beef tenderloin is pretty pricey, so we use it for special dinners and groud beef if we want it more often. The sauce is super scrumptious!

I love this dish!  I served mine with jasmine rice which took the meal to another  level.  This is definitely going to be a staple in my home.  It was so easy to make and quick.

Very good, even with cheap sirloin. I let it simmer a little after putting in broth and cornstarch, and didn't measure mustard or sour cream. I really liked it, and loved my tiny bit of leftovers today. Served with egg noodles and green beans.

Flavor was okay but sauce was very thin. There are better beef stroganoff recipes out there. Won't make again.

Wasn't thrilled with the way this turned out. Pretty bland and sauce too thin. Needs a lot of salt.

This just didn't quite hit the spot.  It wasn't bad at all, but something was definitely missing...it was just blah somehow.

after searching many stroganof recipes online, this one sounded closest to the one I used to make for my new husband many years ago....only difference is mine used cream cheese.  I made this one just as the recipe is shown - fantabulous!  (and the cream cheese version is pretty dang rich).

Easy to prepare.  My husband and I both liked it.  Subsituted green onions for the shallots, and marinated the steak in Lawry's Beef Marinade for about 30 minutes before cooking.

I prefer a richer more flavorful stroganoff. Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and red wine are a must have in my beef stroganoff.

Made this for dinner last night, though I was not looking for boyfriend bait - I fed it to my husband of 35 years instead.  I used venison because we have a freezer full of it, but this venison is so good you'd never know the difference.  I tossed the meat chunks in a Chicago Steak seasoning and cooked it just a little longer in the pan so it would be done, but rare.  I also added some onion to the shallots and mushrooms, plus some roasted garlic powder.  It was way too thin so I used an extra teaspoon and a half of corn starch to thicken it up a bit.  Hubby loved it and so did I.

Was way too bland and the steak needed to cook much longer. Also needed more cornstarch

Love it! Tweak the ingredients to your tastes, but this is a great recipe. We've eaten it over mashed potatoes, egg noodles, or rice. Definitely a comfort food classic.

My husband and I loved it. I read the reviews and seasoned steak with salt, pepper,garlic and onion powder before cooking it. I also chose a beef broth that had onion and garlic infused. The only problem was it didn't thicken. I added an additional tablespoon but still not thick enough. I wonder if it should be 3 T instead of 3t. I will definitely make this again

I made this recipe for my boyfriend who's a vegetarian, so I made this using Trader's Joe's Meatless Meatballs (which I baked in the oven for 10 minutes and then added them to the sauce once it was done).  I followed the recipe pretty closely - although I added an extra cup of sour cream (because I like the sauce really creamy) and I added a couple of shakes of Worchestershire sauce, a pinch of seasoned black pepper,  and a pinch of dried basil.  I used a pound of baby portobello mushrooms, probably a cup of diced shallots, and a no-beef beef bouillion cube melted in 2 cups of water.  I served it over wide egg noodles with steamed green beans.  My boyfriend said it was the best meal he's had in a long time.  So, yes, I'd have to agree this meal could definitely be "boyfriend bait."  :-)
