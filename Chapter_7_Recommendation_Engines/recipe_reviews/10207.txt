This recipe is now a traditon in our family for Christmas.  I put tablespoon size balls into mini muffin tins and bake.  When I remove them from the oven I push the peanut butter cup into the ball and it forms a tart-shaped cookie.  Make sure that the cookies are cooled before removing from the tins.  This is now my family's favorite Christmas cookie.

SO good!  These were very simple to make and I especially appreciated that no mini muffin tin was required (as in many similar recipes.)  These were just fantastic and were gone in a flash.  They are soft and chewy with just the right amount of peanut butter flavor.  I'll be making these again for Christmas!

These cookies tasted to much like the shortening.  I will not make these again.

We loved these! My teenage son asked to take them to a class party at school!  Was out of shortening so subbed all butter, they spread a little but tasted great.  My daughter suggested rolling the peanut butter cup in the dough which worked awesome, will continue to do it that way from now on.

These cookies are FABULOUS!!!  I did use my mini muffin pan, and I ran out of the peanut butter cups and still had a few dough balls left, so I put a few chocolate chips in for the peanut butter cups.  It worked out great!!

This was fabulous! I was glad to find one that didn't require mini muffin tins because I don't have any and would never use them again, so didn't want to buy any. I did use margarine instead of shortening though, I never cook with shortening. I also doubled the recipe. These are SO good and I will DEFINITELY make them again!!

Tasted great but the dough is a little soft as is.  I just used a lot of sugar to roll them. I too appreciated not using the mini muffin tins.  These are my oldest son's very favorite.  Made exactly 3 dozen.  Will have to double recipe next time!

Great idea, but the dough spreads to much.  Needs more flour or to be refrigerated?

Great recipe!  I used the exact ingredients, but I used a mini muffin tin with mini cupcake wrappers.  Without the wrappers, I found the cookies stuck in the pan.

Great cookies.  I hesitated making this kind because they usually call for a special pan which I don't have.  We actually liked these better than the ones made in the "special" pan because they weren't as thick a cookie.  They were the first to go at our house over the holidays.

Good and easy.  I dropped the dough into the sugar and then placed the dough into my mini-muffin tins.  I used my 2 teaspoon cookie dropper (like an ice cream scoop).  The size was perfect and the peanut butter cups were wrapped by the cookie when I pushed them in after the cookies baked.  They went fast!

Tender Peanut Butter Cookie.  I made these in minature muffin tins, instead of a cookie sheet, baking time is the same.  That way, the peanut butter cups are enrobed by the cookie and the cup is less likely to "fall off".

WOW!  These were amazing.  I added some chocolate and peanut butter chips.  I live in Colorado so it's hard to find a recipe that will keep the cookies thick and chewy, not thin and brittle.  Boyfriend says that these are one of the best cookies i've ever made.  It's a keeper!

This will be the third Christmas now that I've made these cookies to give to friends, family and neighbors.  My husband prefers to eat them fresh out of the oven and my neighbors can't eat enough of them.  I also put them in the small muffin tins and they are so easy to make and the kids love to help.

I made these for my BF who has been bugging me to make this type of cookie for years.  He wanted me to get his aunt's recipe because it is his favorite.  I made this recipe instead and he said they are even better than his aunt's!  Followed the recipe exactly.  THANK YOU!

5 ONLY w/ the following changes, swap the shortening for butter, drop the PB to 1/2 cup, the milk is NOT needed.  add a pinch of salt.  The rest is pretty good - tho just for taste, I swapped out the vanilla extract & used caramel extract

I followed recipe exactly and turned out delicious. They were gone fast.
