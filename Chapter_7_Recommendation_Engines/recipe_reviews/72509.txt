I took this recipe and used strawberries, raspberries, and kiwi. I mix up a couple batches, put it all in 2 pre-made graham cracker pie crusts and serve it chilled. This always gets rave reviews at every cookout and event I bring it to. It makes a wonderful light summer dessert!

I served this at a family reunion last weekend and it was a big hit!  Several people asked for the recipe.  So easy and fast to make.  I eliminated the mess factor by serving in it individual clear 8 oz. plastic cups - with the mint leaves and some berries sprinkled on top, it made a great presentation.

Great, simple recipe. I substituted zero-fat plain Greek yogurt for the whipped topping to make it a little less unhealthy and it actually tastes almost like cheesecake!  I have some in the fridge right now.

This was very simple and yummy.  Kids loved it. It was a little sweet for my taste but that may have been because I did not have quite as many berries as suggested, but it was still good. I only had blueberries and strawberries and the strawberries were not very sweet, so the rich cream pulled it together nicely.

My kids call it "berry cloud" because it is so fluffy and light.  Beautiful color from the berries.  I'll be trying this with mangoes, pineapple and coconut to make a "tropical cloud".

I thought this was good but not worth making again.  I liked the whipped cream mixture but when combined with the fruit, I found it to be very bland.

I just made this to bring to a picnic tomorrow.  It was so easy, quick and tasty!!  I doubled it (sort of) for a large crowd.  I used 2 8 oz. whipped toppings and 1 14 oz. sweetened condensed milk.  It was just sweet enough with raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and strawberries.  This will be my go to recipe to bring to picnics! Thanks for a great recipe.

This was super tasty but a bit messy...just as it said. I ended up putting it in a graham cracker crust and freezing it. When it was time to eat, I thawed it for a few minutes on the counter. This was actually a bit more enjoyable. Oh yeah, I used sliced strawberries for the fruit...

This was pretty good. Very easy for a quick way to use up fresh fruit before it goes bad. I did strawberries and pureed a banana into the cream mixture. My kids loved it!

This was really good. It did become runny with a lot of liquid at the bottom of the bowl. Other than that it was quite tasty.

This was delicious and simple to make.Followed the recipe exactly. Took it to a pot luck last week and didn't bring home any. Not sure where people find 5 oz cans of sweetened condensed milk though.  Had to buy the 14 oz can and measure out 5 oz. Now I have to find a use for the rest - guess I could make more of this!! MMMM

This was great and super EASY, I tried this on a group of ladies who were coming over for a luncheon, and they raved about it and kept prying until I finally told them how to make it. I used all frozen raspberries & blueberries from our own harvest.  It also looked really pretty.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I agree with jensig: pretty much tastes like berries with whipped cream. My 8-year old did not care for it (which really surprised me) but I think that was because the berries we used were a little tart. This is a great way to use up berries that otherwise might go bad, but it will not be a regular on our menu. Thanks anyway.

It basically tastes like berries in whipped cream, which is good, but kind of boring. It's missing something for texture. I also wasn't wild about the amount of trans fat involved.

This simple recipe is amazing as is but, after making this a few times, I used another reviewer's suggestion to add a layer of sliced banana and crushed graham cracker to the top!  I also add chopped up kiwi (to be mixed in with the other fruit).  I've had SEVERAL people ask me for the recipe and it's a favorite dessert for every cookout I go to.

I doubled the recipe and it is like a soup with fruit floating around. The condensed milk was described as a 5 oz can but I have only seen the 14 oz can. I did measure it to be sure I didn’t add too much.   Pretty disappointed

I wanted something really easy to do with the berries and fruit I had, besides just serving them by themselves.  It felt like (and looked like) it was slightly different than just setting out whipped cream, but with very little effort. I put out all the berries, some chocolate chips, this whipped stuff and some shortcake cups if anyone wanted those. It was fun to serve, the kids liked choosing their options and it was good...my dad came back and just took a few spoonfuls of the whip! We ended up using the leftover whip as frosting on a cake later! I’ll have to remember that since so many frostings are overly sweet!

Made it just as directed. YUM!  This time I placed it in individual ramekins and topped with pomegranate pommels.  The grand kids think I am Chef Ramsey. (The only Chef they have heard of) Thanks for this simple but delightful treat.

This is such an easy thing to make and the nice part about it is that it is flexible. You can certainly go the the lighter ?version with the Cool Whip Light, condensed milk and just fresh fruit or you can really make it fancy and throw the caloric count to the wind! 
I've added some raspberry flavored granola to the bottom and sprinkled with cinnamon and chopped pecans. Adds a nice texture. Would work with the crushed graham crackers, cinnamon and pecans, leaving out the granola.
The recipe is great and easy the way it is, but for those wanting more texture or saying it's bland, adding just a few things can help that without taking away from the refreshing taste.

I had to freeze this in order for me to be able to serve it. It tasted like cool whip and fruit.

I used fat free condensed milk and tried blackberries and strawberries.  Guess I need to add some more sugar.  Might try again, without the blackberries!

I loved this recipe... used for a dinner party last night and it was a hit.  As suggested, I made a yellow cake for the base and spooned over the mixture... It had a light and refreshing taste and was a cinch to make especially after all the work I had with cooking the main course... definitely a keeper... only problem I have it that I will need to make it with homemade whipped cream once I move back to England.
