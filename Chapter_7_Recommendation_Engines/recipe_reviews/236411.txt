This was a great dinner.  The sauce is the star and was so flavorful and easy to make.  We made it with chicken legs, but next time we'll just use chicken pieces.  Depending on the heat level you want, you might want to dial back on the serranos.  Two were perfect for us.

Although this dish turned out be flavorful, there were small problems that may have had more to do with my pots & pans, than the recipe.
First the ghee was not what I expected. I didn't care for the smell or the taste so much. The worst part is that the chicken stuck to the pan. May have been my pot, but it doesn't seem to happen with olive or coconut oil. 
Second, the items in the blender were so small it was hard to get it out.
Third, I've never shredded tomatoes before & it didn't go so well, so I chopped them.
Finally, I think all of these problems were probably because I didn't know how to execute properly with unfamiliar ingredients & approaches.
Don't know if I'll try again, but definitely will try to find a good South-Asian dish because now I've got all this ghee!
Hope I didn't offend anyone, if so, I apologize.

Loved this chicken. Great tasting, easy to make, and it uses fresh, natural ingredients. The kids devoured it. I used half green peppers and half hot peppers mixed to keep it less piquant for the kids. A definite keeper. Thank you for the recipe!

Absolutely delish. I wanted the chicken to simmer longer and get to be fall off the bone fantastic, so I added a cup of chicken stock to the onions and chicken and then covered it and simmered for an hour. Then I removed the lid and reduced the liquid. Then added the milk and cream and heated thru. Flavor explosions. I don’t think my alterations change the flavor at all, just added some good cooking time for tenderness. The flavor profile of this recipe is fabulous. I wouldn’t change it a bit. Thank u for rbis awesome recipe!

Overall this recipe was a nice change of pace. Only used 1 serrano pepper and subbed grape seed oil for the ghee. Didn't feel like cleaning another pan. Thanks for posting.
