Although the flavor is nice and this recipe certainly is easy to make,  it just never set up the way a custard should, consistency was too soft.  I did use FF half-and-half, so maybe that had something to do with it??  I browned the topping under the broiler, and it became even softer, but in spite of the texture, it did taste good.
