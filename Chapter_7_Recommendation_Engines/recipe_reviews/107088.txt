This is a very good recipe for cooking pork loin. It came out very tasty, and my wife and I both thoroughly enjoyed it.
I seared the meat on a gas grill, according to the recipe. The only thing I did different was, instead of leaving the meat in the grill, I cooked it for 5 minutes in a microwave oven.

I made this recipe as written.  I separated some of the glaze to brush on the meat while it was cooking, and reserved some to use as a sauce.  I'm disappointed with this recipe because the glazed meat alone did not have nearly enough flavor.  But when the glaze was used as a sauce, the orange flavor was way too strong and sweet.  I think the meat needs some kind of spice rub before glazing, and the glaze needs to be flavored with orange but not made completely from concentrated OJ.

This was great!  Very low fat and tasty!  Quick and easy to prepare - I made the sauce the night before, then cooked it up after work on a week night.  Recommended!

Whole family liked it. I followed someone's suggestion to add a dry rub before applying the glaze.  This added balance to the fruitiness.  Not sure if the brining worked totally because when I removed the meat, a lot of the sugar and salt were undissolved on the bottom of the pan.
