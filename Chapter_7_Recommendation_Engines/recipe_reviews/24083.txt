Family and Friends love this recipe.  When using jarred sauce be careful not to use one with a sweet taste.  Will ruin the flavor.  Classico or Paul Newman work well if you don't have time to make it yourself.

Delicious! I made sure noodles were cold and so was filling. No trouble rolling. (I did allow for some noodles to break and be discarded.) Substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese and added hot italian sausage to the tomato mixture. Heated and served extra sauce (Classico red pepper) along with fresh grated parmesan. It was a definite success for our party!

I took your advice and used italian sausage for my meat loving husband. It turned out great. It was kind of hard to get the mix to stay inside the pasta as you are trying to roll it but it was delicious. I froze some for later too!

I needed a quick and easy recipe for last nights dinner and this really fit the bill. Had no time to make my own sauce, so I just used jarred and jazzed it up a bit. I also used low fat ricotta  cheese instead of cottage. I didn't really measure out the ingredients but it came together in a snap. Much easier and faster then making the traditional lasagna or stuffed shells. Family loved it Michele!

This dish was really good, both my roomie and I devoured it.  I stayed close to the recipe, but added Italian seasoning to the spinach mixture, threw in a couple of cloves of garlic and subbed ricotta for the cottage cheese.  Used jarred sauce because of time and I par-cooked the noodles instead of cooking them to al dente since they finish cooking in the oven.  Additionally, no need to spray or grease the pan...just throw a layer of sauce down before putting your rolls in - this prevents them from sticking.  I didn't find them to be messy or hard to put together, like others had mentioned, nor did I think they took all that long to prepare.   These will be made again - with Italian sausage being worked in, I am sure.  Thanks!

Pretty good but next time I would stuff jumbo shells instead of rolling lasagna noodles because its easier.  I also would substitute one pkg of spinach with other vegetables.

This was just okay. My husband and I felt it needed a bit more zip. I used the two packages of spinach but maybe should have included Italian sausage instead of one of the packages of spinach. If I were to make this again I'd use fresh garlic instead of powder as well as fresh basil.

Made this for the first time tonight and my family loved it!  I did substitute half the spinach for a lb of cooked sausage with Italian seasoning added.  I also used manicotti shells, which were very easy to stuff with the mixture once everything was cool.  Will definitely make this again!

This dish looked & smelled great and was a pleasure to make until it came to stuff the noodles. What a mess! The only change I made was to use jarred sauce; I got so impatient after stuffing noodles I couldn't wait anymore!  Next time I will add seasoning and garlic to the mixture, and use large shells instead of lasagna noodles.

The flavors were great.  I forgot to dry my noodles after cooking, so the filling all fell out.  My bad!

I made this for a family that was in and they couldn't believe 'I' made it. I did add Italian sausage and used alfredo sauce for the topping, so I left out the cans tomato sauce, marjoram white sugar. It was great and a keeper. Thanks.

This dish can take some time to make, but it's well worth it! I love this dish when I have dinner parties. I make the roll-ups a few hours ahead of time then, an hour prior to everyones arival, I put them in the over. When everyone arrives, the dish is ready and I am able to chat and enjoy the night. Super recipie.

Side note: They freeze wonderfuly!

I used portabella mushrooms. Yummy! No peppers because I have a 2 year old.  I also decided to use a bread pan to bake these in and covered the bottom with sauce (from a jar).  They turned out beautiful!  I like my lasagna a with a little more sauce so I served them on a circle of sauce. Good presentation! I should have submitted a photo! These are a new family FAVORITE!  Thanks for the creative idea! Also this way it keeps me in check with portion size! I think I will try to sneak a new veggie in next time.

This was OK. It was time consuming to make and not as good as a regular Lasagna. Nice to try but not one for us.

I thought this meal was outstanding! I left out the red peppers and used a ready-marinara sauce and it was still really good. I also used fresh spinach and wilted it at the end of cooking the mushrooms and onions. I am passing it along to friends.

I made this for my vegetarian sister-in-law and we ALL loved it, used fresh spinach and jarred spaghetti sauce.  It made enough that we all ate it the next day for lunch.

This recipe was really good. It took a good big of preparation time, till you sautéed the veggies, and cooked the pasta, mixed the filling, and filled the pasta with the filling.  I was crossing my fingers that it would be good, and it really was.  My family really liked it. I used the jumbo shells instead of lasagna, and that worked great.  Plus I used some sauce I had on hand, Paul Newman’s garlic spaghetti sauce.  What a great way to work spinach into your meal.  Very tasty.

Ive made a variation of this recipe for awhile and the prep time and expense is so great that this one looked a bit easier and less expensive, It turns out the savings in prep time is just slight, as was the expense, I liked the flavor, but I didnt love it, as a matter of personal taste I prefer ricotta cheese to cottage, and roasted red peppers to just the plain ones. Thanks for sharing.

These were good but not great. I did use whole wheat pasta and low fat cheeses. I added 1/2 tsp. salt to cottage cheese mixture. My kids and I liked them, but not my husband.  I served with extra sauce.

Although this wasn't knock-your-socks off delicious, it was good and fairly healthy for an Italian dish.  I had to add a lot of seasoning (garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, etc.) throughout the process.  Otherwise would have been very bland.  I also added zucchini to the filling.  If I make this again, I'll probably add even more veggies to make this more filling.

Made this tonight.  My vegetarian boyfriend said it was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever made!  I used big shells instead of lasagne noodles.  I only used 1 box of spinach, and added in 1 cup chopped zucchini, one minced carrot, one minced jalapeno, and some salt and pepper to the mix.  Other than that, everything as mentioned and it was delicious, thanks, you made me look good today!

I used my own tomato sauce with this recipe, and also couldn't find any lasagne except for the variety which requires no pre-cooking, so I used jumbo shells instead.  It looked very good when finished, and tasted good too.

This was so good! My household really enjoyed these, a nice twist on our typical lasagna night! I must admit though, I didn't use cottage cheese (I will try it next time!) but they still came out fantastic!! Thank you!

Thanks, we really enjoyed these. Rolling them was much easier than I anticipated. Will make again.

I divided the filling in the original recipe in half and used 1/4 cup of it to stuff each of 10 pre-cooked Barilla Manicotti shells.  Subbed green for red bell pepper and 1/4-cup canned mushrooms for the fresh (these are what I had on hand).  About 1-1/3 cups of marinara sauce was enough.  For my 1/2 recipe I did use 2 Tbs. Parmesan and 3 oz. (3/4 cup) Mozzarella for the topping.  We are not vegetarians, but this was a SUPERB meatless main dish!!!

Tasty.  I found the cheese mixture too dry and crumbly.  When eating the rolls, the filling would fall out of the noodles.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been such a problem is I used jumbo past shells.  Next time, I'll use less cottage cheese, and add some mozzarella.
