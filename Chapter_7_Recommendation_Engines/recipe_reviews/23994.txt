Outstanding!  Great on leaf lettuce.  Not heavy like many honey-mustard dressings.  I used toasted sesame oil, since that was what I had on hand.  Also used light mayo.  A definite keeper.  I am planning to try it on shredded cabbage as a side dish for tempura.  (I don't have kids, so I have no idea if this is "kid friendly.")

Delicious! I doubled the recipe so we'd have plenty. Used toasted sesame oil. I bet it would be a good chicken marinade, too.

This is NOT a vinagrette.  It is a creamy salad dressing.  Flavor was okay, but I'd rather have a REAL vinagrette next time.  I love the sesame and rice wine combo...mayo just made it gross.

This was easy to prepare and tasted really unique.  I used the horseradish dijon to give it an extra kick.  Although not really a vinaigrette, I would absolutely make this again.  Good on bibb lettuce with shrimp, green onion, red pepper and water chestnuts.

This was delicious.  I was trying to find something that was similar to Applebee's oriental vinegrette, and this is it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very nice dressing. I used it on a regular dinner salad, but will try it on chicken salad next time. It does remind me of the Appleby's chicken oriental sald like someone else mentioned.

Very Good.  This is not a vinaigrette, though, it's more like a honey mustard dressing with an Asian twist.  Good nonetheless.  I drizzled it on a salad consisting of romaine lettuce, baby spinach, radishes, toasted sliced almonds and mandarine orange slices.  It accompanied a beef stir-fry dish and rice.

it's good!! 
my sister thinks it's too soury.
I added a little more sesame oil to give it more sesame flavor. I also toasted some sesame and almonds! Yes! almonds!

This dressing is very good but a bit sweet.  I added a little more rice wine vinegar.  Used this for a salad of cherry tomatoes.  Good combination.

This is a great recipe to start with- I made it as is liked it.  I then made it adding 1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds, 1/8 teaspoon minced garlic and 1/16 teaspoon grated ginger (I used about half of the 1/8 teaspoon measure) and liked it even better.  Either way, it's a good recipe.

Not really much of a vinaigrette considering the main ingredient is mayo. But it is ok. The flavor isn't very strong, and the recipe doesn't make a lot.

This is SO good. Is is fantastic with asian noodles as well. Sometimes if I want it thicker, I add a small bit of cornstarch w/ chicken stock. Zap it in the microwave & it is so nice over meals other than salads. Adding a bit of chili pepper paste adds heat when I want it. I love this with a salad, just as directed.

I modified this quite heavily to get a version I really liked that had more zing and less sweetness -- I used only 1.5-2 Tbsp honey, probably close to double the vinegar, half the mayo, and added a large dash of light olive oil, a clove of garlic (pressed), and a pinch of salt and pepper.

This IS the Applebee's dressing recipe for the Oriental Chicken Salad - I know because I eat it often enough, and I make it all the time at home.  Awesome dressing - and so easy to make!

Not bad but I'd use less honey and more sesame oil and vinegar.  It is quite sweet made as written.  But if you like sweet, this is for you!

This is a great redipe.  Great on a spring blend or spinach salad.  I found it was a little sweet for Iceburg salads.  But all in all a GREAT dressing.  My husband added 1/2 tsp of soy sauce and it was wonderful as well.

Wow, some of the other reviews were right on.  This does put Applebees to shame. I like it even better because I know what is in it, and am sure it is lower in fat.

I cut it down to 1 serving since I was the only one having salad, and I really enjoyed this recipe.  It's not really a vinaigrette, more like honey mustard dressing with asian flavors (as other reviewers also noted).  The only change I would make is to cut back on the honey a bit, b/c it was a little sweeter than I generally like.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really enjoyed this on a salad of lettuce, carrots, almond slices and chow mein noodles. Used only half the honey as I thought it might be too sweet for me. It turned out just right. Picky eater didn't like, but husband did.

Love this dressing. Just the right amount of tangyness and sweetness in a creamy dressing.  I have made it several times for several events and always get a great response.  My Grandmother even asked for the recipe(which doesn't happen often)! I have even added poppy seeds to tweek it once and that came out great as well.  Very simple and easy and I always have the ingredients on hand!

Woah. I think this is way, way too sweet. It might be good for a salad with chicken or bacon, or maybe for a slaw. Even then I would cut back on the honey. I used light mayo and added garlic powder, salt and pepper.

This was great as written, however, I used 1/2 c. mayo and added 2 t. soy sauce and an additional dash or 2 of rice vinegar and it was awesome!  Thanks!

Delicious! I used half the amount of mayo, so it would be more thin - like a vinaigrette. Was slightly lumpy but very yummy! Thanks!

I made this tonight and it was delicious!  I didn't have dijon mustard, so I used regular yellow mustard and threw in some toasted sesame seeds for looks/texture.  I added the ingredients into a pint size canning jar and gave it a good shake.  I can't wait to use this on my lunch salad tomorrow.  :)

Nice light, sweet dressing, very easy to make.  Used it on Trader Joe broccoli slaw and was very good.  Next time will probably add some red pepper flakes or something to zing it up a bit.

This dressing is fantasic - especially over a dinner salad with seafood or chicken.  The only changes I made were to improve the consistency.  Only use a heaping tablespoon of reduced fat mayo and put all ingredients into a cruet or container, cover, and shake.  The dressing comes out with a gorgeous texture and isn't too thick.  I used it last night over sauteed scallops on top of a mixed greens salad.

This tasted very strong of mayonaise and, while it did have an 'oriental' taste a bit, it was goopy and just made me think of pouring mayo on my lettuce.

I think I'll look for another asian-style dressing before I'd even modify this to make it lighter.

This is the closest thing to the famous Applebee's Oriental Dressing that I've found! Just a few ingredients and simple to make. It's not however a vinaigrette, it's smooth and creamy because of the mayonnaise. I'll be making more salads just to have this incredible dressing!

Excellent recipe!  I have cravings for Applebee's oriental salad and now I can make my own.  The dressing and salad are so easy to make.  Read a review somewhere to use coleslaw mix with the romaine, great idea , so much easier and faster than buying the different cabbages and shredding carrots.

This is absolutely delicious! I'm really picky about salad dressings, and this was perfect. The touch of sesame is really nice, and the honey is just the right amount of sweetness. This can be used on ANY salad.

This was almost identical to the dressing on Applebees Oriental Chicken Salad.  It was very easy to make and tasted perfect on a salad with marinated chicken breasts, toasted almonds, mandarin oranges and chow mein noodles.  I will be putting this one in my master cookbook.

It is supposed to taste like the salad dressing used by Applebees for their asian chicken salad.  I use a full teaspoon of sesame oil and cut out 1 teaspoon of the honey.  It's quite good for something different.

I just made this in like 2 minutes. I love it. I had all the ingredients in my house except rice wine vinegar so I used regular white vinegar and it is great. I was skeptical of the mayonnaise but it has perfect consistency. I might add a little chili paste next time for a little spice.
