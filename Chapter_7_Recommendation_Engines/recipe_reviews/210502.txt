Here's a simpler version since I can't figure out how to submit a recipe. Blend (1 bunch fresh coriander, 1 clove garlic, 1 tablespoon minced fresh root ginger, 1 minced green chilli, 1 tablespoon peanuts, salt to taste and 2 tablespoons lemon juice) in a food processor. Add a few drops of water if it gets too dry... Totally yum with mayo on sliced bread
