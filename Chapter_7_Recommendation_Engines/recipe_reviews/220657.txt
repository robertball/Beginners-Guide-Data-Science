Spicy Black Bean Burger Haiku: "Yum, BB patties. Expected more of a kick, but still they were good." W/ the Sriracha, chili powder & jalapeno, I anticipated fire-breath w/ these, but they were surprisingly tame (well, OK, I wouldn't have given one to my pre-schooler), but I like things scorching. I used finely-crushed Saltine crackers (out of bread crumbs), and frozen corn (a handful of what was left in a bag to avoid opening a can.) I skipped the "coat-in-flour" step and formed, wrapped, and froze mine instead, b/c everytime I make chick pea or BB patties, I find that freezing them holds them together much better, and they go directly from freezer to skillet w/ no problems. I did mine in EVOO and ate alongside a basic salad, rather than burger-style. Nummy!

I tried the recipe, the flavor was exactly what I was going for but they seemed dry.  Actually on here now looking for reviews or comments to make them more moist

Used all the required ingrediants but used a different cooking method since I'm against frying things. To keep it healthy I cooked in the oven for 30 minutes on 350. Came out great! The taste was yummy and at best meduim heat with the jollies. Will make again and double recipe to freeze.

Delicious!  I used pico de gallo, guacamole, cilantro, salsa and lettuce for toppings.  These enhanced the flavor and made the beans less dry.  I grilled them on the grill and they were a big hit!

Tasted great, but they took forever to make. If you're not an expert at frying (which admittedly I am not) you might have trouble with this recipe. Although I followed the directions exactly, the patties kept falling apart in the skillet. Not a recipe I will attempt again. Way too much work.

Easy to make, and a great addition to Mestless Mondays.  Next time I make them, I will use more egg to help them stay together better.  Also may add cayenne pepper to kick up the heat.

I left out the sirracha, simply because I don't care for it, and used a buffalo hot sauce. I cut the recipe in half to try it and found them to be dry - like others have mentioned. When I made it again I followed Pioneer Women's direction in not rinsing the beans and leaving them a bit moist in their own liquids, this helped SO much. Yummy and not too spicy, even with a healthy bit of hot sauce.

Avacado/Guacamole is the perfect addition to this burger! I didn't have whole wheat flour,  instead used just normal self rising. And because I left some juices, they were a little sticky when forming so the flour worked well, that or form and freeze for a little while to get them to firm up for easier handling. Just don't make the mistake of adding more breadcrumbs, that will result in it being dry again.

Wow was this good! I learned one thing though. Don't try to smash them down with the spatula. Not a good idea! Delicious and thank you:)

I liked the combination of spices but I used 2 cans of beans, nixed the corn and added 6 Thai chilis and 2 chipotle peppers for more of a kick. I grilled them on a George Foreman. Need to find a way to make them moister. Other than that, they turned out great.

I used a half cup of chopped onion and half cup I chopped green pepper to replace the cup of corn, and it was great. I'll definitely make these again!  :)
