Update: I DID put some feta into this salad and was glad I did. I think I need to use less dressing. I want the flavor of the dressing, but only just. Really, the rest of the ingredients are nearly enough...  This gets five from me for sheer brilliance.  We made this because everything in it is a favorite food item, though we'd never have thought to throw them all together. Once we did, we weren't sure how good it would be, but we were very, very pleased and can't wait to make it again.  Though, next time, I'm determined to crumble some feta cheese over it as well.

This salad was delicious -- wonderfully refreshing and an unexpected combination. A definite keeper. It was delightful to eat it tonight with a simple grilled steak. 

Here's how I made it quick and easy:  I bought de-seeded and cut watermelon pieces from our supermarket and also fresh spinach that the market had washed and trimmed for consumption. Proportions of these are not critical: I estimated the proportions of the ingredients to reduce the recipe to serve the two of us well. For the avocado, I used half of a perfectly ripe Hass avocado.

Here's how I glorified it:

Instead of using bottled dressing, I made a balsamic dressing of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for this salad, again by estimating proportions. I added some honey and salt and pepper to taste and...some fennel seed -- all of this this whirred in the food processor for a couple of minutes until completely smooth and emulsified.

I thought this salad was O.K. but my husband did not like it. You have to REALLY like advocado and watermelon to make this work. The balsamic gives the watermelon an usual taste.

My dinner party loved this salad.  Like everyone else, I made a raspberry vinagarette and it was wonderful.  I used less than half of the dressing, which was more than enough.

I had just read an article about the amazing health benefits of watermelon (lycopene), but the doctor said to maximize the benefits of it, it should be paired with spinach & avocado, but he doubted that would be too appetizing. I'm thrilled to find this combination works!!

An interesting combination I never would have thought of, but it's quite good!  I used a sweeter dressing - a raspberry vinagerette.

My 14 year old daughter made this for a school project on healthy eating.  No one in my family thought we would like it.  We all loved it!  It was very crisp and refreshing.  Great on a hot day.  Would cut down on the dressing a little bit.  Thanks for a great new experience.

I thought this recipe was delicious.  It does, however, need a little crunch.  Next time I might add either a little chopped red onion or a few chopped walnuts to it.  Overall, very refreshing!

This was awesome. I wasn't able to include avocado, but I added some raisins, and it was perhaps one of the best salads I've ever had.

Good recipe.  Didn't have spinach, so used some lettuce I had.  I also added feta cheese to the watermelon and avocado.  Tasted great.

This was pretty good, and I'll make it again.  I'm not sure about the balsamic vinaigrette, though... next time I'll try a rasberry vinaigrette as another reviewer did.

Very tasty combination.   The balsamic brings out the sweetnes of the watermellon.  My spinach was a little strong tasting, but I would definitely give this another try!

Awesome!! Thank you for the wonderful idea.  I do not know if you made your own dressing for this, but there is only one that I ever use that is store bought. If you have not tried it yet, get some Newmans own balsamic vinaigrette. Other brands I have tried just do not compare.

Delicious! Absolutely delicious. I was weirded out by the combination and thought it was either going to be brilliant or disgusting - I was so pleased to have it turn out brilliant. I want to try gorgonzola or bleu cheese crumbled over the top. I think it needs the bite of a stinkier cheese than feta. It's fantastic for summer and makes an excellent companion to grilled steak.

This salad is so simple yet so refreshing and yummy.  I added fetta cheese and sundried tomatoes to make it more in quantity :) It was just beautiful.  My husband is not a fan of balsamic vinegar at all, but he didn't notice it was one of the ingredients of this salad.  He kept digging in and said would love to have more soon!

Once I found the perfect watermelon I decided to try the recipe. I was skeptical at first, but holy moley it was delicious (my final recipe). I have made this salad several times. I made as is first time and it was pretty good. Then I read reviews and added the feta which brings in the next level of complexity with the sweet of the watermelon and the salty of the feta. I finalized with arugula (gives it the bitter bite), perfect melon, feta, homemade vinaigrette and sliced and fanned the avocado for presentation. Soooo, good and refreshing, especially for Phoenix.

I really enjoy the flavours in this salad, although I find there's too much avocado. I use only one avocado when I make this salad. Very tasty, though.

Fantastic combination!  This was great as-is, but I couldn't resist getting creative & adding feta, marinated shrimp & toasted pinenuts. I also reduced the dressing & drizzled it with some balsamic glaze. I can't wait to do more experimenting with this recipe...it's very refreshing!
