OMG! I think I'm in chocolate heaven right now! If you like sweet and salty - this is for you! This stuff is great! 12 cups of popcorn is basically 2 bags of microwave popcorn and I used 2 cups of salted peanuts which was plenty and amounts to a small can. I used a bag of Hershey's semi-sweet chocolate chips (sorry Nestle) because I didn't want this to be overly sweet especially since it had light corn syrup.  I used a large foil roasting pan for this so I could just toss it after I was done. Easy clean up!

Wonderful! Great for those who love Chocolate and salt together. Make sure to remove the unpopped kernals before adding all the chocolate so you don't hurt yourself.

Yum!!  The first batch I made, I misread the ingredient list and used 1/4 pound of butter...instead of 1/4 c!  So it was a little greasy since it was twice the amount needed.  Second batch was perfect and yummmmy!  I think this could be called PMS Popcorn...the perfect mix of chocolate/salt/crunch!  :)

Just like carmel popcorn - only chocolate flavored.  I also found it to be chewy.  It's a tasty treat!

This popcorn was extremely easy to make.  I wanted to make a double batch, but only had 1 package of milk chocolate chips on hand.  I improvised and made my second batch with a bag of butterscotch morsels that I had.  I mixed the chocolate and butterscotch popcorn in one bowl when it was finished baking for a colorful and very tasty treat.  This was a nice change from the standard caramel corn.

This was really easy and delicious! The peanuts were a great addition. I used two bags of tender white microwave popcorn and baked it in two glass Pyrex dishes. I made this for my mom's retirement party (served in small dishes alongside party mix) and got tons of compliments. Definitely a keeper!

I made this for my son's Halloween party and it was a huge hit!  I can't say the kids were eating it as much as the adults/teachers, but I was asked for the recipe threefold!  Thanks

spiced it up a little with a few dashes of cayenne pepper.  also added a spoonful of peanut butter (since i didnt have peanuts).  Mmmm!  but use a throw away pan or maybe line pan with wax paper, since it was pretty messy to clean up.

I was missing a bunch of ingredients so I made this without any nuts, dark syrup instead of light, and semisweet chips.  I added about 2T of brown sugar to make up for the sweetness lost with the chocolate and syrup.  We have a local chocolatier that makes wonderful chocolate popcorn and I expected it to be like that, but baking it in the oven made the coating crispy and glossy like caramel corn.  Mine wasn't soft at all - I think the key is to bake it the full time and stir every 5 - 10 minutes.  This was wonderful and a huge hit for movie night.  I'll make again to share with friends!  I agree with others - make sure you pick out the seeds before you pour the chocolate on.  I lined a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and used a baking spray, and nothing stuck at all.

It was OK.  A change from caramel corn or peanut butter popcorn...but I would definately prefer the other flavors over this.  My kids didn't even like it that much.

I used smart balance margarine in place of the margarine. I did not care for this - I prefer caramel popcorn to this.

I didn't like this recipe.  When I put this in the oven, the chocolate burnt and stuck to the pan like glue.  It might be good without baking it.

In truth this recipe can be a little messy - but the end result is quite good.   I used 2 microwave bags of popcorn & semi-sweet morsels (what I had on hand).  The suggestion to use a foil roaster was brilliant!  I baked mine for 35 mins, stirring every 10, then poured it onto a waxpaper lined cookie sheet to cool.  Then I broke it up into smaller chunks.  Very tasty!  Sure to make again!

I made 1/2 the batch with chocolate chips and the other 1/2 with butterscotch. The butterscotch was much better!!!

This was just like carmel corn only chocolate!  I didn't have any trouble with it being sticky as others mentioned.  I used peanuts with little salt, then sprinkled on salt as it was baking.  That seemed to work fine.  I will make this again!

I made this recipe when it was our turn to host our 4-H club.  It was a big hit, and so easy.  I think it even tasted better after a couple of days, too!

EXCELLENT!  Very easy to make.  Everyone at my hubby's work loved this and asked for more.
