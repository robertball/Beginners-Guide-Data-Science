Delicious recipe that I made last night. I also made a few tweaks just because of what I had on hand, and per the other reviewers. I cut the sugar down to 2 cups, only used 1/4 cup melted coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil, 3/4 cup applesauce, 3/4 canned pumpkin, and 2 cups of grated zucchini (with one grated carrot mixed in). I made a dozen muffins that baked for about 25 minutes and one 8x8 loaf for an hour. The loaf I froze right away but the muffins are absolutely delicious. The kids love them, too!

Just made this bread last night. De-lish! Because I had 1/2 C less zucchini, I increased the pumpkin by 1/2 C (So, 2C grated zucchini and 1C pumpkin). I also did not have pumpkin pie spice, so I used 1/2 t. each allspice, ginger, cloves and fresh grated nutmeg and about 1 t. cinnamon. I cut the sugar to two cups, using half white sugar and half brown sugar. I toasted the walnut pieces and threw in about 1/2 C chocolate chips. It totally hit the spot on a chilly evening. More like pumpkin bread than zucchini bread with my changes, which is fine by me! Thanks for the recipe Dubby Jr.!

Delicious, I had carrot and apples that needed used so i shredded some of those with the zucchini, and I added maple syrup,  a little sour cream, and used 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon instead of the pie spice. Toast the nuts! My husband loved it and we could eat this daily!

I used coconut oil and Truvia instead of sugar! It turned out great! And I halved the calories! I used pecans instead of walnuts and next time I will try more pumpkin! Either way they are delish!

My 4 y.o. and I loved it!  I tweaked it based on our preferences--1.5 c whole wheat flour, 1.5 c oat flour, 1 c coconut sugar, 1/2 c honey, 1/2 c applesauce, 1/4 c coconut oil, and no nuts.  I made a dozen cupcakes and sprinkled some chocolate chips on top.  I baked them for 25 min but they could have stayed in another 2-3 min.  The loaf took an hour.

Delicious. I also tinkered based on what I had - used 1 c. butternut squash puree and 2 c. zucchini, reduced sugar to 2 c. and replaced 1 c. of white flour with whole wheat. I wasn't intending to, but discovered zero eggs in my fridge so subbed in 3 T. ground flaxseed and 9 T. water (mix together and let sit a few minutes). Threw a few chocolate chips on top of a few of them to entice my 4-year old and they are a hit. I made as muffins as well and thought the 25 minute bake time recommended was perfect.

Very good recipe that incorporated 2 of my favorites.   Also it was easy to make.  And I did reduce the sugar by substituting with some apple sauce.

Fabulous! I followed other reviewers' advice and used 2 cups zucchini, 1 cup pumpkin, and 1.5 cups of sugar. This one's a keeper!

This turned out well. It was a bit dry, but otherwise tasted great. I will be making this again. It made an 8 X 8 pan and 11 muffins. I followed the recipe exactly as it was written.

I made the recipe with only 1 1/4 C sugar, but did add a handful of chocolate chips.   It tastes great and is very moist.  I did muffins, which baked for 25 mins at 325 degrees and turned out great.  The zucchini flavor is definitely hidden behind the pumpkin and spices.

Very nice way to use all that zucchini I grated and froze last summer.  I halved the recipe, added extra pumpkin, cut the sugar by half but it was still a bit too sweet for us.  Will def make again.   I also really like the zucchini blueberry muffin on Allrecipes.com.  Make that one a lot.  Thanks!

The first time I made it, two loaves disappeared in a very short time. Very delicious.  Changes made were that I reduced the spice to 1 Tablespoon, decreased the sugar to 2 cups, and increase the pumpkin to 3/4 cup due to other reviewers stating it was dry.  I was also very generous when measuring the zucchini.It took 65 minutes to bake in 2 metal bread pans.  I will keep and share this recipe.

Today I made a double recipe, increased the convection to 370 degrees for 20 minutes and reduced to 340 degrees for 55 more minutes.  The bread turned out delicious, mmmmmm.

I made this recipe last night and it's absolutely to DIE for. I brought the loaf into work for my co-workers and everyone totally raved. It was so moist and SO tasty. Definitely saving this recipe. 

I also made this recipe but substituted Splenda instead of white sugar. It made a beautiful loaf, and will make you feel slightly less guilty for having a second piece!

when i initially made this bread, it was way too sweet and it took much longer in the over than 60 minutes to bake. I have tried the recipes with a few tweaks such as, cutting down the white sugar to 1.5 cups and cutting the zucchini to two cups.

I must admit I tweaked the recipe a fair amount due to living at altitude and personal taste.  I added an additional 1/8 cup flour, substituted 2 1/2 tsps each cinnamon & nutmeg for the allspice, increased the zucchini (I used thawed fresh frozen) to 3 cups and the canned pumpkin puree to 1 cup.  I love that it came out very tasty  with less than half of the sugar!  I will definitely make it again but will add ground ginger and increase the pumpkin to one 15 oz can.  A little warm brown sugar drizzle on top would be just the ticket for those looking for a little extra sweetness.

I made this in 2 -  8 X 8" cake pans, and it baked true to time in my convection oven. Easy, moist, delicious! I would make it again.

Made it without any changes to the recipe. It was a hit! I divided the batter into 2 loaves and it all went fast. Super moist and flavorful. I wouldn’t change a thing.

Really delicious muffins/cake! I made cupcakes and they came out with yummy crunchy muffin tops and moist insides. I cut the sugar down to 1 cup demarrara sugar and 1 cup white sugar and used 100% whole wheat flour. I didn't have walnuts so I added chocolate chips for my kids. Really delicious !

One of the best way to get your veggies ;-) this recipe is so tasty and moist, my family loved it! I have made them plain, with chocolate chips and with blueberries and we'd be hard pressed to pick a favorite. This is a keeper!

Loved it. I subbed pumpkin seeds for walnuts (chop them up!), butter for olive oil, and whole wheat for bleached flour. I made cupcakes instead of the cake, as well as four mini loaves. The mini loaves I covered with tin foil the last five minutes, which made them extra moist and delectable. Cheers to fall!

This is delicious, but a little too moist. I added 1 cup chopped pecans which helped absorb some moisture. Squeezing some moisture from the zucchini would help, but not to squeeze it dry. 
I added butter to the icing, and used a pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. Yummy!

It was delicious even though I substituted whole wheat flour and used just half a cup of honey instead of all the sugar. That's probably not enough sweet for most people, but it is for my kids and I. They still gobbled them up. Pumpkin and zucchini go really well together!

Can't go wrong with zucchini from the garden and pumpkin!  Great bread, thank you for sharing.  I added muffin crumble on the top for an extra special touch.

I love recipes like this because i can sneaks vegetables into my kids treats.  They are happy, I am happy and everybody wins.  I did make a couple minor changes.  I used coconut oil, did not add the walnuts and only added 2 cups of sugar.  It turned out perfect.  Thanks!!

I used 2 cups zucchini and one cup pumpkin,  1/2 TBS each vanilla and almond extract,  pistachios and 1-3/4 cups sugar.  I used a 9x13 pan and froze half for another time.  Frosted the cake with my favorite cream cheese frosting and the cake became a new family favorite.  if I didn't freeze half the cake we would have eaten the entire cake - it was that moist and yummy.

My family loves this bread. I made some this afternoon. Instead of oil I used 3/4 cup of applesauce and I added 1/2 cup of mini marshmallows and 1/2 of milk chocolate chips. It takes about a hour to bake. I used decorative pans but it should still make 2 loaves.
