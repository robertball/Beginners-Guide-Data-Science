This wasn't horrible.  However, I thought that strong flavors of the cranberry sauce and apricot preserves really overwhelmed the cheese.  I used a very nice brie and so was very disappointed that all I could taste was the cranberry sauce.  I won't make it again.

I love this recipe.  I've made it again and again.  After making it last night and reading Dressagegrrl's review, I realize that I probably only use 1/4 c cranberry sauce (I just fill the space I've carved out) and 1/4 c or less of apricot preserves (just enough to glaze the top).  I agree 1/2 cups would be overpowering, just a bit of fruity sweetness makes the warmed brie delicious.
