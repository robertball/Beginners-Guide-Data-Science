Very good. Somehow I misjudged the calculations for larger portions, but I rescued it. I added rosemary to the homemde noodles I made and that was excellent.

I did actually boil the carcass, and served it with dumplings, but what I liked about this recipe was the chipotle and the sherry. Thought the addition of those kicked it up a notch and my family went crazy for it.

Very good flavor and use of leftover smoked turkey.
 Don't skip the sautéing of the onion and celery.  That really mellows the flavor so that the herbs added still shine through.  Will definitely make again!

Great recipe!  I added an extra cup of broth, a cup of water, mushrooms and green beans. I also boiled the noodles directly in the soup. This was a perfect recipe for leftover Thanksgiving fried turkey

Fantastic recipe! I did have to substitute a few things, but the results were fantastic. I also doubled the recipe, so now have many smaller containers in the freezer for future lunches/dinners.

Subs:
Did not have summer savory so used oregano.
Did not have regular chipotle powder so used McCormick Chipotle & Roasted Garlic grill blend.
Did not have sherry, so used dry white wine

I simmered the turkey carcass all night so had decent stock, but I also added some Kitchen Stock and water. I definitely agree with the earlier poster about sauteing the veg's in butter, and then simmer in broth/stock.

The tip from me: if you can find them, use noodles from essenhaus.com. My local small grocer carries them (for their soup) and they are best egg noodles I've ever eaten.

Thanks, Tonya, for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This is a quick and delicious recipe!  I have made it with turkey and then again with chicken, and either way it's a hit.  The addition of chili powder puts it over the top.

This soup is amazing! We doubled it as we always love leftovers. I didn’t have chipotle seasoning so I substituted Cayenne pepper. I did end up adding a bit more water as it was so flavorful and once we added the cooked noodles, it needed some more liquid.? The sherry really makes it!

This is so easy and absolutely amazing. Only thing I did different was add a little bit more chicken stock and didn’t use sherry.

I added twice the amount of noodles.  I was very pleased with the flavor, I did not use as much salt as it called for.  I got a lot of compliments on it!

Made this but added potatoes and used some fresh fettuccine pasta I made. Subbed the sherry for white wine which I had on hand and used turkey stock. I also didn't have the chipotle pepper so I threw in some red pepper flakes and it gives it a little kick but it's not spicy. Really delicious!

So easy and delicious!   The name says it all.  Made my day.  My husband loves soups, but I am never confident about what herbs and spices to use so everything does not take alike.  These combinations are fantastic.  I will be making it again.

I made this today with left over turkey,  it was flavorful and  delicious.  I used 1/2 # of chopped turkey, left out the savory as I couldn't find any,  it seemed a little salty so next time I would use less. But all in all it was very good

Best turkey or chicken noodle soup EVAR!! Little tip: Keep noodles on the side until ready to serve, that way they don't soak up a the yummy broth.

Made it according to the directions. AFTER tasting it, I added a touch more salt. I like that the pasta was cooked separately, because I'm on a diet and didn't want the noodles, but I could put them in the bowls of others. Will bookmark this recipe!
