As an eggplant freak, I really enjoyed this recipe, though I would stress that it's necessary to boil the eggplant for at least 45 minutes before using it.  And like some of the others, I used ground beef instead of bacon for more of a "lasagna" taste.  I would definitely try it again!

I modified this recipe by "frying" the eggplant slices in Pam olive oil spray in my electric skillet (pretty high heat). I also used hamburger instead of bacon mixed with the spaghetti sauce. Thanks Natalie for a great recipe using eggplant instead of lasagna noodles!! Tried again using lasagna noodles with the fried eggplant -- excellent!! I did not pre-cook the noodles, let them absorb the juice from the cheeses and sauce, bake covered.

I loved the idea of lasagna without the noodles!  I used my favorite lasagna recipe but replaced the noodles with the eggplant.  After reading comments I did the following to prepare my eggplant:  sliced, placed in a pan with about a tsp of heated olive oil and salted.  When the oil had been soaked up and the eggplant had started to soften I added several Tablespoons of water.  Then flipped and repeated with water.  I tried it without the oil and it didn't work as well.  My eggplant turned out golden and soft but was not mushy.  I also used a round glass pan to accommidate for the shape of the eggplant.  It worked perfectly!  Thanks for the idea Natalie.

UGH!
I should have read the reviews first!
I'm not very versed in eggplant recipes, so
i followed the directions to a "t". 
Where the recipe went horribly wrong was the salting/sweating. Brushing the salt off didn't do the trick (and may have been too late) - the eggplant was WAY too salty - even for me, a true salt lover. The reciepe is good in theory, bad in direction. Definitely prep the eggplant with a different method! And this takes much more cooking time, too.

I read through the other recipes and loved the idea of "frying" in pam. I did salt one side of the eggplant and then fry it in the pam. The plant came out nicely browned and soft. I then used the ricotta cheese recipe, it all came out wonderfully.

I really liked this, especially using the eggplant as "noodles".  Only problems I had was my eggplant was too small so there was not enough noodles and I sliced some strips too thick. Next time a really large eggplant or 2 smaller ones. I froze my leftovers and used them as quick lunches during the week.  I will definitely make this again.

This dish was very good.  I will change a few things the next time I make it though. I will boil the eggplant a little first, to soften it and omit the bacon, it was to dominating of a flavor in this dish.  Me and my husband enjoyed it very much.

I made a number of modifications so bear with my "review".  I used half an eggplant, 1 small zucchini and 1 small yellow squash.  I sliced each very thinly and didn't salt or sweat.  Instead of red sauce, I used 2 c of ricotta mixed with 2 eggs and italian seasonings.  Lastly, I substituted prociutto for the bacon.  The results were very good.

I tried this recipe exactly as written, and have to say that I too found the eggplant waaay too salty. I also didn't care for the bacon in this recipe, although my husband liked it. I made it again, leaving out the bacon. And instead of salting the eggplant, I peeled and sliced it, spread it on an oiled pie plate and nuked til soft, about 4 minutes. Perfecto!!!!

I should have read the previous reviews and cooked the eggplant first- I followed exactly and the eggplant was not soft- I cooked for another 30 min and it still wasn't soft enough to eat-  I'll stick with Eggplant Parmesan.

I love this recipe. I made some changes. I did let the eggplant sweat but only salted one side and pressed the slices between paper towels. I then bake the eggplant on 425 for 20 min while I prepare the sauce. I donâ€™t use bacon because the sauce I make has meat in it. My family loves it and it is a great dish to take to friends!

This recipe was easy and delicious. I substituted the bacon for ground beef, and I also used a can of crushed tomatoes and tomato paste with oregano and basil for the spaghetti sauce (to cut down on added sugar).  I also boiled the eggplants for a few minutes and put it in the micro for a few minutes until it was soft. Be sure to dab it with paper towels to get rid of some of the water at this point. When it came out of the oven, it smelled heavenly and the eggplants were melt-in-your-mouth tender. I will definitely be making this again.

Thanks for the recipe, my husband and I really liked it. I did 2 things a little different. I didn't have bacon slices so I used Hormel Real Bacon Bits about 2 1/2 oz from the 3 oz bottle and I layered it just like everything else. (The original recipe didn't say to layer the bacon.) It didn't have a big bacon flavor, but each layer was thoroughly covered with bacon.  I had left over eggplant so I grilled it with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and a dash of salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  I notice the paper thin slices tasted the best.  Next time I plan to make all of my eggplant slices paper thin, and grill them the same way and then put it in the lasagna and see how that turns out.

I've never made eggplant lasagna before.  I made this along with a regular lasagne since I was feeding Meat eaters and Veg's.  I have to say I did not have very much of this -just a taste.  It was decent.  It was very easy to prepare.  The veg's raved about it and really enjoyed it.  It was all gone so I guess it was pretty good!

Not bad from the traditional Melanzane alla Parmigiana or eggplant parmesan done in layers recipe-but feta cheese? Anyways, we slice the eggplant then just leave them in cold salted water so they don't get too salty.

This was really great for my low carb diet. I used ground beef instead of bacon to make it more italian. Also I sweated the eggplant for an hour each side so I didn't have the problems that the other reviewers had.

A good simple recipe! Mods: After salting and rinsing the eggplant slices, roast in oven, dredge in milk and bread crumbs, brown in skillet. Then assemble per recipe. Season to taste.

I was surprised by how good this really was.  I was worried the eggplant wouldn't carry enough flavor.  So, I had desided to add imitation meat crumbs to the spaghetti sauce to inhance the recipe.  But, I don't think it needed it.  I took the advice from others about patting dry the sliced eggplant in the beginning too.

I love this recipe although I do make some changes/additions!!  I make it with 1 eggplant and 1 zucchini - let both of them sweat in a colander and then use them as the layers.  I also use fat free ricotta and a bit of parmesan cheese (no mozzarella around!) on each layer.  I tend to like homemade pasta sauces so I can add tons of veggies!!!  Overall an awesome idea and I've had tons of compliments!!!

Just made this dish, and grilled the eggplant first. Substituted Cottage Cheese for Ricotta only because that was all I had.  Turned out great.  A little soupy, so I would use less sauce.

This can also be a great vegetarian recipe.  I left the bacon out and added all ricotta cheese because we don't like feta.  This is a great low carb recipe and getting eggplant into the family's diet is easy.  Add several chopped hard boiled eggs in place of the meat.  Makes it tast rich.  Great recipe.

I didn't bother with the salting.  I had a full 28oz can of sauce, so I used it.  We enjoyed this very much!  Wished for more feta, but that's ok.  I skipped the broiler as my 12 year old was baking and I didn't want her fooling with it.

After 35" in the convection oven, this turned out only partially warm and the eggplant was not fully cooked. I then covered the dish with alum. foil and returned to the oven for another 35" which made the dish smell like it should and everything was hot and cooked. I thought it tasted fine but would not probably make it again following these directions.

This was my first time eating/cooking an eggplant.  This wasn't bad.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using turkey bacon (and microwaving it).  I did the whole salt/sweat thing rather than frying it (was trying to keep it healthy).  The eggplant was fine if you're not expecting it to taste like a noodle.  It wasn't too hard at all.  I liked the bacon in there.  Couldn't really taste the feta.  I think it could use some spices or garlic- something else- but I would probably make this again if I had an eggplant to do something with.

Very delicious, easy to prepare.  Make sure you let the eggplant slices dry out or it makes your lasagna a little watery.
