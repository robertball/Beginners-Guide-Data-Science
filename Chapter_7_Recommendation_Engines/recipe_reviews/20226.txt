I felt Sauce was a tad too much chili powder.  A famous Michigan Coney restaurant uses these proportions of condiments: 1 lb. hamburgh 80/20 fat ratio. small onion, chopped, 2 tsp. chilipowder(kind that has cumin in it already), 1 tsp. cumin, 2 tsp. Hungarian sweet Paprika, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp. white sugar. The mixture is prepared as Joanie suggests.  In addition, once the meat is browned, one should "pulse" the meat in a food processor for about 2-3 seconds to break up the "strands" of meat. The white buns should be 7 in. in length and slightly steamed, and the Koegel brand Vienna hotdog is just heated and then topped with the sauce and finally generously topped with chopped sweet onion bits.

Fantastic sauce. I did not change a thing. It turned out wonderful. Super easy to make. My 10 year old son fell in love with it. He said "It's much better than the canned kind we usually use" And he loves the canned type. Thank you so much.

Be very cautious in trying this recipe for children! My husband and I thought it was okay, but I wondered if I had done something wrong with the spices! (Should the measurements be teaspoons?) It was awfully hot, even after I added a small amount of sugar, some ketchup, and removed some of the spice. Kids ate plain hotdogs, and husband did not request a repeat. I was disappointed, it looked good.

I added extra salt, but I liked this a lot. If you order burgers or hots "with everything," this is the sauce you are looking for.

I made this using "zelkos" changes.  We put it over hot dogs and fresh cut fries, topped with shredded cheddar and diced onion......it was a hit. My family loved it.

Fantastic!! I have been looking for a real simple Hot dog sauce without 10000 ingredients. This was perfect. I follow the recipe exactly as written, and the only thing I added was 1 tsp Cayenne powder, because I like my sauce a little spicier.

This was the perfect recipe since I was out of ketchup and tomato sauce!! I thought the flavor was pretty good, I might try a tomato based one before I decide how much I like this one!

I substitute paprika and chillie powder with chillie paste. I didn't use much because my son can't take too much hot food. If it were for me, I would have put in quite a bit! I added minced garlic and diced tomatoes just to give it a tangy taste. The rating is from my son. Thank you Joan for sharing the recipe with us.

This sauce was not hot at all but very spicy...I ended up doubling the spices in the sauce but I probably had more than a pound of ground beef...ya know?   Also added cumin seeds.

This was a great recipe. I did cut brown sugar by 1/3 and when finished ran the sauce through the blender. The blender gives it a nice texture.

This was just what I was looking for!  I loved it!!!  It was not the tomatoe variety.  I use it for hot dogs, nachos, tacos and more!!!!  It is just so versatile and tastey!!!  I usually double it and put a bag or two of it in the freezer already prepared!!!

I copied this recipe into my recipe box and never said why. I needed a recipe for Coney sauce for a supper I was making for a church activity for kids and adults which we had quite often. The kids seemed to enjoy the sauce, but the adults really liked it and asked where I got the recipe. The only difficulty I had with the recipe was how much water to use. Cover is subjective. I'll make this recipe again. Thanks and it did not taste like chili it tasted like what I have eatten at Coney Island restaurants in Detroit and Kalamazoo Michigan.

Sorry, Joanie, but I found this one to be pretty awful. Even with the chili powder, the flavor was far too bland. I managed to salvage the meal by adding dry mustard, vinegar and ketchup. Will avoid this one next time.

I didn't like this at all. It was sooo hot! I tried adding sugar to it, but it just gave it a wierd taste. I was disappointed because I wanted grilled hot dogs with coney sauce. I'll have to keep looking because this isn't the recipe for me.

I have made this hot dog sauce a few times and it is delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was wonderful but when I made it again, I added 1 teaspoon of cumin and 1 teaspoon of white sugar.  For us, those additions made it even better.   It is just my husband and me now so I make the regular recipe and freeze it in small amounts, using my Food Saver.  It could also be frozen in small zip lock bags with most of the air pressed out.  I freezes well and we always have sauce for chili dogs   Thanks Joanie

Make sure you use sweet paprika (don't use smoked or hot for this recipe). If you want more heat add tobasco or Franks. This was great, but I will add tomatoe paste in the future - it adds richness!

Pretty ordinary.  Nothing to jump up and down about but it's not awful by any strech.  Next time I will try another recipe though.

I do not care for this recipe at all.  It tastes like chili powder and hamburger.  I am looking for a way to modify it now.  Sorry :(
