Followed recipe exactly. Chicken was moist but we were disappointed in the flavor. Expected more mango flavor or at least a slight sweetness from the mango and it just wasn't there although the mango itself was very sweet. There was a slight bitterness although we used a quality riesling as well. We'll use the leftover marinade as a salad dressing with a veggie/fruit salad but wouldn't make it again.

LOVED this! I tried to stay true to the recipe except for ONE thing... I did not have mangoes so I substituted PEACHES instead. I figured they were fairly similar in texture & juiciness... Anyway it was WONDERFUL!!! Everyone raved. Oh! I did add extra garlic cloves because we are garlic freaks. Was actually looking for something lower in salt for a marinade. Everything else called for either teriyaki sauce or added salt. This was the best one I could find. Will definitely use this one again!

Moist and flavorful. Grilled this on a George Foreman for 10 minutes basted with the set aside marinade and cooked them for another 3 minutes. Great served with the leftover Riesling wine! Even great tasting as a leftover entree.

I would give this 3.5 - it was very moist and I like the concept but the chicken really didn't benefit much from the marinade. I think next time I may just take the marinade and make a reduction to be able to dip the chicken into.

I don't drink alcohol (or cook with it) so I substituted the Riesling with white grape juice and it turned out fantastic. I will definately make it again.

I thought this marinade was wonderful! I made it as written only I added a good portion of Curry and let it marinate 24 hours poked fork holes in it and turned it several times. My husband then grilled it and we had it with Mango Salsa. Very good recipe!
