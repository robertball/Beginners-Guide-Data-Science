Great recipe!  I'm so glad I "risked it"!  The only thing I added was about a tablespoon of minced garlic  and I also marinated over night.  Awesome!

I wish I could have cut more of the fat off. I think that changed the flavor.  The sauce was great with the brisket once I drained off the fat. I wish I cut the cooking time down so it would have been a little pink.

My family really liked this and gave it a 4.3 star!
My husband is gluten free, so I couldn't use the lipton onion soup mix, so I used a recipe to make my own.  Used a 3+ Lb Brisket and cooked it for 4.5 hours. Their only complaint was it was missing a smokey flavor.
