A lot of juice cooked out of my very flavorful mango, so it took FOREVER for the liquid to evaporate (close to an hour). The mango was very ripe, so that well may have been the reason.  I would omit the water the next time, adding only if necessary.  Followed the recipe to the letter, but did add a little more crushed red pepper for some added zing.  This chutney also would be delicious on grilled chicken and shrimp.  Thumbs up on this one.

I served this as part of a "Crostini bar" appetizer for a recent dinner party. I used a jarred hot mango chutney to save time and served on toasted baguette slices.  The idea, though, is a 5 star idea.  The cream cheese is a great mellow counterpoint for the chutney and it is simple and easy.
