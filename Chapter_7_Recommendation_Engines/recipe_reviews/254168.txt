1st time making Pernil after eating it for a lifetime. The rub and the slow roasting made all the difference. One suggestion, if you like the skin crispy (as us Puerto Ricans do), I recommend you kick up the oven to 400 degrees for the last half hour.

It cooked longer than expected. I also left the fat on because its the best part to me. I did 300° for 5 hours covered and raised it to 400° uncovered. My Dominican husband seasoned it but used basically the same. lime,garlic,adobo,sazon,sofrito, salt,oregano I think that's it. also my pernil was 8-9pounds thats probably why it took longer

This is going into my 'favorite ' file. Absolutely delicious. Made it exactly as written--except I didn't have time to marinate it. Can't wait to see if that makes it even more scrumptious!  Served with mashed potatoes and gravy made from drippings. 

 NOTE: it only took my cut of shoulder roast 2 hours to get to 145 degrees. Don't over cook!

I made this for Christmas dinner, but I used a fresh ham, a much larger cut of pork. It was over 18 lbs. with the bone in. I had the bone removed but the skin left on. I tripled this recipe and placed some horizontally under the skin, some into the cavity where the bone had been, some into deep cuts in the meat, and the rest rubbed all around the outside. I let it marinate 2 days. It was the most flavorful pork I have had, and I have been making a fresh ham for 30 years. This is now my Christmas recipe.

Perfect! So tasty.  I followed the suggestion of a previous reviewer and raised the temperature to 400 for the last 45 minutes or so.  This will be my go to pernil recipe.  Thanks!

I had a roast that was already seasoned with adobo but I wanted more of that Puerto Rican flavor. Made it like the recipe says. Flavorful, moist. A little bit of Borinquén in Minnesota. Reminds me of roast pork on a spit.

Great marinade and recipe! The time invested is worth it! I added some chicken broth (1/2”) to the roasting pan to maintain moisture. Served with rice and beans. Excellent!!!

I've used the rub from this recipe several times. I only went the whole nine yards with this recipe the first time, but it works very well (halved) on a smaller piece of pork in my crockpot.

I will definitely make again.  The flavor was good.  My roast was only 3 lbs.  So I roasted it 2 hrs in a convection oven, along with quartered potatoes and carrots.  Thank You for the recipe.

The flavor was spot on, but it was drying out and not fall off the bone. Should i have covered it with foil and cooked it more?

This was amazing, was a huge hit with everyone! Adjusted for a 10 pound roast, 24 hour marinade, 5.5 hour cook. Making it again right now, mouths are watering! Thanks for the recipe.

It came out perfect!!! I baked it at 350 deg. for the time specified and  I kicked up the oven to 400 deg. for the last 30 minutes of cooking . I added caraway seeds , cilantro, ham seasoning and a little liquid smoke. I did not have to add any salt at all when done ( I love salt on my food!!!). Thank you for a wonderful recipe for fresh pork shoulder!!!!!

This was delicious.  I used a 12Lb pork shoulder so I basically doubled. everything.  At the end, I actually broiled the skin for a few minutes so it was really crispy.

It was tasty. A little tough and dry. I'm not sure the cooking time is long enough.

I will make this again. The only reason for not 5 stars is because it was way too salty using the amount in the recipe. The drippings in the pan were a fair amount of olive oil and dried on meat juices. I put the olive oil in a saucepan, put water in the drippings and boiled it until they came loose. After making a roux with the olive oil and a couple of large spoons of flour, I adding the drippings and water as needed to make a delicious gravy.

8 hours for an 11 pounder.  Ingredients  × 2  & half. And the last hour  up the heat to 400 to get the crispiness. It Was a Hit! Absolutely perfect.

This is by far the best recipe I have tried, it came out Amazing! 

sidenote: I  didnt have a big enough pilón so I used a bender to mix the ingredients, I substituted the olive oil for Herbs de Province oil. Not to offend original recipe but i found everything I make with this oil is amazing. I also used an oven bag filled with a can of beer. 

*If you ever want to just let it cook without worrying about burning it get an oven bag
