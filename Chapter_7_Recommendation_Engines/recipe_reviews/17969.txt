This is a simple recipe with delicious results.
I added 1/2 cup liquid honey, next time I'll add just 1/4 cup as it was a little too sweet.  It held well together and was great with baked beans.
This is a keeper!

Excellent cornbread! I added 1 Tbsp. of oil and 2 Tbsp. of honey, which still kept it lowfat and made it taste even better.

The texture is not crumbly and cake-like but is firmer and denser. It has an excellent flavor and is perfectly moist. It's especially good with fat-free margarine and/or honey. I will make this again. My family likes this better than the higher fat versions.

This tastes the best warm from the oven.  I love the light texture and good corn flavor.  Using yogurt with fruit inside gives it added interest and sweetness.  Thanks for the fun recipe!

Excellent cornbread!  My whole family loved it.  It was even better than my old recipe that used 1/2 c. oil.  Thanks for a great low-fat recipe Maria!

These were very good for being healthy.  It is little drier than I would like but you can't have everything, right?

I made this with greek yogurt because it was what I had one hand. The batter was way too thick and the first batch came out very dry. The second time I used greek yogurt with about 1/4 cup milk and 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. It turned out way better with these additions!

Wow! I'm originally from SC so I'm kinda picky about my cornbread...Mama and Granmama were great cornbread makers. I needed to use up some plain yogurt to I tried this recipe. The only changes I made were to use Splenda in place of the sugar plus a tiny squeeze of honey(less than a tablespoon). I also used a little bit(about a tablespoon) of the new "Enova" oil. It was so good and moist, not too sweet and the texture stayed nice for a couple of days afterwards. We liked the leftover chunks split and toasted with a touch of grated sharp cheddar cheese sprinked on then. I am looking forward to making another batch and adding some chopped fresh jalapenos! Thanks!

Delicious!  This was the most popular component in the dinner I made last night!  I did make a couple minor alterations, though.  I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat flour.  Instead of plain yogurt, I used lowfat vanilla.  I also added about a cup of (drained and rinsed) whole kernal corn, which definitely added some moisture to the batter.  Next time I may throw in some no-sugar-added apple sauce for even more moisture (not that the bread was dry, but I really like mine soft).  I am always on the lookout for healthy versions of popular recipes, and this one is absolutely great!  I'm definitely keeping it bookmarked!

Very bland. The cornbread I used wasn't the sweet kind, so if you try this recipe, use a very sweet cornbread.

Perfect substitute when you don't want full fat, full calorie corn bread!  In the couple of times I've made this, I used vanilla non fat, no sugar yogurt, added a 4 oz natural apple sauce for moisture, replaced the eggs with 1/2 cup egg beaters, and used Splenda instead of sugar.  Changed the baking tempt to 375 to compensate for the Splenda and baked in muffin tin for 15 minutes.  Next time I might try adding butter flavored extract for additional richness without the calories!

I like this corn bread because it held together very good and had body. Had an excellent flavor. Also I used whole wheat flour which I think made it even better.

This was a super easy, tasty and quick recipe. By accident I added 1 cup sugar rather than 1/4 (which no doubt made the recipe more fattening) but was delicious. No need for honey when you've got the extra sugar -- but my dinner guest slathered the honey on anyhow. I made corn muffins out of the batter and cooked them at a slightly lower temperature.

I have to give this a 4 because I believe reading the reviews paid off. I used 1/2 white, 1/2 wheat flour and upped the leavening agents. (1t soda and 1/2t powder). All in all, it was very good. It rose perfectly and was moist without being soupy. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

I have been searching for a good cornbread recipe and I've finally found it!  I follow a fairly strict diet and was glad I could find a recipe that worked well within this.  I used oat flour instead of wheat and substituted about 1 Tbsp honey for the sugar.  The results were fantastic!  I found it worked well for either muffins or bread, and kept well on the counter for a few days after baking.  This recipe is bookmarked and I will continue to go back to it.

This is great bread.  Not too sweet and very soft and moist.  A good texture.  Every one in the family loved it.  I replaced the white flour with whole wheat. I recomend doing that.
I plan to make it again this week!

We didn't care for this recipe. The cornbread turned out kind of dry and it didn't taste like much past the yogurt. Not even half of it got eaten. I'm sorry, I really wanted this to work out. I really think this would be a fair cornbread with some melted butter in plade of some of the yogurt but then that wouldn't be this recipe.

I had a craving for cornbread but didn't have any milk. I found this recipe. I only had vanilla yogurt, so I used that and omitted the sugar because I was worried it would be too sweet. It wasn't sweet at all. I'll definitely make this again, but I'll keep the sugar in! The texture is great. It is also great straight out of the oven with butter (which makes it less healthy, but too bad!)

This is a great recipe, and so easy! I used egg beaters and made muffins (to maximize crust area -- I like a lot of crust on my breads). The texture was wonderful, just the right amount of moistness and chewiness. Wonderful with cream cheese!

I love this recipe and prefer it over store bought cornbread mixes.  Although something that folks accustomed to the finer texture of boxed mixes, I like the texture that the cornmeal provides.  Great right out of the oven with butter and a drizzle of honey!

I made this twice, exactly as directed. At 400 degrees, after 20 minutes I had a dried out brick. The second time I pulled it out after 12 mins and it was definitely more moist but was super dense. Not my fave.

This was really good!!  It was moist & dense, just how we like it; it was the perfect accompaniment to our turkey chili.  We did add a touch of honey to the mix, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Will definitely be using this one again!

I found this to be an EXCELLENT cornbread-- not toothache sweet, good amount of cornmeal flavor.  It has a terrific texture which I greatly prefer to the standard pile of warm cornbread crumbs I'd been content with.  Delicious.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

Was not quite as flavorful as my higher fat version of cornbread. Texture was a little different too;not as grainy and moist-er.  Still was VERY GOOD. I'll go with healthier, any day, so I will make again. Probably will add 1/4 c honey though;maybe the sweetness will make it taste a little less bland.

Even though I loved the final result, I changed A LOT about this recipe. I added a can of creamed corn, cut out the sugar, and cut the yogurt by half (and used full-fat). Baked it for 20 mins and it turned out perfectly! Next time I may put a tiny bit more salt in it though.

UPDATE: I have officially made this recipe 3 times with different substitutions, including the original version. The creamed corn version I outline above is absolutely the best. The creamed corn makes it so moist and perfect! The full-fat yogurt probably helped too. This is obvious, but the more damp the dough is when you put it in the oven, the less dry it will turn out. The wetter the better!

This turned out a little odd.  I used greek yogurt, so added about 1/4 cup milk.  It was still very thick.  Cooked at 350 and it was done in 25 min.

I've made this twice now, and have been very pleased with it.  The only change that I made was substituting half of the white flour with whole wheat, as other reviewers mentioned.  The bread has a nice structure and a good corn flavor, and I like that it isn’t cloyingly sweet.  It is a little dry, but not so much that I won’t keep making it.  I would recommend using a good, stone- or water-ground, organic cornmeal – in a recipe as simple as this, the quality and richer flavor really shine through.

This is so moist for not having any oil in it, and uses items we usually have on hand.  Much better than the mixes you buy!  I will definitely make this again- great with Chili!

I loved this recipe. I tweaked the recipe a tad.. The changes I made were I used nonfat Greek yogurt, used 1/4c whole wheat flour, cut the unbleached flour down to 3/4c and added 1/2 can of creamed corn. This is the best cornbread I've ever made!

I love the texture of this cornbread, it isn't crumbly at all. I do think the people that added a little honey were probably on the smart side, as I wish it had been a little sweeter. Much more moist than I expected! Also, it was awesome right out of the oven, but quite a bit more dry the next day.

I didn't have yogurt so I used 1c. sour cream. They were ok hot out of the oven but I didn't care for them the next day. Hubby, who loves corn bread, didn't think they were that great either. They're waiting on the counter to be thrown in the disposal. :(

I gave this 3 stars because it's a great basic recipe to work off of, but it is definitely lacking in flavor. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (fyi- I cut the recipe in half so adjust accordingly) and used fat free vanilla yogurt instead of plain. Despite those changes, the cornbread was still fairly bland. I was able to make 5 heaping muffins from the mix. Baked at 400 for 15 minutes. The tops were turning brown so next time I will lower the oven temperature to 375. I found these are best eaten straight from the oven. They took on a rubbery texture once they cooled. I'll be using this recipe in the future and will make sure to add some healthy sweeteners such as Agave Nectar.

I had my doubts about this cornbread, but WOW they were really  good. I did cheat a bit when I put about a tablespoon of butter in the pan and heated it to melt and grease the pan, then poured the batter in. So they did have some fat, but not nearly as much as I normally use. This is a keeper recipe!

I thought a little something was missing, maybe a bit more salt or sugar?  Hubby liked it.  Bake for 25 minutes next time - 20 wasn't quite done in the middle even though it looked done.

I have never made cornbread before so didn't know what to expect. Theses where really yummy not dry at all and I love the fact that they is no fat in the recipe so almost guilt free eating. Used muffin pan for this didn't have pan called for. They are lovely hot but where also very good sliced and fried in a pan next day using a little butter or butter spray.

I made this for dinner last night and both my wife and I claimed it to be the best cornbread we'd EVER had!  I followed a couple other suggestions and added a 4oz can of chopped green chilis, used whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of frozen corn.  This is fabulous!  I added a photo (the one in the red casarole dish.

I read most of the reviews before making this recipe. I used plain lowfat yogurt, and added a heaping 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and a little extra baking soda. I also used all whole-wheat flour instead of white, and it came out great! I don't really like too-sweet cornbread, so the 1/4 C of sugar was perfect for this recipe. This was so easy to make...the key to good cornbread is to not overmix or overbake it!

So Good! We prefer our cornbread spicy as opposed to sweet. I cut back on the sugar slightly, added a 1/2 cup kernel corn and a heaping Tbsp. crushed chili's. It has a slightly tangy taste from the yogurt that gives it some pep.

I was looking for a low-fat cornbread recipe and this one was great!! I made it with1/2 cup vanilla yogurt, and 1/2 cup of fruit yogurt (I ram out of vanilla), the cornbread was moist with just enough sweetness. Great job Maria!!

This was the best cornbread recipe I have ever made ! It did not stick to the pan, and was very moist , despite no oil added.It was excellent! If you don't like sweet cornbread you could leave out or cut back on the sugar. I used Splenda Blend in mine and we loved it!

Made it for a chili cook off, everyone loved it! Added a small can of corn to the mix for texture. Make it healthier by subbing a couple scoops of steiva for the sugar, & 1/2C of wheat bran or flax meal for 1/2C of the white flour.

Great alternative and healthy side to soup cooking in the crockpot all day! I added a small spoonful of honey to the batter and everyone had seconds. I consider that a success.

Love it! It is the first time I ever tried cornbread! Love it love it!!! But I did a little change by adding more baking powder, but it turns out to fluffy and taste a little bit bitter. Next time, definitely stick to the recipe!

Cornbread was very dry. Keeping the cornbread in the oven for 20 minutes was a bit too long. It was decent for being a low fat recipe. Maybe next time I'll try adding honey and shortening the oven time as other reviews recommended.

Great for what it is! If you're excepting the cornbread that is filled with butter, this is very different. As a low fat recipe,  it is a very tasty 4 star cornbread. I baked in a 9x9 pyrex glass dish and lined with parchment.

This is my first time trying out a low fat cornbread, and I was VERY skeptical as I am known for my butter and cheese laden cornbread. As I expected, this was a very low fat tasting recipe, but with the addition of more flavour it could me much more amazing. This time I added about 1 cup of frozen corn niblets, but next time I think I might also add some finely diced onion, jalepeno, garlic, and more spices/herbs. I will make this again.

After reading many of the reviews I expected this to be dry and it was. But I didn't mind that. It was not sweet enough for me, but I had no problem eating it! I used honey instead of sugar and wasn't sure, based on the reviews/comments, if those folks were ADDING honey to the existing sugar or subbing.

I only had plain 2% Greek yogurt on hand and decided to use that.  When I mixed everything together it was really dry so I added some milk to make it more like a cornbread consistency.  It tasted okay but lacked the sweetness I was looking for.  The consistency was like a really, really dense cake and did not crumble like I had hoped.  I don't know if it was the Greek yogurt or the recipe but I won't make it again.

This recipe is great! As others have posted, this bread is not crumbly and airy, but I really enjoy it's denser texture. It's filling without being super heavy; the perfect companion to a bowl of chili. The batter is very thick and "sticky." I thought I had missed an ingredient at first but after double-checking, I used a spatula to get it into my pan and then 20 minutes later, it was done and beautiful! I did add some honey to my batter and cut a bit of the sugar out (personal preference). I also thought that the top was getting too dark so after about 12 minutes, I cut the heat to 350 and finished it on that. I would definitely make this again and recommend it to anyone (for even those not looking for a "healthy" recipe, they won't even know the difference)!!

This was really good.  To up the health factor I used half whole wheat flour, half white and used honey instead of sugar.  It was a little more dense due to the WW flour and the color was a little different but overall we really liked it.  I love cornbread but hate how bad it is for you so this is a nice compromise.

For Low Fat this is as good as it gets!  I added 1/4 cup of honey and used whole eggs and this was fantastice!  My "cornbread snob" kiddo even loved these.  FYI, I kept mine in the fridge and 2 days later they startet to get soggy, so if you do this be sure to plan on warming them in the toaster to dry them back out a bit.  This is a definite keeper!!!!

I made these in muffin form. I cooked them for about 22 minutes and next time I will probably only put them in for 17 or so minutes. They turn out really good though. I will also probably substitute honey instead of sugar next time too.

Awesome!!! THE BEST CORNBREAD WE HAVE HAD IN OUR LIVES!!! I did add a few things to suit our taste,  but the original recipe is a great starting point for healthy cornbread.  Add green chiles, jalapenos, and canned canned corn for incredibly moist and wonderful cornbread!  You will NOT miss the oil.

Lovely! I ate last night (with honey) and today (with maple syrup) and it stayed moist enough to enjoy again.  Great texture and healthy alternative to oil.  I did add a bit of honey to the batter, as well.

Used whole wheat flour, stone-ground whole-grain cornmeal, and organic whole plain yogurt. Used 1/2 the sugar called for. Tasted fantastic and was perfectly suited for a nutritionally conscious southern girl!

Absolutely delicious! I used whole grain wheat flour and self rising corn meal mix, plus 1/4 teaspoon baking soda. I sweetened with 1/4 cup of honey. This made it perfect for me. Use 1/2 cup if you like a sweeter cornbread. I baked in a non stick 9x9 square pan sprayed with cooking oil. I used a little over a cup of yogurt (to make sure it was moistened well) the two eggs and baked at 400 degrees as written. PERFECT! It rose, browned, and tasted wonderful. I will never use another recipe other than this one for cornbread again. Thanks so much for sharing!

The best healthy option I have tried so far, and I have tried alot.  I used whole wheat flour and stone ground meal. Had to add about half a cup of water/milk due to whole wheat flour.  Baked up beautiful.  Flavor is very good.

Used 1/4 cup honey. Delicious and light. Even tried it once with vanilla yogurt. Made for a sweeter taste. Do not use egg whites as the bread comes out heavier.

This was pretty good. I made it exactly as written! The yogurt gave it a sour dough flavor. It was perfect with "The Best Ham and Bean Soup" recipe, also from this site. I was looking for a cornbread recipe with simple ingredients that I had on hand. I also wanted it to be dense enough for dipping and this worked out fine! It wasn't too sweet which was what I also wanted.

This is a good, healthier recipe.   I did add 2 Tbsp. honey with the egg and yogurt, plus 1 Tbsp. minced jarred Jalapeno.  This made for a moist cornbread with a hint of sweet and heat.

The reviewer who mentioned to use the "sweet mix."...DON'T use a corn bread mix.  You want corn meal, which is found near the flour at the grocery store.   This recipe implies that the baker is adding the other ingredients that the mix would already have in it.   This may be why some recipes didn't turn out.  I found the recipe to be moist, with a sponge cake consistency, sweet, and delicious.

These are fabulous!  Since I don't use sugar I added 1/4 cup of honey and I used soy flour and vanilla soy yogurt since that's what I had.  The batter was dry and I had to add more yogurt.  Since they came out so moist we didn't even need any butter!

I wanted to LOVE this recipe....really, I did.  BUT.  It was so incredibly dry and it was the first time I have ever HAD to throw a dollop of butter on my cornbread.  I did add some applesauce to the batter and I also added a can of chopped jalapenos.  Probably won't make this one again, but it was worth a shot.  Thanks anyway!

Finally a lower calorie cornbread that tastes good!  I took it out at 20 minutes and it was pleasantly moist and sweet enough to eat without adding extra honey or butter.  I added 2 Tablespoons applesauce to the mixture because it looked a little dry.  I couldn’t ask for more from a cornbread with so little fat.

For what this recipe is, it really is excellent. It took longer for the oven to heat up to 400 than it did for me to put this together and into a pan. I only had a 6 oz container of yougurt, so I added a splash of skim milk until the mixture came together. I baked this in a skillet for 16 minutes and it was perfect. The second day it was around it seemed a little dry, but otherwise it really wasn't too bad (although not particularly sweet)

these turned out really well!! i was impressed with their texture and moisture. i used about 2T more yogurt than the recipe called for, and i didn't have any sugar so i used buckwheat honey (about 1/3 to 1/2 cup). the buckwheat honey gave it a rich flavor. really really good... will make again for sure!!

Great recipie!  I wouldn't change a thing.  I love the fact that there is no oil, it makes it AlMOST guilt free!  This isn't as good the next day, so try to eat it all at once.

I've made this recipe now for several years & tweaked it a bit to make it even healthier & I think tastier!  Instead of 1 cup flour, use 1/4 cup unbleached flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, & 1/4 cup ground flax seed.  Replace sugar with 1/3 cup of honey.  I use a nonfat sugar free vanilla yogurt & replace one of the eggs with 1/4 cup Eggbeaters.  When it comes out of the oven, spray top with "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" spray.  Excellent with soups or chili.

This was excellent and so easy to make.  I added 2 T. of honey for added sweetness.  Thanks for the wonderful healthy and low fat recipe.  So nice to enjoy the cornbread guilt-free.

Make sure the pan is greased well-I just used cooking spray and it stuck more than I’d like. Other than that is was SUPER FAST, and SUPER DELICIOUS! I love the grittiness of the cornmeal unlike the boxed cornbread mix.

I live in Colorado. It needed a half cup water. I used Greek yogurt. I cooked it in an iron skillet that was coated with olive oil. It turned out perfectly.

I switched the sugar and used erithritol sugar substitute and added 1/2 cup of almond milk. The bread rose and was nice and spongy, not very sweet. Good compliment to spicy chili and only 2 WW points per muffin.

This was so delicious!  I did make a few changes because mine was too thick.  I used 1/2 c. white flour and 1/2 c. wheat flour and also added two Tbsp of milk, 1 Tbsp grapeseed oil, and a little non-sweetened apple sauce.  I also skipped the sugar and added two packets of stevia because I don't like really sweet cornbread.  It was moist yet crumbly.  Next time I will add the canned corn and some green chilis or jalepenos for spice!  This was perfect four soup and chili and I will make it 100 more times!

The first time I made this recipe the batter was ridiculously thick and the cornbread came out dry.  I realized after it was because I used greek yogurt instead of non-fat which is my preference.  The second time I made it was MUCH more successful with these small changes:  Greek yogurt instead of regular non-fat, replace the sugar with 2 TBSP of raw honey, add 1/4 cup low-fat milk and 1 TBSP of melted butter to help thin the batter. I also added 1/2 cup sweet corn.  Delicious!

I actually really like this recipe; the way I made it turned out not so dry at all but very moist and flavorful. I had to alter it a bit after reading the reviews and also because I didn't have all the ingredients. 

I had only a 6 oz fat free vanilla flavored yogurt so I added on a small container of apple sauce (Mott's all natural) with it. Keep in mind, this is 3.9 oz of apple sauce so total was about 10 oz of flavored "liquid." I also added a tablespoon of maple/agave syrup. 

For dry ingredients, I used 1/2 tsp salt and switched white sugar for coconut sugar but kept everything else the same. First, I mixed the dry ingredients very, very well. Then I mixed the wet ingredients very, very well but separately. Then I made a hole in the dry ingredients and poured the wet ingredients in, mixing only enough for the dry to get a little wet. ;) This took about 15 seconds total; definitely do not over mix! 

Then, I spread it in an 8x8 pre-buttered baking dish (batter will be thick) and baked at 385 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes. At the 15 minutes mark, I took it out and brushed a little melted butter/maple syrup mixture on top, put it back into the oven, and BROIL it on high for about 1-2 minutes. 

Took it out, took a bite, and oh my... it was very moist, lightly sweet, and yummy! I would make this again, exactly as I've done above. Froze the leftovers after they've cooled and now I can just bake a piece in a toaster oven whenever I want cornbread. Definitely a keeper.

so excellent. I baked it in a cast iron frying pan...did use only 5oz of yogurt but put water in the little yogurt cup to get the goodies left over and poured that in..saves money on oil and yogurt. Came out perfect!

My kids gave this a 5 star rating. I'm not a cornbread fan but thought it was delicious. I made alot of changes because I didn't have a few things: yogurt & eggs. I substituted 3/4 of sour cream and 1/4 cup of oil for the yogurt. I also substituted 2T of white vinegar + 2T of water + 2t of baking powder for the 2 eggs called for in the recipe. Believe it or not, this recipe held its on as a base despite these changes.

I made these using suggestions from other reviewers since I'm on a healthy diet: I used all whole wheat flour, Splenda instead of sugar, added 1/4 cup honey, and added 4 oz of applesauce to make it more moist. I couldn't find vanilla yogurt, so I used peach instead! Couldn't taste it in the final result. I also added 1/2 tsp baking powder and reduced the temperature to 375 degrees, and baked it in muffin tins for about 13 minutes. They still turned out a little dry, and not very sweet--kind of bland, actually. But satisfied my cornbread craving certainly, especially for something so healthy! Next time, I'll probably try adding some canned corn and increasing the sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent quick and healthy recipe. I tweak mine to my liking, however, in two respects. I add less sugar (despite my Northern tastes, having recently lived in the South, I can no longer bring myself to add much sugar to cornbread). I also add a little more salt if the cornbread is going to be eaten with a savory dish. Also, I use lowfat yogurt, which gives a little more body and moisture to the bread.

We didn't have any plain yogurt, so we used what we had, which was caramel apple.  Followed the recipe otherwise.  It doesn't make very much.  Too mini loaf pans (4 servings).  Tastewise:  Overall, very good!

One of the best, and very moist all by itself. I've successfully substituted both the sugar with honey and the milk yogurt with soy yogurt with excellent results.

Moist and Delish! I didn't have plain non-fat yogurt so I used Vanilla non-fat instead and added leftover corn from dinner. They turned out yummy. I love the texture too!

excellent! the first time, though, i used an extra 1/2c yogurt because it seemed like it needed to be more viscous.  the second time, i added a stick of butter because i wanted to see if it would be any more moist, but it didn't make a difference.  the third time, i threw in some cheese and jalapenos.  as you can see, i enjoyed the recipe alot in a 2 week time frame.  A for flexibility and taste.  oh, i forgot, i omitted the sugar because i don't like sweet cornbread.  actually, the second time, i split the batter and added a 1/4c sugar to one half for my sweet-toothed hubby - he liked it.  thanks!

First success making cornbread, thank you very much. I used vanilla yogurt, 8oz [[lessened sugar to compensate]], an subbed the rest of the cup with sour cream. Follwed everything else exact. The mixture seemed quite thick, but again I've never had luck with this sort of dealio. The taste I agree could be more robust but for the health factor I raise it to a 5. Thank you very much for sharing!! I love it

Excellent.  Used splenda, egg beaters, and the light n fit vanilla yogurt.  I added a little squirt of honey but the bread was sweet from the yogurt so not sure what the honey really added.  Hubby is a cornbread lover so it's nice to have a healthy alternative.  Will definitely make again!

This was amazing ! I didn't have nonfat yogurt so I used regular yogurt, and I had to add a little milk (about 1/4 cup) because the batter was a bit thick. I only used 1/8 cup of sugar because I didn't want a very sweet cornbread, and it turned out great ! It made 13 muffins, not crumbly at all, more on the spongy side, and quite moist. Also great with some grated cheese in the batter. We had them with chili con carne for dinner, and my husband loved them. I never thought a low fat cornbread could taste so good ! Thank you very much for sharing, I will definitely make these again.

Very dense, very good cornbread. I double the salt, add 1 cup of frozen corn, 1 4 oz can of fire-roasted green chiles. Otherwise, it is a bit bland.

not bad for a no oil cornbread. I forgot to add the eggs, but it still came out very good, also used whole wheat flour. I will make it again.

This was very good and so simple to make. Used 1% instead of nonfat yogurt, because that's what I had and it was delicious. Could add any number of other flavours to it - herbs, grated cheese, garlic. Thanks!

Fantastic! Very easy and very tasty. I was worried about it not tasting much like regular cornbread since it's got yogurt in it, but it's great! And moist and chewy. Goes really well with the Ham and Beans recipe. Thanks very much!

Kids and adults liked this at our house.  It has a different texture than the more cake-like or dessert-like cornbreads.  It is more moist and chewy and we are glad to have a healthier cornbread recipe.  We will make this again.  It is great with honey.

I've made this a couple of times now and I like it a lot.  Nothing special, just good cornbread.  To make it even healthier, egg beaters work well as a substitute for eggs.  To add a little kick I mixed in part of a can of diced tomatoes with chilis (this was really good).

This recipe does exactly what it says, and makes a mildly sweet and healthy cornbread. I don't taste the yogurt at all; I used Dannon yogurt, having found that some of the organic/natural brands of yogurt have different bacterial cultures that may result in a much more pungent flavor.

The flavor and texture make it an excellent side dish with chili or similar dishes, as its denser texture will keep it from falling apart.

I followed the recipe to a "t" and it turned out flat and tasteless. It needs some baking powder (or soda, whichever one it is that causes it to rise...). I might try this again with some tweaks, but odds are I'll probably just find another recipe. Thanks though...

I've been making this since 2004-we prefer it over traditional recipes.  I've added green chilis, corn, bacon, cheese, and pretty much anything else that sounds good at the time.  I've also made it with 1/2 whole wheat flour.  The recipe is a perfect cornbread as is, it's a little heavy with the whole wheat flour, and open to all sorts of experimentation.  It's a perfect accompaniment to chili, too.  Thanks!

Easy and delicious cornbread recipe; the yogurt gives it a subtle tang. It's wonderful with the batter spread over chili and baked until risen to make a cornbread crust.

I thought this was great -- easy, healthy, tasty, and fast!  I substituted egg whites for the eggs and some honey for most of the sugar (I had run out of white sugar).  I served it with butter and honey with a BBQ chicken salad.  Yum!

This was fantastic.  My honey is not a fan of corn bread at all, but he liked this one and said that he would like to have it again.  One fortunate accident--I didn't realize that my plain yogurt was actually sweetened (very small letters underneath "Plain Yogurt") but it worked out perfectly, and added the extra sweetness that was mentioned by other reviewers, I think.  And for anyone wondering, there was NO yogurt taste at all.  (I like yogurt but was wary of how the taste would come through in the bread, and was happy to discover that it did not.)  Try it!

Delicious.  I added about a cup of canned, drained whole kernel corn, which adds some moisture to each bite, but is was plenty moist.  Feel less guilty about slapping on a bit of butter and honey.  Thanks, very good. recipe, and easy.

This was a nice idea, and the flavor was good but it was very dry! It also got overdone after less than 20 minutes, so keep an eye on it.

The flavor wasn't so great, but that is probably because my cornmeal was on its last leg and I used nonfat vanilla yogurt (and no sugar!) instead of PLAIN.  The GREAT news is that, as posted, this recipe only has TWO POINTS per serving for all of you Weight Watchers!!!

The kids loved this!  I used whole wheat flour instead of white and the texture was very good.

I really love this recipe. Besides the fact that it tastes good, the recipe didn't call for anything I didn't have. It's very pleasing for those that try and eat healthier. I actually didn't have any plain yogurt in my house, so I used peach nonfat yogurt. I was a little unsure about that, but it turned out quite nicely.

This was such a great recipe. I think it tastes better than the actual regular cornbread. I will make this recipe over and over again. Really great taste.

This had a very nice comsistency and taste.  It was not as crumbly as other cornbread.  I substituted honey for sugar and added some corn to the batter.

Yummy and very moist!  I replaced the salt with seasoned salt, left out the sugar, and put in 1/2c finely grated sharp cheddar and 1/2c corn.  I'll add 2 tsp sugar next time.

This is a great recipe for cornbread! The only change I made was to add 1/4 c. of honey which gave it a little more sweetness & the great taste of honey that I love with cornbread was baked right in. Perfect- and guilt-free!

I used greek yogart and had to add probably 1/2 cup of skim milk. Without the milk it was a dry dough than a batter. Even after the milk I still had to spread it into the pan with a spatula. I also used a preheated cast iron skillet with olive oil in the bottom. This gave it a nice crispy bottom crust. Cooking took closer to 15 minutes than 20 minutes. It turned out really well and has a very pleasant texture. It's not crumbly at all and holds together really well.

This is a dense cornbread and not sweet. I saw the comments about adding honey but opted to just add 1 tablespoon which is not enough if you are used to sweet cornbread. Acgood recipe that I will make again. These muffins baked in 15 minutes in my oven. Next time I will lower temperature to 375 degrees.

By itself it’s kind of dry and tasteless. But it’s a great idea to use the yogurt and a lot less sugar. I will try the suggestion to add 1/4 cup of honey next time and maybe even the one tablespoon of oil.

I used whole fat yogurt 1/4 almond milk and reduced sugar by since the almond milk has a little sugar and I wanted to add some honey. I refer my cornbread not sweet and to eat with salted butter. Came out moist and everyone LOVED it. Will make again.

This recipe is missing some kind of liquid. I made it but I could not mix it because it was so dry.  Total mess.  I went ahead with baking thinking a miracle would happen. It did not.  Something is missing.  Had to throw it out.

I think it turned out good! I added 1 tablespoon of honey to sweeten slightly but next time I might add one or two more. Think I over cooked it for a couple of minutes because it is pretty brown and slightly dryer than I would have liked, might add a little coconut oil next time to see if that will help. Overall, for a healthier cornbread, I thought if was very good. Great with some butter.

Not much flavor so I ate it with lots of butter, kind of defeats the ‘no oil’ thing. Will look for a different rcipe.

I took the advice of recent reviews and added a couple of tablespoons of honey and vegetable oil plus a little less sugar, and added some milk to make the mixture stirrable. This cornbread was devoured by the family within 30 minutes - delicious, not too sweet and very good with chili!

I made as directed. This was so good-I can’t believe it’s only 100 calories per piece. As a side note, the batter is really thick - I had to press it into the pan. I thought I did something wrong, but it came out perfect.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was - moist, with great texture.  I added a slug of honey and a drizzle of vegetable oil to the yogurt before mixing it in to the dry ingredients.  I replaced the sugar with granulated Swerve. 

I don't know if it had any impact on the outcome, but I made the batter a few hours before baking, and put it in the fridge until a half-hour before it went in the oven.

I made this and recognized pretty quickly that this needs milk added or it will come out too dry I added about 3/4 cup of almond milk. I also used brown sugar, vanilla flavored Greek yogurt. It came out pretty well. Next time I plan to add less flour 
and more cornmeal like a 1/4 cup swap of each. I read comments after mine was in the oven and saw others have added almond milk as well. Not sure if it is an ommission in the recipe, but definitely add milk.

Did not like this at all... I’ll not make it again. It was dry and had an odd taste to it.

This is so tasty and I love that there's no oil in it. I didn't have any yogurt so I replaced that with buttermilk and added frozen roasted corn kernels from Trader Joe's. Delicious!

substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for the white;  Added a Tbsp. flaxseed meal....used some of the sugar, but also subbed in about a Tbsp. honey and a teaspoon of vanilla. Also added a half Tbsp. canola oil. All of these made the recipe moist and hopefully a little healthy with the WW flour and flaxseed meal.  Baked them as muffins, so lowered the heat to 375 and baked for 17 minutes.  They're just right for a dinner muffin with pulled pork or a breakfast muffin...not too sweet, but sweet enough; nice tender crumb and moist!

I am on a low fat diet. This is amazing. I have made cornbread the traditional way for my family in the past. They raved about it then I told them that I used no fat plain yogurt. Both wanted recipe. Had to bake 10 minutes longer.

I made some changes as I'm Gluten Free. Substituted oat flour for the AP flour, and swapped maple syrup for the sugar.  Came out great.

I made this recipe exactly as said and it was bland, dry, and overcooked by 16 minutes. Next time I will try adding honey and cooking for less time. Or even better idea- just find a new recipe. Annoying, though. I was happy to find a healthy and sour cream free (I think sour cream cornbread is gross) recipe. I just wish it was tastier.

The taste was amazing! This is definitely a keeper! I added about a tablespoon of almond milk because the mixture was a little thick. Next time I will add honey. Overall, great taste!

Was better than expected for "healthy" cornbread. I made it as recipe listed plus a splash of honey (as some people noted). I put it in the oven for 20min and checked in on it at 18min and it was already getting a tad dark on the top. It still tasted great, just a little dry. I will probably add a little more yogurt, or a splash of oil next time; and keep a closer eye on it while cooking. But definitely recommend it and will be making it again.

Excellent! I took a chance and used vanilla nonfat yogurt. It turned out very well. Based on other reviews, I added 1/4 cup honey and am pleased with the slight sweetness in the final result. Fyi, the way I made it is about 150 calories per slice, compared to 225+ from other recipes. Very pleased.

Made this using a muffin pan instead of a loaf pan. Reduce the baking time down to 7-10 minutes. Yield is 12 muffins.

Additionally I made the following substitutions:

Replace the 1/4 cup sugar with honey
I used plain nonfat greek yogurt and increased the amount by 1/4 cup to 1 and 1/4 cups yogurt.

Also, if you'd like an additional kick, add 1/2 - 1 whole jalapeño diced to the batter depending upon taste.

I substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for half of the white, used unsweetened almond milk instead of yogurt, replaced the sugar with Splenda and poured it into a hot, oiled cast iron skillet to give it a nice chewy, crispie crust.  Baked it only 18 minutes and it was great.   My husband never asks me for anything  because he doesn't want me in the kitchen late into the evening.  But this is one recipe that he will ask for.  So I will continue to used this recipe.  NOTE: For the hot skillet trick, I put a tablespoon  or so of olive oil in my cast iron skillet and slide it into the oven while it's preheating and I'm mixing the batter together.  When my batter is ready, I pour it directly into the hot skillet.  It should sizzle when you do this!  Makes for a great texture.

I love this recipe.  Since I am diabetic, I must watch sugar intake.  I make another recipe from a diabetic cookbook, but so many steps.   Recipe got my eye, because it was made with yogurt (which I make my own to control sugars and preservatives).  I  took suggestions from other reviewers and added couple items as well:  2 tablespoons honey and applesauce; as well as, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder.  Next time I might add 1 teaspoon vanilla.   Also not sure if other reviewers meant white whole wheat or whole wheat so I made it with 1/2 cup white whole wheat and 1/2 cup white flour.   Cornbread was not dry at all.   Also I baked at 400 and crust was too brown, and not quite done inside.  It could be my countertop oven, but next time will turn down to 350 and bake longer -- possibly 25 -30 mins, or until done. 

But I will make it again -- very, very tasty and so easy to make.  Great with  chili, or just as desert after dinner with homemade fruit spread.

I made this with Greek yogurt and the batter came out really thick. I didn't have any milk, so I added water until the consistency was right. The finished muffins had good flavor, but the texture was pretty muffin-like, rather than crumbly and cornbread-like. It was a great accompaniment for chili, though, and it did taste pretty good. I would definitely try it again with plain yogurt or by adding some milk with the Greek yogurt.

I wanted to find a good recipe without using buttermilk or cream and ended up finding this one. This recipe is easy and bakes really quickly and evenly. I made it with no sugar at all and it tasted great. Also I've made it multiple times and every time it has tasted great. Reheat it in the toaster oven or oven.

Good texture and flavor. Just not sweet enough for my taste. My family prefers the "golden sweet cornbread", also on this site. This one is the runner up. But, I will make it again with tad more sugar.

This is my first time making this. I used all-purpose flour and white cornmeal. It came out great and it was delicious. My Husband even loved it. We've never had anything like it. We both ate two slices. I'll be using this recipe from now on.

I like this quite a lot and have made it about five times.  I cut back the sugar and add a couple of tablespoons of honey.  I usually add a small can of salt-free corn, and some vanilla extract.  I like the texture and the fact that it is relatively healthy. I'm going to keep making this one.

I used sour cream instead of yogurt and found the batter to be exceedingly dry -- actually, it wasn't even pourable. I added some milk to thin it out. No, it does not taste exactly like cornbread made with oil or butter, but it was quite tasty all the same.

My first time ever making cornbread...definitely won't be the last!  I added a quarter cup of milk and 1 tbsp of oil as I used greek yoghurt as recommended by another commentator.  I used whole wheat flour to make it even healthier.  Came out great.  Thank you very much for this recipe, it's definitely going in the "keeper" folder.  :)

Great recipe! I didn't have plain yogurt on hand so I just used whipping cream instead. I also made them into muffins and baked them for 15 minutes. They were delicious!!

I used a large muffin baking pans
I substituted and used Greek yogurt,
I added 1 cup mocha mix . 
Honey,and put cut a piece of cheddar  in the center of each muffin.

This is a wonderful cornbread recipe that is easy to make and lower in calories than the cornbread made with butter. I have made it a few times now using  low fat vanilla yogurt. I have cooked it in a loaf pan as well as made muffins, though of course you must decrease the cooking time when making muffins. Serve with butter, margarine or honey butter. Delicious!

I am actually quite surprised at how well this turned out. I added a bit of milk and honey to my batter as it was really thick, almost like dough.

This is good and healthy. The only type of yogurt i had was Greek and like another reviewer said, it's too dense with just the Greek yogurt. Next time, I'll add some milk, maybe a tbsp of oil or if planning ahead, get the regular yogurt. The amount of sugar was fine. The recipe was super easy, too, I probably made it in 5 minutes.

Texture and taste was excellent with a light brown crust. I needed a recipe that used plain greek yogurt not milk so it was perfect  but since I didn't need low fat, I used a tablespoon of canola oil. I think cornbread needs oil but will try it next time without. Very good with my turnip greens.  will make again!

Amazing! I made it into muffins instead, and they turned out wonderfully. Be careful not to overcook. The muffins were done in just ten minutes! I feel like it is missing something but am not an experienced cook, so I couldn't tell you what that would be. I will definitely make this recipe again!

This is my go-to recipe for cornbread when I'm making chili. No guilt. Dry enough to sop up sauces, moist enough to have a pleasant texture. So easy. I love simple recipes that taste good.

I was looking for a low fat cornbread recipe , found this recipe  and was a little skeptical at the beginning to try it. I gave it a shot anyways . I made muffins instead of the bread ( need to get a cake pan soon )To my surprise this was a total hit! I added Jalepenos for the spice and everyone at home loved it . Made more for a dinner party we were attending and they were  gone in a minute . Everyone loved it .

Definitely a keeper!!

I've made this twice now. The first time the muffins were ok but not great. I added 2 T. oil and 1 T. milk the second time I made them. That made them more to my taste. All in all this is a good recipe thanks for sharing.

Just made a batch and tweaked it a bit. No sugar, but used stevia and a bit of raw honey. Added a bit of organic half-n-half and a cup of frozen organic corn. Must say, it's awesome while it's hot, with a dollop of softened butter. YUM!

I used vanilla greek yogurt (cause it was all I had). It was more muffin tasting then cornbread tasting. For what it was my husband and I liked it, but it was not cornbread like. Still yummy though

This cornbread definitely tasted healthy. I have been making Golden Sweet Cornbread, on the site, for years. So, I had a comparison. I read the reviews and saw that some people subbed white whole wheat for all-purpose flour, so I did that. A lot of people mentioned it being dense, so I did 1/2 baking soda and 1/2 baking powder for the baking soda amount. I wanted it more sweet than savory, so I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. I made 10 muffins instead of a square. I reduced the temp to 375 and baked them for 18 minutes. I measured out 1 tablespoon of honey and brushed the tops of the warm muffins. The slightly crunchy honey coated top was my favorite part. Although, it was not part of the recipe. Despite doing part baking powder, they were still just a little too dense for my taste.

Have made this twice now and love it. I used whole wheat bread flour and baking powder instead of soda and omitted the salt. Like the idea of using honey which I saw some others comment they did, so thinking I will try that in place of white sugar next time. Great recipe!

This was great for a healthier yogurt version! Obviously, it tastes plain compared to restaurant corn bread that is pretty much desert, but my health is my priority. I blended in frozen corn and served it with butter and honey on the table for others eaters who don't care about eating healthy :)

I made this gluten free with Better Batter instead of the unbleached flour.  Otherwise made as stated and it was excellent in my recipe "Pantry Raid" Chicken Enchilada Casserole here on all recipes!  Wonderful way to make a better for you recipe.

I replaced low carb butter spread for the butter and honey for sugar.  Overall I think it was pretty good.  I would add extra honey next time (not quite sweet enough).  My kids are used to a recipe that had 2 sticks of butter and tons of sugar.  I expected them to complain, but they acted like they didn't notice....big win for me!

I use whole-grain corn meal (very coarse) and added 2 ears of fresh corn off the cob plus 1/4 c. honey.  With the addition of either butter or honey, the bread was eaten warm from the oven, but I don't think I'll make this again.

I made this recipe with whole wheat flour and Greek yogurt (it was all I had).  I had to add a splash of water (due to thickness of Greek yogurt)- maybe 1/4 cup. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  I used it to make corn-dog mini-muffins for my kids and it worked great for that. I just put hot dogs in the middle of each mini-muffin.  I especially like that the outside crisps up well and isn't too soft. Also, the cornbread is substantial enough that it holds the hot dogs in place.  The kids (ages 2, 4, and 6) ate 3 mini-muffins each, so they must be okay. I thought the cornbread was definitely "healthy-tasting" and could use a little more sweetness.  I will try a little honey in it next time.

This was pretty good when still warm and when you're eating with a good chili. It got dry quickly after that, so eat fresh!  I added a cup of corn too. If I had jalopeno I would have chopped it up and added that too.

Delicious!  I added a cup of defrosted frozen corn, and some garlic & onion powder - very yummy.  Thanks for a healthier version of an old favorite!

I was looking for a recipe for healthy cornbread because my husband in on a cardiac diet. I used 2 cups of cornmeal, 1/4 TBLS. eggbeaters, 1 TBLS. Light margarine and non fat buttermilk. I've always added canola oil but had to leave it out. It tastes fairly good but not the same as the cornbread i've been used to making

This is the best cornbread ever.  My family loves it and we have it often.  It is moist an not crumbly and it freezes well.  I did not change a thing and it turns out well every time.

EXCELLENT, did what another reviewer suggested and used unsweetened apple sauce instead of the yoghurt as I don't like the "tang" in some cornbreads. This will be my go to recipe for cornbread, thank you poster.

Excellent!! Hubby said this was the best cornbread he's ever had. (Sure can't let him mom heat that!!)  Even my step-son loved it.  I thought it was amazing ... and I'm NOT a cornbread fan!  Highly recommended!

The best corn bread i have ever eatten. I made it with some chili, best cold night meal i had with my girlfriend. Instead if using the unbleached flour, i used 1/2 cup of corn starch, very good. The yogurt makes it so moist.

I hate when people make adjustments to original recipes and then base their review on their changes, but I must admit I tweaked this a bit. I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white and added 1/4c honey with 1tbsp canola oil. Baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, but it wasn't quite done in the middle so I'll try 25-30 next time. It was very good! I used Wallaby Plain Yogurt and there was no discernable yogurt-y taste.

This is a great recipe!  I made muffins, and they stuck to the wrapper terribly, I think because of the lack of oil.  I will definitely make this cornbread again, but probably not as muffins.

This turned out really great! I was cautious as there are no oils in this recipe. But it turned out really good and you can taste the cornmeal in this bread. Will definitely use this recipe in future!

Great use of almost-expired yogurt and leftover pumpkin. I customized by adding two tbs of olive oil, pumpkin puree (in place of an egg and a half cup of yogurt, I made a triple batch), vanilla extract and pumpkin pie spice and in one batch I added pomegranate seeds and in the other I added cranberries and walnuts! Good stuff.

Good cornbread though I've used recipes on this website that I like a whole lot better.  I added a quarter cup of brown sugar and had to supplement the yogurt with some sour cream because I only had a six ounce container of yogurt.

If you're used to doing substitutions to recipes to make things healthier, then you'll love this. I used half white sugar and half Splenda instead of all white sugar and used Activa yogurt for a bit of fiber. It turned out AWESOME. My husband even loved it!

I went even farther. I omitted the sugar and baking soda. Of course it didn't rise and was not sweet but it lowered the points for weight watchers. It was absolutely excellent with the Progresso light soup I ate with it. Thank you so much for this recipe! =>

I was looking around for a "healthy" cornbread recipe to serve with my chili for dinner and stumbled upon this...BOY AM I GALD I DID! These really exceeded my expectations. Now, granted, this isn't the greatest cornbread that ever existed, but for it being virtually fat free it was WONDERFUL! I took it a step further and substitiuted egg beaters for the eggs and also added a 4oz. can of chopped green chili's that I lightly drained. After mixing all, I let it set for 3-4 minutes because I was making muffins and I wanted a nice crown when baked. I lined my muffin tin with paper liners and used my large scoop to divide it out (I got 12 muffins). I baked them at 375 degrees for 13 minutes and they came out perfectly. The only thing I will do different next time is to spray my papers before filling because they stuck slightly on the bottom. These were VERY tasty and went well with my healthy chili. I WILL be making these again and may even expierement with some other ingredients/seasonings! Thanks for posting. :)

This was pretty good - not as sweet as I'm used to so I think next time I would up the sugar or add some honey.  Consistency was great - very moist.  I will definitley make this again!

pretty good stuff.  i used half all purpose and half whole wheat flour.  made a very rustic yummy bread.  not sure that it's all that much healthier since it has two eggs instead of the one i use in regular cornbread.  plus, is cooking with nonfat plain yogurt healthier than cooking with nonfat milk?  i dont know..

This recipe looked really good but I think I baked it too long.  Plus it didn't really have any flavor so next time I think I'll add some green chilies or some cheese. Maybe its meant not to be eaten on its own.

Good cornbread.  I prefer a sweeter cornbread so next time I'll add 1/4 cup honey per other recommendations.  I added 1/4 cup milled flax for fiber and healthy fat.  Great with jalapeno jelly.

Did I do something wrong?  Only thing I did different was I put this in a round pie pan.  This was extremely dense and tasteless.  Adding butter or honey would not do it any good.

Not the greatest low fat cornbread recipe... Mine turned out a bit dry and too brown. I think 400F was too hot and 25 minutes was too long. The taste was okay but not superb. Was a bit salty for my taste.

I 1 1/2 the recipe to go in a bar pan for quicker baking.  Baked at 350 degrees F for 28 min.  I used Light Vanilla Yogurt instead for the plain and omitted the sugar.  I also added 1/4 cup apple juice concentrate for added moisture and sweetness. I also added sweet corn (1/2 cup) FABULOUS!

I always find cornbread recipes that make dry, bland cornbread, but this recipe is really great. I used 1 cup lowfat vanilla yogurt, and added 1/2 cup frozen corn, and a little fresh thyme. It was moist and sweet and so good! Great accompaniment to turkey chili.

Saw this recipe today and made it with what I had on hand.  I changed the recipe. I used 1 c flour, 1 c cornmeal, 3 tablespoon sugar, 3 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 cup of nonfat vanilla yogurt. The yogurt I used was 6oz of nonfat vanilla Greek yogurt (13 grams of sugar in it) put that in a measuring cup and then added some nonfat vanilla regular yogurt (also this kind has 12 grams of sugar) to complete the 1 cup. (I did this because this was what I had on hand).  2 beaten eggs. 1/2 cup of milk.  It was pretty good.  Not sweet tasting.  If you want more sweetness then add more sugar.  It was very moist and good. I'm glad I found this recipe. Another favorite is on allrecipes.com is Golden Sweet Cornbread.

I didn't miss the oil here, it was tender and quite moist. Usedwholemeal flour too, which added to the flavour.

Great texture and consistency.  A little on the dry side, but this is fixed by serving it with honey or apple butter.  I used kefir instead of yogurt.

I have tried so many corn bread recipes that turned out dry, but this one is moist and very good!  I used 1 T. sugar and 1/4 cup honey.  Sour cream can be used to replace the yogart, although I  personally love to use the yogart for the flavor and nutrition.  Tastes great with chili!

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars due to the changes made to the original version.  I added 2 tspn. of baking soda.  This healthy recipe is a keeper.  I love its sweetness.

Very good.  I used vanilla flavored yogurt and thought this was a great, healthier version of cornbread.  Would make again.  It doesn't make as thick of cornbread as I had expected.

I really loved this, but then I love almost all cornbread recipes.  Like many excellent and healthy recipes, it tastes best fresh from the oven.

Pretty good. I'm not very familiar with cornbread, so it seemed pretty dry, but a friend told me that's how cornbread's supposed to be. Super easy to make though!

I didn't think healthy cornbread was possible!  This recipe is forgiving with substitutions.  I used egg beaters and only whole wheat flour (slightly less than 1 cup).  I used homemade yogurt, which tends to have a little more whey than store bought and probably added moisture.  I baked for 20 minutes @ 350F.  This was moist, and now I wish I had added chopped jalapenos for extra kick!

The only reason this didn't rate a 5-star is that it wasn't sweet enough for my taste. I come from the sweet cornbread tradition and 1/4 cup just wasn't quite enough, but that's an easy fix.  Other than than, pretty good!  Texture and flavor were good.

This was a fantastically moist, delicious cornbread with great flavor.  I added an additional 2T of honey, used Greek yogurt which is thicker and tastier than usual plain non-fat yogurt and also added 2T of non-fat milk.  I will definitely make this again, and try adding chopped chilis or roasted corn next time as well.

I thought this tasted very good for a low-fat recipe. Like others, I added a few tbsps of apple sauce to the recipe. But I definitely don't think it was too dry. I cooked it for 17 minutes and I think it could have used a couple more minutes, it was a little wet in the center. I could definitely see this bread being good with dinner.

This cornbread was one of the best I've ever had. However, I always substituted nonfat vanilla yogurt for the plain yogurt, and it was still very, very delicious!

This was a GREAT healthy recipe!  It obviously isn't just like the original, however, it is the next best thing.  I added jalepeno's for spice and used applesauce instead of yogurt.  I also did half wheat flour and half unbleached flour.  FYI: 20 min was too long I would suggest 17.  Great recipe for those health nuts!

I was pretty excited about making this and fooling my boyfriend with a "healthy" cornbread recipe, but I must say that I was pretty disappointed.  The texture was a little different than cornbread should be - the only thing I did differently was used vanilla yogurt but I can't imagine it affecting the recipe that negatively.  It just didn't have that good cornbread flavor that I was looking for.  Worth trying out (everyone's tastes are different!), but I don't think I'll be making this one again.

I have made this recipe several times now and feel that I have finally found what makes it work in our house.  My husband is on a low fat diet and that is what prompted us to try this recipe.  At first I didnt really like the taste that the yogurt gave it or adding apple sauce to moisten so I changed it to 1c of lowfat buttermilk.  Along with using real egg substitute product, the fat in this recipe comes out to 4grams (and thats the whole pan!) We love it now and with honey, it is awesome!!!! I gave it 4 stars only because I needed to make a change to the original.

I love cornbread, but I'm trying to cutback on fats.  this worked out very nicely! There wasn't enough plain yogurt and I substituted lemon yogurt (about 1/2 plain and 1/2 lemon) it was great and added just a little tang.  

Thanks for the recipe!

This was good enough, it was tough to me, not tender at all. I guess that's what you give up when you give up the fat. My kids didn't like it much, which means it probably won't be on my list to make again.

I was excited to try a healthier version of my son's favorite "dinner."  But, this was a little HEAVY for me.  It was okay...but not light and fluffy like we're used to.  Good concept, but I'll probably keep searching for a different low fat corn bread.

Had I not overcooked these, they would've been excellent; but they were good nonetheless.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar and added a little more yogurt than the recipe called for.  I only had bleached flour on hand, but it worked.  I also baked them in a muffin pan and served them with Crawfish & Crab Chowder.  It was quite a yummy meal.  I would make these again.

It was a little bit too sweet for me but that should be easy to adjust.  Thanks for sharing.

WOW, I was impressed!! My husband only likes "real" cornbread since he's from GA.  I was making Chicken and dressing and needed to make cornbread from scratch.  My husband tried to explalin it over the phone, and so much of it seem to be using shortening. So, I silenced him out, and found this recipe :) The only thing I did different was used Vanilla Yogurt bc that's what I had. Now, I don't like "real" cornbread myself and this wasn't too sweet yet, it wasn't dry and blah tasting. I will always use this recipe. Thanks so much~~
