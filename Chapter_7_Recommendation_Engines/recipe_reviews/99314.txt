Well, I have now tried this recipe two ways. The first time I planned to make it I could not find lobster, so I substituted steak (broil first till med. rare, dice, and add to sauce in the end). It was excellent.

The second time I did use lobster, and it is excellent both ways.

I would like to offer my suggestions for an even more enjoyable taste experience.

I used many more cloves of garlic called for, used extra buuter, and added fresh, chopped mushrooms.

I did not use the amount of cinnamon called for, as only a hint is what it needed. Just maybe 1/2 a teaspoon.

The most important ingredient I added, and someone is bound to thank me for this, is Sherry (Marsala can also be used). About a 1/4 cup of this truly completes the taste. It makes all the difference.

Also, only a few dashes of salt is needed. The 2 t called for I believe is way too much.

I also used a 28 oz sized can of Pureed Tomatoes, instead of diced, for a smoother sauce. 

Can top with freshly grated parmesean.

I would love to read someone else's review who tried making this with the sherry, or substituting w/ a good cut of steak. I would hate to be the only one to savor this recipe with the additions.

Wonderful with a crusty bread and a caesar salad.

I made this recipe on New Year's day to use up leftover lobster from our New Year's Eve feast.  My family loved this recipe, including my 10- and 12-year-old boys.  They actually put it on their list of top 10 favorite meals!  I was a bit skeptical, as the recipe seemed so simple, I thought it would be bland.  But it was fantastic!  I made a couple of changes:  I used shallots instead of onions, 1/2 diced tomatoes and 1/2 tomato sauce instead of all diced tomatoes, and bow-tie pasta instead of spaghetti noodles.  I really recommend the bow-tie pasta, as it carries the sauce really well.  Serve with crusty bread to sop up the sauce!

I made a few little changes since we are trying to eat more healthy.  I used half and half instead of cream, and I sauted the onions and garlic in olive oil, then added the tomatoes to that to avoid the extra fat.  I used canned lobster to bring the cost down as well.  Over all, still tasty and a little more healthy, so I didn't feel quite as bad about enjoying it.  Better fresh, the leftovers (at least my way) weren't the greatest.

Do you like your lobster/pasta to taste like cinnamon rolls, if so this is the plate for you!  I was very excited to make this because it sounded delicious, the only thing that made me iffy was the cinnamon.  Just like I thought the cinnamon was way to overpowering and made it grossly sweet.  I was very disappointing since I spent a lot of money on this nice food, added extra garlic, extra onions,and mushrooms and sadly all I could taste was the cinnamon, I could barely taste the lobster.  DO NOT ADD CINNAMON TO YOURS OR JUST ADD A DASH!  you have been warned!

I thought this was simply fantastic. The only thing I did different was chop up the lobster in big bite size chunks so it was mixed in with the pasta. I made this for a family get together so I tripled all the ingredients except for the lobster which I quadrupled and the cinnamon which I only put 1 teaspoon to all that sauce and you could still taste it. The recipe calls for way too much cinnamon, use very little. I have to say this was very different than anything I've made before but it was a huge it.

AWESOME dish!!!  Really simple and easy to follow but totally DELICIOUS!!!  I substituted the whole lobster for frozen lobster chunks and added bell peppers, mushrooms, and some corn starch to thicken it.  Definitely a dish I'll be making again.

I halved the recipe, added scallops and used angel hair pasta--my picky hubby loved it!  Next time I'm planning to add wild mushrooms and a sprinkle of good Parmesan cheese.

My family loved this recipe.  I made some substitutions: immitation lobster, fresh tomatoes, margarine, and half & half.  I also added some red & yellow peppers.  I doubled the recipe but left the cinnamon at 1T.

Before cooking the spaghetti I broke it in half to make it easier to toss.  I incorporated the meat into the sauce and tossed the pasta in it. 

My husband, who 1)never eats leftovers and 2) ranks new dishes "good" at best LOVED this.  He told me a half dozen times it's his new favorite dish.  He also ate all of the leftovers.

Good flavor... Added broccoli and roasted red peppers... forgot the tomatoes. Grated imported Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese on top made this dish.

I made this for Christmas dinner with my in-laws and it turned out excellent. We altered the recipe slightly so we could use the shellfish we had on hand - lobster tails, crab legs and shrimp. Absolutely delish!

I was looking for a recipe to use monkfish for the first time.  I tried this one because I'd read that monkfish has a texture like lobster.  I also added a few shrimp.  I put them in to poach just after I added the tomatoes.  This sauce was excellent!  I cut down on the salt and followed the advice in some of the comments and cut the cinnamon down to 1/4 teaspoon.  I'll be using this again with lots of different seafood.  Thank you for the recipe.

So delicious!! I just used the juice from the tomatoes because none of us like them. This dish is so scrumptious you'll think you ordered take-out from a fine dining establishment!

This recipe was so delicious.  I took the advice of others and only added a teaspoon of cinnamon and it was more than enough.  I also used whole wheat spaghetti and cut up the lobster and mixed it in with the sauce.  My husband loved it too, it was our valentine's dinner.

The cinnamon in this dish dominates the flavors and I only added a little more than 1/2 tsp.  My family didn't care for it. I would try this dish without the cinnamon.

This was really tasty.  I followed the recommended advice and added Marsala wine and mushrooms to this recipe.  The Marsala really added a great flavor.  I might have to try Sherry next time, but the Marsala was so good it would be a tough choice.  I also added extra garlic and very little cinnamon.  I put two shakes of the canister of cinnamon, probably less than 1/2 teaspoon.  You could just barely taste it, but I think it may have added a little something special.  I also used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream to lessen the fat content a bit.  I used 2 cans of 14.5 oz. stewed tomatoes, chopped up, plus I added just a bit of marinara sauce as well.  We caught the lobsters fresh but I had frozen them before I made this meal.  Two large tails, partially thawed only took about 4 minutes to turn bright orange in the boiling water.  They cooked the rest of the way in the skillet after I cut the tails in half lengthwise.  I cooked the tails like that but then ended up cutting them into chunks for the final product.  My husband loved it, and he's very picky.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

Not a fan of the cinnamon even reduced to 1 tsp. Would be better with paprika subs for it I think.

Great recipe to build upon!!!  I always use immitation lobster meat instead of the real stuff.  It's way cheaper, it tastes great, and it's pretty healthy!! I used a jar of ready made spagetti sauce instead of diced tomatoes.  I cut the cinnamon in half, as several other reviewers have mentioned.  I also took the onions completely out of the recipe and used about 1/4 tsp. oregano.  It turned out beautifully!  My fiance and I both LOVED it!!!  This is going in my recipe book for sure!  Thanks for sharing!

I made some small changes. I didn't add the cinnamon because some of the reviews said that it detracted from the dish and instead of heavy cream i used half and half. In the end it tasted pretty good. Although it was a little too salty, but still pretty good.

This was fantastic!  I used two lobster tails and just cut them up and added them to the sauce.  I did not use the cinnamon as to many users said don't.  It was awesome.  This is a keeper.  Thank you so much.

I made this the night after a huge lobster feast with the leftovers.  It was a huge hit, everyone in my family cleaned their plates.  I added about half the cream and it was still excellent.

Made it today with leftover lobster and shrimp from our Mother's Day meal. it was excellent! I added just a touch of cinnamon, used bow tie pasta, and blanched a some broccoli at the end of cooking the pasta. I didn't have heavy cream, so I used evaporated milk and some flour to thicken the sauce.  It was a great dish. Thanks for sharing the yummy recipe! We had ours with corn on the cob, salad and baked kale.

Way too much cinnamon, it was a total bust.  I think maybe if you only put 1/4 tsp or so & use half & half instead of heavy cream it was kind of slimy...it is definately a salvagible recipe if u do some swaps.

The cinnamon with lobster just didn't do it for me. I would not make this dish again.  It wasn't inedible, but ruined my lobster that I was so looking forward to.  May have worked for me if I'd left out the cinnamon?

This recipe was fantastic! We used lobster tails instead of whole lobsters. The leftovers were even better the next day. None was wasted! Yum!

I made this recipe last night for my sisters birthday celebration.  This dish was very good and I made it "almost" just as the recipe stated.  My only changes were using langostinos rather than whole lobsters, using a little cumin to replace the cinnamon (after reading the reviews, I didn't want to chance using the cinnamon), adding about 1/4c of white wine to the sauce while it was simmering, a dash of hot sauce, and a squirt of lime juice.  I think this dish tasted really good as-is, but seamed to be missing something.  I think if I make this again I will try to add a little more spicy to it to amp up the favor and maybe some veggies like mushrooms and asparagus.  All in all, a very good dish ... but I would leave out the cinnamon.

This is one terrific recipe with a few modifications.  I used 2 lobster tails, shelled and chopped into 3/4 inch pieces, also subbed chopped shallots for the onions, reduced the salt to 1 tsp, the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp, the cream to 1/2 cup & added 1/4 cup dry sherry & 1/2 tsp hot pepper flakes,  along with sliced mushrooms and 1/2 sliced red pepper.  After simmmering all to the right consistency I added the fresh lobster and cooked until just done.  Of course I served this on fresh pasta, topped with freshly grated parmesan & chopped Italian parsley.  We had our guests begging for the recipe.

Oh! This is an AMAZING recipe!  It's the cinnamon that really makes it--so if you're not a big fan of the hint of flavor, you simply won't like it.    This is one of the dishes I make to impress guests with experienced pallets.  A BIG hit.

Very good... you could easily use something other than lobster. Shrimp would be very good in this recipe.

I really love lobster, and this didn't compliment the lobster at all!!!! Highly disappointed.  I will tell all who want to give this a try, first,make the pasta on its own, with just the sauce, and see if you like it.  The lobster is basically just a side to this dish!!!! I won't make this pasta dish again.

Tried this for the first time and when I read it asked for 4t salt, I immediately knew that would be too much.  So I used about 2t and still found it a tad too salty (and I love salt too!). I also wasn't too sure about the cinnamon so just added a dash.  I also used half and half instead of whipping cream so that it wouldn't be as heavy.  Thickened it with a little flour.  I think that next time, I'd add even more garlic as some have recommended as I just love garlic.  It was a big hit with the family.

This dish is AMAZING!!!  In addition to the lobster I grilled up some fresh italian sausage that our local market makes and when I placed the lobster in the pan with the onions and the garlic I sliced up the sausage and threw that in there too.  

This was so good even my pickiest eater ate it all!!  Since I like my food with a little spice, I threw in some cayanne pepper over the top and it was sooooo good.

This is definately a keeper.  You do not even need to use the lobster, you could use shrimp also.  

Again, it was YUMMY!

I agree with many of the other responses....too much cinnamon, but if you cut way back...1 tsp was still almost too much, it is a very good recipe!  Can't imagine what it would be like with a whole Tbsp of cinnamon....

After we made quite a few changes, we enjoyed this dish.  I highly recommend reducing the salt to about 2 teaspoons or less.  We did not add cinnamon, or the additional 1 tbsp butter, 1 clove of garlic and parsley.  Freshly grated parmesan went really well with this...and next time we make this, we will try adding a little white wine and a sprinkle of hot pepper flakes.

It was not good, the taste of cinnamon is odd.  I ended up picking the lobster out, and putting it in another dish.

I followed this recipe exactly the way it is. For some reason, I just did not like it. It was not great to me. Maybe someone else would like it, but it's not for me or my family. No one in my household liked it. I hope others have better luck with this recipe.

I've done this twice in 3 days. I had my mom in law over for dinner and my husband loved this and asked me to repeat it today while having my dad over! And he doesnt even like pasta. I followed the recipe the first time and the second I didn't add lobster and it was just as good.

The best lobster pasta I have ever had by far. I did sub heavy cream with savignon blanc and juice from half a lemon and it was just as great. This recipe is a definite keeper.  I am not even sure I want to try it with heavy cream, although I might try  it one day. NO cinnamon as my husband doesn't like cinnamon, period. LOVE IT.

We really liked it.  Used 2 small fresh lobster tails for 2 people, but hubby wanted more lob, (who doesn't), so next time will use 3.  Added a shake of red pepper flakes, bc we love the heat .Just a pinch of cinnamon.  Which was an interesting addition, but  any more cinnamon would have taken over the dish.  Just salt to taste.  I also used  half cream and half non fat 1/2 and 1/2 bc I had both on hand and was trying to balance the yum and the fat.  Also added leftover shitake mushrooms, which was a great addition.  Will def make again.

Pretty  delicious. I didn't boil the lobster first, just pulled the raw flesh from the shells and seared them in the pan with the garlic and onions. Also, like others I only put a sprinkle of the cinnamon.

This was fantastic! I used lobster tails instead of the whole lobster and took everyone's advice and used only a pinch of the cinnamon. I think next time I'll try to add the sherry & fresh mushrooms as others suggested. I also used linguine instead of spaghetti as that was what I had. This would probably work well with shrimp or scallops too. Will be making this again! Thanks for sharing!

The cinnamon totally ruined it. The rest of the recipe is fine...  My first instinct was to not follow the cinnamon part, and I should have listened to myself. Lol

Excellent recipe. I only added some cilantro (which I mashed together with more garlic and a pinch of salt). I also added a couple of leaves of basil (cut into stripes) right at the end. Also used a lot more cream (perhaps double the amount) because I like my pasta very creamy. Amazing! Will definitely make again.

i cooked this for Valentine's day and my hubby LOVED it. I used 1/2 of the cinnamon it called for.

I made this for my husdand and two of my sons with mixed reviews. 
I added about three times the garlic and used 1tsp of cinnamon instead of 1 tbl. spoon. 
My husband did not like the cinnamon at all, and one of my sons felt that the cinnamon was too strong.... even though I cut the cinnamon by 2/3rds. 
I found it had a unique flavor that was a pleasant surprise.
I don't believe this will be a recipe I'll repeat but I'm glad I tried it. I have always been tempted to use cinnamon in an unconventional way.

This was the best!  The flavors were perfect together. I cut the salt to 3 tsp.  Everyone loved it.  Thank you so much for the delicious recipe.
