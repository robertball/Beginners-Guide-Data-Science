I love this recipe! I don't know why the recipe was edited to say the cucumber seeds should be removed. I know the creator of this recipe and she just lightly peels the cucumber and uses the whole thing. She uses more cucumber for a dressing, and less for a dip. When I make it, I use a heaping tablespoon or two of garlic powder instead of fresh garlic because I like that taste better. I love it because I actually enjoy eating raw vegees when I have this to dip them into!!!! I crave it now and have to have some in the fridge all the time.

When I first made this, it seemed like it was missing something.  But after I let it sit in the fridge a few hours and allowed the flavors to mingle, well... that was pretty much all it needed!  Good stuff!  :-)  In addition to using as a salad dressing, it works great as a spread in a wrap with smoked salmon and sprouts.

I really like this - the cucumber and garlic remind me of a Greek tzaziki sauce. To keep things simple, I just pressed the garlic and threw all of the ingredients in the blender at once. We had it with veggies and fried corn and wheat tortilla chips. Thanks for the recipe!

I am not a big dressing person when it comes to salads so I wanted something a little different and with a refreshing taste.  I love avocados, so this seemed like a perfect dressing for me.  Absolutely LOVE IT and agree is a nice dip as well.  I did add 2 additional garlic cloves because I like the added bite.   From a time preparation perspective, you really don't need to cube the avocados if they are ripe, they blend up with no issues.  Would highly recommend this recipe to others.

This is a refreshing alternative to fatty, oil laden salad dressings.  It is a very balanced dressing, and you don't have to worry about overdoing it.  My only suggestion is that if you are watching your sodium intake, try using Mrs Dash instead. And if you really want to cut calories and fat content, instead of using the 1/3 cup of olive oil, try using almond milk.

I'm about to have seconds, this dressing tastes great! Pure and healthy. To give it more kick, I added extra lemon juice and garlic instead of upping the salt content. Yummy on a spinach salad!

Wow! I had to change the recipe a bit because I didn't have any cilantro. I took this idea but substituted about 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh mint for the cilantro. I also added a bit of plain yogurt. It made a delicious dip/dressing. Thank you for the great idea! Best after being refrigerated over night.

I thought this dressing was pretty good. I didn't think it was too thick but it did need something. I might put in more garlic next time. The cucumber taste was great and the cilantro really complimented it.

This dressing is the equivalent of ambrosia of the Gods. The health benefits alone made me want to try it, but the taste kept me coming back. I've since twisted this recipe into so many unique variations, the possibilities are as limitless as your own imagination. This must have recipe.

I'm a huge fan of avocado so this dressing was perfect for me.  It's really creamy and tasty.  I added some fresh herbs that suited my palate. Excellent!  Definitely a keeper.

I just got done making this almost exactly as written (lemons can actually be hard to come by in Mexico - so I used lime juice instead) and it is wonderful!  I truly enjoyed cleaning out the blender and licking the spatula!  I'm anxious to taste it again after it has set for a day or so.   Thank you for a great post!

Let me just say that my best friend thinks that I am a domestic goddess for this recipe. ha ha ha It is a very different dressing. Nice and fresh. I personally do not like all the cucumbers in it. It seems to water down the flavor. So I cut them back when I make it to only half or even less. IT does make it quite thick though. I also add cruched red pepper which makes it quite interesting.

This is a very good dressing, I have not yet tried it on a salad, however I did use it as a sauce on a turkey and cheese wrap. The flavour was amazing. I must say two things. I let this mixture chill in the fridge for about 3 days before I used it on anything. Now I don't know if that helped or hurt the flavour. The other thing I have to say in a minor negative light is the cucumber becomes a big of an overpower flavour to the overall taste. My suggestion is to perhaps only use 3/4 of the cuke or maybe even just 1/2. That should allow the flavours of the avacado to come into light as well. This is also a very good substitute for Guac. Just add some onions and a jalapeno to the recipe and you should have a great little mix.

This is pretty good & pretty basic. I followed the recipe to the 'T' except I didn't bother to de-seed the cucumber. Also I added a bit of Tony's Creole Seasoning to give the dressing a kick. Next time I'll adding jalapeno for even more flavor!

Definitely make, cover and refridgerate for an hour or so so that the flavors really develop and meld. Also, if you use English cucumbers, you won't have to de-seed them. This makes a terrific salad dressing but I also LOVED it in a turkey/Swiss/alfalfa sprout sandwich - so good! Great recipe. Thanks!

Perfect dressing or dip for a hot summer day!  I did add some garlic powder and onion salt as well as minced garlic.  I also added some Bragg's about a table spoon.  Just perfect!

I used sour cream instead of the oil and lime juice instead of lemon, and this came out great.  It is a little thick, but it still worked as a dressing.

I love this dressing. I use lime juice as it gives it a little more somethin' somethin' - If you want it thicker add another avocado or try frozen green peas but remember that the peas will add sweetness to the dressing so add a capful of apple cider vinegar or a bit more lime juice. Did you know this can be frozen? Avocados can be frozen on their own after being halved and pitted and cucumbers freeze well once pureed.

This is just okay.  I wasn't really sure how much a large cucumber was, mine was about 12 inches long and 2 inches in diameter.  It seemed to have too much cucumber in it.  I like gaucamole better than this dip, but thanks for posting!

Love avocados.  Love cucumbers.  Did not love this dressing.  Too thick for a dressing and didn't like it as a dip.  Too bad because the ingredients are all great and probably would have been a lot better just chunked together.

It's ok.  I do agree with the others that say this is lacking something.  The flavor is a little light.  It reminds me more of a light flavored guacamole.  A day later I thought that maybe onion powder could boost the flavor (it helped a little-not much).  The only reason I would even consider making this again is to save money on the avacados-because the cucumber helps to stretch the mixture.

This came out so thick it was more for dipping then a dressing.  I did add more oil hoping to thin it out a bit, but, it still was too thick.  I think it could of used a bit more seasoning too.  Ended up dipping veggies in it,

Made a few small changes, such as scaling back the entire recipe by 1/2.  Result was AWESOME!  Dip, Sandwich Spread, Guacamole for chips.... AWESOME! 

The most amazing was when I added some milk, a little sugar and used it as a "Coleslaw" sauce for making Mexican coleslaw to go with fish tacos!  That was the BOMB!!!

Okay - so I made this recipe yesterday as written with the intention of using as a "salad" or sandwich dressing.  Today I went out early and purchased some organic tortilla white corn chips and OMG, I can't stop eating it!!!  I will definitely make again and share with my family.  Thanks for sharing this healthy recipe!

This recipe is a nice refreshing alternative!   I am not a fan of cilantro myself so I used basil from our garden, used lime juice instead of lemon and added a pinch of sugar.  Thank you for the recipe base!

I'm not a salad person unless the salad and the dressing are interesting.  This was a good dressing however for those of us not liking cilantro I'm wondering what other spice would go well?  The thickness was just right.  The taste was o.k. - could have been better with a spice.

Excellent dressing. I did add one more clove of garlic and a dash of cayenne pepper.  Great for a dip as prepared above.  For a salad dressing, I doubled the lemon juice, which gave it a bit more zing and made it thin enough for salad dressing.  Yum!

Love this as written, but easy to modify to meet husband's tastes and to make a smaller batch. Tonight  I cut the recipe in half, replaced olive oil with avocado oil, lemon juice with fresh lime juice and cilantro  with parsley (I love cilantro, but husband won't eat anything with it) - while it is a totally different taste, it is still great.

I really liked this, it was great on fish tacos.  I must admit, I changed it a bit after making it the first time.  I reduced the oil to 3 Tablespoons and added 1/2 cup of Greek yogurt, more garlic and a dash of hot sauce.

I LOVE THIS DRESSING! So easy and soooo delicious. Didn't change a thing! Used it as an alternative to Caesar dressing. Excellent!

It needed a bit more acid, so we added lime juice and a touch more salt.

this was very tasty, the first time I made it, I used dried cilantro. my first batch came out very thick and the avocado was overpowering, but it was good enough to try again. Second time I used two cucumbers, which proved to be too much..too watery. So I thickened it up with homemade veganaise and flaxseed. I also used fresh cilantro and was very heavy handed with the garlic. Boy does this dressing have some zing! LOL ..this is a good recipe and I will make again. and by the way, how healthy is this? :) full of good things for the body..excellent!

Not bad, but not what I expected.  I used dried instead of fresh cilantro, my avocado was very ripe, and I halved the recipe.  Any of those may have changed the way it should have tasted, I don't know.  I expected it to taste lighter and fresher.

The only adjustment I would make is maybe another garlic clove, the garlic was quite subtle and I like it a little stronger. Apart from that it is wonderful.

Very tasty though I suspect it will taste even better tomorrow after the flavors have had more time to meld.  You don't need to puree the garlic/olive oil separately, I just did it all at the same time in the Cuisinart.

This recipe was GREAT, I wanted a rich and creamy salad dressing that would be good for me too. This was it! I added a little cayenne powder to it for some heat. I took it to work and my co workers and friends loved it. I let them know where I got it and how easy it was to make. It was a definite hit here! Thank you!

I didn't seed the cucumber as another reviewer suggested and skipped the oil. Faboulous for me who needed no excuse at all to eat more avocado and cucumber.
