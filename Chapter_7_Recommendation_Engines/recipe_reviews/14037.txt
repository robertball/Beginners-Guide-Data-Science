My roommate is a vegetarian and was looking for something to bring to a party.  I found this and he decided to try it (because it was quick and almost as easy as buying a cheese tray or something at the store).  Of course I stole a few mushrooms before he left and thought they were great!  The only change was he halved the mushrooms instead of slicing them to make better appetizers (the easier to stick a toothpick in my dear ;-) and cooked them a minute or two longer to compensate for the larger size.  Really great tasting.

This goes really well with broiled or grilled meat. This is very easy to make.  I also added marsala and sherry which really added to the flavor.  I will make this every time I serve filet mignon.

I used half butter and half olive oil to saute some chopped onions till soft before I added the garlic. I also added some sherry and worcestershire sauce w/ the white wine and balsamic vinager.  This really gave the shrooms a nice rich flavor.  Delicious!!! I'm thawing a steak for tomorrow, I hope I can save some shrooms till then!!!

We loved it!!!! I didn't have white wine, so I used the same amout of a kind of bourbon.(Dutch "Vieux". As usual I was in a hurry so I got the method messed up. Sauted the garlic, added the vinegar and Vieux. Let it cook and then added the mushrooms. Cooked it about 2 minutes. Devine !!! Had to keep tasting if it got even beter while cooling..... Next time I'm making double!! Thanks for a winner !!

I love this recipe and used to make it all the time but my new boyfriend doesn't eat shrooms so I make it with green beans instead and add some crumbled bacon.

It's a keeper - so good and easy.  I plan to try some of the other reviewers suggestions - like trying the bourbon!!!  If you are a mushroom lover also try AllRecipes "Mushroom Saute".  Equally delicious - I go back and forth between both - my family actually likes Mushroom Saute a little better - but it's nice to have a change.

This was great as a "I'm late home from work and I've got to be out the door again in 10 minutes" dinner just on hot buttered toast.  I used red wine instead of white - because it was available -and washed it down with another glass of red.  Yummo!  Definitely do this one again.

I took into consideration some of the mixed reviews when preparing this recipe. I had a pound of fresh baby bella mushrooms, sliced. 1/3 cup of olive oil is a lot of oil so I eyeballed mine, 2 T in a skillet. Once heated I added the sliced mushrooms, then a couple of sliced garlic, stirring everything. I grinded some fresh ground black pepper on top of the mushrooms. Did not add any salt. I added 2T of white wine and 1T of baslsamic vinegar. I also added a tiny pinch of white sugar to shave off that edge of "tang" from the vinegar. I am so glad that I did not add the full 3T of Balsamic called for in this recipe. The combination of seasonings blended well- a nice rich depth of flavors.  These mushrooms were delicious and complemented my steaks, "Roasted Tomatoes with Garlic", and "Ciabatta Bread", also from this website.

This is a flavorful way to make mushrooms as a side or appetizer. Careful with the garlic, as it can brown easily.  Also, not good for those who aren't thrilled about vinegar, like my husband.

This is a good recipe. My husabnd loved it. Next time I make it, I may just reduce the amount of vinegar that goes into it or add a little more wine.  It's a keeper.

Loved these mushrooms as is and would definitely make them again.  I just cooked them long enough to make them look like the recipe picture which turned out to be longer than called for.

I was almost out of olive oil and used butter instead.  If it weren't for the saturated fat, I would always use butter in this recipe.  I also went a little easy on the balsamic because I didn't want it to be overpowering.  Very nice recipe.

This is a wonderfully simple and tasty recipe. The mushrooms were incredibly soft and moist; I truly loved them! The Balsalmic vinegar truly flavor these, so you may want to add more or less depending on your taste. I think the recipe is just right.

This is a great accompaniment for grilled steaks.  I've made a mushroom side for steak with dry sherry for a long, long time.  This combination of garlic and balsamic will replace it for grilled beef. BTW, I cooked it longer than the recipe states reducing the liquid.

These were great as a side to a spicy fish entree.  I had a lot of liquid left over in the pan and will probably reduce the amount next time.

Simple to make and the taste was a perfect balance of muchroom & balsamic vinegar.  Next time I'll have to double the recipe to keep up with the demand.

I only gave 4 stars because I didn't have white wine and used cooking sherry instead (which is yummy, btw).  The first time I made this was almost exactly to the recipe.  Tonight I added chopped green bell peppers.  Yum! I served it over lettuce. :0)

Yum!  I cut down the oil to 1/4 cup, but that was the only change I made.  So good!  Thanks for sharing!

delish! i modified the recipe somewhat, though: i used less oil, i sued "baby bella" mushrooms, and i added a couple of shallots, very thinly sliced (these carmelized and added a richer flavor). these mushrooms can be eaten hot or room temperature - but i prefered them hot.

will definitely make for my next dinner party!

These were all right. I couldn't get my bottle of white wine open (I'm pathetic, all right?) so I put in a little worcestershire instead. Not bad.

Lose a star because mushrooms don't ever need this much oil.  Cut the oil down to 1-2 Tablespoons and everything else was good.

These were o.k. I had to add some agave syrup to offset the tangyness of the vinegar. Unfortunately I didn't have any wine to add. I won't make them again.

Best mushroom recipe I have tried so far. I used red wine instead, but it was still very nice. I liked the explosion of flavor when I bit into the mushrooms...mmmm!

the only thing I changed was instead of garlic, I used some diced shallots and i halved the mushrooms instead of slicing and  cooked them a minutes longer.they were amazing, my husband had made hollandaise sauce for asperagus and i ended up dipping all my mushrooms in it.you all HAVE to try it with hollandaise,it was so good that my eyes rolled back in my head!

I'm not quite sure what to say.  I love anything in vinegar, but I do not like balsamic.  I was stuffing quails and had mushrooms left over and wondering what to do with them.  This recipe popped up.  I decided to try it as I had a little bit of white wine balsamic in the cupboard.  It was absolutely delicious, but after a couple of mouthfuls, I couldn't take the sweetness.  I'm going to make it again, so quick, easy.  What a super sauce on top of a steak or pork chop.  I ate it with lamb.  However when I try it again, I will use a good ordinary vinegar (and I have a great choice).

Love it!  The garlic really makes this recipe stand out.  I eyeballed it - but think I only used 2 tablespoons balsamic and threw in a bit of red wine that I had on hand instead of white.  Wonderful healthy side!

OMG  These are phenomenal!!  I did substitute bourbon and added butter to oil.  I also added a whole onion slivered.  We ate them in tacos.  I made more than enough for leftovers, but to my amazement my husband ate every last bite.  This very traditional meat lover absolutely loved them.  Thanks!!

Excellent.  Followed recipe as described, cooking the mushrooms a lot longer than recommended.  Just a little too saucy for my liking but it was great!  didn't add salt and pepper, it was flavorful as is.

Good, except you need to combine them with something. I put them with a Chabati bread recipe I found on this site, and a little goat cheese.    Easy, quick, but definitely too little flavour for a main dish. Healthy and tasty for putting on top of something though.

I LOVE this recipe as is, but for my picky hubby (who dislikes a strong balsamic flavor) I reduce the olive oil to 1/4 cup or less,reduce Balsamic to 1 TBS, and add 1 TBS of butter with the wine.

After adding the wine and balsamic, I let the mushrooms sautee long enough so that the vinegar thickened into a syrupy reduction.  I would make this recipe again.

These were ok.  They were decent hot, and better cold.  The tang of the balsamic vinegar was especially noticeable, so if you like balsamic vinegar, give this a try.

Awesome! Really fast too. I love balsamic but never thought to saute mushrooms in it. Who knew? I went lighter on the wine oil and heavier on the balsamic and even added spinach like another reviewer did. I had made a big dinner but ended up eating only this! This one goes in my permanent file - thanks Christine!

These "Balsamic Mushrooms" have an extraordinarily beautiful presentation: caramel color with deep brown ridges. If I were to make this recipe again I would want to add a lot of caramelized onions to give it a more complex flavor and to sop up the juices. My mushrooms were very wet (served in a small bowl with sauce) despite removing the mushrooms from the heat to boil off the excess water before adding the balsamic vinegar and wine. I can easily imagine that these mushrooms would taste better the next day. Thank you CHRISTYJ for sharing your recipe.

Absolutely love this mushroom recipe.   I would recommend using a brown mushroom for this recipe.  Rather than a white mushroom.  They tend to have a rich flavor for this particular recipe.

These were really good. I served these by themselves, but I think they would go great over steak or pork chops. The only change I made was to cut the olive oil in half. Make sure to use good quality balsamic vinegar and good wine.

This recipe was pretty good.  I didn't have white wine so I used the same amount of red.  I will admit that it didn't smell that good when cooking, but the taste turned out to be much better than the smell.

I did like this recipe, but you must use a very good balsamic vinegar...otherwise it will be too vinegary. I found the longer the mushrooms marinated the better. I'm not sure that I cared too much for them warm.

We love mushrooms in our house and this recipe was pretty good.  I made it according to the instructions except I caramelized some onions before hand. The oil and balsamic overpowered the flavor of the mushrooms.  Next time I will reduce the amonuts of balsamic vinegar and oil.

Mushrooms were on sale so I had a lot to use up. This is delicious by itself but I had some raw zoodles in the frig because zucchini was on sale too so I dumped them in with the mushrooms.  Made a nice healthy veggie combo for lunch, salad side or whatever.

I followed the recipe as written, however, I needed to adjust proportionately since I had 1.25 pounds of sliced mushrooms.  I used a Chardonnay wine and 18-year aged balsamic vinegar.   This recipe is very easy to make and it tastes great.  I selected this particular recipe because it says it is good warm or cold.  I plan to use it cold on an antipasto in two days.  I am assuming it will only improve in flavor due to the extra marinating & chilling time!

Good, but will try it with onions next time. Also, decreased the amount of olive oil to make it lower fat.

Loved it. I used red wine because it was all I had. I added the garlic later, after the mushrooms had cooked a bit because I like a stronger garlic taste. Also used baby portabella mushrooms. Will make again soon!

Nice, easy dish to make.  I did half the amount of balsamic (as another reviewer suggested), after trying it first with less and it was perfect.  (I love balsamic but it can over-power a dish with too much imho).  The second time I made this I added sliced onions with the garlic and it worked well.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family did not like this.  The balsamic vinegar was overpowering.  I will not make this again. I made the recipe exactly as called for.

I used a little less olive oil than called for, but followed the other steps as written.  Very very good.  Perfect with our steaks tonight.

Very good recipe. I serve it along with dinner not as an appetizer.

OK, I turned this in to a yum for an appetizer.  It would be good by itself on top of balsamic chicken or steak, but too blah as a stand alone for me.  So, added some minced shallots, a little white pepper, a little cayene pepper, 1 chopped portobello and some more balsamic and reduced the mixture down a bit.  I removed stems from cleaned mushroom caps and cooked the mushrooms in the mixture making sure not to break them for about 5 minutes.  I took the mushrooms out, put them on a baking sheet.  I poured the mixture in 1 cup of creme cheese at room temp and some feta.  I stuffed the mushrooms and cooked for 20 minutes at 400.  They were fab, especially for non-meat eating party goers.  The portobello tastes like bits of meat.  It was fab.

I loved this recipe, however I had red wine on hand so I used that instead of the white wine. I put them ove a grilled chicken breast and loved it.

I've made this a couple of times and loved it. The only change I made is red wine instead of white.

Great as written, but I REALLY liked it with homemade roasted garlic. As always, I made it with white balsamic vinegar. I liked a previous reviewer's suggestion of serving it over steak. I might try that this week. Thanks!

Great way to serve mushrooms.  I happen to love balsamic vinegar.  My husband is the pickiest diner, but ate all of them.  This is a keeper.

I totally enjoyed this recipe.  It is exceptionly easy and provides a wonderful flavor.  I used medium to large white mushrooms and followed the recipe exactly except I only used 1/3 the recipe which for me was about one serving.  The balsamic vinegar adds a great flavor to the overall taste.  I put the mushrooms directly on a plate with a large T-bone steak.  I will use a separate bowl for the mushrooms next time as some of the vinear travelled over and onto the steak.  Naughty, naughty.  GREAT recipe - thanks.

Perfect as an entrée or side dish, and very easy to make! Go easy on the balsamic, however, or drain a little before serving, as the juices from the mushrooms themselves made them a bit watery.

I LOVE mushrooms and Balsamic Vinegar is one of my favorite ingredients.  I like that the mushrooms didn't have to cook for too long and weren't mushy.  I did add shallots like another review mentioned but this would have still been great without them.  THANK YOU!!!

I added a half an onion, and some garlic to the mushrooms, omitted the white wine and let it all carmelize. It was to die for!!!

These were actually pretty good.  The only thing I changed was to only use 1 1/2 Tbsp. balsamic to cut the tang that some reviewers complained about.  Other than that, perfect.
