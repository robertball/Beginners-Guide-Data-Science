This was so good.  I didn't realize how long it took.  So to shorten the time I browned the beef in a skillet, then I cooked the carrots, celery, and onion with the salt and pepper in another skillet.  Then I added the beef and the spinich and wine (Then I put the lid on the skillet for a few minutes)Also instead of using a fresh tomato I used 1c of crushed tomato. This seriously cut down on the time.  Then I followed everything until it came to the sauce.  I used the rest of the crushed tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes and I roased some garlic.  I didn't have anymore onion so I left that out of the sauce.  This dish turned out super great!  I would make again, but will be more prepared with how much time it takes to make.

delicious! takes time to prepare, but prepare a double batch and freeze half. use the no-cook cannelloni, it's much easier to stuff.

This is what I call REAL cannelloni! Often when you order cannelloni at reataurants they bring you some pasta with some spinach leaves in it. But this is cannelloni the way italian mothers make it. It takes a while to make it, but it's really worth the hassle. Besides you can make a double portion and freeze the rolls for later. I've made this dish for friends and neighbours and they always moan with pleasure. That's always nice for the chef, right?

Very Good – just like my Papa Capozzi used to make! Yes, it’s time consuming, but these freeze beautifully – double the recipe and freeze them for later.  I do recommend getting a good quality beef for this. This dish is so luxurious that it the quality of meat really makes a difference so it’s not the time to bargain hunt. (My favorite pastime!) Spend the extra few dollars – it’s worth it.

This cannelloni was the best I have ever tasted. It made me feel like a real chef! Although it took a while to make, it was definitely worth it in the end.

Tasted very, very good, but not good enough to merit the time and effort that the recipes calls for.  If you're going to make these, definitely double the recipe and freeze half.

Fantastic!  A family favorite! It is time consuming, but well worth the effort. As mentioned in previous reviews, I doubled the recipe and froze the extras. I also made the filling and sauce on day one (allowing the flavors expand even further) and then filled pasta and baked (baked 2x longer)on the following day.

This was a lot of work.  It was good, but wasn't anything spectacular.  Probably won't make it exactly like this again, but may change it up a little to make it simpler and quicker.  The meat in the Cannelloni was really good.  But the sauce on top was missing something.

This was very delicious. It did take a VERY long time in the kitchen to make. But if you have 2.5 to 3 hrs on a Sunday... Go for it. It was very easy though. Just time consuming. I would maybe make it with Spicy Italian Sausage and a side of Alfredo sauce to pour over. Overall a great recipe, made me feel very 'chefy'.

Made this as a vegetarian dish - fabulous.  Yes, it takes time, so save it for that rainy/cold day when you have the time to prepare it.  Substituted meatless crumbles and used a roux in place of the heavy cream.

Yummy!!! I have made this many times.  It is some of the best cannelloni I have had!  Frozen spinach also works here.  Sometimes I need a bit more sauce so it doesn't hurt to make extra

I did it the quick way too, cooking the vegetables in a frying pan rather than the oven. I omitted the white wine too as I forgot to get any!!! This recipe is gorgeous - and the whole family loves it so I'm happy lol!

My Italian husband just loved this recipe.  Be careful not to use too much onion in sauce.  Any left over filling my husband uses with tortilla chips.  So wonderful.

AMAZINGLY GOOD. however I do have a few tips. First, cook this when you have loads of time and not as a fast meal. second, don't waste your time cooking the meat and veggies in the oven, it's pointless. What I did was to cook the meat in a skillet and the veggies too, then combined them in a pot and added the wine ect.. It's much faster and tastes just as good. Third, I didn't add the cheese to the stuffing but rather put it over the cannelloni AT THE END before putting it in the oven. Fourth I used tomato paste instead of stewed tomatoes since I didn't have any, and put it for 30 minutes in the oven. ENJOY :)

This was so good!! Took 2 1/2 hours to make but it was so worth it, I actually doubled the recipe so we could have leftovers. I tried it out on my hubby and two kids and they gave it 2 thumbs up.  It does take long to make so make sure you have a few hours to spare, I want to make it for company. Great Sunday afternoon dinner. Thanks

My son who is a very picky eater had thirds! My whole family loved it.  It is well worth the time it takes to make this dish. Will make again, great for company.
