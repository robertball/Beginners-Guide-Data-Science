Super-easy to make, and the basic ingredients are fanastic to start with! I'd recommend adding some more veggies and/or seasoning if you want a bit more of a flavor. Overall, it was great.

I used frozen peas and added garlic, fresh ground pepper and a little fresh grated parmesan and this was a keeper.

As is, this is a 3 star recipe. A bit bland and not much to it. I added a couple large handfuls of parmesan, a couple dashes of pepper, and an extra splash of olive oil and that made it more of a 4 star recipe. Would be good with chopped chicken. I used frozen peas with some of the water used to boil. Hate that can liquid stuff. Also, I don't recommend using all the pasta because it dilutes the flavor a bit. Add the pasta slowly as you are tossing and taste it. I used about 3/4 of the amount in the recipe.

I also used frozen peas and pasta water as the liquid and I thought this was pretty darn good considering how easy it was to make! I also added some black pepper and grated some cheddar cheese over it... I will definitely make this again! Great as a side dish with chicken too...

This is so easy and so delicious!  My kids love it and I can never get them to eat peas.  The only change I made was to add 1 14oz. can of Italian style tomato sauce.  I also put the noodles on our plates and then pour sauce over it.  I don't always like to mix the sauce with the pasta because the pasta soaks up the sauce if it sits too long.

Pretty darn good!  I had to make a few substitutions based on what was on hand. White onion for the green and I added a ton of fresh garlic. Bag of Frozen peas and a cup of veggie broth for the canned peas. The fresh basil is a great flavor.

Very good and very simple. Only difference was that I used a white onion instead of the green, used frozen instead of canned peas, and added some minced garlic. Wonderful with the fresh basil. Thanks for sharing!

Good simple dish.  I used a 16 oz. package of frozen peas and added 3/4 cup of bouillon in place of the canned peas.  We just served the peas over the pasta rather than mixing it all together.  Lots of flavor to this easy dish.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I'm sorry but this was just incredibly bland.  This was even after adding roasted garlic to give it some flavor.

Taking into consideration the reviewers who thought this was on the bland side, I made a few changes:  added 2 cloves minced garlic, used frozen peas, added parmesan and some truffle infused sea salt and to be honest, it was still a bit on the bland side.  However, I think a little butter, more parmesan and maybe some cooked pancetta would turn this into a delicious and elegant dish.  I did enjoy it with my changes - I thought it was a nice, simple dish as well as fast and easy to prepare.

This a nice starting point for a quick and delicious pasta dish.  I've been making something similar for years with fresh garden peas but you could use frozen as well. Start out by heating some olive oil in a pan (cover bottom of pan) and add some fresh garlic cloves - saute lightly. Then add 1/2 - 1 cup of heavy cream (depending upon the amount of peas you are using), let that heat at low temp for about 10 minutes.  In the meantime, cut up your fresh herbs of choice, we love Basil & Parsley.  Grate some fresh Locatelli or other romano cheese and put aside with herbs. Cook pasta of your choice, drain and put aside (I try to have the pasta finish just as the sauce is ready). When sauce is ready, take it off the heat, I remove the garlic cloves (my kids don't like them in there but you can leave in or mash if you want), add fresh cooked pasta, herbs and fresh grated romano cheese, mix well and serve immediately. Serve with fresh pepper so guests can add to taste. So yummy and even my picky kids will eat this.

I love this recipe! So simple and flavorful - I like to use pipette pasta so the peas get stuck inside the pasta - yummy!!!

This had a nice flavor.   I was worried that it would be kind of bland, so I added mushrooms and a bit of keylime juice.  I also added half a cube of chicken boullion to give it more flavor (I don't use canned pease so for the liquid part i used the chicken bullion in water)
My husband loved it and after a hard day at work he said that's exactly what he wanted, something light and refreshing.

Since the recipe looked bland to me, I added garlic and shallots. It was still rather bland so I added fresh parmesan and ground pepper. I still felt like it needs a zip of some kind. I might try again with a few more additions.

Wow!  So simple and so yummy!  This is a great pantry meal, made with things I always have on hand.  I used dried basil and added a little fresh garlic and then topped with a little parm.  Yay!  A great meal in 15 minutes and soooo frugal.

This was delicious! I substituted dried basil for the fresh because of the cost and I still enjoyed it.

With a few changes, this was fantastic and I'll definitely make again.  Instead of oil, I chopped up three slices of bacon and cooked them in the skillet.  Removed the cooked bacon and added garlic and green onion to the bacon fat and cooked. Then added the peas until heated.  Added the cooked chopped bacon back in and tossed with bow ties.  The entire family loved this meal.

This was pretty good-it was easy, fast and fresh tasting.  I used frozen peas as I don't like canned.  For liquid, I used a couple of small ladel fulls of the pasta cooking water.  After mixing it all together, I added black pepper and a couple of handfuls of parmesan cheese.  It was pretty good-the basil and green onions gave it a fresh taste and my husband loves any pasta with peas in it.  He added some previously cooked chicken to his and liked the addition.  I think for a heavier dish, it would be good mixed with a white sauce.  Overall I think it was pretty good, though as written, a bit bland.  Plus the idea of the canned peas and their liquid making the sauce turned me off-frozen peas were great though!  Thanks for the idea!!

I agree with other ratings: As it is, this is a 3-star recipe -- easy to make but a bit bland. To make this a 4-star recipe and family favorite, use frozen peas steamer package cooked in microwave (subtract 1 minute from max cooking time). Add 1 cup of chicken broth to cooked peas (in leui of canned liquid). Toss 1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese with cooked pasta, and cooked veggies and herb mixture.

Easy to make, healthy, and pretty to look at.  Used low carb pasta and really enjoyed the fresh flavors of the veggies.  Would make again.

As is this is kind of bland. BUT with the mods I did I give it more like a ten. I cook my pasta (gluten-free rotini) in veggie broth first. I reserve a little of the liquid to use with the peas. I saute the onion & basil with a little garlic and some sweet italian chicken sausage cut into bite-sized pieces. Then I add a bag of frozen peas and the reserved liquid heated until cooked through. Topped with a little feta cheese it makes a very satisfying meal.

Nice and light supper we used our fresh peas from the garden.  Quite lovely
