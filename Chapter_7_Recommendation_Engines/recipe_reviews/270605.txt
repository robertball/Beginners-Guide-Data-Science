It’s good but if you want to jazz it up, use brown sugar, freshly grated nutmeg, cinnamon, few drops of Cointreau, few drops of aromatic bitters. You won’t regret it.

I was looking for an easy rice pudding and this was perfect. I didn't change a thing and the whole family loved it. Thanks for sharing.

3.5 stars, really. The method is perfect for a creamy rice pudding. The flavor of the jasmine rice adds a lovely dimension to it. For me, it is simply too sweet; and I used unsweetened almond milk. If you don’t care for sweet things, consider reducing the sugar by half.
