This recipe was kind of bland until I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and 1/4 teaspoon of thyme.  Then, it was phenomenal!  There was none left!  This is a great recipe for parties.  All you have to do is divide crescent rolls by 4.  Everything is fabulous with a crescent roll!  Cook time was only 12 minutes!

My husband is raving about this.  I did add garlic powder and Italian spices.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I also used Pepperidge farms Puff Pastry sheets.

Delicious recipe. I did however tweak it a bit. My husband and I are not ones to leave meat unseasoned while it's cooking. So I added a little bit of seasoned salt, celery salt, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, cumin and about 2 teaspoons of minced garlic to the meat before adding in the veggies. Left out the regular salt and black pepper.  I also did not have crescent rolls but I did have pillsbury biscuits which worked out just as well. Served with some roasted (Microwaved) potatoes that I basted in the left over egg, and sauteed asparagus. Will definitely make again.

Made it exactly per the recipe.  Simple. Best to use high quality ground beef. I happened to have the scraps from a tenderloin ground up.

I love this recipe but I had to add my usual twist or onions, bell peppers, minced garlic, worcheshire sauce, and seasoning salt. Didn't cook it as long so the broccoli wasn't as soft which in hindsight I should have but my family loved it regardless. Combined with garlic mashed potatoes and it's a real treat.

I followed the recommendations of  others and added a little  seasoning to the beef when cooking.  Turned out great, my husband can be a picky eater, and he loved these, added to our dinner rotation.  Leftovers easily reheat in the toaster oven.

Delicious!  I spiced up the filling a bit by adding worcestershire, thyme, a small dash of fennel, and a dab of sour cream.  I also used ground venison and fresh broccoli.  This one is a keeper for us!

Great recipe....just made it with a couple of tweaks and only thing I would recommend is to make sure your stuffing isn't overly juicy because if it is it will bleed through the crescent roll dough before you get it into the oven.

Good recipe.  Although 18 minutes was too long to cook in my oven.  I took them out after 13.

This was very good! I didn’t have two containers of crescent rolls so I spread one container of biscuits in the bottom of a pie plate, covered that with the meat mixture and topped with crescent roll sheet torn in random strips. I also added some Lowry’s seasoning salt and Worcester sauce to the meat. Yummy!

Used cheddar blend instead of mozzarella and added garlic and spices and this was really good. I had to add a little water to get a creamy consistency. My husband suggested it would be better with cream cheese instead of sour cream but what wouldn’t? This one’s easily modified to suit your family’s tastes.

It was delicious! My husband liked it so much, he had thirds! I made it as directed, except I only had one can of crescent rolls. I simply placed the sheet of crescent rolls over the top and baked it.  This is a keeper for sure.

The hubby & I both liked it. I added the garlic. LO wouldn't eat it "because the broccoli is mixed in". Flavor is awesome! Hubby said only once in a while because of the amount of bread....wonder if I turned it into a casserole with 1/2 the amount of crescent rolls (I did end up using 2 rolls to utilize the amount of meat & there was still mixing left over)

I tweaked it after reading reviews. Added garlic powder, basil, onion flake, seasoning salt and a splash of Worcester sauce while cooking the meat. I also doubled the cheese since my hubby loves cheese and used “riced broccoli “.  Pretty darn good

This was delicious! My family has asked for it again. I added minced garlic, Italian Seasoning, and smoked paprika. It was really tasty. Next time I think I’ll add some green and red peppers.

I followed the recipe, didn’t change a thing. Although I liked it, I thought it was bland. I wouldn’t mind attempting to make it again, I would need a recommendation to season  it up a bit. I personally had to add hot sauce to it while eating it, that made it more tasty!

I used a pound of venison, sautéed the onions with the meat and added some original Mrs. Dash seasoning, garlic salt, onion powder, Worcestershire sauce, and coarse black pepper.  Very good! I served it with butternut squash. My son says it’s a keeper!

A couple of edits i made: Double the cheese, other wise the meat mix is a bit bland. Crescent roll sheets are much easier to use. Dividing into 6 rather than 4 makes smaller servings (it is sooooo filling) and also makes a better ratio of filling to roll.

really not sure how you can simmer this for 10m in just sour cream?.. I will not normally review a recipe that I didn't make exactly as written, I'm making an exception... I made this as written but only heated the filling within reason.. it was not well received.. it wasn't bad.. but nothing anyone wanted seconds of.. or even wanted me to try to tweak it to our taste.

I wish I'd read the reviews before I served this. I made it as written, and had to serve it with my homemade catsup, because as written, it's unbelievably bland, and I don't skimp on the salt and pepper. I think if I make it again, I'll use a sharper cheese, like cheddar or maybe even blue cheese. The filling definitely needs some tweaking, but as a base idea, it's okay. As written, it's kind of like a baked, wrapped burger. Not terrible, but not fantastic.

As is, the recipe was a little bland.  We will definitely make it again and maybe add some herbs or garlic.  Very easy to make!!

This recipe is very bland. It's also unnecessarily time consuming. It just wasn't practical, and really lacked in flavor. Too much work for too little enjoyment.

it was good, but I think the kids would have liked a bit more sauce. Lots of potential though to 'tweek'.
