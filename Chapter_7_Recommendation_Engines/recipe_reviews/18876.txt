This looked interesting.  I made a lot less though, only 2 cups of uncooked rice, half a kielbasa and I just eyed the amount of ground beef I wanted to use.  I still used about 1/4 cup onion, about a teaspoon of garlic and LOTS of cajun seasoning, which had cayenne pepper and other spices in it. Salt & pepper to taste.  I used 1 can each of black beans and kidney beans.  It still made PLENTY.  I did add about 1/4 water and a little 'juice' from the black beans since other reviewers said it was dry.  I'm glad I did.  It was tasty and I think it will taste even better as leftovers.  This was easy to modify to my taste, don't be afraid to experiment.

Not too shabby, even with making changes.
Okay, 6 cups of *uncooked* rice just seems over the top a bit.  Not to mention you'd need one heck of a big pot.  Scaled that back to 2, but reasonably would have been good with 2.5 or 3.  Used one can each of kidney and pinto beans, skipped the Pk&B, added corn and cheese.  Top it with a little sour cream and you've got a hearty meal.  A dash of cumin helps too.

This receipe was tasty but too dry even after adding water to it.  You can't add too much water as you will weaken the flavor.  Had some left over for another meal so I added a can of beef gravy & 1/2 can of water and this is just what the doctor ordered.

I made this the other night as we needed a good budget dinner for the fam.  We all enjoyed it, but I did add some seasoning.  I used a cajun seasoning mix, and added about 1/2TB. or maybe a little more.  This might not be to everyone's taste, but I would definatly recommend some sort of added seasoning.  Also, please cut WAY down on the rice, as that amount of raw will give you 3/4 GALLON of cooked rice!!

i realized at the last minute we didn't have some of the ingredients, instead of the beans we had black beans, chickpeas, and baked beans.  Instead of the cayenne, I used a little chili powder, some garlic salt, and cumin.  It came out GREAT (we served with corn bread for some down home food.)

The rice amount seems WAY off to me. But besides that I really did not like this. All I could taste was beans and it was really bland. This makes a HUGE amount of food that I feel was completely wasted. So disappointed.

The taste of this was really good; however, I gave it 4 stars because it did get very dry.  I think next time I will add a can of chicken broth.  I also served it over the rice instead of mixing it all together.  I will definately make this again.  My whole family enjoyed it.  Thanks for a yummy recipe.

I used vegetable broth to cook 1/2 the rice called for in and used ground turkey instead of beef. Used 1 can of black and one can of kidney beans and added corn. With a little cheese over the top, it was very good.

This recipe didn't turn out the way I expected it to. It was rather dry once it was done, and the taste wasn't what I expected.

I REALLY changed it up.  Added ground sausage, ground beef, ground veal AND browned and prior slow cooked and tender beef tenderloin tips....Added 2 cans Goya tomato sauce.  Worchestershire sauce. Garlic. Saute'd onions, celery, peppers and garlic, and simmered for about an hour til the flavours blended and sauce was nice consistency...made rice.  Placed in dutch oven.  Poured thi meat.bean mixture on top.  Added a tiny amount mozzarella cheese on top and placed in warm oven.    Tons of food.  Good left overs.  But definitely needed tweaking to punch it up.  Enjoy!

I've made this many times before but alot simpler. For instance, to cut down on preparation and cooking time, I simply brown some ground beef, cooked sausage and add it with some Zatarains Red beans and Rice Mix. It's never to dry or soupy because I only add a 1/2 pd of meat per box of rice mix. I'd make it with a side of hot buttered cornbread and it's a hit. Great leftovers too.

This receipe had too much rice.  It didnt have enough flavor.  We added some hot sauce and it was much better.  The next time, I will cut back on the rice to bring out the flavor of the beans and meats.

I cut this in half and it still made way too much food. But the taste was good and I'll make it again - after I cut down the amounts some more.

The directions did not make sense. The end result was not too tasty. It "sounded good" which is why I tried to make it. It was a waste of food.

I will not do this recipe again. I was very dissapointed. I added chipolte tomatoes since reviews said it was dry. I also added 2 cans of water and chicken bullions to it. I also added 3 tbsp garlic minced. it is very filling but also very lacking in flavor. Now I have to figure out what to do with the left overs.

This was good, but definitely lacked something for me. The proportion seemed off on some of the ingredients. I added a cup of chicken broth because it turned out rather dry. Nice base recipe for someone to start with and embellish to their family's liking. I will make this again and try changing things up a bit.

This recipe was very good. I made a lot less and instead of using kidney beans, and pinto beans, I used a can of mixed beans.  I took the hint from other reviewers and added water and some more seasoning.  This is a very healthy recipe and much enjoyed, especially leftovers!

Tasty, but definitely needs a few mods. First, like other reviewers says, it needs less rice. I did half the rice as well as half the ground beef. I also added some Tabasco sauce for more of a Cajun kick, and garlic powder (because I add that to anything). In the future I suggest adding a can of tomato sauce as well.

I'd like to know what size skillet and stove you're supposed to use to fit all of this into. I have a 14" wok that I could fit a little over half of this meal into. It turned out dry and bland, but it's not completely unsalvageable. I cooked up a half pound of bacon (should have done a pound) and dripped some of the grease in for flavor, then used a bunch of cajun seasoning, as someone else mentioned. It turned out "OK". I love rice, but I would cut the amount in half if I made it again. The good news is that it was very cheap to make, even after the bacon, and I now have enough food to to feed the entire neighborhood for the next several days.

This wasn't too bad. I used 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb of ground sausage and made 3 cups of uncooked rice. I only added 1 can of black beans, some onions and 1 can of cream of onion soup with 1/2 can of milk. It was still a bit bland and hubby thought it was dry (it wasn't). So then I added some cumin and salt and it was delicious.
