Delicious but decadent. Bring the statin pills and CoQ10.

5 stars all the way and my blue cheese loving husband declared he could eat this every day of the week! This oven, ingredients, the measurements, and the cook time are spot on every step of the way. Make this and make it NOW! Just saying. It really doesn't get any better OR easier than this!  You won't be disappointed. I promise!

This was awesome.  My husband raved about it.  Don't plan on being romantic after eating this steak because we both had garlic breath for two days, lol.

So simple, yet AMAZING results. I used sirloin strip for this recipe (cooked with a slightly shorter time span). The key to this is the Blue Cheese Butter ...I could slather it over just about anything and be pretty happy.  This induction oven is the perfect way to cook steak at the temperature you want with lovely grill marks. Great recipe!
