Try oat flour instead of rolled oats or process rolled oats in the blender.  You can also make this wheat free by substituting  a blend of Brown Rice flour and Soy flour.  If you eat eggs, adding one is sufficient.  I have yet to serve these and hear anything but positive comments.

I made these for a group of kids (post-sleepover breakfast!) so I wanted them to be sweeter. I added 1/4 C brown sugar, 2 T of honey, and 2 T cocoa powder, so they were chocolate-chocolate chip pancakes! I also used whole wheat flour. I poured the batter on then sprinkled the chips over the pancake, and they were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, best pancakes I've ever had. Not traditional at all, but very good. The brown sugar seemed to crystalize around the oats, making them have a nice little crunch inside of the gooey, chocolatey pancake. Kind of like a melted Nestle crunch bar.

These pancakes are lovely!  I was skeptical to try this after reading reviews but needed an egg and wheat-free pancake.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I had to change quite a bit because of what I had on hand and the fact that I was cooking for a wheat, egg, and soy allergy.  I used the whole oats as specified in the recipe.  I didn't have any flax so I ground more oats and used that in place of the flax.  I also couldn't use wheat flour so I used brown rice flour in place of the pastry flour.  I then used a scant cup of 2% milk mixed with a scant 1/2 cup of fresh whipping cream in place of the soy milk.  I made them small because of some of the comments about not cooking well - I had no problem - they cooked up beautiful!  I served them with my homemade banana topping and fresh whipped cream - yummmm!  Next time I will try half the amount of salt because I thought they were quite salty.

A GREAT recipe for an indulgent, yet nutritious breakfast.  I used regular flour and cow milk and they turned out perfect.  ***Make sure you let the batter sit for 5 minutes or so to let the oats and flax soak up the liquid.  Mommy and toddlers all loved them!

I made these because I had run out of eggs, but still wanted pancakes.  The batter seemed really runny (it's 1/2 milk) but don't let that fool you, it turns out great.  There are absolutely  delicious and so easy to make!

As written, these are WAY too runny.  I wonder if it should read 1/2 cup of milk instead of 1 1/2?  I was able to salvage them by adding 1/3 cup more flour, 1/4 cup more oats, some ground walnuts, and a few extra mini chocolate chips to the tops while cooking.  After the modifications, my family all enjoyed them!

Great recipe!  I made a few minor alterations:  I used real milk and chocolate chips.  I also added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  Wonderful!

Alternative ingred. - rolled buckwheat, ground almond flour and 1C almond milk instead of 1 1/2C, + 3 t. stevia powder - still make a great pancake! This recipe gave me a solution to my food sensitivities, the flax really does the trick in keeping it together (I let it sit to become thicker before pouring) and less liquid and low heat means the cook all the way through. I served with jam sweetened with grape juice. Lovely!!

I got different results.  It seemed when the both sides of the pancake were cooked, nice brown finishes, when I cut into the pancake with a fork, the inside was still gooey.  I tried cooking the next batch longer, but that just melted the chocolate chips making a real mess on the griddle.  I do not know what I did wrong, but I do not have the patience to try this one again.

I halved this recipe but that was a mistake-"3" servings wasn't enough for 2 people (2 pancakes each) :P Other than that, I used a bit of wheat flour mixed with white flour, then I used part of a chopped up bar of dark chocolate instead of chocolate chips (much tastier), and regular milk. I let the batter sit while heating the pan on low and I found the batter was almost too thick! Luckily, cooking on low helps pancakes cook a bit more evenly. We liked the taste and I liked that they were a bit healthier than regular pancakes-no eggs and no added sugar (other than the chocolate). The texture is a bit different, of course, but we enjoyed that they were a bit more substantial than the fluffier pancakes.

I chose these because my youngest can't eat egg whites and has to watch everyone else eat pancakes.  I used regular flour and cow's milk. I added an extra 1/4 c of oats because it was so runny. I didn't put chips in, but added 1/8c of white sugar.  The batter was quite runny even after sitting for about 10 mins, but the pancakes turned out fine.  A nice chewy texture from the oats.   Next time I'll add a dash of vanilla.

I thought this recipe for pancakes was great, but I didn't like how runny they were. So, I put less milk. After I made them, they were perfect. So, when you're making these pancakes, be sure to use less milk. Overall: GREAT

These pancakes are a real treat! I made them with unsweetened coconut milk. Make sure to let the dough sit for about 10 minutes before cooking and use a good nonstick pan. I cooked them on medium for a longer time to make sure that the middle is cooked all the way. These pancakes have chewy texture and are yummy with or without the syrup. Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly, adding a few of the modifications that several people had liked.  The pancakes didn't seem to have enough oil in them or something, because they stuck to the griddle consistently.

These pancakes were great.  I was just looking for good flax recipes and found this.  One of my kids liked it, one didn't (probably because it was different than what he is used to).  I am a pancake fanatic (especially with chocolate chips) and really enjoyed them. I was also concerned with the consistency of the batter, but it turned out alright!  Also, I used cake flour instead of the pastry and it turned out fine! Thanks so much!

Was looking for an Egg Free Pancake recipe since I'm out and was so glad I found these.  I used 1/2 the salt, Chocolate Chips, 1/2 Milk & 1/2 water since I ran out, and added about a tablespoon of brown sugar to the batter. (Yes, I really need to get to the store)  They were sweet enough to avoid any need for syrup and the kids loved them and I didn't feel bad about serving them.

Very tasty! I like the vegan alternative. It is important all people know the goodness that is a chocolate chip pancake breakfast! I myself prefer real milk in the recipe but to each his or her own.

I have made these several times and my family really likes them.  I have modified this recipe a little.  I make my pancake batter in my Vitamix blender.  First put in the milk (I have used soy and skim and both work great).  Then the dry ingredients, reserving the chips.  (I used whole flax seeds and let the blender grind them.)  the batter may be a little thick, you can add milk as desired to thin it to your desired consistency.  (I have added an extra 1/2 cup of milk.)  Stir in the chips.  Then cook as described.  Delicious!

I was making this for my daughter as she is very picky and I am struggling to find food that is dairy free that she likes. So I ground the oatmeal to a more powder like in the blender. I didn't have carob chips so I did the applesauce and cinnamon part. They were thicker so I will add more milk but it had a wonderful flavor to it.

I agreed with the comment below that these pancakes had a strong aftertaste. Also, when substituting I reccomend that you not use carob powder instead of carob chips. They did not come out very well and was overall disatisfied with the results.

Very good recipe.  I added canned pumpkin to my batter, as I really like pumpkin/chocolate chip combination.  Doubled recipe and didn't need syrup or anything in addition to the pancakes.  Thanks for a tasty recipe!

These were pretty good! The texture was a little off (this was my first attempt at vegan pancakes) but the taste was fantastic! I didn't have chocolate chips or raisins, and I added applesauce, cinnamon and a little sugar and vanilla. Will be making these again (although I might try adding an egg or egg substitute)!

Yum!  Be sure to let the batter sit 5-10m so the flax and oatmeal have time to thicken it up.  Really yummy with peanut butter on top.

This was a very good egg free/dairy free recipe. I had to cook them longer than "normal" pancakes for them not to be mushy. Family enjoyed and asked me to make again.

These were very tasty.  I had some trouble with the pancakes sticking, but I suspect it was due to the alternate flours I used -- rice flour plus 1 tsp guar gum.  Also, to anyone else who thinks substituting oat flour for the rolled oats is a good idea: plan to add 4 cups of liquid!!!  Difficulties aside, they were tasty, the kids enjoyed them.  Thanks!

Great recipe to play around with.  I used 1 cup oat flour and 1/2 cup wheat.  Skipped the chocolate chips and added bananas, which carmelized beautifully and deliciously.  Thanks for sharing!

I was not impressed by these pancakes.  More like muffin consistency.  I served it to my family and we all agreed it was better than being hungry but I would not serve this again.

Best pancakes I've ever had. Loved the hearty texture from oats and chocolate chips were a treat. :) Let it sit for 5-10 minutes and batter will thicken up.

This recipe turned out great! The only change I made was processing the oats in my VitaMix before adding it to the recipe... the consistency was great and I cooked the pancakes for 2 minutes per side. My four-year-old loved them, and even agreed with me that they tasted better without syrup (she tried them with syrup first, and then tried them plain per my suggestion). Yummy!

YUM!  We just had these for breakfast and they were great!  I had to substitute 1/4 cup whole wheat flour because I only had a half cup of oats and I had to use cow's milk because we were out of soy, but they were great.  My 3 year old and one year old loved them.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These pancakes were very heavy and rich, but the overall taste was OK.  I thought there was a very strong baking powder aftertaste, so I suggest using a non-aluminum baking powder.  My boyfriend liked them more than I did, so I'll probably make them again.  I think I may add some sugar to the mix and use less choco. chips and see how that goes.

I liked it.  My husband didn’t but he doesn’t like anything that he thinks might be one of my “healthy” recipes.  I used regular milk and regular mini chocolate chips and ate the leftovers for breakfast the next couple of days. I will make these again when I am cooking only for me.

made this with a few notes I picked up from other reviews.  I let the batter sit 15 min before cooking as others mentioned.  I used large flake oats so it did thicken up quite a bit after sitting. also added real chocolate chips once it was on the grill.  i added 1/4 c brown sugar and used vanilla flavored almond milk.  These were great, they looked like little chocolate chip cookies!  I found the recipe was just barely enough for 2 adults and 2 toddlers, next time I'll double it.

You can substitute any "milk" product to make this recipe, if you are like me and don't use soy. I added buckwheat to thicken the  mix as I like a thicker mix prior to pouring.

Waist of ingredients.  This were the worst pancakes I ever made.  To runny. No flavor, that's good anyway, all I taste is flax.  Stuck to my pan.  Didn't puff up at all. The texture was weirs.  Hope my garbage disposal is hungry.

YUM! My kids love chocolate chip pancakes. I am so happy to find this healthy version and it was a win with the kids. My son topped his with peanut butter. They are really yummy with peanut butter and sliced banana. I did warm the milk and let the oats soak in the milk while I mixed the other ingredients.

Fried in a generous amount of oil these special pancakes are a great combination of crispy and gooey. I used old fashioned oats. No need to grind them in a food processor, they provide a nice chewy texture as is.

Did the whole milk, chocolate chips sub as well. Added a dash a vanilla, tiny bit of cocoa powder, and then banana slices to the top. Sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar over the top, flipped it a few times to make sure it was thoroughly cooked. Amazing, didn't even need the syrup honestly.

I processed the oats into a flour. I also don't really measure the milk. I just add a little at a time until it reaches the desired consistency.

We were out of eggs and these turned out delicious! I used whole wheat flour and regular milk and cut the recipe in half. We didn't have any flax seed or whatever the carob chips are, so just added a bit more flour. Sprinkled chocolate chips on top while cooking.

My son's allergic to eggs, so I'm always happy to find recipes that are egg-free by design.  To those who found the batter thin -- I don't think you waited long enough.  I actually took the milk (cow, not soy for me), warmed it a bit in the microwave, and pre-mixed the oatmeal and the flax with the warm milk and let it sit a few minutes so it had time to activate the thickening properties of both.  I didn't have pastry flour, so I did a mix of regular flour and whole wheat.  A good, filling breakfast option for the kiddos.  I made a double batch so I have plenty to reheat during the week.

Exactly what I was looking for!  When my 3 year old said, "I want mini chocolate chip pancakes for breakfast!" my first thought was, "uh... no way buddy."  But then I thought about how I could get him to eat a bunch of really healthy ingredients, under the guise of pancakes and chocolate chips and found this yummy recipe.
   I did grind up the oatmeal in the food processor, used whole wheat pastry flour, and almond milk, but otherwise used everything exactly as written and they were delicious.  My 1 year old thought they were pretty amazing too.  I'm going to freeze the rest for an easy weekday morning breakfast on the go.

Definitely the best vegan pancakes I've had. I made them with whole wheat flour and added rum extract. They were definitely NOT fluffy pancakes, but I prefer a dense hardy pancake. We were all full after 1 (except for my two year old who ate 3!)

I really liked these. I followed the recipe exactly, but used chocolate soy milk. I thought this made for a nice "double chocolate" pancake. As someone else noted, batter is thin, but I think it needs to be in order for the pancakes to cook through.

These were excellent! I loved them. I couldn't find ground flax seed though, and had no equipment on hand to grind them myself, so I bashed up a bunch of whole flax seeds with a spoon. I enjoyed the seedy chunks it left me with, and anyways, who cares if the flax is done right, as long as it's there! So healthy and yummy.

i used whole flax seeds and rolled oats chopped in a food precessor with some apple and banana chunks to wet the mix.  also used raisins and cinnamon instead of carob.  excellent taste and texture.
