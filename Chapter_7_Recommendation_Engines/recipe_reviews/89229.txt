You can extract more juice per orange if you microwave the orange first for about 10 seconds

This is excellent. It certainly doesn't need added sugar :) I did it by hand with a reamer which can be a little tiring on the wrist, but not bad. I don't like to use the microwave when I don't need to, so I boiled water in my teapot and let the oranges sit in the boiling water for a minute. Then I rolled them around on the counter until they felt softer. I plan on making this often!

Tropicana has nothing on me!  I can have fresh orange juice from the tree to the table in under 15 minutes!  I've been blessed with the juiciest, sweetest oranges; 3 oranges yield 16 oz. of orange juice.

I am giving it a "5" because fresh orange juice is very nutritious, but I can't believe someone actually submitted a recipe for this.  Dah!

we love hand squeezed orange juice.  We peel oranges place, then place in blender, till smooth then strain through fine strainer.  I works very well, without all the hard work.

I've squeezed my own juice for years.  I also like to bake a lot with orange zest.  So, I zest my oranges, lemons, and limes before squeezing them.  Wrap the zest in a little piece of plastic wrap and drop into a zip lock bag and toss into the freezer.  Ready when ever you want it.

Wow! This was very good and quite frankly and excuse to use my black and decker juicer that's been in the back of the cupboard.  All I added was a little Splenda - nice change from the store bought stuff!

Valencias are best. Navels taste flat. Most grocery stores in my area don't get Valencias. I buy private label Valencia fresh squeezed at Meijer's in Indiana. Best dairy case juice on the market. We used to entertain the founder of Tropicana at our home at Derby time in Louisville.

Good guideline to follow because its basic- all you need is oranges! I looked up a "recipe" for fresh squeezed OJ because I wasn't sure how many oranges to use for a specific yield, and if sugar should be considered...so to find this guideline DID answer a few initial questions. Also, the tip to smack them on the counter was a good one.

HOWEVER, I found the yield to be WAY off! If I only had used 4 oranges, I doubt I would have made even two full servings! (at a 1/2 c. each). The recipe should specify LARGE navel oranges (not just "oranges) if the quantity is to be 4 oranges. I used 5 "regular" navels (passed on the large ones at $1 each) as well as an entire netted bag of "Cuties" (the clementines from CA- which are small, but I thought I'd throw a few in for a more dynamic taste...good thing I purchased them because 5 oranges wouldn't have been enough and I ended up using the entire bag!). This combo tasted great and yielded 3 cups of juice. I used a Cuisinart citrus juicer and really got the juice out of each one. I made this for Christmas morning breakfast.

This was difficult to make, but overall good. I had cuts on my hands, so I wore latex gloves to prevent the cuts from stinging. I added a packet of sugar since I like things a little sweet. It was nice and fresh, the way I wanted it to be.

FYI..If you have the PowerJuicer it only takes 2 1/2 small oranges to make 1 cup of OJ.   I also add a little bit of sugar cause it can be a little tart.

if you live in Florida the best Oranges to get are when they are still slightly greenTHey( tast so much better). Then you go to all the roads from which the orange groves are!!! when a truck loaded with oranges turns a corner they fall off !!!!!!! pick them up ,take them home ,,,FREEZe Oranges freeze very well .
 Then when you defrost them they have twice as much juice as when they were freesh ,but with the same tast.
    SO THIS WAY YOU CAN HAVE FRESH SQUEESED ORANGE ALL YEAR ROUND 
THATS WHAT I DO

If you live where I do  or where oranges are plentiful in Winter, buy a little electric critris juicer ()about $10.00) and as somebody else said you get more out of your orange.  It's just like a hand juicer but electric.  Wait till your oranges are ripe (soft) and you will get better flavor and more juice, if you don't live in orange country.

The trick of Orange Juice is to use Valencia Oranges...Navel oranges just don't work for juice...don't worry about how they look...some can look terrible but they taste wonderful...Valencias are also called "juice oranges"...I get about 1/2cup juice out of 2 'regular' sized Valencias...I get about 1 cup of juice out of 3 large ones.
I use an electric juicer...but if you don't have one...you can juice any citrus with a fork: cut the fruit in half...use a knife to take out any seeds...Stick the fork into it and 'ream' it around to extract the juice, squeezing the fruit against the fork...you can also move the fork around...using a fork you will get more pulp out of the fruit...it's usually easy to 'fish out' any stray seeds...usually you won't have any seeds in limes.  Strain it if you don't want the pulp...that will also get rid of any seeds...but I always use it and never strain it.  Using a fork will also yield more juice - probably because of the extra pulp.  For any citrus fruit...the heavier the fruit...the more the juice...and the thinner the skin...the better it is...

WAs so surprised that people did not know how to make juice with fresh oranges!  That's what we did long before it came in cartons!  Guess I am older than I thought!   Fresh squeezed OJ is delicious.  I also squeeze lemons and put the juice in the freezer for when I need it.  Handy!

Great! Me and my mom enjoyed this while eating breakfast. We added a little bit of lemon extract and about 1 tablespoon of graduated sugar. Ice made it pop.

Best orange juice I've ever tasted. I used a citrus juicer, it was fairly easy. Nothing else is needed. The only problem one might encounter is the number of oranges you need to make enough for several people. With 10 oranges I made about 3 cups of juice.

Took a little while to make and makes very little, but it is SOOOOO worth it. Helps to add a TINY bit of sugar.

I looked up how to make OJ, because I never made it before. I thought you had to boil the fresh squeezed juice to pastureize it, add water and some sugar and then cool it to make 2 quarts to 1/2 gallon but, I guess you don’t, thank you for sharing!

I was actually making orange syrup and didn't want to waste the oranges. 
Microwave the oranges for about 5 sec each, roll vigorously on the counter.
Cut in half and squeeze in your prefered method... hand squeeze,  spoon, electric juicer,  etc. 
Strain to your desired pulp level. 
Mix with cold water to your taste.

One sectioned orange (I love Cara Cara oranges) with a bit of water popped on to my Magic Bullet, whirled and refrigerated until morning.  Shake well. Simple but great tasting!
