I used all the ingredients, though I made a few changes.  Two of my tomatoes had gone bad, so I only used 3, and that was enough for us.  I used 4 strips of bacon.  One change I would suggest is stirring together the chicken stock, sugar, vinegar and anchovy paste, before adding to the skillet, so there would be a more even distribution.  When the cauliflower was tender-crisp, I used a slotted spoon to remove it from the skillet to a bowl.  Then, I let the liquid reduce to about one-third, and poured it over the dish.  Dee-lish!  Thanks for a way to "dress up" cauliflower that doesn't involve cheese or bread crumbs!

I skipped the anchovy paste (didn't have any), and other than that, followed the recipe. We enjoyed this! Might cut back slightly on the balsamic next time.
