What a delightful dish. It was the hit of my Sunday night dinner. There is not a single thing I would change.

Very tasty!  I acquired a bunch of free Bosc pears and had to figure out how to incorporate them into my dinner before they went bad.  I cooked up some tofu to a bacon-like consistency and flavor and skipped boiling it with the green beans and pears.  I'm sure it's even tastier as properly prepared.

Excellent, simple side dish! I made only a half recipe for two of us. No problems.
