Easy to make. I used dark chocolate chips creamy peanut butter and eliminated the shortening. Make the day before to allow time to harden when done. Wax paper prevents sticking in both phases. Good for group. High calorie.

Dangerously delicious! I was looking for a gluten-free recipe to make a treat for a friend and I am so glad I came across this one! Someone mentioned they wished the chocolate coating was thicker -just add less shortening/more chocolate chips. I omitted the walnuts on the outside and they look tres chic -like professional chocolate truffles. Excellent.

I thought the taste was all good. Just like the Reeses cups! Choc could've been thicker on the outside of the balls - but not sure how you would achieve that. Loved the flavour overall not sure I would really make them again though.

These were awesome. A friend recently got on a gluten-free diet and the search brought these up. Who knew we'd find a recipe for basically Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. We will definitely make these again.

These came together easily except for the "dipping" in the walnuts. It was just making a mess when I dipped them as indicated. So instead after dipping the balls in chocolate I sprinkled them with the nuts and kind of pushed the nuts around the sides. This was not my favorite recipe for peanut butter balls. I thought the addition of honey made them too sweet. Also I thought the walnuts were a bit odd on a peanut butter ball. I think salted peanuts would have been good on them and the salt would have been a nice contrast with how sweet they are.

I used chocolate melt to get a thicker chocolate layer on th outside. I also used super fine chopped walnuts and rolled them in the nuts. It gave just as much nut flavor without worry of the elderly or children getting chocked on the chunks of nuts. I also made theese a second time cutting the amount of shortening in half and cooking the chocolate melts (milk) until just before it reached the soft ball stage and added the super fine chopped walnuts to the chocolate mixture before dipping the balls. It was amazing just be careful with chocolate melt you wont need to add any sugar because it is already very sweet.
