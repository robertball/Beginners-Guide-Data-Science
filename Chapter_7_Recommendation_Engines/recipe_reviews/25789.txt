I've gone through a kazillion banana recipes (16 from allrecipes alone) and these were fine, but I recommend others more.  Especially since shortening is very unhealthy - if these tasted great, I wouldn't care, but I try to make sure the taste is worth the health effects!  Used 1/3 cup b.s. and 2/3 white; 2 bananas; did not make frosting, just sprinkled hot chocolate mix over top, which was good.  If you want thick bars, use a 9x9 pan - this goes fairly thin in a 9x13.  But, I suggest you make Mocha Chocolate Chip Banana Muffins, Banana Cake VI (a real winner), or Banana Chocolate Chip Cookies from this site instead.

Good basic idea for a recipe. Having to change it this much means it is basically a different recipe entirely which is why I gave this particular version 2 stars, the new and improved version would definitely be a 5.
   I used 3 small bananas in the bars, I added an egg, I cut back to sugar to 2/3 of a cup, no salt, no lemon juice, no walnuts although they would be nice, my preference is pecans which would also be good. They baked at 350 for 20 minutes.
The frosting IMO is too much, just too sweet and not really necessary with the great banana taste of the bars themselves. So I frosted first, then scraped most of it off, leaving a very thin almost glaze like covering, which is how they will be made next time.

I am sure that this is very good in its original state but I used the suggestions of other reviewers & my own.  I used butter instead of shortening & only 1/4 cup.  I used only brown sugar & cut it to 2/3 of a cup, I used 3 bananas & I added one egg.  I also didn't bother frosting it.  The bars came out great, I suspect they are fluffier than the original recipe with the help of the egg.  I will definately make them again & again!  Thanks for the inspiration!

These are wonderful, they lasted about 10 minutes at work. A little tip, bake until the center springs back when touched, the toothpick will come out clean before they are really done. I think that is why some of the other reviews complain about not being able to get them out of the pan. I will definately make these again!

These are delicious! I was a little skeptical at first seeing some 2-3 star reviews, but after tasting I rushed to my pc to write the review! What I did: DOUBLED THE RECIPE (otherwise bars are too thin in 9x13), ADDED AN EXTRA BANANA, ADDED 1 TSP. BANANA EXTRACT TO BATTER AND FROSTING, FOR FROSTING I OMITTED THE SALT AND REPLACED THE VANILLA EXTRACT W/ A HALF TSP. OF MAPLE EXTRACT.  MORE BAKE TIME. Results are to die for! Enjoy!

These are a big hit at my son's daycare! I add more banana to the recipe-at least 2 to 2 1/2 ripe bananas. The first time I used the icing I  put it on with a pastry brush. After that I started just serving them without icing at all-they great without it!

I had some very ripe bananas, and didn't know what to do with them... this was the best banana recipe I have found to date! It is now, of course my favorite! The only problem--- making enough!

I was looking for a ripened banana recipe when I came across this.  I did not want to make a bread.  

I altered the recipe in the following manner.
I had 1% milk only so I added about 3 tablespoons of sour cream to the milk making it measure about one cup.  You could probably use all sour cream. 

I had no shortening which has no flavor anyway so I used Land o Lakes buttery Spread.  Not the best choice but it creamed fine. Butter flavored shortening would be good in this

I used pecans instead of walnuts because that is all I had.  

Last of all, I used two small ripened banana which ended up being about one and half after removing the ends and dark spots.  They were ripe but not to ripe.  They had plenty of texture and firmness to them.  I smashed them by hand. LOL. 

I think these would be great with just a dusting of powdered sugar too. 

Some ideas for icings:
browned butter
cream cheese
peanut butter (small amount to the frosting recipe given)
chocolate
Any combination 

They are cooking up very nicely.  I suspect they will be great as the raw mixture was wonderful.  
Enjoy!

This recipe was a hit with my family! I just baked them this afternoon and we've all had two pieces already. I substituted whole wheat flour for the white, Splenda for the sugar and cut it by half, butter for the shortening and cut THAT by half. I also used an extra banana and added the cinnamon as so many others had recommended. I omitted the walnuts (son is allergic) and skipped the frosting. They came out so light and tasty!! Very pleased with this recipe and will make these again!

Needs a lot of tweeking. I added an egg like many suggested, my suggestion would be to either double the recipe for a 13 x 9 pan or bake in an 8 x 8 pan, way thin in the suggested pan. I would also add a half teaspoon of banana extract. I made my own frosting - a maple banana cream cheese icing, it really helped.

Wasn't too crazy about this bar.  It tastes good, but it's a little too soft and mushy, which made it hard to cut into bars and remove from the pan.

I can't rate the cake itself because I'm giving it to my parents, but I can tell you that it was easy to make, it smells wonderful and it looks beautiful in the pan!  I used a 7x11 pan so it is a little thicker and I also added an extra banana and the last egg I had in the refrigerator to use it up.  I did taste the frosting and it's sweet, but isn't frosting supposed to be?  But since I'm not a frosting lover I only used about 1/2 of it.  It has wonderful banana flavor though.  I am going to let a batch of bananas turn this weekend so that I can make it again, this time for us, and will come back to rate the cake!

These were really good.  I used 2 bananas, no lemon juice or walnuts.  I didn't make the frosting.  The bars are very sweet, and I don't think they need it.

Great bars, however the frosting did not make nearly enough in my opinion...had to spread very very thin, sprinkled lots of walnuts on top to hide the lack of frosting. Next time I would double the recipe.

Used 1/2C honey and about 1/3C sugar, and two bananas.  Had fresh lime juice on hand, so used that in place of lemon.  Baked in an 8x8" pan and wouldn't want to try it in a 13x9".  The frosting is awesome.  We were very pleased with these bars, but I think the honey definitely kicked it up a notch.

These are the best!!  I have made them several times and always get raves.  I use pecans instead of walnuts because that is what I prefer and always double the recipe for a 9x13 pan.  Also use applesauce for half if not all of shortening with great results.  Better if made the night before.  Yummo!

This was very easy to make, and tasted good. The only change I made was to add a whole banana to the icing because I didn't want to have half a ripe banana left over. The cake was a little dry, so I may add some sour cream next time. Thanks!

These banana bars are absolutely delicious! I made them just as the recipe said with a couple modifications.  I doubled the bananas and then doubled the recipe for the same size pan.  This way they were a lot thicker.  I did not make the frosting because they were close to gone before I got a chance!  I also read a review that said not to test the bars with a toothpick to see if they were done because the toothpick came out clean before they were done.  I think this is why they are sticking in the pan.  I just waited till the center bounced back when pressed with my finger and then took them out.  They were perfectly moist and did not stick in the pan.

I'm sort of up in the air as to how many stars to give this recipe. I went w/ 5 because when it comes down to it, I probably could have eaten half the pan and I like that the recipe only calls for one banana...unlike banana bread which usually calls for at least 3.It is a great alternative when you don't have that many around.  I didn't make the frosting since I was out of bananas and the bars themselves taste pretty much like banana bread, only a little sweater. I did add about 1 tsp of banana extract along w/ the vanilla. Otherwise, I stayed true to the recipe. Very good!

Phenomenal! I really enjoyed this recipe! I used 3 bananas for the cake and a whole banana for the frosting. Added about 1tsp cinnamon, as I always do with banana bread recipes. The frosting was more of a glaze for me, which I think may actually be better...not so thick and rich. Will make again!!

I stayed pretty true to this recipe to see how it stood on its own before altering it as heavily as many reviewers did here. I must say, I don't see why everyone thought this needed so many changes! It's quite good already! The only things I did change were the following: I used two bananas, but this was mainly because I had two left and needed to use both; I did not add walnuts or any nuts as I didn't have any; I baked in a 8x8 pan instead of a 9x13; I also didn't make the frosting, but that was due to lack of time. At the end, they tasted lovely and turned out very moist, fluffy, and had the perfect amount of banana flavor. I disagree that this recipe needs an egg, or one of the hundred other additions/substitutions, because as it is, it's a good treat. I will rate 4/5 stars though, because I do think 2 bananas instead of 1 adds more flavor and makes it taste better.

This was an exceptional recipe. The only changes I made was based on other reviews comments, such as adding 2 bananas instead of 1. This made the banana flavor really come alive. The finished product was like banana bread with more fluffiness. No frosting is needed to make this recipe fantastic as it already is.

Very good. Skipped the frosing, dusted with powdered sugar. I used 2 bananas, rice milk, no nuts, applesauce instead of shortening, a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon, some freshly grated nutmeg, and 1 Tbs ground flax seed mixed w/3 Tbs water (some reveiwers mentioned adding an egg, this is my normal substitute.)I used a 9 X 7 pan and baked for 25 minutes. The "bars" (really just a "snack" cake) came out moist, springy and delicious! Will make again!

This should really be called banana cake not banana bars. It is definitely more like cake. This was a huge hit for Easter Sunday-a little crumbly and messy but tasted awesome.I did not have shortening so I used butter instead.

The bars were amazing!  Almost like banana bread.  I'm not too thrilled with the frosting though.  I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to it hoping it would help and I think next time I'll find a different frosting for them.  If not, the bars are great alone...maybe with some vanilla icecream! :)

THE best banana bars I've ever had! Made the recipe as-is, and it turned out perfectly. I got rave reviews from my family at our annual New Years Eve get-together.

Awesome!  Love the banana in the frosting!  I also added some pecans, sunflower seeds and mini chocolate chips the last time I made these!  Big hit with the kids!

I LIKE THIS RECIPE, MADE IT LAST NIGHT, BUT THE ICING TURNED VERY HARD ON TOP OF THE CAKE I MADE THEM INTO CUPCAKES AND ADDED SOME STAR SPRINKLES TO GET THE KIDS TO EAT THEM. MY HUSBAND ALSO ENJOYED THEM. KIDS HAVE YET TO TRY THEM.

I am only reviewing the icing because i used this to go with banana bread cookies also on this site.  I find that there is way too much salt in the icing. I'm not sure i've ever used salt in a icing/frosting before. It was overwhelming. It was also a bit too sweet, and trust me- i like sweet, but this was a little too much!

The bars were good, but the same as any banana bread recipe.  The frosting was very salty.  I would have omitted the salt.

This is a very good and easy recipe to put together.
Smells and tastes like banana bread with icing.
The icing was really sweet but good.
I added pecans because that is all I had and it was delicious.
I have made this twice already and plan to make it again.
Great for company or having friends over for coffee.

I also tried this recipe and altered it. I was scared to do it, but I used 1/4 c. butter and 1/4 cup homemade applesauce. I added an egg too and 2 bananas, lessened the sugar to 2/3 using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.....it turned out amazing and the frosting is really good too which I added a whole banana instead of 1/2. It's very banana-ey and really is terrific. I've never tried altering a baking recipe and I'm pleased my instincts were sound on this.

As the recipe is written, the bars end up rather thin and slightly dry. That noted, it's a really good recipe and to be honest, I downed the last five bars after my family went to sleep, so they must have been pretty good. I would prepare this again and probably double the batch so the bars are thicker. The volume of frosting is barely enough to cover the bars, so if you like a thicker frosting, consider making making making 50% more frosting than that in the recipe.

I followed this recipe to the letter except I used 1 cup of brown sugar in place of the white sugar. My grandson is allergic to eggs and I am always skeptical of baked goods without them. These bars were dense and moist they disappeared immediately! The banana in the frosting is to die for. I am going to try this same recipe using mashed apple pie filling in the bars and frosting.

OH MY GOD!! These are OUTSTANDING!! I took the advice of some of the other reviews and did 2/3 c Brown Sugar, 1 Egg, and 2 Bananas. For the icing (even though some people said it was better without it) I cut the powdered sugar down to 1 cup (to prevent it from being SUPER sweet) and added a bit more banana (about 3/4) to the icing. My god, this was FANTASTIC!

However, because it is autumn and pumpkin is what is eaten around this time, I made this again using 1 c Fresh Pumpkin Puree, 3/4 tsp Clove, 1/2 tsp Allspice, a Heaping tsp of Cinnamon, and 3/4 tsp of Nutmeg and it came out EVEN BETTER THAN THE BANANA!! :D Thank you for this recipe!

I don't know what all the negative comments were about. These things are awesome!! The icing isn't a true icing at best. It is meant to be more of a glaze which is fine, I like that. The bars aren't meant to be thick, that would make them more like cake or a brownie and that isn't what they are, they are a BAR. Thin and to the point. I like bananas but this made me really love them. I use it as a quick breakfast to go with my coffee when I am in a rush. I have made them 4 times now and I think they are great. You need the lemon juice to prevent the bananas from turning brown, even after you bake them they will still turn. Don't omit any thing, its there for a reason!

This was a very tasty recipe, though I followed some of the recommendations in the comments.  I used butter instead of shortening and had 4 small very ripe bananas on hand, so used all of them.  I also used brown sugar instead of white and left out the lemon juice.  Also, I did not glaze or frost these.  In fact, I would reduce the sugar on these next time to about 1/2 cup. I prefer things less sweet.  I had to bake an additional 10 minutes to get them done all the way. Probably due to the extra bananas.  Great flavor and texture.

this is o.k.  I think I'm looking for a banana bar with some spice to it, I baked it for 30 min instead of 20min,  but my family didn't think it was great so I won't be making it again.

these were good with modifications! i added an extra banana, used 1/3c b sugar 2/3c white sugar, added 1/2t cinnamon, 2 dashes ginger and a dash nutmeg and baked in a 9x9 pan, which took long to bake, and it got VERY golden brown, but was terrific! these would be very skinny if put in a 9x13 pan i would think. my only regret being adding choc chips to it! it took away from the great banana taste!

DELICIOUS!  The only thing I changed was to omit the walnuts and add an egg.  It was absolutely wonderful!  My husband wanted to eat the whole pan.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I will definitely be making these again.

In our house we call this banana cake. It is much more of a cake than a bar. After you make this you will ever want to make banana bread again. this recipe is amazing. I use three bananas instead of one and my family does not like walnuts so i leave those out. I have tried it with no icing, the banana icing, chocolate icing and brown butter icing, and it is good every time.

Wonderfully good!  Was a great recipe for those bananas sitting on the counter that needed to be used.  I did add 2 eggs to make a little more fluffy.  Also, I added some coco to the icing.  They were great.  One word of advise they do not keep well, unless left overs are placed in fridge.

There were delicious. I never actually put any frosting on them because they're sweet enough as it is. I decreased the sugar to 3/4 of a cup and that was plenty. They pretty much taste like banana bread... only yummier.

These are amazing. Everyone who has tried it really likes it! I think the frosting turned out to be more of a thicker glaze, but it's still incredibly good. To reiterate what other users have posted, the frosting is a necessity.

I was expecting to make "bars" not cake like dessert.  The flavor was ok but the texture is weird.  My kids didn't really care for it.

I made the frosting on deltaj's "frosted banana bars" and it turned out really good, BUT it was a litttlllleee too salty. I'd cut back to a pinch. (:

My kids love this!  Thank you!  I did make a couple changes after reading reviews...I made it with 3 bananas and then I used 1/2 c. brown sugar.  Very, very good.

As with other reviewers I changed various parts of the recipe (used 1/4 cup butter & 1/4 cup shortening, 1/2 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 large bananas, no lemon juice, no nuts) but in the end, it turned out really well - great flavor and texture! Will definitely use again!

These were wonderful - dense, moist and sweet.  I used an 8x8 pan, whole wheat pastry flour, butter, and extra lemon juice. I think this is something I'll be making over and over again.

Excellent recipe.  Made as recipe states, except for adding another banana to the cake mixture.  The icing was a little sweet, but it was still good.  This will find a home in my recipe box.

Love These Banana Bars! Hubby gave it a 10 - He never gives anything a 10 so that says a lot. I doubled the recipe and used 1 extra banana in the batter, baked it in an 11x13 pan. The frosting came out wonderful, a bit runny right out of the food processor but a few minutes in the fridge fixed it right up. 

Other than the extra banana, I followed the recipe exactly, fluffy moist and excellent!
I will be making these for our next lunch social.

Moist, delicious.  I made mine in two round 8" pans, no frosting.  Instead, I cut into wedges and dusted with 3 different toppings; cocoa powder, powdered sugar, cinnamon.  Both cakes were gone same day!

I found this to be a little dense - more like banana bread than a cake or bar. The flavor is good, although I added an extra banana as per reviews from this site. I also omitted the frosting and used the fluffy peanut butter frosting from this site instead - great flavor combination! This recipe was a good way to use my over ripe bananas but I don't think I will try this one again.

Pretty tasty.  I followed some previous advice and replaced half of the white sugar with brown, added an egg and upped the bananas.  They had a little too much banana flavor for me (I used 2 1/2) but my husband and daughter gobbled them up.  Would be really good with chocolate chips!!

Very tasty and super moist.  I followed the recommendations of others: used butter (1/4 cup) in place of the shortening, used more bananas (3 small) and added an egg and a teaspoon of cinnamon.  We did not even bother with the icing - they were a huge hit without it.  Thanks for another great way to use up my VERY ripe bananas!

They were wonderful. A complete success in my house. (They were gone in half a day) I listened to the other reviewers and added 3 bananas instead of 1.  I used butter instead of shortening (and halved it). I also only used 2/3 a cup of sugar. I also added an egg. Also, didn't have lemon juice...and it didn't seem to matter.

Great snack!

Mmm Mmm!  These are delicious!  I made a few changes, using half as much butter instead of shortening, swapping some brown sugar for part of the regular sugar, and upping the bananas to 2 1/2 instead of just one.  They are wonderful!  The banana in the icing makes a delicious change of taste.  Will definitely make again!

No eggs, no baking powder required! :) Used butter instead of shortening, 1/2 cup brown sugar vs. 1 cup white sugar, buttermilk vs. milk, added 1/2 tspn cinnamon, omitted nuts, upped bananas from 1 to 2 1/2 & used an electric mixer to blend. Too lazy for icing! Tastes great! Might try more sugar & cinnamon next time...very bready flat bar. Ono recipe - my version wasn't overtly sweet as some reviews had claimed. Might try orange zest next time...?! ALOHA!

Delicious and easy to prepare.  What more could a cook as for?  I didn't like the idea of banana in the frosting, so I left out the banana and the salt, then added a little milk to thin out the frosting to more of a glaze consistency.  My husband just loves them.  Great recipe.  Definitely try this one.

These cookies are so good!  They are easy to make, and uses ingredients you have on hand.  I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar and a tsp of cinnamon to my batter just because I think those things go so well with bananas anyway.  I didn't want a thick frosting on my cookie, so when I made the frosting I added milk to it until it resembled a thicker type of glaze, and drizzled that with a fork over the uncut cooking.  I then covered with foil and put them in the fridge, and my family just cuts off a piece when they want some.  Thanks, Lori for a great new recipie!  I might try to add some other ripe mashed fruit to the batter next time (like strawberries or raspberries, even blueberries when they're in season) and just adjust the sugar content accordingly.  Thanks again!

These were a huge hit!  The only thing I changed was using a little more banana (1 1/2).  I baked until it sprang back in the center, per someone's tip here, and the bars came right out of the pan.  Delicious!

These bars are tasty although the frosting is a little sweet.  I added lime juice to tone down the sweetness a little.  They smell great baking up!!  I added extra bananna to the cake and the frosting which made them even better!

This recipe is wonderfully moist and delicious.  It tastes very similar to the banana cake my granny used to make.  I'm not fond of cakes personally but this recipe is much more moist than a cake and I love it!  I used pecans instead of walnuts and it came out GREAT!  My family loves it too and they are as picky as me!!!

This recipe was easy, quick, and delicious.  It was rather messy cutting the iced bars, so I recommend serving directly from the cake pan. (Perhaps I didn't wait long enough before cutting.)

Added bonus....the batter had no eggs so the kids can lick the bowl(for a change!)

loved the end product, but it lost one star for me because I found it waaaaaay too sweet.  Next time I'll figure out a way to make it with less sugar content.  I increased the banana by two, and substituted the shortening with coconut oil.  As another reviewer did, I doubled the icing recipe so it would cover the entire pan well.

Made this today and I was actually shocked to find that it was moist and really delicious.  I used 1 stick of butter, 4 bananas and a tad more milk and flour.  It didn't need frosting, but had some on hand for my husband.  He loved the bars.  This is a keeper!

Very good and easy. I used 2 bananas, a 9x9 pan and did not add the frosting, it was sweet enough as is. I also baked it longer, until it sprung back when lightly touched, as another reviewer recommended

I did make changes based on other reviews. Used 1/3 cup of butter in place of shortening, 2/3 cup brown sugar instead of 1 cup of white sugar & added an egg & extra bananas. It was delicious! I made the icing as is & oh, yes, baked in a smaller pan, 7 x 11, for 30 minutes. I will definitely make again!

I did use butter and half brown and white sugar.  What amazed me was the no egg!  I reread the recipe four times and scanned the reviews to be sure it wasn't a mis print.

So, butter is better and it is true that the center bounces back but it's still pretty gooey inside.  Otherwise these were really yummy.

These tasted OK, but were really thin. They could use a bit more banana flavor, also. I will try again using two bananas and make in a smaller pan with a longer bake time.

This is one of the most delicious banana desserts I have ever eaten in my life and and I generally don't like banana anything. This is the first recipe that I have ever spent the time to rate. The only extra thing that I did was put in more banana's because I wanted to use all of 4 of them.  Best dessert ever!

Yes, I made changes to the recipe. The first time I made it was not so good. My kids still ate it. The second time I made it I followed the directions. The only thing I did was cut the sugar to 2/3 cup and used  raw sugar. I used two bananas and butter because I did not have shortening.

I made these with high expectations.  Unfortunately they did not come out to my standards.  Taste is fine for the bar part.  The icing was way too sweet and extremely runny.  I ended up adding more banana and more powdered sugar to make it even somewhat acceptably spreadable.  If I make these bars again, I will frost with my own cream cheese icing.
***I changed my original review from 3 stars to 4.  The reason?  I made these to take to a function, being very skeptical if I should even take them.  Hubby convinced me to take them in and I'm glad I did!  There were a number of "20-something"-year-old young men at this function and they all loved these.  One even offered to pay me $20 a week to make him a batch and send to his house!  I personally was a tad disappointed in them, but young men love them.

Made these for our neighborhood block party and they were a hit.  I only used 1/2 c of sugar and they were plenty sweet.  Used two bananas for the batter instead of one.  Used butter in lieu of shortening

I followed recommendations from Krista W. using butter not shortening, 2/3C brown sugar instead of white sugar, added 1 egg and used 3 overripe bananas. I would definitely make these again. I made cream cheese frosting (not too sweet) and sprinkled crushed walnuts on top.  Good stuff!

I added two bananas instead of quoted one banana. Would suggest,to either double recipe, as they were not thick enough. This recipe would be best baked in a 8" square baking dish. Very tasty!

Very good! I did make some changes based on other reviews and what I had on hand. I doubled the recipe and added cinnamon and an egg. Found I was short on flour, so used 1 1/2 cups each of all purpose wheat and oat flour. I added 2  teaspoons of baking powder. Skipped the frosting and dusted with powdered sugar after baking 35 minutes. Took it to a neighborhood gathering and served it with ice cream. It didn't last long!

Personally I want mine to be dense. I used 1 1/2 bananas and I could barely taste them. IF I attempt this recipe again, I would use at least 2 large bananas and add an extra egg.

Needed a recipe to use up ripe bananas I had but that didn't use eggs.  This did the trick!  I skipped the frosting and made a coffee cake streusel topping for the top instead.  Delicious!

I doubled this recipe, substituted half the shortening with applesauce, omitted the milk (the applesauce made the batter very moist), cut back on the sugar and used chocolate chips in place of the walnuts (I love chocolate!).  I did not bother with the frosting. Everybody (kids and adults) enjoyed this one. Thanks for sharing.

Sooo good! Easy and turn out wonderfully! I used all butter, rather than shortening, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. That is what I would prefer each time, but this time I also had to substitute maple syrup for vanilla and orange juice for the lemon juice because I didn't have either. They were rich and delicious.

Easy, quick and really good!!  I made it to take for a dinner we were invited for and everyone ate seconds! I used two bananas instead of one as I wanted a strong banana taste, and I used pecans not walnuts! Otherwise I followed the directions as stated.

I tried this recipe and and can't find any eggs is this recipe.  I did put some in as I had other recipes and they all had eggs in them, otherwise it is a very good recipe and the frosting with the banana is excellent.

I absolutely loved these! I was a bit afraid to make them after all of the horrible reviews but They were phenominal! I will definietly make these again. I decreased the shortening to 1/4+1/2 of a 1/4 cup butter, decreased the sugar to 1/3+1/2 of a 1/3 cup, added an egg, used whole wheat flour, used 3 bananas, and omitted the lemon juice and walnuts. Yummy! I also only made 1/2 of the frosting and used a whole banana in it.

Thanks for a great recipe! Gave my sweety a choice between this or banana bread and he chose this. He picked well. I did use half vanilla extract & half banana extract and I forgot the lemon juice in the icing (maybe that is why is was so much sweeter than the bars) but they still turned out well. Will definitely use this one again and I saved it to my recipe box!

This was just okay for me. Edible, but not something I'd like to take to anyone's house. The frosting was on the sweet side and I like sweet! It was a cake, not bars. I'd rather use my turning bananas in the Creamy Banana Bread recipe from this site. It is so much more rewarding in my oppinion.

The cake recipe was very good but, the frosting was just too heavy and sweet for me.  The banana flavor really came through.  As suggested by others, I added an egg and used cake flour instead of all purpose.  I will make again with a different frosting

Awesome! I used butter in place of shortening, added an egg, another 1/2 banana and an additional 1/3 cup flour to cake. These are very sweet but oh so yummy! Will def make again and I have already been asked to pass recipe along. Thanks!

I loved these bars! Brought a pan to work and they were gone within 20 minutes!  I made one small change, I added cherries and crushed pineapple to the frosting. Will make these again whenever I have ripe bananas!

I used margarine instead of shortening and soymilk instead of regular milk and cut out the nuts. They tasted really good, but they were more like cake than bar cookies. They seemed to turn a little brown after sitting out for a while so they probably need to be refrigerated.

I did recipe almost exactly as submitted except for the following: *I only had 1% milk, so I added a couple of T. of sour cream. *Sprinkled some cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry mixture. *Used 1 1/2 bananas in the batter.  I made these last night and all but one bar (that I am saving for my hubby) were eaten by 7pm! My mom went crazy over these and my friend kept saying "delicious" over and over.   This is an awesome recipe and is one of the few that I have found that calls for only two bananas- which is perfect if you only have a few you are trying to use up.  This is a keeper and I will be making again- in fact, I plan on buying some bananas right away for the purpose of letting them ripen for this recipe! I loved the texture and the icing is heavenly with the taste of the fresh banana. If you wanted to do a lighter version you wouldn't have to have the icing, but, man, is it good!  Great submission!!!

We love love this recipe.  My husband wrinkled his nose the first time because I put bananas in the frosting, but it must not have mattered because he ate more than half of the pan!  I substitute the vanilla in the bar recipe for 1/2 banana extract and 1/2 vanilla and put banana extract in the frosting.  I use a pampered chef stone for baking.  The bars come out perfectly done every time.

I made these into cupcakes and I am very happy! I made a few substitutions, I used butter instead of shortening, but added an egg to give it the structure it would lose not using shortening, and I used brown sugar- which is something I do in over half my recipes because I prefer the taste. I also added extra banana! They were excellent! Moist and fluffy!

GREAT FOR BANANA LOVERS!!! These are SO yummy!!!! I did add an egg and a couple dashes of cinnamon to the batter and it came out PERFECT!!!! The frosting was very good with double the banana. My bananas were VERY very ripe. No need to cut the brown spots off, it just adds more banana flavor.

SO DELICIOUS! I would either cook in a smaller pan or double the recipe to make them thicker. Other than that they were wonderful, and the FROSTING IS NECESSARY. It is wonderful!

Yummy!! I made these to use up some old bananas.  My husband took them to work and his co-workers loved them and were asking for the recipe.  The only change I made was to substitute applesauce for the shortening.

What a wonderful recipe. I was looking for an alternative to banana bread. This was delicious. My husband absolutely loved it. The only thing I did different was I used a glaze rather than frosting, but I am sure the frosting would have been just as good.

Outstanding!  I added an extra banana for extra banana flavor.  I also left out the lemon juice and nuts because I didn't have any, and it was still great.  I would definitely double this for a 9x13 dish, otherwise I think they're too thin of a bar.  
I topped these with a banana/milk chocolate/cream cheese frosting.  I made a basic cream cheese frosting, added one mashed banana, and about 3/4 cup milk chocolate chip, melted.  My husband couldn't eat this fast enough!  YUM!!

This recipe is fabulous!!!  I followed the recipe exactly except I did add more bananas.  I wanted to make this on a large sheet cake pan, so I doubled the recipe and the bananas!  I didn't use the icing, because these were delicious with out it!  Best Banana bars I have ever had! Thanks for sharing this Recipe!

Our family thought these bars were tooth-achingly sweet -- and that wasn't a good thing!  I even reduced the sugar in the frosting and that didn't really make a difference.  I'll keep looking for a new banana dessert recipe.

I was in a pinch before grocery day and needed a recipe for breakfast muffins without eggs.  I prepared this batter before I went to bed and made muffins out of it first thing in the morning.  They tasted wonderful but the ones we ate right out of the oven completely crumbled in our hands.  We had the leftovers later that day and they were much better.  Tasted JUST like banana bread but they were very soft and delicate.  I altered the recipe just a bit because I was afraid they wouldn't rise properly after sitting in the fridge all night so I included both baking soda and baking powder.  I also added about 1/2 tsp of butter flavoring.  The batter was a little bit too much for 12 muffins.  I filled them too full trying to use it all up and ended up with big flat muffin tops that stuck to the pan.  Maybe next time I'll do 2 batches of mini-muffins.

This is an outstanding recipe, it was one of the hits of our son's graduation open house.  Very moist, very sweet, very easy!  I didn't use the lemon juice called for because I didn't have any, I don't know how they could have been any better.  This ones a winner!

These were pretty-goos, but a smaller baking pan would have been a better idea because the bars were slightly thin. Also, the icing was tastey, but it was overly sweet.

I was out of eggs, but needed a way to use just 2 bananas which were past their prime.  I replaced half the shortening with butter and, instead of making the frosting (out of powdered sugar as well), used both of the bananas in the batter.  Turned out very moist and once cooled, could be cut into bars.  Thanks for the recipe.

Pretty good, easy to whip up. My husband came home with enough bananas to feed all the monkeys in the Bronx Zoo so I am making every thing banana I can find.
This is tasty and the kids love it!

The bars are really good. I like how there is so little fat in the recipe. I did use 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup sugar. I did not however like the frosting. It had the consistancy of the raw bread batter to me and was not appealing.

Definitely a keeper! I loved the recipe and my kids devoured 2 of them right away. I did make changes based on previous reviews. I replaced shortening with 1/4 cup butter. Reduced sugar to 1/2 cup. Added 1 egg. Used 2 ripe bananas. Added 1/4 tsp cinnamon. For the frosting I only needed 1 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar and omitted the salt. They just turned out so good and moist. The frosting adds a perfect touch. Thank you!

great recipe i really enjoy banana bread but this was a great variation on a sweet favorite. It was gone before I knew it next time will double the recipe for my large family. I added a little more banana than called for and it was wonderful.

Surprisingly good considering there are no eggs.  I didn't even use any frosting..just ate it plain..like a banana bread.  Yummy!  Changes I made: I added some cinnamon, and I used half white sugar and half brown sugar and next time will try using margarine instead of the shortening. A keeper, especially when I have an over-ripe banana just sitting around.

I was looking for an alternative to banana bread and was pleased with this recipe. I  baked them in a smaller pan for a more cake-like bar and mixed the frosting with whipped cream to make it fluffier. Very good.

The banana icing was very rich, but tasty. However, the bars just didn't have enough banana flavor for my liking. I notice that some reviewers added more bananas to the recipe, and I wish I would have. The recipe was a bit disappointing to me.

These were OK.  Not really what I was expecting.  I think it would be better if the cake were more bananaey and then a nice lemon icing on top IMHO.

Wonderful change from banana bread!
Was kinda scared due to some of the ratings but these were DELICIOUS! 
I used 2 bananas and substitued brown sugar for the white. 
Would be just great without the icing will add golden raisins next time.....

We absolutely love these!!  So much in fact that I made a second pan of them this afternoon after the first I made disapeared within 48 hours.  One thing that I did differently on the second batch is cut the frosting in half adding a bit more lemon juice as it was a bit too sweet for our tastes with all of the recipe's frosting.

These bars are really yummy! It is hard to eat just one!! Next time I make them I will add golden raisins (or regular raisins) to the recipe. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These were ok, the taste, though, was a little too bananaey, and it kind of made me sick.  I'd rather make banana bread with my ripe bananas.

Very easy to make!  Excellent and light!  Added extra banana to the batter and some brown sugar.
Next time would add less sugar. Very sweet.

I thought these were good but not anything special.  I considered this recipe more of a cake than cookies or bars and the frosting was a little too sweet.  I was suprised to find out that one of my kids thought this was just okay and the other one did not like at all.  Sorry

These are wonderful and easy!  I have a convection oven so I dropped the temp. to 325, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  I was looking for something a bit more like a heavier dessert bar, this was more cake-like, but it still got rave reviews from my husband and friends.

Pretty simple to make, even with the frosting, and very tasty.  I made a batch, gave half to a friend for his birthday and brought another half to a party I was attending.  Everyone gave it rave reviews, and the birthday boy even asked for the recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and they were very good.  They were also great without the frosting, if you want to save some calories. I will make these again with my left over ripe bananas.
