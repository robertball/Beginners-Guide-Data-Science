I'm Vietnamese and I absolutely love this dish. Instead of baking it however I fry it in a pan with olive oil. It doesn't turn out so dry that way. Wonderful served over rice with soy sauce.

Certainly easy to make but this needs more! I would suggest adding some honey soy sauce and hoisin sauce (and maybe fresh garlic instead of powder) to the ingredients. If you like heat red pepper flakes or chili powder too! That may help!

It doesn't get much easier than this and the results were pretty tasty too. Chinese 5 Spice can be a bit over-powering so I followed the recipe's recommended marinading time of two hours and I actually thought it was sufficient. I decided to cook the chicken on the Foreman grill as baked chicken can sometimes turn out a bit dry and leathery. I served it with sesame noodles and a spring roll. Not bad at all. Thanks!

It was very easy to make this particular entree. Easiness however is the only good thing about this recipe. This chicken recipe turned out to be dry bland and just plain uninspired.

Very good recipe. I breaded it and I pan seared and baked it on 350 for 45 minutes (Colorado altitude).
