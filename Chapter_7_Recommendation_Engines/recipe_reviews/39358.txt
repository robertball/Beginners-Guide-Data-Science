Thanks for the memories.
My grandmother use to make these and I had never seen a recipe to try. She just us to make them and had never written the recipe down. The minute I tasted the preserves I went back in time. I followed your recipe I did have to cook a little longer. I sent some to my sisters and they had the same reaction. These are going to my Mom as a gift for Mother's Day and her birthday, along with some other baked goods, which will include bread to put these delicious preserves on. These will make her day, it sure did mine. I will keep this recipe to make every year. Thank you.

This is a good recipe for what has become an old favorite in my family.  The only thing we do differently is to drop the food coloring in at the end.  We dye half the jars red and half green.  We also throw in thinly sliced lemons at the bottom of the jars.  These are delicious sweet pickles.

For those of you who are not familiar with these, or for those who have made them and left the comments about them 'not ever thickening up' for them; They really are not what you'd normally consider to be a traditional 'preserve'. These are actually what are also more often  called 'Watermelon Pickles'. They are usually used as a type of condiment, and eaten just like a 'regular pickle'. They are more similar to a sweet type of pickle that you would either snack on, or eat along side of other kinds of foods, than they are a preserve that you would traditionally use to spread onto some type of bread. Also, they have more of a sweet & sour, or tangy & spicy kind of flavor than they do a fruity type of flavor normally associated with a 'preserve'. As such, in order to be fair to the recipe, please try to keep all of that in mind when leaving your reviews. Here are some other helpful hints & tips that I hope you can find to be useful; Some of the other names that this recipe is usually called are Watermelon Candy, Watermelon Pickles, and/or Pickled Watermelon. Also, if you'd like your Watermelon Pickles to have a bit more crunch to them, soak them in Alum rather than salted water. It's also better to slice them into 2" long strips/chunks if you'll be eating them like a 'regular' pickle. Hopefully this will help to erase some of the confusion out there that has been caused due to the recipe's name. Try this recipe if you haven't done so yet, and you WILL be pleasently suprised!

This was a very good and helpful recipe just in time for Easter. My sister brought a watermelon in with her and I put the left-overs to good use. The only thing I did different was to reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup and replace it with 1/4 cup of red sugar crystals. It added color and got rid of my extras from Valentine's day baking.

This is great stuff. I love watermelon rind preserves and I never could find a good recipe for them. My great great-grandmother had a cookie recipe that you make with these preserves and they worked out perfect. And for one of the previous reviews, these preserves aren't supposed to "jell." Everything is supposed to stay runny and syrupy. Btw, for best results, soak in alum instead of salt water.

YUMMMMMMMY! We love this on hot buttered bread or biscuits. I used a bit more red food coloring and food proccessor to make it less chunky and more like apple butter texture. I froze the extra syrup to use as a starter for the next batch. Thanks!

Pretty tasty! Bumped it to 4 stars after I've had time to let the taste of them grow on me. Plus, I think these things are LOADED with fiber! Can't complain in that dept. The rinds are delicately flavored and slightly sweet. There's something earthy about the way they taste...I can't put my finger on it. I didn't use a scale for my preserves (I just eyeballed it) and came up with 3 pints of preserves. The hardest part is just cutting up the rind. There was a lot of left over syrup which is technically just "simple syrup" so you could re-use it for any recipe that calls for that (like ice cream). This was fun and different, thanks!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong.  Taste was good but didn't jell like it should have.  It was difficult to judge how much rind to use.  Try again. Perhaps using a scale.

Not that good.  Fairly weird with too many spices and not enough fruit-flavor.  Note: Be sure to peel the green rind off of the whiter part before boiling.

I thought this was an interesting way to use watermelon rind, as I am German decent and I don't like to waste anything, but I added a couple handfuls of 'red hots' which contributed to the other problems verbalized for the needed red coloring tint and it also thickened up the recipe some, not to mention adding some extra cinnamon kick.

Flavor is there...my first time making these kinds of preserves. Lots to learn. This batch didn't set quite as it should so I am reprocessing....(note to self...when recipe calls for 4 lemons...don't just use the only 2 you have. Go buy more). The are begining to boil now so I should be in high cotton soon! I really forgot the importance of the acid in jams, jellies & preserves.

I had never even heard of watermellon rind preserves until I read this recipe, but I am learning to can and thought that I would be out very little if this recipe went horribly wrong. It didn't! I had no Idea watermellon rind could be so yummy! My only issue is that it is very very sweet and the processing time is not on the recipe. I processed for 15 minutes and that seems to be doing well. The spice flavor of this is perfect with bagles and cream cheese. Heavenly! I can't wait to buy more watermellon! My kids were plesently surprised as well, and when you add the food coloring it looks so pretty in the jar that I'm gonna make extra this summer to give out as Christmas gifts.

I made these preserves years and years and years ago. I haven't made them in quite a while because I lost my recipe and every year during watermelon season have gone on the internet looking for one that sounds familiar. Here it is! It is a lot of work (peeling the rind) but it is more than worth it. I found some in the store but they just were not the same. I try to tell everyone to try these if they like watermelon. Thank you so much for the recipe.

This recipe came straight from my mother's Kerr Home Canning Book so I know it is good. For those who don't know, the salt you use must be canning salt. I drained the brine (salt water) off and rinsed the cubes in a colander. Most recipes call for processing in the hot water bath for from 5 to 15 minutes.
Mine are in hot water as I type. Had less than a jar left over and the Boss told me to hide the jars. It is that good. Lemony, cinnamony, and sweet.

Great flavor!  Instead of adding food coloring, we have a mulberry bush full of berries, so I added a handful.  I also used the emulsion blender to have it not be so chunky and thicken it up a bit.

There is a recipe that doesn't call for saltwater soak that I would like to try to compare.  But this one was good. A lot more 'candied'. than a recipe I used a couple years ago which I can't find.
