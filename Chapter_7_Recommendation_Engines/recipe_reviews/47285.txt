These have a nice, moist brownie texture. However, I think they'd be better with an extra teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. Also, I used orange juice concentrate instead of orange juice in the glaze to make the orange flavor more perceptible.

Soo good! Doubled the spices as advised and I baked mine in a 9x13 pan with no problems. Also made the drizzle with orange concentrate as suggested too and it was great, thought it was too orangey at first but the more I ate it the more I thought it was perfect. Would be good without the glaze too as it is so moist.  I am putting this in my recipe file for sure. Easy to make and so tasty, everyone has to try this.

My friends and I thought that this was good but my hubby dosen't care for it. I doubled the spice as suggested. I also added a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips with the nuts and rasins. I would bake this a little longer as 25 minutes wasn't quite long enough. The center was a little too gooey for my taste eventhough the tooth pick came out clean. I mixed cocoa powder in to the icing, used orange extract for flavor and milk to moisten. I kept the icing on the side. Again I thought that these were tasty but these are clearly not for everyone.

We doubled the spice and added cocoa to the orange concentrate and it turned out great!  Making again tonight.

These were pretty great!  As recommended, I doubled the amount of spice in the recipe and was pleased with the flavor it provided.    The texture was dense (like a brownie should be) and pleasant.  Thanks for a great recipe!
