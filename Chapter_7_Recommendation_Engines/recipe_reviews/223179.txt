Tried this out because I had everything handy at my house. It was a good, easy pasta but not overly flavourful. I didn't have much parmesan cheese left, but I would have added more if I had more. Overall, it was good, but would probably change the recipe a bit next time.

It is a great recipe the only thing is lacked flavor so I added in the pesto vegetable broth as I was blending it then when I was simmering the pesto I added 2 vegetable bouillon cubes and also Italian seasoning and a little pepper flakes and it gave it lots of flavor it was delicious my family enjoyed it.

I read the reviews first and made some alterations which helped the final product come out delicious, my family and I loved it. I added red pepper, black pepper, 2 chicken bouillon cubes, and Italian seasoning. Other than the bouillon cubes, I added everything to my own taste so I don’t have exact amounts. I’ll be making this again.

Need lots and lots of salt/pepper/tabasco/etc to get it to taste like anything. Maybe I'm missing something
