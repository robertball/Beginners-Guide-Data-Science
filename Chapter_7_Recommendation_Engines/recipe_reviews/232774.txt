Made this tonight as something different and it was amazing!  made them a bit smaller and since i made the meatballs smaller (about ping pong ball size) was able to get about 16 subs (with 3-4 meatballs each) out of it.  would halve the sauce as we had a few cups remaining, but will put into a spaghetti sauce.  also, only used 1/4 c of grated Parmesan with the meat mix and topped with shredded mozarella and parmesan.  people were going for seconds while i was still dishing out firsts!  fantastic!  thanks for posting!

This was a delicious recipe. I would add another half jar of marinara sauce and some provolone cheese.  Kids loved it and so did I. Great meatballs!  I will be making it again.

Made these for my family, tonight.  My wife was not a fan of the recipe when I read it, but changed her mind when she ate it.  My 12 and 15 year old boys couldn't wait for a second helping!  We used Parmesan topping on half and provolone on the other half.  Both were terrific.  Definitely making these easy sandwiches again!

What a great idea for something different on game day. I prepared these for the Nebraska/Iowa football game, 2014. We used Mr. C's locally produced spaghetti sauce, which is a sweet sauce, which we love. I'm not sure they would be as tasty with straight marinara sauce. The meatballs were rustic and delicious, though I may add more salt and pepper or other spices next time. Though delicious, with more spice they would have had more pizzazz. I did have provolone cheese available, which I put underneath the meatballs. Obviously, these sandwiches are a little messy, so we had a fork at the ready to make eating a bit easier. Make sure you purchase good bread, which makes all the difference in the world.

My absolute go-to for tailgates and large gatherings. Also, reheats like a dream and sits in a crockpot without getting soggy. When I saw that it was a "corporate sponsor" recipe, I wasn't sure, but this one is a real winner. I make this up and we have sandwiches one day and then if there are any leftovers, they go on pasta. Honestly, with three teens at home, there aren't leftovers often. At tailgates, I cook it all up and then just reheat on the grill in a stock pot. We do top the sandwiches with provolone on occasion, but we also have a family member with dairy issues. You can leave out all of the cheeses and it really doesn't affect the taste. My only warning is not to make the meatballs too big or they get hard to eat on a bun.

Really good we did cut the recipe in half as it makes quite a bit. We made our meatballs on the smaller side and served them on mini sub rolls. The meatballs had great texture and using a prepared sauce makes them super quick. Thanks for a lovely sandwich recipe.

Instead or adding more Parmesan on top I added Provolone and put them in the oven de a few minutes until bun was toasted. I also used French rolls instead and were pretty good. I think next time I'll add a little spice to the sauce to spice it up a little more.
