I made this recipe for the Allrecipes Canadian Allstars Spring Bling assignment.
I made the recipe as written except I halved it for a 9x9 pan and I omitted the topping because the pecans I had in the cupboard were MIA.
The batter was very wet, I had to add 3 tbsps more flour.
I used 2 small red delicious apples chopped finely.
Mine baked in 31 minutes.
This was like a snacking cake, very light and fluffy.
I found it a little too oily and sweet, when I make again I would halve the butter and sugars and then halve the topping and see how that works.
I lined my pan with parchment and cut into 9 pieces.
Thanks for a fast and tasty recipe!

Followed recipe. Worried it would be to mushy based on 2 reviews. Worked fine.  Was not sure how exact to measure the apple chunks.. Since I have lots of apples in need of a home, I mounded it up to to maybe 9 fluid ounces . Used 1.5% fat buttermilk most stores stock. Packed brown sugar hard in measuring cups.  Oven temp 350°F. Removed from oven at 40 minutes. Internal temp in center of cake was 205°F. Pan was glass 9" x 13".  Texture and taste both seem just right for me.  Thanks!

Didn´t look like the picture! Mine was a bit wetter rather than light and fluffy; the brown sugar seems to have sunk and formed a bit of caramelish jelly on the bottom. But the cardamom is delicious, recipe easy, overall a nice recipe. I had no butter so I subbed 1 scant stick of margarine, used walnuts and soured milk as per cook´s note. I agree it could have taken a bit more flour (or a bit less sugar), but it works the way it is. Thanks!

Love the overnight feature of this that it makes an impressive, warm breakfast cake. I did adjust the cardamom down as it was a bit heavy in taste. Changed to 1tsp cardamom and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Also, I increased the buttermilk to 1-1/2 cups (because I had some leftover and wanted to use it up). Added to the moistness of the cake.

Wish I would have added more apples.  It was ok.  Nothing great.
