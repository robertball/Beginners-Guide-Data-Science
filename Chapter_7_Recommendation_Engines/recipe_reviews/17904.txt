We made these kabobs for Memorial Day this week.  As the recipe was stated, I'm sure it would be great, which is why I'm giving it a 4 star rating.  After reading the many reviews, I decided to make a few adjustments that sounded good to me also, like the addition of shrimp, a few different vegies, and pineapple.  Had the meat marinating for about 6 hours, the vegies only about 3, but made the terrible mistake of putting the fresh pineapple in with the meat.  DO NOT DO THIS.  There was some sort of a reaction, and it must have started 'cooking' the meat while it marinated....the meat was terrible, we had to literally throw it out.  It was mushy and mealy, changed the texture entirely.  The pineapple and vegies, however, were delicious, and gone in a flash.  Luckily we had hotdogs and hamburgers to have with them.....Operator error on this one, will definitely try this again, with no pineapple in the bag while marinating!!  Do try it!

I've experimented with several kabob recipes, and this turned out to be the very best. The combination of honey and teriyaki sauce worked well. I marinated it for 8 hours, and that was sufficient (you don't need the full 24 hours to get the flavor). One suggestion is to not to place meat and vegetables on the same skewer; although it looks pretty, they have different cooking times.

Great marinade! It's so simple and tastes so good! I cut the recipe in half and used it for a little over a pound of sirloin. I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder and added a little olive oil. I poked the meat with a fork and put it into a ziploc bag and let it marinate overnight.  I never marinate meat together with veggies and always grill them separately as they cook at different rates.  Overall, very tasty.

I had to make something for a camping trip for 8 people, I marinated the ingredients in a plastic bag the night before we left and speared them at the camp site.  They were amazing.  I modified it a little bit, and used only onion, pepper, chicken pineapple and spices (and REAL ginger).  People were screaming for more.

This recipe was a huge hit at our 4th of July cookout!!  The flavor turned out delicious!!  Next time I'll marinate the veggies separately and not as long as the meat.  My mushrooms soaked up all the marinade and were too squishy to put on skewers.

This is great!  I liked it more so on the chicken than the steak, but still a thumbs up.  I added a TBSP. of roasted garlic Montreal Chicken seasoning (McCormick) to the chicken & the red pepper Montreal Steak seasoning to the steak marinades, DELICIOUS!  Thanks Sue!

Marinating the vegetables along with the steak and/or chicken makes these kabobs delicious. I highly recommend.

Excellent flavor. This was my first time making kabobs and it was so easy. The veggies stayed crisp just the way I like them and the meat was so tender and juicy too.  Lots of flavor. Thanks

I made this recipe twice.  Since it was so cold outside, I used my George Foreman Grill.  Excellent.  The next time, I baked the chicken and peppers inside foil packets in the oven.  This was just OK, the peppers got too mushy.

This is a great recipe but I'd like to suggest the skewers be soaked in water for at least an hour prior to using to help prevent them burning.

Rave reviews from my guests.  I doubled the marinade and marinaded both the veg and meat but in separated bags.  I also double skewed each kabob.  This stops the veggies from turning on the skewer and makes it much easier to grill.   I like my steak med rare so I grilled the steak on separate skewers so as not to over cook the meat.

Excellent taste super juicy outside was crispy nice grill marks inside was super tender and juicy. Veggies had great taste also. Marinated everything in 1 bag for 5hrs Would go great with unmarinated grilled pineapple.

This is so good!!  Yum!  Everyone at my Memorial Day bbq loudly voiced how good they thought they were while eating them!  I marinated the veggies separate from the meat for a total of 24 hours.  I think marinating them for a whole day helps make the flavor exceptional.  I made these exactly as stated adding pineapple to the skewers as well.

It is very rare that you find a marinade that works well with beef, chicken, and vegetables.  This one does.  I loved the fact the veggies were a bit soggy after marinading for just under 24 hrs.  It made them cook quicker, therefore being the perfect constancy when removed from the grill.  The chicken and beef cooked beautifully!  So, so, so good!  Would recommend this to anyone without hesitation.

Great kabob recipe. I would disagree with the remarks about cooking the meat separately from the vegetables. Flavors in this recipe are from the marinade as well as the mixture of the meat and the vegetables getting happy with each other.

Fantastic recipe! Marinated chicken (overnight) and veggies (about 4 hours) separately. Added fresh pineapple and zuchinni. Also used fresh ginger and garlic. Soaked my skewers for about an hour in water. The chicken was moist and very flavorful. Recieved wonderful reviews from my cookout guests. With definitely use again and again!!

These were so good, I had to order a bunch of stainless steel skewers from Amazon to make sure we always had them on hand! We make this a LOT now, because its so easy and tastes so good! I marinate veggies separate from the meat, because i don't cook them as long...just personal preference

Oh My Goodness!  These were the best kabobs I have ever had.  Don't forget the mushrooms and pineapple.  I had more veggies then meat, so I made serveral veggie skewers.  I am making them again this week.  I made them with Rainbow Pasta Salad II.  Great meal.  Even the left overs were wonderful, tender and juicy.

Made exactly as written.  Super easy & tasty.  We cooked the chicken alone on skewers and the meat with the veggies.  I preferred the chicken over the beef.  Would recommend serving with Spiced Basmati Rice from epicurious.

Excellent!  We used a blender on the marinade sauce as the honey and terioke sauce did not mix.  Also we used red, orange and yellow peppers.

These were to die for!  Mariated chicken and steak in sep bags for about 16 hours and the veggies (Onions/Squash and Red Peppers- just happened to be what I had on hand)  only about 2 hours.  Came out perfectly on the grill!!  Served it over some fried rice.  My boyfriend loved it, he was really impressed at how tender the sirloin came out- had to keep rotating the steaks to do even cooking though.. I am not a master griller!!  I will make these again come summer, when there isn't 2 inches of snow falling!!  It was fun though :)

Wonderfulful recipe! My family scarfed them up. I only marinated them for about 4 hours and it was enough, I think IF marinated the marinade might overpower the meat flavor, (although i don't know for shore) I did add shrimp also, YUM

Great! I used KC Masterpiece Honey Teriyaki Marinade (so I didn't add the extra honey) and they turned out absolutely delicious! My husband requested these at least once a week from now on. :)

My husband adored these kabobs.  I made them with red onions, yellow squash, mushrooms, and a yellow pepper.  Very good.  I also made a the teriyaki sauce from a recipe on the site, which was pretty good.  I marinated the kabobs for about 4 hours.  Surprisingly, the kabobs had absorbed a lot of the flavor in that time.  Quick, easy, and delicious--I will definately be making again.

Absolutely Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I made it exactly as shown, except I dont eat beef.  I felt like this was enough to feed 2 adults, if that's all they were eating.  I also followed another reviews recommendation and cooked the veggies on their own skewer.  It smelled so great cooking on the grill!  Thank you!!

I started marinading with 24 hrs in mind, something came up, and it turned into 48 hr soak. It was raining, cold and windy Iedidn't really want to spend any time at the grill. I put it in a skillet, and it turned out GREAT!!

I made about 45 kabobs for 7 people with bacon ranch pasta salad and garlic bread and ran out!!  I even added 3 zucchini, 2 containers of grape tomatoes, and 2 cans of pineapple to stretch out the kabob recipe.  It was SO GOOD!!

Yes, these were very very good.  I added the chicken to one marinating bag and the vegies to another marinating bag.  I also added fresh pineapples and placed these in with the vegies.  I felt the pineapples added another delicious layer of flavor.  I'm making these again this week.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

The marinade is wonderful, and the overall flavor was great. We seared ours a little so the red peppers and other veggies got a little caramelized... wasn't out of this world, but was tasty!

Fabulous!  I followed other advice and separated the meats from the veggies when marinating for 8+ hrs. This will definitely be in our usual rotation, even during the work week.  As one reviewer suggested, cut everything up and bag it in marinade in the morning.  then go to work and come home and grill.   YUMMY

This was VERY, very good!  I omitted the beef as the sauce sounded better with only chicken, and the mushrooms since my hubby doesn't like them.  I used fresh garlic and ginger (which is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5, I wasn't crazy about using garlic salt and ginger powder when the fresh stuff tastes better), doubled the marinade and halved between two ziploc bags, putting chicken in one and the veggies in the other.  Marinated overnight turning the bags whenever I went into the fridge for something, and added chunked pineapple when threading the skewers.  Outstanding, will make again and again - thanks so much for sharing!!!

YUMMY!  Great marinade, yummy veggies.  I baked this in my oven, 450 for 15 minutes or so.  I would recommend marinating for several hours or even a day or two.  The chicken was great (i used chicken and beef) but the beef was kind of tough.  Good recipe though!!

Used this recipe for Memorial Day.  Had guests over.  This is a delicious way to grill sirloin.  I had no idea that marinating the peppers and onion would be so delicious.  The veggies even kept thier "crispiness" after being marinated.  A+ to this recipe!!

This was just what I needed for a spur-of-the-moment BBQ.. minimal effort for great results. I found it helpful to skewer the beef and chicken onto separate sticks, as the beef tends to cook faster (otherwise, you'll end up with overdone beef/perfect chicken or perfect beef/salmonella chicken)

These are wonderful. I took the advice of others and didn't put the veggies in with the meat. I used red onion, red and green peppers, mushrooms and pineapple. My only mistake was that I didn't make enough.

The marinade was perfect on these and I actually marinaded everything for almost 48 hours as it was prep for camping.  Cooked great over the campfire and everyone ate it all.

SO Great!  I was very nervous because of the 1/2 c honey (that's alot!) but the marinade turned out to be lovely!  I only used tomato, onion and steak as we have some picky eaters in the family.  We didn't have any leftovers!

These were really good.  Like many other reviewers, I was not at all comfortable mixing the beef, chicken and veggies all together to marinate, so I separated them into three different bags and let them marinate all day.  I broiled these for about 15 minutes (too cold out to BBQ), turning them once in the middle of cooking time, and they were moist and flavorful.

Considering there were just a few ingredients these were fantastic.  Marinated the beef for 24 hrs. Onions and peppers for six and mushrooms for two. Use zip lock bags for quick clean up.

These were great. We did marinade overnight. Used both beef and chicken. I only marinated the veggies for 2 hours though. Hubby added veggies to his bag right off the bat and they were too soggy.

The recipe was a huge hit at my BBQ.  Easy to make and follo-through on.  I put my mushrooms in later like others recommended and it was great!  Thanks!

So good. Cut everything up the night before and let it marinate 24 hours. Made dinner time so easy! We used sirloin, green peppers & pineapple.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic.  The best by far for Pork.  I did however substitute the garlic powder for real garlic cloves...Thanks for sharing this awsome recipe, my guests thought I was "The" master chef!

This recipe was good, but not spectacular - I follwed it exactly as stated and marinated the meat and veggies for almost five hours - next time I would definitely marinate everything overnight!

Tried this recipe for a family cookout of over 20 people.  Assembling the skewers for this large crowd was quite time consuming, but worth it! Received many requests for the marinade recipe. Definitely a keeper!

I am so impressed.  I was looking for a sidedish for the kabobs we were going to make (I have a favorite marinade I use for my gyros and such) but found this.  I saw it had a high rating, and talked my husband into trying it.  I love anything with honey.  He thought it turned out a little dry, but I loved it!  So did the kids.  We will definately make these again, but hubby will take his off the grill sooner than the rest of us.

This was "meh". I marinated my chicken for 10 hours, so maybe 24 might have been better. It also stuck like crazy to my grill (honey maybe), so that was no fun to deal with. I won't be making this again.

I made this last night (after marinating for 24 hrs) and made it exactly as the recipe called for and it was DELICIOUS!!  I wish I had read ratings prior and separated the meat from the vegetables but they really didn't turn out bad but I'll do that next time..this one is a keeper!!  (only thing I might do differently is add a little salt)

Made the recipe as stated, didn't care for the peppers, just a personal preference and the marinade was good, but I would prefer more, so next time will double that.  Overall, it's pretty good.  Just a matter of what veggies/meats you like and wish to add!

Delicious and easy marinade.  I thought it tasted best with chicken, but the beef was great also.  I didn't marinade the vegetables, just grilled them with a little extra virgin olive oil.  Made this for our neighbors who loved it too!

The marinade is great! The honey really makes it tasty and allows the meat to get carmelized. Any veggie-meat combo is good...I used chicken, small sweet pepper halves, and sliced summer squash and zucchini. Great on the grill!

I would give this 5 stars if I had gone exactly by the recipe, but made a few changes.  Omitted the ginger (personal preference),and did not marinade the vegetables.  Also added pineapple juice to the chicken marinade and used pineapple chunks on the kabobs.  The onions were my personal favorite, as vidalias are in season.  Guests thought they were fantastic.  Served with new potatoes with caper sauce also found on this site.

Excellent recipe. I made the following adjustment however for our taste. Reduced honey by 1/2 but added o.j. to make up the sweetness. Added a splash of sesame oil. DO DOUBLE the recipe and save 1/2 for basting!

This was a huge hit at our last barbecue.  I'll never buy store bought kabobs again.  This was very easy and tasted great!  Thank you.

These a wonderful!! I only had 4 hours to marinade so the beef probably could have been better, but the veggies and chicken were excellent. They came off the grill perfectly glazed and slightly sticky!! I only had orange flavor honey but still turned out excellent. Oh, I did think the marinade smelled unappetizing but all's well that ends well!

It's surprising how four ingredients can make such a difference. What really impressed me (and my dinner guests) was that I only marinated them for five hours, which in my experiende is simply not long enough for beef. I can't wait to try again but this time marinating overnight. I may also add a bit of soya sauce for a bit of saltiness, but it's not really necessary.

Excellent!! Marinated meat and vegetables separately for 5 hours (mushrooms only 1 hour as recommended by another).  Kids loved these and they are PICKY!! This is definitely a keeper.

We marinated the meat for 6 hours, which was fine, and the vegetables for about 3 hours -- they were fine but could have handled longer.  Substituted minced garlic for the garlic powder.  This fed 4 adults and 4 kids with very little leftover.  Will make it again.

I marinated my chicken, beef, peppers and onions for about 9 hours and added the mushrooms for the last hour so that they would not get too mushy.  The kabobs were great although the beef was a little dry because we left them on the grill a little too long.  Next time, I will add more veggies (squash, zucchini, tomatoes, eggplant) and will watch my cooking time closely.

This is the best!  I used a homemade teriyaki sauce from this website and added the honey, ginger, & garlic powder to it.  It made the best chicken and tenderest steak.  I'm planning to try this with shrimp tomorrow.  I also wrapped each chicken piece with 1/2 slice of bacon and cooked the kabobs very slowly on the grill.  YUMMY with rice.

I was really hoping for more flavor.... it was OK, not great. I don't suggest using London Broil, because even at medium rare, the kabobs were tough.

These were great, I used yellow peppers and added grape tomatoes. I did not marinate the veggies but brushed them with olive oil and seasoned with garlic powder let them set and brushed the remaining marinade on everything before putting them in the broiler on med for about 6min each. side.

My wife and I made this together and had the kids put their own stuff on their skewer. We followed the recipe exactly except for using one red and one green bell pepper instead of two red ones and only marinated for 2 1/2 hours and it was amazing. I was a little worried the steak wouldn't get completely done when everything else was ready but it turned out perfect.

Very good marinate! I used minced garlic instead of the powder and added some zucchini. I didn't have much time so I only marinated for 2 1/2 hrs and the flavor was so good! Definitely making this again and making extra. My kids and hubby loved it and the veggies were so yummy! Oh and I only had chicken so next time I will try with some beef.

Wow!  The chicken was so juicy and held the flavors nicely.  The kabobs turned out dry though. I cooked part of the mixture in a stir fry pan and it turned out fantastic!

We liked the marinade, especially with the chicken.   I prefer to put the meats on separate skewers from the vegetables because I like to grill the veggies a little longer than the meats, and the steak takes less time than the chicken.

A very good kabob marinade and so simple. The steak and chicken were really tender and flavorful.  I marinated the meat overnight (separate bags for steak and chicken) and flavor was fantastic.  The onions and peppers I did about 2-3 hours - I'll do it a little longer next time to give it more flavor, although they were still really good.  We skipped the mushrooms since we don't eat them much and added fresh pineapple instead (skipped the marinade, just added to the skewers).  I followed the advice of others here and had the meat on separate skewers than the veggies to make cook times easier.  Great recipe, will definitely make again!

I made vegetarian kabobs, subtracting the meat and adding cherry tomatoes and zucchini slices.  I used the sauce as described in the recipe, marinated overnight, and enjoyed my guest's lavish praise.  I will make this one again soon.

Made these for the 4th of July and I let them marinate for 5 hours, everyone loved them.  The longer you marinate the better they are, 1st time I made these I only marinated for two hours they were still tasty but much better the longer you keep them soaking.

We took these to a friends house to grill and they were perfect.  I used tuna medallions and chicken, I also used real garlic instead of garlic powder.  Thanks so much!

My husband and I really enjoy this recipe! We have used it for cubed chicken, chicken breasts and stew beef, and have really enjoyed it everytime. I have tried a couple of other marinades, but they just don't live up to this one. The veggies taste great too, and after the last one we tried, my husband has requested that I stop messing around with other recipes, and stick with this one for awhile. Happy to do it!! Thanks for the recipe!

This marinade was delicious and the meat was very tender.  Next time I'll marinate the beef overnight but the flavor was wonderful!  Great recipe.

I used KC Masterpiece's Spiced Caribbean Jerk marinade, for a little heat, with cubed pork loin chops.  Skewered red peppers, onions, and meat each on separate skewers due to differing cooking times required.  (Forgot the mushrooms!)  This was very good, Sue. I'll try it with beef and with chicken in the future.   Thank you!

Eh. Frankly, the recipe would've been just as good if I'd stopped with just the teriyaki glaze I used in the recipe. This recipe will only be as good as the teriyaki sauce that's used to make it with and if the teriyaki sauce is a good quality sauce, it won't need the addition of other ingredients.

Very good! We did not have time to marinate for more than about 1.5 hrs, I forgot:) But while they were on the grill I just slathered them with more marinade. Made with just beef but will soon try with chicken. Thanks

The marinade was very good.  We especially liked it on the beef.  Tasted like beef teriyaki on a stick from a Chinese restaurant.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for my memorial day bbq and I liked the flavors a lot, however, the beef was very tough. I guess I bought the wrong type of beef to use for grilling. Very easy to make. Sauce is nice and thick. Will try it again but not on the grill.

I thought this was an average recipe, it really didn't do it for me.  The meat was tender & moist, but the veggies were the best part.  _If_ I ever make this again, I'd do it with only veggies.  The flavor of the meat was good, but it seemed to lack something, or maybe it was just too sweet.  I followed the recipe exactly and let it marinate 12 hours.

My husband and I have been looking for a good marinade for a long time, well... we've found it. We marinated our meat for 8 hours and the flavor was really great. I added 1/2 teaspoon of Ginger instead of just a pinch which I think helped. The Kabobs were even better the second day!

Excellent!  We did double the marinade and that worked out well.  My husband liked the chicken better than the beef just because we grill steak a lot, but they were both delicious!

Made this for my son's 12th Birthday dinner at his request, wanted me to make the one "with meat and peppers on a stick", so I looked for a new version and found this. 
A terrific dish, came out nice, I'd give a 4.2, but family raved so a 5 it gets. 
I cooked the beef, chicken, and vegatables on their own skewers as each require different cooking time, with chicken going first, then beef, etc. Vegatables came out best I thought. Will definitely do again.

This recipe was very good.  I did however, think the chicken ones were better than the beef.  Not much better though.  My husband loved them both. I did, as recommended by another reviewer, double the recipe for the marinade.  I served it with long grain rice baked in the oven in beef consomme.  YUM!!

Made it without changing anything with the marinade. We used beef and chicken along with grape tomatoes added along with the bell peppers, onion and mushrooms. Also used the marinade on shrimp for an appetizer. Marinated for 24 hours. HUGE hit with my husband and myself!

Pretty good.  We did steak and shrimp - both very moist and tasty.  Used fresh ginger and garlic - instead of powder.  Also, added some sesame oil.  Marinated the veggies separate from the meat, and used some of the marinade from veggies for dipping after.  Will make again.

Even though I didn't have adequate time to marinate, my family loved this recipe!! I added sausage and orange peppers, and I think it was a good ideas as other reviewers mentioned to marinate meat and veggies separately.  I added fresh garlic also.

This was a great recipe, particularly for a first time kabob maker.  I received excellent feedback from guests who had no idea I didn't know what I was doing!  I will try it again, for sure

I made this for Memorial Day weekend, had a huge barbecue, these kabobs were a hit, they were so good, so flavorful, so filling.  The only thing I did different was I added garlic salt in the marinade.  All everyone talked about was the kabobs.

I added zucchini and pineapple, and marinated the veggies and meat separately.  This tasted very strongly of Teriyaki, but that was what I expected from the marinade.  Not a typical kabob flavor, but delicious nonetheless.

This was amazing! I added some red pepper flakes for some spice and minced garlic instead of ground. Marinated protein for 8 hours and vegetables for an hour. DELICIOUS!

This was a very simple recipe with helpful directions.  I purchased veggie kabobs from my favorite grocery store and used this recipe to add the finishing touch.  This will be my keeper recipe for veggies of all kinds on the grill.

I always add a can of potatoes, they absorb the marinate easily.  Everyone loved but my vegetarian, maybe more potatoes and some squash.

Perfect week night grilling. I put everything in the fridge in the morning, got home from work and slammed it on the grill. I used beef tenderloin, because it is what I had around, it was great but I imagine that most anything you slam in the marinade will turn out well.

Very tasty. My whole family enjoyed these kabobs. We used only beef and marinated everything overnight. The flavoring from the marinade was wonderful - and the sirloin stayed moist and was very tender. I will definitely be making this again.

wow! wonderful flavor.  I was in a hurry and was only able to marinade for 30 minutes, but still turned out awesome! I think that this may be our new favorite marinade for steak.
