This was a tasty recipe. I used a tri color quinoa and doubled the carrot and spinach... think it could have used more. I added a little spice to mine with Sriracha. Worked great by itself and as a burrito filling

Altered this recipe a bit to fit what we had at the house. Browned about a pound and a half of ground turkey, and set aside. I then sautéed an onion in some coconut oil, added an entire box of herb & garlic Near East quinoa & pilaf, the amount of water the box called for, the seasoning mix included with the quinoa/pilaf mixture, pepper, and cooked according to the directions in this recipe. I then added two tomatoes cut into chunks and a thawed box of frozen spinach. After cooking for a few minutes, I added the ground turkey and a can of seasoned black beans that I did not drain or rinse. After all the liquid was absorbed, dinner was served. My husband, daughter, and unborn child all absolutely loved it!

Delicious and easy to make. I sautéed garlic in with the onion, doubled the veggies and added chopped cilantro. I also cooked in a splash of Chalula. We will make again!!

Very yummy!  I also added  more spinach and also  put in mushrooms and a can of diced tomatoes.    It needed more salt in my opinion and we also added some  Tapaito sauce to spice it up.   Definitely a keeper.

This dish was delicious!  My whole family loved it. I didn't have a tomato so substituted with a can of diced tomatoes.  I was confused about the addition of the bouillon so just used 1 cube of a chicken bouillon and it was perfect.  Added a little mozzie for my kids, who ate 2 & 3 servings each...with no complaints!

I used freekeh instead of quinoa. Also, I used chickpeas instead of black beans. The recipe is very delicious. I was looking for a recipe that incorporated a grain like quinoa and ground meat, such as turkey.

Yum!!! This was SO delicious, and I’m not usually one to gravitate towards healthy quinoa dishes. I did substitute fresh tomatoes for canned tomatoes (just because I’ve always found cooking fresh tomatoes to be fickle). I did drain both the canned beans and tomatoes, but added both juices to taste at the last step. Definitely will be adding to my favorites!

Instead of using bouillon, I used Pacific turkey bone broth vs water which is healthier and has less sodium.  I doubled the spinach and carrots, grating them instead of slicing.  I had no fresh tomato, so I used a half of a can of organic diced tomato. I used a local farmer’s ground pork, because I had no ground turkey on hand.  It was delicious, but I am sure turkey would have been too.  I was super excited, because my celiac daughter’s specialist wants her to eat less rice and more quinoa, but I didn’t have any good recipes.  This is a keeper.

This has so much flavor!  I added 1 teaspoon garam masala with the quinoa mix at the stage with other spices because someone else mentioned it was in the ingredients but I didn’t see it on the list.  If you like flavor without hot and spicy this is it.  So yummy!

This dish was delicious. I was out of garam masala so I used regular curry. The recipe goes a long way, it was my main dish for a party of 4 so I doubled the recipe just to be safe. No need to do that as I had plenty of left overs. Definitely will make this again!

Wonderful healthy meal.  very good and filling.  I omitted all oil and beans.   Used Minute boxed quinoa and brown rice.  browned quinoa for about 1 min.  I added few dashes of hamburger seasoning, onion powder and garlic powder to ground turkey when I cooked it.  Added more carrots and a tsp diced garlic to quinoa.  Will definitely be making again.

I really liked this dish.  I made it as written except I used chicken broth in place of the water and used taco seasoning instead of thyme.   I also added sriracha to my own bowl to spice it up.  I agree with another reviewer that this would make a fantastic filling for burritos!

Really tasty! I was able to use up a lot of produce I had in my fridge! I used extra carrots and spinach and I used 1 cup water and 1 cup chicken broth for the quinoa.

I added garlic and a diced pepper while browning the turkey. I added the spinach and tomato to the turkey mixture which I found easier. Next time I will double the spinach and tomato since they seemed to be lost in the mixture. Overall we enjoyed very much

PHENOMENAL!!   This is my first review on Allrecipes.  I've made many recipes from this site, but this one made me want to log on and leave a review.   ~   I was looking for a healthy recipe that called for ground turkey.  I read all the reviews first (which is always helpful) and made a couple of tweaks.  The only changes I made were to cook half of the onion with the quinoa and the other half with the turkey.  I also seasoned the turkey with salt, pepper and a little Cholula for a kick.  Then I doubled the veggies and just used a dash of thyme because the other reviewers suggested to do so.  This recipe is AMAZING!!!  My husband said it needs to be in our weekly rotation.  That says it all!!!!!

This was ok. I may make this again at some point but would increase vegetables and other seasonings.  This is a good recipe for tweaking to personal tastes and what you have on hand.

A little bland, but we liked it with some ketchup or siracha mayo.  Healthy & hardy though.

Toasted means don't cook the quinoa yet. So I messed that up and ended up doing 2 cups, double carrots and kale not spinach. Had to add tomato paste and more seasoning but still really great. Will make again...just the right time next time.

Super easy to make and very delicious! My husband and I don't like beans so I substituted the black beans with chick peas instead. Very flavorful and filling! What's great about this dish is that you can serve it up as the main course or on top of some mixed greens. I will definitely be making this again!

I loved this recipe except next time I would skip adding the dried thyme.   It over powered the taste.

I just didn't find that the flavors worked well with each other. It was odd adding spinach and carrots to a recipe that also calls for quinoa, tomatoes, and black beans. Even with the large amount of thyme, I had to add some additional spices (aka 3oz chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and several tbsp of Sriracha). Just didn't work for me.

Fantastic, easy and very tasty one dish meal. I halved the thyme, replaced the tomato with 1/2 a can of Rotel,  double the carrot and sauteed a couple of cloves of garlic with the turkey. Salt to taste. Served with ears of corn. Everyone really enjoyed it. Will make it again.

Thought this was delicious, simple & filling! Great recipe! Thanks for sharing with us. I seasoned the turkey meat with garlic salt & a little bit of regular Himalayan salt, and tasted great all together

This was tasty and easy.  I would add more carrot next time. But  otherwise, I liked the recipe as-is!

Way too much thyme. It is the only thing I can taste in the dish. I would cut it in half. I added some plain Greek yogurt after a friend suggested it. This made it much more edible! I still would cut the thyme though!

We both really enjoyed this recipe although when I first made it, it seemed dry so we added some salsa.   I thought it was even better reheated the next day.   Will make again for sure.

The flavor is absolutely delicious. I added 4 small carrots and tripled the spinach because I like my veggies. Will definitely make again.

I loved this! I didn't put turkey in it, because I didn't have any. I made a big batch on Sunday and used it for lunches all week. It's good hot or cold!
