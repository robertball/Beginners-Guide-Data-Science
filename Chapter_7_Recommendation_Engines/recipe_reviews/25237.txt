Nice change from regular carrots - I used a steam in bag and then just added the rest of the ingredients.  I only used 2 Tbsp. of light butter and a splash of lemon juice.  These turned out to be very sweet.

Used a couple of grates of fresh gingerroot instead of powder and a couple of grates of lemon rind in addition to lemon juice and it was delicious. I served it with fresh fish and it was light enough & flavorful (a tough combination to find for carrots). Husband and 7 year old liked it.

Very easy and a nice flavor.  I cook the carrots longer to get the flavors mingle.  It takes even better the next day reheated!

These were so delicious and easy!  I steamed the carrots first, and then added them to a pan to warm the remaining ingredients. I also used about a 1/2 tsp. ginger.

OK recipe.  Made it exactly per directions.  Next time I'll add MUCH more ginger and 1/3 the lemon, with somewhat less butter; original amount of butter added a too-greasy character, I thought.  2nd time I forgot about this note, and it was fine as specified, but with more ginger,  and better than the orange juice ginger nutmeg recipe for carrots, which I made at the same time (large group of guests).  I liked the specified amount of lemon!  Tastes change.

Great taste,I used peanut oil and stir-fried the carrots with fresh ginger. The added the honey and lemon juice and continued to stir-fry until the sauce was thickened. What a treat. Thanks Linda. iota

These carrots were a very tasty side dish. I sliced my carrots rather thin, as some other reviewers suggested. I also added extra ginger, and used a little less butter. They turned out very tender and almost melted in my mouth! Next time I make it, I will add extra carrots, because I ended up throwing away a lot of extra sauce!

I doubled the ginger to give it a little extra taste. Make sure the carrots are cut thinly. We had thought ours were, but the cooking time took longer than we thought. The carrots were even better the next day, when I ate them cold for lunch.

These were just OK.  The lemon taste was too strong for my liking, and I could hardly taste the ginger (I used 1/8 tsp).  Might be better with less lemon juice and more ginger.

awesome! go ahead and put a solid teaspoon of ginger - this was a great change to the normal buttered carrots I've served in the past.

Very tasty but after sampling from the pan I had to modify a teeny bit before serving.  More ginger, lots more, probably a teaspoon.  I really like ginger.  More honey, probably 1/4 to 1/3 cup total which makes the sauce sweeter and thicker.  
Even so, I'm really glad you shared this recipe.  It's simple and delicious and easy to personalize. Thanks for sharing.

Love, love, love 'em!!! Super sweet and yummy! Perfect for holiday side dishes or for picking little tikes who won't eat their veggies! Try steaming your carrots instead of boiling to keep all the nutrients intact!

Great for carrots, gives them some additional flavor for those who do not think they like carrots.  I have been making carrots like this for years, I just didn't know it was a recipe(LOL) because I was just thowing something together to get kids to eat carrots.  I especially like it when reviewers state the amount of the ingrediates they add.  It is so helpful when others want to try it also.  Thanks to all who share.

As other reviewers said, this doesn't need nearly as much butter or lemon juice as called for. I used about 1 tsp. lemon juice and a little less than 1/4 c. butter. Turned out delicious. Ginger flavor is very light, but that's how I like it. You want more ginger flavor, add more spice or use fresh grated.

I normally love tender crisp carrots, sweet, plain or with butter...these just didn't wow me. I guess I expected a better flavor from all the reviews. They were just a step above plain steamed carrots.  The glaze wasn't a glaze at all.

This was so delicious! I added extra ingredients; 1 tsp curry powder, about a pinch of cayenne pepper, diced garlic clove, sea salt and crushed peppercorn. I added more ginger and honey than the recipe required by adding about 1 tsp of ginger and 4 tbsp of honey. These carrots are awesome! Thanks for the wonderful recipe and thanks to the people who left comments sharing their recommendations. :)

These are so yummy and something that I would have never come up with on my own. They are still simmering but I couldn't keep my finers out of the pan! I used a 3lb bag of carrots, 1/4 cup of butter, 5tbl honey, 1tsp ginger, and 1tbl lemon juice. I almost don't want to share with my family for Thanksgiving tomorrow!

This is a really nice recipe for carrots.  I used fresh minced ginger.  I think that the combination of honey, butter, ginger, and lemon is a really nice mix on the flavor palate.  My boyfriend ate all the carrots on his plate and I don't even think he's that great a fan of carrots.

Very nice way to prepare carrots.  I followed recipe exactly, however, I did have some pumpkin pie spice left over from Thanksgiving that I added to the mix.  It is just a mixture of ginger, cinnamon, and cloves.  Added a nice sweet flavor to the carrots.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed other reviewers advice and used a bag of baby carrots.  I steamed the carrots rather than boiling.  These were just okay.  Too much acid.

I was expecting the honey/butter/lemon juice/ginger to thicken a bit more and was left with a runny mess. The recipe tasted great, just disappointed a bit is all.

I just got done making these and they are very good. I had to use canned carrots because the store was out of fresh carrots. I almost waited to make them because i didnt want to use the canned ones but it turned out really good. cant wait to make them with the real thing, lol.

carrots to not have to go into water first, they can be brought to sweating with the little bit of butter and lemon juice, my grandson loves them and i always make them that way, no water......

Excellent and easy recipe.  I made it just like the recipe said, only I used baby cut carrots straight out of the bag.  My kids, who don't usually like cooked carrots, loved them and so did my husband.  Super Easy! (I also used less than 1/2 the amount of butter, and we didn't miss it at all).

I'm not a huge fan of cooked carrots, but I loved these! I doubled the carrots (sliced thinly!) and steamed them in the microwave. I heated olive oil and honey (2 Tbspn only) in a skillet, added the carrots and then added almost a heaping teaspoon of freshly ground ginger as well as about 1/4 teaspoon ground and only 1 Tbspn lemon juice. Sauteed, served warm - loved the texture of the carrots (not too crunchy, not too soft) and the very present but not too strong flavor of ginger.

Great recipe!  Even my husband enjoyed them (and he doesn't eat cooked carrots!)  I cooked them a little longer to ensure they were cooked through, and would probably have the carrots sit in the sauce longer - to work flavors through.  Will make this one again!!

Very tasty side dish I keep coming back to! One thing I omit though is the lemon juice and I add sesame seeds for extra texture and flavour. Thanks for sharing!

These are good, nothing to write home about though.  I let the carrots cook in the glaze for quite awhile yet, I still found it hard to find the honey or ginger flavor in these.

GREAT CARROTS! I cut four chunks of ginger root and boiled it with the carrots.  Lastly, I added grated ginger root instead of ground ginger. My entire family enjoyed these carrots.

It was okay, but I wished there was a bit more flavor pop with these.  I added more ginger and still thought these were kinda bland, so I then added orange juice and was okay with these.  I probably won't make this again.

These are tasty.  I double or triple the amount of ginger for extra spiciness.  Used baby carrots, but they were still hard after 5 minutes of boiling.  I had to boil for closer to 8 minutes, and then allowed them to cook with the butter and honey for another 3-4 minutes.  The extra cooking time leaves them just soft enough, but still slightly crunchy.  I served these with Hawaiian Chicken and Teriyaki rice.  They lend themselves well to Asian meals.

I started he recipe exactly as written except for cutting down to 4 servings.   I added more ginger still to much honey.  I had to cut the honey or wash them or something.  I heated up the pan and hit it with white wine.  Simmer for a moment of course all the fixing they were not as firm as I like but my husband was able to eat three after the changes.  I thought they were ok after changes.  I gave a two because the recipe had to have changes after I give 3.5.

I made these tonight to go to a pot luck dinner.  I had to triple the recipe and everything was easy and was delicious!  I did steam the carrots to save some time and I added 2 full teaspoons of ginger.  The flavor was perfect and a nice change from regular glazed carrots.

I used good ol' Canadian maple syrup in lieu of the honey (it is sweeter than honey so I didn't use the same measurement as for the honey). I increased the ginger to 1/8 tsp. We really, really enjoyed thses carrots. Yummy! Will be using this often.

Quick and easy answer to plain carrots! Suggest throwing in a little plain old parmesan cheese, like the kind you put on pizza, adds a little something else but is awesome without it. ENJOY!

Wonderful flavor.  I used whole baby carrots and about 1/2 TBS lemon because I only had ReaLemon, which I don't really like.  I will use a fresh lemon and try using more.  Fantastic flavor that even the teenager loved.

Since we don't like lemon juice to overpower things I reduced the amount of lemon juice & we'd still give this a 3 as is.  I will make again because hubby likes the sweetness of the honey with the carrots.  Next time I will try 1/4 tsp ginger because I couldn't taste it before & try only 1/2 tsp lemon juice.

I made these carrots tonight and they were good.  I normally do not bother with carrots, unless I am making a carrot cake, lol, but I’m trying to incorporate more veggie with my meals.  I will make this dish again, but will use fresh ginger as other reviewers suggusted.   Thanks.

This is similar to a dish my friend's mom used to make. It's the only way my husband will eat cooked carrots! Her recipe uses more ginger and no lemon. You put the sliced carrots right into a frying pan and cover them with just enough water to cover, then put the butter right on top and drizzle them with honey and a few dashes of ground ginger. You cover the pan until the carrots get a little soft, then uncover them so the water evaporates, stirring to distribute the butter, honey, and ginger. Let them caramelize a bit, and they're fantastic!

Very nice! I made this for Thanksgiving last year and it was a big hit.  I used fresh ginger instead of powder and added  1 tbl sp of orange juice

These were easy to put together and did not take a lot of time.  Had a very nice flavor, just enough sweet without being over powering.  Very good.

Good vegetable side dish. I steamed the carrots in a steamer for 5 minutes instead of boiling them and they were perfectly tender. I think next time I'll add some more lemon juice.

These weren't too bad. I followed everyone's suggestion on the ginger by using 1tsp. The rest of the ingredients I left the same. The amount of carrots to the sauce was great. I did steam my carrots in the microwave using one of the ziplock steam bags and that was great. I like the softer carrots and I was pressed for time so that is why I steamed. Other then that pretty good.

I gave this recipe only 4 stars because although I loved the flavor of the honey/ginger sauce, it was a bit thin.  So I added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up and a dash of vanilla to give it some more flavor.

I do not know how to cook, and this recipe was easy to make and delicious. Of course I had no honey or lemon, but I used maple syrup instead of honey ( no lemon) and I baked the carrots in a cast iron skillet instead of cooking them on the eye. I ate all of it in one night

made these last night. my hubby liked them, and they were easy to prepare. about 7 minutes got the texture just right; firm but not squishy. I think the sauce needed a bit more of something, though not sure what.

Wonderful. I used fresh ginger to taste and fresh lemon juice and grated lemon rind. I just kept tasting until it was perfect. This is a keeper, used fresh carrots from my garden and plan on making again for Thanksgiving.

This was a pretty good recipe.  The ginger, honey, and lemon juice provide a good flavor.  I added extra honey and a little extra lemon juice while the carrots were cooking.

Fantastic. The flavors are more pronounced if you use fresh ginger or the minced ginger you can find in glass jars in your grocery store.

Everyone enjoyed these at Christmas dinner. I reduced the lemon juice and added another teaspoon of ginger. Hubby enjoyed it, and he doesn't care for cooked carrots. My toddler and preschooler devoured them!

I loved these carrots! I didn't have dried ginger so used about a Tablespoon of fresh chopped ginger and sautéed that along with 3 minced garlic cloves in the butter before adding in the carrots. I found that the juice from half a small lemon was the perfect amount and then I sprinkled over some chopped fresh parsley just before serving. Some of the most flavourful carrots I've had. Thanks for the recipe, Linda!

Pretty good!  I used baby carrots, and steamed them in a steamer basket, then stirred in the sauce.  I did not use lemon juice, and probably used about a quarter teaspoon of ground ginger.  I made them for Thanksgiving this year (actually typing this review while we do the dishes!)

My kids ate these carrots which speaks volumes!  I thought they were very good and enjoy the flavor.  Very nice paired with chicken or fish.  They are going to become a regular in our menu at home.  Thanks for sharing!

These were okay.  But, like someone else has said, there's a strong lemon taste.  I will probably make again, but with more honey and ginger and less lemon juice.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it's honestly the best recipe i've tasted for carrots! I usually really don't like cooked carrots but i loved these! I didn't use as much butter as suggested and they still turned out wonderful. I'll be using this recipe a lot!

I don't know what happened but they turned out all watery and not sweet at all. I've had much better.

Yummy!  I followed the recipe as is, except for the ginger: added about a Tbsp of fresh minced ginger - will do the same next time.

I made this for a large group of people (around 20) and everyone loved it! It was easy to make. The only thing I did different was add a little more honey and a little less ginger.

Awesome!!  I am not a big fan of sweet carrots but I made them for my family sedar and my husnabdns easter dinner.  Both times they were a hit.  I even loved them.  They melt in your mouth and are not too sweet.  THis one will be a keeper for family meals.

Yummy! My 2 year old wouldn't even attempt which is no suprise as she is a strict bread and cheese kind of girl but my husband and I loved em! I also used less lemon juice and used baby carrots (very easy.) I boiled them for about half an hour (make sure water doesnt boil out.) I'll be putting this on our families plates again and again.

We thought these were wonderful! I did add a teaspoon of ginger but that's because we really enjoy the flavor. It's nice to find another way to get in a vegetable at dinner.

I steamed my carrots to preserve the nutrition value. Then added them to the sauce. These were delicious - not overly sweet, with a mild ginger taste - EXCELLENT!

This was pretty tasty. I used fresh ginger and also added a splash of orange juice b/c they were lacking the zing I was hoping for, after that they tasted like what I was looking for. Thanks! : )

As is, I have to give this recipe only 3 stars. Here's how I changed it into a five star recipe:
Reduced butter to 3 tbsp.
Reduced honey to 1 1/2 tbsp.
Reduced lemon juice to 1/2 tsp.
Increased ginger to 1/2 tsp.

Even with reducing the honey, it's flavor far overshadowed the ginger. Next time I might reduce the honey even further. But a great recipe to build on. Glad I tried it.

These were really good, but I did make a few changes.  Halved the lemon juice and doubled the ginger, and I found 5 minutes of boiling the carrots wasn't nearly long enough.  I let the carrots cook for 8 minutes in the water, and then another 5 in the pan with the butter.  Really easy, I'll be making these again.

These carrots were very good. They had a refreshing sweetness to them. The kids ate them with no funny faces or sounds LOL. My husband gave the recipe 5 stars. The kids gave it 3 stars which, for a vegetable, is a fantastic rating from my kids. I gave the recipe 4 stars. The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to use fresh ginger in place of the ground ginger. I will be making this again. Thank you, Linda, for the recipe.

This recipe is terrific--just the right amount of glaze and very nice complement to the carrots. I subbed cardamom for the ginger and didn't have lemon juice, so I splashed in some balsamic vinegar; used a little less butter. Loved it!

Very Good. I loved the carrots with a touch of honey and butter. It was a great combo with the Garlic Cheddar Chicken.  My son, who is picky with veggies, had 2 servings.  Will make this again!

These were so sweet we couldn't eat the side portions we had for dinner.  I'm giving it a generous two stars because it is possible that the honey I used was too strong, but I won't be making these again.  We like the "Maple Dill Carrots" much better.

Was afraid these would be heavy-sweet, but they had a delicate sweetness that brought out the flavor of the carrots.  Used frozen carrots with 1 T. less butter and a couple swipes of fresh ginger.  Added a little salt at serving time which gave them a nice sweet-salty taste that I like. A good blend of flavors, happy with this recipe.

This is a good recipe, but I would add maybe another tablespoon of lemon juice and then add a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar to make a syrup.  The glaze in this recipe turned out very thin (even after reduction) and the carrots had only a mild honey-lemon-ginger flavor.  If you like   ginger, add more than a pinch.  I did and it was good. I'll add more next time.

I used fresh grated ginger instead of dried, other than that I stuck to the recipe.  It was FANTASTIC.  A great way to make carrots.  Much more interesting than "steamed and buttered" vegetables.  Will use again and again!

These were great.  I didn't have any lemon and they still tasted fantastic - I added extra ginger, but maybe wouldn't add quite as much next time and would use fresh ginger.  The sauce turned syrupy and was great.

Very fresh and delicious tasting.  I used some lemon zest instead of the juice.  Will definitely make again.

Mmmmm... these were much better than your normal cooked carrots, and really easy to make! The only change I would suggest is adding more ginger. Still, really good recipe for making a not-that-great food taste good.

These where very good.  I used fresh ginger.  The sauce was to thin so I added a little bit of corn starch.

Yummy dish, although, (as others have mentioned) you need about half tblsp lemon juice, about half teaspoon of ginger,  and about 4 tablespoons of honey.   Also I added 2 sprigs of  chopped fresh coriander just before serving  .

I steamed the carrots, added lemon zest and used freshly grated ginger. Other than that I follwed the recipe. First dish I ever made that did NOT need salt or pepper. Smelled and tasted amazing. May make this a weekly treat! Thanks.!!!!

Not great.  Maybe fresh ginger would be better.  Next time, I will try an orange carrot recipe. My family ate the carrots without comment, which translates to so-so.  They were pretty.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were great! I forgot to add the lemon, so I'm sure that would have changed up the taste some. I also grated fresh ginger since I had some on hand. I'm not a huge fan of carrots, so any way I can make them tasty gets a thumbs up!

I made the recipe as written for Easter last year and greatly enjoyed it. The sweetness of the honey and the bite of the ginger work together perfectly.

Very good flavor. Made these for thanksgiving to try something different. They were a hit. Only thing that I would change is the amount of butter. Next time I will cut back to probably half of the butter. I made three pounds of carrots and just doubling the butter was a little too much. Would definately add a  little more ginger as well. But no complaints with the original recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I followed this recipe tightly. It did not have much of a hint of ginger. Maybe my powdered ginger had lost it strength. Even when i added 2 Tbs. It lacked the fire that ginger promises. In addition, the honey gave a rank aroma when it was heated. I was using organic honey. In the end, it was a nice change from the average glazed carrot.  I will definitely make this again. Only, I will be working with fresh ginger and lemon.

I call these 'dessert carrots' because they are sweet.  The ginger surprises the tastebuds.  I use 1/4 teaspoon ginger, because I like the flavor.  Don't be afraid to play around with the amount of ginger.

Like other reviewers suggested I used 1 tsp ginger and 1 tsp of lemon juice. Also added a dash of Kosher salt and a dash of freshly ground pepper, just lightly so ginger was still dominate. Refreshing taste and nice change from the other carrot recipes.

This was pretty good.  My 14 month old loved them!  I used a tad more ginger and honey and a little less lemon juice.  We like the carrots softer, so we cooked them a little longer too.  This is a keeper recipe.

My husband only eats peas and green beans, so after 6 years I’ve decided we have to branch out. I found this recipe and we both loved it (impressive because I hate carrots). I used baby carrots and just sliced the really thick ones in half. I also let them simmer for about 5 more minutes on the stove and was grateful I did since they were still very crispy but good. Increase ginger to at least 1t. Otherwise they only taste like honey. Very good, will make again.

Very Tasty - Will make over and over again!  However, I did cook longer than the recipe calls for.  Next time I will use a tad less butter and a tad more ginger.  Thanks!

This was a great idea.  I had to modify it though because I thought I had ginger but didn't so I had to improvise with freshly ground nutmeg.  It worked and my three year old who hates carrots ate three and said they tasted good, that's a huge compliment coming from him!  I served them with BBQ ribs and my husband thought the flavor of the sweet carrots clashed with the ribs.  I'll try them with something different next time.

For a carrot dish, this is definately a 5 star.  Yum!  All the flavors melded together to make a delicious sauce, not to sweet, not to "gingery", not to lemon flavored.  Just delectable!

Served these for Easter dinner and everyone loved the new twist on carrots. I used 1/2  tablespoon of freshly grated ginger. Used baby carrots and cooked for 7 minutes.

I made these for a pot-luck Thanksgiving dinner. I used the pre-cut carrot medalions from the grocery store. For some reason these took FOREVER to get soft. I will slice my own carrots next time or use baby cut carrots.

Fabulous. Added cane sugar instead of honey bc that's what I had on hand. Also used about 1 teaspoon fresh ginger and no powdered. Will definitely make again. The lemon, sugar, and ginger are a great combination to add to the carrots.

This was really great, I didn't have any brown sugar so I subbed 1/4 cup of real maple syrup instead and added some fresh ginger.

Good stuff! (from someone who hates carrots)

Ehh... Couldn't taste the ginger & I grated fresh ginger into the pan along with the ground ginger. Honey & Lemon are just too overpowering for a subtle flavor like ginger. Wished it worked because it sounded yummy.

I love this recipe because it took a few minutes to make, but tasted absolutely fabulous.  Perfect over calrose rice with a touch of low sodium soy sauce!

Very yummy comfort food! Made it for 1 and used 3 carrots, a pinch of fresh grated ginger, red pepper flakes, and T spray butter. My carrots weren't huge so I didn't have a problem with cook time once cut into rounds Thanks!

The flavor was very good! I added some pepper for kick.  They took a lot longer to cook, but I like really tender veggies.

Not that bad, but not that good either.  I added extra ginger but it still wasn't enough to make these really stand out.  I prefer plain steamed carrots.  (I did steam these first instead of boiling them, which leaves more of the nutrients intact).

A keeper. I've made this countless times... each time tweaking it a bit here and there (less sweet etc).  It goes well with savory main courses.

This was a good recipe, but it didn't glaze up very well. It ended up a bit runny, but the flavor was good. Maybe adding a bit of cornstarch would help.

As suggested this was a four, but to upgrade it to a FIVE I cooked it al dente, then reduced the sauce ingredients down to a light syrup. The taste was EXCELLENT!!! One caveat: halve the butter. It left a heavy patina cold. Artery Alert! Thanx Linda

These carrots were DECLIOUS!  Even my husband who is not so crazy about carrots loved them!  They were very easy to make too.  Will be making these again and again at my husband request.

This wasn't as punchy as I would have like. I added a 1/2 tsp. of ginger, but I should try a whole teaspoon as another review suggested. They were good, though.

Got rave reviews from everyone -- the sauce adds great flavor to a vegetable that no one in my family really wants to eat.  And I love how easy it was to make!

This dish went over wonderfully at Thanksgiving with my boyfriend and his mother.  With some careful ingredient selection, it fit requirements of low carb and organic food!
