I have made this every Saturday for several years now. My recipe has evolved as I no longer look it up anymore. Try 3 cups flour and one cup rye flour. Also, pour extra virgin olive oil in measuring cup before adding the water to the one cup line. Hope this helps.

Excellent recipe! I made this pizza dough three times this week-end. I put all of the ingredients in my bread maker and it turned out perfect. The first time I made it I used all of the dough and it made a nice thick crust. The next two times I made it I divided the dough in half and made two thin crust pizzas. Thank you for sharing!

Absolutely perfect! A pizza crust with flavor without having to add tons of herbs or salt. Rye... Why haven't I thought of it before? I will say I let it rise longer than called for, maybe two hours, and it was almost a deep dish. It got huge on my pizza stone! But that's ok with me, we love the crust.

This is an easy to make and delicious pizza crust. I tried it with a simple topping of mozzarella, sliced cherry tomatoes and Italian herbs drizzled with a little garlic olive oil. This week, I am making a Reuben pizza with the crust and I have no doubt that it will be a hit. Thanks for a rye crust recipe that isn't dry and just delicious.

Not sure what I did, but I had to add at least another cup of flour to get it off the dough hook.  3 1/2 + 1 cups flour (?).  Too much water I guess.  Anyway the dough rolled out a family sized pizza which I used with a white sauce.  The crust rose nicely and had a great texture and flavor.  For 2 people, there are leftovers too.  No problem for me.  Great recipe, Doug.

Doug...This was a great pizza dough...I loved the hint of rye in the final product. This dough recipe made for me two loaves; I immediately made one and refrigerated the second loaf for the next night. There are a few suggestions I'd like to share with readers: 1) Be sure to have a thermometer! It is critical to check the temperature of the water in both steps...You want the water to be NO MORE than 110 degrees F. If it gets any hotter, the yeast will get killed! 2) If one has a pizza stone, then set it inside the oven on the lowest rack setting while it is preheating (I set my oven for 475 degrees). Having a stone prevents soggy bottom pizza dough. If one doesn't have a stone, one can invert a sheet pan on the lowest rack setting. 3) After shaping/rolling out the dough, move the dough onto a peel or wooden board that has been generously dusted with both cornmeal and flour. This prevents the dough from sticking when it is time to slide the pizza onto the stone/inverted pan in the very hot oven. My first pizza (I made a Margherita) took 11 minutes to cook; my second pizza (still a Margherita) took 14 minutes to cook (because it was slightly chilled from cooling in the refrigerator overnight - I did take it out to come down to room temp but it's cold now (winter)). Just watch it through the oven door until it's how you like it - try not to open the oven door while it is cooking. Absolutely wonderful tasting pizza dough! Thanks, Doug:)

Made this dough  for a Stromboli. Holy moly is it the bomb!! Thanks for the great recipe:). I made it the way I make my bread... all the dry ingredients in the bowl,add all the water, mix for about 2 min. on low speed. Then let it sit covered for about 15 min . After that I put on medium speed and add flour as needed ,mix for about 7-10 min.more. When the dough holds together and starts hitting the side of mixer bowl it's done. Let sit in oiled bowl for 1 1/2 hours covered.  Very easy to roll out. Will make again.
