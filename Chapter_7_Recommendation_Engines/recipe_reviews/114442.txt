Excellent recipe.  A tip for those who want to eliminate the "wild game" taste as much as possible is to soak the duck breasts in salted ice water for about an hour before using.  I suggest about a Tablespoon of salt per quart.  Make sure to use ice water as it will draw out blood.  Then rinse the breasts thoroughly and quickly pat dry with paper towel before adding to the marinade.  This recipe is a keeper!

The best tip I can give when cooking any duck breasts is do NOT overcook. Cooking on grill is best. Breast should be medium to medium rare. Allow meat to rest 10 mins before cutting.   If you overcook- it will give a more wild taste. We eat a variety of game meat all the time. This is the best tip someone should use.

I cook on a grill as hot as I can get it (500+) for a very short time dpending on the size of the duck breast.  there is no substitute for a meat thermometer when you cook game birds.  The grilled duck breast should be cooked to 130 degrees F and then removed from the grill to keep it from tasting gamey.  It will look very red when cut and should run pinkish juice.  You do not have to soak it in brine.  I do half my ducks with this recipe and the other half using Soy instead of Worcestichire sauce.  The rule with wild duck is to not overcook it.

This was the first time for duck breast for us, so we thought we'd try an easy marinade.  The flavor of the marinade was fine, but our meat still had a little "wild" flavor.  Next time, we will soak it a little in brine before we marinate.  We also grilled this for about 10-12 minutes on each side and as you can see in the picture, it still came out medium rare.  I guess duck is an extremely bloody meat.  Thanks for the recipe, RKC.  I will try this marinade again.

Awesome recipe!  Like other readers, we put the duck in a bath of ice water & salt and that definitely made the duck not gamey at all.  This recipe was so great we made it two nights in a row.  Thanks for sharing. :)

Best goose marinade I've ever tried. My wife and kids will now enjoy my ducks with me during duck season. Makes mallard and pintails even better and will make divers and even coots delicious to eat. A must tried for all duck hunters!

Amazing!! My husband and I hated duck before this recipe.  My daughter (8yr.) loved it as well.  We were all fighting over it at the dinner table. I did soak it in ice salt water for an hour, so I don't know if that helped with eliminating the game taste. Thanks!

Absolutely fantastic! We only had time to marinade for about 25 minutes. I cut our bacon slices in half, wrapped each half breast with the bacon. We shot one Goldeneye (crappy bird) and one hen wood duck (very tasty bird). I wrapped the Goldeneye with jalepeno slices along with bacon. I wrapped the Wood Duck with bacon only. Fried both bird breats. My father who has been hunting for 45 plus years thought the jalepeno was the Wood Duck. I can't imagine how good it would have been if I would have marinated it for 24 hours. Will do this over and over again. Great appetizer!!!

My husband has recently taken up duck hunting & I've never liked duck before. The way my mom fixed it it always tasted like a mixture of rotting fish & mud.  This recipe worked very well to eliminate that taste and I can actually say I enjoy duck now. Even my picky 4 year old liked it.  I did do the salty ice water soak suggested in some of the comments.

Thank you for this recipe! My boyfriends dad gave us a bunch of wild duck breasts and I had NO idea how to cook it. We marinated it overnight and cooked it on the barbeque the next day. Delicious!

It's an excellent and simple way to cook small and large duck breast. Takes away any hint of what some folks think is a liver flavor. My wife loves it and she has to be converted due to beibg a city girl.

With a bock beer, and rice, this makes a fantastic dinner. Two large  duck (mallard, gadwall, etc...)  breasts a piece is plenty. You will feel like you had a light and not overpowering meal. The sauce and garlic are just right.     we had it with woody's too which are known to be more livery. Just as good. Dont cook too long. You want duck to be medium rare. It's a red meal like tenderloin. We have added it to our normal rotation of meals - during duck season. 
Cheers!

Well, I guess duck meat isn't for me. I overcooked a little bit which I know is a big no no but neither hubby or I can stomach the look of rare meat so I didn't have much of a choice. With that in mind, I think this is an excellent recipe for those that don't mind the blood. The marinade is very flavorful and seemed to really tenderize the meat. If I get any more wild duck, I will try this again and soak it in the salt water like other reviewers mentioned.

Excellent! I soaked the breasts in an ice water with salt for an hour and a half and used more worcestershire sauce and the duck tasted great! I will use this recipe again!

We used this marinade for both duck and pheasant that we fondued with a group of friends; it was delicous. We served the duck with mint jelly. We had several meats and the duck, believe it or not, was the favorite!

This Recipe was great and easy to follow!  The man who gave me the duck fresh from that morning's hunt gave it to me in milk. The milk works just like the salt water mix does to pull the milk out of the meat and tenderize it a little. Worked great for us!

This was a great recipe.  My kids loved it.  We did need to cook it about 35 minutes on the grill.  We cooked it with the bone.

Fantastic!  This recipe is simple and delicious.  I had been looking to do a little something different for dinner after getting a bit tired of chicken, pork, fish and beef most nights, and the duck breast was just the ticket!  I also soaked the breasts in icy salt water for an hour per the suggestion of another reviewer, which was easy and they did not taste 'gamey' at all.  Please note that since duck has thick/fatty skin that it did catch 'fire' and char on that side, BUT that did NOT affect the cook time.  Next time, I'll grill the meat-side down first for 5 minutes and then grill the skin side for 3 minutes at most, to avoid the char.  While the recipe was incredible by itself, I also served it with some Hoisin Sauce on the side to dip pieces into, which was fantastic.  In China, they serve duck with scallions or chives, which would also taste good chopped over the finished duck.  Thank you for sharing this recipe - we'll be having this again!

Good recipe. I was short on time, so I brined the breasts for two days, marinaded the breasts for two days, then I grilled them. They were delicious, even to my picky teen eater. Great marinade.

Super easy recipe to make. had family over who normally don't eat wild meat and they loved it. I used Teal duck instead of Mallards and it was a great success too only downside to Teal is they have such tiny breast so make sure you have plenty...

Excellent recipe for wild duck. I have used it twice now and the second time it had to marinate for 48 hours-still delicious!
Both my 7 and 10 year olds gobbled it up.

This is an excellent marinade with wild duck or goose.  Have enjoyed it everytime I use it.  Letting it marinade for at least an hour in the fridge works well also I would soak the meet for several hours in salt water before hand.

SO good! Make this recipe. I could not believe how amazing it tastes. I also did the ice/salt bath (which, btw, the guys at the butcher had never heard of) and grilled skin-side down for most of the time. DE-LISH!!!

This was a good recipe. I used 4 wood duck breast and 4 goose tenders. My wife, who usually doesn't eat duck very much loved it. My 1 and half year old ate two of the tenders and demolished them. Will definitely add this to my ways to make my duck.

I followed this recipe pretty close, but I also soaked the duck in ice water and sea salt for 1 hour before marinating.
I used a whole duck and split it length wise in half and marinated the Mallard per recipe in the refrigerator for approximately 2 hours in a gallon zip lock bag turning occasionally. 
I rubbed sea salt  on both sides of the duck and scored the skin before cooking on a 400-450 gas grill for approximately 7 minutes per side, (skin side down first). After cooking, I then let  it rest for 5 minutes.  It  turned out medium rare and very tasty!

This is an excellent recipe! I don't normally care for the taste of duck (gamey and swamp-like), but this has a great garlicy steak-like taste. I soaked my ducks in salt water for two days to draw out the blood then marinated for two additional days. I poked holes in the meat with a fork to tenderize and allow the marinade to really sink in. Grilled it over charcoal, being careful not to over cook. This is the best waterfowl I have ever had! Full of flavor and very tender. I will definitely be using it again and am looking forward to trying it with goose.

I soaked the breasts in salt water for three days changing the water everyday. The result was like a beef filet with no game taste. I cook all my ducks on grill about 8 min a side med-high heat to a medium  just a little pink.

My son hunted duck yesterday morning for the first time.  He shot three.  Didn’t know how to prepare them but this recipe was perfect.  The breasts were tender and flavorful with no wild game taste at all.  This is a keeper.

Amazing.  Went out goose hunting, came back with ducks.  Thought I'd give this a try before making everything into Jerky  (not a duck fan). But wow, so simple.  I left out the hot sauce and added a bit of soya sauce. Marinated over night and pan fried to just red in the center. Simply amazing.  Make sure to clean the breasts properly (no fat, skin or silver lining, and soak the breasts in water, rinsing until the water is just pink.  These wild ducks have absolutely no game taste whatsoever.

I don't normally give reviews, but wow, I gotta tell you, this is without a doubt the best marinade for grilled duck breast I've ever tried.  I did substitute the Worcestershire which I'm not a big fan of for Soy sauce and added just a tablespoon of the Worcestershire ... I marinated it over night.  I also did the ice water cleansing for lack of a better term.  FANTASTIC!

Used the tips suggesting we soak the duck and there was no gamey taste at all. Possibly could have rated this recipe 5 stars but, in spite of my repeated warnings, my husband overcooked the breasts. They were still quite good.

Marinade was fantastic and simple. I grilled the meat until the internal temp was 125 degrees. At 135 or higher the meat takes on a texture similar to beef liver. Dinner was served under 60 minutes including marinade time.

I was short on Worcestershire, so I  used half and half with Maggi. Poured the marinade over the duck breasts in a small zip-lock back. Marinated while the grill heated up. 
So simple, yet perfectly tasty. 
Served with mashed sweet potatoes and prepackaged fettuccini Alfredo. 
Great week night break from the ordinary.

Loved this!  I've picked up duck hunting and found duck needs to be prepared right.  The salt water trick works very well - you can literally see all the blood that gets pulled out.  Marinade was great.  I cooked mine to medium well (not brave enough yet on wild duck to do less even though I'm sure it's safe) and didn't feel like it was too gamy.  Did this on wigeon.

This duck is fantastic. My husband is a hunter, so I'm always looking for duck recipes. This is easy and we loved it. Personally, I think the key is not overcooking the duck. Well done equals tough duck.

De-Lish! Soaked the breasts in a cold salt-water brine overnight, rinsed, dried, then put them in a Ziploc with the marinade in the fridge for about 8 hours. Definitely be careful not to overcook! Thanks for a great recipe! We'll use this one often!

My first time cooking duck and this was great. I did brine it a couple of days then marinated for about 8 hours. It's too cold to grill, so I wrapped it in bacon and cooked it in a hot iron skillet for about 4 minutes a side.

My husband like this a lot.  I did not think it was bad.  But I still don't like duck.
