Alright-  I do it a bit different.  Boil up chicken (I use a package, 3-4 breasts) shred. Add in about a cup of Franks Hot Sauce, then about a cup of Ranch dressing ( I do use the cheaper brand for this- doesn't seem to matter) 1/2 a package of finely shredded sharp cheddar and 1 package of cream cheese.  Mix well and put in an 8x8 pan to bake for about 30 min at 350.  Top with cheese and bake again until melted.  Best with tortilla chips.  Tastes GREAT!

I made this Dip for an appetizer on thanksgiving. It was delicious. I do have one tip though. If your going to make it the night before to save oven space don't put the cheese on yet. Make the main part of the dip, put it away and then add the cheese on top the day your going to serve it.(Microwave it if you can't use the oven.) I wasn't thinking and I cooked it all the night before. The cheese was VERY hard, but the dip underneath was good. I think it would have been the best dip ever if the cheese was melted right before. Oh and DON'T add the full amount of hot sauce. I used half of what the recipe called for and it was spicy enough.

We have a similar recipe that you use chunk canned chicken and make it in a small crock pot. It is EXCELLENT if you like hotwings.

I absolutely LOVE this dip...so does everyone else!! To simplify I just buy a small precooked whole chicken, shred it, and throw everything in the crockpot and let it melt.

I used my own dry ranch dressing mix that I made into ranch dressing using reduced fat sour cream and buttermilk. Other than that, I made no other changes. My three men loved this dip BUT my husband thought it could be a little less "drippy". He suggested I either cut back on the liquids a bit or add more chicken.

This was an ABSOLUTE HIT at our Superbowl party this year.  I did substitute the hot pepper sauce for Hooters Medium Heat Hot Wing Sauce and it was incredible!  I will warn you, if you are looking for something healthy, don't try this one...it is full of fat, but that is just fine for us to have on special occasions!

The best dip recipe I have ever got from this site. My husband askes me to make this for every party/occation we have. The only change I have made is instead of 2 blocks of cream cheese, I use one block and 250ml of sour cream.  I cut down the hot sauce depending on the crowd we are serving.  Not everyone likes the heat like we do! Delicious!

Delicious! Spicy but not hot enough to knock your socks off. I did not want to mess with keeping a dip hot, so just layered everything in my crockpot and it turned out great. My husband wants me to make a double batch next time so he can hog it for himself!

This is the recipe I always use. Just a easier tip, I go to my grocery store and buy a rotisserie chicken so I don't have to cook the chicken. It's way faster. Also, to make the soup all you have to do is take any left over dip and add chicken stock to your desired consistency for a delicious chicken wing soup.

Awesome dip - I've made it a few times and it is always a hit. I serve it with pita or bagel chips. I use blue cheese dressing as well as ranch and I mix in half of the cheddar before putting the rest on the top.

I used 2/3 regular Franks hot sauce and 1/3 Franks Extra Hot- but otherwise followed it exactly.  Everyone loved it.  Definitely great if you like buffalo chicken.

Love this recipe, I do it a bit differently though. I used a cup each of Franks buffalo sauce and ranch dressing. I also used 3 cans (drained) of chicken breast chunks to save on time. Also to save on time, we mix in the cup of shredded cheese and throw it in the crock pot...YUM!

My sister had brought something similar to my house and it was a hit.  So I looked up the recipe and followed this one for another get together.  The dip tasted OK, but it was WAY too soupy.  My sister's recipe only called for 1 pkg. cream cheese and the dip was in layers, not all stirred together, I think I will follow hers next time.

Just for those making this for a party here is what I did. I boiled the chicken, I used more than 1 lb, and then cubes it. I had the cream cheese sitting out while I did it. I also added a half stick of butter to the chicken after I cubes it. I took the cream cheese, hot sause and ranch and used my ninja to blend it and took out my ninja blade. I added the chicken to the ninja container with the mix in it and stuck in the fridge overnight. The morning of the party I used my crockpot on high for an hour and then added the shredded cheese. Once the cheese melted I lowered it to the low setting and once the party began I used the warm setting. I think next time I am going to use bleu cheese and also have celery to use to dip with!

People have to tear themselves away from this dip.  Boiled chicken, shredded, dumped all ingredients into crock pot.  Served w/ frito scoops.  My husband said he would have liked it a bit spicier, but we like really spicy food.  He also said he liked it just as well cold the next day.

I made the recipe exactly as written and it was great. I used Franks wing sauce. The next time I cut down on the wing sauce to 8 oz. because it was a little vinegary tasting. I also eliminated the shredded cheese  and sprinkled it with Blue Cheese crumbles after it cooked instead. I also used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch. With these changes it tasted just like my favorite buffalo wings.  I will be adding twice as much chicken next time and cube cutting it instead of shredding.  Great recipe as is - try it - if you like buffalo wings you will love this recipe.  Either blue cheese or ranch is good it just depends on what you like... Definitely try it on celery sticks!

Everyone LOVES it!! I buy a roast chicken that you can get in the deli section of your grocery store and just shred the meat off the bone. Then I mix the chicken and the bottle of Franks Hot Wing Sauce into a 9X13 pan and stick it in the oven to warm while I mix the rest. I then melt the cream cheese and ranch together on the stove top, low heat and spread it over the chicken, sprinkle the shredded cheddar and bake until bubbly and brown. I serve with tortilla chips.

Good dip, but too much ranch drsg. My son-in-law makes it with just cream cheese base, chopped chicken, hot sauce and cheese. Tastes great.

VERY tasty!!  The only change I made was to use (2) 10 oz. cans of chicken breast.  I wanted something a bit faster.  Next time I make it, I will cut down just a little bit on the hot sauce.  It's great the first few bites, but then gets a little too hot for my stomach! The next day, I poured the left overs on baked tortilla chips and stuck it in the oven.  It was fantastic!!!

Fantastic recipe I love it, and so does everyone else in the house lol it's hard to keep around. I will be making another pan tonight and the only thing I will change is mixing my shredded cheddar cheese in with the mixture opposed to putting it on top it seems to me that is better for the dish

I loved this recipe. I made my own ranch dressing and used my own buffalo wing sauce and it turned out incredibly well. I minced the chicken instead of shredding it and there were small chunks of chicken in every bite. I will definitely make it again.

Spicy, I wish I read the other reviews before adding a whole bottle of Frank's. I think half would have been more than enough.

This was delicious!!!  I used Franks hot wing sauce and put mine in the crock pot on low for about 4 hours versus baking it, and then just turned it to the warm setting afterwards so it stayed heated throughout the evening.

OMG This is it! A friends wife would make this and i never got the recipe, and when i found it on here i went nuts. I did check out all the other ones, and this one is the simplist. less stuff to use less mess! Everyone i know just shreds the chicken with their fingers, i have this hand blender chopper thing i used to grind it up. but i was able to use more chicken this way. Brought it to a party where no one had it before, and it was a HUGE hit! IT IS OUTSTANDING! its buffalo wings with out the bone, and the mess. i use tortia chips to dip into it! YUM YUM! i am sure you could use blue cheese if you wanted, i dont like blue cheese so this is perfect! try it, your LOVE IT!!!

Awesome.   I use half blue cheese dressing and half ranch if I have both on hand.  Usually don't add any grated cheese, it doesn't need it.  Always a hit and never any leftovers!

We really love this recipe, but I don't put it in the oven.  I mix it all up get it warmed up in the microwave, then put it in the crockpot until bubbly around the edges, (about 2 hrs on low).  It is great with tortilla chips.

This dip is great! It's better to not melt the cheese on the top, and def better to keep it in a slow cooker!

Very tasty. Just like Buffalo Wings without the mess. I think 16 oz of cheese is a bit excessive. 8 oz was plenty for us, and I definitely didn't need to use the full 12 oz of hot sauce to give it a nice kick! I did about 7 oz of hot sauce and that made it a pretty spicy "medium" flavor. I also think that 1 pound of shredded chicken breast is too little. I used 1 1/2 pounds, but I think more like 3 pounds would make this dip PERFECT!

Very good recipe. Made it over the holidays and everyone loved it. They're ready for me to make it again. I used 1/2 the amount of hot sauce the second time I made it since it was too spicy for me.

I follow the recipe (except I make sure to buy buffalo sauce - Frank’s - instead of just pepper sauce..).  This one is always delicious, and always a crowd pleaser! It is one of my go-to recipes!

This a a great recipe.  I did make a few changes.  Ever since I had a couple of stray chickens arrive at my house; I can’t bring myself to eat chicken.  I thought to myself, “what says hot wings other than chicken?”   Then it came to me...this recipe has cream elements.  I played around with it a little bit and removed the cream cheese, ranch dressing, and chicken and replaced it with Chrzan and pickled herring in sour cream, aka sledzie.  This hits the spot on game day.   We always have oplatek left over from Christmas, and these work amazingly well as a dipping implement.  Na zdrowie!

Very good! After reading the reviews, I decided to reduce the amount of ranch and hot sauce so it wouldn't be so runny. I used already cooked chicken that I had in the freezer for this. Thanks for sharing. :)

I used less hot sauce and less ranch dressing and it came out great. Quick and easy dip to bring anywhere. I sometimes use canned chicken and sometimes rotisserie chicken.Having canned chicken on hand is great in a pinch for this dip.I usually have all the other ingredients on hand anyway .

I made this for a party and everyone raved about it. Several people commented that it was the best chicken wing dip they ever had. I made 2 small changes. I used blue cheese instead of ranch and I mixed half of the shredded cheese into the mixture and put the other half on top.

We keep a crock pot and measuring cup at work so we can make this dip for special occasions...or just for the heck of it!!  We use canned chicken breast, it's so much easier. And you can adjust the hot sauce to your liking.  Great recipe!

I made this dip twice first time was exact. 2nd time I used mozzarella instead of Cheddar. I found the cheddar left an orange oily film on top.  This dip did not last long.  I served it with celery sticks & Tortilla chips.

Great recipe.  The only change I made was decreasing the hot sauce to 1 cup, as suggested by another review.  I liked to eat the dip on Ritz crackers, but some guests ate it on tortilla chips.

This is a crowd-pleasing, easy recipe.  I made this with canned chicken breast, a little less hot sauce and I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.  In my hometown we eat blue cheese dressing and celery sticks with chicken wings, so it seemed more natural.

I always make buffalo chicken wing dip in the slow cooker, but I enjoyed it baked in the oven. I did use canned chicken breast and not the whole bottles of ranch and hot pepper sauce or package of cheddar cheese. Turned out great!! Very nice texture.

This recipe has made it's way around the city ha ha ha, after I found it.  THe only difference we did was we use a hot wing sauce instead of the hot sauce.  THen my cousin came up with an unique idea.  She mad won ton cups (won tons put in muffin tins and baked for a few minutes) and put the dip inside the cups.  It was just as good and it looked pretty.

I have made it with chicken breast, but opted to try it with breaded chicken strips once and it was a hit!! friends that had enjoyed this before were raving about the twist! Cook the strips in the oven as directed then cut into bite~sized pieces. I typically layer the ingred. over the chicken starting w/ the wing sauce then the dressing mixed w/ softened cream cheese..I use blue cheese dressing instead of ranch, and this seems to be another favorite...this is such a hit with any group gathering,can't go wrong!!! Something else I've done w/ this...instead of using it as a dip, we had in stuffed in tortillas for dinner! Buffalo chick. burritos!!  a great idea for leftover dip too...if you have any leftover!! :-)

I've made this for a couple of potlucks at work and it has been a huge hit.  Instead of putting the cheddar on top as instructed, I just mixed it in with everything else.  Very addicting!!

This was fantastic!! So addicting.  Everyone raved about this dip.  Instead of ranch dressing I used blue cheese dressing, which gave it a nice zing.  I served it with a thinly sliced french baguette and shredded wheat crackers. Perfect!

This is by far the best dip I've ever had!  I serve it with celery sticks and Club Cracker Sticks.  It has the same flavor as your favorite hot wings, but is so much less messy.  The only changes I make are to use fat-free cream cheese and light or fat-free ranch dressing!

Had something like this at a party but when I made it I skipped the cheddar and instead threw in some bleu and feta cheeses.  This way it doesn't get as greasy and don't worry if you are not a bleu cheese fan- it will mellow as it heats.  In addition, we kept adding more and more hot sauce.  Could have been the brand I bought but for our taste it didn't seem "buffalo" enough.

we use this at every bbq we go too ...if we want it with an extra kick we add more hotsauce and sometimes switch it up with blu cheese instead of ranch ...my recipe is a lil different and i cook mine in a foil pan on the grill so i can keep it warm !
