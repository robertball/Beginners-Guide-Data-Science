My Changes: Used 1/2 cup powdered sugar for crust; Added 1 tsp. vanilla to filling; Used 1 cup powdered sugar for cream cheese frosting & whipped 1 cup Heavy whipping cream to fold into cream cheese mixture instead of cool whip (I don't like cool whip)

Decent but definitely not worth all the work, or the five star ratings that compelled me to make this.  5 cups of rhubarb is a lot to chop, especially when youre instructed to chop it "finely." The cream cheese topping has a thick paste like consistency.  The crust is good, nice and flaky.  There are many better rhubarb recipes out there that are easier and take less time.

Delicious recipe! I'm not a fan of custard but this--this is amazing! I'm always looking for new and fabulous rhubarb recipes, and this is most definitely a wonderful and elegant and casual recipe. Great choice for entertaining.

Wonderful! Everyone for seconds, crust is amazing. Added 15 more minutes and reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups and it was just perfect. Thanks. Now I know what to do with all that rhubarb in the yard!!

Made as recipe stated.  Was VERY good.  Next time I will leave off the cream cheese topping to cut down on calories. It will be good without it and much more diet friendly. Also, there is no way a 9 x 13 pan can yield 36 bars.

I made it as directed. Forgot it and over cooked it by 10 min so mine is a little dry. I think a little more rhubarb will work for this also. I will try a little larger chunks of rhubarb next time. Very mild rhubarb flavor. The cream cheese mixture does not fold with cool whip smoothly if just folded in. Lumpy is still tasty.

This is a nice recipe as the custard balances the tartness of the rhubarb. I didn't need 5 cups of the rhubarb- 3 was plenty for me.  I also had to bake the crust a bit longer, but I have a funny oven that often takes longer to bake things. I also added a bit of cinnamon to the crust because I like the balance of cinnamon and rhubarb.  Overall, a nice simple recipe that tastes great. Sweet, but not too sweet. I will make again :)
