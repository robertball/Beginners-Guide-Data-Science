Too much liquid.  Had a great flavor.  Didn't use aluminum
foil.  If make it again, I would use less broth.

In step 5, it says to cover the stew with the puff pastry, then cover that with foil. Is that correct? How can the pastry rise and brown if covered by foil?

Made it as one large pie in a cast iron skillet, not sure if I didn't give it time to reduce, but it was very "soupy" as far as the filling. will try again, maybe with less beef stock.

It was tasty, but it took way longer than 45 minutes to cook the pastry on top. The beef was not tender, other than that it tasted good, just wanted tender beef.

It was okay. I used red wine instead of beef broth. Next time I will not use the potatoes and will add mushrooms instead. The simmering time and baking time was too long. I think just the 45 minute baking time was enough to keep the beef  tender.
