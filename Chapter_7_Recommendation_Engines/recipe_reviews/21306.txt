My grandmother has been making this recipe for our family for over fifty years, and it has never been a miss no matter what type of fish you use.  She uses green bell pepper (and sometimes red too if she has it) instead of the jalapeno.  She also throws in about a half teaspoon of dill weed (really important!)  No need for fresh lemon (especially if that makes it too lemony for you) just a tablespoon of lemon juice will do.  In our family, nothing is more important than fish.  Believe me, if you only knew!  This recipe is a real winner.

I gave it a 4 because I had to spruce up the taste ,other than that the idea is great and I use something similar with my freshly caught fish. here is what I did: I saute the 2 teaspoons of fresh minced garlic and 1/2 tsp. of lemon zest in the olive oil. removed the oil from heat and added cracked black pepper and 2 tbsp. of rice vinegar. broke the filets down to 4-5 inch sizes and brushed the oil mixture on them, then added 1 pinch of dill weed and 1/2 tsp of a cajun spice blend. one small onion slice, 1 slice of a jalapeno and a half slice of a lemon. these were a hit.

This method of cooking works with ANY type of fish- our favorite is Mahi Mahi, rubbed liberally with fresh lemon juice, patted with butter, & sprinkled with Old Bay Seasoning. Thanks for sharing such a simple way to enjoy seafood!!

I love making tilapia this way-season the fish with salt,pepper and garlic powder, cut up zuccini and yellow squash, dice up a plum tomato and jalopenos. throw it all in the foil on top of the fish,drizzle with a little EVOO, lemon juice and a splash of your fav white wine,(maybe a dash of dijon mustard too!) top with a few capers, throw it in for 20mins..awesome!

This was great.  I can never cook fish right.  This turned out absolutely divine.  The filet fell apart and was moist and not too fishy--even the house didn't smell overwhelmingly fishy.  My son raved over it.  Way to go!!!!  Thank you!

We really enjoyed all the extra flavor of the peppers.  Will fix this regularly as we are trying to eat fish more often.
I rarely have trout, but a nice way to perk up the flavor for any fish. If you want a good sauce try the one from Salmon Fillets with Creamy Dill, except keep it healthy by using plain yogurt intead of all that mayo.  Why would anyone go to the trouble to make something this healthy, then drown it in mayo?

I used green peppers and green onions instead of the jalepeno, but it was excellent.  Fish was tender, no fuss, no muss.  Foil rules!

Quite good. Can be used with any fresh fish. Make sure, however, the fish is absolutely fresh (check for clearness of eyes, for instance). Fresh fish will not taste fishy as someone else noted.
Serve with a jalapeno tartar sauce (mayo, pickle relish [either dill or sweet]and a little diced jalapeno.

Love this recipe and have used salmon as well.  Also put sauteed sweet yellow and red bell peppers on top of the fish while cooking in the foil which adds great flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

I adjusted the recipe for 6 filets, which meant 2T of garlic salt--and that was clearly TOO MUCH!   Also, because I used jarred jalapenos there was too strong of a jalapeno flavor, too (& my husband loves hot stuff!), because of the peppers containing more liquid, which got into the fish too much.  If I try it again I'll use half as much garlic salt, and add garlic powder & use fresh jalapenos (as the recipe states).

This was delicious! I used a whole salmon fillet that served two of us, a whole lemon and a whole jalapeno (fresh). Followed the recipe exactly and it was gorgeous! The fillet was frozen so I put it in the oven on 375 for 30 minutes and it came out perfectly. The only thing I would change is that I would de-seed the jalapeno next time as I found it a little spicy!!

This is a great recipe.  Very easy.  I didn't have jalepenos to use.  And I sprayed fish with butter Pam.  I used sliced lemon, garlic powder, season salt, blackened seasoning, and dill weed.  It turned out fabulous!  I can't wait to experiment with other seasonings!  I cooked it for 20 minutes on 400 in my toaster oven with ease.  Like another reviewer said though, it was a little too wet so I will vent it next time.**Update!!**I've made this so many times now!  The venting didn't work so the fish was still wet.  What I did was put a piece of bread under the fish to soak up the juices and it came out perfect.  Not wet at all!

Fresh fish has no odor. The recipe masks the flavor of the trout. Just add salt, pepper, small amount of garlic, and dill. Try frying 3 slices of bacon, reserve a small amount of the grease, and fry the trout with eggs over easy. Best camp breakfast ever.

I used tilapia instead of trout, and salt and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Everything else I followed exactly according to the recipe. Very tasty fish! And the clean up was done in a cinch, so it's a keeper recipe for sure! The fish we used probably could have used an extra couple of minutes of cooking time (I think I put it in for 17), but that will vary by type of fish and thickness of the fillet. My husband thought it was a bit too lemony for his taste, but next time I'll just not squeeze so much juice out of the ends, I think. I really liked the fact that it didn't require any marination ahead of time so it could be easily thrown together after a long day of working for a quick and healthy dinner meal.

Great recipe.  I used a steelhead fillet, and had to use limes instead of lemons, because my lemon had gone bad.  I would use lemons next time though, as the limes left kind of a bitter aftertaste.  I also subbed green onions for the jalapeno, which I enjoyed.  Served it with Vegetable Couscous, which was a great pairing!  A light and healthy meal.

I made this tonight and had much success. I needed to cut down on the heat so I used sliced fresh mushrooms instead of the hot peppers. I used tilapia (I'm pretty sure any fish is good with this) and didn't have lemons or garlic salt so I used lemon pepper, ground black pepper (for mine) salt and garlic powder. very tasty and easy, I just need to practice making pouches 8(. I will make this again, maybe with fresh garlic and some dill. Thanks for posting. My baked fish always ended up "grayish" on the bottom, but not this one. I'm impressed !!!

This was awesome. However, i made 6, 3 how recipe called for, and 3 with additions. And we prefered the ones with additions, i seasoned the fish with salt pepper, and garlic powder.  then sprayed the foil.  put fish in it, added chopped parsely, sliced red onion, lemon slices 2 small tabs of butter, and the jalapenos on top.  The fish was Wonderful, the other ones as is were kind of bland.  So we will make them with the adjustments we made from now on.  But overall great recipe

So easy and so yummy!  I served this over lemon pepper rice.  It's too hot to turn the oven on inside the house, so I grilled it in tin foil for 20 min.  Perfect!

This is a really, really good dish that my husband raved about. I dipped Tilapia filets in a mixture of olive oil, minced garlic, fresh ground pepper, and fresh lemon juice. Since the filets were small, it only took eleven-and-a-half minutes to bake.

I definitely recommend using only fresh jalapeños (seeds removed.) Jarred peppers would subtract from the taste.  Thanks, Denyse!

I think this is the best way I have ever eaten Tilapia! It was light and fresh with a hint of a kick. My kids loved it but did complain a little about the spiciness, but that didn't keep them from eating it all! I served the fish over rice and poured the baking juices over it all. Great and super easy!

Good - but the lemon flavor was intense.  Family ate it but did not like how strong the lemon flavor was.  Will make again, but with 1/2 lemon instead.

Granted you dont get that nice pan-seared crust but you can't have it all! Pan frying makes me worry whether the middle is cooked enough.....the steaming the foil causes lets me know the whole thing cooked evenly, and it looks that way too. Plus, less smell! This will be my method with salmon from now on.

I have been cooking fish like this for years! It's good with any kind of fish, and each kind can be seasoned according to its area of origin for an authentic flavor. My family is fond of Mediterranean varieties. Also, take leftover spaghetti noodles, place them in a gallon ziploc bag with olive oil and seasonings, shake well, and refrigerate. They're ready in a moment's notice for a delicious and beautiful bed for your fish.

I was a little skeptical about the peppers, but "wow" what a dish.  I rate my recipes 1 to 10, and this one was a definite 10.  I'm not all that crazy about fish and I know it's good for you, but this was wonderful.  I'll make it many times.

Even though I made some changes it rates the stars. I used Red Snapper instead of trout. Used Sesame seed oil instead of olive oil, and as suggested by other reviewers, sprinkled on dry Dill Weed. Came out fantastic. Got raves from every one.

This was wonderful, but I added 1/2 of dry white wine and used fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt.  I also used Mahi Mahi instead of trout.  My husband and I loved it

Salmon rocks, this recipe doesn't.  Overcooked with the amount of time.  Millions of ways to make better salmon. We are in Alaska and should have know better.  Keep the seeds out of the jalapenos if you want to eat them.

We made this and it was GREAT!!!  The only thing I did different was that I added sauteed veg. and put them in the foil.

I can't even describe how delicious these little bundles were:) My husband had just come back from a fishing trip and had 2 beautiful rainbow trout to cook up. I followed this recipe but also added a bunch of chopped red onion to the bundles and fresh garlic cloves stuffed in the cavity as well as a sprig of fresh dill. I was skeptical about all of the strong flavors coming together but they did and I told my husband he had to go fishing more so I could make this dish again:) Thanks!

Pretty good - clean up is wonderful!  I used a couple cloves of fresh garlic.  Also added thin sliced onion.  Took a lot longer than 20 minutes, but I was using steelhead trout which is much larger than rainbow.

This was pretty good!! I didn't use trout, I used halibut since it's my husbands favorite. He loved the lemon and jalapeno taste this recipe gives; however, I think it was lacking a little in flavor and next time I will sqeeze more lemon juice onto each filet or use a lemon pepper seasoning. We also didn't cook it in the oven and instead we used the grill outside. Each fish steak was grilled in it's own pouch with sweet peppers and zuchinni. Served with white rice. Yummy!

Very good, IF you use steelhead fillets, not whole trout. Whole trout is so delicate, that soaking it in garlic salt and lemon counters the sweetness of the fish too much. Plus, good trout needs to be roasted not steamed in foil!

I often make this, however, I use fresh garlic and those "smokin' bags" to give this dish a special smoked flavor. You can put your veggies in the bag with the fish as well.

I almost never review poorly because I always choose recipes with lots of great reviews.  That means almost everything we make is a winner. Unfortunately, this was not a winner.  The fish didn't cook well and the flavors didn't mesh.  I just don't think foil is the best way to make this recipe, it doesn't leave a way for the liquid to release, which means the fish basically poaches and all the flavor is left in the liquid.

This recipe is very easy - my bf made it, & it turned out very good, with a light, natural flavor.  Works best with fresh fish.  We omitted the jalapenos (b/c we are weak) but added chopped garlic from the jar.  I've also made it "chinese-style" by adding onto the recipe a little bit of soy sauce to taste (or none), switch garlic salt to just garlic, & thinly sliced or shredded ginger.  Just the way my dad (from a family of fishermen in Taiwan) used to make it!

This was very good and easy.

I liked it even better when I used orange roughy and took one small pat of butter (about how much you would use on a piece of bread), cut it up into small pieces and placed it evenly over the fish before baking.  Yum!

I love to hear "You can make this again, Mom"!  That is what my 14 year old said.  I don't hear that often.  Made it with Tilapia and also had some Hake (like Cod) left in the freezer.  It was great with both kinds of fish.  This is a keeper!

This was wonderful!  My daughter even enjoyed it, and the only fish she'll usually touch is frozen and already battered right out of the box.  There was no offensive smell in the house (we took advice and made sure bones made it to the outside trash immediately) but best of all, the trout didn't taste too "fishy."  My husband has already asked me to make it again for a family dinner.

overall, this was a good recipe because it's healthy and not too messy.   while it was very spicy (which we really liked), it wasn't exactly flavorful.  we complemented this entree with wild rice, which brought out the flavor a little more.  i will make this again because it is very healthy and quick, but i will play with the spices...maybe it needed more salt?  maybe a splash of balsamic vinegar?   i recommend trying this recipe at least.

This recipe was ok. Nothing to rave about but not awful either. I used whiting fillets which may account for my ok rating. I cut the seeds and membranes from the jalapenos in order to control the spiciness for my children. I also used limes instead of lemons because they were all I had one hand. After cooking the fish, I thought it was a little bland so I added Creole seasoning on top. I must say the clean up was wonderfully easy however. I will probably try this again with a better whitefish and lemons.

I used this recipe with rainbow trout.  I used lime instead of lemon and also spread butter and garlic on the filet. I used sliced jalapenos and a few sprigs of cilantro.  I was very disappointed in the flavor.  There was not as much flavor as I expected.  I also had to cook it almost 45 minutes before the fish flaked easily.

Loved it - so easy, clean, and perfectly cooked.  I added some white wine, zucchini, yellow squash, tomatoes, and red peppers as well.  Tasted great!

The lemon was refreshing, the jalapeno was just enough spice!  This was quick and easy, and had a nice flavor!

Very good and mess free! Didn't use the jalapeno pepper because I don't like spicy food and used concentrated lemon juice instead.  Still lots of flavor.

Awsome.  This is in my opinion the best way to cook trout.  The jalapenos go great with this dish.  I served with rice and veggies.  Easy to make and not much clean up.  Thanks

This is now my favorite go-to recipe when making fish. I use trout but use other kinds of fish as well, like salmon, cod, etc. It's so easy to make and it comes out so moist every time. I usually omit the jalapeno peppers but it's just as delicious. Thanks for sharing.

What an excellent light summer meal! We tried this with both cod and sole; the sole picked up the flavors much better than the cod, but both were very good.  The cleanup couldn't have been easier!

This recipe was so easy, and so good!  My boyfriend and I made it for dinner and really enjoyed it.  It's is a perfect blind of spiciness and citrus.  We paired it with roasted asparagus spears and bread with olive oil.  It was also really inexpensive!

400 degree's for 15-20 min was perfect.  I sort of followed taste king's review and sauteed 4-5 TBSP of olive oil with a TBSP of minced garlic, lemon zest of one lemon for about 3-4 minutes. After removing from heat, added garlic pepper and a bit of cajun seasoning.  Brushed both sides of fish with oil mixture, added 1/2 slice of lemon, fresh jalapeno and onion.  Huge hit with husband and 8 year old son!  Next time I'll add more onion to the packets.  Served with asparagus and rosemary crusty bread.

We tried the recipe tonight and found it to be delicious. This is really surprising because we were a non fish eating family. We are saving this recipe. Very moist fish. When I cooked it I cooked a whole trout(small) instead of fillets because I don't know how to cut them. The skin came right off and the bones came out easily and in tact. thanks for the recipe

It turned out great! I didn't have olive oil so I used regular vegetable oil and garlic paste instead of the salt. I wasn't expecting it to work out so well but everybody liked it! I followed one of the comments here by first sauteeing the garlic and lemon zest in oil, then adding crushed black pepper, salt, red chillies and lemon juice at last.

Good recipe for fish.  I used cod, seasoned well with salt, pepper and garlic powder, put plenty of jalapeno slices (without seeds) over top and used lime instead of lemon.  When done, I put the fish with jalapeno's over white rice and squeezed more lime and added fresh cilantro to give it more of a Caribbean flavor.  It was delicious.

I loved this recipe!!! Quick and delicious! I substituted the lemon with diced pineapple and the jalapeno pepper with a 1/2 cup premade medium salsa.... added a pinch of lemon pepper seasoning and reduced the amount of garlic salt to 1 tsp. but I'm sure the original recipe would have been fantastic; I only substituted due to the ingredients I had in my pantry... after all I'm only an average college girl I can't afford to splurge on one meal (:

Everything came out a bit watery and sloppy.  The jalapeno slices were mush.  The flavors overall didn't really excite me.  The only reason I'm not rating this recipe lower is that the fish filets themselves really did cook up nicely, perfectly flaky.  I think therefore that this general cooking method has a lot of promise, but I will look around for a different variation.

My own stupidity, I should have realized the amount of salt in it. I scaled it for 6 servings and WOW it was nasty salty.  I added the dill weed suggested by some and used a poblano instead of jalapeno.  Very good recipe and a keeper with 1/4 the amount of salt.

Wow! I only saw 3 whole rainbow trout so that is what I used. Simple with a slight jalapeno taste. I did deseed/devein the jalapeno because the kids aren't fans.

This recipe was one of the best fish recipes I have ever made by pulling off the internet.  Our grocery store did not have trout so I used seabass instead and it came out delicious!  I've been trying to find more chicken and fish recipes for healthier living and this one will definitely stay in the rotation for years to come.

This recipe was a very big disappointment. I was sure it would be a hit, but it wasn't. The only flavour that remotely stood out was the lemon. Otherwise, it was really quite flavourless. I couldn't even finish it.

Easy cleaner way to make any fish preparation; Use any preferred spice . . . i used dill, onion, lemon as tradition. This can be placed into an oven or a grill. . . either way clean up is another chef preparation and any time it is easier it will succeed imho

I made this with tilapia and it was amazing - I actually impressed myself. I seasoned it with EVOO, garlic salt, pepper, squeezed a bit of lemon, sprinkled lemon pepper and topped it with lemon slices and sweet peppers! AMAZING!! Well deserved 5 star for the idea!!!

Used this with cod filets, and it was great. The jalapeno gives it a little zing, but not too much. Keeper.

This recipe is just amazing and so delicious!! I submitted tilapia filets and added raw, thinly sliced zucchini and squash. The fish and veggies cooked up perfectly. My entire family loved this dish and asked that I make it again! Maybe next time, I will make it with different fish and veggies. Yummy!!

Great tasting fish in foil! I added some sliced onions to these and was very generous with the jalapenos and lemons. They were done at 20 minutes; they were a large size tho - about 1/2 lb. each. Everyone ate it up!!! Served with spinach sauteed with mustard and red bell peppers. Also whipped up a side of carribean rice. 
I can't wait to make this on a camping trip!

This is a great recipe for trout. My wife hates the smell of fish, but when she came home after work the day I made it she actually commented about how good dinner smelled! She doesn't really like fish, but that changed after having the lemon trout.

Delicious!  Difference, is I grilled mine in the foil packet...  it was the most tender fall apart fish every. Even the lemon slices I put on top of the fish was beyond tender.  Also, I used different seasonings, but I also melted alittle bit of butter and used a grill brush to brush the fish with butter before adding seasonings, lemon/onion/jalapeno slices.  I'm going to try the baked version tonight.

My husband loves this recipe but I haven't tried it with jalapenos yet. I have used green peper and/or red/yellow pepper since it was all I had on hand. I have only been able to use lemon juice instead of fresh lemons and it is still awesome.

This was ok.  Not bad, not amazing.  We felt it just needed a bit more flavor.  If I prepare it again, I will have to add some additional seasonings.  It was easy and didn't leave the house with the typical "fish smell" afterwards!

WOW! This recipe is simply delicious. I've been looking for a good and easy recipe like this for  years. I did modify it a bit... I seasoned the filets with cajun seasoning, garlic salt and dill, I layed the filets on about half an onion (sliced) and I used pickled pepper rings instead of jalapeno (only because I didn't have any). I also had to cook them for about 25 minutes since my filets were pretty thick. It turned out to be delicious!! This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thx.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made it just as it said in the recipe. The jalapenos were not too much for me, and I usually don't like spicy food. Yummy and healthy!!

Delicious and healthy - i cut a red pepper and onions and placed on top, and sprinkle crushed pepper flakes and also used minced garlic. Very easy and my husband who doesn't like fish ate this and got seconds!

No smell, no mess, no major clean-up... It doesn't get much better than this! Husband likes things spicy so I added two sliced jalapenos to his foil packet. Also used lemon pepper instead of the regular variety. This was a super easy mid-week meal. Thanks, Denyse!

I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and added the salt separately and it came out great!  Even my husband cleaned his plate, and his idea of fish is fish sticks.

Super easy, super quick recipe - great for days when you really don't feel like cooking.  My husband really liked this alot; I was sold more on ease of preparation.  I used pickled jalapenos (out of a jar) instead of fresh because that's what I had.  They were REALLY spicy just how we like our food.  I don't cook alot of fish, but when I want fish, I'll make this again. It's healthy, too.

These folil wrapped fish ideas are the greatest. Very little clean up and they taste great.

I also do this with salmon, a little olive oil, S&P and a few slices of lemon.....deeeeevine!

This is the only fish I've ever enjoyed that wasn't catfish that my dad deep fried.  The jalapenos weren't spicy to me at all though, so I was a little disappointed about that.  I used tilapia, it was great!

Great recipe and easy way to clean up. I don't use filets but whole fish. Have done this in the oven or the grill. Our favorite way of cooking all the trout the man brings home (and he brings home a lot) is a variation I made of this recipe. I use the flavorwave, one of those infomercial gadgets that cooks with the light-but it can be done in the foil also. I fill the cavity with sliced onion, jarred jalapeno slices and a good handful of cilantro I just grab from the bunch. Then I sprinkle both sides of fish with garlic powder, regular Mrs. Dash and a few sprinkles of lemon juice. In the flavor wave I put some of the juices from the jalapeno jar in the bottom of the glass pan so that the drippings dont stick and is easier to clean, plus the juices prevent the fish from drying out and make it so moist. This is beyond 5 stars!! Try it!

Very good and very adaptable.  Just a note - fresh fish should never taste fishy.  If it does, it is not fresh and certainly not worth eating.

The jalapeno peppers are what made this so good. It gave the fish the perfect amount of spice.

Used Mahi Mahi steaks instead and ommitted the jalapenos (kids won't eat anything spicy).  Added paprika and parsley, put a dab of margarine on the fish instead of using olive oil.  15 minutes at 400 was perfect!

So easy! And the best part is it's totally customizable. We used minced garlic and onions with a little bit of lemon juice. Came up tender, moist and mellow. It will be fun to experiment with this in the future.

They had no trout at the store, so I made it with boneless salmon steaks. I don't eat meat, but my boyfriend said it was good. Next time I would use less garlic salt.

This was a good, easy recipe.  It didn't wow us with great flavor, but the ease of the recipe makes up for it.  We added leftover green and orange bell peppers; they definitely added to the presentation.  Also used fresh garlic as other reviewers suggested.  The best part?  Just threw foil in trash and cleanup was done!

We used teriyaki sauce as another post suggested, which gave it a nice twist. Also, we included fresh onion, garlic, and some kind of green pepper that looked like a huge jalepeno, but turned out it wasn't! lol  A little soupy and mushy...we will probably serve on a bed of rice next time and use less teriyaki sauce. You will definitely see this dish on our dinner table in the near future...with some tweaking! Thanks!

This was EXCELLENT.  Quite possibly the best fish I've ever made.  I used steelhead trout and doubled the ingredients to make up for the size of the filet (they're quite large).  It was PERFECT.  I will definitely be making this again, thanks!!!

I look forward to try this when camping, too!!!

I love this recipe.  It's so easy, yet so delicious.  I used white roughy instead of rainbow trout.

I made the recipe exactly as it is written. The fish was SOOO spicy we could not eat it. I typically like spicy dishes...but this one was overpowering.

Very good.  I used bell peppers and a little dill and the fish came out quite good.  Trout has a wonderful flavor anyway and this recipe just enhances it.  Thanks!

So good, SO easy! I used whole trout and put the olive oil, lemon slices and jalepenos inside. I did remove the seeds so the spicy wouldn't overpower the fish. Everyone LOVED it!

I am not a fish lover, but my husband enjoys catching (and eating) fish. This recipe was simple to make, and had a good flavor. I omitted the jalapeno (kids), sprinkled the inside and outside with the seasonings, and lined the inside with lemon slices. I had to bake the 6 fish around 40 minutes. I actually manged to eat nearly the whole fish. ( A HUGE thing for me) Thanks Denyse, this one's a keeper!

I put frozen broccoli florets right in the foil on top of the fish and it turned out great!  I leave off the jalapenos for the kids.

This is the best baked fish I ever had.  I removed the seeds and membranes from the jalapenos before putting the slices on the fish.  It has just the right amount of flavor, without being too spicy.  I'm not a big jalapeno fan and ate all the jalapenos after cooking them like this!  I just served the foil packets on each plate so people could have their own little bit of "dipping sauce."  (I put a lot of lemon juice on the fish before baking).  

I used frozen Blue Hake fillets that I had thawed before baking.  Schwan's sells these and I don't think I will make this fish any other way now.  I baked mine for 20 minutes and they were perfect.  

I probably used half the olive oil and used a lot of fresh lemon juice instead.

Thanks, Denyse.  This will be a regular meal at our house now!

This is a quick and easy way to cook fish, but it is rather bland.  I think I will try cooking in the foil but use some different spices next time.  I think it might be good with fresh dill or rosemary and garlic.

I followed a review made by another - drizzled the fish with lemon juice, seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, topped with thin slices of lemon, then butter and seeded jalepeno pepper slices. Wrapped it up and baked my fillets (about a half pound each) at 400 F for 20 minutes. Turned out  perfect, just drained the packets before serving. Even my picky eater who usually dislikes fish likes this!! Will definitely make this again!! Thanks!

Delicious! Used red pepper strips and thinly sliced onion, 2” thick cod on top, then drizzle olive oil, little fresh lemon juice, S,P, parsley,lemon thyme, lemon slices.  20 mins then added 5 more as cod was thick. 
A source said internal temp for fish is 145, approximately 10 minutes per inch

I use this recipe but I modified a bit. I use red chilies instead of jalapeños (because I like it that spicy) and dory fish. Me and my husband love it! 

But I do think I need to tone down the spiciness a bit next time haha. I was too excited!

As written, it's a little bland if you can't do jalapenos, which we can't in our family.  But it's a very nice base and cooks the trout really well.  I added sliced onions and fennel and some more seasonings to the fish before wrapping in the foil otherwise it was too plain (I can see where jalapenos will take care of a alot of that issue).  The cooking time and method was spot on and the fish came out flaky and moist and delicious.  Will continue to add and modify in different ways but always use this method.

Really quick and easy.  Instead of regular olive oil, I used a garlic and herb basting oil (from Wegmans).  I made two filets..  In one of the packets, I added a handful of grape tomatoes.  Delicious both ways!  Definitely will make again.

I'm not a fish person (though I wish I was considering the health benefits!), but I did enjoy this recipe. It was very easy to make, and it is robust enough that I was able to add different vegetables to the packets for some of my family members and it still turned out good. I used lemon juice instead of sliced lemon since some other reviews said the slices were too strong. I also added dill (first time ever in a recipe) and I highly suggest others try it. It definitely kicks this up a notch! I used jalapeños in some packets, and bell pepper in other.  Finally, I suggest seasoning both sides of the fish. I found that when I only seasoned one side, the fish I used came out a little too fishy for my taste. I also live inland, and I have to buy frozen fish, so that might be why mine needs extra seasoning.

Not practical with rainbow trout.  Fillets too thin.  Use just about any other fillet.o additional liquid other than from lemon.  Try with orange and/or lime.

Made with 4 tilapia filets. Baked for about 24 minutes as the tilapia goes straight from the freezer to oven. Use less jalapeno next time, I used 4 slices per filet and it was too much! Also, cut down on the garlic salt to less than 1 t. Made with corn as a side.

Excellent flavor. I used Basa and you must use fresh jalapeño .
And fresh lemon. I did add some dill, a family favorite.
Thank you for Sharing.

This was super bomb. I made a few changes. Used lemon pepper, garlic pepper, garlic powder and a lil sea salt. Followed rest of ingredients.

This is a really nice recipe! Fast to prepare if you have the ingridients ready! If you want a more lemoney taste I suggest adding lemon pepper seasoning. Also Make sure to add the correct amount of salt to give that great taste!

Made this with some trout my husband & I caught the other day.  Used to eat a lot of fish at home (from the east cost of Canada), and it is quite expensive here in Utah, so I was happy to get some fresh caught trout! Wish we could eat fish more. I love lemon with fish, I squirted quite a bit of lemon juice on it but I really like the lemon taste with it.  Thought it was very tasty.  Put it in for about 18  mins and it came out perfect.

So simple and delish!!! I love the fact that you don't actually have to marinate the chicken I had of time the flavors just meld together while you are baking!  I added fresh basil red onions and zucchini to my packets and it turned out amazing!!

I totally spaced the olive oil but it still turned out pretty well. I though it was a bit too spicy but my boyfriend loved it. I might make a packet without jalapeno for me next time. It was very easy to make. I added some fresh basil and Greek oregano from our garden and some sliced sweet onion. I did not find there was too much liquid.

Very good. I use salmon too and put a tsp. of butter on top, spice it up with salt pepper and garlic and dill weed. Slice lemon rings 1/4 in. and lay on top. Simple. Seal tin foil edges and bake in the oven with your chips on baking sheet. Kill two fish with one stone (LOL)

Very good. I used Black Drum that my son caught when he went to Rockport. I love how the jalapeños added flavor without heat. My husband opted not to use the jalapeños on his and added paprika instead. Also very good. We opened the foil packets for the last few minutes of baking.

I used Swai (which is a form of catfish) didn't have lemon so I used lemon pepper seasoning, garlic powder and jalapenos and cooked for 20 minutes.  My hubby said it was awesome!  Served with wild rice.

Trout, prepared any other way, is just not worth having; in my opinion at least.  This recipe is simple, quick, and absolutely delicious.  The fish takes on a wonderful flavor, and the same is true for the veggies.  Like many other commentors, I added green peppers and onions as well as the jalepenos and lemon.  Just threw it on the grill on low temp and let it cook.

So easy to make. I substituted pickled jalepeno for fresh becasue that is all I had. Next time I will buy fish with no bones, this was the only issue I had. It was tough to get around them. Otherwise, great dish. Could easily stuff this with herbs or other veggies as well.

Fabulous recipe!! Easy and delicious. I used halibut, seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and cayenne pepper. I drizzled garlic infused olive oil then squeezed 1 tsp of lemon juice over each fillet, then dotted with parsley butter (yes I know I probably changed the health quota of the recipe). Great with boiled/ roasted potatoes and french beans. YUM.

I was skeptical of this because I don't like jalapenos at all but after this bakes it gives the fish a great aroma and subtle flavor. This is a great, simple recipe and my picky 2 year old son ate it!

Fast and fantastic! Perfect for days when you need to come up with supper in a hurry. I served it with asparagus and a blend of wild and brown rices.

This was a good receipe.  Easy to follow.  I used Flounder instead of Trout and the flavor was good.  Like the other Reviewers suggested, I added some dill and less lemon, especially since Flouder is not very "fishy".  I like to "kick" from the Jalapeno Peppers.

I love this recipe! Very basic but sooo good. Even my kid has seconds and requests it two nights in a row! I used trout the first time and was good, but trout can be pricey so I've done it with tilapia since and it is fantastic!

This was so good and so easy!  Used pickled jalapenos - because that's what I had - otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The peppers were a nice, subtle bit of zip - delicious.

Really enjoyed this. Used jalapeños from a jar. Added onion and potato with cajan spice below fish. Sauteed the garlic with cracked pepper and added 2 tbsp sushi vinegar as suggested. Did not have dill so left out and turned out well. Rubbed sautee mix on outside of whole, scaled, head-less fish.

Simple, but truly delicious!  You can substitute lime for lemon, and use fresh garlic and regular salt, and it will still turn out wonderfully (as I'm sure others have pointed out).

Per another review, I sautéed 2 t. garlic in olive oil and added 2 T. red wine vinegar, then spread this mixture on top of the fish.  I placed two green pepper slices and two yellow onion slices (briefly sautéed with the garlic) atop each fillet then added a jalapeno slice.  I also sprinkled each fillet with garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, and sea salt.  This wasn’t my favorite fish recipe, but it was tasty nonetheless.

This really is a great recipe.   I made some modifications however.   I sauteed minced garlic in the olive oil, added some rice vinegar and black pepper and made a great mixture to bast onto the fish.    Otherwise, I followed the recipe and I loved the result.

I was going to attempt "as is" but was nervous because of the bland reviews.  I used dried jalapeno flakes I grew and I also chopped a spring onion.

I thought the lemon and jalapeno rings were wasted by the photos.  Most people do not eat whole rings and the cooked food will end up on the side of the plate.  I also thought the presentation was junky.  I will chop fresh jalapeno next time removing the seeds as I do not want the hot spicy to completely take over the fish.  I may cook a thin jalapeno relish and add to side of plate or top of fish this would allow more of the natural fish flavor.  It really needs dill and juice half the lemon add zest of the whole and garsh with wedges.

My cook time was perfect as listed.

This was really good, but I also changed it a little bit. after soaking in the olive oil, I dipped it in seasoning salt with fresh garlic. and in place of the jalapenos, I used red and green bell pepper - as other reviewers suggested.  It was SOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!

Mmm this was great!  I did change the recipe a little though, I marinated the fillet in lemon juice and garlic overnight, then I added olive oil, fresh garlic, garlic salt, pepper, dill and a splash of lemon juice, and topped with sliced fresh jalapeno.  Very very delicious!

I tried this cause it was different and I didn't want to smell up the kitchen trying to sear the fish in oil. I had seen a recipe on food network where they used the same foil technique and it looked great. The preparation was extrememly easy. I followed the recipe exactly. I added some purple onion and dill weed for some color. 

It took about 25 minutes cause I thick pieces. 

My boyfriend raved about it. It was juicy and perfectly cooked. I made some cheese risotto on the side and it was just divine. 

Clean up was a breeze cause you just throw out the foils.

Yummy!!  We really enjoyed this one.  I added lemon pepper seasoning along with the granulated garlic and also added minced garlic.  I actually did not bake right in foil, just in a glass dish.  Came out wonderful, nice flavour.  Thanks for sharing.

This was good but a little blah. Maybe the jalepenos were too mild. I served it with brown rice and green beans cooked with bacon and onion. Next time I might add red bell pepper.

Nice simple fish recipe, would make if I needed something fast. I wouldn't make for a special occasion. Easy clean up. Moist fish but too me was on the bland side. Flavors didn't quite pop. Husband enjoyed it but I felt something was missing, perhaps needed some dill or some kind of herb. Followed recipe as written

This was awesome! I used lemon juice since I didn't have fresh lemons and substituted jalepenos for green chiles b/c that's what I had on hand and it tasted delicious!

This is one our favorites!! I use Steelhead trout instead of rainbow and me and the wife think it is one of the best fish dishes I have made. Quick clean up too with it in the foil.

Great meal.  I used Tilapia instead because the store was out of Trout.  I am normally a great cook (not to brag) but it turned out exceptionally good and was also kid-friendly.  My entire family went for seconds and thirds until it was all gone.

this was an incredibly flavorful fish. i did tweak the recipe somewhat and was very pleased with the results. first, i grilled the fish and i used tilapia instead of trout. since the recipe calls for jalapeno pepper, i paired that spicy taste with some cajun seasonings. i also used a smoky paprika. i really like the idea of the jalapeno peppers on top of the fish. something new for me. this was really good!!!

This was a great way to cook fish!!!  I used talapia fish and fresh garlic.  I just brushed the oil with garlic onto the fish.  Really was yummy.  I served it with a spinach orzo salad.  So light and healthy.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I started with really fresh rainbow trout...a must.  I used no salt and squeezed a little more lemon over the fish.  Blanketed fish with additional jalepeno peppers.  Baked for 12 minutes and it was perfect!

This is a good basic recipe for trout. I cooked mine for 12 minutes, and it turned out fine. It's a little on the bland side, I think it might be better with fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.

Wow, what a great and easy recipe.  I was careful to wrap the foil tightly, and the trout stayed nice and moist.  The only modification I made was holding the jalapenos (I didn't have any), but I'll try them next time.  This dish is easy to make, great to eat, and easy to clean up.

I tried this recipe with catfish and it was great! Very simple, too, especially considering this was my first time cooking fish. The only thing I had to do differently was to cook it for about 30-35 minutes.

I made this recipe with tilapia.  Be careful with the size of the lemon, my family thought it was too lemony.  They said to cut down the amount of lemon and increase the amount of jalapenos.  overall- tasty

Delicious!  I seasoned my fish with lemon pepper and pressed fresh garlic, and left the lemon out, so that we could squeeze our own onto individual portions, but left the rest of the recipe as is.  This is a great way to prepare trout---it comes out tender and juicy.  Wow!  My only regret is that I didn't add more jalapenos.  Yum!

I used whole trout, stuck sliced lemon and the jalepenos in the body cavity, and then layered more sliced lemons on each side of the fish before wrapping the fish up whole and grilling.  I have to say that one whole trout a piece was a lot of food, but it tastes good and it's healthy so you don't mind.  I would say that the heat from the jalepenos was a bit much for my 2 year old but just right for this 30+ year old Texan!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I have not cooked fish very often, and I tried this recipe and it came out perfect!  I made it with flounder, and the lemon and jalepenos gave the fish such a great flavor.  I will definitely make this again!

I think the recipe is really good, but the pepper is a bit much.  In fact, I think that it would be better to cut the pepper, jalepeno, lemon and garlic salt in half so that you can taste the fish.  My mouth is BURNING!! But it is definitely worth making again.

We really liked this!  Seeded, the jalepenos give the fish a great flavor without making it too spicy.  The peppers are even mild enough to eat after cooking.  Maybe add a few extra spices to enhance the natural flavor, but overall, very simple and really tasty!  It even looks pretty!

This was WONDERFUL!!!! I thought the jalepenos would make it too spicy for me but it added just the right flavor. I just picked them off before I ate it. The lemon slices also gave it great presentation. The fish was flaky and the flavor was explosive.

I could never cook fish right until I found this recipe.  I always dried it out.  With this recipe, the fish is always so beautifully cooked and moist.  Now I use it as my standard and experiment with all different flavorings, while keeping the "foil method".  Thanks for an incredible recipe!

This was awesome!!  Next time I will make way extra.  Our kids were begging for more, and disappointed that it was gone.  Great favor!
