This pie is amazing!  I brought it to a friend's house last night and it was a hit!  The only thing I changed was I used 4 Granny Smith apples and 4 McIntosh apples.  I like the different textures of the apples and the sweet and tart.  It is a beautiful pie!  I also used store bought pie crust because I didn't have time to make home-made.  I will definitely make this pie again!

FANTASTIC! There is a few steps here, but it's really easy to put together. I used non-stick foil in place of the wax paper, and that worked perfectly. The family devoured this pie...it's a keeper, for sure~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

The pie was relatively easy. I just need to remember to use a pie tin with straight walls opposed to angled.  Also I forgot that I would have to turn it upside down so I topped the apples... Overall, the pie was wonderful!

delicious! Took a bit to make, but worth the effort. Made the crust, refrigerated while cutting up apples and making sauces.    Used 1/3 c white sugar in filling. Used jonathan apples, about 9 small ones. Used parchment paper. Baked up really nice in about 65 min 350F.

Tastes excellent. I used parchment paper and the homemade crust took forever to cook.

The only change was I used pre-made rolled pie crusts! This was delicious! We almost ate all the apples before they even got into the pie; definitely ensure you peel and slice extra apples if you have "helpers" wandering through your kitchen. Do be sure to turn the pie within that 15-40 minute window. I waited about 80 minutes and it was tricky to remove the waxed paper. Absolutely will make this again.
