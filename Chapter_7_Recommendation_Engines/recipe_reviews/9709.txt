Very good cookie that manages to be very chocolatey and at the same time rather light.  I added about half a teaspoon of cinnamon and really enjoy the flavor.  I also used chopped white chocolate chips instead of the grated chocolate, just because it's all I had on hand, but probably won't do that again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Okay, so.  First thing's first: this recipe is a one-serving recipe.  Should be obvious from the measurements that it doesn't make many (I only got 8 cookies out of it; you could maybe squeeze a full dozen if you made them very small), but you do NOT want to share these. If you have anyone else in the house, double the recipe.

Now, I'm guessing that you (like me) are a woman at a certain time of the month, needed chocolate, had no cookies in the house, and really didn't want to go out at this hour, so the rest of this review is written as between-us-ladies.

Skip melting the butter in a saucepan unless you really want to clean another thing today.  Use a microwave safe bowl to make this recipe in (it's small; a cereal bowl will do in place of your stainless steel mixing bowl, I promise), and just melt the butter in the microwave.  The subtle nutty flavour imparted by brown butter will be buried under chocolate and vanilla anyway.

Oh, and that butter does not need to be soft. Hack it off the frigid block you pulled from the back of the fridge and melt away.  Use a tablespoon to do the hacking: it'll let you eyeball about the correct amount (close is good enough), and has the bonus of being violent and letting you fantasize about disembowelling whoever wronged you today.

Use parchment paper on your cookie sheet. If you don't have any, use regular white printer paper (it's only 300 degrees, the kitchen won't burst into flames).  These buggers are delicious but they'll stick,

I used these to decorate a banana pudding.  They looked very nice but some could have been a little crisper.  Probably my fault for not baking long enough.

really nice flavor and look.  I used whole wheat flour and it worked just fine.  I also omitted the chocolate shavings because I was out, but they were fine without them, though probably even better with more chocolate.  Just crunchy enough, just chewy enough.  I may use this recipe to make decorative cookies to top cakes and other recipes.

So quick and easy make. Very tasty! I was craving something chocolate and these hit the spot perfectly. I doubled the recipe since it seemed like it make a small amount of cookies. I am glad I did.  I will make these again. They taste great without the extra shredded chocolate.

I was really surprised by these cookies: by the ingredients, by the method, by the texture of the batter, and by the result. Mostly pleasantly surprised. I had an egg white to use up and that's how I stumbled across this recipe. I found the batter to be rather liquid, which contradicts another review on here. Dropped by 2 teaspoons yielded 11 cookies. They were good, best eaten straight out of the oven. My only change was to use bittersweet chocolate shavings since I didn't have unsweetened. I baked them on a silpat and they came off just fine. I'm not sure if I will separate an egg just to make this recipe, but if I find myself with one lonely egg white, I'll attempt this again. Nice small portions and as someone mentioned, the cookies feel light so it's easy to eat half the batch.

Followed the recipe exactly. Had a hard time getting them off my baking sheet. Extreme chocolate.
