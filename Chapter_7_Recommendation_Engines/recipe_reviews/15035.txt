I make a lot of granola and was searching for a new recipe when I stumbled on this one.  It sounds so good, yet I knew after reading some of the reviews, it needs some changes. So this is what I did and it came out crunchy:  Oven temp should be set at 275. The nuts should be "chopped" using food processor then combine in large mixing bowl with Old Fashioned Oats, they are more nutritious than Quick Cooking oats. Puree bananas along with chopped dates, and 1/4 cup honey together in food processor.  Combine brown sugar and water and cook in microwave for about 3 minutes or until sugar is completely dissolved.  To it add vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mix this brown sugar syrup into oats & nuts.  Then stir in the pureed banana, date & honey mixture. At this point, I added about 1/2 cup coconut, completely optional. Stir until thoroughly mixed then spread granola onto 2 large cookie sheets (I lay waxed paper on the sheets & spray with Pam for no-stick & no mess). Press granola slightly onto the sheet to clump. Place each sheet on it's own rack in the oven & rotate half way through baking time.  Bake for 1-1/2  to 2 hours  or until golden and crunchy, stirring occasionally. When mixture comes out of the oven, I added dried cranberries, cherries, & apple slices. When granola is completely cooled, store in airtight container.

Absolutely wonderful.  Had everyone guessing at the ingredients and eating it as a snack food.  I added the sliced almonds and a cup of coconut with the oats and first mixture and toasted/dried them together and it worked well.  I also added 1/4 cup of honey because of the extra ingredients and to get a pinch of honey flavor. A+++++++++ in my book and a definate keeper.  What a way to use old bananas too!!!  Tip don't put too muck on a pan if you want a dryer or toastier taste keep it single layer.

I too added coconut, almonds and 1/4 cup honey to the recipe before I cooked.  I cooked it for close to three hours to get the desired crunch.  I added dried apples and cherries.  My kids (8,5,3,2)love it for a snack.  Not too sweet and very good for them.  I will make this again.  Thank you.

I love this recipe.  We're never without a batch on hand!  I like to substitute honey for the brown sugar but both are good.  This recipe is so flexible!  I also add allspice and cloves for extra flavour.  If you're using the packaged dates, which are harder than fresh dates but more available, I cook them in a saucepan with about a 1/2 cup of water (or more if needed) for a few minutes until they soften.  I add coconut & lots of chopped almonds as a standard.  So good!

This is a great granola recipe.  It could use a touch more brown sugar.  My husband and kids ate it for their snack, right out of the container.  
Tip:  When laying it in the pan, use your hands and squeeze with each handful.  That will create nice chunks of granola.  Easier for snacking.

This granola is one of the best that I have tried.  My family loved it!  It was gone in one day.  Everyone was a little skeptical that the banana's would have too strong a flavor... but you didn't even know they were a key ingredient. I recommend this recipe highly.

This is a great granola recipe.  I made my first batch a couple weeks ago and have eaten it everyday since then.  I was looking for a recipe with no oil and this fit that bill.  I did not use the dates because I didn't have any so I ended up using 3 bananas.  Other than that, i stayed true to the recipe.  I think the granola got better with time.  It's not super sweet.  I really don't taste the banana either.   I made more today and have added extra vanilla and cinnamon to fit my tastes. This granola is just pure and wonderful. So glad it's the first recipe I tried.

What a great recipe and so easy too!  I've been looking for a recipe that didn't include oil.  This one tastes really good.  Try adding in fresh fruit like peaches or berries.  I added crushed pineapple and cranberries.  Enjoy!

I absolutely love this granola.  I don't like overly sweet food, and this had just right amount of sweetness.  I ended up adding much less nuts.  I was also worried about molding, so I kept it in the freezer.  This granola over plain yogurt was one of the few things I wanted to eat at all before my wedding.  I will make it again soon.  Thank you Susan!

Excellent.  I exchanged dried apricots for the dates for a lighter colored granola.  For Christmas I'll add green pistachio nuts and dried cranberries.  When using almonds, I substitute almond flavor for the vanilla.  I think dried fruit bits are tasteless (they don't really have the flavor of the food they once were) so I add cheaper raisins after cooking, so they are not as hard as hockey pucks.

I found this granola VERY dry and with an overwhelming banana flavor. It also never got crunchy.

This granola is really good. It's a great base for any mix of nuts and fruits. I really enjoyed it. I added 3/4 cup of brown sugar and I poured honey over the granola when it was on the baking sheet, prior to baking it. Just a suggestion.

This granola is GREAT!  I toasted the almonds, added flaked coconut, dried blueberries, cranberries and apricots.  My husband loves it too!  The smell is even to die for.  It took about 2 hours with stirring every 15 min to get crunchy.  Very Yummy!

I have difficulty making granola.  It's probably some genetic defect.  I cooked this too long trying to get some crunch.  It went from soggy to wooden.  I found the flavors very bland.  I'm for cooking with as little refined sugars as possible, but this needed more.  I added honey and about 1/2 cup brown sugar and the fruit flavors perked. I clearly need some training regarding granola.

This granola is absolutely wonderful!  Plus, it's super healthy!  I do make some changes to suit our taste ... I use three bananas and leave out the dates and dried mixed fruit (just use raisins.) I increase the cinnamon to 2 tsp. and add 1 tsp. salt.  The rest of the recipe I follow as listed.  It takes 1 hr. 45 min. at 250 degrees.  Make it once and you won't be able to live without always having some on hand!!!!

I was looking for an alternative to the gourmet granolas that you find at grocery stores.  This is a great recipe and it is very flexible to ammendments.  I didn't use 8 full cups of the oats, as I wanted a clumpier granola.  I did add a bit of maple syrup thinking that it may need a binding agent, but I am not sure that it is neccesary.  The first time I made it I cooked it for 2 hours simply because everybody suggested so.  The second time I only cooked it for 1 1/2 hours and it is perfect as it does dry out and harden up a bit as it cools.

No dates, so used total 1 c mashed bananas.  Also used agave nectar instead of sugar.  Not terribly flavorful - maybe needs a tsp salt.  Also a bit chewy.  Not my favorite granola recipe, but it used up some overripe bananas in a new way.

I LOVE this granola recipe!  It's easy to adjust according to what you have or what you like.  I love that it uses no oil, keeping the fat content lower than traditional granola.  I usually substitute organic prunes for the dates and use whole raw almonds, coarsely chopped.  I add the almonds to the granola mix and bake it all together.  I've made this granola many times, and every once in a while, it doesn't get dry/crunchy enough.  When that happens (maybe due to humidity in the house, or water content of fruit mixture), I just re-bake it for a while the next day (or turn off the oven and leave it in there to cool, which dries it out a bit more.)  Thank you for such a versatile, healthful recipe! Update:  I have substituted prunes, raisins, dried cranberries, or a combination for the dates with good results.  Any dried fruit would do, I think.  Also, for added sweetness, I sometimes use apple juice instead of the water.

Great texture, really tasty.  Used regular (not quick) oats and more cinnamon.  Finished granola was equal parts oat mixture and mixture of raisins, dried cranberries, and toasted halved almonds.  Keeps well.

Thank you Susan, this is a wonderful recipe, will never buy boxed again!  I would recommend taking at least 5 minutes to mix the dry and wet ingredients together for the best texture and distribution of flavors.  I also prepare it on parchment lined tins in a 250 degree convection bake oven, and stir it with a spaghetti fork, works for me. Keeps fresh and crunchy in rubbermaid containers in the freezer too.  Just love it!

I add extra bananas and more spices and double the dried fruit. Then I serve them in martini glasses and top with plain vanilla yogurt, blueberries, and slivered almonds. A great brunch dessert!!

awesome. i cut back the nuts and added more fruit. i do think that the 250 cooking time is ok. if the temp goes higher, the granola will brown more...

I was looking for a lowfat/no fat granola. This fits the bill! I reduced the oats and added some wheat germ which toasts nicely. It is not so sweet that it's addictive, but is very delicious as a snack or breakfast. Definitely a keeper!

This is very delicious! I have been searching for a long time for an oil-free recipe that actually tastes good. This one is simple, not too sugary, but not tasteless or too much like masticating tree bark! I did add a bit more spice, cloves and ginger in addition to the cinnamon, and a bit of honey and coconut as per a few of the reviews. I like it a lot! I will be making this again.

Awesome. This was the best breakfast change I have made to my diet. Fiber is a good thing, and this really keeps you full. I am making my second batch with just a little more cinnamon and a little more brown sugar, but the first round was right on the money, the recipe needs nothing accept tweaking to your own taste. This will be breakfast everyday for the rest of my life, thank you.

This granola is totally addictive.  I added about a cup of chopped almonds, and about 1 cup of each dried cherries, dried apricots and raisins.  I cooked it 2hrs, stirring every 15-20 minutes.   I also used equal parts of banana and prunes, not dates, and added some coconut.  YUM!  You can add exactly the type of add-ins that you like!  it also keep for a very long time in a Ziplock bag.  I'm not the type of person who eats the same thing every day, so I've had my last batch for at least 4 weeks now and it's still just as delish as it was on day 1.

My first attempt making homemade granola was guided by this recipe. I liked the idea of using mashed fruit in place of oil. (I had figs on hand, so I used those in place of dates and added more brown sugar.) Since I had enough for two batches, I baked the first batch as written. The granola browned on the edges but seemed to be getting hard not crispy. There's a difference. For the second batch, I simply mixed in 1/4 cup of canola oil and baked it at 275, checking on it every 10 min. It turned a rich brown color and was crispy and perfect!

After reading the reviews, I thought that I would give this a try. I twicked the recipe alittle bit, by adding alot of honey,probably about 1 cup. I perfer a sweeter granola. One of the reviews said to cook at 275, I would NOT recommended that, it cooks faster than its suppose to, my first batch came out really browned, while the second batch came out perfect at 250 degrees. Also, I stirred it in  intervals of 15 minutes for the first two times, than switched down to every 10 minutes. Took only 1 hour for me. Granola has a banana flavor, but its not strong. I also added cranraisins and almonds. All in all, its pretty good, husband said it was chewy, maybe I didn't cook it long enough, but was pretty tasty.

Excellent recipe! I accidentally used sweetened coconut instead of plain, but it was still good, just a little sweeter. I also didn't have wheat germ so I replaced it with oat bran. I mixed this granola (about 1 Cup) with 8 oz of plain yougurt and about 1/2 cup of thawed stawberries cut up. SO GOOD! Thanks for sharing.

We eat granola almost every day.  This recipe is great, and low in refined sugar.  We do not care for dates, so I substitute "Craisins" dried cranberries. This has become the standard for granola in our house. My teenage daughter takes a baggie of this everyday to high school.  Her friends squeal with delight when she brings "That oatmeal stuff" to share!
Thanks for a great, healthy recipe!

This is the best granola recipe I have ever found!! I love the fact there is no oil added like other granolas instead it used dates and bananas to bind the oats together. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

Good banana flavor, no fat recipe.  After reading others' comments, I made sure mine was "crunchy."  I doubled the brown sugar and baked at 300 degrees for 50-60 minutes (stirring every 15 mins).  Also, I added coconut and walnuts about halfway through the baking so they would be toasted, too.  Added 1 cup each of raisins and dried cranberries.

I followed the directions and used the suggestions from the top rated reviews using flax seed, 1 cup chopped mixed fruit (cranberries, cherries, raisins (golden & regular) and blueberries, and definitely add  3/4 cup coconut. Bake at 275 degrees for 1 1/2 hours stirring half way through. A superior product.

YUM! This is my first time making granola and it turned out great! I did add honey and wheat germ before baking and ended up adding more honey and brown sugar after it was done baking to sweeten it up a little more :)

I added a little xtra honey and just a table spoon of corn syrup to make up for the extra wheat germ and oat bran I tossed in. I doubled the suggested nut and fruit amounts. Wouldnt be able to tell it was healthy.

This is not a recipe for someone looking for sweet granola.  At first, I thought adding the banana would make it taste too bananaish, but it doesn't. I stirred the granola every 7 min. for about 70 min. At the end I added slivered almonds, rasins and pecans. Also, before I baked it I added 1/4 cup of weat germ and 1/4 cup of wheat bran.

Excellent!  I love that there is no added fat.  I also am not a big fan of nuts, so I just added dried cranberries, so that keeps the fat content even lower.  Very good with soy milk for breakfast!  Thanks.

This was really good granola!  smells like banana bread when it's baking, but it did take longer than recipe says to get crunchy.  my one roommate (who is extreeeemely picky about food) ate half the bag in one day!  i added dried mixed fruit, raw chopped walnuts, slivered almonds, and sesame seeds after.

This was a good granola recipe, but it was somewhat lacking in flavor in my opinion.  Even with the full amount of vanilla added, I felt it was still a little bland.  I really like the fact that there is no oil or butter in this...making it extra healthy.  I left out the almonds and used 1 package of fruit bits.  I only had a little more than 5 cups of oatmeal and it turned out just fine.  I plan on serving this over yogurt and pancakes for breakfast. Thanks for sharing.

very nice! I didn't have quick oatmeal and used a 2 porridge mixes (one 'crushed' version and one not crushed) and it turned out very tasty. I left it in the oven for abt 3 hours though cause it didn't get crunchy too well. The next morning though it turned out to be very crunchy, which it still is in yoghurt/milk. YUM!

I made the servings smaller, since it was just for me. I used apple instead of banana, and put in honey, cloves, nutmeg, and extra cinnamon as someone suggested. I bumped the oven temperature to 300, and cooked for 40 minutes stirring every 15 minutes. Came out perfect!

This makes a very bland granola with very little flavor.  It seems to me that the ratio of ingredients is off - but based on other reviews maybe it's just my preference.  To save this large batch I added 1/4 cup of veg. oil, maple syrup and dissolved 1/4 cup more of brown sugar in hot water and mixed it to the granola mixture after an hour of baking.  I baked it for an additional 30 minutes and I think it tastes much better.

Great recipe. Been making this for over a year. My family eats a batch in a week. Love the sweetner of bananas and dates, I replace the the brown sugar with date sugar. If I slack off and don't make it for a week, my loved ones quickly remind me. Depending on availability and economy, I sometimes boil date pieces in the water to soften them up first. They work equally well.

I loved it.  This is by far the best granola recipe ever. I added a little extra dates and 1/4 cup corn syrup (it gave the granola some clusters) I love the date and banana flavor.  This one is a keeper. I will make it again and again.

I've made this several times since getting the recipe.  It is great!  Not a recipe I would allow children to make unless they have a lot of supervision (reason for my lower kid friendly rating); however, my kid --- an over 25 male --- loves it --- so does my husband.

I love mixing all kinds of nuts and I add choc chips. Walnuts are Awesome because they are a softer nut versus the Famous almonds. Peanuts are nice touch too.

Delicious granola! Hubby said that it is better than any granola bought at the store! We love it; I especially love the fact that it is naturally sweetened! This will definitely become a staple in our home.

As written, this recipe needs way more flavor and sweetness (as other reviewers have mentioned). But it's a good start, and I like the fact that there is no oil in this recipe. I increased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and also added 1/4 cup honey as per all the other reviews. In my opinion it still needed more sweetness, so the next time I make this I will increase brown sugar to 3/4 cup as per another review.  I also chopped my nuts in the food processor prior to adding to the Oats (old fashioned oats). I pureed the bananas with the honey. I baked mine at 255 degrees since my oven does tend to take longer; and I baked for two hours stirring every 20 minutes. This worked for my oven. Granola was crunchy and slightly browned. It had a slight banana flavor that was not overpowering. It was quite nice. I will definitely continue to use this recipe with my alterations to bump up the flavor.

I added cashews for the nuts, and honey instead of brown sugar. Yum! Definitely will be in my recipe book!

Pretty good but be sure to go with the other reviews-needs a little more brown surgery or honey.  Love that there is no oil!

This  is  a fantastic no fat granola recipe. It's perfect for snacking, or eating as a cereal.  I lined the baking sheets with non-stick foil for easy clean up. I have made this twice and will absolutely make it again.

Amazing!  Love the hint of banana.  I used bakeable stevia and a little agave syrup to lower calories.  Yum!

This is my daily treat mixed with yogurt. Since it has no oil, it's calorie count is much less than other granolas. Yay

This is perfect for topping my yogurt or taking on a trail ride.  It is very low sugar, gluten free and no added fat. Hard to find this combo in store bought without paying an arm and a leg  I added some craisins,  chopped walnuts and raisins but it would easily take any additional nuts or fruits or candy to make it a high energy trail mix.

I thought this was a bit too dry and pasty tasting.  It does get cruchy, but you have to bake it a long time.  I like that it uses bananas and dates (although I used prunes instead).  I think I will try to incorporate them into other granola recipes that use oil.
