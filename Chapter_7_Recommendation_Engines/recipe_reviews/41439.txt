I took a small bite after mixing it with the pasta and threw it out.  Waste of ingredients I bought especially for this recipe.  Terrible.

Got great reviews with the family.  A good dish and not a whole lot of work.  Be sure to de-bone the canned salmon!  (I didn't realize it came with bones.)  Feel free to add more of an ingredient according to your taste.  A little extra blue cheese as topping would be a bonus.

I made this the other night and the only thing I would suggest is to go for fresh salmon when you make it, and be prepared to use extra Parmesan cheese to keep the sauce from getting too soupy.  Other than that it was delicious and there weren't any leftovers!

I did not care for the Blue Cheese on top of Salmon. Also canned salmon is disgusting.
