This frosting is fun to make- watch out when you add the baking soda! It's almost like a pudding very good and not too sweet.

The previous reviewer must have done something wrong because this recipe was wonderful. It worked well with a sweeter cake as it's not very sweet itself. It will be used again!

I'm sorry to say I don't much care for this frosting. It's got very little flavor no sweetness at all and has the consistency of congealed pudding. I needed to pipe it so I put it in a bowl to cool (with some cling wrap pressed against the surface since like a pudding it started forming a skin immediately). I got impatient and put it in the pastry bag hot (thank you Ove Glove) and it was good I did that because as it cooled it turned into cement that was impossible to force though my large star tip. I'm not saying that this was horrible but it just wasn't good.

This didn't work very well for me. I used skim milk and I wonder if I used 2% or whole milk if it would have worked better. It was pudding-like on top and runny on the bottom. When I stirred it there were clumps. It did taste good so I still used it since it was just for home but I won't make this again.

If it walks like chocolate pudding and talks like chocolate pudding it must be chocolate pudding not fudge!

Yes this ended up tasting exactly like chocolate pudding. However I liked that it wasn't too sweet. People with poor reviews probably didn't follow the recipe correctly. The amount of thickeners and liquids needs to be exact. I used a hand powered mixer to stir at every listed time and the consistency was spot on. This was a great icing for my "wanted-a-not-too-sweet-for-snacks" cake. I made it on the black magic cake recipe. Worked well.
