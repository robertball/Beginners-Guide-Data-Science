These were great.  I didn't use the white onions in the marinade.  I threw in a packet of Knorr's "Hot and Spicy Bake Mix" that I found at an international market.  After I took the wings from the marinade, I poured the liquid into a sauce pan and boiled it down until it got thick and syrupy.  I used it to baste the wings.  I loved these wings.  My husband liked them too, but he still prefers my own chicken wing recipe.

This recipe is always a hit.  I always marinate overnight and cook them longer than listed.  After the scheduled cooking time, I drain any liquid from the pan and cook until the wings look a little crispy.

I made these for a family gathering over the Columbus Day weekend. I had never made them before so I thought I was taking a chance. My family couldn't eat these wings fast enough! Both my sisters asked for the recipe and my Dad(who is pickier than a 3 year old) keeps asking me to make these again! You won't be disappointed! This recipe is a keeper!

This was absolutely delicious!  My kids LOVED it, and they are picky!  For my husband and myself, I used the left over marinade and cooked it down slowly, and added hot chili paste and some red pepper flakes for our dipping sauce because we like it spicy.  THe sauce is delicious and amazing over rice and/or veggies.  I did take advice from other reviews and made sure to add as much b.sugar as soy sauce (1/2 Cup of brown sugar, not white).  Thanks so much for an easy, delicious marinade that makes everyone in my house HAPPY!!

We halved the recipe, omitted the regular onions and added 1-2T of honey.  I fried the chicken wings then added to the liquid mixture on the stove top.  Keep turning until it caramelizes and enjoy.  I'm sure it would be great as written too!  This is now my favorite chicken wing recipe until I try the next one.  HAHA

Wow!  These were amazing!  The smell of the marinade was incredible, and they were awesome!  I made these for a Grey Cup (Canadian Superbowl) party and they were a huge hit.  I can't wait to try this marinade with other types of meat.  I think it would be great on pork chops.

Delicious! First time I've ever made a marinade for chicken that actually made the chicken really tasty. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

These are very easy and tasted good. My sons both ate them up, although I thought they were a bit bland. Thanks though.

Good basic recipe though I would marinate it longer (had it in for 4 hours and it just didn't absorb as much as it could).  Would recommend using brown sugar instead.  Overall, a good recipe with some tweaks.

These were good but not as flavorful as I thought they would be. Next time I try them I will try marinating overnight instead of the 2 to 3 hours. I served this with Pad Thai from a box.

I used light soy sauce but this still came out a little too salty for my taste....I will try it again and maybe increase the sugar? It was good though.

I prepared chicken thighs as opposed to wings to make it more of an entree, and the marinade turned out excellent. It was a bit salty for my tastes, but definitely still very good! I will make this one again.

I'm pretty sure this was perfectly awesome; I'm going to have to do another stack to be sure as I burnt these in the process of trying to get them right crispy.  Anywho, changes include--had no green onions on hand, so they were out.  Also felt lazy and didn't want to chop onion.  Dashed onion powder in instead.  It's too bad I burned so much of the flavor out because the marinade smelled *amazing*.

This was great! I did not use white onions because I was lazy. I boiledthe marinade and based the wings before turning and then again the last 5 minutes. Cook temp and time were perfect! I used a broiler pan lined with tinfoil and the top grates prayed with Pam, cleanup was a snap.

I didn't like these wings. Not very flavorful for all the ingredients. Ended up broiling these for a few minutes because they did not crisp up just baking.

Awesome! I was only able to marinate for an hour (hungry husband came home early); but dee-lish! I trim the skin and fat off my wings before baking, and this recipe really worked with that
