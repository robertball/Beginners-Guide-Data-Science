I've been cheating.  I've been using a lot of wonderful recipes on this site, and never take the time to share my reviews.  Well, this one did it.  Had two loaves of french bread left over from a family party and thought what the heck can I do with these before they go hard.  Looked up "french bread" under the ingredients search engine, and wa-la...this amazing recipe.  My 17 year old son, said I need to open up a restaurant that serves only these sandwiches.  Thanks to this site I've gone from being a mediocre cook and pretty much the laughingstock amongst my circle of friends, to the "go to" girl when they are looking for a recipe or cooking advice.  Thanks!

This is delicious, if a bit time consuming.  Also, it dirties several dishes but it does turn out to be worth it.  I forgot about the reviews suggesting marinara sauce; I do think it would be good with that but I also think it was good without it.  I used all sausage bc I didn't have ground beef and next time I'd add more fennel bc I LOVE fennel and when I tasted the fennel it was an awesome combo.  Thanks for the recipe!

Skipped the ground beef & used a whole lb of bulk pork sausage (HOT!!! - or mild & add crushed red pepper flakes), also added caraway seed. Stuffed the mix into hollowed out Schwans prebaked frozen french loaves. (I feed the birds with the bread removed rather than put it in the mix, this also eliminates the need for a food processor/blender.) Delish, quick, & easy.

It was pretty good. Husband said it could be a 5 star, but he's not sure what to change to make it that way! To me there was an overwhelming flavor of mustard, though the husband didn't notice that. Had to switch out the mozzarella for Cheddar, not sure if that affected it or not. Probably not, as we like Cheddar better than mozzarella. I'd make this again if the husband requested it, but I'd reduce the mustard and maybe add some hot pepper flavor from somewhere for us, and/or a few dashes of Italian seasoning. Thanks for the recipe! EDIT 4/10/10: Even though this still needs modifications to make it outstanding, I'm giving it 5 stars because on day 2 I could NOT get enough of the leftovers. What had initially seemed like a strong mustard flavor mellowed overnight and became divine.

Really yummy. I left out the onion, sausage and fennel. Added in ketchup, worchestire, italian seasoning, garlic powder, thyme and red pepper flakes. You can really change this recipe up any way you want. The bread turned out nice and crunchy. Will be making again. UPDATE: Made this again using chicken breast. I boiled three breast in water for 20 minutes over medium heat. Then chopped up and threw in my food processor. Then combined the chicken, cheese, an egg, some bread crumbs, teryaki sauce, red pepper flakes and s/p. Turned out awesome!

This is like a recipe from one of my Southern Living cookbooks.  The only difference in that recipe, is you cut of the ends of the loaf and cut out the insides using a long serrated bread knife.  Then you stuff the contents inside and secure ends back with toothpicks.  It's a family favorite at our house!  Good with a cold cucumber-tomato salad and some chips!

This recipe is fabulous!!!! I used smoked sausage (casing removed and broken up) instead of bulk and I added fresh mushrooms while browning the meat. I didn't have any fennel so I left that out!!  We will make this again and again! So delicious and hearty!

It won rave reviews.  The only request was for a side of Marinara.  I agree.  I also found that tearing the bread instead of food processing was sufficient.  The portions could be increaded as the french bread was only 3/4 full.  But the most important thing was the taste which was awesome.

This was a great recipe.  I really enjoyed it.  I followed it exactly and my only complaint was that the foil caused the bottom of my bread to burn.  Maybe my oven temp. is off, but I'll be sure to turn it down a little next time.  A side of marina is a great addition.

This was ok, but it didn't have the wow taste I was hoping for. Pretty bland, even when we dipped them in homemade marinara sauce.

This was just ok. Nothing to write home about. Used extra sharp cheese in place of mozzarella. Served with ranch for dipping.

This recipe is perfect for company. Make sure you don't skip the fennel seed. it gives the loaf that perfect bite.  I have used this as a cocktail nibble by using a narrow baguette - slicing the loaf into 1" thick slices and serving it with a homemade honey-mustart dip

Very good! I also added ketchup. We didn't have any minced garlic for the top so I used minced onion and it still tasted great! Served with soup! Will add this to the regular rotation.

I have never made anything like this before- and I am so glad I did. It was a huge hit with the family. I used turkey sausage and it was delicious. Also we dipped it in Trader Joes Marinara- dipping was the best part!

This is a great week night meal it is fast and easy and I usually have all of the ingredients on hand. My family loved it and has asked me to make it again so I think this one will go into the weekly rotation. Thanks for a great family budget friendly recipe!

Loved it!!!  I also left out the fennel, and also added chopped celery since I always have extra left over from other meals. I used extra mozarella cheese to line the french bread before putting it in the oven it turned out very cheesy and delicious. Definately serve with marinara but it is great without too!

Though I really liked this, the family was less than pleased.  Didn't have any sausage so I only used beef.  Added in more spices (like cayenne, mignonette pepper, etc). Less cheese, and omitted the butter step (save calories).   Oh, I had a small loaf of French Bread (half pound) and the full recipe mixture filled it nicely.

I cooked this a week ago for church supper and everyone loved it! (everyone called it a 'fancy' supper)I left out the fennel, but replaced it with basil. And used all pork. I made 2 loaves, but tripled the recipe and it worked out great. We've added this one to our menu at church!

Yum!  My fiance loved it.  I left out the fennel, used all ground beef and added some ketchup, worshteshire and chopped pickles.  We will definitely add this into the mix!  Thanks!
