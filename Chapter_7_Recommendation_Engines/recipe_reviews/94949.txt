This recipe is time consuming, uses several pots and pans, but was well worth the trouble.  I modified this recipe a bit by 1) adding chopped broccoli and zucchini to the mix, doubling the dry spices to accommodate the extra veggies, 2) adding some 2tsps chili spice and 2tbsp parsley, 3) using fat-free chicken broth rather than water  (this works for us since we are not vegetarians), and 4) mixing in 1/4c of parmesan cheese into the mashed potato mixture. I also sprayed the baking dish lightly with Pam and baked for 30 minutes before browning.  It rocked, my family loved it, and it tasted even better as leftovers for my workday lunch the following day!  Give it a shot if you have the time.

Very Tasty Recipe, I never made a vegetarian shepherd pie, just your normal with meat. I think I'll try it with some mushrooms next and other things. Will take picture next.

Made some adjustments, in part based on what I had on hand. Used zucchini and mushrooms instead of eggplant and bell pepper. Subbed veg. broth in place of the water, and added some salt and pepper to the vegetable mixture as it cooked. Used some leftover mashed potatoes I had in the freezer (made with russet potatoes, half and half, butter, salt and pepper--a recipe from Cook's Illustrated). I wondered if I had to cook the frozen peas before mixing them in with the mashed pototoes, but turned out I didn't--just mixed them in frozen and they came out fine. I mixed the parmesan cheese in with the potatoes and peas, and kept the whole thing in the oven about an extra 10 minutes--didn't do the broiler step. It was yummy. It does have an Indian taste, though, as another reviewer pointed out, and that might not be for everyone.

This dish was acceptable, however I probably won't make it again. I love both vegetarian food and Indian spices, but I thought the flavor of curry powder was overwhelming and a little one dimensional. It would have been helpful for the recipe author to specify the blend of spices in her curry powder. Perhaps my blend didn't suit the recipe and that's why I didn't care for it. That said, it was easy to prepare and I liked the consistency. If I did make it again, I would probably stir some sour cream and chopped cilantro into the vegetable mixture to add another dimension to the flavor.

This was great! I'm slowly introducing my husband to vegetarian cooking, & this was one of the recipes he liked enough to stop complaining about the lack of meat.  We used zucchini instead of eggplant, but otherwise left it unchanged & it was very tasty.  It also made a huge batch-- we were eating leftovers for a while.  Will be making this one again.

Made few subs to be a vegan meal (soy milk & veggie parmesan for mashed potatoes). Stirred veggie-parm into mashed potatoes. Took some of the review suggestions and added a chopped carrot, little less curry, and few extra spices. The veggie part of the pie was amazing - and totally rocked as leftovers the next few days! My kids wouldn't touch it, but I think that was due to onions chopped too big. Husband, who prefers meat in everything, said it was good. My vegan Dad raved about it. Definitely good meal for vegans/vegetarians who don't miss the meat. ;)

LOVE this! I challenged my husband, who does all the cooking, to try a meatless January. He made this last night and it was a hit. Even my fussy teenager ate it. He did make a few adjustments. We didn't have eggplant or bell pepper. He added about three ounces of soy crumbles for texture. I suggested the addition of cauliflower next time to highlight the Indian character of the dish. There are plenty of other ways to customize this recipe. Bottom line - YUM!

Perhaps I did something wrong, but I thought this recipe was quite bland and I even added vegetable broth instead of water, and sour cream and cottage cheese to my mashed potatoes.  All I could taste was the curry/cumin.  Next time I will probably try it with beans and mushrooms on the bottom layer, then veggies in the middle and potatoes on the top without the curry and cumin... and extra garlic.

Wow. I was surprised how much I liked this! I thought the curry would be weird in a shepherd's pie, but the flavors went together nicely. I'll definitely be making this again!

We're not fans of eggplant so we skipped it and substituted 2C cubed zucchini and 1C frozen grilled corn instead. Just to use it up, I threw in some leftover soy beef crumbles which added some texture. We also skipped the Parmesan cheese on top.   This is such a good recipe and we're making it again today, in fact!

I love curry, eggplant, mashed potatoes and Parmesan. Unfortunately, even with the extreme amounts of curry powder and cumin, this was really bland. I had to add a bunch of Costa Rican Salsa Lizano to make it enjoyable.

It was good but it was a little bland. I would reccomend more salt, pepper, and cumin. Also, mixing in some fresh cilantro or basil would probably be good. I added mushrooms and carrots to this dish and used fresh tomatoes instead of canned (maybe where the lack of salt came from) which I highly reccomend. I will definitely make this again, but with more seasonings.

I loved this recipe with a minor adjustment. I substituted 2 zucchini and 1 can of black beans for the eggplant. This is the second vegetarian Shaphard's Pie I have tried and this one is  definitely    the better of the two.

I used the recipe as a jumping off point to use up what's on-hand: leeks, mushrooms, frozen mixed vegetables, crumbled boca burgers, tomato sauce plus all the seasonings in one pot. Used sour cream, cheddar and canned fried onions in mashed potatoes. The result was mighty tasty! It held together nicely and had loads of flavor.

I was really excited about this recipe and it sounded really good but the finished product kind of tasted weird.  I'm not sure the mashed potatoes (with butter and milk) mesh very well with the curry-flavored veggies.  Or maybe the parmesan caused a problem.  I'm not sure.  All I know is that the combination tasted a little like throw up.  I hate to say it.  Sorry.

Yum! Followed the recipe to a T except for browning under the broiler...I skipped that step. I've made this at least a dozen times and it never disappoints.

This turned out to be fantastic!  I used veggie stock instead of water, added zuccini & mushrooms, used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and added a couple more herbs like oregano.  This was so delicious, I will definately make it again.

This recipe is delicious! I used African curry, so there was a good level of smokey heat. I added a cup of chopped baby bella mushrooms and used regular half and half.  I will definitely make it again.

This is a delicious recipe, you can cut back alittle on the spices if you want to. I added portabella mushrooms chopped to the second set of veggies cooked in the pan. Next time I will use frozen corn instead of peas in the potatoes, not everyone was a pea lover. I think the frozen peas or corn work better because they do not mush when you stir them into the hot mashed potatoes. Also, I did clean the potatoes well and cut out any eyes and then was able to leave the skin on the potatoes.

Left out the curry but it turned out really great! I'll figure out a protein source next time!

Jean - great recipe, especially for the lenten season. For more flavor, we added oregano and parsley, substituted chicken broth for the water and added zucchini. Here's a twist - my husband grabbed the cinnamon instead of the cumin and it came out great!

This recipe could have been good but it was lacking in some areas. The egplant/veggie mix didn't have much flavor and what flavor it did have, in our opinion, wasn't right for the dish. But a vegetarian might enjoy this dish more.

i think the name shepard's pie is a little deceiving, this is a great dish! it's more like an indian casserole? curried vegetables with a deconstructed samosa on top (ie. potatoes and peas)! my husband and i loved this dish! and i will definitely make it again. i followed the recipe to the letter and i wouldn't change a thing.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone that tried it loved it and some even asked for the recipe. It came out very well and is easy to make.
