the taste of coconut oil was over powering to this recipe, it also wasn't very sweet so I literally felt like I was eating a Fat Bomb but without any satisfaction to my taste buds or sweet-tooth

VERY simple to make. First fat bomb recipe I have tried, but I was satisfied. I can see how others might want to add more sweetener, but it was adequately sweet for my taste having been on keto a month. Nuts would be a nice variation. If your coconut oil has coconut flavor (some do) it makes for a nice chocolate-coconut flavor.

The 3/4 cup of coconut oil is too much. However, this is a great substitute for milk chocolate.

I'm Keto and have made this a couple of times and I really enjoy them as a fat bomb/treat.  I did add 1 1/2 teaspoons instant coffee crystals and 9 packages of Equal --  the coffee crystals enhance the chocolate -- I also like them a little sweeter.  It is quite sticky, so I use a small scooper and individually wrap them in plastic wrap and then freeze.

I am not LCHF or Keto but wanted to try this.  Quite tasty and filling.  I think some nuts would have been good in this

I am so glad I found fat bombs!  When I started on a keto diet I didn't know there was something that could take care of a chocolate craving.  This was the very first recipe I made when starting on the diet.  I didn't know you could melt coconut oil so the result was kinda lumpy but still good.
