This is very similar to my family's recipe. We do however add a few eggs to the ricotta cheese (to help hold the lasagna together) as well as some seasoning which is why one of the reviewers probably said the recipe was a little bland. Add black pepper some nutmeg (a pinch) some parmesan cheese and some fresh or dried parsley. In addition his sauce is a great starter. Cooking some meat in the sauce will yield a richer taste (if you eat meat). I bake some sausages in the oven to get rid of the excess oil then drop in the sauce to cook. These can be served on the side or cut up and added to the lasagna in slices. Same goes for meatballs.

WOW WOW WOW!!! I would give this 10 stars if I could. My mother made this recipe for my birthday party last night and it was amazing! My entire family (even the picky ones) raved over this. The only thing she changed was making one large casserole instead of two. We used some of the extra marinara sauce to dip the garlic bread in (I made Great Garlic Bread from this site). SO GOOD!! She let the sauce stand in the fridge for 2 nights so the flavors would really meld! Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe. It is now a family favorite.:)

Simply delicious! I added 1-1/2 lbs Italian sausage to the recipe after the sauce was cooked. The flavor was outstanding. The only thing I would have done differently was to make extra sauce to put on top of each piece when serving.

I used this recipe for the sauce only and the sauce gets five stars from me and yields plenty! I cooked in 1/2 pound of ground beef. Instead of crushed tomatoes I used diced but I pulsed it in batches in the food processor for a few one second pulses. I also uped the basil a bit. Awesome! Will use this sauce recipe again and again!

I went strickly by the recipe on this one (except for the wine I didn't have any). Although next time I will cut it in half it was a wonderful dish. My family(no kidding) ate it for a week. I was going to freeze it but they just kept eating it!! Definitely one I will make again!

This lasagna was decent but to me it was not worth the time that it takes to make it. I got compliments on the tomato sauce and it made the kitchen smell wonderful while i was making it but the dish as a whole was a little bit too bland and I didn't think that it tasted any better than sauce from a can.

Momma Mia! This is good sauce! I want to say - in the list of ingredients the wine is listed after the lasagna noodles. You really need to add that to the sauce a good hour or more before you even consider the sauce 'done". I added most of the Parmesan cheese to the ricotta filling (along with an egg) rather than just putting it all on top. I also did not pre-cook the lasagna noodles. Start with a layer of sauce noodles and then some more sauce and continue. With sauce on both sides of the noodles they cook up perfectly and your lasagna will not be runny. This makes a bunch - far more than the 12 servings stated. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us. We really enjoyed it.

Just okay. I picked this recipe because of the homemade sauce thinking it would be more flavorful than something from a jar. It was just okay though and it added a lot of extra work. I would probably look for a quicker recipe next time.
