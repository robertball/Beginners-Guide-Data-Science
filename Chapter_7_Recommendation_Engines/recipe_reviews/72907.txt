Delicious! We chopped the mint very finely and tossed it with the lime in with the melon (used cantelope).  Got lovely prosciutto di Parma which was less salty than others, and had a subtle rich flavor.  Trimmed off fat.  Followed another users advice and made a balsamic reduction into which we added ground anise, black pepper and a little chile oil for a slow and surprising heat to counter all the sweet.  Then, to continue with the Meditteranean theme, served alongside of Black figs paired with a locally made goat cheese (very delicate and chewy without the pungent goat flavor) and homemade crispy sweet potato fries.  Yummy!!!

I used the mint only as a garnish and secured the proscuitto with a tootpick. Also, used a combination of cateloupe and honeydew melon balls. Loved the sweet/salty combination.

I tried this recipe for New Year's Eve. The preparation was easy (although it took longer than I thought to cut the proscutto and wrap the melon balls) and the taste was good but by the time I served it to my guests it had gotten soggy even though it had been in the fridge. I would suggest serving this asap after preparing.

I too loved the sweet/salty juicyness! I cut my prosciutto into 3 skinny strips (lengthwise) & used just one strip per ball but I think it was still too much prosciutto. I think next time I will cut some off of the length of it (it won't go to waste...I'll add it to a sald or something) & leave just enough to wrap. I chopped the mint &  added it to the lime juice...using toothpicks to secure the prosciutto. I also used the larger end of the melon baller & wish I had made smaller balls. Mine were a little big to just pop in your mouth. I want to try this again as a side salad & not as an appetizer... I'll follow Caroline C. & chop the prosciutto instaed of wrapping.

I made this for Christmas Day and everyone raved about it. I don't have a melon baller so I just cut chunks of Honeydew Melon and Rockmelon. I placed a piece of fresh mint on each chunk of melon and wrapped in the prosciutto. As it's summer time in Australia at Christmas it was a perfect refreshing appetizer!

As I was just making this for my lunch today, I didn't bother at all with fancy presentation; I just sliced up the melon, roughly diced the prosciutto, and tossed them together with a light sprinkle of 'Lemon-Mint Vinegar.' It was so delicious! Thanks so much!

This is a dish I was often served in my 3 years living in Italy and I have to say never did they use mint... but it was interesting. I tried some mint on one and decided to leave it out. Superb after that!

If I ever make these again I will use imported prosciutto. I didn't care for the taste of the Boar's Head. Great appetizer for an Italian themed dinner!

I made this with West Texas "Pecos" catelope instead of honeydew and it was sweet & juicy wrapped in a suprememly salty layer of the prosciutto. The color combo was also  eye-catching with the sprig of mint topper.  A very elegant beginning at my upscale picnic.  Served with shrimp filled croissant sandwiches & wine.

I don't like it with honeydew melon. Tried it with the cantaloupe like others suggested. So yummy. Guests gobbled them up. You can really play with the presentation. I do a melon ball with a prosciutto bundle on a tooth pick or just sliced in cubed and wrapped in the prosciutto. Minus the honeydew i would give this recipe 5 stars.

I have made these several times and have never been disappointed.  Plus, they are different enough to impress others with their appearance and contrast in flavors.  Highly recommended.

With Prosciutto Ham being so expensive here in Thailand where I live, I didn't want any to go to waste.  So rather than wrap each melon ball individually, and maybe not get to use the little bits of ham leftover, I used Bamboo skewers to make Prosciutto e Melone Kebabs!  I uploaded my picture.  I think it looks great, for a first attempt.

I love these but you need GOOD prosciutto!  If it is too salty it ruins the dish.

One of my personal favorites.  I use cantaloupe and drizzle with a balsamic reduction.  It is always a hit.

A bumped-up version of a classic breakfast recipe I've had in Germany a few times. Pretty good. It's been well-recieved the couple times I've made it.

I just recently had these at a very fancy wedding. They served them for cocktail hour. My daughter's birthday party is coming up and these are on my list for the appetizers. Only change is the ones I tried were tarts. The little mini pastry tarts, that you can buy frozen at the grocery store, with a slice of imported prosciutto and a melon ball on top! They were absolutely divine and refreshing! The flavor contrasts were juicy, salty and with a bit of a crunch from the tart! 5 stars in book! I suggest only using imported prosciutto and not to put too much on them. You want it to equal flavors with the melon and not over power it.

I love this recipe.  It's easy and feels gourmet.   I don't even use a melon baller.  I just cut out pieces of melon, sprinkle with lime juice, wrap with prosciutto and then put a small mint leaf under and secure with a toothpick.  I may try to slice the melon thin and make it a roll one time.

I have enjoyed prosciutto melon balls many times, but this is the first time with fresh mint.  Delicious.

Paid a small fortune for prosciutto, but it was so delicious that it justified the expense.  Made this as a starter for a 70th birthday celebration for my husband, and everyone loved it!

I didn't have a melon baller so I attempted this with a spoon and it didn't work out quite right. It was easy enough to wrap it with prosciutto and stick a toothpick through it. The taste was great, two completely different tastes: spicy and sour so it was great.

Was excited to try this, but the taste didn't suit my family.
