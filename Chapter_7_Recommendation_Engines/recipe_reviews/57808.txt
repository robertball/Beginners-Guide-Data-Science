A few helpful hints with this recipe: Change oven temperature to 375 and bake covered for 25 minutes.  Then remove foil and bake another 20 minutes until golden brown.  I know many reviewers have had a problem with the bottom crust being soggy.  Here are some helpful hints to avoid that: If you choose to use the roasted peppers, pat them dry with a paper towel.  Be sure to get hard salami, not cooked salami.  Some deli meats, like ham, are too juicy, so try a different kind of ham - I've gotten apple/honey ham (it's dryer).  Let the pan cool for at least 15 minutes to allow the filling to set up.  For a nice presentation, I cut into squares and place them on a platter with paper doilies.  The paper doilies absorb some of the extra moisture on the bottom crust.  I hope this was helpful!  ENJOY! :)

YUM!!!!!!!!!!! I took these to a party and they were a MAJOR HIT!!!!  I spruced up the recipe a little bit after reading the reviews.  Once I spread the bottom crust in the pan, I covered it with a thin layer of sun dried tomato pesto and baked it for 6 minutes.  While that was baking I dried the roasted red peppers between 2 paper towels like others suggested, I also dried the ham that way too.  On the semi-baked bottom layer, I put a layer of prvolone, then salami, then ham, then pepperoni, then a layer of shredded mozzarella, then I sprinkled some garlic powder over all that.  I used 4 eggs and about 5-6 tablespoons of parmesan and put the top layer of crescent rolls on and used 1 more egg for an egg wash on the top of the dough.  I baked it at 375 for 20 minutes without foil, checked it and found it getting to be a little too brown and loosely tented it with foil for the last 25 minutes.  I let it cool in the pan for 30 minutes before cutting it.  I cut it into about 40 little pieces, held them together with toothpicks and served at room temp. They were THE HIT of the party and there was some good food there!!  Thanks for such a great recipe and all the good reviews!

Oh my goodness!  Followed previous advice about baking the bottom layer for 6 minutes, and that is all I changed.  Ranting and raving followed!  Great, unique snack for a get-together.  I didn't have the greasy problems that others have noted, and I made sure that the peppers drained on paper towels prior to making it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for a birthday party recently and my friends gave me rave reviews! Based upon previous reviewers comments I allowed the dough to warm before spreading. I also decided to add 1 teaspoon of garlic powder to the egg mixture which added just a hint of garlic. It was a little expensive when adding up all the deli meats and cheeses but definitely worth it. I gave it 4 stars because of cost and I felt it was only good, not unbelievable. If you are making this for 10 or more people I highly recommend doubling the recipe and making two dishes worth. When it comes to the cheese amounts I recommend getting 8-10 slices of each instead of going by weight as this will ensure you're able to cover the entire dish. I will probably not be making this again.

I am asked to make this recipe for nearly every gathering my family attends.
I do drain the red peppers VERY well and blot them with paper towels before putting them in the dish. 
I choose to use hard salami & deli sliced pepperoni.I also add American cheese and omit the parmesan.  I often prepare the night before. (First layer of cresent rolls, meats, and cheeses in a glass 9X13, cover with plastic wrap and put in fridge.)  This way all I have to do the day of the function is add the peppers, egg, top with crescent roll and bake.
Best thing about this dish, is it stays warm with minimal effort and is excellent served at room temp. Try it!

These are fantastic! I used the Garlic Butter crescent rolls & roasted my own red peppers, add some hot banana pepper rings & everyone loved these!I also used 4 eggs inside & 1 to brush on the top. The flavor was excellent hot, cold or room temp. I will be making these again & again. The presentation was beautiful. Thanks for the recipe. PS also pre-baked the bottom crust 5 minutes.

Let me just say, men LOVE this recipe. I haven't made these in well over 10 years and had no recipe to turn to until I found this.  If you like italian cold cuts, this is the recipe for you.  I find the roasted red peppers are easiest to work with if you lay them flat on a cutting board and press down with several paper towels, then dice and do the paper towel maneuver again. I also set the oven for 375ÂºF and baked with foil on for 25 minutes and off for 20.  It's MUCH easier to cut and serve if you let them cool a good 20-25 minutes after coming out of the oven.  I served the squares with a sun-dried tomato basil pesto sauce (just dried herbs from Tastefully Simple mixed with equal parts sour cream and mayonnaise). Delectable!

Delicious!  I don't care for swiss cheese.  So, I did eliminate it from the recipe.  I also just did one layer of the red peppers.  We served it for lunch and it was a big hit!  It has a pizza taste to it, but better.  Be sure not to deviate from the size of the pan.

These are so easy and everyone wants the  recipe.  Could be halved easily by only buying one can of crescent dinner rolls and using a 9 inch pan.

10 stars would be appropriate!! These are just terrific.  I made a single batch (wish I'd tripled it!!) cut it into about 40 squares and they were gone in 15 minutes.  I served them while still warm (but not hot).

Have had this recipe for so long and don't know why I didn't try sooner. It is perfection!  Everyone really loved this appy. I didn't change a thing....followed recipe exactly.  Just excellent. Thanks for a great recipe!   One last note....I did used low fat crescent roll dough ...not that it matters with all of the meats and cheeses.

Yum yum double yum! I've been making these for a while now and just realized I didn't rate it yet! I've made these for many-a-party and have even catered with them! Like another reviewer said...don't cover them or they'll be soggy. That's the only time I've had trouble is when I cover them before they're cooled. I make them, cool, refrigerate, cut, and re-warm for parties. A huge hit every single time! And so forgiving if you need to modify ingredients! A+++ recipe!!

Wonderful!  I also prebaked bottom crust, drained everything well and added black olives.  I will make this again and again for family and entertaining.

This was so good and a big hit at the party I took it to. I made my own roasted peppers and drained them well. The reason for 4 stars is that it was very salty. I think next time I will cut out one of the meats to try to reduce the saltyness. Otherwise it was very good.

This was just wonderful! I made it for a game night and it was the 1st thing to go! Everyone loved it! I did pre-bake the bottom layer for about 6 minutes or so, I might bake it longer next time, as i still had a bit of a soggy bottom, but I worked it out! Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!!

These were gone in a second! Because some reviews said they were a little too greasy, I used the reduced fat crescent dough and it was perfect. I bought a throw-away 9x13 foil pan for this too, and that worked well for bringing it to the party. I might spray it with pam next time because the dough  stuck to it in the corners (or maybe I just needed to let it cool longer?). I did make some changes that I would recommend - I used prosciutto instead of ham and it gave it some great flavor. I also prebaked the bottom dough for 6 min (based on others' suggestions) and patted the roasted red peppers dry between two paper towels (before and after dicing). I increased the temp to 375 and took the foil off after about 20 min and it only took another 20 or 25 min to be done. I sprinkled garlic powder over the bottom dough before I pre baked it, and over the peppers before I added the egg mixture. I only used two eggs, and a third egg just to brush the top layer of dough. I will definitely be making this again although next time I think I will add a layer of some kind of sauce - pesto or sundried tomato. Pepperocinis or black olives would also give it a little extra something. Great recipe!!! It was the hit of the party!!!

This was very good. It dissapeared quickly.  I baked at 375.  The bottom crust was soft not wet.  Next time I'll layer all the cheeses together giving it more presence. Thank you for the recipe.

I made this for lunch and it was great!  I didn't use swiss cheese just the provolone and I sprinkled garlic and basil seasoning on top.  I baked it in a ceramic dish and it came out perfect-not soggy!

This was really good and easy to substitute for things you have on hand.  I only had 1 croissant package so I split it in half, used only 1 egg and half the meat and cheese and put it in a square baking dish.  From reading the other reviews I was afraid of the bottom getting soggy so I baked the bottom layer of croissant while I prepared the egg and peppers and I blotted the red peppers really well.  I also used shredded mozzarella (what I had on hand) and put that down first over the bottom layer of the croissant.

I made these for a dinner party last night, and everyone really liked them! I used the Garlic Butter crescent rolls, which added a little bit of flavor. However, I wish I had read the other reviews before making these. When I make these again, I would follow the advice of other reviewers on how to keep the bottom crust from getting soggy. Also, I am going to try someone's suggestion of spreading sun-dried tomato pesto on the bottom crust and baking for 6 minutes before assembling the sandwiches. Overall, a good recipe and perfect for parties!

These were a huge hit at the Superbowl party I went to! Great flavors and super easy to make. I will be making this again. This recipe can be changed up to include many different types of meats and cheeses.

We were split on these, 2 people gave them a 3 & 2 people gave them a 4. They weren't bad just not very exciting. The egg layer was a tad strange & we felt there was too much black pepper. Probably won't make them again but glad I finally tried them! Thank you!

This was an OK dish.  I was disappointed in this after reading all of the fantastic reviews. My husband and I thought that the butter flavor of the crescent rolls didn't match the other ingredients.  We would probably enjoy this more if we used broad dough instead.

I liked this recipe but I did not care for the egg taste. I think the next time I make it, I'll substitute butter instead of the egg. And maybe have some pizza sauce for dipping on the side.

I would give this recipe at least six stars!  It has been the hit of the holiday season.  I added some sliced black olives and also some onions.  But it is excellent as it is.

I made these last year for Christmas Eve and they were a hit!  I did half as the recipe calls for, and the other half I added pesto and sun dried tomatoes (instead of the roasted red peppers).  YUMMY!

This was an excellent answer to a quick and easy appetizer that was filling yet you could "still eat more".  I didn't add the peppers simply because I was in a rush and completely forgot that step.  I think they would add alot.  I frankly thought it needed something and the pepper would be it. Also, I thought they were a bit salty.  I gave it 5 stars because I got such RAVE reviews.  I will make again, and when i do, I will cook that bottom layer a bit first.

This took MINUTES to make and was so worth it. 
Update:  I made again for a party. I prebaked the bottom crust for 5 minutes.  Added all ingredients per submitted recipe and thoroughly dried out the red peppers. Baked covered for 25 minutes at 375, uncovered and baked about 15 minutes more, still at 375.  Top was brown and sides were bubbling. The best thing about this dish is it's the easiest fastest thing to make. It makes about 20 pieces. Everyone really does enjoy them.  One other thing, I served this at a party of just women. It was gone.  I have to wonder how much to make if men were there also. I'm thinking double.

These are amazing! I used turkey, capicola ham, and hard salami. For cheese I used provolone and swiss. I added some Mrs Dash Tomato Basil and Garlic to the egg mixture. As others suggested, I cooked the bottom crust 5 mins at 375 first. I also patte the ingredients dry as well. I didn't have any issues with sogginess.

Wonderful idea.  I used Cappicola, Virginia Ham, and Hard Salami along with the provolone and swiss.  Also I found that chopping the peppers and placing them on papertowel to dry kept the crust from becoming soggy.

These were really good right out of the oven.  Even after they cooled, they still had a good flavor. Some of the ones in the very middle were not quite done after the full cooking time. I skipped the swiss cheese since I'm not a fan but left everything else the same.  I would make these again, but maybe cook them a little longer after taking the foil off. I wonder if they would be good using the refrigerated pizza dough verses the crescents? Thanks for sharing.

these were a hit at my son's birthday party.  They are excellent out of the oven and at room temp.  You can put any combo. that you prefer.  The next day I made a small one for my girls with just ham, provolon, cheddar and pepperoni.  They loved it!  Easy and fast!

I have been making these for years and years - originally was given the recipe by my next-door neighbor - and frankly am baffled by the negative reviews.  I make these all the time (usually by request!) and I have never heard anything but raves.  Rarely are there any left.  A couple of tips:  I always line the pan with foil or parchment paper so the bars can be lifted out of the pan to be cut.  I've never had a problem with soggy bottom crust as some others have seemed to. For a single recipe, I always need more than two packages of crescent rolls - I can never get two to stretch enough.  The MOST important tip is that you MUST let the bars rest for about an hour before you cut them - otherwise they will fall apart.  So plan ahead!  I don't reserve some of the egg/parmesan mixture for the top - just spread it all over the roasted peppers.  And I most often double this recipe and bake it in a quarter sheet pan (12" x 18").  Finally, you should also be aware that this is not a budget appetizer - but the praise is well worth the cost!!

Amazing recipe! I set the oven temp to 375 par baked the bottom of the crescent rolls in the 13x9 for six minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. I layered the meats and cheeses and added and additional layer of mozzarella(we really like cheese in my house)baked it covered in foil for 20 minutes then uncovered for 20. I allowed it to cool for another 20 minutes before cutting so that it could set up. Next time I might add a very thin layer of tomato sauce and double the bell pepper. Great recipe perfect for a party I might even make them for super bowl!

This was delicious. Allow it to sit after you remove form oven. I put parchment on the bottom after I sprayed with non stick spray.   I know this will be a favorite. I'm going to see how well this does when reheating after frozen.

I'm not normally a fan of crescent rolls, but these little sandwiches were tasty.  I served these on Christmas Eve as an appetizer, and the men especially liked them.  Boyfriend said these tasted like pizza, which is a high compliment coming from him. I prebaked the bottom layer of crescent rolls before I layered on the meats and cheeses.  At the last minute I decided against pouring the egg mixture over the top of the filling.  That just sounds so strange to me.  I did beat one egg and brush the top of the unbaked crescent roll crust.  I'll make these again - probably for men who are watching football.

AMAZING!  The only thing I did different is add pepperocini in place of the red roasted peppers.  A personal preference! This was a thumbs up by all family members!

EASY!  Great recipe for a quick supper or snack.  Definately bake at the higher temp (375*) as another suggested--25 minutes covered, 15-20 minutes uncovered.  I had no problem with the "soggy bottom."  My one addition--add 1/4 cup of melted butter to the remaining 1/4 egg mixture.  Brush over the top as instructed.  This bakes to a golden, buttery pan of goodness.  Let set, then cut.  Imagine the many filling options using the same technique.  I love it when a recipe works out!  Thank you.

As others suggested, pre baked bottom crust. Might add jalapenos & red onion next time. Everyone loved this!

Yum-O!  These really are great!  Took to a Christmas potlock and everyone said it tasted like pizza!  Loved it and it was great cold too.

This was really really delicious!  I used capicola instead of ham to avoid the watery problem others had.  I also followed the advice of others to cook for 25 mins w/top on and 25 with top off.   They're delicious warm, but they were a lot easier to handle cold and they were  still delicious.   I was dubius about if I could serve this because the crescent dough really didn't fit nicely on the top, but once the egg rose you couldn't see anything weird at all and I most definitely served it.   Most excellent!

These were a great appetizer and very easy!  Loved that they taste great warm or cold...so as they age thru a party...they're still excellent!  Pre-bake the bottom crescent layer 6-8 min's...drain your peppers on paper towels...not soggy at all!  Gets your taste buds thinking about different combinations...roast beef, jack cheese, green chiles...simple ham n cheese...a layer of pizza sauce, pepperoni, sausage, olives...tons of variations to try!  
Thanks for a great place to start!!

I make these squares as part of my Christmas Eve Buffet for family, they are a HUGE hit. Excellent Recipe. I follow it exactly and make sure to drain the roasted peppers real well.

I thought these were really good, but not absolutely great.  However everyone else at our party was loving them.  I have to say, the crescent roll sheets (instead of the divided rolls) are so awesome for recipes like this!

I took this to a party and the food just disappeared in the first 10 minutes.  I got raves for the dish.  Many were happy to learn that the recipe was available on this site.  The biggest help was the warning to be certain to drain the red peppers.  Next time, I will make 2 pans.  Hopefully we will have some left over to take home.

Made this for our NYE party and it was a hit! Took the advice of previous reviewers and pre-baked the bottom layer, also dried the meats. Used Provolone cheese because my husband doesn't care for Swiss, and didn't have roasted red peppers so I used a can of drained roasted green chilies. Will make this again for sure!

I have made this at least a dozen times. Its great. Always is eaten up at a party. I have used lower fat versions of cresent rolls, low fat salami, turkey peperoni, lean ham and low fat swiss and provalone. Also used egg beaters. Love it. Love it. Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe.

Oh my goodness, this was amazing. I made it for my ladies bunco group and it was a smash.  On the bottom crescent roll layer, I brushed it with a egg white wash and then baked it in a 350 degree oven for 8 mins.  I used the roast red peppers and drained/dried them very well on paper towels squeezing all of the liquid out of them.  I then chopped them up to approx 1/2" pieces.the rest of the ingredients were assembled according to the recipe  and baked at 375 for 25 mins covered.  For the last 20 mins I turned on the convection feature on my oven at 375
degrees and uncovered it.  It came out perfect, nicely browned and not at all soggy.

Fabulous! I made this for a jewelry party that I hosted and everyone raved.  The greatest thing was that it was so easy.  I made a few changes.  I prebaked the bottom crescent roll for 4 minutes, I used capicolla instead of boiled ham, and I reduced the amount of pepperoni.  Next time I will try adding pesto just for a little extra something special.  Thanks for the recipe!

I am a Chef's assistant and got a wild hair and made this recipe for several chefs.  I used Black Forrest Ham and Baby Swiss cheese along with the other meats. WONDERFUL!  The chefs wanted the recipe!  Thank you Lori G!

I loved the idea and flavor of this recipe, but I found that the peppers made the squares wet.  Maybe I could've drained them better or cooked it longer or just used less peppers.  I may try them again an domit the peppers.

These were wonderful!  Very easy to make and they are just the perfect snack.  I will make these again and again...delicious hot and at room temperature.  I made them for a party with a lot of other snacks and they were the first things to go.  Thanks for a great new appetizer recipe.

These are delicious!  As other reviewers recommended I baked the bottom layer of crescent rolls for about 7 minutes before adding the filling. Made sure the peppers were dried between paper towels, as well as the ham. Baked for 25 min at 375 with foil and then 25 minutes uncovered. Everyone liked these & I will definitely make often. Quick & easy & so good - thanks for sharing!

These are a delicious hit!  I made a half a batch in my 9" springform pan, and, silly me, I didn't oil the pan first!  Other than a bad cleanup mess, these were great--even cold from the fridge!  I followed the recipe as exactly as I could with the meats and cheese types, and I used only one egg but could have used two I think.  The peppered salame from Trader Joe's was great in this recipe.  Next time I'll make the full batch and spray my pan!  Yum!

I made this this weekend for a church meeting, I followed the advice to prebake the bottom for 5 minutes.  I added a caramelized onion along with the red pepper. I also added 1/2 tsp dried basil and 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the eggs - They got rave reviews.

I've made this many times in several different variations (I usually just throw in spinach instead of peppers.)  The only thing bad about this recipe is the price of all the ingredients.

I used a variety of meats on this, didn't stick to the ones specific to the recipe. I was very happy with it. Simple to throw together and well-received by my guests.

Sooooo good.  I added italian seasonings to the egg mixture.  It turned out great.  Next time I plan on trying it with lower fat ingredients...reduced fat rolls, reduced fat cheeses, and turkey pepperoni, etc.  Also, next time I may try and spice it up a bit with banana pepper rings.  DELICIOUS.  Thanks for the great recipe.***I did prebake the bottom layer of rolls for about 5 minutes.  This worked out perfect...no soggy!!!

This was great!  I think you could use any combination of ingredients. A pizza theme would also be great. I pre-baked the first crust for 8 minutes then baked it covered for 25 minutes and then brought it to the party,  where I removed the foil and finished it at 375 for about 15-20 minutes.  After 5-10 minutes of letting it rest,  it sliced perfectly.

Delicious just as the recipe is written!  I made this for our main course because it sounded so good.  Enough for two more meals as well.  Will freeze enough for one--I'm sure it will be as delicious reheated as it was the first time!

I followed the recipe exactly. It was a huge hit at our Super Bowl party. This recipe is relatively easy to put together and was really tasty. It is great for parties where you don't want to have messy, hard to eat foods. Just grab a square and go! Tastes OK at room temp, but definitely better wam.

Thanks to all of you who took the time to add your comments and make this recipe absolutely fool proof!  The suggestion you gave made my dish come out perfect the first time I made it (yesterday)!!  I sprayed the bottom of my baking pan, used the crescent sheets, sprinkled garlic powder on the bottom sheet and the roasted red peppers as well,  baked the bottom layer six minutes, drained and patted the roasted red peppers very dry, used only two eggs, baked it 25 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered and it was excellent. Thank you allrecipe.com fans! Follow these hints and your dish will be a big hit too.

Made this for an after school snack...a win, the kids all loved it.  I used peperoni and ham with shredded mozzarella cheese.  I followed the advise to bake the bottom for 6 min, and kept everything else the same.  Very quick, easy, and yummy.

These are nothing short of awesome!  I am pretty certain they will become my new "go to" appetizer for parties.  I had to sub american cheese for the provolone.  I also sprinkled a little oregano in w/ the egg/parm/pepper mixture.  It's like a bite size italian grinder!  Yum yum yum

Um...seriously....these were delicious. I have never wrote a review for anything in my life and HAD to make a comment on this dish. I made these for game night and everyone flipped out over these, esp the guys. I followed recipe exactly. My husband keeps asking for them again! These will def become one of my signature dishes! Thanks Lori!!!!

these came out really good, I think next time I may precook the bottom a little longer, and use a little less egg.  I took these to a party and they went over really well!

More stars are needed for this! I made it exactly as written. I did bake the bottom layer of crescent rolls for 5 minutes before adding all the other ingredients because of comments of the bottom being soggy so I don't know if that was necessary however it came out terrific so it was worth doing. I also layed the strips of roasted peppers on a paper towel to minimize the moisture in the pan. Everyone really loved these, I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe!! Delicious!

Made these as an addition to a brunch.  Big hit!!  Like others, I baked the bottom crust for 15 minutes.  I used American cheese instead of provolone, which can be too strong for some people.  I also used a lean salami and honey ham.   Make sure to let it set for about 15 minutes before cutting.  Fantastic!

These squares were delicious! I did drain peppers, ham etc. in paper towels, also. And for a bit of a twist, added artichoke hearts(sliced and drained), garlic, and a few small tabasco peppers(seeded, chopped, & drained.)These are going to be made again for sure. Thank you, Lori.

I made the big mistake of making this for some picky eaters without any of the meat, but not adding anything else since they don't like vegetables either.  Made that way the recipe was very bland, but I could tell that it would have been really good if I had made it the way it was written.  I added a lot of crushed red pepper and oregano.  I think it would be good with a variety of cheeses.

I will definitely be making these again.  They are super easy and super good.  I did prebake my crust for 10 minutes before layering the rest of the ingredients.  I also drained my roasted red peppers and blotted them dry with a paper towel.  My squares were not a bit soggy.  I forgot to add my pepperoni but these were still delicious.  I patted my top crust out on a piece of waxed paper and then turned it crust side to the top of my ingredients and then peeled off the waxed paper.  My kids loved these dipped in Italian dressing.  They baked up beautifully and were easy to keep warm until our party started.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe :)

These are wonderful!  I would have posted a picture but they were gone before I could find the camera.  I made these with others' suggestions - bake the bottom layer of crescent rolls for 10 minutes first, pat the peppers dry.  They were delicious!  I don't know how it would work but I want to make these again and add sliced marinated mushrooms - those are my favorite part of antipasto!

Great appetizer! Followed other suggestions and par cooked bottom crust for 6 minutes before topping and chopped red peppers and drained them before using.  I used prosciutto in place of the ham and smoked mozzarella instead of the swiss cheese.   Everyone really liked it.

These were super tasty.  I did pre-bake the bottom dough for 6 minutes, used honey ham and really dried the peppers well as suggested by previous posters. Also waited 20 minutes before slicing. As is deserves 4 1/2 stars. Next time will add more meat for 5 stars.
***UPDATE: Made again and baked at 350 degrees and it was a bit greasy.  The first time I baked at 375 degrees and it wasn't greasy.  I don't know if the change in temperature accounted for the extra grease, but when I make it again I will definitely bake at 375 degrees.

Good recipe, made for a family birthday.  Made a few changes to make it a little more healthy.  Baked the crust for 7 min, then layered the ham, swiss cheese, turkey, provolone cheese, repeated the layers again, then the roasted peppers.  I only used 2 eggs and also sprinkled Italian seasoning and salt on the top crust, then baked.  I did use low fat cheese, couldn't tell.  Was loved by all, will definetly make again!

This is Excellent!!!  The only difficult part about this is rolling out the dough to cover top and bottom of pan.  It's easier if the dough isn't cold right out of the fridge.  MOST IMPORTANT: oven time after removing foil is much longer than recipe suggests.  20 - 30 mins. at least, let it get nicely browned!  It was a huge hit at my card party and I have been asked to make it EVERY time we get toghether!!!

Very filling so think twice about doubling the recipe, which is what I did.  I brought it to a potluck and the host begged me to leave the leftovers for his lunch the next day, it was a huge hit. Updating review 10/25/15: I  make this  for my BIL for special occasions like his bday or Father's Day, he LOVES it. Really great as an entree with a spinach salad with Italian dressing. I do pre-bake the crust and that helped a lot as well as blotting the wetter ingredients like roasted red peppers and fresh mozz. I use  fresh mozzarella instead of Swiss and I think that pairs better with the provolone. 2 eggs plus one yolk for the center and the leftover egg white for a top wash. I have been making this for 10 year and it was one of the first recipes I ever saved on All Recipes.

These are the BEST!  I Have been making them for every event I go to (by request)  They are awesome warm, cold - for leftovers.  I have passed this along to many many people.  Oh and I agree, I have found that you have to cook them longer after removing the foil - until the dough is puffy and lightly browned.

Excellent!! Forget about appetizer, this makes a perfect meal when you add a salad with it. My kids and husband loved it. I added an extra egg and more parmesan cause I wanted more of a filling, it was perfect. I cooked it a little longer also. And most important it was so quick and easy. Thanks

Made this for a get together with friends.  I'm not a big red pepper fan so I substituted it with fresh tomato.  I slices it thin and let the slices sit in a few paper towels so their is not too much liquid.  Friends went nuts for it. They loved it, and they keep asking me for the recipe.

I am rating this as per recipe!  First time I made it, followed exactly, love it.  The other times I have made~one in oven now~I add red pepper flakes to the egg mixture.  I have used monterey Jack cheese this time, as I have no provolone in house.  It is only my husband and I so I only use one crescent package and tear in half and use an 8x8 pan.  Great for any occasion, especially football season :)

Very good, and easy to make!  I used garlic crescents.  Also, I did not use the egg at all but I can't imagine we would have liked it better with it.  Overall good recipe and DH  said it's a keeper.

This is awesome! Even my kids like this. You can use any Italian meats, too. It's better contrast with the Swiss & provolone but I've used provolone, mozz & even white American. Perfect staple dish for SuperBowl!

These were okay, I got mixed reviews at the party I brought them to. Most of the guys liked it, but the rest of us thought it was way too salty. I like the idea of this recipe, but I would choose some lower salt meats next time.

This is great and quick. Everyone at the party I brought it to loved it.  I changed it to my taste using mozza and provolone.  Cold cuts I used were Genoa salami, cooked ham and prociutto salami.  I added Italian seasoning to the egg mix with parmesan and add all of it to the cold cuts.  I mixed some olve oil and oregano and brushed the top of the cresent rolls with it and then sprinkled more freshly grated parmesan on top.  It was great and I can addapt it to any flavor concept I want.

Amazing! These will go very fast at any gathering, and they do well at room temperature. A little expensive, but well worth it. I made it exactly as directed in a glass baking dish and it came out fine- no hassling with pre-baking the bottom. Do yourself a favor and try these.

Excellent.  Friends request this for every get together. I cut the roasted peppers into small pieces instead of leaving whole strips. Also I dont use a whole jar since not everyone likes them. Have also tried with putting onions on for more flavor but this made it soggy. Using original recipe seems to work best and mine is never soggy or greasy. Just delicious.

Delicious!  I prebaked the the bottom crust as well and it turned out great.  We are not big egg eaters, so I skipped the eggs and brushed some low-fat mayo on each of the crescent layers, and sprinkled with parmesan.  A huge hit with the men and kids.  One of guest suggested I add chopped jalopenos next time, I think I'll try that!

This is delicious!  Any time I prepare this Iâm asked for the recipe.  Make sure to blot the excess liquid off of the peppers; I forgot to do so one time and it made the bottom soggy.  When followed exactly, this recipe is phenomenal!  Thanks for sharing!

I made these for a party.  The pan was completely empty in a very short time.  EVERYONE loved them.  I added turkey breast and mozz. cheese (didn't have any prov. cheese), left out the peppers, and prebaked the bottom crust for about 8 minutes.  I will be making these again soon.  Great recipe!!!!

Loved this recipe.  easy and tasty..but I wanted it to have more flavor, so  I added a drained and dried jar of sun dried tomatoes, and used only 1/2 can of the red peppers.  I also did not like the two cheeses on top of each other so I alternated meat and cheese.  This coated every layer with gooey cheese.  Yum.

This was yummy and very easy to make.  As others suggested, I baked the bottom crust first for about 6 minutes and then I used paper towels to pat dry the ham slices and roasted peppers strips before layering.  I took it to a pot luck and everyone raved about it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I followed the suggestion of cooking the bottom layer for 6-7 minutes before adding the meat/cheese/peppers etc. This recipe is fabulous!! I made it for the Super Bowl...there was nothing left. I also like the versatility, as you can pretty much fill this with whatever you like.

This was a big hit at my party, and they're very tasty!  I am rating it as 4 stars as written, and 5 with the improvements I picked up from other reviewers: 1) prebake the bottom part of the crust for about 5 minutes; 2)pat dry your bell peppers; 3) only use 2 eggs, not 3; and 4) once you take the foil off, turn the oven up to 375 or so.  Great, thanks!

A great appetizer.  I only use one egg, pouring about 2/3 of it over the meat/cheese/pepper layers and the other 1/3 to brush on the top crescent layer.  I don't see the need for more egg.  It holds together nicely without the extra, and I think using only one egg is the remedy for the soggy bottom.  This recipe's a keeper.

Unbelievably tasty, but soggy on the bottom.  Tried the tips recommended by others but still came out soggy.  I'd make it again though!

I have made this a couple of times now, and gotten rave reviews both times.  In an effort to make this a little lighter, I have used reduced fat crescent rolls, reduced fat provolone and swiss cheeses, fat-free lunch meats (ham, turkey), and turkey pepperoni.  Like other reviewers suggested, I baked the bottom crust for a few minutes (like 5-6 minutes) so that it wasn't soggy when it was finished.  It's a keeper indeed!

Awesome.  My guests could not get enough - although I served at room temperature and they were even better warm.  Did not use genoa but didn't miss it.  Used olive bar roasted peppers which I think cut down on juice combined with baking bottom crust for 6 minutes as others suggested - no sogginess at all.  I baked 2 and the one in the glass pan turned out better than the metal, not sure if it made a difference but an observation.  These are great.

These were Excellent...  I did do what a few viewers have stated. On the bottom crust I sprinkled some garlic powder all over it, and also pre backed it 6 minutes
I layered it as  stated but I added sliced green onions on top of the cheese
and the rest of the meat and roasted peppers, and I used 3 eggs, a few dashes of hot sauce in egg mixture, parm cheese and pepper. Oh and I almost forgot instead of boiled ham I bought hot ham
And I used one more egg on top crust. Baked for the time it said with foil, 
and  baked uncovered 20 mins, but checked to make sure wasnt browning to much. I let it rest 10 minutes. And it came out of pan perfect and tasted yummy....I am my worst critic when it comes to cooking but I have to say this was really good.. Thanks for the recipe it is pricy to make but I will make again for sure.

Everyone loved them.  I've made them several times, but they are a bit too greasy for me.  I have not figured a healther way to make them.  If anyone has some suggestions, please post them.

Wow!  These were delicious!  I am not found of roasted red peppers so I left them out but followed the recipe otherwise.  I took them to a get together at a friends house and they were gone in minutes.  Both the adults and young children devoured them.  Two guys even went to the grocery store to get the ingredients to make more right away!  Thanks for the great keeper recipe!

Fantastic!!! Made these for a baby shower and it was the first thing gone. Had four requests for the recipe, definitely a keeper. Baked the bottom layer for about 5 minutes and let the entire dish cool for about 15 minutes and had no problem with it being soggy. Thanks!!!

This is a really easy recipe and everyone loved it.  I change it into a plain ham and cheese kid friendly dish and my kids devour the whole thing.  Definitely precook bottom crust for 6-7 minutes to prevent the bottom from being soggy.

I made this recipe for a party and everyone loved them. I tasted it hot and room temperature.  When it was hot it tasted a lot like pizza.  When the squares were room temperature it was easier to taste the layers.  Personally I liked them better at room temperature.  I did not have a problem with a soggy bottom crust but I was cooking another dish at the same time and probably during half of the cooking time the squares baked on the lower rack of my oven.

Wonderful.  Easy and tasty.  I didn't have red peppers, so I improvised.  I mixed green olives minced with black olives, minced, with a little red hots, the kind you get in a hoagie sandwich.  The jar says they are called pickled, crushed red peppers. I also pre cooked the bottom crust. This was not soggy at all.  It reminded me of a mufalata.

This was so good. I was a little skeptical about dumping the eggs over the whole thing because I thought it would be great without the eggs, but nevertheless, I followed the recipe and forced myself to use the eggs.  WOW...it was delicious!  I did pre-bake the bottom crust for about 8 minutes, just til it started to brown. I also found that it took a lot longer to cook after the foil was taken off..I think I left it in another half hour to 40 minutes until it was a nice golden brown. This was seriously GOOD.

This is a great recipe. I used 2 15.5 oz. cans of crescent bread. You can't go wrong by changing up the ingredients. I made 2. The 2nd pan consisted of diffrent deli meats, bacon and various types of shredded cheese. My husband thought it was better than the 1st pan (which was what the recipe called for). You can even make it ahead of time before you bake it.

Very easy to make and easy to modify depending what you have on hand. Prebaking the bottom crust is a must.

If I could give this 6 stars I would!  My guests ate this so fast I didn't even see the first batch! I got tons of complements too.  I patted the red peppers dry first and prebaked the bottom crust a little too. Other than that, didn't change a thing and I can't wait to make them again.  Thanks!!

I made this recipe substituting Pepperidge Farm frozen puff pastry for the crescent roll dough. It turned out very nicely. Most everyone who tried it at the party I took it to said "those pizza things are good". I think that next time I will skip the egg wash on the top of the pastry because all it did was make an ugly hard shell over the top that cooked too dark and prevented the rest of the dough from cooking properly.

very good!!  I made it for a teacher's shower and they were a hit!!  I baked the bottom layer dough for about five minutes before adding the meats/cheese and the top layer of dough just to insure that it would crisp up nicely.

I have to make three pans of these my guest were eating them fasted than I could cut them out of the pan. I did choose to no use the roasted peppers due to the guys not being veggie eaters. Also I make these on cookie sheets the bottom comes out perfect and you can fit a bouble batch. Can't go wrong with these

They tasted good, but they were a mess. The middle was pretty slimy and unattractive. I might make them again for me, but I would not serve them to company.

This is the first time that I've commented on a recipe after years and years of using allrecipes.com.  I made this for a Christmas Brunch this past weekend.  Other than bringing the oven temp up to 375* and using honey ham (both in an effort to prevent moisture), I made no changes to the recipe.  It was an ENORMOUS hit.  I had guests who said they don't like antipasto or don't like peppers going back for seconds or thirds.  Whether it is fresh out of the oven and eaten with a fork and knife, or out at room temperature and eaten with your hands, this recipe is delicious.  The next time I make this, I'm making 2-3x as much.  I highly recommend making these for your next party!

5 27 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/57808/antipasto-squares/ ... 'Probably less than four star, but more than three.  I did like it, but those canned crescent rolls not-so-much.  At first, I thought it was all the cured meat; but it's the crescent rolls that give an off flavor.  I even bought Pillsbury.  Huh.  'Think pizza crust would be much better.  Once I get that down, I may try it again with it.  I prebaked 5 minutes, as suggested.  I only used the amount of pepperoni you'd put on a 9x13 pepperoni pizza.  A quarter pound of that would be overwhelming, I think.  Soooo, really like the idea & it was good, just wish I'd used different bread.  17 year old boy went for two servings ... hmmm ... it is deserving of four stars.  Of course, you can put anything in or around a crescent roll or biscuit & "those kids" will try it!  Ha!  :)  Oh, my 12oz jar of roasted peppers only had one huge pepper in it.  That's fine, just surprising - to me, anyway.  :)

This is a great recipe.  I have made it twice and both times were wonderful.  The second time I made a few changes to make it more my taste... I substituted banana peppers instead of the red peppers, used 2 eggs and refrigerated pizza crescent rolls.  I also used melted butter and garlic salt on top. This was delicious and a crowd pleaser.  My husband thought it would be even better with a few jalopenos, but I liked it just as is. 
Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Made a few changes after reading some reviews. I spread some Sun Dried Tomato Pesto on the bottom dough and baked it for six minutes. I also diced the peppers and dried everything between paper towels. Changed the order to Provolone, Ham, Salami, Pepperoni and Swiss. This was awesome. It all went during the first half of the Football game.

I was very disappointed.  I agree 100% with another poster that said the crust does not go with the deli meats at all.  The flavor was just wrong.  I thought this was a no brainer and there was no way this could possibly be bad.  I found that eating just the inside tasted good, so it has to be the crescent dough that threw it off completely.  Try pizza dough for sure.  So based on the taste and the cost this is a no star.

Very good. I followed recipe exactly. Only change I made 2nd time as recommended from other reviews is to bake bottom layer for 6 minutes and pat dry the peppers. Bottom is a little soggy  if not. No need to change ingredients, just for me I love Peperoncini and drizzled Italian dressing on top.

Wonderful for a party. I was able to make most of this the night before, just left off the peppers and the top dough layer to keep it from getting too soggy; this meant I only spent five minutes the day of the party on the dish that ended up being the biggest hit!  Note - I found this much better served room temperature than hot.

Everyone at my mother's birthday party LOVED these, and they disappeared FAST.  I did prebake the bottom crust for 6 minutes, but would probably even go a little longer on that next time around.  Also only used two eggs, and instead of brushing the top with egg, just sprinkled a good amount of parmesan before baking.  This is a definite do again!  Thanks for the recipe.  I found it easiest to cut into squares using a pizza cutter, too.  Otherwise, it was tough getting through the meats, especially the salami.

Doubled the recipe for a recent housewarming party and got rave reviews. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and baked the first layer of cresecent roll dough for 6 minutes. I also forgot to bake mine covered, but didn't seem to be a big deal. Bumped up the temperature to 375 for the last few minutes. Yummy!

YUM!YUM! I made these for a birthday party yesterday and they were a big hit!  The tray was empty in no time.  I did have one problem, the foil stuck to the top crust and I had a hard time peeling it off.  I did not read anyone having a problem with the foil and I am wondering what I did wrong.  Other than that, it was absolutely delish!  Will be making this again soon.

brought these to a family get together and everyone enjoyed them.  They were delicious.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and drained my peppers on paper towels.  Instead of pepperoni, I used cappicola and I added half of a diced red onion into my beaten eggs.  All in all these were a big hit

I made this for a group meeting with 20 people. I also made a dessert and there were other nosh. It was really good, hit the spot. I doubled crescent roll part. 2 pn bottom and 2 on top, since I needed it to fit in regular size cookie sheet. I also lined with aluminum foil. I increased the eggs to 4 and put in 6 tablespoons of parm cheese. Also forgot peppers until after put egg cheese mixture on, it worked! I found antipasto peppers in Italian section at food store. I will definitely make this again for functions.

I just made these for the first time for a Fourth of July get-together, and everyone raved about them and asked me for the recipe. Like previous reviewers, I pre-baked the crust with a thin layer of pesto on top for about five minutes, and then followed the recipe exactly. You will not be disappointed if you make these!

This was a big hit. My daughter forgot to add the egg mixture before putting the to crescent rolls on, so we only brushed the top, and it was still yummy. Will do it right next time to see the difference.

For the amount of delicious ingredients I was really expecting something much more flavorful. I didn't add provolone or swiss cheese; I went with all mozzarella - and I used peppers instead of roasted red peppers, so maybe that's what happened; but the whole thing was too salty - and too meaty, instead of the orgasm of flooding flavors as I expected. The flavor had no depth to it whatsoever, and after a few pieces you quickly tire of the meats. Really not worth the time, money, or calories. I made a quick oil and vinegar mix with tomatoes, italian seasoning and more tangy/hot peppers to dip the sandwiches in and that seemed to make it much better.

This recipe is great! Like some of the other reviewers, I precooked the bottom crust for about 6 minutes before adding the remaining ingredients. I also thoroughly drained the red peppers and I added well drained banana pepper rings for some extra ZING. The provolone I used was "sharp" and the pepperoni I used was turkey pepperoni.  This was not greasy at all. I have made the receipe 3 times and each time it went quickly. Great recipe...and it can be modified to add so many other ingredients!

I made these for dinner as a test run before I made them for a party. Everybody liked them.  My husband and I thought they had a little too much cheese in them. I think maybe next time I will try them with some type of tomato sauce to dip them in or sauce in the sandwhich.

This was just okay.. the breading came out a bit soggy but maybe that was because I assembled everything and put it in the fridge for an hour or so in order for it to be fresh.  I also prebaked the bottom layer as the other reviewers suggested.

Made for a neighborhood block party. Used garlic flavored dough and only used two eggs. Also cooked the bottom for 6 minutes before layering meats and cheese. Everyone loved it!

Both my mom and I make this and it never fails - huge hit!  They are a great brunch item, as well as a perfect item that displays well on a platter to bring to a party.  This recipe works with a number of fillings as well - a good imagination takes what is nearly perfect without your help to exactly what you want it to be!

Loved this!!  Got creative since some reviewers said it was bland- I brushed the top layer with prepared pesto before the final layer of crescent dough and egg.  It was a huge hit at my party!!

Great recipe!  I have made this a few times exactly as the recipe reads and it always goes over very well. The only problem I ever had was if I didn't grease the pan enough because it will stick. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I've had these before and they were excellent, however I used some of the reviewers' suggestions and mine came out too dry, and not as tasty.  I will try again following the recipe as is.

I made these for a New Year's Eve gathering of friends last night and, while several of them raved about it, I was a bit disappointed.  It didn't have the bold taste I expected.  I did pre-bake the lower crust for about 7 minutes as others have suggested and it turned out perfectly - no sogginess at all and it was a golden brown.  I also baked at 375 as suggested by others. I used hard salami, two kinds of ham (honey and smoked), sandwich pepperoni, provolone cheese, freshly graded parm and romano and some pre shredded cheddar/jack cheese.  I omitted the red peppers as I don't like them much and substituted sun dried tomatoes (fresh, not jarred). This may have been the problem as others have noted that the peppers make the recipe.  Next time I think I'll add sliced plum ripe plum tomatoes.  The marinara dipping sauce is a must!

This was so delicious and easy to make.  I used puff pastry instead of crescent rolls because I like it better and blind baked the bottom dough for about 8 minutes like other reviews suggested. Everyone loved it and it was still good when it got cold.  I will make again soon.

Went very quickly and almost everyone asked for the recipe.  Used prosciutto instead of ham.  Might have made it a little salty, but good!

These were very good!  Little soggy even with the pre-bake but I think that's because I used the eggs recipe calls for and that is too much.  Once I got to the party, I put them in toaster oven to dry out a little and add crunch factor ... forgot the sauce for dipping as suggested ... didn't matter because they didn't last long!

This was a huge hit.  I did cook the bottom layer in the oven for about 5 minutes first and patted the meats dry.  I personally don't like roasted red peppers so I skipped them but then added an extra layer of meat and cheese.  Sliced black olives would have been good too.  Adding the top layer of crescent rolls was pretty tricky so I was afraid it would look awful, but once cooked it puffed up and the presentation was fine.  Don't forget to brush the top with the egg mixture.  I've been asked to make this many times....oh and the leftovers are great for breakfast!

Served this at our italian wine tasting night and everyone loved it.  I followed others advice and patted the ham and peppers with and pre-baked the bottom crust for about 5 minutes.  I didn't use any swiss, but I used extra meat and cheese.  Really good.

This was very easy to make, and very good. I used shredded mozzarella and provolone, I think next time I make it I will put in more of the meat and cheese. I brought it to a barbeque and it was gone in under 10 minutes! I served it with some marinara sauce to dip them in. Big hit will def. make again!

Excellent! I followed other reviewers advice and baked the bottom layer for 5-6 minutes. I recommend spaying some pam on the bottom of your baking dish to avoid sticking.

This was excellent. Didnt have a problem with it not cooking on the bottom, used a dark 9 x 13 pan sprayed with olive oil.
Baked exactly as written..
Used cooked ham, salami, and swiss, and the roasted peppers. Will add the mozzerala and provolone next time. The egg batter didnt go far, so I used it all in the inside and then added one beaten egg with one Tablespoon of parm cheese for the top. It came out golden and puffed. Really nice!! let cool for about 25 minuted and then sliced perfectly. Nice for pot lucks and for company!!!

Don't forget to let it cool a full 15 minutes before cutting or serving. This helps keep the squares

I have made this recipe twice for parties - everyone really loved it - will make it again - the only issue I had was the bottom burned - we just peeled it off and ate it anyway - I am guessing it was the glass pan.

These are always a hit.  I use banana pepper rings instead of the roasted red peppers just because I like the taste.  And I give a squirt of Zesty Italian dressing before putting on the top crust.  Yum, little handheld Italian subs!!

FANTASTIC!!  I drained the peppers the day before, chopped them, dried them with paper towels and put them in paper towels in the frige over night.  I prebaked the cresent roll for about 7 or 8 minutes with garlic powder and dried basil on it (as suggested by others).  I layered the meat and put sliced black olives on it too.  I probably would try sundried tomatoes next time, even though the peppers were great.  The olives were awesome on it.  I baked it covered for 20 and uncovered for 30.  I accidentally forgot about it and might have overcooked it a little.  I would recommend 20 covered and 20 - 25 uncovered on 375.  It was still delicious though, no worries!  I let it cool for about 25 minutes and then cut it up into squares.  I served it on a platter with tomato sauce in the middle for a little something extra.  WOW!!!

These were amazingly good! I didn't change too much, although I did pre-bake the bottom crust for a little over 5 minutes, and used shredded mozzarella/provolone blend instead of just provolone. I also found that I needed to beat another egg to brush on top. I actually made these for dinner, instead of an appetizer, and everyone just loved them!  They were even good cold right out of the refrigerator the next day. I will definitely be making these again!

After reading many reviews, I decided to use a few different ingredients (meat/ cheese choices) and I added a thin layer of diced veggies. These were a little greasy at first, but still great. After freezing and then microwaving, they had much less greasiness. Thanks

I made this recipe and changed the roasted red peppers for sun dried tomatoes.  It was great!  I also added a bit of ricotta cheese and decrease the eggs mixture just a bit.  Everyone loved it but it is kind of expensive to make.

This is a great appetizer at parties. I always chop up the peppers really small. I think it works better. I have made many variations of this recipe. Use whatever you like. I am not a big "italian grinder" fan. I make it with turkey and swiss with roasted peppers alot. Everyone raves. I think this is a great recipe.

Yummy!  A big hot. I served with a side of spicy mustard for dipping. Note: Be careful not to leave in the oven too long.  The first time I made this, I left it in the oven until the top was golden brown and after it cooled, it was a bit too done...

Wow, what a party hit! I was asked by at least three people for the recipe. I am vegetarian so on part of it I did not put the meat and I thought it was great also. I will definately make this again but probably double the recipe for 20-30 people.

Great recipe!  Everyone loved it!  I did not pre-bake the crust and it was not soggy at all.  I did blot all the extra liquid from the peppers and chopped them.  I baked at the recommended times but at 375.  I let the casserole sit 20 minutes before cutting.  I cut them into one inch squares, because they are quite rich.

These tasted really good... and I am not sure if I am the world's worst cook or what but the aluminum foil stuck to the top of the sandwich! I cooked it for the 20 minutes and then had to PEEL the top layer of croissant off the foil. So when it was all done, the presentation was lacking. But they sure did taste good!!!

Very good.  Went very quick at a party.  I did half with the meat, the other half I put portabella mushrooms on instead of meat for the vegetarians, those went first.

My sister and I prepared this appetizer for a party we hosted and it got rave reviews! We left out the salami, and it was still very tasty. I preferred the dish at room temp, but others liked it better warm. I plan on using this recipe in the future with different fillings. Mmmm!

I made these for a superbowl party and people loved them! I did add a few sliced kalamata olives to make it a bit more "antipasto" like. I also wonder what this recipe would taste like with puff pastry instead of the very buttery and fattening crescent rolls.

Good and filling appetizer.  I cut them into about 18 squares rather than 10, and it was more than enough of a bite for most (others that loved it could take two or three).  I followed others suggestions for the soggy crust and baked the bottom crust by itself for about 6 minutes, dried the red peppers within an inch of their lives, and turned up the heat to 375.  Only four stars instead of 5 as they take some time to assemble - but a big hit with the Super Bowl crowd.

I made this for my bunco group and it was a big hit.  It was very easy to prepare and it was one of those appetizers that tasted just as good at room temperature as it did hot from the oven.  Will definately make this again.

I used the pillsbury canned pizza dough instead of crescent rolls - also spread a thin layer of tomatoe paste on the top of the bottom crust and then sprinkled italian seasoning.  Great to take to work for lunch.

This recipe is awesome.  I did make a couple changes.  I used hickory smoked ham instead of the boiled and I used green olive tapenade in place of the roasted red peppers.  This recipe reminds me of a Muffaletta. Next time I think I will use pizza crust and add some pizza sauce for a different flair.  We ate the leftovers for breakfast the next morning, which was nice to just warm up in the oven.  This recipe is definatly a keeper.  Thanks

These squares tasted delicious, were easy to prepare, and when they were taken out of the oven looked gorgeous.  This would have gotten five stars, but the bottom layer of dough came out mushy and I had to flip and bake further which was a pain.  I'm considering trying the pillsbury pizza dough because I think it would make this even easier, next time I'll bake the bottom for five minutes first, before assembling.

These squares were excellent 10/10. Even though they were good at room tempature, they were outrageously delicious warm, straight from the oven.  I also used Roasted Red Pepper Spead instead of just Roasted Red Peppers.  Thank you!

This was really good!!! I was looking for something different to make. It was very simple and very tasty! My husband raved about it. He was sick of the same old thing. Give this a try if you're looking for something different to make!! I will make this again and again!!!

My cousin made these for my baby shower  two years ago, and I've been in love ever since. Sadly, she wouldn't give me the recipe.. Not even a name.. I searched high and low  until I came across this recipe and JACKPOT! The recipe I've been searching for, for two years. This is a must try and sure to be a big hit exactly the way it is. The only thing I did differently was use less egg as it tends to make the bottom soggy.

Not sure how this would turn out; fabulous!  Took some hints from others:  added chopped black olives, used a whole jar (16 oz) of roasted peppers.  Would now add sauteed jalapenos (we like spicy).  You must squeeze the peppers over and over to get them as dry as possible (like having to squeeze spinach before adding it to a baked dish); it's worth it!
Followed the baking time, etc.  Baked the crust for 6 min before filling; stuck with the temp & times after that; perfect!
I have a "keeper" file and a "try" file; this one goes into the keeper file.  Oh,  pizza sauce/marinara are wonderful with this!!

I replaced Swiss with mozzarella, baked the bottom crust for a few minutes as suggested and left out the peppers because I forgot to buy them and it was still great. Cutting them in squares and placing toothpicks in them is a perfect way to serve.

This is a great recipe for any party (as long as you are not a vegetarian...lol). 

I follow the recipe up to the egg mixture.

I used 3 eggs, 3 Tbs of fresh grated Parmesan, I added sun ripened tomatoes, red pepper flakes, fresh ground black pepper and fresh oregano. 

The only problem with this recipe s that there is never left overs.

EXCELLENT!!! This is the easiest recipe that is so delicsious!! I comoe from an Italian family and would definitely serve this to them without feeling guilty that I did not make the dough from scratch! this is DELICIOUS.  The entire pan of these squares were devoured and gone.  I had served them to a party of 15 people and everyone loved it!!!!  This appetizer will be a staple in my dinner gaterhings and parties!  The one thing I recommend is definitley doing what another reviewer recommended and that is, spread the first layer of crescent dough and add a layer of the tomatoe pesto and cook it for 6 minutes and then add all the other ingredients.  The tomatoe pesto adds such a nice flavor with all the other ingedients!!! THIS IS AWESOME!

These were so good!  I made some updates based on the reviews and what I had, but I bet the original is amazing too!  1.  Like most people suggest, I partially baked the bottom.  2.  I topped the bottom crust with 6 slices of cheese - 3 Swiss and 3 Muenster.  I had this multipack cheese thing.  I'm a huge fan of Swiss, but I actually think the Muenster pieces were tastier.  3.  Put a layer of sun dried tomato pesto over the cheese.  Next time I will add a second layer of sun dried tomato pesto between one of the meat/cheese layers.  4.  Sliced up the salami and pepperoni a little (didn't both slicing the ham) so I could cut it into squares easier.  5.  After crust/cheese/pesto I layered salami, then ham, then some shredded pizza cheese (I didn't buy enough cheese and that's what was in the fridge), then pepperoni, 3 slices of provolone (I will use 6 next time), diced (blotted with paper towels) red peppers and then egg/black pepper/Parmesan mixture, to which I added a little garlic powder.  (I totally forgot to buy Parm and my mom had some of the wretched green can stuff in the fridge that I used.). I only poured egg mixture (3) inside and did not use any as an egg wash.  It was freaking delicious.  I served it as lunch and we had to stop ourselves from eating until we were uncomfortable.  I was worried about greasiness/saltiness, but it was neither.  I purchased really good quality deli meats which I think helped a lot.

I am going to start off by saying that these are totally not my taste and I did not eat even one of them. However, I am giving this recipe 5 stars because they are very easy to make and are a huge hit at every party I bring them too. There are never any leftover.

This is really good. I pressed the peppers between paper towels to remove the moisture as others suggested. Only substitution I made was to use prosciutto instead of boiled ham. It has a lot more taste and less moisture than boiled ham.

Made these for a party and YUM! Appears that now they make the crescent rolls packages smaller.  I pressed and stretched it to make it fit a little easier in the pan.  Used smoked deli ham, as boiled ham seemed yuckie to me.  Only had half the provolone I thought I had, so added some shredded mozarella to that layer.  The roasted peppers make this dish, so don't leave them off.  I served room temp and people loved them.  Note, they don't seem to reheat well in microwave, but toaster oven worked fine for a few leftover bites for me the next day.

I wanted to be blown away by this, but I wasn't. It tasted good, but not sure if I liked the egg with it. I wish I had added banana peppers to spice it up. I precooked the bottom crescent roll crust for about 8 minutes before layering everything else on it. When I poured the eggs on top it ran all over the cookie sheet and got really burnt and smelled really bad while it was cooking. I would probably make this again.

Great recipe! I took the advice of many of the other reviews and used hard salami.  I also dried the roasted peppers with paper towels so it wouldn't get soggy.  I baked the bottom layer of crescent rolls for 6 min before I added the layers.

I took this to a New Year's Eve bash and it was a HUGE hit!!!  I changed it a little though.  I used blacked forest ham and shredded mozzarella and med. cheddar cheese.  I only used one egg as well.  I've already been asked to make this one again and look forward to making a veggie one!

This is a wonderful, very filling appetizer.  My whole plate was gobbled up on Xmas day!  I Pre-cooked the bottom crust 6 min, patted dry the peppers, did not use pepperoni, and cooked 40 min. uncovered, and broiled the top for 5 min. to make it look really golden.  Excellent!

I used Smoked Gouda instead of provolone and baked the bottom layer for a few minuted first as others had suggested. Everybody at the party devoured it and I have had multiple requests for the recipe.

I substituted the roasted red bell pepper for mixed pickled veggies (carrot, cucumber, onion, red bell pepper) and added a can of sliced black olived. I drained really well and patted dry with paper towels. I also added 1/4 tsp of dried oregano to the parmesan egg mixture. It was really yummy and tasted more like a muffaletta sandwich!

Really easy to make and EVERYONE loves it!  Made this for girls game night and everyone loved these little sandwiches.  I did use hard salami instead of Genoa and it tasted better.  No other changes, very simple and very delicious!  To heat up the next day.. heat it up in a skillet to get the same flakey crust!

These were excelent.  I made them exactly as written (I did make my own roasted peppers) and it was a huge hit at bowling night.  Very easy to make and they travel well.  Will definitely make them again.

I made half with chicken and mushrooms, and I substituted the cheeses listed with just provolone and mozzarella. I eliminated the peppers. My whole family loved it.

Yum, Yum, Yum! This recipe is sooo good. I used the Garlic and butter crescent rolls and upped the temp, but I had to lower it to get it cooked in the middle. I suggest following the recipe exactly, making sure that you dry your peppers really well and you will have an amazing recipe. I had it for dinner with a salad, and then cold as a late night snack and both were FAB!!!!!! Give this one a try you won't regret it!

This is good warm and room temp.  Perfect to take to a party.  I made it with hard salami instead of genoa, but cooked as directed and it turns out great!

This was really good. I baked the bottom crust for 6 minutes at 375. I then layered it as directed, covered with foil and baked for 25 minutes at 375. I uncovered it then baked for 20 more minutes. It was a little overcooked so next time i'll cook uncovered for 13-15 minutes.  It was perfect for a rainy Sunday night supper like tonight!

Excellent! I followed most of the Most Helpful reviews about patting dry the peppers and changing the cooking temp, etc. This is great to serve for parties cut into little squares... just make sure to let it cool and set a bit before cutting it. I always have people ask me how I made it.

This recipe was a hit.  I took it to a wine tasting party and it went great with the theme.  I greased the bottom of my pan before I put the crescent roll down.  Also, I didn't add the pepperoni cuz I thought it might be too much, mistake!!!  It needed the pepperoni and next time I'm adding it.  :)

This ia a very good recipe. Very easy to make and everyone (especially the guys) love it. My husbands poker group always asks him (that's funny) to make it and bring with him on game nights.  The only drawback is the guy or gal at the deli counter isnt a huge fan of mine when I order 5 items of only 1/4 pound each! LOL  Definitely a keeper!

This always is a hit at parties. I bake the bottom crust as recommended by others and dry off the peppers to keep everything from getting too soggy. The combo of flavors is fantastic!

Fantastic!!!  Took these to a gathering last night and everyone loved them.  Took the suggestions of others and pre-baked by bottom crust for about 6 minutes and dried off the peppers.  On one half of the squares I sprinkled on some chopped black olives, both w/and w/o where great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just finished making/eating this YUMMO I was very pleased w the flavor and texture.  I too baked the bottom for 6 minutes then applied all the ingrediants and baked uncovered for the full 20 minutes.  The only change I made to the recipe was I brushed the bottom with garlic in olive oil.  This is a great recipe thanks :)

All I can say is FANTASTIC!!!  I substituted the deli meats and used hickory smoked turkey breast, turkey pastrami and turkey pepperoni.  I also used 2 eggs instead of 3.  I did not experience a soggy bottom crust.  It was firm and very tasty.  My kids loved it and I will definitely add it to our monthly dinner menu.  Thx Lori for sharing this recipe with us.

I followed the directions to a tee, but added a few more Italian cold cuts.  I guess I was expecting something amazing.  Although the squares were tasty, I cannot give this recipe more than 3 stars.  I'll look for another recipe.

Made this for our Steeler Superbowl Party this past Sunday.  Everybody went crazy for these.  My boyfriend said this was the best appetizer he's ever had.  I do agree, you will have to pre-bake the lower crescent roll crust first.  I only pre-baked it for 6 minutes but I should have even baked it longer since the middle part was a bit doughy but overall this was a big big hit!!

WOW! I made 5 platters of this amazing appetizer for a wedding of my mom's friend and she said that she didn't even get a chance to taste them, people were all over them! This is a very customizable recipe and I used a mexican blend of shredded cheese, and added paprika, oregano, and some other herbs and spices to the egg mixture for a little more flavor. This is very easy to make and makes amazing appetizers. Use any kind of meats and cheeses that you'd like and any kind of crescent roll brand/type that you'd like and it will always work well. A lot cheaper than buying pre-made appetizers at publix or Wal-mart super center hot-food deli. Next time I make them I'll be sure to add a picture.

These were really good, but a little on the expensive side.  Will surely make them again, but not often.

These ROCK.  One thing to pay attention to- you must separate the egg mixture.  I always forget to do that.  You have to reserves some for the wash on top.  So good hot and just as good at room temp.

I made this a couple times during the holidays for my son and his college buddies.  THEY LOVED IT.  They only thing I would added is more lunchmeat, and my son suggested "hot" yellow peppers like in the sub sandwiches that he loves.  I also did dry the red peppers as in previous posts.  LOVE THIS RECIPE and IT'S A KEEPER!

Easy to put together & came out perfectly - just didn't think there was any kind of bold flavors. It was quite bland. I think I'll try it again next time & add a layer of fresh basil leaves.  It just needed a boost. It was a great finger food though.

Big hit as an appetizer.  Left the peppers off as my peeps dont like them.  Never put the foil on so it was a little overly browned.  I just forgot to read that part.  We did have the marinara for dipping but my boyfriend thinks he would like to dip them in ranch so maybe you can have a choice of dips.  Will make again.

I made this dish for the first time for a football party we had. It was a huge hit. EVERYONE asked me for the recipe. I did make a few changes though. I added some mozarella and feta cheese and some olive salad for flavor. It was excellent.

These were fantastic!!  I didn't have the roasted red peppers, so I sauteed a red bell pepper in some olive oil and added that.  I left out the pepperoni, too.  I took the advice of others and baked it at 375...it turned out perfectly! :)

I make a very similar recipe, that  will eliminate the soggy crust problem. I call it pizza bread.  I coat an oblong pizza pan with garlic oil and stretch out the pizza dough, then layer all the dry ingredients in this recipe on top of the dough and spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the dry ingredients, sprinkle garlic powder on top and roll it lengthwise.  Pull the dough over the ends to seal and place it with the seam side down.  Bake at 375 for 45 min.  Slice and serve warm . This also freezes well.

Wow, this is great! The peppers are an absolute must. I didn't change a thing about the recipe. I didn't precook the bottom shell. The only problem I had was probably one of inexperience. The bottom crescent roll dough did not reach to the side of the 9 x 13 dish. I layered the ingredients on top of the dough and when I poured on the eggs, they ran to the side of the dish. Next time I will extend the layers to the side of the dish (overlapping the dough) so that the egg mixture will stay internal to the squares. This one definitely goes in the recipe box.

This was good, but too rich for a main course.  It's best cut up in smaller squares/triangles and served as an appetizer.

These are pretty good!  I kept thinking I needed something to dip it in, maybe because it does taste like a version of pizza, with no sauce!  It would be a good appetizer, or a main dish with a green salad!  Will make again for something different.

I thought the flavors were really good together, but that the bottom doesn't really get cooked enough.  It is still a little on the doughy side.  Next time, I may trying baking the dough first for before filling them.

Excellent!!  I used gouda and mozzarella because it's all I had and it was still great. Also roasted my own red pepper.   Definately let it cool at least 30 minutes if you want nice clean cut squares.  Glass baking dish is a must. Thanks for a great recipe.

I missed the suggestion (until now) to partially cook the bottom layer, and that was unfortunate.  The edge pieces got ecstatic reviews from my husband and son but the middle was a gloopy mess on the bottom - the crust didn't cook hardly at all.  I also tried to pat dry the peppers and didn't use all of the egg mixture.  Next time (if there is a next time), I'll cook the bottom crescent layer first and roast my own peppers.  5 stars for flavor (although I personally thought they were way too rich), 3 for the wasted middle of the pan.

delicious! my husband - a picky eater - loved these.  I baked the bottom crust about 5 minutes and added mozzarella to replace the swiss.  I couldn't find any red pepper so didn't add that but, otherwise, followed the recipe and it was fantastic! definitely will make again.

This is the best recipe I have ever gotten. So many people have asked me for it! Just be careful to cook it long enough to brown and don't put too much of the egg mixture on top or it could come out too soggy. Otherwise, it is pure heaven!!

i just might make this again! the crescent roll looked hardly strong enough to stand up to all the filling but it sliced nice and is great hot OR cold! it especially liked the pepper and cheese mix in the egg. sprinkled with sesame seeds for eye appeal--this is a winner!

SO good and not hard at all.  Very filling - so if you are making for a party - don't try and make enough servings for everyone at the party.

These were easier than I thought they would be.  Followed the recipe exactly, but baked at 375.  Not soggy.  Heated up great the next day too.  I added chopped banana peppers to mine.  Many people at my party commented how good they were.

My family devoured the squares.  I followed others suggestions and baked the bottom crust for 6 minutes; drained peppers with paper towels to absorb extra moisture, added a little oregeno over egg mixture and let cool for 10 minutes before cutting.  I used an electric knife for nice clean cuts.  I can't wait to make these again, they were very easy and delicious!

These were really tasty, but very greasy. I didn't have a problem with the bottom being soggy; I drained and dried the red pepper strips very thoroughly. I baked at 375* for 20 minutes with the foil, then removed the foil and baked for an additional 20 minutes. The crust was perfect. The only problem I had was cutting into nice squares, it just didn't work out too well. So my presentation wasn't the greatest, but I guess they tasted great because I had ten people ask for the recipe. I'll make this again, and hopefully have better luck cutting them into squares.

Quite tasty. A little too greasy, but that's just the crescent dough. If only they made them with reduced butter!
I made as stated, and didn't have any sogginess.

Pretty easy, and they did get rave reviews.  I think I might add some spicier cold cuts next time - I thought the were a little bland.  Or maybe add some pepperoncini.  I used a 15" x 11" jelly roll pan and 4 pkgs of crescent rolls worked perfectly.   Took about 30 minutes to bake, though.  No problems with soggy bottom layer, although since I was using a bigger pan I might have gone a little thin with the egg/cheese mixture (4 eggs & about 1/3 cup parmesan).        I was sort of eyeballing it.        Not my favorite appetizer, but like I said everyone loved them so they are now part of the rotation!

While we enjoyed this recipe as is, a couple of suggestions;allow to cool before eating and do not cover - will get soggy.  Best eaten shortly after making.  Almost any combination of meats and cheeses work.  I used ham, turkey, smoked turkey, provalone and fontina and left out the peppers and parmesan.  Sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with assorted jams - very easy Monte Cristo without the mess of frying - yum!

I read about the problems with the bottom crust, so I prebaked the bottom crust for about 8 minutes at 350 and let it cool some as I made the egg mixture and gathered the rest of the ingredients. I took it to a pot luck and everyone raved about it. I will definately make it again. A little pricey, but worth it. I also used a real ham rather than a water added ham product to cut down on water content. Delish!

Didn't use the peppers, but with salami & sausage and all that cheese, how can you go wrong?  (I'm a cheese lover.)  It was good, but maybe not quite as good as I expected.  It may have been because I used turkey pepperoni and fat free Swiss.  I use low-fat versions all the time and am quite used to it, but this might be something that just wants the real thing.  I doubt I'd make it again, simple because I don't tend to have this combination of ingredients on hand (was trying to use some stuff up from another recipe but then had to buy more stuff to make this).  But these are pretty cool looking and would be great for a party -- might even deign to add the peppers on half of them for that. :-)  EDIT 2011:  Decided to up this to 5 stars.  I actually did make it again and this time used real pepperoni and full-fat Swiss.  I don't know if that made the difference or it was just my mood.

This turned out great, I think the trick is to let it cool at least a 1/2 hour or so before cutting into it.  I left out the ham and swiss, I didn't increase the other meats but I did increase the provalone.  I layered from the bottom, rolls, pepperoni, red pepper (drained, rinsed, dried), cheese, salami, rolls.  I then baked covered for 30 minutes, uncovered for 25.  They turned out perfect.  Next time my husband is begging me to add fresh basil.

These were fair.  I'm not a big red bell pepper fan.  Next time, I would omit the peppers.

You couldn't ask for a better appetizer for a party - - it has all the right stuff:  easy, can be made ahead and kept in the fridge until ready to bake, and it is absolutely delicious.  I made 2 of these for a large party and everyone loved them!!

I made these for a Super Bowl party and they were very well received.  They were a little greasy so I tonight I'm trying them with the reduced fat rolls.  They are very addictive!

This was GREAT!!!  Made for Superbowl party and all the guys loved it. I increased oven temp to 375, patted the roasted peppers very dry, and added thinly sliced green bell pepper and onion.  Not soggy at all.  Sure to be a hit!

We don't like the roasted red peppers on it but it does need something on it, like banana peppers, pepperoncinis or something to change up the flavor a little bit...but this is a favorite everytime I make it!

Took this to a dinner party and it was a big hit.  I did pre-bake the bottom crust for about six minutes at 350.  I also thought that 350 seemed a bit low and increased my oven temp to 375 which made for a firmer crust.  Would recommend eating these warm as they do tend to get soggy at room temp.

Though I admit I was skeptical of this dish when I put it in the oven (and even part way through cooking when I took the foil off) it ended up looking and tasting great, and was loved by all at the party where I served it.

A winner! I served it at room temp for an appetizer party. It's rich enough to cut into much smaller pieces, or even serve as a lunch. Be sure to get the cold cuts sliced thin.

My family loved these. I followed the tip to pat the roasted peppers with a paper towel. There's no need to prebake the crust, in my opinion. The recipe says can be served at room temp, but these are best served warm.

This was awesome.  I made two changes - I used 6 eggs instead of 3 and I added a layer of caponata (italian eggplant/olive spread).  I really liked the caponata but the egg part still needed tweaking.  I think next time instead of adding the raw eggs I'll add in a layer of sliced hardboiled eggs.  
Also, don't make this the day before - though it tasted good the texture was all wrong. Best served fresh.  Really really delicious!

I cater small scale affairs and I made this for a fancy-schmancy cocktail party for doctors, lawyers, professionals, etc. and it was such a hit.  They went on and on about how fabulous they were.  I served it with sides of Red Pepper Coulis and Pesto for dipping.  I guarantee I will make these many times again!

Read many reviews before making this and I decided to go with the pizza crust. Good choice. The crust was crispy and perfect. I didnt' use the pepperoni because I felt the salami was enough. This was delicious and a huge hit on New Years Eve. Thank you Lori!

I made this for my Christmas party and got RAVE reviews! The guys were fighting for the last square :) I always change recipes, so I used these meats/cheeses instead: hard salami, provolone, ham and fresh mozzarella. I also don't care for roasted peppers, so I put a bottle of italian antipasto veggies in the food processor with some olive tapenade and made a chunky spread for the top layer- everyone loved the flavor of this! Thanks for the recipe, I will certainly be making this again!

Always a hit at a party. A little pricey to make. May need some extra time to cook without the foil.

This is Great and EASY. I would recommend cutting up the coldcuts into smaller pieces, This way you can cut up the squares with messing it up. You can pretty much subsitute any meat and make it mexican or irish, etc. Definately will do this again!!!

I made this several times and they are always a big hit.  I am a big fan of improvization so I change some of the ingredients from time to time.  I use Mexican blend cheese for the Swiss, broccoli for the red peppers, etc.  You really can't mess this one up.

This was very tasty! I made it for a monday night football gathering. I was worried about it being soggy so I made sure to cut down on the amount of red peppers and I patted them dry with paper towels. I ended up cooking it for 30 minutes covered and 30 minutes uncovered. I liked the taste of the crossaint dough, although my husband wants to try pizza dough next time. An excellent recipe for a gathering :)

This is a keeper; with a few modifications.  Use canned pizza doe in place of the crescent doe...it falls into the baking dish nicley.  I attempted to use the crescent doe and became very frustrated...very hard to work with.  I baked, covered for 20 minutes at 375 degrees and baked uncovered, at 400 degrees, for an additional 20 minutes.  Turned out very crispy and my family loved it (made it for the Super Bowl).  Next time I will experiment with different toppings, i.e.whatever you may order on a pizza.

This recipe is wonderful.  I did not use the pepperoni because of what others had said and just added a little more ham and salami.  Also if you have the time, make your own roasted bell peppers.  The taste is awesome!!!!

These are good. I am a little tired of recipes that use "refrigerated crescent rolls" though. I wonder how this would turn out if I used frozen puff pastry instead?

Received rave reviews for this recipe.  I used Black Forest Ham and I felt it was too strong a flavor.  Next time I'll stick to the boiled ham.
Make this dish, you will not be sorry!

Awesome & easy recipe!  It's a meal in itself served with a little salad and some sauce for dipping.  I roasted my own red peppers, added some thinly sliced onion and a little italian seasoning.  My boyfriend ate the leftovers cold the next day and has already requested I make it again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe Lori!

A very easy and delicious appy. This was well received and some of my friends were mad I made such a dish on a Friday night during Lent, they said it wasn't fair!  You couldn't even tell there was eggs in this, for anyone who was concerned with that.  Very filling and rich, so make sure you cut the squares on the smaller side.  If I have an occasion to make these again, I will.  Thanks for the post Lori!

I make this appetizer all the time.  It is very delicious.  You have to cook it longer after removing the foil.  A good 20 minutes because the eggs aren't cooked and I put my oven @ 375F when I remove the foil.  I have been e-mailing this recipe quite often.

By far one of the best appetizers that I have "shared" with a group.  Everyone wanted the recipe!  I have also had it for dinner with a tossed salad.  Served both hot and room temperature.  Very versatile and delicious.  Thanks.

Ahhh... The suduction of deli meat. You gotta expect only good can come out of combining sliced meat, cheese and crescent rolls. Men cheered and women swooned as I placed this delectable dish onto the pot luck buffet table. Hats off to you Ms. Lori G.!

This is the best recipe on this site!  10 Stars!  Thank you!  Only changes recommended would be to use low fat/less greasy versions of meats.

I love this recipe!  I've made it for company a few times and got rave reviews both times.  The best part it how easy it is to make.  FYI - I kept the red peppers out so it would be more kid friendly (kids can get very picky about what they eat).  I have yet to put them in, but I don't think they are needed.  It has plenty of wonderul flavor without.

Made it for a friend gathering. Everyone loved it. Glad I read the reviews. Baked bottom layer for 6 minutes, seasoned with Italian seasoning & grated Parmesan cheese. Used chopped black olives instead of red peppers. Very good!

This was excellent.  Took it to a neighborhood party and had many compliments and requests for the recipe which I gladly shared.  The only ingredient I changed slightly was the ham, choosing smoked ham in place of boiled ham, because I thought it would be drier and eliminate having a soggy crust. I also layered the cheese next to the crust, both top and bottom, again to keep any excess moisture from the crust. So my order of layering was cheese, ham, salami, pepperoni, peppers, egg mixture, cheese and to crust. This was so good and easy to serve. Will make again.

I made this yesterday for a potluck for the first time! Everyone loved it, including my husband. I followed others suggestions and baked the bottom crust for 6 minutes before assembling. I added tomato pesto to the bottom layer before the meat & cheese and sprinkled garlic powder on the top layer! I baked at 375 instead of 350 - tin foil on for 30mins and then baked without tin foil for 20mins . This was not wet or mushy on the bottom at all. 
My husband said it was fantastic, but to serve with some sort of mustard next time. A crowd pleaser!

I donât think the crescent rolls are a good choice for this recipe. Theyâre too sweet. Next time Iâm going to use a refrigerated pizza dough. And pre bake the bottom so that itâs cooked. Iâd also eliminate the egg mixture. Donât see how it adds anything. Iâd use the grated Parmesan but not the eggs

I made them for bunco night at the house.  I used the pre-sliced and packaged meat tray from Sam's Club.  It made it easier than buying the meats individually.  The girls liked them, and I thought they were delicious, but there were leftovers, and I found out that left overs don't hold up well; the crescent rolls get soggy on the bottom.  Would be great to serve at a football game get together.

I took this to a neighborhood party, and people enjoyed it.  I followed the suggestions~BAKE the bottom crust for 5-6 min. before adding meat & cheese, and DON'Tuse the foil until the end! (last 15 min.)  
   I gave it 4 stars b/c I thought it was a little bland. Next time, I think I'll try a sundried tomato or pesto spread on the baked crust +garlic or onion powder. Still, it's a keeper!

My husband and I liked it a lot. We did add pesto and garlic. There wasn't anything that wasn't good about it. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was because I thought it could use maybe a little marinara or something. But my husband loved it.

Iâm giving this a low rating, but in fairness to Lori, I have to say I made changes to her recipe based on MANY reviews.  Although I dislike criticizing a recipe that has been altered from the original, I do so for the purpose of warning others to NOT DO WHAT I DID.  I made a double batch (two casseroles) of this to take to my womenâs meeting last night.  I followed the recipes with these suggestions: 

I pre-heated my oven to 375 degrees;
I left out the salt (an improvement); 
I added a very thin layer of sun dried tomato pesto to the bottom crust (a big improvement);
I pre-baked the bottom crust after adding the sun dried tomato pesto (6 minutes) (an improvement); 
I added 2 teaspoon of minced roasted garlic to each batch (an improvement); 
I use d Black Forest Ham (itâs much drier than boiled ham and has a better flavor - also an improvement);
I added VERY WELL DRIED red pepper strips (I think this is what my ladies found objectionable).  
-------------
I think the next time I make this (and I will), I will remove the casserole(s) from the oven 10 minutes early and spoon a thin layer of sun dried tomato pesto to the top crust and return it to the oven to finish baking.  When it comes out of the oven, Iâll give it a light sprinkling of Mozzarella Cheese and a few (patted dry) black olive slices and maybe a 1/4 cup of chopped red pepper (raw and patted dry).  I think this would dress it up a bit before cutting into squares.

Making this recipe is a little pricey, but it smel

We loved it!  I baked the crust for 6 minutes before adding toppings like other reviewers suggested, still the crust was a bit soft (under baked).  I added mozzarella cheese as the first layer and then the remaining meats and cheeses.  Overall, this was a good recipe to try on a Friday night.  I will make this again.

I made this recipe as written except for the peppers which I did not have on hand. They were very tasty but I gave 4 stars because I thought they were a bit too salty....and I love salt. I think I will try pizza crusts next time to see how that works out.

This is so good and I cant wait to make it again! I took the advise of others and baked bottom crust 5 minutes first. I did not use the roasted red peppers. I did a layer of finely  chopped onions and green peppers. I served this topped with shredded  lettuce, chopped purple onion and grape tomatoes with a very light drizzle zesty Italian dressing. I want to try the pesto sauce next time. This is a keeper!!

I didn't enjoy these. I found them too heavy, and on the greasy side.

I have made this two times. The first time I carefully followed the instructions. The second time instead of pieces I made 12 mini bite-size dumpling appetizers. They were really good and my family loved them. Next time i'm planning on making my own crispy bread to surround the inside ingredients.Thumbs up!

This is delicious and easy. As one reviewer suggested, I would pat the peppers and the ham to remove excess moisture. I put it in my recipe book.  It works out well halved using an  8x8 pan. This is such a versatile recipe (you can vary your meats, cheeses and veggies.

This was a great recipe....I had my doubts but tried it anyway and it was a big hit at the super bowl party. The only things I did different was I pre baked the bottom crust for 5 mins at 350. And I added a little bit of garlic jack cheese to the other cheeses, maybe only 2 slices. This has great flavor and was really easy to assemble.

Very good and was devoured in less than 30 minutes! I will use more ham next time. I didn't use Swiss, but instead replaced it with  shredded mozzarella instead I also dried the roasted red peppers as other users have done. I need more eggs than the 2 in the recipe, I used 4 and 1 for the egg wash. Over all, very tasty!!

This may have been a little time consuming to put together, but I thought it was well worth it.  I following others advice and cooked the bottom layer 6 mins first, but it should have been only four.   I used 6oz of mixed cold cuts, 2oz turkey pepperoni, and 6oz sliced turkey breast to cut down on the grease factor others reported, baked, and chilled a day in the fridge and had no trouble cutting into small snack size squares.

Like the others, I pre-baked the bottom crescent layer for 6 minutes prior to adding the interior ingredients.  Next time I will omit the egg mixture inside, as it added an odd flavor to the mix. It made it almost breakfast-like.  I also recommend adding an interior spread or dip to kick it up a notch. Otherwise the flavors are pretty benign.

Don't really care for the taste of crescent rolls, but this looked fun and easy.  Was so disappointed that the lady at the deli counter left the plastic on some of the meat.  Not a cheap dos to ruin with cooked plastic.

I've made it a few times, and based on other comments I did a few things differently.  I spread the bottom layer of crescent rolls, top with sundried tomato pesto and the red peppers, then prebake for 10 minutes.  I microwaved the pepperoni on paper towels to soak up some grease.  Finally, I put an extra layer of crescent rolls in the middle, which helped absorb some grease.  These were a huge hit at the party!

These were just the thing I was looking for to take on one of our winery visits!  Most, if not all, of our group of 9 dislike red peppers so I left those out, as well as the swiss cheese which I subbed in mozzarella. I also sprinkled some Italian herb seasoning on this before putting the top layer of crescent roll on. This is easy to make and delicious!  I took along some marinara sauce and that put these over the top.  We ate them while they were room temperature, but hubby & I sampled while warm.  Both ways are great!  These make a perfect take-along food for picnics, etc.  Not one square was brought home, even the two-year-old ate one and smacked his lips - yummy!  My bottom layer was not one bit soggy and I did not pre-bake it. The baking times and temperature were spot-on for me as well.  This will be made often.

Wow yummy! Made this for my boyfriend for dinner and he ate three slices.  I left the pan out for my roomies to eat and thought i'd be able to take some to work the next day to share; but no, they devoured every last morsel.  And now everyone keeps asking me to make it again! Super easy, quick to assemble!

Wonderful recipe. I, too, bake the bottom crust for 8 mins. Then I add a thin layer of pesto, a couple tablespoons of minced onion, and a generous shaking of Italian seasoning. Two eggs is plenty for us.

This was a really big hit at our party recently.  I had to wing it on the crescent roll portions a little since I could only find 8 oz cans instead of 10, but I just used 3 (8 oz) cans instead of 2 (10 oz). Even with what may have been an extra 4 oz of thickness they turned out lovely though.  Thank you!!

Made these yesterday for a bridal shower I was throwing and they were the hit of all the food!  OK - I followed the recipe with the changes that were suggested in many of the posts. So what I did:

1. I precooked the bottom layer of crescent rolls about 7-8 minutes at 375. I brushed them with a thin layer of basil pesto before baking.   
2. I drained and dried the roasted peppers and the honey roasted ham between layers of paper towels for a good 20 minutes, changing out the paper towels a couple of times. (next time I wlll do this in advance -Even a day a head of time if I am busy and stick them in a tupperware until use)
3. Next - I first layered provolone so that there was a layer of cheese between and of the foods that could potentially make it soggy. So provolone, roasted peppers, salami, honey roasted ham, muenster (didn't have swiss), garlic salt, pepperoni, egg mixture.  I just used about 4 eggs per pan. Then final layer of crecsent rolls. 

I didn't have enough eggs to do a final egg wash on top and it was totally fine.   I baked at 375 for 20 minutes with foil, then 20-25 mins without. (just watch them at the end).  I let them settle and cool - do not cover with foil while cooling!

Cut them into squares. Served!  Huge hit! Today a day later they are still so good warmed up and eaten for snacks! I will make them often. It is a little pricey as far as ingredients so truth is I will only make them for my own parties :) Or only very special potlucks. LOL.

It's the one recipe (although a bit pricey) that I always return to when there's an event at work, church or even when I want to spoil hubby a little bit! Followed the first reviewer's comments and they always turn out! One thing we definitely change is the swiss cheese for pepper jack. :)

I made these for Christmas Eve this year, and they were THE HIT of the night! They can be served hot or room temp and they are fabulous either way (my mom even mentioned that she ate one cold and it was still delicious). It is a must to drain and pat dry the peppers, and I diced them (then patted dry again) to make it easier to spread evenly. All I did differently was pre-bake the bottom layer, use one extra egg, and a TINY bit of egg wash (one egg, skim milk) on top. I am making them again for my New Year's Eve party, and I may add a little sun-dried tomato pesto to the bottom layer of crescent rolls when I pre-bake it. 

Bottom line- YUM!!!

This was delicious! The only thing we changed was we did not use the red peppers, my kids don't care from them. My three year old is rather picky and she asked for leftovers for lunch until it was gone!

This is the best appetizer! I didn't change a thing. It is great because it kind of has everything in it (cheese, meat, bread, red peppers). It's very attractive, too. People scarf it up.

This is good, however, I served it as a meal with a salad, and it was a bit much. I think cut into small pieces as an appetizer or served as one of many nibblers, it would be perfect.
As per many reviews I had read, I baked the bottom crust 7 mins, and really, really patted all moisture out of the peppers, and texture was perfect. BTW, I'm saying "I" made this, but my 11 yrs old son actually made it under moms' supervision...to say how simple it is to make :)

I just made this for a superbowl party that I'm going to shortly.  Since I doubled the recipe, I thought I would try it before leaving for the party.  This is pretty good.  I skipped the ham and just used salami and pepperoni.  I also used both provolone and muester cheese and followed the suggestions of others in terms of pre-baking the bottom crust and draining the peppers.  I added some garlic powder in the eggs and used pillsbury french bread instead of crescent dinner rolls.  My only minor complaint is that I had a hard time with how to serve these.  I'm just going to cut the whole pan into a bunch of squares and put a spatula out (it's a superbowl party - it doesn't have to be too fancy).  Otherwise, the flavor was really good.  Next time, I would use more cheese.

Have made this several times and have always been asked for the recipe.  It has been met with rave reviews by young and old.  My only suggestion would be to pat dry the roasted peppers before adding them.

Made this twice and it was really good.  The only thing I changes was that I used the Pillsbury pizza dough instead of crescent dough.  I also did bake the dough for about 5 minutes first.  Great recipe that can be customized easily.

I baked the bottom garlic crescent roll crust for 6 ", spread that with sun dried tomato pesto (can't handles peppers)
and laid out all the towel dried meats and cheeses before topping with the other garlic crust.  I forgot to put the foil on it until about 20" into the baking, so I did it backwards and it turned out perfectly !  I did have the oven at 400 deg. since I was baking something else at the same time, but it did not dry out or get too brown.  It was a hit and everyone wanted the recipe.

I've made this twice this month and it was a hit at both parties.  Several requests for the recipe.  I altered the recipe (as someone mentioned here) by adding the sun dried tomato pesto layer - great touch.  Also, can substitute the roasted red peppers for fried zucchini cut into thin circles.

Super easy.  I added 1 tsp of garlic powder to egg mixture. Don't forget to prick the top or it puffs up. Cooked it at 375.  Took it to work for a potluck. Everyone really enjoyed. I refrigerated over night. I've made it 2x since!

Excellent appetizer recipe!  Made a few changes.  Used proscuitto instea of boiled ham.  Added 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper, 1/4 tsp. onion powder, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. Italian seasoning to egg mixture & used only 2 eggs instead of 3.  Worked perfectly.  Baked 1st layer of dough at 375 deg. for 6 mins., let cool then started layers and also added 1/2 cup Mozzerella cheese as 1 layer.  Baked the entire dish at 375 deg. covered w/foil for 25 mins. then removed foil & baked an additional 20 mins. to obtain fluffy & golden brown crust.  The squares were cut after allowing dish to cool for about 30 minutes.  Cut into perfect squares and still warm enough to serve right away.  This appetizer was a hit!  Everyone wants the recipe!

I took this to work for our Christmas luncheon and it was the first dish gone. I had at least 10 people ask for the recipe. I cut it into bite size pieces and served with toothpicks on a platter. I got about 40 pieces doing it this way. The only thing I did different from the recipe was to cook the bottom crust as suggested by many reviewers. I can't wait to eat these right out of the oven, but delicious at room temp as well.

I won't list the things I changed, but overall these were super! I think they were even better heated up the next day. We had them for dinner - kind of a substitute pizza. Looking forward to the next time!!

This was great for our holiday party. I did follow advice to pre-bake the bottom and I dried the ham and red peppers as well as I could. I added black olives to half of it and I also subbed mozz for swiss as I do not care for it.
I served it in small pieces with warm marinara sauce and it was a hit. Thanks

I needed something different to bring to a work party, I usually bring dessert. I tested on my family for a birthday party the weekend before....EVERYONE LOVED IT! The only suggestion that was to add some sauce for dipping. What a HIT! I received the same reaction at the work party....I printed out the recipes for everyone1 GREAT FOR FOOTBALL SEASON!

Sooooooooooooo good. Didn't have a problem with soggy bottoms, but that might be because I miss read the recipe and did it on a cookie sheet. I made the cover more tent-like and had air circulating. oops, at least it wasn't soggy. It makes a fabulous dinner for at home movie night.

I made this last night for dinner this was awesome!!!!! I would make this again,and the only change that I would try would be to add some thinly sliced onion I think that would be good. I also did pat dry the peppers, I didn't have any problem with soggy bread mine turn out golden brown.

This is a big hit every time I make it.  The only thing I do differently is cut back on the amount of provolone & swiss cheeses.  It is a little bit too rich when you use the full amount of cheese.  I have never had a problem with it being soggy, and I have made it many times.  It is good served hot or at room temperature.  I bring copies of the recipe with me when I take it to parties, becasue a few people always ask for it!

I add just a little more parmesan because let's face it you can never have enough!  Otherwise, this recipe is superb and always draws rave reviews.

I made these for a superbowl party and they were a huge hit! I used peppered turkey breast, honey ham and salami. I omitted the roasted red peppers as no one in my family cares for them. Delicious!

These were great! I used Sandwich pepperoni, honey ham, swiss & provolone cheese with sweet red peppers from a jar. The peppers made the sandwich. I used Pillsbury cresent rolls. I will make these again and keep switching up the sandwich meat. I used a cookie sheet and followed the baking directions for length of time to the "T": Thanks for the idea!

I made this for my friend's annual Superbowl bash and it was received splendidly!  I didn't have any sogginess issues or anything like others have mentioned so it must be a difference in oven temperature.  I will be making this again and again!

I had really high hopes for this recipe but I ended up not liking it all that much. I think maybe I would leave the peppers out next time as they seemed to make the whole dish soggy (even after I carefully and thoroughly towel dried each pepper) and also try a different brand of biscuits..very expensive for mediocre reviews...

Very good, but I did have the same problem as other reviewers- soggy bottom crust. I will make again & maybe precook the bottom crust a little before I put everything on top.

oh my gosh... these are so good.  Next time, I am going to cook the bottom layer of crescents first and then add the layers, and put back in the oven.  The bottom was alittle doughy compared to the top.

This recipe was delicious.
I brought it to a superbowl party and got so many compliments on it.
It was practically all gone by the end.
I was very afraid it was going to be soggy like everyone said, but it wasn't that bad because I cooked it on 375 instead of 350 and pat dried the peppers.
I recommend this for a party, or gettogether. 
Its a great munchie, and good with pizza sause.

I LOVE this recipe, and apparently so do my friends....everywhere I bring it everyone is always askig for the recipe, and now all of my friends are taking it to functions of their own!  The only changes I made were using all of the 3 egg/cheese mixture on the inside and then I use 1 aditional egg/cheese mixture to brush the top with, then I sprinkle it with Oregano prior to baking. Hmmmm, LOVE IT!  Just make sure to let it cool enough, one of my friends cut it into serving pieces as soon as it came out of the oven and it wasn't set up yet, so it was really runny.

My husband would give this ten stars if possible.  I made this for dinner one night thinking it would just be a quick and easy meal.  Well, it was, but it has also become a family favorite!  My husband requests this all the time now, and even my 3 year old thinks it's great.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were really well received at my cocktail party- everyone said they were like little squares of heaven! The only problem I had was that I did have to roll out the crescent roll dough a little- it was a little too short for the pan. Also, I did bake the crust for 6 minutes before putting the toppings on.

Turned out great!  I followed some of the advice about putting the crust in the oven for 6 or so minutes and it was cooked just right.  These had great flavor and didn't turn out too greasy.  I did let them cool a bit before cutting and they stayed to gether nicely.

These are perfect for Sunday game day, there is a lot of meat/cheese to these. They are alot like a hot pocket but much better :) The only thing I changed was that I used smoked turkey instead of ham. Strongly suggest letting them set for at least 10-15 min. before cutting. The whole family loved them, my husband & son both said it needed more meat but they love extra meat, I will definately add more turkey to the next batch. This recipe can be very versatile by just changing the meats & cheeses. Definitely a keeper in our house.

Delicious and so easy to make.  I cooked them a little longer than suggested and had no problem with soggy bottom crust.  Also patted the peppers dry with a paper towel before adding them.  Everyone loved them and I'll definitely be making them again.  Thanks for sharing this one.

I tried this last night and the best thing I can say about it, is it was really easy.  I precooked the crust as suggested, so it wasn't soggy, it cut up nice.  However, it was really bland.  Served brown mustard on the side to spice it up.  It was way too much fat and salt for very little favor.  Will not make again.

Not the most healthy thing in the world, but very tasty! Great for when you have company over to watch a game.

I had this at a party and everyone raved about it, several asked for the recipe.  I did not use ham though, I used several different italian cuts of meats.  I had to cook it a little longer uncovered, but I was cooking other things at the time.  This is a top notch dish, will definitly be a favorite at my home!

I used extra lean turkey bacon and thinly sliced turkey instead of the suggested meats.  I omitted the red peppers.  Baked at 375 instead of 350.  Added basic italian herbs and garlic salt to the egg mixture.  Since I was cooking for a party, I converted in into finger foods by slicing it into small squares (about 60 total if cut into 6 rows x 10 columns), and sticking a fancy toothpick in each one.  It was quite a hit.

This was very good,however I'm only giving it 4 stars due to the saltiness. I even left out the swiss and pepperoni! I loved the roasted peppers inside. I used a jar with red and yellow peppers. I'll try again using other deli meats and more peppers.

I made them for our super bowl party and they were GREAT. Everyone loved them!! They were very easy to make and I was a little nervous about pouring the egg mixture on top of the peppers but they came out perfect. This will definitely be a repeater in our house. Thanks for sharing!!

These got rave reviews at my Thanksgiving potluck!  They went like crazy!  Didn't change a thing except for chopping the peppers instead of leaving them in strips so they wouldn't come out stringy when you took a bite.  Great flavor and lots of people asked for the recipe!!

I cooked the bottom crust for 4 minutes, drained the peppers really well and it was sill soggy on the bottom. :(  I still ate it but noome else would.  Flavor was good maybe I will just do this on an already made bread.

Really great!  I have had this 3 times over the holidays with 3 different groups of people and there have been no leftovers!  If you are looking for fast and simple at a nominal cost, this one will work for you.  The taste is wonderful either hot or cold and is an elegant addition to any party or great for just an easy evening after work...pair it with a Caesar salad and dinner is on!

This recipe was a big hit at my Christmas party tonight.  It's very simple to prepare and very tasty.  I followed the recipe as is, except I dried the roasted red peppers off as suggested by other reviewers.  This recipe was so tasty even a bachelor requested the recipe, now thats a good recipe!

This was a very tasty appetizer.  However, this is also a very expensive appetizer as other reviewers have mentioned.  Personally, I am not a fan of salami or swiss cheese, so I took the creative liberty of substituting prosciutto and sharp cheddar cheese.  I also added a few slices of pre-cooked bacon for good measure.  I recommend allowing the dish to cool before cutting.  These were also good straight out of the refrigerator (if you have any leftovers!)

Two of the three family memebers do not eat eggs, so I skipped the egg mixture and the peppers (just because) and we still loved it.  We will serve at our holiday party next month.

Neat concept.  My husband liked them, but I thought they were a bit soggy.  Next time, I will use less egg and add garlic salt.

I also didn't add the pepperoni but followed the rest of the recipe as noted.  Good lunch recipe or casual company meal.  Will make again.

I loved the filling but found the crescent dough really soggy on the bottom.  The second time I used the same filling but instead of crescent dough used the panini flatbread from costco and the whole family loved it.

Made these for a potluck - they were quite good.  I served at room temperature and I wonder if they wouldn't be better hot.

AWESOME!!  This is my most favorite recipe from this site so far.  I used banana peppers instead of the red pepper and it was great.  Already passed this recipeto friends. Thanks!

This is a staple for social gatherings in my neighborhood...someone always makes it.  We all LOVE it, although we have never used the red peppers.  Will try that next time.

Made as a heavy appetizer for a cocktail party. I made some with the peppers and some without- they were a hit. Many compliments and no leftovers.

I made this as an appetizer for a dinner party before my son's prom.  It was a big hit.  My son told me I ought to make this for dinner which I was planning on doing anyway.  I did not put the roasted red peppers in since I was making it for teens, however, when I make this again I think I will add an olive mixture instead which I hope will make it like a muffaletta.

Yum Yum Yum!!!  Everyone loved these things!  I, too, used capicolla and mozzarella instead of reg ham and swiss.  It was great.  Mine didn't get too puffy and I also cooked mine a bit longer after removing the foil.  Great recipe- will definately make for my future events.

What a great appetizer that is out of the everyday.  TONS of compliments. Hearty enough appetizer that I will make for dinner instead ( reminds me of an inside out pizza ) paired with a salad.  Thanks for the great keeper.

These little stuffed breads are delish!!!  I love that they can be made ahead of time and that they are just as delicious as when they are fresh out of the oven.  The only slight changes I made was to sub shredded asiago & mozzarella for the swiss and used roasted peppers seasoned with oregano & basil.  Like others, I did have to cook for an add'l 10 minutes.  I will admit that they are a little on the salty side, but they are just SOOO GOOD!!!!  Everyone loved them!  Thanks Lori G.

I roasted my own peppers and increased baking time after uncovering to about 30 minutes.  This was a huge hit at book club, and I am looking forward to serving this to the male population; I'm sure they will love it!

Even tho swiss is my least favorite cheese, I had some so used it. Even with the swiss, this turned out very good! I didn't have the peppers, so added sliced mushrooms and sliced ripe olives instead. Thanks Lori, I'll be making this recipe again!

This was very yummy, just a bit on the greasy side. I took it to a buffet and they were all gone by the end of the evening.  My family tasted them while I was cutting them up and loved them.  I used only a 7 oz can of peppers, drained them well and patted them dry with paper towels.  Very tasty!

Made this for a party and they were a big hit.  Made one batch without peppers and the other with.  Keep the dough cold, it's easier to work with.  Will make them again!

Awesome appetizer recipe!!! I made this for my daughter's Girl Scout mother/daughter party and both kids and moms loved it!! My husband tried it before I left and was very disappointed there weren't any leftovers! Also, it was very quick and easy to prepare. I plan to make it again for a wine and cheese party I'm having next week. Yum!

Fabulous!!!!Had to email everyone at my son's b-day party the recipe!! The only change I made was that I used less than 1/4 lb of pepperoni since I feel that it is so overpowering.  I did make sure to drain the peppers really well so it wouldn't get soggy and it didn't!  Definitly a make again recipe--- thankx
