Definitely my new favorite way to have oatmeal.  I like sweet things, but upon the advice of other reviewers, I cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup and it was plenty sweet.  I also used egg beaters and cut the butter down to 2 teaspoons instead of 2 tablespoons just to make this a little healthier.  Very good, thank you for the recipe.

The creamiest oatmeal ever.  This is one of those recipes that you'll wish you had years ago - what a great idea to cook oatmeal in milk and  eggs.  Didn't give it 5 stars because it needs less sugar - maybe 1/3 cup next time - and more milk - at least 2 cups.  Used quick oats instead of rolled.  This was so good that I actually saved the leftovers (who saves leftover oatmeal???) and warmed it in the microwave with extra milk the next day.

This recipe is excellent exactly as is. My family loves it and has been known to eat it right out of the pot! It's so easy to experiment with. We like to add sliced apples and bananas occasionally and we have successfully tried it with half a teaspoon of Nutella mixed into our bowls after serving. Very good recipe overall. Thank you!

delicious. Add the milk, egg and brown sugar to a cool pan and gradually bring the heat up to keep the egg from just being a scrambled egg in your milk. Make sure you whisk the egg well and continue to stir as the heat rises. You can cut the sugar back to 1/4 or 1/3 cup. 1/2 would be way too sweet.  As written it makes two good sized bowls or 3 quite small servings. This is the best oatmeal we've ever had :)

Made this for breakfast today and it was GREAT!! I am a huge fan of oatmeal and this is now the recipe I will use.  I used only 1/4 cup of brown sugar and it was "just right".  I added raisins during the cooking in order to soften them, rather than adding them after cooking. To cut calories, use brown sugar Splenda and egg substitute and low fat milk.  This is a very versatile recipe, so on future oatmeal mornings, I'm going to try adding 1/4 cup chopped apples and a 2 Tbsps of pecans and a tsp of cinnamon, or put sliced bananas on the oatmeal after cooking.  Try this recipe and you will NEVER eat instant oatmeal again (ugh). Make this the night before, put it in the fridge and heat it up in the microwave the the morning. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I followed the advice of some reviewers and cut the amount of sugar in half, and still found it way too sweet.  I've made the following modifications and LOVE IT!  I've always choked down my oatmeal, now I look forward to this every morning.  I use Vanilla Almond Breeze instead of milk.  So I use 1 cup Vanilla Almond Breeze, 3/4 cup water, only 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 cup of oats, and no butter.  It comes out very creamy, plenty sweet.  This amount for us makes two servings, 250 calories each serving.

Wow, this is sweet. I made the recipe as is and while the flavor was delicious, and the texture was perfect, it was just waaay too much sugar for breakfast. I should have followed the reviewers advice, but I like to make recipes as originally written the first time. Next time I will use half the amount of sugar.

I just made this for breakfast on our first snowy sunday morning with some fresh squeezed orange juice, fresh fruit, whole grain toast and it was absolutely wonderful.  I did reduce the sugar to just under 1/4 c., used skim milk and added walnuts after it was cooked.  Husband wanted fat laden breakfast so didn't want me to make this and believe it or not, he raved.  It was wonderful, fast and really easy and I highly recommend it. I will make this often and even for company.  I hope you enjoy it as much as we did and... LET IT SNOW!!

I would give this more stars if I could. I made this for a company breakfast and I have one word for it. AWESOME! I wouldn't say it has anything to do with butterscotch at all though.  I quadrupled the recipe because I had about 12 people to feed. I also took 3 apples, peeled and sliced, and sauteed them up in butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon. After they were done, I stirred them into the oatmeal. Fantastic! It was by far the creamist oatmeal I have ever eaten.

Ok, I don't eat oatmeal.  I can't stand the texture.  I'm sure I'm missing something wonderful, but...eh...I'll get over it.  However, I made this for my hubby and my mom who are both oatmeal eaters.  I used 1/4 c. Eggbeaters in place of the egg, skim milk, cut the brown sugar back to 1/3 c., and the butter (which was made with yogurt) to about 2 tsp.  They LOVED it!!!  Their reaction almost made me want to try it...almost.  Maybe next time.  They have requested that I add cinnamon and raisins the next time I make it (although they were happy with it just the way it was), so there are ways you can liven it up.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Amazing oatmeal!  The egg (I actually used egg sub.) gives it that richness that was always missing in the past when I made homemade oatmeal!  In addition to the use of egg sub., I also skipped the butter at the end;  didn't miss it at all and saved on calories.  Also, I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to this during simmering and about 3/4 C raisins during the last few minutes or so, so that they can soften and get nice and plump!  Awesome oats!

This is the best oatmeal I have ever made.  Used the quick cooking oats, skim milk and egg substitute and it was delicious.  My husband and two children ask for it often.

Delicious!  I used 1/4 c brown sugar, since I don't like things too sweet, and added a pinch of salt.  I will make this again!

My oatmeal hating son loved this.  Very creamy.  I did what others suggested and used only 1/4 c brown sugar.  It was plenty sweet and could even use less.  Did everythingelse as written.  I like to get a protein into the kids at breakfast.  Never would have thought to add an egg to oatmeal.  Great!

I followed the recipe to a T, and was very disappointed in the outcome. To me it tasted more like pure sugar than butterscotch. I'd have been better off stirring in butterscotch chips to achieve that flavor, which I'll try next time I have a hankering.

I don't usually care for the texture of oatmeal, but this I liked.  A little too sweet for a regular breakfast; next time I'll try cutting the sugar in half, and maybe add a pinch of salt.

I really, really REALLY want to like oatmeal.  It's inexpensive, filling and good for me, but I can't do it.  I've tried it with all sorts of "disguises": cinnamon, sugar, butter, peanut butter (not at the same time of course), but I still literally choke it down and try again in a year or two.  I was intrigued by all of the positive reviews of this and I have to say, this is probably the best oatmeal I've ever had.  The consistency did make it a little easier to eat, and the taste wasn't bad.  I still don't *like* it, but I could manage to eat this without gagging every once in awhile (and that's saying a lot!).  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  P.S. My husband feels the same way about oatmeal that I do, and he actually said he could eat this a few times a month!

Really great recipe. I cut the sugar down to 3 tablespoons, and used just 2 teaspoons of butter, but I usually don't put too much sweetener in my oatmeal, so this was very much sweet enough for me. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and a tsp vanilla, but 1/2 tsp vanilla is probably plenty. Thanks for the recipe! It makes a lot, so I have two more portions in my fridge that I'll reheat for my next two breakfasts!

would give this 4 1/2 stars if possible.  I loved it!  I am an oatmeal fan, and this was creamy and comforting. I only used about 1/4 cup brown sugar, and used 1/2 c heavy cream and the rest 2% milk.  I also added a dash of nutmeg, a dash of vanilla, and about 3 dashes of cinnamon. My hubby thought it still a little sweet for him, and requested raisins next time.  Am gonna make this again, and experiment with adding fruit and nuts.  Overall, great recipe!

I make this three of four mornings a week now. I like my oatmeal sweeter though and cooking it this way breaks down the oatmeal a lot more then other ways. Great with strawberries and bananas.

This recipe is so good I have added it to my Restaurant Menu and it's a big hit. My entire family loves when I make it at home. I do agree with everyone else. Only use 1/2 a cup of brown sugar, any more and you will need a crowbar to get your kids off the ceiling.

This is the yummiest, creamiest oatmeal I've ever had. I made this for a church breakfast and reduced to about 1/3 amount of sugar so people could sweeten to taste. I also browned some crushed pecans in butter and sprinkled them on top, and called it "Butter Pecan" because butterscotch oatmeal doesn't sound healthy to me.   It was plenty sweet and everyone loved it as-is, even going back for seconds!  I am using the same base today for the church breakfast and will add dried cranberries and walnuts.

Delicious! I made this on a camp out-- just put all the ingredients in a pot and let it heat up. Everybody loved it. 

For a healthier version, use applesauce instead of butter and cut the sugar by half. I usually increase the milk to 2 cups because I like my oatmeal creamy. 

To make a great dessert, use 4 tablespoons of butter.

More like pudding than oatmeal... not bad if you are expecting that to be the case.

I give it 5 stars based on original recipe which is incredibly rich and sweet, more like a dessert (reminds me of a rice pudding).  But based on my chances it is about 4 stars.  I made it dairy-free second time around for health reasons, using almond milk and Earth Balance spread in place of butter.  I should have actually cooked the spread in rather than stirring in at the end because the oils can be tasted.  I also cut back on the sugar second time around, and I used a mixture of half raw, organic can sugar and half xylitol, which I made into brown sugar by adding a little molasses.  I also added a pinch of salt.  I think some maple flavoring would be really yummy.  I love the addition of the egg...I think that's what makes it like a dessert!

Reduced sugar to 1/4 cup, which was perfect. Oddly, we kind of didn't like the consistency with the egg in the oatmeal. The butter should also be reduced by half.

Delicious! I just finished eating a bowl of it. I did cut the sugar in 1/2 and used a 1/4 of a cup. I also used skim milk (that's what we have) and didn't add the butter. It was plenty sweet. Thanks

Always looking for ways to eat more oatmeal and this was great!  We used 1/3 cup of the brown sugar and it was on the verge of sickening sweet though.  Next time I'll use 1/4.  But the flavor was awesome.  The kids ate it right up!  I might try Almond Milk one of these days too. Thanks for sharing!

I just made this and I enjoyed the flavor.I am not a big fan of oatmeal and I would eat it. I did use less sugar and butter (it was plenty craemy without butter.) I also adding a touch of cinnamon with the milk and a small splas of vanilla with the butter. Top with some fruit and the kids enjoyed it and I rarely get them to eat more then a bite or two when I make them oatmeal. I never make oatmeal so thanks for the idea and I am so glad I tried it!

I was lookingg for something for dinner that was easy and quick.  We often eat oatmeal for dinner - especially after a large lunch.  This hit the spot.  I followed the directions closely using 1/4 C Splenda Brown Sugar and just used about 1 tsp. butter substitute because of our diet.  I added in raisins and some other dried fruit at the beginning so it would soften during cooking.  For me it was a bit sweeter than I like but for my hubby it was perfect.  I think the sweetness of the dried fruit made it too sweet for me but the consisitency was right on.  Will never make regular oatmeal again!  Thanks Kiana5 for posting this one.

this was good. I halved the brown sugar and the butter. Next time I may add some pecans. I wisked the eggs, then added the brown sugar and wisked some more before adding the milk. The eggs were fully incorporated and I didn't have any problems.

Without a doubt the best oatmeal you will ever eat.  It's super easy and you cna adjust the sugar down if you want it less sweet.  My kids who say they hate oatmeal will eat this right out of the pot.  Plus it sticks to our ribs so you don't feel like you need a snack at 10AM.  Enjoy!

I've never made homemade oatmeal before today, so I used this recipe as a base.  I altered the recipe a bit (used 1 c. milk and 1 c. water because I ran out of milk, halved the sugar and added 2T high-quality Medium Grade A maple syrup).  Because I followed another reviewers suggestion to up the milk, it is too runny for me - I like my oatmeal thick enough to hold its shape.  Next time I think I'll cut the milk back to 1.5C.  I must say though, that using half water half milk doesn't seem to have affected the flavour at all (for those of you trying to cut calories).

Yummy! This is so good. I was worried about the milk to oatmeal ratio, but this is really good. I did add cinnamon, cloves, and ginger to the end result. Yum! *UPDATE* I made this for breakfast this morning.  I added a small, diced apple a handful of craisins, cinnamon, a dash of cardamon and vanilla right before i served it. OMGosh, it was so amazing!

I just made this for breakfast. I love oatmeal and was just looking for a new way to make it. The taste is pretty good but the texture is just plain weird. It's still edible but I don't think I'll make oatmeal with eggs again. Next time I'll just leave the egg out as the flavor is pretty good.

I really liked this although I did make changes by using low-fat dairy and (half the sugar). I thought it had a nice custard/pudding type creaminess but it had enough oatmeal to still be like breakfast. I read some of the reviews that stated it was way too sweet and that they wished they would have cut the sugar back. Based on other reviews and with the amount of sugar I agreed. 1/4 cups, which I used, was still plenty sweet for 3 servings of oatmeal. I used lite butter, to cut the saturated fat in half of regular butter, and 2% milk. I used old-fashioned oats and it thickened up nicely. TY

Delicious! I used less than half the brown sugar and added raisins with a sprinkle of cinnamon and a dash of salt. This tastes like my grandmother's rice pudding & I love that it has a bit of protein in it to make it a power breakfast!

My husband and I did not like this oatmeal at all - I'll not make it again.  It was way too sweet, and more than that, we did not like the creamed texture - it didn't even resemble oatmeal, and I used old-fashioned rolled oats, not the quick cooking kind.  It was like mushy baby food in texture.  No butterscotch flavor, just heavy brown sugar taste.  IF I was to make it again (which I won't) I'd cut the brown sugar in half.   By the reviews, I expected it to be great, but it didn't appeal to us at all - I guess each to their own preferences!

This definitely IS yummy oatmeal! Very creamy with wonderful flavor - almost like dessert!  My reason for FOUR STARS: I did do some tweaking based on other reviews and I will only give five stars to a recipe that is excellent exactly as published on the site. When doubling the recipe, I reduced the brown sugar to 2/3 c. and will reduce it further next time as it was too sweet for my family. We enjoyed it enough to try it again tomorrow using just 1/2 c. I'll let you know how that turns out.  I also added 1/2 t. cinnamon and 1/2 t. high quality vanilla.  NOTE: I used quick-cooking oatmeal and the amount of liquid was perfect. I usually associate the term "rolled oats" with old-fashioned oatmeal that requires more  liquid and more cooking time. I don't know if that is what the submitter intended. If so, I would think you would need more milk.

This type of oatmeal is definitely my favorite! Never have I had such a creamy, flavorful taste in my oatmeal.  However, there were a few changes I made: first, I reduced the amount of brown sugar to 1/4 a cup and it was PLENTY.   Also, only 1-2 TEASPOONS of butter is necessary.  Third, just for some flavor, I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  It turned out amazing and I will most definitely make this again and again! Thank you for this recipe!!

I love this oatmeal. I just made it exactly as it's written and am sitting here eating a bowl right now. I can hardly wait for my wife and kids to get out of bed so I can serve it to them. This is a definite keeper! BTW, I made it with quick-cooking oats and it is perfect.

My daughter, son, and I really enjoyed this oatmeal.  Considering that they don't really like oatmeal that is saying a lot!  I added a tsp. of vanilla extract and cinnamon as well.  Blueberries are a nice addition as well.  It's very satisfying and tasty.  I can't wait to add it to my autumn routine.

Yippe! This will be the way I make my oatmeal from know on...loved the creaminess. My brown sugar was as hard as a rock so I used granulated instead, did cut to 1/4C, and it was just the right sweetness for me (and I like sweet oatmeal). Did add vanilla extract and raisins ...yumm. Will be getting brown sugar next trip out so looking forward to trying again

This was the BEST oatmeal I have ever tasted. I need to make oatmeal alot throughout the week due to my breastfeeding it helps with my supply. I needed a new way to make it, so I tried this. DELICIOUS! I will never make oatmeal any other way again! My hubby loved it too. Thanks so much!

Five stars doesn't even begin to properly rate this delicious recipe! Until recently I had never tried oatmeal. It just didn't look appealing to me. With rising food prices we needed a breakfast for one day a week that wasn't overly expensive, and oatmeal fit the bill perfectly. I've tried fixing it several ways (apples, raisins, peanut butter) and it never appealed to our tastes. I was about to give up when I found this recipe.   This stuff is GREAT! It didn't end up looking like the picture but that didn't change the taste any! None of the oats came out mushy and the butterscotch taste was VERY evident. I wouldn't change anything. Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! Thank you for this great contribution. :)

This was mediocre at best.  I believe many of the (overrated) reviews were because they are accustomed to instant/microwaveable oatmeal versus the old-fashioned rolled oats cooked on the stove.  I, however, regularly make stove-top oatmeal and I was not very impressed with this recipe.  I used a scant 1/3 cup dark brown sugar and 2 cups whole milk... I felt the oatmeal wasn't very sweet at all.  Cut back the butter to only one tablespoon.  I'm not disappointed I tried the recipe because it was edible - it just wasn't spectacular or worth making again.  One last note- it does NOT taste like butterscotch!

Thanks for the recipe post, but it's a bit too sweet and well, slimy.  I love oatmeal, and the flavor combo itself is good, but...
UPDATE:  
I reduced the sugar to about 2 TBS or so, added a dash of maple and vanilla extracts, and stirred in just a bit of butter.  I also like my oatmeal thicker so I reduce the liquid and cook a for a bit less time to leave some bite to it.  Much more suited to my tastes this way.

I’ve eaten oatmeal all my life.  Usually with raisins and a good amount of sugar.  I’ve recently started adding other things like chopped walnuts, dates and brown sugar.  Saw this and decided to give it a try.  It is delicious and not at all hard to make.  Much better than anything off the shelf.  Oh, I still added the raisins.

I never would have thought I'd be writing a five star review for an oatmeal recipe.  I mean, it's oatmeal.  But this isn't your run of the mill oatmeal.  This stuff is seriously delicious.  The first time I made this I used instant oats, and it was great, if a bit sweet.  The next time I made it I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and it was perfect for me.  This last time I decided to use Scottish oatmeal, and it was amazing.  The Scottish oats have a much deeper, nuttier flavor than the kind you get in a canister, and it really elevated this simple recipe to one that is just outstanding.  The only downside is that they need about 30 minutes to cook, and require you to double the liquid.  If you have the time to stand at the stove and stir the oatmeal constantly, use Scottish oats, but of you don't, use standard oatmeal.  You won't be disappointed.  If you're looking for a way to add oatmeal to your diet and don't want to sacrifice flavor, use skim milk and omit the butter.  This is the best way to have oatmeal, in my opinion

I couldn't figure out what to make for breakfast so I rolled the dice and tried this recipe.  I'm glad I did.  I didn't read the other reviews (I was that hungry), so I missed the suggestions to cut the sugar.  It definitely could stand to be cut, but to me, it was fine as is.  But I also like sweet oatmeal.  So yeah.  That.  I also keep very little milk in my house, so I only had about 3/4 cup on hand.  I used vanilla almond milk for the rest and it turned out just fine.  I'll probably use all almond milk next time.  There will definitely be a next time.

Excellent.  I made this as stated but had to use 2 different types of oatmeal because I ran out.  That made the texture a little odd but it's not the recipe's fault.  I kept the sugar at 1/2 c. because my kids are used to the sweet sugary packets of oatmeal.  This was way better and everyone loved it.  My husband would have liked it less sweet but that is an easy fix.  I have never made homemade oatmeal but I will now!

Wonderfully creamy, but sweet is the only flavor going for this recipe (even after decreasing the sugar by half). Decrease the sugar to 1 T. and this is a 4-star recipe; add some cinnamon and top with nuts to make it a 5.

Delicious oatmeal. I cut down the sugar to 1/4 cup and added cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. I also threw in a handful of dried cherries at the beginning, so they cooked up soft. It didn't even need the butter.

It was great. Added some raisins toward the end. So yummy. Didn't need the butter at all. I've made it multiple times now and it even saves well in the fridge. Oatmeal so good that you save the leftovers. Haha

I have made the recipe as is, with an additional sprinkling of pecan pieces to top. I am normally not an oatmeal person, but this is utterly perfect. So creamy and good, with a perfect sweetness level (have no idea why so many people think its too sweet) ive been making it weekly since Ive discovered this recipe. Easy to memorize too! I wouldn't change a thing! Wish the writer's directions were a tad more specific, timing wise.

Very very creamy. Too creamy for me. I used canned milk, and quick cook 1 minute oats and I let this boil for a minute so the oats were cooked, but even then the oats seemed to need more cooking and tasted raw to me. The flavor is fine mostly except for the raw oat taste, but the texture is weird. Very creamy like pudding and then there are these oat pieces. I just couldn't finish my serving but it was a texture thing not a flavor thing. My husband ate his and his only comment was, "It's too sweet." I didn't taste any butterscotch flavor.

Cut down the butter and sugar by half - this was SO delicious!
Update: I've made this weekly now for many months.  It is awesome.  I also use a mix of water and milk in addition to cutting the butter and sugar by half.  For my family it's perfect this way!

OMG! So good!  Way to sweet - and I reduced brown sugar to 1/3 cup. Will reduce it to 1/4 cup next time. Yummy!

Made exactly as listed and was not happy with it.  It did not have the taste of butterscotch and the oatmeal had a slimy consistency.  My kids and my wife would not eat it.  Just not right for us.

I liked it, but I didn't LOVE it, which I really wanted to. Taste and texture-wise, it wasn't that far off from the way I normally prepare stovetop oatmeal (boiled in milk or vanilla soy milk with brown sugar stirred in at the end of cooking). I was hoping to get a different outcome with the addition of the egg, but the only benefit was some added protein, which provides a hearty, filling breakfast for my 4 year-old DD (who devoured this, by the way). The only differences I made were to add a pinch of salt, 1 tsp of vanilla, reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 c, and I added a 1/2 c more oatmeal, as we prefer a thicker consistency. The proportions were then spot-on for our liking.

This is called Butterscotch Oatmeal - expect it to be sweet! I made it exactly as written, and it was very good and very creamy. The portion sizes are about right for how sweet it is. I have also made this with half the sugar and added a little cinnamon and maple flavoring, and that is good as well. I've made it without the egg, and it's good, but just not quite as creamy and filling. As written, it has a very mild butterscotch taste, but don't expect a butterscotch chip type taste.

Holy cow!  This is amazing!  I didn't know I could get so excited about an oatmeal recipe.  Absolutely delicious!  I made a double batch so I would have some left over for tomorrow.  I kept the brown sugar to 1/2 cup for the double batch and it was perfect.  Added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla and some cinnamon too, just because I love those flavors.  Thanks for giving such a terrific, custardy oatmeal recipe!

Good recipe. Something about adding the egg makes this recipe different, and creates a smooth creamy oatmeal. Love it!

It's way too sweet as written. Second time I made it I used 2 cups of milk, 2T brown sugar, a few drops of vanilla and added 1T butter and a dash of salt at the end.

Also someone said they don't know what this has to do with butterscotch...the ingredients are the same ingredients (sans oatmeal) used to make butterscotch pudding. Believe it or not butterscotch pudding doesn't have to come from a box.

I loved how creamy and rich this oatmeal tasted but I found it way to sweet ( even though I cut the sugar to 1/3).  My husband and son thought it was perfect.  I will be making this again very soon with 1/4 cup sugar.

I liked this- my kids didn't. It was really thick and had a good flavor but I guess they prefer cinnamon, milk and sugar. It was kinda rich too.

Made as directed. Perfect! I'll never make my oatmeal any other way. I highly recommend people try the recipe as directed before decreasing the amount of sugar. The recipe is for 3 servings not one so don't be frightened by the seemingly large amount of sugar. Also, it's called Butterscotch Oatmeal for a reason. It's supposed to be sweet and creamy oatmeal. To the author of the recipe: great idea about adding the egg. It really makes a difference.

I thought it was ok, but my daughter LOVED it.  It was too thick for my taste, so I added a little more milk to thin it out a little.  I gave this recipe 4 stars because it had a nice flavor.  Followed others' suggestions and used just 1/4 cup brown sugar.

Yum Yum! So smooth and creamy! Will be doing this oatmeal often. But I do agree with other reviewers, go easy on the brown sugar. I used 1/3 C plus a tad because DH usually dumps on the br. sugar like crazy. He ate this with joy and didn't add a morsel of br. sugar.

I like to drink my oatmeal, I did use 2 cups milk and could use more.  I also used 2.5 TBS of splenda brown sugar and could have gotten away with 2TBS . . .  now that I think of it, I forgot to add the butter . . . . and didn't even notice! it was GREAT!

This oatmeal is so creamy-delicious! I found that the egg will cook wrong if you don't keep it stirring really consistently. The recipe says to boil, but when mine boils the egg makes little chunks despite stirring, you have to stir on a lower heat for longer to get the creamy consistency. I don't know what happened or I did wrong those two times but it just came out bad! Keep the heat just below medium and STIR is all I found.

Excellent! Creamy yumminess for a winter's morn. Only changes I made - reduced sugar to 1/3 cup, added a pinch of salt (to balance the sweetness) and 1/2 t vanilla. Perfect!!

Like another reviewer said, I used to choke down oatmeal.  It was the sort of thing I kept at my desk at work when I ran late, and scraped out of a styrofoam cup while dreaming of something appetizing.  This is good stuff.  This is the kind of thing I'll be making in double batches to take to work and eat happily.

love this for a healthy and easy breakfast!  i took others suggestions and only used 1/4 c brown sugar and 2 t butter instead of 2 T.  Next time, I'll leave out the butter completely and maybe add nutmeg and/or cinnamon.

Very delicious, but I made several changes. I used Almond Milk and extra oats.  Also, this is VERY sweet, so you don't have to use the entire amount of sugar.  The butter isn't necessary either.  It will still taste wonderful :)

My family really enjoyed this.  Never knew about adding an egg, my husband said he always made oatmeal that way.  The egg really is a nice addition, it adds nicely to the texture and gives a boost of protein making this an even better morning meal. Will make again!

The BEST oatmeal I have ever had, hands down.  I like my oatmeal sweet and I thought this was divine.  I add a little milk just to thin it out a bit because it is quite thick when it is done cooking.  This recipe even stores well in the fridge, but I haven't stored it past two days so I don't know how long it can last.  Delicious!

This was way too sweet for me.  I am a huge fan of oatmeal but did not care too much for this recipe.  I also did not like that there were bits of egg in the finished product and I had stirred mine the whole time it was cooking to try and avoid that.

I love this recipe, and so does my 3 year old son. He said he loved it, and he hates oatmeal! Based on other reviews I used quick cooking oats, and 1/3 cup of brown sugar, and it had just the right amount of sweetness. Very good! Thanks for a warm perfect winter morning breakfast!

I used water instead of milk.  This was easy and quick.  It tasted wonderful and got great reviews from my 8 and 6 year old.  Will be making this instead of buying those packs of brown sugar instant oatmeal.  Thanks

I have made this twice in the last two days. It is very tasty however, like many other reviewers you need to reduce the sugar.  The first time I made it I used 1/4 cup brown sugar,skim milk and quick oats and although good it was a little sweet for our taste. Today, I made it again and reduced the sugar to 1/8 of a cup and although still sweet much better. My husband loves oatmeal in the morning (mostly pre-packaged) however, now we will make a double batch of this recipe and just re-heat in the morning. Much healthier, no chemicals and a great way to start the day! Thanks for sharing!

YUM!! This was so good - rich and creamy and totally satisfying. However, you must cut the brown sugar and butter in half, otherwise it will be sickly sweet and greasy.

Good....but not for breakfast. WAY too sweet.  It is more of a pudding.  I thought that the egg left a slight, but noticeable, "eggy" taste that I did not like.

WONDERFUL!  I followed the recipe, but used slightly less milk (maybe 1 1/2 cup) because I like my oatmeal a bit thick.  It was very creamy and just as sweet as I like!  I never thought of adding the sugar while cooking and it was just the ticket-adding it after my oatmeal is done always thins it out (and as I said, I like it thick).  I have made this over and over since finding this recipe-THANK YOU!

This is so easy to put together, even on a busy morning. The taste is better than the oatmeal in packets that are so overpriced. I did cut the sugar by about half but followed the other directions. I will be making this often over the coming cold weather months. Thanks for the recipe.

This was incredible and quick. I love oatmeal and I don't mean the instant kind. I love to experiment with different flavors and this was simply delicious. I did use skim milk and half the sugar & butter it calls for. Then I added a little cinnamon and vanilla with the butter. My kids and hubby all wanted seconds.

I've made this several times now. My family loves it. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. It was more like a dessert (pudding) than a breakfast, so I've started reducing the butter and brown sugar until the kids protested. I've found that decreasing the butter by half and using 1/4 less of brown sugar keeps us all happy.

Mixed reviews on whether we liked this. This tasted like an oatmeal "rice pudding", with the oats in a kind of custard. DEFINITELY use old fashioned or thick rolled oats to avoid a homogenous goop and maintain some texture. We also halved the sugar and it was more than plenty. I probably will not make again.

I too used 1/4 cup sugar.  Husband thought it was OK, but a little too gummy.  14-month-old seemed to like it.  3-year-old was not deceived into thinking it was instant oatmeal.  I thought it had pretty good flavor but not very visually appealing.  Probably won't make it again, especially since it's so high in calories.

Yummy! I beat the eggs/milk/sugar with an egg beater.  Used 3/4 cup quick oats to make it creamier (boil & stir 1 minute).  Added 1/4 tsp salt.  Liked it better without the butter, although I tried some with a little butter and that with the brown sugar really gives it the "butterscotchy" flavor.  Maybe less sugar next time as very sweet (1/3 cup?).  Yum!  Will definitely make again - you get your oatmeal and an egg, too!

Oh, this is so tasty! I never thought of using an egg in oatmeal, and I'm very glad I tried this recipe! It's really fairly sweet but it's true that you don't need to add anything else once it's cooked. I added just a little milk to my daughter's serving to cool it off faster, and she ate almost the whole bowl! This, after she had some cold cereal! :) Thanks Kiana!! *** 12/07/05 - I made this again using only about 1/3 cup brown sugar, and it turned out great. I prefered it less sweet, but it's still butterscotchy. And I've used both Country Crock and butter mixed in, and I think I prefer using the Country Crock!

It’s very good and so easy, but you need less sugar and a little more milk. It’s kind of sticky and sweet if you go by the recipe.

this was wonderful but I know it's high in calories.  It made 3 servings though so I don't feel quite as guilty.  The egg made it so creamy.  Didn't even need salt

Great recipe but I was suspicious of how much sugar it called for. I read the reviews, then cut the sugar in half and added a pinch of salt. It was wonderful and slightly healthier, but still very sweet. We will enjoy this again sometime soon.

The best oatmeal I’ve ever had. I followed the suggestions in the reviews to cut down on the brown sugar. I used 1/4 cup and could have used less. The butter and brown sugar give this a yummy butterscotch flavor - not too strong, just right. One note - cooking time depends on the kind of oatmeal you use. The recipe doesn’t specify and says to cook for 10 minutes. I used traditional steel cut oats. It takes longer than10 minutes to cook them. Next time I’ll add more milk so the oatmeal can cook longer without getting too thick.

This oatmeal was delicious and I will definitely be making it again! lLike many other reviewers I cut down the brown sugar to 1/4 c and it was definitely sweet enough; I do have to say I didn't think that it at all had the flavor of butterscotch. But it was still quite good.

The sugar was too much. I used 2 tablespoons sugar and a touch of agave nectar, reduced the butter to 1 tablespoon and used a mixture of unsweetened almond milk, water and evaporated milk. Also added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.

Like all home Cooks yeah I changed it.  In a 2 quart non-stick pan placing butter, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 tablespoons real maple syrup, then let it bloom on medium heat bubbling it's hot be careful. After 1 minute add 2 cups of rolled oats completely  coating and toast the oats for 1 minute. Optional (Whisk together one egg ), 1 cup milk and 1 1/2 cup water.  Cook 10 min. Cover let sit 1 min. Serve with or without milk (tip ) top with mixture of melted butter, brown sugar real maple syrup. WOW lot of work but it's worth it.

I made this as written,  as I feel you should the first time.  Really enjoyed it,.  As the recipe didn't specify,  I used regular oats.   Next time I will use quick oats.  I added raisins and a tad of cinnamon after I had eaten some of the original.   Also,  I think this would feed 2 adults,  not 3 servings,  as recipe states.  Kudos for giving me another way to enjoy oats!

This was amazing!  As per other suggestions I did cut sugar back to 1/3 cup and it was the perfect amount of sweetness . I also added a pinch of salt to milk mixture and 1/4 tsp vanilla with the butter ... more  caramel flavour than butterscotch but still delicious

I''ve been making this for more than 30 years.  I reduce the amount of brown sugar to 1/4 cup and find both regular and quick oats work  well.   
Chilled apple juice is very good served with this hearty breakfast bowl.

I have loved this recipe as is for years (minus the butter and half as much sugar) but have recently had to make diet changes. So pleased to find it just as quick, satisfying and tasty with unsweetened coconut milk and 1/4 cup maple syrup in place of the brown sugar. A wonderful way to prepare oatmeal!

It’s cold here in upstate NY so I made this the other day for breakfast.  I have to admit I was skeptical!  Egg in oatmeal?  But it is delicious!  I did use only 1/4 cup of brown sugar and like others said, it’s PLENTY sweet.  The amazing thing is that my non-oatmeal loving husband asked me to make it again today!  That’s a first, and a huge plus for this recipe!  Thank you for sharing this sure to be often made recipe!

I made one small change, cutting the brown sugar down to about 1/3 cup. The oatmeal was plenty sweet that way.

Love the thickness, but I did however reduce the brown sugar to half, added half a teaspoon of salt and garnished it with some butterscotch morsel.

I have made this many times. My husband loves oatmeal. I find it too sweet. So, I reduce the sugar by half and add blueberries and sliced bananas for natural sweetness. I also sprinkle with cinnamon. So yummy and I am not a fan of oatmeal!

Made this recipe as written.  It was good.  It was a little too sweet so I would down on the sugar.  Texture was nice and creamy.

used 1% cream, rolled oats and must add salt to it. the 1/4cup brown sugar is too sweet for me so have to cut back next time. creamy, easy!  for adulting, added raisins soaked in 1tbsp of dark rum making it fancy.

So to start, if you have ever eaten a dessert and said that it's too sweet, you're not my people. Cut the sugar. We love our food sweet, so this feels like the perfect amount of sugar. This has a bit of a pudding or custard texture, which I'll admit weirded me out at first, but this is delicious and I grew to love the texture quickly. If you multiply the recipe, it does take a long time to cook, just like anything with milk and eggs. It reheated well with a little extra milk. One of my two favorite things about this recipe is how filling it is. I've multiplied by 6 and a pot lasts me and the kids for a week because we get full after one bowl. It's the only sweet breakfast that keeps me full until lunchtime, and even longer. So even though it has a lot of sugar, I don't feel awful because we eat so little at a sitting. It also is a very good base recipe. I get bored with food quickly, so today I added vanilla and cinnamon to mix things up. Next week I might add some fruit.

I really liked this recipe, it had a pudding like consistency.  The rest of the family did not like it.   I made it exactly as written.  It was a little sweet , if I made it again I would cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 to 1/3 cup like other reviewers suggested.

Very tasty! Thanks for the recipe. I took others' suggestion and put 1/4 c sugar. I used large flake oats so I just had to increase liquid and cooking time. I used 2 cups milk and about a cup or more of water. Then added cold milk to each bowl so it could cool quickly.

I never added an egg to oatmeal before! I found it a bit sweet, even after I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup. I was hoping for a bit more butterscotch-y flavor. But, it did get my non-oatmeal eating partner-in-dine to eat oatmeal. Going to play with it a bit and see if we can get the flavor we are looking for.

It was delicious, but based on suggestions, I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and it was still really sweet. I also added some cinnamon after it was finished, to give it a kick. Still, really good recipe!

This was so delicious!   I did follow the reviews and cut the sugar to 1/4 c and it was just perfect.  I have never liked oatmeal, not the texture, not the taste but I just loved this recipe and so did my husband.   Will definitely make this often.

Needless to say, since I rated it 5 stars, I loved it!! I’ve made it a few times now, exactly as the recipe is written, and also with less brown sugar and no butter. I actually prefer it with a little less brown sugar. Leftovers keep well in the fridge and heat up well in the microwave.

I wanted to try this oatmeal because the egg and butter sounded good. It was good and very creamy. I only used 1 T butter which I thought was plenty. I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk, which worked great in this. I knew 1/2 c brown sugar would be too much, so I cut it down to 1/4, and it was still a bit sweet for me; I think only a couple tablespoons was needed. This would make 3 small servings, but I opted instead for it to be 2 hefty servings, which was another reason to cut down on sugar and butter.

Delicious, added a little salt. Kids loved it as is-

For me, maybe try 1/2 the sugar and 1/2 the butter next time?

I have never been a big oatmeal fan so I haven't made anything but  instant in years. However, I had some oatmeal left from making cookie which I love and decided to give this recipe a try. It is sweet and the sugar could be cut down but I made it as directed and it was very good and creamy. I may not use this recipe often but I definitely will make it on some of those cold winter days and maybe add some fruit to it.  I'm going to pass this one on to may son who makes oatmeal for his children often..

My kids favorite way to eat oatmeal! My husband will occasionally have a bowl and he HATES breakfast foods. I do cut down on the sugar. Just a little more than half and it's plenty sweet. A little vanilla extract for depth. This oatmeal is amazing!

I liked the sweetness but will probably cut the brown sugar back in the future just to make it healthier. I added a little cinnamon and vanilla. Next time I'm planning to add fruit, maybe peaches or blueberries.

It was fairly good, especially because I don't like like Oatmeal. I added a little less than a fourth of a cup of brown sugar, added a few spoonfuls of peanut butter, and cut down on the butter. I topped it with bananas and it was pretty  good.

My mother made this for me when I was growing up and I   have made it for my oldest son! It is comfort food for us both. Love it and wouldn't change the recipe at all since it is a part of my childhood and is delicious for me just the way it is.

Excellent!  50% less sugar was a great tip by many reviewers.  Next time i will use coconut milk and add some dried fruit.  We love oatmeal and this was tasty

It’s too sweet for my husband as-is. So I only use 1/3 cup brown sugar and up the milk to 2 cups. I also sprinkle in nutmeg.

WOW! This is the  first oatmeal I've ever enjoyed.  I did as the other reviewers said and omitted the butter (saved calories).  I added some cinnamon, too.  I make this 2 or 3 times a week.

Nice warm way to start the day.  I  used only 1/4cup of brown sugar and egg beaters.  For my personal taste I added a pinch of salt and it made a whole difference in taste.  That was the missing touch for perfection, a bit of salt.  Great and easy recipe.

I was craving something  sweet and ran across this recipe. This dish made a fabulous midnight snack! I put in just a little less brown sugar than what the recipe called for and boy was it delicious. I will be making this again.  Who would have thought that adding an egg would make oatmeal so creamy? Bravo!

This is a great recipe, from an oatmeal-hating person.  Feels like the egg adds some extra nutrients, and the butter - well, BUTTER.  Enough for two servings, easy to reheat. Thanks!

This is one of my favorite breakfast recipes! I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup, add a tsp of sea salt and a tsp of vanilla. It's amazing! I love this on a cold morning when you're wanting some warm comfort food! Yum!!!

This is quite good! I gave it 4 stars because I changed it up a little. I used 2 cups Silk vanilla soy milk instead of regular, and used 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of a half cup. Will make again!

Like someone else said in their review, I've also tried many, many times to like oatmeal. This oatmeal is the best ever. I'm actually looking forward to making it for the second time tomorrow morning. That's twice in one week which is double what I've eaten in previous entire years. Tomorrow I will top it with some fresh cherries and pecans. This is the best oatmeal I've ever tasted and gets extra stars for incorporating protein!!

Such a simple recipe yields an amazing breakfast! All I had on hand was quick oats so that's what I used and it still was delicious. Everything else was just as the recipe called. The sugar could be less, but my six year old told me "this is impressive, mom! I want this for breakfast again tomorrow!" Hah

I followed another popular review and reduced brown sugar to 1/4 c.  It was plenty sweet, so that worked well.  I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon just before it was finished and a splash of vanilla.  Reduced butter to 1 T. as well.  So good.  Kids are already asking for it again.  I don't like oatmeal from the packets, but loved this.  Kids said it was the best they had ever had.

This was very good.  As many reviewers did, I cut the sugar to one tablespoon and used Almond milk.  It was a great base for any healthy add ins.  Will definitely be making again.  I didn't feel the need to add butter.

This oatmeal is very creamy and nicely sweetened with just 1/4 cup of the sugar. Definitely follow the advice on  this one because the sugar was not overly sweet. My kids loved it, which says a lot because they usually do not like oatmeal. This is definitely a keeper for me and my family.

I made it as the recipe as stated because I do like sweet oatmeal. It was sticky not creamy for me. Maybe I needed more milk or butter. But the texture was off and the flavor didn't make up for it. Would not make this again.

I think the texture of the oatmeal was spot on. Nothing else has come close to this. I do think it was too sweet, even when cutting the sugar back as other reviewers suggested. I added dried cranberries, cinnamon, and walnuts. The old man thought it would have gone well with fruit. Doesn't really have a butterscotch flavor, but good nonetheless.

This was spot on.  Decreased the sugar to 1/4 c.  The egg was not overpowering as I was worried it would be.  I swear by Allrecipes!  Thanks again!!

I LOVE this oatmeal! It is the best! I made it for my son's birthday and he LOVED it! I used half as much sugar and added pumpkin pie spice

Great texture and very creamy, but I didn't get the butterscotch taste. I followed others users' suggestions and cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup and also cut the butter to 2 teaspoons. 

I'm a big fan of oatmeal and really loved the way this came together, so I'll try making it again with the original recipe. If you're a sweets person, I'd suggest following the original recipe because the changes I made resulted in a lack of sweetness.

This was really good. I liked the addition of the egg for an extra protein kick, though it did give it an interesting texture. I whisked the egg in the pan cold then mixed in the milk and sugar and then turned on the heat. Then I added the oats. No scrambled egg.

It was a little too sweet, though my kids adored it.  My daughter was annoyed that I made oatmeal instead of her usual toast, but when she ate it, she said, "This is really good. It's very sugary!"  That part is true. 

Next time I'll cut back on the sugar. I did get a hint of a butterscotch taste here and there, but mostly just sweet oatmeal.

I followed the recipe exactly as printed with the exception of using egg substitute (1 egg = 1/4 c egg substitute) in place of the egg. There was no distinction as to whether you should use light or dark brown sugar.  I opted for the light brown sugar.  I did not think any additional milk was called (either in cooking or serving).  This recipe is delicious in its original form.  The best homemade oatmeal I have ever tasted.  2nd time I made this receipe, I used 1/4 c Truvia Light Brown Sugar blend and 1 Tbs butter.  This was just as good and still plenty sweet.

Very easy and delicious.  I never add that much brown sugar, maybe 1/3 loosely packed.  This time I added cinnamon.  Delicious!  I've forgotten the butter before and it tasted great also.

Yummy just as others have suggested with 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I would still try to reduce the calories in this, maybe using skim milk (or almond milk), honey with molasses in place of brown sugar, and egg whites.

This oatmeal is delicious - my spouse said it was the best oatmeal I'd ever made. In trying to limit using animal products when cooking, I used almond milk, and Becel vegan butter (2 tsp instead of 2 tbsp as others suggested) (and free-range eggs). Like many other reviewers suggested, I halved the sugar. It was still plenty sweet, and I think next time I try it I will use even a bit less sugar. Thanks for this great recipe!

This was really good, I am glad I tried it. I have never eaten a full bowl of oatmeal before but I think I may become addicted to this. I cannot stop thinking about it. I only used 1/3 cup if brown sugar. Can't wait for breakfast tomorrow!

Came out perfect! My husband loved it and we were surprised at how creamy and tasty it was. Be careful not to have the heat too high else the egg will cook and that won't be nice :) Great recipe but if you are alarmed at the amount of sugar, a 1/4 cup still keeps it sweet and nice!

After removing the pieces of cooked egg, I didn't really get a butterscotch taste at all. It was basically brown sugar oatmeal... Won't make again.

So good! I only add 1/4 cup of brown sugar which is plenty sweet enough for me. I put raisins, sometimes apple pieces, nuts, etc. I've even tried it with a spoonful of Nutella and THAT'S heavenly!! Best stuff ever!

I've made this a number of times with half the sugar, and it's excellent. Lately I've been watching calories, and I've found this is still very good with only 1/8 cup of sugar, and no butter.

Yummmmm! ok so I'm ashamed to admit... But I used to buy those flavored packets of instant oatmeal. Then I realized how easy it is to make your own delicious version. This recipe is a game changer for me. I will make this very frequently with only minor changes: 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 and no butter.  Thank you for sharing!

This is delicious! I use half the butter, and sometimes I use a little less sugar (but not always! Sometimes my sweet tooth wins.) Try adding a little bit of vanilla for some extra flavor.

This is the first time I've made oatmeal that wasn't from a box or a package.  It's really good, nice and creamy, and very hearty!  I do agree with other reviewers that it's a bit sweet as is for breakfast (and I do have a sweet tooth!).  I would suggest cutting the brown sugar down to a generous 1/4 cup, and adding a splash of vanilla. Next time I'll try adding some fresh fruit too!

This was the most luxurious oatmeal! I did cut the brown sugar down to 1/4C. I used closer to 2C. skim milk, a capful of pure vanilla extract, a handful of chopped pecans & a small handful of chopped dried cherries! I will definitely be making this again!

Excellent recipe! It's decadent as is.  It's still delicious if you cut down the sugar and butter to make it a bit healthier.

I have made this recipe several times now and it is perfect as written. I did try reducing sugar and butter as some others suggested, but the flavor was not as good. I wouldn't change a thing!

I love this! I even make it with almond milk and it's just as good! A little too sweet so I scale back the sugar but it's awesome!

This is delicious. I've found that to make it taste better I usually have to soak the oats first in the milk for at least 15 minutes or so. I also cook it on low and stir it and let it take a long time to thicken up. That makes for a smoother oatmeal and the oats fully absorb the moisture and are nice and soft.

Was looking for a way to spruce up plain oatmeal and this hit the spot. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar as some suggested but with my sweet tooth I could have taken it a little sweeter. Added sliced almonds, cinnamon, and diced apples for some crunch. Has a great flavor and a wonderful gooey thick texture. It'll probably be my go-to oatmeal recipe!

This was my first time making oatmeal on the stovetop so I messed something up. I normally like drier oatmeal so this is different. Also having a hard time with the egg flavor.

Fantastic! I followed other reviewers and cut the brown sugar in half. We sprinkled crushed pecans on it-YUM! Due to a dairy allergy, we used vanilla soy milk-great substitute! We also ditched the butter.

I found that I can use whole grain Irish Style Oatmeal (5 grams fiber!) that one can find in the whole foods department of their grocer. Like other reviewers, I cut the brown sugar way down, but I did notice a slight "eggy" taste come through. You may have to experiment a little to get it right for your own taste buds. That being said....this recipe is creamy goodness with protein power that gives your day a great start!

I used steel cut oats (increasing the amount of milk substantially since steel cut oats need 30 minutes to cook).  Also, used only 3 tbsp brown sugar, and cut down the butter to 1 tsp.  It was still very good!

This is so easy to make!  I also use half the brown sugar, and I always add whatever fruit I have on hand at the end.  Sometimes I will throw in raisins and dried apple dices at the beginning so they soften while cooking.  I make this at least once a week now, and I had never been an oatmeal person before!

This has become a staple for breakfast in our home. It is that good! 
I must state that we did also reduce the sugar to 1/4 c and butter to 2 tsp and added a few dashes of cinnamon. We also vary with adding different nuts and/or berries and such to keep it interesting.

Nice flavour, creamy and filling (3/4c cooked).  I scaled back to 1/4c of brown sugar which was plenty (and I HAVE a sweet tooth!)Instead of butter I added 1 Tbsp of organic apple butter.  I'm not sure if it is necessary for egg (especially if you have an allergy)and if you are watching caloric intake you could reduce the milk and use water (for my WW friends) Would make again (I used GF Oats)

This oatmeal was quick and easy to make.  I think the egg gave it a nice richness.  I have never seen egg in an oatmeal recipe and thought it was a great addition, it gave the oatmeal a nice, rich flavor. I also cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and agree that it was plenty sweet.  I would probably even cut it a little more to just under a 1/4 cup.

Just finished trying to eat this oatmeal.  I made it exactly as written.  I will repeat what others are saying, "Reduce the sugar."  I could not finish it due to the level of sweetness.  I will try it again reducing the sugar to at least half if not more.  All I could taste was sugar:(

I was looking for something different and hot for breakfast, so I decided to try this. I myself don't care for oatmeal, and even I liked this. I doubled the recipe for me and my five kids. I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon on top, and we ate it all. Perfect just the way it is.

Every time I make oatmeal now, my kids come in and ask, "Is it the kind I like?"  I can't make just regular oatmeal anymore.  I cut the sugar by about half and it's plenty sweet.  This recipe is so creamy and satisfying.

Yummy!  It is really, really sweet though and I should have read the other reviews before making it and cut the brown sugar to 1/4 or even 1/3.  I did follow another reviewers advice and refrigerate the leftover for the next morning.  Next time I will cut down the brown sugar, and maybe try using apple butter instead of regular.

I always like to give the kids a hearty breakfast before the school day begins.  This has a great creamy texture but a little on the sweet side.  I will decrease the sugar for next time.

Wonderful recipe, but unless you have a serious sweet tooth I suggest only using half of the sugar. I will be making this often especially with the cold weather fast approaching.

I made this recipe for one serving. The serving calculator said to use 3/8 of an egg.  I had no idea how to do that so I just used one egg.  It's still okay but I don't think I'll scale it down again as it doesn't taste right.  I'll make it as is next time & save some for later. I did as reviewer junglepilotwife suggested & added the milk, egg & brown sugar to a cool pan & gradually brought up the heat. Next time I'll remember to add the apples as reviewer Kristi suggested. Thanks for sharing!

This was good, but too rich and thick for my taste. I couldn' even eat a whole bowl. I did love the fact that it was perfectly sweetened and I didn't have to add any extra sugar.

Yum!  This is delicious!  I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup, 1 T butter, and added raisins.  I agree that it is sweet enough this way and I am a sweet addict.

I have been looking for a way to wake up my boring oatmeal breakfast. and this was great, i was surprised that i enjoyed it, never thought about adding egg to my oatmeal.  It was just for me so i had leftovers and I didn't want to throw it away so I refrigerated it and ate it the next morning , the leftover was just as good, threw it in the microwave.  I never ate leftover oatmeal before, and the best thing, it was quick yea!

Very very thick.  I love the concept! But it's much to thick and sweet for our breakfasts.  Thanks for the starting point though!

I HATE oatmeal! but I LOVE this recipe! Truly amazing! I followed the advice of other reviewers and placed raisins in the mixture rather than adding them afterwards. I also reduced the sugar to 1/4. I can't wait for my husband to wake up to try it!

Fantastic oatmeal recipe! I also only used 1/3 cup brown sugar and think the butter could be left out to make it a bit healthier! Delicious!

This was delicious. I made it today for a Mother's Day Brunch. The only thing I did slightly different was reduce the amount of brown sugar, like other reviewers suggested. I doubled the recipe and added 3/4 cup brown sugar. It was still amazing. I love how thick and creamy it was! Next time I think I will reduce the butter a bit, and maybe even bring the brown sugar down a little more, maybe 1/2 cup, to make it the least bit healthier. And hey, if it's not sweet enough I can always add some after it all. All together, great recipe!

Love this, it is so good... however for more flavor I substituted vanilla soy milk and used 1/2 the amount of butter and 1/2 the amount of brown sugar (a little healthier and still great!)

Really great texture, but with only 1/4 c. brown sugar was still way too sweet.  My two year old loved it.  I added raisins during the cooking process which added even more sweetness.  I would take it down to 3 T. of sugar next time.

Wow!, so amazing.  I did the full amount of brown sugar and it wasn't too over powering.  Next time I'll try a little less to make it healthier.  I did not add the butter and we didn't even miss it.  I served it with a side of granola.

Very easy to do and tastes just great. I thought I messed up since I mixed the butter in as it cooked rather than AFTER it finished, and it still came out really good.

This is a great way to make oatmeal!  I had been looking for a way to make regular oatmeal have that umph.  Next time thought I'll add only half of the sugar called for.  It's a little sweet for me.

This oatmeal had a really great flavor and texture. I put in about 1/4 cup brown sugar and it was still really sweet. This will probably become my go-to recipe for oatmeal in the mornings!

WOW, this is REALLY sweet as written and I have a sweet tooth.  I tend to like my oatmeal a little on the dry side and this is very glutinous.  I don't think I'll be making again, but I'm glad I tried it.  I have looked at this loads of times, but never actually made.

Yum!  We omitted the butter and cut some of the sugar (didn't measure but I know it wasn't half a cup!), and added cinnamon.  For our elevation, we needed a bit more than 1 cup of oats for the milk; we used about 1 1/3. Absolutely delicious!  Next time, we'll cut milk and cook some apples along with it!  :)

This oatmeal is awesome!! After making the recipe as is I do have to agree with some of the reviews I read. It could use more milk and possibly less sugar. About 2 cups of milk and maybe 1/4 cup of sugar or maybe 1/3. The recipe as is came out very thick and the sweetness was almost overwhelming for me after a few spoonfuls and I have a big sweet tooth. Still it's a great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Excellent oatmeal! To lighten this up, I prepared this with 2 egg whites, 1 C skim milk, 3/4 C water, 1/4 C brown sugar, 2 T. sugar free-maple syrup, 1 cup of quick-cooking oats, and left out the butter. Soooo good.  This oatmeal has the best texture of any oatmeal I've eaten.....ever!

Very creamy. I added an additional 1/2 cup of and 1/4 cup milk to balance out the sweetness from the brown sugar. Very simple to make.

I had some left over pureed pumpkin from making pumpkin cookies so I added it along with some cinnamon. I completely forgot the butter and only put in about a tablespoon of sugar, thinking I would add more according to taste but never needed to! (and I have a huge sweet tooth!) Very versatile and easy... I never knew to add egg to oatmeal!

I took other reviewers advice and reduced the brown sugar. It was sweet but next time I may add just one more TBL above 1/4 cup. I would also double it next time but still only use one egg. Overall it was a good creamy bowl of oatmeal...

Delicious, filling, and way better than the stuff that comes in individual packets. I cut down on the butter to make it a bit healthier and cut back on the sugar just a tad, and I thought it was plenty sweet.  This one's a keeper.  Thanks, Kianas!

This was so delicious!  So clever to add an egg to oatmeal- makes it have a custard-like texture which is oh so yummy.  I love to experiment with adding things to oatmeal- but this is a much better base recipe than the traditional recipe.  I like to add vanilla, cinnamon, and nuts.  Also almond extract.  Berries make a delicious add in, too!

Delicious! I recalculated the recipe for 4 servings and per others' suggestions didn't use very much brown sugar- used about 1/8 cup and was sweet enough (could've probably used even less than that).  I also forgot to add the butter (oops!) but it still tasted great. Will definitely make again.

For oatmeal, this is mighty fine. I made it exactly according to the recipe and it was delicious, something I don't usually associate with a bowl of mush. It's also a recipe ripe for experimentation - using some artifical sweeteners, adding fruit, trying different baking spices like vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. I also had the kids help out which brought them to actually try the stuff. Not bad for a morning's work.

I live in a cold climate and have 2 kids. This recipe has become a staple for me! It´s really easy. However I omit the egg and find that there´s not much difference in flavor.

So, so good! Made it for breakfast and my younger sister (who never eats breakfast and never eats oatmeal) tasted some and asked for me to make it again! Only used 1/4 cup of sugar though and its plenty sweet enough.

Very good. Addition of the egg makes this creamier without using half/half or heavy cream. However, it's even MORE filling than normal oatmeal, given the protein added by the egg.  Modifications for me: 1/4 c. + 1 T of brown sugar, sprinkling of cinnamon, dash of vanilla, and fresh grated nutmeg. Made it at night with the plan to reheat in the AM!

This was quite tasty (kind of like a warm pudding), and the milk and egg add a nice protein kick to an oatmeal breakfast.  I used 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar and that was plenty.

Great recipe, Kiana5. Like the other reviewers, I cut down on the brown sugar (to 1/4 cup). The second time I made this I tried it without the egg and butter - just to try for a lower calorie version - and it was still great oatmeal!

DELICIOUS! My family loved this recipe. It reminded me of homemade tapioca pudding! I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and the butter to 1 tablespoon and it was still plenty sweet...if it wasn't so healthy I'd think I was having dessert! Definitely my new favorite recipe!

I doubled this for the fam today and they all liked it.  I did follow it exactly but forgot to add the butter.  I'm sure it's delicious with the butter but it really doesn't need it.  We will be making this again and again! It's very creamy and flavorful.

This oatmeal was really good and easy to make, I added a little vanilla and cinnamon, with these additions it was sort of like rice pudding, yum! PS: I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and less butter,(around 2 tsp) and it still came out sweet enough and we didn't miss the butter at all!

I always forget to come back and actually review the recipes, but I just had to comment on this one. This is a great recipe, exactly the way it is. But it is also very easy to adapt, if you want to or need to (diabetics, etc.) My husband raves about this oatmeal and begs me to make it all the time. While I love the recipe as is, I normally add some pecan pieces and a bit of vanilla right at the end. Sometimes a bit of milk or half and half in the bowl right before serving. Regardless, it always turns out delicious!

Yum! This recipe makes eating oatmeal so much easier. I serve mine with cooked cinnamon apples or peaches. If you don't like your oatmeal too sweet, I suggest cutting back on the brown sugar. After finding this recipe, I will never use instant oatmeal again!

This was the best oatmeal I have ever had and so easy to make!  My son said it tastes like pudding.  The only thing I did differently was add less sugar and less butter.  I used 1/4 cup sugar and 1 Tbls butter and it was plenty sweet and buttery.  Thanks for such a great recipe I never would have thought to put an egg in oatmeal!

WOW! I made this this morning for breakfast and changed the serving for 1 person and cut down on the sugar. I also used quick cook oats because that's all I had on hand. It was super delicious, just like eating pudding for breakfast but very filling. Thanks for this yummy treat!

oh my goodness.  this is sooo delicious and puts instant oatmeal to shame.  I used the method more than the ingredients, as I reduced the sugar to 3T. and the butter to 1 shy T. of smart balance.  added about 1/4c. golden raisins at the beginning and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  I saved the leftovers and can't get over how yummy it is: I refreshed it by pouring a little milk over the top of an individual serving and microwaving until hot then stirring it in.  definitely special enough for a weekend breakfast, I think my boyfriend will love it this Sunday too, maybe with a side of turkey bacon!  thanks for sharing your recipe!  try this one today!

This was really good.  Not too sure about calling it Butterscotch, but it had the taste of a custard.  I decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 cup as other reviewers had suggested, but I will probably increase the sugar next time to 1/3 cup.

If you've ever made oatmeal from those store-bought packets or made your own and it turned out slimy, try this recipe! You will never, ever buy the little packets again. And this is the best non-slimy, home-made oatmeal I have ever had. I scaled the recipe to four servings, which then called for 1-1/3 beaten egg, so I just used two and then scaled back on the milk a bit. I also added a pinch of salt to the oats (it helps cut the sweetness), and at the end, when I added the butter (I rounded the scaled measurement up to 3T), I also added a nice dash of vanilla. My whole family loved it - they described it as "butterscotch french vanilla". It is pretty sweet, so you may prefer to cut back on the brown sugar a bit. Next time, I will take out a T. or two of the sugar. The eggs give it a richness and creaminess that is just wonderful (not to mention the added protein will prevent you or your kids from being hungry again in an hour). Thanks very much for this recipe!

Really good, coming from someone who doesn't care for oatmeal but makes it for the family. I actually loved this oatmeal! I changed brown sugar to 1/4C as other recommended, changed butter to 1 tbs and added tsp of cinnamon, 3/4C of raisins and 2 tbs of chopped pecans. So good. Thank you for the recipe.

I am giving this recipe a four-star rating because it has way too much sugar and butter as written, but it is one of my all-time favorite recipes.  My children call it "oatmeal pudding" and request it at least twice a week for breakfast.  I use 2 tablespoons brown sugar and no butter.  I make it like rice pudding by adding raisins, cinnamon, and a little vanilla.  Delicious.

This is really good but is a little too sweet as is.  I now make it, which is often, using half the brown sugar and it's just right.  Creamy and delicious!

YUM! YUM! YUM!  This is the best oatmeal that I have had!  I did make it how the recipe calls for but I thought that was a little too sweet. (AND I love sweets) The second time I made it, I used 1/3 cup br sugar and it was PERFECT for my family!!

I give it 3 stars because personally I can think of many other ways I'd prefer to have oatmeal, but my 2 year old yelled out loud on the 1st and 2nd bites, "This is good!"

Very good! My kids loved it and I cut back on the sugar too. Very creamy and filling and versatile; we added chopped dates to ours. Make sure you stir constantly once it starts to bubble to keep it from sticking. Perfect for cold mornings. Thanks!

It's so rich and creamy. I reduced the amount of sugar to half of what it's called for and add carrots and raisins instead. It's so nice and my 14 months old son just loves it.

I've made this twice now in one weeks time.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was good.  The second time I omitted the brown suger and butter and threw in butterscotch chips.  OH MY.  It's outstanding!  I'll look forward to trying chocolate and peanut butter chips as well : )  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good!  This batch was enough for 3 breakfasts for me.  I've made it twice now and made the following changes:
1.  Don't let it get too thick then it kind of becomes a clump
2.  Add about a tsp of cinnamon (I did 2 because I love it!)
3.  I only used 1/4 C of brown sugar and it was perfectly sweet to me.  This way you can add more if you want more on the top but you can't subtract!

Very tasty, easy to make, had to double it for 3 people. Too sweet for us though any one with a sweet tooth would love this I might lower the brown sugar next time or even add honey instead but then it wouldnt be butterscotch if I did that :) Love the egg in it!

WOW!  I didn't think I could EVER replace my Quaker Oatmeal with Maple and Brown sugar. . .but this is it!  I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar as most people recommended and also used quick oats.  One reviewer mentioned saving the leftovers in the fridge and re-warming the next day.  I will try that!  It doesn't take too long to make, but anything that speeds up my morning is a plus.

I think this is probably a good recipe, but I didn't care for it, since I don't like really creamy oatmeal.  It smelled just like the oatmeal from my childhood, but upon tasting it, I was not a fan.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I'm sure its great if you like creamy oatmeal.

The best oatmeal I have ever made.  Who knew an egg would make such a difference!  I made mine with vanilla soymilk instead of regular milk and cut the brown sugar by half since I didn't want anything too sweet.  It was fantastic, and I didn't feel shorted on the sweetner at all.

I have never had oatmeal with eggs in it before.  Very creamy.  A little too sweet for me, but I will make again with less sugar.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I am giving it a 4 because I thought it was just alright with no real butterscotch flavour but my fiance thought it was great.  Careful with the sugar, I have made it twice now, once by the book (which turned out well) and another time eyeballing the sugar and it came out sticky and too sweet.

I love the consistency and overall taste.  (I did add 1/2 tsp. salt).  Per my own personal taste, I will cut the sugar to 1/4 cup next time. This would also be great with additions like pecans, raisins, and/or cranberries!

This is great as a dessert or as breakfast.  I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup, added toasted chopped pecans and chopped dried cranberries.  I also added the sliced vanilla bean from my brown sugar (it was the last of it) and cooked that in the milk mixture before adding the oatmeal.  MMMMMMMMMMMMMM!

This was very good.  I cut the sugar in half and won't do that next time.  We like sweet!  I also cut the milk by 1/4 cup and I'll probably put that back in next time because it was really, really thick.  Added sliced bananas to the top and I think it would also be great with cinnamon and/or raisins.

Very good taste. I only boiled the oats for the last minute, per the instructions on the container, as I like texture. I think I'll just dispense with the egg next time, as I didn't really care for the custard-like consistency it gave to the oatmeal. Definitely cut down on the brown sugar.

This was delicious oatmeal! I cut the butter down and used half fake brown sugar but it still tasted great! 
Added a few pecans and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Will definitely make it again!

YES, finally a way to get my kids to eat oatmeal. Yes, it's sweet but I think the health benefits of wholsome oatmeal and egg outweighs that.  Thanks Kiana5 for making our mornings easier!

A pretty tasty treat.  Easy enough for my toddler to help make and easy enough to eat :)  I did cut the sugar and butter in half and added sliced apple.

I only add 1/3 C brown sugar and after tasting it I had to add some salt.  I think this was my first time eating homemade oatmeal and I thought it was pretty good.  The texture is definitetly different than instant.

My daughters and I tried this this morning as an alternative to instant.   It definitely blows instant right out of the water.  It was a little too sweet for us though, so we'll be cutting back on the brown sugar next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good.  Next time, I will decrease the sugar by half!  Of course, my kids probably won't like it as much w/o all the sugar.  It was super easy to prepare, and I loved the creamy texture.  Thanks for the recipe!

Tasted more like a dessert then a breakfast food. I would reduce the suger by half and maybe leave out the egg. Its almost a custard with oatmeal in it.
I would add more liquid as it was on the gummy side and my 3 year old spent more time playing with it, rather then eating it. Try it you might like it. maybe not.

I just love this. It's great how it is, but after experimenting a bit, I don't add the butter or quite that much sugar. Just the egg, the milk, a tsp of brown sugar and a splash of vanilla extract. Afterwards, I add in a teaspoon of strawberry yogurt for extra taste! I could eat this three meals a day =)

We did not care for this. We couldn't even finish eating it.  I used less sugar and still it was way too sweet.  Don't waste your time or ingredients--there are too many good recipes out there.

Quite sweet.  Next time I won't use as much sugar.  Taste it before adding the sugar--you probably won't need it all.

I never had homemade oatmeal before (I always stuck with instant), but this was pretty good.  I'm on a diet, so I made it with SugarTwin brown sugar, 1% milk and light margarine and it turned out well.  I reduced the sugar like everyone suggested, and I meant to only put in 1/4 cup, but I only had a little sugar left in the box so I dumped it in (and it turned out a bit too sweet).  I will definitely make this again.

Really good, kind of reminded me of butterscotch pudding at first!  So easy too.  I used skim milk and it still came out really thick and creamy.  I used 1/3 cup sugar, and next time will use 1/4 cup as it was still a little too sweet.  My husband enjoyed this too.

The flavor was great.  It wasn't my family's favorite, but amazing flavor.

Mmmm!  Yummy with a capital "Y"!  My kids loved this, and thought it would make just as good a desert as it does breakfast.

This is very good. I like my oatmeal sweet, so it was just right for me. The only thing I added was a little salt.

A good recipe and one that I will make again, with modifications.  I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 of what it called for and it was still a little too sweet for me.  Also, it was a bit eggy tasting.  Next time I will reduce the brown sugar more and reduce the egg by a little bit (I was using egg substitute so that could be the problem).  Overall, a yummy and creamy dish that makes for a fast breakfast!

Hubby and son love this recipe. It is too sweet for me - but I am more of a fruit oatmeal type.  I make it every other week for them... they'd have it every other day if I let them (competition with chocolate Malt o meal)

Thanks Kiana

This tasted good but it was very sticky 
so its probably the cook here. I also doubled the recipe and maybe I forgot something. I will deffinately try this again.

Just tried it again this morning and it came out great! Very rich but the kids loved it. Thanks

If I could rate this more stars, I would. I have searched for this recipe for a couple of years.  My mom used to make this all the time when we were kids, and couldn't remember (or she didn't want to share)the recipe.  Thank so much for posting this!!
