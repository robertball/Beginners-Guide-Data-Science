Thanx so much for all the glowing reviews -- my grandmother has since passed, and it warms my heart to know that her cooking has touched so many people :)................................................ Edit: For those of you having trouble with curdling, it is key that the top of the double boiler be ABOVE (not sitting in) the simmering (not boiling) water to prevent overheating. Also, make sure you whisk in the lemon juice OFF the heat. America's Test Kitchen just released their recipe, and it is almost identical in technique. As for the amount of lemon juice, this is how it was served to me my entire childhood, and I always found it bland at restaurants, so experiment to find your personal preference!

Excellent hollandaise sauce recipe. I made this with eggs benedict. The amount of lemon juice was perfect for me. If it begins to separate,  just add a splash of cold water and whisk very fast.

A big lemon taste. We used fresh squeezed lemon so it had a full favor as apposed to the acidic taste of the non fresh variety. We served it  over an Italian version of eggs Benedict (prosciutto and rustic Italian bread instead of Canadian bacon and English muffins) A keeper, thanks

Simply divine! I gradually added the lemon juice and stopped when it suited my own taste which was about 1 Tbsp.  Remember:  You can always add, but you can't take away.

THIS IS THE ONE!  I have tried several recipes including the ones made in the blender.  This is exactly what I think of when I think Hollandaise sauce.  So simple and so good.

This recipe is very simple. I doubled everything except the lemon juice and it was still to much. I will make this again but 1 1/2 teaspoons instead of a full 1 1/2 tablespoons.

This was my first time making hollandaise and it came out GREAT!  I found that as the sauce sat  the lemon flavor intensified, so next time I will add a little less.  I kept squeezing some in from a fresh lemon so I'm not sure exactly how much I used.  I think the best way to judge is taste and if it's just about there, let it sit 5 minutes and it will be perfect.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was as good as you can get (better in some cases!) in any restaurant.

Didn't have a double boiler so added water and butter in a pan on low on oven until melted through and slowly added in egg yolks and it worked out perfectly!

This is easy to understand and follow. The flavor is great. As with any natural flavoring, it's going to vary depending on what you have. If the lemons are tart, you may need less, which is why the suggestion to add at the end is there. Ours came out perfect.

I usually use the Knoor brand hollandaise sauce packet but this was just as easy and so much more flavor.  I only used 1 1/2 tsp of lemon juice and no cayenne.  Served over eggs benedict and even my picky hubs said this was a do over.. I'll not be buying the packets anymore, this will be my go to recipe.

My Christmas Brunch consisted of this lovely sauce *extremely decadent and luscious*! **Absolutely be sure to use unsalted butter and add at the very end to avoid over-salting***. I did not do that this first try around and went a little too heavy handed to my taste but that's my own error (the man loved it). 
This recipe is so simple! I am very organic/non-GMO and hormone free/free range exploring and experimenting and this fits so well. Personally i added baby kale (organic) with my Traditional Yule Eggs Benedict. this sauce could be easily used w/ nearly everything and will be a rare treat for us but so very anticipated. Thank you and your late Grandmother for sharing.

I'm rather obsessed with eggs benedict and the hollandaise sauce is what makes it or breaks it.  Your's was perfect!  Easy to do at home, and the cayenne was the perfect touch!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

My sauce was really runny, so I added a tsp of flour to it and it finally thickened up nicely.  The lemon taste was strong at first, but after sitting for about 5 minutes was delicious.  Also used about 1/2 tsp or more of cayenne pepper and my husband was raving about it.

This is so yummy! It separated once but I added a splash of cold water and whisked really fast, just like one reviewer said to do. It saved the sauce!

A little more lemon flavor than I would have like, and I would add less water the next time so it would thicken quicker.

I made hollandaise for the first time using this recipe and it turned out great.  For my kids taste they felt it was a little too "lemony" so I reduced that in my next batch, but the consistency is great and I love the pinch of cayenne pepper to it.  I absolutely love it served over my sausage and potato hash and an over easy egg :)  This will be me go to recipe for hollandaise!

I don't believe I had ever had H sauce previously but ran across it discussed on a website and decided I wanted to try it.  I just got done making it and it was wonderful.  I made it exact to the recipe - pinch of Cayenne included and I loved it.  It will be served with Brussels Sprouts shortly.  THANKS!

This was really flavorful and tasty. I had never made or even eaten hollandaise sauce before that I know of but a reviewer of a salmon cakes recipe I wanted to make suggested serving with a lemon sauce recipe found on this site and I thought, yum, lemony sauce!... I placed the egg in a bowl set on a steam basket over a pan of boiling water and after 5 minutes it still wasn't thickening so I poured the mixture into a little saucepan and stirred it constantly over low heat (2 out of 10 heat setting). I took about 5 minutes to start thickening but it came out great!  I tossed in a little parsley at the end to make it look nice like the picture on here. It is perfect for fish cakes or broiled fish. For eggs or other purposes, you may want to reduce the lemon if you don't want the sauce to be a little lemony. But I definitely feel that this is a restaurant quality sauce, although simple. This was not hard to make and worth the effort. Into my recipe box it goes!

Very nice sauce! I think I'll do a bit of a bigger pinch of cayenne next time though.

Just made this right now. It was so delicious....and melt in your mouth kind of food. It was quick and easy to make. Ate this with a sunny side-up egg. This was my first time making it and would definitely make again and again and AGAIN!

WAY too much lemon, but if you bring it down to about 1 tsp it is lovely. I recommend at least doubling the recipe so you can be generous with the portions. Very quick and easy.

Perfect!  I have tried and tried to make a good hollandaise sauce and they never tasted quite right...until now.  I only put 1 teaspoon of lemon and it was perfect for me.  =)  Thank you!!

Very easy and tasty. But as several other commenters have mentioned, I think the recipe calls for far too much lemon. Good otherwise.

De-lish! I landed on this recipe after my first attempt bombed. This worked beautifully - make sure you don't give the eggs too much heat or they'll scramble!! I didn't add the lemon juice but  just a dash of vinegar. Had it with eggs benny - made enough for 3 servings.

Definitely a keeper.  Half a lemon was perfect for me.  I used Louisiana Hot Sauce instead of cayenne.  Yum!

Very tasty! It was a little heavy on the lemon, so depending on what I was serving it with, I might lessen that a bit in the future, but on salmon, it's lovely just the way it is!

This Hollandaise sauce is amazing. I personally used 1 Tbls of lemon juice since I used the lemon juice from a jar. I previously made a hollandaise sauce in a blender and was highly disappointed so I was afraid to try this one. and I am pleased to say it exceeded my expectations and tasted much better then any hollandaise sauce I've ever had. This is going to go into the family cookbook! Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe. ??

I thought this recipe was great! Super easy, flavorful, smooth and was really wonderful. I whisked the egg yolks before placing them over the boiling water, only because I find that sometimes there are just one too many things happening at the same time to make this smooth. Honestly though, I think it would have been perfectly fine doing just as Grandma said.

Very simple recipe and I used a bowl on top of a little saucepan since I didn't have a double boiler. Also used only 1 tsp of lemon juice and it was perfect. You can add more cayenne pepper to your taste. Thanks for this great recipe for my first time making this ever!

Did not like this version of Hollandaise. Adding water made it unstable. Too much lemon for my taste. I was expecting a creamier and smother product.

Putting egg yolks first into the double boiler and beating them on their own is a recipe for scrambled eggs rather than hollandaise.  Also, I found that this ended up tasting really weak and too lemony.  The hollandaise in the picture looks completely different from what I made.  Definitely needed more egg yolks and no water.  The water just makes it taste...watery.

I love hollandaise sauce, but this came out horrible. We followed the recipe exactly, but it came out clumpy, watery and way too sour. Even if there was flavor there, the lemon killed it.

I really like this technique and I think doing it this way saved me. I had some frozen egg yolks left over from making meringue so I quadrupled the recipe. I think the majority of the issues I had were due to the egg yolks being frozen but when I added the butter they curdled and looked like a nasty mess. Rather than throw it away I decided to blend it with a stick blender, and it still looked nasty. Then I added the water because I figured it was just water. Once I added the water and stick blended it, it magically transformed into the perfect Hollandaise. I didn't end up adding the full amount of water because I think it would have been runny and maybe you want to watch the salt because mine was pretty salty (but that's preference anyway). It would have been a bit lemony for my taste so I just added a small amount at a time. It is a very forgiving technique and the sauce held much longer than other's I've made. I'm pretty sure the majority of my difficulties came from using frozen egg yolks and quadrupuling the recipe.

Not sure what happened...followed the recipe exactly and it never thickened and did not taste good.  There was no flavor at all to the sauce and it was very thin.  :(
