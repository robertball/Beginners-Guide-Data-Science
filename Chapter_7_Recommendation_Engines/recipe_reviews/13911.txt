Wonderful and definitely warms the tummy! I used skim milk instead of soy milk and I highly recommend using REAL maple syrup. I also used toasted walnuts instead of almonds, left out the cardamom and added some nutmeg as it pairs well with cinnamon. You could easily sub dried cranberries for the raisins - a great fall recipe!

Oh my gosh, thank you so much for sharing this recipe! This is absolutely wonderful! I didn't have all the ingredients the recipe called for -- I used skim milk instead of soy, walnuts instead of almonds, and nutmeg instead of cardamom. Just delicious -- I can't say enough good things about this recipe. Not too sweet or rich -- it is just perfect.

Oooh...I had this today and it's SO good!  Also added a dash of nutmeg, which was good...works well with white rice too, of course.  Just a note - if the taste of soy milk bothers you (I can't stand the stuff), try rice milk, which is much milder and works just as well.

I am 76 years old and have eaten this (with many variations) since I was knee-high to a gnat. There ae so many ways you can vary it, and if it doesn't come out "right" it's because you didn't cook your rice right. Just because one person doesn't like a recipe does that make it bad.  Food is all according to taste.  You know, some like their foods spicy hot, others don't, etc. Adjust it to your taste or miss out on a good recipe!!

I used fat free milk, dried blueberries (I'm out of raisins right now) and my homemade sugar free maple syrup. My kids thought this was GREAT. Like having rice pudding for breakfast. No leftovers. NOTE: I did not cook the almonds in with the cereal, I stirred them in right before serving so they wouldn't be soggy. I'm going to try this with Craisins tomorrow. I think this would be good using fat free evaporated milk if I were going to pass this off as a low-calorie/low sugar rice pudding.

Yippee!!! I love rice pudding, but thought I'd have to give it up now that I'm making an effort to eat healthier. This is great with the brown rice and soy milk, and I loved the added crunch of almonds. I only used about 1/2 of the syrup called for, and I did end up having to add extra liquids, too. But this was yummy!!! Thank you for sharing!

I loved this!!!!  I only used 3T of maple syrup.  It did require addtional soy milk as it was kinda dry, but no big deal to add that as you cook it.  Loved it!

This is very good, a nice change from our usual breakfast fare.  I used left-over rice from the night before and low-fat milk for the soy milk.   This recipe can easily be adjusted to your personal taste; a nice base to work off of.  Thank you for sharing.

I made a lot of changes to this recipe but I really wanted to leave a review because I love the result!  First, you need 2 cups of water to 1 cup of rice.  After the rice was tender I added craisins instead of raisins, a pinch of NuNatural Stevia Extract, 2 cups almond milk (vanilla flavored) & 1 cup of water.  I let it simmer awhile until it reduced quite a bit.  I omitted the cardamom & added sliced, raw almonds when I served it.  Excellent & healthy!  What a great idea -thank you!

Nice basic recipe. I noticed some complaints about not enough water to cook the rice... Um, the recipe calls for cooked rice, so the water is not to cook the rice. We're using leftover already cooked rice here.  I specifically looked for recipes using leftover rice, so I was glad to find this one. Very versatile! Don't have raisins? Use another fruit! Use a different nut! Omit nuts! Change it around to your taste. It's a very forgiving recipe.

The kids just didn't care for this. I ended up making it twice. I don't know if it's a typo or what but 1 cup of water is not enough to cook brown rice unless you want hard little bits. Of course I didn't think about that until after I had already made it. The next time I made it with white rice as I didn't have enough brown and it was just mediocre. Definitely not anything I would go out of my way to make again. Sorry

No problem if you don't like soy. Try milk or almond milk instead. This is a recipe that allows for personal changes to the liquid and the spice - to say nothing of the type of rice as it's good with short grain rice as well. I also cut back on the amount of maple syrup.

I liked this recipe because it is dairy free.  My son has food allergies so this was absolutely perfect.  He liked it and he does not usually eat cooked cereal.  I think I would cook the rice a little longer with twice as much water, but the rest of the dish was a perfect blend.  I used coconut milk in place of the soy.  That was good and reduces the sugar in the recipe.  Yummy!!!!

I liked this...but my kids hated it. I'm not sure if it was a taste or texture thing. Using soy milk is new to me...I'm just experimenting with it as a healthier lifestyle choice....but I can't get past the "soy" taste in this one. I used vanilla soy, but there is just no geting around it I guess. Not a big hit with the hubby either. I will make it again, but will be the only one eating it.

i prepared my rice beforehand by cooking 1 c. rice with 2-2 1/2 c. water & store in fridge till ready to make pudding.  i used 2% milk instead of soy milk, also 2 Tbs. brown sugar instead of syrup and only 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  topped with slivered almonds and blueberries rather than raisins. we found it to be a little chewier than we thought it might be, but will try again to see if we can achieve a creamier result next time.

Yum! What a great way to use left over rice too! I used craisins (I didn't have raisins), and I used toasted pecans instead of almonds. I didn't have soy milk, so used whole milk. It still tasted great. Thanks for the great recipe Jessie.

Absolutely delish! We always have leftover brown rice in the fridge, and this is a perfect fit :-) 
I had to sub skim milk and cashews because that's all I had on hand, and I didn't have any cardamom either. Even short on ingredients, it was a winner!

For Cheryl and others not liking soy milk, try Almond milk; it's delicious and comes in a variety of percents.  90, 60, 40, original and vanilla.

It's an awesome idea, but needed some real technical tweaking. Use short-grain if you have it; it's more starchy, and more starch = more creamy. Next, you have two options: 1) put everything together, adding at least 50% more of each liquid, and cook until it's done, at least an  hour. 2) Use at least twice the amount of water, and add a pinch of salt. Only cook it for 30 minutes, drain the extra water off, put it back in the pot, cover, and let sit 10 minutes. Remove to a covered bowl. Put everything else in the pot, doubling the milk, heating gently. You might try adding a cinnamon stick in place of the ground cinnamon, and either 1 tsp of vanilla extract or a vanilla bean split open. Add the rice back in, bring only to a simmer, stirring, for about a half hour or until the milk is cooked down and the texture is rich and creamy. Otherwise, not bad.

Made this tonight and we liked it a lot.  Add more cinnamon, some vanilla extract, more raisins and maple syrup.  I guess we have a sweet tooth.  Oh, and you need 2 cups of water to one cup of rice!

This dish has been perfect for all of the very cold mornings we are having this winter:  a great stick-to-your-ribs breakfast!  I make it with my leftover basmati rice, and I don't always toast the almonds.  Contrary to the experience of another reviewer, I have never found the almonds get soggy.  Also unlike many other reviewers, I think the cardamon is essential for a wonderful flavor that just works great with the cinnamon.  Finally, the prep time is nowhere near 15 minutes.  This is a wonderfully filling, warm breakfast that you can serve in 10 minutes flat!

This is really tasty.  Today is day 1 of eating gluten free and I was really happy to come across this recipe.  It was rich and creamy.  I used 1/4 cup of syrup and it was plenty sweet.  I would actually prefer even less.  I didn't have any raisins so I used craisins and added a dash of nutmeg.

This was delicious! I used almond milk because that is what I had and left out the cardamon (not a favorite). Real maple syrup added a real depth of flavor. Also added a tablespoon of cream on top which was decadent!

This is a good recipe. I used about a cup and a half of leftover brown rice, 2/3 cup milk, 2 1/2 tablespoons pure maple syrup, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. I also added a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg and some toasted almonds.

I like this basic recipe.  I used white rice (all I had on hand) and 2% milk, next time I will try coconut milk or almond milk.  I left out the nuts, because I was serving it to my toddler.  Over all it was a hit, and I plan to pass it on to my GF friends.  I really think you can play with this recipe and mix in other ingredients to suit your tastes and have it turn out well.

VERY yummy and can work with white rice as well! Hint: if you don't have real maple syrup, just add some water to brown sugar and there you go! Nutmeg also tastes very nice in this too.

This was very tasty.  I used leftover rice, added more milk and cooked for 10 min.  I like cardamom, but I think nutmeg would taste better in this next time.

After eating the second day it's still good but, I found it needs something, I think honey would be good in it too.   I've never had rice pudding before and I have to say this was FANTASTIC!!!  It's a good stick-with-you breakfast and will be a staple in my house.  I have to say however that the 1 cup water to 1 cup rice ratio didn't seem to work out that well for me.  I was afraid of burning the rice so I didn't cook it as long as I should have, which unfortunately resulted in some bits of hard rice.  Next time I will add more water w/ the rice before adding everything else.  I also didn't use raisins or cardamom just because I didn't have either.  I used almonds and walnuts instead.  It's an excellent dish!  Thanks for sharing Jessie!

SOOOO DELICIOUS!!  I also used less cardamom than the recipe calls for and chopped walnuts instead of almonds...simply wonderful.  I've never liked rice pudding before, to be honest, and thought I'd give it another go.  I'm glad I found this recipe.  Thanks!

YUMMMM.....I have a lot of allergies, try to limit my soy intake, and live with someone with diabetes.  I replaced the maple syrup with Agave Maple (Low Glycemic Organic Sweetener) and unsweetened almond milk.  It was SOOOOOO delicious.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again.  :)

This was really good.  I couldn't even tell it was brown rice.  I did a couple things differently based on what I had on hand (pecans instead of almonds, pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon and cardamom), but nothing that really changed the recipe.

I've been looking for a healthy breakfast for my 10 month old that wasn't oatmeal, and this was pretty good. I agree that the water should be increased to two cups unless it is instant brown rice you are using. I made the full batch so that my husband and I could eat it as well, but it didn't go over so well with the husband. He likes raisins, but doesn't love them, and 1/2 cup raisins is a lot of raisins. He ended up leaving a pile of raisins in his bowl after breakfast was over. Next time I think I will use chopped apple and pear for most of the raisins, but I'll still throw a few in there since my son loves them.

Stumbled upon this recipe while looking for vegetarian breakfast options.  Perfect!  After reading other reviews, I doubled both the water and the soy milk, and I was happy with it that way.  It's not exactly a pudding consistency even then -- more like what my mom just called "rice and raisins" when I was a kid -- but it's so, so tasty and filling.  I decided to reduce the cinnamon in subsequent batches and found that 1/2 tsp was plenty. Hmmm, I'm making myself hungry for it, just writing about it!

I made it without the almonds and really liked it, but the brown rice takes awhile to soften so I just kept adding more soy milk.

I would give this 5 stars, except that 1/4 cup of maple syrup is waaay too much, especially for breakfast. I used white rice (it's what I had leftover), regular milk, and two tablespoons of maple syrup. With the raisins it was still too sweet for me and next time I will only use one tablespoon. I can't imagine how sweet it would be if your soy milk is sweetened too! Otherwise I will make this again and again.

Mediocre is about the only way to describe this recipe. Maybe if the soy milk and syrup were left out and served as a side dish it would be better but . . . I won't make it again. I'll stick with my old fashioned recipe for rice pudding.

Love it! Healthy and tasty!! Had to modify based on what I had in the house. Used brown rice syrup and long grain white rice and added some currants. Topped it with a scoop of vanilla frozen yogurt. Delish!! My teenage son loved it too! Thanks for the recipe.

Yum! I was looking for some sort of rice pudding to make with my brown rice leftovers- this is tasty!!! I didn't have cardamom so made it without, and even used fake maple syrup but it tastes delicious and smells up the house with wonderful yumminess.  Great crunchy almond chunks.  Love it!

I think there might be a mistake in this recipe. The first step is to cook the brown rice. If you want to cook 1 cup of brown rice, you need to cook it in 2 cups of water (not 1 cup of water).

I found that the cardamom was too strong in this recipe (and I like cardamom!). It might be that I used freshly ground cardamom, but either way, I would use 1/2 or 1/4 of what the recipe calls for next time. I might have to throw out the batch since the cardamom flavour is too overwhelming...

I thought that recipe was alright. I don't know if I just didn't add enough milk or what but I thought it was kind of dry. I guess I just prefer a more thick, creamy rice pudding.

This is great!  I made it for Mother's Day, and she loved it.  She's allergic to wheat, dairy, and eggs, so her normal breakfast is a piece of brown rice bread, and her normal Mother's Day breakfast is Cream of Rice.  She was happy to have something normal and nutritious, and it's something the whole family liked, too.  Thanks!

The ingredients and flavor are much like my mother’s baked rice pudding, it is a comfort food memory. To capture that memory, I doubled the milk (not soy) and used nutmeg instead of cardamom. Do try a sweeter rice pudding with cardamom, or even peppercorns, as that is a delicious flavor too. This one was perfect with cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg. We prefer the toasted almonds sprinkled on top  when served. Thanks for this recipe!

I used red rice and almond milk and dried cranberries for the rice, milk and raisins. I also added an 1/8th cup coconut and sunflower seeds and a tablespoon flax. I mixed it together and heated it in the microwave on high for 3 minutes. It was delicious.

This is a great versatile recipe that lends itself to individual taste. I added a little more milk and 2 eggs and simmered. I wanted to increase the protein and it came out so yummy! I used currants because I didn’t have raisins-but any dried fruit or even fresh berries would be great!

I love this recipe because the only sweet is maple syrup and dried fruit. I used cashew milk and craisens. This turned out fantastic and will be making it again soon.

I've made this with leftover brown rice before. This time I used black rice and coconut milk, which was sweet enough not to need any additional sweetener of any kind

It tasted exactly as I would expect it to taste, given the ingredients.  It was pretty good.  I would say that it is really similar to Oatmeal with a different texture.  My 2yr old really liked it too.  I would definitely try this again.

Yum! I made this for the kiddos and they loved it. I did add 1 tsp of vanilla extract, 1/2 cup more of milk and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg instead of cardamom as others have suggested. I also omitted the almonds since I didn't have any on hand. Great recipe will make again!

A big favorite amongst the family. May have added more cinnamon to give it a richer flavor. I added about 1/3 cup of brown sugar and will add some more nutmeg. I also used some vanilla soy milk both to make it a bit creamer and to add some more flavor.

This recipe was pretty good. A few substitutions I made were I used milk instead of soy milk and I used sugar-free maple syrup. It turned out comfortingly thick and creamy and made my kitchen smell wonderful. Thanks or the recipe!

This was really good and a nice change from the usual breakfast foods.  Initally, I cooked the rice with two cups of water and a pinch of salt.  I didn't have any soy milk but substituted whole milk (I needed to use it up).  I substituted dried cherries for the raisins-it tasted really good with the cardamom.  I also added nutmeg per another reviewer's recommendations.  I will make this again.  I wonder if this can be made ahead and reheated.

Awesome! This is easy to make, fills you up. It's a great recipe to tweak, as well. I didn't have maple syrup, so I used a combo of molasses and honey which seemed fine. I also added chopped apples and dates to the raisins to add to the fiber and fruit content. I love to take it to work to nuke up for breakfast. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent, Excellent breakfast.  I was looking for something different that would be healthful.  This is it.  It was not too sweet (I cut the syrup down a little) and substantial enough for a big guy.  I also used chopped walnuts which I enjoy and always have on hand.

Love it!  Can't use soy milk or nuts because my husband has allergies, so I used 1% cow's milk and omitted the nuts altogether.  I think I might cut back just a little bit on the maple syrup next time - 1/4 a cup was just a little too sweet for my taste.  I also left out the cardamom because I just couldn't find it in the pantry!!  I'm excited to have something to do with our leftover rice - which happens a lot in our house after supper (this time it happened to be short grain brown rice) and I can't wait to share it with my son in the morning for breakfast. *I also agree with one of the other reviewers - to cook brown rice (unless it's 'instant') it will take 2 cups liquid for every cup of rice.
