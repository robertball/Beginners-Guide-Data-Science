I love this recipe because it doesn't make me feel so guilty about eating brownies. I mean c'mon, they have tofu AND whole wheat flour. I added chopped almonds to mine and used coconut oil instead of olive. BTW, olive oil should not be used in sweets or in much baking because 1. The taste and 2. It can't hold the temperature for most baking and gives off a toxic when it hits its smoking point. Coconut oil on the other hand gave these brownies an awesome smell and it has a fairly high smoking point. Also I double boiled the chocolate and the oil together, and then added them to the sugar and tofu. So, I say this is a good starter recipe with some minor changes.

This is really good for a tofu brownie. Nothing beats a full fat, rich chocolate brownie but if you are looking for something on the healthier side, then this is really good. It's chocolately and moist. I used coconut oil instead of olive oil because I feel olive oil has a strong flavor that I wouldn't want in my brownie.

I took advice from other reviews and used coconut oil instead of olive oil as well as the whole 12oz silken tofu. I also used all bittersweet chocolate because that's what I had on hand. These came out incredible!! I've been adding in vegan dishes to my menu for the last few months and this is by far the best dessert I've come across. Will become a regular part of the dessert rotation. They were super easy as well!

Delicious! These are the best brownies I've ever made. I used the 365 every day value dark chocolate chunks (I got them at Whole Foods) and used Ghirardelli for the bittersweet squares. I also used the whole package of tofu as others have mentioned. I think next time I'll try using coconut oil rather than olive and stevia rather than white sugar. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

Good recipe to use as a base.  I made this recipe because we didn't have any bananas to make smoothies with our silken tofu, and my mom challenged me to make tofu taste like chocolate.  Instead of olive oil, I used canola oil and canned pumpkin.  Since we are not vegans, I included one egg with the tofu, etc.  When I had everything mixed up, I thought the consistency was a bit stiff, so I added a bit of vanilla yogurt.  The result was moist and tasty!

Delicious.  I was looking for a recipe using a half container of silken tofu and no other dairy. This was easy and delicious.  I would definitely make this again.

These are delicious! I followed the recipe but made a double batch, using a 9 X 13 pan. I ran out of olive oil so substituted 1/2 cup of butter (wish I'd thought about applesauce). Also, I didn't use the dark chocolate bar. I use Droste cocoa powder and it's really a robust cocoa powder. Also, I used half coconut sugar and half muscovado sugar.  I bake with olive oil all the time, using it almost exclusively for everything that calls for oil. At 64, my cardiologist says I have the arteries of a 25-year old, so I think it has helped me! Olive oil does not become "toxic" in baking (I've done my research) and we can't tell the difference in flavor, especially in these intensely chocolate brownies. I only had firm tofu, not silken, and they still turned out to be wonderful brownies. What I love most about using tofu for dessert is that it seems more filling (maybe it's the protein) so I don't tend to overdo dessert. Next time I will be sure to get silken tofu and probably up the cocoa. Thank you for this delicious recipe!

I too substituted a few things. I used coconut oil instead of olive oil. Used truvia baking mix sugar, and then to make it gluten free used almond flour, ground flaxseed, coconut flour and gluten free flour mix. I also added 1 egg and 1/4 cup soy milk because it was too dry.  A Good Base for a healthier brownie but I modified the recipe alot.

I tried this recipe in an attempt to find a tasty, healthier way to get my chocolate fix. I am not vegan or vegetarian. My opinion is that this recipe is far too much work to make it worth it for a non-vegan, and the family agreed after they saw the sink fill with dishes to make them. It should be noted that after trying a few tofu recipes, I've concluded that tofu's just not for me. On the plus side, it has plenty of chocolate to make up for tofu's notoriously bland flavor, just lacking something I can't put my finger on.
