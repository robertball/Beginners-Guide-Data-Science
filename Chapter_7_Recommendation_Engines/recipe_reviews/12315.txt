Not bad, but my grandma's rum pie is the best ever, so it's not fair to compare. The only change I would suggest is that you substitute pastuerized egg for the raw egg. Since the pie is not baked, you can risk Salmonella from the raw egg. (It is a myth that alcohol will kill bacteria!)Also I make mine with a chocolate crumb crust - yummy.

This was an excellent easy pie to make.  I used a Pillsbury crust, baked first.  My whole family liked it, but I thought the rum was too strong so I will cut it to 1/4 cup next time I make it.
