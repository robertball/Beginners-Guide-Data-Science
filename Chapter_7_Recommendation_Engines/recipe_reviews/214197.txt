Keni turned me on to this tonight, and I'm glad she did. I was skeptical because I enjoy swordfish as is, with just some lemon and s&p. But, I have to say, I was pleasantly  surprised!! I loved the flavors of the cucumber sauce and the bbq coated swordfish. The only thing I did different, and only because I did not have an onion, was that I used a shallot instead. I will be posting pics on my page tonight. Great recipe, awesome flavor, and it does not overpower that delicious swordfish flavor. Thanks Cyndi! (and keni, for the suggestion!)

I love this dish.  I like spicy food so I used a thai pepper and garlic chili sauce and it was great.

Wow! Hubby & I LOVED this! I left out the lemon zest & the addition of the lemon slice at the end. Unbelievably good! The cool cucumber sauce was incredible w/the spice of the swordfish. I'll definately be having this again-maybe even trying it on other fish too! Thanks Cyndi!!

Wonderful Recipe, Did tweak the marinade for our swordfish to our taste tonight. Followed the recipe for the cucumber sauce and it was perfect with the meaty fish!

For my marinade I used olive oil, and sesame oil, minced onion and garlic. Added Lemon Thyme, Herbes de Provence, a dash of Lemon Pepper seasoning, onion powder and salt and pepper.  Grilled for 4 minutes, then turned 45 degrees to enhance grill marks and cooked 2 minutes longer. Flipped and cooked another 2-3 minutes, covered with foil while I was getting the rest of our meal finished.  Served this with a Zucchini and Corn Medley and it was a perfect summer meal.

Excellent I used chili sauce with ginger. It was especially good because of the way we got the sword fish. My friend Alex ripped it out of a 5 meter long sharks mouth as he was gorging on it. True story. But that's  how we do it in New Zealand.

3 1/2 stars without the cucumber mix. I enjoyed the cucumber mix, but I didn't find it complemented swordfish.

I have wanted to make this for so long! I was in the fish market here in Naples and noticed they had beautiful swordfish steaks, so I picked up a few. I made this as written with the exception of adding a touch of honey to the chili sauce blend. My husband is not a cuke fan, so I served his cucumber sauce in a small cup on his plate to try. He used it all and finished the entire steak (it was a good size)! I'd say that sums it up!! I enjoyed it, too! Thanks Cyndi!!

This was really good and easy to prepare.  I was hoping for more spice but I guess the chili sauce I had wasn't enough.  Next time I will add heat.  
Served with roasted potatoes in a spicy aioli sauce which went well with the cooling cucumber sauce.
