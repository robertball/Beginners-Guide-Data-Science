These cookies are delicious.  Use a processer to get fine walnut crumbs.  A little messy to make but definitely worth it.

Very flavorful, however a little crumbly. Overall I would make again.

Delicious!  Made them for Christmas and everyone raved about them.  One person asked for the recipe which I e-mailed.
