Great cake! I do have one problem with it though.....my husband ate half of it a few hours after I made it. LOL I did change just one little thing about the recipe. I used a wooden spoon handle to make the holes instead of a fork. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Play around with this recipe, its lots of fun.  I made a chocolate cake mix (added a box of instant pudding and one egg) and baked in a 9x13.  Then I poured raspberry gelatin over the top, chilled, cut in half and filled the middle layer with raspberry jelly, and frosted with dark chocolate frosting.  Delicious!

I have made this cake for many years, but I changed things around and made it a delicious cake. I made a chocolate cake, with cherry jello, cherry pie filling and topped it with chocolate cool whip. But of course you have to like chocolate and cherry together, my family loves the two together. of course it is good also if you top it off with chopped pecans.

This great has gotten rave reviews every time I make it.  I use applesauce in place of oil for the cake and then use sugar free jello and sugar free cherry pie filling (hard to find sometimes, but it's out there) and sugar free Whip Topping.  AS far as cake goes it makes it kind of healthy.  I like to make cakes and my husaband says by far this is his most favorite!

Made this for the 4th of July, using blue jello to make it more patriotic. Looked and tasted awesome. Big hit with everyone. Used less whipped topping, about 3/4 of the tub, or less. 
Not big on whipped topping myself but I think next time I will just use an extra can of cherries as topping and omit the whipped topping.
Cant wait to try other flavors of jello and pie fillings.

Love it!! This cake is so light and delicious!! And the cherry pie filling is the wow factor. I think next time I might even use 2 cans of cherry pie filling.  This stands above any other poke cake I've ever made.  I only made one variation as tried by another reviewer.  I used the handle of a wooden spoon to poke the holes.  It made a huge difference.  Way more of the gelatin actually gets into the cake instead of running over and along the sides and just intensifies the flavor.  Very easy to make and was a big hit at the Memorial Day cookout.  I will be making this for years to come.

I made this for our 4th of July cookout, and it received rave reviews.  It was my first Poke Cake, and it was fantastic.  great recipe, easy to do. I used maraschino cherries and bluberries to create a flag cake, sticking with the holiday theme.  I also used cherry Jell-o to match the cherry pie filling.  I think you could probably use any flavor Jell-o and fruit topping and it would be just as good! A nice change from a traditional cake with buttercream frosting - great summer recipe.

This is really good! I like to mix lemon pudding mix with the whip topping for added flavor. If it is too gritty add a teaspoon or two of milk while mixing:) Then spread, VERY YUMMY!

My husband requested a poke cake because his mom used to make them for him.  I found this recipe and was a little put off because I thought it would be WAY too sweet!  But I was so wrong, it is SOOOOO good!  Try this, you won't be disappointed.

Amazing!!! I followed directions up to the Jello, then instead of topping with the cherry pie filling and cool whip, I refrigerated the cake until cool and topped with "cream cream cheese frosting" (from this site, make sure and read the first comment to make it right) and fresh cut strawberries. YUM!!!!! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I didn't use the pie filling only because it was a snow day here and I was working with what I had. I used a white cake mix, added green food coloring and then used strawberry Jello to make it more Christmas colors. The kids ate it up and loved how it looked. Next time I will use the pie filling I think though- I love that idea.

I made this using strawberry jello, then made strawberry pie filling for the top.  Used the recipe for cool whipped frosting from this site....HUGE hit at work today.  Chilled the whole cake overnight and it was perfect for a summer day!@!

I've made this recipe a few times and have always had rave reviews. To make things a bit healthier, I use light pie filling, sugar free gelatin, and fat free whipped topping. I have changed a few things-- more pie filling and a bit more whipped topping. Overall, though, a super recipe.

this cake is soooooo moist. I am so surprise that it is so easy to make. I love plain cake like this. Next time, I will try to put some peach inbetween the layers and also use peach jello.  I think the peach favor will compliment the cake so well.
Thanks for the recipes. I can almost eat the whole cake by myself.

This was so good and very easy to make! Im usually changing recipes from the get go but I did this one as is and I'm not disappointed at all! Initially, I was going to make a different version of this with strawberry jello and cheesecake pudding but then I saw this recipe and changed my mind and I'm so glad I did. We ate most of it last night after our Meatball Parmesan sandwiches that I made for dinner and everyone wanted round two for breakfast. How could I say no to that? It was even twice as deelish the second time around!!

We had high hopes for this cake and made it for a 4th of July-themed get together.  It was easy enough to make, but we did not care for the taste or consistency.  We used "berry blue" jello which smelled good and gave the cool red-white-blue combo we were going for, but in the final product it made the cake taste sort of medicinal.  Also, the cherries seemed to give the cake a mushy texture.  Just not a bit hit - unfortunately.  Maybe we'll try again with cherry flavored jello and skip the canned fruit.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it for the lake and it was a big hit.  I put red white and blue m and m's on it for the holiday.

OH my goodness what an amazing cake! My boyfriend thought it might be a good cake for his brother's bday so I found the recipe on BettyCrocker.com and whipped it up. I used a little less Cherry Jell-O then the recipe recommends. I also made up a nice creamy cherry sauce from my recipe book with the juice from a medium sized jar of marachino cherries. I added the sauce after leaving the jell-o covered cake in the fridge for most of the day, followed by a nice layer of whipped cream and then topped it with the marachino cherries themselves. It was AMAZING! two thumbs up and 5 stars for this one!! 

p.s- I am NOT a big fan of cherries to begin with, but even I loved this cake :)

I made it a double layer cake with 2 round 8 inch cake pans. After baking the cake and adding the jello I let it sit in the fridge overnight. In the morning, I trimmed the tops of the cake then added some of the cherry and whipped cream. Added the second layer and repeat. Added strawberries and blueberries to make it festive for the 4th of July.

Whoever gave this 5 stars has never had good cake.  The jello is unneccesary, it would be much better if you just allow the juices from the pie filling to run through the cake and then you don't have that artificial looking and tasting pink stripes.

I'd say this was pretty delish....I can see why one would mix this up using different cake mixes and jello flavors.  My only complaint is the cool whip had a hard time sticking to the pie filling.  I wonder if using homemade whipped cream or mixing in pudding with the cool whip would make it more substantial.

This cake is wonderful in the summer. it is fresh light and fruity. I used strawberry jello and then put fresh sliced strawberries on top instead of cherry filling. In the winter it makes a tastey treat with chocoalte cake, and then shaved chocolate on top.

I WAS searching for this thing called poke but it’s like sushi. We’re trying to cut the carbs and our young new neighbors suggested the stuff. Came across this wonderful cake instead. Never seen anything like it! Filled it with multiple colors/flavors of jell-o brand gelatin, NO COMPETITORS.

GREAT RESULTS!!  
The family scarfed it up and took the leftovers
When they left!!  Lucky I had tried a piece 
Easy and will make again .  I added a bit of van pudding powder to the frosting after reading others reviews.  That is some good cream cheese frosting too!

I took this to a neighborhood get together and it was a big hit!.  
I did add 4 eggs to the cake mix, with some vanilla and a pinch of salt, but that is just how I do cake mixes in general.  The recipe, I'm sure, would still be 5 stars without my substitutions.

I have made this cake twice for two clubs I am in. Got many compliments from both groups. I used a bought icing and no pie fillings, and everyone loved it. I made one a yellow cake with raspberry jello and the other a white cake with green jello for St. Patricks Day celebration.

This cake is easy to make & definitely a favorite! I use the back of a wooden spoon to make the holes & I think the cake needs to Be in the fridge long enough for the jello to set , 2-3 hrs . Enjoy !

We had half of white gluten free (gf) cake left from strawberry shortcake. It was a very dry cake. I used only half of raspberry jello mixture on the cake to add moisture to the gf cake for raspberry shortcake. I also used some of the frozen raspberries to used up the remaining jello mixture & put into individual dessert bowls.

I made it and loved it. I used German Chocolate cake mix and tried to pour white chocolate in the holes. It didn't work because I didn't thin it enough. Since I used a Bundt pan I put it onto a serving dish and poured Chocolate Almond Bark all over it. Ugliest cake ever, but what a treat for chocolate lovers. I took it to a house warming and got back the serving plate the next day. If one follows the recipe more closely than I it will make a great cake. Thanks for sharing the recipe .

I love this cake! I made a few changes. I used chocolate cake mix with cherry gelatin. For the topping I used chocolate pudding mixed with cool whip then I topped it with pecans. Yum! Makes you want to smack your momma!

I made a peach poke cake - using a white cake mix (cut out the oil and added peach flavoured sugar-free applesauce); the jello was sugar-free peach flavour; I didn't have any peach pie filling, so the topping was made by cooking a can of fruit cocktail packed in water with 2 tablespoons of stevia and 2 tablespoons of corn starch. We served it with a squirt of real whipped cream. YUM! I can't wait to try other flavours.

I made this with a chocolate cake mix, using the handle of a wooden spoon to poke the holes, and drizzled raspberry Jell-o over the warm cake.  Once it cooled, I iced it with a buttercream frosting, finishing off with a zig zag of luscious raspberry curd on top.  Picture perfect!  Exceptionally delicious!

This was simple to make and one of my guests loved it!  The rest found the cherries to be overwhelming and didn't care for it as much.  I have found few poke cakes that are actually great to eat- but this one, at least, had some flavor!  Very easy to do too...

Very good!  I baked just as directed and it turned out beautiful.
