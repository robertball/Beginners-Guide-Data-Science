Something is wrong with this recipe either wth the ingredients or the directions. I measured exactly but the batter was so thick it couldn't be poured. I decided to take some of the water and added it to the batter until the batter was pourable and then poured the batter in my cake dish. Afterwards I poured the remaining water on top of the cake batter. The taste was good but the ingredients/directions appear to be wrong.
