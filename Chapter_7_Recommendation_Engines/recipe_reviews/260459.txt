I had read the previous comment about the soup being bland so I added some extra Oregano and some Italian Seasoning (didnâ€™t have any Greek Seasoning). I added a tin of crushed tomatoes to give it some extra veg and then used Vegetable  Stock instead of water.
It still turned out bland.

Soup was bland - had to add Tapatio to make it better. Looking forward to others' ideas on how to make it tastier.
