This turned out great. I used a whole 8 oz. block of cream cheese and let the cream cheese get up to temp just a bit then folded in the other ingredients. The milk isn't really necessary if you plan on serving it right away. I served it with gingersnaps and sliced apples. Very good.

I made this for my Sister's baby shower. It was a hit i made it more as a sweet appetizer than a dessert but it can be used as either. i also added a drop of almond extract and it made just a little more delicious. Try this one its easy quick and cool!

I thought this dip was fabulous. Caviat: I orginally made this recipe as is and it was good but I felt like I wanted more of the cheesecake flavor and less of the whipped cream flavor. So I put in another block of cream cheese. Now I made this recipe for 40 people so my ratio was 2 blocks cream cheese (8 oz) one large tub of whipped cream 1/3 cup of milk (not adding more milk helped thicken it a bit) and added powdered (not granulated) sugar to taste. I found it had more of a cheesecake flavor this way but both ways were delicious depending on your tastes. PS--I made it as a fruit dip for a shower but it is very similar to what we use for Mississippi Mud Pie. Great!

Everyone really loved this dip but I didn't add the Cool Whip and I added 8 ounces of cream cheese instead of 4. It turned out better with a stronger 'cheesecake' flavor and it was just the right thickness.:D

I don't know what happened but when I tried this recipe it was too runny to be dipped. Also it did not taste like cheesecake at all. I'm not sure what happened?

I too used softened cream cheese. However the recipe cannot be correct. 3 oz of cream cheese was like runny Cool Whip. After adding the other 5 oz it was perfect! Im using it on graham crackers and strawberries.

Tasty recipe. Used cream cheese instead and added a little bit more vanilla and some orange juice.

I love this! It's not overly sweet it's just right. I took it to a "Potluck" at work and everyone RAVED about it. I served it with HoneyMaid Graham Sticks. Delicious!

I hate to agree with Tracy but my dip was very runny too. The only modification I made was I used 3 oz. of cream cheese instead of the Neufchatel. The taste was there it just wasn't very dip-like.

Tasted like cheesecake but was a little runny. Maybe the milk isn't necessary. I'll give it another try.

Too runny is right! I started with 3T of milk to 4 ounces of cream cheese and ended up having to add all the cream cheese I had--6 ounces--to get the consistency remotely correct. Definitely start with 1T of milk and then increase as necessary! ----I then added much less whipped topping than called for--approx. 1 cup--and found the taste tipped far toward "whipped cream" and away from "cheesecake". Add this ingredient too to taste or don't add at all. ----I won't use this recipe again; next time I'll just wing it for better results!

This dip is WONDERFUL! Using strawberries and pineapple to dip - is a perfect match. Make sure you use a hand mixer to blend well and get it fluffy. I added a little bit more vanilla too. I have given the recipe to lot of people already. Thanks!

Very good and light! For half of the milk I used french vanilla coffee creamer. I wanted to serve it with angel food cake but didn't have any. Used thawed pound cake cut in "fingers" to make dipping easier. Also great with strawberries.

This was delicious and easy to make! I made one small change by using homemade whip instead of store bought. I sprinkled the top of the dip with cinnamon before serving with apples. I would make this again.

It didn't really taste like cheesecake to me but it was still ok.
