This was super easy and very delicious. I used red peppers and added red onion.  I also cut the recipe in half for 4 meals. My husband who is not easy to impress commented these were some of the best kabobs he has seen and tasted. Easy cleanup a plus and great for a warm summer day.  We'll add these to our rotation.

Made for dinner tonight. Turned out awesome! When using bamboo skewers, make sure to soak for at least 30 minutes.
