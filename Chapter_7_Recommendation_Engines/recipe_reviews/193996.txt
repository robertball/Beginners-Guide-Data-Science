OK, I really wanted to like these muffins. They have healthy ingredients and are fun to make. But, the taste did not appeal to me and my family! I made the first batch, exactly as the recipe said and after one bite did not eat them. A couple of weeks later I thought I must have made an error somewhere, so darn if I didn't make them again. This is a lot of preparation work folks! This time they were a little dry ( I overcooked them to get to the point where an inserted toothpick came out clean) but the real problem was the clove flavor- way too strong. I would leave this out. Second thing- the pumpkin seeds are tough as nails! Why put these on there? Anyway, my very non-picky family didn't finish even one muffin. My opinon, I know some reviewers liked them.

This is a good muffin...definitely more like a breakfast muffin than a "treat" muffin.  Good, healthy ingredients.  Great with peanut butter on them!  I didn't make it exactly as stated, instead of adding nuts and raisins, I added a little more oatmeal.  Also, I didn't have plain yogurt, so I used vanilla and reduced the brown sugar and eliminated the vanilla extract.  Thanks!

I used whole wheat pastry flour in place of the AP, but kept everything else the same until I actually made the muffins, then I made them into large muffins, so I got 8 instead of 12 and I baked them for 20 minutes at 375.  The kitchen smelled so good and the muffins lived up to the smell.  Moist and almost guilt free.  Thanks, Ash we'll be having these many more times.

These muffins are delicious and healthy, but they do take some time to prepare.  I used a combination of mostly honey and part maple syrup to replace the refined sugar.  I also used wheat germ instead of flax seed meal because that's what I had in the cupboard.  I added slightly more yogurt, since some reviewers said that these muffins were too dry, and just slightly less cloves since some reviewers said they were too spicey.  They turned out perfectly, and I think they'd be good with even the full amount of cloves.

I'm madly in love with these!! My kids totally love them too! I made no changes whatsoever because they're amazing as is! If anyone's wondering, with *no extras* (nuts, seeds etc) they are only THREE WEIGHT WATCHER POINTS! Loaded with "filling foods", whole grains.. amazing :)

Very moist & delish!  I cut back brown sugar to 1/4C. & used vanilla yogurt.  No oil but extra T. of applesauce & pumpkin.  Thanks, love the flax added for health.

Really liked these muffins! They are easy to make, have healthy ingredients and have a fabulous texture! I didn't change a thing to the recipe except that I didn't put the pumpkin seeds on the top. One thing that this recipe should perhaps mention is that it does not work in paper muffin cups! The muffins totally stuck to the paper! Maybe it's just my cups...I was thrown off by the photo. Will make these again! Yum!

Wonderful--I think a muffin should be healthy, not a cupcake!  Love the whole grain content, and flavor is fabulous!  I did add a bit of coarse sugar to dress up the top.  Kaye, if you don't use the flax, you may want to add a bit more oil so they won't be dry!

I was out of molasses, so I used dark honey. I also cut back on the cloves a little, and did 1/3 C each of pepitas, walnuts, and regular raisins instead of 1/2 raisins 1/2 walnuts. ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR MUFFINS. Perfect combo of dense/fluffy. Moist, not too sweet, great (!!) texture. Ever wonder why butter exists? It exists to be put on these muffins. Ups the fat content, but wow. Even more spectacular, should be illegal. Worth the effort.

I baked these muffins with the following changes: reduced cloves to 1/4tsp, omitted brown sugar, used non-fat greek yougurt, increased apple sauce to 1/2c, added 1/2c pumpkin seeds into the dough instead of walnuts. The muffins turned out moderately moist, mildly sweet, slightly chewy, packed with good-for-you ingredients. I'm trying to feed my kids low sugar food, so these worked purfectly. I'll be baking them again. Thanks!

The ingredients in this muffin are really what enticed me to try them! They are very healthy but I found that there was not enough pumpkin or molasses flavour.  They also dont taste so good later on.  Amazing out of the oven though.  I may play around with the recipe again someday.

Turned out pretty good, actually, with the following changes:  Lite Vanilla yogurt instead of plain, Pumpkin pie FILLING instead of just the puree (has so many spices already in it, which I like, because there is never enough "spice" in any of these recipes), Used all rolled oats instead of flax seed, and I didn't put any oats or seeds on top.  Lastly, I cooked at 350 for 20 minutes then 400 for 6 more.  Yummy!

I did not change a thing except  for using all whole wheat flour. Excellent recipe with just the right amount of sweetness and spice.  Thank you Ash for submitting this recipe-definitely will be making it on a regular basis.

Didn't have to feel guilty about eating these. I added 2 tablespoons of wheat germ and sprinkled the top with flaxseed meal before baking and added the walnuts as suggested. A very good muffin that I will make again.

I like these muffins! They are the type that you don't feel like you're eating a cake - great breakfast muffin. I love that they don't have a ton of sugar. I didn't have flax, so I added more oats, and used fresh pumpkin from Halloween :) I also only had vanilla yogurt, and still added the vanilla essence, didn't seem to make much of a difference. They did turn out a little dry, next time I'll add more pumpkin. The molasses taste is just perfect!!

My kids didn't like it to spicy for them.  I like it, but it's not my favorite pumpkin muffins recipe.  I have a flax seed meal recipe for muffins that you can be creative and add any kind of fruits or/and vegetable, and I like that one better.

I made the following changes: used all whole wheat flour, omitted the brown sugar and added a ripe banana, replaced the canola oil with coconut oil, used full fat plain yogurt, substituted 3 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice for all the spices, and added 1/4 cup almond meal + 2 Tbs. wheat germ.  Delicious and healthy!

These are very moist and flavorful. I made a few substitutions. I had no applesauce so increased the amount of pumpkin to replace it and I don't use canola oil so had to use olive, thankfully the flavor didn't come through. I also halved the cloves and ginger due to personal preference and used the whole 6oz container of yogurt. I did not use the optional raisins but I added butterscotch chips to some of the batter and will definitely do that again. These didn't store well in an airtight container so I ended up adding a layer of paper towel and cracking the lid. Otherwise, they got very moist/sticky on top after a day or so.

My husband and I really like these muffins! I added a little allspice, an extra tablespoon of molasses, and swapped the oil and applesauce for 1/4 cup melted butter. I topped some of them with a little bit of cream cheese frosting to have some as more of a "dessert". Overall, the muffins by themselves aren't overly sweet, and that's a good thing! The sweetness and spices are perfect. It's a delicious muffin, that has some added benefits of being slightly more nutritious than most.

I love these muffins!! When they came out of the oven I thought they were going to be really dry but they are super moist! I used the whole can of pumpkin instead of just a cup, added a 1/2 cup extra of flour and oatmeal. I also added coconut. I left out the nuts. I forgot to add the oil but it didn't make a difference.

Yum! Swapped raisins for craisins and used Greek yogurt, and didn't have anything but olive oil. Next time I'd use melted butter or coconut oil. It's a big hit with the kids.

I used 5 T olive oil, no apple sauce and allspice instead of cloves. Delicious!

A nice mix of ingredients here.  Loved these muffins. BUT will not make the mistake of using paper liners in muffin tins...muffins stuck badly to liners.  Not sure if it was because of very little oil.  Delicious however. Thank you for this recipe.

I love the healthful ingredients of this muffin. I did want a little more whole wheat flour, so I used 1/2 WW and 1/2 all purpose, and added 1/2 cup more pumpkin to accommodate the dryness that comes with WW flour! I made half plain and 1/2 with dried cranberries and almonds. I do like my muffins on the sweeter side, so I preferred the ones with cranberries, they added just the right amount of sweetness. I'm sure that chocolate chips or raisins would also do the trick. I found the spice combo to be perfect, but I like things on the spicier side. Yum!

I only use unsweetened applesauce rather than oil whenever I bake. I doubled the amount of cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg because that is how we like it. Used sunflower seeds rather than nuts. DELISH and I am always throwing flax seed meal in everything so it was really finding a recipe that actually called for it.

These are good, but I'd rather have others.  I want the deeper pumpkin/molasses flavor of my regular pumpkin muffin recipe.

These were great! So moist! I didn't have the whole wheat flour, so used all white with some wheat germ. Also didn't have brown sugar, so had to use white. I used a fresh pumpkin for the puree - cut in in half, cleaned it out and microwaved it till soft, then scooped out the insides and used it for the puree. Plus used the seeds for the topping!
