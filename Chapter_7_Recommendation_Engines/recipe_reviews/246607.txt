I belong to a Farmer's and Artisan's Market.  I always take Pepper Jellies and a few baked goods.  Well, I made a double batch and it was not enough.  My regular customers have requested them.  The only complaint was from one person who said too much "foo foo", but everyone loved them.

I tried this recipe as a fun breakfast for my toddler son.  The concept sounded as if it would make for fun, colorful doughnut holes. The batter was easy and quick to mix up. However, when it came to frying the doughnut holes, I was disappointed in how they turned out. The outside was very crispy. The batter kept absorbing the oil with frying. It has a taste and texture closer to that of a hush puppy than a doughnut hole.

Looking for fun snacks for the grandkids on Halloween I transformed these into spider eggs. I made the donut holes as written and used only confectioners sugar in place of the glaze. The donut holes are highly addictive.
