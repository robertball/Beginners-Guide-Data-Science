Loved this recipe and it got rave reviews at a dinner party. The next time I made it (over the holidays), I changed lemon to orange peel, raisins to craisins and tossed in a 1/2 cup of pecans. It was great! My college age daughter likes me to have leftovers so she can munch it for breakfast the next day.

Only had lemon concentrate on hand so used pineapple juice and included pineapple chunks in salad. Light and refreshing. Happy family.

I didn't have any lemon to grate, so I substituted orange peel and it was way too bitter! I think I will leave out any grated peel if I make this again. I ended up washing the fruit off and just adding yogurt.

This was great! I took the advice of other reviewers and subtituted craisins and added pecans. Took it to a work party and everyone raved about it!

It was okay, but the taste was a little too puckery for my taste!

This is a great fruit salad!  The apples and carrots and raisins are a delicious combination, and the lemon dressing is very refreshing.
