This is a fabulous drink but the recipe forgot the lime.  I squeezed the juice from half a lime and then just left the lime in the glass.  I also used a little more carbonated water and simple syrup than the recipe called for.  This is a very refreshing drink, similar to a limeade.

An easy and delicious mojito, the brother of the mint julip.  Much better as there is no confectioner's sugar in it (simple syrup is so easy to make without the confectioner sugar taste...yuck).  A favorite with our guests!

I was disapointed when the recipe left out how much lime to use and I love lime!

I added the juice of 1/2 lime, doubled the carbonated water, mint, and simple syrup ... just for 1 serving.  The rum was too strong in this recipe ... that's all I could taste.  It's still not as good as Fridays ... which is the best if anyone has that recipe!

I infused the mint and some lime zest with the simple syrup. Very good results. I also added 1/4 lime to each drink.

Fantabulous recipe!  I love mojitos.
This was simple and easy, not to mention quite
refreshing!  Fresh mint as a garnish completes it!

Cheers!

As others have said, lime is a must.  Muddling some fresh fruit like blueberries along with the mint adds to the drink.
