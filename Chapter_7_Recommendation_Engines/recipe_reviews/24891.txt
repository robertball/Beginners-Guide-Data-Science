Easy, delicious and infinitely flexible.  I used apple cider vinegar and the cabernet/merlot wine I had and it was delicious.  I imagine rice vinegar would make it a little sweeter.  This would be great on a salad with blue cheese or Gorgonzola. I doubled the recipe and used in Cole Slaw.This is a keeper!

Always a plus to find a dressing this good and quick that I can make myself instead of buying bottled...I think I followed the recipe's proportions, but this turned out to be a little thin for my preference.  Easily remedied by adding a bit more mayo.  Taste was great - and I had a delicious mixed salad of romaine, radicchio, spinach, and feta cheese.

Thanks, Marbalet.  I was in a rush and with limited ingredients in stock.  A good, quick recipe, and I'm glad it's not too sweet!

This is a fantastic dressing.  I was looking for something specifically for cole slaw for salmon patty burgers.  All of the ingredients balance well together.  I was afraid it would be too tangy from the vinegar or green onions but the mayo mellows it all out. It has a wonderfully rich, creamy, smooth flavor.  It can definitely serve as a salad dressing. I think I might add avocado to it next time to have two different dressings!

The only thing I did differently was using Merlot rather than Zinfandel, but even if I had used the earthier Zin, this dressing ought to have been called a Green Onion dressing as that is, by far, the dominant element. That said, I'd DEFINITELY be making this again.
