Looking at the recipe ingredients, it didn't look like things that should go together well, however it all comes together very well.  Excellent taste, great use of vegetables.

This was really tasty. I changed the proportions of a lot of the ingredients - more asparagus, 4 cups of cauliflower and 1/4 cup of hazelnuts. I alos used a splash of chicken stock instead of the oil to reduce the calories a bit. There was plenty of sauce and it's always good for me to get in more veggies. I'll def make this again as a mexican veggie side dish. I served mine warm.

I've made this twice now. When I first tried it, I wasn't sure if I liked it or not,  but the more I ate, the more it grew on me. Make sure to chop the nuts before putting in the blender; the blender doesn't like chopping them from whole.

Thought the combination of ingredients sounded different and was happily surprised.  Good addition to any Mexican meal!

I modified this for a toddler "Dragons Love Tacos" lunch. I used one chopped red pepper,  12 ounces of frozen cauliflower florets and one can drained and rinsed of black beans. I sauteed the red pepper and cauliflower in olive oil until the cauliflower was tender. I sprinkled  a small amount of chili powder and a small amount of onion powder on the vegetables and added the black beans. I continued sauteing everything for about 3 minutes. I pulsed the sauteed vegetables in a cuisinart until everything was coarsely chopped. I served this with diced tomatoes, gouda  and mozzarella  cheeses and sour cream on warmed tortillas. This is an excellent lunch dish for a toddler and I will definitely make this again.

I wondered why there was no picture on this recipe.  It looks like vomit over veggies.  I didn't have hazelnuts, so I used almonds.  It was pretty good, I would make it again but use less dill; it was a bit overpowering.

We LOVED this, although I did find it necessary to add water to the sauce to make it process, and a small food processor is a much better tool than the blender for that part. We left out the celery because my son dislikes celery -- otherwise, this is a really interesting and subtle combination of flavors that works very well indeed for a side dish. We used it alongside Black Bean Lasagna, also from this site, and it was perfect. It works well to make the sauce in advance and microwave it back to warm while steaming the veggies. I used a half head of cauliflower and a bunch of asparagus. Good recipe!
