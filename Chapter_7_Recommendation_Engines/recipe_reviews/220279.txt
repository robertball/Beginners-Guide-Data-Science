My husband generally cringes at casseroles and absolutely loved this recipe.  Instead of canned cream of chicken soup, I made homemade...and added some celery salt.  I sauteed the chicken in minced garlic and used fresh cooked asparagus instead of canned.  I also doubled the amount of cream soup as not to have it dry out.  Delicious!!

I followed the recipe except for substituting fresh asparagus for canned.  After steaming the asparagus, I decided to use the full pound and it didn't seem like too much.  I didn't find the taste to be anything spectacular and the soup mixture was an unpleasant consistency; I'd say half a cup of milk should have been added.  Additionally, having the asparagus spears in the casserole made it messy to eat, because they were difficult to cut.  I would suggest cutting into smaller pieces.  I would also suggest putting the noodles back in the pot after draining them and then mixing in everything except the crackers (including 1/2 cup of milk and chopped asparagus).  Then pour it in the baking dish and put cracker crumbs on top.

I used the entire bag of egg noodles and I cubed the meat before browning. I used 2 cans of asparagus and 2 cans of mushrooms. Prepped the night before except for cracker topping. Extremely delicious!

I used broccoli instead of asparagus and minit rice instead of noodles cause that is what I had on hand.  It was delicious and I will try again using asparagus and noodles.

Maybe I didn’t follow the directions right. The 8x8 pan was way too small. I also think it needed to cook longer. Mine was actually a bit cool in the center so I threw it back in the oven. It’s a little messy to scoop out of the pan because of the noodles on the bottom. I used fresh steamed asparagus and they were still tough. BUT, the overall flavor was wonderful so I gave it a 4 out of 5.

We will definitely make this again, I. Made some changes...I added sour cream to noodle mixture, I also add d shredded cheddar cheese to each layer, and topped it off with panko and more cheese. Easy to prepare for a weeknight dinner.

My husband and I both thought this was delicious.  Our only change was to use fresh asparagus because it was in season.  Loved this and will be making this again!  Thank you for sharing!

I had a pound of asparagus, some broccoli and cooked chicken breast I had to use up. I found this recipe and used cream of chicken and cream of celery with about a half a cup of sour cream. It turned out very tasty and creamy. I will certainly make this again.

I was looking for a way to repurpose some homemade chicken noodle soup. This was perfect! Because I was starting w/precooked noodles & chicken, my prep was a little different. I cut up my asparagus & sauteed it in a pan w/onions, mushrooms, red peppers, butter, & garlic. Added the soups, followed by the noodles & chicken. I tasted it before deciding to go ahead & add the cheese. This was super creamy...maybe a little too creamy for us but my ratio could've been off using the leftovers. I'd like to try it w/a different cheese also, altho the cheddar was good! Eating leftovers for breakfast as I rate it & they're even better than lastnights dinner :)
