I searched out this recipe and made it for a friend of mine who's pregnant and craving spicy spinach dip without artichokes.  Unfortunately, she may have to wait for the second batch...this is REALLY GOOD!  If you want it mild, follow the recipe as written.  But if you want it kickinâ€™, try my modifications:  use only 1 tablespoon of oil, add 1 minced garlic clove to the onion, replace the tomatoes with 2 cans of Ro*tel AND keep the 1 can of diced chilies, use a blend of shredded cheeses (cheddar, monterey jack, pepper jack, colby, etc., whatever you choose), use enough black pepper and cayenne pepper to suit your taste (maybe 1/4 teaspoon of each), and add 1/4 teaspoon cumin. Finally, seal the deal with a dash or two of cajun seasoning.

This dip received rave reviews from my boyfriend and his other Monday Night Football watching friends.  I did make some suggested substitutions by other reviewers and others to try and make this a "healthier dip" (as if such a thing were possible!).  I substitued NO FAT Half and Half for the real stuff, Neufchatel Cheese for the cream cheese, and 2 (10 oz.) cans of Rotel Original diced Tomatoes and Green Chillies (drained) for the separate cans of tomatoes and diced chillies.  In addition, I only used 8 oz. of Monterey Jack.  Finally, I added 10 drops of Franks Red Hot Sauce to mixture to spice it up a little.  I used a 7 X 11-in glass baking pan....it looked great and tasted great even though these changes make it lower in fat.  Highly recommed this recipe!

Great recipe - I make it all the time.  I use 1 can of chiles and 1 can of spicy Rotel (drained) instead of tomatoes.  I use a full cup of half n half - otherwise the dip is too thick.

This was good, everyone seemed to enjoy it.  It was not really spicy, though.  A little time consuming, but had good flavor.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I have made this dip exactly as directed and it's a little bland but still very good.  I now skip the can of green chili's but use Rotel and add garlic, chili powder, cumin and a jalepeno if I have one.  I have used mont. jack and have used cheddar.  I think I like it with cheddar better.  I cut the spinach in half and it is plenty.  I love this dip, I make it more than any other and it  always gets gobbled up!

I made this over Thanksgiving with a few variations.  Instead of a regular onion, I sauteed one bunch of chopped green onions with a tiny bit of butter/margarine.  To save time, I used canned diced tomatoes with green chilis added and I used two cans.  I didn't use any salt or pepper, and I added a dollop of sour cream, and used about two cups of shredded cheese Mexican blend with four different cheeses.  I didn't add the half n half either.  The family LOVED it, however, the kids found it too spicy for their taste.  GREAT with tortilla chips.

Very good although I changed a few things. I did not have regular spinache so I used a box of frozen creamed spinache then reduced the milk to 1/2 cup. Also added some red pepper and cajun seasoning nice and spicy! Very easy to make.

This dip is yummy and great with nachos or crackers.  The recipe is easy to follow and there are no "crazy" ingredients that are hard to find. 

Highly reccommended; takes awhile to prepare but it is definitely worth it.

I've made this twice, once served hot and once cold, with great reviews both times! I've served it with chips AND bread.

The first time I made it, I used fresh spinach - much more time consuming, and I don't think it made a big difference.  This time, I substituted the whole peeled tomatoes with a can of diced fire-roasted, and I think that worked well.  Next time, I'll try adding garlic!

I found that stirring it again after it's been baked mixed everything together better, because the melted cream cheese combines more smoothly.

Great dip, I too used Ro'tel tomatoes with chili's, used a can and a half but you could easily use two cans.  I drained the juice and made sure the spinach was very dry also.  Added a few drops of Tabasco but next time I will double that.

This was pretty good, but the melted cheese tended to give it a bit of a lumpy, grainy texture.  I think next time I'll try substituting some american processed cheese for a smoother texture.  Nice flavor, though!

I made this for my Bunco party, and was asked for the recipe several times.   I loved that it was so easy to make, and actually made quite a bit.  The dip was delicious and spicy - a welcome change from the traditional spinach dip with the mayo, water chestnuts, etc.  I did substitute two cans of Rotel for the tomatoes and chilis.  I may use mild Rotel next time, depending on who's eating.  It was great, but definitely too spicy for kids.  Also used only 8 oz. of a Mexican shredded cheese blend and it was plenty.  I also added a few cloves of minced garlic.  The tiny bit I had leftover reheated nicely in the microwave the next day.  I'll definitely make this one again, probably sooner than later because I'm still craving it!

This went over great at our poker party last night - a game that I am absolutely terrible at as I can't bluff to save my life- but this recipe made me look like a great hostess! This puts plain ol' spinach dip to shame! We all loved the mexican twist to it! If you like it a little hotter, I would add some hot sauce. I used a little less half & half as I didn't want it to get too runny and a little more cheese. It went with butter crackers, tortilla chips AND toasted bread cubes! Will make this again and again! Thanks Holly!

I added a pinch of garlic to the saute'd onion.  I also only had cream cheese spread with chives on hand so I used that.  For a little more heat, I used Pepper Jack cheese.  Lastly I used 3/4 cup 1% milk, not half & half, and about 1/2 a tsp of corn starch to keep the milk making it too watery... This was cleaned out in seconds! Absolutely delicious!!!

We actually preferred this without cooking it but cooked, it's only fair, at best.  I may half the spinach next time.

I have made this recipe at least two or three times a month for the last year. It is the first thing requested and the first thing gone at every event. I have even had the executive chef for a nearby Hilton Hotel ask for the recipe. I have made only one change which is using a various cans of Rotel to ajust spiciness to the event and I sautee the onion with the Rotel until most juices have evaporated. Great Recipe.

This was fantastic and the leftovers froze really well.  I'd add one more can diced chiles next time since I like the flavor.  This will be on our standard picnic menu.

I thought this recipe was great.  I had it at our super bowl party and eveyone loved it.  Next time I think I am going to add something more to make it spicer, because it wasn't spicy at all.  There is a lot of spinach in it so if you don't care for a lot of spinach you might not put so much in.

For extra quickness, just use 1 can of diced tomatoes & green chilis (for example: "Ro'Tel)...  I love this dip!

My ol'man loved this!
"restaurant quality" he proclaimed!
Mission accomplished...
I added black olives and subbed 2% milk for half and half...upping the cheese to compensate...the mixed bags of shredded cheese are perfect.

YUMMMMMY!  Very good.  Can also be made with regular/skim milk instead of the cream.  Delish.

This is sooooo delicious! I have made this dip many times, and every time I get rave reviews about it. I pretty much follow the recipe, but would like to give a couple of hints - the spinach needs to be drained really, really well. Instead of using a can of whole tomatoes, I use a can of diced tomatoes (drained) as it is just easier.  I usually use a blended cheese mix that has a bit of kick to it. I don't add any salt.  Oh, and I have tried it with both onions and green onions, on separate occasions, and both were good. I really recommend this recipe to anyone. It's easy and doesn't take long to make.

This was awesome! Done this 3 X already for parties.... I have made this exactly as written and then also with a small can of diced jalenpenos(sp?)instead of the green chilis cuz I was out that day/with 2 cans of rotel instead of the tomatoes(I was out of the tomatoes) Sprinkle cumin on top (I am generous with it) and this goes from good to die for. There is never any leftovers.

Loved this...I skipped the half and half and substituted milk.  I also used cheddar cheese instead of monteray jack.  I would add a little more kick next time but all in all excellent and different.

This was a good dip that got cleaned up at our party, but I wouldn't really call it spicy.  I even used pepper jack cheese!  Used enough skim milk to get the consistency we wanted, instead of cream.  Baked up "bubbly" very quickly.

I have made this recipe several times and it has been eaten up every time.  I make it according to the recipe, except that I leave out the tomatoes (I'm not a huge tomato lover).  Instead, I put in some chopped jalapenos (saute them with the onions) or I use pepperjack cheese or both depending on how spicy I want it to be.  I also add garlic to taste.

Made this the first time exactly like the recipe.  Decided the tomatoes made it to sweet for a spicy Mexican dip.  Here is how I modifified it with RAVE reviews.  Took out the can of tomatoes, added instead : 3 cloves garlic, chopped  1 (7 ounce)can diced chilies, 1 (4 ounce) can diced jalapenos (to taste)  and pepper jack cheese. YUMMMY!!!!!!

this dip is amazing and is always the first to be eaten at parties! I am constantly giving out the recipe - very tasty! I use a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis instead of the can of whole tomatoes and can of chilis to make it easier. Will continue making this for a long time!

Excellent!  Everywhere I take this it vanishes in seconds and gets rave reviews! After making it several times I make a couple of revisions.. I saute the onions with garlic and red pepper and use Rotel to add some spice.  I also add in some sour cream and a little extra cheese.  Otherwise it's great, but the recipe as written isn't very spicy.

I think this dip has real potential.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was a bit bland.  I guess I didn't read other reviews (usually do) or I would have used rotel tomatos for more spice.  Either that or salsa, rather than plain tomatoes, would have spiced it up!  I liked the consistency as it was written, though.  Very easy, mixed it up the night before and baked it right before serving.  Thank you for the recipe, Holly, I will try this again!

This is excellent!  My husband does not like the texture of onions, so I used onion powder instead.  I also used 3 cloves of garlic minced and sauteed in the oil.  This recipe definitely needs the half and half in my opinion.

I substituted as advised for a can of Ro-tel tomato and chili. Had just enough kick in it. My husband had to do a taste test before I baked it. He loved it! It was a big hit at our little get-together that night. Quick, easy and can't wait to make it again!!

I used 1 can of hot Rotel instead of tomatoes and chiles.  I kept it hot in a crockpot and it went over very well.  My husband said it had too much spinach for his taste. I will make it again but cut down on the spinach.

The best dip I've ever made and very, very simple. My only variations were a small amount of garlic powder and a little hot sauce. I brought it to work and it was a huge success.

I LOVE this recipe.  I originally got it at a party about 13 years ago.  I make it often, people RAVE about it - even the ones that claim to hate spinach!  I do sub jalepenos for the chili peppers, use the pre-grated mexican cheese mix or somtimes use a mix of pepper jack and cheddar (I like the recipe a little spicier).  YUM!

I hate artichoves so was so happy to find this recipe.  But just like alot of people I use two cans of Rotel one spicy one not.  and I use the Mexican cheese that has four different kinds!  But this is delicious and really easy to make and always a good hit when I take it to functions!

Fantastic! Made this for a small group tonight - used about 5 oz cheddar jack and 5-6 oz pepper jack cheese (chiles aren't that "spicy" to me; added few dashes of green tobasco sauce, 2 cans Rotel w/chiles (per others sugg'ns,) lowfat crm cheese - will definitely make this again!

I made this for a Mexican themed dinner party of 4 people, everyone loved it! I cut the recipe in half and still had 1-1.5 cups left over. I did substitute regular Rotel instead of tomatoes and chilies separately to make things easier and I also used Mexican blend shredded cheese. I Personally wish it came out hotter, maybe next time I'll use "hot" Rotel instead of just regular? Either way this one is a crowd pleaser!

Excellent!  I cut the recipe in half and used a can of hot Rotel instead of the tomatoes and chilis.  It was hot - use the regular Rotel if you don't want it super spicy.  I'll be making this again.  Try it with the recipe for "Mall Pretzels" and dip them in this, yum!

For this recipe I used fresh jalepeno peppers instead of canned green chilis.  I also used half mozzarela cheese along with the jack, and added a clove of fresh garlic! It was great and added a bit of bite to it! Great!

This was pretty good, but was the only dip of about 5 that people at my party hardly touched.

I read some reviews and decided to add a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of plain tomatoes. (I didn't omit the can of green chiles).  This was a pretty good dip, the dish was cleaned out at the party I brought it to, and everybody complimented me on it.  Thanks!  This is getting 4 stars for now, but the next time I make it, I'm going to make a change or two (mainly add some heat and also maybe something to give it a little more creamy texture) and then I think it'll get 5 stars.

This is great dip!!!!!! I make many dips but none have ever been recieved as well as this one. My picky 15 year old nephew loved it as well as others.I used 1 and 1/2 cans of ro-tel diced tomatoes w/greenchiles insted of one can of whole tomatoes. I will add something to spice it up a little next time. Maybe crused red pepper flakes or a few shots of tabasco. A quality tortilla chip is a must.

This was excellent. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and omitted the half and half and added a dollop of sour cream. Next time I may even consider adding some diced pickled artichokes. Another thing I used was Del Monte's petite diced tomatoes with jalapenos...will make again and again!

We usually make the typical spinach artichoke dip and decided to try this one. Everyone loved it! I did listen to some others and made the following alterations:

-use half the spinach called for.
-omit the half and half

This recipe is amazing.  We doubled the tomato because that's our personal preference, but left everything else the same.  Our guests are actually unable to stop eating this, so make lots!

Made this for a dinner party and the guests ate so much of it no one had room for dinner.  It was fantastic.  I used shreded 4 cheese Mexican blend cheese but that was the only change I made.  I think the next time I'll probably just use a can of diced tomato and green chiles instead of the two separate cans of whole tomato and green chile.

I used original rotel, instead of the whole, peeled tomatoes as well and substituted with cream because that is what I had in my refrigerator.  I also asked my husband to get the Monterey Jack cheese, and he came back with a pre-shredded Monterey cheese blend.  Which that ended up being nice, because I was not looking forward to shredding cheese!  The recipe turned out delicious!  I highly recommend!  If you like spicy, I would highly recommend the original rotel!

I really hate leaving bad reviews and especially so on this one because it has so many good reviews already.  I did not care for this dip because there wasn't any really good flavor or seasonings in it.  I made the recipe exactly as written and in order to make it again I would have to "doctor" it up so much that I just feel like there are better recipes for this type of dip.

I've made this recipe several times and brought it to a bunch of parties.  Am about to make it again tonight for movie night. What I especially like is that the recipe is forgiving and it works well with modifications if you don't have all the ingredients on hand. For example, I only used the half & half once and usually substitute milk (only 1/2 cup) or nothing at all. We often have bags of shredded cheddar so I throw that in instead of jack cheese.  And I've made it with varying amounts of cream cheese too.  Rotel is a nice substitution as are diced tomatoes.  This is a great recipe base and perfect for a party.

Delicious!  I made this for a party and it was an absolute success.  The only things I changed were that I did not use half and half and used cheddar instead of jack cheese.  This recipe is a keeper for parties.

My initial opinion was this was pretty good after the first bite.  Then, I realized it was kind of bland and way too rich for my taste.  I will probably make it again for a large group of people and spice it up quite a bit.

Took this to a party and it was a bit hit. I put in some hotter chilies in addition to the green ones. I thought it was plenty spicy, husband wanted a bit more. Overall a keeper of a recipe!

Good, with recommended changes - eliminated half and half, increased tomatoes. Added hot sauce.  Sprinkled a little of the cheese on top for the last 15 minutes.  Strangely, it tasted better reheated the next day.

My first bite I thought "tastes just like Rotel and Velveeta" but let me tell you - the more I ate the more I realized what a classy dish this was and it was soo good and sooo addicting - my husband and I ate about 3/4 of the whole thing!! Wonderful. I cant wait to make this for my next gathering!

I served this last night at my Superbowl party and my friends loved it! I cut the spinach in half (as one of my friends is not a big fan) and it turned out great! I put in the whole can of chilis and it gave it a nice kick. Not too spicy but still very tasty.

Great basic recipe. I added chopped jalapeÃ±o peppers, garlic
and cumin to sautÃ©ed onions then baked as directed, making it very savory and flavorful with a spark. Next time I might try adding browned chorizo.

This was a big hit at a recent family gathering - thank goodness I made a extra!  I took advice from others and made a few changes:  1 used 3 cans Rotel (1 regular/2 mild); reduced fat cream cheese (12 oz), fat free Half & Half, 1/4 t each cumin, cayenne, and black pepper plus 2 shake Cajun seasoning.  I didn't increase the spinach or shredded cheese and it was still plenty even with the increased cream cheese and tomatoes.

This was amazing! The only thing I changed was I used a can of petite diced tomatoes with green chiles. I had the girls over and this was a huge hit. I served it with pita chips. Thanks for sharing!
