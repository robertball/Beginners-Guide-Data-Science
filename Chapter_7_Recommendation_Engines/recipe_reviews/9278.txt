Every Christmas our family could hardly wait for my mother to make her delicious fruitcake. I'm not a fan of fruitcake but I loved hers. Mom passed away a few months ago and her infamous fruitcake was mentioned more than once at her funeral.  We never thought we would be without our mom or her wonderful fruitcake.  I'd never made fruitcake before but decided to try baking some for my sister and brother for Christmas. When I inquired after Mom's recipe, no one could find it. After reading through 20+ fruitcake recipes I came upon "Mom's Fruitcake Recipe". What sold me was "no citrus fruits but lots of cherries, gum drops (my favorite), raisins, nuts and spices.  I immediately made a double batch. It tasted just like my mom's. Wonderful! That was three weeks ago and it's all gone. Today is 12/9/12 and I'm making a triple batch tonight. Everyone who has tasted it loved it.  Even those who didn't like fruitcake like this one. My sister, brother and I thank you so much, Sharon, for keeping our Mother's memory alive by sharing this recipe with us all.   

I did make a couple of changes.  I did hear my mom say once that she put applesauce in her fruitcake so I 
substituted applesauce for apple jelly and orange juice for brandy.

I made this recipe last year and it was great.  Made it again this year and it's only just come out of the oven.  I'm disappointed because I forgot to add the walnuts!  Just rereading the directions and it seems like there is not a direction to add the walnuts to the mix.  Can the recipe be amended to include this step so we don't forget next time?  What's a fruitcake without nuts?
