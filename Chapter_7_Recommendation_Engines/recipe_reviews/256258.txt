With the exception of using homemade plain Greek yogurt, dried cilantro, and cooking my own jasmati rice I followed the recipe. I LOVE this recipe! It's got such a robust taste and is perfectly delicious! I wasn't keen on the turkey being shredded as the shredded turkey almost turns mealy -not enough to knock it down, but enough to not use shredded turkey next time. Delicious recipe!!!

This was really good. Was nothing like traditional Indian Tikka Masala but overall neither my family nor I had any complaints. Just wish we had thought to have some naan bread on hand to go with it

Really tasty and easy. I used fat free half and half instead of the cream and served this with brown rice once and naan bread another meal.  This was very saucy so you would be able to add more turkey or chicken to this easily
