This was very good and easy to make.  I used a mix of dried fruits that were diced (apples, apricots, raisins, peaches, and pears).  I was a little concerned with how thick my batter was when I was making it; I had to scoop out spoonfuls and spread them around my pan.  It came out great though and was really good sliced and buttered then broiled for a couple minutes.  I will make this again for sure.

I love this recipe.  I used a mixture of sultana raisins, dried cranberries and apricots.  Great texture and flavour.
I also dusted it with icing sugar to finish it off. Pretty and delicious.
Thanks Brooke!

I made this tonight for a St. Patrick's Day Party.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I think that the bake time is much too long though.  The bread was very hard after baking for this long.  I should have checked it earlier, but my oven is pretty true to temperatures and recipes.  Next time I will check the bread sooner.  The taste was nice though, a mix between a fruit cake and a spice bread.

I was frankly surprised at how good this was.  I made it for a St. Pat's day party (held a few days before it) and it was devoured with oohs and aahs. Instead of sticking objects in the bottom, I made little fortune-cookie like strips of paper, wrote "predictions" on them and rolled them up, putting them in the hole in the center of the cake. Everyone was given one of these with each serving, and it was great fun reading them aloud one at at time.

This is now a regular in my cook book! I made it for a class for Samhein (Celtic Halloween) , and it was a big hit. I was cheap and used only golden raisins for my class, but any dried fruit mixture is great, I love dates personally. The batter is ridiculously thick, so I don't sqeeze excess moisture out of the fruit, just run off the worst of it, and I have to press it into the pan to bake, but it turns out beautifully.

I made this March 17th 2009, and unfortunately it came out really hard, even inside behind the crust, and we couldnt eat that day but we put in a whole apple sliced up and placed it and the cake cut in slices into a air tight container for the night. By the next day it was edible and the whole family enjoyed it.  The appearance of the cake looked ok, but I think it overcooked.  I cooked it right according to the directions, and baked it for an hour, at the temp it asked for, but I think that perhaps for our oven, that at that temp it was too much. Since they want another one today (the other is all gone), I will make another and bake for 45 minutes, not the whole hour, and check it and that may work for us.  It was a good cake, the only thing is we couldnt eat it day one because it was hard and dry.  The apple really changed all that.  I have to wonder if the original recipe was for the celsius temp and that maybe when it was converted to farenheit (if it was) that that has something to do with it or if it was just our oven is a bit different. Allowing for these differences, I gave it four stars, not the highest rating.

It is eaten as a bread, not a cake and is a regular sight at the breakfast table! Excellent toasted - but only on one-side of course!

This was delicious!I was looking for an Irish dessert that didn't have alcohol in it to take to a church function. This was a hit!  I did make a few changes, to accommodate the ingredients I had on hand. I used dried blueberries, cranberries and apricots for the fruit, Celestial Seasonings Madagascar Red Vanilla for the tea, and I didn't have lemon marmalade, so I used orange fig preserves.   The batter appeared to be a bit dry, and I was a little worried, but the cake itself turned out moist and delicious. Just make sure you sort of push the batter down in the pan and flatten it.   I got many requests for the recipe. This is a definite keeper!

This was delicious. I was a little hesitant at first. Soaking the fruit in tea was little odd but it came out really good. Would make a great morning cake.

My batter didn't pour -was crumbly, so added water. Next time I'll reduce flour and save the soaking tea to moisten if needed!  Glad to have read the 'over cooked' reviews, as it is still baking and I'll check @ 45 min.

Tasty, but very heavy.  This is a VERY dense cake.  As other reviewers said, you have to spoon the batter into the pan...there is no pouring this one.  I let the cake cool for at least two hours, but it still stuck in the pan.  I put some hot water in my sink and sat the pan in it - the cake loosened right up and came out without a problem.

I made this for our St. Pattys dinner... For dessert. I did the recipe exact except I could not find lemon marmalade, so I used orange. I cooked this in a bundt pan on 325convection  for 40 minutes. I chose a fruit mix with apples, pears, apricots, plums. TASTY. After it cooled I put a vanilla glaze on top. We all enjoyed it, even the kids. It even works for breakfast...

Only reason I didn't rate as 5 stars is that the instructions are not complete.  Do NOT discard the tea, as I did initially.  It came out very dry, and I read other versions of barmbrack to see what I did wrong.  Be sure to add the tea back into the cake mix.

Made this for a lunch celebration honoring Martin Luther King and all nations to honor my Irish roots. Bread could have been very dry but I squuezed as little liquid from fruit as I could-dough was very dry crumble when mixed, I added 1/2 cup hot cooled tea and baked 45 minutes.

As to oven temperature - you really have to watch a cake before the time stated because ovens differ. I have rarely, in many, many years of baking, found a recipe that was dead on.   Also, ovens differ too.    350 is good for this cake and it also gives the celcius heat for people in Europe. I lower the heat by 25 degrees after about 30 mins and do so with most cakes that have fruit.   Thanks (after all the above) for a lovely and different barmbrack.

Thank you for this lovely recipe.  I made it for a St Patrick's Day party.  I followed the directions pretty much with the exception of adding a 1/2 tsp cardamom (just cuz I like it). I used pineapple-apricot jam because I couldn't find lemon marmalade. I used black raisins, dried apricots and cranberries.  Not sure if the jam and raisins made it a bit too sweet.  I'll probably cut the sugar to 1 cup next time, and try orange marmalade. I do want to make this again.  It's a keeper!

As I was putting this together I got worried that there was no fat in it and kept checking the recipe to see if I made a mistake! Then it was soooo thick I knew something had to be wrong, but I went ahead and baked it.....UNBELIEVABLE. It is rich and delicious and I will make it again and again. Thumbs up from the whole family. And with 7 of us there is always someone who doesn't like what I have made.

Added a small amount of orange juice in order to incorporate the dry ingredient.  Also grease  pan generously .  Save tea as  suggested by others to use if needed.

After I soaked the fruit in Irish breakfast tea  I added a cup of the tea back into the batter. I didn't have lemon marmalade but I did use orange. Toasting this until the outside is crisp and spreading it with some good, salty, Irish butter makes it the best breakfast bread Ever!

First, my mods -- I find that it's better to not drain the tea from the fruit and just add it all to the wet mix, otherwise the bread comes out too dry.  Leave the tea in, and it comes out PERFECT.  Other minor changes: I used no-sugar-added apricot preserves in place of the marmalade, and Trader Joe's pumpkin spice blend instead of cinnamon/nutmeg.  I've made it without orange zest too (forgot to buy an orange last time) and it still comes out delicious.  I'm lucky enough to have a bulk foods place nearby so I can buy just enough dried fruit for this recipe.  I use dried apricots, raisin medley, craisins, dried date bits, dried apples, and dried cherries.  And of course the tea I use for the fruit is Irish Breakfast blend, double-strength.
Overall: Excellent and easy.  I was looking for traditional Irish recipes to get more in touch with my Irish heritage and found this one.  A lot of Barmbrack recipes call for yeast and I'm terrible with yeast breads so I tried this one.  Very pleased with the results.  It's now a Halloween/Samhain tradition for me!

I guess I took the directions a little too literally.  It says to 'gently squeeze out excess tea'. I drained it & then squeezed out the tea  w/a tea towel.  The batter was awfully dry & the finished product  worse.  If I ever try it again I wont 'squeeze out the excess tea' but just let it drain through a colander. Sad to waste all those ingredients!

Like many other reviewers, I found this extremely dry, hardly like a cake batter at all -- perhaps I was overenthusiastic in draining/squeezing the fruit.  I added a cup of milk and baked for only 45 minutes; it still came out a little dry and chewy, but quite delicious.  I too would advise skipping the draining step, and just putting the tea in along with the fruit.  (My Irish-American wife, inviting every kind of ethnic stereotype, is suggesting soaking it in whiskey.  Will do!)

A wonderful idea but had to make some changes, that's why only a 3 stars.
Used 1 cup of candied citrus in dices, 2/3 cup of dry cranberries and 1 1/2 cup of raisins. 
The dough was the problem and needed some "improvements" : I added a little pot of jam (any flavour, mine was red berries), 1/2 glass of whisky and 1 cup of melted margarine. Without those the cake would have been VERY dry !
I made it for an Irish Dance class. I made 30 "cookies" with these proportions (so reduced cooking time) and had hidden 5 dry beans and 3 coins. I had made a board explaining the ones who will get the coin will be rich this year and the ones with the beans will fall in love or/and have a baby. The funniest part was that the coins ended with the ladies and the beans to the gents !!! It was a hit and lots of fun !

I made some undoubtedly blasphemous substitutions to the recipe, but still quite liked it. Veganized by replacing the egg with 1/3 cup of applesauce; used a weird lemon tea concoction of jam-like consistency instead of marmalade; gave up on the rest of the orange zest when my grater only spat out ~1/4 teaspoon after all my elbow grease. Didn't squeeze out the tea water, as some people suggested - I probably wouldn't have been able to mix it otherwise! The final product has a pretty nice consistency, though the lemon tea mix gives it a slightly strange aftertaste. I'm sure if I had stuck to marmalade, it would be even better!
