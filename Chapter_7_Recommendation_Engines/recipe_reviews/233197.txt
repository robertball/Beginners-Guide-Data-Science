Tried this cake along with another cake for my sons birthday. I wasn't sure how it would go over and when I told people what kind of cake it was they looked at me funny :) But all the adults enjoyed it. They were surprised that it tasted so good :) It is a tasty cake, very moist. I did use the full amount of chipotle sauce and it had a slight kick to me, but I'm a wimp when it comes to the heat.
