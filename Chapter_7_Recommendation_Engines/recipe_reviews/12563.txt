Made this when I had some friends over. I am not the cooking type but it was really easy to follow and it turned out lovely. I made it without the tomato and I used grated soya cheese instead of the feta cheese. It turned out really well and my guests enjoyed it. I will be definately making it again. Next time I might add some crushed garlic in with the spinach.

I made some serious modifications but it was a huge hit at a birthday party I had. 1)I left out the tomato sauce 2) I added garlic 3) I layered it in a casserole dish rather than made the little pockets.

This was super good with some modifications, the other reviewer is right in that it'd be quite bland as written.

Our additions were some garlic and a tomatillo (a little beastie that looks like a small green tomato wrapped in lettuce leaves.  uncooked, it tastes quite sour, but once cooked, it has just a little bite).

It was OK.  The feta cheese it too rich for me and with only spinach, mushrooms and tomato sauce there wasn't much flavor.
