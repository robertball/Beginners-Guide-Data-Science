I have never made such a recipe before. It tasted quite interesting. It was sort of like the store bought puff pastry egg breakfast sandwiches. I am not super familiar with working with crescent rolls. My suggestion is to go for the name brand. That is the only one I worked with. I had someone else pick up the ingredients with this and they had gotten the store brand. I had a heck of a time getting the rolls apart and even had to re-shape them. The filling is not enough for the crescents. It has to be added in between each rolled crescent making a perfect circle. This works find as long as it is baked on parchment paper. The cheese holds the ingredients together. All of the flavors go well together. Thanks!

Super delicious and easy to make! I've never had corned beef hash (hubby has), so this was a great recipe to try it out with. This was so flavorful, and all the layers of flavors went so well together. I also discovered that I really like corned beef hash, lol! I will definitely be making this again~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

This dish was easy and made a fun presentation. It was under-filled because my husband ate half of the egg filling. I had had to stop in the middle of making this, because I had a quick errand to do, and he didnâ€™t know. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this with a few changes, I had Italian sausage to use so I cooked that up and crumbled it instead of hash. I also added mushrooms to the egg mixture and served with marinara sauce and a dab of sour cream. Excellent!

This was easy enough to make, and tastes delicious! I don't cook very often, so it was nice to have a recipe that spelled it out for me. I burnt it a little (oops), but it still didn't taste bad. Means there was room for error calculated into this. My boyfriend just said this was one of the best breakfast foods he's ever eaten.

The taste was great but I did have problems trying to roll the crescents. I'm not very experienced with them but the recipe was still very tasty!

so I don't measure when I cook it's all to taste. I used a glass dish and overlapped 7 croissants and filled the bottom with the eighth one. fresh minced garlic Cajun seasoning pepper and milk in seven eggs. I used half a red pepper half an onion and two jalapenos. I put the hash down covered it in cheese then put the egg mixture on top more cheese and then connected the croissant triangles in top baked for twenty minutes.
