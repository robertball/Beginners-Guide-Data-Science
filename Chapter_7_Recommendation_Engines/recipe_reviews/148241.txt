Daaaang, these are good! I bought a bunch of those "Spam Singles" really cheaply a while ago, and this recipe is perfect for them. The only thing I do differently is to make the sandwiches with sourdough bread - I really dislike wheat bread with grilled cheese. Oh, and red onion is a must. This is quickly becoming one of my favorite lunchtime eats. Thanks!

very good! I like tomatoes, sweet onions and cheddar cheese; but when you add the SPAM it is so tasty and gives this sandwich an interesting flavor! We are pleasantly surprised at the twist this gives to the normal "grilled cheese" sandwiches we all know. I used Maui onions, thinly sliced, and its sweetness that it is known for balanced out with the salty SPAM. I also used honey mustard, not spicy mustard. I also spread on a little mayo because it just isn't the same without it. With the ooey gooey melted cheddar cheese, grilled salty SPAM and sweet Maui onions this was ONO (delicious)! SPAM is actually a versatile luncheon meat and can be used in a lot of dishes. This sandwich went nicely with the, "Basil Tomato Soup," also from this website.

Delish!! I sauteed the onions first and browned the spam in a skillet.
