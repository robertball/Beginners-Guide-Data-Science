I have been making these for years and have them ready at all times to use.  I put them into canning jars and they last for a very long time in the refrigerator.....if you don't eat them too quickly.

Here's an update to my review! I did this excellent peppers recipe again last night and wow, it was very tasty!  Here's the rest of my review from May 2, 2007: Excellent!  I wanted to make an exclamation mark for a dinner party I hosted for a friend and thought of marinated peppers.  My parents and girlfriend were also at the dinner party and safe to say, everyone enjoyed this dish.  Since then, my girlfriend has prepared the marinade for the peppers on numerous occasions for our bbq's this past summer.

This is great.  And very versatile.  The first time I made it, it was pretty much as per the recipe.  I liked it on sandwiches with cream cheese (vegetarian).  The 2nd time I used peppers, onions (red, white and green), zucchini and roma tomatoes.  Seems to keep well in the fridge too.

EXCELLENT!!  If you like roasted peppers, you will love this!  I used a red, yellow and orange pepper, no green.  I cut the oil down to 3 T. and increased the basil and parsley.  The only change I would make next time is to cut the oil further, probably down to 2 tablespoons.  I used these peppers in two different ways.  Hubs grilled some spicy German sausages, which I plated over a bed of sautéed spinach and topped them with the marinated peppers.  To use the leftover peppers I made them into bruschetta.  I put a little olive oil on both sides of some baguette slices and toasted them under the broiler, again on both sides.  I drained the room temperature peppers well, and tossed them with a shredded provolone/mozzarella blend.  I topped the baguette slices with the pepper/cheese mixture and put a little extra cheese on top.  Broiled for just a few minutes (watch them closely).  YUM!!  I’ll be making this one again and soon!  Thank you, Angela!

Fantastic! I just made this recipe with dried parsley and oregano since I didn't have any fresh, I also sliced a red onion, brushed it with olive oil and grilled the slices in a grill pan, cut the slices in half and tossed with the peppers. I have tasted it already and cant wait till hubby gets home to serve dinner. Will be serving this tonight, cold, with grilled salmon and toasted homemade sourdough bread. I like that this can be made ahead as we entertain often and will be a great dish for entertaining!

Excellent recipe except for the amount of olive oil. I used only 2 Tbs. and it was more than enough. I also used dried basil and parsely because didn't have fresh on hand.

My roommates loved it and so did I! I served over toasted slices of French bread and it worked perfectly to absorb the extra olive oil/vinegar mix.

I made the original recipie, and the second time I made some changes: 2 garlic cloves
1 teaspoon of italian seasoning (instead the prasley and basil)
I put the garlic in a small saucepan, with the oil in thin slices to heat until you smell the garlic. Turn of the heat, left until is cooler at room temp., and then mix all the ingredients. I love!!! with bagels and cream cheese you don't need meat to be happy!!

I served these on an antipasto salad. Everyone raved.  I followed the recipe and made them two days in advance and topped the salad with them. The multiple colored peppers make for a beautiful presentation. Will definitely make again

I've been looking for a recipe like this for a some years.  The very Italian parents of one of my friends use to make this from the peppers in their garden.  Each time I was served these my mouth salivated.  I did add too much basil (no fault of the recipe), didn't think you could do that, but next time I will use less.  Thxxxxxxx a million times for this most memorable recipe and for bringing such nice memories back into my life.

Very good.  I used three red peppers as I needed to use them up.  I might add more marinade next time, as I served with baugette slices and 'ran out' of marinade to sop up with the bread.  I mopped the bread in the marinade, then put a red pepper slice, thin slices of fresh basil, and parmesan on each bread slice.

I liked it, but thought it was a bit tangy and there was way too much oil (even with me only putting in half the amount listed).

A great recipe... very excellent flavor with the combination of herbs but the roasted peppers are truly the highlight of this dish!! I did also use dry herbs and increase the amount I added... I also let mine set for a few hours for the flavors to really develop... glad I gave it a try thanks for submitting

This was wonderful all by itself. I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I used red wine vinegar. I also used more garlic just to suit my taste. We had this the next day over pasta with olives, tomatoes and a honey lemon sauce- so delicious. Thanks!

Please do not rinse the peppers after removing the scorched skin.
Rinsing removes that wonderful roasted flavor. Just keep wiping your hands with a  paper towel to remove the skins and seeds.

These are really yummy! I had to use dried herbs, but otherwise I made as written. I just had them as a side by themselves, but they'd go great on sandwiches or in a pasta dish, too.

I liked this.. my boyfriend didn't (althou he's hard to get to each vegis at all). Tasted great on toasted sour dough (dijon mustard was good with it in moderation as well). Will probably make again.. just not for my boyfriend :P

Thought they were kinda blah!!  Quite a bit of work for the reward!  If I decide to do this again, I will add Serrano or jalapeno peppers to the mix!

I've only had this recipe for 2 weeks and have made it 3 times.  You know it's good when your teenagers love it.  It is such a good, healthy side dish for any main course.  I served it with a lasagna dinner and the vinegary taste really balanced the richness of the pasta.  Great!!

These peppers are amazing! This is my second time making them I double the recipe. The only adjustment I made was adding a little more balsamic vinegar and just a few red pa

Excellent

If you want less oil.  Use  kraft Italian dressing to substitute some of the oil.

I already use this recipe few times. I really like this recipe.
When I make this, I’m totally following directions, and my only addition,I use significantly more crushed garlic, and I usually use a lot less of olive oil, about 1,5 tablespoons for 5 bell peppers. This recipe is easy to make and very versatile to use.
You can eat those delicious marinated peppers: by itself or add to meat dishes as side or use it for sandwiches or in a salad or something else you’d like.

This is delicious. I didn't have any basil, but used a little rosemary and oregano along with the parsley.  I also added a little lemon juice, and used a little less olive oil.

I have been making marinated peppers for over 40 years now. I like to put chopped onion in mine don't cook them. Put the onion in at the last minute so they will still have some crunch to them.

This tasty but not as amazing as a lot of the reviews seemed to make it out. A little bland. The only chnage I made was to cut the oil in half (it seemed like a lot) and I added 2 more peppers because it didn't seem like enough to serve my pepper loving family of 4. 
The dressing was good but it needed something to punch up the flavor. Maybe I should marinate overnight? Next time I will double the garlic and basil and maybe add a pinch of cayenne pepper. As is, we added a lot of salt....

Delicious!!  I added cilantro and a little jalapeño. I also took others advice and cut back to 2 Tbs on the oil not 1/4 cup. I think you can add all kinds of herbs depending on what you like or are eating it with. We used this on fish tacos. My family raved over this and I couldn't keep them out of the bowl while I was making it.
