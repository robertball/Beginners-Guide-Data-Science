Put the egg in to begin with, skip the microwave, double the dry ingredients, use coconut oil, vanilla almond milk vs cream, cook like a crepe in a 10" frypan on about 4/10 heat, cut in quarters to turn, makes 'em stronger, more like a pancake, easier to work with.

These were very thin and had little crater-like indentations. My batter thickened in the microwave at the 2 minute mark. I used 2 T. batter per pancake which made 4 in all. I could not cook them on medium high, or they would have burned. The time frame for cooking each pancake was less as well. All that said, let's face it, strawberries and syrup make anything much more palatable. In the end, breakfast was tasty and low-carb and will hold me well till lunch.

I think it comes out as half pancake and half omelette. Nice change.

These cakes were to thin to turn without breaking.  Nothing like what I was looking for in a "pancake". The taste of egg was overpowering. My family didn't finish them, and requested I try another recipe.

I didn't have all of the ingredients. So I substituted. I used wheat flour, almond milk, half and half, coconut oil and almond extract. After I microwaved, it was lumpy almost like oatmeal. They looked great but tasted horrible. Watery. I topped with fruit and whipped cream which helped tremendously. I may try them again with some changes.
