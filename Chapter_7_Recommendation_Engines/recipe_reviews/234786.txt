I used love this recipe, but made a few changes. Instead of using processed potatoes, I used yams and changed the cheese to jalapeño havarti.  It was fabulous. Thanks for posting the recipe!

I liked this.  I pretty much followed the recipe except I forgot to buy the pepper.  It still came out good.  The scallions are a nice touch

I loved it!  The only adjustments I'd make next time:  would likely be better with real mashed potatoes.  Also bacon would be an excellent addition.

Great idea but I made some changes as well. I made homemade mashed potatoes, stuffed the mushrooms and then put them on the grill for 15 minutes. Turned out awesome!

I used this recipe as a base and tailored it to my taste. Used Bob Evans potatoes, salmon, Thai chilis, and parmesan cheese since that's what I had. Delicious.

I will definitely make it again.  My husband loves Potatoes & I love Mushrooms...what more can I say?  I believe  in following someone's recipe exactly for the first time & then make my changes  the next time!  Therefore no changes, but, one addition...more cheese!  They were delicious. Thank you for sharing...
