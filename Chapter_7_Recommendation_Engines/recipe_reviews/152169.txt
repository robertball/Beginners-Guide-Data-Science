Since I had 6 cups of white pumpkin I used it while keeping all the other ingredients the same. The recipe was easy to follow. The two hours of mellowing time helped the flavors blend. I'm don't like that the butter has resolidified in tiny little particles but otherwise this is a great recipe!

Followed recipe except I substituted a tsp of pumpkin pie spice in place of the other spices. Came out great texture great flavour although I wish it had more pow.

It is easy and works well over fruit pound cake or ice cream. I added a little salt to offset all the sweet of the sugar. I didn't have maple syrup so I used brown sugar which is made with maple syrup anyway. I'll surely make this again.

I followed the recipe as written except instead of white sugar I used raw pure cane sugar. LOVED IT!! I was very happy to find a recipe I can use pumpkin besides pumpkin pie. Thank you for posting this recipe.
