My husband has recently become vegan and I am allergic to soy, so finding a good seitan recipe was a necessity. After looking at many recipes on line and in cook books, I decided to try this one. There was only one ingredient I didn't already have in my cupboard and it looked in line with other recipes I saw. My husband and I loved it. We ate it solo just as a snack (it really tastes that yummy), we made pan fried coconut seitan balls, taco filling, and used the left over bits and broth for a soup...so it is also versatile and able to take on flavors of many types of cuisine. My only complaint is that I should have doubled the recipe!

I am a young chef and newly appointed vegan chef (can't stand working with meat). A vegan friend of mine has always made great Seitan and have asked him repeatedly to teach me how to make it. Now that I have found this amazing recipe, I am going to shock him. I can't believe how simple it is! Thanks. 
My question is how do you mould it into a shape when cooking?

I live over in Europe, and I don't have access to nutritional yeast and Bragg's Aminos.  I followed the recipe as best as I could, substituting a veggie broth powder and soy sauce.  I am very happy with the results.  When I would make a different recipe back in the states it would crumble into bits.  This held together very well.  I found the dough easy to work with, and reshaped it after it was chilled to get the right log-look.  Something I learned from my grandmother:  the same spices you put into the broth, you put into the gluten steak dough.  You can play around with it as much as you like.  I remember once my grandma made a mistake and fried the steaks in a chili oil, and they were the most delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

Tried making this twice.  Both times, it has turned into spongy, rubbery garbage. No offense to your recipe; obviously you and plenty of other folks have found success with this; I guess I just failed. I've tried 4 seitan recipes in the past 3 months, and I'm at my wit's end; all 6 test batches have turned out horribly. And, not to toot my own horn, but I will: I'm a really good cook. But obviously I really really suck at seitan lol. Can you (recipe writer) or SOMEONE out there send me the secret tip? Is there something I'm missing? Is it in the kneading? Does the water need to remain below/above a certain temperature (I've kept it at a relatively steady simmer, but sometimes it bubbles too much and other times it stalls for a few minutes with no bubbles)? I've tasted restaurant seitan and it's AMAZING. All the recipes I've tried (including this one--no offense) have been absolutely DISASTROUS.

I made the following changes: I used 1/2 tsp Better Than  Bouillon  No Chicken Base in 1/2c water for the vegetable broth.  I also used Coconut Aminos and added 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning. I formed it into a 8-9 inch log, wrapped tightly in aluminum foil, and steamed for an hour. This makes for a more dense seitan, which I prefer. Slices nicely for sandwiches...I can dice and use in a mock chicken salad. I can also bread it a fry it in oil for a 'fried meat' type dish. SO easy!

I made the recipe with the ingredients above, used my stand mixer to knead it for 5 minutes on lowest setting, put the pieces in the broth mixture that had been brought to a boil then taken down to a 2 on my electric stove (as high as I could go without having any bubbles in the liquid) before I put the pieces in. Cooked covered for 70 minutes, checking every 20 or so to make sure it didn't stick. Turned out excellent! Other attempts at cooking in a pot had "blubbery" results, this was perfectly firm. Flavor is a little bland, but that can easily be remedied next time. I was so pleased with the texture! More like "tofurkey" than the seitan I get a lot of times in thai restaurants.  I feel like I have finally perfected the pot cooking technique (as opposed to steaming or baking). Thanks!!

Tried this a few times and perfected it a little. Instead of 4 cups of water i added 2 and then 6 cups of vegetable broth, otherwise the broth is tasteless. Then doubled the nutritional yeast to make it tastier. I was also looking for something that was soy free when i found this recipe so replaced the Amino with coconut amino and instead of  the tamari i added a few drops of Worcestershire sauce. Came out sooooo good! I Def recommend to try it this way.

I love using this recipe. Whenever I make Seitan I use this recipe as a base. I always change it up, depending on the flavor I'm going for, and it always works. There are a few tweeks here and there that I do. I also always bake it when I'm finished for about 35 minutes on 375 (depending on how much I make). I flip it at about 25 minutes. This gives it a slightly harder exterior and REALLY lends itself to tasting more like meat. :)

I didn't have any liquid aminos or tamari, so I sub'd low sodium soy sauce for those parts. I also didn't have vegetable broth, so I winged it (pun forthcoming) with some better-than-bullion chicken stock. I also didn't want to wait an hour for it to cook, so I rocked it full blast in the electronic pressure cooker for 20 minutes with a lot less liquid than called for and then hit the quick release. The broth tasted oddly similar to matzo ball soup.

Really easy, very tasty! Strangely Meaty. I didn't have tamari so I doubled up the soy sauce. I may try to cook it in the slow cooker like a roast. The wheat gluten and nutritional yeast I buy at my local health food store or Bobs Red Mill on-line.

Meat eaters complimented and enjoyed this. Made dough into little dumplings (balls) instead of patties. Cooked and served in boiled water with added vegetable stock so it was like soupy dumplings in vegetable soup. I have been asked to pass on this recipe by a couple of meat eaters and it has been complimented by an accomplished cook who ate this also.  One consumer said 'I don't know what this is but it's really tasty'. Another consumer said it was a vegetarian dish that didn't taste of cardboard which was really nice. Lots of compliments all round for this dish.

love this recipe!  I am kicking myself right now for not finding this wonderful meat alternative recipe sooner.  the only change I made was only using 1/2 tbsp of olive oil and using low sodium soy sauce since I didn't have any tamari sauce.  these came out delicious and with a great texture.

First I would say if you don't have nutritional yeast, cut your liquids down in the initial mixture. Mine turned out not quite as tough as I have made it in the past (or as I would like it to be). Overall, a solid recipe to play with and build off of! I will give it another go with less liquid until I can grab some NY.

I didn’t have tamari or aminos, so I did 2 Tbs soy sauce and 2 Tbs water  in the dough to sub for the aminos and just left out the tamari in the broth.  I recommend seasoning the seitan with garlic powder and cumin as well as browning it in the oven or a pan for a really meaty flavor!
————————
I wanted to turn the broth into a soup, so while the patties were simmering in the broth, I chopped up half  an onion and 2 celery sticks and threw them in the broth. After the seitan had cooked for an hour, I put it in the oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 min to brown. Then I cut it into little cubes and seasoned it with cumin and garlic powder and put it back in the broth along with some peas, green beans, and chopped carrots. I served it with ramen noodles and it made for a very hearty meal!

I did not have the liquid aminos so I substituted soy sauce. I also doubled the recipe, and it turned out great. The recipe I normally make calls for baking the seitan dough instead of boiling. Baking creates a denser, less juicy final product. This seitan is kind of spongy and wet when done, but my husband and kids LOVED it! My son even went back for seconds.

Ive never tasted or made seitan before, but god if this was a bad recipe, then it was friggin delish! Soo so tasty. I cut it up and fried it with some hoisin then served on top of a dish of ramen, which I made using the broth from the seitan. Only comment was that it was really salty as a meal, so I think i need to invest in some low salt soy sauce!

I made it with dough ingredients only without cooking broth because I decided to bake it instead of boil it. I had it baked for 90 minutes. It tastes OK for two following reasons: 1. Excessively sodium taste from soy and chicken broth. 2. Too dry...... I will make again next time to make sure I eliminate soy and use water instead and perhaps put a little extra water to make it tastes less salty and more moisture.

Side note to my review: the nutrition info for this is assuming you actually ingest all that veggie broth so the actual sodium content is nowhere close to as scary as what reads here.

i made the basic recipe with added spices.  i sliced my dough into cutlets instead of patty shapes.....then once the cutlets were done, i pan grilled with peppercorns and salt to get a real steak flavor. you must knead this dough for 10-15 minutes or it will be awful and stringy and gummy.  the kneading develops the dough and gives it the texture you want.

I made some minor changes to the recipe and ended up with mushy, watery seitan that did not hold together.  It was still edible, of course.  I used a cup of broth and some Marmite instead of 1/2 cup broth and 1/4 cup yeast liquid.  I also substituted coconut oil for the olive oil, garlic powder for diced garlic, and added some curry powder. 

Also, I question whether it is necessary to use a whole quart of broth to cook it in.  This results in leftover broth, but one could use that for something.  I plan on trying this again, and using less broth for both steps.

The texture is great but it is overly salty. I used my own unsalted veg stock and didn't add any salt other than what is in the other ingredients and holy guacamole, it is salty.

Just made this. For those new to seitan when your done kneading it and dividing it makes 3 burger-sized patties that GROW to TRIPLE their size in the broth. I didn't expect that and made a double batch (hopefully it freezes well).  I used garlic past and umami past, came out delish in my seitan marsala!

I can see many different uses for this Seitan. The flavor was great, Texture was where I expected it to be. Firm but chewy. (If your Vegan you don't expect things to have that firm meat texture) Nor do I want it. Very exciting to find this recipe. Thank You.

This was my first time making seitan and so glad I chose this recipe!! I omitted the aminos since I didn't have any and added the equivalent in broth instead. I also added a bit more nooch and addedsome spices to the cooking broth mix . I think the texture is great - I fried it in a pan afterwards for a few minutes to get some crisp. The flavour is honestly delicious; I'm restraining myself from eating the rest tonight. This will be a recurring recipe for me, thanks!!

This was wonderful!  After making it, I ate 2/3 of the recipe right out of the pot, so I only had one patty left! So I made ANOTHER batch, doubled the recipe, doubled the garlic, and since I'm not vegan, I used organic low sodium chicken broth instead of the veggie broth and added 1 T turmeric to make 6 patties--and now I can share them with my boyfriend this time around. This was fantastic. I won't be buying it in the store now. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my newly vegetarian daughter and it was delicious. The previous recipe I tried was bland and too "wheaty" tasting. I subbed decreased sodium soy sauce for the liquid aminos and tamari because I didn't have the other ingredients. I also followed other reviewer's advice and added 2 cloves minced garlic and 1 tsp poultry seasoning. I made sure to simmer, not boil, the dough to keep it from getting a mushy texture. I sprinkled with additional poultry seasoning baked the patties at 375 degrees in the oven for 15 minutes to crisp it up. It turned out really great with an amazing meaty texture. I'm not even a vegetarian and I was sampling it right off the pan. Great recipes and wonderful non-soy meat alternative. I will be making this again and again.

I followed about 95% of the instructions for the dough & the results were pretty bad. My dough could BARELY form a (very tough) ball; I had to lean my whole body weight onto my arm to knead it, but I went along bc it was my 1st time making seitan. After boiling, I cut into it & the center was visibly a different shade, so I boiled it for another 2 hrs. Same. The seitan turned out tough, so I could only slice thinly for use in sandwiches. Remade today with 1 extra cup of broth & the dough turned out much more pliable. Let's see how it goes!

Like most others have said, this is delicious! I was hesitant to make seitan because the recipes I had seen seemed pretty involved. This one is SO easy! I'll definitely be making it once a week.

I followed the recipe as written except that I allowed the dough to rest for 5 minutes after the initial kneading, and then did a little more kneading. This markedly increased the chewiness/ texture (needed a knife to cut the dough into 3 pieces). I also added just a dash of Turmeric. Awesome.

Great recipe. Instead of the chopped garlic, I used a Chunky Garlic Stir In Paste from a tube....more intense flavor. The main thing for me was the texture and this texture is perfect...firm (not rubbery) and I could slice it as thin as you can get ham sliced in a deli, without it falling apart. This is my GO TO recipe from now on. I had tried quiet a few recipes/ingredients and cooking methods and this one is the best by far. I wish I would have doubled it! Can't wait to try this in a "beef" and broccoli stir fry recipe I just found.

This was my first ever attempt at making this new weird food called seitan! I am amazed at how well it came out and how easy it is to make. It really is just so meaty and satisfying, ill just have to try and stop myself eating it everyday now! Seems very versatile as well.

I was surprised that making sriram was not that difficult. I made this with the help of my vegan neighbor who previously bought hers permade.  We did a double batch. I used half to make vegan sloppy joes http://www.myvegancookbook.com/recipes/recipe.php?id=81 and she took the other half home. Would make again.

This was my first time making Seitan. I was so nervous! I looked up many recipes. This seemed the easiest. It worked! I doubled the recipe and used off brand vegetable broth. It turned out very firm. I boiled three logs instead of 1/2" patties. Then I sliced one log into small pieces for stir fry, one into strips for fajita night, and the third I think I'll freeze. Cheers!

I've made this several times and it always comes out great! I use 2/3 for jerky and then bake the other ball in small cubes to put in a soup (add a ton of water to the left over liquid and some ramen noodles).

I needed to use soy sauce, other than that I followed the instructions.

You bet I will make it again! I will use it for sandwiches, cut into cubes for stir fries, etc.

I am very happy!

Taste and texture are great! Seems a few people are having issues with the texture. To fix this, I recommend skipping this method entirely. Instead, throw all liquid ingredients into a food processor, then add the gluten. Processor for a couple minutes until it forms a ball and you see strings of gluten. Take it out, roll it in plastic wrap like a loaf, then roll that in some foil. Make sure there’s no opening. Steam this loaf for about an hour. Let it cool completely.

Not too shabby!  First time I've ever made seitan.  I didn't use the oil and I cut up a whole onion, sauteed first and put that in the broth for the wheat meat to bask it.  It definitely made a difference.. tasted that well and I liked it!  I smashed all 3 of mine down into flat pork chops and I just finished off the first with nothing else to go with it!  It's going to be great when I add it to some of my favorite dishes.  Easy peasy and yummy!

I've made seitan a bunch of times before and this is my husbands favorite recipe. I cut everything up in smaller pieces before cooking so I could portion out easier. I doubled the recipe and added a bunch of additional seasonings. To enhance flavor more. Like Italian seasoning, garlic and onion powder, thyme, rosemary. Yeah lots of flavor packed in there!
