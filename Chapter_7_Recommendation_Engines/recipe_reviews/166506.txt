A good dish that could have been even better. I agree with Lynda Q that the amount of paprika was overkill. Less would be better and none better yet. Otherwise an interesting and tasty dish, largely because of the exotic flavor of saffron. Pairing the shrimp with the gnocchi was unexpected and delicious.

Hearty, healthy, and very comforting dish. Really enjoyed this. If you let the onions get a deep brown by slowly caramelizing them, the flavor is wonderful. Could have used more saffron. We doubled it and still needed a little more, but we like a punch of flavor, so start small and add what you need.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I wanted to like this more, but I found the paprika overpowering, but not in a flavorful way. Maybe the paprika I used was too old, so if I try this again, I would use a little or none, and substitute something a little spicier in its place.

I'm giving this a 4-star rating; mainly because we didn't care for the brown sugar taste with the other flavors.  Next time I'm simply going to sautee the onions and mushrooms in butter until soft, then add the other ingredients.  The other ingredients created such a burst of flavors in the mouth!  I had freshly grated parm/regianno cheese we used at the table and I added just a little extra basil.  Wow!

Really nice and easy recipe with a lot of flavor.  As others, I left out the paprika and added more saffron to get the full flavor of this wonderful spice.  I used yogurt in lieu of the sour cream I didn't have, straining it through a cheesecloth for 30 minutes to remove excess water.  Also, after cooking the shrimp, which only takes a few minutes, I removed them from the liquid they had produced and reduced it before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Will absolutely make again!

This was great! Reminds me a lot of the chicken paprikish recipe I frequently make. I didn't include the saffron, which I'm sure would have added a nice flavor, but wasn't necessary.  I added a little bit more brown sugar than specified since I'm a fan of carmelized anything, and it resulted in a bit more of a tangy, sweet aftertaste that I thought really complemented the dish well. A great quick, delicious recipe! I served three with this recipe, and probably could have bulked it up a little bit next time. Everyone wanted seconds!

Lots of flavor in this dish! I couldn's stop eating! When I was cooking, i left out teh mushrooms and the saffron (only because it is so expensive) but it still turned out great! If you put a little more sour cream in it, the sauce will thicken as it stands, and turns out really delicious. Thanks for the great recipie!

In a word...Fantastic! I omitted the salt and made my own gnocchi. This is a real treat. I was very impressed with it.

I love gnocchi, it's fun to eat!  Pretty good flavor.  I used hungarian paprika, 2 pinches of saffron (i love saffron), added asparagus, and didn't have any basil. Plus the store only had 70-pack of smaller shrimp which I think is better so you can have a shrimp in every bite, yum.

I loved this, with a couple modifications.  I used 2.5T butter when carmelizing the onions.  1T wasn't cutting it.  I used a bag of 90 small cooked shrimp, and the ratio was perfect.  Based on other comments, I put only a pinch of paprika in, and would do it the same way again next time.  Fantastic recipe, and would be great on any other kind of pasta as well!

Delicious recipe! I don't like mushrooms so I left those out. I would do this again perhaps with spinach. Delicious, easy, and light. This might become part of our regular rotation!

Very delicious. Very rich. Also, easy to make. I used a mandolin to slice my onions, which made the process very quick and easy.

This was great. I increased the ingredients for the sauce a little bit. I also added some spinach which was tasty but not necessary for next time. I only added a little bit of paprika but think more would be fine. The sauce was very stroganoffish. Took some time to caramelize the onions, etc. but the flavor is worth it.

Just made this recipe! It was delicious! Thank you! I used prawns instead of shrimp, but that probably didn't make that much of a difference. I took the advice of other reviewers and used less paprika, but found that it could have used more saffron.

excellent flavor, easy to make. Only changes are don't cook the shrimp as long, and I used a cast iron skillet which retains heat so I'll use a lower heat next time. It turned out a little dry.

I have made this several times and have loved it every time!  It is super simple, it's the timing that can be tricky.  I put the water for the gnocchi on to boil first, then saute the onion and after a few minutes, add 1-2 zucchinis cut into cubes, then remove from the pan after less than 5 more minutes. Right as the water begins to boil for the gnocchi, I add the shrimp to the skillet, and then put the gnocchi in the pot to boil.  After the shrimp is pink, I add the zucchini & onions (sometimes I don't use the mushrooms in the recipe) and the sour cream, plus cracked black pepper, and by then the gnocchi is ready to add.  Once it's stirred together, I plate it, sprinkle it with the parmesan, and serve immediately.  Soooo good - and I have to use dried basil, but it still tastes delicious!  Thank you so much for a wonderful, easy, tasty recipe!

I pair this with the sweet potato gnocchi recipes on here and I've made this a few times with some slight modifications with what is on hand. I used no-fat yogurt for the sour cream and since I had no saffron so I pumped up the paprika. Maybe my taste buds are weird compared to some of the other reviews but I found the increased pop from the spice very pleasant and the added smokiness a nice compliment to the sweet potato gnocchi.

Loved this dish.  Unfortunately I didn't have saffron or mushrooms - but this was still great without them!  I added all of the paprika and didn't think it was too overpowering?  I will be making this again....

Mmmm, amazing. I made homemade gnocchi off of the Gnocchi I recipe. added a little less paprika and a little extra saffron. Oh so good. I almost wanted something crunchy in the recipe. Do not skimp on the parmesean cheese though, the saltiness makes the dish!

Very Good the whole family of 8 loved it (except my 5 year old who wont eat anything) I doubled the recipe and used half Shrimp half Scallops...also made my own Gnocchi (not recomended unless you have lots of time and patience) and used more Saffron and less paprika as other posts have suggested... very good and will definately make again It was perfect for our Valentine's Day Family dinner.

I followed this recipe exactly and loved it! My husband raved and raved about how delicious it was. I made gnocchi by hand using the Gnocchi I recipe from this site. The onions smell delicious while they carmelize and it just gets better from there! One thing I would do differently is wait to add the gnocchi to the boiling water until after the shrimp is cooked and is simmering with the remaining ingredients. That timing will eliminate one extra dirty bowl and also make sure that the gnocci remains nice and hot when added to the shrimp mixture. Very tasty - will make again!

I didn't make any changes since it was my first time.  It was delicious! The one thing I will change the next time I make it will be a little more saffron and a little more sour cream.

Love this dish!  Being Hungarian, the paprika was far from overwhelming.  I make this every two weeks or so.  So simple, yet lovely flavors.

I wish I could find saffron, store did not have it.  Used an italian seasoning blend in its place.  Decadent and easy.  I would say to properly caramelize the onions you would need to cook for north of 10 minutes, we probably did 15+.

I enjoyed the recipe but I guess I don’t know how to make gnocchi that well. I’ve only made it with soup one time and it was really smoochy. With all the veggies I put in it just had a different taste than expected. I followed the directions and wasn’t as expected, but everything else was delicious.

Not crazy about these little potato things. They were terribly doughy.  After cooking them, I fried them in olive oil. That helped a little. I added Italian chicken sausage. That helped too but I don't think I'll make it again.

I didn't quite love it but it could be that I left out an ingredient in the name! Other reviews said it was just as good without the saffron but I'll have to make it again to find out. My BF accidentally tossed the all the feta for the salad on top and his actually was pretty dang good, go figure!

Following the comments of the other reviews, I cut the paprika in half.  Great flavour but the combination of the shrimp and gnocchi I wasn't thrilled with, I will try this recipe again maybe with clams.

I really enjoyed this but my husband wasn't so sure.  I didn't have saffron so used turmeric instead.  Also used yogurt instead of sour cream.

Followed the recipe except used a little more saffron and smoked paprika.  I sautéed the mushrooms, onion, brown sugar and added some fresh spinach. Then I added cooked, peeled deveined shrimp, I used 1.25lbs of small (approx 40-60 ct) and added the shrimp directly to the mixture.  I stirred together smoked paprika, saffron, and sour cream, then added to shrimp mix. Stirred in gnocchi, topped with basil and cheese.  Great flavor! Smoked paprika and saffron was fantastic.

This was AMAZING! The only thing I did different was I forgot to pull out the shrimp to let it thaw so I had to cook it frozen. I ended up letting the resulting juices reduce with a bit of cooking Marsala wine. Future changes are a complete removal of the saffron as it does nothing in the dinner, adding more paprika, and double or tripling the entire recipe.

I made an AllRecipes account just to rate this gem. Turned out awesome! Skipped the mushrooms and added a chopped garlic clove. I also added some cream since I wanted a saucier dish. I used smoked paprika (the best!) and turmeric instead of saffron (sorry, I'm poor).

Tom liked the gnocchi but not the sauce.  I agree!!

Mmm... It was sooo good!  I was missing some ingredients, so I made a few substitutions. In place of sour cream, I used about 1/4-1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream. ( Guesstimation! I rarely measure when cooking this type of meal.) In place of butter, I used olive oil. I seasoned everything to taste, and for me that means I am heavy on the seasonings. In addition to the what was provided in the ingredient list, I added lots of garlic powder. Regarding the basil, instead of sprinkling the basil on top of the dish, I mixed it with the ingredients in step 3. Mushrooms were omitted because I did not have any on hand.  Salt was omitted too.

I thought this was very good!! I messed up two times on the recipe and still loved it :-) I added garlic to the onion and mushrooms and it added a wonderful flovor... This recipe could be changed and added too a lot if you wanted and you could still have a delicious dish!!

i have made this recipe many times, and i LOVE it! everything is good about it. i have used scallops instead of shrimp, which is also very good. just don't skimp on the fresh mushrooms (canned just doesn't cut it). and don't leave out the saffron.  the cook time is longer than 15 minutes b/c you need to caramelize the onions, and that is something you can't rush by turning up the heat.  if i could rate this recipe higher, i would!! yummy, yummy, yummy!!

Unbelievably good sauce!  Substituted chili powder for saffron and left out mushrooms (didn't have any).  Still awesome!!
