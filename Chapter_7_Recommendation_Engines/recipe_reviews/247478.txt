I didn't measure the mint, but it was a good cup or cup and half, followed the recipe and is execellent. Using it for Mojito, one shot mint simple syrup, one jigger rum, one cup club soda, and ice. Yep, that's what I'm talking about. Very good! Thanks!

Got tons of mint to use up? Make this. I made a double batch, freezing one in ice cube trays. I used the rest to make iced drinks on a hot day. I just left a pitcher in the fridge and anyone can just add a tbsp or so to a glass of tea or sparkling water as they wish. Truly simple and easy to make and renders a drink even more refreshing. Thank you for the recipe.

Perfect for mojitos.   
Question though, if kept refrigerated, why is it only good for up to a month?   Does this actually spoil or lose taste???

A French press works perfectly for steeping and straining the mint leaves. The syrup is great for hot or cold tea. Makes delicious Mint Juleps. Add lime juice for spectacular Mojitos.

This was perfect for Mojitos.  I did use a little more mint, and less sugar because I don't like Mojitos too sweet.   This recipe works well.

I made this mint syrup and added it to my tea.  It was fantastic.
