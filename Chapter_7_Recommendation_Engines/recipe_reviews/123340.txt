This recipe is deeeelicious!! I make it without the pimientos though. It's perfect for that leftover chicken that you don't want to dry out by reheating in the microwave! A+++

Very, very good. Have tried a couple diff recipes for Chicken Divan but as my husband said, "this is the best!"  I cooked cubed chicken w/ old bay seasoning, garlic powder and salt in my cast iron skillet and then simmered fresh broc until it was tender. I used 1 can cream of mushroom & 1 can of cream of chicken.  Turned out wonderful!!

For the most part it was good and kid friendly. I found the sauce too be too thick it just sat on top of the dish did not blend with other ingredients, so I ended up adding some milk in with the mayo mixture to make it a creamy sauce. I used cream of mushroom since I had it on hand. I added the suggested curry powder but I think next time I will try ground mustard seed with garlic salt and pepper. I think it will compliment this dish well. I will make again!

Pretty good and fast! 2 of my 3 picky children ate it so I will definitely make it again.  I added some minced onion, jack cheese and fried onions on top.  I used 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 mayo as suggested by others.  I also added 1/2 milk because I think I had more brocolli and chicken than called for.  Delish!!

rave reviews from the family.  i added a little garlic and curry to the chicken.  also, one 1/2 with cheese and one 1/2 without just to find out the different flavors.  everyone liked the "no cheese" side better!

Fast and excellent!  Try it without changing a thing! I've also tried adding uncooked rice to the dish, then chicken and placed the frozen broccoli around the chick. and smothered it all in the sauce.  Then I cover the dish and bake it. It is simply divan!

Just what the doctor ordered Bertille! Quick and yum being the operative words here, this recipe delivered! As always, I added in more seasonings, but other than that, it was great as is. 
Thank you so much!

I'm writing to update my review since I've made this several times now. Changes: 1) Only use sour cream in place of mayo. 2) 1 can cream of chick, 1 of cream of mushroom. 3) Add about 1/3 cup of milk. I mix everything together, reserving some cheese to top with. I use whatever cheese we are currently stocking. Some times I add the bread crumbs, some times I don't. They really don't add much. But the sour cream makes it. We tried doing half sour cream, half mayo, and the all sour cream was much better.

I made this 2 years ago for my sister and have been hearing rave reviews about it from her ever since.  I never tried it when I originally made it, but figured if it was so good that she still talks about it after 2 years, it was worth a shot. My mother and I each could not get down more than a few bites.  All you can taste is the mayonnaise.  Will NEVER make again, even if my sister (who now has all the leftovers) asks for it.

Made exactly as the original recipe, only omitting the pimentos.  The kids loved it and asked for more!  When that happens, we know we have a winner!

Wow, what a yummy dinner.  I don't usually make the time to review the recipes I make but this one deserves a great review.  I only had 1 can of cream of chicken so I substituted a can of cheddar cheese soup.  Plus I had read that it is kind of thick so I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup milk so it would be easier to mix.  I used Italian bread crumbs I had on hand and this dish is amazing.  It is satisfying, tasty, and one that I will make again and again for my family and I will make it for pot-lucks.

Quick & Easy. Satisfying on a cold winter night and Kids loved it.  Consider putting left over rice in with the soup mixture.  It will be more filling...or serve the divan over cooked rice.
We added just a sprinkle of curry powder to add a little more flavor to the casserole. We also subbed the 1 c of mayo with 1/2 c sour cream and 1/2 c milk to cut down on the calories and the tanginess of mayo.  All was great!

Good recipe, however you could really taste the mayonaise (for those who don't like mayo); and I think the soup mixture would be a lot better if you added some milk to make it creamier, and allowed it to blend with the broccoli and chicken instead of just sitting on top of the chicken and broccoli, like someone else said. Still, it's fast and easy and tastes really good!

We really liked this casserole. I did make a few changes. I added 2 cups of shredded sharp Cheddar cheese because we love cheese. I also didn't add the dry bread crumbs and butter to the top (I am low carbing it and didn't need the bread crumbs), or the sliced pimento (don't like them). Will make again! Quick, Easy, Tasty Weeknight Supper.

This was delicious and pretty easy to make. We used fresh broccoli because that's just our preference, also used fresh lemon juice. The sauce looked a little thick, so I added a little skim milk to it just to make it more spreadable. My husband loved it, and we will definitely make this one again.

We loved this recipe!  I used Cheese Nips instead of butter crackers, and I think I would put even more Cheese Nips next time!  I used cheese soup and cr. of chicken soup, and left out the shredded cheddar cheese.  Not too cheesy.  Just right!!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and his roommate with a few modifications to suit their health-conscious tastes: 98% fat free cream of chicken soup, low-fat mayo and reduced fat cheddar cheese.  Also, I seasoned the chicken with the Bavarian Herbs mix from Penzey's Spices.  Both the guys loved the recipe (although they both mainly subsist on cereal, so this was a big step up from their usual fare), and it was easy enough that I'll make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

YUM!  I made this for my 7 year old's birthday and used 2- 16oz bags of broccoli, because he really likes broccoli.  I didn't realize until I was in the middle of making it that I was almost out of mayonnaise, so I used about a tablespoon of mayo and the rest I substituted sour cream.  Everyone liked it, from 2 years on up.  
***I will cook the broccoli longer next time.***

This was pretty good!  I served it with biscuits.  Instead of bread crumbs on top, I just crumbled some buttery, round crackers.  I think that the broccoli should have cooked longer....just personal preference, but I think it was too hard.  Also, I used sour cream instead of mayo...again, just personal preference.  This was a simple, tasty recipe.

Decided to deviate from my regular divan receipe.  Next time will add some more cooked fresh broccoli (and cauliflower) and serve over rice as very rich although I used light mayonnaise. May also add a smidge of sour cream.   No pimentos and one can of mushroom/one can of chicken soup as per previous reviewers.

Top of the food chain! Boyfriend said this was the best Chicken Divan I've ever made (I used a different recipe about 6 times)! My changes include only 1 can of crm of Chicken soup, Olive Oil Mayo mixed with a cup or "can full" of chicken broth reserved from boiling the chicken tenders. This gave is a much richer and chunkier texture. I omitted the lemon juice (im allergic) and cheese but mixed the butter and bread crumbs together in microwave for about 15 seconds then topped the casserole. Absolutely Fabulicious!!

Healthy divan:  replace mayo with plain yogurt, 1/3 of a can of chicken soup (too powerful otherwise), mixed cheeses (mozz and Hoffman's cheddar).  Delicious and quick to make.

This is awesome!  I made with a rotisserie chicken I bought.  I cooked 5 or 6 pieces of bacon and crumbled over the chix.  I used 1 can of fat free cream of chix soup, 1 can fat free cream of mush soup, lite mayo, and 1/2 of a fresh squeezed lemon.  I also sauteed a container of fresh sliced mushrooms & 1/2 an onion and added on top of the broccoli.  Instead of the bread crumbs I used crushed corn flakes mixed with melted "I can't believe it's not butter lite".  Added cracked black pepper & sea salt for seasoning.

We found this recipe very easy and yummy  to make ..i did make it a few hours ahead and put it in the frig so when i was ready all i had to do was pop it in the oven,
very Tasty i did however make a few changes to mine, i used 1 cup best foods reduced fat mayo, and 1 cup of Colby jack cheese as that is what we always have on hand, i also used fresh broccoli chopped and steamed for 1 minute.
then put every together.i also used the 26 oz size can of cream of chicken as that to was what we had on hand.
i baked it for 45 minutes let stand for 5 minutes before serving, made it along side roasted red potatos & garlic,,
fresh green salad, and garlic french bread. yummy.
will not make it to often as it is made with cream soup and it is on the heavy side,  and i try and make all my dinners more on the light and healthier side.but it for sure is a keeper.
thanks for the recipe with share it with friends & family

This has been a household staple for us for some years, but to add a little variety I use cauliflower and partially cooked baby carrots.   It is a pleasant change from broccoli and cauliflower and curry are very good marriage partners.   Enjoy.

Omgosh, 6 stars! this is so easy, healthy, and most importantly delicious! i doubled the recipe and it came out great! Just a tip: if you are using chopped broccoli make sure to mix the sauce into the casserole. All my broccoli on the bottom had no sauce, but if you ate it altogether it tasted great. if that makes any sense...

This recipe was very disappointing in both appearance and taste.  It literally tasted like something with only a few different ingredients and the consistency was a little runny or soup-like.  Probably will not make again.

Loved this! Nice change from just rice and cubed leftover chicken. I didn't change much - used  mixed frozen vegetables (broccoli, corn and caulifower) because I didn't have any plain broccoli and only added 1 can of soup, it was plenty juicy. Yum, thanks for the recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I made it after my husband requested it because it was a favorite of his growing up.  I followed other's suggestions by using fresh chicken breast. I sauteed it with some Lowry's seasoning salt to add some extra flavor. I steamed fresh broccoli. Instead of mayo I used light sour cream, low-fat sharp cheddar, and Campbell's Healthy Request mushroom and chicken soups. All in all, it was delicious. I forgot to add the milk like a previous review recommended, but it still tasted delicious. It wasn't too rich or heavy and just the right creaminess. I'll add the milk next time to see how it differs, but I'll definitely be making this again!!

One of my all time favorites from when I was a kid!  This recipe was great and very fast.  We'll definately make it again, but may add a little milk so the sauce reaches the bottom of the pan.

This was actually pretty good. I only had 1 leftover chicken breast and some leftover broccoli, so that sped up prep time, but it definitely needed a lot more chicken. The flavors blend well together. Between the bread crumbs, the mayonaise and the lemon juice, I really felt like I was eating some sort of fish dish and I wonder whether this might be a good use of leftover (mild flavor) fish??

I thought this recipe was a VERY good chicken casserole recipe. The only changes I would recommend are leave out the pimento, and use two fresh heads of broccoli and steam it until almost done. Also, I stir fried the chicken in olive oil and italian spices to give it a little kick.

Very tasty. I mixed the pimientos in with the cream of chicken soup. Also used a sleeve of crushed Ritz crackers w/melted butter for the topping instead of bread crumbs. The whole family enjoyed! Thanks for a new recipe!

Very good, very easy.  I skipped the breadcrumbs, and used twice the amount of cheese on top.
