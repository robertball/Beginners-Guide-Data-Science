This recipe as written is very bland.  Not good fried with cracker crumbs.  Like another reviewer, add Parmesan, I added garlic salt instead of garlic powder, and also the onion powder and a little cayenne to FLOUR mixed with Panko breadcrumbs for added crispiness.  Much better with these additions.

I must preface by saying while I have not made this exact recipe as listed, fried cauliflower is one of the most requested dishes in my house among my 3 kids!!  My teen sons' friends even beg for this dish!  My family could go through an entire head of cauliflower (ONLY when cooked this way) in

My mom made this for me as a child, but being southern she fried it in seasoned flour. It has a wonderfull nutty flavor when fried this way. Bread crumbs do not do it justice, but everything else in the recipi is like mom used to make.

I made fried cauliflower for first time.  Turned out great, but I used a mix of Italian bread crumbs, flour and panko bread crumbs.  I also put in the bread crumb mixture garlic powder, onion powder, ground pepper, paprika and this great shallot salt we get from local spice store.  Another tip, throw a pinch of sea salt as they're draining on paper towels.  Everyone loved it, even Coby the wonder dog!  Yum.
P.S.  I think it's the reviewers who give this recipe low stars who have no flair for seasoning.  Of course it's going to be bland if you add no seasoning.  Take a risk and create ... most of all enjoy!

Instead of the cracker crumbs, I used flour seasoned with garlic powder, salt, pepper, and paprika. They came out perfect!

My MIL makes something like this only using Italian bread crumbs.  Do a flour, egg, breadcrumb technique and it should stay on better.  After it cools (after frying) mix with a LOT of minced garlic, a bunch of diced parsley and Good Seasons salad dressing mix (prepared).  I've never made it but have watched.  It is YUMMY!

Wonderful! Tips? Only initially boil cauliflower for 4min or it will crumble, use flavorful seasoning rather than crackers (add shredded parmesan to make it even better), only fry for 3-5 seconds or it will burn, dip in ranch! This is surprisingly good.

After hearing a couple of friends tell me how good fried cauliflower was I decided to try this. I tried it this way and also tried it using the beer batter from the beer battered onion rings recipe on this site. They were both good but the beer battered ones were my fave!

I make this the way my mom always does: Using regular bread crumbs and doing a flower, egg/milk wash, and then rolling it in the bread crumbs. We eat it as a complete meal accompanied by mashed potatoes and dip the cauliflower in tartar sauce. One of my favorite dishes!

I remember my mother making fried cauliflower as my side dish for my mac&cheese, but she did it TOATALLY different.... Instead of using bread crumbs and eggs, she used pancake batter! It's was delicious! It's was savory and crunchy! Yum! :)

I agree with Wilemon.  Very bland as written.  First of all you need 3 eggs to dip an entire head of cauliflower.  Also cracker crumbs are not a good choice.  I prefer seasoned bread crumbs.  I also don't deep fry, but pan fry with vegetable oil.  The oil needs to be medium hot.  I also don't boil the cauliflower before.  I just cook it in the fry pan slowly.  Needs salt and pepper too.  When done right, it's delicious.

Absolutely divine. I used breadcrumbs, seasoned salt, garlic salt, garlic powder, oregano and parsley, cooked in EVOO. it was a little messy but the results wonderful. I ate half a head of cauliflower with a multi-tiered salad that included red peppers, zucchini, on a bed of lettuce and a dash of shredded cheese. I will make this again. Thanks !

I change the recipe as follows when I make this instead of making my own batter, I use a box of the jiffy cornbread mix and just mix it with milk until it's the right consistency to dunk the cauliflower in. Then I deep fry it. Everyone loves it and it's cheap and easy to make!

This is a great way to use up your cauliflower, I did add a lot of cayenne to the flour mixture. My 1 year old loved the small pieces after it was cooled.

I was looking for more of a carb friendly version so I made a few changes, I used the hot fried pork skins in place of the breading or flour and added some salt and pepper, and it was a total hit at my house... This is one I will be making again...

After reading the reviews on this one I decided to not use cracker crumbs and instead go with seasoned bread crumbs. First, I dipped them into beaten egg that was seasoned with garlic powder and seasoned salt, then coated them in the bread crumbs and fried until golden brown. Delicious! They turned out perfectly soft and sweet on the inside and crunchy and full of flavor on the outside. I will make this again for sure! Thanks for posting :)

I made this tonight and it was a really tasty - somewhat healthy treat.  I used whole wheat flour and canola oil to improve the nutritious factor a little.  My 15 month old daughter really liked them!

Used flour instead of breadcrumbs. Also added salt, pepper, garlic powder, & opinion powder to the flour. Dipped the cauliflower in the egg and then in the four mixture the back into the egg and again in the flour mixture. You might want to add a bit of salt and pepper into the water when boiling to give the Cauliflower some flavor, just a pinch. Don’t want it to be too salty. It turned out really good. Would have given 5 stars but the original recipe was really bland. Thanks for a basis though.

Delicious. Try using your favorite flavor of Triscuits for the crumbs. I used olive oil & pepper flavor and it was great. I also used some seafood sauce to dip it in. Yum Yum

I've made this before, but I added Italian seasoning and parmesan  cheese to the bread crumbs   Try it this way.  I think you'll really like it.  Cracker crumbs made it too salty for my taste.  With the saltiness of the cheese there's no need for more.

I made this recipe for two cauliflowers. Once I had them fried, I found out just how many family member actually likes cauliflower. Surprisingly everyone except two. Didn't take long for all of the cauliflower disappeared. I will be found this recipe again.

This was just like my Mom & Grandmother used to make when I was a child. My Grandmother was from Hungary. We used 3 eggs with milk as the dip, 2 medium size heads of cauliflower, coating with breadcrumb & panko mix, with onion powder, garlic salt, parmesan cheese. Steamed the cauliflower lightly before hand. Pan fried it in Becel oil which is canola/sunflower with the frying pan on the side burner of the BBQ so the house did not get smelly of fried food. Did not need any extra seasoning, just loved it.

I made this for my hubby and son. My son loves cauliflower, but he said he didn't like them. My husband said he would eat them again if he had to, but he would not ask me to make them again. They weren't sure what they didn't like about them, just wasn't for them.

You just have to be a little creative with this recipe, I was looking for a fried chicken substitute, I boiled the florets for just 3 minutes, dried them on paper towels then dipped them in a tempura batter seasoned like you would fried chicken (southern style) and loved it!

I like the idea here.  Maybe needed a little more flavor and the batter didn't stick very well.  Overall not worth the deep frying, but I like the idea of batter over cauliflower.  Would rather have it steamed, but would make a good fingerfood at a game or something.
