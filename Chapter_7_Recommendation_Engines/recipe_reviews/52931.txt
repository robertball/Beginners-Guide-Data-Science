This is the best clam dip I have ever had.  Once I start eating it I can not stop.

I never cared for clam dip until I had this, it is by far the best clam dip I have ever tasted.  When I start eating it I can not stop.

Bland and tasteless.  Tried to pep it up with more tobasco, horseradish and garlic but ended up tossing the mix.

I made this dip (added some green onions) and took it to a neighborhood social.  I liked it, but at the end of the evening it was hardly touched.  Party-goers finished up the crab dip, spinach dip, and other old favorites almost completley ignoring this offering.  I guess it wasn't tasty enough.

The texture of the canned clams kind of creeped me out, so next time I will use the food processor to blend it smooth.  Great flavor, I will make this again.

I have no idea what happened to this recipe as I prepared it. I followed the directions to a T, and it was YUCK.  I added more hot sauce, and cayenne, Old Bay, paprika, garlic salt and it was better.  Unfortunatly the only thing that really liked it at the picnic, were the yellow jackets!  It was a waste of good, costly ingredients.

I halved this recipe for 6 people but kept the hot sauce at 10 drops.  Served with homemade baked tortilla chips. Yummy!

Really good! Doubled the bacon, just because I had extra and also added two tablespoons of bacon grease! Yummy!

This was tasty but we needed to add alot more seasoning to get it to our liking. More of just about everything and some salt and pepper! It was really good with bbq potatoe chips!

I have made this several times, and even picky "non-seafood" eating people loved it.  As others have said, once you start, you can't stop and there is never any left over.

This is a very good dip.  It's hard to stop eating once you start.  I think I added a bit more worcestershire sauce and tobasco.  I will make this again for sure.
