This cake is great while still warm out of the oven, my daughter loves it!  We made it in a bundt pan so it would be easier to turn out onto the cake plate; so had to add about 10 extra minutes of cooking time.

Very good recipe.  I made this for my card club and they raved about it.  I used three apples, arranging them on top of the pecans.  It was beautiful when flipped onto the cake plate.  Very nice presentation and great, great taste.  Yummy.

Made this last night and we loved it! I ate so much I skipped supper. I do think next time we will put one more apples and pecans on it, and maybe make the topping alittle less sweet. (maybe add creamcheese?)  It is really good without the topping too.
