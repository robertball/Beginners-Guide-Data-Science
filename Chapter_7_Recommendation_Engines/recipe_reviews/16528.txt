This was extremely good. My husband loved it! Like a previous reviewer, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup..  I think it really helped out the texture and flavor.  I also sauteed some cut up chicken tenders and added them to the mixture to make this more of a main dish. I boiled some leftover fresh broccoli instead of the frozen kind, and I used regular white rice with a packet of chicken seasoning.  I put a lot more shredded cheese on top, so it took a lot longer than 10 minutes for it to melt and brown, but the result was excellent.  Next time I might add onions and mushrooms!  Great recipe.

Great!  I used white rice instead of yellow, adding 1/2 tsp. salt to the boiling water.  I let the broccoli thaw on the counter, then drained it.  I used Velveeta brand cheese, cut into small pieces.  After the rice cooked, I added the cheese to the top of it, covered, and let it sit for 10 minutes so that the cheese would melt.  I then added the broccoli, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper, stirred it all together, and poured into a 3-qt. glass dish.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I tried this recipe because I love broccoli and cheese together and thought it sounded good. It was really good, but was missing just a little of something. My mother tasted it...apparetly she used to make something similar) and said that it needed Creme of Mushroom soup. The next time I tried it I put the cream of mushroom soup in as well..it was AWSOME! Thanks so much for bringing this recipe to my attention - I will definitly make it again!

I used fresh broccoli and brown rice.  I also added some shredded cheddar cheese into the mix, and a can of cream of mushroom soup, as other reviewers mentioned. Pretty easy and tasty.

This is a great recipe, however, as previous "chefs" had advised, I also used a can of cream of mushroom soup! The taste was great, although it was a bit too sticky. Definitely should have added More water! Made it for my family Christmas dinner & my son ate TWO Huge helpings!! I'll definitely make this again! Very easy too! ;) Thanks for sharing!!

This is FABULOUS!!!! I was a little nervous that it would be crunchy without added water or cream of chicken or mushroom, but it was perfect!! I have made it twice. The first time I made it as a side dish exactly as the recipe stated, but I made it again adding carrots, chicken, and onion and used it as a main dish...also GREAT!!! I highly recommend this dish!! Well done!!! :)

This is a basic recipe of one I use a lot.  Cook onions with broccoli in small amount of water,  in cassarole dish add one stick of butter melted, one can of cream of celery soup, and I use about 10 oz. of process cheese, add rice and broccoli and onions and stir well.  So good.

Good.  I definitely think the cream of mushroom soup addition is a good one.  I used half velveeta and half shredded cheddar but next time I think I'll use all shredded cheddar.  Fresh steamed broccoli worked great.  In the future, I may play around with additional veggies too.  But it was great as it was too!  I too used white rice because I didn't have yellow and I cooked it in veggie broth.

I remember my grandfather making my sister and I broccoli and cheese when we were kids (probably to trick us into eating our veggies!). After stumbling upon this recipe way in the back of the ol' recipe box, I decided I'd give it a whirl. I used a jasmine rice from Trader Joe's, and it turned out well. I felt like it was missing something, and I know others have used cream of mushroom soup. However, after the last recipe I tried that called for cream of mushroom, M nearly had a fit when he found out I used that (he hates mushroom anything, as do I. However, I can tolerate the soup mixed into things, to an extent). So... so much for that idea. I'll probably make this again, regardless. Thanks, Ginger.

Made it last night, it was good, and my kids liked it.  BUT...(hehe)I didn't have any cheese sauce, so I used a can of cheddar soup with just a touch of milk.  And added some shredded cheese while it was on the stovetop.

This was good..but I gave it less stars because I modified the recipe a bit. I used plain white short-grain rice instead of yellow. I also added cream of mushroom soup, milk, salt, pepper, and sauted onions to my sauce.  I topped it all off with extra shredded cheddar cheese and french-fried onions.

Very good!  I used white rice instead of yellow.  I used cheese whiz.  It was a bit high in sodium but soooo good.

I live in Mexico and could not find the ingredients to make a green bean casserole. I made this instead for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge success! I did use Italian bread crumbs instead of pamko (as it is impossible to find pamko where I live) and halved the recipe, but I will definitely use it again for any occasion.

This was good!  I used Velveeta cheese which I melted in a little milk; I par-boiled broccoli and used some steamed rice I had previously made.   Poured the cheese sauce over the rice and broccoli and baked...

I made this and I loved it! Only thing I changed was instead of a jar of processed cheese I used a 16oz block of velveeta mexican style cheese, and used instant rice(only thing I had.) Will make again, only try the original recipe next time :)

I really liked this recipe, very tasty. I think next time I will use a little more rice, and maybe try the suggestion of cream soup. As is, if you like cheesy, cheesy rice and broccoli, this is definitely the dish for you!

There was nothing really special about this recipe. Just standard Broccoli and cheese casserole. Not a five star in my opinion.

Believe me, I'm really not into processed anything, however, I knew the kids would love this. Took the advice from other reviewers and used a healthy cream of mushroom soup. Too salty for me, but again, the kids and hubby were pleased. Thanks!

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. Easy and good. Next time I make, I will try adding the cream of mushroom soup as other reviewers suggested.

I love broccoli cheese together, but I wouldn’t use processed cheese or cream of mushroom soup. Shredded cheese and a more natural soup base - milk, flour, chicken broth.

Yes! Hubby loved this recipe. I added meat. I knew with cheese and rice my husband would be very happy. The extra plus was a little-added ground venison. Just for the two of us, I have extra for another day. Which will be soon. Because this was a big hit.

I did not make this nor will I ever. I don't understand why there is a need for canned or preprocessed ingridients? It really does not take that much time or energy to make everything from scratch with fresh ingredients. You will eat healthier and live longer. If I was ever to make this recipe, I would absolutely change it around big time, and it will be much healthier and probably contain less calories etc.

I give it a 5 only because I've never successfully executed this before. I made a few adjustments:
I boiled the rice and broccoli separately.
I also boiled Boneless Chicken breasts that  I seasoned  with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder and Old Bay. I also had a package of seasoning blend that I boiled with the chicken. 
I mixed the rice, cheese (velvetta and shredded cheese, no canned cheese is welcomed here) and cream of mushroom in the baking dish. 
I mixed in the broccoli and drained the chicken stock to the mixture for moisture. I cut  the chicken and mixed it in, then topped it off with more shredded cheese.  10 minutes in the oven to melt the cheese and it was done.

I added a can of cream of chicken soup and used cheez wiz. It is very cheesy and I found it to be very thick in the casserole dish after baking. I added small amounts of water to this finished product to loosen it up a little consistency wise. A very good cheesy rice and broccoli recipe will make again.
