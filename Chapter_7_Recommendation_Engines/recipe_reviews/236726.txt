So yummy and delicious, I doubled the recipe for leftovers. Instead of Parmesan cheese, I substituted feta and skipped the drizzling of the olive oil at the end because pesto has oil in it already. This will definitely be a staple as itâ€™s simple and very easy to make.

Delicious! I made this to serve cold for lunch today, and it really hit the spot. I used homemade pesto and black olives in place of the kalamata b/c I didn't have any. Full of flavor! This would go great w/ chicken, which is what I'm planning on making with next time. A definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I hate it when a recipe looks amazing and I don't have all the ingredients.  I didn't have anything on hand to make pesto so I used Primal Kitchen Greek dressing made with avocado oil. Seasoned more with Greek Seasoning and California Seasoned Pepper. I also added a chopped tomato and some chopped green onions. 
I only tasted it warm and thought it tasted awesome. Serving tomorrow when the kids come to visit.

We loved it!  I also put sliced green olives and capers on the side for those that wanted them.  I personally liked it that way but my sister doesn't like capers so she ate just the basic recipe and really liked it!   I had enough for lunch the next day and it was still wonderful!

I left out the olives and I revised the recipe to accommodate the needs of my family. I doubled some ingredients and lessened others. The pesto and the parmesan cheese make this dish.

It was ok. My older son liked it a lot, but I probably won't be making it again. Just not my taste.

I thought this was a great combination of flavors. Next time I'll slice the olives in halves.

This was excellent. Unfortunately I didn't notice that it only made two servings. I will make it again soon and double the recipe.

This was a huge hit at a friend's barbecue. Made it with homemade pesto, black olives, and romano instead of parmesan. Everyone loved it. We will definitely be making this again. This would also be great as a hot side dish.

Took this as a side dish for brats at a barbecue and it was a hit.  I doubled the recipe.  Hostess kept some of the leftovers, so I know she liked it too.  Delicious!
