What a great cookie. I love the shape and chocolate dopped end can be sprinkled with anything. We used Christmas sprinkles. I had already made one butter cookie so instead of vanilla I used almond extract. It was fabulous! Thanks for such a great cookie!

Great cookie. Easy to make but had to bake longer than time stated. I had problems smushing the cookie with the glass till I tore off a little strip of parchment paper and put  it between the cookie and the glass. Made it super easy to flatten.

Followed the recipe just as instructed.  These cookies taste great and are incredibly easy to make.  It made about 65 cookies(plus whatever my 3 year old ate as I was placing the balls of dough on the sheet).  We added dried cranberries because they had been in the pantry for a while and 1/2 cup m&m's that were left from Easter.  They seem like they would taste great with crushed nuts too.

Very good cookies.  They have a nice texture and not too sweet, just right.  I dipped each cookie halfway in melted chocolate and  sprinkled on finely chopped walnuts. Delicious and pretty!

Easy versatile cookie, you can pretty much do anything with it. If you mix by hand, it's not crumbly at all like another review said. You can switch out the vanilla extract to lemon, almond, orange or mint extract. I'm sure there are many options. Another bonus with this cookie is you can make so many different variations. I do have to cook these about 6 minutes longer than stated.

These are so good. Around Christmas time try dipping it in white chocolate and put crunched candy canes on the white chocolate. So so so good, I made little baskets and gave them out on Christmas to my friends.

Made these twice last Christmas, and they were a total hit with everyone in my family! Just pulling the recipe back out to make them again this year too!

I dip them in white chocolate. I also add another teaspoon of vanilla.

This year going to make the white chocolate and a mint batch. I'm going to add some peppermint extract to the dough and dip in melted Andes chocolate mint pieces this time!

These cookies were amazing! Very simple to make too! Gorgeous presentation - I dipped mine half in melted chocolate - and added chopped nuts to the tops of a few, and gold sugar to a few, and left a few plain. 

Also, I cut the recipe in half - so its easy to increase and decrease the yield. Thanks so much!

I made these exactly as the recipe is written. They are delicious. The shortbread is not sweet at all, the sweet comes from the chocolate. Iâ€™m going to take them to work and game night. Also thanks for the tip on using parchment paper under the glass when flattening them. Worked great. Thank you for the recipe.

These exactly as written, and they turned out a little dry. They are versatile - several different dips and toppings - so a great recipe for making and sharing.

These turned out great! I was looking for a shortbread recipe without any corn flour as 1. i had ran out and 2. i don't like the after taste it leaves. I just made them and they taste fantastic! I added a bit more vanilla and mixed it by hand which i think helped the crumbly situation others complained about,i dipped half of the shortbreads in milk chocolate and they taste amazing! Thank you !

Waaay too crumbly, dough hard to work with. Taste was so-so. \
