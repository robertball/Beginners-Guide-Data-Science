My husband and I are diabetic. Welcome back real cookies! The taste is excellent. No aftertaste. I have used Splenda when cooking acorn squash, with wonderful results. These cookies are an answer to a prayer.
Thank you Splenda!

These cookies taste really good.  I baked them for the folks at church.  to combat the dry issues I read about, I put a bowl of water in the oven and only baked them for 6 1/2 minutes max.  My son liked those baked with the water best.  I also sprayed my fork with pam and had no problems pressing the balls down and getting the criss-cross pattern that we all love.

I figured out the answer to getting the criss-cross pattern:  I used a cookie scoop and let them cook 4 minutes as balls.  Then I took them out of the oven and was able to make the criss-cross pattern in the softened cookie.  I then baked them 7 minutes more.  I also used a baking stone.  These cookies are great!!  I will make them again.

Just made these yesterday and wow, did they ever disappear quickly!  My three-year-old, who is the pickiest eater ever, just loved them!

The mixture is on the crumbly side, and pressing the fork into them without having them crumble everywhere can be challenging, but I pressed the sides while pressing with the fork and they took an oblong shape... but tasted fabulous!!  And I hate diet stuff!!!

I am a big fan of Splenda but cookies are a special challenge. I have used it in many other dessert recipes - Fantastic in bread pudding! I had tried it in oatmeal cookies last week and realized some adjustments were needed. I thought this recipe would be fine. I should have read the reviews! Very dry and crumbly. I even used real egg and a teaspoon of molasses. I used some 'natural' peanut butter and will allow that that may have contributed to the poor flavor. I might try this recipe again with further 'tweaking' but only if I need a 'diabetic' dessert. I only did it because my husband needs to lose some weight so we are watching calories.

I made these for my diabetic mother in law.  The dough was very crumbly and I had trouble getting them to stick together.  They tasted okay, but were so very dry.  You would need about a gallon of milk to wash down one cookie.  But the were sugar free so that's a plus.

I made these for my dad who is a recent diabetic and he loved them!  They tasted just like real peanut butter cookies to me.

4 stars for flavor

-4 stars for texture

The end result has a nice peanut butter taste.  Baking was an adventure, though.

The dough is =extremely= crumbly. I had to hand-pack it into a cookie scoop.  Don't even think about making the traditional fork pattern.  You'll get a pile of crumbs on the cookie sheet.  I had to settle for round cookies.

great peanut butter cookie . It was a little dry but that may be due to not having any honey. I definately would make this recipe again.

I used regular egg and added chocolate chips, then froze the batter. Made them easier to cook and not dry at all!

Honestly...this recipe does not even deserve one star. As others have said the dough is extremely dry and crumbly even though I followed the recipe.  The dough tasted okay but had an odd aftertaste.  I hoped that the cookies would taste better once they were cooked but that wasn't the case. Instead the cookies were dry and barely even tasted like peanut butter.  Somebody else that tried them thought that they tasted like peanut butter cardboard and both the others who I had try them said they were not good. I did not care for this.

These peanut butter cookies are VERY good. I used a whole egg instead of egg substitute.Seemed moister. (We added a few chocolate chips to some of the batter...they were really good.)

I did not care for this recipe.  It is dry and crumbly even though the center is wet.  It fell apart as soon as I bit into it.

I made this recipie with Splenda's baking blend (half sugar half Splenda) and it was fabulous.  I hope it turns out as well with all Splenda.

I agree with everyone else good on taste but dry! I would not make this recipe again unless I added eggs and choclate chips, maybe that would do the trick!

My youngest child is bipolar. Sugar has a huge negative impact on his mood. I have been looking for sugar-free recipes so his does not have to be completely deprived of sweets... this recipe is just the ticket. The crumbly texture of the 'batter' was odd, but rolling the dough into balls eliminated that. Also, I baked a dozen as balls, and they were just as yummy.

Great recipe! I used wheat flour one cup and 2 eggs instead of the substitute.  They were absolutely wonderful.

I needed an assortment of sugar free cookies, so I tried these.  They were very good.  My children loved them and couldn't tell they were not made with "real" sugar.

Should I make these?  I love peanut butter cookies, but egg substitute makes it dry.

I followed the recipe exactly and the dough came out extremly crumbly and dry. I still pressed them and tried to make cookies but some fell apart in the oven and still dry... I will have to add some water or another egg or some extra honey to the mixture.. or even reduce the amount of flour.

Mine turned out too crumbly to even roll into balls.  I used a real egg in place of the substitute, but it didn't help a bit.  We baked it in a baking dish and called it a pan cookie, but it crumbled when we removed it.  Makes a good topping over ice cream, though.  :-/

They came out very dry and seemed like they were missing something. I will not make these again.
