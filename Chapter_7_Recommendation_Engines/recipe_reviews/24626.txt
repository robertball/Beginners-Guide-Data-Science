Great salsa!  The first time I made it, I thought that the charred skin was to be removed before blending.  I tried it both ways and found the charred skin adds a lot of flavor.  I core the tomatoes & jalapeno, cut them in two and place them skin side up before broiling; I found this faster and not as messy handling the hot foods.  Great way to eat healthy tomatoes; I use this sauce as a side dish with chicken or beef too.

I've made this salsa a number of times, and adjusted it each time. I have add about 8-10 cloves of garlic to one batch; it was excellent. I also have swapped the jalapeno out and replaced it with habaneros and scotch bonnets, just to see how it tastes. If you like a bit more heat than what a jalapeno delivers, try the scotch bonnet variety instead (be sure to wash your hands well after handling and do NOT touch your eyes!). I also have used a small spanish onion or red onion, and like the results better than with a plain white onion. 
One very helpful thing I've done based on the advice of another reviewer: I halve and core the tomatoes *before* putting them in to roast and remove the skin from the garlic cloves as well. It makes it MUCH easier to handle after you take them out from under the broiler.
Very good, adaptable recipe.

This recipe is very easy and flavorful. My favorite suggestion has been to add 2-3 tsp of Liquid Smoke. The Smoked Tomato Salsa has been very popular this summer. Thanks, Katherine!

We used tomatoes from our garden rather than Romas which tasted fine but was very liquidy after blackening. Wish I would have cored before broiling. We offset the sweet taste with more salt and added a chipotle chili (the canned kind in the adobo sauce).  The result was outstanding.  Will make this one everytime.

This was a really good recipe.  Maybe I am not very proficient with a food processor but I found that hand-chopping all the ingredients (though more time consuming) pays off because it tasted much better, was less watery, and every thing was more evenly chopped.

We LOVE this stuff!  I have to check the chip supply when I make this because once we start, we can't stop!  I'm making a double batch today for the holiday weekend and visiting relatives.  Two jalapenos is perfect for us, but they like their salsa super hot...so I'll double that amount for them!

This was my first salsa and was SO good.  If you don't like it too hot you may want to omit some of the jalepeno seeds.

I've made this recipe a few times, and each time it tastes different...but good all the same.  Getting the roasted skins off the vegetables is a bit time consuming, but overall, the time that goes into it is worth it.  Tastes especially good mixed into ground beef for Mexican dishes

So good.  Cut andSeed the tomatoes (don't core thm) before you roast them.  Add a bell pepper, cored and halved and roast it too.  Put them on a wire rack on top of a rimmed cookie sheet so the heat will surround the vegetables instead of allowing them to boil in their own juices (although I still add the juices back into the salsa before pureeing).  Adding a teaspoon each of garlic powder and onion powder makes this dish transcendent.

This is the best salsa recipe out there. If you don't decide to use this recipe, at least ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS CHAR BROIL YOUR VEGGIES!!! This makes the world of a difference.  Soooooooo yummy! :)

 I food processed it, instead of blending it becuase I find when I blend it it is too watery. When broiling, peel the garlicand core the jalapeno first. Also, I broiled it a lot longer than 5 to 10 minutes, stirring about every 5 minutes. I stopped broiling until almost every veggie had a little black on it. 
If you do not have fresh romas, it tasted yummy with 28 oz. can of whole tomatoes, drained.

Time consuming, but the rich smoky flavor is worth the effort.  Don't discard the charred skins!  These are what give this salsa its distinctive flavor.  I strongly recommend making this the day before -- it is good fresh, but even better after the flavors and spices have a chance to settle and mesh together.

This is a very flexible salsa with lots of room for experimentation.  Try adding extra garlic and extra jalapenos for a richer, spicier flavor.  Today I made a batch, and realized at the end that I had no limes in the house, just a lemon -- the substitution worked beautifully and the lemon adds a brighter note.  Yummy!

My first time making salsa, too. YUM! I omitted the jalapeno and added some crushed red pepper instead. I added a few drops of liquid smoke and used dehydrated chopped onions instead of fresh (due to my allergy to raw onions), and added 1/2 tsp. of sugar. I also like chunkier salsa so I chopped instead of using the blender. Gave half to friends, and between them and myself, it was all eaten before the end of the evening. That was last week. I made an un-roasted version last night and let it sit in the fridge so the flavors could blend...I just went and stirred it up, and I am seriously considering having chips and salsa for breakfast. I will never buy salsa at the store again. I made three times as much for half the price of one bottle of my favorite brand. And this recipe is way better. Thank you!

this is an excellent salsa and easy to prepare.  I increased the lime juice and the salt for added flavor.  Be sure to leave it overnight to allow the flavors to blend before you judge this one...

Just so-so.  If you want a fresh salsa with crisp veggies then this is not the recipe you should use.  The result after charring the veggies, is more like salsa you buy in a jar or like cooked salsa.  Even if that is what you want, there was just something about the result that was just 'average'.  Won't be making this again.

In general, a very good salsa base!! I didn't bother removing cores from tomatos, and only de-stemmed my jalepenos. Because I don't like cilantro, I used Mexican oregano which gave a very unique flavor. I really charred the veggies (purposely!) which gave a really good smoky flavor. I also added some other peppers I had on hand (don't know what kind they were, sorry!) but it all came together very nicely. Just to let you know, if you've never made salsa before.... do NOT go by what it tastes like right after making it!! It will taste totally different in a day or two. I made mine two days prior to needing it, which allowed the full flavor of the ingredients to blend. I would suggest allowing at least 1 full day for flavors to blend before using!

A great recipe to add other ingredients to suit your taste, or as-is!

I made this salsa for a barbecue; people loved it and wanted the recipe. I added two jalapenos to the mix--the added spiciness offsets the sweetness. I also left the cilantro out (someone was allergic), and the sauce was still delicious.

This was a tasty salsa perfect for when vine-ripened tomatoes aren't in season. To make prep easier, I would advise steming and coring the jalapeno and tomatoes, respectively, before roasting. The roasting brings out the natural sugar in the tomatoes, making for a sweeter salsa. If you prefer your salsas less sweet, prepare the day before, refrigerate, and bring to room temperature before serving. A definite keeper!

Made this as directed except did not find it necessary to use a food processor.  It is important to chill this overnight for the flavors to marry.  This is salsa for a crowd!  We prefer uncooked tomato salsa, but it would take a lot longer to prepare this amount.  Will make it again.

Didn't like it the first day, but after it set overnight I loved it.  Roasted the tomatoes whole (took longer than 10 mins because I wanted charred) but poked a hole in the skin to allow some liquid to drain out.  Drained the juice after roasting and made a salad dressing with it.  Didn't core the tomatoes at all - why bother..  I added fresh minced garlic to it and used more onion than the recipe calls for.

I've made this recipe two times in the past wk. I used six Roma & four medium vine-ripened tomatoes. Before I roasted under the broiler: I cored tomatoes & cut them in half; stemmed and two seeded serrano & one jalapeno peppers; skinned garlic. I didn't use cilantro. Delicious recipe! Thank you KATKRO for the inspiration!

Simple and delicious. 
This is my very first attempt at salsa and it made me look like a pro. I read all of the comments about how difficult it was to stem, core, and peel the charred vegetables - I handled this by letting them cool before handling and processing.
Someone suggested using parchment in the baking pan, and that was also very helpful.
When I processed in the food processor, I only had to pulse it 3-4 times. Pulsing any more would have made the end product too soupy, as another reviewer discovered.
Thanks for a simple and delicious way to use all of the tomatoes I have been given over the summer!

Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  This was my first home made salsa and the roasted veggies added so much flavour to it!  I have saved this recipe and it will definitely be a go to favourite for me!  Loved it plain with the chips and on baked nachos!  YUMMY!

Really good salsa recipe & not difficult to make.  Have made it twice now.  My family likes it spicy so I always add a couple more peppers.

Maybe I didn't have good tomatoes, but this wasn't any good.  We threw it out.  I'll stick to my usual salsa recipe.

As recommended, I roasted all of the ingredients beforehand. I left everything else the same and it turned out absolutely wonderful! This was a great way to mix up your regular salsa routine!

I'm sorry to have to disagree and give such a low rating, but I really did not enjoy the flavor of this salsa at all.  I had to do a lot of "doctoring" to get it to a point where it was palatable for us.  The problem was the cooked taste of the tomatoes--like stewed tomatoes instead of a nice, fresh taste.  Not sure if I did something wrong, but I won't be making this again.

The family loved this salsa. The Hungry Teen did remark it was "too tomatoey". LOL, it is tomato salsa after all? I had mine under the broiler for 35 minutes turning occasionally and they skins were just starting to get charred on the tomatoes while the jalapeno was very nicely charred. The next time I fix this I will cut the tomatoes in half first and removed the centers as it was such a mess dong so after they were cooked. Mine still could have used more broiling time. I put two extra cloves garlic in (two unpeeled as directed and two peeled since I couldn't believe the directions in case the unpeeled ones were a mistake). I used all of them in the salsa and it was great. I only used 3/4 of a Texas sweet onion. It took  6 mexican key limes to equal 3 Tbl. I will use 1 more jalapeno in the future though as this was rather mild. The husband absolutely loved this! Thanks.

This is good salsa, I had to bump up the spices a little bit though.  Will make again and adjust the spices - or perhaps add another pepper.

I did not think this recipe calls for enough tomatoes. I ended up adding a can of stewed tomatoes because it had such an onion/cilantro taste. After adding the extra tomatoes it tasted quite good. Second time I made it I used green onions and 2 large cans of stewed tomatoes, however I still roasted them in the oven. I also like more spicy salsa, so I do not take the seeds out of my peppers. 

Good base recipe, I just liked some personalization.

This salsa is great.  I made a few changes based on our taste and what I can get at the fresh market where I live.  We don't have Roma tomatoes here, so I used regular tomatoes and cut them in fourths and seeded them before roasting in the oven.  Also, we love spicy, so I use two or three each of the hottest and second hottest peppers at the market.  Also, I used half a head of garlic and added more cumin (not sure how much more since I didn't measure.  I used less cilantro.  I pureed everything in the blender except the onions, which I chopped and stirred in at the end.  A versitle and delicious recipe!

I added some roasted serrano peppers and a little bit of extra roasted garlic and it was fantastic! Try just roasting the veggies on your grill while you are doing meat for a bbq, then toss em in the blender and have fresh salsa to serve with your meal! Oooooh, bbqlala!

WE LOVE THIS SALSA!!  I have made it three times now, making double or triple batches and still cannot make enough.  Roasting brings out all the wonderful flavors of the ingredients.  My only suggestion is increase the peppers to at least 2 or 3 because roasting milds their flavor.  Other than that won't dare change a thing!

Wow, this is a great salsa!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and halved & cored the tomatoes before broiling (scooped out the insides with a spoon).  I was afraid the food processor would make the soft vegetables too mushy so I just chopped them up in a bowl with my kitchen shears.  Delicious!

This is fantastic! I changed the recipe a little by  2 jalapeno peppers, 2 chipotle peppers in adobe sauce, a yellow bell pepper, 6 garlic cloves, 1 tsp of honey and more salt. I also left out the cilantro because my husband doesn't like it. I love it and so does everyone who has tried it. Such a hit, I may never buy salsa again

Sooo tasty!  I did core the tomatoes and place them skin up before I broiled them.  To add a little extra "smoke" flavor and spice, I added 2 chipotle pepppers in Adobo sauce.  SOO yummy!!!

Mmmmm...I just finished making this salsa & it is delicious, I hope I have some left for my husband when he gets home ; )  

I didn't have my veggies close enough to the broiler so it took a while longer to roast. Will make this again. Like most people I did tweak it a little.  

We have a smoker/griller and I am going to use it for  my tomatoes next time to see how much more flavor this recipe will have.  I baked cut up tortillas for chips...very good with this salsa.

My first review on this site, thank you to all of you that put up your recipes I have used many of them.

Very good salsa.  I didn't have everything to roast (I have jarred minced garlic and jarred sliced jalapeno) so I just roasted the tomatoes, but it makes for a very flavorful salsa anyway.  I wanted a chunkier salsa so I nixed the food processor altogether and just roughly chopped.  Very nice, thanks for the recipe!

A very simple recipe but, since I'm from Texas, I'm used to very spicy or hotter. Next time I will add more jalapeños for more of a bite. I did add some hot sauce since the salsa was a bit bland along with some garlic powder. Now we're getting close!

I didn't have fresh roma tomatoes, but I did have some that were already skinned and frozen from this year's garden.  I roasted the rest of the vegetables and just added the tomatoes to the blender and blended the salsa smooth.  I also omitted the cilantro because I don't care for it.  My friends and I loved it!

Awesome salsa!  I usually don't like homemade salsa, but this is really really good.  Husband and friends love this.  Put 2 jalapeno peppers in it instead of just one.  Gave it more of a kick.

Followed recipe exactly, excpt added maybe half a (canned) chipotle pepper in adobo to give it some heat (instead of the jalepeno).  Super Yummy, similar to the salsa at Pappasito's mexican restaurant.

So good.  Cored and seeded tomatoes, cut onion smaller, and cored and seeded peppers before roasting to cut down on roasting time.  Left 1-2 skins on the tomatoes.  Tastes like restaurant salsa!

Superb! This salsa is wonderful. I love the fresh flavor of the cilantro. Then ONLY thing I changed was; I used the zest of the lime to make it extra fresh...it gave the salsa alot depth.

Pretty tasty! Of course we like it hot, so I used 2 jalapeno peppers and removed some but not all of the seeds. I also used 6 large garden fresh tomatoes because that's what we've got. Left out the cilantro (hubby doesn't like it). Mine took longer to char, about 25 minutes. I think I had the oven rack too far from the broiler. I used a blender to combine everything...not big on chunky salsa. Thanks for this recipe.

Made this for our Family's Cinco de Mayo celebration.  It was a major hit.  I up'd the salt to 1 tsp and added another chili pepper.

This recipe is very tasty. I followed it for the "roast" factor. I used 4 large garden tomatoes and two jalepenos. I broiled them in the oven, coring the tomatoes first and seeding the jalepenos and cutting them in half. Instead of using the spices, I added two teaspoons knorr chix boullion and it gave it a nice flavor.

Loved it, very easy.  I haved everything before broiling and and removed jalapeno seeds and tomato cores.

Delicious! Roasting the vegetables really added a special flavor to the salsa that I enjoyed. The roasting seems to smooth over the acidity of the tomatoes. I used this recipe for a party and it was very popular! My husband loved it - he's a big salsa guy and likes spicy foods, so I did not remove the jalapeno seeds. It was kicky!

I roasted all ingredients, including unseeded, quartered tomatoes WITH a can of stewed tomatoes. Drained as much of the liquid as possible from the stewed tomatoes and reserved. The stewed tomatoes gave the salsa a more intense flavor. I didn't dump the entire thing in the food processor after broiling- I strained the watery liquid out first, then processed. Added the liquid from the can of stewed tomatoes since it had greater flavor, a little at a time. Added a little ketchup as someone suggested, which resulted in a vinegary sweetness. Adjusted with LOTS of lime juice. It was the best salsa I've made so far- really balanced yet intense! Thank you for the recipe!

A great starting place - the time for broiling was quite a bit off for me, but not a big deal, I just made sure each veg was nicely charred before taking them out. A quick churn in the food processor made quick, easy work vs. all the chopping required with fresh salsa! I threw in a chipotle in adobo for some heat and extra smokey flavor. Use your judgement on the salt, pepper, cumin, and lime juice... yours may need more or less than the recipe calls for.

I didn't review it yet because I just got done preparing it. I don't know if I did it right though, because it looks nothing like the picture. It is very watery, and I blended everything in the mixer except for the tomatoes. I chopped the tomatoes by hand thinking that would make it chunkier, but it didn't. Did I do something wrong?

Not my kind of salsa...it has a very smokey flavor that I didn't care for.  On the other hand, the rest of my office seemed to like it.  Worth a try, it's inexpensive to make.

I only had 5 roma tomatoes on hand and I was looking for a salsa recipe so they wouldn't go bad.  I added another jalapeno, one tsp of cyanne (sp?), and the salsa was wonderful. My 20 year old said it was the best salsa he has ever had. I kept all the other ingredients the same.

I love the smokey flavor that comes from cooking the tomatoes. I actually used a deep skillet on the stovetop and got great results without heating up the house with the broiler. My tomatoes were vine ripe from the backyard garden as were the jalapenos. I used a sweet onion instead, cleaned out the fridge, and it worked nicely. I could use a little more heat, but overall a great salsa.

Just made a batch of this for The Super Bowl (GO SAINTS!!!)! I've been making fresh salsa for years, but came across this recipe, & thought I'd give it a go! It turned out fantastic! I added a couple of chopped chipotles, & a tablespoon of the adobo sauce (I like it hot), & gave it a shot of siracha! I also took the advice of a reviewer & added two tablespoons of liquid smoke! Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely be making this again! Cheers! \ m /

Great recipe. I am used to making the fresh salsa, so this was a great change of pace. I roasted everything on the grill and included a poblano pepper to the mix. I omitted the olive oil and added more lime juice. I removed most of the charred skin, but will try it next time with the skin on. Great recipe. Thanks.

I discovered that I do not like cilantro. Otherwise this recipe was very good, and I will make it again, omitting the cilantro, and possibly adding more garlic, as we are huge garlic fans in this home.

This is a great recipe to use tomatoes from the garden.  Make the recipe as directed or omit the cilantro and add Italian herbs for a great pasta sauce.  This sauce freezes well too.

This is a great Salsa recipe.  Roasting or grilling the veges is key to this recipe.  I used a serano pepper because its what I had on hand.  Next time I'll cut the cumin down a little and add another pepper to kick up the heat a bit.

This salsa was ok. I will try it again and use half fresh tomatoes and half canned. The fresh ones just didn't have enough flavor. I will also add more jalapeno and less onion.

Wow, what a great salsa!  My guests all raved about the "better than restaurant" style salsa.  The only change I made was to add a few tablespoons of chopped chipolte chilis in adobo sauce but that's just my  preference.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is delicious. I found that after grillig the tomatoes until charred, when it came to processing, the tomatoes mushed, rather than chopped. So it is not a chunky salsa. The flavour is incredible. I did not use jalepeno pepper, but our home grown hot peppers. My daughter said she finally tasted a salsa she likes.

Awesome! And it's super-awesome the next day. ;) This is my go-to salsa recipe from now on. I followed it exactly, except I didn't measure the lime juice - just used what I could squeeze out of 1 lime.

I loved this salsa, and I am not a huge salsa fan.  When I make it again, I will add a small chipotle pepper in adobo sauce.  Then we'll really be rocking!!

It's a pretty good salsa, and the roasting is a nice touch.  Mine came out very wet and soupy, though, so I had to drain-off a good bit of liquid before it was able to actually stay on a chip.

This is delicious!  It took a little longer than 10 minutes in my sketchy old oven, but it was wonderful served up with rice and beans on a summer night.

Made this one last night. Only thing I did different was double the garlic and jalepeno peper...It was delicous...no leftovers! Awesome recipe!

This was so easy and is so good!  I broiled just tomatoes and onion and then added pre-diced garlic from a jar and jalapeno nacho rings (for a milder salsa) into the food processor while blending with the cilantro, lime, etc.  I also added about a tsp. of sugar and it turned out really good!

This is exactly the taste I was hoping for.  Next time I will add more jalapenos but it is an excellent, fresh tasting salsa.  Thanks, Katherine!

I love roasted vegetables, and this was perfect! We added some corn to it after it was all chopped and sitting on the stove for a few minutes. I ended up making about 8 jars and we only have 2 left!

Very good. I really like this flavor. The thing is to put enough jalapenos, that will spice it up and the salsa won't be too sweet.

It turned out really well.

I made a few alterations. First I started out by using four cloves of already peeled garlic, also I diced a red onion rather than quartering it, since I don't own a food processor. After putting S&P and oil on the veggies I broiled them 10 minutes on each side to ensure charing, I sat them aside to cool in a metal bowl with plastic wrap covering it (that usually helps the skins blister and separate). After letting them cool enough down to be able to handle them, I cored and diced everything. In retrospect I probably should have seeded the Jalapeño before I roasted it, I typically don't like to include the seeds as I prefer things to stay a little on the mild side. Also, I don't have fresh cumin on hand so I did that to taste which is much better than just adding a teaspoon blindly and I just used the juice of one whole lime.

This is a wonderful recipe.  We recently went on a cruise including Cozumel and we went to a class for salsa and margarita and guacomole class, it was GREAT.. but they didn't tell you how to get the tomatoes soft..so I found this one.. this is very very close to the authentic recipe from Cozumel.. My husband loves this recipe.. and it's totally a keeper, in Texas we have tons of different types of salsas.. this is close to one the Chuy's has.. so if people don't like the texture it's perhaps they are either used to just pico or jared sauce.  this is an authentic style Tex-Mex at least. thank you.

I made the recipe as written, and in the food processor, it was very thick. I added the lime juice and seasonings, and have a total of maybe 3/4 cup of salsa, all told. I used 12 roma tomatoes. The tomatoes were still juicy when I put them in the food processor, I guess just not enough. I dunno what happened.

Delicious!!!  I ate with Rice crackers for a more healthy alternative, and didn't miss the chips.  The roasted jalopeño had a different kind of hot - one that was yummy and hot but didn't burn in my throat.  Can't wait to serve it!

Really great recipe! This was my first time making homemade salsa and I researched a bunch of recipes before settling on this one. It's easy and the outcome is amazing. I cut the recipe in half, but accidentally used too much jalapeno pepper (1 1/2 peppers) because I wanted it spicy, and boy was it! Definitely going to only use 1/2 a jalapeno next time, which is what the recipe calls for if you make 12 servings instead of 24. Very flavorful and delicious!

Very good, although I used 6 cloves of roasted garlic and still didn't taste any garlic, so added 1 clove fresh. That did the trick! I also followed other reviewer's recommendations to core the tomatoes and jalapenos before roasting. I also seeded the jalapeno, which I later regretted when the salsa needed more kick. No matter, I just added another roasted, seeded jalapeno and got just the right amount of heat. Definitely give this a try!

I did what other reviewers suggested and cored the tomatos and peeled the garlic before roasting which was wise. Aside from that, I prepared it as written. It was good, but very watery. Next time I'll seed some of the tomatos and I also like my salsa spicier, so I'll add another jalapeno.

I got a food processor for my birthday and this is the recipe I chose to try it out on. It was great! I LOVE the fact that it's all fresh ingredients that go into this salsa. I did feel as though something was missing, however. I'll play around with this one for sure!

This salsa isn't quite what I was hoping it would be.  I can taste every individual ingredient (including the olive oil) instead of all the flavors melding together into one.  Overall, the tomato flavor is overpowered by everything else.

Yum!  I made 1/2 a recipe which was perfect to have with our mexican dinner plus a little leftover.  I cut & seeded  tomatos and jalapenos and peeled the garlic before roasting.   My husband suggested that I peel the tomoatos next time.  Great flavor!

I was happy to finally see a salsa with fresh ingredients!  I wasn't sure about the roasting part, but we followed this one to the letter.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  I think we were after something more along the lines of a "garden salsa".  We'll give it another shot, but skip the roasting part.

I made this salsa for two different holiday parties - everyone loved it!  The level of spiciness was just right.  Even the hard core spicy lovers were satisfied.  The cilantro was a bit overwhelming in the first batch I made so I halfed the amount the recipe called for in the second batch.  I also added salt to taste.  Thanks much for sharing!

This is a good salsa, and it's easy to make, but it's certainly not a five-star recipe. After a decent amount of prep work (lots of tomatoes to core) and a somewhat lengthy time investment considering this is a salsa recipe (took me a heck of a lot longer than 10 minutes), I ended up with salsa that was just like the fresh stuff available in plastic containers at the supermarket. 
It wasn't "chunky" after my food processor was done with it, and certainly not very "smoky"--why else would everyone be adding liquid smoke to it? Perhaps I needed to turn the veggies into charcoal?
It's a great recipe for standard fresh salsa, but for me it wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped.

This salsa is phenomenal!  I've been looking for a recipe that would come close to the salsa you get at Chevy's and this did it.  I did change a few things, however.  Instead of one, I used 3 jalapenos, which I removed the ribs and seeds from prior to roasting.  I also omitted the cumin because I wanted a fresher taste, added a good amount of black pepper (I once got a look at the actual recipe for Chevy's salsa and remembered there being something like 2lbs of black pepper in it-of course, in proportion to the massive amounts of tomatoes it called for), and put in about a tsp. of liquid smoke to add to the roasty flavor.  This recipe makes A LOT of salsa, so be prepared to have a full belly from eating so much of it!

Yes, I made it. But, it's pretty weak as far as Salsa's go. Tasty, I guess, but weak.  I used 3 larger sized Jalapeno peppers. Took the seeds out of 2, left the seeds in the 3rd. It won't burn you're lips off I promise. For Salt & Cumin...use Tablespoons instead of Teaspoons. Use a Large Onion. Use a Bulb of Garlic...not 2 Cloves. Geez...Come on man. No need to discard the center of the Tomatoes...the chop up in a food processor just fine. Here in Nevada the original would qualify as water. Even my variation in someplace like Texas would be a weak-kneed Sister of true Salsa. Make and enjoy... :)

I like the recipe and has the right flavors for me but as I get older, just can't do hot anymore. It was pretty hot and will probably dump it and start over with an Aneheim or seeded Jalepeno.

I made this a couple day ago to go with the sheet pan shrimp fajitas recipe on this site and it was wonderful! I have been making fresh salsa about every two weeks for the last 34 years. My husband loves spicy salsa! This was a great change from my usual salsa.  Since my husband does love spicy hot salsa I did change things a bit, I used three jalapeños ( the ones I have been getting have a very mild heat, I should have used a Serrano chili), I also used 3 cloves of garlic, a small sweet onion, 7 large beefsteak tomatoes. After charing the veggies I took the skin off the tomatoes that had loosened up enough to pull free easily, plus the jalapeños skin came off nicely. I had skinned the garlic before roasting so it was nicely roasted. I added all to the food processor and then added the other ingredients and pulsed until it was to the desired consistency. I had to make him my regular salsa a few days later so this won't be taking its place but it was a nice change.

Did the recipe exactly as it called for and yuk! I've had better store bought. Wasted money on this one. Will stick with my Ol Gringo Salsa from New Mexico.  It is worth the shipping charges for a good quality tasting salsa ..sorry to whoever came up with this one.

Very good roasted salsa.  I will definitely be making it again.  It was a bit time consuming, but easier than chopping all the veggies before making salsa.

I've made this twice, and it's good, no matter how I tweak it.  I've used a variety of kinds of tomatoes and peppers, and differing amounts of onion, and the flavor never disappoints.  The broiling adds a nuance that I've never found in another homemade salsa.

So, it was pretty mild without the seeds, and since I didn't want seeds in mine, I did the following, I doubled the jalapeno peppers, added a red chili pepper (flavor booster) and a finger hot pepper, added three rings of pineapple, removed the cumin as I wanted this all fresh produce flavors and now it tingles the lips very nicely.  Kept the skins on all of the roasted produce and I have to say this is a very nice flavor mix.

Tasty salsa. I used a total of 4 Serrano Chiles because we like it on the spicy side. Needs a little more salt, some cumin and some black pepper.

This was ok but not really worth the amount of work. We found it to be bland also ... and my jalapenos were not very hot.

Ok, so I might have deviated a little from the recipe, but the base was the same. I used all of the ingredients except the lime which I forgot! But I broiled about half of the tomatoes and sliced the other half with the onion, japs, garlic, and sauteed it in a pan for about 20 minutes before mixing it all together! It turned out wonderfully, but I think more garlic (for those garlic addicts (like myself) and a few more peppers for some more heat. Other than that I wouldnt change the recipe much more! Thanks for a great idea!

This was so smokey and delicious!  I did not remove any skins. I wanted a distinct smokey flavor and it really delivered. It was a bit more on the sweet than hot side but my boyfriend loved it and I will definitely be making it again.  Next time I may add another jalapeno pepper or two.

Great recipe. I used both jalapeno and poblano peppers, cut everything in half lengthwise, scooped out the seeds and broiled them skin side up.  Chopped them with a knife.  Great flavors, and it's easy to regulate the heat by managing the type and number of Chile peppers used.

DELICIOUSS!! I used avacado oil instead and it added a nice flavor. I Added a habernro pepper and 2 jalapeños. Just the right amount of hot and still plenty of flavor. All were broiled for 10min then blended. Smooth yet nice crunch of peppers and onions.

Outstanding salsa. Very simple process but a great amount of depth to the flavour. I made this exactly as instructed except that I needed about twice as much time to properly char the veggies.  I've been told by my family that this is our new salsa for good.

Good solid recipe. Fairly light on the flavors. After tasting, I tripled the garlic, doubled the salt. Wasnt quite as spicy as I like, so next time using 2 jalapenos. My girlfriend said it tasted great, even better than her usual store bought brand.. Green Mountain.

I don't normally  post reviews for recipes that I have changed. However I don't know how else to thank KATKRO for sharing this recipe. The only reason I made salsa the first time was that I learned that I can't have garlic and cannot find a commercial salsa that doesn't contain it. I like to use salsa in various recipes. When preparing this recipe, I leave out the garlic and cilantro because my family doesn't like cilantro. I also increase the salt. I've made it 4-5 times now and we like it so well with tortilla chips that I haven't wanted to use it in my intended recipes.
Thank you KATKRO for this versatile recipe!

This is a great table salsa.  I followed the recipe and it was very good. I did add the cilantro in with the tomatoes when I pureed it so I didn't have big leaves. I also modified it by adding another pepper (I had a serrano on hand) and it was very good and 4 1/2 stars with the modifications.  Next time I will do as another reviewer suggested and core the tomatoes and peppers before I roast them.  Doing it after was messy.

This was awesome.  I did what Karin did and added the adobo chipotle peppers and more salt because I used my garden tomatoes. I cored everything before broiling. Used 8 large garlic cloves and two large jalapeños . Everything else the same except mixed all in the food processor. Will make this every time.

It was excellent.  The second time in desperation I used regular canned diced tomatoes and it was just as good.  I drained them first.

I liked this, but I probably won't use the recipe again.  Everybody has a particular preference in salsas, and I guess I'm still on a quest to find a recipe for my favorite.
